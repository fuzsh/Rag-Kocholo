        "text": "Cecil Woolf, who has died aged 92, was the last surviving person to have known well his aunt, Virginia Woolf, and her husband Leonard, to whom he bore a striking resemblance; he subsequently followed in their footsteps by setting up an independent publishing house, doing much of his business from the same table that they had used at the Hogarth Press.\n\n“Virginia has inspired generations of women, all part of a larger cultural change,” he reflected latterly. “Of course, I feel privileged to have known Virginia a little, and Leonard very well all those years; I feel it’s a tremendous privilege.” But Cecil Woolf came to view the ever-expanding Bloomsbury industry, and the interest in its denizens, as something of a circus.\n\nHe had too much style and charm, however, to say more at the events and conferences he was prevailed upon to attend than that he always saw Virginia through the prism of his childhood in the 1930s. Then, she was merely a well-regarded writer rather than a feminist icon.\n\nHis earliest memory of her was of going together to a grotto near his family home on the Waddesdon estate in Buckinghamshire. They had called each other’s names and listened to the echo.\n\nHe could also recall visiting Lenny and Virginia – never “Aunt” or “Uncle” – at their home in Tavistock Square, Bloomsbury. Cecil would help them to pack books for dispatch and walk with Virginia to the London Library.\n\nHe also spent time with them at Monk’s House, their home in Sussex. “What was nice about staying with them as a child was being left on your own to amuse yourself – you weren’t entertained,” he told an interviewer in 2009. “They got on with their lives and didn’t expect you to interrupt them.” None the less, Virginia, whom he thought “volatile, mercurial”, could be “be quite sharp – she looked sharp, her face was sharp.”\n\n“When you arrived,” he added, “she might ask about your journey and she wanted every detail. ‘OK, you came by train. Tell me about the people in the carriage.’ She’d probe. I suppose I was quite the observant child and I came from a bookish family, so I wasn’t too thrown by that. It was the novelist’s search for copy, ideas.”\n\nHe was told of his aunt’s death by his English teacher, G Wilson Knight (later known as a scholar of Shakespeare), soon after he turned 14. Virginia Woolf had committed suicide by drowning. Her death was perhaps given greater poignancy by the death of Cecil’s own mother, who took her life after being given bromide, which is a depressant, as a medication for arthritis.\n\nContrary to the view of some fans of Virginia, Cecil did not regard Leonard as a chauvinist who had oppressed his wife. Instead, he was admiring of his long support for a creative person who suffered regularly from mental instability, this in an era when the likes of T S Eliot and Roger Fry committed their ill wives to the asylum.\n\nCecil, who for a time worked in the family stockbroking firm, came to know Leonard still better after the war. For two decades he lived in a basement flat of the house that his uncle had in Victoria Square, near Buckingham Palace. The painter Duncan Grant had the top floor.\n\nCecil liked to tell the story of how, some years after the household had broken up following Leonard’s death in 1969, he had run into Grant and noticed he had grown his hair long. “Yes…,” came Grant’s reply after a long interval. “My barber died.”\n\nWhen Cecil would stay with him at Monk’s House, he would creep out to the pub after supper in search of a second, less frugal repast. To his inquiry as to whether there was anything left to eat, the landlord would reply: “Staying with Mr Woolf, are you?”\n\nCecil James Sydney Woolf was born on February 20 1927. His father Philip was one of 10, his brothers including not only Leonard but also Cecil, for whom his son was named. Philip and Cecil were wounded by the same shell at the Battle of Cambrai in 1917 but only the former survived.\n\nWith his two sisters, Cecil grew up at Waddesdon in a house originally built by Cardinal Wolsey. His father, who was related to its owner, James de Rothschild, by marriage, was the estate manager. The two men later worked together to help Jews escape from Europe before the war.\n\nCecil was educated at Stowe, where he showed talent in music and took the top mark in the country for English literature when he sat his School Certificate, the exam then taken by 16-year-olds. Later that year he cycled to Northampton to volunteer for the Army and, as a private soldier in the Royal Tank Regiment, was sent out to Italy as the war neared its end.\n\nHe was subsequently commissioned and served in Palestine before being demobbed in 1947. He was an accomplished horseman, and an unexpected call on his skills was a request to teach his commanding officer how to ride.\n\nWoolf claimed that he found Italian straightforward to understand because of his knowledge of Latin, and Italy and its civilisation was to prove a constant inspiration. If he could get to Venice, he would – his children were driven there from England, in a car furnished with bunk beds, and they all camped on the Lido – and he would become notably less tongue-tied in the presence of belle donne.\n\nHis first marriage, in 1960, was to an actress of Italian descent, Malya Nappi, but she was more than a decade older than him and the relationship had run its course by the time he met his second wife, the biographer Jean Moorcroft Wilson, in the Reading Room of the British Museum.\n\nThey were married in 1981, and settled in Mornington Crescent, North London, where Woolf became a familiar figure in the community, campaigning successfully to re-open the local Underground station. Though self-deprecating, he was a shrewd bargainer and surprisingly practical. When he and his wife bought a house in France, he did much of the plumbing and rewiring."
