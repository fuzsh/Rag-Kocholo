        "text": "VIRGINIA WOOLF\n\nAn Inner Life.\n\nBy Julia Briggs.\n\nIllustrated. 528 pp. Harcourt. $30.\n\nIN January 1915, when Virginia Woolf was 33, she and her husband, Leonard, resolved to do three things: lease a house outside London; acquire a printing press; and buy a bulldog. As Julia Briggs recounts in her intelligent and well-researched new biography of Woolf, the couple never got the dog, but the creation of the Hogarth Press -- named after Hogarth House, their new home -- significantly influenced 20th-century literature. Purposely seeking out \"work that might not otherwise get into print,\" they published T. S. Eliot, Katherine Mansfield and Woolf herself. Freed from commercial pressures, Woolf could now pursue her most \"radically experimental\" leanings, and in her formal innovation, she became a pioneer of modernism.\n\nToday, some of Woolf's books seem stylized, at times experimental for the sake of being experimental -- \"The Waves\" comes to mind -- but her most widely read and admired works, including \"To the Lighthouse\" and \"Mrs. Dalloway,\" are read and admired for a reason. Briggs's subtitle pays tribute to Woolf's exploration of the inner life, her ability to capture the nebulousness of the human experience as it plays out second by second and translate it, in thrillingly nuanced ways, into words. Woolf's thoughts on gender inequality and war, both potentially unpopular subjects that the Hogarth Press gave her the luxury of addressing, also remain powerfully relevant: \"The reason why it is easy to kill another person must be that one's imagination is too sluggish to conceive what his life means to him,\" she once wrote in her diary.\n\nBorn in 1882, Virginia Stephen was the third of four children from her parents' marriage; she also had four older half siblings. The stability of the erudite, affluent Stephen home -- a household of \"books, writers and literary gossip\" and \"jokes, anecdotes and feuds\" -- was ruptured by the sudden death of her mother from rheumatic fever when Virginia was 13. Over the next nine years, Virginia's half sister, father and brother also died. This series of tragedies, Briggs argues, accounted for Woolf's adult sense of precariousness, her awareness of the menace lurking beneath tranquillity. A feeling of unease strongly influenced Woolf's fiction and replayed itself in her own life, as she tried, often without success, to maintain mental and emotional equilibrium.\n\nBut if her \"madness,\" as she and her family called it, was a defining aspect of her life from early on, so was an almost preordained sense of herself as a writer. This belief in her destiny existed long before she'd completed a book, and it meant that everything else, including her closest relationships, was secondary to her consuming interest in language and character. \"I am ashamed, or perhaps proud, to say how much of my time is spent in thinking, thinking, thinking about literature,\" she wrote in one letter; and, in another, \"I've shirked two parties, and another Frenchman, and buying a hat, and going to tea with Hilda Trevelyan: for I really can't combine all this with keeping my imaginary people going.\""
