        "text": "Virginia Woolf wrote far more fiction than Joyce and far more nonfiction than either Joyce or Faulkner. Nine novels, six volumes of diaries (including her early journals), six volumes of letters, and numerous volumes of collected essays show her deep engagement with major 20th-century issues.\n\nThough many of her essays began as reviews, written anonymously to deadlines for money, and many include imaginative settings and whimsical speculations, they are serious inquiries into reading and writing, the novel and the arts, perception and essence, war and peace, class and politics, privilege and discrimination, and the need to reform society.\n\nHer Novels in Chronological Order\n\nThe Voyage Out\n\nNight and Day\n\nJacob’s Room\n\nMrs Dalloway\n\nTo the Lighthouse\n\nOrlando\n\nThe Waves\n\nThe Years\n\nBetween the Acts\n\nHer Short Stories\n\nThe short stories of Virginia Woolf have never received serious scrutiny, critics determinedly maintaining that the novels contain the heart of the matter and that the stories are merely preparatory exercises. A careful analysis of her forty or so known stories suggests that they are indeed important (not merely peripheral to the novels and criticism) and are successful in developing specific techniques and themes germane to her total canon.\n\nThe stories derive from three distinctly separate chronological periods. The earliest group (1917-1921) was published in Monday or Tuesday and included two stories available only in that volume, now out of print. This phase of creation utilized one primary technique—that of evolving an apparently random stream of impressions from a usually inanimate and tiny focusing object, and was generally optimistic about the “adorable world.”\n\nThe second group of her short fiction (those stories appearing in magazines between 1927 and 1938) illustrates a progression in both technical virtuosity and in personal discipline: the fictional universe is now peopled, and the randomness of the early sketches has given way to a more selective exploitation of the thoughts inspired by motivating situations.\n\nThe third group, posthumously published by Leonard Woolf in 1944 without his wife’s imprimatur (and recognizably “only in the stage beyond that of her first sketch”), still reveals a desire in the author to pursue her original objective suggested in “A Haunted House“–the unlayering of facts to bare the “buried treasure” truth, using imagination as her only tool.\n\nHer short stories in alphabetical order:\n\nBut by neglecting the stories the critics have missed a mine of information: herein lies an “artist’s sketchbook,” which, like A Writer’s Diary, provides a major avenue into the mind of one of the most remarkable writers of our age.\n\nHer Playwriting\n\nFreshwater: A Comedy\n\nHer Long Form & Collected Essays\n\nNo only was Virginia Woolf a great novelist and writer of short stories, she was also an essayist of amazing stylishness and wit. Her models were the classical essayists of the eighteenth and early nineteenth century – Addison, Steele, Hazlitt, and Lamb – all of whom she had read during her literary apprenticeship, which took place in the library of her father, Sir Leslie Stephen.\n\nWoolf wrote a body of autobiographical work and more than 500 essays and reviews, some of which, like A Room of One’s Own (1929) were of book length. Not all were published in her lifetime. Shortly after her death, Leonard Woolf produced an edited edition of unpublished essays titled The Moment and other Essays published by the Hogarth Press in 1947. Many of these were originally lectures that she gave and several more volumes of essays followed, such as The Captain’s Death Bed: and other essays (1950).\n\nOn Being Ill (1926)\n\nA Room of One’s Own (1929)\n\nWalter Sickert: A Conversation (1934)\n\nThree Guineas (1938)\n\nThe Death of the Moth and Other Essays (1942)\n\nThe Moment and Other Essays (1947)\n\nThe Captain‘s Death Bed and Other Essays (1950)\n\nGranite and Rainbow (1958)\n\nGranite and Rainbow was first published by the Hogarth Press in 1958. Since that time, any further non-fiction prose writings by Virginia Woolf that have come to light have been published in the six-volume edition of her complete essays edited. Between 1986 and 1994, Andrew McNellie, now , was the editor of the first four volumes of The Essays of Virginia Woolf, published as the critical edition by Hogarth Press and Stuart N. Clarke Woolf scholar edited volumes 5 and 6. Some of Woolf’s long form essays were and still are published separately as well as in collections.\n\nEssays of Virginia Woolf, Vol. 1, 1904-1912\n\nEssays of Virginia Woolf, Vol. 2, 1912-1918\n\nEssays of Virginia Woolf, Vol. 3, 1919-1924\n\nEssays of Virginia Woolf, Vol. 4, 1925-1928\n\nAndrew McNeillie, series editor for volumes 1 to 4, is the literary editor for Oxford University Press and is the author of several well-received volumes of poetry.\n\nThe Essays of Virginia Woolf, Vol. 5, 1929-1932\n\nThe Essays of Virginia Woolf, Vol. 6, 1933 to 1941\n\nStuart N Clarke, series editor for volumes 5 and 6, has transcribed and edited Virginia Woolf’s Orlando: The Original Holograph Draft, was cocompiler with B. J. Kirkpatrick of the fourth edition of A Bibliography of Virginia Woolf, and edited Translations from the Russian by Virginia Woolf and S. S. Koteliansky. He is a founding member of the Virginia Woolf Society of Great Britain and has edited its journal, the Virginia Woolf Bulletin, since its inception.\n\nHer Biographies\n\nRoger Fry: A Biography (1940)\n\nFlush: A Biography\n\nHer Literary Criticism\n\nWoolf’s prolific career in literary criticism situates her in the common critical practices of her day and crystallizes basic tenets and a critical theory of sorts from her critical journalism published 1904–1928. Woolf’s appeals to writers to invest all their energy in improving their skills in character portrayal to adequately depict all classes and genders in order to invent a new kind of psychological fiction.\n\nThe Common Reader – First Series (1925)\n\nThe Common Reader – Second Series (1932)\n\nGenius and Ink (2019)\n\nHer Autobiographical Essays\n\nReminiscences (1907)\n\n“Reminiscences” was written early in Virginia Woolf’s writing career, when she was deliberately setting herself a series of exercises and tests in order to develop her writing skills. One of these was to describe her childhood. Woolf’s feelings for her sister Vanessa were among the most significant in her life. The complex web of relationships of the people that inhabited the home where most of “Reminiscences” is set is examined.\n\n22 Hyde Park Gate (1921)\n\nVirginia Woolf describes her childhood home, 22 Hyde Park Gate, London, England. She recalls that there were many visitors to the family’s drawing room. She also shares her recollections of family members. She notes that her half brother George Duckworth (1868–1934) lacked intelligence but fit right into Victorian culture of late 19th-century England. George steered away from literature which is Woolf’s primary interest. He was instead driven to succeed in society.\n\nOld Bloomsbury (1922)\n\n“Old Bloomsbury” is the second of three sections of Moments of Being that Virginia Woolf wrote to be read before the Bloomsbury Memoir Group of writers who lived in London, England. The essay begins by mentioning how her half brother George Duckworth (1868–1934) sexually abused her which is a topic Woolf also discusses earlier in Moments of Being.\n\nAm I a Snob? (1936)\n\n“Am I a Snob?” is the third of three sections of Moments of Being that Virginia Woolf wrote to be read before the Bloomsbury Memoir Group of writers who lived in London, England. “Am I a Snob?” is related to the previous section, “Old Bloomsbury,” because it discusses the social and intellectual circle that Woolf moved in. However, while “Old Bloomsbury” focuses on the intellectual independence of Woolf’s circle, “Am I a Snob?” focuses on the group’s excesses and shortcomings.\n\nHer Letters\n\n“Magnificant,” was the verdict of the Publishers Weekly when the first volume of Virginia Woolf’s letters appeared, and critics found the succeeding volumes equally impressive.\n\nVirginia Woolf was a correspondent of genius–high-spirited, inventive, witty — whether commenting on a domestic crisis or the state of the nation, a social outing or peregrination of the writer’s mind. She wrote to charm and entertain her friends, with the added seductiveness of gossip and cheerful malice.\n\n“She lives in her letters,” Joanne Trautmann Banks writes, and offers fresh perspectives on her life. “The Virginia Woolf who creates herself in her letters is different from the one who slowly emerges from her novels, short stories and essays. This Virginia is simultaneously more vulnerable and more admirable… her laughter is heard even more clearly.”\n\nThe Flight of the Mind: The Letters of Virginia Woolf, Volume One (1888 – 1912)\n\nThe Question of Things Happening: The Letters of Virginia Woolf, Volume Two (1913 – 1922)\n\nA Change of Perspective: The Letters of Virginia Woolf, Volume Three (1923 – 1928)\n\nA Reflection of the Other Person: The Letters of Virginia Woolf, Volume Four (1929 – 1931)\n\nThe Sickle Side of the Moon: The Letters of Virginia Woolf, Volume Five (1932 – 1935)\n\nLeave the Letters Till We’re Dead: The Letters of Virginia Woolf, Volume Six (1936 – 1941)\n\nLove Letters of Virginia Woolf & Vita Sakville-West\n\nHer Diary\n\nVirginia Woolf was not only a masterful author, editor, publisher, letter-writer and little-known children’s book author, but also a dedicated diarist on par with Susan Sontag and Anaïs Nin. Although she kept some sporadic early journals, Woolf didn’t begin serious journaling until 1915, when she was 33. Once she did, she continued doggedly until her last entry in 1941, four days before her death, leaving behind 26 volumes written in her own hand.\n\nIn an entry from April 20th, 1919, Woolf makes a case for the creative benefits of keeping a diary and argues for it as an essential tool for honing one’s writing style:\n\nI got out this diary and read, as one always does read one’s own writing, with a kind of guilty intensity. I confess that the rough and random style of it, often so ungrammatical, and crying for a word altered, afflicted me somewhat. I am trying to tell whichever self it is that reads this hereafter that I can write very much better; and take no time over this; and forbid her to let the eye of man behold it.\n\nAnd now I may add my little compliment to the effect that it has a slapdash and vigour and sometimes hits an unexpected bull’s eye. But what is more to the point is …my belief that the habit of writing thus for my own eye only is good practice. It loosens the ligaments. Never mind the misses and the stumbles. Going at such a pace as I do I must make the most direct and instant shots at my object, and thus have to lay hands on words, choose them and shoot them with no more pause than is needed to put my pen in the ink.\n\nThe Diary of Virginia Woolf, Volume One: 1915-1919\n\nThe Diary of Virginia Woolf, Volume Two: 1920-1924\n\nThe Diary of Virginia Woolf, Volume Three: 1925-1930\n\nThe Diary of Virginia Woolf, Volume Four: 1931-1935\n\nThe Diary of Virginia Woolf, Volume Five: 1936-1941\n\nA Writer’s Diary: Events Recorded from 1918-1941"
