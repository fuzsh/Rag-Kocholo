        "text": "Breaking boundaries\n\nVirginia was happily married to Leonard for almost 30 years, but also had an intense affair with another married writer, Vita Sackville-West. Virginia's love of Vita inspired the novel Orlando (1928), which imagines Vita (as Orlando) living through centuries, shifting gender and commenting on the changing assumptions about love, marriage and the role of women over time. Orlando’s ancestral home is based on Knole, Vita’s family home, and expresses Virginia's attachment to the place.\n\nSussex and Monk’s House\n\nThough Virginia Woolf is often seen as a London writer (which she certainly was), both she and Leonard Woolf had an abiding love for the South Downs. They purchased Monk’s House near Rodmell in 1919, and from then on used it as their writer’s retreat.\n\nMonk's House wasn't the only Bloomsbury outpost in the South Downs. In 1916, Virginia's sister, the artist Vanessa Bell, moved to Charleston Farmhouse with the painter Duncan Grant. Bell and Grant lived and worked at Charleston on and off for the rest of their lives, regularly hosting Bloomsbury friends and acquaintances, including Virginia and Leonard.\n\nImagining the landscape\n\nThe Sussex landscape was integral to Woolf’s writing, and she attempted to capture what she saw as its unsurpassable beauty in her novels and essays.\n\nShe was also engaged in its conservation, writing against unsympathetic developments in the countryside with a passion matching that of the National Trust and the Council for the Preservation of Rural England.\n\nVirginia's legacy\n\nVirginia Woolf's novels are now among the most important works of modern English literature. Her books reveal her profound skill as a writer, as well as her broad-ranging, fluid approach to life.\n\nTo Virginia and the Bloomsbury Group she was part of, gender and sexuality were not made up of a simple, confining set of rules. They were a malleable, shifting spectrum of experiences. It was a bold view that helped to challenge some of the stifling expectations of society.\n\nVirginia’s story is just one of those we explored in 2017 as part of a programme called Prejudice and Pride. As part of the programme, we held events, exhibitions and installations telling the stories of the men and women who challenged conventional notions of gender and sexuality, and who shaped the properties in which they lived.\n\nTrusted Source\n\nThis article contains information written by Allison Adler Inglis-Taylor from the University of Oxford."
