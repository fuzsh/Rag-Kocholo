        "text": "October 11, 2014\n\nAs I finished reading the final letter in this collection, I wanted to scream \"No! I want more!\". I wanted to read more of Leonard's letters to his friends, to the authors he worked with when he was still active in the Hogarth Press, and letters he'd written to Trekkie Parsons. I was left with some questions: What did Ian Parsons actually feel about this later-life love affair between his wife and Leonard? Was he jealous? All that's said in the biographical section at the end of the book is that he and Leonard remained close friends until the end of Leonard's life. And what about Trekkie herself? Was she as deeply in love with Leonard as he was with her? I believe I'm going to have to read the biography I have of Leonard Woolf, by Victoria Glendinning (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1...) to find out more. Of course, reading Leonard's own autobiography might reveal more as well.\n\nWhen I began reading this book I said I was disappointed because the volume doesn't include all of Leonard's letters and ought to be called \"The Selected Letters of Leonard Woolf\". I'm still wanting more. But his letters do reveal much about his character that I didn't really know before. In terms of his relationship with Virginia Woolf, his wife until her suicide in 1941, he's often portrayed as a controlling, rather cold man; reading his letters to Trekkie Parsons seems to me to disprove that image. The letters are so very loving and passionate; it's hard to believe that he didn't behave toward Virginia in the same loving manner. Of course he had to be controlling a bit with Virginia! His monitoring of her mental state, her eating, her weight, and the like probably kept her alive longer than she might have lived had he not been her husband. I feel pity for Leonard, because in his marriage to Virginia he was deprived of physical passion, even of day-to-day affection and cuddles. I may be exaggerating, of course. As Leonard would say, \"I could be wrong about this\".\n\nAll in all it was well worth my time to read through this volume; I only wish there were more!\n\nMarch 2, 2009\n\nThis book took me a little less time to read than most 600 page letter collections usually take me to read, but I believe Leonard gets all the credit for that. He is fabulously readable, altogether human, a sharp wit, and seemingly, a genuinely caring man. I expected none of this when I embarked upon the book. I'd come away from VW's personal writings with a very different idea of what this man must be like. Judging from his letters, he's not the cold, overbearing partner he's usually portrayed as being. I even enjoyed the political letters section of the book, and those would usually be a very tough slog for me. LW is a deeply caring man of many passions, with much integrity, a lively wit, and very loyal and loving. I liked him, and his letters, very much indeed."
