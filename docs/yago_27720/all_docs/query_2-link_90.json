        "text": "By: Jody Tuso-Key\n\nPhoto Credit: Casey G. Ford\n\nATLANTA:\n\n“Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.” —Sir Walter Scott\n\nI’ll admit I’d hadn’t done my homework before going to see this one. I actually thought it was a biopic about Virginia Woolf. Seeing as the movie came out the year I was born and stars Elizabeth Taylor, I’m surprised it’s one I’ve never seen. Nevertheless, I was pleasantly surprised to find this was a story about a professor and his wife who are just about my age. The wife, Martha, happens to be the daughter of the president of a small New England University. Early on in this play I was able to draw parallels to my life. My dad was a university administrator and I grew up on college campuses. To this day it’s where I feel most at home. While I didn’t marry a professor, my husband’s name is George, and so is Martha’s; however, the parallels pretty much stop there.\n\nEdward Albee’s WHO’S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF burst on the scene in 1963 as a raw exploration of marriage and the twisted human spirit. The play exposes the raw underbelly of each character and forced the audience to see the good, bad, and ugly of each human’s nature. It has received a shelf full of awards throughout the years including a Tony award for best play in 1963 and for the revival in 2005. This is a dark comedy about a night of fun and games that reveals a stunning ending. I was frankly glad I hadn’t done my homework on this one. It’s fun to go into a show with no knowledge or expectations. I also won’t give much away in this review as far as the plot is concerned as I want you to have ‘all the feels’.\n\nThe play is set in the 60s, and this appears to be a faculty full of swingers. If they weren’t fictional and still alive today what’s left of them would probably reside at the Villages in Central Florida…but I digress. Meanwhile, it’s 2:30 am and George and Martha have just arrived home from a faculty party, drunk as skunks. Instead of going to bed, Martha has invited over a new faculty member, Nick, and his ‘mousy little type, without any hips, or anything’ wife, Honey. As the folks sitting behind me at the first intermission said, “I don’t undertand who would get home at 2:30 in the morning and then have people over,” but Martha claims, “Daddy says we should be nice them.” I remember my parents having and going to faculty parties that lasted late into the evening. When my dad was at the Air Force Academy, we sponsored Cadets who would stay at the house overnight and faculty members who lived in the neighborhood and came to the house to visit and socialize. University folks are very social, so it wasn’t unusual to me…but I digress again.\n\nBack to the play–what ensues is what one would expect, more drinking, cavorting, and “parlor games” that become an intruiging and in-depth study in character and human nature. George and Martha enjoy an interesting marriage–she wears the ‘pants’ in the relationship, and he hasn’t lived up to either of their expectations as an Associate Professor of the history department. Their relationship is a fiery roller coaster of emotions. She is loud, boisterous, and demanding. He is manipulative and insecure. They share an unusual relationship, and banter back and forth constantly. They also like to role-play. In the end, George, proves to have the upper hand in the relationship as the puppet master of the entire visit–pulling the strings with the games he conjures up which reveal the rawness of each character, including himself.\n\nNow that I have you hooked, before you order your tickets, please be prepared before you go and know this is a 3 hour and 20 minute play with 2 intermissions if 10 minutes each. Then think to yourself, Taylor Swift’s Eras concert movie lasted 3 hours and 30 minutes. If you sat through that and we’re entertained, that’s great, but Who’s Afraid… actually gives you breaks and you will be way more intellectually stimulated by this show. No offense to Taylor–I’m actually watching the Eras Movie as I write this review…but I digress again–for the last time in this review, I promise.\n\nLet’s talk about THIS outstanding production. Upon entering the theater, audience members are greeted by a 1960s living room in all it’s orange and gold splendor and glory. Like a que at an amusement park, Theatrical Outfit always reveals its set for patrons to explore visually prior to the show, and there always and impressive amount to peruse. This set is extremely period accurate, and you’ll feel like you’ve back in time. I’m in the process of moving and furnishing my apartment, and I’d like to know where properties designer and set decorator Caroline Cook found the ottoman and end tables. Of course, Isabel and Moriah Curley-Clay weaved their magic with the scenic design. The wallpaper was my favorite touch, but every aspect of the set was as beautiful of a study of 1963 as the content of the play itself.\n\nDirector Matt Torney is a gift to the ATL from Belfast. He has worked in Ireland, New York, Washington DC, and has been an art director for TV and film. This author is glad that Matt has found the ATL as he assembled a wonderful cast, crew, and vision for the show. In a show like this with a static set, it can be very difficult to block as there are a finite amount of choices a director can make. While the script does give some direction, the blocking can become monotonous if a director lacks creativity, especially in a 3 hour 20 minute production. I can say that I didn’t get bored with the blocking at all. Matt created interesting pictures on stage that felt natural and not contrived.\n\nAs far as the 4 leading players (yes, only 4 carry the whole show), it has been my opinion that Tess Malis Kinkaid is the best actress in Atlanta since I saw her in THE PITTMAN PAINTERS. I was super excited to see her in this iconic role, and she didn’t disappoint. You need to see this show if nothing more than to see this three time Suzi Bass award winner in this outstanding performance. Tess also serves as Theatrical Outfit’s Development director.\n\nSteve Coulter as George is superb. He was previously on the TO stage in EDWARD FOOTE and CRIMES OF THE HEART. If he looks familiar, you mave have seen him in Oppenheimer, Yellowstone, She-Hulk, The Walking Dead, House of Cards, P-Valley, or the final season of Atlanta. Steve’s performance in my opinion reminded me of a mix of Jimmy Stewart and Dana Carvey (or Dana Carvey playing Jimmy Stewart). I hope to see him on stage in Atlanta again in the future.\n\nI very much enjoyed Devon Hales’s performance as Honey. She is cute as a button, and pulled off the sweet and innocent-seeming wife of Nick. While she looks very young, she has a volume of theater and film credits under her belt. I saw her in AS YOU LIKE IT (Georgia Shakespeare), and she is a very versatile actress. She has a natural presence on stage and was an excellent addition to this cast.\n\nFinally, last but not least, Justin Walker delivered a splendid performance as Nick, the good-looking biology professor who is at times reticent and others game for anything, including a romp with Martha. Justin is currently the Producting Creative Director of CityHUNT and also the Producing Artistic Director of the Players Guild at Sugar Hill. With as busy as he must be, we are fortunate he made time to be a part of this cast."
