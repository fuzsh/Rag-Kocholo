        "text": "Here’s a little known secret: one of the best literary travel destinations is just a 1-hour train ride from London! I’m referring, of course, to Monk’s House, Virginia and Leonard Woolf’s country home and where Virginia wrote nearly all of her most famous books and essays.\n\nI am a literary travel writer, meaning I dedicate my time to finding and exploring the best literary destinations, unique indie bookshops, and other best-kept secrets for traveling bookworms. England has no shortage of bucket list destinations for bibliophiles, but Monk’s House is one of my absolute favorites.\n\nVisiting Virginia Woolf’s Sussex home where she lived, wrote, and died, has been on my bucket list for nearly two decades, and I finally had the opportunity to visit recently. It was just as stunning, inspiring, and meaningful as I ever could’ve hoped.\n\nIn this post, I’m going to tell you all about Monk’s House, what you can expect from a visit there, and my tips for visiting, including the easiest way to get there from London. It makes a perfect day trip from London by train when you pair it with my other suggestions to check out in the cute town of Lewes.\n\nSo if you’re a Virginia Woolf fan, read on to get all the details. And don’t forget to pin this post so you can reference it when planning your trip.\n\nWhenever possible, I recommend buying books at local bookshops or throughBookshop.org, because shopping there puts the profits right into the hands of indie bookstores all over the country.\n\nA Quick History of Monk’s House\n\nThe structure of Monk’s House long predates the Woolfs’ residence in the 20th century. The original building was built in the 1600s, though various owners made plenty of modifications and additions since then, including the Woolfs.\n\nLeonard and Virginia bought Monk’s House at auction in 1919 for £700. They had been looking for a new country house in Lewes, and just a month prior had already purchased one — Round House. But once they saw the expansive grounds at Monk’s House, they sold Round House and shifted focus to making Monk’s House their country home.\n\nTo say the house was a fixer upper would be to put it mildly. When they purchased it, Monk’s House had no electricity, no running water, and no gas. It was a drafty, damp old house, but Leonard and Virginia had the vision and the determination to make it their dream country home.\n\nOver the years, they added electricity, water, a modern bathroom, and a telephone. They expanded the kitchen and built an addition for Virginia’s bedroom overlooking the garden. Leonard tended to the neglected land with a passion, transforming it into a garden oasis. Near the orchard, they also built an A-Frame shed that would serve as Virginia’s writing hut.\n\nVirginia and Leonard Woolf kept Monk’s House for their entire lives, living in it when they weren’t in London. While here, they hosted innumerable prominent writers and artists. Lewes even got the nickname of “Bloomsbury-on-Sea” because of how frequently the members of the famous Bloomsbury Group were in Lewes at either Monk’s House or Charleston House nearby.\n\nVirginia wrote the vast majority of her books and essays while at Monk’s House. Leonard wrote that she would venture out to her writing shed with the “regularity of a stockbroker,” and the result was a remarkably prolific writing career, even in spite of serious mental health episodes she famously suffered.\n\nIt was while at Monk’s House in 1941 that Virginia succumbed to one of these episodes. Leaving behind a heartbreaking letter for her husband, Virginia walked to the nearby Ouse River and drowned herself.\n\nLeonard continued to live at Monk’s House until his death in 1969. Not too long after, Monk’s House was sold to the National Trust and preserved as a national literary monument.\n\nRelated: Traveling from London? Don’t miss out on the Sherlock Holmes Museum or the Charles Dickens House while you’re there!\n\nVisiting Monk’s House\n\nVisiting Monk’s House has long been a dream of mine, so when I finally found the opportunity, you’d better believe I took my time and thoroughly enjoyed every minute. If you’re thinking about visiting the country residence of Virginia Woolf, here’s what you can expect.\n\nLet’s start by saying that Monk’s House is one of the best preserved writers’-houses-turned-museums that I’ve ever visited. Because Leonard kept the house until 1969 and the National Trust took it over shortly thereafter, the house is preserved almost exactly as it was when the couple inhabited it.\n\nThat means the furniture, rugs, artwork, knick knacks, essentially everything you see is original and pretty exactly how it was during their lifetimes. That’s pretty amazing, really. So many writers’ houses have to fill in the rooms with furniture that might have been similar to what was there; at Monk’s House, it’s all been preserved (with the exception of Virginia’s book collection, which was sold to an American collector).\n\nVisiting Monk’s House is a truly intimate experience for a reader because of this. It feels as though Virginia herself just stepped outside and could be back any minute. Looking at the rocking chairs, you know that Virginia sat there for countless hours (indeed, when I looked closely at the chair in her bedroom, I could see the darkened spot on the back from where her head rested on countless days).\n\nWalking through Monk’s House one can’t help feeling a palpable connection to Virginia, not just to the writer but to the living, breathing human being she was. Here is where Virginia entertained, here is where Virginia wrote her letters, here is where Virginia slept, here is where Virginia came to rest when experiencing particularly difficult mental health episodes.\n\nThe House Walk Through\n\nAt Monk’s House, you’ll first need to present your ticket for entry in the garage. Then, you’ll enter through the garden gate and then through the attached greenhouse and into the Woolfs’ green-painted sitting room (apparently, this green color was Virginia’s favorite. You’ll see it used throughout the house).\n\nNote: The entrance in the garage is also home to a small secondhand bookshop. Astoundingly, they don’t have any of Virginia Woolf’s books for sale here, and from chatting with the desk worker, it sounds as if there’s no plans to change that. I was disappointed, as collecting books from the houses in which they were wrote is one of my favorite literary travel traditions. I hope that’s something they change in the future!\n\nAs you progress through the rooms on the first floor of the house (the upper floor is not open to visitors), volunteer guides await in each room to tell you about it and answer any questions you might have.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed chatting with each of guides and learning more about the Woolfs’ lives in each room. I also picked their brains about the artwork hanging on the walls (like those painted by Virginia’s sister, Vanessa Bell), and specific pieces of furniture in each room.\n\nAfter the sitting room, you’ll walk through the dining room, kitchen, and then Virginia’s garden-view bedroom, which they added to the original house. Then, you are free to roam the expansive property and gardens of Monk’s House at your leisure.\n\nThe Monk’s House Garden & Writer’s Shed\n\nWhile you won’t have museum guides informing your way in the garden of Monk’s House, you should take your time and thoroughly explore. After all, as Virginia herself said:\n\nLeonard took a neglected space and created a beautiful English garden, including an Italian garden, an orchard, and a vegetable garden. You can see the landscaping and flowers so lovingly developed and tended, including many small ponds with water lilies.\n\nIn the garden, you can also find the final resting place of both Virginia and Leonard. The couple were each cremated after death, and their ashes buried with a pair of intertwined elm trees in the garden. Sadly, both of the original trees are gone now due to storms and Dutch elm disease. But, two lime trees still mark the spot, as do busts of each.\n\nAlso in the garden, take time to look inside the shed, or Virginia’s writing hut. It is an A-frame structure the couple added to the property in 1934. Virginia would walk out here each day to write, inspired by its setting in the garden and its view over the South Downs.\n\nInside the writer’s hut, you can read some informative plaques and see pictures of the Woolfs and their many famous visitors at Monk’s House. The room in which Virginia wrote is not open to walk into, but you can gaze in on it through the windows.\n\nHow to Visit Virginia Woolf’s House in Sussex\n\nMonk’s House is only open seasonally (which is why despite my numerous trips to the UK I hadn’t been able to visit until now). It’s typically open from April through October, and only on Thursdays through Saturdays.\n\nAdvanced booking is required, to prevent overcrowding of the small house. Tickets are released on Thursdays for the following two weeks, and you can get your ticket up until 8 am on the day of your arrival (if it has not been sold out).\n\nEntry in 2024 costs £9.50 for adults and £4.75 for kids, with discounts for families. National Trust members get free entry.\n\nTickets are for a timed entry, though you can take as much time in the house and gardens as you like. I’d recommend allowing for a minimum of an hour here and up to two hours for avid fans or people who want to spend time relaxing in the garden.\n\nHow to get there\n\nGetting to Virginia Woolf’s Monk’s House is pretty straightforward using either car or public transportation.\n\nFrom London, you can take a 1-hour train from Victoria Station to Lewes. (I recommend giving yourself some time to explore Lewes as well, because there’s lots for book lovers to do in downtown Lewes, including some great Lewes bookstores).\n\nTo get to Monk’s House, you’ll then need to catch a bus to Rodmell Mill Lane (the bus runs about once an hour most days), and then walk another 5-10 minutes to get to Monk’s House.\n\nAlternatively, you can take the train to Southease Station and walk the pleasant 1.5 miles along the River Ouse to Monk’s House.\n\nI recommend checking the train schedules on Omio, which I find to be a really thorough and reliable way to find train timetables while traveling in Europe.\n\nIf you’re arriving by car, expect a 1.5 hour drive from London. There is a small car park available about 100 meters past the Monk’s House entrance, where you should be able to find a spot.\n\nAddress: Rodmell, Lewes, East Sussex, BN7 3HF\n\nMake a Day of It\n\nA visit to Monk’s House is not likely to fill an entire day for most visitors, but there’s plenty more you can do in the area to make a full day trip out of your time here.\n\nI recommend spending some time in Lewes. It’s a great place to shop for books, antiques, and clothes, and find some great food choices. Plus, you can see the home that Leonard and Virginia purchased before finding Monk’s House as well as the former home of Thomas Paine.\n\nYou can check out my complete guide for how to spend a day in Lewes to help plan your time.\n\nFor Virginia Woolf fans, I also recommend allowing yourself some time to walk along the River Ouse. Woolf was a huge walker — she thought through her books while walking and then would return and write down what she’d begun in her head on her walk.\n\nOne of her favorite walking places was along the River Ouse, so she could look out on the South Downs. On a sadder note, this is also the river in which she drowned herself in 1941.\n\nDuring my visit, I used this map to chart a walk along the River down to Southese before circling back around. I found it to be both inspiring and somber to walk in her steps along the river, imagining her both in happy times of inspiration and productivity and in sad times in the final hours of her life.\n\nAltogether, I think this is an oft missed opportunity to pay tribute to an incredible writer.\n\nTip: The path is often overgrown and muddy, so if you plan to complete this walk, I’d wear appropriate footwear, head covering from sun, and long pants or just be ready to get your legs a bit scratched up and perhaps itchy from some stinging nettle.\n\nYou can also check out the extensive research this blogger has done about Virginia Woolf’s walking routes in Lewes and the surrounding area.\n\nHopefully this has equipped you with everything you need to know to plan a day trip to Monk’s House from London and pay tribute to Virginia Woolf, one of Britain’s best writers.\n\nDon’t forget to pin this post for future reference and to sign up for my newsletter so you never miss out on a literary travel destination again!"
