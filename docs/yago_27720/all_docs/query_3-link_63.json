        "text": "The MLA International Bibliography (MLAIB) indexes the broadest range of resources about literature in all languages. If a literary study of your novel or work exists, you will likely find it here. Not everything in the MLA Bibliography is full-text, meaning that you may only see a description of an article, rather than the text of the article. To get full text of an article, click on “Find article @ UVa Libraries”, or look up the journal title in Virgo, the library catalog. If the citation is for a book or an essay/chapter in a book, look for the book title in Virgo.\n\nProQuest One Literature contains 3 million literature citations from thousands of journals, monographs, and dissertations. It also includes more than 500,000 primary works – including rare and obscure texts, multiple versions, and non-traditional sources like comics, theatre performances, and author readings.\n\nJSTOR includes older issues of scholarly journals, from their beginnings to 3-5 years ago, so this may be another good database to look for articles related to your novel or work. Articles in JSTOR should be full-text, if we subscribe to the journal.\n\nProject MUSE includes searchable full text of nearly 600 scholarly journals in the humanities, social sciences, and more, mostly from North American university presses.\n\nVirgo is UVA Library's catalog. Search Virgo for scholarship about Woolf and her works. Use subject headings to help you find resources that meet your research needs. You can use a general subject to get started, like: Woolf, Virginia -- 1882-1941 -- Criticism and interpretation or Woolf, Virginia -- 1882-1941 -- To the lighthouse (substitute titles of other works to look for criticism on those).\n\nYou can also run an advanced search and pair a search for Woolf with a search for subjects that relate to themes/topics of interest. For example, you might search for a keyword of Woolf and a subject of: Subconsciousness in literature or Realism in literature or World War (1914-1918).\n\nOnce you find a book that includes a subject heading that relates to your topic of interest, click on the subject heading in the item record to find other items marked with that subject.\n\nBelow are a few examples of print books and ebooks that critically examine Woolf and her works.\n\nThe Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (ODNB) provides entries on the lives of British persons from the earliest times to the end of the 20th century. IMPORTANT: our access is limited so please click the Sign Out link at the bottom of the page and close the window when you are finished.\n\nOrlando: Women's Writing in the British Isles provides entries on authors' lives and writing careers, contextual material, timelines, sets of internal links, and bibliographies. Interacting with these materials creates a dynamic inquiry from any number of perspectives into centuries of women's writing.\n\nLiterature Resource Center (LRC) includes the full text of important literary reference works. Among them are articles from the Dictionary of Literary Biography, which is a terrific source for finding detailed biographies and profiles of authors, illustrators, publishers, and other literary figures. Run a search for a person's name and then choose the Biographies tab, if there are articles available (though other articles - critical or otherwise -- could be useful, too!)\n\nThere are also many book-length works on Woolf and her friends, family, and associates. Find them using a Virgo catalog search. A few examples:"
