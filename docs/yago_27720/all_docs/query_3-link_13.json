        "text": "After meeting Leonard Woolf for the first time, in 1911, the poet Rupert Brooke asked of him, “Was Woolf, who seems very nice, ever more than minor?” Brutal though this seems, it may reflect the consensus over time: he remains a figure best known for those to whom he was attached — his wife Virginia, of course, but also his close friends in the Bloomsbury set, including Lytton Strachey, John Maynard Keynes and Clive Bell.\n\nAs Victoria Glendinning makes clear in her comprehensive and eminently readable biography, it is an assessment born of ignorance of his varied accomplishments — perhaps, indeed, born of the fact that his accomplishments were so varied — and of the quiet complexity of his character, which was at once passionate, reserved and, above all, stoical. Considered chiefly in relation to his wife, whose dramatic persona, literary genius and recurring mental illness have commanded such attention, he has been alternately hailed as the ideal feminist helpmeet and nursemaid, and excoriated as the controlling, repressive force that smothered her. Neither, and both, are probably somewhat true; but in so long and fulfilled a life (Leonard died at the age of 88, in 1969, outliving Virginia by 28 years), they are by no means the sum of the man.\n\nBorn in November 1880, to Marie de Jongh and Sidney Woolf, Leonard was the third of nine siblings (a 10th child died in infancy). The family was solidly bourgeois, Jewish but not religious, and even after Sidney Woolf’s early death, when Leonard was just 11, managed to live in relative comfort. Leonard was educated at St. Paul’s School and Trinity College, Cambridge. Given even in his early years to “a strong sense of evil, and black epiphanies,” as Glendinning puts it, he developed what he referred to as his “carapace,” a means of detaching from the world around him. According to Glendinning, “he could not, would not ... make any link between the construction of his carapace and the reason why he needed one — his Jewishness. Once you have an effective carapace, nothing matters and, just as importantly, nothing must ever, ever, be seen to matter.” In youth, Leonard Woolf adopted “Nothing matters” as his mantra, and gave that advice throughout his life to all who inquired. Only toward the end did he concede that “Nothing matters, and everything matters.”\n\nHe never dwelled upon the anti-Semitism of the English culture of his times, but it set him as an outsider even among his intimates. Slight, somewhat austere in appearance, afflicted by a life-long tremor, he was referred to by his future wife, when announcing their engagement, as “a penniless Jew.” Whether because he was Jewish, unglamorous, or simply a man, when first he proposed to Virginia, early in 1912, she took to her bed and refused to see him while she thought things over. It was hardly the open-armed embrace of which he might have fantasized.\n\nAt Cambridge, Woolf moved in a set of friends, many of whom would form the core of the Bloomsbury group. Chief among them was Lytton Strachey, but Woolf was also close to Saxon Sydney-Turner, Thoby Stephen (Virginia’s brother, who would die young of typhoid), Maynard Keynes, E. M. Forster and Clive Bell. They all had nicknames (not necessarily generous ones): Forster was “the Taupe,” because of his resemblance to a mole, and Leonard was “the Rabbi.” Elected, while at Cambridge, to the august conversational society the Apostles, Woolf there befriended Bertrand Russell, the philosopher G. E. Moore, and the journalist Desmond MacCarthy, among others — the intellectual elite of their generation. But Leonard differed from his cohort, Glendinning writes, in that “he saw it as an imperative ... for intellectuals to take part in what Forster in ‘Howards End’ was to call ‘the world of telegrams and anger’ and in public life.’ ”\n\nUnlike many of his peers, too, the “penniless Jew” was forced to earn his living, and to this end took a posting with the colonial civil service in Ceylon. From 1904 to 1911, he proved an effective and punctilious colonial administrator, whose faltering “faith in the imperial project” eventually prompted his resignation. That, and his consuming passion for Thoby Stephen’s younger sister. While in Ceylon, he lost his virginity to a prostitute and formed a number of romantic attachments, none of them serious. With Virginia, Leonard “fell terminally and unconditionally in love,” with her “looks, her manner, her mind, the way she talked and moved.” Capable of great physical desire, he was forced to pursue a different sort of intimacy: Glendinning, like others before her, concludes that their marriage was never fully consummated.\n\nThe union was, in its way, deeply fulfilling. Their correspondence reveals not only mutual dependence but great tenderness, concern and love. As Virginia noted in her diary, in October, 1937: “Love-making — after 25 years can’t bear to be separate ... you see it is enormous pleasure being wanted: a wife. And our marriage so complete.” Nevertheless, simply in noting the duration and nature of each of Virginia’s episodes of mental illness, Glendinning conveys the immense burden that fell upon Leonard. It has been said that the struggle in any marriage is over who gets to be crazy; in their case, the answer was never in doubt. Leonard tended his wife, the literary press they founded together, their garden and the household: ever the punctilious administrator, he kept precise records of everything, including the clothes they bought.\n\nWhat is most remarkable, perhaps, about their marriage, was its extraordinary productivity. Glendinning’s biography has at times a whirlwind quality, in part because Leonard Woolf was simply doing so much: not only did he and his wife found and run the Hogarth Press (which published Virginia’s novels, and the work of Vita Sackville-West, T. S. Eliot and others); not only did he write stories and novels (including “The Village in the Jungle,” about Ceylon) and books of political and cultural criticism; not only was he an editor at several journals, including The International Review, The Nation, and The Political Quarterly, as well as a director of The New Statesman; but he was also directly involved in politics, in the colonial question, and in the Labor Party movement (he ran, unsuccessfully, for Parliament, in 1922). As he wrote in the penultimate volume of his memoirs, “Downhill All the Way”: “Neither of us ever took a day’s holiday unless we were too ill to work or unless we went away on a regular and, as it were, authorized holiday. ... It is surprising how much one can produce in a year, whether of buns or books or pots or pictures, if one works hard and professionally for three and a half hours every day for 330 days.”\n\nAfter Virginia’s suicide, Leonard did not stop. Bolstered in his later years by a 25-year romantic alliance with a younger woman named Trekkie Parsons (the wife of Ian Parsons, of the publishing house Chatto & Windus, to whom Leonard eventually entrusted the Hogarth Press), he traveled, wrote his voluminous memoirs, spoke and gardened with undimmed energy until his death at 88. He handled his wife’s legacy with unflagging commitment, answering all queries and requests, and overseeing the posthumous publication of many of her papers. He outlived most of his friends, but made new ones, like the actress Peggy Ashcroft, and remained close to those who survived until the very end."
