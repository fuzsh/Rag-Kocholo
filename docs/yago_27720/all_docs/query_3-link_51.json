        "text": "“Looking back at the age of eighty-eight over the fifty-seven years of my political work in England, knowing what I aimed at and the results, meditating on the history of Britain and the world since 1914, I see clearly that I achieved practically nothing,” Leonard Woolf wrote in the last of the five volumes of his autobiography. “I must have in a long life ground through between 150,000 and 200,000 hours of perfectly useless work.” He was respected for his articles and parliamentary briefs, but his books on political history, in particular the long-labored-over volumes of “After the Deluge,” dropped into obscurity. His wife, in her diary, sometimes wondered whether he gave in too thoroughly to his sense of failure. “Oh but I have been made miserable—damped & disheartened—this is no exaggeration—because the Lit Sup. only gave half a column of belittlement to After the Deluge,” Virginia Woolf recorded in October of 1931. “L. says—& honestly believes—that this puts an end to the book. . . . He says his ten years work are wasted, & that he sees no use in going on.”\n\n“After the Deluge” was meant to be a major work of “scientific history” that would have the stature of the books Leonard Woolf’s friends had written. By 1931, Lytton Strachey had published “Eminent Victorians” and “Queen Victoria,” John Maynard Keynes “The Economic Consequences of the Peace,” Roger Fry “Vision and Design,” Edward Morgan Forster “Howards End” and (with Leonard Woolf’s years of careful encouragement) “A Passage to India,” and Virginia Woolf, for whom her husband was bulwark and first reader, seven novels, including “To the Lighthouse” and, in 1931, “The Waves,” which was reviewed that same “damped & disheartened” day. Her diary entry concludes, “And when I say this morning incautiously, ‘I’m reviewed in the M[anchester] Guardian’ L. says ‘Is it a long review?’ And I say, feeling like a mother to a hurt & miserable little boy, Yes. Lord what human beings are!”\n\nBoth Woolfs were in the perpetual business of writing, editing, publishing, and reviewing books. At the Hogarth Press, which for many years occupied the larder in their basement, they printed not only “After the Deluge” and “The Waves” but T. S. Eliot’s “The Waste Land” and Katherine Mansfield’s “Prelude”; they helped translate works of Gorky and Dostoyevsky, and became Sigmund Freud’s publishers in England. Leonard Woolf was also the literary editor of The Nation and, for twenty-seven years, co-editor of The Political Quarterly, and he counted among his contributors H. G. Wells, Thomas Hardy, Isaiah Berlin, and Rebecca West. Never was a man more occluded by masterpieces. There is thus a mystery and a peculiar satisfaction surrounding the fact that Woolf, at nearly eighty, began to publish an autobiography that was immediately hailed by reviewers, won an important literary prize, and, in the almost half century since the first volume appeared, has seldom been out of print.\n\n“Sufficient for the morning is the pleasure thereof,” Woolf said in the last volume, “and one of the most unfailing pleasures is to sit down in the morning and write.” Discovering the writing life of Leonard Woolf has always been a project for the assiduous; even the forthright autobiography takes refuge behind that shell of privacy which he referred to as his “carapace.” In 1989, Frederic Spotts edited an admirable and substantial selection of Woolf’s correspondence, and there has been a quickening of interest in recent years: Woolf’s first novel, “The Village in the Jungle,” was reissued in 2005; three long out-of-print stories have just been published by the Hesperus Press, under the title “A Tale Told by Moonlight”; and now Victoria Glendinning’s “Leonard Woolf” (Free Press; $30), the first full-length biography, brings us a thoroughly researched and elucidating account. Through the ages of Woolf’s life—the childhood among impoverished middle-class Jews (the family fortunes diminished when Woolf was eleven and his barrister father died); an adolescence reading classics at St. Paul’s on scholarship; intellectual emergence at Cambridge; seven difficult and transformative years in Ceylon as a colonial administrator; and nearly six decades of editing, marriage, war, and labor politics—one sees the flickering aspirations of Leonard Woolf the writer, which, though often invisible to others, remained, to him, a central fact of his existence.\n\nHe was an austere man, with a strong temper and a thin face, whose clothes fit him loosely; reserved, even shy, in many social situations, he would also take his pipe from his mouth and become, unpredictably, declamatory; he was idealistic about the possibilities of human society, but often preferred the company of animals; his hands had an inherited tremor that sometimes embarrassed him; he had a quality of leading at the same time that he had a quality of holding himself aside. One of the girls in “The Waves” says, “We must form into pairs . . . and walk in order . . . with Louis going first to lead us, because Louis is alert and not a wool-gatherer.” A big family is a kind of small village, and, although Leonard Woolf rebelled against the constraints of being the third of nine children in a loud, fatherless brood, he placed himself in communities of similar dimensions again and again.\n\n“At the beginning of the day Mrs. Woolf had a bad head ack. Sad disappointment in the Woolfs den” ran the day’s story for August 4, 1889, in The Leonard Paper, edited by the eight-year-old Woolf. Such details are part of the valuable documentation that Glendinning has unearthed from these early years, about which Woolf’s own account is hurried and incomplete. She rightly emphasizes what Woolf was long reluctant to say: that his Jewishness alienated him once he began school and that, in the at best casually anti-Semitic world of the British intelligentsia, it affected all his relations. (Occasionally, she can be haphazard in what she attributes to Woolf’s ancestry: in his preference for having his eggs and bacon cooked in separate pans, she finds “a residue, perhaps, of his Jewish upbringing.”) But some measure of alienation was, by Woolf’s own reckoning, simply the lot of the intellectual. “We were not merely obviously much too clever,” Woolf wrote of his college friends. “We were arrogant, supercilious, cynical, sarcastic, and Lytton always looked very queer and had a squeaky voice.”\n\nStrachey—possessed, Woolf observed, of “that indefinable quality which tends to excite animosity or ridicule at sight in the ordinary man, the Cambridge ‘blood’ or tough”—was Woolf’s closest friend at college, and Woolf became a sort of eleventh sibling in the uproarious, “passionately intellectual” Strachey household. The two were members of Cambridge’s semi-secret society the Apostles, along with their friends Keynes and Forster and the philosopher, seven years Woolf’s senior, whose mind gave the whole society its cast: G. E. Moore. They felt themselves to be Greek and free. Even six decades later, Woolf compared Moore to Socrates, and at Cambridge he happily began to replace his private, protective creed, “Nothing matters,” with G. E. Moore’s characteristic question: “What exactly do you mean by . . . ?” Keynes described their gatherings this way: “Moore himself was a puritan and precisian, Strachey . . . a Voltairean, Woolf a rabbi, myself a nonconformist . . . Clive [Bell] a gay and amiable dog . . . Forster . . . the elusive colt of a dark horse.”\n\nThe role of the rabbi seems to have combined a personal sense of history, a strong moral force, and the willingness to be a confidant. “All men confide in Leonard,” Virginia Woolf wrote in a letter in 1925, “especially such as love their own sex.” She first heard of Leonard from her adored older brother, Thoby Stephen, who was not an Apostle but was an important figure in their college set, called “the Goth” for his stature and presence. Like the Stracheys, the Stephens made an indelible impression on young Leonard Woolf. He was introduced to and terrified of the great man of letters Sir Leslie Stephen, who “in old age was much given to groaning audibly,” and he never forgot meeting the beautiful sisters Virginia and Vanessa, who were “just as formidable and alarming as their father.” He wrote, “Suddenly seeing them one stopped astonished and everything including one’s breathing for one second also stopped as it does when in a picture gallery you suddenly come face to face with a great Rembrandt or Velasquez.”\n\nTheir Cambridge set, with the addition of Roger Fry and a few spouses and relations, was Bloomsbury. Leonard Woolf was its only member whose family was not part of the very close-knit English intellectual class—just a few related families, prosperous and ever confident—of which he wrote, “I know that I am ambivalent to aristocratic societies, disliking and despising them and at the same time envying them their insolent urbanity.” In his ambivalence, he was perfect for the group; he could express its self-admiration and its self-criticism and could embody the new world arriving on its doorstep. His attachment was fierce (none of his friends, as Glendinning observes, wrote as much about the Apostles as he did), but at college the effect on his writing was not salutary: his letters ramble among private jokes, his poetry is sentimental, his competition paper did not win a prize. It wasn’t the way of his set to study particularly hard, but for Woolf mediocre exam results had the most serious consequences, since he alone would have to work for a living and support his family. After graduating, in 1903, he caught one last performance of the Beethoven C-Minor Symphony, which was the sort of music the Apostles classed as “supreme,” packed up ninety volumes of Voltaire (a way of bringing Strachey along), and, now a cadet in the Civil Service, sailed for Ceylon.\n\nIn the next seven years, Woolf learned Tamil and Sinhalese, oversaw the pearl-fishing season, supervised the salt harvest brought in on the backs of buffalo, and shot the buffalo when they contracted rinderpest. He was promoted to Assistant Government Agent at Hambantota, kept a pet leopard, and, listening to the stories of village life he heard as a judge, became, as he later wrote, “completely immersed, not only in my work, but in the life of the people.”\n\nThough he deplored how little he was writing and reading in Ceylon, it was there that his prose gained its distinctive specificity of observation, and the tone of the experienced, thoughtful older brother that people found bracing and reassuring in his conversation. He kept a meticulous, unflattering official diary, which his higher-ups criticized, and which the Sri Lankan government published after independence as an accurate portrayal of colonial life. He also wrote Strachey intense, descriptive letters, which he quoted and refashioned in his later work. In a passage about the pearl fishery (from the second volume of his autobiography, “Growing”), which Glendinning says is “among the best sustained set-pieces he wrote,” Woolf describes the death of an Arab fisherman, the grief of the man’s brother, and the dignity of the sheikh in charge of the boat, who speaks in mourning:\n\nI didn’t understand Arabic, but I could understand what he was saying. The dead man had lived, had worked, had died. He had died working, without suffering, as men should desire to die. . . . I heard continually the word Khallas—all is finished. I watched the figures outlined against the grey sky—the long lean outline of the corpse with the toes sticking up so straight and stark, the crouching huddled figure of the weeping man, and the tall upright sheik standing by his side. They were motionless, sombre, mysterious, part of the grey sea, of the grey sky.\n\nThese figures stand in contrast to others less impressive, such as Jaffna’s assistant superintendent of police, who used to drive Woolf around and give a running monologue: “I didn’t ask for much, a little house in an English shire, with plenty of hunting and six or seven horses and enough money to run up to London for a week when the frost comes—Get out, you ugly stinking fucking son of a black buggered bitch; you black bugger you—I don’t ask for much, I’d be as happy as a king—you greasy fat Jaffna harlot, get out of the light, you black swine—and I don’t get it.”\n\nWoolf grew increasingly disgusted by his imperial position, and, when a leave of absence in England approached, he wasn’t sure whether he would resign and write novels or return to permanent involvement with the inhabitants of the Sri Lankan jungle. But it was clear that his emotional life was still bound up with the Apostles. Thoby Stephen had died from typhoid in 1906, and since then the Cambridge friends and the two Stephen sisters had drawn instinctively together, as in “The Waves” the death of Percival binds the six other characters. Two days after Thoby’s death, Vanessa Stephen, to Leonard Woolf’s envy and disappointment, accepted Clive Bell’s proposal of marriage. In 1909, Lytton Strachey proposed to Virginia Stephen. “As I did it, I saw that it would be death if she accepted me,” he wrote to Woolf, and he promptly initiated a new campaign: “I think there’s no doubt whatever that you ought to marry her.” Woolf replied from Ceylon, “Life would probably be supreme,” but, he added anxiously, “the ghastly complications too of virginity and marriage altogether appal me.” Forster, at work on “Howards End” during these years, considered a transformed version of the situation: his attractive, parentless Schlegel sisters and their ailing brother Tibby impetuously take up poor but aspiring Leonard Bast after a performance of Beethoven’s C-Minor Symphony. Forster was more worried about his fictional Leonard than the Stephens and Stracheys were about the real one. Vanessa Bell thought Woolf the very man for her sister. “If I were you,” Strachey urged him, “I should telegraph.”\n\nIn 1911, Leonard Woolf returned to London. Although the city had exchanged the cart horse for the automobile and the piano for the radio, he was able to pick up where he had left off, beginning again his long talks with “the Strache,” and running over to dinner with the Bells. The group was at its most involuted: Strachey and Keynes were both sleeping with Duncan Grant, who had not yet started sleeping with Vanessa Bell, who had two children and was painting seriously and sleeping with Roger Fry. “I lived a life of pleasure, just unmitigated, pure, often acute pleasure, such as I had never had before and have never had again,” Woolf wrote of those months. “In October I began writing ‘The Village in the Jungle’ and I realized that I was falling in love with Virginia.” It wasn’t a simple courtship, and the refraction in Virginia Woolf’s “Night and Day” (1919) is suggestive. The book’s two lovers have what they call “lapses”: his come when she “looked more beautiful, or more strange . . . or said something unexpected,” and his “sense of her romance welled up and overcame him.” It was important to him that she be a remote ideal, and he would say vehemently that “he only loved her shadow and cared nothing for her reality.” Her lapses “took the form of gradual detachment until she became completely absorbed in her own thoughts.”\n\nIn “Beginning Again,” the third volume of his memoirs, Woolf wrote, “Virginia is the only person whom I have known intimately who had the quality which one had to call genius.” When she was talking, “she might suddenly ‘leave the ground’ and give some fantastic, entrancing, amusing, dreamlike, almost lyrical description of an event, a place, or a person.” She was “a very beautiful woman” and yet, he wrote, it often happened that “the crowd in the street . . . would go into fits of laughter at the sight of Virginia.” G. E. Moore, Morgan Forster, and his wife had a quality that he associated with certain characters in Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky: that of the inspired “silly,” who has the purity and absurdity of the holy fool. “He likes ‘Sillies,’ ” Virginia wrote in her diary. “He likes the dependent simplicity of Morgan & myself. He likes settling our minds, & our immense relief at this.” After his proposal, she was ill for a while and could not see him, but six months later, certain of her love (but not yet certain of how to spell his name), she announced to a friend, “I’ve got a confession to make. I’m going to marry Leonard Wolf. He’s a penniless Jew. I’m more happy than anyone ever said was possible.”\n\nThey were married in August of 1912, and the following year he published “The Village in the Jungle,” an engrossing and stark portrait of a tiny Sinhalese compound, and of how a family and the village are destroyed. Glendinning situates the book among other British accounts of the East, like Orwell’s “Burmese Days” and Forster’s “A Passage to India,” but the central story is probably closer to home. It concerns a father, Silindu, his two unusually beautiful daughters, and his attempts to ward off encroaching and lustful suitors. Silindu, a hunter and village eccentric, teaches his two daughters the ways of the jungle. One, the more domestic, marries early; the other, wilder, is forced into marriage but refuses to live with her scarred and lecherous husband and is tormented by the villagers until she dies.\n\n“The Village in the Jungle,” with its double allegiance to Ceylon and the Stephens, is more tense and successful than Woolf’s second novel, “The Wise Virgins” (1914), generally read as a roman à clef (the beautiful sisters are in this case Camilla and Katherine, and the frustrated lover is Harry), in which human society—corrupt, conventional, and punitive—is opposed to a wilder, truer life of art and intellect that Harry, again, fails to attain. Camilla and Harry are both meant to be painters, and one day, when he is supposedly painting her, she begins to talk to him, imagining the lives of people they know. She pauses, rousing “a curious excitement of mind rather than of body in him,” and he says, “Go on, go on. God! I wish I could paint.”\n\nIf you were a competitive person who wanted to write novels, there can have been few greater challenges than being married to Virginia Woolf, whose first novel, “The Voyage Out,” was published a year later, in 1915. Woolf’s family and Bloomsbury were to varying degrees irritated and offended by his second novel, and he could see from what Strachey and Forster wrote to him and to his wife that his own fiction was comparatively lacking. “I shall never write another book after these damned Virgins,” he wrote to Strachey, though he may just have been growing more interested in a different kind of book. In her “Night and Day,” Ralph, the character who helps us to imagine Leonard, wants to find a little cottage and write “the history of the English village from Saxon days to the present time.” Leonard Woolf loved rural England, and his married life always included a more or less ramshackle house in the country, where he would become so horticultural that, Glendinning tells us, “he had to make an agreement with Virginia to take regular afternoon walks with her, twice a week on set days, otherwise he would never have left the garden.” He wrote that once, when she was listening to Hitler on the radio, she called to him to come inside: “I shouted back: ‘I shan’t come. I’m planting iris and they will be flowering long after he is dead.’ ”\n\nThese country retreats were established as respite from the overstimulations of London literary life after Virginia Woolf had two severe breakdowns, one in 1913, during which she attempted suicide, and another in 1915. “Leonard’s diary,” Glendinning writes of the former episode, “is a catalogue of bad nights and better nights, of numbingly painful scenes, of Virginia physically attacking the nurses, of excruciating ‘difficulty,’ of her agitation and unpredictability.” Woolf himself describes beautifully and perceptively his wife’s illness and the role of caretaker that he occupied on and off throughout their marriage; some believe that her novels would not have been written without him. By and large, his somewhat compulsive tendency to regulate and keep track—he noted his mileage every day, recorded how much they spent on every item of clothing, made long lists of gardening seeds to purchase, entered into Sebastopolian campaigns of protest letters—was steadying for Virginia Woolf, though sometimes it has a quality both touching and absurd. When she had an affair of some four years with Vita Sackville-West (who is the subject of a previous biography of Glendinning’s), he expressed no overt jealousy, but on one occasion wrote his wife’s lover an admonishing note: “It has been proved over & over again in the last 10 years that even 2 late nights running are definitely dangerous for her & this time it was 7 or 8.”\n\nThis horizonless attention to Virginia Woolf’s stability was also part of the motivation for starting the Hogarth Press—they both thought it would be good for her to have something pleasant and manual and bookish to do when she couldn’t be writing—and, although much of the time-consuming work fell to Leonard, publishing was one of his greatest satisfactions and the years when the Hogarth Press was flourishing were some of their happiest. “Nineteen years,” she wrote in her diary, “how moving to find this warmth, curiousity, attachment in being alone with L.” These were the years when their familiar set gathered in the evenings for what they called the Memoir Club, for which he wrote many of what later became the best sections of his autobiography, and where he was, nevertheless, outshone by his wife and Maynard Keynes. These were also years of steady work and accomplishment, though he still joked to Strachey about his inadequacies: “Having failed as (a) a civil servant, (b) a novelist, (c) an editor, (d) a publicist, I have now sunk to the last rung . . . journalism.”\n\nThere was much that Woolf liked in the political work he began in 1913, embarking on those two hundred thousand hours of going to committee meetings, giving speeches, and working with feminists, labor activists, anti-imperialists, and pacifists. In the war, his brother Cecil was killed in the trenches by a shell that also injured his brother Philip, and, as was true for many, politics gained new urgency. His first political project was to undertake a research effort for Beatrice and Sidney Webb (the Fabians who later founded the London School of Economics) which became the influential book “International Government” (1916), read attentively by those responsible for the League of Nations. It was followed by “Empire and Commerce in Africa: A Study in Economic Imperialism” (1920).\n\nThe merits of these practical books were more immediately evident to his compatriots than were those of his three volumes of political history, which took ten, eight, and fourteen years to complete, respectively, and in which, as Glendinning says, he felt obliged to start “so far back in time that by the time he reached the present, and the policies which he passionately wished to promote, reader-fatigue had set in.” This was in part due to a struggle with Apostolic expectations; his friends were constantly telling their rabbi how he ought to write. He self-consciously tried to apply the lessons of G. E. Moore’s “Principia Ethica” to history; he bore in mind that Lytton Strachey liked best the style of “Empire and Commerce in Africa” (“Those final pages on Uganda really remind one of Swift and Voltaire”); Maynard Keynes told him that the first two volumes of “After the Deluge” should have been called “Principia Politica,” so he used the title for the third volume. Glendinning herself can’t resist lecturing Leonard Woolf, asserting that had he pursued his idea of “a revised version of the Wandering Jew . . . it might have been his masterpiece.” In “The Waves,” Virginia Woolf expressed the group’s collective understanding: “Louis, now so opulent, goes to his attic window among the blistered roofs and gazes where she has vanished, but must sit down in his office among the typewriters and the telephone and work it all out for our instruction, for our regeneration, and the reform of an unborn world.”\n\nBy 1931, they were both more than a little worried about the unborn world; the fourth volume of Woolf’s autobiography, “Downhill All the Way,” chronicles the decline of many hopes. In it he tells a darkly comic story of accidentally driving into a German military parade in 1935 and having the crowds give a Heil salute to the marmoset on his shoulder. Several of their friends kept poison to swallow if the Germans should succeed in invading England; bombers flew over their house in Rodmell. In early 1941, when Virginia Woolf was finishing “Between the Acts,” she became, once again, seriously unwell, and, in March, she killed herself. “It is no good trying to delude oneself that one can escape the consequences of a great catastrophe,” Woolf wrote. “Virginia’s suicide and the horrible days which followed between her disappearance and the inquest had the effect of a blow both upon the head and the heart.” Some of his friends, he said, thought he should leave Rodmell for a time, but he “had nowhere to stay in London.”\n\nAt the end of 1942, Trekkie Parsons—a painter and an amateur botanist, cheerful, practical, and known as a delightful hostess—began visiting him at Monks House, Rodmell. She was married to Ian Parsons, the editor and publisher of Chatto & Windus, which eventually became a sort of partner and home for the Hogarth Press, and she divided her weeks between the two men for the next three decades. Children did not laugh at her in the street. She had neither “flights” nor “lapses,” but he did not need her to. For Woolf, the living and the dead were continuously present in Rodmell. He was clerk to the Parish Council, and a large donor to the Village Hall; children knew that they would be scolded for stealing his apples but counted on Mr. Woolf to bring trays of fruit to the school every fall. One summer, he won all seven first prizes for vegetables at the Horticultural Show. Trekkie Parsons slept in Virginia Woolf’s bedroom and worked in her studio; he wrote new love letters using the old phrases, while he edited for publication an important source for his own recollections, Virginia Woolf’s diaries.\n\nWhat Leonard Woolf really liked, he had said in an essay in 1927, was “diaries and letters and memoirs,” in which “one gets the most vivid and important vision of a pageant of history.” His own history books come alive when they are anecdotal and digressive and at their least systematic—when “they pulled Lord North out of his barouche,” or when, in “Principia Politica” (1953), he describes his own typically bourgeois household of the eighteen-nineties. Friends and reviewers said of that book’s long discussion of Hitler, Stalin, and authoritarianism that what they liked best was the passage about his methods of training animals. After nearly thirty years of trying to enforce reason on the chaos of history, Woolf threw it over, and began to write his autobiography. “I write this looking out of a window upon a garden in Sussex,” he said on one of the first pages. “I feel that my roots are here and in the Greece of Herodotus.”\n\nVictoria Glendinning says gently that in this part of his writing life Woolf was “released,” and her book describes his later years with clear-sighted sympathy. Release was inseparable from loss: Lytton Strachey had died in 1932, Roger Fry in 1934, Virginia Woolf in 1941, Maynard Keynes in 1946, and G. E. Moore in 1958. Two years later, left in his garden with his ideal now at the distance of memory, Woolf published the first volume of his autobiography. Rodmell offered the continuity of the Saxon village and of all his villages—Cambridge, Hambantota, Bloomsbury—and it was there that he wrote his best books.\n\nWhen we read the autobiography now, the village parade is a gorgeous panoply: Strachey “in a tangle of his own arms and legs,” and Virginia Woolf playing bowls in the garden, the indefatigable Sidney and Beatrice Webb, the jungle, the fishermen, the labors of the Hogarth Press, the different desolations of the two wars, here the struggle, there the failure, here again the unusual triumph. “What a life he has led,” exulted Morgan Forster, who himself lived past ninety, “and how he has led it!” When he was still at work on “After the Deluge,” Leonard Woolf suggested that “even a failure might bring some small ray of light or grain of knowledge,” but it was on the last page of the last volume of his memoirs that he could say with sincerity, “There are other assets of old age. The storms and stresses of life, the ambitions and competitions, are over. The futile and unnecessary and false responsibilities have fallen from one’s shoulders and one’s conscience.” It took eighty-eight years, but Leonard Woolf was at last a writer who had done what he could for history. ♦"
