        "text": "The laid in Insert Papers collection from the personal library of Leonard and Virginia Woolf consists of manuscripts, letters, and miscellaneous material that, for a variety of reasons, were placed by Leonard and Virginia Woolf in books from their working library. Other casual inserts were slipped into titles that had been sent to them as review copies or as gifts. Most of this insert material, then, has some relationship to the title it was originally associated with although the precise nature of a given item or item-book association is not always clear. Of special interest among the manuscripts are the literary and scholarly fragments, some with definite authorship. Published (printed) insert material was left in the books.\n\nWhere possible, items are minimally described according to elements selected from the information present on documents or that was established by previous research; bracketed information is supplied. Where available, the call numbers for the book related to each item is provided, and the catalog information for the book often includes additional information about the inserted item."
