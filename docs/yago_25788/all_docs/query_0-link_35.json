        "text": "This week on \"Film Friday\" I bring you a cutesy little film that paired my favorite classic actress with one of the most dashing leading men of the Old Hollywood era.\n\nTheatrical release poster\n\nDirected by Alfred Santell, Having Wonderful Time (1938) tells the story of Teddy Shaw (Ginger Rogers), a hard-working office girl from the Bronx who constantly imagines herself as a sophisticated, well-read woman of the world. To escape the busy city life and the advances of her faithful but dull admirer, Emil Beatty (Jack Carson), whose interest in her is no longer returned, Teddy decides to take a vacation at a summer resort in the Catskill Mountains called Camp Kare-Free. Upon her arrival, she is offered a ride by Chick Kirkland (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.), a handsome law school graduate employed there as a waiter. Although he's polite, they get off to a bumpy start (and quite literally, too) after she scolds him for accidentally dropping her suitcase.\n\nOnce at camp, Teddy is greeted by the kooky social director Itchy Faulkner (Red Skelton), before her friend Fay Coleman (Peggy Conklin) introduces her to their bunkmates, Henrietta (Eve Arden), an uppity wallflower, and Miriam (Lucille Ball), a \"screwball\" who only has eyes for the womanizer Buzzy Armbruster (Lee Bowman). Chick soon breaks through Teddy's snobbish exterior and the two fall madly in love over the next days. During her last night at the camp, Chick talks of marriage, but doesn't feel his current prospects allow him to propose to her. After he makes an improper suggestion, Teddy runs from him and meets up with Buzzy, who invites her to his cabin. He tries to seduce her, but she quickly puts him off and the two end up spending the night playing backgammon. The next morning, Miriam sees Teddy sneaking out of Buzzy's cabin, before Emil arrives to drive her home. While Chick waits on them, they overhear Miriam yelling at Buzzy for having Teddy stay overnight. In the ensuing confusion, a jealous Chick punches both Buzzy and Emil and then follows Teddy out of the restaurant. Sure of Teddy's faithfulness, Chick finally proposes and the two began planning their married life.\n\nTeddy Shaw: Chick, I'm a bluff. And what's more, I know it. I know myself very well. And you come right down to it, I'm exactly like those other hillbillies from the Bronx. Oh, I didn't say my mind was bad, I just thought I'd develop it. Gee, I wish I coulda gone to college.\n\nBorn in 1900 in the historical region of Galicia, now part of western Ukraine, American author/screenwriter Arthur Kober started his professional life as a theatrical press agent for several Broadway celebrities, before rising to fame with a series of humorous short stories he wrote for The New Yorker in 1926. Shortly afterwards, Kober travelled west to Hollywood and penned screenplays for about 30 films in the 1930s and 1940s, such as Raoul Walsh's Me and My Gal (1932) and William Wyler's The Little Foxes (1941), the latter based on the semi-autobiographical play by Lillian Hellman, his former wife. Through his characters and stories, Kober often tried to capture the charm and zaniness of his Jewish upbringing in New York, becoming almost \"a folk artist of the Bronx and the Catskills.\"\n\nIn 1937, Kober wrote what is considered to be his best-remembered work, the Broadway play Having Wonderful Time, \"a colorfully riské comedy\" centered on Eastern Jewish characters vacationing in the Borscht Belt, a colloquial term used in reference to the (now mostly defunct) summer resorts of the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York. These resorts were a popular vacation spot for New York City Jews between the 1920s and the 1970s. Starring Katherine Locke, Sheldon Leonard and a young John Garfield (then still billed as Jules Garfield), Having Wonderful Time was an instant hit and later served as the basis for Kober's musical Wish You Were Here, which enjoyed a very successful run on Broadway during the 1952-1953 season.\n\nDouglas Fairbanks Jr. and Ginger Rogers\n\nWhen producer Pandro S. Berman purchased the film rights to Having Wonderful Time for RKO, the Hays Office felt that the material was too much identified with the Bronx and the Jewish community and ordered the studio to make some changes, both to widen the film's audience appeal and avoid misunderstandings and racial antagonism. As a result, after Kober was hired to write the screenplay, RKO \"carefully explained\" that Having Wonderful Time would simply be about young people of the lower middle-classes and asked him to change the setting as well as the ethnicity of his characters.\n\nWhen I was called in to make the adaptation, the first thing I had to do was turn my Jewish characters into Gentiles. Teddy Stern, the little heroine, whom Ginger Rogers played, became Teddy Shaw; Chick Kessler, her sweetheart, played by Douglas Fairbanks Jr., was given the handle of Chick Kirkland; Fay Fromkin, Teddy's friend, became Fay Coleman; 'Pinkie' Aaronson and Sam Rappaport got completely new names — they became 'Buzzy' Armbruster and Emil Beatty; and even poor 'Itchy' Flexner had to change his proud family name to Faulkner. Only the name of the camp [...] was allowed to remain. And, of course, by some curious contradiction of Hollywood's usual practice, the title of the play went underchanged.\n\n(Arthur Kober)\n\nFairbanks Jr. and Rogers on location\n\nFor the 27-year-old Ginger Rogers, Having Wonderful Time provided an oportunity for her to break out of the musical roles she had become most associated with and prove that she was a versatile actress. The film also reunited her with several of her co-stars from Gregory La Cava's Stage Door (1937), notably Lucille Ball, Eve Arden, Jack Carson and Ann Miller, whose part ended up being cut from the film. According to Rogers, making Having Wonderful Time was a very happy experience, especially travelling out of town for location shooting at Big Bear Lake in the San Bernardino Mountains, where RKO set up a mock Camp Kare-Free.\n\nRogers also enjoyed working with her dashing leading man, the 29-year-old Douglas Fairbanks Jr., whom she described as \"a very cooperative actor.\" The only child of legendary film star Douglas Fairbanks and his first wife, Anna Beth Sully, Fairbanks Jr. began his prolific career playing mainly supporting roles to several of the leading female players of the silent era, such as Pauline Starke in Women Love Diamonds (1927) and Greta Garbo in A Woman of Affairs (1928), before making a smooth transition to sound and achieving critical and commercial success in iconic films like Mervyn LeRoy's Little Caesar (1931) and George Stevens's Gunga Din (1939). \"Ginger and I got along happily and well,\" he later said. \"In fact, she got along well with everybody [...] However, I was always on my best behavior with her because she invariably remind me of an innocent high-spirited college kid, enthusiastic about ice cream sodas, with a vocabulary dependent on 'Gosh' and 'Gee-whiz.'\"\n\nRed Skelton and Ginger Rogers\n\nHaving Wonderful Time marked the feature film debut of Red Skelton, who lent his extraordinary comedy skills to the role of Itchy Faulkner, Camp Kare-Free's zany entertainment director. A stage performer since a very young age, Skelton was a sought-after master of ceremonies for dance marathons, a popular event during the Great Depression, before getting his big chance in 1937 as an headlining act at Loew's State Theater in New York. Skelton's experienced co-stars were very helpful in showing him the \"movie ropes\" and Rogers even gave the 25-year-old newcomer some tips on one of his many hobbies, photography.\n\nAccording to Rogers, Skelton's supporting role was supposed to have been larger, but unfortunately \"much of his antic inventiveness ended up on the cutting-room floor.\" Thankfully, RKO was sensible enough to preserve his signature doughnut-dunking sketch, which had gotten him his engagement at Loew's. Running right at three minutes, the sequence features Skelton demonstrating three types of dunkers: the cross-eyed variety, the society sort and the sneaky dunker. While Having Wonderful Time also showcased another memorable Skelton routine, on various ways people go up stairs, the comedian had numerous \"how to\" bits, one or more of which was presumably filmed but not used. Fairbanks Jr. later explained the reason why Skelton's role was significantly reduced: \"the big bosses at the studio were unable to appreciate Skelton's broad, slapstick style and cut his part down to the barest minimum needed to hold the slender plot together.\"\n\nHaving Wonderful Time was neither a commercial nor critical success upon its release in July 1938. The Variety reviewer, familiar with the Broadway version, wrote, \"Much of the charm, romantic tenderness and social problem features of Arthur Kober's stage play [...] are missing in the screen version. In their place, the author, who also did the screenscript, has substituted some lively horseplay and occasional slapstick and has accentuated the comedy angles [...] Public will accept it as a good time, and laugh heartily at its obvious humor.\" Ginger Rogers blamed period censorship for the film's problems: \"At the insistence of the Hays Office, the ethnic Jewish story was played by a decidedly gentile cast. As a result, the film was not nearly as funny as the play and, understandably, was nowhere near as successful.\" Red Skelton's performance, however, was universally praised, with The New York Times calling it \"faultless,\" and turned his career-making doughnut routine into a little piece of comedy history.\n\nGinger Rogers and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in a publicity still\n\nPersonally, I really enjoyed Having Wonderful Time. Ginger Rogers is stunning as always and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is incredibly dashing. I think this was the first film I ever saw with him and I fell in love right away. They have amazing chemistry too. And then of course there is Red Skelton. Oh, what a little gem he was! By the way, totally unrelated topic — am I the only one who wishes there was a film (or two) starring both Red Skelton AND the completely underrated Virginia O'Brien? The screen time they shared in Norman Z. McLeod's Lady Be Good (1941) and Roy Del Ruth's DuBarry Was a Lady (1943) wasn't nearly enough to showcase the wonderful things they could do together. They were such a good team and it's an absolute shame that the Hollywood studio bosses did not realized that.\n\n____________________________\n\nSOURCES:\n\nEve Arden: A Chronicle of All Film, Television, Radio and Stage Performances by David C.

A drama graduate from Northwestern University, she had just arrived in Hollywood following a Tony Award-winning performance in Lillian Hellman's Another Part of the Forest . Impressed by Patricia's looks, Vidor approached the young actress and asked if she would be interested in doing a screen test for the female lead in his newest film, The Fountainhead (1949). Gary Cooper had already signed as the male protagonist, and the studio was then considering Lauren Bacall and Barbara Stanwyck to play his love interest. Neal liked the script and about two months later, she met with the director for sound and photographic tests. Vidor was enthusiastic about Patricia, but her first audition was a complete disaster. Cooper was apparently watching her from off the set and he was so unimpressed by her performance that he commented, « What's that!? » He tried to con\n\nIn the mid- and late 1930s, screwball comedy was in vogue and practically every actress in Hollywood tried her hand at it. Barbara Stanwyck never considered herself a naturally funny person or a comedienne per se , but after delivering a heart-wrenching performance in King Vidor's Stella Dallas (1937), she decided she needed a « vacation » from emotional dramas. In her search for a role, she stumbled upon a « champagne comedy » called The Mad Miss Manton (1938), originally intended as a Katharine Hepburn vehicle. Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda as Melsa and Peter in The Mad Miss Manton . Directed by Leigh Jason from a script by Philip G. Epstein, The Mad Miss Manton begins when vivacious Park Avenue socialite Melsa Manton finds a corpse while walking her dogs in the early hours of the morning. She calls the police, but they dismiss the incident — not only because Melsa is a notorious prankster, but also because the body disappears in the meantime. Sarcastic newspaper editor\n\nAt the 3rd Academy Awards ceremony, MGM's hugely successful prison drama The Big House (1930) earned writer Frances Marion an Oscar for Best Writing. Hoping that she would be inspired to repeat that accomplishment, Irving Thalberg, head of production at Metro, sent Marion to Chicago, Illinois to research story ideas. While flicking through the pages of The Saturday Evening Post , she found an article revealing that, in a city where people distrusted the police, a small group of leading citizens met in secret to arrange their own justice for criminals. Marion took inspiration from that story and wrote The Secret Six (1931), in which Wallace Beery and Lewis Stone, stars of The Big House , play two mobsters prosecuted by a half a dozen vigilantes. Thalberg was pleased with the leading roles Marion wrote for Beery and Stone, but asked if she could also fill out one of the minor leads for Clark Gable , a tall, dark and handsome 30-year-old actor whom Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had recen\n\nTheatrical release poster Directed by George Sidney , Who Was That Lady?

This list includes both classic and «modern» films, which make up a total of 161 titles. About three or four of these were re-watches, but I decided to include them anyway. Let me know how many from these you have seen. As always, films marked with a heart ( ❤ ) are my favorites. Sherlock Jr. (1924) | Starring Buster Keaton, Kathryn McGuire and Joe Keaton The Crowd (1928) | Starring James Murray, Eleanor Boardman and Bert Roach Young Mr. Lincoln (1939) | Starring Henry Fonda, Alice Brady and Marjorie Weaver Brief Encounter (1945) | Starring Celia Johnson, Trevor Howard and Stanley Holloway The Bells of St. Mary's (1945) | Starring Bing Crosby and Ingrid Bergman The Girl He Left Behind (1956) | Starring Tab Hunter and Natalie Wood Gidget (1959) | Starring Sandra Dee, Cliff Robertson an\n\nWings was the first ever film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Since then, it has become one of the most influential war dramas, noted for its technical realism and spectacular air-combat sequences. This is the story of how it came to be made. A man and his story The concept for Wings originated from a writer trying to sell one of his stories. In September 1924, Byron Morgan approached Jesse L. Lasky, vice-president of Famous Players-Lasky, a component of Paramount Pictures, proposing that the studio do an aviation film. Morgan suggested an «incident and plot» focused on the failure of the American aerial effort in World War I and the effect that the country's «aviation unpreparedness» would have in upcoming conflicts. Lasky liked the idea, and approved the project under the working title «The Menace.» LEFT: Byron Morgan (1889-1963). RIGHT: Jesse L. Lasky (1880-1958). During his development of the scenario with William Shepherd, a former war correspondent, Morga\n\nI started this blog six years ago as a way to share my passion for classic films and Old Hollywood. I used to watch dozens of classic films every month, and every time I discovered a new star I liked I would go and watch their entire filmography. But somewhere along the way, that passion dimmed down. For instance, I watched 73 classic films in 2016, and only 10 in 2020. The other day, I found this film with Douglas Fairbanks Jr. that I had never heard of — the film is Mimi (1935), by the way — and for some reason it made me really excited about Old Hollywood again. It made me really miss the magic of that era and all the wonderful actors and actresses. And it also made me think of all the reasons why I fell in love with classic films in the first place. I came up with 80 reasons, which I thought would be fun to share with you. Most of them are just random little scenes or quirky little quotes, but put them together and they spell Old Hollywood to me. Yesterday I posted part one ; her\n\nChristmas has always been a source of inspiration to many artists and writers. Over the years, filmmakers have adapted various Christmas stories into both movies and TV specials, which have become staples during the holiday season all around the world. Even though Christmas is my favourite holiday, I haven't watched a lot of Christmas films. Still, I thought it would be fun to rank my top 10 favourites, based on the ones that I have indeed seen. Here they are. 10. Holiday Affair (1949) Directed by Don Hartman, Holiday Affair tells the story of a young widow (Janet Leigh) torn between a boring attorney (Wendell Corey) and a romantic drifter (Robert Mitchum). She's engaged to marry the boring attorney, but her son (Gordon Gebert) likes the romantic drifter better. Who will she choose? Well, we all know who she will choose. Holiday Affair is not by any means the greatest Christmas film of all time, but it's still a very enjoyable Yule-tide comedy to watch over the holi\n\nIn January 1944, MGM chief Louis B. Mayer happened to see a young crooner by the name of Frank Sinatra perform at a benefit concert for The Jewish Home for the Aged in Los Angeles. According to Nancy Sinatra, Frank's eldest daughter, Mayer was so moved by her father's soulful rendition of « Ol' Man River » that he made the decision right then and there to sign Frank to his studio. Sinatra had been on the MGM payroll once before, singing with the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra in the Eleanor Powell vehicle Ship Ahoy (1942), although it is very likely that Mayer never bothered to see that film. Now that Frank was «hot,» however, Metro made arrangements to buy half of his contract from RKO, with the final deal being signed in February of that year. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra in Anchors Aweigh Being a contract player at the studio that boasted «more stars than there are in the heavens» gave Frank a sudden perspective regarding his own talents as a film performer.
