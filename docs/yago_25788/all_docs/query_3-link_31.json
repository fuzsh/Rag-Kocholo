        "text": "At BravoCon 2023, fans wanting an update on The Real Housewives of New Jersey got their fix during a November 5 panel discussion called \"In a Jersey State of Mind.\" Held at Caesar's Forum in Las Vegas, the sitdown featured Michael Rappaport as a moderator. Rappaport had a question for Jennifer Aydin that hit close to home: \"How's the pool house doing?\" he asked.\n\nTo back up a bit, during Season 9 of RHONJ, Dr. Bill Aydin’s time in the pool house became a hot topic. More recently, in Season 13, Jennifer shared why it upsets her that her husband so often hangs out there. “This is the thing: You come home, you go straight to the pool house,” Jennifer said to Bill during a session with a psychologist. “You go in there, and you stay in there until three hours, and you come in once we’re all done finished eating dinner. That irritates me. When I see his car in the camera, I’m like, ‘Uh, what about a hello?’”\n\nOn Part 2 of The Real Housewives of New Jersey Season 13 reunion, Jennifer shared Bill’s perspective on the issue. “He explained the pool house to me,” she told host Andy Cohen. “He said, ‘Look, Jen, I’m all day with patients. I’m on, on, on. When I walk into the house, I know there’s you, there’s a nanny, there’s your dad, there [are] four kids, now there’s a dog. I need to unwind a little bit.’”\n\nJennifer Aydin shares an update on her pool house at BravoCon 2023\n\nSo, how are things in the pool house today? Back at BravoCon 2023, Jennifer said: \"A lot's going on in the pool house, but let's keep it PG.\" She went on to say that she and Bill hang out in the pool house together these days. \"I take it over from him most of the time,\" she says. \"He comes in there, he finds me in there ... It's our little getaway.\"\n\nJennifer Aydin shares the latest on her marriage with Bill Aydin\n\nWhen Rappaport asked how difficult it was for the couple to deal with difficulties in their marriage publicly, Jennifer shared: \"For me, going through it publicly was OK because I got to show everybody that marriages can survive when you have lived through something that can traumatize you. It's all about forgiveness and seeing the bigger picture.\"\n\nShe continued: \"What was hard for me was that ... I wasn't able to control my emotions while we were filming and I was breaking down a lot as you guys saw. One of the reasons I decided to share my story is that there's power in a story.\"\n\nShe added that she received tons of messages from fans who could relate to her situation.\n\nAfter Bill admitted to having had an affair, Jennifer said: \"I trust him 100 percent, so it's not about trust. It's about building the trust back.\""
