        "text": "FINALLY, I have some answers. I've been going on this ride for years and years. So many memories were made on this ride at Six Flags.\n\nTwo of my favorite rides at Six Flags are Skull Mountain and The Dark Knight, both indoor roller coasters. The very first roller coaster my daughter was ever on was Skull Mountain, so it will always have those good feelings for me.\n\nAll the new rides through the years at Six Flags Great Adventure, it's the older ones that we have all the memories for.\n\nIt's funny we did a Shawn & Sue poll and Skull Mountain won as your favorite indoor roller coaster against The Dark Knight. Skull Mountain is the \"big winner\". My husband loves Skull Mountain, he'd always choose this one. My daughter chooses that, too.\n\nKeep Reading: Best Bagels at the Jersey Shore\n\nOk, enough about the reminiscing, I know you're wondering what ride I'm writing about. I know it's a ride you've been on over and over again.\n\nThe skyride named the Skyway has been around forever, what is happening to it?\n\nAre they removing it?\n\n**UPDATE! UPDATE!\n\nThe Skyway is one of the Oldest Ride at Six Flags Great Adventure, is it being removed?\n\nYes, it is being removed because they can't find the parts to the old ride. There will not be another sky ride built, at least for now. The Skyway is being removed. I spoke to a Six Flags employee about this ride that he and I will miss so much.\n\nIf you look at their map of the park, it is no longer on their map. CLICK HERE to check out the map. The Skyway is not mentioned on their website, either.\n\nI will tell you that I went to Six Flags about five times this year, I have not seen it running at all this season yet. This makes me sad."
