With her two-week-old baby in her arms, Britain’s most famous classical trumpeter turned on the radio one Sunday morning and started listening to a debate from the Cheltenham Literary Festival.\n\n“I said to my husband, ‘Wow, Cheltenham is only half an hour away, we should go to more things there.’ ” The man she had married ten months earlier — the stage and film director Sam Mendes — agreed. So Balsom went on to the Cheltenham festivals website and saw the item that changed her life.\n\n“It was a job advertisement for artistic director of the Cheltenham Music Festival,” she says. “I thought, ‘Why not?’"
