        "text": "I’m Rabbi Avraham Rappaport\n\n“MY JOB IS TO MAKE SURE YOUR SON HAS A PERFECT EXPERIENCE”\n\nRabbi Avraham Rappaport is a certified Expert Mohel, having received his ordination as a Rabbi through the Chief Rabbinate of the State of Israel. He also holds a Bachelor’s degree in Talmudic Law from the Ner Israel Rabbinical College of Baltimore and is active in Jewish education at adult, teenage and childhood levels. In addition, he is a licensed Insurance and Financial Advisor and the President and Founder of Premier Financial in Columbia, MD. Rabbi Rappaport is a second generation Mohel who has been active in the field of Bris since 1995 and has performed approximately 4000 ceremonies and procedures in Israel, Canada and across the United States. He currently resides with his wife and five children in Montgomery County, MD. He was privileged to apprentice for several years as a Mohel with the world renowned Chief Mohel of Israel, Rabbi Moshe Weisberg, and interned at the renowned Shaare Zedek Hospital in Jerusalem. As well, Rabbi Rappaport practices at local hospitals and surgical centers with leading pediatricians and urologists. Blending his energetic personality with his professional expertise, Rabbi Rappaport travels far and wide making Bris Milah and circumcision a heartwarming and meaningful experience for the many Jewish, Non-Jewish and inter-faith families he is honored to service.\n\nMeet the Rabbi’s Family\n\nTestimonials\n\nI am an integrative medical Nurse Practitioner and draw a lot of home birth clients - I regularly refer them to Rabbi Rappaport, because out of the hundreds of circumcisions I watched in the hospital over the years, his work on my first son was the most straightforward and drama-free I’d ever seen! We just used Rabbi Rappaport again for our new son and again his work is so fast, painless and clean. Listen to my video testimonial as well\n\nStefanie (NP) & Robert J.\n\n\"During nursing school, I observed dozens of circumcisions and Rabbi Rappaport's procedure on our son was the most relaxed and least traumatic one I have ever seen.\"\n\nAmber Zukas & Brad Cawthern\n\n\"We are so thankful that we chose Rabbi Avraham Rappaport to be the Mohel for both of our boys. He was everything we could ask for. His ceremony was inspiring, accommodating and even a bit humorous. He made everyone feel so calm at such an anxious moment. The actual circumcision took a few seconds and our baby hardly cried. Our pediatrician raved about Rabbi Rappaport’s work and we hope other expecting parents are privileged to engage Rabbi Rappaport to perform their son’s Bris.\"\n\nRabbi Ariel and Pessi Sadwin,\n\n\"Rabbi Rappaport brought great kindness and warmth to the bris he conducted for our son, Reuben, and the naming ceremony of Reuben's twin sister, Anabel. The Rabbi's words contained both wisdom and humor--necessities if you're embarking upon a journey with twins--and we believe that both children received the best of sendoffs to a rich, happy Jewish life. We're very lucky that Rabbi Rappaport with his expertise was there to help share in our simchas.\"\n\nSarah and Howard Ockman,\n\n\"We found the time leading up to the actual circumcision very stressful. We had two main concerns. First, were we taking an unnecessary risk having the circumcision performed by mohel who wasn’t also a doctor? I did a little research and found that mohel’s are experts at the circumcision procedure. Even the royal house of England chooses a mohel over a doctor for the circumcision of its boys. Second, was our little boy going to be in pain? Prior to the ceremony I was comforted by the fact that I did not remember my circumcision. Having watched Rabbi Avraham Rappaport perform my son’s circumcision with such swiftness and professionalism, I can attest to the fact that our baby seemed much more disturbed by diaper changes than the circumcision. We were also so grateful for Rabbi Rappaport’s personal follow up to the Bris. We had a second son and did not need to think twice about reserving Rabbi Rappaport for his expert service once again.\"\n\nRachel and Jason S.,\n\nWe have had two sons and Rabbi Rappaport has performed the circumcision for each – and we cannot imagine anyone else leading this important milestone. After the Rabbi performed our nephew’s circumcision, we knew he was the right person for us. It’s not just a medical procedure for him. He personalizes each one and provides genuine care for each set of parents. He promises a perfect experience for your baby boy, and it has been just that every time – if we are blessed with another son, we know who to call!\n\nJoshua, Julianna, Richard, Simone, and Henry\n\nWe had our son Tobi circumcised by an OBGYN in Lutherville, MD when he was 12 days old. We though that since he's a doctor he's in good hands. Unfortunately, it was not good at all and it needed to be completely redone as a 2 month old. We've now learned that this is the case with many of this doctors procedures. Thankfully we were referred to the wonderful Rabbi Avraham who fixed everything in less than one minute and made the very stressful process so easy and reassuring. We will only be recommending Rabbi Rappaport to all our friends and family in the future!\n\nLola and Paul Ekanem\n\nFor those of you as new parents, looking for a Mohel, allow me to introduce you to Rabbi Avraham Rappaport.\n\nI am an anesthesiologist with 41 years of experience and now a grandfather. Rabbi Rappaport performed the Bris for my grandson. Simply put, he was excellent. Put aside your stress, anxiety and worry. He is personable and very professional both medically and rabbinically. Watching the procedure first hand, holding my grandson, I can tell you that his sterile technique and surgical dexterity was first class. My brother, a dentist and another anesthesia colleague were in attendance. We all agreed that he was top notch. His care of the child throughout the ceremony was calming. His instructions before the ceremony, during and aftercare instructions were great. He is available, if needed, after he leaves the Bris. This was very reassuring. A Bris can be very nerve wracking for everyone. Rabbi Rappaport was excellent in all areas and you will find yourselves at ease with him. I heartily recommend him as a Mohel without reservation.\n\nMark Schutz\n\n\"My son was circumcised in the hospital the day after he was born just as my older son was. This time, the circumcision was horribly executed. We feared he would be teased as he got older. Our pediatrician (whom we greatly respect) advised we “give it a few months”.\n\nNo parents wants to make the decision to have their child re-circumcised. The only option we were given was surgery. We did not like the idea of our son having to be admitted to the hospital and put under general anesthesia at 9 months old so I began researching any other option.\n\nThat is when I foundRabbi Rappaport.Rabbi Rappaport was responsive and kind while listening to our concerns. Because our son was already 9 months old he quickly fit us into his schedule.\n\nRabbi Rappaport came to our home and the whole process took less than 1 minute (and the painful part less than 2 seconds...I’m not kidding). My husband and I were able to hold him and console him before, during and immediately after so that he was at peace.\n\nI know it seems unbelievable but there was no swelling or bleeding and my son only had over the counter pain medicine. He was back to his normal happy self that evening.\n\nRabbi Rappaport corrected the previously botched circumcision and made this process as painless as possible for everyone. If we have more boys in the future we will useRabbi Rappaport the first time!\"\n\nAnna and Jerry Jubb\n\nWe were a bit nervous before our son’s Brit Mila. Luckily, our experience with Rabbi Rappaport was very positive. He immediately put us all at ease with his professional yet relaxed approach, kindness and thoughtfulness to everyone in the room, including the children who constantly approached him to see what he was doing. We highly recommend Rabbi Rappaport for new and experienced families who wish for a wonderful and relatively stress-free experience for their young ones.\n\nGreg Holden & Lilach Cohen-Holden\n\n\"Rabbi Avraham Rappaport did a wonderful job at each of our 3 son’s Bris’s. His pleasant smile, kind words, and quick hand made us nervous parents at ease. We recommend him to all rookie and veteran parents!\"\n\nRebbecca and Max Masinter,\n\n\"We have nothing but the highest praise for Rabbi\n\nRappaport. He made a potentially stressful event both\n\nmeaningful and inspiring. The Rabbi was very flexible\n\nand allowed us to incorporate our own words into the\n\nceremony so that it would feel more personalized. His\n\nfollow-through was above and beyond the call of duty\n\n-- he visited our son both before and after the\n\nceremony. Perhaps most importantly, Rabbi Rappaport\n\nis very skilled and we are very pleased with his\n\nwork.\"\n\nJennifer, Josh (and Ari) Kefer\n\n\"We were so happy and fortunate that our good friend Rabbi Avraham Rappaport was able to fly out to Chicago to perform our son Eli’s Bris. Having two other sons born in other states with other Mohels we really feel that Rabbi Avraham Rappaport is “a cut above the rest”! His knowledge, his ceremony and his medical care and expertise were so reassuring to us.\"\n\nRebbecca and Morris Finkelstien,\n\n\"Having Rabbi Rappaport perform our son's circumcision was a wonderful blessing. Not only did he demonstrate utmost professionalism in his surgical skill, his words and actions showed a genuine care for our son and family. Given our experience with Rabbi Rappaport, there is no doubt in our mind that we made the right decision to avoid having the circumcision performed by a medical doctor. We cannot recommend him highly enough.\"\n\nBranden & Gina Schroeder\n\n\"After 4 girls we were quite excited and anxious to celebrate our son's Bris. We had already been to dozens of Brisses that Rabbi Rappaport performed so we had nothing to be concerned about. He was so patient, calm and reassuring and visited us at our home before after the Bris. The procedure was completed before I even realized he actually did it. He is absolutely \"a cut above the rest!\"\n\nMeghann and Ben Schwartz\n\nContact Me\n\n\n\nAddress\n\n18681 Queen Elizabeth Drive,\n\nBrookeville, MD 20833\n\n\n\nHome\n\n301-260-7590\n\n\n\nCell\n\n443-790-6541\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n[email protected]\n\nAsk A Question\n\nName*\n\nEmail Address*\n\nMessage*\n\nPhone\n\nCAPTCHA\n\nPhone\n\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\nΔ"
