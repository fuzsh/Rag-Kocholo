        "text": "Michael McBain grew up in Atlantic City in a family filled with grief after his father was shot and killed in the line of duty. After spending years in a boarding school, Michael went on to medical school, then arrived in town in 2003 as an intern at Llanview hospital.\n\nLiving a life filled with pain, Michael grew up to be a bitter man. Although Marcie Walsh befriended him, she was reeling with her own grief after losing the love of her life Al Holden and found it hard to tolerate Michael's rash mood swings and crude behavior. Here's where Michael's life took a turn for the worse� Surprisingly, after having a bad reaction to a certain medication, Michael died before Marcie's eyes�\n\nWhat people didn't realize was that Marcie had been having 'real' visions and conversations with her deceased boyfriend Al. On the day Michael died, Al was there in Angels Square and took over Michael's body! In order to live again, Al had until Valentine's day for Marcie to realize it was indeed him inside of Michael's body. With a love so strong, Marcie recognized Al in Michael's eyes and the two were able to live their lives together with Al's soul in Michael's body as Al's spirit went to heaven with Michael's soul�\n\nMichael turned out to be a major asset to Llanview hospital. With the help of Marcie, Michael spied on Dr. Long and Paul Cramer and revealed that the two had been working together and making money by illegally stealing and selling organs from dead patients without the family's permission!\n\nThroughout the years, Michael and Marcie have had their ups and downs. After Marcie shared an old manuscript with Michael that she'd written titled The Killing Club, Michael convinced her to find an agent and introduced her to Hayes Barber. Little did Michael know, Hayes was the sole mastermind behind the Killing Club killings. Although he lost many friends during Hayes's killing spree, Michael was thankful that Marcie's life was spared.\n\nIn 2006, Michael went on to marry Marcie and the two recently adopted baby Tommy who lost his parents in a tornado. Although Michael hired Rex Balsom to find Tommy's birth parents, Rex didn't have the heart to tell him and Marcie that Tommy is really the biological son of Todd Manning!\n\nWith the near tragic death and recovery of his brother John weighing heavily on Michael's mind, Michael had to face his biggest hardship after finding out Todd Manning was Tommy's biological father!\n\nAlthough Michael did everything to keep the secret, eventually the truth was exposed and he was forced to admit to Marcie that he knew the truth all along. Furious, Marcie packed up Tommy, left town, leaving Michael with not only a broken heart but fearing for what will happen to Marcie once she's found!"
