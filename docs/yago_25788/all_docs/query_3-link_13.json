        "text": "Jennifer Rapaport ruled the roost in the 114th running of the Boston Marathon.\n\nA Melrose resident and marathon veteran, Rapaport led a large contingent of 25 Melrose runners down the 26.2-mile course from Hopkinton to Boston, finishing 23rd in her division, 489th among women runners and 4,278th overall, with a time of 3:19:09, April 19.\n\n“I feel great,” said Rapaport, 46. “My goal was to hit 3:20 and I dipped below it by one minute. I ran even splits the entire race except for the very end down Boylston, where I literally was running as fast as I could for that finish. I knew I was fit enough to run 3:20 barring anything happening which is always a possibility in a marathon.”\n\nIt was a sizable improvement for the Main Street resident after finishing first among local women and seventh overall among Melrosians last year with a time of 3:43:03.\n\n“I didn’t have a time goal [last year],” she said. “I just decided to participate to experience the Boston Marathon. This year, I got a little more training in and decided to set a time goal.”\n\nBorn in Ohio and raised in Peterborough, NH, Rapaport moved to Melrose 14 years ago with her husband, Dean. A member of the Melrose Running Club, this marked Rapaport’s 10th marathon, including Chicago, the Twin Cities in Minneapolis, New Orleans, Hartford and Richmond, but only her second time running Boston.\n\n“My personal best is 2:47:37 set in 2002 at the Chicago Marathon,” she said. “I won’t ever be that fast again, but I still really enjoy the marathon training and running great races like Boston.”\n\nThe local female contingent loomed large with two other Melrose women rounding out the top three. Ceara Mahoney was hot on Rapaport’s heels. The 30-year-old finished a strong second among Melrose runners with a time of 3:19:14, ranking 395th in her division.\n\nRapaport was surprised by how close it came to earn Melrose bragging rights.\n\n“I don’t think I know Ceara, but I must have passed her on Boylston Street in my crazy sprint finish,” Rapaport said. “I’ve probably seen her running by our house. Congrats to Ceara. I hope to compete with her again next year.”\n\nJeanne MacDonald crossed the finish line a little later. The 38-year-old took third among the locals clocking in at 3:27:33.\n\nMelrose’s top male runner, Daniel Zibaitis, 40, came in at just under the four-hour mark with a time of 3:53:34.\n\nThe city’s youngest runner, Lauren Izzicupo, 26, finished in the middle of the pack ranking 11th overall among Melrose runners (4:30:44).\n\nMeanwhile, Melrose’s oldest runners, Alastair Drummond (5:09:26) and Elizabeth Vainer (5:20:29), both 50, also completed the course in less than five and a half hours. Vainer also ranked 756th among her age group.\n\nRapaport is already plotting her next move. She will be pacing a half marathon in Fargo, North Dakota, before competing in the Around the Lake Marathon in Wakefield in July. She will then his the international circuit heading making a Euro trip in the fall.\n\n“I am running the Berlin Marathon in Germany in September,” she said. “I am going to go with about eight other people I train with. It’s my first race in another country. I am very excited for that trip.”\n\nSee how they run\n\nHere is a look at how 25 Melrose runners fared in the running of the 114th Boston Marathon.\n\nMelrose runners Age Time\n\nJennifer Rapaport 46 3:19:09\n\nCeara Mahoney 30 3:19:14\n\nJeanne MacDonald 38 3:27:33\n\nDaniel Zibaitis 40 3:53:34\n\nSuzan Beauregard 34 4:01:28\n\nMichael O'Connor 42 4:02:18\n\nLori Bokowy 30 4:09:49\n\nPatrick Michaud 28 4:22:32\n\nKevin Bowers 28 4:24:53\n\nJohn Lynch 45 4:27:57\n\nLauren Izzicupo 26 4:30:44\n\nShaun Miller 32 4:41:47\n\nJoy Fay 39 4:42:08\n\nDonald Nally 45 4:46:55\n\nMichelle Long 34 4:47:11\n\nTherese Hudson 37 4:51:42\n\nKelly Webber 41 4:59:29\n\nStephanie Nelson 35 5:06:26\n\nAlastair Drummond 50 5:09:07\n\nScott Crain 39 5:09:28\n\nRobert Balfour 49 5:14:42\n\nKaren O'Brien 40 5:15:42\n\nElizabeth Vainer 50 5:20:29\n\nJohn Valente 47 5:20:57\n\nYvonne Garcia 36 6:04:47"
