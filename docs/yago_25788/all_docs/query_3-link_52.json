        "text": "Please join us in congratulating soap alums Jessica Morris and Rib Hillis on their marriage! The couple tied the knot in a beautiful ceremony on May 11 at the Inn of the Seventh Ray in Topanga, CA. “It’s official!” the blushing bride cheered on Instagram. “I’m so happy to announce that I am now Mrs. Hillis!”\n\nAnd among all the comments and well-wishes from family, friends, and fans, Hillis chimed in to declare: “Love you, my Queen,” adding the hashtag “#MrsHillis” for good measure.\n\nMorris is best known to soap fans for playing Jennifer Rappaport on ONE LIFE TO LIVE from 2001-05 with a brief appearance in 2008. Hillis starred as Dr. Jake Marshak on the GENERAL HOSPITAL spinoff, PORT CHARLES, from 1997-98. He also subbed in as a recast for Ethan on PASSIONS when Eric Martsolf took paternity leave.\n\nThe rustic wedding was officiated by Morris’ best friend, actress Robin Sydney. “I knew I wanted to be surrounded by nature and twinkling lights,” the bride told People of her “magical and romantic” nuptials. She also loved her gown from Evie Young which made her feel like “a sensual forest nymph.”\n\nThe couple first met back in 2013 when Hillis cast Morris to play his wife in a movie. “Finding true love is not always easy,” the bride admitted. “Sometimes the journey is long and full of obstacles, twists and turns, and even some pitfalls. But if you keep going, never lose hope, and follow your heart, it will take you to a wonderful destination.\n\n“We complete each other,” Morris concluded. “We have always felt that we were each others’ missing puzzle peace and when we are together, our puzzle is complete and we are happy.”"
