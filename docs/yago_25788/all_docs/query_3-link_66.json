        "text": "Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston have long since moved on from their early-aughts relationship (both remarried and later divorced again). But the public—and, apparently, Michael Rapaport—are still enthralled by the couple's 2000 Malibu wedding.\n\nOn Monday's episode of Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, Rapaport (who appeared in True Romance with Pitt in 1993 and in Friends with Aniston) opened up about the wedding...23 years later, TODAY reports.\n\n\"I was at Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston’s wedding, they had a wall of caviar, I still have some saved over,” Rapaport said. He didn't leave the caviar comment at that, either. Later on in the show he joked that he is \"still eating the caviar from that,\" adding that \"Billy Preston performed. Lot of bucks there.\"\n\nApparently, the caviar stuck with Rapaport for a reason. He's a fan! During another segment of the show, when discussing RHONY star Erin Lichy's Hamptons trip, Cohen asked if \"Pringles and caviar\" was \"a sufficient enough welcome snack?\"\n\n\"I'm looking into the camera about this, Erin. Any time you're serving caviar, let me know,\" Rapaport quipped.\n\nClearly, Brad and Jen's iconic wedding is still living rent-free in Rapaport's head, even though the couple divorced in 2005, five years after tying the knot. Pitt went on to marry Angelina Jolie before calling it quits in 2016, while Aniston was married to Justin Theroux for three years.\n\nDespite their highly publicized divorce, Jen and Brad have remained friends over the years since their split. They were photographed together in a heartfelt, internet-breaking moment at the Screen Actors Guild Awards in January 2020, and later that year, they did a virtual table read of Fast Times at Ridgemont High.\n\nIn 2021, Aniston told Howard Stern that she and her famous ex were still pals. \"It was absolutely fun,\" she said of the table read. \"Brad and I are buddies, we're friends.\"\n\nCaviar walls really bond people, I guess."
