        "text": "That was Jennifer Aniston's tightlipped response on Tuesday morning's \"Today\" show when asked about the latest rumor that Oprah Winfrey is planning to host an $8 million wedding for her and beau Vince Vaughn.\n\nThe moment grew still more awkward when Aniston's \"Friends with Money\" co-star, Catherine Keener, weighed in on her behalf. \"I thought you weren't going to go there,\" she told entertainment correspondent Jill Rappaport. \"But you did.\"\n\n\"It's frustrating because those rumors do get out there,\" replied Rappaport.\n\nEarlier in the interview segment, which also included co-star Joan Cusack, Aniston said she gives interviews to promote a movie, not her personal life.\n\n\"It's the other stuff...,\" she said, scrunching up her face in reference to the yearlong headlines involving Vaughn, ex-husband Brad Pitt and other personal topics.\n\nRappaport explained she was curious about the wedding rumors, saying, \"When you hear about an $8 million wedding, you'd like to be invited.\"\n\n\"And now you won't be,\" quipped Keener, drawing laughs from Rappaport, Aniston and Cusack.\n\n\"Friends with Money,\" a drama about four women whose varying degrees of success put a strain on their relationships, opens Friday in limited release."
