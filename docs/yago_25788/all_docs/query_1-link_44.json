In recent years many English-speaking (but also Dutch and Scandinavian) scholars have fruitfully explored the interactions between gender and written culture in late medieval England. These studies merit consideration and comparison with recent developments in French historiography. Many of these works can be placed within the framework of studies on “literacy/orality/aurality” and pay particular attention to the complexities of the content and forms of women’s knowledge and their transmission at all levels. These studies emphasize the multiplicity of situations and models according to social, political and religious contexts. They enlarge and question the notion of literacy as well as the relations of domination between men and women and the resulting tensions and negotiations. As such, they map a far more complex cultural landscape\n\nThis dissertation examines four English texts—Beowulf; Ancrene Wisse; Geoffrey Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales’ Man of Law’s Tale and Second Nun’s Tale; and Richard Hyrde’s English translation, The Instruction of a Christian Woman, of Juan Luis Vives’ De Institutione Feminae Christianae—in terms of their use of exempla related to women. These texts all find women good “to think with,” to use, from The Body and Society, Peter Brown’s appropriation of Levi-Strauss’s famous wordplay. The ways in which these Old English, Middle English, and modern English texts portray women’s lives and bodies as a gateway into thought about the Christian life are also compared with portrayals of the lives of female saints in hagiographic texts of late antiquity and the Middle Ages. ©2016 by Jennifer Pastoor All Rights Reserved Acknowledgments I wish to extend special thanks first of all to Dr. William Quinn for his wisdom, expertise, and kind help throughout all stages of my coursework, exams, and dissertat..."
