        "text": "It’s been more than two decades since Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt tied the knot and Michael Rapaport has spilled the tea — or, rather, caviar — on new details regarding the former couple’s highly-publicized nuptials.\n\nWhile appearing on Sunday night’s (Aug. 13) episode of Watch What Happens Live, Rapaport was asked for his thoughts on Real Housewives of New York City star Erin Lichy‘s hosting abilities in the Hamptons — and, more importantly, her decision to serve caviar with Pringles.\n\n“Any time you’re serving caviar, let me know,” Rapaport said to the camera. “I was at Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston’s wedding. They had a wall of caviar. I still have some saved over.”\n\nAndy Cohen was left shocked by the revelation since the comedian and Bravo aficionado had never before opened up about their luxurious Malibu wedding during his many visits to The Clubhouse.\n\n“How have you been on the show 87 times, and I’ve never talked to you about Aniston and Pitt’s wedding?” Cohen asked, to which Rapaport replied, “Well, we dropped it now and I’m still eating the caviar from that — I was shoveling it down.”\n\nHe added that “Billy Preston performed,” before joking that there were “a lot of bucks there.”\n\nSo how did Rapaport score an invite to the wedding of the century? Well, he guest-starred on Friends in 1999 when he played Phoebe’s (Lisa Kudrow) police officer boyfriend. And years before his gig on the hit sitcom, he starred alongside Pitt in the 1993 film True Romance.\n\nThe iconic actors said “I do” in July 2000, before announcing their divorce in 2005. The Fight Club star went on to marry his Mr. and Mrs. Smith co-star Angelina Jolie, whom he stayed with from 2004-2016; while Aniston was with Justin Theroux from 2011-2018.\n\nTo this day, Pitt and Aniston remain amicable. In 2020, they reunited for a virtual table reading of Fast Times at Ridgemont High, where they played love interests. At one point, they had to read a risqué scene in which Aniston’s character walked in on Pitt’s character masturbating while fantasizing about her."
