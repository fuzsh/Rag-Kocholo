        "meta_description": "Jennifer and Jason's beautiful wedding in the Channel Islands Harbor, Oxnard, California - reception on The Scarlett Belle Riverboat  To see this in a slideshow - just click left and right arrows - images will show in order entered. Thank you for looking and sharing the day with me, Jen and Jason. I will always remember the look on Jen's face when she saw Jason's ring finger.  If you order photos from my gallery, i have set a delay to approve the images since the lab might require you to crop the image. You can call me at 818.888.2280 if you have any questions about your photos.  Of course, I welcome referrals if you know any one getting married or that wants a portrait session for Boudior, Maternity, Babies and Family Portraits. If you refer me, then you can earn free prints from this event. I also offer a gift registry if you would like to buy prints as a gift for Jen and Jason!   Please feel free to call me at 818.888.2280 or email me at kathy@flashfrozenphotography.com",
