        "text": "I get the best press releases. This one came through just now. Pictures and captions (thanks to the publicist!) after the jump. He's seen on the show performing two songs -- and Snoop-i-fied the theme song too!\n\n\"I've been a fan of One Life to Live since I was a baby,\" said Snoop Dogg. \"My momma always had it on the tube in the crib growing up. The opportunity to change up the theme song and give it some of my flavor will make the show the 'Life of the Party.'\"\n\nMore from the email:\n\nOn May 8 and 9, Snoop Dogg makes an appearance in Llanview, Pennsylvania on ABC Daytime’s One Life to Live when he drops in on the bachlorette party of “Adriana Lord” (actress Melissa Gallo, second from right with husband to be “Rex Balsom” actor John-Paul Lavoisier, far left.)\n\n(Click for more...)\n\nWhile at the Ultra Violet club party location, Snoop runs into old pal, “Bo Buchanan,” (Robert S. Woods, to Snoop’s left) who, according to the script, gave Snoop his first acting job on the Llanview soap-within-a-soap, “Fraternity Row.”\n\nAlso pictured: (from left) “Layla Williamson” (Tika Sumpter), and “Sara Roberts” (Justis Bolding).\n\nDuring the show, Snoop Dogg perform his hit single, \"Sensual Seduction,\" as well as \"Life of Da Party,\" from his 9th solo studio album, Ego Trippin', (released March 11 on Doggystyle/Geffen Records). In addition to his appearance on the show, the rapper put his own spin on the One Life to Live theme song for the two episodes in which he will appear.\n\n-- Annie Zaleski"
