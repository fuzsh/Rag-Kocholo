Product detailed description

Scarface: The World Is Yours is an action-adventure game developed by Radical Entertainment and published by Vivendi Universal Games for PlayStation 2 in 2006. The game is inspired by the 1983 cult film Scarface and is an alternate continuation of the story of Tony Montana, the main protagonist of the film. Unlike the film's ending, Tony survives an attack on his mansion and embarks on a journey to reclaim his empire and exact revenge on his enemies.

Story and Gameplay

The game's story begins just after the attack on Tony's mansion, where the player takes on the role of Tony Montana and must rebuild his drug empire from scratch. Players can navigate an open world that includes different parts of Miami and the adjacent islands, where they complete various missions including drug dealing, settling scores with enemies, and corrupting officials.

The gameplay combines elements of a third-person shooter with an open world where players are free to explore the environment, take part in shootouts and drive various vehicles. The game also features a reputation system where players must increase Tony's respect by completing quests and securing the loyalty of their allies. A special feature of the game is the "Rage" mode, which makes Tony temporarily invulnerable and increases the effectiveness of his attacks.
