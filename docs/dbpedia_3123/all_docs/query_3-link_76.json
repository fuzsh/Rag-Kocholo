        "text": "Great game, But the GTA 3 port certainly had more play-testing, Compared to VC with its 'Publicity Tour' mission having a bugged ending if you fail the mission, This has led to me accidentally doing 2 missions at once and corrupting my first save file. Look out for the occasional bugs, But would still recommend. Currently at the Buisness missions before the final one ('Keep your Friends Close...') and I havent found any others.\n\nWould like to note down that the GTA mobile ports\n\non M1 Macs require a controller, Which makees the game run like the PS2 versions.\n\nEdit:\n\nCan confirm the whole game works now, I have finsihed GTA VC and can tell you that 'Publicity Tour' is the only mission you might find any bugs that could ruin your run-through unless you get really indepth with the game.\n\nThis GTA can run on both PS5 and PS4 Controllers from my experience. I dont know about Xbox Controllers but they should work.\n\nBeautiful graphics, fast paced and intense yet smooth gameplay, excellent soundtrack consisting of some of the electric 80s greatest hits and an engaging character and story line.\n\nâ¥ï¸ I love this game. It really brings out the heart in Grand Theft Auto. â¥ï¸\n\nMe personally, and you can call me what you want, I've spent almost 56 hours on this game. I've ð¯% completed it and I can promise you that every main mission and side mission is well put together and very engaging.\n\nRay Liotta did an amazing job whilst voicing Tommy Vercetti. He plays a likable, quick-witted and temperamental Italian American scarface-style gangster who wants more out of life than running around for those in higher places. Tommy is definitely my favorite Grand Theft Auto protagonist so far.\n\nThe city is bustling with activity and personality, every man or woman walking the streets has their own dialogue and story, giving the game a realistic feel. The cars are stylish and shiny and every engine purrs like a kitten. The golden beaches stretch for miles and the waters are still and blue. The buildings are tall and colorful whilst the echoing sound of muffled music from nearby nightclubs blasts through the city.\n\nI just loved every second of every hour that I put into this game and I thank Rockstar for bringing it to iOS. Keep it up Rockstar.\n\nI loved this game 12 years ago when I first played it and this conversion is great. You have to be willing to play around with the settings and control layout but it works fine once you do, I've found a few missions I remember less awkward this time round. It has one of the best soundtracks, characters and story lines of any of the GTAs with a cast list you'd expect from a Hollywood blockbuster. Like all GTAs you have loads of side missions and stuff to find and although it shows it's age when compared to GTA 4 and 5 it's still a pleasure to play through. Given the pace at which mobile/tablet tech is advancing I can't wait to see GTA4 and Red Dead Redemption hit the market and looking at the progress Rockstar has made at converting games to touchscreen I have every faith they will do it brilliantly."
