        "text": "Scarface The World Is Yours Problem. Please Help!\n\nDoes anyone still have the old game Scarface The World Is Yours on PC snd still able to play it on modern PC's? I still have my CD copy but I can't play it. If I can get it to install on my computer like I just tried to do, the game starts up but when I actually start playing it the graphics are all disoriented like your looking at the game through one of those stained glass origami scopes or whatever those things are called. However now I can't even get the game to install, the setup just stops or freezes. I tried installing it on my Windows 10 laptop which used to have Windows 7 so it's an old machine. I have been able to intsall it on this machine before but I just got that graphics problem. I also have a Windows 8 desktop. I haven't tried installing it on that compyter recently but I have before and it still has the same graphics issue. Has anybody had that same problem and if so found out a way to fix it. I haven't played this game in years and I really want to play it again so can anyone help me please?"
