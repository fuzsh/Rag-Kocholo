        "text": "There are actually a lot more Predator games than most people seem to realize. It’s not that surprising once you consider that the titular creature has become an iconic character rivaling the likes of the Universal Monsters, but folks tend to only remember its crossovers with the Alien franchise when it comes to gaming.\n\nNevertheless, since the mid-80s, the Predator has been constantly present in interactive media, even gaining a completely new online game through IllFonic’s Predator: Hunting Grounds late last month. Today, however, I’d like to take a step back and discuss one of the weirdest interactive experiments of the franchise’s past, a flawed but unique gem known only as Eurocom’s Predator: Concrete Jungle.\n\nStrangely enough, this genre-bending 2005 title is influenced a lot more by the under-appreciated Predator 2 than Schwarzenegger’s original encounter with the extraterrestrial hunter. Instead of mercenary-infested tropical rainforests, Concrete Jungle boasts sprawling urban environments more reminiscent of a futuristic New York rather than anything in South America. Nevertheless, we’re getting ahead of ourselves, as Concrete Jungle’s setup to this new environment is a curious thing in and of itself.\n\nThe game’s story actually begins in 1930s “New Way City”, as folks have been dealing with gang wars in the middle of a heatwave. The situation is only made worse by the presence of a certain “New Way Devil”, an otherworldly being hellbent on eliminating crime boss Bruno Borgia. Here, players take control of an unlucky Predator whose hunting trip is about to go terribly wrong.\n\nTo make a long story short, our protagonist is wounded (earning the nickname “Scarface” in the process) and is forced to enable the self-destruct function of his cloaked starship. Unfortunately, he’s too far away from the blast to be obliterated alongside most of the city, making him a pariah amongst his fellow Predators.\n\nAnd so, 100 years of exile later, the game truly begins as Scarface is informed that New Way City has been rebuilt as Neonopolis, where Borgia’s descendants have been using technology recovered from his little hunting accident to capture and experiment on other Predators. Returning to Earth to set things right, players embark on a perilous journey through futuristic landscapes, taking down criminals and collecting blood-soaked trophies from an assortment of grandiose levels, eventually squaring off against Xenomorphs, cyborgs and horrific genetic hybrids.\n\nI don’t know about you, but to me, this sounds like the setup to the greatest Predator movie never made. The sheer batshit insanity of it all only makes sense once you realize that the game was written by comic book auteur Grant Morrison, who’s best known for his new-age take on titles like Animal Man and Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth.\n\nRegrettably, the story and setting are the only stars of the show here, as the rest of the game doesn’t quite live up to the promises made by such a wild plot. While the ambition behind this title is commendable, with platforming, third-person shooting, stealth sections and hand-to-hand combat existing side-by-side in sprawling levels, the truth is that nearly every aspect of the game’s mechanics feels clunky and unpolished.\n\nThe controls are hard to get used to, the animations are unresponsive and there’s a constant feeling that the developers didn’t have a unifying vision while programming these levels. In theory, roaming around gigantic (for the time) cityscapes as a camouflaged Predator, collecting spinal cords and brutally murdering gangsters, should be a movie buff’s wet dream, but in practice, it’s really just a lot of boring ledge-grabbing in dull gray environments as you occasionally stealth attack a guard and watch one of a handful of possible executions.\n\nThat being said, playing around with the Predator’s massive arsenal can be fun, and I never got tired of hilariously skewering enemies to the wall with futuristic spears. The extreme violence is really entertaining, as Scarface murders goons and civilians alike as casually as Jason Voorhees. I’ll also admit that, towards the end of the experience, once you have all possible weapons and have gotten used to the clunky controls, it’s easier to forgive the game’s flaws and just zone out as a lone alien hunter out to regain his honor.\n\nEven then, while the story is undeniably entertaining, some of the dialogue is downright laughable and Morrison was really milking that M-rating, as this is one of the sleaziest Predator stories out there. Hell, there’s even an enemy type that walks around in skimpy outfits, using reverse-engineered cloaking technology to hide their high-tech armor (not to mention a plethora of racial and sexual stereotypes that randomly pop up throughout the story).\n\nMoments like these make the game feel like a schlocky B-movie, but in all honesty, I think that’s the most appropriate way of approaching Concrete Jungle. I can’t quite recommend it as an actual good game, but there’s so much interesting stuff to see here that it’s at least worth searching for a let’s play of the title.\n\nI have conflicting memories of playing this on the PS2 back in the day and really wanting to love it because, in theory, it had everything that a Predator fan could want. I guess the running theme here is that everything about the game works far better on paper than in reality, but that doesn’t quite diminish its accomplishments. In fact, I’d love to see some new studio tackle a remake, or at the very least a remaster of the title.\n\nBut why stop there? A Just-Cause-styled open world sequel set in the deep jungle, with fortified military bases and villages to explore could also be incredibly entertaining. With more time and a modern toolset, I think it would be a lot easier to iron out all of the little quirks and finally deliver what Eurocom promised us fifteen years ago. For now, however, I think I’m ready to check out IllFonic’s new take on the franchise; though I doubt that game also boasts cyberpunk pimps and drug-dealers.\n\nWhen Ridley Scott unleashed Alien onto unsuspecting film fans way back in 1979, no one probably thought that the film would spawn a franchise that would take over the media landscape. Today, the franchise is still going strong, having conquered the box office, comics, novels, board games, action figures, and of course, video games.\n\nWith Fede Álvarez‘s Alien: Romulus set to invade theatres this week, it seems like a ripe opportunity to delve into the sea of video games that have spawned from the film franchise.\n\nReally, there are a lot of games, both official and not-so-official. So, to keep this concise, we’ll look at official games that are directly related to the Alien franchise, keeping the Alien vs. Predator titles separate (for now).\n\nAlien – Atari 2600 (1982)\n\nYou had to start somewhere, and for 20th Century Fox’s video game division, this was it. Designed by Doug Neubauer and borrowing liberally from Pac-Man, Alien for the 2600 has you running around the maze-like hallways of your space ship (no mention of whether this is the Nostromo, mind you), crushing all of the eggs while collecting items for points. Unfortunately, you’ve got a couple of Xenomorphs running around the ship, as well. You can either avoid them, or use the flamethrower to temporarily stun them. Or, if you can grab the Pulsar (three in each stage), this causes the Xenomorphs to weaken and turn blue. Running over them with your character will destroy them.\n\nNeedless to say, you can see where the Pac-Man accusations came from. Reviewers at the time noted this, but at the same time, also commented about the sense of panic when you’re being stalked by the Xenomorphs. That alone made the game somewhat attractive, but nowadays, you can do a lot better.\n\nAliens: The Computer Game – Commodore 64, Apple II, ZX Spectrum (1986)\n\nJumping to the 1986 James Cameron classic, Aliens: The Computer Game has a bit of an interesting history to it. Activision’s UK subsidiary Electric Dreams Software had independently released their own version of this game with the same title as a simple action game. As a result, Activision had to rename their game for the European market as Aliens: US Version.\n\nName change aside, unlike Electric Dreams Software’s version, which was a straightforward action game, Aliens: The Computer Game features six mini games which are tied together with dialogue and images from the film. Two of those are action sequences has the player finding their way through the complex on LV-426 using a squad of four marines. The other sequences involve landing the ship from the Sulaco, finding their way through an air duct maze, fending off waves of Aliens as Ripley, and ultimately confronting the Alien Queen. The reviewers at the time praised the presentation, but in comparison, the six minigames failed to match up. Commodore 64 purists will probably get more out of this than anyone else.\n\nAliens – Arcade (1990)\n\nBefore Capcom graced us with their awesome Aliens vs. Predator cabinet, Konami took a stab with the Aliens license, and came up with a winner. Players either controlled a blonde-haired(!) Ripley or Corporal Hicks as they make their way through Hadley’s Hope, blasting through Xenomorphs until coming face to face with the Alien Queen.\n\nStill fun to play to this day, Aliens does take a bit of artistic license when it comes to the Xenomorphs and the events of the film. You start out with a Smart Gun, but can upgrade to a flamethrower, missile launcher, or a 3-way shot that calls back to Contra. Speaking of Contra, there are moments where you shift perspective, having you face off against bosses who are coming from the top of the screen. There’s also a similar shift during the stages where you’re on top of an APC shooting down Xenomorphs. And yes, the boss battle against the Alien Queen inside the power loader is here, with you working to throw the Queen out via the airlock.\n\nAlien 3 – Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy, Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Gear (1993)\n\nFollowing the storyline of the film, Ripley’s ship crashes on the prison colony planet Fiorina 161. There, she and the unarmed prisoners have to figure out a way to survive the Xenomorphs terrorizing the colony until help arrives. As Ripley, players must navigate through the maze-like levels rescuing prisoners while fending off Xenomorphs. You’re timed while doing so, and you’ll have to rely on computers throughout the levels to figure out where the prisoners are. Not to mention that you’ll need to be quick on the trigger with the aliens, as they’re fast.\n\nIt’s unfortunately easy at times to lose direction as to where you’ll need to go in order to exit the level, and the mentioned quickness of the Xenomorphs can make killing them frustrating (not to mention difficult to avoid being hit). Still, Alien 3 is a great side-scrolling platformer once you figure out your strategy. Each version of Alien 3 is slightly different, offering up different levels and layouts for each platform. Unlike the rest of the ports, the Game Boy version is played from an overhead perspective.\n\nAlien 3: The Gun – Arcade (1993)\n\nLong before Sega tackled the Alien franchise in the 2010s, they had come up with this unique take on the Alien 3 story. Focusing on neither Ripley or Hicks, you are part of a squad of marines that was sent to investigate why the Sulcao hadn’t returned from the end of Aliens. What you find on board is an infestation of Xenomorphs, which quickly decimate the squad until only two unnamed marines (aka you and a friend) are left. After cleaning out the ship, you crash land on Fiorina “Fury” 161, which has also become a hive. Once again, it’s bug stomping time.\n\nGenerous liberties with the source material aside, Alien 3: The Gun is a fun experience. You’re obviously on rails, and starting out on the Sulaco navigating the corridors blasting Xenomorphs, facehuggers and eggs never gets old. Particularly in part due to the over-the-top way the Xenomorphs are blown apart, leaving limbs and torsos wriggling as they litter the deck. It only continues from there in the game’s six stages. You can also take alternate paths in the game to give things a bit of variety. Strong animation, plenty of action and excellent sound design are topped off with a rather bleak ending (it’s not the film’s ending, for sure) that’s only fitting for capping off the-then trilogy of films.\n\nAliens: A Comic Book Adventure – PC (1995)\n\nMindscape’s entry turns the story focus to the Dark Horse Comics series for A Comic Book Adventure, borrowing themes from the four-issue Aliens: Labyrinth series that ran from September 1993-January 1994. You play as Lt. Col. Hericksen, an ex-colonial marine who is now the commander of a three-man terraforming team. After receiving a distress call coming from the remote outpost B54-C, Hericksen travels to the planet in order to investigate.\n\nA Comic Book Adventure is your standard point-and-click adventure title, with a few inventory-based puzzles. You’ll also engage in a bit of grid-based combat, which is tedious, to say the least. Probably the most contentious aspect of the game are the timed puzzles and objectives, which were (and still are) a source of frustration. The CGI art still holds up (despite much of it being static images), but these days, you’re probably better off watching a “Let’s Play” video and experiencing the game that way.\n\nAlien Trilogy – Saturn, PC, PlayStation (1996)\n\nDespite Alien vs. Predator on the Jaguar beating it out of the gate, Alien Trilogy has aged far better than the former. Based on and combining elements from the first three movies, Alien Trilogy casts you as Ripley as you make your way through LV426 to restore contact with the colony. The colony is obviously now infested with Xenomorphs, so Ripley must clean house. Eventually, you make your way through the colony to the prison facility, then finally arriving at the derelict alien spaceship to battle the Queen.\n\nCapturing the isolation and the fear that Alien fans wanted, Alien Trilogy still holds up today with the gameplay, despite the awkward control scheme and rather linear level design. Regardless of what difficulty setting you choose, the challenge ramps up pretty quickly, particularly with the enemies respawning in the higher difficulty settings. While purists might pull their hair out at the mangled storyline, what’s here is an okay effort. The DOS version had the edge over the PlayStation and Saturn versions by including multiplayer.\n\nAliens Online – PC (1998)\n\nSpeaking of multiplayer, Mythic Entertainment developed a massively multiplayer first-person shooter with Aliens Online that either put you in the boots of a marine sent in for a bug hunt, or as a member of the alien hive. Aliens Online offered up asymmetric teams, but you could only unlock the more powerful weapons if you were part of a squad. The game also had RPG elements, where in addition to being able to choose your class, you gained points per kills for increasing your rank as a marine. Or, as a Xenomorph, each kill you got closer to evolving into the Empress, which was the rank higher than the Queen.\n\nDespite the cool premise, Aliens Online was a bit rough around the edges. The interface was cramped with your viewing field and the team chat, and there were balancing issues. Plus, as a xenomorph, you couldn’t climb walls! Aliens Online was free to download, but required players to joining the online gaming service GameStorm for $9.95 per month. Sadly, the servers were shut down in 2000 after GameStorm was sold to Electronic Arts.\n\nAlien Resurrection – PlayStation (2000)\n\nFollowing the same plot of the movie, the cloned Ellen Ripley awakens aboard the USM Auriga, which has become infested with Xenomorphs. Together with a group of mercenaries, Ripley must make her way through the ship, wipe out the infestation, and return the ship safely to Earth.\n\nWhile Ripley is the main playable character for much of the game, you do get to play as Call, DiStephano, and Christie, with all four having their own unique weapon layouts. Ironically, Alien Resurrection was panned at the time for its control scheme, which looking back, was one of the first games to use both analogue sticks for simultaneous movement and aiming, beating out Halo for the modern FPS control scheme for a controller. Much like Alien Trilogy, Alien Resurrection nailed the atmosphere and isolation, but also had a jump in difficulty.\n\nAliens: Thanatos Encounter – Game Boy Color (2001)\n\nAliens: Thanatos Encounter is a standalone story inspired by Aliens. The story concerns a platoon of Colonial Marines that while en route to Earth from a training mission, are awakened from hypersleep by a distress signal from the space freighter Thanatos. Ordered to board the massive ship and investigate the situation, they discover the freighter is infested with xenomorphs. The platoon must now clear the ship of hostiles and rescue any survivors.\n\nReleased late in the Game Boy Color’s life, Thanatos Encounter crams quite a bit onto the cartridge. While the sound and music aren’t the best, developer Crawfish Interactive managed to get some good graphical fidelity out of the tiny screen. You can select from five different marines, each with varying stats. Thanatos Encounter uses a simple control scheme, where the A and B buttons correspond to the guns in your marine’s left and right hands. Yes, you can dual wield pulse rifles or smart guns, if you choose. While it’s a pretty run-of-the-mill shooter, Thanatos Encounter still offers up some fun, if straightforward, gameplay for Aliens fans.\n\nAliens: Extermination – Arcade (2006)\n\nOnce again using Aliens as its basis, Aliens: Extermination is a 3D light gun shooter taking place on LV-426, where the colony has been destroyed. An insertion team sent to the colony has not responded, and an infestation is suspected. You have been sent to exterminate the Xenomorphs, and search for the insertion team.\n\nYour tried-and-true rail shooter, Aliens: Extermination moves the player automatically as you mow down Xenomorphs, eggs, facehuggers and synthetics with your pulse rifle and grenades, though you can also get a flamethrower or missile launcher for extra firepower. The game offers a total of four missions, with plenty of frantic action that’s not too difficult, but having extra tokens and a friend to help you makes things a little easier. Watch out for innocents getting caught in the crossfire!\n\nAliens: Infestation – Nintendo DS (2011)\n\nDeveloped by the folks at WayForward, Infestation uses Aliens as inspiration for its story, where you once again follow a group of Colonial Marines. When the USS Sephora discovers the USS Sulaco adrift after the events of the film, a squad of Colonial Marines are sent aboard to investigate. Not only do the marines find a Xenomorph infestation aboard the ship, but also a group of Union of Progressive Peoples (UPP) soldiers, who don’t take too kindly to the Colonial Marines’ presence.\n\nA combination of a Metroidvania and FPS, Infestation was clearly a labour of love for WayForward. Each of the marines has their own unique dialogue, which makes losing them a kick in the face, since it’s hard not to become attached to them. Coupled with a fan-pleasing story that includes elements from William Gibson‘s unproduced Alien 3 script (namely the UPP) and some excellent sprite work, Infestation is let down only by the linearity of the levels. Still, given that this was developed alongside Colonial Marines, this is a far better game.\n\nAliens: Colonial Marines – PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 (2013)\n\nAnd speaking of which, Aliens: Colonial Marines takes place after the events of the film, where the player takes control of the United States Colonial Marine Christopher Winter. Winter is part of a search and rescue team that has to investigate the space ship U.S.S. Sulaco and what remains of Hadley’s Hope to find out what has happened to the team that was sent to LV-426. The team arrives on the space ship U.S.S. Sephora, only to find it infested with Xenomorphs. The ensuring battle has the remaining marines take shelter in the ruins of the Hadley’s Hope colony complex on LV-426.\n\nThe nightmarish development of Colonial Marines has been long documented, along with the shenanigans that went on at Gearbox during this time, and the game’s eventual release. The result of all of this was Colonial Marines having crippling performance issues (despite early demos demonstrating the contrary), inept AI that was eventually fixed by a modder by correcting a typo in the code, large plot-holes in the story and weak writing (despite the supposedly canonical events that were endorsed by 20th Century Fox), and generally lacklustre gameplay. When the behind-the-scenes stories from developers are more entertaining than the game itself, you know you need to avoid this one.\n\nAlien: Isolation – PS4, Xbox One, PC, PS3, Xbox 360, Switch (2019)\n\nFifteen years after the events of Ridley Scott’s Alien, Ellen Ripley’s daughter Amanda is looking for answers. Working as an engineer for Weiland-Yutani Corporation, she finds out that the logs from USCSS Nostromo have been located and transported to the Sevastopol space station. She decides to join a small crew sent by Weiland-Yutani to retrieve the data. However, the ship that found the logs that reached Sevastopol also contained a Xenomorph, which has murdered the majority of station’s population.\n\nWe wouldn’t be able to live it down if we didn’t mention this one. Isolation perfectly captures the atmosphere of Ridley Scott’s original film with its graphics, along with the fear of being pursued by the Xenomorph. The AI was programmed with a complex set of behavioural designs that slowly unlock as it encounters the player, creating the illusion that it learns from each interaction. While criticism can be levelled at the lack of growth in Isolation‘s characters, the sheer terror you feel in this game hits you on a personal level that not many other survival horror titles can claim.\n\nAliens: Fireteam Elite – PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, PC, Xbox Series (2021)\n\nFireteam Elite is set 23 years after the original trilogy. You’re a member of a fireteam of Colonial Marines aboard the USS Endeavor. When you receive a distress call from the Katanga refinery station orbiting the planet LV-895, your team is sent to investigate. You discover that the refinery is infested with Xenomorphs. After rescuing the sole survivor, it’s revealed that Weyland-Yutani have been secretly breeding Xenomorphs and experimenting with a mysterious mutagenic substance before the Xenomorphs broke containment. Your team heads to LV-895 to investigate and clean up.\n\nWhile it never reaches the height and staying power of the co-op action you’d find in Left 4 Dead (though that’s an admittedly high benchmark), Fireteam Elite is still a fun romp. Cold Iron Studios nailed the atmosphere and tension of Aliens, despite its story not really bringing anything new to the overall Alien universe. The game appears to have done well enough that Cold Iron Studios is rumoured to be working on a sequel.\n\nAliens: Dark Descent – PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, Xbox Series (2023)\n\nOnce again set after the original trilogy of films, Dark Descent puts you in command of a squad of Colonial Marines. On the moon of Lethe, the shuttle Bentonville drops off cargo at Pioneer Station that turns out to contain Xenomorphs, which massacre the station’s crew. After activating the Cerberus Protocol that destroys the Bentonville, a freighter, and cripples the nearby Colonial Marine frigate, the USS Otago, Deputy Administrator Maeko Hayes is extracted by Sgt. Jonas Harper and his squad of Colonial Marines to Lethe. The group must now deal not only with the Xenomorph outbreak on Lethe, but also rogue agents from the Weyland-Yutani Corporation.\n\nSimilar to Fireteam Elite‘s take on co-op shooters, Aliens: Dark Descent doesn’t offer up much new for strategy fans, but what’s here is still some excellent tension, particularly when you’re facing off against a seemingly endless horde of Xenomorphs. The mechanic of having to deal with your squad’s mental fortitude is a nice touch, as is the idea of changes you make in the level potentially affecting your route later on. The high difficulty of Dark Descent may be a turn off for some players, while console players might take offence at the control scheme when compared to their PC counterparts."
