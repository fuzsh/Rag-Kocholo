        "text": "MaurickShepherd419,221\n\n06 Dec 2017 12 Dec 2017\n\n18 0 0\n\nFive years ago was the last time the Ghosts came out from hiding in Ghost Recon: Future Soldier. The modern take on war was swapped out for the titular warfare years beyond. The reception was generally positive, but mixed: some praised its weapon customization and improved cover-based combat, many criticized the oversimplification of the tactical aspect longtime fans have come to know Ghost Recon for. I thought it landed somewhere in the middle for me; a good game in general, perhaps not the best Ghost Recon game. So in response, Ubisoft decided to up the ante by making the battlefield not just a field, but a country.\n\nIn Ghost Recon: Wildlands, you take over the leader of a team of ghosts as they travel to an unstable Bolivia during the summer of 2019. The South American country has become a narco state, producing more cocaine than any other nation in the world. The U.S. aren't terribly interested in any of it until one of its embassies in La Paz, a region within Bolivia, is bombed, and one of their embedded agents, Ricky Sanderval, is found dead. In comes the world's deadliest unit no one but us gamers have ever heard of: the ghosts.\n\nThe only times you really get a glimpse of the story is through videos uploaded to you from your operation boss, Karen Bowman. These videos are visually appealing, but are lacking in compelling storytelling. In spots you will be reminded of why you're in Bolivia and why the cartel must be stopped, but the main story failed to deliver in keeping me hooked in caring for it or anyone in the game but one, which I will address shortly.\n\nMost of the story is better told through the innumerable amounts of collectibles found throughout the map. Whether it's Santa Muerte shrines, historic locations in the mountainsides or random documents scattered around cartel edifices, reading through these definitely gave me more valuable and interesting information than any of the videos of cartel members did.\n\nOutside of these cartel members, there is one person you will learn more about as you carry on with the game: Sanderval, the agent killed in action. His side of the story should be compelling, and without spoiling anything, the information you get from collectibles that detail the beginning and end of the late CIA operative are actually brilliant and add a twist to the procedurals.\n\nNow, that last word is probably the most damning criticism I have of this game; procedural. The amount of content in this game isn't bad at all, there's quite a lot to do. The issue is many of this content is rehashed across the map. The collectibles are understandable, but the repeated side quests are incomprehensible.\n\nThese side quests consist of quick 2-5 minute operations that either help you upgrade you and your squadmates or the rebel support you can call in. The issue with the former is that there are literally only two types of cache-involved sidequests: helicopter deliveries or plane deliveries. Both are fun the first few times, raiding a makeshift helipad or airstrip and flying said aircraft to the rebels, but quickly become repetitive. Worst are the latter of the quests. The upgrade branches can be maxed out, but even after you do so, the quests continue to pop up with no real use. They're repetitive to the point where I could only do one region a day or else I would have nearly died from boredom.\n\nLuckily, my interest was held together by the game's vast environments of snow-capped mountains, vegetation-stuffed forests and rolling hills. It's a great looking game. Often I found myself standing on the edge of a cliff that gave me a view over several kilometers of lush nature. The best part is, as was detailed heavily in the E3 presentation for this game, what you see you can go to. It's nice to finally have a game where I can do just that.\n\nThe gameplay is tight, with the vast array of weapons all feeling weighted and full of oomph. I enjoyed trying out all the dozens of guns. The customization we all liked in Future Soldier makes a great return, with hundreds of possible customization patterns available just to one gun. So if you're a gun nut, this game might trip your trigger.\n\nIn the end, I wrapped up the game feeling a bit tired. I came in wanting an open world tactical shooter, and what I felt I got was mostly that, but perhaps was just too much quantity and not enough quality. For me, this game will be a good back up to play in spurts of time, especially with a group of friends. While the game is supposed to make us feel like the world's deadliest special forces, you often feel like Bolivia's most talented chore artist. It's an open world game you can't enjoy in long sit downs, and that's something I can't understand given open world games are meant to capture our imagination and immersion, not remind us we're playing a game. While this Ghost Recon game is far from bad, it is once again a far cry from what the series was established by: tactical combat. Perhaps Ubisoft can get it right four years down the road, but in the mean time, Wildlands remains a solid third person shooter that will take a chunk of your time to complete, for better and worse.\n\n4.0\n\nbenthefletch204,979\n\n17 Feb 2018\n\n6 2 0\n\nWhile I have not played any other installments of the Ghost Recon series something in the advertising of this game caught my eye weather it was the setting or the villain displayed. In this game you are one of four US soldiers deployed in Bolivia to stop a drug cartel that has grown so powerful it practically controls the country through influence and security.\n\nThe Story\n\nAs explained you play as one of four special ops soldiers or \"Ghosts\" in Bolivia. Your task; take down El Sueno the leader of the cartel that assumed control of the South American nation. In order to stop him you must take down the chain of command in his cartel all spread throughout the country. El Sueno has leaders that help with Security, Influence, Production and Smuggling all of which allow his rule to flourish. There's around 5-6 leaders for each area making a total of around 24 leaders to take out. All of these leaders are quite unique in personality and found myself very interested in these leaders, more so than the actual cartel leader. Your character on the other hand has no personality however this is forgivable due to the military setting of the game and how these soldiers are trained.\n\nThe setting for this game is very unique especially in a genre so saturated with Russia, the Middle East and Europe in terms of settings. Bolivia is such a diverse country in terms of environments, forest, desert, jungle, mountains even the world's largest Salt Lake Wildlands is definitely not lacking in variety when it comes to its world.\n\nStory - 9/10\n\nThe Gameplay\n\nOnto the most divisive part of this game. The gameplay in terms of actual play is nice and smooth. Being a shooter gun play defiantly needs to be good, the variety in weapons and attachments makes this even greater. Gun play in my opinion is perfect. However where do we start with everything else. First of all the missions in this game get repetitive very fast for both main and side quests. There's stop a convoy, kill a commander, steal a car or person. The Story makes these missions interesting however that should be no excuse for the repetitive gameplay. Being an openworld Ubisoft game there is of course collectables which give me reason to explore it's landscape which I can't complain at.\n\nHaving Ghost in the title stealth plays a big aspect of this game, using silencers or going loud provide two different play styles. However I find the stealth aspect quite buggy, it's your typical the AI know you're there but can't reveal that they know you're there do they purposely walk around your location. There is also an upgrade system which early on proves to be quite interesting but after you sort your playstyle out these upgrades become a second thought.\n\nThe player customisation of this game is very in depth and it must be commended for the variety of clothing a colours you can put on your character. Your AI teammates are trash, many times they just stand there, there's this mechanic called synch shot to make then useful however it is very buggy. This game was made for coop however and that is apparent with the advertising of the game, playing with games makes this game alot better.\n\nGameplay - 6/10\n\nOther\n\nI have ran into bugs in this game that have negatively affected me. Mainly a bug where the fps drops after the occasional explosion. There is also a 4 v 4 gamemode, it's nice that it's there however it's pretty dead which is understandable as the gameplay is very clunky. There is also two dlcs for this game which add pretty much more of the same. There is however a Predator mission which was a nice change of pace for the game. Plus the achievements are easy to obtain making this a simple game in terms of score.\n\nOther - 7/10\n\nGhost Recon Wildlands is a fun third person shooter that was made for coop. The many side features of this game provide a fun experience however it can get repetitive at times. The villains of this game definitely steal the show.\n\nThe Good - Story, co-op, setting, variety in playstyles\n\nThe Bad - Repetitive Gameplay, Unpatched Bugs, Bad verses multiplayer.\n\nOverall - 7.5/10\n\n3.5\n\nBobbyChez525,373\n\n27 Mar 2017 28 Mar 2017\n\n12 9 8\n\nI like Ghost Recon: Wildlands, but the completionist in me is a bit more torn about it.\n\nThe game is good. It plays well and the gun and shooting mechanics are great. The map is massive and invites you to explore and experience as much as Bolivia that you can. It was awesome to see something like a mountain at the horizon and realize, I could go there and get to the top of it. The draw distance is pretty damn impressive and I experienced a minimal number of slow downs for load times when moving from province to province.\n\nHowever, for a shooter, this game is long. It should have been about half as long as it is. I understand you can \"finish\" the game at about the halfway point, but it is just not as satisfying. Because of the length of the game and sheer number of side missions, the missions get repetitive. There are some types that are fun to play that only show up once or twice, but most missions break down to go here, recon the area, and then kill or extract an enemy or scan or blow up an item.\n\nIn addition, the side missions you play to unlock rebels skills are the same mission type over and over again. After you unlock the rebel skills, there is no need to play these missions anymore, but they keep appearing on the map. It would be nice if the game was designed to award you with resources for completing these additional side missions. Instead you have to go through the grind of hunting down the appropriate convoys to max out all of your skills.\n\nAnyways, here is what I found to be the Pros and Cons of Ghost Recon: WIldlands:\n\nPros:\n\n- The game looks awesome.\n\n- The game plays well, especially the gun and shooting mechanics.\n\n- Fun to explore and play around in the massive sandbox of Bolivia.\n\nCons:\n\n- Vehicle controls, especially helicopters, are clunky and can be difficult to adjust to.\n\n- In my opinion, the game is too long for a shooter.\n\n- To an extent, the missions get repetitive.\n\nIf you are not worried about completion percentage and want to play and just have fun with up to 3 friends in 4-player co-op, this is a pretty good game to do it in. I'd recommend it for the exploration and gameplay alone. Ubisoft did a lot right in this game.\n\nIf you are planning to go for all achievements in the game or worry about completion percentage, I suggest marking off a bunch of time on your game playing calendar to get through the game. It might be best for a summer play through when not much else is coming out. I wouldn't necessarily recommend the game if you do not want to invest about 3 days of playtime in it.\n\nHope that helps you decide if you want to play it or not. Let me know if there is anything I can answer that might help you with the game.\n\n3.5"
