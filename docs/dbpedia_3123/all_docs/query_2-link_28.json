Now, three decades after he first became the Godfather, Marlon Brando sounds a bit tentative.     ''I'm, uh, I'm sad,'' the voice says. ''I'm sad to hear that you have not yet done what I asked of you. Maybe Tom could help you to complete that small favor of mine. You know, you failed to earn my respect.''",

        "text": "THE voice has lost its ease. It is strained and full of effort. Once upon a time, the nasal articulation and reluctant delivery were the sounds of authority. Now, three decades after he first became the Godfather, Marlon Brando sounds a bit tentative.\n\n\"I'm, uh, I'm sad,\" the voice says. \"I'm sad to hear that you have not yet done what I asked of you. Maybe Tom could help you to complete that small favor of mine. You know, you failed to earn my respect.\"\n\nIn a windowless room just south of San Francisco, Ken Felton, a sound director, turned away from his four computer screens. \"We didn't have much time with Brando before he died,\" he said during a visit last month, \"but he really gave us a lot of insight into the mind of the don, into the essence of his character. And in trying to understand the don, in trying to understand 'The Godfather' universe, it really does all come down to the concept of respect.\"\n\nIt comes down to the concept of respect a lot these days on the fourth floor of Electronic Arts' sprawling development complex in Redwood City, Calif. That is where more than 100 artists, programmers and designers are engaged in one of the year's most ambitious entertainment projects: turning the much lauded world of \"The Godfather\" into a video game due in living rooms this fall.\n\nCertainly, accumulating respect will be a key part of the game play. (The team's internal distillation of the game is: \"Join the Family. Earn Respect. Become the Godfather.\") But more broadly, the Godfather team seems to be approaching this multimillion-dollar project as a high-stakes opportunity to earn some respect not only for itself but also for the entire notion of gaming.\n\nWhat ultimately sets gaming apart from prefabricated media like television and books is that the consumer is in control of the action; the consumer is the protagonist of whatever story the game might tell. So rather than slavishly direct the player through a linear recreation of the first \"Godfather\" film, the E.A. team is essentially using the famous scenes and characters to create a wide-ranging virtual universe in which players can create their own narratives.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
