        "text": "1983\n\nCity Locations\n\nMiami, Los Angeles (USA)\n\nLocation Types\n\nMansions, House, Clubs/Bars, Restaurant\n\nLocation Styles\n\nDated/50's-60's-70's, Art Deco, Beachfront, Modern Building\n\nAbout Scarface\n\nScarface is an American crime film from 1983 directed by Brian De Palma. It stars Al Pacino, Robert Loggia, Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. The movie depicts the story of Tony Montana (portrayed by Pacino), a Cuban refugee who succeeds as a drug lord in Miami before eventually experiencing a downfall. After arriving in the US, Tony embarks on a quest for wealth and power with the help of his friend Manny Ray (Steven Bauer), eventually taking control of the local drug trade. However, along the way he makes enemies who threaten to take down his empire.\n\nWhen it was released, critics praised the film's visual style and performances. It was nominated for three awards at the 41st Golden Globe Awards, including Best ActorâMotion Picture Drama (Al Pacino), Best Supporting ActorâMotion Picture (Steven Bauer), and Best Original Score (Giorgio Moroder).\n\nMoreover, although Pacino was already a successful and well-known actor, Scarface played a significant role in launching the careers of Pfeiffer and Mastrantonio. Before their roles in the film, they were relatively unknown actors who later achieved independent success. Scarface is now considered an iconic cult classic that has become a cornerstone of modern gangster films.\n\nScarface Locations\n\nScarface is a classic crime drama set in Miami, Florida, and Bolivia. Most scenes were filmed in California, with two prominent locations in Montecito. Casa Bienvenida and El Fureidis served as the luxurious estate of the drug lord Sosa (Robert Loggia) and Tony Montana's home, respectively.\n\nMontecito is an enclave of Santa Barbara County full of stunning natural beauty and Mediterranean climate. Located just a few miles east of Santa Barbara, beautiful mountains, lush gardens, and seaside cliffs create the perfect backdrop for Scarface. Casa Bienvenida gives off the vibes of a splendid palace, while El Fureidis captures the essence of paradise. Both estates offer 10 acres of enchanting grounds. Even though neither estate is open to public visitors, anyone can still appreciate them from afar, marveling at their beauty from a distance or participating in an organized Scarface tour around town!\n\nTraveling to the locations for Scarface can be a worthwhile experience for any fan or film enthusiast. There is plenty to discover about what went into making this iconic movie come alive on-screen.\n\nManny and Chi Chi (Ãngel Salazar) stay in the car on the street while Tony and Angel (Pepe Serna) meet Hector (Al Israel) in the hotel room. The meeting doesn't go well as Hector is slow to exchange the cocaine for money, and Tony grows impatient. Hector uses a chainsaw to dismember Angel in a shower stall as a threat to get Tony to pay up. Just as Tony is about to meet the same fate, Chi Chi and Manny arrive and shoot down Hector's henchmen in time to save him.\n\nThe scene involving a chainsaw was shot in a set located at Sound Stage 12 in Universal City Studios in Los Angeles. Universal Studios is open to tourists, so you can easily visit the site.\n\nYou can take the 101 freeway (Hollywood Freeway) southbound from downtown Los Angeles until you reach Universal Studios Hollywood Drive exit to get to this location. The drive is a journey of around 10 miles.\n\nThe scene showcases the spectacular luxury of Frank's (Robert Loggia) lifestyle. The mansion at W Matheson Dr is where Tony finds Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer) descending from a lift and then proposes on the pool deck. It takes place at the luxurious house of Frank Lopez, which has a stunningly beautiful pool deck overlooking the ocean. It's a serene setting, and something almost magical about it makes it the perfect place for Tony to propose.\n\nThe filming location for the interiors of the Frank Lopez house was 485 W Matheson Drive in Key Biscayne in Florida. All the scenes were shot there, including those featuring Tony looking up at the Goodyear blimp with 'The World Is Yours' written across itâanother iconic moment from this classic movie.\n\nThe Frank Lopez house can be reached relatively quickly if you're already in Key Biscayne, Florida, or surrounding areas. It can easily be reached by car about 10 miles south of Miami.\n\nThe Babylon Club is a key location in Scarface, where Tony Montana and Manny take notice of the excesses of living an affluent lifestyle. The two men visit The Babylon Club, a local nightclub where Frank often goes. Despite Frank's warnings against such extravagance, Tony becomes enamored with it. This is the beginning of Tony's ascent in the Miami cocaine world. The club exudes decadence and glamor with its entrance canopy, caryatids, and golden lighting illuminating the scene. It's a stunning contrast to the gritty underworld scenes throughout the rest of the movie.\n\nThe exterior shots of Babylon Club were filmed at 3501 Southwest 130th Avenue in Davie, Florida, although none of the original props remain. Long Key Nature Center now occupies a public park of about 32 acres of wetlands at the site, including nature trails and bird-watching opportunities. The Babylon Club's interior was a spacious set on Sound Stage 12 in Universal City, LA. Due to over 50 mirrors being installed on the walls, the film crew encountered challenges avoiding reflections of themselves and their equipment. The mirrors were intentionally made with a soft foam backing and covered with transparent acrylic to be safely destroyed during the shootout that injured Tony.\n\nTo get there, youâll need to drive about 35 miles north from Miami. Depending on traffic, the journey may take around one-and-a-half hours.\n\nIn the movie, Tony goes to Bolivia with Omar (F. Murray Abraham) to establish a new drug distribution agreement with Alejandro Sosa (played by Paul Shenar), who is a powerful drug lord. During their meeting, negotiations break down. Sosa gives Tony binoculars to watch as two hitmen, Alberto The Shadow (Mark Margolis) and The Skull (Geno Silva), kill Omar by hanging him from a helicopter in the sky.\n\nThe scene was filmed at Casa Bienvenida in Park Lane at East Valley Road in Beverly Hills. Architect Addison Mizner designed this rococo Italianate villa for magnate Alfred E Dieterich, providing a perfect setting for this dramatic scene from the movie. The house's open layout allowed smooth tracking shots between the outside and inside, significantly contributing to this particular scene's tension.\n\nCasa Bienvenida is located in Santa Barbara, approximately 6.2 miles east of Santa Barbara city center. To get there, you can take a taxi or rent a car as all major rental companies have offices across the city. The journey should take around 15 minutes.\n\nTony Montana and Elvira are at Perino's restaurant, having a heated argument that eventually leads to her walking out on him and ending their relationship. The restaurant is filled with people who silently sit and watch the altercation unfold. The atmosphere is made all the more tense by Tony's cocaine-induced ranting about how society needs criminals like him. He finishes his tirade with the iconic line: \"Say goodnight to the bad guy.\"\n\nThe interior of Perino's was designed in a classic New Orleans style, and much of it was left unchanged when Brian DePalma filmed the scene for Scarface. While now closed, this location still stands as an iconic part of movie history for fans of Al Pacino and Scarface.\n\nPerino's restaurant was located at 4101 Wiltshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, and has since been demolished. However, its memory lives on thanks to its appearance in this classic movie. Nowadays, visitors can get to this location by car or public transport, such as buses or trains, if they want to pay homage to this iconic location from Hollywoodâs past.\n\nThe end scene in Scarface, where Tony meets his untimely death, is one of the most memorable endings in cinematic history. As he falls from the balcony, we see Tony's face illuminated in the deep red reflection of a pool of his blood below. The iconic shot of his dead body floating beneath a large brass globe inscribed with 'The World Is Yours' is an ironic commentary on Tony's life and ambitions.\n\nThis scene was filmed at the estate known as El Fureidis (âLittle Paradiseâ), located in Montecito, California. The finale takes place at a mansion on 10 acres of green land with a beautiful view.\n\nWhile El Fureidis is not open to the public, you can always take a trip to this beautiful area of California. To get there, youâll need to drive about five miles northeast from Santa Barbara.\n\nScarface is widely regarded as a seminal classic of the gangster genre in modern cinema. Pacino delivers an outstanding performance as Cuban refugee Tony Montana, giving an unforgettable, over-the-top portrayal of a man's rise and ultimate fall. The script also deserves praise for its tight structure and realistic dialogue, maintaining perfect pacing throughout and crafting a tense and entertaining story. The idea behind Scarface was far ahead of its time, daring to address themes such as the exploitation of immigrants while providing a vivid portrayal of the glamorous but dangerous world of drug trafficking.\n\nThe movie significantly impacted viewers when it was first released in 1983 and continues to do so today. Its success spawned countless imitators wanting to recreate the same atmosphere and intensity that Scarface achieved, with many directors citing it as one of their main influences.\n\nIt is safe to say that Scarface is more than worth watching for those interested in classic films or gangster films in general. Its memorable performances, expertly crafted script, and powerful themes make it a must-see for anyone looking for something special in their film repertoire. And if you get a chance to check out some of the iconic Scarface filming locations featured here, itâll be well worth it."
