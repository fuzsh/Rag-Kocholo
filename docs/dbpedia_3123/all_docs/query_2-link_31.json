        "text": "Released by Rockstar Games in September of 2013, Grand Theft Auto V is one of the greatest releases in gaming history. GTA V is the latest entry and big release of a well-known franchise thanks to games like GTA San Andreas and Vice City, and, therefore, aroused great expectations. These were answered, and GTA V elevated the Grand Theft Auto games franchise to a whole new level.\n\nThe Grand Theft Auto Phenomenon\n\nThe critics acclaimed GTA V as Metacritic, for instance, gave the game a 97 out of 100, making it one of the biggest scores ever given by the site. Other well-known critics kept the same speech. If critics were thrilled, fans in the streets were as well.\n\nBefore its release, GTA V broke the record of the most watched videogame trailer of all time. After it came out, GTA V also became the best-selling video game in 24 hours and the fastest entertainment property to gross US$ 1 billion, About to complete a decade, GTA V turned into a huge profit for Rockstar.\n\nGTA V - An Open-World Game Full of Features\n\nWell-developed open-world games are always hyped, but apart from its huge open world and all the player freedom, GTA V has many other features that make the game spectacular. GTA Online is also a hit with no precedents. Many players still enjoy GTA online mode and the most recent GTA RP. The title is a good starting point for those who want to experience the open world and heist games.\n\nThe three-character-narrative, character development, heist missions structure, side missions, town, and world design, and graphics are just some of the highly praised features of GTA V, making it one of the top games. The freedom you feel is like no other.\n\nYou can be stealing cars in Los Santos and even witness an alien invasion easter egg, proving that anything can happen.\n\nAfter such numbers and fans' responses, it became natural for other developers to invest in a similar formula, releasing GTA clones. Several games fit the category, but the following games are the closest to Grand Theft Auto V or other titles from the series.\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2\n\nRelease Date: October 24, 2018\n\nPlatforms: PS4, Xbox One, Stadia, PC\n\nGenre: Action-Adventure\n\nGame Modes: Single Player, Multiplayer\n\nMetacritic: 97\n\nHere comes what is probably the second greatest success from Rockstar Games. Red Dead Redemption 2 puts you in the place of the main character Arthur Morgan, an outlaw from the west in 1899.\n\nIt has many common features with GTA games, like the massive open-world experience. Be prepared to face the best that a third-person shooter adventure game can offer. It is the perfect title for those who prefer smooth gameplay.\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 brings a living world-developed unit with the highest detail. There, you are not only a true outlaw but also prove your morale. Red Dead Redemption 2 puts you and almost all of the characters in this open-world game doing questionable things to make the best of living. Many would say that RDR 2 is a Grand Theft Auto game with horses.\n\nRoyalCDKeys offers 14 different Keys for Red Dead Redemption 2 for you to choose from.\n\nKey Features:\n\nGiant open world gameplay.\n\nGreat storytelling.\n\nStunning graphics.\n\nWatch Dogs 2\n\nRelease Date: May 27, 2014\n\nPlatforms: PS4, XONE, PC (Windows), PS3, Xbox 360, Stadia, Wii U\n\nGenre: Action-Adventure, Stealth, Nonlinear Gameplay Adventure\n\nGame Modes: SIngle-Player, Multiplayer\n\nMetacritic: 82 (PS4), 81 (XONE), 75 (PC)\n\nEven though the original Watch Dogs series will be surely remembered by players, its sequel changed the tone by turning the title into a great AAA game. Watch Dogs became a great example of what open-world action games need to do, a thing we cant say about the original game.\n\nWatch Dogs takes place in the San Francisco bay area, where you will be Marcus Holloway, a young hacker who needs to find his way through rough situations while exploring various gadgets and devices.\n\nWatch Dogs 2 allows you to choose stealth or an assault approach in a large open world, in which NPCs react to your doings.

But, for many people, Saints Row the Third has the perfect balance between GTA elements and its characteristic nonsense development.\n\nIn Saints Row: The Third, you need to be prepared to face the criminal underworld as you start as the Third Street Saints gang leader. The task is to overcome all the rival gangs to control Steelport. It’s a third-person shooting action-adventure with a compelling story where your decisions change the outcome.\n\nYou can get Saints Row: The Third Remastered Steam CD Key with RoyalCDKeys.\n\nKey Features:\n\nAction-based storyline.\n\nCustomizable character.\n\nWide range of weapons.\n\nFar Cry 5\n\nRelease Date: March 26, 2018\n\nPlatforms: PS4, Xbox One, PC, and Stadia\n\nGenre: First: First Person Shooter\n\nGame Modes: Single-Player, Multiplayer\n\nMetacritic: 82 (Xbox One), 81 (PS4), 78 (PC)\n\nLeaving the bandit side to become a police officer – Far Cry is a high praised expansive open-world action-adventure game from the first-person perspective. It brings improved graphics in comparison with previous entries.

The AC franchise is exciting but divides opinions, with some huge great games and other terrible ones. AC Origins belongs to the good edge, as its sequel, AC Odyssey.\n\nYou will leave the streets to fight in a whole new challenging environment: ancient Egypt in an open-world setting. You can expect a hard time in the fight between Assassins and Templars. The only thing you can’t count on is peace.\n\nRoyalCDKeys offers 6 different keys for Assassin’s Creed Origins for you to choose from.\n\nKey Features:\n\nGreat and involving historical set.\n\nWide range of items and weapons to customize your character.\n\nExciting storyline.\n\nSleeping Dogs\n\nRelease date: August 14, 2012\n\nPlatforms: Playstation 3, Xbox 360, PS4, Xone, PC\n\nGenre: Action Adventure\n\nGame Modes: Single-Player\n\nMetacritic: 83 (PS3), 80 (Xbox and PC)\n\nSleeping Dogs brings the gameplay style from the GTA series to melee combat, thus implementing a change that many other games fail to do. It brings an interesting and realistic premise worth checking, where you take advantage of the open-world mechanics to defeat your enemies. For many, the title developed by United Front Games is a spiritual successor to True Crime. A definitive edition was released back in 2014.\n\nYou will be an undercover agent infiltrating Sun On Yee Triad organization. The first mission is a tutorial teaching you the basics.

Payday 2 doesn’t resemble GTA because of an open-world approach. You will soon see that Payday 2 is very unlike the other open-world games but resembles GTA with heist architecture and development.\n\nFor many players, some of the best missions in GTA games are heists, where players need to pass through preparation missions and create a whole scheme to make it work. Payday 2 is the game that gets closer to this format.\n\nIt offers players a series of well-elaborated heist missions, with preparation and lots of gunfights in a fast-paced action title.
