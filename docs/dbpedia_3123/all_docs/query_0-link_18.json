During my playthrough I was having a lot of fun building up my empire in this vice City clone. It was a lot of fun and rewarding building up your empire by delivering drugs, buying up rental properties, and building your collection of cars and boats.\n\nThere was a point in the middle of the game when I didn't want to stop playing cuz it was just so much fun. However the end of the game kind of ruins my experience. The final quarter of the game has you doing what you've been doing this whole time but the difficulty ramps up extremely. You can play for 30-40 minutes at a time and not make any progress because you died to some glitch or died because the game was running at 5 to 6 frames per second on the original Xbox hardware.\n\nThis game could be a lot of fun but I recommend not going all the way to beat it otherwise you'll end up presenting it. And the story is basically non-existent so there's not much of a payoff either.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nDynamic_Derek\n\n90%PlayStation 2\n\n24h Played\n\nAbsolutely fantastic GTA clone! The voice-acting is spot-on, the controls are smooth as butter, and the story is well put-together. The humor and dialogue is perfect for the source material! There were slight issues with load-times, bad collision, and an awkward difficulty ramp. Overall though I would give the game an 88/100. Excellent stuff!!\n\nShareCompleted\n\nTion\n\n80%PlayStation 2\n\n30h Played\n\nBetter then any of the GTA's on PS2..."
