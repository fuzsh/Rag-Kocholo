        "text": "This sets up the mood and setting for the game in a way that simply rehashing the events of the movie never could have. But rather than being shot in the back, Tony escapes alive but with nothing left to his name. Instead of retelling the story of the movie, Scarface picks up at the very end during the shootout in Tony's mansion. While being based around Tony's need for revenge and power certainly helps tie the gameplay to the license, there's a lot more to the game than this that helps it really feel like a Scarface title.\n\nAgain, it's more basic than many other games we've seen in the genre, but it works very well, makes more sense and seems much more natural. Instead of helping a random mob boss simply because the story says so, everything you do is for your benefit and obviously so. There's certainly a story here, but it's based around revenge and taking back what belongs to you, so it feels a tad more like a setting rather than an always-progressing narrative. Almost everything you do seems connected with overtaking the city, resulting in what feels like a much more \"cohesive\" experience than you'll find in other open world games. Instead of working through a seemingly random storyline with characters that come out of nowhere, Scarface does a fantastic job of putting you into the shoes of Tony Montana and letting you have your way with the city of Miami. While Scarface is indeed a GTA-esque game in every respect, it does have a slight bit of a different feel than said series, and in large part that winds up being a good thing. The result is an experience that fans of the genre will feel right at home with while offering enough original ideas to keep it feeling fresh. The developer has also introduced a number of unique features, most of which work out quite well. The result is that we have a game that fixes many of GTA's problematic elements, like the targeting system or having to drive out of the way to stock up on weapons, while also retaining many of its standardized and fun aspects. In fact, it's fairly obvious that Radical used said series as the blueprint and then went back and re-evaluated its shortcomings. Much of Scarface is based on what we've seen in Grand Theft Auto."
