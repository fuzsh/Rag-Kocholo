NARRATOR In May 1900, Fidel Castro -- in an effort to normalize relations with the Carter Administration -- opened the harbor at Mariel, Cuba with the apparent intention of letting some of his people join their relatives in the United States. Within seventy- two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed for Cuba. In the next few weeks, it became evident that Castro was forcing the boat owners to carry back with them not only their relatives but the dregs of his jail population. 3y the time the port was closed 125,000 'Marielitos' had landed in Florida. An estimated 25,000 had criminal records. This is the story of that minority -- those they call 'Los Bandidos.'

But with his trial coming up y'know, it's not so easy for him to slip outta the country right now, y'understand? SOSA (taking the measure of Tony, sarcastic) So he sent you? TONY Yeah, something like that. You sure got good stuff in there Mr. Sosa -- class A shit. Looking over the laboratory like it was his. Omar glances at him, annoyed. SOSA We'll talk at my house. Shall we go.... CUT TO 94 INT. SOSA VILLA - BOLIVIA - DAY 94 The camera moves past a spectacular view of the mountains to a cavernous dining room highlighted by huge paintings from the Spanish classical period and ornate candelabra. At the table are Sosa, Omar, Tony. The Shadow sits impas- sively in a folding chair off to the side, watching Omar and Tony. Tony is impressed, looking at the plates, the glasses, the silverware, uncomfortable, trying to fit in. He eats the salmon off a silver plate with oafish movements of his knife and fork as the servants move to and fro, con- stantly changing dishes, confusing Tony (ad-lib during scene). SOSA (to Omar) ...say Lopez guarantees me 150 keys a month for a year, and he picks it up down here, I could sell it to him for as little as 7000 a kilo. You cannot do better than that. c0NT1NuED #00766 69 CONTINUED 94 94 OMAR Well, we do that we gotta take the . risk of moving it. Also we'd be cutting out the Columbians. You know what that means? TONY That means we gotta go to war with `em. looks over at him, not quite knowing yet what to make Sosa of this guy. SOSA When we cut out.the Coluxnbians we take risks -- on both sides. TONY Split the risk. Guarantee your delivery as far as Panama. SOSA Panama? Risky? It costs me more. There I'd sell maybe 13.5 a key. TONY 13.5! What are you nuts? We still gotta take the shit to Florida. You know what that's like these days? They got the Navy all over the fuckin' place. They got frogmen, they got EC 2s with satellite tracking shit in 'em, they got fuckin' Bell 209 assault choppers up the ass, we're losing one out of every nine loads. It's no duckwalk for us anymore, y'know. Forget it. Omar is looking at him, ready to explode at his blithe assumption of power -- whereas Sosa chuckles, amused by his brashness, starting to be intrigued by this animal. SOSA What do you suggest is a fair...? Excuse me. Interrupted, Sosa looks over at his black aide who suddenly appears at the door, apparently with a message. Sosa waves him in. The black aide Y- The Skull -- is a slim, tall imposing man with academic, 'horn-rimmed glasses and close-cropped hair on a huge and impressive skull. He combines the physical qualities of an animal with an intellectual. As he approaches, he glances down the table, his eyes falling CONTINUED #00766 70 CONTINUED - 2 94 94 briefly on Omar who doesn't connect. The Skull falters -- just for a moment -- then continues towards Sosa with the same stony, loyal expression. Sosa lends his ear and the Skull whispers his information. A beat. He whispers a second thought. Sosa reacts minimally. Then he nods, dismissing the Skull who heads out the room. Sosa glances at his gold Rolex. (meanwhilzz Tony in a whisper) Shaddup willya Montana, I'm doing the talking here! Tony shrugs. SOSA Where were we? TONY Panama. You're looking for a partner, right? Omar shoots a poisonous glance at Tony. SOSA ...something like that. (chuckles) OMAR Look Mr. Sosa, we're getting ahead of ourselves here. I'm down on Frank's authority to buy 200 keys, that's it, that's my limit. I got no right to negotiate for Frank Lopez on anything larger than that. So why don't we... TONY Hey Omar why don't you let the man finish, hunh? Let him propose his proposition. OMAR Hey Montana, you got no authority here, okay ! I started you in this business, all right, so shut the fuck UQ! TONY (shrugs) Frank'11 love it. Don't worry about it. OMAR That's up to Frank -- not you.

The chopper lifts off the lawn, the camera moving to the polo players exercising in the distance...a woman on a horse rides by and we swing with her towards the villa. Sosa walks Tony down an outside gallery towards the veranda where servants lay out the coffee and fruits. TONY You know why they say Cubans are all screwed up? SOSA Why? TONY 'Cause the islands in the Caribbean, the governments in Russia, the Armys in Angola, and the people live in Miami. Sosa laughs. They reach the veranda, Tony glancing past Sosa to an exotic-looking, dark-eyed senorita who gets off her horse, held by a servant, and joins them.

Tony watches her go. TONY I gotta hand it to you. You got everything a man could want. Sosa, pleased, reaches for an expensive set of binoculars on the patio table, looks up through them, at the heli- copter rising off the lawn. SOSA (focusing the binoculars) I like you Tony. There's no lying in you.. .Unfortunately I don't feel the same way about the rest of your organization. Tony glances up at the chopper, the servant pouring coffee for him.

You wanna go on with me, say it. You don't, make your move, hodedor!

It's crazy business we're in, it can happen to anybody -- even you y'know. I'll talk to Frank myself. I'll fix this thing up right between you. (then) You got my word on that. Sosa approaches Tony, focusing an intense stare on him, makes an elaborate gesture of putting his hands out, Tony followng the pantomine, puts his out. Sosa now grips them.
