        "text": "AdamRawrr133,991\n\n28 Jun 2009\n\n48 16 7\n\nLet me start out by saying i'm in no way shape or form against this game. It's an awesome game, i just feel things could have been made better in certain places. You'll see where if you read on.\n\nRight, let me jump right in and tell you what i think. If you rent the game, you'll love it to bits and not wanna send it back.\n\nBut the longer you have it, the story mode part will get excessivly boring.\n\nStory:\n\nThe story is alittle (i wouldn't say stranger) but it's.. different that the previous games' story lines. And with the phone calls and texts every 3 minutes, that will definitly push your buttons if you have a low patience. However, the graphics on this game are by far one of the best ive seen, the buildings, the sea's, the sky.. all the way down to the park's are all very well designed, and as for the cars.. They practically look like the real thing, especially when you damage them, They're so realistic (if you hold break and accellerate, soon enough your tires will blow) which is rather excellent, and if you accidently crash into something you go flying through the windscreen.\n\nMultiplayer:\n\nThe multiplayer is abit of both. It's got great varies game modes (see below) for you to show off your skills, be it driving or shooting. And ofcourse the always ever so popular Free Roam, where you can play with randomers you find online or friends by setting up a private session to explore round the city in company. The multiplayer can be very entertaining however a slight thing i've noticed is that if your playing a mode which isn't necessarily supposed to be shooting eachother (eg: GTA Race or Free Roam) then having auto-aim allowed can be extremely annoying if your trying to play fairly or don't want to be shot for no reason.\n\nSounds:\n\nThe sounds for this game are very unique to Grand Theft Auto. The most noticible sounds would be the various radio stations played in every car, bike and boat, i believe?\n\nThey're clever, funny and very original.\n\nOverall i really like this game and still play it despite having it for more than a year.\n\nHere are the 15 multiplayer game modes:\n\nTeam Games:\n\nTeam Deathmatch\n\nTeam Mafia Work\n\nTeam Car Jack City\n\nTurf War\n\nCops N' Crooks\n\nCompetative Games:\n\nDeathmatch\n\nMafia Work\n\nCar Jack City\n\nRace Games:\n\nRace\n\nGTA Race\n\nCo-operative Games:\n\nDeal Breaker\n\nHangman's NOOSE\n\nBomb Da Base II\n\nAll Rounder:\n\nFree Roam\n\nSingle player: 6.7/10\n\nMultiplayer: 8.3/10\n\nSounds 8.6/10\n\nIf you don't like my review, please feel free to comment and i'll get back to you.\n\n4.0\n\nKaiser Flaco101,068\n\n09 Apr 2009 09 Apr 2009\n\n66 34 11\n\nGTAIV is the first case in a long time, if ever, that a game has been met so well by critics yet been underappreciated by fans. Harvesting near-perfect 9s and 10s from most publications, user averages for GTAIV hover around the 8/10 – 8.5/10 mark. There is, of course, a reason for such a difference of opinion, and my own theory is that, while most games ‘journalists’ (a term used lightly, but that’s a debate for another day) see GTAIV as a landmark in gaming, a wonder in size and scope for people who have been playing games since pre-NES, the majority of GTA-playing gamers are, facts faced, under the age of 21. Nothing wrong with that, of course, being under 21 myself, but when the earliest open-ended game most players remember is GTAIII, you can see the trouble start to arise. The growth of the series, from III to Vice City to San Andreas, has been incredible, R* effortlessly topping themselves each time if only in the amount of stuff to do, game world size and expansive cinematic aspect unconsidered.\n\nAnd with that GTAIV might immediately seem like a step back for the series. Gone are ‘R3’ missions, the memorable taxi/vigilante/paramedic oddjobs now axed. Gone also are the buyable properties and empire-building aspects, and with them, the overall sense of a rags to riches stories of a lone criminal. While these still exist in some shape or form in IV, the taxi and vigilante missions still playable though not through the classic R3 method and certainly not with the rewards they once offered, and safehouses are still to be found in Liberty City, though not with the money-accumulating functions seen in VC and SA, jumping into IV straight from its predecessors can leave you with a bad taste in your mouth.\n\nBut what is a game that doesn’t expand on what we’ve seen before? Would we really have been content with a new GTAIII-style game with better graphics for a new generation? Even now, the idea of Vice City recreated in GTAIV’s engine seems like the greatest idea for a game one can imagine, but R* knows that risks must be taken. If the change hadn’t happened, they’d feed us a new GTA every fourth quarter with new technical advancements and the consumer would lap it up.\n\nIt’s immensely brave of R* to take such a huge risk with a franchise as valuable as GTA, and surely, the transition to this new era of GTA games is far from over, but it has paid off for them unbelievably well. The critics were right – R* is a technical marvel, a testament to what games as a medium can accomplish. The sheer size of the game coupled with the level of detail is unrivalled. R*’s insistence to stay in Liberty City for future instalments (likely this means past the two announced DLC packages) proves this. They’ve created the single greatest game world ever seen, and likely ever to be seen for the rest of this generation and much of the next, where it’s likely to be overshadowed only by GTAV itself.\n\nEven the plot for GTAIV has been overhauled in comparison to past efforts. Playing as a Serbian brings a very unique aspect to Liberty City, opening up areas that would surely have been missed had we been playing a typical Italian-American mafia henchman. And while it could be argued that there’s a multitude of aspects to Liberty City we didn’t get much of a peek at in terms of crime within cultural groups, the upcoming DLC proves to change that. The Lost and Damned is set to show the biker underworld in Liberty City, and future instalments no doubt ready to unveil new crime groups. Perhaps the most promising thing about the announced DLC is they way it times into the plot of the game experienced by Niko Bellic – playable character Johnny Klebitz involved in kidnapping hints that he’s the one who snatches Roman part-way through GTAIV’s story. The intertwining stories seen in the GTAIII-era of games appears to have successfully made the transition over to this generation untouched, though instead of sprawling apart over a two-decade timeframe and three cities, confined to a single city as a modern day experience.\n\nThere are, of course, truly valid criticisms of GTAIV out there. The rather primitive online modes, for instance, already outdone by the Multi Theft Auto mods for VC and SA on the PC. Or the constant nagging from friends wanting to do activities, an (unnecessary) overhaul of the girlfriend system in San Andreas. There’s also no huge sense of reward in GTAIV, either – weapons are now only sold from shops and not delivered to a safehouse as they were in past games, money is much harder to come by, and when you do find it, it’s usually taken away swiftly. Hospitals in GTAIV are now extremely costly compared to the simple $100 charge of past games, and it’s too easy to unload your wallet simply stocking up on weapons and ammo. Luckily, the exclusion of buyable properties means the game has one less money sink. While not failings that hold them game from being perfection, they are certainly valid, and can often seem a bit silly when viewed next to how the same systems were pulled off almost perfectly in past games. There’s no real reason for these sorts of changes.\n\nWhen the game you’re playing is as truly massive as GTAIV, these sorts of criticisms simply don’t matter. The entire experience is refined to be truly amazing, even the in-mission set pieces treated with a cinematic fine-tuning in addition to every other overhaul seen in the game. However, the GTAIV experience is far from over, much in the same way that, back in 2001, the GTAIII experience wasn’t finished with Vice City and San Andreas just around the corner. If R* can do the unthinkable and expand on GTAIV as they did with GTAIII, they might, impossible as it may seem, turn all of those unappreciative past fans around.\n\nNB: I copied this from a write-up I did for another site, sorry for the length/if some parts aren't very relevant.\n\n5.0\n\nCamillus80,155\n\n16 Aug 2011\n\n35 11 18\n\nThis isn't intended to be a full review of this game, but merely a piece of writing to give the reader some information that I wish I knew about GTA 4 before buying it, especially as I was new to the series when I picked it up.\n\nFrankly, I believe that the game received far more praise than it deserved. It is undeniable that Liberty City is a beautiful environment. The detail is incredible. There are countless streets, alleys, parks, and other environments that are detailed and highly unique. NPC's inteact with their environment convincingly. There is a huge variety of vehicles. Without going into too much detail, it suffices to say that R* made a brilliant digital city. The sad thing is that despite this beautiful shell, the gameplay of GTA 4 left much to be desired.\n\nTo begin with, the game lacks any checkpoint system. If you die on a mission, you must start from the beginning, which may mean that you have to drive around for 5 minutes, then fight for a while before you get to the hard part. It's tedious, and ruins the flow and entertainment value of the game.\n\nNow, if you die, you are transported to a hospital, where you lose a large chunk of your money, and any ammo you used since you died is still gone. So if you die on a mission, you are best off to reload a save, which is annoying. The only thing worse than death is getting arrested. Sometimes a cop gets close enough to you so that the game refuses to allow you to fight back (or go out fighting), and you are transported to the police station. Besides losing some money, all your weapons are taken. To replace all weapons and ammo could cost you something like $70 000, which is the equivalent of maybe a couple hours worth of missions. To put it in perspective, it's like losing all of your non-unique weapons in a Fallout game. Sound fun?\n\nGTA 4 also sends you along doing painfully repetive tasks. For anyone going for 100%, you will have to do all sorts of ridiculous little things. You can deliver 30 cars ordered through text message, which involves driving 30 cars from locations across the map to a garage - woop-de-doo. You have to do all sorts of activities with your friends, which often seem utterly pointless. For example, taking them out for food involves driving them to a fast food place, then driving them back. Annoyingly, your health doesn't regenerate, and you often find yourself scouring the city for a food vendor to heal yourself. My favourite is how you need to find all 200 pigeons scattered across the city. It's tedious with a guide, impossible without (it really would be next to impossible). When did R* get the idea that a gamer who likes stealing cars and shooting druglords would also like finding pigeons?\n\nThe missions are also less than impressive. There are many interesting characters, and you fight in a variety of environments so that things do not seem too repetitive. But then there are things which are just silly. You have unclear objectives at times. The game told me to take out a motorcyclist once, but it really wanted me to follow it, as the NPC was invincible until reaching a certain point. This led to a lot of wasted ammo, and a few mission retries. At one point you rob a bank. Naturally, there are cops surrounding the building soon. I was expecting a clever getaway, but instead the game just had you fight your way through dozens of cops - I wasn't particularly impressed. Add in the tedious driving from one place to another segements, and GTA 4's missions aren't exactly incredible.\n\nTo top it all off, the combat system is mediocre at best. The default auto-aim is useless (turn it off!). The enemies aren't particularly intelligent, never seeming to do much more than duck behind and pop out of cover. The aiming system is poorly designed, so you often find yourself shooting a wall when you are near a corner and aiming for a head. R* seems to have fixed the problem in Red Dead Redemption at least. The movement often seems clumsy, and the weapons aren't particularly interesting.\n\nI really wanted to enjoy this game, but I found it's entertainment value very limited. Most reviewers seem enamoured by the beautiful environment, but they seem to forget that GTA 4 is meant to be a game, not a model train set. And though it does wll in presentation, it's gameplay seems to have been designed by cavemen. The bottom line is that for the most part, GTA 4 will only suceed at keeping you mildly amused, and at times will frustrate you. Maybe I'm being a little harsh, as so many great games have come out since it's release. If you are one the fence for GTA 4, know that you will not be missing too much by avoiding it.\n\n3.0\n\nmightEmudE13113,906\n\n18 Jun 2009 13 Dec 2012\n\n33 16 5\n\nThe Smokin' Gamer is here with my first (Somewhat) Quick Review. Now with all my game reviews, I will be grading them in six areas; STORY, GAMEPLAY, GRAPHICS, SOUND/MUSIC, REPLAY VALUE, and what’s important to most of us PRICE VALUE. I grade each area on 1-10 scale (10=masterpiece, 5=average as average can be, 1=horrendous/unplayable). So here I go with GRAND THEFT AUTO 4.\n\nSTORY: The story in GTA4 is by far the best in the series. You play as a Russian immigrant known as Niko Belic looking for someone who betrayed him while he was in the army. Along the way you get to meet a ton of different characters, each one of them helping to develop the storyline. This was my favorite part of the entire game.\n\n(Story: 10/10)\n\nGAMEPLAY: OK this is the part where most people are going to want to burn me alive. Although it is ridiculous fun running over people, shooting hookers, and blowing the living hell out of everything, almost every mission felt like a chore. Let's be honest, most games are repetitive, but it has to be the right kind of repetitiveness. All I kept hearing before the game came out was, \"OH they have changed the combat up so much in this game. It's going to ROCK!!!” While the new cover system was a welcome addition, the lock on system sucks!!! And that physics system...I mean...I know it's pretty accurate, but...F***...I hate being thrown from a car and tearing up my body for about a mile down the road. I know I might be nit picking, but the same people that will defend this game will complain about how you can't run and gun in RE5. Besides that, the game does offer many things to do and can keep a person busy for a very long time.\n\n(Gameplay: 7/10)\n\nGRAPHICS: This game does look amazing!!! You can tell that it was carefully detailed in every inch. The cars, the lighting, the people (strippers) are all gorgeous.\n\n(Graphics: 10/10)\n\nSOUND/MUSIC: Once again the sound is great. Listening to all the people on the street and just hearing the noises from the city do make it feel like you are actually there. And with a ton of different radio stations, it has by far has some of the best music in a game.\n\n(Sound/Music: 10/10)\n\nREPLAY VALUE: You can play this game over and over again without doing any of the missions. Of course we all know this already. BONUS: Multiplayer is pretty fun...if you can find anybody to play with.\n\n(Replay Value: 9/10)\n\nPRICE VALUE: You can find this game used for about $15 or you can spend $20 to get a new copy. IS it worth it, well...yeah it is. You can also buy the game with all the dlc on one disc for about $20-$30 and is well worth your money.\n\n(Price Value: 9/10)\n\nOverall Score: 9/10\n\nIf you like this review, check out my other ones: Resident Evil 5, Bioshock 2 (plus DLC), Dante’s Inferno, Mega Man 10, Bionic Commando, Wanted: Weapons of Fate, Terminator: Salvation, Shellshock 2: Blood Trails, Mercenaries 2: World in Flames, Call of Duty 3, and The Walking Dead\n\n4.0\n\nRhysesPeeses110,119\n\n07 Jun 2010\n\n28 14 2\n\nSummary: Grand Theft Auto IV is a third-person shooter created by Rockstar that ventures into the underworld of modern-day gangsters.\n\nStory: You play as the immigrant Serbian Niko Bellic who has moved to Liberty City in hope for fast cars, mansions, women and above all, no trouble. However after your first couple days you start doing odd jobs for the local mafia and start making your money through murder, robbery and drug-dealing.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay is similar to that of the original Grand Theft Auto's, however the graphics have improved loads showing off every bit of detail including bits of litter on the street, dirt on the car, cracks in windows even the blood splatter from shooting someone. There is a huge choice of weapons like all the other GTA games, including AK's, Shotgun's, Combat Pistol's, RPG-7, Uzi's, Sniper Rifles, Molotovs, Grenades, Baseball Bats and more\n\nMultiplayer: There are a total of 15 different game modes which you can play with friends, including Deathmatch, Cops N Crooks, Mafia Work, Team Deathmatch, Turf Wars, and Races.\n\nDLC: The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony have both been released an they are both fun add-ons. Their stories coincide with the story of GTA IV's meaning in each one you will meet Niko somewhere. In Lost and Damned, you play as Johnny Klebitz a biker with the gang The Lost. In Ballad of Gay Tony you play as Luis Lopez, a bodyguard to nightclub owner Tony Prince.\n\nOverall Verdict\n\nStory: 10/10\n\nGameplay: 10/10\n\nSound: 10/10\n\nMultiplayer: 8/10\n\nDLC: 9/10\n\nOverall: 10/10\n\nhalodeathbringa80,854\n\n12 Jun 2009\n\n10 13 3\n\nGTA4, Good game, but it is bland, boring, and I would much rather spend my time outside then playing this in all truth (and I hate outside). This is the next game of the GTA series, where you take control of Niko Bellic, and immigrant from Russia trying to start anew (he later says that you can't start fresh, you must carry your \"baggage\" with you for your whole life, you can't just drop it, even though earlier in the game he says \"I'm trying to start anew to his girlfriend Michelle(or something along those lines)) with his cousin Romin in LIberty City, the copy of New York City. Niko soon learns that he'll have to make his hands even dirtier then they were back in Russia to survie in America, and find the person he wants to kill. Kinda cool story, the only thing is that its paced really really badly. At the start of the game the story is there, right off the bat it kicks off with gusto and its quite fun to play, but once your forced to leave Hove Beach because of certain happenings, the game starts to go downhill fast.\n\nYou start to talk to Manny, an ex-gangster trying to \"improve\" the streets by killing people, Elizabetha, a stero-typical fat insane drug dealer, and other characters that are all...well the same. Their all ghetto, and all they care about is money, and not giving a damn if someone dies in the process. The game later picks up when you meet Dwayne, one of the more, dare I say it, human characters, an ex-drug dealer who spent time in jail and is haiting the new liberty city and often talks about it. Other then Dwayne, Romen, and Brucie (you meet him early on), all the other characters are the same, they only care about money, screw morals, values, religion, or anything that might prevent a man from screwing over another person, stealing, looting, and killing poeple, those things died a long time ago it seems for this game.\n\nNiko, the character your playing is hell-bent on revenge, trying to kill the man who betrayed his own squad while he was in the army in Russia, resulting in all of his friends dying, and just like everyone else, screwed up in the head about money. He offers a few tidbits of humor, but other then that he's \"I want to kill him!!\" or, \"I'll do it as long as it pays\" which after te 20th mission of him saying that, its annoying.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good, but you can't really say anything about them because your in a city, so nothing is really alive besides the numerous NPCs that might have 5-8 copies of themselves on just 1 block, and most of them if you bump into them will A. Start to shoot you, or just punch you. or B. Run and scream like madmen so the other people attack you, they don't really say anything and don't speak to you, yes its a busy city, but it would be nice if there was SOME npc interaction.\n\nThe sound, sounds like something in a city, and the really cool thing is the radio stations, most of them suck, because their not rock for me, but if your into Hip-hop or whatever, you'll love them.\n\nThe number one one worse thing about this game is the missions, all of them are bland its pretty much escorting a guy, killing a guy, killing alot of guys and steal something. For the whole game, the most extravgent mission would be robbing a bank, which is fun for about the first 3 minutes and then you realize its just kill lots of cops and then go into the subway. The realism is good, but there needs to be more then 1 mission that makes you go \"Holy shit on a stick, what the hell am I gonna do??\"\n\nGood game overall, but the funnest you'll have with the game is running peds over with your car goign 200mph.\n\n2.0\n\nCHRI5T0PH5R211,322\n\n14 Apr 2009\n\n3 6 0\n\nGTA 4 has a very much parallel storyline to other GTA games in the franchise with the main character - Niko Bellic - in this circumstance trying to track down a few major people from his past and get information from them. The game follows a rather lengthy storyline with many side missions, pigeons to blow ups, stunts to complete and various other fun activities such as bowling and drinking to do in spare time with friends, this game has many features which make it an exceptionally realistic environment to play in and has many different options to choose throughout missions with different endings.\n\nThe graphics are of the best that I have seen in all the games that I have seen and the realism with precise detail is brilliant, with fumes with the road, rubbish on the streets and cracks and not to mention the realistic damage taken to a vehicle which is different with the game's predecessors. It has at leat 100 different vehicles, many multiplayer game modes to play and many achievements to gain, of which keep gamers interested and fascinated.\n\nThe detail to the characters and sounds with background noise and hot dog vendors, musicians on the streets, people selling paintings, and the very compact 4 islands keep the gamer moving throughout the large area of Liberty City with much to see and do and the function of an in game mobile phone allows easy communication with acquiantances met throughout the game and allows abilities to be unlocked and with many different types of missions there really is too much to do in GTA 4, which makes it a must by for all gamers who have an Xbox 360, wether or not they have or haven't played any GTA game before!\n\n5.0\n\nSuBzErOsTrIkEr102,347\n\n29 Jun 2011\n\n5 9 2\n\nGrand theft auto... First of all i loved it i have played threw it twice (need to get the 30 hour play thorugh)\n\nFirst up is the story. For me it was kinda slow at first but when u get ur first real gun things start heating up. You wont be able to put it down but some of the missions may seem a little like they repeat. Like u do the same thing but on a diffrent guy but theres not alot of those only bout 4. So it keeps it fresh. so bout 9/10\n\nNext is are the graphics. They are wonderful for a 2008 game. The way people react is just real (some ways). You have the chatty hobos that say ramdom stuff the drama queens on there cell phone. The rain and day to night changes are solid they just flow in perfectly. Also the cars where like u would see on the street and some people driving them just like a normal city. 10/10\n\nNext is the voice acting. The voice overs where pecfect. Niko sounded like a russian with a very dark past always rushing and curseing everywhere. His cosin roman sounded like a fat russian thats ok with the ladies and likes to loss his money. Everyone else was good to i think almost every other person had a diffrent voice they prob had to use over 100 people just for voices(prob going over board XD) but every thing just had a nice feel and i could finsh it. 10/10\n\nGameplay and AI. The game play as i said before was great i loved just running around and killing people haveing epic cop wars tryin to run away on foot when i knew i was going to die. But the AI poloce kinda pissed me off some times. Most of the time when i was haveing a cop war one would come out of know where and blow my head off with my shotgun. So that was kinda a no for me :l. all and all with out the shotgun thing bout 9/10.\n\nDLC. The fun part. First off i loved all the DLC. Its not like that crap u get in most games that last for like 2 hours then u beat it the dlc in this game is like a whole other game. The storys line in with the main story perfectly. Each one should take u bout 8 hours each granted u try and get every achievements like im trying to do bout 12 hours then. There are two dlc out so far u have the Ballad of gay tony. where u are a preaty much club bouncer then ur boss (the gay one u are not gay in the story) gets into a whole mess with gains and deals so its up to u to save him from all this crap. The lost and the damned was dark and gritty. Everything just seemed dark and it kept me going forword and every dlc has one point and wicth they all meet wicth is the diamonds forever mission. The lost is preaty much ur in a biker gang stuff been going up with the gang whens one of ur lost members get out of jail and he starts plotting agasint everyone and ur like the only one that knows about it. 10/10\n\nCo-op. ok i had a blast with this and my friends going around doing drive bys stealing finding our own hosues doing stunt jumps. All that good stuff. With the dlc it makes it even better in the ballad giving u pharchutes that alllow u to jump off the highest building and helocopter and just free fall and pull it out then just fly ur heart out. I had so much fun always theres some realy good glicths like the swing set.. U have to play and find that one out. 9/10\n\nOk Well thats it please go easy this is my sec review ( first one sucked hard XD)\n\n5.0\n\nLessrOf2Weevils87,177\n\n17 Oct 2010\n\n4 8 0\n\nI'm a late comer to the GTA series. Despite the enormous popularity of GTA3 - San Andreas and Vice City, I didn't bring them into the house because I thought my kids were too young to be playing these games. With GTA4 I found out what I was missing.\n\nThe sandbox genre was basically defined with the GTA3 games, and the newest installment shows why Rockstar is still king of this mountain. First off, the world of Liberty City is huge! So huge the game provides you with a road map, including the subway routes and you actually will likely use the thing. We've seen huge sandbox worlds before, but never packed with the level of detail that we have here.\n\nSecond, story and character are fantastic. Great voice acting and character animation combine with a strong script to create characters and scenes that are memorable. When you care about the characters, you care about what happens to them, and this game makes you care.\n\nThird, I love the dark, satirical, mood of the game. One major component of this is the radio, television and Internet media that are created just for the game (yes, you can watch TV and serf the Web in the game if you like). The radio programs and ads are particularly biting, and often drop dead hysterical. The abundant, and interconnected, media also serves to add to the depth of the world, making the whole experience more immersive. For example, you'll see a billboard for a play, later hear a commercial for the play, then, while listening to the news, hear an interview with one of the performers in the play. This all happens seamlessly and naturally.\n\nBut the best part of GTA 4 is the gameplay. Cover based combat seems all the rage in shooters right now, and I think GTA4 provides the best working model for it yet, creating a fast and exciting shooting experience. But beyond that, GTA4 provides so many different elements that listing them all would be a chore. There's the obvious gun fights and car chases, but it also varies from bowling, to racing, to dating, to just going drinking with your buddies (but then whistle for a cab to take you home). For goodness sakes, the game provides you a button to flip from high to low beams on your headlights. As far as variety in the missions (including the optional ones) little beats this game.\n\nThe downloadable content is even worth talking about. The Lost and Damned expansion gives about an additional 10 to 15 hours of game play that is of as high quality as the original, creating a story that weaves in and out of the story and characters of the original. And out today is the second expansion, The Balad of Gay Tony, which also looks amazing.\n\nGTA4 provides a package that can't be beat and is easily one of my favourite games that I've played in the last year.\n\nStory: 4\n\nInterface: 5\n\nGame Play: 5\n\nChallenge: 4\n\nFun: 5\n\nOverall: 9.5/10\n\n5.0\n\nmariofan11290,306\n\n17 Nov 2009\n\n1 5 0\n\nIt's amazing how the journey of Grand Theft Auto (GTA) has unravelled in the world of gaming and what began as top view game is now a fully fledged 3D world that is a true sandbox experience for the 21st century gamer.\n\nOf course GTA IV changed the face of gaming as players embarked on a journey with Niko Bellic and although the game was quite visually breathtaking, the story for some was a little too serious and not everyone could relate to this thug from Eastern Europe.\n\nOf course with such as a great gaming engine, this moved onto the next chapter which included Billy Grey, a member of biker gang who after being released from prison found his beloved city of Liberty City in turmoils. And moving on from Billy, the next and latest installment focuses on Luis Lopez and his business partner Tony Prince in Grand Theft Auto: the Ballad of Gay Tony.\n\nWith the release of Grand Theft Auto: Episodes of Liberty City, it includes the original DLC of The Lost and Damned plus a new addition with the Ballad of Gay Tony. Best of all, you don't need GTA IV to play these add-ons and even if you have never played the previous games, both these episodes are included in one wholesome DVD.\n\nThe Lost and the Damned\n\nThe story revolves Billy Grey, the president of the Lost Motorcycle Club who returns to the world after spending time in rehabilitation. Unfortunately when Billy returns, he discovers that his club has turned into a professional criminal organisation and their gang arch rivals, The Angels of Death now have a strong truce with them.\n\nBilly is a traditionalist biker with old school motivations and values and this new direction for the club doesn't sit too well with him which creates an uneasy tension with interim president Johnny. It's a classic Grand Theft Auto storyline that features strong social commentary about a variety of issues within the United States.\n\nOf course, the classic gameplay of the series still remains, however where this current game does shine is through the characters, the story and good old fashioned action that in my opinion, makes this a more entertaining game than Grand Theft Auto IV. Unlike the aforementioned game, the characters in The Lost and the Damned are more relatable and realistic than the ultra violent, clichéd and gruff Niko.\n\nIn its essence, the game is a true sandbox game that allows you to explore almost every facet of this fictional gaming city that contains a plethora of entertaining missions from easy to some quite difficult. Add in a wide gamut of mini-games that are all linked to the well scripted story and feeling the hum of the \"Harley\" really lets you get lost in this decent game.\n\nThe mini-games in the title are quite fun and involve activities like arm wrestling and even a Tetris clone which helps spice up the main gameplay or just gives you that entertaining break. Although some may see the Lost and the Damned a carbon copy of GTA IV as you are playing in the same city, I tend to differ as it's a different perspective on this interactive world, told from the perspective of these rough and tough bikers that don't take no for an answer.\n\nThe elements that made GTA so strong are still present in the title from police chases to taking out competitors in some most unusual ways that when matched with the sandbox approach, it's almost up to the gamer and gives you a sense of ownership to what and when you want to do things. The developers have fixed some of the complaints from the previous game with the introduction of new checkpoints during missions which means you don't have to start from scratch again which is definitely the way the series should have started.\n\nOnce you have finished the single-player game which should take most gamers between 15 - 20 hours to successfully complete, it's time to take on multiplayer aspect. Rockstar have ensured that this is still a strong suite of the franchise and have added a new mode called Lone Wolf Biker that has the gamer playing against a team of gamers. Chopper vs Chopper is another great addition that lets gamers challenge each other with bikes and helicopters, you really need to see it in action to appreciate it. Of course, there's the classic Team Deathmatch and some other enjoyable multiplayer games that almost makes this more than just an addon.\n\nOf course, with that said... ladies and gentlemen, I introduce you Gay Tony!\n\nThe Ballad of Gay Tony\n\nAs mentioned, gamers play Luis Lopez, another shady yet likeable underworld character and unlike Niko Bellic, Lopez is considerably more likeable and more entertaining to watch and play. Although Lopez has spent time in prison, his main problem is his loyalty to friends which generally get him involved in all sorts of mischief and like previous GTA instalments, the main issues are to assist others in the game and if political correctness is your middle name, you might want to get your gaming kicks from elsewhere.\n\nAdd in a variety of colourful characters and some really fun and at times frustrating missions and The Ballad of Gay Tony is righteous romp through the criminal underworld. As the game is relatively short, we managed to finish the game in just under 10 hours, however there are a plethora of more side missions that we did not complete which would easily add another 5 or so hours on top of this.\n\nUnfortunately many of the missions in the game are key segments of the plot but needless to say, if you enjoyed previous GTA instalments, this game will bring a big fat smile to your face, especially base jumping! Some of the stunts in the game are quite outrageous which involves parachutes, motorbikes and the like. Apart from the main missions, there are drug war challenges to engage that also help give the gamer a break from the main theme of the title as you assist these shady underworld criminals in their illegal trafficking.\n\nOf course, if you are connected to XBox Live, your mission scores are also uploaded to this server but best of all, you can replay missions in order to boost up those scores which definitely increases the replay value, especially considering that the missions are do damn fun, it's almost a given.\n\nSpeaking of multiplayer fun, the title does allow gamers to take The Ballad of Gay Tony online with Free Play, Deathmatch and even Races with glorious nitro. As with GTA IV, The Ballad of Gay Tony contains some fun mini-games such as dancing or even a drinking competition which adds to the almost realistic environment of the game.\n\n5.0\n\nBurritoTacerson54,046\n\n01 Jun 2010\n\n2 7 0\n\ni would like to say Rockstar did a wonderful job on this one, my friend and i will play for hours and hours and it doesn't get old. The story line is fun and exciting. some missions are hard and need to be repeated. cheats help but a few do disable achievements. The achievements are fun to get and don't take to long. After the story line is over and you have free played it starts to get boring, DLCs can be downloaded for $20 each and add to the story line. I would recommend this game to anybody that has played and of the other GTAs.\n\n5.0\n\nCHRI5T0PH5R211,322\n\n14 Apr 2009\n\n5 11 0\n\nGTA 4 has a very much parallel storyline to other GTA games in the franchise with the main character - Niko Bellic - in this circumstance trying to track down a few major people from his past and get information from them. The game follows a rather lengthy storyline with many side missions, pigeons to blow ups, stunts to complete and various other fun activities such as bowling and drinking to do in spare time with friends, this game has many features which make it an exceptionally realistic environment to play in and has many different options to choose throughout missions with different endings.\n\nThe graphics are of the best that I have seen in all the games that I have seen and the realism with precise detail is brilliant, with fumes with the road, rubbish on the streets and cracks and not to mention the realistic damage taken to a vehicle which is different with the game's predecessors. It has at leat 100 different vehicles, many multiplayer game modes to play and many achievements to gain, of which keep gamers interested and fascinated.\n\nThe detail to the characters and sounds with background noise and hot dog vendors, musicians on the streets, people selling paintings, and the very compact 4 islands keep the gamer moving throughout the large area of Liberty City with much to see and do and the function of an in game mobile phone allows easy communication with acquiantances met throughout the game and allows abilities to be unlocked and with many different types of missions there really is too much to do in GTA 4, which makes it a must by for all gamers who have an Xbox 360, wether or not they have or haven't played any GTA game before!\n\n5.0\n\nSwiftRedVox192,725\n\n07 Sep 2010\n\n3 12 2\n\nA great sandbox game with a good story. It strives to be realistic but by doing so loses the sense of fun that it's predecessors flaunted. It is a shame then that the sense of realistic gameplay is shattered so frequently by unrealistic driving, indestructible trees and other such annoyances.\n\nAt times it feels as if the game is *trying* to frustrate you; you're cousin will phone you incessantly and demand you take him to play a poorly implemented mini-game. And what's your reward for putting up with the family member from hell? A taxi service. No, really.\n\nIt is notoriously hard to criticise GTA IV without being met by mindless retorts from people who are \"soopa hard fanboyz\" and the like, but everybody's entitled to their opinion. This is merely mine, I believe that's what a review is.\n\nIf you don't mind repetitiveness in your games and can overlook frustrations with ease, then by all means give this game a shot. If you are looking for something more fun-loving try similar games such as Saints Row 2 or any of GTA's previous titles."
