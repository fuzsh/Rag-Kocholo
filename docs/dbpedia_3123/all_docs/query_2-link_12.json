        "text": "Open world, the last frontier of videogames, the dominant genre that took the industry by storm during the early 2000's and is more or less the current template for either SP or MP games. A very controversial, yet loved category that has produced the biggest hits in the medium and is constantly into the spotlight as the brewing cauldron of advancement for the whole medium.\n\nThe most important aspect of the open world genre is, well, its open world. Often comprised of a city, a region, or in the case of the last 2 AC games and the Just Cause series, entire countries. They provide the background, the \"sandbox\" where the story and action takes place. What is interesting about it is that, contrary to linear games where the pacing is dictated by set pieces and the feeling evoked by new locations, open world thrives in familiarity. In how much we can believe we're really \"there\", no matter how many times we drive the same road or visit the same street, variety matters less than the sheer illusion.\n\nThrough the years we've been witnesses to the ever evolving nature of both size, form and setting of the open worlds. From the cardboard streets of Liberty City we've taken our journey into some exotic locations like the wild west, a tropical country, Egypt and Greece, the state of San Andreas, Gotham City, New York (countless times), Chicago, San Francisco, Paris, even outer space and many, many more.\n\nBut no matter which point of time we want to reminisce, there's always a shared, constant matter in open world games that concerns them all: the world border. The physical place where the illusion will inevitably be broken, the small peak between the curtains, the end of the promise of living somewhere else.\n\nFor what I can remember, there's 8 (Thanks silentbum and zma1013 ) basic categories of world borders:\n\nTHE UNASHAMED FOURTH WALL BREAK: \"You can not go beyond this point\". Arguably the laziest yet interesting way to end the map. The game drops all pretense and just reminds you it is a game and there's nothing you can do. Ride's over kid, go back or go home. Example: All open world Spider-man games. Prototype. Most landlocked open worlds.\n\nTHE JUSTIFIED NOTICE: \"There are dragons beyond this point, go back!\". It's a variation of the above case, the illusion still shatters because the game tells you it's a game, but it at least tries to make it seem reasonable for the character to some point. Examples: Assassin's Creed's animus, The Witcher 3's \"there are dragons beyond this point!\" notice.\n\nTHE CONVENIENT ROADBLOCK: This is well used by lots of open world games whenever they need to lock zones before a certain storypoint. It's also used in game. It's characterized by being conveyed by a visual tool with a (flimsy?) in game justification. Examples: The shattered roads in Silent Hill, the roadblocks in Second Son.\n\nTHE NATURAL BORDER: This might be my favorite of the bunch, and it's one that I can only recall being used in both Red Dead Redemptions. This time, the justification is not a conveniently placed object or random prohibition, no, it's just that your character isn't humanly capable of climbing that mountain or swimming through that river. See, if you could, you'd be able to go farther, but you don't, so tough luck, get a jetpack I guess!. I love this one because it doesn't break the illusion at all. Examples: As noted, both Red Dead Redemptions.\n\nTHE UNBEATABLE HAZARD: There's technically /nothing/ stopping you, but once you take a step further where the devs want you to be some kind of incident or enemy attack happens and you're done. No mercy applies here. (Examples: The Witcher 2, GTA V, Scarface (sharks!)).\n\nTHE ENDLESS SEA: This one might or might not be considered lazy. If your game takes place on an island, you're set, because you can just stream sea for all eternity, In the end, nobody can say your game doesn't take place on a single island on mid pacific, and nobody is gonna try to make a plane fly for 40 hours to test the theory so you're more or less set. The lazy variation is one where a former landlocked area is turned into an island or said nature is never mentioned or acknowledged in game. Example: San Andreas (PS2), Liberty City (Both incarnations). Just Cause games (These use it well!)\n\nTHE LOOP: The world loops beyond a certain point giving a sense of a \"rounded\" nature of the world. You are in a small planet, like the Little Prince. Examples: Dragon Quest XI, Tales of Vesperia, older Final Fantasy, Xenoblade Chronicles X.\n\nNO BORDERS!: Seen in randomly generated terrains. There's no limit, the promise is never broken, you're here and will always be if you want. The universe is at your fingertips. This is peak humanity. Examples: Minecraft, No Man's Sky, Star Citizen?\n\nHow's the future coming up? What are the challenges that you think will be present for devs in the future? What are your examples and favorites among the open world borders?\n\nThank you for reading!"
