        "text": "It's time to \"make way for the bad guy\" in this adaptation of Brian De Palma's 1983 film starring Al Pacino as Cuban drug dealer Tony Montana. The game picks up where the movie left off, albeit with the stunning revelation that Montana isn't dead. Montana survives the assassination attempt and vows revenge on the kingpin who nearly put him out of commission: Alejandro Sosa. Players assume the role of power-hungry Montana in his bid to reclaim his cocaine empire and extravagant lifestyle. This, of course, means resorting to graphic violence and colorful profanity as a means of \"persuasion.\"\n\nMontana can freely explore 1980s Miami and its surrounding islands as he tries to amass a fortune by smuggling drugs. Along the way, players must purchase fronts for laundering money, defeat rival gangs, elude capture from the DEA, and discover creative uses for a chainsaw. One notable feature is the ability to target individual body parts, with stylish moves rewarded in \"balls points.\" As Montana flexes his machismo, he will gradually build to a blind rage, a temporary state that switches the default third-person view to a first-person perspective with time-slowing effects, allowing players to inflict heavy damage.\n\nAnother key element is the lack of loading screens while visiting different areas of Miami, including such familiar haunts as Freedom Town, the Babylon Club, and Lopez Motors. As he earns respect and power, Montana can use a satellite phone to hire henchmen, request vehicles, weapons, and other tools of the drug trade. The game also features Al Pacino's likeness as Tony Montana, and several film actors have lent their voices to the project, including original cast members Robert Loggia and Steven Bauer. Screenwriter David McKenna, whose film credits include American History X and Blow, penned the game's original storyline.\n\nScarface: The World Is Yours -- Collector's Edition features such bonus content as a printed world map, hints and tips, concept art, and a DVD with \"Making Of\" cast videos, interviews, and a game walk-through with producer commentary.\n\nFeatures:\n\nBuild a drug empire from the ground up as the irrepressible Tony Montana\n\nCreate a custom soundtrack by choosing hits from the 1980s or more contemporary songs\n\nFeatures voice acting from such stars as James Woods, Cheech Marin, Oliver Platt, and more\n\nMANUFACTURER'S DESCRIPTION:\n\nBE THE ORIGINAL. BE TONY MONTANA.\n\nThey thought you were dead, but Tony Montana don't die so easy. Sosa took everything you had. Now you've got nothing, but that never stopped you before. You're back with a vengeance, ready to reclaim your turf and rebuild your empire. All you've got are your balls---and your word.\n\nLive the turbulent life of the infamous Cuban drug lord who redefined the American Dream, in an original explosive script by famed screenwriter David McKeena (Blow, American History X). Climb your way back to the top through savvy deals and brutal intimidation. First you get the money, then you get the power, then you get revenge!\n\nBeat down, blow away or run over your enemies with Tony's signature style and flair\n\nBury those cock-a-roaches in Blind Rage Mode\n\nInsult, intimidate and impress the way only Tony can\n\nBecome the kingpin of a thriving underworld economy\n\nExperience the lavish lifestyle of a crime boss\n\nHire henchmen to do your dirty work\n\nExplore the open world of Miami and the Islands---go in and out of buildings without loading\n\nFEATURES:\n\nThird person perspective.\n\n3D graphics\n\nCartoon graphics\n\nCrime theme."
