        "text": "Concept art for a cancelled Scarface 2 game has emerged online.\n\nPosted by YouTube user Mafia Game Videos,Â the screenshots, which have been released by former employees of Radical Entertainment, show off the Las Vegas strip as well as the surrounding Nevada Desert.\n\nInterestingly, the screenshots have seemingly been on the various artists’ Art Station pages for years, but have only now come to light thanks to this video.\n\nIn-game screenshots of what appear to be environments in the game have also been released showing off the lobby of a casino and a parking garage.\n\nScarface: The World Is Yours was an action-adventure game developed by Radical Entertainment and released in 2006 for PlayStation 2, Xbox, Wii and PC. An Xbox 360 version of the game was planned but never released.\n\nThe game, which served as a sequel to the film, saw Tony Montana seeking revenge on his business partner-turned-enemy Alejandro Sosa.\n\nWhile several members of the original cast returned to voice their roles, Al Pacino did not. He did, however, allow for his face to be used in the game, and apparently hand-picked the actor who voiced Tony in the game.\n\nThe first game received positive reviews, with the PlayStation 2 version earning a 75 on reviews aggregator Metacritic.Â\n\nDeveloper Radical Entertainment was known for a large number of licensed games during the PlayStation 2 era. In 2005, it was acquired by Vivendi Universal Entertainment, which would later merge with Activision in 2008."
