        "text": "For the 2006 game, see Scarface: The World is Yours.\n\nScarface: Money. Power. Respect. is a video game for the PlayStation Portable and Windows Mobile released in October 2006, based on the film starring Al Pacino.\n\nWhile the Scarface: The World Is Yours game for the PC, Xbox, PlayStation 2, and Wii was developed by Radical Entertainment; Scarface: Money. Power. Respect was developed by FarSight Studios. Unlike The World Is Yours, which is an open-world third-person action game, Scarface: Money. Power. Respect. is a turn-based strategy game featuring both single and multiplayer modes. Only a couple of the voice actors from the console version reprise their roles in this game, with Robert Loggia actually reprising his role as Frank Lopez.\n\nGameplay[]\n\nThe game challenges the player to make strategic decisions to rise to power and to direct an army of gunmen while fighting. In single-player story mode the player will direct strategic citywide commands to dominate street-level real time combat. The game challenges the player to handle large territory, adversaries and profit-making opportunities through drug trafficking. In multiplayer mode it pits four players as criminal cartels in a race to gain money and turf. Through turn based showdowns and real time combat each player will manage production and distribution of drugs, build up enough cartel strength to overpower adversaries, conquer turf and rule the Miami drug scene.\n\nPlot[]\n\nNarration[]\n\nThe plot loosely follows the events of the movie, but modified to be a turn based strategy game.\n\nMissions[]\n\nTutorial: Learning the basics of the game from Frank Lopez.\n\nScenario 1: Learning how to use thugs & taking over turf.\n\nScenario 2: Learning how to distribute drugs & using pushers.\n\nScenario 3: Acquiring a shipment of drugs from a string of mules from Columbia.\n\nScenario 4: Taking over three specific territories from Nacho Contreras.\n\nScenario 5: By dealing with Sosa, Tony must acquire more turf & storehouses to receive a large cocaine shipment.\n\nScenario 6: The cartels have heard of Tony's deal with Sosa, with Gaspar Gomez coming at the Lopez Cartel hard, and must be eliminated.\n\nScenario 7: Tony is going to have to accumulate $800,000 for five rounds to keep Mel Bernstein off their backs.\n\nScenario 8: Frank has set Tony up, and must be eliminated.\n\nScenario 9: With Frank Lopez gone, Tony & his cartel must build their strength before taking over a lot of territories from the Diaz Cartel & the Contreras Cartel.\n\nScenario 10:The Montana Cartel & the Bolivian Cartel are now at war. Tony must take over all of Miami in order to eliminate Sosa.\n\nSetting[]\n\nCombat[]\n\nHeads-up display (HUD)[]\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nConcept art[]\n\nGallery[]\n\nCartel Leaders[]\n\nCartel Challenge Logos[]\n\nVideo[]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co2Ya1AFO-w"
