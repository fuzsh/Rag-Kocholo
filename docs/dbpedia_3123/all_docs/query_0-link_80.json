        "text": "Sosa: So... how's this going to work Tony? How do we solve our problem?\n\nTony: You're going to die Alex, for everything you've done in your entire life.\n\nSosa: (Laughs) What about what you did? I told you not to fuck me, and you did Tony.\n\nTony: There were kids in the fucking car Alex! Innocent Kids! Huh, what kind of animals you've got working for you?\n\nSosa: I want to clear something up with you Tony, before I kill you. When you move 400 kilos a month, it's imperative that you do kill children. That way, heroes don't get confused and go on 60 Minutes. They instead crawl back into the hole they came from.\n\nTony: Hey, Sosa! Maybe it's time for you to make that crawl huh?\n\nTony: The Government not paying you clowns enough?\n\n\"Crockett\": Hey buddy we're Vice, not some loose knit government agency looking for handouts. You know how this is going to work from here on out, don't you?\n\nTony: Fuck You. Mel Bernstein tried this shit on me once, and it didn't work out so good for him you know.\n\n\"Tubbs\": Mel? He wasn't a team player, Montana. You did us all a favor.\n\n\"Crockett\": Look Montana, Miami is our back yard. The people pay us to make sure scumbags like you keep the economy nice and stable. We don't want to get in the way unless you force us to, understand? Our boys in the streets keep tabs on you. You start doing too many things that upset the people, then your Heat goes up. If your Heat gets too high, then we'll be forced to make a house call. So... if you want to keep it cool with us Montana, we suggest you make a donation. (Gets in the van)\n\nTony: Maybe you two should go home and donate a little something to your wives, you know? (Hands over a stack of $10K) Relax a little.\n\n\"Tubbs\": (Chuckles as the van starts up and takes off) We're watching you boy."
