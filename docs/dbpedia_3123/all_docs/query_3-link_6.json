        "text": "When we think of the mafia and gangs, one name comes to mind, Al Capone. Al Capone, also known as Scarface, was an infamous mafia leader who was active in Chicago during the Prohibition era. Having committed numerous criminal deeds and being the man behind countless murders, Capone was finally arrested for tax evasion . Now, you might ask, “How was he able to commit all these violent deeds without being imprisoned?” Well, we first have to go to the beginning of Capone’s life.\n\nNotably, the film Goodfellas is a classic film that is recognized as one of the greatest films of all time in regards to the crime genre. Indeed, the film Goodfellas is about American citizens who partake in criminal activity in order to make money. Furthermore, another film was made, shortly after Goodfellas achieved great success in the box office. Additionally, another film titled “The Real Goodfella” is the uncensored documentary explaining the reality behind Goodfellas, and gives a practical insight of the real dangers that could not be shown in Goodfellas. Also there are two articles that explain the explicit truth behind the criminal activity that mobsters justify as work. These sources show that mobsters have a hard time. Mobsters classify as above working class because they constantly have to steal, murder, and deal drugs just to stay alive and have money.\n\nThe gangster movie Scarface was released in 1983. It was directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone. Al Pacino plays the main character of Tony Montana, best known as Scarface. Scarface was one of the best gangster movies of all times, I suggest everyone watch Scarface because it is full of action, drama suspense and violence but most of all greed. In the 1983 era Scarface was a big hit, I found this move breath taking, because of how Scarface murdered anyone who stood in his way, but most of all how his reputation lead him to become the biggest drug lord in Miami, and how his power helped him control all cocaine that went threw the states.\n\nFilms and television shows often depicted intense action scenes and confrontations between law enforcement officers and drug traffickers, which often romanticized the dangers of the drug trade to great extent. Movies such as \"Scarface\" (1983) and \"New Jack City\" (1991) portrayed drug lords like “Tony Montana” and “Nino Brown” respectively as confident, charismatic, and powerful figures glamorizing their lifestyles despite the risks and moral implications of their actions. These films not only captured the imagination of audiences but also perpetuated stereotypes about drug dealers as symbols of rebellion as well as over-portraying minority groups like African Americans and Latin Americans as drug dealers. Television series such as \"Miami Vice\" (1984-1990) also contributed to the glorification of drug violence by following stylish undercover detectives “Sonny Crockett” and “Ricardo Tubbs'' who duked it out with drug kingpins in diverse and exotic locations. Whilst these shows did provide entertainment, they also blurred the lines between fiction and non-fiction, inadvertently popularizing such immoral criminal activities in the eyes of impressionable young viewers.\n\nTo define a film by a certain genre, there are several elements and signatures that a film will display in order to signify its place amongst the genre. A film from the gangster genre is characterized by violence and lawlessness of american capitalism and The American Dream. The short lived classical era of the gangster genre in Hollywood is also greatly influenced by the production code which manifested the iconic moral narrative of the gangster genre. William A. Wellman’s 1931 film The Public Enemy can be considered a film of the gangster genre when one examines the conflict with the American dream, the rise and fall of the protagonist Tom Powers, as well as the visual storytelling employed to support the narrative.\n\nGenre is a French word meaning ‘type or ‘kind’ (Genre, 2016). The film industry has been around for at least 100 years. The evolution of entertainment is growing rapidly through the use of media. And as these years go on, films have begun to fit into specific genres, and are important to appeal to the different types of audiences. Films can be described to genre in different types of ways, such as stars, director and narrative to help identify what genre the film is (Neale, 1990, pg. 49). Genre in films has become common because it helps give the audience a different expectation. One specific genre of film is a horror. Horror is a genre that tries to create, panic, dread and fear for the audience.\n\n'The Godfather' is the most revolutionary gangster film of all time, it rewrote the gangster genre in such a stylized way that all latter gangster films have conformed to this genre but also evolved it as films have progressed. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola 'The Godfather' re-invented the gangster genre elevating it to a Hollywood status and making it commercially profitable. It looks into the life of the 'Corleone' family and represents America at that point in time. It portrays the violence and power, corruption and justice, honour and obligation apparent at that time. Previous to 'The Godfather's' release the 'American Dream' was born, to idealists America was the country of\n\nThe original was shot in black and white because in 1932 although color film was available it still wasn’t very popular and most films were still done in black and white. The 1983 version of Scarface was shot in color because by 1983 barely any movies were done in black and white. In 1983 four movies were shot in black and white and one of them was done partially in color. Watching a movie in black and white nowadays is hard for some people to do because we are so used to everything being in color. A black and white film gives the viewer a very different feeling when watching a movie because it is not the norm these days. The soundtracks for both movies obviously were very different. The original Scarface was all classical music with\n\nScarface is a crime-drama film that is famously known for being one of the most violent and profanes films during its time of release. Focusing on the rise of Tony Montana (Al Pacino) on the criminal ladder and becoming more psychotic as his career as the leader of his drug empire progresses, leading to his eventual downfall. Directed by Brian de Palma, written by Oliver Stone and with performance of the cast with the lead Al Pacino, Scarface became a cult classic among the masses.\n\nThe Gangster film ‘Scarface’ (DePalma) is about the rise and eventual fall of Cuban immigrant, Tony Montana. Throughout the film the viewer witnesses how Tony Montana goes from a criminal in Cuba to a drug overlord in America. The average viewer cannot connect to the arc of Tony Montana. But, the average viewer can connect to what Tony Montana is working for, the American dream. Brain DePalma chooses purposefully to have a hyper-masculine, narcissistic, megalomaniac immigrant as the main character of a story of American dream. In ‘Scarface’, DePalma show the universality of the American dream. By utilizing various filming techniques, DePalma shows how the American dream is available for everyone.\n\nThe film, American Gangster, directed and produced by Ridley Scott is a drama based on the biography of Frank Lucas. In the movie, Frank Lucas constructs his own business of illegal work after his boss, Bumpy Johnson, passes away. Frank builds a heroin business, following in the footsteps of Bumpy, and becomes the most powerful crime boss in Manhattan. Furthermore, because of Frank’s immoral ways, he gets caught by the police and is sentenced to 15 years in prison. As the movie progresses I form a couple assumptions of what could happen in the short term and long term. First off, when Frank Lucas attains his heroin I believe that in the short term he will succeed. Frank has established a vast amount of insights into the drug business from Bumpy, and from what he has learned he will take in and apply it to his situation. However, all immoral acts will have to be put to an end, so in the long term, Frank’s heroin business will be caught. If Frank’s business is the biggest thing in Manhattan then the police are bound to question where are all the illegal drugs coming from, how, why, and who. The police were already hunting him down so it was inevitable for him to get out of his illegal mess.\n\nWith its tone and specific style, Film Noir has become one of the prominent elements that helped shape the American cinema. Within film noir, drama, romance, thriller, and crime are the main genres that can be seen in noir films. From all this amalgamation of genres, the topic of whether film noir is a genre or not does seem interesting, but it is particularly the themes and the style that seems to generate this conversation. Film noir itself can be seen as more of a film movement than a genre."
