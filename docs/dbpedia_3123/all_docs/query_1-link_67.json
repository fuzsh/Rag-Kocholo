        "text": "There’s just something about assuming the role of a conventionally negative character like a gangster; having all that power and abusing that to the fullest all while working to further your influence over a city. There are plenty of games that will allow you to do just that, and this feature lists down 15 of the best open world gangster games of all time. We have quite a lot to cover, so let’s get right into it.\n\nGrand Theft Auto 3\n\nRockstar made a big splash in the gaming industry with Grand Theft Auto 3. Thanks to the addition of a new dimension, Grand Theft Auto 3 let players loose into a virtual world that was unlike anything they had seen before. Between a great open-world and fun gameplay mechanics, Grand Theft Auto 3 tells a gangster story complete with all the betrayals and plot twists that one would expect from a story of this ilk. It has definitely aged a bit by modern standards, but there’s still a distinct charm to its world and gameplay that makes it enjoyable to this date.\n\nMafia Definitive Edition\n\n2020’s Mafia Definitive Edition soups the 2002 original with a complete reimagining of its visuals from the ground up. It tells the same story through a new lens and features the same complex characters and emotional development arcs that made us fall in love with it all in the first place. Mafia: Definitive Edition is an emotional tale of Tommy Angelo’s journey of rising through the ranks of criminal families, and the action sequences are extremely captivating which will keep you engaged for hours upon hours.\n\nThe Warriors\n\nBased on the 1979 film, The Warriors stands apart from the crowd of other Rockstar-developed open-worlds. And the biggest reason for that is its impressive hand-to-hand combat system that enables player expression, which is quite different from the ranged combat system that we see in games like Grand Theft Auto or Red Dead Redemption. The story also does a great job of showcasing the rivalry between gangs, and the characters are also quite memorable. It might not hold up visually, but The Warriors is definitely worth playing even after all these years.\n\nThe Getaway\n\nIt’s possible that many wouldn’t know about The Getaway, which is a shame considering it was one of the pioneers of cinematic action experiences of its time. Set against the backdrop of London, The Getaway tells a story of two characters trying to pull off dangerous heists and make it out alive against all odds. With cutting-edge animations and visuals, The Getaway is definitely one of the most impressive games on the PS2 – and it remains a must-play for anyone wanting to experience a good gangster story.\n\n50 Cent: Bulletproof\n\n50 Cent: Bullet Proof is a third-person action game where the players are put in the shoes of popular rapper 50 Cent as he gets caught up in a criminal drama, and players are left to their devices to solve the mystery surrounding it all. The gameplay can be pretty clunky with aiming that’s not quite as accurate as one would like, but a soundtrack composed of 50 Cent tracks along with some remixes and instrumentals brings a fun vibe to this straightforward shooter game. It’s definitely not a perfect game by any means, but it has a distinct charm to it which makes it worth trying out.\n\nYakuza 0\n\nRyu Ga Gotuko’s Yakuza series is most known for its densely packed open worlds, but equal attention also needs to be shed on its ability to tell surprisingly emotional stories within that format. Yakuza 0 is the first canonical game in the Kiryu saga, which makes it the perfect starting point for fans not used to the franchise. What makes Yakuza 0 so special is its ability to effortlessly switch between emotionally charged scenes and extremely eccentric moments unnoticed, and such instances can be found in abundance throughout its 20 to 30 hour run.\n\nTrue Crime: Streets of LA\n\nReleased in 2003, True Crime: Streets of LA tried to replicate the elements of Grand Theft Auto – but failed to capture the essence of what made it all so special in the first place. That being said, True Crime does manage to impress in certain aspects including but not limited to a story that changes based on your decisions and a different approach to humor in its writing. Add to that plenty of side activities, and True Crime: Streets of LA becomes a fairly fun time.\n\nSleeping Dogs\n\nUnited Front Games’ Sleeping Dogs might feel like a GTA clone at first glance, but when you look past that initial facade – you will notice that it’s so much more than that. As an undercover cop Wei Shen, you take up the task of bringing down the Sun On Yee gang by infiltrating them from the inside. The story juggles between the two factions, and there are plenty of interesting missions peppered throughout its world that will keep you playing right through to the end.\n\nMafia 2\n\nMafia 2 is an excellent sequel that builds upon what came before in new and interesting ways. The story related to Vito Scaletta is chock full of surprises, and the ever-shifting loyalty of important characters will keep you hooked to the edge of your seat at all times. The gameplay variety has also been improved, and while there isn’t much to do outside of sightseeing in the open world, it remains an extremely engaging experience nevertheless.\n\nGrand Theft Auto 5\n\nIt’s safe to say that Grand Theft Auto 5 has transcended from just a regular open-world game to a cultural behemoth, and that’s all thanks to the well-realized open-world of Los Santos. It’s well and truly a playground of possibilities, and while a lot of fun comes from just exploring its sunny beaches and lush forests – you also get a really great story about an unlikely alliance of criminals. In addition to the intriguing story of Michael, Franklin and Trevor, something that one would expect from the series, Grand Theft Auto 5 features a vast assortment of memorable heist missions with set pieces galore.\n\nWatch_Dogs 1\n\nWhile Watch Dogs was subject to plenty of controversy when it was released in 2013, it’s undeniable that it manages to do more things right than wrong. The hacking mechanics are a perfect fit for the pseudo-stealth gameplay on offer, which adds an extra layer of flexibility to the combat mechanics. Its story about exacting revenge might not be directly related to gangsters, but you will find plenty of fellow hackers that run organized crimes throughout the city to give the same shades of action as other games on this list.\n\nSaints Row The Third\n\nSaints Row the Third takes place in the neon-lit city of SteelPort as they embark on an over-the-top comical adventure that stays true to its roots. The story takes you on an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride that’s full of violence, bloodshed, and obscenity. The gameplay revolves around taking part in different kinds of missions and navigating the city’s underworld which is composed of different gangs and their rivalries. But what makes Saints Row the Third so special is that it doesn’t take itself seriously, which helps it stand out against the rest of its contemporaries.\n\nScarface\n\nGames that are inspired from movies tend to have a bad reputation for not standing up to player expectations, but Scarface has proven the naysayers wrong. Directly taking inspiration from the Grand Theft Auto series, Scarface presents a similar open world experience as its contemporaries, and while it doesn’t quite match the level of its aspirations, it definitely has its own charm regardless. The missions do an excellent job of recreating iconic scenes from the movie, but it also introduces a new ending to mix the pot up. It’s not without its quirks, but Scarface does provide a movie-like gangster experience and remains a must-play for people who crave action.\n\nDriver: Parallel Lines\n\nDriver: Parallel Lines thrusts you in the shoes of TK, a driving virtuoso who works for crime lords all while trying to make it big in a city that’s home to all sorts of shady organizations and shoddy activities. Driver: Parallel Lines meshes elements of GTA with Need for Speed, letting you blaze through an open world map filled with different kinds of side activities and points of interest. With its impressive camerawork and realistic car handling, Driver: Parallel Lines is a unique game for open-world fans who are craving to view the world of gangsters from a different angle. While the game might not be a big improvement over prior entries in the franchise, it is still a fun game for people who want to enjoy mafia games.\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 tells a very unconventional gangster story. Instead of telling a tale of conquering the world, it shows the gradual descent of the Van Der Linde gang as they try to find their place in a rapidly changing America. Between an excellent cast of well-written characters that will stay with you long after the credits roll to plenty of exciting missions throughout its dozens of hours long story, Red Dead Redemption 2 is one game that’s just unmissable for anyone interested in such experiences."
