        "text": "As a relatively new artistic medium video games tend to be intertextually rich. Interestingly, intertextuality operates on different levels and registers which vary from game to game. In relation to the intertextually rich medium, this paper will explore the complex interdependent relationship that video games share with cinema and analyse Grand Theft Auto: Vice City in relation to that exploration.\n\nThe term intertextuality was initially conceived in 1966 by French scholar Julia Kristeva in her essay ‘Word, Dialogue, and Novel’. In the essay, Kristeva coined the term in order to describe the theory that “any text is constructed as a mosaic of quotations; any text is the absorption and transformation of another” (66). French theorist Roland Barthes later elaborated on the implications of intertextuality in a series of papers where he argues that because all texts are intertextual and “any text is a new tissue of past citations” the notion of an author is dead (39). Barthes asserts that because a text is assembled from knowledge and understandings of pre-existing texts, the author no longer exists. Barthes interpretation of the implications of intertextuality is interesting in terms of our understandings or notions of innovative or unique texts; what we may generally consider to be an original or unique text is in fact so heavily interdependent and reliant on language and previously existing text that it’s simply a construction assembled from already existing parts (Allen 5).\n\nIn terms of video game studies, intertextuality is a fascinating aspect to explore. Modern, large, cross-platform games with steady narrative structures most often provide numerous cultural references and choose to capitalize on the intertextual nature of the genre. With regards to video games, perhaps the most prevalent intertextual link lies with cinema. Author Roz Kaveney argues that specific genre-based texts are consciously intertextual in order to encourage fans of the genre to engage with the text on a deeper more personal level. Fans of a specific genre are likely to have a broad knowledge of the subject which allows the creator of a text to functionalize intertextuality in order to include narrative intricacies without the need for superfluous and broad generic explanations (Kaveney 7). Many contemporary video game developers have created a connected interdependent relationship between video games and cinema in order to construct a game-based experience around an already popular narrative. Cross-platform adventure style video game Tomb Raider draws on the hugely popular cinematic franchise Indiana Jones; the player controls protagonist Lara Croft as she raids caves for treasure. Action-adventure stealth video game Metal Gear Solid has obvious resonances with the 1981 film Escape from New York and the 1996 sequel Escape from L.A.. Massively multiplayer online role-playing game World of Warcraft relies on users to have an awareness of high fantasy and mythological narratives. At the very least the game narrative assumes the player has a certain familiarity with the fantastical rhetoric of medieval heroic quests. Fans of J.R.R. Tolkien’s high fantasy Middle Earth may enjoy the narrative of World of Warcraft on a deeper level than those who are merely aware of it. Owing to this, intertextuality allows World of Warcraft to operate at numerous registers which allows for multifaceted interpretation and creates a unique player experience based on the users existing knowledge of the genre.\n\nAs discussed by critic Tanya Krzywinska, “Intertextuality informs genre-based games at different levels and in different registers” (Corneliussen and Walker 124). The massively successful video game franchise Grand Theft Auto has been built on intertextuality. The series produces narrative worlds that immediately evoke a sense of familiarity for the players of the games. Many of the games in the GTA series parody or imitate popular film releases with an established fan base and large cult followings. Grand Theft Auto 3, for example, is set in the fictional city Liberty City which closely resembles the city of New York and the narrative is based on that of The Godfather movies. Similarly Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is set in Rockstar’s fictional version of California and echoes the narrative and setting of the critically acclaimed film Boyz in the Hood. Rockstar’s fourth instalment in the series, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, is incredibly similar to the hugely popular gangster movie Scarface. Since its release in 1983 Scarface is one of the most popular and iconic mob movies to date. The film is heavily referenced throughout the game both subtly and obviously. The title Grand Theft Auto: Vice City makes reference to the popular 1980’s television show Miami Vice; Vice City acts as a fictional version of the city of Miami where Scarface is also set. Both the game and Scarface are temporally set in the 1980s and within Vice City’s fictional game world players are immersed in 1980’s American culture. Through the functionalization of intertextuality the game can parody everything from the time period including cars, fashion, landmarks, and the famous soundtrack which is diegetically inserted into the game narrative by playing tracks through the character’s car radios.\n\nThe first cut-scene in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City immediately draws similarities with the Scarface. The scene takes place in a dark room where the camera circles a table, littered with champagne bottles and large wads of cash, is surrounded by a group of dubious looking men who are talking about the game’s protagonist Tommy Vercetti. The name Tommy shares a similarity with the name Tony, the name of the lead protagonist in Scarface, and that sense of familiarity is compounded when the men mention sending Tommy to Vice City where “even those Cuban refugees are cutting themselves a piece of some nice action” (Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, 2002). The opening credits of Scarface famously feature real-life video footage of the Cuban asylum seekers leaving Cuba during the Mariel boatlift. Owing to this, from the very first cut scene in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, players are made aware of the intertextual link between the game and previously existing texts, in this case, Scarface. The plot of the game is quickly established to resemble the plot of Scarface. Both protagonists Tommy Vercetti and Tony Montana are ambitious ex-convicts who find themselves at the bottom of the criminal hierarchy. Similarly, both the game and film employ a failed cocaine deal between the respective protagonists and Columbian drug dealers as a method to springboard the narrative into action.\n\nOnce the storyline of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is underway it tends to deviate from such a close resemblance to the plot of Scarface to a more subtle affinity, however, numerous nods to the film can be found throughout the open world of the game. For instance, Vice City is home to a nightclub called ‘The Malibu’ in which players can enter and walk around doing various activities. The interior of ‘The Malibu’ is designed to appear exactly like the fictional nightclub ‘The Babylon’ featured in a number of Scarface scenes. Other nods include a blood splattered apartment bathroom within the game that bears a striking resemblance to the bathroom featured in the famous chainsaw scene in Scarface. Furthermore, in order to carry out crime in the game players may choose a chainsaw as a weapon, identical to the one used in the film.\n\nOnce the game’s storyline draws to a close the plot once again reverts back to the plot of Scarface. In both the game and the film the penultimate scenes are staged within the lavish mansion the protagonists acquired through violent drug related crime. The famous climactic battle scenes in Scarface are replicated in the game; the set is a direct copy of its movie counterpart. Although the battle scene is much the same the results of the battle differ. In the notoriously violent scene in Scarface, after being shot an inordinate amount of times Tony Montana falls to his death from the indoor balcony of his lavish mansion. Although the death of the protagonist works well in the film it would signify a fail state in the video game or at the very least close off for players the open world which operates outside of the storyline missions in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. Owing to this, once the player completes the final mission and the protagonist defeats all of the foes attempting to kill him, the character survives which allows the player to continue to play the game outside of the main storyline.\n\nGrand Theft Auto: Vice City is not only aware of the richly intertextual nature of the video game medium, it actively functionalises intertextuality in order for the game to operate at multiple registers. Players feel an immediate sense of familiarity with the characters, plot, and culture of the game while those who are fans of Scarface may act out its notoriously violent narrative through a video game. Through its open-end game world and intertextuality players each receive a somewhat unique gaming experience. While some players may understand and enjoy the intertextually rich narratives, others may experience the narratives for the first time, while others may choose not to play the storyline at all. The game connects itself to popular cult cinema through intertextuality, both blatantly and subtly, yet through deviations establishes itself as a cult classic of its own medium.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAllen, Graham.
