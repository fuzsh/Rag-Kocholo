It is this feature of allowing players to personalize their own game experience that makes open world games one of the most popular genres of the 21st century.\n\nThe open world genre has created a number of popular video game franchises such as Grand Theft Auto, Assassin’s Creed, Saints Row and Just Cause. In this article, we’ll be listing down the top 10 open world video games that gamers should definitely have on their laptop or desktop computers. Keep in mind that we’ll be using one game per franchise to make our list as diverse as possible.\n\n10. Just Cause 3 (Square Enix Europe)\n\nJust Cause 3 combines over-the-top, Hollywood-style, explosive action with open-world style gameplay. As former mercenary Rico Rodriguez, you can liberate towns, outposts and military bases scattered throughout the island of Medici by destroying key objects located in the area. You can also complete challenges to unlock powerful mods that can help drive faster, glide further and cause even more mayhem.\n\nBesides using cars, boats and planes to explore the island, you’re also equipped with a grappling hook, wingsuit and parachute to get to hard-to-reach places and even help you find hidden collectibles.

Interactive)\n\nThough Batman: Arkham Knight brought a mediocre close to an otherwise epic superhero franchise, it’s stunning visuals, challenging combat mechanics and the ability to drive around Gotham City in the Batmobile make the game a thrilling experience.\n\nAs the Batman, only you can restore order to the crime-infested Gotham City. Strike your enemies with fear or overpower them with your martial arts prowess as you go toe-to-toe with some of Batman’s dangerous villains. However, the game’s action-packed gameplay conceals elements of horror as the Dark Knight must confront the nightmares of his past as a result of being infected with Scarecrow’s fear gas.
