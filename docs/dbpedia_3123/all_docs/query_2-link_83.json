        "text": "Can he hit civilians\n\nI haven't specifically tried to but it hasn't happened accidentally either so I'm gonna go with no.\n\nHow have you been enjoying the combat, comparatively to Nioh/Nioh 2(assuming you've played them of course)?\n\nHow is it difficulty-wise? I love Nioh 1&2, but I kinda hope Ronin is a bit less challenging, so I can focus more on exploring and absorbing the world.\n\nI think I've played the demos of both Nioh games but not more than that. The combat here is similar in that each weapon type has different fighting styles that you can learn, and enemies can be weak, resistant or neutral to them. There is also ki, which is used up by blocking/dodging/attacking. If you get hit when your ki is empty you get staggered, and the same is true for your enemies.\n\nThere's a parry mechanic which is integral. Parrying an enemy greatly reduces their ki, doing it well enough or consistently enough allows you to do a Sekiro-style brutal attack (or whatever they're called). Very satisfying.\n\nI'd say in general the combat is way more challenging than the likes of similar open-world games (Assassin's Creed for example). However, I would also say the freedom allowed to you here in terms of how you approach a situation i.e. stealth kills (which are one-shot on weaker enemies), rifles/bows, and NPCs helping you out makes it manageable. There are also set levels, so you can always skip an area and come back later and decimate everyone.\n\nHow's the open world? Does the game benefit in anyway from pursuing this direction instead of linear level design? Or does it mostly feel like filler?\n\nThis is a tricky one to answer as I think it will largely depend on what you like in open-world games. I would describe it as similar to Assassin's Creed or Ghost of Tsushima. There are cats to find, shrines to pray at, hidden chests, tough fugitive enemies to take out, etc. I'm having fun though, moving around with your horse and the glider makes traversal fun and it never feels like you're slogging through huge open nothingness.\n\nThe map is broken up into sections and you have a 'bond' with each region, as you rest at banners (bonfire checkpoints) you gradually reveal more things on the map to find which increases your bond. I wanna say that certain quests and characters wont show up at all until your bond in a region is high enough but I may be wrong about that.\n\nUltimately if this ends up being Assassin's Creed with good, challenging combat I'm satisfied lol, and so far that seems to be what this is.\n\nHow the player character works: You create a male and female character and can choose which one to continue with when they are split up (presumably early on and for a large part of the game).\n\nArekkz Gaming said:\n\nYou start the game off making two characters: a male and female who are twins. (1:10)\n\n- YouTube\n\nEnjoy the videos and music you love, upload original content, and share it all with friends, family, and the world on YouTube.\n\nGeek Culture said:\n\nIn the opening chapters, players will be able to cycle between their Twin Blades mid-combat. It doesn't feel all that different from the genre's party-switching mechanics, but proves to be fluid and satisfying. Up until a certain point, they are forced to pick one half of the pair to continue the narrative with, and the seamlessness extends to controlling allies past the fateful plot point as well.\n\nGeek Preview: Team Ninja’s ‘Rise of the Ronin’ Marks Promising First Foray Into An Open-World Samurai Epic | Geek Culture\n\nThe preview for 'Rise of the Ronin' teases a vast world teeming with life, as well as a robust and versatile combat system.\n\nI haven't specifically tried to but it hasn't happened accidentally either so I'm gonna go with no.\n\nI think I've played the demos of both Nioh games but not more than that.

Eager to learn and try some of the stances available to us, really want to see how the stances open up the combat.\n\nMan the Cowboy preview has me worried. I was already feeling Wo Long was like watering down all the good shit in Nioh as if they listened to the people complaining about it and it feels like it just ended up with those people not playing it in addition to more people that like Nioh also not playing it.\n\nOh well at least it makes it easier to play dragons dogma 2 day one but what a shame this was not the direction I wanted team ninja to head into but hope all the people that constantly complained about loot and the combat being too technical in Nioh are happy and actually give this a try.\n\nseems like they went more accessible, good for people who wanted that out of team ninja but sounds like potentially a disappointment for team ninja/genre enthusiasts. We'll see if the full game changes anything but doubtful based on his thoughts.\n\nI haven't specifically tried to but it hasn't happened accidentally either so I'm gonna go with no.\n\nI think I've played the demos of both Nioh games but not more than that.

A real shame, was shaping up to be one of my most anticipated games.\n\nWhy can't we just have Nioh 3 and be at peace 😩😩\n\nI mean I like those games myself but I feel Wo Long veered into a direction where they seem to be listening to people that want team ninja games to just be different games and it feels like it's losing a lot of the unique and interesting things along the way and I don't get the sense that it's paying off. On my side it's just kinda lessening my interest despite me being immensely hopeful to be wrong cause it's team ninja. Cowboy says at the end the cope is still there that the combat evolves much more further in but I dunno the Nioh demo's kinda cemented pretty fast how goated that combat could be.\n\nLike the ideal is always for them to kinda manage to keep the things that feel like the identity that made their previous games big and build on that.\n\nKinda like how Bloodborne nor Sekiro didn't really veer too far off what the fromsoft games were that brought them the success.\n\nBut it just feels like increasingly team ninja is just trying to make a different type of game but then they're also gonna enter a very different arena of comparisons."
