Here is the June File of the Month Interview, this time with Falloutperson416, who created New Vegas Restoration with the NVR Team. Working alongside him are GTA44, GeeZee, and CyberNathan. A big thanks to them for accepting the interview request.\n\nWhat was your inspiration for creating this mod?\n\nWhen I first saw the Strip, I really thought that it was going to be nice. A place that you could actually enjoy in the Wasteland. But when I set foot on the Strip that faitful night, it was... dissapointing. The roads had been butchered and ripped apart. There were car hulks everwhere, mounds of dirt, and the buildings didn't surprise me when I saw holes in the walls and stains on the ceilings. It really made me think \"Wow, this place is different from the Strip we saw in the trailers\". So, I started cleaning it up. One version at a time.\n\nWhat did you find most enjoyable about the creation process of this mod?\n\nThe thing that I found most enjoyable was getting to see what you just built, or all of the things you just built. Seeing it all come together was really something. When GeeZee created the Sierra Madre on the Strip mod, it was absolutly amazing. The finall product was so different from the pictures that I had seen, and it was a really cool experience. The thought of \"I just built that, and it works\" was very enjoyable.\n\nWhat were some of the challenges you came across making this mod?\n\nThe dimesnsion of the NPC's was by far the most time consuming, annoying, and most challenging thing we did. NVR adds about 50 new NPC's. We wanted them all to look different, act different etc. For example, in the Grand Millenium Grill all of the NPC's have special AI Packages and settings that give them a unique personality. Some are enjoying a nice meal, others are smoking and drinking. One guy is observing the Lucky 38 model, and others are ordering food. So, the dimension of the NPC's was the most difficult part of NVR.\n\nWhat is your favorite and least favorite part of the New Vegas tools?\n\nWell, I love the G.E.C.K. because you can use it to mod, obviously. The things I didn't really like about the New Vegas G.E.C.K., was that spell checker doesn't work, and the tool that finds problems in scripts for you was no longer there. Going through the scripts, line after line until finding the problem is a real pain, especially in the larger scripts.\n\nRoughly what was the total time it took for you guys to put this mod together so far?\n\nWell, the current version of NVR took about two months to develop. NVR has been on the Nexus for about 6 or 7 months. Back when Version 1 - 4 were around, the mod was small, the NVR Team was non-existent and the mod was mainly for my own use. I didn't really care about making it a huge project, until it started getting popular. After the release of Version 7, we had some requests that the author of New Vegas Strip Overhaul and I team up to make the best Strip overhaul possible. After that, the mod and the team slowly developed until we really had something amazing.\n\nDo you plan on any more new features in your mod? Specifically anything not listed on your mods page on the Nexus?\n\nHehe... yes, we have some things planned. Will I be specific? No. However, I will hint that the Strip in Version 11 will be twice its size of that in Version 10.\n\nDo any of you have other mods you are working on or do any of you plan to create other mods as a team? If so what might those be?\n\nYes, New Vegas Freeside Restoration - NVFR is in the making. Guess what that's about. It's being developed by the NVR Team as well, and I'm sure we will have more projects in the future. Other than that, there isn't anything else we're working on besides the next version of NVR. I'm working on a Dialog for Beginners Guide to go along with my Scripting for Beginners Guide (Well I should say I will be working on a Dialog for Beginners Guide, haven't started yet.) GeeZee has been working on Sierra Madre on the Strip, specifically the new Zion Casino. GTA44 has the upcoming Freeside Open mod in development, although it is currently on hold.\n\nTell us a little about yourselves. Where you are from, what are some of your other hobbies outside of games?\n\nFalloutperson416: I'm Seth from Saint Augustine, Florida. I obviously love to game, I studied Tae Kwon Doe for about 5 years, I play the Tenor Saxaphone, and I'm learning the Bass Guitar. I'm starting to collect old coins, and it has already taken to my liking. If you've ever talked to me in the chat rooms, you know I hate spiders.\n\nGTA44: I'm from England, UK, and if I'm not modding or playing games, I watch TV or occasionally see friends, but games take up a huge amount of my time what with the modding.\n\nGeeZee: I'm Chris from Poland, from a city close to the German border. Student of history, who loves good music in general, especially intelligent rappers (Wu-Tang Clan fanboy here), as well as spending time with friends, drinking Coca-Cola and eating KFC. It's a primitive junk food, but it's the best food in the world.\n\nCyberNathan: I'm Nathan from Virginia, and I like to bike, play golf, play soccer, and drive.\n\nWhat are some of your other favorite games if New Vegas isn't the only game you play? Any other game genres besides the RPG style games that Bethesda publishes?\n\nCrysis 2 is probably my favorite game, and it's legally moddable! Then the Fallout series, and then the Halo series. I'm going to become an TES fan when Skyrim is released. Plus there's Gears of War, Left 4 Dead... I could go on and on. I've never been a big fan of other genre's, but there's the occasional racing game here and there that I like.\n\nDo you have any advice for aspiring mod authors?\n\nIf you are really willing to apply yourself and learn how to become a good modder, then you can realize your ideas through the G.E.C.K. It can be very frustrating, time consuming and did I mension frustrating? -_- You will always have high's and low's when going through the modding process, so don't ever give up or think that you can't do it.\n\nAnd finally, do you have anything you would like to say to our readers out there?\n\nYes! Thank you all so much for your support and kindness towards NVR. I wouldn't be having an interview right now if it wasn't for the fans. Also, thanks so much to the rest of the NVR Team for there hard work on NVR, Sierra Madre on the Strip, New Vegas Strip Overhaul, the comments section... Waking up every morning to see that there are 5 new comments is really thrilling Big thanks to everyone that has assisted the NVR Team in any way, and a HUGE thanks to everyone who voted for NVR, I couldn't be happier with the results.\n\n...and that's all she wrote. Check back next month for July's File of the Month Interview!"
