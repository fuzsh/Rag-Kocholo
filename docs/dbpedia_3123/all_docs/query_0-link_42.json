        "text": "Tags: Scarface: The World is yours on PS2, Vivendi Universal Interactive (NYSE:VIV), Action/Adventure\n\nQuick Link: HEXUS.net/qaglr\n\nAdd to My Vault:\n\nVivendi Games’ Sierra Entertainment division has signed some of the biggest music artists from the 1980s to headline the in-game soundtrack for the Scarface: The World Is Yours video game. Popular 1980s acts like Grandmaster Flash, Run DMC, Judas Priest and Debbie Harry have included songs in the game alongside the entire original motion picture score by Giorgio Moroder and songs from the original motion picture soundtrack to create the ultimate Scarface music mix.\n\nThe game will also include several tracks from some of today’s hottest music artists. Information regarding contemporary music included in the game will be released at a later date. The video game is being developed by Radical Entertainment, a Sierra Entertainment studio, through a licensing agreement with Universal Studios Consumer Products Group.\n\nScarface: The World Is Yours will change the way gamers listen to music in-game by allowing players to customize their music experience through an innovative new “Mix Tape” feature. Gamers will be able to tailor their own soundtracks to their preference in a variety of different ways.\n\n“Throughout the development process we have focused on giving the player the power to choose their own in-game music experience, whether it be the Scarface purist that wants only the film score, the player that wants authentic music from the time period or the fan that craves the hottest tracks from today’s talent,” said Cindy Cook, chief strategy and marketing officer for Vivendi Games. “We are able to offer this choice through our new ‘Mix Tape’ music mixer and an incredible lineup of 1980s and contemporary artists that are bringing their hits to the game. Generations of film fans and gamers will be able to create an experience that best suits their unique tastes.”\n\nIn-game music will be playable throughout the game, whether Tony Montana is driving a car, walking down the street, in a boat chase or even while engaged in a shootout. A selection of songs will be available to the player at the start of the game, while others can be unlocked upon completing missions, found throughout the game world or purchased through the game’s “Exotics Catalog,” which allows players to indulge in the lavish lifestyle of Tony Montana by offering a vast array of items for purchase including décor for the mansion, rare vehicles, hirelings and weaponry upgrades.\n\nAbout the 1980s Music Lineup\n\nSome of the biggest names from the 1980s music scene across many genres have lent songs to the game. A partial list of music from the film’s 80’s time period includes:\n\nDebbie Harry - “Rush Rush” (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) Public Enemy - “Don’t Believe The Hype\n\nRun DMC - “Sucker MCs”\n\nJudas Priest - “Breaking the Law”\n\nRick James - “Super Freak”\n\nGrandmaster Flash - “The Message”\n\nPeter Tosh - “Steppin’ Razor”\n\nRick James - “Give It To Me Baby”\n\nBeth Anderson - “Dance Dance Dance” (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n\nBurning Spear - “Social Living”\n\nIggy Pop - “The Passenger”\n\nJohnny Cash - “I’m an Easy Rider”\n\nAbout the “Mix Tape” Music Player\n\nRevolutionizing the way music can be heard in an open-world game, the “Mix Tape” feature allows players to create their own music compilations by creating custom cassettes, 1980s-style.\n\nFor example, a hardcore fan of the 1983 classic film can choose to play only the Giorgio Moroder score to recreate an authentic Scarface film experience; a player looking to accurately immerse themselves in time period can choose to play only music from the 1980s; fans of modern music, hoping to hear today’s best hip-hop, rock and reggaeton, will be able to select to play contemporary music; those looking for more a more eclectic mix can simply choose their favorite songs for a varied musical experience.\n\nGamers will also be able to select from pre-made mixes by genre and time period, including reggae, pop, hip-hop, Latin, reggaeton and country.\n\nScarface: The World Is Yours is expected to ship this Fall for the PlayStation2 computer entertainment system, the Xbox video game system from Microsoft and Windows PC.
