Released to American audiences in 1983, this Brian DePalma–directed, Oliver Stone–penned, and Al Pacino–starring motion picture has proven so enduring that the film has been the subject of a nearceaseless stream of homages, parodies, and rip-offs since its debut. Not surprisingly, it is also hugely popular on the hip-hop scene with many artists in the genre professing great love for this celluloid masterwork.\n\nScarface : Significant Players In addition to director Brian DePalma, Hollywood superstar Al Pacino, and screenwriter Oliver Stone, Scarface also featured some fairly bigtime acting talent:\n\nName\n\nRole\n\nAl Pacino\n\nTony Montana\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer\n\nElvira Hancock\n\nMary Elizabeth Mastrantonio*\n\nGina Montana\n\nRobert Loggia\n\nFrank Lopez\n\nF. Murray Abraham**\n\nOmar Suarez\n\nEMPIRE (RE)BUILDING Before delving further into Tony’s adventures, it’s important to note one thing: this game takes an alternate tack on the events at the conclusion of the film. Whereas Tony met his end in a hail of gunfire while holed up in his mansion, in the game he manages to fight his way out and engages on a mission to rebuild his empire from scratch, which is where you, the player, come in.\n\n* This was her first major role. ** He starred in Scarface just one year before winning the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his role in Amadeus.\n\nScarface: The Man Behind the Myth As it turns out, DePalma’s 1983 version is actually based on a film produced in early 1930’s that was also entitled Scarface and, in a way, is a remake, albeit set against the then-modern backdrop of the early ’80s drug trade (as opposed to the Depression and Prohibitionera backdrop of the original). The original film was based on the life of the world’s most famous gangster: Al “Scarface” Capone, before his eventual downfall for tax evasion and subsequent incarceration and demise in prison (chronicled in another DePalma film, The Untouchables, a few years later).\n\nWith that bit out of the way, straighten your suit, load your assault rifle, and prepare to send your “little friend” out to play with its new friends—one grisly body part at a time.\n\nNot only was DePalma’s take on the story a fairly solid modern update, but both films also suffered from problems in getting the films approved for audiences. The original was delayed for two years after its completion due to worries that it glorified the gangster lifestyle and featured far too much graphic violence. The later film was initially rated X for its violence levels, and only the intervention of law enforcement (to testify as to the veracity of the film’s contents) at the appeals board eventually secured it an R rating after several edits (though, somehow, DePalma apparently managed to get his original, X-rated cut shown under the R rating). The fears of the former group of critics were actually somewhat grounded in that Al Capone was rumored to have actually quite enjoyed the film himself.\n\nPRIMA Official Game Guide\n\n4 Protected by copyright.

Herein you’ll find all the information, tips, tricks, and strategies necessary to return Tony Montana to the role of top drug kingpin in the sweltering Miami setting in the 1980s. Every page is packed with information on how best to regain Tony’s iron grip on the town that he once called his own…until his untimely demise at the conclusion of the film—a demise that he has managed to avoid. For now, anyway…\n\nDefault Controls Action: On Foot Character Movement Look/Move Camera Cycle Weapons — Conceal Weapon Run/Wall Cover Reload/Melee-Counter Taunt, Talk; Hold for Blind Rage Action/Engage Fire/Punch Secondary Fire Lock-On, Strafe SAT Phone Menu Center Camera Toggle Crouch Pause Turn Tape Player On/Off\n\nAction: Vehicle\n\nAction: Menus\n\nXbox\n\nPS2\n\nPC\n\nSteer Camera Weapon Select — Conceal Weapon Accelerate Brake/Reverse Hand Brake Enter/Exit Vehicle Fire Look Behind Lock-On SAT Phone Menu Cycle Camera Angles Horn/Taunt Pause Turn Tape Player On/Off\n\nNavigate Menu Options — Navigate Menu Options Navigate Menu Options Navigate Menu Options Select Menu Option — — Go Back a Screen — — — — — — — —\n\nLeft Stick Right Stick a or d w x 1 3 2 4 8 6 7 5 r g 9 0\n\nLeft Stick Right Stick a or d w x u p o I R r L l R3 L3 s t\n\nW, A, S, D V Mouse Wheel Arrow Keys 3 e R T E < > ? t h LEFT CTRL q T\n\nGuide Contents Gameplay Primer Here you’ll find everything you need to know to achieve complete and utter victory over the myriad forces arrayed against Tony. This includes (but is not limited to): • Combat: Featured here are both hand-to-hand and more lethal options, with tips on how to make the most of your available tools. • Empire Building: This is the pulsing heart of the meta-game—the game within the game. While there is a straightforward mission mode (covered in the Walkthrough section), there is much, much more to the game than simply going from point A to point B. In here we cover everything from working with Dealers (or, perhaps, working them) to conquering territory that your rivals would like to keep as their own.\n\nThis section goes into general strategies applicable to the game at large. The Walkthrough section also details the meta-game as it pertains to what point you are at in the main game. • Balls: This section details how to build up and maximize your ability to earn Balls. Balls are the basic unit of currency in the game when it comes to dealing with the various ladies. You also use Balls to charge your Rage meter.\n\nWalkthrough The Walkthrough section takes you step-by-step through how to beat the game inside and out. If you want to fill Tony’s shoes, heed the words written here.\n\nAppendices Cars, people, cheats and more! This large section is laden down with all manner of in-depth info on all the things we couldn’t put elsewhere in the guide. Oh, and did we mention a complete section of Cheats?\n\nTips, Notes, and Cautions These include all sorts of helpful hints to aid you in getting the most out of the game. They could contain some extra information for defeating a boss, or a shortcut that gets you to your goal quicker. These include various bits of info that don’t generally have a direct bearing on the gameplay at hand. They could act as a reminder or point out a landmark that may become important later in the game. Paying close attention to these could mean the difference between life and death for Tony. Generally, these refer to situations where life, limb, or both are in peril. Ignore these at your own risk!\n\nARE CHU READY, MENG? With that all behind us, it’s time to turn the page and begin learning what it takes to be Tony Montana. You don’t want to let Tony down, do you?\n\n5\n\nprimagames.com\n\nProtected by copyright.

Within you’ll find a wealth of info, tips, tactics and exactly how it is you need to go from point a to point b (and beyond) to actually reach the end of the game.\n\nScarface is, essentially, two (or, perhaps more accurately, two dozen) different games in one. On the one hand you have a standard, missionbased progression that has a distinct beginning, middle, The game within the game and end. However, under-girding this is a web that permeates every aspect of the main game, insinuating itself within and without the basic forward motion of the plot. This is known as the meta-game.\n\nWhile the Walkthrough does touch on the meta-game in a cursory manner, it is mainly designed to complement it so be sure to read both if you really want to see everything the game has to offer.\n\nWhile we’ll discuss this more later, the meta-game essentially boils down to all the things you can do that aren’t directly tied to the game’s mission-based structure. And this is no small amount of additional gameplay, as you will discover later in this chapter.\n\nSome key points: • Step by step, screenshot-laden sequences with expert advice to get through the hairiest encounters in some semblance of one piece. • Each Walkthrough chapter is riddled with in-close maps to give you a detailed overview of where you need to go very step of the way. • When the time comes to engage in the meta-game aspet, you’ll be instructed on what “Freelance Plans” you should make next: this includes building Reputation, earning cash, and gentler reminders that there is more to Tony’s life than seeking revenge on Sosa.\n\nWe start with a general introduction to basic game concepts (intimidation, reputation, etc.) and then move on to more detailed information (primarily concerning the meta-game aspects).\n\nINTIMIDATION: GETTING YOUR POINT (FORCEFULLY) ACROSS Throughout the game you’ll find that communicating with the various lowlifes, miscreants, and thugs you encounter isn’t as simple as stepping up, brandishing a weapon, and concluding the deal with the butt of that firearm. You’ll need to employ a basic tool for all unscripted conversations: the Intimidation meter.\n\nChu talking to me?!\n\nWhen you initiate a chat with various people throughout the game (each one is discussed in more detail later), you have indirect control over a meter that gauges precisely how well you manage to intimidate someone. The better you do, the better the results. The worse you do, well, here’s hoping Tony has a nice plot at the local cemetery.\n\nPRIMA Official Game Guide\n\n6 Protected by copyright.

The goal is to fill the Action meter as full as possible without going past 100 percent full. The closer you get to 100 percent, the more favorable the outcome. This could result in a better rate at the bank, more Balls earned for directly intimidating someone, or getting a better price for coke at the local dealer. The downside is that if you over fill the Action meter, the Result meter will reflect it as a lower result. The net effect of that could be as simple as paying more interest at the bank or, in certain situations, being gunned down by a bunch of angry drug suppliers. This meter is your lifeblood in the game and your primary gateway to the criminal underground. It is also important for just about any transaction of note (this makes it especially key in the meta-game). Spend time getting this act down to a science, because your life and livelihood depend upon it. Also, as your reputation increases, you’ll find that the “safe spot” on the meter also widens out, making dealing with people that much easier.\n\nRandom Acts of Intimidation Early in the game, before you have much in the way of reputation, you’ll notice that certain people you bump into on the street and gang leaders give you the ability to intimidate them. Take people up on this, Yeah, I thought so. because successful intimidation nets you some easy rep increases and is good practice for the more dangerous situations where you’ll employ the meter.\n\nIf you’re familiar with RPGs (role-playing games), you are familiar with the concept of experience and how accruing it allows you access to more and better equipment, magic, and more powerful attacks. Well, reputation functions basically the same—the more you have of it, the better the cars, boats, henchmen, weapons, etc. you can get. It also advances the game’s over-arching storyline. You earn it, in varying amounts, through all manner of activities, including: • Successfully completing missions • Successfully conquering territory (buying fronts and such) • Purchasing exotics • Winning races\n\nThe quickest (and, by far, easiest) way to earn large quantities of reputation is through buying exotics. Of course this is easier said than done because, as the game progresses, they become grossly expensive, necessitating the sort of thing that Tony does best (mainly things that society generally frowns upon). Check the tables in this chapter to get an idea of just how much money it will cost.\n\nThe good news is that, once earned, you can never lose reputation regardless of how bad things get (say, if you have a severe run of bad luck and you fail mission after mission, etc.) or even if you don’t save for a while. The bad news is that once you have a taste, you’ll want more. Luckily, the game obliges you because, as the game progresses, the risk/reward ratio moves steadily in your favor.\n\nReputation and What It Gets You Reputation is handled on a scale of 0 to 8 (you are at zero till you regain your mansion), with a new level meted out at pre-set amounts:\n\nREPUTATION LEVELS There are gray areas (literally) on the various meters. It is entirely possible to “play it safe” and stop the meter at 70 percent in many cases. This isn’t entirely desirable as you’ll be leaving money on the table and/or still playing Russian roulette with your life in some cases, but it’s better going this route if getting more than 90 percent proves elusive.\n\nREPUTATION: MAKING THE WORLD YOURS\n\nLevel\n\nPoint Amount to Level\n\nLevel\n\nPoint Amount to Level\n\n0\n\n—\n\n5\n\n3,000,000\n\n1\n\n50,000\n\n6\n\n6,000,000\n\n2\n\n150,000\n\n7\n\n12,000,000\n\n3\n\n500,000\n\n8\n\n20,000,000\n\n4\n\n1,000,000\n\nAs you meet each of these\n\ntiers, more and more of the game is unlocked and the overall plot is advanced.

Throughout this guide you’ll also find references to reputation and what is unlocked as you progress.\n\nWhen moving about Miami and its environs, you need to know where to go and how to get there. Factor in whether you’re likely to meet heavy resistance en route (or at your ultimate destination).

Unauthorized or unlawful copying or downloading expressly prohibited.\n\nCar Theft: Not a Good Idea\n\nTeleportation and Speed Demons (Continued) Finally, for Smuggler’s Run (Miami) and Lobster Cay (the islands) races, wait till you can afford the very pricey Ares Mark III. This one-seater pocket rocket, though light on armor, is extremely fast and, though it can’t compare to the Rattler, it’s about one-third the cost. For more info on racing, please see the “Fun and Games” section.\n\nOut Chu Go! You have access to more than just the cars Tony purchases. You can carjack any car in the game. However, this drastically increases your visibility.\n\nDriver’s Ed\n\nThere are a few cases where you can make off with a car without penalty: if a car is merely sitting parked in an area, you can get in and take off and will, likely, get away without so much as a sidelong glance. We only recommend this in a few situations, though: • When you simply have to get away from a bad situation such as a gang extermination gone horribly awry. • When you want to use vehicles as additional armor and shoot from the vehicle, thereby keeping your hide reasonably intact. • When you’re broke and can’t afford to repair the cars you own.\n\nIn general you have ready access to your own, better cars.\n\nTeleportation and Speed Demons\n\nRubbing, racing, and sliding The basics for controlling the various automobiles and boats are pretty straightforward—especially the boats as they only go forward and backward. Autos, however, are a different story for a number of reasons: • Autos can powerslide, Rockford, and do forward/reverse 360s, all advanced techniques. • Autos can engage in races (Smuggler’s Run, for example) • Autos can earn you Balls (see “Balls” section for more info).\n\nAround town in no time flat\n\nFast track to the islands and back\n\n• Autos make good weapons even when they aren’t loaded with additional weaponry.\n\nWhile you can drive or sail anywhere in the game with any of the vehicles available, there are two special cases where you can travel, instantaneously, between areas on the map. With the stretch limo (rep level 1) and the floatplane Smuggler’s Run ownage (rep level 4) you can travel, immediately, to any front or storehouse you own with the former and any dock with the latter. Clearly this cuts down on travel times tremendously as you can, essentially, “warp” around the map (check the map for all the front/storehouse and dock locations to get an idea of what we’re talking about).\n\nPowerslides\n\nThe downside, of course, is cost: the limo costs $250,000 and, though it’s available very early in the game, you likely can spend that money better, at least initially. We recommend looking at the limo around level 4/after conquering Downtown. The floatplane is even more valuable because you can make instant trips to the islands (normally a long boat ride fraught with piratical problems)—buy that the moment you can.\n\nPRIMA Official Game Guide\n\n12 Protected by copyright.

This is fantastic for taking corners far faster than otherwise possible.\n\nCruise Control\n\nThere are, however, a few caveats involved: • Depending on your skill level, you could slide into other cars, buildings, and pedestrians, all of which will increase your visibility to varying degrees. • When being pursued by LEOs, gang members, etc., if you biff a powerslide, they will mercilessly pin you in and it could rapidly become “game over” or “you’re f—ked.”\n\nRockford\n\nThis applies to both boats and cars and refers to your ability to track a target (moving or otherwise) while your car continues in its current direction, allowing you to steer and target/shoot at the same time. We suggest you use this only sparingly or in places where there’s lot of room to work. This is especially the case in boats or at the Oakley Drive-In where there’s plenty of space to ride without crashing into things.\n\nVamos a War: Combat School COMBAT CONTROLS\n\nA Rockford is simply accelerating rapidly in reverse, slamming on the brakes, and spinning the car around 180 degrees (so you’re facing the opposite direction) with little-to-no loss of velocity. These are tricky and take a fairly decent amount of space to pull off initially. The reward is that it’s good for escaping from tight situations where a three-point turn would result in your being pinned in and killed (because it took too much time to escape).\n\nAction\n\nForward/Reverse 360\n\nXbox\n\nPS2\n\nPC\n\nMovement\n\nLeft Stick\n\nLeft Stick\n\nW, A, S, D\n\nCycle Weapons\n\na or d\n\na or d\n\nW\n\nConceal Weapon\n\nx\n\nx\n\n3\n\nRun/Wall Cover\n\n1\n\nu\n\ne\n\nReload/Melee Counter\n\n3\n\np\n\nR\n\nFire/Punch\n\n8\n\nR\n\nL\n\nSecondary Fire\n\n6\n\nr\n\nMouse 3\n\nLock-On/Strafe\n\n7\n\nL\n\nN\n\nWe strongly suggest you run through the Combat Tutorial at the very beginning of the game.

Naturally civilians are even less resilient than this motley band of mutants and You better have a big gun ornery LEOs, so when you’re busily clearing a street corner of random gang members, try not to hit the peds—the LEOs aren’t big fans of that. You can compare these health values with the damage values of the weapons featured in this chapter to give you a good idea of what your odds are like against a given enemy with a given weapon: Base Enemies\n\n150\n\nSkull\n\n150\n\nSosa\n\n150\n\nCops\n\n200\n\nDEA\n\n350\n\nSwat\n\n500\n\nCoked Out Gang Leaders\n\n600\n\nCoked Out Chainsaw Wielding Maniacs\n\n200–400\n\nHaymaking for fun and profit You can counter an incoming enemy attack with the counter button. Timing is important here, so hit it just as the enemy’s blow is about to connect to return the hurt on your opponent.\n\nBy and large, melee combat is an absolute last resort. Tony has access to large quantities of guns and other weapons, so use them.\n\nMedic!\n\nNot surprisingly, the farther up the chain you go, the harder your foes become, with those under chemical stimulation generally proving to be the biggest nuisances. You do not want to go toe-to-toe with any but the most basic foe bare-knuckled (sometimes, though, you won’t have that option).\n\nHand-to-Hand Though it’s natural to want to rely on firearms, sometimes you’re forced to rely on your fists for plot and story-progression reasons. Therefore it’s important to at least understand the basics of handto-machete/pistol/etc. combat when those unfortunate, firearm-free, moments arise. Tony can make a few basic attacks when you repeatedly press the “fire” button. This results in a successive string of attacks culminating in a combination (or combo, for short). This volley of blows will lay out most foes you manage to land successive blows upon.\n\nPRIMA Official Game Guide\n\nOutside of healing via Rage (which, actually is the most efficient and least cumbersome way to do so) you have the option of visiting blood mobiles scattered over the Miami area. One hit from them and you’ll be back to 100% in no time. You can also visit any front with a cash register to receive a health refill. Barring that, you also can find health packs scattered about various points in the game—usually in areas where you’ll have to deal with some pretty hairy situations. Unlike blood mobiles, however, these will not max out your health with one hit if you’re critical.\n\n14 Protected by copyright. Unauthorized or unlawful copying or downloading expressly prohibited.\n\nBa s i c s — Wa l k t h ro u g h — Ap p e n d i c i e s\n\nDis Is How De Game Is Played, Meng You’ll also find a few, scattered melee weapons such as the everpopular machete and lead pipe. While better than relying on your fists alone, they are still poor cousins to even the most basic pistol.\n\nWhile locked-on, run toward your foe and tap the run button to make a sudden charge. This is especially useful with the shotgun as it triggers the “Execution” animation and gives you a second or two to breathe if you’re surrounded.\n\nZigzag and Zagzig\n\nOw!\n\nOuch!\n\nIn some cases (certain missions, certain types of leads) you will be sans weaponry and will have to rely on your fists.\n\nRanged Combat Dodging bullets one zig at a time Find yourself being fired on from all corners with no cover in sight? Zigzag as you close distance with potential victims (assuming your current weapons can’t take them out at range). While always moving forward, continue to make short feints left and right to keep foes from mowing you down (they can’t lock-on quite as well as Tony).\n\nCircle Strafing\n\nSay hello to my little friends—thousands of them. Ah, now, this is what it’s all really about: good ol’ fashioned, highly illegal, and utterly deadly weapons of mass decapitation (in certain cases, anyway). This game is a weapon-laden playground for the trigger-happy maniac in all of us. Before we delve into specific strategies, let’s define a few basic terms: Lock-On: A lock-on button allows you to target and track any foe you choose. Manual Aim: In cases where you can’t use lock-on or if you’re going for maximum Balls (see “Balls” section) this simply means firing without using the lock-on function. Naturally this makes hitting targets much harder.\n\nCircle and destroy\n\nRush and Attack\n\nWhile being able to lock-on makes this somewhat automatic, there are times when you either won’t be able to (with weapons that don’t allow lock-on) or you may be going for maximum Balls with manual aim.\n\nOuch.\n\n15\n\nprimagames.com\n\nProtected by copyright. Unauthorized or unlawful copying or downloading expressly prohibited.\n\nWeapons Locker\n\nRaking\n\nAt home and away: Always time for gunplay Throughout the course of Tony’s murderous rampage across the greater Miami area, you’ll accumulate a great many weapons with which to dispatch your foes with extreme prejudice. Before we delve into individual weapons, you need to be aware of a few items: • You can carry only up to three weapons at one time.\n\nLeave them screaming\n\n• You can switch out weapons only at your weapons locker: either in your office at the mansion or in the trunk of any of Tony’s cars.\n\nIf you don’t feel terribly secure in your manual aiming, you can do what we’ve dubbed raking: move the targeting reticle up and down, from head to crotch, while using automatic weapons. You’re likely to score lots of extra Balls as you’ll tag their heads, crotch, etc. instead of simply relying on the luck of the lock-on. This scores far more Balls (see “Balls” section for more info).\n\n• All firearms require ammo. No ammo, no bang-bang.\n\nCover and Shoot Fists\n\nMachete\n\nPipe These weapons can be picked up off of dead enemies. You cannot purchase these, presumably because the mark-up just isn’t there.\n\nPeek a boo(m)! This is pretty basic (and covered in the tutorial) but you’d be surprised at how effective this can be (especially against gangs in narrow alleys). Simply stand next to a wall at a corner and peer around with the aiming function. It makes it much safer to take out interlopers when you have five feet of concrete between you and them—just don’t hang out there too long, or you’ll catch some nasty return fire.\n\nGenerally speaking, you use melee weapons (and this includes Tony’s fists) only when you have no other option. The big problem is that attacking with melee gear is fairly slow and fairly weak (the chainsaw, however, deserves special mention). If you have the option of hoisting a machete or a sturdy lead pipe, there’s also likely plenty of ammo lying about.\n\nYou cannot access most weapons until you increase your reputation level. With each successive level, you gain access to more firearms, etc. Also you need to hire the weapons dealer henchman (he becomes unlocked at Reputation Level 2) so that you can buy from him.\n\nPRIMA Official Game Guide\n\n16 Protected by copyright.

Prime situations for Rage usage: • When you’re low on health and can’t get to a blood mobile or a health pack. • When you’re hopelessly outnumbered by a huge array of foes and all hope looks lost.\n\nShooting cops is bad—you will lose Balls for doing it, so avoid at all costs!

You’ve completed the first couple of missions but have yet to be exposed to the web that binds the entire game together. This web is navigated, almost exclusively, via the SAT Phone (shorthand for SATellite Phone) secured during the course of the mission “Gaspar Gomez.” What you need to know, in the early going, is that this wonderful little toy is much more than a simple telephone (in fact, it’s more than the latest cell phone could ever hope to manage).\n\nBusiness Leads: The Bricks and Mortar\n\nBanking: Saving Your Money (and Tony’s Life)\n\nSave often! You want to be intimately familiar with the bank for two basic reasons:\n\nIf there’s a basic building block of the entire empire building process, it’s the Felix lead. Using Tony’s SAT Phone and dialing up (who else?) Felix from the Business menu, you’re presented with several options, multiples of which are usually Felix leads. You use these leads to contact suppliers all over Miami. Initially anyway, this is the only way to score coke to sell to dealers.\n\n1. You need to launder your ill-gotten gains from your various criminal activities (which you’ll do very early in the game for the first time.\n\nThere are also Sandman leads. The major differences between the two are:\n\n2. Save!\n\n1. Sandman leads are to the islands what Felix leads are to Miami: Gateways to coke suppliers.\n\nIf you don’t launder your cash, any time you die or are busted by the cops, you’ll lose all your dirty money. And it’s important to save often so you don’t lose progress. So remember: save early and often!\n\n2. Because you do only large deals with the suppliers derived from Sandman leads, you must smuggle all results from these leads to your storehouses in Miami. With the contacts from Felix leads, your travel time is significantly reduced (and much less death-prone). 3. All coke earned from Sandman leads has to be smuggled into Miami and dropped at storehouses because the amounts are far too great to dispose of on the dealer level. For the following strategy, you can substitute Sandman lead wherever you see Felix lead.\n\nKeep gang heat low when on Felix and Sandman leads. The lower your heat, the better the odds of securing larger and larger suppliers (see the “Heat” section for more details).\n\nBusiness, turf , and heat: making the world yours\n\nThe phone itself gives you access to all manner of activities (some of which have already been discussed) but the categories of Business, Turf, and Heat are most interesting: Business: From here you access all leads, suppliers, missions, etc. If you aren’t sure what to do next, this is the place to start. We’ll delve into all facets of this in this section. Turf: Use this menu to check how your world-conquering aspirations are panning out. By conquering fronts, taking out gangs, and consolidating storehouses (all discussed in the “Turf” section of this chapter) you earn greater reputation and gradually proceed through the game’s main plotline. Heat: This essentially exists to undermine all of your illicit activity. It makes doing business much harder than it otherwise would be and is broken down into two categories: Gang and Police.\n\n23\n\nprimagames.com\n\nProtected by copyright. Unauthorized or unlawful copying or downloading expressly prohibited.\n\nYou can have only one supplier active at a time, so it doesn’t generally make sense to do multiple Felix leads in a row unless you’re doing them for (relatively) easy rep.\n\nAnatomy of a Lead No FELIX LEAD MISSION\n\nSuccess?\n\nAssassination Runs No\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nSell to Dealer Get Paid\n\nSell to Front\n\nSuccess?\n\nYes\n\nSuccess?\n\nSupplier Mission\n\nNo\n\nStorehouse/ Distribution Visit Bank\n\nYes\n\nSuccess?\n\nThis flowchart shows exactly how a Felix lead starts and where it ultimately leads with stops at key points along the way. Some details: 1. The process begins at the Felix lead itself. If you succeed on your first lead, you move on to meeting with a supplier. This could entail taking out gang members, government agents, or any number of other shady types as a favor for a contact. You typically first speak to the contact to start the mission (sometimes these contacts are under draconian time limits so be nearby when accepting or you’ll waste a lot of time trying to reach him and have nothing to show for it) and, from there, you’re assigned a group of people to eliminate. Now, the trick here is that:\n\n2. At a supplier, you attempt to secure some product. If you fail you must go back and do another Felix lead. 3. If you can convince a supplier to sell to Tony, it’s now time to decide how best to dispose of the acquired product: via a dealer, via a front (assuming you have at least one), or via a storehouse (again, assuming you have at least one). 4. After you’ve completed a transaction with a dealer, you are free to continue to seek out other dealers to continue the process. If you opt for the front route, you then need to go back and secure more product. If you store it, you can then undertake a distribution mission (once you’ve amassed sufficient product). 5. All roads do eventually lead to the bank if you are wise (to save and to launder your filthy lucre). This chart holds true for all the basic Felix leads. Later on you’ll find that you’ll need to smuggle contraband from the islands. At this point, the Felix lead is essentially obsolete. The only difference in flow, however, is that you always need to take your ill-gotten coke to your storehouse and not proceed to immediately sell it on the street and/or at a front. Ah, but before you can get to the suppliers, you have to perform a mission for the client on the other end of the lead (think of Felix as your middleman to the steamy underbelly of Miami’s crime cartels). These missions come in a variety of forms, but they all boil down to one of several different templates:\n\nIf you don’t care for a particular template type, just cancel it and select another till you get one you do want—there’s no penalty for abandoning Felix leads.\n\n1. They typically won’t all be in one spot (though they can be, on rare occasions) so you must go to multiple sites to take out a handful of foes at each location. 2. There are excellent odds (especially when dealing with gang hits) that you’ll end up having to wipe out an entire gang nest (see gangs for more info) just to knock off three or four guys. You can tell this is the case when your mini-map lights up with far more dots than you are contracted to ace. 3. If a time limit is involved, take out the primary targets first before trying to eliminate any additional interlopers (this includes any wayward LEOs). The other tricky component of missions such as this is that they don’t generally occur in shady back alleys. This means that, on many occasions, you’ll find Tony, in broad daylight, littering the street with small (and, later in the game, large) arms fire. This, naturally, means massive visibility and heat issues (from both gangs and cops). The key is to get in, kill who you have to kill, and get out. If you stumble into a gang nest, now is not the time to have it out with them—just make a note and come back and wax them after the heat’s died down and, more importantly, after your Felix lead is complete. Beyond that, it’s pretty cut and dried: 1. Follow the yellow map markers, roll up, and mow down the offending target(s). 2. Get back in your car and proceed to the next map marker. 3. Wash, rinse, repeat (as necessary).\n\nPRIMA Official Game Guide\n\n24 Protected by copyright. Unauthorized or unlawful copying or downloading expressly prohibited.\n\nBa s i c s — Wa l k t h ro u g h — Ap p e n d i c i e s\n\nDis Is How De Game Is Played, Meng Sometimes you accomplish the initial mission objective (say, kill 10 out 10 gang members) only to have a secondary objective tacked on out of the blue. You must complete this objective as well to clear the mission. This usually amounts to chasing down and killing more thugs. Sometimes you find that you have to return to the person who gave you the mission. Do so and you’ll be rewarded with a nice new supplier so that you can start earning some cash instead of playing footsie with random lowlifes. (Tony prefers dealing with more profitable lowlifes such as drug dealers and their bottom-feeding kin.)\n\nThe good news is that, on the whole, these missions are pretty easy. You usually have a henchmen and the person under siege also shooting, so you don’t have to worry about being overwhelmed. You also don’t have to worry about being killed, because the attackers focus on the person you’re supposed to save.\n\nThere is a variation on the protection template. You accept the mission and are instantly attacked by waves of enemies. In this case, there’s only one person to defend: yourself!\n\nDelivery Runs\n\nProtection Runs\n\nProtection runs sound pretty straightforward (and they are). The goal on these missions is to protect someone from an untimely demise. This, oddly enough, generally takes the form of a Mac 10-toting woman (and, in most cases, a prostitute) trying to fend off a gang of bloodthirsty misanthropes armed with everything from chainsaws to high-powered automatic weapons. The actual progression of events goes something like this: 1. Get the lead and meet the contact for the mission assignment. Sometimes, however, you don’t have to meet anyone so simply skip to step 2.\n\nThese can take place on land or water and are fairly straightforward. The basic gist is that someone has a package (or series of packages) that needs to be delivered at key spots in Miami. You’re given a vehicle (and usually not a very good one) to make your run. This isn’t like delivering pizza—you encounter all sorts of gang action as you try to maneuver your ’73 station wagon through coked up gang bangers who want what you’re carrying and (unfortunately) consider killing Tony a necessary (and entirely fun) part of the job. There’s also a car theft variation on this theme, where you steal car and deliver it to a designated spot. Follow these tips: • Use shortcuts: Use all shortcuts (via alleys for auto-based deliveries or weaving between boats, over sandbars, etc. for water-based runs). Your enemies don’t deal very well when you go off the beaten track, so use this to your advantage.\n\n2. Once you’ve received it, follow the mission marker to the defender’s position and get out of your car.\n\n• Depending on how well-armed you are, you might consider getting out and blowing away your pursuers. But your foes are extremely aggressive and they will attempt to run you down if you get out of the car or if you slow down and/or stop to deal with them from within your vehicle (also remember that you’re usually driving a less-than-sturdy vehicle). Unless you have some of the Reputation Level 4 and up weapons, this is probably not your best move.\n\n3. Staying close to the person you need to protect, keep an eye on your mini-map and rotate around, lock-on button held down, and acquire targets as they come within range.\n\n• On the water, keep a keen eye out for Coast Guard vessels—they generally aren’t terribly fond of people of Tony’s disposition.\n\n4. Mow them down mercilessly. Pay special attention to chainsaw wielders as they can mow down the person you’re supposed to be protecting quite quickly. 5. Keep an eye on the time limit. Once it’s up, any remaining foes hightail it. It’s inadvisable to chase them. 6. Once it’s all clear, return to the initial contact, claim your reward, and complete the mission.\n\nIn addition to the protection part of the mission, the mission start is often timed (as in you’ll be given two minutes to reach the contact just so you can pick up the mission). Again, be near the lead before taking it, just in case.\n\nA basic delivery run would look like this: 1. Receive the lead then head out to meet the contact. 2. Get the mission underway by heading for the car or boat set aside on the map for your run. 3. At this point you’ll know precisely how many drops you have to make before satisfying the mission requirements. Head around the map and drive over the hotspots marked on the map to dispose of some of your contraband, then repeat until this is done. 4. As is the case with other missions, you’ll find that cops and coke heads aren’t going to make life easy. So watch your back! 5. After you’ve made your last drop off, return the borrowed ride to its designated spot. 6. Return to the contact to complete the mission/receive your reward.\n\n25\n\nprimagames.com\n\nProtected by copyright. Unauthorized or unlawful copying or downloading expressly prohibited.\n\nMake sure you have these templates dialed in because you’ll be doing these runs the entire game. Once you get the basics down, you should have little trouble.\n\nMake certain you are in the general vicinity of a Felix lead when you undertake it. Because many of them are timed, you may find it impossible to get to where you need to go in the amount allotted. And, yes, the floatplane and limo are disabled for these runs, so no luck there.\n\nFelix Turf Leads As the game progresses, Felix leads start to come in two flavors: original (that you’ve now done many times) and turf. Felix turf leads operate exactly the same as Felix leads except that, instead of Turf: The easy way getting a supplier as a reward, you are given a percentage of turf in the borough you are currently working on (usually five percent). Other than that, the mission templates are precisely those of regular Felix leads and, in many cases, make for fairly easy accrual of territory—this saves you the headache of wiping out stacks of gangs in a borough.\n\nMuscle Runs\n\nSuppliers As the title may imply, you have to rough up someone (or a group of someones) for a contact. For these runs you do not employ firearms (regardless of how much you might want to) as it ends in immediate mission failure if you overdo it and kill the target.\n\nIf you’re very careful with some of the lower-powered weapons, you can actually take one shot at a target and end the sequence immediately. That said, experiment with this at your own risk: A little too much “eagerness” on Tony’s part and the lead is hosed. A muscle run goes like this: 1. You get the lead and meet your contact, who assigns someone (or a group) who needs to be taught a lesson and/or scared—but not killed! 2. You proceed to the hotspot where the victim is located and administer the thrashing. Pay special attention to the life bar at the screen’s top right—if you deplete it, you’ve lost the mission. 3. As you get the target down to about one-tenth total health, a message flashes on-screen stating that the target has had enough. STOP beating on him immediately as it’s likely that one more punch will do him in and blow the lead. 4. Depending on the situation, you may have to take out only one person, but that person has friends. Focus on taking out the one person in question and the rest will leave you alone. 5. The one caveat is if you have to teach a gang leader a lesson. In that case, take out the gang bangers so they don’t kill you in the process. Just don’t take out the target while you’re hosing the area down with hot lead (needless to say, indiscriminate use of high explosives is frowned upon in these scenarios).\n\nSuppliers are the reward for completing Felix leads and are what Tony uses to build his vast cocaine empire. Early in the game you use suppliers earned by completing Felix leads. Later in the game, you need to venture to the islands south of Miami to feed his insatiable need for money—and the reputation it can buy—by completing Sandman leads. Supplier missions, on the whole, are far more straight-forward than Felix leads, though that does not mean they are always easier— depending on your heat levels, you could find them incredibly difficult (this is especially true when smuggling is involved). The amount of coke you can supply in a given deal is directly related to your reputation level and how far you’ve progressed in the game’s myriad missions. For example, you can’t even access the Reputation Level 3 suppliers till you have at least one storehouse for holding your vaster and vaster amounts of contraband:\n\n6. Once the target has been sufficiently “motivated” to cease doing whatever he was doing, return to the contact to collect your reward.\n\nPRIMA Official Game Guide\n\n26 Protected by copyright.

Tony’s risk level goes up tremendously in the process, because smuggling incurs all manner of pitfalls and pirates (not to mention the US Coast Guard).\n\nYou can also manage varying degrees of success that result in you getting away with the coke at a better price. Later in the game (on the larger suppliers) you have to deal with the supplier himself. If the heat is high, you first have to Intimidate one of his guards; if the heat is low, you only have to talk to the supplier. Tthis makes the process extra-tricky because now you have to go through two layers of trouble to get your merchandise. Some general supplier rules: • Keep your heat (see “Heat” section for more details) as low as possible. The chance of you getting out of these deals with product at high heat is very rare because your margin for error on the meter is practically nil. • Attacking suppliers and stealing their drugs is not worth it—you won’t get nearly the amount of coke you otherwise would and you risk death. • If any harm comes to the supplier or his henchmen the deal will fail. This means that if you’re engaged in a firefight (with a gang, for example) do not approach the supplier (this is especially important in the islands). • Supplier deals can time out if you let them linger too long after completing a lead, so don’t tarry! • Don’t approach suppliers with guns drawn unless you intend to kill them all, because that’s what they’ll attempt to do to you.\n\nMaking the Deal\n\n• Don’t steal the supplier’s car (you might find a few grams inside though) unless you’re broke or have a death wish.\n\nDealers\n\nA supplier deal is a very basic process: 1. Secure a supplier by completing a Felix (or Sandman) lead. 2. Undertake a supplier mission from the Business menu of the SAT Phone.\n\nGetting paid\n\n3. Meet with the supplier and an assorted group of surly thugs.\n\nDealers are the most immediate and lowest level way to earn cash in the game. First, of course, you have to have some product to sell—go back and check out the supplier section for more details on that—but, at least for early in the game, dealers are your primary source of revenue.\n\n4. Speak to the supplier. At this point you’ve likely had little experience with the Intimidation meter. After initiating the conversation, you’re presented with the meter and you must stop in the correct zone or you’ll end up with one of several (not all favorable) results:\n\nAs the game progresses (sooner than you think) dealers become less and less necessary. In fact, by the time you have your first storehouse up and running (in Little Havana) you should be pretty much ready to graduate to distribution, cutting out the bottom-feeders completely.\n\nGood and bad results If you biff the deal badly, you end up getting attacked by the supplier’s troops. This is bad because they’re generally surrounded by large numbers of miscreants looking for trouble. In these cases, you can always steal the nearest gang vehicle and make a quick getaway (it also doesn’t hurt to run down a few of them while you’re at it).\n\n27\n\nprimagames.com\n\nProtected by copyright. Unauthorized or unlawful copying or downloading expressly prohibited.\n\nThe basic smuggling process is pretty simple:\n\nSeeing Double (and Triple, and Quadruple)\n\n1. Meet with the supplier and do the deal.\n\n[15-016.bmp]\n\n2. Once you’ve completed the deal, take a car (or boat) and get your drugs to a storehouse—this is easier said than done.\n\nYou look awfully familiar… There are a limited number of characters acting as dealers. It’s not uncommon for one dealer to be active in other parts of town at the same time. This is normal and these are the guys you should look out for when looking to drop some coke in small amounts.\n\nWorking with dealers is a necessary, early game “problem” because you simply have no other meaningful way to generate income. The good news is, dealing with them is a very basic and very easy way to make some money, especially after the somewhat difficult Felix leads and supplier runs: 1. Secure product from a supplier. 2. Find a dealer (white dots on your mini-map represent dealers). 3. Initiate a conversation. 4. As with other interactions of this type, use the Intimidation meter to cut yourself the best deal possible (or no deal at all if you fail). That’s about it. If you fail an intimidation check with a dealer badly, you may end up having to whack him, but you can avoid this by not trying to go whole hog on each attempt.\n\nDealers can also be good if you have a lot of patience because they’ll pay more per gram for coke than your fronts will. Still, it’s a lot easier to dump 1,000 grams at a front rather than to sell it in 100 gram lots to dealers.\n\n3. Once you’re en route, rival gangs are itching to take you out.\n\n4. If you’re coming from the islands, you have to deal with more than just errant cops and gang members: you need to cope with pirates and the Coast Guard!\n\n5. All successful smuggling runs end with you arriving at your storehouse in one piece.\n\nSmuggling: Getting the Junk from Point A to Point $$$ Once you start to access large suppliers, you’ll find that there’s more than just meeting with a supplier and making off with the goods. You can’t just do the deal and unload it on the local dealers or at your various fronts because the amounts are too big. Now that you’re dealing in keys, using dealers is far more tedious and time-consuming than it’s worth. Basically, smuggling is another link in the chain, making things more complex and dangerous, but far more lucrative as well.\n\n6. If you fail, you lose all the drugs you obtained and, likely, have perished in a rather impressive ball of fire.\n\nHere are some important things to bear in mind: • The more gang heat you have, the more difficult getting your drugs home will be. • The more cop heat you have, the more difficult getting your drugs home will be.\n\nPRIMA Official Game Guide\n\n28 Protected by copyright. Unauthorized or unlawful copying or downloading expressly prohibited.\n\nBa s i c s — Wa l k t h ro u g h — Ap p e n d i c i e s\n\nDis Is How De Game Is Played, Meng\n\nWhen avoidance is not an option, you can attempt to out-run them. Your other option is sending them to Davy Jones’s locker with on-board guns.\n\nPut out the fire: Keep your heat low! You want your gang heat low. If you’ve been keeping on top of it all along (and you should be) this will be of little concern. If you haven’t, you’re playing with fire (for more info, please see the “Heat” section).\n\nAvoidance is the best prescription for survival, even if it means taking a circuitous route back to Miami. Remember that you can break the barrier heading north pretty much anywhere and then work your way to a storehouse from there, so don’t be picky.\n\nIn addition to gangs and pirates, you need to deal with the law. They’re just as unforgiving as your cutthroat “friends,” unfortunately. If you get ambushed (especially in the water) make for the nearest storehouse: it may not be the best one, but at least you’ll have something to show for it other than twisted metal and smoking flesh.\n\nDistribution\n\nSports cars are not good for smuggling!\n\nYour goal is to get back to a storehouse (any one will work, although you want to top off more lucrative areas first). Your goal is not to engage every troublemaker who crosses your path! They will be very aggressive in attempting to snuff you out, so pick a vehicle with solid armor, speed, and handling. Going overboard on any one attribute reduces your chances of surviving.\n\nSun and Surf: Island Smuggling\n\nMoney, money, money, moooooney! Dealers? Small peanuts. Selling directly to fronts? Sure, if you’re nothing but some petty small-timer thug. But distribution? That’s where the real money is. You won’t get far in this game if you don’t master the distribution aspect, because this is where the really big money is found. Sure, you could sell to dealers until you’re blue in the face, but it would take dozens upon dozens (at least) of standard deals to equal a solid distribution job.\n\nYou cannot undertake distribution runs until you have conquered at least one storehouse (except for the one tied to the mission) and have unlocked at least one large supplier.\n\nPirates ahoy! It may sound odd but, in many cases, smuggling out of the islands may actually be easier than dealing with the always harried streets of Miami. For one thing, you can usually see the pirates a long way off. Then do what you should always do when faced with pirates and large amounts of contraband: avoid them!\n\n29\n\nprimagames.com\n\nProtected by copyright.
