        "text": "Scarface: The World Is Yours is an action-adventure game developed by Radical Entertainment and published by Vivendi Games. It was released for various platforms, including the PlayStation 2, in 2006.\n\nIn Scarface: The World Is Yours, players assume the role of Tony Montana, the iconic character from the 1983 film \"Scarface.\" The game serves as a sequel to the movie, presenting an alternate ending where Tony survives the mansion shootout.\n\nThe gameplay of Scarface: The World Is Yours combines open-world exploration, combat, and resource management. Players navigate the city of Miami, rebuilding Tony's criminal empire and seeking revenge on those who betrayed him.\n\nAs Tony Montana, players engage in various activities to regain control over the drug trade and expand their empire. This includes buying and selling drugs, laundering money, engaging in illegal activities, and confronting rival gangs. The game features a reputation system that reflects Tony's standing in the criminal underworld, influencing interactions and alliances with other characters.\n\nThe combat in Scarface: The World Is Yours is intense and action-packed. Players can use a variety of firearms and melee weapons to engage in gunfights and close-quarters combat. The game incorporates a \"Blind Rage\" mechanic, where Tony can enter a furious state, enhancing his combat abilities.\n\nAnother notable aspect of Scarface: The World Is Yours is the \"Balls Meter.\" As players perform successful actions, such as defeating enemies or making deals, Tony's \"Balls Meter\" fills up, allowing him to execute powerful special attacks or regain health.\n\nThe PlayStation 2 version of Scarface: The World Is Yours received generally positive reviews, commending its open-world gameplay, voice acting (featuring Al Pacino reprising his role as Tony Montana), and the faithful recreation of the Scarface universe. However, some critics found the game's controls and repetitive mission structure to be less polished compared to other open-world titles of the time.\n\nOverall, Scarface: The World Is Yours for PlayStation 2 offers fans of the film an opportunity to step into Tony Montana's shoes and rebuild his empire in an open-world setting, blending action, strategy, and the criminal underworld of Miami."
