Highly acclaimed screenwriter, David McKenna, has written an original event-driven storyline for the interactive game that leads the player through a sordid underworld. The Scarface video game creates a gameplay environment that authentically recreates the historical time period of the film, touching on politics, news items and events of the day. Players travel through the steamy, often violent streets of Miami, the irie islands of the Florida Keys, the Bahamas and various other locales and interact with a world full of seedy and dangerous characters to procure information, negotiate business deals, smuggle contraband and avoid rivals and DEA on a mission to rebuild their fallen empire.
