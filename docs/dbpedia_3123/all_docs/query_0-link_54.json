        "text": "\"The treacherous world of Scarface is a natural property to translate into a cinematic gameplay experience. The game will feature cutting-edge technology, a compelling storyline and the unprecedented experience of playing as one of Hollywood's most notorious gangsters.\"\n\nI did work a lot on this thing. It was a pain in the ass! I didn't know what I was getting myself into. I didn't know anything about ancillary scenes, about how the character can go in different directions, he has to have a line of dialogue for every single character he encounters. I'm not a video game guy, I don't play video games [...] I put a lot of time into this but I only put, you know, several months. Radical put in several years, these guys were working on this thing forever. I gave them the best blueprint I could. I helped them as much as I could with dialogue, and ancillary scenes, I helped guide them as much as I could but in the end it's their baby. It was their world; I was just living in it for a little while.[25]\n\n\"Scarface is, first and foremost, about delivering the experience of being Tony Montana. It's about revenge, excess, indulgence, and having the balls to take what you want; all of these features come together as well as they do because they resonate with the core of Scarface: The World is Yours, namely: 'What Would Tony Montana Do?' At every stage of development, we've asked ourselves this question to ensure that our design and artistic decisions come from the right place. Tony is an unpredictable, comical, and likeable guy and this shines through in everything that he does. He also has a strong moral code. He doesn't think twice about taking down people who are in his way or trying to put him down, but he won't kill innocents (e.g. pedestrians, women, and children). He's a likeable, charismatic, and fun-to-play character and that makes Scarface a unique experience in open-world games.\"\n\nIn late March 2006, Vivendi gave pre-alpha builds of the PlayStation 2 version of the game to both IGN and GameSpot. They explained that since E3 2005, Radical had given the entire game an overhaul, improving the design and creating a more compelling storyline.[6] They had also tweaked the gameplay to appeal to both casual gamers and more hardcore gamers. These changes had been implemented after some negative feedback from both the public and the gaming press following the E3 demo. Writers had been especially critical of the look of the game, and one of Radical's alterations was to repaint every external texture.[37] Jason Bone stated the negative feedback was a good thing, as Radical had underestimated the difficulty of making a large open world game; \"We do have a bit of experience with open world games, but they were on a much smaller scale - there wasn't a lot of detail in them. With this game, we needed it to feel cinematic and yet be an open-world game.\" The negative feedback made them realize the game needed more work. Bone also stated work had not begun on the Xbox 360 version, as they didn't want it to be a direct port, nor did they want it to distract them from the PS2, PC and Xbox versions. He also suggested that a PlayStation 3 version was under consideration.[23]\n\nIn August, a Collector's Edition of the game for the PlayStation 2 was announced, which would include the game, a bonus DVD including a \"Making of\" documentary, a video walkthrough with producer commentary, cast interviews, hints and tips, a full map of the game world and concept art.[41][42]\n\n\"Bringing Scarface: The World Is Yours to Wii is an exciting opportunity to take an already amazing game and add an incredible twist, thanks to the Wii console's unique remote controller abilities. Adding motion-sensitive elements to a game that already includes an incredible celebrity cast, Hollywood production values and non-stop action, delivers a gaming experience unlike any other, truly bringing the world of Tony Montana to vivid life.\"\n\nIGN's Chris Roper was extremely impressed, scoring the PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions 8.7 out of 10, and giving the game an \"Editor's Choice\" award.[7][63][65] The Xbox version was also awarded the October \"Xbox Game of the Month\" award.[71] Roper dismissed notions that the game was simply a Grand Theft Auto clone, arguing instead that it advanced the genre; \"much of Scarface is based on what we've seen in Grand Theft Auto. It's fairly obvious that Radical used said series as the blueprint and then went back and re-evaluated its shortcomings. The result is that we have a game that fixes many of GTA's problematic elements.\" He praised the basic gameplay, the storyline, the ball meter, the rage mode, and the aiming system. Although he was somewhat critical of the map, arguing too many areas in the game are accessible via only one road, he concluded \"There are a whole lot of little things about Scarface that make it fun, but it's the sum of its parts that make it the overall great game that it is. It does a whole lot to fix many of the problems with other games in the genre, and it does a fantastic job of bringing the world of Scarface to gamers.\"[7] Mark Bozon and Chris Roper scored the Wii version 8.5 out of 10, also giving it an \"Editor's Choice\" award, and writing \"Scarface is a very impressive game, and while there isn't a ton of Wii-specific additions to the package, everything that was added makes a big difference.\" Praising the controls, they wrote \"it's amazingly easy to target enemies and blow off specific body parts in the process.\" They called it \"an intelligent, high-budget, astonishingly impressive game\", arguing \"Wii owners that fit in the hardcore crowd will eat this one up, as it's currently one of the deepest and most entertaining experiences on the system.\"[64]\n\nGame Informer's Matt Helgeson scored the PlayStation 2 version 8.5 out of 10, calling it \"a very playable and addictive open-world game that manages to put its fresh spin on the familiar genre.\" He was critical of the side missions, calling them \"very repetitive\", but he concluded \"Overall, I had a great time with Scarface. It's every bit as profane, violent, and over-the-top as the movie, and delivers not only the gunplay you're expecting but as much depth as almost any other game in the genre.\"[19]\n\nGameSpy's Justin Speer scored the PlayStation 2 version 4 out of 5, calling it \"a ridiculously violent, unbelievably profane game that lets you glorify yourself with virtual millions of dollars in hard-earned drug money, fast cars, boats, underlings, women and copious amounts of blood. It's a good feeling.\" However, he noted that \"gamers who are getting used to the next-generation of console visuals aren't going to be impressed with either the PS2 or the Xbox version.\" He also argued the game becomes somewhat repetitive towards the end. However, he concluded \"Scarface is a long-lasting experience that's simply a lot of fun. Part guilty pleasure, a part blazingly successful experiment in game design, Scarface: The World is Yours is worth a shot.\"[16]\n\nNow, I feel the need to point out that I hadn't unlocked the limo yet, so you could potentially save yourself a couple of minutes by just asking it to take you someplace different and then back to the quest giver. If you try this, please tell me if it works.\n\nIn my opinion it does a lot of things better than GTA, specially Vice City (which I'm a huge fan of), as GTAVC is basically a pre-World is Yours Scarface game. Not a completely fair comparison, I know, as VC came out earlier. But I think it fares very well even compared to San Andreas (which also came earlier, but is a much more fair comparison). GTA games do side activities and an \"alive world\" better, but regarding the whole CRIMINAL BOSS fantasy it's not even close.\n\nThe M79 grenade launcher appears in this game as the \"M-79\" and is the first explosive weapon that the player unlocks as they progress through the game. Tony's enforcer carries an M79 as his weapon of choice, along with a Remington 870. Oddly, this weapon is capable of firing 3 shots at a time (a la China Lake Launcher), whereas in the real world it's capable of only one due to being a single-shot breechloader. Nonetheless, the reload time for the M79 in-game is pretty much the same as its rate of fire.\n\nIn the end, this gave them much more creative leeway while keeping many of the elements fans of Scarface loved most, mainly the in-your-face antics of Tony Montana as portrayed by Al Pacino. Pacino would not return to reprise his role as Tony for The World Is Yours, but he would lend his likeness and pick the actor who eventually did voice Tony in the game. In the end, players were able to wear the thousand-dollar loafers of their favorite cartel kingpin in a Grand Theft Auto-style open world.\n\nIt's undeniable that Tony Montana makes up much of what fans love about Scarface, and that's why Radical opted to inject as much of Tony's raw attitude into the game as possible. Apart from repeating Tony's rise to power and glory as depicted in the film, players are able to make Tony interact with the world in many ways that show off the Scarface character's personality. Obviously, this includes murdering people and dealing hard drugs, but it also includes more subtle things like the dialogue Tony can initiate with any NPC in the game. It just wouldn't be Scarface if fans couldn't tell anyone and everyone \"f*ck you\" in his iconic voice.\n\nb2a8ae9291"
