        "text": "I recently watched Brian De Palma’s incredibly gratuitous Scarface (1983) for a second time, and found that I loved it infinitely more now than I did then. The first time I saw it, the revelling in violence and drugs felt dissonant with my expectations of the movie; I had somehow convinced myself I was getting into something violent, but more self-serious (think of Scorsese’s Casino).\n\nBut this time, armed with a more realistic picture of what I was about to see, a new-found love of synths and 80s Florida attire, and the deep desire to see Al Pacino go crazy for around three hours, I definitely liked what I saw. Ironically, I even found more depth this time around, on a viewing when I was expecting less depth. For example, the cinematography, which I had initially thought was in the style of a generic action movie, was striking.\n\nI was also wielding a recently-found familiarity of Macbeth when I watched Scarface for the second time. After (surprise!) studying the play in school, I’ve been rubbing the themes and motifs of it, along with my (probably) basic, conventional ideas about Shakespearian storytelling against most anything that I can, hoping to see some similarities. To my delight, I noticed that Scarface shares all sorts of things with Shakespeare and his play Macbeth. It’s clear that Scarface writer Oliver Stone took, either consciously or unconsciously, inspiration from Shakespeare’s stories. Allow me to explain.\n\nThe first, possibly least obvious comparison, is that both are deeply steeped in sex and violence. The most irksome thing that a “Shakespeare Elitist” can do in my eyes is renounce the pulpy nature of the dude’s plays. I mean, look at them. Do you know how many people die in Macbeth? Loads. Fratricide, Infanticide and all sorts of debauchery are common occurrences in most Shakespeare plays, not to mention all that witchcraft. I find it funny to think that the western world’s most appreciated author wrote what are essentially gratuitous romps, but it kind of speaks to the nature of Shakespeare’s plays, and subsequently that of Scarface.\n\n(from Roman Polanksi’s Macbeth)\n\nAlthough Shakespeare created some incredibly nuanced characters, he didn’t like to screw around with subtlety. He was all about creating the biggest, most expansive tales of human nature, even in more intimate settings. Stone is clearly following along those lines in his script for Scarface. Despite strengthening the theme of the blood-soaked Miami criminal underworld, all of the bombastic violence ensures the film is operating on nothing less than the most epic proportions. The ridiculous final gunfight, in particular, mirrors a typical Shakespearian tragedy’s final scene, in which all of the characters still left alive seem to be rounded up and taken care of.\n\nOn other levels, comparisons to Macbeth become more pronounced. I’m not going to try and argue that Tony Montana is in any way as complex as Macbeth’s main guy, but I do think that the former is kind of a subversion of the latter. There’s a lot of similarities; both Macbeth and Montana are ambitious killers who usurp their superiors to gain a position of power, only to have paranoia and their ambitious natures provide their bloody downfalls. However, Montana is much more straightforward; he has none of the reservation nor the mental complexities of Shakespeare’s character. The film basically tells us that Tony is infatuated with his sister, which feels very Shakespearian (the man loved some ambiguous incest), but there’s not a huge amount of depth to him. This makes Tony Montana a sort of Macbeth-for-the-modern-day; the gist of the character remains, with all of his subtleties stripped out. He’s a classic figure made appropriate for a drug-fueled, fast-moving world. This isn’t at all a bad thing; Stone makes Montana feel much more like a product of his time, and so fits in well in the world of the movie.\n\nYou might even say that Stone was using these parallels with Macbeth to make a point about the world Montana exists within. While Macbeth’s downfall was triggered by his lack of morals, Montana’s is by submitting to those morals for a brief moment; he prevents the assassination of a family, which prompts his counterparts to send a Bolivian hit squad to finally finish him off. Stone shows Montana as a victim of the world he himself helped to create, one in which morality is always a weakness, and success is determined purely by who can sell the most of their soul.\n\nMost explicit, though, are the thematic links between the two. Scarface adapts a common Shakespearian theme to the modern world; namely, that of ambition, and the inevitability that people will succumb to it. In Macbeth, the titular character is told by witches that he will become king, and when the opportunity to assassinate the current ruler, King Duncan, comes along, Macbeth deliberates. The audience, however, knows immediately that Macbeth will kill the king, and madness will ensue. There is a similar moment within Scarface; Tony Montana has his first meeting with Frank Lopez, the crime boss who is very much King Duncan to Tony’s Macbeth. Lopez tells him that the ones who last in the business are the ones who fly straight, and that the ones who want it all never last; from that moment we know that Tony isn’t going to be doing much flying straight. And, sure enough, he eventually kills Lopez and claims his empire.\n\nBut both Shakespeare and Stone allow their works to be governed by a kind of neutral morality; everything has to return to equilibrium, and as a result we know that the success of Macbeth and Montana will never last. Both writers are infatuated with the downfall of their characters, and some of the most excessive glorification in both works comes from that of the tragedy of the protagonists. In both Scarface and Macbeth, success and happiness are inversely proportional; when Montana and Macbeth are at the height of their powers, they’re at the lowest of their spirits.\n\nAs a result, both works depict the “fall” part of the “rise and fall” with detail and enthusiasm. While Shakespeare indulges in lengthy soliloquies as Macbeth explores the extent of his guilt, Scarface director De Palma revels in shots of Tony staring miserably into the middle distance or lying comatose in a literal pile of cocaine. For both, the end is bloody and a long time coming; Stone and Shakespeare both let their characters go down fighting as a sort of final and brutal redemption, a penance for their crimes. In Macbeth, the fall of the titular character is punctuated by a jubilant speech from his successor outside Macbeth’s castle, in Scarface, Montana’s by the mournful wail of a synth as gunmen pick their way across the rubble of his mansion, the titan himself lying dead in a blood-red pool of water. It’s ridiculous, tragic, and above all, glorious."
