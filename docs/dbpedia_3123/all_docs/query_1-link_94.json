Power. Respect., a unique game designed specifically for the PSP system that combines turn-based strategy gameplay with real-time combat. Licensed by Universal Studios Consumer Products Group and developed by FarSight Studios, Scarface: Money. Power. Respect. will allow gamers to relive Tony Montana’s epic rise to power in the drug-fueled world of 1983 Miami and is expected to be available at retail stores in October 2006.\n\nSierra Entertainment will also release Scarface: The World Is Yours, an open-world action game, in Fall 2006. Scarface: The World Is Yours is being developed by Radical Entertainment for the PlayStation 2, the Xbox and Windows PC.\n\nInspired by the epic film’s original storyline, Scarface: Money. Power. Respect. will thrust gamers into a deep and engaging strategy game as Tony Montana, where the goal is to battle and defeat competing drug cartels and conquer Miami turf-by-turf, eventually becoming the one-and-only Kingpin of the city.\n\n“Scarface: Money. Power. Respect. will challenge players to strategically direct Tony Montana’s legendary and meteoric ascent to the biggest drug kingpin in Miami,” said Cindy Cook, Chief Strategy and Marketing Officer for Vivendi Games. “Using the PSP platform’s advanced functionality and multiplayer capabilities, Scarface: Money. Power. Respect. will deliver a unique and challenging strategy experience combined with real-time combat that is fully immersed in the authentic world of the film.”\n\nFeaturing both single- and multi-player modes, Scarface: Money. Power. Respect. will challenge players to make critical strategic decisions to rise from humble beginnings to directing an army of henchmen and hired gunmen through detailed scenarios of conquest and domination.\n\nIn the story-based single-player mode, gamers will complete a series of missions based on scenes from the original movie to conquer “turfs” in Miami. Players will need to direct large-scale citywide strategic commands to complete their conquest as well as direct street-level real-time combat. The game will challenge gamers to handle larger territory, additional adversaries and\n\nThe wireless multi-player mode pits up-to-four gamers playing as criminal cartels in a race to make money and conquer turf. The multi-player battle begins with a “Land Grab,” where each cartel lays claim to their share of Miami. Through turn-based strategy showdowns and real-time combat, each player will manage the production and distribution of drugs while building up enough cartel strength to overpower adversaries, take their turf and eventually, rule the Miami drug scene.\n\nScarface: Money. Power. Respect. is scheduled to ship in October 2006 for a suggested retail price of $39.99, with an expected ESRB “Mature” rating."
