        "text": "Review: The JAWS Log (30th Anniversary Edition)\n\nThe JAWS Log (30th Anniversary Edition)\n\nAuthor: Carl Gottlieb\n\nPublisher: Dey Street Books\n\nRelease date: 3rd June 2010\n\nRecipient of three Academy Awards and reigning as the highest-grossing film of its era, \"Jaws\" captivated audiences worldwide, solidifying its status as a cinematic phenomenon. Within these pages lies the exclusive account detailing how a twenty-six-year-old Steven Spielberg masterfully adapted Peter Benchley's acclaimed novel into the timeless masterpiece it became.\n\nHandpicked by Spielberg to collaborate as a screenwriter during production, Carl Gottlieb, esteemed actor and writer, remained immersed in the filmmaking process alongside luminaries such as Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss. Following the completion of filming, Gottlieb, with Spielberg's blessing, meticulously documented their remarkable yearlong journey in \"The Jaws Log,\" initially published in 1975 and amassing over two million copies in sales. This expanded edition boasts a captivating photo section, featuring an introduction penned by Benchley himself, and an illuminating afterword by Gottlieb, offering insights into the individuals and events that shaped the film, thus presenting an unparalleled glimpse into the creation of an iconic movie and the artistry that propelled its creation.\n\nGottlieb's book, enriched by an introduction penned by Peter Benchley and complemented by approximately thirty production stills, adopts a journal-like narrative style. Through Gottlieb's lens, readers are immersed in the tumultuous world of the film's creation, with each crisis unfolding in real-time and the desperate scramble for solutions. As a key collaborator with Spielberg on the screenplay and a participant in the film as the character Meadows, Gottlieb offers firsthand accounts of the challenges faced by the cast and crew. From logistical hurdles to creative impasses, the book meticulously documents every major obstacle encountered, with Gottlieb providing astute analysis at every turn.\n\nI came across Carl Gottlieb's book years ago, finally diving into it after summoning the courage to watch the film. Admittedly, I was a bit hesitant initially, having been spooked by the trailers. Yet, upon reading, I found it both enlightening and entertaining. When I stumbled upon it on sale recently, I opted for a digital copy, unsure of the whereabouts of my original paperback.\n\nDrawing from his meticulous notes, interviews, and the ever-reliable Internet Movie Database, Gottlieb unravels the behind-the-scenes saga of Peter Benchley's journey to bestsellerdom, Universal's acquisition of the rights, and the birth of \"Jaws\" the movie.\n\nAs the studio geared up for production, they faced a daunting challenge: crafting a film of this nature had never been attempted. Spielberg, a mere twenty-six at the start of filming, aged exponentially by its conclusion. Despite Hollywood's confidence, the endeavor proved far more arduous than anticipated.\n\nUpon arriving at Martha’s Vineyard, one could almost hear the ominous four-note shark theme echoing in the background. Murphy's Law seemed to dictate proceedings, with setbacks aplenty testing the resilience of the cast and crew. From relentless rewrites to irate locals and the cumbersome \"Bruce\" (three sharks and a twelve-ton rig requiring a small army to operate), challenges were plentiful.\n\nThough plagued by technical glitches and occasional visible \"strings,\" when \"Bruce\" performed, Spielberg captured moments that sent hearts racing—eliciting reactions from Gottlieb, the editing team, special effects crew, and ultimately, audiences.\n\nOriginally penned shortly after the film's completion, with subsequent reissues marking its twenty-fifth and thirtieth anniversaries, Gottlieb's account offers not only a gripping narrative but also a revealing glimpse into the inner workings of Hollywood. Infused with Gottlieb's dry wit and keen observations, it provides an authentic portrayal of the blood, sweat, and tears—alongside a fair share of colorful language—that went into birthing the cinematic sensation known as \"Jaws.\"\n\nSteven Soderbergh, Bryan Singer, Rod Lurie, John Landis, Steve Martin, and Rob Reiner are among the many filmmakers who concur, more than 30 years after its first publication, that The Jaws Log by screenwriter Carl Gottlieb deserves an enduring place as a \"modern classic\" on filmmakers and filmmaking.\n\nThis book offers a captivating glimpse into the intricate workings of a major motion picture, particularly one that has etched itself into the annals of Hollywood history. However, a couple of caveats warrant mention. Firstly, while much of the information presented here can also be found in the extensive extras featured on various DVD reissues of the film, what sets this account apart is its direct narration by someone who was intimately involved in the production—a perspective unfiltered by studio executives or producers. Secondly, over the years, the book has undergone expansions, resulting in footnotes that practically rival the length of the main text. As such, readers should brace themselves for frequent flipping back and forth between the main narrative and the appendices. Despite these considerations, I wholeheartedly recommend this book as an engrossing read. It provides a firsthand, insider's view of the film's creation, offering invaluable insights into the production process from someone who was not just there but deeply embedded in its core.\n\nPraise for ‘The Jaws Log’"
