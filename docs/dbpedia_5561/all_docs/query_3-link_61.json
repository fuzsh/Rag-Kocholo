        "text": "As artists find it hard to make the case for their existence, The Willy Wonka experience is a gift waiting to be unwrapped and offered with a flourish - Can you see now! What we do is a SKILL and a CRAFT. When people ask “what do you do again ?” directors, writers, set designers, musicians, actors can now answer “We make Wonka experiences but really well.” Just look at the global shock when something like this is done badly. I’m currently watching an hour long documentary about how bad that event was. Imagine if there were regular hour-long documentaries about how great theatre, immersive experiences, writing, live performances can be? Look at how upset people get when they are not moved by an artistic experience? Honestly we should never take for granted how hard it is to make good work and we should be better at arguing for it. Click bait yes, but this doc ended up being a FASCINATING look at what happens when the creative process is under estimated.\n\nIn Chapter 7 of my book, The Evolution of Hollywood’s Calculated Blockbuster Films: Blockbusted (Lexington Books, an imprint of Rowman & Littlefield), I discuss how Carl Gottlieb came on board at the behest of Steven Spielberg to fix the screenplay for Jaws, after Peter Benchley had penned the initial draft. Gottlieb was given a note by Spielberg with the simple instruction, “Eviscerate it!”: Gottlieb’s hiring made little sense. In late-stage script development, it is the norm to hire a highly experienced writer, with significant credits in the genre to lend his/her name to the value of the package (i.e., the name alone suggesting quality to potential audiences, as well as acting as a draw) (Jones, 1996, p. 75). This also addresses any concerns by the studio’s executives about reducing risk, by hiring a known entity with a synergistic record. Gottlieb was likely hired for the following reasons: 1) his personal, trust-based relationship with Spielberg; 2) his background in television writing, meaning he was capable to deliver script lines rapidly; 3) as a neophyte writer, he was less expensive to hire and willing to spend months on location; 4) his role in the project as a ‘right hand’ creative member to Spielberg, helping him address other issues such as casting; 5) Gottlieb, given his newfound role, could be controlled by the director. The two ended up working on the script most evenings and on weekends during actual production. Gottlieb transformed a script that was “formulaic, hewed too closely to the novel, and had cardboard cut-out characters (Heroic Ichthyologist, Bored and Lonely Housewife, Fanatically Obsessive Shark Hunter).” He said that his “job was to prune the undergrowth, concentrate on the Fish Story, and make all the characters sound more like human beings; if there were a few laughs along the way, so much the better.” Note in the photo that Gottlieb (right) appeared briefly in the film.\n\nCe que la pratique des actrices/acteurs nous dit sur la mémoire (ça me sidère à chaque fois de voir comment on peut s'approprier un texte de la sorte). «Similarly, when psychologists Helga and Tony Noice surveyed actors on how they learn their lines, they found that actors search for meaning in the script, rather than memorizing lines. The actors imagine the character in each scene, adopt the character’s perspective, relate new material to the character’s background, and try to match the character’s mood. Script lines are carefully analyzed to understand the character’s motivation. This deep understanding of a script is achieved by actors asking goal-directed questions, such as “Am I angry with her when I say this?”. Later, during a performance, this deep understanding provides the context for the lines to be recalled naturally, rather than recited from a memorized text. In his book “Acting in Film,” actor Michael Caine described this process well: «You must be able to stand there not thinking of that line. You take it off the other actor’s face. Otherwise, for your next line, you’re not listening and not free to respond naturally, to act spontaneously.» https://lnkd.in/e3BMDkm5\n\nNew teaser for \"Anarchy to the World of... the Kitchen Pimps\". A documentary feature film that concludes the barbaric trilogy of films that showcase a realistic portrayal of university life - the good and the bad - as well as visualising a rising charismatic dynamic between the same university students throughout the entire trilogy. Those mentioned students are in fact my friends and I, as during our first year at uni, one surreal joke miraculously aggravated our group dynamic. Each film corresponds with one of the three academic years we endured. Our first year was the topic of the first film - \"Welcome to the World of... the Kitchen Pimps\" (2022) - with the second film - \"Return to the World of... the Kitchen Pimps\" (2023) - showcased us in our second year. This new teaser previews what's to come in the final film, where we endured our final chaotic year at uni whilst in preparation for taking the leap into the real world. Despite the amateur visuals and absurd titles, I ascertained that every film would showcase their respected narratives coherently. Though I am excited to work on more professional projects in the future, producing these films has been a satisfying practice to further understand how to present a constructive flow for the narrative; beneficial for anyone to understand and easily follow. Past two films in this trilogy shown here: https://lnkd.in/gCEJkgBs\n\nStressing about originality in your screenplay can be counterproductive. It's a common misconception that every idea must be entirely new and groundbreaking. In reality, many successful films draw from timeless themes and archetypal stories that have been told and retold throughout history. Take the classic Romeo and Juliet trope, for instance. This tale of star-crossed lovers has been a foundational narrative in literature and film for centuries. While it might seem overused, numerous movies have put their unique spin on this age-old story, demonstrating that originality can be found even within well-worn themes. For example, \"West Side Story\" is a musical adaptation of Romeo and Juliet set in 1950s New York City, with rival gangs replacing the feuding families. This fresh context provides a unique perspective on the timeless love story. Another example is \"Warm Bodies,\" which combines the Romeo and Juliet concept with the zombie genre. The film explores the love between a human and a zombie, breathing new life into the age-old narrative. Additionally, \"Gnomeo & Juliet\" takes a whimsical approach by featuring garden gnomes as the star-crossed lovers. This animated adaptation showcases how a familiar story can be reinvented for a family audience. These examples illustrate that while the core themes of love, conflict, and tragedy may be consistent with the original Romeo and Juliet, the unique settings, characters, and twists allow each film to stand out as a fresh and compelling work of art. So, don't let concerns about originality stifle your creativity; instead, focus on infusing your own unique voice and perspective into classic narratives.\n\nHow Do We Write script for a movie 1 Write a logine ( a.k.a brief summary) you are likely to be a pretty jazzed about writing your script after watching all those cinematic classics 2. Write a treatment ( a.k.a longer summary) once your logline's in the bag . It's time to write your treatment 3. Develop your characters 4. Write your plot How do you bring a script to life By forcing your story to take place in a restricted number of locations, you also get your audience to consider how those limitations affect what they might see. You will likely find new and exciting ways to communicate interesting story beats and might come up with fresh ways to address potential conflicts How to cast a movie 1. Review the script 2. contact relevant agencies to find actors 3, Determine what type of audition to request 4. Prepare for auditions 5. Host and review auditions 6. Send callbacks 7. Conduct a screen test 8. Make final actor selection What are the deliverables for a movie Deliverables must fit the exact requirements of distributors. This applies to the films. The trailer, TV spots, photography and legal documents. Without these you will be unable to show your Film to a wider audience. These need to be given to the distributor within a set timeframe\n\nLucy (the movie) – Nine years after the movie's release, a review The movie industry is another economic branch fully developed in some countries. It is a star nursery for actors, movie directors and screenwriters. Maybe 1% of the universal production of films is of quality. A good movie is sometimes not enough. Some people want and can do extraordinary motion pictures. There is the art of telling the story and letting the watchers the feeling of something that they can reach or discover. There are sometimes \"aha\" moments. It appears that the movie Lucy's message is not understood (from my point of view). Luc Paul Maurice Besson's \"Lucy\" relies on the \"10% of the brain\" myth, a drug story, pursuits and visual effects in the American style, to offer us philosophy in pill form. It looks like the title comes from AL 333, the first Australopithecus afarensis found. All the criticism I read about revolves around the cast and his Hollywood style. Others see conspiracy theories hidden in names, actions or statements. An open critique becomes the \"10% of the brain\" myth. The drug story and the special effects downplayed the critique of our society and our lifestyle. What I've been missing in the last decades is the constructive criticism. \"Dubito ergo cogito, cogito ergo sum\" [R. Descartes].

Immersion: When your audience is completely absorbed, lost in the narrative, and not thinking about how it's pieced together, you’ve achieved the coveted “good cut”. Any moment that takes a viewer out of that experience hints towards a “bad cut”, one that needs a revisit. The Emotional Power of a Good Cut: A “good cut” elicits emotion and keeps the story flowing. Whether it's the dramatic juxtaposition of a “before” and “after” scene or syncing visual beats to the pulse of a musical score for a lively response – it's all about making the audience *feel* something and staying hooked to the story. Remember, editing is much more than piecing clips together; it’s sculpting a narrative journey. Always be conscious of the emotional flow of your story and make cuts that enhance, rather than detract from, the viewing experience. www.ezicfilmworks.com\n\nWhat Are The Best Historical Movies of All Time? https://ift.tt/KpkH43f There's nothing like seeing a giant epic on the big screen. There's something about feeling the weight of the events in a crowded theater that just sings to me. That's why I always seek out the best historical movies, they just move me. And in a world where intellectual property rule Hollywood, the historical genre is more valuable than ever for writers and directors. Today, I want to go over this genre. We'll look at the definition, the tropes, and unpack the best historical films of all time. Let's dive in. Defining the Historical Film A historical film is a broad genre, generally defined as any movie dramatizing events or people from a past era. These films blend fact with varying levels of creative license. While aiming for some degree of historical accuracy, filmmakers also strive for drama, emotional resonance, and compelling storytelling. History of Historical Films Historical films have existed since the dawn of cinema because humans have always used art to express their feelings on the past. Early examples, like the silent film The Birth of a Nation (1915), were often rife with inaccuracies and biases. And lots of other bad things. Yet, they still captivated audiences with their epic scope and explorations of the past. As filmmaking techniques evolved, so did the sophistication of historical films. The Birth of a Genre (Early Cinema to 1920s) Primitive Beginnings: The earliest historical films were short and simple, often depicting key events like battles or coronations with limited sets and theatrical acting styles. Italian Epics: Italy spearheaded the trend of feature-length historical spectacles. Movies like Quo Vadis? (1912) and Cabiria (1914) wowed audiences with lavish sets, thousands of extras, and tales of the ancient world. D.W. Griffith's Controversies: American director D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation (1915) was a technical landmark but also notorious for its glorification of the Ku Klux Klan and racist distortions of history. The Golden Age of Hollywood (1930s to 1950s) Studio-Era Spectacle: With the advent of sound, studios churned out historical adventures, romances, and biopics filled with swashbuckling heroes and romanticized pasts. Prestige and Propaganda: Historical films gained greater respectability while also being used for nationalistic purposes, especially during World War II. The Rise of the Epic: Postwar years saw monumental films like Ben-Hur (1959) and Cleopatra (1963), notable for their scale and ambition, even if sometimes at the expense of historical accuracy. New Waves and Revisionism (1960s to 1990s) Challenging Tradition: Filmmakers began exploring history with more cynicism and nuance, reflecting changing social attitudes. Films like Bonnie and Clyde (1967) de-glamorized historical outlaws. The European Influence: European cinema contributed a greater sense of realism and his...\n\nWhen it comes to ideas, - you never 'no'. There are many, many iconic artists and creators who were critiqued when they first shared their work but now revered years and years later. Whether it's Van Gogh's paintings, or Stanley Kubrick's film 2001 A Space Odyssey, that received negative reviews when released in 1968. In fact, a top movie critic questioned Kubrick's 'thinking' about the film: \"[I]t does rather look as if Kubrick and his co-writer, Arthur C. Clarke, just haven't thought it through.\" It's easy to first poke holes in someone's ideas instead of letting them simmer over time giving them the opportunity to resonate and gain full appreciation. It works both ways, too-- that is, when you have a creative idea that you doubt will be appreciated. Ideas are the origins of the creative process and the creator's starting point. The best way to test them is for you to publish and share your work. And if you're okay with it, then good. In time your audience, which when you first share them will be you. will connect. And it might be better received then you think. I'll leave you with a quote about ideas from Rick Rubin in his thought inspiring book: 'The Creative Act' (p. 159): \"Once the idea is witnessed in its full expression, it may turn out far better than you imagined. It may even be a perfect fit. Or it could be exactly what you expected. Something will be gained through the process, whatever the result. Give yourself permission to be wrong and experience the joy of being surprised.\" Because when you create and share your ideas - you never 'no'. #ideas #creativeprocess #art \""
