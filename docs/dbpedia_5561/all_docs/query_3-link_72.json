        "text": "Do you know that in one year I got the Academy Award, the Drama Critics Award, the Hasty Pudding Award, the Golden Globe, the David di Donatello [Italian award for Best Foreign Actor]. That’s five, right? Until that year I had never won anything ever. I was the best actor at Beverly High. Everyone knew that. I never won. Greg Findley [now doing commercials] won Best Actor. I was a funny guy, but Albert Brooks was funnier. In school, his name was Albert Einstein. I came in third for every award at Beverly High in 1965. Then, in one year . . . ooooooo, ahhhhhh. Thank you.\n\nDid you run into any of the other Best Actor nominees after you’d won the Oscar?\n\nNo. I ran into John Travolta before. He came back behind me and said good luck. I wished him good luck, too.\n\nDid you see ‘Saturday Night Fever’?\n\nNo. [Sue Di Puccio, Dreyfuss’ assistant, who was sitting in on the conversation, added, “Tell him about Jack Nicholson.”] I had just won the Oscar, right. I get in the elevator to go back downstairs. Jack Nicholson gets into the elevator. There’s me, a few other actors. Nicholson stands at the back, adjusting his shades, saying nothing. Then, just as the doors are about to open, he says to me, “Bet you’re glad I didn’t make a film this year.” I was.\n\nSo you took the role in ‘Jaws’ because you were depressed and afraid that it would be your only offer after the supposed debacle of ‘Kravitz.’\n\nYes. I went with the fish movie.\n\nHow do you look back on the experience?\n\nJaws was good work. Memories. [Imitates megaphone] The ship is sinking. The ship is sinking. The shark is working. The shark is working.\n\nIn Jaws, we all lived and wrote that movie together. We sat and improvised and Carl [Gottlieb] would go away and write a scene and he would come back and we would rewrite that whole scene using Carl’s as an outline. Every night for three months.\n\nSupposedly you walked into the ‘Jaws’ casting room at a hotel in Boston, and Steven Spielberg looked at you and said, “Perfect. Get three more of what you’re wearing from wardrobe.”\n\nWell it wasn’t quite that dramatic. I was cast in the film three days before shooting started. I had already turned it down three times. All I did was get a lot of books about sharks and marine biology. We talked about it for a day in Boston, I said okay and called my agent, Meyer [Mishkin], to say, “You can start negotiating.”\n\nI was once in a situation where I walked into a room and people said, “That’s Benjy,” and I turned it down fuckin’ cold. Soon as they said the word Beniy, I knew exactly what the character was. In television there was a certain classification known as the Dipshit Friend. I was always playing the Dipshit Friend. They had names like Lionel and Alfred. My brother says they’re the characters who wear a size-nine belt because they wear their pants up here [points to neck].\n\nEven after ‘Jaws’ had made $200 million, you were still living in Silverlake, California. Takeout food was everywhere. Week-old pizza, empty Courvoisier bottles, half-eaten hamburgers . . . shall I go on?\n\nI lived that way for fifteen years. Except for the cognac, that was only two years old. I’m a known slob.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nYou’re wearing suits now.\n\nLike this? I have no idea what I’m wearing. I just wanted to start dressing my age. I used clothing as a device to keep young. I looked like a slob: “It’s okay, you don’t have to respect me, I’m just a kid.” So I’d have to work double hard to get them to respect me. Now I just want my clothes to reflect whoever I am.\n\nYou are constantly plagued with dog analogies. People say you have a puppy dog way of gaining endearment. Even the ‘New Yorker,’ in Pauline Kael’s review of ‘The Big Fix,’ said Dreyfuss “acts like a puppy surprising his master with little tricks he’s thought of all by himself.” Does this bother you?\n\nI’d love to talk to you about this, but I have to go visit the fire hydrant. I feel a number one coming on."
