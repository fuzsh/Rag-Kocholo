        "text": "The camera is rolling. Richard Dreyfuss has done this scene 14 times already, and from take one through take 19 his reading has been virtually identical — same inflections, same rhythms, same curve of rising intensity. When I mention it, he's amused. “Of course the reading doesn't change,” he says. “That's the easiest thing for an actor to do. It's like telling a carpenter, ‘Gee, you drove that nail right into the hole.’ “\n\nAnother scene calls for Dreyfuss to walk into a bedroom looking for his wife. “I need an expression that says, ‘Where the hell is she?’ “ says Jeremy Paul Kagan, director of Dreyfuss's upcoming film, “The Big Fix.” “Use your body.” Alone in the room, Dreyfuss walks through five different versions of the move, his face distant and preoccupied. He tries several different walks; he tries a fast spin, a slow spin, a broken spin; he tries pauses of various duration. Finally he selects a combination of walks, pauses and spins for the camera — and now, for the take, his face is working again. Kagan calls fur a print, but Dreyfuss is not convinced. “I wouldn't mind doing that again,” he says.\n\nYet another shot finds five men backing carefully down a narrow hallway: the cameraman, the focus‐puller, the sound man, the sound‐cable holder and the director. They have their elbows in each others’ faces, they're trying not to trip, they're working hard to keep the camera focused and the microphone out of the shot — and following them down the hallway is Dreyfuss, in tight close‐up, his face calm, his eyes clear, ignoring this ridiculous spectacle and seeming for all the world as if he were walking down an empty hallway in a quiet house. This is film acting.\n\n“No, it isn't,” says Dreyfuss. “It's just technique. I don't scorn it, but I'm much more interested in imagination. You can he trained to hell and gone, but if you don't have the imagination to conceive a performance, you'll be technically trained to achieve mediocrity. You have to tell the truth, with as much attention to detail as you can. I usually have a visual, visceral image of the character — I see what he looks like and how he walks and talks immediately on the first reading of a script ; then I try to achieve that visual image. I haven't done much research or homework in the past. When I say I'm lazy, that's what I mean. My preparation seems to be much more subconscious than conscious.”\n\nActing, not stardom, is Dreyfuss's passion—hut he's becoming a star anyway. He's been touted as “the most exciting young actor on the screen today,” and as “a kind of actor who\n\nMichael Goodwin is a freelance writer living in San Vransisco.\n\nRichard Dreyfuss and director Jeremy Paul Kagan, left, conspiring on the set of the upcoming film “The Big Fix.” could only come out of the 60's, bright and vulnerable, energetic and uncertain.” Neil Simon, who wrote “The Goodbye Girl,” found him “bright and quick and dedicated to his work— no ego trips.” “Jaws” screenwriter Carl Gottlieb says, “He brings a kind of intellectual energy to his parts. His characters are always thinking, and putting that thought into action. His characters are always wide‐awake.”\n\nDreyfuss has been a celebrity ever since “Jaws,” but now he's becoming a certifiable, bankable Hollywood star, complete with Mercedes convertible, Hollywood mansion and (possibly even) an Academy Award. The reasons for his ascension have something to do with acting, but more to do with soul (or “persona,” if you prefer) — because movie stars are actors only in passing. In their most meaningful attribute they are mirrors that reflect their audience and their times.\n\nStars show us aspects of ourselves. When we like what we see reflected in their screen impersonation, we come back for more hoping to see yet another aspect of ourselves and like it too. This effect is something special to movies, reserved for that dream state when we see an image looming bigger than lJe in a darkened house, flickering hypnotically 24 times a second. Movie stars (there are always fewer than advertised, and we all know who the real ones are) slip into our most secret fantasies, interact with them, and give them back transfigured. Bogart was more than an actor — he was a part of us, a facet of someone we all dreamed of being. John Wayne, James Dean and Garbo are all cult figures whose personalities are now part of the American conscious\n\nIf Dreyfuss is on his way to culthood status, who he is matters just as much as what he does. Obviously, he is a resourceful, technically polished actor—but so are many minor players. In the end, Dreyfuss (like any serious artist) is defined by what he chooses to show us. He shows us intelligence, and he shows us courage. Not the physical courage of Cary Grant's daring flight over high mountain passes, not the moralistic courage of John Wayne, who would win the war against subhuman Germans and Japanese, not the neurotic courage of Richard Burton sacrificing himself in battle out of secret self‐loathing, but a kind of stubborn, idealistic and defiant courage that became fashionable in the 1960's, although it was at least as old as Henry David Thoreau — the courage to go up against the system, to fight City Hall. Dreyfuss's defiance has the characteristics of his generation, which took for granted its innate superiority. The almost ritualized uprising of the youth in at what was seen to be the moral corruption of all in power; it created a reverence of defiance for its own sake. Some smoked marijuana in public, others faced rioting police in Chicago. And many, Dreyfuss among them, said “no” to fighting the Vietnam War.\n\nDreyfuss was a conscientious objector, and he was articulate enough to convince the Westwood Draft Board that he wasn't kidding. Consequently, he spent 1968 and 1969 working at Los Angeles County General Hospital. Not as romantic as fleeing to Canada, perhaps, but it was better than going to jail — and a lot more respectable. A nice form of rebellion, suitable for audiences of all ages, and one of the reasons, at least symbolically, that he appeals to parents of the 60's as much as their children.\n\nStill, saying any kind of no to the war in 1967 was an act of some daring, and it worked crucial changes in Dreyfuss's image of himself. In the parts he chose to play thereafter, that sense of rebellion, of an individual who had internalized the ultimate responsibility for his actions, was never far from the surface. Some of his characterizations have been more likeable than others, but all of them are capable of drawing a line and holding it. The college‐bound kid in “American Graffiti,” who reserves the right not to go to college; the shark expert in “Jaws,” who knows he's right and the authorities are wrong — and acts accordingly; the saucerdrunk workingman in “Close Encounters,” who takes on a gigantic military operation and beats it because he knows he has a right to climb into that saucer — all of them reflect a facet of the American character that couldn't have been shown on the screen before 1968— least\n\nFor Dreyfuss's character, the magic moments in “Close Encounters” come\n\nwhen he faces the authorities and insists, “There's nothing wrong with the air,” finally demanding, “Who the hell are you people?” his voice breaking with moral outrage. Similarly, the key scene in “The Goodbye Girl” comes early on, when Dreyfuss stands up to Marsha Mason and cries, “Them is my conditions!” The scene is played for comedy, but the subtext rings with the sense of a generation taking itself seriously.\n\nThe hip, intelligent, left‐leaning kids\n\n‘I usually have a visual, visceral image of the character — I see what he looks like and how he walks and talks on the first reading of a script; then I try to achieve that visual image.’\n\nOff Broadway in Israel Horovitz's “Line.”\n\nIn Shaw's “Major Barbara.”\n\nIn “American Graffiti,” his first hit. who grew up with Dreyfuss in the 60's recognized him (and themselves) right away. They Loved his charm, his honesty, and the intelligence behind his eyes. They respected his ambition, as they began to acknowledge their own. “I always knew that I could be a star for this whole audience that didn't relate to John Wayne or Al Pacino,” says Dreyfuss, “an urban, progressive, intellectually oriented audience, not too macho, people who read, people who listen to Paul Simon and Randy Newman. People like me.”\n\nDreyfuss is 5 feet 8 inches tall, and he's determined to play Napoleon — a hero of his with whom he shares shortness, open ambition and a driving need to achieve. “I'm still working on the telegram to Kubrick,” he says, “but think it's going to read, ‘If the Napoleon you want is the Napoleon I want to play — look out, Jack!'” His hair is graying and curly. The gray is natural (it started when he was 17); the curl comes and goes, courtesy of the makeup department. He wears lightly blue‐tinted wire‐rimmed glasses, and at the moment he's got a little moustache for the part of Moses Wine, exhippie, in “The Big Fix.”\n\nHe's got a reputation as a hot poker player and a sexual stud. He likes being around women (as anyone on a Dreyfuss set can testify) — he solicits their attention and flourishes in their company. But he's been steady with his girlfriend, Lucinda, for several years, and seems quite happy with the arrangement. When he's not working, he stays home reading history, science fiction and (he whispers) popular novels and watches old movies on television. “We're really rather boring people,” he says, by which he means that he and Lucinda eat out at inexpensive Chinese restaurants and bring home the left\n\nHe has an apartment on New York's Upper West Side, but he's never in New York anymore. He used to have a house in Los Angeles's Silver Lake district, but “a tree that lived in my front yard \\sub}fell down and revealed the neighbors to me, and this was right after ‘Jaws’ when I was getting 80 phone calls a day and people were bribing my answering service for my private number, and suddenly privacy became very imporcant to me.” So the Silver Lake house went on the market, and Dreyfuss and Lucinda moved into the first of a series of rented houses. He's been in this rented house for all of two weeks; there are no clues to his inner life here.\n\n“But that's all over now,” he says. “We bought a fantastic house, Stan Laurel's old house — a Spanish‐Moorish mansion built in 1925. We move in this month. I'm convinced that Stan Laurel is still there, somewhere, looking for work.”\n\nFinding a gag line for the end of the story is typical Dreyfuss. He's fast, he's sharp, and he's very funny. Also, he's an incorrigible actor. In the course of a 10‐minute conversation, I noted him boxing, diving, leaning, pacing, pointing, swimming, throwing a pack of cigarettes into the sink and having heart attack. He talks with stage directions. He's incapable of telling a story without raising his voice, dropping into dialect or acting out one of the parts. The only time the riffs stop is when he's about to step in front of a camera ; then they turn into a performance.\n\nIf it matters who Dreyfuss is, what's at least equally interesting right now is where he is — trembling on the brink of stardom. He's come as far and fast as he has because of a sense of truthfulness he conveys‐of inner authenticity to his characters. Can he take that with him? For that matter, can he take himself with him? The fantasy exchange between audience and star can be dangerous. On the positive side is fame, power and tremendous wealth. On the negative side is depression, psychic depletion — at worst, death. How is Dreyfuss handling it? Is Mephistopheles coming through the floor to colthe Devil's contract?\n\nDreyfuss has just turned 30 (he calls it “the big three‐oh”), an early age to be fulfilling his lifelong fantasies. “I never wanted to do anything but act,” he says. “and I always knew I'd be a star, ever since I was 9. You know the 20th Century‐Fox logo, the one with the big cement‐block letters? Well, in my mind it was always ‘Richard Dreyfuss the Star’ in those same cement letters. It made me go through the rejection of interviews, the humiliation of reading for parts, the put‐down of not getting\n\n‘I always knew that could be a star for the audience that didn't relate to John Wayne or Al Pacino,’ says Dreyfuss.

His friends were disturbed by his dramatic weight gain — he seemed to be suffer. ing. Dreyfuss had painfully discovered the deception of success — that instead of the the joy of having finally achieved his fantasies, he felt let down, and almost overwhelmed by the sad feeling of “Is this is all there is?”\n\n“1 was happy until I was 27. I was much happier with my potential stardom than when that stardom became reality. It really weirded me out, and realized that I wasn't happy. I was eating a lot and drinking too much and doing drugs. So I started seeing shrink eight months ago. Straight psychotherapy. I don't lie on a couch; I sit up. I'm a thousand times healthier than I was a year ago. I don't drink at all now, and I don't take drugs either. I'm not as ecstatic yet as I'd like to be, but at least I'm not self‐destructive.”\n\nDreyfuss is not Canadian, as some people think, despite his convincingly ethnic performance as the aggressive Canadian Jewish adolescent Duddy Kravitz. He was born in Brooklyn, grew up in Los Angeles, and is very New York.\n\nDrefuss's mother, Gerry, a large women with a throaty Lauren Racall voice, is annoyed at previously printed suggestions that her son had a radical childhood in a “left‐wing pocket” of Bayside, Queens. “We've been active in progressive democratic politics all of our lives, but we're not Socialists or Zionists.” Dreyfuss is clearly very fond of his parents, and proud of their politics. “I used to talk much more about my dad than my mom — both of them were enormous influences on me, in terms of honor and politics and morality. As a kid, I used to pride myself on being the only one in the neighborhood who liked his parents. My father was an attorney and my mother was a housewife. And they still are, but my father doesn't practice anymore. I asked him why, and he said, ‘I don't have to practice; I'm very good at it.’ In 1956, my father, who had an office on the 87th floor State and was\n\nFew people saw Dreyfuss as Baby Face Nelson in “Dillinger.”\n\nDreyfuss's performance as Duddy Kravitz brought him to national prominence.\n\nHe still loves “Inserts,” an unsuccessful attempt at highbrow pornography.\n\nHe publicly criticized the blockbuster “Jaws,” during its filming -to his regret. not very successful, got sick and tired of New York. He came home to our apartment in Queens and said, ‘Let's get out of here.’ Thirteen days later, we had sold everything we owned and sailed to Europe, where we blew all our money in six months. We got back to New York with just enough money to buy an old 1950 Cadillac and drive to L.A., where we started all over again. thought it was neat‐I was too young to be poor, and too young to be scared.” If the tales of his radical upbringing are exaggerated, the tales of his early fixation on acting are not. “I think he was born with it,” says Gerry. “When we moved to L.A. in 1956, Richard joined the West Side Jewish Center, and he immediately got into all the plays. That was all he cared about. He was a clown. He played religious parts — Theodore Herz!, Haman — but he was very comedic, and he was noticeable in everyhe\n\nDreyfuss remembers those first parts, too. “To me, the smell of spirit gum has always been very, very Jewish,” he says. He made his first acting money while he was still in high school, and for 10 years after that he zigzagged from New York to Los Angeles and back again, doing Broadway, Off Broadway, repertory and improvisational comedy. (“I wanted to be starving actor in New York,” he notes, “but every time I went to New York worked.”) During the late 60's, he did lot of television, mainly “jerks and psychopaths” on shows like “Mod Squad” and “The Young Lawyers.” It was not a happy time for him.\n\nHe was appearing in Shaw's “Major Barbara” at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles in 1973 when he was picked to play Curt Henderson in George Lucas's “American Graffiti.” It wasn't his first film role (he prefers not to talk about “The Young Runaways” or “The Valley of the Dolls'), but it was the first one that was any good. “I thought ‘Graffiti’ was a nice little film that would make $6 million,” he says, grinning, “which just goes to show you should never trust my instincts.” It made $50 million. Curt Henderson, the slightly cerebral high‐school graduate with misgivings about college, was perfect part for Dreyfuss, allowing his own passion and sensitivity to shine through. The $50 million didn't hurt ei-\n\nThat same year, Dreyfuss took the part of Baby Face Nelson in “Dillinger” ‐a tough, minimal B‐movie written and directed by John Milius. Dreyfuss turned in a genre‐style performance with not a single wasted motion, but the film never achieved the following it deserved. B‐movies seldom do.\n\nIn 1979, he went to Canada to make “The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz,” based on Mordecai Richler's popular novel. It won first prize at the Berlin Film Festival, but Dreyfuss was in hot water just the same. His portrayal of the aggressive 18-year-old with an insatiable desire for wealth and recognition, growing up in Montreal's Jewish ghetto during the 90's, made many people quite uncomfortable. There were accusations of anti-Semitism in Montreal's Jewish community as well as a widely read feature article that opened with the question “Is Richard Dreyfuss really Duddy Kravitz?” and ended with the conclusion that, yes, he probably was. The controversy was a testimonial to a good performance.\n\n“There's a lot of Duddy that isn't me, but there”s a lot that is. I learned more about myself doing that than any other part. There were many aspects to Duddy that are considered unpleasant, but an actor's job is to find the truth within himself that fits the character and bring it out. I realized that I was going to have to look into myself for things that weren't very pleasant selfishness, manipulation, cruelty, narrow‐mindedness, obsessiveness those were the things I had to find to make it work. My obligation as an actor tell the truth.”\n\nStill, Dreyfuss didn't like his portrayal. “I was terrified I'd never be hired again after Duddy Kravitz,” he says. “I saw every line reading that I did wrong, I saw every false energy level, saw everything I could have done better in the ensuing year. I said, ‘God, if gets sold in the United States, I'm dead.’ So it got sold and it made me hot actor.”\n\nIt made him so hot they offered him the role of Matt Hooper in “Jaws.” In fact, they offered it to him three times; he kept turning it down. “Hey, man, fish story? “ said Dreyfuss. “I'm an actor.” Carl Gottlieb, an old friend as well as the scriptwriter on the film, urged him to take the part, and worked it over with him until he agreed. “Rick wanted to know who the character was,” Gottlieb recalls, “and where he\n\nAs a U.F.O. believer in “Close Encounters of the Third Kind.”\n\nRomantically pursuing Marsha Mason in Neil Simon's “The Goodbye Girl.”\n\nwas going. He added a lot, too.” Dreyfuss took the part, but he had plenty of time for second thoughts as the shooting stretched into month after month — and he made no secret of them. He criticized Universal for treating minor players badly. He complained about unnecessary delays. And when it was all over, he added insult to injury with his widely quoted statement that “Jaws” was “a waste of my time as an actor.”\n\nTo a segment of Drey fuss's audience, putting down “conglomerate'’ Universal and its mass‐market shark movie was a courageous act of buck ing the system — proof that Dreyfuss was still a member in good standing of the “counterculture,” or whatever passed for one in 1975. But to the film community, it was a self‐indulgent outburst by an arrogant young actor who didn't know a good thing when he saw it; it made a bad impression he is still trying to change. Universal just considered it unprofessional, and these days Dreyfuss agrees. “I badmouthed that film all over the place before I had even seen it,” he says. “When I did see it, it scared the hell out of me. The editing and construction of that film are amazing.”\n\nIn the warm afterglow of “Jaws'” $200 million, Dreyfuss made one of those daring moves that tempt actors sometimes — he decided to act in a film called “Inserts” for love, for art. Written and directed by John Byrum, it suffered from uneven performances and a wildly fluctuating tone, but its underlying concept was compelling: A brilliant silent filmmaker is reduced to making pornography in the early 30's, but he tries to make the most exquisite pornography possible because he's still an artist. The film's attempt to use the sexual act as a metaphor for the creative process was perfectly serious, but “Inserts” got an X rating anyway, and a nasty set of reviews. Audiences stayed home.\n\nDreyfuss is still bitter about the film. “The thing that bothers me is the disrespect shown the attempt at something fine,” he says, “the idea of saying it was, in any sense, a pornographic movie. It's obvious that there's an intelligence behind that film, an attempt at something very grand.”\n\n“Inserts” did Dreyfuss no lasting harm at the box office, since very few people saw it, but it hurt him in the studio sweepstakes. He had come out of “Jaws” looking like money — not bankable without a solid property, perhaps, but surely his next film would put him over. But “Inserts” would be his last for two years. He was working, of course, mostly on “Close Encounters” — but “ ‘Close Encounters’ is not an actor's film,” according to Dreyfuss. “I'm O.K. in it; I'm not great. The special effects, as you know, are put in later, so spent a lot of time doing this” — his mouth opens in horror, his eyes go wide and follow an invisible something as it goes whiffing past. “You do it on rocks and in houses and in canyons and in valleys, and they pay you of\n\nNot only can Dreyfuss play artiste, but, when the scene calls for it, he can play cigar‐chomping agent as well: “'Goodbye Girl” will make more of a difference to my bankability than ‘Close Encounters,’ “ he figures. “'Close Encounters’ is Steven Spielberg's movie; ‘Goodbye Girl’ is mine. It's all variable anyway. After ‘Duddy,’ I could bank $1 million with a good script. After ‘Jaws,’ I could have done $3 million to $4 million. But nobody knows how to make these decisions. Before ‘Close Encounters’ I was playing poker one night with some of the guys who run the studios, and asked if I could write an I.O.U. for $20. So Marty Elfand, a Warners producer, said, ‘Sure, your credit is good,’ and I said, ‘Until ‘Close Encounters’ opens,’ and Marty said, ‘That is ex-\n\n“We have two minutes,” says Dreyfuss. “Ask me a two‐minute question “What's the worst performance you ever gave?”\n\n“'Raid on Entebbe.’ I'll tell you an ironic story. I never defined myself as an actor because of the paycheck — in fact, I used to turn down work. And they kept saying things like” — oily producer's voice — “ ‘Who does he think he is? Let's see what he does when we offer him a series.’ And I'd turn that down too.\n\n“Anyway, this was after ‘Jaws,’ and I hadn't done TV in four years. TV is bad, it's awful, terrible, never good, and you just don't do it. So I'm at my agent's office and I get a call: ‘Would you like to do “Raid on Entebbe'? You're Jewish,’ and I said no, and they said, ‘50,000 a day for five days'.” — a six‐second pause” —and I said yes. Well, I didn't say yes; I had a heart attack, fell to the floor, and woke up doing this piece of filth. A piece of absolute whorish stupidity: $50,000 a day for five days!” (Dreyfuss feigns a heart attack.) “Everyone is going, ‘Do it. What the hell, do it. Incredible money. What are you, crazy? That's myth money. . . .’ And I said, ‘Well, give me one reason why I shouldn't.’ And when I heard myself say that, I knew I had gone over the cliff and down into the valley. I had never done that before, taken material that was filth for money. I just didn't know how to turn down $50,000 a day.\n\n“It was valuable, though, because it taught me that I could lose everything that 1 held dear about myself. So, a few weeks ago, someone came to me and they said, ‘We're gonna have a Ford commercial that's gonna tie in with ‘Close Encounters,’ and if you participate in it we'll give you a T‐bird for a couple of years.’ I looked at the guy and I said, ‘Man, do me a favor and offer me $50,000 a day for five days so I can turn it down and feel clean.”\n\n“I'm going to New York,” says Dreyfuss. “I'm gonna do a whirlwind two‐day promo tour for ‘The Goodbye Girl.’ Lucinda is coming, my mom is coming, we're going to catch a midnight flight on Friday, spend a day and a half doing about 50 interviews, catch the premiere, go to the party, and fly back on the Warner Brothers jet late Sunday night. Want come?”\n\nOf course I want to come. also want to ask how Dreyfuss, the 60's rebel, relates to this private jet, this ultimate status symbol of the corporate 70's, and whether, perhaps, it marks his passage into a new relationship with the wealthy conglomerates that sell movies to America in 1978. The question comes out: “You fly around a lot on the Warners jet?” “Actually, I've never flown on a private jet before, and I'll tell you the truth: I'm really looking forward to it. I'm looking forward to this entire weekend. I want applause, I want people to like me, I want people to love this movie. I want to see it happen. How many weekends like this are theregonna be in my life?”\n\n“The Goodbye Girl” is something special for Dreyfuss. When he says, “Doing it was the best thing I ever did,” he takes the statement past hyperbole into simple, wideeyed enthusiasm. “I liked my work, I liked me, I liked the people I was working with, I loved Marsha, I loved Quinn, I loved the goddamn grip. I could do ‘The Goodbye Girl’ as a 9-to-5 job for the rest of my life.” Written by Neil Simon, directed by Herb Ross, costarring Marsha Mason (Simon's wife) and Quinn Cummings, the film focusses on a struggling actor who comes to New York to launch his career and, in the process, finds the love of his life. Dreyfuss hasn't had a part nearly since Duddy Kravitz.\n\nOutside the Astor Plaza Theater on West 44th Street, the cops are keeping the sidewalk clear for the stars. There are no klieg lights, but there are plenty of photographers and reporters to certify the presence of a no‐kidding world premiere. Marsha Mason arrives in full‐length black velveteen followed by husband Neil, Herb Ross and wife —all greeted by knowledgeable\n\nBut when Dreyfuss, Lucinda and his mother, Gerry, arrive, the photographers start flashing pictures and the crowd breaks into applause. He's looking sharp in a blackstriped suit and a blue tie, and he's grinning like a fool. He spots a friend in the crowd and yells, but people start pressing closer, and a flying wedge of Warners’ promo men urges him inside.\n\nWhen the film starts, Dreyfuss's performance draws giant laughs from the $100-aseat crowd. It's fascinating to see how much of himself Dreyfuss brings to the part — the Groucho Marx riffs, the Jewish inflections under pressure, the gags, the comic dialects, the charm. But there's more to his performance than mannerism. One moment in particular catches him in full flight, that moment when he realizes his director actually wants him to play a homosexual Richard III. In merciless close‐up, the camera watches as his smile slowly starts to fade, recovers, then fades and disappears. He looks around desperately, starts to smile again, stops, and flashes his eyes to left and right in helpless agony. It takes less than five seconds. This is film acting.\n\nWhen the lights come up, Dreyfuss is still sitting quietly in his seat, smiling to himself. Then, as the cheering builds, he remembers the people around him, stands up, bows, smiles. He's back at work.\n\nNext door, at the Minskoff Theater Promenade, there's a party going on. There are two bars, three buffets, 61 tables and a band that's playing “Mountain Greenery.”\n\nAll around, people are whispering about Academy Award nominations, while Dreyfuss whizzes happily from table to table, kissing women, handshaking men. Once, as he sweeps past me, he stops and whispers, “Hey, this is one hell of an evening, man, this is 10 out of a possible 10!” And then he's gone. There aren't many 60's refugees here tonight mostly over‐40 mogul types in chic evening clothes. But isn't that what stardom means? The evening is wearing along. The band, having run through “Singin’ In the Rain” and “Just One of Those Things” is now playing “You Make Me Feel So Young.” It's not quite midnight, and the California Cinderellas — Rick, Lucinda and Gerry — are on their way down the grand staircase to the street. “Having a good time?” Dreyfuss asks his\n\nInstead of answering, Gerry throws her arms around him and kisses him. “I'm proud of you!” she declares.\n\n“Really?” asks Dreyfuss, milking it shamelessly.\n\nGerry plants herself firmly on the bottom step, glances at\n\nDreyfuss and Lucinda at the premiere of “The Goodbye Girl.” the crowd, and grins. “Yeah, man!”\n\nFans come rushing, holding out “American Graffiti” album covers for Dreyfuss to sign. The flying wedge gets us to the limousine, but not before a taxicab full of long‐haired kids spots Dreyfuss. ‘Richard, you were great,” they start yelling. “We love you, we love you!”\n\nDreyfuss can take it — all of it. He waves back and murmurs, “That's the most beautiful cab I've ever seen.”\n\nSo who is Richard Dreyfuss?\n\nActing is never a random career choice, and amateur psychiatrists have long been enamored of the game wherein actors, beneath the layers of charm and verbal grace, are shown to be hiding from the world, miserable, confused and desperate for the attention they never got as kids. These analysts might make something out of Gerry Dreyfuss's remark that as a child Rick never had a fight. “He never raised his hand in anger,” she says. “He always talked his way out of the fights that kids get into.” Hmmm, hiding behind a smoke screen\n\n“There was constant, competitive joking and work‐play in our house when I was growing up. We were all very competitive about talking. My brother was able to get off a lot of good one‐liners so I wanted to get off a lot of good oneliners, and my father was able to debate very well so I wanted to be able to debate very well. Also, I wasn't very athletic in high school, and you had to have some way of putting down the hamburgers when they came to beat you up. The weapon I had was a mouth. They had to know that even if they hurt me, they were gonna be humiliated. That even (turn the ground with nose bleeding, I was still going to say something that could put them\n\nClassmates at Beverly Hills High remember him as intensely energized, intellectually precocious and in love with talk.\n\n“It was like hanging out with a Victor Hugo novel,” recalls Larry Bishop, high‐school pal and (later) a comember of “The Session,” Dreyfuss's late‐60's improv‐comedy group. “My major preoccupation, aside from acting, was girls — but Rickie would always be talking about courage, and conscience, and passion. We enrolled in a tapdancing class together. and one day we were going through a number, da‐da, da‐da, and he turned to me and said, ‘What would you die for?’ In the middle of a tap dance!”\n\n“I have this theory called the Theory of the Laughing Gods,” he says. “They're two crazed, drunken whackos who sit up there drinking mead, and when things are going well they point at you and say, ‘Infantile paralysis.’ Sometimes, when things are going badly, they say, ‘Academy Award nomination,’ but mostly it's infantile paralysis.”\n\nThe limo drives to La Guard-\n\nAs a former hippie turned private eye in “The Big Fix.” ia, through a gate, onto the field and right up to a 16‐seat Gulf Stream jet with a high tail and a rakish look. Our bags get loaded on (including 90 pounds of prime New York deli that Dreyfuss is taking back for the film crew) and we pile inside. It's got plush seats, a table, a couch, a galley, big oval windows, Danish modern decor; a digital readout at the front of the cabin for altitude, ground speed, outside temperature, elapsed time, real time; a bathroom like a star's dressing room, and a takeoff like Buck Rogers. Before we know it we're doing 400 m.p.h. feet.\n\nl_ucinda and Gerry break Jut the bagels, lox and sturgeon, while Dreyfuss talks business with a young man in suit and tie who's sitting in the back of the cabin. He's Dick Shepherd, executive vice president of M-G-M. (M-G-M is co‐producing “Goodbye Girl” with Warners.)\n\n“We bought a 90‐second spot on the A.F.I. television show for ‘The Goodbye Girl,’ “ he says.\n\n“Wow!” says Dreyfuss. “That must have cost a lot.”\n\n“A dollar and a half,” says Shepherd, “with four zeros. But don't worry, you're paying for it. It'll just defer your profits.”\n\nI try to doze but a movement startles me — it's just Dreyfuss. “You know,” he says, “this plane is science fiction. It's like all those private fliers and hells in Heinlein's books. . .”\n\nSuddenly, half‐asleep, I realize this is my last chance to ask the questions that still want answers. “What have you done to deserve all this?” hear myself saying. “Why is it happening to you?”\n\n“I'm a very good actor,” says Dreyfuss, “and I have always loved acting more than anything else on this planet.” He stops, listening to the sense of his own words against the soft hiss of the engines. “I'll always be able to make $250 a week at some repertory theater. It may sound silly, but that knowledge has brought me a lot of inner peace. I'll always be able to go somewhere and act.”\n\n“Is there anything you ever wanted badly that you didn't get?”\n\nWonderingly, he shakes his head, like a kid watching an invisible something go whiffing past. “No,” he says. “Isn't that amazing? I didn't end up pumping gas.”\n\nLater, we're on the ground iii Los Angeles, standing around the plane while the limousines sort themselves out. The air is still, it's two hours before sunrise, and it's all some kind of California dream. I look around, and Richard Dreyfuss is hugging the executive vice president of M-G-M. ■"
