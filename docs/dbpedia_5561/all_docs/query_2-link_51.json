        "text": "It’s the antithesis of “show it, don’t say it”… and it flat out works.\n\nMonologues are common with stage plays, but not so much with movies. Of course, “motion pictures” are primarily a visual medium — motion pictures — so dialogue, while important, is a secondary form of communication cinematically. However, great dialogue can transcend the adage, “show it, don’t say it.” And perhaps nothing better exemplifies that point than this great scene in the movie Jaws (1975), screenplay by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb, based on the novel by Peter Benchley."
