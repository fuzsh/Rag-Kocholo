        "text": "Improvisation is a sword most actors learn how to wield. However, only the ones who've mastered the art can come up with an absolutely killer line on the spot, often making for some of the most memorable movie moments.\n\nHere are 17 iconic movie lines actors came up with on the spot:\n\n1. Roy Scheider improvised the line \"You’re gonna need a bigger boat!” in Jaws because it was an inside joke among the cast and crew.\n\nWatch the full scene here:\n\n2. The scene in Black Panther where M'Baku leads the Jabari men in grunting at Everett Ross for speaking out of turn was entirely Winston Duke's idea.\n\nWatch the full scene here:\n\n3. When Princess Leia told Han Solo \"I love you\" in The Empire Strikes Back, Harrison Ford replied with \"I know\" because he thought it fit his character better than the scripted response.\n\nWatch the full scene here:\n\n4. Matthew McConaughey was thrown into a scene in Dazed and Confused last minute with no lines written, so as soon as the director called \"Action!\" he said, \"Alright, alright, alright!”\n\nWatch the full scene here:\n\n5. Tony Stark originally wasn't supposed to reveal his superhero identity at the end of Iron Man, but at the last minute, Robert Downey Jr. added, \"I am Iron Man.\"\n\nWatch the full scene here:\n\n6. Bill Murray improvised most of Peter Venkman's lines in Ghostbusters, including his iconic response to getting slimed: \"I feel so funky.”\n\nWatch the full scene here:\n\n7. While filming a fight scene in Fight Club, Edward Norton surprised Brad Pitt by hitting him in the ear, so Brad's response of \"Why the ear?\" was genuine.\n\nWatch the full scene here:\n\n8. During the last week of filming for Taxi Driver, director Martin Scorsese locked himself and Robert De Niro in a room and asked the actor to say something in the mirror, so Robert came up with, “You talkin’ to me?\"\n\nWatch the full scene here:\n\n9. Shooting on Casablanca began with an unfinished script, so as Rick and Ilsa said their goodbyes, Humphrey Bogart ad-libbed the line \"Here's looking at you, kid.\"\n\nWatch the full scene here:\n\n10. When Murray shaves his head during the party scene in Clueless, Donald Faison said, \"I'm keeping it real!\" because he heard a younger neighbor say it.\n\nWatch the full scene here:\n\n11. While filming the scene where Forrest meets Bubba in Forrest Gump, Tom Hanks came up with the line, \"My name’s Forrest Gump. People call me Forrest Gump.\"\n\nWatch the full scene here:\n\n12. While filming The Shining, Jack Nicholson improvised the line \"Here's Johnny!\" as a reference to The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.\n\nWatch the full scene here:\n\n13. While filming Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, director Adam McKay told Steve Carrell to just say anything because he wanted Brick Tamland to have more lines, so Steve said, “I love lamp.”\n\nWatch the full scene here:\n\n14. In Avengers: Infinity War, the line \"I don't wanna go,\" which Peter Parker utters right before he turns to dust, was inspired by an acting technique Tom Holland uses to make himself cry.\n\nWatch the full scene here:\n\n15. In The Godfather, Clemenza's original line ended at \"Leave the gun,\" but Richard Castellano added \"take the cannoli\" at the suggestion of his wife, Ardell Sheridan.\n\nWatch the full scene here:\n\n16. Joe Pesci's line \"Funny how?\" in Goodfellas was based on a real incident from when he was a server who accidentally offended a mobster by telling him he was funny.\n\nWatch the full scene here:\n\n17. And finally, while filming Good Will Hunting, Robin Williams improvised an entire speech about his character's late wife that nearly made Matt Damon break character, starting with, \"She used to fart in her sleep. One night it was so loud it woke the dog up.\"\n\nWatch the full scene here:\n\nShare This Article"
