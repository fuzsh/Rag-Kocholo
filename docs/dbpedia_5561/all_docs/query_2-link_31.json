        "text": "Well, the headline is half-truth so you can come and read this post\n\nI was watching a Doc last night with Steven S. and how JAWS was shot.\n\nIt turns out they had a bunch of drafts and none were good enough for Steven but the Studio already funded and they're working on it. (Don't you wonder about these 'pros' 'studios' who fund something it's not even scripted to shoot?)\n\nAnyway, the story boards had to be scrapped because JAWS the prop didn't work and had to shoot it as you saw it in the movie. Actually the original story starring JAWS and showing it was the KEY FEATURE of the movie. So, Steven said the actual footage how they did it was a better idea than the one storyboarded.\n\nShooting daily and there are NO SCRIPT for the next day!\n\nAt night they worked on the next day script as a collective group.\n\nImagine, no script and no one knows how this will be edited. The studio boss went to location and thinking of canceling it. Steven at one point decided he wants to walk away from this project as well.\n\nThe pressure was on to shoot this in a very short time so the MARKET (public interest in the book) don't vanish, JAWS being #1 on the best seller list. Talking about BUSINESS decisions to drive the art.\n\nIf you have a chance to watch this Doc, it's worth your time.\n\nSo, my question is; how do you feel about your screenplay when these pros had a problem with their 'pro' screenplay ?\n\nAre you surprised why you're not getting anywhere with your script (selling) ?\n\nSo, my question is; how do you feel about your screenplay when these pros had a problem with their 'pro' screenplay ?\n\nAre you surprised why you're not getting anywhere with your script (selling) ?\n\nI feel that I should retain a fairly large library of ideas for myself to utilize as appropriate opportunities arise to develop them to their best potential.\n\nIn the meanwhile I will pursue developing the easier ideas to execute as writer/director.\n\nThe following is C&Ped from an earlier post of mine:\n\nIn my research on how to write and construct a spec screenplay I noted how many films were written by established industry insiders and by those who knew someone already in the biz.\n\nAn exclusionary club, a cadre, nepotism, whathaveyou, it shouldn't be surprising - go with what you know, don't waste time looking for \"the best\".\n\nIt's all a crapshoot anyway in this industry.\n\nFurthermore, I went and researched the beginnings of many many many screenwriters.\n\nMost started out with little weenie projects.\n\nAdditionally I consistently noted the high frequency of writer directors there were for distributed films.\n\n(If you can't get distribution... what's the point? Art for art's sake? Pfft. Yeah. Grow up).\n\nSo I went hunting for independent film sites and found IT with the intent & goal of learning the mechanics of HOW to get a film made and distributed myself because there's even less of a chance of selling a spec screenplay.\n\n700 to 800 MPAA rated films annually\n\n+ 500 to 600 non-MPAA rated films annually\n\nPage 13 - http://www.mpaa.org/Resources/93bbeb16-0e4d-4b7e-b085-3f41c459f9ac.pdf\n\n\"There are an estimated 4,000 - 5,000 independent films made every single year. Here's the unfortunate truth: Less than 5% of all these movies end up with distribution.\"\n\nhttp://www.distribution.la/\n\nProbably not the most reliable source of intel, but it doesn't sound like complete BS.\n\nMaybe this'll be better...\n\n\"Only about 40 of the 3,812 finished films that were submitted to Sundance this year will get any kind of distribution at all. That’s slightly over one percent. The other 98% you will never get to see – not even on Netflix.\"\n\nhttp://www.culturalweekly.com/indie-films-state-of-the-union.html\n\nLooks somewhat more credible.\n\nAnd considering that not every indie film gets submitted to Sundance (on a lark) their 3,812 number suggests the previous distribution.la numbers were low balling the total number.\n\nI bet it's closer to 8,000, give or take a thousand. Or two.\n\nLettuce move onto spec screenplays...\n\n\"I often see the figure that 40,000 (or more) scripts are written each year... \" (2004 figure)\n\nhttp://messageboard.donedealpro.com/boards/archive/index.php/t-7081.html\n\n\"According to the Writer's Guild of America, 55,000 pieces of literary material are registered annually, 30,00 of which are screenplays.\"\n\nhttp://www.screenwritingtostandard.com/\n\n\"An old adage in Hollywood is that in spite of the hundreds of thousands of rejected scripts every year, a good script will find an audience. Format properly, be professional, and write a killer script, and your chances are maximized for success.\"\n\nhttp://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-spec-script.htm\n\nPerhaps a little melodramatic, but point made - it's more than a few thousand.\n\nCertainly more than the number of never-to-be-seen feature films made.\n\nA LOT more.\n\nIf you want to get into the film industry to sell screenplays - the easiest route is be a writer/directer for the sole reason just to get a toehold in the film business.\n\nPeople are MORE interested in your film than in your screenplay(s).\n\nThis is a industry built on networking and relationships - MUCH MORE - than producing a fine product.\n\nFour monkeys that can get a chimp eating a banana on film will do better than a genius pounding out PC/Mac thespian gold.\n\nWell, the headline is half-truth so you can come and read this post\n\nThat is more like less than 20% truth in that statement. They had a script, a complete script. Re-writing is NOT the same as having no script at all.\n\nShooting daily and there are NO SCRIPT for the next day!\n\nIn the case of JAWS specifically, actor Carl Gottlieb was also doing re-writes daily with Steven Speilberg to make dialogue more to his liking. They also had many days of re-writing because the mechanical shark did not work, or weather changed the scene intended to shoot, or they came up with new ideas to 'imply' the shark was there, like the barrel chase, etc.\n\nConsider also that the film went more than 50 days over schedule and more than double the original budget. Most indie films cannot afford that amount of time or money. The script changes were made to accommodate the Force Majure, as well as mechanical failures moreso than any creative reasons based on the written material.\n\nThere is a 125 minute documentary on the making of JAWS by Laurent Bouzereau (from the 20th anniversary laserdisc, rereleased with the 30th anniversary DVD) and the book by screenwriter/actor Carl Gottlieb called THE JAWS LOG that can speak to this all in much greater detail.\n\nSo, my question is; how do you feel about your screenplay when these pros had a problem with their 'pro' screenplay ?\n\nAre you surprised why you're not getting anywhere with your script (selling) ?\n\nI guess you got from Spielberg's statements in the documentary only what you wanted to hear. JAWS was a #1 best selling novel. The basic premise of the movie is the same as the book, along with the name recognition of the title. The changes to the screenplay were not motivated (by your own statements) by a disliking or problem with the screenplay as written - they were forced changes by circumstance.\n\nEVERY SINGLE MOVIE EVER MADE has 'problems' with their \"pro\" screenplay, whether an actor wants lines changed or a test audience hates the sad ending triggering reshoots. That is if you consider every single change to a script a 'problem'.\n\nThis is how I understood the events as depicting in the documentary. In fact, S.S. was nearly fired and told he'd never work in the business again.\n\nWhile it turned out o.k. for Steven, certainly not a model for how I would want to make a movie.\n\nThat is more like less than 20% truth in that statement. They had a script, a complete script. Re-writing is NOT the same as having no script at all.\n\nIn the case of JAWS specifically, actor Carl Gottlieb was also doing re-writes daily with Steven Speilberg to make dialogue more to his liking.

This echoes a discussion from another thread about needing to change scripts on the fly to meet production realities.\n\nSimply writing on spec will not get you very far. Like any business, you need to get recognized from the inside. If a writer wants to succeed, they should get started with an agency as a reader. It will vastly improve their own writing. This will also get them networked. If you can get an internship or write for a TV program (even though you're an unnamed minion often), it also hammers in the craft.\n\nEchoing Directorik, the reason most scripts go nowhere is they're not particularly good. An often unpalatable but true fact. Some bad scripts do get through but, as Rayw mentioned, this is also a business of nepotism.\n\nThe best bet of is being writer/director. It just takes a couple pebbles to start an avalanche. The GOOD NEWS is that Vimeo, youTube, and other video sites make it possible to showcase productions much easier than in the past. Just like people can now market their own music or books without major recording labels and publishers. Obviously they big guys still have muscle, but getting noticed by them is becoming easier.\n\nAgain, cool post.\n\nAn often unpalatable but true fact. Some bad scripts do get through but, as Rayw mentioned, this is also a business of nepotism.\n\nIf you don't mind me butting in, but I have become scared of this. Nepotism.\n\nIt seems as the years go on, the big wigs in Hollywood are looking to their own sons and daughters, family friends, and friends of close family friends more now than before. It worries me because even with all this free exposure (YouTube, Vimeo, etc) it seems the studios, big or small, don't want to take a risk on an unknown. They're making a ton of money off of all these horrible cliche action, thriller, you name it films and by putting the money in the hands of close friends. I know its been about who you know rather than what you know but it seems to be only who you know now more than ever.\n\nHollywood is milking all these aging great directors until they die. then what will they do? wheres all the great new talent to replace them?\n\nThanks for reading my rant on the subject. I'm sure there are many holes"
