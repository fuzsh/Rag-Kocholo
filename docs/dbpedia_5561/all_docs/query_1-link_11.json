        "text": "Presents\n\nCarl Gottlieb Reissiger\n\nPiano Trio No.1 in d minor, Op.25\n\n\"When I think of Reissiger's trios, the words lovely and jewel-like come to mind. These choice and lovely works remind one of a chain of flowers. In these trios, one immediately meets with a pleasing mood and can comfortably count on an enjoyable experience...He is a man of the world whose polished words speak of his travels and of conversations with famous men. His music never fatigues the ear, but holds our attention to the very end.\"---Robert Schumann\n\nCarl Gottlieb Reissiger (1798-1859) was born in the Prussian town of Belzig. He originally attended the famous Thomasschule in Leipzig as his father intended him to be a priest, however, his extraordinary musical talent was recognized and he was encouraged to pursue a musical career. His initial studies were with Johann Schlicht, Bach's fifth successor as Cantor of the Thomasschule. Subsequently, he went to Vienna and studied with Salieri. An early opera attracted Carl Maria von Weber's attention and Reissiger went to Dresden, eventually succeeding Weber as Music Director of the Dresden Court Orchestra, a post he held until his death. A leading conductor of German opera, Wagner worked under Reissiger for nearly a decade. Reissiger premiered Wagner's first opera. A prolific composer, as most composers of that time were, he penned works in virtually every genre. His works show the influence of the Viennese masters, in particular Schubert and Beethoven.\n\nHis piano trios, during his lifetime, were extraordinarily popular, so much so that he composed no less than 25. And his fecundity, made many of his contemporaries jealous and critical. They often would unfairly call him names such as \"the poor man's Schubert.\" However, the public adored his music for its appealing melodies, excitement, and drama. Amateur chamber music players never ceased to enjoy playing his works and professionals performed them in concert often to great success. It is a pity, the jeers of those who could not produce such ingratiating works and who were especially peeved that Reissiger could produce one after another, almost effortlessly, led to his music falling into oblivion. But now, when one of his works is encountered, the invariable reaction is, how could this work have disappeared.\n\nPiano Trio No.1 in d minor, Op.25 dates from 1825. The opening movement begins with a somber, almost doom-like Andante introduction which leads to the gorgeous main section, Allegro passionato, full of drama and forward motion. The second movement Andante quasi allegretto is full of beautiful singing episodes which clearly showcase Reissiger's gift for melody. This is followed by a Capriccio, allegro molto, which is more in the nature of an exuberent quick-time scherzo with a lovely contrasting trio. The finale, Allegro non troppo, as the other movements, features fetching melodies and is full of excitement.\n\nThis is a first class work not only suitable for the concert hall but also should be of interest to amateur players."
