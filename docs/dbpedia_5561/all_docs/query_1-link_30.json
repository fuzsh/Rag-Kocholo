        "text": "Comments A quality showpiece similar to the Weber Concertino. The piece is continuous but sectional, with a beautiful slow middle movement. Good music that is very rarely performed. Comments A fantastic showpiece that is practically unknown. Composed in theme and variation format. The tune is romantic and expressive, and the variations are equally romantic. This is difficult music requiring superb technical dexterity."
