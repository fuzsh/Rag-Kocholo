        "text": "Carl Gottlieb (born March 18, 1938) is an American screenwriter, actor, comedian and executive who appeared in S2's Mork's Baby Blues as Justice Abbott who Mork calls on to marry him and Kathy Cumberland who has deluded him into thinking she's carrying his child.\n\nBiography[]\n\nGottlieb was born to a middle class Jewish family in New York City, the son of Elizabeth, a medical administrative assistant, and Sergius M. Gottlieb, an engineer. After High School he studied drama at Syracuse University.\n\nCareer[]\n\nAfter college, he moved to California and in the 1960s became a member, of the San Francisco improvisational comedy troupe \"The Committee\", whose members included Beans Morocco, and Howard Hessemann, and which later hosted a young Robin Williams as a student of their Improv Workshops.

Minor acting roles have included Robert Altman's M*A*S*H and the film Clueless.\n\nPartial Filmography (Movie & TV Series)\n\nYear Title Role 1966 Hey Landlord (TV) Benny 1968 Maryjane Larry Kane 1968 I, Spy (TV) Large Man 1970 MASH 'Ugly John' 1972 Up the Sandbox Vinnie 1972 The Ken Berry 'Wow' Show (TV) Regular 1973 The Long Goodbye Wade Party Guest 1974 The Bob Newhart Show (TV) Mr Kuberski 1975 Jaws Harry Meadows 1976 Cannonball Terry McMillan 1978 Laverne & Shirley (TV) Station Master 1979 The Jerk Iron Balls McGinty 1979 Mork & Mindy (TV) Justice Aaron Abbot 1983 The Sting II Maitre D' 1984 Johnny Dangerously Dr. Magnus 1985 Into the Night Federal Agent 1995 Clueless Priest\n\nHe also directed episodes of shows such as Laverne & Shirley, Delta House, The George Burns Comedy Week, and Hooperman, as well as the movie Caveman (1981)\n\nMork & Mindy[]\n\nCarl's appearance was as Justice Aaron Abbot (the first alphabetically in the phone book) who Mork calls on, without the knowledge of gold digging Kathy Cumberland, to marry them at her apartment. Justice Abbott getting caught in the debate between Mindy & Mork about what he's doing and why he thinks he's doing it, Bickley's commentary and Kathy's constant de-escalating of her demands, until Abbot finally gives up and marches out."
