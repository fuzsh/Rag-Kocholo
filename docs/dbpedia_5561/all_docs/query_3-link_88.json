Three escaping jewel thieves meet in an abandoned warehouse awaiting the arrival of their boss and his son. The robbery they planned had fallen apart as soon as it began.\n\nHarvey Keitel plays Mr. White. Mr. White is an older and more experienced thief. He’s been in the game a while and shows strong confidence in his abilities. This is demonstrated as he defends the wounded Mr. Orange played by Tim Roth. Their boss, Joe claims Mr. Orange is an undercover cop and caused the robbery to fail in which other members thieves were killed and Mr. Orange himself, was critically wounded. The third thief is Mr. Pink played by Steve Buscemi. Mr. Pink is a young thief, much the junior of Mr. White and oddly placed into the scene as well as the movie.\n\nKeitel is quite the method actor. His personality in the film is consistent with his roles in other films. He is confident with deliberate movements. Keitel uses his personality to inflame the conflict in the scene. The boss has accused Mr. Orange (Roth) of being an undercover cop. Mr. White (Keitel) stands quite erect and demands proof of the claim. When the boss denies Mr. White’s request and pulls a gun on the dying Mr. Orange, Mr. White draws his own gun to protect Mr. Orange.\n\nKeitel’s performance is dramatic and emotional as in Red Dragon, U-571, and Cop Land (IMDB, 2015, Keitel). He brings his strong personality into these roles. He can be strongly quiet or a hurricane of acting force on the screen.\n\nRoth shows more realism in his acting as Mr. Orange. His character lies on the floor bleeding to death from a gunshot wound. Mr. Orange accepts the comfort of Mr. White but the would is critical and he feels he is dying, yet he conforms to his place in the criminal organization and keeps a low profile as his execution is argued. Mr. Orange doesn’t demand a doctor or care. He meekly accepts his imminent death. Mr. Orange speaks only once in the scene to emphatically deny the boss’ accusation despite two closeups of him laying in his own blood. His realism is that of one who has been discovered as a traitor and slowly, guiltily awaits his punishment. Roth plays the part without any additional personal flair or emotionally drawn emphasis similar to his other roles (Pulp Fiction) (IMDB, 2015, Roth)\n\nBuscemi plays Mr. Pink and shows us the third acting style of stylized acting. Buscemi speaks only twice in the scene. The first line is untimely and unrelated entirely which is quite synonymous of Buscemi’s other roles in movies. Mr. Pink questions the fact that another thief has been killed in the robbery. This is oddly timed and completely unrelated to the fact that the boss and Mr. White are arguing over a dying man and the critical nature of the argument that it may be this dying man that is the cause of the current predicament. Mr. Pink’s second line is that of an arbitrator. As the scene inflames and Mr. White, the boss and the boss’ son all draw guns on each other, Mr. Pink backs away while trying to talk everyone down. Mr. Pink is attempting to escape the standoff. His voluntary exclusion speaks to his self-manifested isolation and collaborates with his character’s quirky role as a character actor as in Buscemi’s other roles (28 Days, Escape from L.A., Fargo, Pulp Fiction, Con Air) (IMDB, 2015, Buscemi) .\n\nReferences\n\nIMDB.

Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds. As the colonel politely interrogates a farm owner, his confidence tells the audience that he will not accept failure in his quest and that the colonel is quite determined and patient (Goodykoontz, 2014, Ch. 5.2).\n\nAnother element of mise en scene is music. Music can convey an attitude, situation, or supplement a scene’s other elements (Goodykoontz, 2014, Ch. 5.2). The increasing tempo of the Jaws theme can frighten an audience without the shark’s visual image.\n\nA third element of mise en scene is sound or even silence. Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey uses silence to illustrate the emptiness of space. Sound effects can invigorate an audience or frighten them. The beating of drum, the sound of a burning fire, cutting chainsaw, or heartbeat, whether slowing to imply death or speeding up to imply excitement are all elements of sound used to capture and convey a scene to an audience.\n\nhttp://movieclips.com/5aFn-2001-a-space-odyssey-movie-from-bone-to-satellite/\n\nIn the clip “She Wouldn’t Even Harm a Fly” from the movie Psycho, we see elements of mise en scene in the forms of lighting, camera angles, focus, sound, and physical human reactions.\n\nhttp://movieclips.com/S7DR-psycho-movie-she-wouldnt-even-harm-a-fly/\n\nThe scenes are blatantly quiet. Words are only spoken when absolutely necessary. No background noises are heard except those the movements of the actors in the scene. Sound is one of the least used elements in the clip but when it is used it is deliberate and powerful. The interactions with the actors and their surroundings are quite clear and up front. Due to the lack of bustle as one would expect during the business day, the audience may guess it is late at night.\n\nThe visual imagery tells of the police chief’s door, the district attorney’s office door, bars on the window of a locked room tell us we’re at the town hall or police station. Serious business is happening.\n\nNot only does the scene speak through inanimate objects, it speaks through the body language of the actors.\n\nThe chief’s appearance is that of an older and distinguished professional as are the appearances of all the men in the chief’s office. These are important people with erect statures. The two oldest men sit while a third, younger man is seen standing.\n\nThe chief is an authority figure but yet he looks to a younger man standing by his desk for permission before responding to the deputy’s request. The younger man is unknown to us yet but affirms the request which the chief repeats. There’s obviously a chain of command several layers deep in this room. The fourth man is unidentified and remains silent but sits just to the side of the chief. He’s older than both men around the desk but carries an air about him judging from his coifed hair and good suit.\n\nThe deputy exudes power as he exits silently and walks past three men in the hall which he directs with a finger gesture and a nod.\n\nAs the camera follows the deputy we can make out the district attorney’s office on the far office door. This is the younger man in the chief’s office. The third, distinguished gentleman seated beside the chief is inevitable the district attorney himself.\n\nThe walking deputy stops short of the attorney’s office and turns to a silent officer guarding a locked door. The guard unlocks and opens the door without a word. All members shown seem to have a good understanding of what is taking place. They need not ask questions amongst themselves. They operate silently and professionally. The deputy enters the locked room while the guard keeps a vigilant watch, peering in the room, back to the hall and repeating his scanning. The guard is on the lookout for something.\n\nIf the officers in the clip were joking and less serious, they audience may have regarded them with less authority and conviction as to the seriousness of the situation. Instead, the silence is a dialogue spoken by the officers attesting to the seriousness of the situation. A total lack of sound in this clip would not completely destroy the clip due to the strong body language of the actors. The actors presence and orientation in the scenes is strong and obvious.\n\nThe most frightening sound effect used in this scene is the clinking of a chain as it pulls a submerged car from a swamp. No other sounds are heard, not the gurgling of the car, the tow trucks engine, or the mechanic operating it. The quite is eerie. The audience knows that something horrific lies in the submerged car.\n\nReferences\n\nGoodykoontz, B. (2014). Film: From watching to seeing . San Diego : Bridgepoint Education, Inc.\n\nHitchcock, A.

Specific to this conversation is the lighting used for Mise en Scene.\n\nThe film is largely shot in natural lighting to convince the viewer of the reality of the setting and the possibility that such a monster exists. The town is bright and sunny and very welcoming. It looks like an oceanside paradise.\n\nHowever Spielberg creates a paradox with natural lighting that somehow reinforces the fear of the viewers. While the sun is out and the air is clear, we still can’t see all that lurks below us. Jaws was very dependent on daylight for most of the outdoors scenes. Spielberg had to contend with this challenge to project the villain. Whether intentional or not, the change from sunny days to overcast greys mimics the ever-growing presence of the shark.\n\nBigger Boat\n\nLast Battle\n\nHigh-key lighting is not used in the film. High-key lighting is bright and all encompassing (imagine Heaven), with few shadows or contrast (Goodykoontz, 2014, Ch. 6.4).\n\nConversely, low-key lighting is dark and uses heavy shadows and contrasts to intensify scenes, especially in horror or mystery films (Goodykoontz, 2014, Ch. 6.4). Spielberg used low-key when able to dramatize scenes as in the portrayal of the main characters strife after being fired as sheriff and thusly removed from saving the people in the town from the menacing shark. Low-key lighting is also used in the heros’ search for the shark.\n\nSearching\n\nJaws uses lighting and other tools of Mise en Scene to dramatize scenes and even in the against the traditional uses, where limited by natural causes. Like the shark’s theme, Spielberg’s scenes are daunting and symbolically dark (Biancorosso, 2010).\n\nReferences\n\nBIANCOROSSO, G. (2010). T he S hark in the M usic.

Directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Roy Scheider as Brody, Richard Dreyfuss as Hooper, Robert Shaw as Quint, and Lorraine Gary as Ellen Brody. Released in 1975.\n\nJaws is a story of an abnormally large and aggressive Great White shark that terrorizes the people of a small seaside town. Awkwardly paired trio must dispense of the shark to save the people and the town that depends on its beaches for tourism.\n\nPeople and animals begin to disappear to the bewilderment of the towns citizens. Upon the discovery of the menacing shark as the cause, the townspeople demand that the local sheriff played by Roy Scheider take care of it before the summer tourism is scared away thus decimating the town’s revenue. Leading this campaign is the town’s mayor who works to calm the situation and restore normality and the tourism business, thusly saving the town. Despite the danger, the mayor pleads that all is well and encourages swimming and water activity even though the shark is still lurking in the waters.The mayor’s actions increase the risk to the tourists thus expediting the sheriff to take action and hunt down the shark with an old salty seaman played by Robert Shaw. The two are paired with a quirky biologist specializing in sharks played by Richard Dreyfuss.\n\nAs the trio pursues the shark their characters develop through conversation and intermittent battles with the shark. Their battles take toll on the men more than the unstoppable shark. The seaman is eaten, the biologist disappears, and the sheriff is near drowning as the shark is finally killed.\n\nThe movie is filled with the lives of the townspeople as they react to the existence of the shark. There is no room for flashbacks in this chronological tale. The suspense is built through scenes of shark attacks and consistent submissions to danger as people continue to enter the water not knowing of the shark attacks that have been hushed by the mayor. We learn that our hero, the sheriff can’t swim only after boarding a boat to find lost boaters, two of which are his sons.\n\nAny use of non-linear knowledge or foreshadowing may distract from the suspense for the viewer. As the shark continues to attack and elude its pursuers, we become to believe it is unstoppable. The inabilities of the hero create additional suspense as the viewer must question his ability to stop the horror. The movie or score is particularly dramatic as it creates a sense of suspense with its ascending tempo and non contemporary instruments. The music alerts us to the shark whereas it is otherwise undetectable (Biancorosso, 2010, p.1).\n\nIf we ask ourselves the Truth Test (Goodykoontz, 2014, Ch. 1.2), we see that Jaws asked us to think before swimming and the director did a great job at this. I can’t think of a film more terrifying that this was. The film took a naturally happy occurrence of beach going and created absolute terror.\n\nReferences\n\nBIANCOROSSO, G. (2010).
