        "text": "Hiya guys,\n\nI wanted to start a thread about unknown actors who have played characters in movies and tv shows we've all seen without realizing they were played by the same guy or gal...\n\nFor example...\n\nTexas born actor William Hootkins we all know as Eaton in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' not only played legendary X-Wing pilot Porkins (Red Six) in 'Star Wars: A New Hope', but also the corrupt cop Eckhardt in Tim Burton's 'Batman'\n\nOf course, most of you will know that...\n\nHere are some you probably don't know...\n\nActor Paul Brooke , who played Malakili the Rancor keeper in 'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi' was also the annoyed library visitor who is confronted with Rowan Atkinson's insanity in the Mr. Bean episode 'The Library'\n\nAnd finally this one... In fact I only realized these two characters were played by one and the same actor yesterday as I was watching an episode of Fawlty Towers.\n\nRemember the 'Gourmet Night' episode were Kurt, the hotel's chef drank himself completely sloshed because Manuel (who is from Barcelona) didn't answer his love?\n\nHere's a little youtube sort of awkward remix clip from that scene...\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWVYfbJrlQ0\n\nNow check out this little scene from Tim Burton's 'Batman', in which Gotham's cheapest surgeon is shocked by Jack Napier's reaction to his work...\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PUrdJZB5BA\n\nYep. They're the same guy. The Istanbul born actor Steve Plytas.\n\nI just thought it was funny that even though we've seen characters so many times on screen, we sometimes fail to realize they were played by the same guy...\n\nAny other examples from anyone?\n\nHere's another one...\n\nOnly difference is that it's not a human actor...\n\nI know a lot of you guys know both Indy and Rambo rode the same horse, but I'm sure a lot of the younger fans don't.\n\nPS: I read that at one point in the ten year development hell of Tim Burton's 'Batman', there was a sequence in the screenplay where Batman pursued the Joker on horseback...\n\nI bet that when that scene would've made it the final film, they would have used this horse"
