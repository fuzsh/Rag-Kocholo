        "text": "1978\n\nCity Locations\n\nNavarre Beach, Florida; Marthaâs Vineyard, Massachusetts\n\nLocation Types\n\nBeach/Oceanview, Cape Cod, Naturescapes, Clubs/bars\n\nLocation Styles\n\nBeach house, Beachfront, Dilapidated/Neglected, Luxury Hotel\n\nAbout Jaws 2\n\nJaws 2 is the follow-up to Steven Spielbergâs critically-acclaimed 1975 film Jaws. Jeannot Szwarc did the honors of directing the second installment written by Howard Sackler and Carl Gottlieb. Rod Scheider starred in the sequel as Chief Martin Brody alongside Murray Hamilton and Lorraine Gary who reprised the roles of Mayor Larry Vaughn and Ellen Brody respectively.\n\nSpoilers ahead! The plot follows Chief Brody, four years after the first film, as he investigates a series of disappearances and other strange incidents happening around the fictional Amity Island. Like the first film, itâs soon revealed that a great white shark is at the center of it.\n\nAs Boyd gets deeper into unraveling the case of two missing divers, he finds a camera on the scene. After processing the film, he realizes that the pair had a photo shoot encounter with a familiar toothy menace. Boyd presents his findings to the local council but Mayor Vaughn doesnât seem to have taken the townâs previous attacks as a learning curve.\n\nLed by Mike (Mark Gruner), Boydâs son, Jaws 2 focuses more on the younger characters and their close encounters with the great white. Mike and a group of friends set off in sailboats not knowing about the imminent dangers.\n\nThe great white attacks one of the boats and it sets off a chain reaction that sees most of the water vessels capsize. Just like in the first movie, Brody hunts the shark down and the movie ends with the great white electrocuted to death.\n\nâBack in the Water,â borrowed from one of the filmâs famous lines, is a 2022 documentary in the works. The production revisits the Panhandle in Florida and recounts how the second Jaws installment affected the townâs residents. Instead of shining a spotlight on the filming process, the documentary tells stories about the production from the locals' perspectives.\n\nJaws 2 Locations\n\nThe production team returned to Marthaâs Vineyard for the Jaws 2 production process. Various locations along the Emerald Coast also received some screen time. Given that the second installment suffered from production delays, much like the first movie, Navarre Beach served as the filming location for most of the beach scenes.\n\nThe Grapevine, a local paper, wrote âThe Jaws people are back among usâ¦more organized and more moneyed.â Most residents welcomed the production team, and a number even appeared in the film as extras.\n\nHowever, other Panhandle natives werenât too happy with the film crewâs intrusion. Only one drugstore reportedly agreed to board up its windows to create the moody aesthetic that Hancock wanted. Soon enough, there were âUniversal Go-Homeâ T-shirts in circulation, and the production faced a myriad of other challenges. Production proceeded as expected, in the end, and thatâs why the classic thriller exists.\n\nHere is a run-through of some of the best scenes in Jaws 2 and details about their real-life filming locations.\n\nThe movie opens with two divers, Bert and Ernie, and one points out to the other âdown there.â They dive down deeper to explore a sunken fishermanâs boat, and as they move through the cabins, a dim, threatening shape approaches.\n\nWe then see several flashes in the distance before the scene ends with Ernieâs camera gently floating toward the beach. The next scene shows Chief Brody arriving at the beach in his blue-and-white jeep.\n\nNavarre Beach, located off Route 98, served as the setting for those particular scenes and most of the filmâs other exterior shots. The filmmakers chose the area between Destin and Fort Walton Beach simply because of the warm, pleasant climate and the depth of the water. The waters in the area were also deep enough to plausibly have sharks circling around the platform set up in the area. Tucked away in Northwest Florida, Navarre Beach offers some solitude away from the regularly packed beaches. While visiting the Jaws 2 location, you might as well learn how to surf, enjoy the night glow kayak paddling sessions, or go dolphin-watching aboard a speed boat.\n\nSearch Filming Locations\n\nMike hangs out with his group of friends, amongst them Brooke, Jackie, Timmy, Andy, Ed, and Tina, at a pinball arcade. Thatâs where they discuss their plans to go on a sailing picnic. As the plans for their sailing trip take shape, Jackie asks two critical questions. âWhoâs bringing the wine? And who got a quarter for the box?â\n\nThe interior scenes depicting the teens hanging out and playing pinball were shot at the Hogâs Breath Saloon formerly located on Okaloosa Island. The restaurant/bar was relocated and set up at 541 Harbor Boulevard, Destin because its original location was flagged as a hurricane-prone area. Located between Destin and Fort Walton Beach, as of 2005, the original filming location of Jaws 2 in Okaloosa Island stood in a derelict state. The relocated joint also closed shop in 2020, and through their Facebook page, they explained that they hoped to be back in service in due time.\n\nLocate Video Shoot Locations\n\nBrody is Amityâs Chief of Police whose glorified days as the hero from the first film have since waned as the second movie begins. His relentless pursuit of the great white earns him the boot, and he returns home in a drunken stupor.\n\nExplaining everything to his wife, he says âFired. Canned. Out of my fanny. The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.â\n\nA stunning abode at 265 East Chop Drive, Vineyard Haven stood in for Brodyâs charming Oceanside residence. In 2002, the house went through a remodeling process and the shingled residence that now stands on the lot barely resembles the screen location.\n\nThe Amity Police Department is another location that was filmed in Massachusetts, to be precise 33 North Summer Street, Edgartown. They dressed up the Marthaâs Vineyard home for those scenes, and the location also doubled up as one of the production offices.\n\nOn South Water Street, youâll find a residential building where the filmmakers had shot the Amity Gazette scenes. Edgartown served as the setting of various other Jaws franchise locations including Amity Hardware (55 Main Street), Amity Town Hall (70 Main Street), and Port Hunter, which is a seafood restaurant at 55 Main Street, lent its establishment for the interior scenes of the Amity Hardware.\n\nFrom Oak Bluffs, the Line 13 or Line 9 bus will get you to the Jaws 2 filming location on East Chop Drive.\n\nBoston Video Shoot Locations Exploration\n\nIn the first few minutes of the film, thereâs a scene where Chief Brody enters The Holidome where a grand opening ball is in full swing. He takes his place amongst other dignitaries and Mayor Vaughn, who is presiding over the ceremony, starts speaking.\n\nSome of the words of his speech somewhat described what was to come as the movie progressed. âWe're happy once again to be in the center of things, where the action is...â\n\nThe Holiday Inn âHolidomeâ at Navarre served as the filmâs headquarters. Production offices were set up on the ground floor, and the crew remodeled some of the Gulf-front suites for Scheider and David Brown. Universal rented out 100 Holidome rooms for a reported $1 million.\n\nSadly, the Holiday Inn no longer exists after getting destroyed in the wake of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. If you do find yourself at Navarre Beach, the fishing pier is worth checking out to enjoy the sunsets, turtle-watching, or go fishing. Also plan a stopover at the Navarre Beach Marine park located in Santa Rosa.\n\nFilm Shoot Locations Directory\n\nLocated in Massachusetts, Marthaâs Vineyard provided the overall setting for the fictional Amity resort. The filmmakers chose the location because they wanted an island that could conjure up an eerily empty feel.\n\nThe popular summer destination lent locations throughout Katama, Harthaven, and Mayhew Lane to the Jaws 2 production. Other outdoor scenes were filmed around the town of Destin, Florida. One of the scenes filmed at Marthaâs Vineyard is when Grace Witherspoon witnesses a shark-related tragedy from her porch. Deputy Jeff Hendricks (Jeffrey Kramer) responds to the call she places in to report the incident.\n\nTalking to Brody through a walkie-talkie he explains that he didnât find anyone on-site, and Brody who is on shore interviews some witnesses. One of them describes the incident as an explosion. âOne minute they were having a wonderful time, the next, bang!â\n\nThereâs plenty to do around Marthaâs Vineyard, from visiting the beaches to exploring the Oak Bluffs Campgrounds. Hop onto the Line 7 or Line 9 bus to explore the various locations around Marthaâs Vineyard.\n\nBoston Film Shoot Locations Finder\n\nYou are certainly equipped with enough knowledge about the Jaws 2 locations, and that should help you map out your âJaws-inspiredâ tour. Even more fascinating are the tidbits about the film that, looking back now, made the movie even more epic.\n\nThe crew used an island set fabricated on a barge and docked it at the Shalimar Yacht Basin to stand in for Cable Junction. Much like in the first film, it was one of the Jaws 2 film sets that came with several challenges. On one occasion, it broke off from its anchorage and Szwarc received a call telling him that the floating set was drifting off.\n\nThe teen actors had a close call when real hammerhead sharks circled them. Filming from a distance, the crew didnât realize that the young stars were in real distress because the scene called for them to behave in such a manner. One proprietor reportedly sold Universal boats and boating equipment worth $40,000."
