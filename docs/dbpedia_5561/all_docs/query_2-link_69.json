        "text": "About the Mystic Film Festival\n\nMystic Film Festival is an annual event showcasing independent feature-length and short-form narrative films and documentaries from around the world. Our festival was created by local filmmakers and artists to nurture regional talent, to promote works made in Connecticut and New England, and to bring unique films to our community. The festival unites a diverse group of filmmakers and audiences to explore ideas, discuss the filmmaking process, and celebrate creativity. Through engaging community and industry events, panels and workshops, and film screenings by acclaimed and up-and-coming talent, the festival is a special experience for filmmakers and audiences alike.\n\nNow celebrating its seventh year, the festival will take place September 19th to September 22nd, 2024 at venues in Mystic, Connecticut and Westerly, Rhode Island. Our cornerstone venue is Mystic Luxury Cinemas in Olde Mistick Village. Weâ€™ll open with a local premiere and close the festival with an awards event where the best film in each category is recognized.\n\nOur screenplay competition, now in its fifth year, is expanding relationships with key partners in the screenwriting industry and has expanded its categories to include narrative short screenplays, episodic, and stage plays. The top winners of the 2024 screenplay competition will be announced at the awards ceremony on September 22nd, 2024."
