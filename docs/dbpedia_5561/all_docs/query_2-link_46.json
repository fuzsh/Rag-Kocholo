        "text": "One of makeup artist Howard Berger's earliest jobs was on George A. Romero's 1985 zombie movie, Day of the Dead. It was an auspicious start indicative of the sort of work that would come to define his career, going on to do special effects makeup on such films as Drag Me to Hell, Grindhouse, and Jennifer's Body, and becoming a frequent collaborator of Sam Raimi and Quentin Tarantino.\n\n\"From the time I was old enough to sit in a theater and watch the flicker of those magical imagines on the big screen, I was hooked as a lifelong cinephile,\" says Berger. \"My father worked in the industry as a post-production sound editor. He loved movies with all his heart, which then bled into my veins. I think he wanted me to follow in his footsteps, but he made the mistake of showing me the classic Universal Monster films and that was it.\"\n\n\"For the next several years I was convinced I were those monsters,\" he recalls. \"I knocked out my front teeth by accident at 6 years old, so I donned a big black cape and ran through the neighborhood with just my canines terrorizing all the other kids. I knew that someone made these monsters and my father explained makeup artists did and at that point I knew that would be my destiny.\"\n\nIn 2006, Berger won the Oscar for Best Makeup for his work on The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, sharing the award with Tami Lane. He was nominated again in 2013 for Hitchcock, with Peter Montagna and Martin Samuel.\n\nBerger is also the author of Masters of Make-Up Effects: A Century of Practical Magic, which he wrote with Marshall Julius and which features a foreword from Guillermo del Toro. The book is a deep dive into the art form, full of untold stories and never-before-seen photos of some of the most iconic makeup effects of all time. (If you want to meet Berger in person, head to the Academy Museum on Sept. 25 for a special book signing of Masters of Make-Up Effects. Click here for more information.)\n\n\"Though I am still monster obsessed, I am in love with the movies, and so many genres inspire me,\" Berger says. Below, he shares with A.frame the five films that continue to influence him."
