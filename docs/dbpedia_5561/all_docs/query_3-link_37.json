        "text": "The rest, as they say, is history. Spielberg has since been forgiven for going over budget and over schedule; likely because the film’s $470 million in global returns was more than enough to justify the $9 million in costs. And certainly, Spielberg’s creative genius and touch for suspense drove this masterpiece of a story. But perhaps the production team also tapped into a workstyle that best allowed for a creative genius to shine.\n\nWhen beginning a project, traditional project management methods call for thorough system design and preparation. Whether it was youthful ignorance or creative genius, Spielberg began filming Jawswith a completely unfinished script.\n\nCarl Gottlieb, brought in for the rewrite, was often rewriting the script and finishing scenes late into the evening to be ready for filming the next day. Other writers and actors were brought in to assist, with stories of actors themselves contributing and improvising key lines. “We’re gonna need a bigger boat”, arguably the most famous line in the movie, was written on the spot by the actor, Roy Schneider.\n\nNon-software project management methods require perfect scripting of the finished product at kickoff. After all, in manufacturing and construction style projects emerging from the Industrial Age, one could not put up drywall without framing the house. However, the Jawsproduction team’s assignment and the challenges of today’s age are different.\n\n“I remember being on the set for the first shark test, and it simply sank”, said producer David Brown. “Everything that could go wrong with the shark, went wrong.” Often, projects run into great adversity. Thankfully, this team’s leadership allowed for adaptability.\n\nTraditional Waterfall project management prevents returning to a previous phase as challenges arise; therefore, the only way to revisit a phase is to start the entire process over from the beginning. Agile project management welcomes change, and backlogs leave room for unexpected tasks and adjustments. Such a structure allows team members to focus time and energy on matters vital to creating value for the project and the achievement of a final goal.\n\nTraditional project management requires a certain amount of handholding and preparation before launching a new business or product. Part of Spielberg’s genius was his perfectionism and determination to “shoot the film in the Atlantic Ocean not the North Hollywood Tank”.\n\nNothing about this process was easy. Previously, film had not been shot in the ocean due to the effects of Mother Nature, and the limited capability of film equipment in the 1970s. Among other problems, the mechanical shark actually deteriorated in the saltwater. It was best described by one cast member saying, “most of the hydraulic valves on the shark were powered by electric solenoids… when they dumped it in the water, everything fried”.\n\nIn order to achieve maximum success, businesses and products must be tested in the ocean, not the North Hollywood Tank. There is truly no substitute for the live feedback and discovery that takes place in the real environment. Rooted in the core of Agile is flexibility, adaptability, and an iterative approach to the development processes during live releases.\n\n‘In order to achieve maximum success, businesses and products must be tested in the ocean, not the North Hollywood Tank’\n\nAlthough ‘shooting in the ocean’ may prove extremely complicated and require multiple adaptations and iterations, it ultimately provides for great dividends in the final product. Businesses and products receive vital feedback in an iterative environment that requires developers to craft toward perfection."
