        "text": "Across 125 years, the seafaring song remains the same. The drunken sailors and harpooners aboard the Pequod in Herman Melville’s “Moby-Dick” begin singing one night, and the song should resonate with those who know the disparate trio of hunters aboard the Orca in the film “Jaws”: “Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies …”\n\nAbout 300 pages later in “Moby-Dick,” a captain and his surgeon are discussing a wound that robbed the captain of his arm. The surgeon then addresses his own wound. “Do you see this dent, sir?” he asks and removes his hat and brushes aside his hair.\n\nThose who know “Jaws” — Steven Spielberg’s 1975 masterpiece — likely felt some literary echo there, and heard Robert Shaw’s voice as Quint: “Hey, Hoop, you wanna feel something permanent? Just put your hand underneath my cap.”\n\n“Hollywood studio movies at the time were not particularly tuned into culture,” says Carl Gottlieb, co-writer of “Jaws.” “So those of us working on the movie would say to friends, hoping they’d get the references: ‘It’s like ‘Moby-Dick’ with ‘An Enemy of the People.’”\n\nBecause of its financial success and cultural ubiquity, “Jaws” has for decades been miscategorized as the mother shark of summer blockbuster films. But a viewing without the popcorn reveals the film as an allegory for its age. Like “Moby-Dick,” the clarity of the film’s themes and the opacity of its allegory have given it resonance years after it entered the world.\n\nSo we find ourselves amid the panic of a pandemic with two stories separated by more than a century. Both are about hunts for sea creatures. Both stories present madness and pursuit, science and mythology, safety and risk, common good and greed, and both suggest cooperation within a community as the sole method of thwarting a largely unseen and deadly threat.\n\n“Jaws” has never gone away. Forty-five years after its release, it remains a defining piece of American cinema. Gottlieb points out that some of the success is attributable to good timing. “There were a lot of portraits made in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, masterpieces, but there’s only one ‘Mona Lisa,’” he says. “But the reason something becomes iconic to a global audience is that individuals are able to find something in it relevant to their experience. With popular art, television and movies, time and customs can be cruel in terms of political consciousness. You hope that sort of thing evolves and society moves forward. But that’s what you’re trying for when you’re writing a movie. To make something someone finds relevant to their experience.”\n\nDreyfuss as Fauci?\n\n“Jaws” resurfaces each summer because its action is tied to July 4, when Amity Island officially sees its tourist season begin. This summer the film has been more culturally present because of the coronavirus pandemic. Amity’s business-first mayor, Larry Vaughn (played with oily ease by the late, great Murray Hamilton), advocates for keeping beaches open despite a spate of shark attacks.\n\nHamilton’s mayor has become a meme and source of comic writing, a huckster in ostentatious sports coats who stood in for elected officials reluctant to make admittedly difficult decisions to emphasize economy over health. McSweeney’s published a 10-quote quiz under the headline “Who said it: Donald Trump or Larry Vaughn?” One meme juxtaposed the president next to a cresting coronavirus graph that eerily echoed an image from “Jaws,” in which a graffiti shark fin can be seen over Vaughn’s shoulder.\n\nVaughn is a more crooked character in Peter Benchley’s book. Hamilton brings to Vaughn a delicate touch: He’s immersed in cognitive dissonance, and thus slow to recognize a legitimate threat. But, he tells Chief Brody (Roy Scheider), “My kids were on that beach, too.” When the human cost becomes too great, he makes the financial sacrifice in hopes of saving people rather than summer tourism.\n\nOthers in Amity respond with less nuance and progress.\n\nWhen a shark is caught, not the shark, another of our heroes, oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) is skeptical. His nebbishy appearance and scholarly demeanor trigger a group of fishermen. “What’s this bite-radius crap?” one says. “I’m gonna stuff your friggin’ head in there and find out if he’s a man-eater.”\n\nDreyfuss can go ahead and get fitted for his Fauci hairpiece.\n\nBut I’d rather not get snared in the divisions that lend “Jaws” an early tension. After noticing the little nods in the film to “Moby-Dick,” I read Peter Benchley’s 1974 novel, “Jaws,” looking for the root of this thematic connection that spanned nearly 125 years.\n\nI didn’t find it. Reading the book underscored just how much Spielberg and Gottlieb transformed the story. Benchley’s book includes some of the class conflict of the film (also a theme in Melville’s novel). Its politics, though, are sharper, with actions and characters designed as allegory for Richard Nixon and Watergate. But in this sense, “Jaws” is a book locked in its era.\n\nWhere the stories diverge\n\nSpielberg and Gottlieb saw something else in the story that conveyed their moment in time, 1975, as a transitional period between eras.\n\n“What we think of as ‘the ’60s’ was actually 1968 into 1975,” Gottlieb says. “The war in Vietnam, the youth rebellion, the cultural revolution. Those changes coupled with our exit from Vietnam in 1975 marked the end of an era. ‘Jaws’ was made at the tail end of that period.”\n\nFor a film that leaves a few swimmers — and one dog — dead, “Jaws” aspires to a resilient hopefulness. Benchley’s novel puts three men — Quint, Hooper and Brody — on a boat. Two of the three die, and the shark swims away.\n\nGottlieb and Spielberg found a different story on that boat. About 50 pages of a 310-page book is dedicated to the men and their hunt. “Jaws,” the film, truly begins when they board the Orca.\n\nThe film’s most famous and repeated line is often misquoted: “We’re going to need a bigger boat.” Brody actually says, “You’re going to need a bigger boat,” underscoring a division between him, Quint and Hooper despite their shared task and close proximity.\n\n“If the movie has any kind of lesson it’s that … cooperation,” Gottlieb says. “The three guys are a kind of three-headed hero. You have the Aristotelian creature of the mind, Hooper; the Dionysian character of impulse and instinct, Quint; and you have Everyman in Scheider, who mediates between two opposites. They have to strike a balance to persevere.”\n\nThe famed scene in which the three men connect — sharing scars followed by Shaw’s ghostly recounting of the disaster of the USS Indianapolis — is crucial to “Jaws,” and non-existent in the novel.\n\nGottlieb acknowledges that he’s seen the current “Jaws” memes and references. And he appears to find the humor in them while also expressing some frustration that the worst inclinations of characters from a 45-year-old film continue to ripple through our culture. He calls the pandemic “an unprecedented event that will change the trajectory of history.”\n\nAn enormous amount of loss and destruction concludes “Moby-Dick.” And here, Benchley’s book and Melville’s appear connected. Battle has been done with the threat, lives have been lost, and the sea creature then disappears back into the deep. As far as the reader knows, only Ishmael, the novel’s narrator, escapes, floating on a coffin. Benchley’s Brody kicks alone toward shore.\n\nBut Spielberg’s “Jaws” seeks hope after the tumult. Brody vanquishes the shark, and he and Hooper kick their way to shore on some barrels from the Orca.\n\n“The shark is dead, two of our three guys are alive, and the tourists can come back to the beach,” Gottlieb says. “By August, all the tourists will be back.”\n\nThat distinction between Spielberg’s movie and Melville’s novel would have been further underscored by a scene that was cut from the film.\n\n“We had a shot at one point of Quint coming out of a movie theater somewhere on Martha’s Vineyard where they were showing ‘Moby-Dick,’” Gottlieb says. “He walked out of the theater, laughing. But we couldn’t get permission to use the poster and Gregory Peck’s image. So it was one of those great moments that never happened on screen.”\n\nandrew.dansby@chron.com"
