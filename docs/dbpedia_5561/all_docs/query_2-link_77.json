        "text": "In Richard Dreyfuss’s opinion, there’s more to fix in The Shark Is Broken than the titular animal. The Oscar winner says his feelings were hurt by the Broadway play, which chronicles the behind-the-scenes relationship between Jaws stars Robert Shaw, Roy Scheider, and Dreyfuss during the making of Steven Spielberg’s epic 1975 blockbuster. “I went to see it, to see if it really was gonna hurt,” he says. “And it did.”\n\nDreyfuss, who starred as marine biologist Matt Hooper in Jaws, recently caught a performance of The Shark Is Broken, cowritten by and starring Ian Shaw—son of Dreyfuss’s Jaws costar Robert Shaw, who played salty seafarer and eccentric shark hunter Quint. Ian used his late father’s diary as reference while he and Joseph Nixon were cowriting the play, which first premiered at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe before opening on Broadway at the John Golden Theatre on August 10. Its final performance is scheduled for November 19.\n\nAfter the performance he saw, Dreyfuss posed for pictures with the show’s three-person cast: Ian Shaw (playing his father), Colin Donnell (playing Scheider), and Tony nominee Alex Brightman (portraying Dreyfuss). But though he was smiling in the photos, Dreyfuss says he was really feeling anything but pleased.\n\n“It was pretty awful,” Dreyfuss says of his experience watching the play. “Ian [Shaw]—who has more than any right to write whatever he wants—never called me and said, ‘Give me some background.’ Or, ‘Give me your take on this and this.’ And they just decided to make my character a big jerk.”\n\nThe central conflict of the play involves a supposed feud between Robert Shaw, a renowned English stage actor and alcoholic in his late 40s, and Dreyfuss, who’s portrayed as a neurotic, fame-obsessed, comically insecure actor in his 20s, just starting his career. But in Dreyfuss’s opinion, he and the veteran actor never fought. Dreyfuss says that while the late Shaw “had my number,” it was a “great, great honor” to work with him, adding that the two had “a very incredible relationship” that “was all for the good.”\n\nThat’s not to say the two didn’t mess with each other from time to time during the making of Jaws. “There were people on the crew who said, ‘What’s this Richard Dreyfuss–Robert Shaw show that’s going on here?’” Dreyfuss says. “When we were surrounded by lots of other people, Robert would take digs at me, and I would take a dig at him. But that was only to make the hours go better, faster. We didn’t take any of that seriously.”\n\nThe only time things escalated from playful ribbing, Dreyfuss says, was when Dreyfuss threw a glass of Shaw’s bourbon overboard. In retaliation, he soaked Dreyfuss with a hose, “almost drowning me in the water.” “That was the only day I lost my sense of humor,” says Dreyfuss. But one bad day on set, he adds, does not a feud make. “That was not a feud. A feud went on forever. We never had any bad feeling between us, ever.” (Dreyfuss doesn’t take issue, however, with the way the show portrays Shaw’s alcoholism, which is heavily depicted: “Robert was an English actor, and English actors look upon alcohol in a different way than we do.”)\n\n“The problem is that they made my character the fool,” continues Dreyfuss. “They didn’t do that to Roy, and they didn’t do that to Robert. And that hurt because it wasn’t true.”\n\nStories of a feud between Shaw and Dreyfuss on the set of Jaws have been persistent for more than a decade, to Dreyfuss’s chagrin. Surprisingly, Dreyfuss traces the origin of the story back to Spielberg and Jaws co-screenwriter Carl Gottlieb. “Thirty years after the film is over, I start to hear this thing about a feud,” Dreyfuss says. “I didn’t pay too much attention.” But while Dreyfuss still claims to be friends with Gottlieb and Spielberg, he’s also still upset about what he perceives as their role in spreading the story about his relationship with Shaw. (Vanity Fair has reached out to Spielberg for comment, but was unable to contact Gottlieb at press time.)\n\n“I don’t think they just gave it any thought that it would hurt me, and it did,” says Dreyfuss. “I have to say that Carl and Steven knew better, knew that there was no feud. There was an ongoing kind of humor between us. If you only saw us on the set, then you might think that there was something—a feud that was going on—but it was never real. Never. And I hold that against Carl and Steven.”\n\n“I have enormous respect for Steven’s talent as a director,” Dreyfuss adds. “I guess I don’t have as much for his talent as a friend.”\n\nObjections aside, Dreyfuss knows that making Jaws was a singular experience—especially when comparing the finished product to the films of today. “It’s called garbage,” says Dreyfuss. “It’s garbage. It’s all sequels of sequels of sequels, and about cartoon heroes and comic book heroes that we don’t care about. They don’t want to make films that make you think, and we did. That generation of kids who became the generation of the ’70s, we had greater ambition than the people making films now.”\n\nWhile Dreyfuss claims that the supposed tension between himself and Shaw is overblown in the play, he admits that some moments from The Shark Is Broken—like a scene in which Shaw bets Dreyfuss that he can’t do five push-ups—are drawn from true events. Others—like a scene in which Dreyfuss has a full-blown panic attack—are completely fabricated, he says. Overall, in Dreyfuss’s opinion, The Shark Is Broken is “as false a picture as I can possibly imagine.”\n\nDreyfuss is choosing to speak out in part because he’s the only one of the film’s three stars who’s still alive. “Robert had died very soon after the film was over, and Roy died a few years later. I was the only one who could speak for us, how it really was.” For Dreyfuss, at least, filming Jaws “was a great experience. It was a great experience not only during the shoot, but for 30 years afterwards. It didn’t turn sour at all until this feud bullshit started to be gossiped about.” And even that doesn’t hurt the real experience, he says. “It just kind of makes a perfect thing slightly spoiled.”"
