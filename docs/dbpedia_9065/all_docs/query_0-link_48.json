We believe this is fair because supply can often be unreliable - availability and release dates frequently change without notice. Pre-order with Flying Nun and you can cancel any time prior to the product arriving at our store.\n\nFlying Nun only make products available to purchase on our website when they are actually physically held at the store (except pre-orders). Vinyl availability from all local and international suppliers changes on a daily/hourly basis. Therefore, it is not possible to guarantee an online order for many items not currently held in stock.\n\nFlying Nun offers free shipping in Aotearoa New Zealand on orders over $80. We have record stores in both Auckland and Wellington and will ship your record from whichever store is nearest. We aim to pack send your order next business day. Pick ups are also available from both stores."
