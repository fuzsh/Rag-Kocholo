        "text": "Naughty by Nature wants to get “back to the basics” on its 25th anniversary tour.\n\nThat’s according to Vin Rock, one-third of the seminal hip-hop group that’s released seven studio albums in its career. The anniversary tour stops at Wooly’s in Des Moines’ East Village on Feb. 16.\n\n“Twenty-five years is definitely an accomplishment,” Rock said. “(We wanted to) just get on a tour bus and tour the country.”\n\nThe group known for Grammy Award-winning work like the 1996 record “Poverty’s Paradise” and hit singles like “Hip Hop Hooray” and “O.P.P.” comes to Des Moines celebrating the past, but with eyes on the future.\n\nThere are plans for both a documentary and new music in 2016, Rock said. The documentary will feature footage scaling the group’s multi-decade career, including this winter’s anniversary tour.\n\n“People really know Naughty by Nature as performers and recording artists,” Rock said. “People don’t really know the entire group — our back stories, where we come from and what we’re like. We really want to just open up and let people in.”\n\nIn late January, Naughty by Nature announced it will take to Kickstarter to fund the 25th anniversary record and documentary. As of Feb. 5, the group had raised over $25,000 of its $100,000 goal on the crowdfunding platform.\n\nCrowdfunding has turned into a medium for notable musicians to finance projects. The artist creates a crowdfunding page, on a site like Kickstarter, and sets different prizes for fans who decide to give different amounts of money.\n\nFor Naughty by Nature’s Kickstarter, pledging $15 gets the backer a digital download of the upcoming record and a $50 pledge provides the backer with a vinyl copy and digital download, with a bonus track, of the upcoming release. It’s worked for some in the past: Amanda Palmer raised just under $1.2 million in 2012 and TLC raised over $430,000 in 2015.\n\n“We feel like technology is the new record label,” Rock said. “We’re veteran artists, and we’ve been off of labels for years now. We don’t necessarily need a record label, these days. We have a bunch of people out there all over the world who are looking for new music (and) new experiences with us. We want to use the technology to go directly to the people.”\n\nThe group’s new music is set to be released in a series of two EPs, instead of the traditional LP format.\n\nRock said the group wants to knock out five or six songs and a few music videos for each release.\n\n“We feel that we could have given the people more content in these 25 years, but no better time than the present,” Rock said. “All three members of Naughty by Nature are focused again, just like our early years. Everyone’s rolling up their sleeves and diggin’ in.”\n\nThe tour plans to hit 28 cities in just over a month. It kicked off in North Carolina on Jan. 27.\n\nFans can expect a deep dig into the group’s discography at the show, Rock said.\n\n“We always perform songs that people (have) never heard of,” Rock said. “We’re definitely going to do that this tour.”\n\nThrough its music released in the '90s and beyond, Naughty by Nature has played a role in influencing modern hip-hop. So, who’s been on Rock’s playlist lately?\n\nKendrick Lamar and J. Cole, he said.\n\n“It’s the production and the lyrical content,” Rock said. “These guys are just straight-up lyricists. It’s a throwback to more of the origins of hip-hop.”\n\nIf you go ...\n\nWhen: 9 p.m. Feb. 16\n\nWhere: Wooly’s, 504 E. Locust St.\n\nCost: $20-$50"
