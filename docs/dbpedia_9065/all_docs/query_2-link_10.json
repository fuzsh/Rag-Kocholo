        "text": "Part of this story\n\nWatch the 2017 Red Bull BC One World Final on Red Bull TV from 10pm CEST on November 4.\n\nGrowing up in New Jersey, Naughty By Nature got into hip-hop culture at the ground floor. It was an obvious path to follow for school friends Treach, Vin Rock and DJ Kay Gee. \"We were 20 minutes from the epicentre of hip-hop,\" says Vin. \"The Bronx, New York, Manhattan\". Vin got into breakdancing, then beatboxing. \"The first person I heard was Doug E. Fresh. It sounded like he had marbles in his mouth and I was like, ‘Wait, how is he doing that?!’ It was just addictive from there. Doug E. Fresh and Buffy from The Fat Boys – they were my favourite two beatboxers at the time.\"\n\nNaughty By Nature weren't alone in any of this, of course. Hip-hop and b-boy culture took over the US in lightning-quick time, filling the vacuum left behind by inner-city poverty and limited opportunities. “Back in those days, in the '70s and '80s, a lot of the social programmes were dropping off,\" explains Vin. \"We were growing up after the riots of the '60s and a lot of the inner-cities were destroyed. So you know, when you have little or nothing, culture will always prevail and culture will always evolve. The people will create it themselves.”\n\nNaughty By Nature were one of those late '80s/early '90s hip-hop groups that won bragging rights forever. They had a string of big hits, including O.P.P., Hip Hop Hooray and Feel Me Flow, and won the first-ever Grammy for Best Rap Album in 1996 with Poverty's Paradise. After all these years, the trio are still touring their \"blue collar hip-hop” around the world.\n\nNext up, the b-boy loving trio will perform at the Red Bull BC One World Final in Amsterdam on November 4. Before then, we spoke to Vin about his musical hero – KRS-One.\n\nWatch the 2017 Red Bull BC One World Final on Red Bull TV from 10pm CEST on November 4.\n\n“KRS-One is my musical hero. Back in the day he was coined The Teacher. What I learned in school about black history was one thing, but when KRS-One made music he was the teacher and he really got in-depth about our ancestors and our own black history in America. Plus he had the ultimate skills. Just musically I loved him. The beats he did, the delivery of his rhymes, his flow and pattern.\"\n\n\"Although he was an educated rapper, he was still thuggish and rugged. The streets were mean back then. He was always positive, but he would still take you to the street level if needed. So I liked how diverse he was. I liked how many tools and weapons KRS-One had.\n\n\"When I first heard him it was on the radio. Kool DJ Red Alert was down with the BDP (Boogie Down Productions) crew and would always play KRS-One and BDP records. And as fans, we were right here in New Jersey, right across the river from New York. So we used to go to Union Square and the Latin Quarter and the Apollo Theatre to see KRS-One and BDP play. So not only did I hear him on the radio, but I got to see him live in his heyday. Those early shows were intense. Hip-hop was so new and raw, people fighting over the crown for who dominated the scene. It was a competitive atmosphere.\"\n\n“The thing about early hip-hop, it wasn't corporatised. It wasn’t mainstream back then. All you had to go on was your skill set. That’s really how we came up. We never cared about the money part of it. We just cared about being the best, you know? The best skilfully; putting on the best shows; having the best lyrics; moving the crowd the most. If you were able to do that, without having records playing on the radio or videos on TV, that was the ultimate goal. Everyone had to be original. You could not clone or imitate or act like anyone else. You had to be unique. Like KRS-One was.”\n\nRelated\n\nNaughty By Nature are on Facebook.\n\nWant to discover a world of new music?
