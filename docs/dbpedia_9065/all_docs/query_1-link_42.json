        "text": "They've created infectious' chart-topping party anthems' and unleashed gritty' grimy manifestos. They've toured the world and reigned as international superstars' but they still live right where they grew up. They've dominated the Rap' Pop and R&B charts' all the while staying true to real Hip-Hop and to themselves. Naughty By Nature are arguably Hip-Hop's finest group and unquestionably one of its most beloved.\n\nSince the top of the decade' the New Jersey based trio has enjoyed two Platinum albums' numerous Gold and Platinum singles and were the catalysts in ushering Hip-Hop culture into a new age; reaching new and diverse audiences. The group won a Grammy in 1992 for Best Rap Performance with the first single from their self-titled Platinum debut album' O.P.P.' which blew up the streets from coast to coast. They also nabbed an American Music Award for Best New Rap Group in 1991 and even more props with The Source's New Artist of the Year Award. Yet despite all the hip hop hooray' you haven't really heard Naughty By Nature until right now' as they prepare to release their long awaited Arista Records debut 19Naughty9: Nature's Fury.\n\nFeaturing the one-two verbal and lyrical punch of Vinnie and Treach' and the production wizardry of KayGee' 19Naughty9: Nature's Fury is more than just the latest CD from one of the most versatile Hip-Hop acts around. It's a statement of purpose from a veteran group that is just getting started.\n\nAfter a nearly 4 year hiatus' Naughty By Nature are rejuvenated and ready to show their fans what Hip-Hop is. \"This album is eight years down the line from our first (their 1991 eponymous debut)' but at the same time' it's brand new'\" declares Treach. \"It's like we have our chemistry and energy all in line. Nature's Fury is like our first record ever.\"\n\nIt shows. From the soulful party vibe of \"Jamboree\" (featuring Zhane) and the late-night R&B flow of \"Blu Balls\" (with KayGee's protégés Next)' to the rugged' dirty South-meets-Illtown vibe of the first single \"Live or Die\" (featuring Mystikal and Silkk The Shocker)' NBN continue to prove that they will not be limited. \"This album is across the board'\" Vinnie offers' \"from the anthems to the hard core to the meaningful songs to the sad songs.\" Other highlights include the party rockin' \"Holiday'\" \"We Could Do It\"' which boasts Big Pun' the from-the-heart tribute to the fans \"Same For Me'\" and the hard hitting underground call to arms \"Dirt All By My Lonely.\" \"We're feeling everything we're saying. We're feeling this project' and we're ready to do it all again'\" says KayGee.\n\nIf Naughty By Nature are enjoying a new lease on life' they've earned it. Since 1995's Poverty's Paradise' which earned the Grammy for Best Rap Album' NBN have grabbed the reins of their careers and their lives. After some business struggles and industry hassles' NBN have emerged stronger' more focused' and at a new label with new intensity. Vinnie proclaims' \"We've taken our destiny and put it 100 percent in our hands and in our control.\" That self determination is obvious not just in NBN's music and the way they handle themselves' but in their various and highly successful outside projects.\n\nThe mastermind behind Naughty's pop friendly but street savvy beats' KayGee has taken his expertise to a higher level. He founded and runs Divine Mill' which is distributed by Arista. Asked to explain the label's unusual name and Kay explains: \"Divine means pure' and a mill is a factory. So it's a small factory.\" Small' maybe' but large in its impact. One of Kay's first signings' Next' recorded \"Too Close.\" The track' which Kay produced' was Billboard's top selling R&B single of 1998 and Next's debut album went multi-Platinum. Kay is no newcomer when it comes to creating hits. His former label Illtown launched the careers of platinum selling duet Zhane (who are now on Divine Mill) and Kay has worked with Queen Latifah' Run DMC' Shabba Ranks and Patra. The key to Kay's success? \"Let the music and the artists speak for themselves.\"\n\nAlong with a burgeoning modeling career' lead rapper Treach has become more and more involved with acting. His film career began in 1990' when his friend' the late Tupac Shakur' helped Treach land a bit part in Juice. Acclaimed roles in Jason's Lyric' television's New York Undercover' First Time Felon (an HBO original film) and the recently shot Book of Love followed. Over the years Treach's range and his roles have expanded. He recently wrapped production in two independent films that will be out in late 1999' playing roles that go beyond the typical \"rapper in a movie\" constraints. \"A lot of casting directors just see me as being hardcore and street'\" Treach explains \"but I make sure that I play different roles each time. I don't want to be typecast.\" While music remains Treach's first love' acting excites him. \"With my acting I have to get out of my body and not be Treach. I have to be someone else and it's cool to make those transitions.\" His next role will be in HBO's prison drama' Oz.\n\nWhile Vinnie's public profile may not be as prominent' his skills have never been in doubt. In an era of the posse cut' Vinnie set the standards for the back up man: staying out of the glare of the spotlight' but providing rhymes that kept the flow going. \"My spot had to evolve and now on this album' I am much better as a MC and you can hear that' \" Vinnie says. He is also the force and brains behind Naughty Gear' NBN's line of apparel. With Naughty Gear' which is sold on the internet and at their flagship store in Newark' Naughty By Nature became the first Hip-Hop act to market their own gear and to obtain their own licensing deal. Vinnie is also working with the East Orange School district to implement a comprehensive' district-wide multi media/communications facility and training ground. Like the other members of the group' Vinnie retains close ties to his neighborhood and the people he grew up with and knows that fame means more than just having a dope ride. \"It's not just about the riches' it's got to be about what you plan to do with your life.\"\n\nFrom their nascent years as New Style' rocking Jersey talent shows to their Platinum smashes like \"O.P.P.\" and \"Hip Hop Hooray'\" from their trend setting style to their groundbreaking appeal' Naughty By Nature have redefined what Hip-Hop can be. In the process they've emerged not just as pioneers' but as true stars. At a time when \"artists\" are cooked up by a marketing department' Naughty By Nature have earned the respect of the community by working hard' keeping the faith and most importantly' coming with dope shit. Every time. Ask Naughty about 19Naughty9: Nature's Fury and they cut to the chase. \"It's been four years'\" Treach declares. \"A lot of MCs can't come back after that long and still have it be into the streetS« but we're still in the hood. We still feel it. Naughty never sold out' we just sold records.\" Something they're sure to do again with a vengeance in 19Naughty9."
