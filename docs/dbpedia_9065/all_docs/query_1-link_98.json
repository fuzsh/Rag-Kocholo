        "text": "\"An Evening With Naughty By Nature\" will include a Q&A session with the legendary musicians from Essex County.\n\nNEWARK, NJ — Legendary rappers Naughty By Nature will be appearing for an “intimate conversation” in their old stomping grounds later this month.\n\nThe platinum-selling musicians – who got their start in East Orange – will be appearing at the Grammy Museum in Newark on Tuesday, Feb. 25 at 7:30 p.m. The event is part of the museum’s “An Evening With” series, which aims to provide intimate, moderated conversations with iconic recording artists about their creative process, history, current and future projects.\n\nTickets are available for $25 online.\n\nGrammy Award-winning Naughty By Nature has a 20-year track record of creating hits and party anthems that have “become the soundtrack of our lives,” the museum writes.\n\n“Their music has smashed through mainstream barriers all while remaining true to the sound, message and grit of the hood,” event organizers say.\n\nSee related article: East Coast's 1st 'Grammy Museum' Opens In Newark (VIDEOS)\n\nThe Grammy Museum offers the following biography of the group:\n\n“Treach, Vin Rock and DJ Kay Gee keep doing what they do best: creating undeniably classic, hand- raising, life-affirming, Hip-Hop music. ‘We wouldn’t have reunited if we didn’t think we could give people that authentic Naughty feeling,’ says the group’s master lyricist Treach. Few groups in music can boast about an almost 30-year career that has been both consistent and history making. Naughty By Nature, initially called New Style, began performing at talent shows and were discovered by fellow New Jersey native and then-emerging Hip-Hop artist, Queen Latifah. Eventually signing the group to her management company Flavor Unit Management, Latifah helped them land a deal with Tommy BoyRecords. Naughty By Nature’s self-titled debut album was released in 1991 and quickly assaulted the music charts with the instant classic #1 hit ‘O.P.P.’ The group quickly became crossover stars, while maintaining their ghetto sensibility. To date, their success and longevity as a hip-hop group has been unparalleled. The trio went on to produce their follow-up albums that have become part of America’s hip-hop legacy: 19 Naughty III (1993), Poverty’s Paradise (1995) and Nature’s Fury (1999). Inevitably, a break-up in 1999 would lead to the group members each following different, yet equally successful, personal endeavors.”\n\nSend local news tips and correction requests to eric.kiefer@patch.com\n\nDon’t forget to visit the Patch Newark Facebook page.
