        "text": "One of Hip Hop’s most enduring groups who over their 25 year tenure has delivered hit after hit is Naughty By Nature. Trigger Treach, Uncle Vinny (Vin Rock) and Kay Gee are in many ways taken for granted.\n\nPerhaps its because they delivered some stellar crossover hits like ‘Hip Hop Hooray‘, ‘OPP‘ ‘Alright‘ and ‘Feel Me Flow’ that many have overlooked the fact that Treach is an incredible emcee with one of the best deliveries and flows in Hip Hop. He’s also a pretty good actor.\n\nMany take for granted the production chops of Kay Gee who has a knack for making memorable, sing along hit songs. he’s not only did it for Naughty By Nature but for other groups as well like: Next, Queen Latifah, Jahiem and Kofy Brown to name a few. Many take for granted Vin Rock as the ultimate prototype of the Hip Hop hype man. He makes it look easy until you stand in his foot steps and try to duplicate.\n\nNaughty By Nature has been there through the most challenging tribulations of Hip Hop from the days of the East West coast feud and PMRC censorship battles and its most soaring triumphs where Hip Hop was front in center in helping elect the nation;’s first Black president. We salute them for their success. Below are photos I took during their Art of Rap Performance where they let it be known, after 25 years Naughty By Nature is still on the case.\n\nBelow are some of the photos I took of naughty By Nature and their dope performance the other night at the Art of Rap show in SF at the Regency Ballroom"
