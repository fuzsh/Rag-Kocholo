The first time they performed as a group was at East Orange High School during Kay Gee’s senior talent show in 1987. Growing up, Kay Gee looked up to his older brother, who was heavily into hip-hop music and fashion. But, it wasn’t until after he saw the 1983 film Wild Style that he became inspired to become a DJ. As a DJ, Kay Gee knew he needed backup so, he asked his childhood friend Vinnie to beatbox for him. But they still needed an MC. Vin knew the perfect person for the job. A guy in his Health class that went by the nickname Tiny T Treachery who would later become known simply as Treach.” – Let’s Get To The Root"
