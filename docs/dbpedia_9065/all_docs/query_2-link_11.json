        "text": "1.4K\n\nIn 1991, East Orange rap group Naughty by Nature had their breakthrough hit with the sex anthem “O.P.P.” Their follow-up was a quite a shocker: an uncompromising look at ghetto life with a deceptively upbeat name, “Everything’s Gonna Be Alright” (derived from Bob Marley’s “No Woman, No Cry”).\n\nThe song, sometimes also known as “Ghetto Bastard,” is about someone who has nothing going for him, and never rises above it. He has an absentee father and a mother who can’t afford to raise him; he can’t get a job due to racism (“nappy hair was not allowed”) and turns to crime. Jail, and suicidal thoughts, follow.\n\n“Say something positive? Well, positive ain’t where I live,” he raps, following it up, later, with “How will I make it?/I won’t, that’s how.” You can’t be much more bluntly nihilistic than that.\n\nNaughty by Nature frontman Treach raps with relentless intensity, but the song was still only a minor hit. The group soon had another “O.P.P.”-level success, though, with the more upbeat anthem, “Hip Hop Hooray.”"
