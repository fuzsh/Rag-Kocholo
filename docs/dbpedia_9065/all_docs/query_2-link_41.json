        "text": "Nineties hip-hop favorites Naughty by Nature will release a new EP in 2016 and embark on a 26-city tour in January in celebration of their 25th anniversary.\n\nThe New Jersey trio kicked off an international leg earlier this month and have a Tampa, Florida show scheduled for December 4th. The main trek, however, begins January 27th at the Cone Denim Entertainment Center in Greensboro, North Carolina. Tickets for the tour are available via Naughty by Nature’s website, while a complete list of dates is below.\n\nAlong with the tour, Naughty by Nature teased a new EP, as well as a documentary chronicling their extensive career, which began in the late-Eighties when members Treach, Vin Rock and DJ Kay Gee went by the name The New Style.\n\nThe group released their debut LP, Independent Leaders in 1989, which garnered the attention of fellow New Jersey native Queen Latifah, who mentored the group as they prepped a self-titled release under their new name. Released in 1991, Naughty by Nature was a huge success, propelled by the single “O.P.P.,” an infectious ode to adultery that became a crossover hit despite its scandalous content.\n\nIn author Brian Coleman’s exhaustive hip-hop history book, Check the Technique: Volume 2, Treach recalled making the infamous track in an oral history excerpted for Rolling Stone.\n\n“That was recorded in the first quarter of our recording,” Trach said. “We didn’t try to make a pop hit; it just happened it was the [Melvin Bliss ‘Synthetic] Substitution’ beat and a [Jackson 5] sample. It’s a call-and-response song and we’re talking about fuckin’ other niggas’ bitches. The record probably would have been banned if radio had known what we was talkin’ about. It took them a year or two to figure out what it meant. If you weren’t listening or weren’t really into hip-hop, it wasn’t easy.”\n\nTrending\n\nNaughty by Nature 25th Anniversary Tour Dates\n\nEditor’s picks"
