        "text": "Quilted bombers, horizontal stripes, half-zip windbreakers, tucked T-shirts, long nails, white jeans—it’s a trip to see how many trends immortalized in old rap videos, like those of the group Naughty by Nature, are still outfitting city stompers twenty-five years later. Chalk it up to wistful nostalgia if you must, but don’t underestimate the enduring appeal of a denim bucket hat in any decade. The looks may still carry, but things surely sound different; pop’s tolerance for naughty has grown, shaking off the chummy naïveté that allowed a song to shoehorn an infidelity jingle into daily family car rides and high-school dances across the country.\n\nIn 1991, Anthony Criss, Vincent Brown, and Keir Gist, two rappers and a d.j. from East Orange, New Jersey, better known as Treach, Vin Rock, and DJ Kay Gee, immortalized a three-letter acronym for cheaters worldwide. “O.P.P.” tucked a chorus about sleeping with the spoken-for under a Jackson 5 sample, to the tune of a few million copies sold and pop-culture infamy. “The record probably would have been banned if radio had known what we was talkin’ about,” Treach remembers, in an excerpt from the book “Check the Technique, Volume 2” in Rolling Stone, explaining that he felt the need to spell out the song’s concept to broaden its appeal. “It took them a year or two to figure out what it meant. If you weren’t listening or weren’t really into hip-hop, it wasn’t easy.”\n\nNaughty by Nature followed up with years of hits that struck the same balance. Between the belt-along hooks on songs like “Hip Hop Hooray,” “Jamboree,” and “Feel Me Flow,” the writers indulged in their intricate thousand-piece syllabic puzzles: “Serve words with nerve, embedded, I said it / word, damn, you nerd, man, you heard.” Years later, Eminem would cite Treach verses like these as foundational to his own career.\n\nLast year, Naughty by Nature announced a tour commemorating twenty-five years in music; on April 29, they’ll perform their fan favorites at Manhattan’s Stage 48. Once youth-culture arbiters, many rap acts have settled into more mythicized careers: stories are mined for bio-pics, incumbents debate their predecessors, and undersung heroes are lost to time. It’s a boon to catch shows like these, which celebrate what has possibly become privileged musical knowledge, akin to jazz’s cavernous artist legacies. Rappers set trends, but also legitimize them. To this day, the genre’s hit-makers are tasked with capturing widespread sentiments in local dialects: to get people everywhere to care about what kids are saying, wearing, and doing in a particular place and time. Now that Naughty’s work has eclipsed the slang and styles it once documented, only the universalities remain to be enjoyed. Who’s down? ♦"
