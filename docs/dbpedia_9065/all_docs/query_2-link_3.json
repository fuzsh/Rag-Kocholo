        "text": "\"Say something positive?\" rapped Anthony \"Treach\" Criss on \"Everything's Gonna Be Alright (Ghetto Bastard),\" released to the world 20 years ago on the first Naughty By Nature album.\n\n\"Well, positive ain’t where I live.\"\n\nAs a dismissal of the responsibility to be role models, it wasn’t quite as vituperative as N.W.A.’s. But it was motivated by the same harsh realities. Treach and his partners — rapper and writer Vincent \"Vin Rock\" Brown and deejay and producer Keir \"Kay Gee\" Gist — represented East Orange and urban Essex County. Had they chosen to be spokesmen for conventional morality, they wouldn’t have been able to share the stories they so desperately wanted to tell.\n\nAnd as it turned out, they were stories that the rest of the country was more than eager to hear.\n\n\"We always thought we’d have underground success,\" says Treach, 41. \"But we never thought it would get to the point where it was crossover. We thought we were too raunchy and hard core.\n\n\"Good music knocked down a lot of barriers.\"\n\n\"O.P.P.,\" the group’s catchy first single, rode a Jackson 5 sample and Treach’s uncompromising rapid-fire rhymes about the dark joys of infidelity to double-platinum sales success. The record topped the rap charts, and became one of the first hip-hop singles to reach the Top 10.\n\nThe song’s chorus became a catchphrase that persists to this day, and Treach, Vin Rock and DJ Kay Gee found themselves in an unexpected position. The kids from East Orange High School had become genuine MTV stars.\n\n\"Once you’ve been putting out records for a while, you get a better feel for what works where,\" says Kay Gee, 42, \"but when we started out, we didn’t know what a pop record was, and we didn’t know what a crossover record was. The only intention we had from day one was, ‘We’ve got to be able to rock this crowd.' \"\n\nNaughty By Nature followed up \"O.P.P.\" with \"Everything’s Gonna Be Alright (Ghetto Bastard),\" a forcefully written and fiercely delivered description of growing up broke and disillusioned in Illtown (a slang name for East Orange). Few hard-core rap songs capture the despair, hunger and frustration of poverty as fully as this song did. Once again, Kay Gee sprinkled pop sugar on the track, matching Treach’s harrowing verses with a sample from Bob Marley’s \"No Woman, No Cry\"; once again, Naughty By Nature had a crossover hit. If \"O.P.P\" was the warning shot, \"Everything’s Gonna Be Alright\" was the song that cemented Naughty By Nature’s status: a group that could score hits while maintaining its hard-core credibility.\n\nA decade after Whodini created the template for the three-man hip-hop group, the Garden State had its rap champions.\n\n\"I just made rhymes about what I knew: who we were, where we were from,\" says Treach, whose stage name is short for — and pronounced like — treacherous. \"Plus we wanted people to know about Jersey. Everybody who was outside of Jersey thought it was just lawns and houses and seashore. They thought there’s no ghetto in New Jersey.\n\n\"We knew better.\"\n\nTrue to Jersey roots\n\nAlthough Naughty By Nature would score many more hits after \"Everything’s Gonna Be Alright\" — including the Top 10 \"Jamboree\" and the infectious \"Hip Hop Hooray,\" which became almost as inescapable as \"O.P.P.\" — the three artists have never moved out of New Jersey. They don’t live in Illtown anymore, but they return to East Orange for the clip for their recent single \"I Gotta Lotta,\" a video that revisits many of the locations in the \"O.P.P\" video.\n\nThe message is clear: Trends have come and gone, but Naughty By Nature remains relevant. The group that won the first Grammy for Rap Album of the Year in 1996 still speaks to the streets.\n\n\"We had no idea that we were the first to win that award,\" says Kay Gee. \"We only learned later. At that time, we were surrounded by so many great artists performing in multiple styles. Everybody was selling millions of records. It was all good. There was a cup of tea for everybody.\"\n\n\"I Gotta Lotta\" is one of the most arresting cuts from \"Anthem, Inc.\" (out Tuesday), a disc that is both a celebration of the group’s longevity and an aggressive reclaiming of the group’s hit-studded back catalog.\n\nIn an effort to get control of the rights to the master recordings of the act’s hits, \"Anthem, Inc.\" features re-recorded versions of \"O.P.P.,\" \"Hip Hop Hooray\" and other favorites. (Suzanne Vega and Squeeze, among others, have attempted the same strategy.)\n\nThe members of Naughty By Nature aren’t ashamed to call these \"Twentieth Anniversary\" recordings a shrewd business move. But it’s also clear that they are thrilled to be back in the studio together again. \"Anthem, Inc.\" is their first recording with their original lineup since 1999. Kay Gee left the group for a solo production career in 2000 and did not rejoin until 2006.\n\n\"We all grew up together,\" says Vin Rock, 41, the group’s in-house marketing pro who developed Naughty Gear, one of the first hip-hop clothing lines. (There was even a Naughty Gear store in Newark in the ’90s.) \"We lived in the same neighborhood — North 15th Street, Oval Park. Treach lived on Grove. We were in Little League and Pop Warner together.\"\n\nIt was an exciting time to follow hip-hop. The style had yet to go national: It was mostly confined to the cities and still carried the renegade, free-wheeling, anti-establishment associations that it would later shed. Most of the major figures in the movement were New Yorkers. But the young Treach, Vin and Kay Gee had an advantage that rap fans in other cities did not — a Garden State advantage.\n\n\"Jersey was just 15 minutes out of the city,\" says Vin. \"New York rappers would work Jersey and Connecticut. The rest of the world got it after we did. We could grow up on guys like the Fat Boys and Run-DMC.\"\n\n\"We used to go up to Harlem to get the mix tapes,\" says Treach. \"We used to hear the tapes straight out of the club. After I'd learn them back to back, I started thinking, man, I need to make my own rhymes.\"\n\nNew Style, new name\n\nIt was Treach who encouraged his friend to pick up the pen and become an emcee.\n\n\"Our group — we were called the New Style then — got put together for a talent show,\" says Vin. \"I used to beatbox while Treach rhymed. He said to me: ‘Vin, you have a good voice. Start writing.' \"\n\nThe New Style took advantage of another Jersey connection. The late Sylvia Robinson, Englewood resident and landmark producer of \"Rapper’s Delight,\" signed the high school group to her Bon Ami imprint. (\"It was the end of the Sugar Hill Records era,\" explains Vin, \"Same people, different name.\") Although the New Style album was not a hit, Treach, Vin and Kay Gee gigged relentlessly around the Garden State hip-hop circuit, refining their stage presence and developing the distinctive roughneck sound that would make them famous.\n\nBy the time fellow East Orange resident Queen Latifah — who’d become one of hip-hop’s first female stars in 1989 with \"All Hail the Queen\" — was looking for a new signing to her Flavor Unit Management, they were ready.\n\n\"We had a really tight-knit hip-hop community in Jersey,\" says Vin. \"There were talent shows all over, and we would all float around: us, the Outsidaz, Wyclef. The Fugees went to the same high school we did. Lords of the Underground lived a few blocks over in Newark. I knew Latifah from North 15th Street. She’d visit her aunt there during the summer.\"\n\nThat community would shine during the brief but brilliant moment when the national hip-hop spotlight swung toward New Jersey. During the early ’90s, it was possible for a parochial fan to imagine that the Garden State was becoming the center of the rap universe. Poor Righteous Teachers and Tony D were releasing dizzyingly complex rhymes from their Trenton home base; Redman was pioneering a breakneck style in Newark; and over in Jersey City, P.M. Dawn was reaching for the heavens with a style at once reverent and forward-looking. The Fugees would soon be known worldwide for a globe-trotting sound that incorporated rock, soul, old-school rap and Caribbean music.\n\nNaughty By Nature were the cleanup hitters — the big names with the big bats, guaranteed to drive everybody home.\n\nSince then, Garden State voices have often struggled to compete in the rap marketplace. A recent XXL magazine article called New Jersey the \"forgotten\" hip-hop state. The shadow of the Big Apple is a long one, and as everybody from this side of the Hudson River knows well, feelings of inferiority are easy to cultivate.\n\n\"My thing is this,\" says Vin. \"Don’t worry about titles, worry about putting in work. Don’t worry about being a stepchild. We have our own history and tradition. Everybody in Jersey just has to step up their game. If you’re from here, you know it — you’ve got to love it.\""
