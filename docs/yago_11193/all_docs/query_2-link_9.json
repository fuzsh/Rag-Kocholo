        "text": "Even after two forgettable sequels in the 1990s that almost flipped them on their backs, it's hard to keep a good turtle down. Writer/director Kevin Munroe has stripped away the cheese that has been associated with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise to deliver a film that should appease fans of the original comic book.\n\nThis beautiful-looking computer-animated film - a shoo- in for an Academy Award nomination - employs a grittier, darker palette than seen in the first three live-action entries. It is also more in tune with the original source material than previous cinematic attempts.\n\nThe original comic book (which in part kicked off the independent comic book movement, thanks to its runaway success) was a parody of both \"The X-Men\" and \"Sin City,\" writer/director Frank Miller's dark, ninja-filled take on \"Daredevil.\" This movie succeeds in much the same way the \"Superman\" and \"Batman\" franchises did: It simply takes the material seriously. And since we're talking about crime- fighting, mutated turtles who live in the sewers of New York, that's no small feat.\n\nThe pacing of the story is another matter: The Laurence Fishburne-narrated prologue that sets up the movie is too long. Three centuries ago, a general (voiced by Patrick Stewart) opened a portal that granted him immortality but unleashed 13 monsters on the Earth. His plans to reopen the portal just might bring about the apocalypse. Unfortunately, the turtles are in no shape to stop him.\n\nThe group's leader, Leonardo (of the blue mask and two ninja swords; voiced by James Arnold Taylor), has been sent by their sensei, Splinter (the late Japanese actor Mako, in his last role), to Central America for self-reflection. The other brothers feel abandoned. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT for short) represent a billion-dollar merchandising empire, and Warner Bros. is hoping this film reinvigorates the franchise.\n\nThe Hong Kong-based animation studio's fight scenes, including a roof-top battle in the midst of a rainstorm, are both beautiful and realistic. You forget you're watching a computer-animated feature. In a film about ninja turtles, you couldn't really ask for anything more.\n\nOther than perhaps a sequel, that is.\n\nAnimated action, 82 min. RATING: PG (for animated action violence, some scary cartoon images and mild language). STARS: Featuring the voices of Chris Evans, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Patrick Stewart. PLOT: This sequel should make comic book fans proud. KIDS: A natural for them! DIRECTOR: Kevin Munroe.\n\nTMNT"
