        "text": "Was going to start a thread about the status of this project, but I see there's already one, so I've bumped this thread.\n\nHas anyone heard any recent info or rumors about this project? Obviously, the sell of Lucasfilm to Disney changes many things, including the possible fate of this project.\n\nHere's some info that may be of interest, and that I think fell through the cracks due to all the news and excitement of the sale:\n\nhttp://www.bleedingcool.com/2012/11...-pixarian-brenda-chapman-heres-some-evidence/\n\nThe article is from mid-November, but draws on information about an interview during Summer 2012 the author had with Rick McCallum:\n\nAs of last summer, it seems the project was still kicking around, although it's unclear if TMNT director Kevin Munroe is still involved. In the article, the author goes on to mention that animator Brenda Chapman, also co-director of Pixar's \"Brave,\" accepted a job at Lucasfilm in August. The author speculated that perhaps Chapman was going to be placed in charge of the musical, but now that there's so much movement on various Star Wars projects, he's not sure what's going on with the musical or with Chapman's Lucasfilm involvement. Until very recently it was still listed on IMDb, but upon writing this post, I've found that the listing has been removed.\n\nThat's about all the current/semi-current info I've dug up concerning this \"musical with fairies.\" Thoughts?\n\nWell, could it be? Could it be this project still lives?\n\nhttp://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/06...asfilm/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter\n\nAs we know, as late as mid 2012, Lucasfilm acknowledged this project was still in development, with perhaps the most high profile news being that ex-Pixar filmmaker Brenda Chapman was involved. Now, Chapman confirms she is no longer involved, having spent about six months on the project. Apparently, Kathleen Kennedy asked for Chapman to involved to fix the project's story issues. Now, according to Chapman, her friend Gary Rydstrom is directing the feature. Rydstrom, who seems to specialize in sound design and mixing, has worked on various Pixar features in the past, as well as on Episode I and II, and Ewoks: Battle for Endor.\n\nGiven the upheaval at Lucasfilm by Disney since the purchase, it's still unclear if this project is indeed moving forward. Chapman's comments come from a film festival currently taking place in Norway, but it's still hard to say if Rydstrom is still at the helm and if the project is still around. The project itself raises the question if Disney has any plans (or actually cares) to use Lucasfilm for projects other than Star Wars.\n\nRegardless, it's the biggest bit of news regarding this Lucasfilm project in several months."
