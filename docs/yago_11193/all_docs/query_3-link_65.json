        "text": "No one on the island of Manhattan eats Pizza Hut. Not just because there are so many other terrific pizza options, but because there actually are no Pizza Hut restaurants there. (I just confirmed this on their site locator.) This is a big deal because the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, who live in Manhattan, are unable to keep a secret when tempted by a cheesy, delicious box of Pizza Hut delivery. I know Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a summer popcorn flick, and product tie-ins are a big part of that game, but this stick in the eye of authenticity is indicative of the movie’s overall laziness. Young kids will find the second, more action-heavy half of the film entertaining, but everyone else will want to crawl into their shell.\n\nMegan Fox’s plucky TV reporter April O’Neil is actually the star of the movie’s first half. She yearns to be more than a pretty face doing fluff pieces, and thinks she may be on to a scoop that involves the nefarious Foot Clan and some mysterious vigilantes foiling their criminal activities. We’ll learn, through lots and lots of backstory, that those vigilantes are actually genetically enhanced turtles that have been taught ninja skills by a similarly altered rat.\n\nBy the nuttiest of coincidences, O’Neil’s late father was the geneticist/herpetologist who created this miracle. But William Fichtner’s Eric Sachs, the financier from years ago who seems nice (so is clearly the true bad guy) is actually in cahoots with Shredder, the cyborg-samurai who leads the Foot Clan. If all this sounds a little grating, trust me, it’s far worse when played out in rote scenes of office bickering and banquet speech exposition.\n\nI say that O’Neil is the star of the first half because when the script finally stops building up its inane and uninteresting mythology, we shift perspective over to the titular turtles. The project that created the four hardshell heroes was codenamed “Renaissance” so they are named for Italian painters. There’s Michelangelo, the funny and crass one; then there’s Donatello, the tech geek; there’s Raphael, the brawny tough guy; and Leonardo, the additional turtle with no definitive traits whatsoever.\n\nDismissive though I may sound, once the gang (slowly) realizes that Sachs and Shredder are going to poison New York, the chase is on – and it does get a bit lively. Sachs’ motivation is that he can then sell an antidote derived from the Turtles’ ooze and make a fortune. Shredder’s angle is less clear, but his genuine function is to wield a bouquet of enormous swords and leap about like a button-mashed avatar from SoulCaliber.\n\nMost of the action in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is completely generic and video-gamey. Only one sequence involving all the good guys and bad guys sliding down a snowy hill has any panache or creativity. This lengthy scene digs in and wisely exploits what differentiates this franchise. For starters, these are turtles, so they use their shells as part of their fighting regimen. (They are also teenagers, so they are quick with the wise cracks.) These glorious few minutes of the quartet bonking around on their backs and using biological defense as an offense is almost enough to wake dazed parents that’ve been suffering this far. If they do, they’ll rouse from their slumber just in time for a tonally inappropriate gag about Megan Fox’s posterior.\n\nIf corporate cinema is a cancer then director Jonathan Liebesman is … well, he’s not important enough to be a tumor, but he’s certainly a sign that worrisome markers are higher than they should be. Liebesman, whose work includes Battle: Los Angeles and Wrath of the Titans (the Clash of the Titans sequel most memorable because Perseus had Kenny Powers’ hairdo) musters all his skills here as a purveyor of borderline-watchable movies. If you are on a flight and the choices are screening a Liebesman film or staring vacuously at the back of the chair in front of you, well, that’s a tough call. Is it a long flight?\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a recognizable and marketable intellectual property, so it’s had more than its share of relaunches. But movies dictated from boardrooms aren’t always this dreary. News of the Planet of the Apes reboot was met with rolled eyes, but it’s among the best franchises going right now. The Lego Movie appeared at first blush to be the most flagrant soulless cash-grab of the year –and that ended up being a remarkable work of ingenuity. Alas, this iteration of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a reminder that we should keep our guard up when we suspect creative choices coming from the stockholders’ perspective."
