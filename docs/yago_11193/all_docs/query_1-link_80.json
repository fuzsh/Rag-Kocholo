        "text": "If you’ve been waiting to watch the Ratchet & Clank animated film, then we’ve got some good news (at least if you’re a Netflix subscriber). The film, which was directed by TMNT and Sly Cooper director Kevin Munroe, is now available on Netflix’s instant streaming service. The news was tweeted out by developer Insomniac Games, who of course created the Ratchet & Clank series that the film is based upon. “The [Ratchet & Clank movie] is now available to watch on Netflix in the USA,” said the Burbank, California developer. They also noted that the film is available “in some other countries too” telling people to check their listings.\n\nThe animated film features some major voice talent. Hollywood stars such as Paul Giamatti (American Splendor), John Goodman (King Ralph), and Rosario Dawson (Rent) all appear in supporting roles. The main characters are voiced by their regular actors as James Arnold Taylor reprises his role as Ratchet, David Kaye as Clank, and Jim Ward as the lovable Captain Copernicus Qwark.\n\nThe film originally released April 29, 2016, and was accompanied by a video game version by Insomniac Games. The film serves as a reboot for the series, and the game is a faithful remake of the 2002 game of the same name. PlayStation LifeStyle praised the gorgeous looking reboot in our review last year. Here’s what our own Chandler Wood had to say about the game:\n\n“My hope is that the success of both this game and the movie will show a renewed interest in Ratchet & Clank and prompt Insomniac to do more with the series. Though I could have used a little bit more story between the two lead characters, Insomniac have proven once again that they can make very polished games that are visually cutting edge, and give players plenty of ways to play and have fun. I knew that I was looking forward to revisiting Ratchet and Clank’s origins, but I didn’t know how much I’d really missed Ratchet & Clank until I got the opportunity to play it all over again for the first time, and this brand new experience is every bit as good as I remember it being 14 years ago.”\n\nRatchet & Clank is available now on Netflix instant streaming."
