        "text": "Michael Benjamin Bay (born February 17, 1965; 59 years old) is an American film director and producer who produced the 2014 reboot film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows. He is known for directing high-budget action films characterized by their fast edits, stylistic visuals and substantial practical special effects. His films, which include The Rock, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor and the Bad Boys and Transformers series, have grossed over three billion dollars world-wide. He is co-founder of commercial production house The Institute, a.k.a. The Institute for the Development of Enhanced Perceptual Awareness. He is co-chair and part-owner of the digital effects house Digital Domain. He co-owns Platinum Dunes, a production house which has remade horror movies including Friday the 13th, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and A Nightmare on Elm Street.\n\nPlatinum Dunes[]\n\nBay founded this production house with fellow producers Brad Fuller and Andrew Form in 2001. Platinum Dunes is named after one of Bay's first student films at Wesleyan University.\n\nParamount Pictures signed a first look deal with Platinum Dunes in 2009. As part of this new relationship, Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon have brought the Platinum Dunes producers on to produce a new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film, rebooting the film series launched by New Line in 1990. Bay, Fuller and Form will co-produce with Galen Walker, Scott Mednick and Marina Norman.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nIn Tales of the TMNT volume 2 issue 61: Sometimes They Come Back, published by Mirage Studios in 2009, there is one scene where Michelangelo runs from an explosion shouting excitedly.\n\n[]"
