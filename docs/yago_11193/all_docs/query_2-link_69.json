The Chinese Shinobi master Chung I warns him that the Dragon Lord has caused the Dream Realm to become unstable and is trying to use this disruption as a way to enter the real world. Chung I sends his hooded prized pupil, Mai Pai Chi, from China to New York City to help the now-trapped Splinter. When removing her hood, it is revealed that she is also a mutant turtle. Once meeting up with the Turtles in their lair in New York, Chung I's student explains that she too was mutated along with the Turtles in the sewers of New York City, and that she was washed downstream by herself and was found by Chung I in Chinatown. After being attacked by the Foot Clan, Michaelangelo names her \"Venus de Milo\", in reference to a statue's head she was carrying after the attack. As a group, they infiltrate the Foot Clan's headquarters and Venus uses her Shinobi magic to destroy Shredder's evil personality and end the Foot Clan. Venus successfully teaches the Turtles how to enter the Dream Realm and they are able to free Splinter, after which he awakens from his meditative state. Unfortunately, the Dragon Lord and his minions (called \"The Rank\") follow through the portal into the real world as well, and the Dragon Lord vows to kill and eat the Turtles to absorb their mutant powers for himself. The Dragon Lord sets his minion, Wick, and several Rank Dragons out into the world to gather ingredients for an invincibility serum. They are unable to find enough ingredients for more than a few doses, so they attempt to gather the exotic bones they require from the Bronx Zoo. The Turtles intercept them and work together to foil their plan. The Dragon Lord sends more Rank Dragons to the Zoo to finish off the Turtles, equipped with additional doses of their invincibility serum. Donatello has discovered that the serum is actually just a placebo, which causes the Rank to retreat from the fight. While the Dragon Lord vows revenge, the Turtles realize that the differences in how they each handle situations is what contributes to making them a great team when working together.\n\n6\"The Staff of Bu-Ki\"Michael MazoRamon PirouzianOctober 17, 1997 ( )\n\nThe Dragon Lord utilizes a time warp to steal the Staff of Bu-Ki, an ancient relic that renders Shinobi magic useless. He successfully lures Venus away from the Turtles in an attempt to neutralize her abilities and defeat her, but the Turtles show up in time to save her, thwarting the Dragon Lord once again.\n\n7\"All in the Family\"James TaylorEric WeinthalOctober 24, 1997 ( )[3]\n\nThe Turtles encounter a poacher in the sewer: Simon Bonesteel. When they find out that he's trying to sell a baby sea turtle on the black market, they realize their innate connection to other turtles and devise a plan to save the baby turtle. Bonesteel is thwarted, but he escapes and vows to catch the Turtles.\n\n8\"Silver and Gold\"Don McCutcheonTodd SwiftOctober 31, 1997 ( )\n\nThe Turtles think Michaelangelo is crazy when he runs into a giant talking gorilla gangster named Silver.

Donatello hacks the vault's combination in the nick of time, saving Venus from certain doom while Silver escapes into the night.\n\nIn this episode, Leonardo mentions the Power Rangers, teasing their apparition in Power Rangers In Space.\n\n9\"Turtles' Night Out\"James TaylorAlan SwayzeNovember 7, 1997 ( )[4]\n\nMichaelangelo's pirate radio show, The Sewer Hour, holds a costumed rave to raise money for endangered animals, which gives the Turtles a front for dancing the night away with fellow humans who believe that their appearance as turtles is merely a costume. Unfortunately, Bonesteel shows up and attempts to ruin the party. He ends up being the butt of the joke, and the party raises $1,200 for an endangered animal charity.\n\n10\"Meet Dr. Quease\"Rob StewartMichael MayhewNovember 14, 1997 ( )\n\nDonatello sneaks out to watch a lecture by his favorite eccentric biologist, Dr. Cornelius Quease. The Rank captures the doctor for his knowledge regarding the science of mutation, and Donatello tries to convince the Turtles to rescue the doctor. When Donatello decides to go it alone, he finds that Dr. Quease has been swayed by the gift of a state-of-the-art laboratory provided by the Dragon Lord, and the Turtles initiate a rescue mission to save Donatello. They save their brother, but Quease remains under the employ of the Dragon Lord.\n\n11\"Windfall\"Don McCutcheonBarry JulienNovember 21, 1997 ( )\n\nSilver attempts to steal a winning lottery ticket from an elderly man, but it ends up in Michaelangelo's hands instead. As Michaelangelo thinks of all the different ways he could spend his winnings, Silver makes every attempt to regain possession of the winning ticket. He is ultimately thwarted by the Turtles, and neither Silver nor the Turtles end up with the winning ticket.\n\n12\"Truce or Consequences\"Iain PattersonKen Hotz and Spencer RiceNovember 22, 1997 ( )\n\nWick becomes a fan of The Sewer Hour, Michaelangelo's pirate radio show.

The Rank captures Michaelangelo, but the remaining Turtles concoct a plan to save Michaelangelo in which they pretend to surrender to the Dragon Lord.\n\n13–16\"Unchain My Heart\"Rob Stewart (Part 1),\n\nOtta Hanus (Part 2),\n\nScott Ateah (Part 3 & 4)Rhonda Smiley\n\n(Part 1 & 3),\n\nBarry Julien (Part 2),\n\nDan Clark (Part 4)February 6, 1998 ( )[5][6] (Part 1) February 13, 1998 ( )[7] (Part 2) February 20, 1998 ( )[8] (Part 3) February 27, 1998 ( )[9] (Part 4)\n\nTwo children in China named Chi Chu and Bing are shown opening a mysterious coffin. An anthropomorphic skeleton rises from the coffin, at which time Chi Chu pours a magical elixir onto the skeleton to give it the form of a human woman. It is revealed that the children are her associates (and are actually 1,200 years old), and that she is a 2,000 year old vampire named \"Vam-Mi\". She was defeated 17 years ago by Venus's former master Chung I, at which time he removed her heart and stored it in a wooden box while she was locked away in a coffin. She reveals that she needs to find her heart and put it back in place within four days, otherwise she will lose her human illusion will die once and for all. When Bing informs her that Venus (along with the ancient box containing her heart) is now in America, they travel to New York City on a mission to recover her missing heart from Venus. While Bonesteel is trying to ambush the Turtles, Vam-Mi & Co. appear and attack Venus. The Turtles escape, and Venus discovers that the mysterious dried herb in her antique wooden box has now turned into a beating heart. With Bonesteel still unsuccessfully hunting the Turtles, Vam-Mi continues to try to find her heart. Due to her close proximity, the heart begins moving on its own in an attempt to make its way back to her. Venus insists that they need keep it away from her, however the other Turtles are under the impression that they would be better off giving the heart back to Vam-Mi in exchange for her leaving the Turtles alone. While Venus is asleep, Raphael secretly lets the heart out onto the streets by itself in the middle of the night. However, after running into Vam-Mi and hearing her admit that they want to kill Venus, the Turtles change their mind and battle Vam-Mi instead. The vampires are forced to flee when the sun rises, and Raphael secretly returns the heart to Venus while she is still asleep so she wouldn't know that they took the heart and almost gave it back to Vam-Mi. After an argument about whose problem Vam-Mi is, Venus leaves the Turtles to study a pile of ancient Shinobi scrolls by herself, in an attempt to learn a Shinobi magic spell to destroy vampires. Vam-Mi tracks her down and attacks her, however Leonardo appears and saves the day. Bonesteel, who is also currently chasing Venus, obtains Vam-Mi's heart during her confrontation with Vam-Mi. After returning to the Turtles' lair and admitting that she had lost the heart during the fray, Leonardo convinces the Turtles that if they find Bonesteel, they'll find the heart. Both the Turtles and Vam-Mi end up tracking down Bonesteel at the same time, and after a fight between the three parties, Bonesteel captures Vam-Mi & Co. in a cage, while the Turtles end up with the heart back in their possession. They lock the heart in a safe, unsure about what to do with it now that they have it back. Bonesteel negotiates a deal with Vam-Mi & Co. to work together to defeat the Turtles. While the Turtles work on various gadgets with which to locate and fight Vam-Mi, Venus continues to practice Shinobi magic spells to defeat Vam-Mi. She is unsuccessful at first, but is able to finally master the Shinobi spell from her ancient scrolls. The Turtles track down Vam-Mi who proves to be more powerful than they had imagined. Bonesteel takes advantage of the fight and ends up capturing Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael, while Splinter and Venus flee. The Turtles trick Bonesteel and escape back to the lair, where Venus uses her telepathy to commune with the heart. Vam-Mi uses magic to teleport to her heart, and the Turtles ambush her with sunlight. Vam-Mi dissolves into ash and she is finally defeated. Venus reflects on her experiences and realizes that she is now part of the Turtles' family and is a true Shinobi warrior.\n\n17\"Mutant Reflections\"David StraitonMichael MayhewApril 6, 1998 ( )[10]\n\nDr. Quease develops several robotic Turtles at the request of the Dragon Lord, and sends them to attack the real Turtles.

On their way to the lair, they bump into Dr. Quease and accidentally swap Andre's walking stick for Quease's experimental \"bio-disrupter rod\", a new weapon that he is testing for the Dragon Lord which causes biological matter to combust. Although initially resistant, the Turtles quickly befriend Andre due to his kind nature. After Andre leaves, Raphael discovers that Quease is trying to track down Andre to retrieve the bio-disrupter, resulting in Splinter leading an attack on Dr. Quease and The Rank. Venus breaks the bio-disrupter rod causing Quease to flee, while Andre finally moves into a new apartment with the help of Splinter and the Turtles.\n\n22\"Trusting Dr. Quease\"Robert LeeDan Clark,\n\nMichael MayhewMay 11, 1998 ( )[15]\n\nAfter having a disagreement with the Dragon Lord regarding Dr. Quease's desire to run tests on the Turtles instead of killing them, Dr. Quease reaches out to Donatello to help him further his research on mutation.
