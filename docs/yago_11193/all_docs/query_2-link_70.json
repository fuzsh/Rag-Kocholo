It's more like those earnestly worthy prewar Warner Brothers cinebiographies (invariably starring Paul Muni or Edward G Robinson) celebrating the achievements of Pasteur, Reuter, Zola, Juarez or Dr Ehrlich, that bring to mind Longfellow's lines: 'Lives of great men all remind us,/ We can make our lives sublime/ And, departing, leave behind us/ Footprints on the sands of time.'\n\nMuch of the film unfolds in flashback as Wilberforce (an attractive, uncloying performance from the handsome Ioan Gruffudd) walks around the garden of a country house striking Gainsborough-like poses with his intended, the intelligent fellow radical Barbara Spooner (Romola Garai) while telling her of his aims and political frustrations. Wisely, the movie steers clear of dramatic depictions of the slave trade and life on the plantations (avoiding the sensational, sado-masochism of such films as the dubious Mandingo and its dire sequel, Drum\n\nIt prefers reports by visitors to the West Indies and there is a powerful scene where a histrionic Reverend Thomas Clarkson (Rufus Sewell) produces a set of chains and manacles and demonstrates their use. The pro-slavery advocates get the opportunity to present their economic case (of a kind subsequently evoked to defend child labour and oppose the minimum wage), but we know where the film is leading and we relish scenes where the complacent and cruel have their smug smiles removed.\n\nThe best sequences involve Wilberforce's mentor, John Newton (Albert Finney), the former captain of a slave ship, still haunted by the ghosts of his past after years in holy orders. He wrote the hymn 'Amazing Grace' whose rousing melody and gently robust words never fail to move. There's a wonderful moment where Wilberforce sings it a capella to silence the racist aristocrats at a gentlemen's gambling club, and another at the end when a piper accompanied by a military band plays it outside Westminster Abbey, where Wilberforce is buried beside his friend William Pitt, their private and political relationship being at the core of the film.\n\nDavid Denby of the New Yorker makes a fascinating point in his review of Amazing Grace. 'In this country [the States],' he writes, 'we have great actors, but not these kind of great actors - men and women who can play historical figures and hold to formal syntax without losing their sense of play. Our founding crew of statesmen and intellectuals were no less gifted than Pitt and Wilberforce, but...here isn't a single good movie devoted to their efforts. At this point, no one can look at an American in a powdered wig without laughing. Popular culture and the democratisation of taste and style have made our history irredeemable as entertainment - which is a loss, though I don't suppose anyone will do much about it.'\n\nTurning from the sublime of modern history to a ridiculous rendering of the ancient world, we have 300, a version of the Battle of Thermopylae, in 480BC, where the eponymous 300 Spartans under King Leonidas (Scottish actor Gerard Butler impersonating Sean Connery) confront the massed Persian army of King Xerxes (Brazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro). They are got up to resemble the doormen at an upmarket body-piercing salon.\n\nIt's based on a graphic novel and the dreary settings are generated by computers. From first to last, it's an orgy of bloodletting as the death-dealing, death-loving Spartans kill the Persian envoys and then fight off wave after wave of invaders until they're betrayed by a monstrous humanoid out of Lord of the Rings. The Spartan soldiers, carrying shields like dustbin lids and spears like park railings, have shiny rippling bodies, wear black leather Speedos and short red cloaks, and seem to be responding to an invitation to a fancy-dress party at a gay New York club that reads: 'Come as your favourite ancient Greek [we'll provide the Trojans].'\n\nThis week sees the arrival of two low-budget British films centring on sex, but both pretty unerotic and featuring strong, ill-used casts. The Gigolos costars first-time director Richard Bracewell's co-screenwriters, Sacha Tarter and Trevor Sather, as London gigolos called Sacha and Trevor. They live by night in the West End, drink in a club frequented exclusively by fellow professional ladies' men, share a Mercedes, get into competition with each other and service middle-aged ladies.\n\nThese are played by Angela Pleasence (a literary intellectual), Sian Phillips (a life peer called Lady James), Susannah York (high-flying modelling agent) and Anna Massey (rich, dotty former actress), who apparently improvise their lines. The movie is a creepy nocturne, mildly sensuous but never sensual ('It's not really to do with down there,' Sacha tells a newcomer to the profession).\n\nI Want Candy is a throwback to those soft-core British romps of the Sixties and Seventies, with such titles as Can You Keep It Up for a Week and Come Play With Me, but without the coy displays of flesh. Tom Riley and Tom Burke play film students, who pretend to their families and their pretentious professor (Mackenzie Crook) that they're making a two-minute art film when they're actually producing hardcore porn. A crude, leering, poorly timed farce, it bears the old Ealing Studios logo. That rumbling noise you hear isn't a tube train, it's Sir Michael Balcon turning in his grave.\n\nIn Catch and Release, a mixture of romantic comedy and yuppie weepie, the fiancee (Jennifer Garner) of a fishing equipment vendor in Boulder, Colorado, discovers shortly after his death that he had a mistress and child in Los Angeles. She's consoled by his friends and eventually meets her love rival, who turns out to be a kookie, new age masseuse (Juliette Lewis). The plump Kevin Smith is mildly amusing. The movie is, however, hopelessly over-extended, as is Namastey London, a Bollywood comedy in which a well-off immigrant couple from the Punjab attempt to marry off their feisty, London-born daughter Jasmeet (known to her friends as Jazz) to a naive lad from the subcontinent after she's become engaged to a thrice-married English aristocrat. The attempts at social satire are embarrassing.\n\nTMNT sounds like a new explosive but is, in fact, a computer-generated cartoon film of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Like Harry Lime, they spend much of their time in sewers, but unlike Harry, they do good things when emerging into the light or the night. Such as, in this case, saving New York and civilisation as we know it from baleful alien creatures. Children may well like it, but they deserve better."
