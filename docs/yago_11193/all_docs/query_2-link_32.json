        "text": "KEVIN MUNROE TO WRITE/DIRECT ANIMATED\n\n“TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES” FILM\n\nImagi Services President and CEO Tom Gray announces the signing of Kevin Munroe to\n\nwrite and direct a new CGI-animated feature-length Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film.\n\nThe Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will ramp-up their booming revival with an animated\n\nfilm that will take advantage of new technology developed since the last Turtles film was\n\nreleased in 1993. Now in pre-production, the film is targeted for U.S. release in spring\n\n2007.\n\nKevin Munroe has done extensive animation work during the last decade including video\n\ngames, television series, and original comic books. He has worked in developing both the\n\nwriting and design of animated projects for companies such as Disney, Warner Bros.,\n\nCartoon Network, WWE, Fox Kids, The Henson Company, Kids WB, Dark Horse\n\nEntertainment, IDW Publishing and Nickelodeon. Besides working in all aspects of\n\nproduction design and storyboarding on shows such as Nickelodeon’s “Hey Arnold!,”\n\nMunroe also created, wrote, produced, designed, and directed the CGI Christmas special\n\n“Donner” for ABC. His projects have been optioned by Walt Disney Feature Animation,\n\nStan Winston Studios, and Brett Ratner’s Rat Entertainment in addition to co-writing\n\nanother Imagi feature, Cat Tale. Munroe’s writer/director deal was negotiated by Gray\n\nand Alan Grodin of Weissmann, Wolff, et al., and Brent Weinstein of UTA.\n\nThe Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have enjoyed over 20 years of success in the U.S. and\n\naround the globe. Having shot to mainstream popularity with hit TV series, top grossing\n\nfilms, number one selling toys and enduring comic books, the property has generated\n\nover $6 billion in revenue. The first of the three live-action films grossed $135 million\n\ndomestically, setting a seven-year box office record for independent releases. Today, the\n\nnew hit TMNT TV series is in its third season with a fourth set to run through 2006 on\n\n4Kids TV (formerly Fox Box) and the Cartoon Network in the U.S. In addition, the show\n\nis broadcast in major markets throughout Western and Eastern Europe, Asia, Latin\n\nAmerica, Africa, the Middle East, and Australia.\n\nThe new TMNT film will be produced by Tom Gray (who guided the first Turtles trilogy\n\nthrough production) and Galen Walker of Imagi. Executive Producers are Francis Kao,\n\nGary Richardson, Frederick Fierst, and Peter Laird, who co-created the Teenage Mutant\n\nNinja Turtles with Kevin Eastman. The picture deal was conducted by Gray and Walker\n\nof Imagi, Grodin of Weissmann, Wolff, et al., Richardson of Mirage Licensing, and\n\nFierst of Fierst, Pucci & Kinder. IMAGI / Turtle movie"
