        "text": "Ratchet & Clank is a 2016 computer-animated science fiction comedy film based on Insomniac Games’ video game series of the same name.\n\nDirected by Jericca Cleland and Kevin Munroe, the film stars the voices of Paul Giamatti, John Goodman, Bella Thorne, Rosario Dawson and Sylvester Stallone. The film features an original story loosely based on the 2002 video game Ratchet & Clank.\n\nRatchet is the last of his kind, a foolhardy lombax who grew up without a family. Clank is a pint-sized robot with more brains than brawn. After stumbling upon a weapon that can destroy entire planets, they join forces with a team of do-gooders known as the Galactic Rangers.\n\nTogether, they must stop the evil alien Chairman Drek from utilizing this dangerous technology. Along the way, Ratchet and Clank learn valuable lessons about heroism, friendship and discovering one’s own identity.\n\nSylvester Stallone performed the voice of Victor in the film."
