        "text": "Blast from the Past #654: April 1, 2005: Re: first pass and 2 other things\n\nSubj: Re: first pass and 2 other things\n\nDate: Friday, April 1, 2005 1:08:58 PM\n\nFrom: Peter Laird\n\nTo: Kevin Munroe\n\nKevin,\n\nHere are my comments on your list.\n\n<<KEY CHARACTER DESIGN\n\nLEONARDO\n\nRAPHAEL\n\nMICHAELANGELO\n\nDONATELLO\n\nGeneral Turtles question: can we alter any of their masks? i.e. can one of them wear a bandana instead of the mask? We’ll keep the classic colors, but can we put any markings on the masks? (just questions to open the forum. I like the bandana idea for Raph, but it’s not a hill I need to die on for now.) >>\n\nMy preference is to stay with the classic mask look. Over-the-head bandanas remind me of \"THE NEXT MUTATION\" live-action TV show.... blech. While they are okay for the Turtle Tots (the Turtles as youngsters seen in several episodes of the new animated series), I don't like them on the adult Turtles.\n\n<<We’ll probably make the different body shapes (only slightly, I know) on the second pass of deliverables. (schedule still forthcoming). I’m thinking of Raph being a little more cut, but am open to any other opinions you may have on Mikey and Don, or reference to what’s been done already, or any avenues you’ve gone down, good and bad, before this. >>\n\nI have no problem with Raph being more muscular... and as far as other physical changes go, \"I'll know it when I see it\" -- in other words, I have a mental image of what will be okay, but it's hard for me to put into words. But a rough rule of thumb might be to say that a variation from a \"standard\" Turtle form of 10 to 15% would probably be okay (depending, of course, on what that variation actually looked like). Maybe Don should have a slightly bigger head (proportionally to his body) than the others.\n\nA lot of the visual variation for the Turtles can -- and I think should -- come from posture. For example: Mike slouches a lot, is very casual; Raph likes tough-guy poses, hunched over/angry; Leo stands tall, is very precise in his movements; Don is slightly distracted all the time, as he thinks about a lot of stuff.\n\n<<SPLINTER\n\njust confirming: the deformed ear is a mainstay, right?>>\n\nNo, not necessarily. That torn ear concept was used in the first movie and was developed to make a particular plot point work. I think Splinter would be fine with or without it.\n\n<<Does he have to wear a tattered robe, or can it be a little more presentable? (not shiny, but more everyday wear, gi-style)>>\n\nI think Splinter could wear a robe which isn't tattered; in fact, he could certainly have several different outfits. But the key, I think, is that whatever he wears, it should be simple in design... to reflect his higher level of Zen mastery.\n\n<<APRIL O’NEIL\n\nshe will be the most challenging – human and female. Pushing for a few clothing changes – jungle, business wear, casual, training, final battle. Already have resistance on that from Hong Kong, but I will push it through. We can maybe alter the color/texture of her casual wear for a low-impact way of adding variety to her wardrobe as well.\n\nCASEY JONES\n\n- as discussed, all of this gear will be store-bought-able. Is the white mask a given? Could it be any other color/painted design?>>\n\nI think the white hockey mask is an iconic element for Casey, and thus I would be very reluctant to change it. Maybe there could be an opportunity somewhere in this story for Casey to apply \"war paint\" to his mask to customize it -- preparing for a big battle or something.\n\n<<MAX WINTERS/YAOTL\n\nGENERAL UNO (names still not given)\n\nGENERAL DOS\n\nGENERAL TRES\n\nGENERAL QUATRO\n\nFOOT LEADER (KARAI)\n\n- again, we’ll only see her sans-mask for one shot at the end. Up until that point, we’ll make her body a bit less curvy and less feminine to not raise unnecessary questions.\n\nFOOT NINJA>>\n\nThe comment about Karai and her curvy figure made me realize that there is really no good reason why some of the Foot Ninja couldn't be women.\n\n<<- do we want a logo? Is it the one from the tv show? If so, what the heck is that logo supposed to stand for? If not, what do you want for a logo?>>\n\nI'm not completely sure what you mean by \"what the heck is that logo supposed to stand for\". But I am not opposed to a new logo for the film, as long as it works well and looks cool. I like the design of the logo which we are using on the TV show and all licensed products -- it's a variation/updating of the original Playmates Toys logo. Maybe we could tweak that. Also, we should probably decide if we want to have a \"teaser\" logo and a final logo -- for example, is \"TMNT\" as seen on the manhole cover at the end of the teaser trailer going to be a part of the final titles of the movie, or is that going to be the full \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\"?\n\n<<I-BEAM FIGHT MONSTER - BIGFOOT\n\nDELI FIGHT MONSTER – JERSEY DEVIL\n\nRAPH/CASEY MONSTER – VAMPIRIC\n\n#13 MONSTER – LOCH NESS-ON-LAND – T-REX/LOCH MIX\n\nMISC MONSTER 1 (IN MONTAGE) - TBD\n\nMISC MONSTER 2 (IN MONTAGE) - TBD\n\nMISC MONSTER 3 (IN MONTAGE) - TBD\n\n- I don’t think I want to ever refer to the monsters directly as “hey! There’s Bigfoot!”, but I like that we’re using it as a production design of sorts. On top of that, I am shooting for a look that sort of redefines, (while staying true to established convention) the look of some of these classics. The first four were picked to try and get a wide array of body types and silhouettes. The last three tbd’s and any others we see will be chosen same way.>>\n\nI agree. The idea I've had in my head re: the monsters is that they -- the ones who come through Yaotl's portal thousands of years ago -- are the archetypes upon which the look and legend of our contemporary mythical monsters (i.e. Bigfoot, Yeti, Nessie, etc.) are based. So part of the design process might be to \"reverse engineer\" these monsters... in other words, to try to imagine what look would have inspired the legends we have today, as filtered through centuries of retelling and the recollections/testimony of not-necessarily-reliable eyewitnesses.\n\nOne type of legendary monster which would be visually a lot of fun would be the fearsome Kraken, the sea monster which is thought to have been based on sightings of squids or octopi. A werewolf (or were-beast of any sort... were-lion, were-tiger. were-bear, were-elephant) would also be cool, as would some variation of my favorite movie monster, the Gill Man (\"Creature From the Black Lagoon\")... at least one which wouldn't get us in legal hot water with Universal Studios.\n\n<<KEY ENVIRONMENT DESIGN\n\nTURTLES LAIR\n\nReally would like to see any reference you have for this from your show. Better yet, please wax poetic on your approach to this key layout. Is it an antechamber? An old subway station? Etc. Would love to know your thoughts on the “foundation” of the lair. What you liked about the current tv. What’s cool about the upcoming one. What don’t you like about what’s been done? I think we’re on the same page with wanting something unique and cool with offshooting rooms and pipes and inter-connected chambers, but I want to get in your headspace as much as possible on this before hand. I’m probably going to have the guy who designed most of the underground lairs in Matrix 2 and 3, Van Helsing sets, and the Judge Dredd city, so we’ll be in good conceptual hands, I think. (at least he didn’t write the scripts!)>>\n\nThe basic idea for the Turtles' lair, in pretty much all of its incarnations, is that it is a part of the city infrastructure that was lost/forgotten/abandoned, and the Turtles found it and made it their own... with quite a bit of customization over the years. I'm not married to any particular design, but the basic things are individual rooms for each Turtle and Splinter, maybe a few extra rooms for guests, a dojo/training area, kitchen, armory, workshop, and common area. The entrances and exits need to be carefully/cleverly hidden, and can be things that Donatello has worked out, like sliding walls, hidden panels, doors disguised as pipes, etc. -- the idea being that the Turtles don't want to be discovered, even accidentally by a curious sewer worker.\n\n<<KEY PROPS DESIGN\n\nTURTLES BATTLE GEAR?\n\nI remember your response to the proposed drawings a long time ago, so I know we’re not altering the Turtles’ gear they wear everyday. But you mentioned it might be okay for special purposes – i.e. final battle. If we preluded this by Don tinkering with new gear for them during the movie, could the tmnt use it at the end?\n\nThose issues aside, does that mean that in their standard “walking around” look, that the tmnt “tuck” their weapons into their tied belts, and that’s their only “gear”? When they bring out other gadgets – claws, stars, etc., where do they hold them? Do we do the Looney Tunes off camera grab? I know that Don has a sash bag from the show, but just curious what your thoughts are.>>\n\nI understand the impulse to add new stuff to the Turtles, and I am not opposed to them using new gear for specific reasons... but the sai, katana, bo and nunchaku have become powerful iconic elements of the TMNT \"mythos\", and thus need to be retained as is. That said, one of the things that we have tried to do in the various iterations of the TMNT is to show that although those four weapons are their PREFERRED weapons, they have also received lots of training in other weapons, and are proficient in them.\n\nThe question of \"Where do those climbing claws come from, anyway?\" is a good one. In the comics and the TV show, we have been able to \"cheat\" it... but my thought has always been that a certain amount of gear could be stored on the INSIDE of their belts, tucked away into low-profile pockets hidden on that reverse side. If it becomes a problem in terms of logic and realism, maybe we could think about giving them some kind of small pouches attached to the belts to carry these small gadgets. Don's shoulder bag is more for carrying larger stuff or multiples of smaller things, and/or the tools he needs for a particular job.\n\n<<WINTERS HUNTING EQUIPMENT\n\nGoing after the same production design as the flashbacks, this ancient culture, the motifs of his building etc. But just higher tech.\n\nMIKEY’S MASCOT VAN\n\nJust a funny van decorated to fit Mikey’s alter ego as a party mascot.>>\n\nThat could be cool. This could also be a useful \"hide in plain sight\" surveillance/transport vehicle. Which actually raises another question -- I don't know if it is needed, given the demands of the story, but the Turtles in both animated series have had a \"group vehicle\" in which they (and Splinter) can all travel together. In the current series, it was first a converted bank armored car called the \"BattleShell\", and then a converted moving van. Do we need something like this?\n\n<<NIGHTWATCHER’S BIKE\n\ntweaked out ktm adventurer, right? Either way, we’ll keep the advice of an off-road suspension design and take it to heart.>>\n\nBarring any possible legal problems with using the KTM-specific design, I think that's a great bike to use for this purpose.\n\n<<KEY GENERAL ART\n\nOPENING CREDITS\n\nI can’t find the paper where I wrote down your key villains that we would see during the opening credits projected onto walls, etc. Could you provide again, please?>>\n\nI think Gary has made a pretty comprehensive list, which either he or I will send you, but here is a list off the top of my head, some from the comics, some from the new TV show:\n\nShredder\n\nTriceratons\n\nFoot Ninja/Shredder Elite Ninja/Tech Ninja\n\nRat King\n\nLeatherhead (he's not really a villain, but they did fight him... and he's cool-looking)\n\nNano\n\nBishop/Commandos\n\nBattle Nexus warriors\n\nUltimate Draco\n\nSavanti Romero\n\nI'm sure there are more. It just occurred to me that it might be fun to show glimpses during these credits some of their allies, as well -- Fugitoid and Usagi Yojimbo both come to mind. (The fans would dig it!)\n\n<<That’s about it. We’re ramping up with artists to get going on all aspects of design. And we’ll also get you guys that schedule for what to expect and when. I’m pushing for a small amount of just percolation time (couple of weeks), just to flesh out our general direction. Then the actual designs will begin then. Schedule will explain more.\n\nAnything else that comes into your head along the above lines, please feel free to throw in.\n\nThanks,\n\nKevin>>\n\nCool! Looking forward to seeing more stuff.\n\n-- Pete\n\nBlast from the Past #652: February 27, 2005: Re: Rev. Treatment, and March 1, 2005: comments on third draft of treatment\n\nSubj: Re: Rev. Treatment\n\nDate: Sunday, February 27, 2005 2:49:10 PM\n\nFrom: Peter Laird\n\nTo: Kevin Munroe\n\nKevin,\n\nAs it will probably take me at least another day or two (or three) to put together my detailed comments about the third draft treatment you sent to us, I wanted to zap you off this quick email to tell you that I think we have something here. It all hangs together pretty well and is definitely -- at least to me -- a solid foundation for moving to the next step, which I would assume is a script (or maybe it's a REALLY finished/polished treatment). It probably makes sense to continue to massage this treatment for a little while more so that most if not all of the small holes get filled in and the rough edges smoothed out -- my estimate would be that we are about 75% of the way there (to a finished, approvable treatment).\n\nBut I am very happy that you have put together the elements we have been discussing in a way which tells a complete story without any gaping logic holes. There are a number of areas which still need tweaking to varying degrees, and I'll try to address as many of them as I can with my detailed notes. I think this could turn out to be a wonderful movie and a wild ride.\n\nI'll be in touch soon!\n\n-- Peter\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nSubj: comments on third draft of treatment\n\nDate: Tuesday, March 1, 2005 10:35:09 PM\n\nFrom: Peter Laird\n\nTo: Kevin Munroe\n\nKevin,\n\nOne general comment before I get into specifics -- I'm not convinced that what is in this draft of the treatment is the best way to tell the fairly complicated backstory of Yaotl and the Generals and the monsters. I suspect that we will end up shuffling the elements around a bit.\n\n1.) Re: the following:\n\n\"The brothers are forced to come together when strange phenomena begin to plague New York City – the plant life is growing like crazy, there is a mass-migration of wildlife into the city, and eventually, reports of strange CREATURES are popping up all over the place. \"\n\nWhile the plant life growing like crazy thing could be very fun visually, I'm not sure it makes much sense. I don't see a reason for it. Which is not to say that we COULDN'T think of a reason for it -- just that right now I don't see one.\n\n2.) Re: the following:\n\n\"Splinter Opening Narration about “family” and “brotherhood”\"\n\nThis seems a bit heavy-handed and overly corny to me.\n\n3.) I still like the idea of opening the movie with the flashback to the big battle with Yaotl and his forces against the united tribes of the Olmecs, as it could go a long way to setting up the backstory of Yaotl/WInters and save us from doing too much long-winded and awkward exposition later on in the movie. Also, I kind of dig the idea of tweaking the expectations of the viewers who have just sat down in their seats to watch a TMNT movie... and instead are faced with something out of a Mesoamerican \"Lord of the Rings\".\n\n4.) Re: the following:\n\n\"OPENING CREDITS\n\nSEWER PIPES - learn backstory of TMNT and see rogues gallery of villains they’ve defeated along the way.\"\n\nIt might be cool to expand the environments/settings here -- i.e. not just sewer tunnels but alleyways, rooftops, various interiors, natural exteriors, etc. -- maybe having the images mentioned projected like film onto the surfaces of these locations.\n\n5.) Re: the following:\n\n\"APRIL IN THE JUNGLE – PROCURER OF STRANGE ARTIFACTS\n\nCatch the tail end of a high-adrenaline scene with APRIL surrounded by angry Jungle natives, pissed that she stole a SACRED STATUE from them. Using her wiles, a winch tied between a cargo plane and the statue, she gets out of the jam.\n\nCUT TO: In the air, April flies the plane. Big and empty except for the wrapped artifact now in the middle of the hull. The Statue. Reveal LEO in the back, hitching a pre-planned ride home with April. Hasn’t seen family in a long time.\"\n\nI'm trying -- but failing -- to visualize how April uses \"her wiles, a winch tied between a cargo plane and the statue\". Also, do we really want April to be STEALING this artifact? Maybe she has actually paid for it, and now the natives want more money or something.\n\nGiven that Leo is in her plane, should he be part of this scene and maybe help her get out of this jam?\n\n6.) Re: the following:\n\n\"BACK IN THE CARGO PLANE\n\nEstablish that April and Casey have broken up long ago. She’d like to have feelings for him, but can’t. Leo looks forward to going home.\n\nLeo noticed “change” in jungle animals’ behavior recently. More agitated or something.\n\nLeo finishes up his conversation and suddenly opens the plane hatch! He parachutes out into NYC Harbor! Lands in the water for a secret drain pipe entrance into the city and back home. April flies to airstrip with cargo.\"\n\nI would like to try to work out this April/Casey thing so that it is emotionally \"real\" and when they get back together it will be a powerful, affecting moment. As it is not a KEY plot point, we can tweak and massage this through the script stage until it feels right.\n\nAnd I think it would be cooler if Leo doesn't parachute out of the airplane, but DIVES into the water. Of course, this kind of depends on how high above the surface April is flying -- if it is so high that it seems unlikely that even a mutant turtle would survive hitting the water, maybe Leo should have not a parachute, but some kind of cooler. sleek strap-on glider wings, which he could release himself from at an appropriate altitude and drop into the water. But it would probably work best if he could just jump out of the airplane into the water.\n\n7.) Re: the following:\n\n\"She leaves. Winters is happy. Alone with statue, he opens a back door. Three other statues already there and strapped with high tech EXO-SUITS that have gold/chrome detailing with ancient GLYPHS carved into them. (we’ll use the “magical pacemaker” approach as we discussed) Winters looks to be mean guy with ulterior motives to audience.\n\nDark room – there are other shapes in there. But we don’t see them. Scary.\"\n\nIt might be cool for this scene if there is a FOURTH exo-suit waiting for the fourth statue, set up as if it just needs to be strapped on or activated. In fact, if it works, we might even see the beginning of this process as Winters positions the newly acquired statue within the fourth exo-suit, and the various parts of it begin to merge with the statue.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure what the \"other shapes\" in the last line refers to.\n\n8.) Re: the following:\n\n\"SHOT OF STARS – In the heavens above, we see STARS, looking like they’re slowly moving into an ALIGNMENT of some sort…\"\n\nI am a little reluctant to use this \"stars aligning\" gag, as it has a slight cheesy air to it, and also introduces some elements which might prove problematic, logically. The most obvious one is that Yaotl didn't have to wait for this alignment of stars centuries ago when he summoned these monsters through the gate he opened (and a good thing, too, as it would have been somewhat inconvenient in the middle of a war).\n\nUNLESS... we establish as part of the backstory that Yaotl's summoning of this horde of demons was not a desperation move as we had originally discussed, but was instead part of Yaotl's long-term plan of conquest.\n\nI'm not totally opposed to the \"stars aligning\" thing, but if we use it we should try to make it seem less cliched than it does right now. Also, we should try to answer the question (if we need to) of why Winters is doing this in NYC instead of somewhere in the Yucatan.\n\n9.) Re: the following:\n\n\"CASEY JONES\n\nCasey is now working with inner city kids sport leagues. Given up his vigilante life. Admonishes the vigilante Nightwatcher in front of the kids.\n\nCasey sees strange GLYPHS carved into a building wall. Kids deny having anything to do with it. Casey’s curious. Something doesn’t feel right…\"\n\nIt's unclear to me whether or not Nightwatcher is actually in this scene or if Casey is just talking about him. I suspect it is the latter.\n\nAlso, the idea that Casey has given up his vigilante life seems to be somewhat in conflict with his breakup with April. It seems like that would be one of the things he would have done to make her happy. If he had, would they have broken up? Or if he had and they HAD broken up anyway, would he have gone back to vigilanteism? Things we need to think about...\n\n10.) Re: the following:\n\n\"They look into an alley. See THE FOOT! They’re tagging a wall – carving a GLYPH into it with a bizarre ARTIFACT. Strange. TMNT and Foot fight – just like old times.\"\n\nI have no problem with the Turtles and the Foot fighting, but I think there should be a good reason for them to do so in this circumstance -- they don't just fight on sight. I doubt the Turtles would have started a fight just because they see some Foot \"tagging\" a wall with strange glyphs. Perhaps Raph (who is pissed off anyway) could instigate it and the rest reluctantly go along.\n\n11.) Re: the following:\n\n\" Foot demand more money since freaky monster things are involved. Winters doesn’t bat an eye. (note – the Foot are now muscle for hire after losing Shredder)\"\n\nIt might be a good idea to plant a seed of an idea here -- as subtly as we can -- that the Foot are not terribly happy with the fact that their station has sunk so low, and that one of them -- perhaps it's Karai? -- has ambitions to bring the Foot back to prominence as a criminal enterprise. I am suggesting this as a way to possibly link this movie to a sequel, which I hope will follow.\n\n12.) Re: the following:\n\n\"Don tries to figure out mystery of what’s going on. Something familiar about the monster…\"\n\nI'm not sure what is implied by Don sensing \"something familiar\" about the monster.\n\n13.) Re: the following:\n\n\"STRANGE REPORTS\n\nNews reports intermingled in Act II to talk about “strange crime wave” in the streets of NYC. Maybe we’ll hear the reports, dismissing everything as “normal” crime, but we’ll see what REALLY happened. People are missing (viewers can fill in the blanks there), vandalism, etc. \"\n\nI suspect it is a matter of using the phrase \"crime wave\" as a sort of shorthand, but I don't think we're really talking about a \"crime wave\" per se. This is more like a series of bizarre incidents, I think, as opposed to crimes committed.\n\n14.) Re: the following:\n\n\"Raph goes out as Nightwatcher, determined to find out what’s up with the Monsters. Casey sees Nightwatcher from his window. Grabs trusty bat and goes to inspect, sans Goalie Mask. Realizes it’s Raph. Two sit like gargoyles, catching up on old days, and we learn more about Raph as well as Casey’s unhappiness with their lives.\"\n\nI'm not sure if Casey should appear here without his hockey mask -- might be a lot cooler if he's wearing it in this scene. Also -- how exactly does Casey realize it's Raph? And how is it that HE can do it, but not Leo or the other Turtles?

Re: the following:\n\n\"About to leave, Winters sees Raph. What a strange monster! This one isn’t like the others. He fires a TRANQ DART and Raph turns his shell to take the hit.\"\n\nMight it be extra fun if the \"tranq dart\" was also a TRACKER dart? It might make for a fun bit to have it be so, and have Winters send a Foot force, equipped with a scanning gizmo which points them in the direction of the tracker dart, after the \"strange monster\". We could play it back and forth, switching point of view from the Turtles and friends in the lair to the Foot searching the tunnels, all the way up to the point that the Foot are ALMOST at the hidden entrance to the lair, when Don realizes that this dart is also a tracking device -- and destroys it. And just at that moment, outside the lair, the Foot's scanner goes dead -- no more signal. They groan -- so close and yet so far! -- and leave.\n\n16.)

I have made some comments on the image and am attaching it to this email. One of my major concerns at this point is what I refer to on the image as the \"no wrists/no ankles\" look. I kind of dig it, as it echoes the look of the original comic book Turtles, but I have serious concerns about how it will look when animated. And if we give the Turtles a bit more of a \"ripped\" muscular look (which I think we should), coming up with convincing musculature for those parts of the body might be very difficult.\n\nTalk to you soon.\n\n-- Peter\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubj: teaser trailer animatic comments\n\nDate: Friday, February 25, 2005 2:29:32 PM\n\nFrom: Peter Laird\n\nTo: Kevin Munroe\n\nKevin,\n\nGot the teaser trailer animatic yesterday, and watched it five times, one after the other. Thought it was pretty darn cool. I understand that it is FAR from being finished, and that this is a really rough state and many things will be added/changed/improved. But I am going to make a few comments anyway, with the knowledge that many of the things I mention you may already be thinking about.\n\n1.) First -- and I say this with the caveat that this is a rough piece, and thus we have not yet seen EXACTLY how the finished Turtles will look when animated -- I think the most exciting thing for me is how neat this \"new style\" Turtle (the slightly more big foot/big hands, less human/more \"creature\"-like) looks in motion. Some of the movement across the rooftops was really cool, and I think we will be able to do some stuff with the CGI Turtles that -- while not ludicrous \"Matrix\" -style movements -- will show off their non-human nature and more-than-human abilities.\n\nOne of the things that surprised me was how cool and effective were the \"frog jump\"-style leaping moves some of the Turtles employed. I think that was one of the more animal-like things I dug about the movements.\n\n2.) I'm not sure if this would work, but in my head I can kind of see it being a cool way to visually \"bookend\" the trailer. You know how we end with a close-up of the round manhole cover with TMNT on it... my suggestion would be to start the teaser with the shot of the moon in roughly the same size on screen as we END on the manhole cover. Then, as clouds scud in front of the moon, we pull back and end up in roughly the same orientation as is in the animatic. It would be subtle, but might be a nifty way to make the whole thing connect. Actually... as I typed that last line, it occurred to me that doing so could make for a really cool video loop -- as you reach the end of the trailer on the manhole cover, you do a dissolve back into the moon... and it starts all over again.\n\n3.) Though I like the way the Turtles start moving, I wonder if it would make more sense for them to move FORWARD after Leo's eyes open instead of having them all turn around and go backwards, when they are all standing facing the same way when we first see them. That little bit right after they turn to leave their first positions on the rooftop, and you see them leaping across some chasm, framed on left and right by buildings, is the weakest in terms of movement in the whole animatic, I think.\n\nPerhaps it might work better to do something similar to a camera move near the end of the trailer, where the camera moves around and to the side of Leo after he has landed in the alleyway. In this case, the camera might move around Leo a beat after his eyes open, and kind of start to come around BEHIND him as he leaps across to the next building, followed by his brothers.\n\n4.) My favorite shot of all comes a little more than halfway to the end, when the camera is moving, following the boys from behind as they leap through smoke or steam -- just before leaping off the edge of the building before the clock face. Wicked!\n\n5.) I didn't realize it until I looked at it in extreme slow motion, but the order in which the Turtles leap and drop into the alley seems all messed up. The order as you see them leap off is Mike/Leo/Raph/Don, but when we go to the alleyway view, the order is exactly reversed!\n\nI know that in animation you can kind of cheat timing, but I am a little concerned about the timing of the individual Turtles' landings and subsequent \"show off\" moves. My concern has to do with how long it takes each Turtle to land from the rooftop -- if they all dropped straight down, they would all land within a second or two of each other, not nearly spaced far apart enough to do their individual poses and weapons flourishes. Which makes me wonder if it is really necessary to show ALL of the Turtles dropping out of sight over the edge of the roof in the previous shot. Maybe all we really need to get the idea across is to show ONE of the (Don?) dropping out of sight, with the others clearly heading in that direction.\n\nAnother possibility -- which I will admit right up front might be too much -- might be to follow Don for a brief moment as he begins his plummet into the alleyway (the camera coming up and getting a partial view into and down between the buildings) so that we can see for a split second that the walls leading down into the alleyway are not bare walls, but have pipes and ledges as well as fire escapes -- all items that the Turtles could use to bounce/swing/flip off of to slow their descent into the alleyway. Actually, to show them actually leaping into this chasm from above might be a wonderful \"vertigo\" moment for the audience.\n\n6.) Though the \"Mikey landing in the Dumpster\" bit works well and is funny, I'm a little disappointed that we never see him again after he lands in the Dumpster. I was really hoping that he would get out of it and for a brief moment -- probably frozen in the light from the police car -- we would see all four Turtles posed as they were in the first page of the first TMNT comic book. The fans would love it! (Okay, so would I...)\n\nAt the very least, I think he should pop his head up out of the Dumpster -- and maybe Don should lightly bop him on the head with his bo staff.\n\n7.) I like all Leo's sword kata moves at the end EXCEPT for the one where he brings his left knee up and across his midsection -- it looks a little weird.\n\n8.) It might be cool to have the manhole cover be slightly ajar as we zoom up to it at the very end, then fall into place -- as if the last Turtle in had at that moment let it fall into place. Hmmm... would it be to much to have it up enough so that one of the last things you see before the camera moves into position directly above the manhole cover is a pair of white Turtle eyes peering balefully out?\n\nThat's it for now. I do have to reiterate that I am getting excited about this teaser trailer -- it could be really great!\n\n-- Peter\n\nBlast from the Past #650: February 12, 2005: Re: some backstory ideas\n\nSubj: Re: some backstory ideas\n\nDate: Saturday, February 12, 2005 6:29:34 PM\n\nFrom: Peter Laird\n\nTo: Kevin Munroe\n\nKevin,\n\nI'm still thinking about your recent backstory notes document, but I wanted to get a few of my thoughts on it to you so we can keep this thing rolling. So here goes:\n\n1.) I'm not married to the idea of the big flashback being the opening scene to the movie, but I do think it could work. One of the things I was envisioning was something I've seen in a few movies: We have the big battle take place around -- or at least end -- on or near some distinctive, recognizable landmark (could be natural -- rock formation, unique-looking mountain, waterfall, etc. -- or manmade, i.e. an ancient pyramid or temple). The backstory segment ends with the camera locked onto that setting... then we do a dissolve to the present, without moving the camera.\n\nFor example: Say we end the big battle of the backstory on the upper levels of some kind of pyramid/temple of this ancient pre-Olmec civilization. We pull back to a distance of a thousand feet or so, and we see the temple (it's daytime, maybe late afternoon) with all of the fire and blood and smoke from the previous battle creating our color palette... then we dissolve to present day, many centuries later. The temple has vanished under the creeping growth of the jungle, long lost to man... with JUST enough hints of its shape under all the trees and vines to remind the viewer that they are looking at the same temple. The color palette has shifted to cool and dark colors... it's night... the sky is filled with stars... and we do a pan downward to pick up the activity which begins that opening sequence with Leo doing his training thing.\n\n2.) Re: the following:\n\n\"Start in a “Lost Civilization” that existed even before the Olmecs. Almost Atlantean, in that it’s technology and peoples were really advanced given their historical placement. I like that we can do this, provided that the civilization mysteriously disappears in our story, and the Olmecs started from scratch.\"\n\nMaybe I should wait until I've read this whole thing, but I feel like I should make a comment now. Whenever I read \"Atlantis\" and \"technology\" in the same line, I think of that old movie with the \"death ray\" that the Atlanteans had. I don't think we should go that far... maybe that's not what you are proposing. And I think the Olmecs might not necessarily have to start from absolute \"scratch\", but maybe they build upon the fragments of the previous civilization -- perhaps picking up on some of the basic design elements used by that civilization (so that when we design that vanished civilization, we can use some Olmec-like elements and thus imply that the Olmecs took from this precursor civilization... without really having to say anything).\n\n3.) Reading the rest of your ideas got me to thinking. What if... The \"Plague Army\" which was called forth was essentially a motley collection of various demonic, otherworldy critters and beast, which Yaotl, using magics he doesn't COMPLETELY understand, let loose against his enemies (in some kind of act of desperation, I would think). But, as you say, the plan kind of backfired, as these creatures were pretty uncontrollable, and they did as much damage to Yatol's own forces as they did to the opposing side (the \"good guys\"). The battle raged back and forth, but in the end, the united forces of Yaotl's opposition -- both warriors and wizards -- prevailed. Yaotl's army was destroyed, and the \"plague army\" -- whose numbers had been reduced due to many of the creatures being slain by both weapons and magic in the battle -- dispersed into the jungle.\n\nNow Yaotl and his four generals are cursed -- Yaotl becomes immortal, and the four generals stone statues. (Maybe these stone statues are then transported to various far-flung locales -- as far-flung as is possible given the resources of this pre-Olmec civilization.) And for various reasons, this civilization proceeds to vanish into history,\n\nHowever... the \"plague army\", which had dispersed into the jungle, DIDN'T disappear. In fact, they dispersed further than the jungle, eventually spreading around the world and becoming the demons of legend which have plagued the world over the centuries. The vampires of Romania, the werewolves of Hungary, the chupacabra of Mexico, the Yeti and Bigfoot and Sasquatch, the mothmen, the Kraken and other sea monsters -- these and more were all remnants of the \"plague army\", stubbornly sticking around to plague mankind.\n\nAnd Yaotl, cursed with eternal life, came to understand this. Humbled in his defeat, he realized what evil and suffering his rash actions had visited upon the world. And he has spent all of his long years since that time trying to find a way to make it right. In fact, as part of his efforts, he has used his immortality as a tool to help him track down and capture some of these monsters through the years (and as part of the decor of his \"headquarters\", we could use some of these weird things, a la in the BPRD HQ in the \"Hellboy\" movie). He thinks he has the answer now. He is reconstructing the gateway that he had once used to bring these creatures into our world -- when finished, he plans to use it to gather them all together and send them BACK to Hell.\n\n(I'm not totally clear on all the practical details of this -- something we'd have to hash out.)\n\nOne of the side effects of Yaotl/WInters' efforts is that -- for some arcane reason -- as he rebuilds the gateway, something about the mystic nature of it begins to attract the remnants of the \"plague army\", slowly drawing these creatures from their hiding places and dens around the world, luring them to New York. (One of the reasons I like this part is that it could add some cool action -- NYC is experiencing a growing amount of \"X-Files\"-type stuff -- a mounting plague, if you will, and the Turtles could be right in the thick of it. In fact, it could add to Raph's motivation to become Nightwatcher -- he wants to get out there and fight these monsters.) Some of the monsters find their way to WInters' \"Trump Tower-like building\", and he uses the purpose-built monster containment cells to imprison them until the gateway is completed.\n\nNear the climax of the movie, when it appears that Yaotl/WInters is on the brink of success, we have the double-cross -- his four Stone Generals decide that they would rather the plague army remain on Earth, and be THEIR army, with which they can wreak havoc and conquest on the world of men.\n\n3.) I'm still not sold on the idea of Raph somehow being \"The Heart of the Warrior\", the final piece of the puzzle required to remake or reactivate the gateway. As I mentioned in my last notes (or at least I think I did), there is something distressingly haphazard about using Raph in Yaotl/Winters' plan in this way. Think about it -- if Raph is the only element suitable to fill the slot of \"The Heart of the Warrior\", how in the world could WInters have ever conceived that he could or would find Raph, especially if there is a time factor involved (i.e. a planetary alignment, or whatever) AND he doesn't even know Raph exists? It's an incredible coincidence as it is that their paths cross.\n\nI know that this bit -- surprising the audience by turning their expectations upside-down, in this case revealing that what they thought was an OBJECT being sought turns out to be a PERSON -- is very seductive, and I think when carefully planned and thought out, it can be a winner. But then you also run the risk of turning it into something unintentionally silly, as in \"The Fifth Element\", when that fabled element #5 turns out to be... \"love\". (I think the first time I saw an attempt at this kind of slight of hand was in the old \"STAR TREK\" episode where they are on a planet patterned kind of after the Romans, and they keep hearing about people who worship \"The Sun\", and they think that means the sun in the sky... but then Uhura drops the bomb on them at the very end when she reveals that her analysis of their society shows that it's really the SON (of God).)\n\nSo while I'm not totally opposed to it, I think we're a long way away from a compelling explanation as to why and how Raph can be this \"Heart of the Warrior\" that Winters needs.\n\n4.) I was thinking that it might be cool to work the Foot into this movie idea we're working with, and the way I'm seeing that is to use the Foot as \"hired guns\" that Winters is using to do various things for him (the \"fodder\" referred to in the outline). This would allow us have some fun showing the Turtles beating up on some of their classic opponents -- I think the fans would love it.\n\nAnd we could have one of the Turtles say in passing (as a way of explaining) that since they killed the Shredder, the Foot has been reduced to hiring out as muscle.\n\n5.) The more I ponder this plot, the more it is clear to me that we need to flesh out the nature and character(s) of the four Generals, especially as they are when in stone form. Otherwise, their \"double-cross\" of Winters at the end won't mean a heck of a lot.\n\nPart of this must be an understanding of what it is like for them to be turned (magically) into beings of stone. How has this affected their minds? Are they immobile stone most of the time? Do they require some kind of magic -- provided by Yaotl/Winters, I would assume -- to become animate? Are they aware and thinking while they are immobile stone? Why, exactly, would they turn on Yaotl/Winters at the end? What does this get them? Do they WANT to remain as they are -- beings of stone? If so, why?\n\n(Actually, while I am still not crazy about the \"exo-suits\" for the stone warriors, I just thought of a POSSIBLE rationale for them: Imagine that when the four Generals are turned to stone, they aren't dead... though to normal eyes, they would seem to be. But, in truth, they ARE alive... but in their new stone forms, they can only move VERY slowly. It takes a year for them to blink, for example. Yaotl/Winters discovered this truth only after many years of observation, and through experimentation and delving into deeper magics, has figured out a way to ACCELERATE the \"life cycle\" of the stone the warriors are made of now.\n\nAnd part of this technique involves techno-stuff -- the \"exo-suits\" -- though in what fashion or manner I'm not completely sure of. To riff of something you said in your notes, maybe these \"exo-suits\" aren't meant to add strength to the Stone Warriors (like your classic exoskeleton combat suit or Power Loader as seen in \"Aliens\" is meant to do), but instead is some kind of magic pacemaker or circulatory system for some kind of magic whatever which feeds magic stuff into these Stone Warriors at a rate which allows them to be animate. Actually, that builds into them a vulnerability which we could exploit if needed during a fight -- some of their tubes or conduits or whatever could be damaged, which would slow them down or stop them altogether.)\n\n-- Pete"
