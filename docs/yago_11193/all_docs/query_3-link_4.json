It is the reboot of the 1990 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was released on August 8th, 2014.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nDarkness has settled over New York City as Shredder and his evil Foot Clan have an iron grip on everything from the police to the politicians. The future is grim until four unlikely outcast brothers rise from the sewers and discover their destiny as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The Turtles must work with fearless reporter April O'Neil and her cameraman Vern Fenwick to save the city and unravel Shredder's diabolical plan.\n\nPlot[]\n\nApril O'Neil, a young reporter for Channel 6 news in New York, has been watching a mysterious organization called the Foot Clan terrorizing New York. She stumbles upon a robbery they are committing one night and notices a strange looking figure having foiled it. She tries reporting back to Channel 6 about her findings, but no one believes her.\n\nThe Foot Clan then terrorizes a subway next. She goes to the scene again in an attempt to find the vigilante and find evidence towards his existence. She sees four vigilantes this time, as they all fight off the clan and then disappear. She manages to spot them climbing atop the rooftop however, and tries to take a picture of them with her camera to prove to her co-workers they are real. They discover her and delete the camera images however, and tell her not to tell anyone of their existence or they will personally find her. She asks them who they are before they leave, and claim to be \"Ninja Mutant Turtle Teenagers\".\n\nShe returns to her apartment and finds a July 1999 footage in her camera of a laboratory she was a part of when she was a little girl. She notices that the turtles she took care of from the laboratory 15 years earlier seem similar to the mutant turtles she had seen on the rooftop, She also remembers that her father was testing a type of Mutagen in the laboratory. She continues doing more research and eventually pieces together that the Ninja Turtles were the same ones from the laboratory.\n\nShe tries again to explain to her boss at Channel 6 news about the existence of the Ninja Turtles and that they are fighting secretly against the Foot Clan, but her boss now is so infuriated that she fires April. April thus tries explaining to her co-worker, Vern Fenwick, whom also has strong romantic feelings towards her, about her findings, but he also does not believe her. He does agree to take her to the old laboratory where she first owned the Turtles, however, and she finds her father's lab associate there, Eric Sacks.\n\nApril discusses the Ninja Turtles and how she believes they are fighting against the Foot Clan and shows an image to him of them. Sacks explains to her the history of their experiments with the mutagens, and that he and her now deceased father were planning on using them for healing properties. He realizes what must have happened and that the mutagen must have somehow affected the turtles when the laboratory was exploding and caused them to mutate into human like beings.\n\nMeanwhile in the sewers, the Ninja Turtles tell their master, Splinter the truth about April having spotted them. Splinter orders they find April and bring her to their lair, as she is now in great danger from the Foot Clan since she made contact with the Turtles.\n\nThe Turtles find April and put a sack on her head so she will be unaware of their lair's location. They take her to their master Splinter, who explains to her how she saved their lives from the laboratory by saving them from the fire and releasing them into the sewers. She tells them that she told her father's associate Eric Sacks about them, and was unaware that Sacks was actually allied with the Foot Clan's leader, the Shredder, whom Sacks then relayed the information to. Now that Shredder knew of their existence, he and his Foot Clan minions go into the sewer to capture them so they can use their mutagen to spread a deadly virus throughout New York. Splinter and the Turtles fight against them, but are ultimately defeated and their home destroyed. Shredder kidnaps three of the Turtles, Leonardo, Donatello and Michelangelo and leaves Splinter greatly injured. Raphael is not captured because the Foot Clan believed he was already killed in the battle.\n\nApril managed to hide from the Foot Clan during the fight, and attempts to tend to Splinter's wounds. Raphael is then found and discovered to be alive. Splinter instructs Raphael and April to save the other three Turtles before Shredder can extract the mutagen from them that he plans to use to poison New York. April calls Vern to give them a ride to the laboratory where the other three Turtles are being held hostage.\n\nWhen the trio arrives, April frees the other three Turtles with the adrenaline dose to revive them after they are completely drained of blood and close to death, while Raphael fights the Shredder. After they are freed, they join Raphael and April leaves with the Turtles and Vernon to return to New York for a new plan. During the escape, they are pursued by Shredder's Foot Clan in trucks but eventually manage to defeat them.\n\nAt their lair in the sewers, the Turtles plan they will attempt to hold off against the Shredder on the rooftop of Sacks' building before he is able to finish extracting the mutagen he had acquired from them when he kidnapped them, while April and Vern attempt to gather the mutagen from inside the building and knock Sacks out. April eventually manages to acquire it and heads onto the rooftop to give it to the Turtles. While the Turtles hang from the rooftop, they manage to give April the momentum she needs to kick him off the building, finally defeating him as he falls onto the ground greatly injured and taken into authorities.\n\nThe tower started to collapse as April and the turtles hang on. Believing they are about to die, the Turtles confess their secrets, while Raphael gives an impassioned speech of his love for his brothers before they land harmlessly on the street. They vanish before the humans find them and return to the sewers, where they give Splinter the mutagen and he begins to recover.\n\nThe film ends with Vernon attempting again to catch April's heart with a new car he had just bought, but the Turtles arrive in a new car they had just built and accidentally destroy it when Michelangelo presses the missile button. Vern begins getting very upset, as April gently begins swaying him away when he begins losing his temper while the Turtles offer her a ride in the new car, which she kindly rejects.\n\nCast[]\n\nLive Action Actors:\n\nSoundtrack[]\n\nProduction[]\n\nAccording to Deadline, Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon have brought Michael Bay and his Platinum Dunes partners Brad Fuller and Andrew Form on to produce Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the live-action film that reboots the film series launched by New Line in 1990. Bay, Fuller and Form will produce with Galen Walker and Scott Mednick. The studio originally hired Matt Holloway and Art Marcum to write the film for close to $1 million but they left the project. The Studio hired Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol writers Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec to write the script for the film. According to Variety, Jonathan Liebesman is in talks to direct the film. Deadline reports that Paramount has a Christmas 2013 release date set for the film.\n\nMichael Bay revealed at the 2012 Nickeloden Upfront on March 14, 2012 that the film will be titled \"Ninja Turtles\" and that the Turtles will no longer be mutants, but instead be members of an alien race. However, considering that Bay is not part of the creative process of the film, this remains to be seen. News of Bay's creative change was met with negative criticism from within the fan community. In response to the announcement, actor Robbie Rist who voiced Michelangelo the first three films, wrote to Bay accusing him of \"sodomizing\" the franchise. Rist later remarked that he could have been out of line since Bay makes more money than he does. In response to the feedback, Bay issued a statement asking fans to calm down since a script had not been revealed, his team was working closely with the creators, and would include all the elements that made them fans to begin with. Both Brian Tochi, who voiced Leonardo in the first three films, and Judith Hoag, who played April O'Neal in first film, have voiced their support towards the creative change. Co-creator and former rights holder Peter Laird expressed his thoughts on the change asking fans to take Bay's advice and wait until more of Bay's plan is made available. Laird also stated that he felt the \"ill-conceived plan\" was a \"genius notion\", as it would allow fans to have the multitude of bipedal anamorphic turtles that they have been asking for. He would point out that while the concept of a turtle planet back story made for a great run of the mill science fiction story, but it had no real place in the Ninja Turtles universe. Co-creator Kevin Eastman stated that he had been invited behind the scenes of the film, and concluded that he was official on board with the project and that, although he couldn't say much, he believes it to be \"awesome\". Via Twitter, Corey Feldman, who voiced Donatello in the first and third films, voiced his support for the film saying that he loves Bay's remakes and he is eager to reprise his role. In response to the backlash, Liebesman stated that he was glad to hear about the fan's response, since he and Eastman had been locked in a room working on ideas that, from his own perspective as a fan, everybody will love. If anything storywise were to be expanded upon, it would fit in perfectly with mythos. While he wouldn't confirm whether or not Bay's comment did represent the film's premise, he did stress on the ooze itself and its background in the original comic, reminding that the ooze was the product of alien technology. In regards to how the Turtles would be rendered, Liebesman would not say exactly what visual direction would be taken, but he did state that he did enjoy Weta Digital's work in Rise of the Planet of the Apes. He also pointed out that the film would not be exclusively about action but will also focus on brotherhood, friendship, and responsibility.\n\nIn late March Michael Bay posted on his website explaining the title change and stressing that nothing had changed regarding the Turtles. He stated the reason the title was shorten was at a request by Paramount to make the title \"simple\". He continued that the Turtle were the same as fans remember and regardless of the title change they still act like teenagers. He urged everyone to give everybody who was involved a chance, as they had the fans interest at top priority and would not let anybody down.\n\nEastman told Geekscape that the oozes are from an alien origin.\n\nAn April Fools' Day joke from Screen Rant that Taylor Lautner is cast as Leonardo in the film http://peterlairdstmntblog.blogspot.com/2012/08/blast-from-past-579-may-28-2002-re.html#comment-form Hip-Hop artist Kid Cudi was rumored for a role in the film. Fans of Community's Donald Glover wants the actor to play Donatello\n\nOn June 12, Eastman went on a live chat with The One Ring.net reveals some of the things for the film will includes, April will not be a sixteen year old like in the 2012 series, he thinks Ken Watanabe would make a great Shredder, he'd like to bring Ernie Reyes, Jr. back as a Foot lieutenant, and martial arts wise they are looking at Fist of Legend and The Raid: Redemption.\n\nThree days later, it was reported that production for this project has been shut down. While the release date has been pushed back five months, the work stoppage for the film was said to be \"indefinite\". However, other sources say that the film will be released on May 16, 2014 due to problems in that script that need to be corrected.\n\nLatino-Review looked at an early draft of the script for the film and revealed that Krang, The Technodrome, BEBOP and ROCKSTEADY & Dimension X were going to appear in the film.\n\nEastman talk with MTV about film saying that Easily The Best Turtle Movie Yet.\n\nActress Jessica Biel told Collider that she would like to play April O’Neil in the film.\n\nKevin Eastman mentioned to Comic Book Resources that the movie is creating its own story but has to be true to the source material or else they will get \"f***ing murdered\".\n\nAn early version of the script was leaked online, dated 1/30/12, titled \"The Blue Door\", and written by Appelbaum & Nemec, it features major changes to the origins, such as, the turtles are from an alien planet in Dimension X that consists of turtle warriors, Splinter is an alien from the same planet as well, Shredder is now \"Colonel Schrader\", a government agent who is secretly an alien who can grow blades from his body, \"The Foot Clan\" is now just \"The Foot\", a secret government agency led by Col. Schrader, Casey is an 18 year old security guard/amateur hockey player that finds the Turtles and is the focus of the movie, April is also 18 and is having relationship troubles with Casey because she's moving to New York due to an internship at CBS, Raphael is now the comic relief instead of Mikey, Mikey falls in love with a turtle woman from his home planet.[5][6][7] A cease and desist order was sent by Paramount Pictures to a website that was hosting the script.[8] Peter Laird read the script and commented on his blog that \"all true TMNT fans should be grateful to the new \"powers that be\" that they did not allow this wretched thing to go any further\"[9]\n\nPeter Laird suggested that it might be CGI Turtles with Live Action Actors there was the idea of having Chris Evans and Sarah Michelle Gellar reprise their roles as Casey Jones and April O'Neil, but this was before Nickelodeon bought the rights to TMNT.\n\nOn February 21, 2013, Michael Bay revealed that Megan Fox will be in the cast, playing April O' Neal. On March 21, actor Alan Ritchson is cast as Raphael. That same month, Pete Ploszek, Jeremy Howard and Noel Fisher are cast as Leonardo, Donatello and Michelangelo.

On April 29, 2013, Michael Bay retracted comments that the turtles will be aliens.\n\nOn May 9, 2013, William Fichtner is cast in the film as a lead with iconic stature in the Turtles’ mythology and it was revealed that he's playing The Shredder.\n\nOn August 15, 2013, Paramount postponed the release date to August 8, 2014 to avoid competition from other family-friendly films released in June 2014 as well as one of Paramount's other releases, Transformers 4.\n\nFilming wrapped on August 3, 2013.\n\nIn October 2013, William Fichtner confirmed that Bebop and Rocksteady would not be in the film.\n\nIn November 2013, a source very close to the production revealed that Casey Jones would not be appearing in the film either.\n\nAdditional filming occurred in January and April 2014.\n\nIn February 2014, producer Walker posted on his Facebook page that the trailer of the film will be shown with Captain America: The Winter Soldier.
