        "text": "I was not a fan of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which arrives today on Blu Ray and DVD along with the various VOD services courtesy of Paramount ( Viacom , Inc.). I won't rehash my issues with the film (review), which nonetheless earned a terrific $477 million worldwide on a $125m budget, but out of one of the film's primary flaws comes an interesting nugget of discussion. To wit, the film, which was produced by Michael Bay and directed by Jonathan Liebesman, basically took the heroes in a half-shell and plugged them into the story structure found in the first Transformers. Like that 2007 smash hit, the title characters are basically CGI-created supporting characters in what amounts to a story about a human protagonist who discovers and befriends said heroes. In that film, it was Shia LeBeouf's Sam Witwicky. In this film, it's Megan Fox's April O'Neil. By virtue of this story choice, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles became not only one of the only major studio releases this year that focused on a female protagonist's story, as well as arguably among the few such big-scale releases where the gender of the protagonist was irrelevant.\n\nThat's no small thing. I talk a lot about the need for more mainstream films that center on women and tell stories somewhat rooted in the fact that the protagonist is a woman. But it is just as important for us to get mainstream studio releases that just happen to feature a protagonist who just happens to be a woman, which if anything is even more rare in this current environment. It is said by any number of people both inside and outside the industry that one of the core problems with diversity in the films being produced and the stories being told is that \"white male\" is considered the status-quo default among those who write films and produce films. Except in films explicitly targeting women or two-hander romantic dramas or comedies, the vast majority of releases tend to involve the journey of a white male. This gets ever-more true as you get higher up the production budget pole, with most so-called \"blockbusters\" revolving around the would-be hero's journey of a white guy as a default.\n\nThere are exceptions to be sure. Marketing emphasis aside, Walt Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy arguably revolves around Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). There are a few fantasy-lit young adult franchises (think Sony's The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones) where the protagonist's gender is merely a matter of artistic choice. But those are relatively rare. There is an old cliche that states that girls will see boy movies but boys won't see girl movies. As untrue (or at least irrelevant, depending on the budget and expectations of a given project) as that might be, it is still a notion that filters through the vast majority of blockbuster film making. That is what makes the choice to center the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film around its human protagonist, one who just happens (by virtue of source fidelity) to be a woman, arguably noteworthy. Megan Fox's gender is not vital to the story or all-that-relevant to the narrative. She just happens to be a \"she\" instead of a \"he.\"\n\nIt is not a specifically female-targeting would-be blockbuster like Maleficent or the Twilight Saga, nor is it a female-targeted animated film that stars a woman (Brave, Frozen, etc.). Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a film that arguably targets young boys and yet has a lady protagonist with no emphasis given to said fact. It is, again, arguably by necessity of the source material adapted and the structure chosen, something more akin to the more gender-neutral fantasy films of the 1980's such as Labyrinth or Casper. In the previous summer, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was the only big-budget would-be blockbuster outside of Maleficent that centered on a non-male protagonist. And in terms of all-time global blockbusters, it is the 22nd-biggest grossing film of all-time that arguably centers around a lady's story and/or journey, and that includes the five Twilight films, the first three Pirates of the Caribbean films, and the first three Hunger Games films as well as two-handers like Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Twister, and Titanic.\n\nNow this is the part where you argue that Megan Fox's April O'Neil is not remotely what anyone would call a strong female character in any possible sense of the word. And to that I respond... yes. She is not terribly well-written, she doesn't get much clever dialogue, she is lusted after by two male cohorts, and the film wraps itself in knots giving her \"something to do\" in the action sequences before they let her (spoiler warning, and again similar to Transformers) kick Shredder to his would-be death. But, for the sake of this discussion, the fact that she is a protagonist without necessarily being a \"strong female character\" actually counts as a relative win. Without being overly disrespectful, there are countless male-centric blockbusters that feature what could honestly be called weak male protagonists. Be it The Legend of Hercules, Tron: Legacy, Godzilla, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, and yes the first three Transformers films, a male protagonist can be relatively uninteresting and/or un-entertaining without anyone batting an eye. Just as we need more female-centric stories and \"strong female characters,\" we also darn-well need more mainstream would-be \"big movies\" that just happened to star a woman for no reason whatsoever.\n\nApril O'Neil doesn't have a love interest at the start of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or at the end of it. Her primary narrative goal is to be taken seriously as a journalist and rise up the ranks in her chosen profession. She has relationships with other females of both the personal (her roommate, played by Abby Elliott) and professional (her boss, played by Whoopi Goldberg), and does not end up as a bound-and-gagged hostage in the third act. She is a female lead in a generic blockbuster movie where her gender is all-but-irrelevant in the film. That's something that should be less worthwhile, so for the moment it merits mention when it does occur. I won't pretend that the filmmakers had any aspirations beyond the notion that April is a \"she\" in the comics so she is now a \"she\" in the film. Nor will I pretend that the choice to make April (and not the turtles) the primary focus stems from anything other than an attempt to copy the structure of Transformers.\n\nBut the end result is that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is the rare big-scale blockbuster that isn't explicitly female-targeted yet stars a female lead. April O'Neil is a mediocre female character in the same way in which male characters are allowed to be as a matter of course. That makes it, by-default and regardless of quality, one of the more gender-progressive mainstream movies of 2014. Believe me, I'm as surprised as you are."
