        "text": "Here is a list of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles films, both theatrical, documentary, and made-for-TV.\n\nLive action films:\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990)\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze (1991)\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III (1993)\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 reboot)\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (2016)\n\nAnimated films:\n\nTurtles Forever (2009)\n\nBatman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2019)\n\nRise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie (2022)\n\nComputer-Animated films:\n\nTMNT (2007)\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023)\n\nDocumentary films:\n\nThe Making of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Behind the Shells (1991)\n\nTurtle Power: The Definitive History of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014)\n\n35 Days of Kevin Eastman (2014)\n\nLive action films[]\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990)[]\n\nThe first film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, closely follows the storyline from the Mirage comic books, in addition to some of the more lighthearted elements of the 80's cartoon. This movie presents the origin story of Splinter and the Turtles, their initial encounters with April O'Neil (Judith Hoag) and Casey Jones (Elias Koteas), and their first confrontation with Shredder and his Foot Clan. The Turtles must defeat The Shredder and his growing army of Foot Clan Ninjas, avenging Hamato Yoshi with the help of their human friends Casey and April. Another plot point for the movie is that The Foot have kidnapped Splinter, and the Turtles must rescue him from the Shredder's grasp. Directed by Steve Barron and released by New Line Cinema, the film showcases the innovative puppetry techniques of Jim Henson's Creature Shop.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze (1991)[]\n\nThe first sequel, titled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze, claims the dubious distinction as Vanilla Ice's film debut. It is dedicated in memory of puppeteer Jim Henson. The Turtles learn more of their origin and fight Tokka and Rahzar who are mutant animals created by the Shredder with the aid of the Turtles' human ally Keno (Ernie Reyes Jr.) a Asian teenage boy and the famous Professor Jordan Perry.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III (1993)[]\n\nThe third film in the series, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III, features Elias Koteas reprising his role as Casey Jones. The plot revolves around the \"Sacred Sands of Time\", a mystical scepter. The Turtles go back in time to 1603 feudal Japan to save April O'Neil and become involved in a great battle between the Japanese ruler Lord Norinaga and a group of rebellious villagers.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014)[]\n\nA new feature film, rebooting the film franchise, was originally scheduled to be released in December 2013 as part of the acquisition of the franchise by Viacom. It was announced on May 27, 2010, that Michael Bay's Platinum Dunes production company had landed the rights to the new film. The film is a co-production between Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies.[1][2][3][4][5] The first film was directed by Jonathan Liebesman[6] with a script written byJosh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec & Evan Daugherty[7][8] and stars Megan Fox as April O'Neil[9], Will Arnett as Vernon Fenwick[10][11], William Fichtner as Eric Sacks[12][13], Tohoru Masamune as Shredder[14][15] and features motion capture CGI for the Turtles[16][17] and Splinter[18][19][20], the film was released on August 8, 2014.[21] The film became a box office success.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows[]\n\nA sequel was announced for June 3, 2016 with Dave Green directing.[22][23] The sequel was announced on August 10, 2014, two days after the first film was released. The original cast returns[24][25] with Stephen Amell as Casey Jones[26], Brian Tee as Shredder[14], Tyler Perry as Baxter Stockman[27], and Gary Anthony Williams & Sheamus as Bebop and Rocksteady.[28][29][30]\n\nComputer-Animated films[]\n\nTMNT (2007)[]\n\nMain article: TMNT (2007 film)\n\nThe Turtles' film, titled simply TMNT, was released March 23, 2007. It is the fourth and final installment of the original series. Unlike the previous films, it utilized 100% computer-generated imagery, produced by Imagi Animation Studios and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures and The Weinstein Company. Chronologically, this movie takes place after the third movie. According to a press release, \"the PG-rated movie will derive its tone from the original comic-book series and will be slightly grittier than the previous live-action pictures. The animation was created in Imagi's state-of-the-art facility in Hong Kong.\" The teaser trailer was released July 20, 2006. A second trailer was released January 17, 2007. The storyline focuses on an ancient legend of four siblings and thirteen monsters, taking a giant leap from any preceding Turtle movies yet gave small evidence to the fact that the film is a sequel to the three movies that had preceded it (including showing the magical scepter from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III, the canister the ooze came from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II near the ending, and Shredder's helmet, resembling the one from the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film, even though it was thought to have been crushed in the original movie).\n\nThe movie takes place after Shredder's defeat, with the team essentially broken, as Leonardo is training in Central America, Donatello and Michelangelo have jobs, and Raphael spends his time as the vigilante crimefighter 'Nightwatcher'. Leonardo returns when Max Winters, an immortal warrior who tried to take over the world 3,000 years ago, begins hunting for alien beasts and stone statues of his former Generals. However, tensions begin to rise between Raphael and Leonardo over the leadership of the team. The Foot Clan also make an appearance, with Karai leading them. It is hinted towards the end of the film by a comment by Karai that either the Shredder is not dead, there is a new incarnation of the Shredder in the Foot Clan, or that he will be resurrected. TMNT is the final Ninja Turtles movie to be distributed by Time Warner due to the franchise being purchased by Viacom.\n\nDocumentary films[]\n\nThis documentary focuses on Kevin Eastman's story specifically. The film is inspired in part by 2011's \"35 DAYS OF KEVIN EASTMAN\" art show at Meltdown Comics in Los Angeles.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nCancelled fourth film - Kevin Eastman was working on a fourth Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film between 1995 and 1997 titled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV: The Foot Walks Again. Through concept art of the Turtles and Splinter, the film would have them undergo a second mutation due to the original mutagen changing with age and giving them new problems.\n\nAbandoned TMNT sequels - In an interview with Kevin Munroe, he stated that he would like to direct a possible sequel to the 2007 TMNT film, possibly involving the return of The Shredder.[31] In an interview, Peter Laird stated he was interested in the idea of having the next film be live action CGI film, with the Turtles rendered in CGI and Sarah Michelle Gellar and Chris Evans reprising their TMNT roles in live action.\n\nAbandoned continuation film - In late April 2009, it was announced a new live action film would be in the works for a 2011 release. Mirage Studios was partnering with producers Scott Mednick and Galen Walker, with Peter Laird, Gary Richardson, Frederick Fierst, Eric Crown and Napoleon Smith III would serve as executive producers, and 4Kids Entertainment would handle the film's merchandising.[32] It was stated that the story would be a prequel that would focus on the Turtles' origin.[33] In July 2009, an open casting call was made for extras to play as members of the Foot Clan, with Ernie Reyes Jr. as an acting judge.[34] However, in mid October 2009, it was announced that Viacom's subsidiary network Nickelodeon had purchased all of Mirage's rights to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles property for $9.75 million, thus terminating all deals with 4Kids and Time Warner.[1][35][36]\n\nCancelled third Platinum Dunes Turtles - Noel Fisher stated in an interview that he and the other Turtle actors had signed on for three films. Megan Fox had also signed on for three films. Tyler Perry said that if a third film was made, his character, Baxter Stockman, would probably mutate into his fly form during the movie. Pete Ploszek also expressed his interests in reprising his role in a third film as Leonardo. In October 2016, in light of the film's mixed reception and financial underperformance, producer Andrew Form indicated that a third film was unlikely."
