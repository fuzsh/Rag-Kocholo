        "text": "“Disturbia”In a warmup to his summer blockbuster with “Transformers,” Shia LaBeouf starred in this sturdy teen thriller that borrowed its basic plot from Alfred Hitchcock’s “Rear Window” — a home-bound voyeur who’s convinced he has a murderer for a neighbor. LaBeouf plays a youth sentenced to house arrest, alleviating his boredom by spying on the locals, including a man (David Morse) whom our hero suspects is a serial killer. The DVD comes with deleted scenes, outtakes, a making-of featurette, a trivia quiz and a music video. LaBeouf also teams with co-star Sarah Roemer and director D.J. Caruso for audio commentary. DVD, $29.99; Blu-ray or HD DVD, $39.99. (Paramount) Read the review\n\n“TMNT”The battling “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” return to the big-screen in a computer-animated update featuring the voices of Patrick Stewart, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Laurence Fishburne and Ziyi Zhang. The new adventure has the turtles taking on an army of monsters unleashed by a villain aiming to take over the world. Besides the standard DVD release, the movie is available in high-definition formats as a Blu-ray disc or a combination disc with the HD DVD and standard DVD versions. Extras include an alternate opening and ending, plus a deleted scene, interviews with cast and crew and commentary by writer-director Kevin Munroe.

(Lionsgate)\n\n“Are We Done Yet?”Ice Cube returns to family friendly form with this follow-up to his previous comedy hit “Are We There Yet?” The happy ending of that road-trip tale is short-lived as Cube, his pregnant wife (Nia Long) and his two new stepchildren leave behind city life for the ’burbs, only to discover the house they’ve bought is a money pit. John C. McGinley co-stars as a lunatic building contractor hired to fix up the place, whose destructive methods threaten to bring down the roof. DVD extras include a behind-the-scenes segment and a featurette on McGinley’s character, plus a blooper reel and a quiz about the movie. DVD, $28.95; Blu-ray, $38.96 (Sony)\n\n“I Think I Love My Wife”\n\nChris Rock takes on acting, directing and writing duties with this update of Eric Rohmer’s “Chloe in the Afternoon.” Rock stars as a happily married but bored man constantly fantasizing about other women and suddenly facing real temptation when an old acquaintance (Kerry Washington) who happens to be a knockout comes back into his life. Rock offers audio commentary, and the DVD features deleted scenes and outtakes. There are also behind-the-scenes segments on the making of the movie, the film’s premiere and casting, plus a music video. DVD, $29.98. (20th Century Fox) Read the review\n\n“Unaccompanied Minors”The curmudgeonly talents of comic Lewis Black are wasted in this dreary holiday comedy about a group of youths wreaking havoc at an airport where they’re stranded along with other travelers after a storm grounds all flights on Christmas Eve. Black, who plays an irascible airport official trying to chase down the kids, joins director Paul Feig and the screenwriters for commentary. The DVD also features deleted scenes and a couple of behind-the-scenes segments. DVD, $28.98.
