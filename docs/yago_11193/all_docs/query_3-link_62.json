        "text": "There’s a refreshing sense of nostalgia in “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” — and it doesn’t just have to do with the fact that the eternally youthful ninja turtles have been around since the 1980s, in the form of the original comic book series, as well as TV adaptations, films, toys and video games.\n\nIt’s in the very look of the movie: meticulous computer-generated animation remixed with lively doodles and scribbles, splotches of color and unclean lines — the kind of art that would come from the combination of a free period, a pack of Sharpies and a composition notebook. After all, what’s more adolescent than that?\n\nYou probably already know the back story: Four cute little turtles get transformed by radioactive ooze and are adopted and raised underground, in the sewers of New York, by a rat named Splinter (voiced by Jackie Chan) who’s a master of martial arts. They’re all big fans of pizza.\n\nNow, as teenagers, the turtles — pugnacious Raphael (Brady Noon), doofy Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), nerdy Donatello (Micah Abbey) and their ever-earnest leader, Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu) — dream of having a normal life with humans. But the aboveground masses face their own threat: Another mutated creature, Superfly (Ice Cube), aims to overtake the human world, Magneto-style. The turtles team up with a student journalist named April (Ayo Edebiri) to try to save the day and hopefully be accepted into human society.\n\nThis is certainly a Ninja Turtles for the Internet Age — which, like the web itself, is fun and vast, but ultimately tiring. The dialogue is stacked with pop culture references to show that the four kung-fu-fighting old masters of the sewers definitely have YouTube and Netflix (and, one assumes, surprisingly good Wi-Fi). So they reminisce about sneaking off to an Adele concert and catch Ferris Bueller at a Brooklyn movie drive-in, and Donatello waxes poetic about anime.\n\nThe movie shows the most heart when the group gets hyped up together, going into long, digressive riffs punctuated with jokes and dance moves, channeling the wholesome playfulness that has kept the franchise so popular.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
