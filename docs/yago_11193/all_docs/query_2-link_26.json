        "text": "Since I don't see one anywhere and there are many threads scattered around on this board, I decided to make one thread dedicated to the movie coming out in 2007. Discuss rumors, official info and the like. Here's the info so far on the movie:\n\n-The movie will be all CGI. It's being produced by Imagi Studios in Hong Kong.\n\n-Kevin Munroe is directing and writing the screenplay. Peter Laird is said to be involved in the production.\n\n-The movie will be released March 27, 2007.\n\n-Warner Bros. will handle domestic distribution of the film while the Weinstein Company will handle international distribution.\n\n-The movie will take place after the first TMNT movie and take some elements from the second TMNT movie( a la Superman Returns).\n\n-Shredder will not be in this movie.\n\n-According to Peter Laird, there will be multiple villians in the movie.\n\n-The film will be rated PG.\n\nHere is the official movie website: http://www.imagi.com.hk/movie/web/tmntm.htm\n\nAztec said:\n\nI have little trouble believing that this film will be quality. For that reason I'm very psyched. As for how well it will do....that I'm not so sure about.\n\nWell it opens up on the same day as Pixar's and Disneys new CGI film the Robinsons?(Something like that) So my guess if Robs makes 70mil Turtles will probably make 44mil. The reason I say this is because CGI toons seem to make alot of money and considering that these two films will be Pushed by strong merchandising campaigns, they'll be really celebrated by the Media. I think this will be interesting. very.\n\nCyberCubed said:\n\nAm I the only one who thinks that this movie won't make anywhere near the \"splash\" that the live-action films made? For some reason, I don't really see this movie doing too well. I'm a bit skeptical if the movie will be good too.\n\nI think the movie will be awesome (think grit and complexity of the new series but without the 4Kids tv restrictions), but no it won't do well. The original movie hit at the peak of Turtle mania, and the new series hasn't hit anywhere near that level of popularity with the young audience. And Turtles isn't accessible enough to draw people who aren't fans of the franchise.\n\nI do look forward to it being something other than the \"cutesy animals in stupid situations\" theme that has plagued almost every single CGI film for the past few years.\n\nDarthGonzo said:\n\nUmm, not Doogal.\n\nWe seem to have a lot of low rent CGI films being thrown at us in the coming year. Lets just see how the state of 3D animation stands by the end of the year.\n\nDoogal and Stuff like that came out of nowhere, No one knew about it no one cared for it. I think Turtles will do good.\n\nSimpler Simon said:\n\nI think the movie will be awesome (think grit and complexity of the new series but without the 4Kids tv restrictions), but no it won't do well.

And Turtles isn't accessible enough to draw people who aren't fans of the franchise.\n\nI don't know. Maybe the movie might not do well, but I think it will be a medium-sized hit in theaters. It all depends how Munroe handles the story and whether he can write the multiple villians having equal time on the screen.\n\nSpeaking of villains, who do you think they will be in the movie? I know Shredder isn't a part of it, but who else could they use?\n\nCarlos said:\n\nI don't know. Maybe the movie might not do well, but I think it will be a medium-sized hit in theaters.

I know Shredder isn't a part of it, but who else could they use?\n\nMy theory is that it will follow the \"City At War\" storyline from the comics. Thus the villians will be the Shredder Elite, Karai, and the Foot ninja. This also leaves open the possibility for the Rat King (who appeared in a side story in that arc).\n\nCommercials? It isn't for another year. And in that year we are sure to learn more and more about the movie.\n\nAlso check out this poster I found. I don't know if its official but it's pretty cool. I do know the Leos legit but not so sure about the Don. Does the design remind you of anyone?"
