        "text": "The earliest predecessor to Garuda Indonesia was KNILM, Royal Dutch Indies Airways, founded in 1928 during the Dutch colonial period; despite the similar name, it was not a subsidiary of the main Dutch carrier KLM.[11] KNILM was dissolved in 1947, and its assets were transferred to a new KLM subsidiary, KLM Interinsulair Bedrijf (KLM Interinsular Service), which was nationalized in December 1949.[11]\n\nGaruda Indonesia in its current institutional form had its beginnings in the Indonesian war of independence against the Dutch in the late 1940s, when Garuda flew special transports with a Douglas DC-3.[12] 26 January 1949 is generally recognized as the airline’s founding date, at which time the airline was known as “Garuda Indonesian Airways.” The first aircraft was a DC-3 known as Seulawah (Acehnese: “Gold Mountain”,[citation needed] or from Arabic Shalawah, means praise/worship) and was purchased for a sum of 120,000 Malayan dollars, which was provided by the people of Aceh (notably local merchants).[13] During the revolution, the airline supported Indonesian interests, such as carrying Indonesian leaders for diplomatic missions. Now, a chartered Garuda Indonesia Airbus A330-300 is used by the President of Indonesia for presidential travels.\n\nThe Burmese government helped the airline significantly during its beginnings. The country’s national airline, Union of Burma Airways, often chartered this DC-3 for its own flights. Accordingly, upon Garuda’s formal joint incorporation with KLM on 31 March 1950, the airline presented the Burmese government with a DC-3. By 1953, the airline had 46 aircraft,[12] although by 1955 its Catalina fleet had been retired. Fourteen De Havilland Heron aircraft were acquired to serve shorter range routes. In June 1956, Garuda made its first Hajj flight, operated with a Convair 340 carrying 40 Indonesians, to the city of Mecca.[12]\n\nThe name “Garuda” was derived from a Dutch poem written by a renowned Javanese scholar and poet Raden Mas Noto Soeroto; “Ik ben Garuda, Vishnoe’s vogel, die zijn vleugels uitslaat hoog boven uw eilanden” which means “I’m Garuda, Vishnu’s Bird, spreads its wings high above the Islands”. In Hindu mythology, Garuda is the name of Lord Vishnu’s mount (vahana).\n\nThe line was mentioned by Sukarno during the Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference at The Hague, from 23 August to 2 November 1949.\n\n1960s: Growth and expansion[edit]\n\nThe 1960s were times of growth for the airline; the fleet in 1960 included eight Convair 240s, eight Convair 340s and eight Convair 440s. In 1961 three Lockheed L-188 Electras four-engined turboprop airliners were acquired, and in late 1965, three Convair 990 Coronado four-engined jet aircraft were introduced and a route was opened to Kai Tak International Airport in Hong Kong.\n\nAfter having concentrated on domestic and regional services, the first scheduled flights to Europe were added on 28 September 1963, to Amsterdam and Frankfurt. In 1965, flights to Europe were expanded to include Rome and Paris via Bombay and Cairo, with the exclusive use of Garuda’s Convair 990 aircraft. That year, flights to People’s Republic of China started, with Garuda flying to Canton via Phnom Penh. Also in 1965, the jet age arrived for Garuda, with a Douglas DC-8 that flew to Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport via Colombo, Bombay, Rome and Prague.[12]\n\n1970s–1980s: New equipment[edit]\n\nGaruda is The 6th Largest operator Douglas DC-10 after American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Northwest Airlines, United Airlines and KLM in 1975\n\nDuring the early 1970s, Garuda Indonesia introduced McDonnell Douglas DC-9 and Fokker F28 Fellowship twin-jet aircraft, and at one point Garuda owned 62 Fokker jets, making Garuda the world’s largest operator of F28s at that time. In 1973, the carrier introduced the Douglas DC-10; it later introduced the Boeing 747-200.\n\nThe airline added the Airbus A300-B4 to its fleet on 21 June 1982. Garuda was the launch customer for Airbus A300 with two-man crew cockpit (designated A300B4-220FFCC). By 1984, nine of these were in service, supplemented by 8 Douglas DC-10s, 24 Douglas DC-9s, 45 Fokker F-28s, and 6 Boeing 747-200s. In 1985 under Reyn Altin Johannes Lumenta Garuda created a controversy by hiring foreign brand consultants Landor Associates to create a new logo and colour scheme for Garuda Indonesia, a project that cost the company millions of US dollars. This move was later on applauded as vital for the reputation and corporate identity of Garuda Indonesia as the national airline.\n\nUnder Lumenta, Garuda also increased flights frequency and destinations, reduced ticket prices and collaborated with Merpati, introducing flexible tickets valid for both Indonesian airlines.[14] During the 1970s the airline had its headquarters in Jakarta.[15]\n\n1990s: Difficult time for Garuda[edit]\n\nIn 1991, Garuda purchased 9 McDonnell-Douglas MD-11s;[12] it later introduced Boeing 747-400 in 1994 (two of them were purchased directly from Boeing, the third was ex-Varig), and Airbus A330-300, in 1996. But during this time, Garuda suffered two major accidents. The first of these happened in Japan in the summer of 1996; the second happened in 1997 when an Airbus A300 crashed near Medan, North Sumatra, killing everyone aboard in what remains Indonesia’s worst aviation disaster. The 1997 Asian financial crisis hit Indonesia and Garuda hard,[16] resulting in severe cutbacks on unprofitable routes. Despite once having a comprehensive worldwide route network, Garuda currently suspends services to United States, despite once flown to Honolulu and continues to Los Angeles. Largely due to historical links with the Netherlands, Garuda continued to operate flights to Amsterdam and Frankfurt after the initial cutbacks, although these flights were also discontinued from 28 October 2004. The situation was exacerbated by the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the U.S., the Bali bombings, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, and the SARS scare, all of which contributed to a downturn in air travel and Indonesian tourism. However, by 2005, the airline had largely recovered from its economic problems.[17]\n\n2000–2009: Plummeting reputation and EU ban[edit]\n\nOn 7 September 2004, human rights activist Munir Said Thalib was murdered on Garuda Indonesia Flight 974.[18] Garuda’s CEO at the time, Indra Setiawan, his deputy Rohainil Aini, and pilot Pollycarpus Priyanto were all convicted of his murder.[19][20] Garuda was found negligent in refusing to perform an emergency landing and was ordered to pay compensation to Munir’s widow.[21] Garuda then failed to pay the compensation.[22]\n\nIn June 2007, the EU banned Garuda Indonesia, along with all other Indonesian airlines, from flying into any European countries,[23][24] following the crash of a Boeing 737-400 earlier that year. With the support of the international aviation industry for all Indonesian airlines, the EU promised to review its ban and sent a team of experts, led by the European Commission’s Air Safety Administrator Federico Grandini to Indonesia to consider lifting the ban.[25] In August 2007, the transportation minister of Indonesia announced that the EU would lift its ban hopefully sometime in October, stating that the ban was attributed to communication breakdown between the two parties and that discussion was in progress. In November 2007, Garuda announced its intention to fly to Amsterdam from Jakarta and Denpasar on the condition that the European Union lifted the ban on the airline. Airbus A330s and Boeing 777 were aircraft that were suggested as being suitable for use on these revitalised routes.[26] On 28 November 2007, the EU refused to lift its ban on Garuda flying to all European countries. It announced the safety reforms already undertaken were a step in the right direction for the EU to consider lifting the ban, but still did not satisfy the EU’s aviation safety standards.[27] The ban was lifted in July 2009.[28] In the wake of the ban being lifted, Garuda plans to start services to Amsterdam and is considering other European destinations in the near future. Management is also considering servicing the US where it currently has no services.[29]\n\nIn July 2007, the Deputy of Marketing, Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Indonesia announced that Garuda Indonesia had plans to start service to India, although the date had not been determined.[30]\n\nIn July 2009, following a third mission led again by Federico Grandini,[31] the European Commission lifted Garuda Indonesia’s ban from flying into Europe. This was followed by three other airlines."
