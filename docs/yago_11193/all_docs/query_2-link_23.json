        "text": "Despite being mainly associated with the 1980’s, Eastman and Laird’s “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” is the franchise that has yet to suffer a death of obscurity. It is instead rebooted and revamped every decade for a new generation and they still hold some massive appeal. This week the Turtles make their cinematic comeback with “Mutant Mayhem,” an animated reboot from produces Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen. In celebration I thought it’d be fun to rank all of the cinematic outings of the Heroes in a half shell from Best to Worst.\n\nWhat are your rankings?\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990)\n\nSteve Barron’s adaptation of the indie comic book is still the gold standard for comic book movies to this day. Barron’s treatment of the source material not just paying respect to the original black and white comics but delivering an action film that’s great for all audiences. It’s action packed filled with some top notch choreography, as well as a great story and some of the best puppetry ever brought to film. Almost thirty five years later, this is still a superb action movie filled with laughs, character focus, and real emotional stakes the drive the Ninja Turtles to be their best.\n\nTurtles Forever (2009)\n\nIn honor of the 25th anniversary of the franchise, “Turtles Forever” is a wonderful celebration of the intellectual property. Involving the classic time machine plot devices, “Turtles Forever” takes us down the multiverse to promote positivity in the fan base. There’s no wrong way of enjoying TMNT and the animated movie spans multiple mediums including the comic book to the movies in what is a fun crossover, altogether.\n\nBatman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2019)\n\nA film adaptation of the crossover comic book miniseries Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, this animated movie is a raucous, fun, and exciting meshing of two mega franchises. Batman, Robin, and the Ninja Turtles work surprisingly well off of each other as they’re also forced to contend with each other’s arch nemeses. If you watch this for any reason, watch it for the two part hand to hand fight between Shredder and Batman. It’s absolutely incredible.\n\nTMNT (2007)\n\nI think Kevin Munroe’s interpretation of the TMNT is a very good and painfully underrated. It’s perfectly suitable for what was being approached in the early aughts with the dark and gritty tone that matched a lot with the early iterations of the Ninja Turtles before they became a kids property. “TMNT” isn’t perfect but it’s a lot of fun, garners a ton of great martial arts action, and it’s hard to beat that voice cast. Chris Evans as Casey Jones is absolutely inspired casting altogether.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze (1991)\n\nI’ve grown less and less fond of this one over the years. Much of the grit and martial arts action is completely side stepped for this outing in favor of a lot more mishaps, pratfalls and physical comedy. The opening scene is about as close as we get to hand to hand combat, and director Michael Pressman makes a conscious effort in downplaying the Turtles’ use of ninja weapons. It’s not too good of a movie, when all was said and done despite the nostalgia value. And I miss Casey Jones.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III (1993)\n\nThe idea of the TMNT being warped to ancient Japan is a good one, but the third part in the original movie series is just sadly so disappointing. Apart from a dull story and the omission of Casey Jones yet again, the movie feels a lot like they just kind of ran out of ideas. The Turtles just don’t have the same magic that they did in the 1990 original, the voice work is off, and the villains just aren’t as interesting as the Foot Clan. It’s more bland than awful, but this series deserved a much better cinematic send off.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014)\n\nThe Platinum Dunes reboot by Jonathan Liebesman is a mess from head to toe. The Turtles redesigns are horrible, the story makes no sense, and they over sexualize April, and injects a lot of sexually suggestive jokes, including one moment where Michelangelo suggests he’s getting an erection. For a movie intended to be marketed toward young kids, it’s uncomfortable. Megan Fox is easily the worst April O’Neil to date and the Turtles’ whole re-imagined mythology stinks. Also, are we really supposed to believe that four, seven foot tall turtles with massive shells could be decent stealth, swift ninjas?"
