        "text": "Director: Kevin Munroe, Jericca Cleland; Starring: James Arnold Taylor, David Kaye, Jim Ward, Paul Giamatti, John Goodman, Rosario Dawson, Bella Thorne, Sylvester Stallone (voices). U cert, 94 mins.\n\nIn a golden period for both animation and children’s filmmaking, here is a head-splitting reminder of just how bad those two things can get.\n\nRatchet and Clank has been spun off from a long-running PlayStation franchise which has been credited with bringing the visual richness and invention of great CGI cartoons to the video game realm. Let’s just say the benefits of this particular cultural exchange run in one direction only: the film is an hour and a half of loathsome gargoyles yelling gibberish at each other over deafening laser fire, apparently pieced together with all the discernment and care of a fox dragging a torn bin bag around a garden.\n\nThe film is so lacklustre in visual terms alone – with noticeably looping animations, simplistic character models, and an ugly palette of blaring primary colours and silt – that you might as well be watching a very long videogame cut-scene. To an extent, you are: the film’s production house, Rainmaker Entertainment, used many of the same character models and backdrops as the series’ latest PS4 installment.\n\nThe plot is so mangled it almost defies summary. There’s a smirking cat-thing called Ratchet (voiced, as in the games, by James Arnold Taylor), who ditches his starship mechanic business to join the Galactic Rangers: a crime-fighting posse led by a barrel-chested egotist called Captain Qwark (Jim Ward), who’s heavily reminiscent of the cult comic-book character The Tick.\n\nGame review: Ratchet & Clank is the closest thing to playable Pixar\n\nTwo further team-mates, Elaris (Rosario Dawson) and Cora (Bella Thorne), are token \"strong women\" whose creepily nubile physiques are jarringly at odds with the cartoonish design elsewhere. (There’s no word in English for the kind of second-hand cringe this stuff sends rippling across your shoulder blades, but in German, it’s fremdscham: vicarious shame.)\n\nOne of the games’ unique selling points is the array of gimmicky weapons used by Ratchet in battle (one, the Sheepinator, turns foes into ewes). Many of these are crowbarred en masse into the film’s final action sequence, which aims for madcap extemporisation but delivers floundering incoherence.\n\nThe Rangers’ mission – agonisingly prolonged by a double-cross – is to take down Chairman Drek (Paul Giamatti), an alien overlord who wants to build a perfect planet from fragments of others destroyed by his Death Star-like laser array.\n\nEven the unexpected sound of Sylvester Stallone and John Goodman in small supporting roles can’t chip through the creosote glaze of indifference that soon takes hold.\n\nThere is a shatteringly unfunny running joke in which Drek’s minions fiddle with their mobile phones whenever their master’s back is turned: audience members of all ages may feel their texting fingers twitching in sympathy throughout."
