        "text": "It looks like Star Wars creator George Lucas is going to produce his first musical film. I gotta say this was the last thing I expected Lucasfilm to be involved with, but it's true, they are developing an untitled, top-secret CGI-animated musical at George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch. Kevin Munroe (TMNT) has been hired to direct the film. He recently wrapped production on Dead of Night, a live-action adaptation of the horror comic series Dylan Dog.\n\nAs far is it being a musical is concerned, the film is expected to feature music from a variety of sources. David Berenbaum (The Spiderwick Chronicles, Elf) wrote the screenplay for the project, which reportedly features fairies. So other than that, we know nothing else. I'm surprised and interested to see what exactly this movie will entail, but it would be nice if it actually turns out to be a decent film. We can only hope it doesn't end up like the Star Wars TV holiday special."
