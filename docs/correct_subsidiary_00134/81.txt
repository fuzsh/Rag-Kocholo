Privacy Policy

Oracle Corporation and our subsidiaries and affiliates ("Oracle" or "we") respect your preferences concerning the treatment of personal information that we may collect from your use of the Oracle.com Web sites and your interactions with Oracle off-line. This policy lets you know how we collect and use your personal information, and how you can control its use. This policy describes the broadest potential use of personal information throughout the Oracle.com Web sites and in off-line transactions. We may make far less use of personal information than we have outlined in this policy.

Because of the differences in how certain Oracle lines of business and offerings collect and use personal information, Oracle has established separate privacy policies that govern those different activities.

In addition, the Oracle Education Foundation's Think.com privacy policy and Thinkquest.com privacy policy address information the Foundation collects as part of its non-profit education initiatives.

The Oracle.com Web sites provide links to non-Oracle sites we believe may be of interest to you. Those sites are beyond our control. You are advised to check the privacy policies and terms of use of any non-Oracle sites before providing your personal information to them.
