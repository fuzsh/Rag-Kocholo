        "text": "We tracked a steady number of acquisitions in the vertical market application software sector over the past quarter. Vertical market acquisitions are consistently strong as strategic companies broaden and target their offerings and PE firms fill out their portfolios. Financial services, government, and healthcare were the most active. The specialized energy subsector saw deals and we expect to see increasing activity in technologies advancing the white hot Green IT Movement. For example:\n\n? Private equity firm Cordjia, LLC has acquired HCI Systems Asset Management, LLC, a provider of sustainable \"green\" facility governance solutions.\n\n? Density Dynamics Corp., a company recently formed by Speedus Corp., has acquired the green technology pioneered by TiGi Corp. for high efficiency solid-state storage.\n\n? The acquisition of Diligent by IBM will be an important part of IBM's New Enterprise Data Center model based on best practices for virtualization, green IT, service management and cloud computing.\n\nThe face of the insurance software industry was changed dramatically this past quarter as Oracle made two acquisitions that are likely to set off a wave of M&A with enterprise players, PE and established insurance software solutions providers in reaction. Oracle acquired AdminServer and Skywire Software with the explicit goal of expanding its footprint in the vertical. With these two acquisitions, Oracle is expected to accelerate the formation of the most complete software suite for the insurance enterprise to include Oracle's database and middleware for technical infrastructure.\n\nIn a period where there was very little PE investment, Vertical Markets was the sector that saw the most PE activity during the second quarter. In fact, the two largest vertical deals were done by PE firms.\n\n? Carlyle Groups acquisition of Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.'s U.S. government consulting business was the largest transaction at $2.54 billion.\n\n? Apax Partners Worldwide LLC, a global private equity company, acquired the TriZetto Group, Inc., a provider of core administration software, professional services, and business process outsourcing for the healthcare industry for $1.4 billion.\n\nE-Learning\n\nThe dynamics of e-learning are persistent: universities offer Master programs in e-learning; governments, often from emerging countries, are embracing the technology to improve the educational status of their population and to bring knowledge to remote areas; top U.S. universities are making the lectures of their most renown professors available over the Internet via video; the MIT and global IT players such as Microsoft and Intel embrace the opportunity to extend their reach to non-computerized population groups.\n\nAs it stands, e-learning is exceptionally well poised to extend the bandwidth usage of IP providers and turn the Internet itself into something more meaningful. Mobile operators are embracing its value-added content for their commuters as well as other users with idle time who are eager to turn waiting moments into productive experiences. While e-learning programs today are mostly for the adult segment, increasingly content is being developed for younger target groups, who grow up with the (animated) characters they know, and get older as the target group gets older, too. E-learning today is about making it personal, in an effort to emulate the real-world experience of a teaching class, independently if the purpose is traditional teaching from the crib to the PhD; a distributed company using e-courses on promoting their products, methods or corporate messages to the largest possible company employee audience in the fastest possible time, or a vehicle for information of any sorts to the public or users of a certain product ticket.\n\nWikipedia  itself an e-learning product  and further modern electronic vehicles eager to define human thinking consider e-learning within a wide body of technology: blogs; collaborative software; ePortfolios; virtual classrooms; instructional technology; educational technology; computer-based training; online learning; online education; mobile learning; virtual learning environment; management information system; managed learning environment; online-advising, e-counseling; educational websites; learning management system, and many more.\n\nFor e-learning to become a sustainable business, quality is important. Corum is seeing numerous software and content companies in the e-learning space in no matter which country it looks. And while it is true that local content is an ever important issue, global reach to understanding and knowledge of universal matter have a growing relevance. What will glue together the two worlds, local and universal, are solid, user-friendly, quality-driven platforms and content made available over a ubiquitous service vehicle. No dominant player is yet in sight, due most likely to the market still being somewhere in between the innovator and early adopter phase with its leaders barely crystallizing. But certainly, M&A activity in e-learning may be expected to pick up as backers of this move seek to capitalize on its enormous potential buying the industrys most enlightened software and content companies across the world, ensuring that the most appealing e-learning assets are provided as a service, for all, over a global network.\n\nCommunications\n\nThe Internet is enabling communication applications, and thus they are constantly changing. Mobile networks and handheld device capabilities are rapidly reshaping the way many of us communicate, both professionally and personally. The driving force behind these changes is the increase in bandwidth and accessibility. WiMax, the new wireless broadband technology, and the 4G superfast mobile network will launch a string of innovative applications and devices to be connected to the Net. In a few years, WiMax will become mobile, opening possibilities and becoming an alternative to cell phone networks, at least in densely populated areas. New solutions for advertising should also bring down the cost of using wireless networks.\n\nThe Internet is now the most important carrier of voice traffic along with other modes of communication. Distribution of TV or streaming video over Internet is in its infancy, but the number of subscribers is growing very rapidly. IPTV gives the user access to a range of fresh services. With wireless broadband connection to the Internet, new possibilities are opening up. WLAN telephones that can utilize the low rate offered by VoIP networks are now in the market. With the technologies of FMC (Fixed Mobile Convergence), mobile phones can operate seamlessly between mobile phone networks and WLAN networks. With the introduction of WiMax, users of VoIP through wireless phones will see a wealth of opportunities like streaming video, games and fast Internet access.\n\nHowever, which standards will be used in the coming superfast wireless networks is still an open question. Nortel recently announced they will focus on the 4G or LTE cell phone infrastructure rather than WiMax. Others are spending millions on developing technologies and applications for WiMax.\n\nMobile phones are now employed for much more than just calls. The different handheld products on the market today  GPS devices, PDAs, MP3 or iPod players, and cameras  are now being merged into one multi-function device containing all or at least some of their features. For commercial users, this creates new possibilities. Mobile phones will become terminals with capacities close to what a laptop currently offers. Whatever information needs to be transmitted between employer and employee will be sent, to a large extent, through a handheld wireless terminal.\n\nThese new communication technologies make possible new infrastructure technologies and applications.\n\nTo make wireless handheld terminals work in a high speed environment, high capacity/low power consumption semiconductors are needed. That has triggered some interesting acquisitions over the past year. Last quarter, Icera, the UK-based wireless modem chipset developer, acquired Sirific in order to be able to deliver a complete chipset solution for the mobile broadband market.\n\nThe mobile operators need for content like video, music, maps, weather forecasts and news, in order to create more traffic is also very apparent, causing some significant transactions in recent months. Soon we will see advertising solutions made for handheld devices that will be very attractive for operators and content vendors.\n\nLast quarter saw some interesting deals within the IPTV sector, where the major players are buying smaller companies to position themselves in this young market segment:\n\n? Most significant is Ciscos acquisition of DiviTech in Denmark, offering network management and provisioning solutions.\n\n? NXP acquired Conexants set-top box operations in order to strengthen its offerings of semiconductors for set-top boxes.\n\n? To improve the interaction between mobile networks and IP networks, IntelliNet and OpenGate both made an acquisition in the FMC space by buying Azaire Networks and the mobile solutions business unit from UTStarcom, respectively.\n\n? Mobispine in Sweden bought General Wireless, also from Sweden, to strengthen its offerings in the PC-to-mobile messaging area.\n\n? Vodaphone acquired Danish ZYB, an operator of social networking and online management tools for mobile phone users.\n\nEnergy and Environment\n\nIn the first half of 2008, soaring energy prices dominated our headlines and steered our economy. Sustained high energy prices stifled demand and are shifting resources toward alternative energies and conservation. The price of oil is the bellwether for all activity in energy and tends to drive the investment across other segments of energy. As oil prices rise, so does the investment in technology to generate efficiencies and alternate energy. Consequently, we see continued run up of investment not only in conventional energy but also to commercialize alternate energy and sustainable technologies, and to generate efficiencies throughout the supply chain. Last quarter we wrote about oil rising above $100BBL. This quarter, oil broke the $140BBL mark, nearly doubling in the last year.\n\nThere is an argument to be made for scarcity in the energy and natural resources. Even though growth of oil consumption in the U.S. was flat, global demand is rising with the large consumptive economies in India, China and Russia. China, the second-largest energy user, has accelerated its search for oil and gas at home and abroad to sustain the fastest growth among the world's 10 biggest economies. On the supply side, there is always a lot of buying and selling of petroleum properties as oil companies optimize their E&P portfolios. On the natural resources side, steel and mining companies are taking on backward integration in the supply chain to secure sources of raw materials supply, lower their production costs and increase their self-sufficiency.\n\nThe increasing demand for energy and record oil prices mean that the outlook for investment and M&A activity across the energy market remains strong. Long term market forecasts indicate an ongoing oil boom. Short term fundamentals indicate bullish prices. Public offerings were limited with little change in sight due to economic slowdown in the U.S. and Europe and instability in the capital markets.\n\nPetroleum M&A is Hot\n\nOf a selected 100 energy executives surveyed across the globe recently by Fulbright & Jaworski in their Energy M&A Forecast report, 87 predict that M&A in the USA in 2008 will at least match the hot pace of last year. Most M&A action expected this year involves the petroleum exploration and production sector. The U.S. accounts for about half of all M&A globally, both in terms of transactions and deal values. Few energy executives in the States are worried about record oil prices, with a large majority expecting commodity prices to have no effect on M&A transactions or to even increase deal flow. The primary drivers for energy M&A are 1) the cost of oil production and realizing the economies of scale; 2) access to supply (oilfields); and 3) new markets (geographic expansion). Although private equity investment in the sector has slowed in recent years, 41 percent of respondents expect private equity to account for at least 20 percent of M&A activity this year.\n\nThe M&A activity in energy technology was highlighted by a cross section of noteworthy deals.\n\n? National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NYSE: NOV) acquired Grant Prideco Inc. to form a $32B company. The deal closed in April, 2008. The combination creates a leader in the design, manufacture and sale of comprehensive systems and components used in oil and gas drilling and production as well as in providing supply chain integration services to the upstream oil and gas industry. The deal received an early waiting period termination under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 from the U.S. Department of Justice. The cash-and-stock deal is valued at about $7.4 billion.\n\n? China Oilfield Services Ltd., a unit of the nation's third-largest crude producer, agreed to buy Norway's Awilco Offshore ASA for about $2.5 billion to increase its drilling rig fleet by 47 percent to 22 units. The offer is 19 percent more than the closing price of Awilco's shares on July 4. The deal is expected to close by October. China Oilfield plans to borrow about $2.3 billion from local and overseas banks to fund the acquisition. The purchase of Awilco's fleet comes after average rental rates for jack-up rigs, the most common type for shallow-water drilling, quadrupled in four years to about $200,000 a day.\n\nSoftware deals signal that private equity is active in the sector.\n\n? Vista Equity Partners acquired P2 Energy Solutions and The Oil & Gas Asset Clearinghouse through the acquisition of parent company P2ES Holdings. P2ES Holdings announced the investment in and recapitalization of both its subsidiary companies, P2 Energy Solutions and its auction and negotiated transactions subsidiary, The Oil & Gas Asset Clearinghouse. P2ES Holdings is a leading software, data, auction and marketplace company focused exclusively on the oil and gas industry. P2 Energy Solutions has developed and implemented software applications used by over 340 E&P companies, including 70 percent of the top 25 public companies. The Oil & Gas Asset Clearinghouse has built a reputation as a leading provider of acquisition and divesture marketing and advisory services for the upstream and midstream oil and gas industry.\n\n? Gemcom Software International (TSX:GCM), the largest global supplier of specialized mining productivity solutions, announced that it was to be acquired by JMI Equity and The Carlyle Group, in an all cash transaction. Gemcom shareholders were to receive a 16 percent premium over Gemcoms weighted average closing price for the last 45 trading days. In June, however, Gemcom announced that Pala Investments Holdings also agreed to purchase an ownership interest and the parties agreed to increase the price from Cdn $2.90 to Cdn $3.05 per share. The total value of the transaction grew from about Cdn $180 million to about Cdn $190 million.\n\nFinancial Services\n\nWith the first half of 2008 under wraps, we have witnessed continued healthy activity in the vertical market space and another positive quarter for the financial services sector. As financial markets around the world have experienced rollercoaster swings, so too have some of the buying trends within this niche. Companies that traditionally focus their sights on enterprise applications, CRM, database, or systems integration such as Oracle and SAP are becoming frequently recognizable players in the financial services space. Meanwhile, the traditional financial services-focused companies such as Fiserv, Advent and S1 have been quieter these past few months.\n\nWith a close eye on Oracle, weve counted 15 deals between 2007 and 2008, five of which have close or direct proximity to the growth of their financial service offerings. The purchase of AdminServer in May, and the recent announcement to acquire Skywire are strong maneuvers to continue their position as a key player in the massive insurance industry, and complement Oracle's existing insurance products such as Oracle Billing, Siebel Claims and Siebel CRM for Insurance. Meanwhile, previous acquisitions like Bharosa and Tangosol further enhance their capabilities in the retail banking space.\n\nWhile Avalara made a second tax services purchase in Q2, SunGard stayed focused on integration after some strong transactions in the first quarter to build-out their portfolio management offerings. We expect to see more activity from SunGard in 2H 2008.\n\nDespite the fact that many of the financial services software vendors customers are struggling and the multiples in this sector trending down somewhat in the past few quarters, we stay positive on the momentum of more strategic acquisitions with clear purpose and focused expansion. Financial Services hasnt sustained any major losses in deal count and the rumor mills indicate more healthy deals in the coming quarters.\n\nHealthcare\n\nAll sectors in healthcare are engaged in a consolidation cycle. As in all markets, fewer and larger companies, surrounded by relatively small niche competitors, dominate the landscape. Healthcare providers consolidate to gain market share, improve efficiency and increase leverage with insurers. Insurers and HMOs merge to control costs and gain leverage over providers.\n\nHealthcare IT is clearly affected by the consolidation among their customers. The dynamics of a highly fragmented market where costs to consumers are soaring and increasing government intervention is likely. There are more than 200 companies offering an electronic medical record product today. Yet surveys show less than 25 percent of physicians in private practice use one. That means theres lots of room for growth even for smaller players, but its extremely unlikely that most will survive in the long run.\n\nEven if your IT business possesses advanced technology, competition will be fierce simply because healthcare executives prefer doing business with larger, multi-product vendors. Since their customers will ask for it, these vendors will eventually develop or purchase a competitive technology and you should be considering which of the big dogs could best exploit yours. If your IT business has products in or approaching commodity status, such as back office and medical records applications, you will find the pressure to compete on price may eventually force you look to a larger competitor that would value your customer base. Either way, its better to proactively think about where your company fits in the healthcare IT ecosystem and be prepared if you are approached or circumstances force your hand."
