The work involved spanned two facets of enterprise application development. One was primarily interfacing with different partner systems and the other involved building the UI using DOJO tookit.\n\nDesigned and Implemented Java/J2EE Application on Websphere 7.0 Platform. Implemented Spring 3.0 beans and apply design principles to separate functionality to Business Delegate and DAO Layers. Java persistence API JPA was used to develop the persistence layer.\n\nUsed Liferay 6.x.x to implement JSR-286 portlets. Used document library api to seamless integrate/manage content.\n\nUsed JMS to establish asynchronous communication with partner applications. NOMINATIONS is one such partner system where offers were pulled from CAPACITY RELEASE into 1Line system.\n\nDevelop user interface for 1Line System with DOJO 1.6. Successfully, architected various UI Flows. Used Spring 3.0 MVC implementation to connect the view to the model. And JSON was the preferable data transfer mechanism between the service layer REST client and the UI. REST spec was used to develop RESTFUL webservices. Codehaus API jakson was used to achieve that purpose. Contract and Offer enterprise mobile applications were developed on Android Platform 2.3.x.\n\nUse JASPER reporting API to build custom reports.\n\nCreate/Design ANT Scripts to administer Websphere Server 7.0 both in standalone and Network Deployment versions. Also shell scripts were written to assist the deployment of EAR files.\n\nJava 6.0 was used on a J2SE level to implement batch jobs. Few such jobs include task pollers and task schedulers. Used Doug Lea's concurrent util API for this. The specific instances being Executor service and linked blocking queues.\n\nUsed SOAP-UI along with groovy to build robust component suites.\n\nEnvironment:\n\nJEE, JMS/MQ, Java 6.0, Ant 1.7, EJB 3.0, Weblogic 10.x, Oracle 11g, SVN, Web services WSDL , SOAP, JUnit 3.8.1, Jboss Drools , Hibernate 3.x, Mercury ServiceTest, QuickTestPro, SOAP UI, Android 2.3.3/3.0, Crystal Reports, JASPER\n\nConfidential\n\nLead Developer\n\nThe financial collapse triggered a series of administration overhaul w.r.t financial transactions. As a result, every transaction related to derivatives would go through a clearing house. with clearing fees being levied on those transactions. Most of the time for transactions carried at Citi, Citi acts an executing broker charging commission fees on those transactions trades . Thes trades or deals were captured from ICE, CME, LCH clearing houses through FIX API. Clearing Billing Portal is an effort to capture those transaction fee activities. For this effort I acted as a Lead Developer contributing towards design and development.\n\nDesigned and Implemented Java/J2EE Application on Weblogic Platform. Implemented EJB beans and apply design principles to separate functionality to Business Delegate and DAO Layers. Java persistence API JPA was used to develop the persistence layer.\n\nUsed Liferay 5.x.x to implement JSR-286 portlets to integrate transaction manager and citi velocity into the billing portal. Implemented role based access for both transaction manager and citi velocity. Used document library api to seamless integrate/manage content.\n\nUsed JMS Tibco EMS to establish asynchronous communication with partner applications. Citi Velocity is one such instance where the billed transactions were passed on to front office for further display.\n\nArchitected Business processes with Tibco Business Works inline with SOA service oriented architecture .\n\nDevelop user interface for Clearing Billing Portal with GWT 2.x. Successfully architected various UI Flows. Built enterprise mobile app for Clearing billing Portal on Android OS 2.3.X\n\nUse JASPER reporting API to build custom reports.\n\nCreate/Design ANT Scripts to administer Weblogic Server 10.3 both in standalone and Network Deployment versions. Also shell scripts were written to assist the deployment of EAR files.\n\nJava 1.5 was used on a J2SE level to implement batch jobs. Few such jobs include trade pollers, fee calculator and invoice generator.\n\nEvaluated with prototypes of test frameworks using Mercury Test tools v.z. Service Test for integrated Webservices testing and QuickTestPro QTP .
