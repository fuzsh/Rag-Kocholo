CISQ works to build software quality standards and incorporates with the leading technology organizations worldwide and global initiative sponsored by Software Engineering Institute Carnegie Mellon University and OMG.\n\n12. Meet Us\n\n13. Why Use a Grid System • Efficient use of resources • Dynamic, scalable data capacity • Single, consistent view of data • Load balancing • High availability • Process data where they are\n\n14. How We Choosed Oracle Coherence?\n\n15. Why We Choosed Oracle Coherence • Scalability, Availability, Performance • Support & Price • Ease of Integration, Ease of Management • Multiple Client Support • Distributed Query Execution\n\n16. TCMP, Under The Hood • Tangosol Cluster Management Protocol (TCMP) • TCMP enhances UDP • Scalable • UDP Multicast • Membership Management • Multicast is not required • UDP used for • Very fast and scalable • TCMP guarantees packet order and delivery • TCP/IP connections do not need to be maintained\n\n17. Ease of Integration, Ease of Management • Configuration Management • Simple Cache Api • Weblogic Console / EM Console Integration\n\n18. Distributed Caching: Service Catalog Data SCME APP SERVER 1 Client Client APP SERVER 2 Client Client APP SERVER 3 Client Client\n\n19. Distributed Caching: Service Catalog Data SCME APP SERVER 2 APP SERVER 1 Client APP SERVER 3 Client CacheCacheCache Client Client Client Client\n\n20. Distributed Caching: Service Catalog Data SCME APP SERVER 2 APP SERVER 1Client APP SERVER 3 Client Client Client Client Client MASTER SERVER\n\n21. Our New Catalog System, CPCM • Module that contains complete list of products like tariffs, tariff options, services, packets, campaigns etc.1 – Catalog Management • Price elements attached to the offers 2 – Price Management • Business rules associated with the products 3 – Rule Management • A management module responsible for technical resources installed with products4 – Resource Management • Product specifications 5 – Profile Management • Historic data about products and requests 6 – Version Management\n\n22. CPCM Architecture CPCM Core Application Hibernate Second Level Cache Weblogic Application Servers Maps cached manualy\n\n23. Coherence*Web • HTTP session-management module (built-in feature of Coherence) • Supports wide range of application servers • Does not require any changes to the application • Allows session state to be managed in the various caching topologies • Allows storage of session data outside of Java EE application server • Heterogeneous applications running on mixed hardware/OS/application servers can share common user session data.\n\n24. Turkcell CRM Domain Topology\n\n25. Turkcell CRM Domain Topology – Web Apps\n\n26. Coherence*Web is easy to use • Modify web.xml and weblogic.xml • Deploy coherence-web-spi.war • Configure Coherence Cluster\n\n27. Use Coherence*Web When •You don’t want to loose sessions while restarting/maintaining your application •Your application works with large HTTP session state objects •You run into memory constraints, due to storing HTTP session object data •You want to off-load HTTP session storage to an existing Coherence cluster •You want to share session state across EAR files and application servers\n\n28. GALATA Oracle CEP Processing big amount of data Continuous data flow Latency in miliseconds Different Data Sources User-defined windows for evaluation Complex Event Patterns\n\n29. GALATA • 800,000 events per second • 50 simultaneous campaign/offer capability • Responsiveness under 1 second • With scalable architecture, ready to expand on 0- day\n\n30.

Rules\n\n32. Turkcell SMS Proxy - Columbus\n\n33. Columbus Topology\n\n34. Columbus Coherence Usage • Minimize database access • Calculate distributed TPS • Quickly merge incoming messages • Match delivery reports across cluster\n\n35. Columbus Distributed TPS • Flexible licence control • Balance the load on SMSC • Reliable traffic for SMSC • Minimize network traffic – if necessary • Must be very fast\n\n38. Columbus Distributed TPS • Create a NamedCache • Put initial values • Increment / decrement when needed • Check current value KEY INITIAL VALUE MT TPS 0 MO TPS 0\n\n39. Columbus Distributed TPS public boolean increment() { Boolean result = Boolean.TRUE; if (limitMt != null) { result = executeIncrementTask(MT_INDEX); } return result; } private Boolean executeIncrementTask(int indx) { ChangeTPLimitTask task = new ChangeTPLimitTask(); return (Boolean) this.storedMap.invoke(indx, task); }\n\n40.

Columbus – Merging Messages • Treat different messages as one • Data may not be available on one server • Should be processed as it is available\n\n42. Columbus – Merging Messages\n\n43. Columbus – Merging Messages • Create a NamedCache • Create a list per message reference • Add new message part to list • Process message once all message parts are arrived KEY VALUE MessageRef#1 Part#1 -> Part#2 -> ... MessageRef#2 Part#4 -> ...\n\n44. Columbus – Merging Messages ConcatInfo concatInfo = createConcatInfo(); MergeMoConcatTask task = new MergeMoConcatTask(concatInfo); task = (MergeMoConcatTask) this.storedMap.invoke(concatInfo.getMessageReference(), task); if( task.isFirstPiece() ) { // do things related to first piece of concat } else if( task.getAllPieces() != null && task.getAllPieces().size() > 0 ) { // do things when all pieces are found }\n\n45. Columbus – Merging Messages public class MergeMoConcatTask extends AbstractProcessor implements PortableObject { private ConcatInfo concatPiece; private boolean firstPiece = false; private List<ConcatInfo> allPieces = null; public MergeMoConcatTask() { // for reflection purposes } public MergeMoConcatTask(ConcatInfo concatPiece) { this.concatPiece = concatPiece; }\n\n46.

Columbus – Matching Delivery Reports • Should know which message has arrived • Match delivery reports to the message that it belongs • Should be processed as it is available\n\n49.
