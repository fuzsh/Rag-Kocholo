        "text": "Kevlin Henney, Curbralan\n\nKevlin Henney is an independent consultant based in the UK. He specialises in programming languages, OO design, patterns, development process and software architecture, helping teams adopt techniques and improve their software development through training, mentoring and reviewing and training. He has been a columnist for various magazines and is currently a columnist for the Reg Developer channel of The Register. He is also coauthor of two recent volumes in the Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture series.\n\nPresentation (27/1) : 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know\n\nModern programmers have a lot on their minds. Programming languages, programming techniques, development environments, tools, development process, deadlines, meetings, software architecture, design patterns, team dynamics, code, requirements, bugs, code quality. And more. A lot. The 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know project has collected together the wisdom of many contributors to offer a distilled snapshot of what every programmer should know. This session draws from this collection to present some highlights and useful advice.\n\nTutorial (26/1) : GOOD: Good Object-Oriented Development\n\nGiven that object orientation underpins modern programming languages, it would be expected that anyone using languages such as Java would also know about OO. In one sense this is true, but there is more to effective modern object-oriented development than just creating a few objects and calling a few methods. Many developers have not had the exposure to effective object-oriented practice that would allow them to avoid common pitfalls.\n\nAlthough OO is far from being a new approach (think Sergeant Pepper), and it's also far from being obscure, its mainstream adoption by programmers and programming languages alike is not always as effective as it could be. This session puts a number of key concepts on a firmer footing, highlighting common pitfalls in OO practice ‚Äî such as abuse of inheritance, simplistic getter/setter interfaces, patternitis, overuse of singleton objects, weak use of value objects ‚Äî and emphasising techniques that promote an easier life ‚Äî such as loose coupling, unit testability, pattern-based design thinking, the identification and use of value objects, incremental and sufficient design.\n\nThorbi√∂rn Fritzon, Sun Microsystems\n\nThorbi√∂rn Fritzon b√∂rjade med Java redan vid releasen 1995. Sedan 1999 √§r han Javaarkitekt p√• Sun Microsystems och d√• och d√• talesman i Java-sammanhang. Thorbi√∂rn skriver b√∂cker och √§r en √•terkommande talare p√• konferenser och andra evenemang. Hans hobby √§r programmeringsspr√•k och han har hur m√•nga som helst.\n\nPresentation (27/1) : A Java 7 State of the Union\n\nJava SE 7 looks like it will mark a completely new era for Java. Numerous changes are being proposed and worked feverishly on by several parties: a complete modularization of the platform together with support for modules in the Java language, new support for foreign programming languages, changes to the Java language itself, a completely new garbage collector and other changes that could change the face of Java quite radically. In this session, we'll take a close look at the state of the java union, what will be included and not in JDK 7, what the new features look like and what Oracle's acquisition of Sun means for Java.\n\nHenrik Kniberg, Crisp\n\nHenrik Kniberg is an agile & lean coach at Crisp in Stockholm. He enjoys helping companies succeed with both the technical and human sides of software development. Over the past decade Henrik has been CTO of 3 Swedish IT companies and helped many more get started with agile and lean software development. He regularly coaches and trains together with Jeff Sutherland and Mary Poppendieck.\n\nHenrik's book Scrum and XP from the Trenches has over 150,000 readers and is one of the most popular books on the topic, his second book \"Kanban and Scrum - making the most of both\" attempts to broaden the view further.\n\nTutorial (26/1) : Kanban - A Lean Approach to Agile Software Development\n\nKanban is an approach to agile software development that focuses on visualizing the workflow and increasing flow by limiting work in progress. Although Scrum is still the most popular agile method, Kanban has quickly proven to be an excellent complement or replacement in cases where Scrum is too difficult or simply not suitable. Kanban is highly flexible and strongly emphasizes evolution over revolution.\n\nIn this tutorial Henrik will go through the basics of Kanban, using many pictures and examples. He will also illustrate the similarities and differences between Kanban and Scrum, and how these techniques can be combined to get the best of both.\n\nAdam Skogman, Jayway\n\nAdam works as a Scrum Mentor and Java EE Architect, starting new Agile projects and helping out projects in dire straits. He finds that to make Agile work, you need to work on process, technology and tools, because process alone will not make you Agile. Adam is often called upon to talk about Java technology - especially on testing and Java performance. Among his engagements are some open-source projects. Adam is the lead of the open-source project \"DDSteps\", a data-driven extension to JUnit which enables you to separate test data from test code. DDSteps has become popular with both large companies (such as SonyEricsson, IBM, Sprint and PayPal) and many smaller businesses for integrating all the tools you need for end-to-end function testing of websites. Adam is also involved in the Qi4J and Spring LDAP projects.\n\nPresentation (27/1) : Introduction to Cloud Computing\n\nCloud Computing sounds fluffy, so what are the real-life benefits? And how can I start using the Cloud today, in my own projects? The first step: Getting more power at a low low cost How can we use the cloud today, by moving parts of our application or environment to the cloud? We'll share our hand-on experiences with developing using the cloud for everything from testing to deployment. The next step: Scaling out in the cloud The cloud brings new issues and concerns. How do you best store data if it's stored in distributed data centers? How can you ensure data consistency when ACID-style transactions are your biggest bottleneck? How will it affect your architecture that servers are added at any time?\n\nTutorial (26/1) : From Zero To Amazon Cloud in less then 3,5 Hours\n\nA walkthrough for Cloud beginners. Starts with an introduction to the services offered by Amazon, to give all a good understanding of what a Cloud really is. Then it's an all-out Cloud cookalong! We start with nothing and set up a cloud hosted infrastructure for a typical Java server application.\n\nFirst: Getting it to the Cloud.\n\nSecond: Using Amazon Cloud services.\n\nThird: Getting production ready!\n\nJevgeni Kabanov, ZeroTurnaround\n\nFor the last five years, Jevgeni has been the R&D lead of Webmedia, Ltd, the largest custom software development company in the Baltics. During that time, he has spearheaded the movement to decrease the development turnaround time. As a result, two products (JavaRebel and JspWeaver) were developed under the trademark ZeroTurnaround, of which Jevgeni is the technical lead. Both projects contributed directly to the immense reduction in turnaround time. Jevgeni is also a co-founder of the open source Aranea project.\n\nPresentation (27/1) : Do you really get class loaders?\n\nClass loaders are at the core of the Java language. Java EE containers, OSGi, NetBeans modules, Tapestry 5, Grails and many others use class loaders heavily. Yet when something goes wrong, would you know how to solve it? In this session we'll take a tour of the Java class loading mechanism, both from JVM and developer point of view. We'll see how different delegation systems are built, how synchronization works, what is the difference between finding classes and resources, what wrong assumptions has been made and are now supported. Next we will look at typical problems that you get with class loading and how to solve them. ClassNoDefError, IncompatibleClassChangeError, LinkageError and many others are symptoms of specific things going wrong that you can usually find and fix. For each problem we'll go through a hands on demo with a corresponding solution. Finally we'll take a look at the complicated class loading mechanisms like the ones used in OSGi and Tapestry 5. We'll look in detail at the benefits they have and problems they might cause.\n\nQuickie (27/1) : How to save 3-7 weeks a year!\n\nThis summer, over 1100 developers reported that they waste an average of one month per year waiting for builds and redeploys. In 10 minutes, we'll show you how to get that time back, without the need to re-engineer your applications or change the way your team works. It's quick, it's easy, it integrates with Maven, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA and Netbeans, supports all servlet and EJB containers, Spring framework, Struts, Stripes and Google Web Toolkit, and it pays for itself in two weeks -- meet JRebel 2.0 (formerly JavaRebel).\n\nVaclav Pech, JetBrains\n\nV√°clav is a programming enthusiast who's constantly seeking ways to make development more effective and enjoyable. He's particularly interested in server-side Java technologies, distributed systems, parallel programming, agile methodologies, modern programming languages, DSLs and of course IntelliJ IDEA.\n\nHe works for JetBrains as a senior software developer and a product evangelist. On the side, he's building GParallelizer, an opensource concurrency library, investigates the domains of neural networks, evolutionary programming and data mining. When not at work he spends his time with his family, hiking in the mountains or travelling.\n\nQuickie (27/1) : Life is Short: Code Fast\n\nThrough hands-on coding with Spring, Hibernate, JSF, SQL and of course Java, we'll demonstrate a few of the core concepts that help developers write better code faster. We'll explore Development by Intention, the benefits of truly deep and intuitive refactoring, Polyglot programming with cross-language support and error prevention with static code analysis as well as commenting on the value of highly intelligent editing, debugging and code assistance - all with supportive examples and code-based demonstrations using IntelliJ IDEA. To wrap up, we'll look at ways to enjoy coding as much as possible.\n\nPresentation (27/1) : Groovy actors and concurrent dataflow with GParallelizer\n\nLow-level concurrency handling is usually hard to get right. And it's not much fun either. In this hands-on session we will go through the concurrency options that GParallelizer library, an open-source concurrency library for Groovy, gives to your Groovy applications. We'll cover asynchronous collection processing, actors and other concepts, which aim to make your Groovy code concurrent with little effort. We'll create and show code examples in Groovy illustrating the principles of actors, parallel arrays and dataflow concurrency, while leveraging the DSLs offered by GParallelizer.\n\nCameron Purdy, Oracle\n\nCameron Purdy is Vice President of Development at Oracle. Prior to joining Oracle, Mr. Purdy was the CEO of Tangosol, whose revolutionary Coherence Data Grid product provides reliable and scalable data management across the enterprise. Mr. Purdy has over ten years of experience with Java and Java-related technology. As a software visionary and industry leader, Mr. Purdy is a frequent presenter at industry conferences and has received a number of awards in recognition of his contribution to the Java community, including twice being named as a JavaOne RockStar and being recognized in TheServerSide's \"Who's Who in Enterprise Java\". He regularly participates in industry standards development and is a specification lead for the Java Community Process.\n\nPresentation (27/1) : Keynote: Java, the Platform for the Future\n\nFifteen years ago, Java steamed into the software development consciousness. Since those early days, the Java platform has shown remarkable resiliency in adapting to changes in technology and markets over time. This success is powered by a broad and active community of developers and users. Today the Java platform faces new challenges. We will examine these challenges and the keys to meeting them in order to broaden Java adoption, improve its competitiveness and ensure its future.\n\nAnders Hammar, Devoteam Quaint\n\nAnders is a Maven expert, software architect, and CTO of Devoteam Quaint, working professionally with Java for more than ten years. Anders firmly believes that a good development infrastructure is necessary to allow for a developer to focus on solving the business needs, as well as developing good quality software. For the the last three to four years, he has focused on using Maven as the platform for such an environment. In his profession, Anders does Maven training and he has earlier talked about Maven at √òredev and Javaforum (Swedish JUG). Being a true believer of open source, Anders is also highly active within the Maven community.\n\nTutorial (26/1) : Advanced Maven Techniques\n\nApache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information. The theme of Maven is to standardize the build process and has successfully done so, leading to it being close to de facto standard in the open source world and within the enterprises. This session will focus on advanced dependency management, plugin management and lifecycle customization. All topics will be explained in theory and also shown in practice. Targeted audience is developers with knowledge and understanding of Maven basics such as the pom, artifact coordinates (GAV), the lifecycle concept, and Maven plugins and goals.\n\nFelipe Ga√∫cho, Netcetera AG\n\nFelipe Ga√∫cho is Senior Software Engineer with MsC in Artificial Intelligence and more than ten years of Java hands-on experience. He is a well known Brazilian JUG leader and open-source evangelist specialized in Java EE technologies. Felipe dedicated the last couple of years researching SOA applications implemented with the Glassfish Portfolio technologies. A result from that experience is a set of Dos & Don'ts of publishing RESTful web-services produced with the Jersey Framework consuming a EJB3.x business layer. When he is not coding, he prefers to listen reggae and travel around with his lovely wife Alena and his son Rodrigo.\n\nPresentation (27/1) : Domain Driven REST Web-Services\n\nRESTful Web-Services and Domain Drive Design (DDD) prevailed upon the \"SOA Era\", and now it is time to join those powerful techniques towards more agility for the Java developers. This session will demonstrate how to expose a Domain Model through REST-API based on the Java EE specification and the Glassfish technologies. The session will show a real world project where a business domain modeled as JPA Entities is serialized through a REST-API implemented with the Jersey framework. The server side constraints like security and robustness will be explained and proved good enough to be adopted in production. The special highlights of the session are the partial visibility of data produced with a minimum code, full data security and the serialization of data using XML and JSON formats. This presentation is a result of an open-source project being developed by the speaker, and the source code and artifacts demonstrated during the session will be fully available for the audience after the presentation. Java EE developers and architects are the target audience, specially the ones with previous experience in producing RESTful web-services.\n\nGuillaume Laforge, SpringSource Inc\n\nGuillaume Laforge is the project lead of Groovy, the highly popular and successful dynamic language for the JVM. He co-authored Manning's best seller \"Groovy in Action\" with Dierk K√∂nig, and is working for SpringSource (a division of VMWare) where he's working full time on cool and Groovy stuff. Guillaume worked hand in hand with the Google App Engine Java team before the official launch of the new platform to ensure that Groovy would run well on this new cloud. With this background in mind, he created Gaelyk, a lightweight toolkit for developing applications written in Groovy on Google App Engine, that he demonstrated at the Google I/O 2009 Conference. You can meet Guillaume at conferences around the world where he evangelizes the Groovy dynamic language, Domain-Specific Languages in Groovy, and the agile Grails web framework.\n\nPresentation (27/1) : Google Appengine Java: Groovy baby!\n\nIntroduced in April 2009, and made available to all developers last june, Google Appengine Java allows developers to leverage Google's cloud infrastructure to run their Java applications. With the Google Eclipse Plugin, as often demoed, it takes 5 minutes to put a GWT/GAE Java \"Hello World\" application in production: this talk will be about what can you do after these first 5 minutes of total bliss. The talk will cover Appengine Java's APIs, including recent features like XMPP and Task Queues, tools integration, limitations, how to run other JVM based languages used in the wild (Groovy, JRuby, Scala, Javascript), and show cool apps that have been developed with appengine. More it will present Gaelyk, a lightweight toolkit for easily developing applications in Groovy to be deployed on Google App Engine Java. We'll learn more about what the toolkit provides, how to leverage it for your own needs through some demos.\n\nTutorial (26/1) : The Groovy Ecosystem\n\nGroovy is currently known as the most popular and successful alternative language for the Java Virtual Machine. When you hear about this dynamic language, you may also think about Grails, the highly acclaimed web development stack. But Groovy and Grails are just the visible part of the iceberg of the Groovy Ecosystem.\n\nWait, there's more!\n\nIn this session, after a brief introduction to Groovy and some of its useful and cool features, we'll discover other aspects of the ecosystem, such as a hike into the land of Domain-Specific Languages, or examples of handy and powerful Groovy-based projects like HttpBuilder for taming the RESTful web, Spock for advanced Behaviour-Driven Development, Gant and Gradle for building your applications, and more.\n\nGet a chance to discover more about this exciting and rich Groovy Ecosystem!\n\nJohn Davies, Incept5\n\nJohn has been working in leading edge technology, mostly around investment banking for well over 25 years.

Java EE 5 adopted new principles (POJOs, annotations, default behavior) to ease the development paradigm and was certainly the biggest release ever. Java EE 6 also has a lot in store for server-side development - some more ease of development, a web profile, unified injection, lighter-weight components, RESTful integration, and major enhancements to the EJB, JPA and JSF specifications. This presentation will offer an overview of Java EE 6, new EJBs, simplified packaging, improved persistence layer, new API for RESTful services, a validation framework, a radical simplification of the web layer and ... many other improvements.\n\nTutorial (26/1) : The Java EE 6 Platform\n\nJ2EE was reliable and scalable but somewhat verbose and sometimes inflexible. Java EE 5 adopted new principles (POJOs, annotations, default behavior) to ease the development paradigm and was certainly the biggest release ever. Java EE 6 also has a lot in store for server-side development - some more ease of development, a web profile, unified injection, lighter-weight components, RESTful integration, and major enhancements to the EJB, JPA and JSF specifications.\n\nThis tutorial presentation will offer an overview of Java EE 6 through a run-down of the many new features. We will build an application from scratch via incremental steps. This will translate into a dozen demos each illustrating new features : managed beans, EJB 3.1 packaging and testing, JPA improvements, JSF with facelets, composite components and Ajax, exposing RESTful resources, and more.\n\nCharles Nutter, Engine Yard Inc\n\nCharles Oliver Nutter has been co-lead of the JRuby project for the past four years, working on performance and Java integration, and helping to coordinate community efforts.

There are hundreds of thousands of Ruby developers worldwide. But many of us live on the Java platform. Can we take advantage of Ruby's beauty without leaving the Java world behind? Yes we can! JRuby provides an excellent implementation of Ruby that can run Rails and other frameworks alongside your existing Java libraries and apps. You can build Rails apps that integrate with existing Java code, write components in Ruby, build desktop applications, and much more. JRuby provides excellent two-way integration with Java, allowing you to start using it today.\n\nIn this talk, we will explore JRuby, from getting set up to deploying real apps. We'll construct a small Rails application, front-end it with a GUI application, and deploy both. We'll play with JRuby's Java integration capabilities. And we'll explore a few unique features of JRuby like support for C libraries. By the end of this talk, you'll be ready to use JRuby for your own apps without leaving the Java platform behind.\n\nJeff Sutherland, Scrum, Inc.\n\nJeff is Chairman of the Scrum Training Institute, CEO of Scrum, Inc. and Senior Advisor and Agile Coach to OpenView Venture Partners.

Now mainly focused on spreading the word about the powers of graphs and preaching the demise of tabular solutions everywhere. Presents regularly at conferences such as JAOO, Oredev, QCon, and OSCON.\n\nPresentation (27/1) : The Benefits of Graph Databases\n\nMost applications today handle data that is deeply associative, i.e. structured as graphs (networks). The most obvious example of this is social networking sites, but even tagging systems, content management systems and wikis deal with inherently hierarchical or graph-shaped data. This turns out to be a problem because it?s difficult to deal with recursive data structures in traditional relational databases. In essence, each traversal along a link in a graph is a join, and joins are known to be very expensive. Furthermore, with user-driven content, it is difficult to pre-conceive the exact schema of the data that will be handled. Unfortunately, the relational model requires upfront schemas and makes it difficult to fit this more dynamic and ad-hoc data. A graph database uses nodes, relationships between nodes and key-value properties instead of tables to represent information. This model is typically substantially faster for associative data sets and uses a schema-less, bottoms-up model that is ideal for capturing ad-hoc and rapidly changing data. This session will introduce an open source, high-performance, transactional and disk-based graph database called ‚ÄúNeo4j‚Äù (http://neo4j.org), which frequently outperforms relational backends with >1000x for many increasingly important use cases.\n\nDan North, DRW Trading\n\nDan is a Senior Developer with DRW Trading, where he writes software and coaches teams in agile and lean methods. He believes in putting people first and writing simple, pragmatic software. He believes that most problems that teams face are about communication, and all the others are too. This is why he puts so much emphasis on \"getting the words right\", and why he is so passionate about behaviour-driven development, communication and how people learn. He has been working in the IT industry since he graduated in 1991, and he occasionally blogs at dannorth.net.\n\nTutorial (26/1) : Behaviour-Driven Development: Writing Software that Matters\n\nBehavior-driven development (BDD) is an evolution of the ideas behindagile software delivery. With its roots in test-driven development,domain-driven design, and automated acceptance testing, BDD focuses onthe ways an application is expected to work - its behaviour. Byconstantly reflecting on the varied points of view of differentstakeholders, BDD helps ensure that product owners and the developmentteam are in sync on what is really needed and what to work on next.\n\nIn this highly-interactive session, Dan North introduces theprinciples behind BDD and describes how it works in practice. He provides an overview of the methodology of BDD: understanding yourdomain and who your stakeholders are, identifying and exploring requirements, automating acceptance criteria, and delivering workingand tested software. Dan then looks at the nature of change and describes how to implement BDD in different contexts, including applying it to an in-flight project, managing distributed orlarge-scale development, and working with legacy systems. Dan encourages both experienced and novice agile managers and practitioners to join this session and bring with them their current challenges - and war stories.\n\nPresentation (27/1) : Why Your Agile Roll-Out is Failing\n\nYou read the books. You went to the talks. You even paid for the 3 day course. Then you rolled out Agile across the organization. What could possibly go wrong? Why, after 18 months, are you not seeing the better-faster-cheaper results they guaranteed you? And where can you get your money back? Rather than paying for yet another Agile consultant to come in and tell you how you're doing it all wrong, come along to Dan's talk about the most common failure modes he encounters in Agile adoption.\n\nJason van Zyl, Sonatype\n\nJason van Zyl is CTO of Sonatype and the founder of the Apache Maven project, the Plexus IoC framework, and the Apache Velocity project.

Joonas has been developing applications for the web since 1995 with a strong focus on Ajax and Java. He is the founder and CEO of ITMill, the company behind the Vaadin framework.\n\nPresentation (27/1) : RIA Security - Broken By Design\n\nRich Internet Applications (RIA) provide desktop-like usability with web deployment model. The benefits of this combination are obvious and RIA is now common a choice for the presentation layer in many applications. Unfortunately, moving logic from the server to an untrusted client may open up security holes that would not be present in the page-oriented \"Web 1.0\" architecture. In this presentation we will take a look at client- and server-side RIA architectures from the security angle, identify some of the most common security problems and discuss strategies for avoiding them. We'll go through some example applications implemented in both architectures and demonstrate the problems. Java-based RIA frameworks, Google Web Toolkit and Vaadin, are used in the examples, but the demonstrated principles are applicable to most other frameworks and languages as well.\n\nFrank Greco, Kaazing\n\nFrank D. Greco is the founder of the New York Java Special Interest Group (NYJavaSIG), one of the largest Java Users Groups (JUGs) on the planet.

Frank is both a Java community leader as well as a luminary technologist working for Kaazing.\n\nPresentation (27/1) : HTML 5 Communications - The New Network Framework for the Web\n\nThe HTML5 specification will clearly change the way in which we build applications for the Web. Google, Apple, Mozilla, Opera, Palm, et al, have all made large strides in supporting various components of HTML 5. The Communications section of this specification describes an exciting collection of new types of network communication mechanisms that will provide the underpinnings of the next generation of web applications. * WebSocket - A full-duplex single-socket connection over the web * Server-Sent Events - A formalization of web \"push\" but without polling * Cross-Domain Resource Sharing - Connect to multiple domains without a portal server * Inter-Document Messaging - Send messages among iframes on a page These features bring bi-directional, event-driven connectivity to web applications, remove the dependency on polling, allows the browser to be the aggregator of information across domains and facilitates mashups within the browser. We will provide an in-depth look into the use of these features particularly WebSocket and Server-Sent Events. And we'll discuss the techniques and technologies required to build Web applications with these new tools. We will also cover possible network architectures to integrate message brokers, popular data feeds and cloud applications using WebSockets.\n\nVadim Gurov, JetBrains\n\nVadim Gurov is a senior software developer at JetBrains and YouTrack project lead. He has a PhD degree in computer science and over ten years of web application development experience behind him. Vadim believes that language-oriented programming is set to become the next big step in software industry and works in touch with MPS team to create DSLs for database and web development..\n\nQuickie (27/1) : Practical Web Development with Language-Oriented Programming\n\nModern web developers face a ridiculous choice of technologies and frameworks for building web applications. However, most of these frameworks are based upon general-purpose programming languages. Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are still a rarity in a web developer's toolset. JetBrains is set to change that with Meta Programming System (MPS). Complemented by a stack of Java-inspired domain-specific languages for database and web development, MPS enables JetBrains developers to create highly competitive real-world applications.\n\nTo describe the unique experience with language-oriented programming (LOP), Vadim will showcase YouTrack - a keyboard-centric issue tracking web application that has become the first advanced product developed using MPS and JetBrains DSLs. We'll talk about our database DSL that saves developers from the hurdle of object-relational mapping; domain-specific implementation of JavaScript that delivers strong typing, true object orientation and automatic dependency detection; and other DSLs that constitute our web development language stack."
