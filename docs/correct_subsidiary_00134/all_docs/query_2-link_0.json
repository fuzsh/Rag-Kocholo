        "text": "News Facts\n\nOracle today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Tangosol Inc, a leading provider of reliable in-memory data grid software. Data grid software increases application performance by providing fast, distributed access to frequently used data. Tangosol's product, Coherence Data Grid, is a fundamental enabler for the rapidly growing space of extreme transaction processing (XTP), typical in, among others, Financial Services, Telecommunications, and Travel and Logistics industries. Coupled with Oracle Fusion Middleware, Oracle TimesTen and Oracle Database, the combination will provide an integrated platform for businesses moving to this new model of transaction processing.\n\n\"Together, Oracle and Tangosol create the industry's most comprehensive middleware for building applications that perform real time data analytics, grid based in-memory computations and high performance transactions,\" said Oracle Senior Vice President Thomas Kurian. \"Tangosol adds significant customer value to the Oracle Fusion Middleware infrastructure where rapid customer adoption of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), Web 2.0 and Event Driven Architecture (EDA) built on Oracle Fusion Middleware is driving the need for high performance, continuously available shared data services to offload and buffer analytic, compute and transaction processing cycles from backend core data processing services.\"\n\n\"Modern architectures like SOA, Web 2.0 and EDA are enabling more agile business processes and applications,\" said Tangosol CEO Cameron Purdy. \"However, those same architectures are driving the demand for high-performance access to shared data, creating a very heavy burden on backend data processing services. Oracle and Tangosol can together address the need for a comprehensive data virtualization strategy that can both relieve the load on backend infrastructures while maintaining or increasing performance.\""
