        "text": "Is anyone else disappointed that there is a two way password hash for the Oracle Community from Leveragesoft (http://oracleopenworldconnect07.leveragesoftware.com)? I would tend to bet that there is actually no hash at all and its just plain text in a database somewhere.\n\nIt kills me how many companies still run the risk of plain text passwords in the database.√Ç How many times have you had your credit card company read you your personalized pin back to you.√Ç That should never happen, they should have to put it into an application and it matches the one was hash in the database or LDAP server.√Ç I‚Äôd be happy to help them encryption or federation or any of the billions of solutions to the problem.\n\nBTW- Whatever Dan Norris posts on this, it was my point first that brought this up.\n\nIn the IOUG Fusion Task Force meeting this week, we were discussing what could be provided to build a better community around the Fusion Middleware world and it‚Äôs ever growing list of products and acquisitions. A lot of us are classic Oracle guys that have been doing Java, ADF, App Server, Portal, Discoverer, etc. since its first release. We‚Äôve always known the standard Oracle Metalink, Forums, and ListServs for Oracle help when we need it. Now with so many acquisitions it‚Äôs getting incredibly hard to catch up and the communities for many of the new products don‚Äôt exist.\n\nOne of the big questions that came up was where have all the developers gone. For some reason the term ‚ÄúThe Lost Developers‚Äù popped into my head, which of course popped the bad 80‚Äôs movie ‚ÄúThe Lost Boys,‚Äù and in turn this bad graphic. (Trust me you don‚Äôt want to try and understand whats in my head)\n\nBut in all seriousness, where did everyone go. I know a lot of the people went to start their own independent consulting shops, some stayed with Oracle, but what about the rest of the world? What about all the customers and other implementation partners? I went through, looked at the acquisition list, and couldn‚Äôt find user groups or message boards for many of them. Maybe I‚Äôm looking in the wrong places or haven‚Äôt been taught the secret handshake yet, but here is the list I came up with:\n\nAgile: Nothing\n\nAppForge: Palm and Windows Media Local User Groups, nothing centralized\n\nBharosa: Nothing\n\nTangosol: LCUG (http://wiki.tangosol.com/display/LCUG/Home)\n\nHotSip: Nothing\n\nSiebel (Analytics): ITtoolbox Group (http://siebel.ittoolbox.com/groups/technical-functional/siebel-analytics-l)\n\nSigmaDynamics: Nothing\n\nSleepycat: Nabble Forums (http://www.nabble.com/Berkeley-DB-f2899.html)\n\nStellent: Stellentforums.com and regional user groups\n\nContext Media: Nothing\n\nOblix: Nothing\n\nOctet String: Nothing\n\nThor Technologies: Nothing\n\nTimesTen: Nothing\n\nTripleHop: Nothing\n\nYes there are the Oracle boards, but many of them aren‚Äôt trolled by the experts of the acquired companies yet. So what happened? Where did everyone go? Right now I‚Äôm working on building a lot of pre-built virtual machines for my side project (thanks again for the people volunteering to help), but on the newer components I‚Äôm having to learn a ton as I go and it would be helpful to bounce ideas / questions off of people who have already been there and done that. I‚Äôm sure a lot of them are having the same problems now trying to deploy on to the Fusion Middleware stack.\n\nSo here it is, an open invite to come out of the corners and reveal yourselves. Where is everyone hiding? How can we build a better collaborative Oracle development world? I would love to hear people‚Äôs feedback. Maybe we need a myspace or facebook for Oracle people? I‚Äôm only half joking here, there sure are enough of us to keep it busy. What features would make it a kick ass collaboration environment? Forums? Wiki? Torrents? Instant Messaging? Desktop Sharing? Blogs Provider? Maybe just an Aggregator? Rent a VM development environments? Calendaring? Mapping? Presence? Ok, enough web 2.0 buzz words (crap, there was another one).\n\nCall me, email me, IM me, post comments here, I just want to figure out how to make it easier on all of us.\n\nI‚Äôm just going to post this up here because this is something I do all the time and for some reason it will never stick in my head. The idea is that I have a server root that I want to forward to another URL with mod_rewrite. Yeah, I know, I could just write it in mod_alias or a quick meta tag or JavaScript or whatever, but I live the clean mod_rewrite solution that I can bake right into a httpd.conf or .htaccess file. So here is it, whenever you want to forward something like: http:///www.mywebsite.com to http://www.mywebsite.com/pls/portal here it is:\n\nRewriteEngine On\n\nRewriteBase /\n\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/$ [NC]\n\nRewriteRule ^.*$ http://www.mywebsite.com/pls/portal [R,L]\n\nOK, enough, done‚Ä¶night.\n\nPS- As you can tell I‚Äôm a bit frustrated with myself over this one. It‚Äôs only about the 100th time I‚Äôve done something like this and I can never remember the syntax.\n\nAs some of you know, I was working on a side project a while ago to provide pre-built Oracle virtual machines and distribute them via torrents over the net. I talked a little bit about it back here. Well some people got wind of it and warned me that I would face problems with the Oracle licensing and it would be best if I didn‚Äôt move forward. Luckily, the Oracle licensing has been changed and I should be able to move forward. Also, Amazon‚Äôs S3 service is now providing torrent based seeding for files. Somehow their bandwidth bills are a lot less than mine (I guess when you buy in bulk you have quite the cost savings üòâ )\n\nThanks to the people that helped out the first time beta testing and then getting disappointed when I didn‚Äôt actually launch the thing. I promise this time will be different, if anyone wants to help out let me know. I‚Äôm geeked about this again!!!"
