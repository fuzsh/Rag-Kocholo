For decades, companies have been making business decisions based on transactional data stored in relational databases. However, beyond that critical data is a potential treasure trove of less structured data: weblogs, social media, email, sensors, and photographs that can be mined for useful information. This presentation will take a look at what Big Data is and means – and Oracle’s strategy for handling it.\n\nTom Kyte is a Senior Technical Architect in Oracle’s Server Technology Division. Tom is the Tom behind the AskTom column in Oracle Magazine, answering people’s questions about the Oracle database and its tools (http://asktom.oracle.com/). He is also the author of Expert Oracle Database Architecture (Apress, 2005/2009), Expert One on One Oracle (Wrox Press, 2001/Apress 2004), Beginning Oracle Programming (Wrox press, 2002/Apress 2004), and Effective Oracle by Design (Oracle Press, 2003). These are books about the general use of the database and how to develop successful Oracle applications.\n\nDBA TRACK: “Oracle Wait Event Tuning Using AWR”\n\nAttendees will learn how to review AWR and statspack reports to determine what portion of the database needs further tuning based on wait events. This presentation coalesces nearly 20 years of statspack and AWR analysis experience into a how-to guide for wait analysis using AWR reports.\n\nMike Ault has worked with Oracle since 1990 and is the author or co-author of over 24 Oracle-related books. Mike is a frequent presenter at Oracle conferences worldwide. Mike is the Oracle Guru for Texas Memory Systems, manufacturers of solid-state devices for enterprise level storage.\n\nDBA TRACK: “Virtualization and Oracle Databases”\n\nThis presentation provides a high-level overview of virtualization technologies and methodologies to discuss the options available for virtualizing Oracle databases and/or applications using Oracle databases. The advantages and disadvantages of different approaches, namely hosting the virtual machines in the public cloud or in-house, setting up templates, and configuring access will be discussed.\n\nLeslie Tierstein is an independent consultant specializing in service catalog management for enterprise IT organizations. She was recently employed by Cisco Systems in their Intelligent Automation Business Unit, responsible for providing training for the Cisco Cloud Portal product suite. She has extensive experience in implementing custom Oracle software applications, and has presented at NYOUG, ODTUG, IOUG and other Oracle conferences.\n\nDBA TRACK: “Do it Yourself Data Migration”\n\nData profiling tools are expensive and provide little value beyond what could be written in a day. ETL tools are complex, VERY expensive and built to support extremely complex migration environments. Data migration is the hidden nightmare of a project. Incorrectly managed, data migration can consume more resources than development. This presentation provides a roadmap for data migration, from data profiling to final loading, and incremental data updates. Several projects that had to move hundreds of GBs of information will be discussed. A simple mapping repository that was used to generate 100% of all mapping code will also be demonstrated.\n\nDr. Paul Dorsey is president of Dulcian, Inc. an Oracle consulting firm specializing in business rules and web-based application development and chief architect of Dulcian’s BRIM® tool. Paul has co-authored seven Oracle Press books on JDeveloper, UML Modeling, and Oracle database tools as well as PL/SQL For Dummies.

Attendees will learn about best practices to consider when consolidating into an Exadata environment including understanding Smart Scan readiness, presence of database hints, presence of database errors, presence of unruly queries, and the presence of unused data. This presentation examines several important deployment considerations through the lens of real-world customer experiences.\n\nKevin Courtney brings over twenty-five years of senior and executive information technology experience blending a set of consulting skills in business management, technology strategy, design and deployment, program and project management, product development and marketing across numerous industries He has developed and managed a data warehousing/business intelligence professional services practice.\n\nDBA TRACK: “Key Management and Sensitive Data for DBAs”\n\nMost DBAs want to do what they’re good at and enjoy: manage databases. However, securing the sensitive information that is stored in Oracle databases has become critical in our highly regulated world. Properly managing the keys that protect data that is encrypted in Oracle databases has become a big issue. In addition, DBAs need to consider sensitive data surrounding the Oracle database. For example, an Oracle database could encounter an error that would cause it to send information containing sensitive data into a trace file or the alert log. This presentation will discuss the general issues in encryption key management for DBAs and where sensitive data might reside in and around an Oracle database.\n\nJonathan Intner is an Oracle DBA by trade who started studying data and information security about 5 years ago. Over the past 20 years, he has been an Oracle DBA and *nix SA at a number of companies, mostly in the pharmaceutical arena. He currently works as a Solution Architect for Vormetric, a company that produces a comprehensive data security solution to protect customer data across applications, databases, file systems and storage architectures to defend against a broad set of threats to data, including admin abuse, rogue users, malware, physical theft and unintended user access.\n\nDEVELOPER TRACK: “Oracle Database Cloud Service”\n\nThis session provides an overview of the Oracle Database Cloud Service, which was introduced at Oracle Open World 2011 as part of Oracle’s Public Cloud. Attendees will learn about the architecture and features of this service, see some of the included business productivity applications, and get a demonstration of how to develop, test, and deploy Oracle Application Express applications and RESTful Web Services on the Oracle Public Cloud.\n\nMarc Sewtz is a Senior Software Development Manager for Oracle Application Express (APEX) in the Database Tools Group.

Plug-ins can be anything from a slider widget, to a star rating system, to just about anything. Why limit yourself to what the builder provides when you can expand by just “plugging-in?” This presentation shows how to take non-standard functionality and plug it into Application Express. This ability helps expand the capabilities of applications and make them more professional looking and easier for end users to perform their duties. In addition, Josh will discuss the basic steps of how to create plug-ins if the need ever arises.\n\nJosh Millinger graduated in 1995 from the University of Wisconsin with a BS in Computer Science before joining Oracle Corporation for an 11-year stint.

Michael has presented at Oracle Open World, Collaborate, Rocky Mountain Oracle Users Group Training Days, Midwest Oracle Users Group and Indiana Oracle Users Group.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION TRACK: “Exadata: Yes, You Still Need to Do Performance Tuning”\n\nWhen you purchase Exadata, the common thought is that once it is in place, all performance problems are fixed. While Exadata can speed up many queries in the beginning, this does not mean that the query runs faster due to well written code. In these cases, as you get more data there is the potential for these queries to degrade in performance, at times, exponentially. In other cases, there are queries that aren’t sped up when you move to Exadata and can even be slowed down. This presentation explores Exadata-related wait events and views along with common tips to quickly troubleshoot performance issues\n\nKathy Gibbs has over 18 years of IT work experience and over 12 years of DBA experience including architecting, design, development, implementation, monitoring, and disaster recovery of databases.

Since 2001, his primary focus has been on database, server, and application performance.\n\nDBA TRACK: Instrumentation: Why You Should Care\n\nIn our increasingly virtualized environments, it’s ever more difficult to diagnose application defects—especially performance defects that affect response time or throughput expectations. Runtime diagnosis of defects can be an unbearably complicated problem to solve once the application is sealed up and put into production use. But having excellent runtime diagnostics is surprisingly easy if you design the diagnostic features into the application from its inception, as it is being grown, like you would with any other desired application feature.\n\nCary Millsap is an entrepreneur, software technology advisor, software developer, and Oracle software performance specialist. His technical papers are quoted in many Oracle books, in Wikipedia, in blogs all over the world, and in dozens of conference presentations each month.

Sometimes, additional hardware doesn’t solve performance problems. When dealing with computer systems, XML documents are an effective method to communicate real time information between two or more computers. However, XML documents may become exceedingly large, thereby ?clogging up the pipe? using both excessive bandwidth and computing resources in an attempt to move the XML document from point A to point B. This presentation focuses on two techniques using Oracle’s XML DB and PL/SQL to demonstrate how to break up large XML documents into smaller ones, thus minimizing system resources and bandwidth during data transfer.\n\nColeman Leviter has presented at IOUG’s Collaborate ’07 – ’11, at Oracle Open World 10 and the upcoming Oracle OpenWorld 11.

Tao is an Oracle Certified Professional with a Master’s Degree in Computer Science.\n\nJune 2011 General Meeting\n\nKeynote\n\nDBA Track\n\nDevelopment Track\n\nKEYNOTE: How Will You Build Your Next System?\n\nIf you look at 10 modern systems you are likely to see 10 different architectures. Oracle is promoting the JavaEE based ADF, many users are moving to Oracle’s Application Express and the rest of us are still running on Oracle Forms and wishing there was an easy alternative. Outside of Oracle everyone seems to be touting SOA and Open Source. Where does the cloud fit in? Given the fragmented world we live in with no single architecture emerging as an industry standard, how do you decide on a good development platform? Given the ever evolving environments, how do you avoid building a system that is obsolete before it is even built? This presentation will attempt to answer some of these questions.\n\nDr. Paul Dorsey is president of Dulcian, Inc. an Oracle consulting firm specializing in business rules and web-based application development and chief architect of Dulcian’s BRIM® tool.

There are sizable benefits to be reaped by this including lower hardware and support costs, increased performance and decreased down-time. Oracle?s Real Application Clusters (RAC) is a key enabling technology that delivers carrier-grade reliability at a fraction of the cost. However, RAC is not designed as a solution to all problems, and one must understand its strengths and weaknesses to see where it can be used effectively. This session will cover an introduction to RAC architecture that focuses on the key components that can help systems architects understand where to employ it in the enterprise, and real-world solutions that reduce TCO.\n\nDr. Steele Arbeeny, PhD is Director of Strategic Business Technologies for GL Associates, Steele develops custom systems to ensure efficient data integration and system accuracy.

The optimizer can come up with several new execution plans and can cause severe performance issues as the new plans are not verified against regression. This presentation addresses the challenge of eliminating/minimizing these issues using the Oracle 11g new feature – SQL Plan Management (SPM). This feature uses a preventive mechanism to automatically control SQL plan evolution with the help of what are called SQL plan baselines. The SPM’s job is to capture and evaluate the execution plans over time and build SQL plan baselines containing only efficient execution plans. When a new plan is found for a SQL statement it will not be used until it has been verified by the database to have comparable or better performance than the current plan. This presentation also explains how to automatically identify and tune bad performing SQL without the manual intervention of DBAs, using the Automatic SQL Tuning Advisor. The Advisor also automatically tests SQL profiles and can automatically implement them, if configured. The Advisor targets SQL statements for the automatic tuning based on AWR Top SQL identification.\n\nSameer Malik has been working as Oracle DBA for over 7 years and specializes in Oracle database performance tuning including instance, application and SQL tuning.

He presents on APEX at various conferences nationwide.\n\nDEVELOPER TRACK: Unleash the Value of Data in your OEM Repository\n\nAccess to timely and comprehensive database-related historic data is essential for many DBA activities. The OEM repository not only stores the data for dozens of pre-defined metrics, but also allows easy expansion and customization with User Defined Metrics (UDM). Customization of retention and collection parameters provides the flexibility to address a wide array of DBA problems. Since the OEM repository resides on Oracle, the full power of SQL and PL/SQL as well as all built-in SQL and PL/SQL functions and packages can be used. Furthermore, even greater customization and flexibility can be achieved by creating data structures and packages (in a separate DB user/tablespace). This presentation emphasizes reliance on mathematical verification for DBA “theories.” It includes examples of ad-hoc issues that can be solved effectively with direct access to OEM repository structures. The presentation also covers a more complex enterprise-wide Oracle tablespace size forecasting utility.\n\nIordan K.

But it is also a source of a lot of mystery, myths, and misconceptions. This presentation will explain in clear terms what cache fusion can or can’t do by traversing the course of a buffer from the disk to the instance and then to the others. Also covered will be the different states of the buffer, the global locking mechanism, the need for a CPU and I/O as opposed to a super-fast interconnect, the cause of the different global cache related wait events, and how they can be resolved. All will be shown with live demos.\n\nArup Nanda is the Principal Database Architect at Starwood Hotels.

Implementing a sustainable data masking program in a modern enterprise environment can be surprisingly challenging—not just technically and organizationally, but culturally. The reactions and concerns you may encounter from your development and QA teams are understandable. You’re not just introducing new controls over confidentiality exposures in development and testing systems. You’re shutting off developers’ and testers’ unfettered access to live customer Production data—something that’s been quite normal and convenient for them to date, something they think they just can’t do their jobs without. Any project is only as successful as its level of buy-in from all involved. Getting colleagues to “do things a little differently” than they have traditionally means getting them on board early and anticipating their concerns. This presentation recounts lessons learned from years of implementing data masking programs at some very large companies.\n\nIlker Taskaya is a product manager for DMsuite, a web application data masking product, at Axis Technology, LLC. He manages the data masking product team at Axis, including services delivery and product development.

He founded and is still happily employed by SkillBuilders, a consulting and training services firm.\n\nDBA TRACK: “Database Security Solutions in the Cloud and Outsourced Environments”\n\nOne of the biggest concerns about the cloud is the threat of data being stolen. The cloud is a high risk environment that decreases the database administrators’ ability to control the flow of sensitive data. Because cloud introduces risk, exposure of database encryption keys becomes particularly vulnerable. Enterprises are currently on their own in deciding how to apply the principles of PCI data protection (e.g. segregation of regulated data) when reducing costs with virtualization or cloud computing, or reducing PCI exposure with tokenization and encryption. Tokenization eliminates keys by replacing sensitive data with random tokens to mitigate the chance that thieves can do anything with the data if they get it. This session will discuss new methods for protecting the entire data flow across systems in a cloud environment while minimizing the need for cryptographic services.\n\nUlf Mattson created the innovative architecture of the Protegrity database security technology.

Oracle used UIX in JDeveloper 9i to build E-Business Suite applications up through release 12i. Then Oracle transformed UIX components into standard JSF components and called the new component set “ADF Faces,” which evolved into ADF Faces Rich Client (ADF Faces RC). Oracle is now using ADF Faces RC to create Oracle Fusion Applications, but you can also use it to create custom web applications. This presentation examines the components available in ADF Faces RC. It explains how to use native ADF Faces RC features such as skins, internationalization support, and built-in Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX, also called Partial Page Rendering). Since an important aspect of web page design is managing screen real estate, this presentation explores how to achieve the perfect layout using the ADF Faces RC layout components. The presentation demonstrates container component techniques such as modifying the standard tab order and introduces the Data Visualization Tools (DVT) components, which provide super-rich, Web 2.0 functions such as interactive graphs, Gantt charts, pivot tables, and hierarchy viewers.\n\nPeter Koletzke is a technical director and principal instructor for Quovera, in Mountain View, California, and has over 26 years of industry experience.

Deploying a Java EE web application consists of wrapping all application files into a single Java archive file (the EAR, enterprise application archive) and then copying this file to the application server. The Oracle WebLogic Server (WLS, formerly, Oracle Containers for Java EE–OC4J) is a standard Java EE runtime process to which you deploy Java-based applications for use in a web runtime environment. This presentation explores the process of deploying to an Oracle WebLogic Server server. It outlines JDeveloper utilities and profiles that help you create an EAR file with all required libraries. The presentation then explains how to deploy the application using JDeveloper. It also discusses the benefits of and techniques for testing deployment on a local standalone server. In addition, the presentation describes and demonstrates the deployment services of the WLS console and why you might choose it to deploy an application instead of using JDeveloper.\n\nPeter Koletzke is a technical director and principal instructor for Quovera, in Mountain View, California, and has over 26 years of industry experience.

However, it becomes a challenge in the RAC environment with many sessions connecting and\n\ndisconnecting from multiple instances. Combined with this is the use of connection pools that can have data from\n\nmultiple applications, making it impossible to pinpoint a specific application. Attendees of this session will learn\n\nhow to use Automatic Enablement of tracing, combining the traces across multiple instances via trcsess, filtering\n\nout the relevant applications from a set of traces, and analyzing through tools like tkprof or Trace Analyzer. All of\n\nthese tools are available free from Oracle and will be shown with live demos including 11g.\n\nArup Nanda is the Principal Database Architect at Starwood Hotels.

In 2003,\n\nhe was the Oracle DBA of the Year.\n\nDBA TRACK: Database Performance Made Easy Through Graphics\n\nThis presentation begins with a discussion of the use of sample data to create Active Sessions History (ASH). ASH is\n\ndense, multidimensional data, which can make it difficult to analyze. To overcome this roadblock, ASH can be\n\nsimplified using a metric called Average Active Sessions (AAS). AAS shows the load on the database and allows you\n\nto drill down with precision and clarity into the cause of each bottleneck. Most often, bottlenecks are caused by poorperforming\n\nSQL statements. For analyzing suboptimal SQL statements, Mr. Hailey will demonstrate how to lay out the\n\nquery graphically in a Visual SQL Tuning (VST) diagram. Through the VST, it is possible to quickly visualize any\n\ncoding errors in the query, discover flaws in the underlying database schema and, most importantly, find the best\n\nexecution path through the query.\n\nKyle Hailey has been in the industry for a decade and a half and working with Oracle for over 13 years, having spent\n\ntime in support, porting, benchmarking, and kernel development at Oracle. After creating tools to improve high-end\n\nperformance monitoring such as direct SGA attach and interactive graphic displays of performance data, he redesigned\n\nthe Oracle Enterprise Manager 10g performance pages to be graphically oriented and wait-interface centric. He now\n\nworks at Embarcadero on their suite of performance tuning and monitoring tools. He is a member of the Oak Table and\n\nco-author of Oracle Insights: Tales of the Oak Table.

The reviewed application domain is\n\na large scale trickle feed ETL for very high volume reporting, also including a variety of smaller transactional and adhoc\n\nquery systems. Mr. Werman will discuss porting and running a large mature ODS and reporting data warehouse\n\nfrom Oracle 10g to Exadata. Migration strategies, tuning, and application re-architecture will also be covered.\n\nAaron Werman is a senior architect at a large prime brokerage and architect for the common data warehouse and its\n\ntechnical strategy and performance. He has deep experience in VLDB, Oracle, and heterogeneous systems. (And has\n\nworked on all roles in Oracle applications going back to Oracle 5.)\n\nDEVELOPER TRACK: Analytic Functions are Cool!\n\nHave you ever had to compute the Top-N records of a result set using SQL ? This is extremely difficult to do using straight SQL. To answer such a question would require multiple SQL queries, a very mangled and complicated SQL query, or procedural programming logic. In contrast, analytic functions make answering these types of questions trivial. They also make such database queries faster and more efficient. This presentation will demonstrate how to use most of the Analytic functions to move backward and forward within a result set, compute running totals and Top N queries, and pivot database tables (turn rows in a result set into columns).\n\nMichael Davis has over 15 years of Information Technology experience. He is the President of OmegaSoft, LLC, a Software Development and Data Warehousing consulting company located in Bloomfield Connecticut that provides services for mid-size and large businesses. He has written Oracle technical articles and has presented at NYOUG.\n\nDEVELOPER TRACK: Achieving Great Web Application Performance Using ONLY SQL and PL/SQL\n\nThe two main reasons for performance degradation in web application architecture are:\n\n1. Excessive round trips between the database and the application server\n\n2. Large pages sent from the application server to the client\n\nThis presentation demonstrates a 100% “thick database” approach (virtually no code in the application server).\n\nUsing this approach provided very good performance in the server as well a huge (10x) reduction in network traffic in comparison with standard web applications. This architecture was developed to support the budget and finance system for the country of Ethiopia and has been productized as BRIM®-UI.\n\nDr. Paul Dorsey is president of Dulcian, Inc. an Oracle consulting firm specializing in business rules and web-based application development and chief architect of Dulcian’s BRIM® tool.
