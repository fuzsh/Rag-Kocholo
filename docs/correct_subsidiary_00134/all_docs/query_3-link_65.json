        "text": "Version 5.1.1 Release Notes\n\nAlerts\n\n22590: SNMP traps sent by RTView Enterprise did not contain alert info\n\nIn previous releases, SNMP traps sent by RTView Enterprise alert notifications did not include all of the fields in the MIB. This has been fixed. SNMP traps can now be configured in the Configuration Application and match the new MIB defined in RTVAPM_HOME\\common\\lib.\n\n23189: Included my_alert_actions scripts in all projects\n\nRTView has been enhanced to include the my_alert_actions scripts in all project directories for ease of use.\n\n23844: Enhance alert notification configuration.\n\nAlert Notifications have been enhanced to support several new actions and a better configuration interface. For each notification, you can select one or more of the following actions: 1. Execute Script - This wil exectue the my_alert_actions*.bat/sh scripts in the project directory. This is the same action that was used in the previous releases when a notification was enabled. 2. Execute Java Method- This will execute a custom java command. 3. Send Email - This will send an email to one or more recipients. 4. Send SNMP Trap - This will issue an SNMP trap as described in RTVAPM_HOME\\common\\lib\\SL-RTVIEW-EM-MIB.txt. 5. Other - This will execute any command supported by our core product. 6. Conditional - This will allow you to execute different commands based on values in the alert. For example, you could email Jvm alerts to the system administrator and Ems alerts to the TIBCO administrator. The user interface in the Configuration Application has also been enhanced with better descriptions of additional configuration needed for the selected actions. Upgrade Notes In previous releases, any notification other than executing the my_alert_actions scripts had to be configured on the CUSTOM PROPERTIES tab of the Configuration Application. If you are running a project configured with a previous release that has alert notifications defined in the CUSTOM PROPERTIES tab, they will continue to work as they did before with no changes. However, if you want to use the new Alert Notification configuration page, you will need to first delete the CUSTOM PROPERTIES for alert notifications, then recreate them in the Alert Notification page. Otherwise, the CUSTOM PROPERTIES will override the settings in the Alert Notification page.\n\n24078: Alert Renotification interval default value corrected\n\nIn previous releases, the Renotification Interval in the Configuration Application incorrectly listed the default value as 300 seconds. This has been fixed. The default is now set to 0. Users must set it to a value greater than 0 in order to issue renotifications.\n\n24187: Alert overrides with multiple indexes fixed for HTML UI\n\nThe HTML UI now supports alert overrides with multiple indexes.\n\nConfiguration\n\n23516: Support Configuration Application for HA servers\n\nThe Configuration Application and Rest API for editing properties have been enhanced to support editing High Availability projects. In order to edit a High Availability project, the Configuration Application (rtvadmin servlet) must be configured for High Availability as follows: - When accessing the Configuration Application in jetty, no additional configuration is needed. It will automatically be configured for High Availability if the server is run with -haprimary or -habackup. - When hosting the Configuration Application on an application server, edit the update_wars.bat (or .sh) file in the projects\\rtview-server directory, set HOST to the PRIMARYHOST value and HA_HOST to the BACKUPHOST value. Then run update_wars and deploy the rtvadmin war file to your application server. - To configure an HA pair of RTViewDataServers via the RTViewCentral Configuration Application, make sure that the RTViewCentral connection to the RTViewDataServer is using a fault-tolerant URL. Properties saved in Configuration Application or via the Rest API will be applied to both the primary and backup servers. Therefore, the primary and backup servers must be able to run with identical properties. In the case where drivers and other third party jars are located in different places on the primary and backup systems, you must add a directory in the same location on each system, copy the jars into that directory and reference that directory in the classpath entries so that the same path can be used for both systems. The Restart Servers option in the Configuration Application and Rest API will restart both the primary and backup, one right after the other to apply the properties. The updatePropertiesOnServers option in the Rest API will update properties on both the primary and backup, one right after the other. The Configuration Application (rtvadmin servlet) must be connected to both the primary and backup servers in order to support editing. If you get a not connected error, be sure that both the primary and standby servers are running and accessible from the Configuration Application.\n\n23584: Tab key now works for mqmon's Channel Filter field\n\nIn MQMon, the Tab key now works when adding new Channel filters\n\n23641: Support for updating properties via rest api\n\nRTView has been enhanced with a rest api for editing solution package properties. This is to support the following use cases: 1. Importing an initial set of connections into the Configuration Application. This is useful in the case where there are a lot of connections and adding them via the Configuration Application ui will be too time consuming. Once the connections are imported using the rest api, all further editing can be done in the Configuration Application. 2. Dynamic updating of connections via automated process. These connections will only be updated via the automated process and will not be included in the Configuration Application. Connections will be applied without requiring a restart of the data server. Solace and TIBCO Enterprise Message Service properties are editable in the new rest api. Other solution packages properties will be added soon. A sample application has been added to all deliverables that shows how to use the rest api under rtvapm\\sampleapps\\propeditor. See the README.txt in that directory for instructions on using the rest api.\n\n23869: Fixed error in log file after saving WSM configuration\n\nAn unnecessary json element is no longer saved to the properties file for the IBM WebSphere solution package.\n\n23892: Single sign-on disabled for the Configuration Application and HTML UI\n\nIn previous releases, the Configuration Application and the new HTML UI were configured for single sign-on. When a user logged into the HTML UI as rtvuser then tried to open the Configuration Application they would get a 403, not authorized error since the Configuration Application requires an rtvadmin login. This has been fixed by disabling single sign-on. Now, the user is prompted for a separate login for the Configuration Application.\n\n23941: Can now restart data server without changing configuration\n\nServers can now be restarted from the Projects page even if no changes have been made that require a restart.\n\n23965: Config UI now prevent users from using \"default\" domain for hawk\n\nIn previous releases, the Configuration Application TIBCO Hawk Add Connection dialog saved an invalid property when the Domain field was set to default. This has been fixed by preventing the Domain field from being set to default. For connections to the default TIBCO Hawk domain, use a dash (-) in the Domain field instead.\n\n23996: Changed Sender tab in Configuration Application to use Collector in labels\n\nThe SENDER tab in the Configuration Application has been updated to use the term collector instead to be consistent with the RTViewDataCollector product name.\n\n24001: Path to custom directory now consistent across all RTView deliverables\n\nThe RTViewDataServer project has been enhanced to include the custom directory in projects\\custom. This directory contains sample custom function, command, app and rtview handlers. The custom command handler contains an outputAlertNotification method that can be optionally be executed for alert notifications. The custom directory in the following deliverables has been moved to projects\\custom: TIBCO EMSMonitor TIBCO BWMonitor TIBCO BEMonitor OCMonitor\n\n24032: Configuration Application updated to handle new Solace data acquisition.\n\nThe solace connection dialog in the Config UI now supports HA pairs and is also able to use the stats pump connection for non-cloud vmr's.\n\nDistribution\n\n23737: Version now available from HTML UI\n\nUsers can now see the version of RTView from the HTML UI by clicking on the product name at the top left.\n\n23814: Cleaned webapps directory in bundled apache Tomcat\n\nIn the previous release, the webapps directory of the bundled Apache Tomcat contained extraneous RTView demo .war files. These have been removed.\n\nGeneral\n\n23624: Configuration Application now catches Data Server's memory sizes without a unit (e.g., m or g)\n\nIn the Configuration Application, the Data Server's initial memory and max memory fields now have additional error checking to help ensure that only valid values are saved.\n\n23834: Export to Excel no longer fails\n\nThe export to Excel feature now works reliably on tables in the rtview-central and rtview-solmon UIs\n\n23837: No Date Picker in filter options for timestamp columns\n\nIn Component Displays, all date columns in all tables were formatted as strings, which disabled all date-specific options in the table header's menu. Now date-specific options are available in all Component Displays.\n\n23928: Corrected scrolling behavior of HTML UI in FF and Edge\n\nA bug has been fixed that affected the vertical scrolling behavior of the HTML UIs in Firefox and MS Edge. Now the left-hand navigation panel and the main display panel each has its own vertical scrollbar, as expected. This bug did not affect Chrome.\n\n24099: Displays now support dynamically changing CIs\n\nAdditions and deletions of elements are now reflected in the filter drop-downs of all Component Displays. By default, lists update once per minute.\n\n24167: Grey out rows for all tables with expired rows.\n\nExpired rows are now grayed out in all components displays with an applicable table.\n\nPlatform Support\n\n23961: Rename ActiveSpaces to ActiveSpaces 2 in Navigation Tree and Configuration Application\n\nThe RTView monitor for TIBCO ActiveSpaces 2.x has been renamed to \"ActiveSpaces 2\" in the thin client navtree and the configuration application. Previously it was \"ActiveSpaces\".\n\nRTVMGR\n\n24166: Dataserver drop down on the Cache Table component display no longer empty\n\nIn Firefox, the Data Servers in the Data Servers dropdown on the Cache Table display were invisible. This has been fixed.\n\n24232: RTView Data Servers Table now sorted by Name column by default\n\nThe table on the Data Servers display is now sorted by name of data server by default.\n\n24233: Drilldown on RTView Data Servers Table now selecting correct dataserver\n\nA drilldown from the RTView Data Servers Table will once again select the correct data server. In the previous release, the first data server in the list was always selected.\n\nRTView Core Functionality\n\nConfiguration\n\n23886: Fixed bug effecting dynamic update of connection definitions\n\nAn issue that prevented connection definitions from being dynamically updated has been fixed.\n\nDisplay Server\n\n24123: Support 'nosniff' header in thin client in IE11\n\nA problem has been fixed which prevented the thin client Classic UI from rendering displays correctly in IE11 when the web server set the X-Content-Type-Options:nosniff response header. No other supported browsers were affected by this issue. Site administrators may configure a web server to send the X-Content-Type-Options:nosniff response header for security reasons. With this fix the thin client is not affected by the presence or absence of that header, which is the correct behavior. A related note for Tomcat users: In standalone Tomcat, the X-Content-Type-Options:nosniff response header is set by enabling the httpHeaderSecurity filter in tomcat's conf/web.xml file. By default, that filter also sets the X-Frame-Options:DENY response header. That setting will disable the thin client even with the fix described in this release note. To avoid that problem, tomcat should be configured to set the X-Frame-Options response header to SAMEORIGIN rather than DENY, to allow pages hosted by the same tomcat instance (only) to load thin client displays in iframes. So to set X-Content-Type-Options:nosniff and X-Frame-Options:SAMEORIGIN, the httpHeaderSecurity filter should be configured as follows intomcat's conf/web.xml file: <filter> <filter-name>httpHeaderSecurity</filter-name> <filter-class>org.apache.catalina.filters.HttpHeaderSecurityFilter</filter-class> <async-supported>true</async-supported> <init-param> <!-- allow use in iframe on pages with same origin --> <param-name>antiClickJackingOption</param-name> <param-value>SAMEORIGIN</param-value> </init-param> </filter>\n\nDistribution\n\n24040: Update bundled Apache Tomcat 8.5.x to 8.5.41\n\nThe version of the bundled Apache Tomcat has been updated to 8.5.41 (previous was 8.5.35).\n\nScripts\n\n23594: Added \"status_servers.bat/.sh\" convenience scripts\n\nThe following scripts have been added: RTViewCentral\\bin\\status_servers.bat RTViewCentral\\bin\\status_servers.sh RTViewDataCollectorSP\\status_collector.bat RTViewDataCollectorSP\\status_collector.sh RTViewDataServerSP\\status_server.bat RTViewDataServerSP\\status_server.sh RTViewSolaceMonitor\\bin\\status_servers.bat RTViewSolaceMonitor\\bin\\status_servers.sh\n\n24088: HA support for rtvadmin in update_wars scripts\n\nThe HA_HOST parameter is now supported when updating the rtvadmin war files.\n\nSolution Package\n\n23800: Data Cache misconfiguration corrected\n\nPreviously the rowExpiredIndexColumns attribute of a cache created by the Data Cache was misconfigured. This is no longer the case.\n\nApache Kafka\n\n23966: New key metrics and new alerts for kafka\n\nThe following alerts have been added to RTView Kafka Monitor: Alert - Description KafkaBrokerFetchRequestsPerSecHigh - Fetch Requests per second exceeds threshold for broker KafkaBrokerProduceRequestsPerSecHigh - Produce Requests per second exceeds threshold for broker KafkaConsumerRecordsConsumedRateHigh - Consumer records consumed rate exceeds threshold KafkaProducerRecordSendRateHigh - Producer record send rate exceeds threshold KafkaZookeeperCpuPercentHigh - CPU percentage reported by the JVM is above the limits defined for that Zookeeper KafkaZookeeperMemoryUsedPercentHigh - Percentage of heap memory used relative to the maximum heap available is above the limits defined for that Zookeeper Note also the alert KafkaConsumerMsgsPerSecHigh has been renamed KafkaConsumerRecordsConsumedRateHigh to reflect more accurately its metric. The following Key Metrics have been added to RTView Kafka Monitor: CI Type - Key Metric KAFKA-BROKER - Fetch Request Rate KAFKA-BROKER - Produce Request Rate KAFKA-BROKER - Message In Rate KAFKACONSUMER - Records Consumed Rate KAFKA-PRODUCER - Record Send Rate KAFKA-ZOOKEEPER - CpuPercent KAFKA-ZOOKEEPER - MemoryUsedPercent The following changes have been made to RTView Kafka Monitor history tables: 1. A new index column client-id has been added to KAFKA_CONSUMER 2. The column time_stamp has been moved to the beginning of the table for these tables: KAFKA_TOPICS_BY_CONSUMER KAFKA_TOPICS_BY_SERVER KAFKA_TOPICS_BY_TOPIC KAFKA_TOPICS_BY_TOPIC_CONSUM KAFKA_TOPICS_BY_TOPIC_SERVER Note these changes will cause previously saved history to be invalidated.\n\n24089: New alerts for Kafka missing from HTML UI Alert Administration display.\n\nThe following Kafka alerts were missing from the Alert Admin displays. KafkaZookeeperMemoryUsedPercentHigh KafkaZookeeperCpuPercentHigh KafkaConsumerRecordsConsumedRateHigh KafkaProducerRecordSendRateHigh KafkaBrokerFetchRequestsPerSecHigh KafkaBrokerProduceRequestsPerSecHigh This has been fixed.\n\nIBM Websphere MQ\n\n23932: MODEL Queues may now be queried if desired\n\nPreviously it was not possible to to query a MODEL queue without undesirable side effects. This is no longer the case, and it is possible to query MODEL queues, if desired, without the undesirable side effects.\n\n23934: MQMON default filter values now set correctly\n\nPreviously in MQMON, the default Channel and Queue Filter Values were not explicitly initialized to the correct default value. They are now set correctly, thus requiring no further action from the user, if they wish to use the default values for the filters.\n\nSolace\n\n23825: New filter defaults for SolaceEventModule\n\nThe SolaceEventModule configuration has been enhanced with improved defaults for the alert and event filters in RTVAPM_HOME\\solmon\\soleventmodule\\soleventmodule.properties. Additionally, several commented out sample filters have been added for different monitoring scenarios.\n\n23962: New statspump data source for Solace.\n\nThe Solace Stats Pump Data Source has been integrated into the RTView Solace Monitor. This new data source supports HA Broker Pairs and multi-threaded SEMP XML response parsing which improves Data Server performance. The Solace Stats Pump Data Source is used by default in the RTView Configuration Application. Cloud Brokers are the only type of Solace Brokers that are using exclusively the HTTP Data Source.\n\n23963: Output Solace SEMP data to Influx DB\n\nThe Solace monitor has been enhanced to send monitoring data to InfluxDB. The configuration requires edition of the stats-receiver.properties file, located in the project directory, to define the list of metrics to store in Influx DB and the IP address and port of the InfluxDB platform to store the data. Please refer to the documentation for the specific configuration steps.\n\n23964: Output Solace SEMP data from Solace Stats Pump to a Solace Broker\n\nThe Solace Stats Pump can be configured to execute in isolation and send monitoring data from multiple Brokers to a designated Broker. This configuration will not downgrade the performance of the monitored Brokers if the Broker that will receive the monitoring data is exclusively doing this task. The steps to configure Solace Stats Pump to send monitoring data to a Solace Broker are the following: - Define the Solace Brokers to be monitored by editing the file appliance_config_demo.xml - Define the monitoring data to be polled by editing the file pollers_sl.xml - Define the poller groups that will be used by editing the file groups_sl.xml See the Solace documentation for further reference on how to configure Stats Pump for sending monitoring data to a Solace Broker.\n\n23983: Removed calculated rates from SolVpns cache\n\nCalculated rates from SoVpns cache have been replaced by the metrics delivered by Solace. The SOL_VPNS table from history should be dropped and recreated with the appropriate table create sql sentence you can locate in the rtvapm\\solmon\\dbconfig directory.\n\n23985: User and some event-driven boolean metrics added to SolClients cache\n\nUser and boolean fields associated with one-show events have been added to Solace Client metrics. These booleans are: eliding-enabled, large-message-event-raised, max-eliding-topics-raised, message-too-big-event-raised, parse-error-event-raised\n\n23994: Topic and Queue Rates added to the SolEndpointStats cache\n\nRequests for message flow from Solace Topics and Queues have been added. These requests query all available Endpoints at once without the need of requesting this information per Endpoint.\n\n23998: Added os-physical-interface to SolApplianceInterfaces cache\n\nThe os-physical-interface for each Broker Interface has been introduced into the SolApplianceInterfaces cache. This metric will be exposed in the Solace Interface Summary display from the Solace Monitor.\n\n24015: New broker and endpoint alerts\n\nThe following new alerts have been added to the Solace monitor: - SolBrokerNoValidDestination alert, which will be triggered as an alarm alert when there exist currently invalid destinations in the broker. (Delta of discard-nodest is non-zero). - SolBrokerNoQueueFound alert, which which will be triggered as an alarm alert when there are discarded queues in the broker. (Delta of discard-queue-not-found is non-zero). - SolEndpointNoBridgeClient alert, which will be triggered as an alarm alert when no binds for the Solace Endpoint exist (bind-count is zero). - SolBrokerNoSubscriptionMatch alert, which will be triggered as an alarm alert when there are no current subscription matches (Delta of no-subscription-match is non-zero). - SolEndpointNoBridgeTopic alert, which will be triggered as an alarm alert when there are no topics subscribed to the Queue (topic-subscription-count is zero). Limitation of SolBrokerNoValidDestination, SolBrokerNoQueueFound and SolBrokerNoSubscriptionMatch Alerts: The request XML is a system level request. The cloud logon credentials will not have permission to execute this request, so this alert will not be executed for Cloud Brokers.\n\n24033: Not clearable event module alerts now clear after expiration time\n\nIn the previous release, SolEventModule alerts that were based on non-clearable events sometimes did not clear. This has been fixed.\n\n24055: Replaced calculated rates from SolBridgeStats cache with Solace provided rates\n\nCalculated rates from SolBridgeStats cache have been replaced by the metrics delivered by Solace. The SOL_BRIDGE_STATS table from history should be dropped and recreated with the appropriate table create sql sentence you can locate in the rtvapm\\solmon\\dbconfig directory.\n\n24056: Replaced delta/rate calculated metrics with Solace provided CSPF rates\n\nThe calculated rates for Solace CSPF Neighbors have been replaced by Solace calculated rates. The SOL_CSPF_NEIGHBOR table from history should be dropped and recreated with the appropriate table create sql sentence you can locate in the rtvapm\\solmon\\dbconfig directory.\n\n24057: Rename calculated rates from SolClientStats cache with those from Solace\n\nCalculated rates from SolClientStats cache have been replaced by the metrics delivered by Solace. The SOL_CLIENT_STATS table from history should be dropped and recreated with the appropriate table create sql sentence you can locate in the rtvapm\\solmon\\dbconfig directory.\n\n24060: Calculated rates in SolVpns cache replaced by those provided by Solace\n\nCalculated rates from SoVpns cache have been removed except for the total ingress/egress discard rates. The SOL_VPNS table from history should be dropped and recreated with the appropriate table create sql sentence you can locate in the rtvapm\\solmon\\dbconfig directory.\n\n24082: Solace event module no longer reporting regex errors\n\nIn previous releases, the soleventmodule sometimes threw parsing errors on the following syslog messages: CLIENT_CLIENT_BIND_SUCCESS SYSTEM_AUTHENTICATION_SESSION_CLOSED SYSTEM_AUTHENTICATION_SESSION_OPENED This has been fixed.\n\n24090: Ingress/egress message rates added to Endpoint Summary\n\nEndpoint summary display has been enhanced with history of ingress/egress message rates.\n\n24106: Force VPN name when adding a cloud connection\n\nSolace PubSub+ Cloud broker connections now require the use of a VPN name.\n\n24158: SolEventModule typo for BLACKLIST\n\nPreviously there was a bug filtering events and alerts by the priority of BLACKLIST. This has been fixed.\n\n24185: Support for HA Solace Brokers\n\nSupport for adding HA Pairs has been introduced. Using the Configuration Application, specify the URL, port, and credentials for the Primary and Backup Brokers. Two rows in the broker table for each broker will be added. Note that the Backup Broker will be identified by having the string \"-standby\" concatenated to the connection string.\n\n24186: Solace Event Module can be used as sole source of monitoring data\n\nThe Solace PubSub+ monitor can be configured to run with all data being provided via the Solace Event Module; without connection properties being configured to Solace Brokers. See the RTView Solace Monitor documentation for a complete description of the configuration steps of the Solace Event Module.\n\n24192: New standby filter selection list added to Solace Broker table and heatmap\n\nAn 'Show Standby' selection list has been added to filter the table and heatmap of Solace Brokers.\n\n24193: Solace Broker Environmental Sensors should only show data from a single broker\n\nThe Solace Broker Sensors display now enforces selection of a single Broker.\n\nTIBCO ActiveSpaces\n\n23811: New Solution Package for TIBCO Active Spaces (4.1+)\n\nA new solution package TDGMON has been added in support of TIBCO ActiveSpaces 4.1, and is configurable in the Configuration Application. Connections are made to this solution package via the FTL server that is part of the ActiveSpaces Realm. Refer to the RTView Enterprise Userguide for more information.\n\n23828: TIBCO ActiveSpaces 2 solution has been enhanced to support User Authentication\n\nThe connections in the TASMON solution package have been enhanced with additional properties to support user authentication on appropriately configured security domain controllers for a metaspace.\n\nTIBCO BusinessWorks\n\n23847: Hawk displays now showing correct memory usage for Hawk agents\n\nOn some Linux systems the Hawk displays in BW Monitor were showing incorrect values for Memory Used and Memory Used % of the Hawk agents. This has been corrected.\n\n23957: osgi plugin default port updated\n\nThe BW Monitor OSGi plugin default target port has been changed to 3272 to correspond to the default receiver port on the RTView dataserver.\n\n23971: BW6_PROCESS_TOTALS_APP* database schemas changed order of time_stamp column\n\nThe column order of three caches in the TIBCO BusinessWorks monitor have been changed, so that the time_stamp column is now first. The associated database schemas have been updated: BW6_PROCESS_TOTALS_APP BW6_PROCESS_TOTALS_APPNODE BW6_PROCESS_TOTALS_APPSLICE Users are advised to drop and recreate these tables. Alternatively, you can consult with your DBA on the safest way to execute a column reorder for your existing tables.\n\n23972: Row expiration time now set correctly for BwApps and BwAppNodes\n\nIn the BW Monitor App and AppNode caches, the expiration time was being set to the wrong value. This has been corrected.\n\n24136: Removed double entries from bw6mon process cache history\n\nThe BW monitor process data was including spurious rows in its history data with values of zero, which would cause process data trends to appear in a \"sawtooth\" pattern. This has been corrected.\n\n24177: Changed expiration time for delete to 7 days for appnode and app\n\nThe default value for the time it takes an expired application or appnode to be removed from the displays has been increased from 24 hours to 7 days.\n\n24178: Reorder process data columns in app and appnode tables\n\nThe columns in the Applications, Containers, AppSlices and AppNodes tables have been reordered to bring the most useful information to the front of the tables. On the Containers table the Name Filter was incorrectly labeled \"Container Name Filter\". It actually filters on Application name. This has been corrected.\n\n24179: Created rate value now zeroes\n\nIf a process had an instance created in one update interval, then no further creation, the Delta Created and Created/sec values should go to zero on the next update. This was not happening; the values would retain their previous values indefinitely. This has been fixed.\n\n24231: BW Application Node Summary drill downs corrected\n\nDrilldowns from metric cards in TIBCO BusinessWorks Application Node Summary displays have been removed or fixed where applicable.\n\n24234: Some components displays \"blink\" multiple times as they are loading\n\nTIBCO BusinessWorks Application Summary and Application Node Summary displays have been enhanced to improve loading and customer experience.\n\nTIBCO EMS\n\n23296: Fixed typo in name of alert for EMSMON Key Metric asyncDbSize\n\nA typo in EmsServerAsyncDBSizeHigh that prevented the asyncDbSize key metric from working has been forrected.\n\n24229: Updated upper navigation dropdown to contain all available displays\n\nComponent Display navigation for TIBCO EMS monitoring has been enhanced so that all displays in each section are listed in the dropdown navigation on displays in that section.\n\nTIBCO FTL\n\n23927: TIBCO FTL 6.0 support\n\nSupport for TIBCO FTL 6.x has been added and support for TIBCO FTL 5.x has been deprecated.\n\nVersion 5.0.0 Release Notes\n\n23222: Build with Java 1.8 + drop support for Java 1.7\n\nRTView is now built with Java 1.8 Java 1.7 is no longer supported.\n\n23386: Fix the Oracle Storage metrics so that the new component display trend graph renders correctly\n\nThe ORAMON solution package includes two new metrics in history for disk utilization: USED_DATA and TOTAL_DATA.\n\n23671: New Syslog Event alerts\n\nThree new alerts for Solace monitor for monitoring Syslog Events for the scopes SYSTEM, VPN, and CLIENT have been implemented. These alerts are named: SolEventModuleBrokerAlert SolEventModuleVpnAlert SolEventModuleClientAlert ... and require the Solace Event Module being configured and running. These alerts handle simultaneously Clearable and Non-Clearable Syslog Events. See TN23693 for details on how the Solace Event Module is configured and executed in the Solace Monitor.\n\nAlerts\n\n20783: Fixed \"GmsAlertNotifier-1\" java.lang.NullPointerException in alert server\n\nIn previous releases, when alert persistence was enabled and notifications for cleared alerts were disabled, a null pointer exception could be thrown on startup. This has been fixed.\n\n23417: Added email command example to my_alert_actions.sh\n\nThe my_alert_actions.sh alert notification script has been enhanced with a commented out example of how to send an email.\n\nConfiguration\n\n22281: Support for restarting central and non-data servers from config ui\n\nRestarting from the Configuration Application has been enhanced as follows: 1. The RTView Central servers can now be restarted from the Configuration Application. 2. The RESTART DATASERVER button has been renamed to RESTART SERVERS. In addition to restarting the data server, it now restarts the associated historian and display server if they are running.\n\n22286: Improved support for configuring high availability\n\nHigh availability configuration has been added or simplified for all RTView deliverables. See the documentation for details.\n\n22526: Enlarged font for help text in Config UI\n\nThe font size for help text throughout the ConfigUI has been enlarged to make reading easier.\n\n23068: Data Server projects now support announcing themselves to RTViewCentral\n\nRTViewDataServers have been enhanced to make it easier to integrate with EM. Previously, to integrate an RTViewDataServer with Enterprise Monitor, you had to go into the Central Server configuration, add a connection to the RTViewDataServer and then copy over the common properties. With this enhancement, all configuration can be done in the RTViewDataServer configuration and reasonable defaults are provided. To simplify deploying via container, all values on the EM Integration tab can be set via environment variable instead of in the Configuration Application. All fields on the EM Integration tab show the Source of the value to the right of the field if the value wasn't specified in the Configuration Application. NOTE: This feature is not supported by central servers running in an emsample project created with a previous release. It requires the new RTViewCentral project. To configure this feature, select the RTViewDataServer in the Configuration Application and click on the EM Integration item in the navigation tree. Fill in the following options: Integrate with Enterprise Monitor - If enabled, connect to the Central Server in the RTViewCentral deliverable using the url in the Central Server URL field, disable local alert notifications (notifications will be handled by the Central server) and get alert thresholds from the Central Server. Note that in order to see your data and alerts in RTViewCentral, you must also add a connection from RTViewCentral to this RTViewDataServer either by enabling the \"Announce this RTView Data Server to the Central Server\" option and filling in the fields below or by going into the RTViewCentral Configuration Application and adding a connection on the Central Data Server->CONNECTIONS tab. The default for this field is false (0). It can be enabled via this environment variable: RTVDS_INTEGRATEENABLED. For example, RTVDS_INTEGRATEENABLED=1. Central Server URL - The URL to use when connecting to the Central Server in the RTViewCentral installation when Integrate with Enterprise Monitor is enabled. The default is localhost:10018. You can set the value via this environment variable: RTVDS_CENTRALURL. For example, RTVDS_CENTRALURL=http://localhost:10070/rtvdata. Announce this RTView Data Server to the Central Server - If enabled, the Central Server will make a connection to the RTView Data Server in order to display data and alerts from this server. The Central Server will use the values from the RTView Data Server Name, RTView Data Server URL, RTView Query URL, RTView Data Server Host and CITypes to Exclude fields described below when making it's connection to this RTView Data Server. The default is false. You can enable this via this environment variable: RTVDS_ANNUNCIATEENABLED. For example RTVDS_ANNUNCIATEENABLED=1. RTView Data Server Name - The name that the Central Server should use for its connection to this RTView Data Server. This name must be unique within the connections on the Central Server. The default is the Project ID from the General tab. You can set the value via this environment variable: RTVDS_NAME. For example, RTVDS_NAME=EMSMON_LOCAL. RTView Data Server URL - The URL that the Central Server should use for its connection to this RTView Data Server. The default depends on the HTML Server Enabled option on the Data Server tab. If the HTML Server is enabled, the default is http://hostname:3270/rtvdata, otherwise it is hostname:3278 where 32 is the Port Prefix for this project and hostname is the RTView Server Host. You can set the value via this environment variable: RTVDS_URL. For example, RTVDS_URL=http://myhost:8068/rtvdata. RTView Query URL - The URL that html clients should use to query this RTView Data Server. The default depends on the HTML Server Enabled option on the Data Server tab. If the HTML Server is enabled, the default is http://hostname:3270/rtvquery where 32 is the Port Prefix for this project and hostname is the RTView Server Host, otherwise it is blank. You can set the value via this environment variable: RTVDS_QUERYURL. For example, RTVDS_QUERYURL=http://myhost:8068/rtvquery. RTView Data Server Host - The Host name or ip address that the Central Server and html clients should use for connections to this RTView Data Server. The default the ip address for the host. You can set the value via this environment variable: RTVDS_HOST. For example, RTVDS_HOST=localhost CITypes to Exclude - The CI Types to exclude from the Service Model in the Central Server. The defualt is blank which means all CI Types for the configured solution packages are included in the Service Model. You can set the value via this environment variable: RTVDS_CITYPESTOEXCLUDE. For example, RTVDS_CITYPESTOEXCLUDE=BW-ACTIVITIES,BW-PROCESSES.\n\n23071: New RTViewCentral deliverable\n\nEnterprise Monitor has been enhanced with a new RTViewCentral deliverable. The project in this deliverable is similar to the central servers in the emsample project that was included in previous releases. Emsample projects created with a previous release will run in this deliverable with no changes, however there are some limitations when using the Configuration Application in this case. These limitations are listed in the release note for TN23288. This deliverable is meant to be used in conjunction with one or more RTViewDataServer installations which will provide the data. This is the workflow for setting up an RTViewCentral deliverable to work in conjunction with an RTViewDataServer installation: 1. Install RTViewCentral and run it using the appropriate start_servers script in the RTViewCentral\\bin directory. 2. In a browser, navigate to http://localhost:10070/rtvcentral and login (admin/admin or demo/demo) to access the Enterprise Monitor. 3. Install the version of RTViewDataServer that contains the solution packages for which you would like to collect data and run it using the appropriate start_servers script in the top level directory. 4. In a browser, navigate to http://localhost:3270/rtvadmin and login (rtvadmin/rtvadmin). Use the Configuration Application to configure data collection. Then configure EM Integration. On the EM Integration tab, turn on Integrate with Enterprise Monitor and Announce this RTView Data Server to the Central Server. Fill in the other fields if the defaults will not work for your setup. See the release note for TN23068 for more information on the EM Integration tab. Restart your RTViewDataServer to apply your changes. Optionally confirm you are receiving data by browsing to http://localhost:3270/common and confirm you see data in the caches. 5. In the browser from step 2, you should see the following: - in the ADMIN tab, go to Architecture->System Overview and you should see the RTViewDataServer you just configured. - you should see data from your RTViewDataServer in the SERVICE TREE, SERVICE VIEWS and COMPONENTS tab - In the ADMIN tab, you can enable alerts and adjust thresholds for the alerts in the RTViewDataServer. Alerts should then show up in the ALERTS tab.\n\n23073: Support for adding refs to all sp's without including each in project.properties\n\nRTView EM has been enhanced with a new way of specifying rtvapm_reference properties. Instead of listing a reference property for each solution package, e.g. rtvapm_reference=bwmon rtvapm_reference=hawkmon rtvapm_reference=emsmon ... you can now simply use the property \"rtvapm_reference=all\" and RTView EM will add references for all the solution packages in your RTVAPM_HOME, and any custom solution packages in your RTVAPM_USER_HOME.\n\n23273: Password no longer deleted after saving an edited Hawk EMS connection in BW6 config UI\n\nA fix was made to an issue where passwords were being deleted when certain Hawk connections were edited.\n\n23288: Configuration Application changes for new deployment architecture\n\nThe Configuration Application has been enhanced to support the new RTViewCentral deliverable, the RTViewDataServer Enterprise Monitor Integration and to make configuration options easier to find. Changes have been made under RTView Central Server and under the RTView DataServer sections. RTView Central Servers Section Changes: 1. The General->COMMON tab has been removed as the RTViewCentral project does not support common properties files. When running the Configuration Application in an emsample project from a previous release properties from conf\\project-common.properties are merged into the local properties. 2. The General->About tab has a new field named Central Server URL. This field is for reference purposes only to store the url that RTView DataServers should use to connect to the Central Server and defaults to localhost:10018. When running the Configuration Application in an emsample project from a previous release the Config Server URL from conf\\project-common.properties is copied into this field. 3. A new Databases entry has been added to the navigation bar which contains all of the Database connection fields: The Alert Threshold and Historian database fields were moved here from the General->COMMON tab. The Diagram Generator, Metric Explorer and CMDB databases were moved here from the Central Config Server->CONFIGURATION and CMDB tabs. The \"Access the Alert Threshold Database via the Central Config Server Instead of Connecting Directly\" field has been removed as the new deployment architecture has merged the Central Config Server and Central Alert Server into a single server. When running the Configuration Application in an emsample project from a previous release, the Alert Threshold and Historian databases properties from conf\\project-common.properties are copied to this tab. If the \"Access the Alert Threshold Database via the Central Config Server Instead of Connecting Directly\" setting is enabled, it will be maintained but the Configuration Application does not provide a way to disable it. 4. The Central Alert Server->ALERTS and DATA STORAGE tabs have moved to the new Alerts section of navigation bar. 5. The Central Config Server section has been removed. The new RTViewCentral deliverable has merged the Central Config and Central Alert Servers into a single Central Server that serves both functions. The database fields on the Central Config Server->CONFIGURATION SERVER and CMDB tabs have moved to the Databases section. The other fields on the CMDB tab have moved to the new Service Model navigation bar entry. When running the Configuration Application in an emsample project from a previous release where the Memory and/or Log settings for the Central Config Server were overridden, those values are copied to the General->CUSTOM PROPERTIES tab. 6. The Central Alert Server section has been removed. The new RTViewCentral deliverable has merged the Central Config and Central Alert Servers into a single Central Server that serves both functions. The ALERTS and DATA STORAGE tabs have moved to the new Alerts navigation bar entry. When running the Configuration Application in an emsample project from a previous release where the Memory and/or Log settings for the Central Alert Server were overridden, those values are copied to the General->CUSTOM PROPERTIES tab. 7. The Data Servers navigation bar entry has been removed and the Data Servers->CONNECTIONS tab has been moved to the new Central Server section. The Select Mode for Including Solution Packages on the COMPONENTS tab field has been removed. The COMPONENTS tab has been enhanced to only include displays for the solution packages in all enabled connections. See the release note for TN23074 for more information. 8. The new Central Server entry in the navigation bar lets you set memory and log file options for the Central SErver and also add RTView Data Server connections on the CONNECTIONS tab. RTView Data Server Server Configuration Section Changes: 1. The General->ALERTS tab has moved to the Alerts navigation bar entry. The Alert Threshold Database Connection entry has moved to the new Databases navigation bar entry. When running the Configuration Application in an emsample project from a previous release, the Alert Threshold database property from conf\\project-common.properties (previously set on the COMMON tab under RTView Central Servers) is copied to this tab unless it was previously overwritten locally. If the \"Access the Alert Threshold Database via the Central Config Server Instead of Connecting Directly\" setting was enabled, it will be maintained but the Configuration Application does not provide a way to disable it. The \"Configure notifications for this server in addition to central notifications\" option has been removed but will be maintained when running in an emsample project created with a previous release. To disable local notifications, turn off Enabled Notifications. 2. The Historian->HISTORIAN Historian Database Connection entry has moved to the new Databases navigation bar entry. When running the Configuration Application in an emsample project from a previous release, the Historian database property from conf\\project-common.properties (previously set on the COMMON tab under RTView Central Servers) is copied to this tab unless it was previously overwritten locally. 3. The Data Server->SENDER tab was previously only visible when running with the sender property filter. It is now always visible so that you can configure the sender before running it. 4. A new EM Integration navigation bar entry allows you to integrate the RTViewDataServer with the Enterprise RTView Monitor. See the release note for TN23068 for more information.\n\n23346: Refresh prompt added to avoid \"invalid project not editable\" error\n\nThe Configuration Application will now show a message asking the user to refresh when it encounters difficulty connecting to a server after that Data Server (or Data Collector) has been restarted.\n\n23359: Persist alert option for central server no longer saves wrong property\n\nIn previous releases, the Configuration Application saved the wrong value for the Persist Alerts option under RTView Central Servers. This has been fixed.\n\n23364: Support added for searching connections\n\nSearching and sorting functionality has been added to all connection lists.\n\n23391: History Storage - Keys field removed from MySQL configuration\n\nThe History Storage Keys field on the DATA STORAGE tab of the config ui was removed.\n\n23402: DATA STORAGE tab now hidden when running as a sender\n\nWhen a server is running as a sender (ie in the RTViewDataCollector), the options on the ConfigUI's DATA STORAGE tab do not apply. In this case, the tab will be hidden.\n\n23415: Connection to localhost no longer fails when added via config ui\n\nIn previous releases, connections added in the Configuration Application or properties file with localhost in the URL were ignored. This has been fixed.\n\n23457: Fixed password-deletion bug in TIBCO Hawk connections\n\nA fix was made to an issue where passwords were being deleted when certain Hawk connections were edited. Additionally, new EMS connections could not be created if the password field was blank.\n\n23563: Added new AMXMON expiration settings to Configuration Application\n\nThe TIBCO ActiveMatrix section of the Configuration Application has been enhanced include fields to set the expiration and delete time for the AmxNodes cache: Node Expire Time - Sets the amount of time between data updates for a row to be marked expired. Node Delete Time - Sets the amount of time between data updates for a row to be deleted.\n\n23674: Editing existing connection no longer results in a new duplicate connection\n\nPreviously editing existing connections could accidentally created clones. This has been fixed.\n\n23686: Solace branding changes in Config UI\n\nThe Solace Configuration Application pages have been updated to reflect current Solace branding.\n\nData Model\n\n23540: Metrics and alert added for information relating to In-Synch Replicas at the topic level\n\nThe following metrics have been added to the Solution Package for Kafka in the All Topics Table and Heatmap: replicas replicas-outofsync. These values are summed across all the partitions of the topic. The following alert has been added to Solution Package for Kafka: KafkaClusterTopicReplicasOutOfSync This may be selected for all topics in a given cluster or individual topics in a given cluster. The default values are 5 for warning and 10 for alert, representing the number of replicas out of sync for the topic.\n\nDeployment\n\n23403: jetty no longer requires a jdk to host the thin client\n\nIn previous releases, hosting the thin client in jetty required a jdk instead of a jre. This has been fixed.\n\nDistribution\n\n23072: Tomcat bundled with RTViewCentral deliverable\n\nThe RTViewCentral deliverable contains an Apache Tomcat distribution (v8.5.35) configured for the convenience of the user. It is at RTViewCentral/apache-tomcat-8.5.35. The file RTViewCentral/apache-tomcat-*/README_RTVIEW.txt lists the changes made to this distribution. If you wish to use this Tomcat instead of Jetty as your appserver, do the following: - Under the RTViewCentral/bin directory, edit start_servers[.bat/sh] and stop_servers.[bat/sh] to uncomment the lines to start/stop Tomcat. For example, for the start_servers script: Windows: rem echo ... starting Tomcat server rem call start_tomcat.bat to: echo ... starting Tomcat server call start_tomcat.bat Linux: #echo \"... starting Tomcat server\" #. ./start_tomcat.sh to echo \"... starting Tomcat server\" . ./start_tomcat.sh The next time you start/stop your servers, the Apache Tomcat server will also be effected.\n\n23076: New RTViewDataServer variants\n\nThe RTView DataServer is used for sending data to RTView Cloud displays and dashboards, or for sending data to an on-premise RTView Central Server deployment. In this release the RTView DataServer product line has been expanded to a family of 7 variants.

Includes Solution Packages for: - Data Cache - Apache Kafka - RTView Management Files: RTViewDataServerKafka_x.zip RTViewDataCollectorKafka_x.zip\n\n23412: UX Robot no longer bundled inside product deliverables\n\nThe UX Robot agent (UXRobot_*.zip) is no longer packaged inside the Solution Package for User Experience. It is available as a separate download.\n\nGeneral\n\n23074: have components tree automatically populate based on cisource properties\n\nThe tree for the COMPONENTS tab has been enhanced to filter the available displays based on the solution packages hosted by the enabled RTView Data Server connections. When running in an emsample project from a previous release where the tree was customized, this filter will be applied in addition to any customization.\n\n23407: RTView Manager included with RTViewCentral deliverable\n\nThe RTViewCentral deliverable has been enhanced to contain an RTView Manager project. The purpose of this project is to monitor the RTView Central Servers a well as any RTViewDataServers to which Central is connected. All RTView Manager connections in this project are discovered from the RTView Central Server and cannot be edited. This monitor runs stand-alone and is not included in the EM Central views. To access this monitor, go to http://localhost:3070/rtview-manager.\n\n23687: New user names added to the thin client\n\nThe default thin client login has been enhanced to support the following new users: user = rtvadmin, password = rtvadmin, role = admin user = rtvuser, password = rtvuser, role = read-only user = rtvalertmgr, password = rtvalertmgr, role = event The previously supported default users (admin, demo) are still supported for the thin client in RTViewCentral, but the new login must be used for the beta Enterprise Edition user interface. In RTViewSolaceMonitor, the new login must be used.\n\nRTVRULES\n\n23078: rtvrules added to RTViewCentral\n\nRTViewCentral has been enhanced to the contain the rtvrules project previously available in emsample. This project supports service level alerts.\n\nRTView Core Functionality\n\nAlerts\n\n23373: Improved error reporting when persistence database doesn't have correct schema\n\nThe Alert Engine has been enhanced to provide expected column information in the case where the Alert Persistence database table does not contain the correct schema.\n\nData Historian\n\n23504: Historian now detects lost database connection when using prepared statements\n\nPreviously, under certain circumstances, the Historian would not detect lost database connections when using prepared statements. This is no longer the case.\n\nData Server\n\n23491: Options added to rtvquery for how to output NaN\n\nThe rtvquery servlet has new options for specifying how values of NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity should appear in the response. The new options are infval, and neginfval, and nanval. infval: The value to use for +Infinity neginfval: The value to use for -Infinity nanval: The value to use for NaN, and for +Infinity if infval is not specified, and for -Infinity if neginf is not specified. These options are recognized only if the nanok option is set to true (nanok=true) and if the requested format is json (fmt=json). These options can be useful if the rtvquery response will be parsed by 3rd party apps that expect specific strings for those values. For example, if a parser expects the string \"null\" for values of NaN and +/-Infinity, the following options should be used: http://somehost/rtvquery/cache/MyCache/current?fmt=json&nanok=true&nanval=\"null\" Note that the quotes around null are required to make it a valid JSON string. Or, for a parser that expects zero for NaN and +/-Infinity: http://somehost/rtvquery/cache/MyCache/current?fmt=json&nanok=true&nanval=0 Or, for a parser that expects zero for NaN, 99999 for +Infinity, and -99999 for -Infinity http://somehost/rtvquery/cache/MyCache/current?fmt=json&nanok=true&nanval=0&infval=99999&neginfval=-99999 If none of the new options is specified, then the behavior is the same as in previous releases: That is, if nanok = true, then NaN appears as \"NaN\" in the response, +Infinity appears as \"Infinity\", and -Infinity as \"-Infinity\". If nanok = false or is not specified, then NaN, +Infinity,and -Infinity all appear as \"\" (an empty string) in the response.\n\nData Sources\n\n23500: Duplicate database connection errors no longer printed to log file\n\nThe error reporting for failed database connection attempts has been enhanced. Previously, an error was printed to the console for each failed connection attempt. Now, an error is reported for the first failed connection attempt and no more output is generated until a success message is printed when the connection succeeds. The connection error is only printed again the first time we fail to reconnect after a successful connection is lost. This change applies both to the GmsRtViewSqlDs connections and to the Historian connection to the RTVHISTORY database.\n\nDistribution\n\n23220: jetty updated to 9.4.14\n\nThe version of Jetty used by EM to host web applications has been upgraded to Jetty version 9.4.14. In addition, the temp directory used by Jetty has been changed. Previously, the java.io.tmpdir directory was used, but files were not always removed from this directory. Now, Jetty creates a temp sub-directory in the directory where the data server is running. This temp directory is deleted on shutdown.\n\nScripts\n\n18806: Support secure JMX with start and stop and status scripts\n\nThe start_rtv, stop_rtv and status_rtv scripts have been enhanced so as to work with RTView servers whose JMX ports have been secured either with username and password or with SSL. You give the scripts the necessary information about credentials and they manage authentication with the server. In the first case the necessary information is username and password. In the second case it is client KeyStore and TrustStore locations and their corresponding passwords. This information can be given to the scripts in two ways: via command-line arguments, and via properties placed in any property file used by the server. Username and password may be specified via command-line arguments as follows: -jmxuser:... -jmxpass:... Or by properties as follows: sl.rtview.jmxremote.username=... sl.rtview.jmxremote.password=.... Client KeyStore and TrustStore files and passwords may be specified as follows: -sslkeystore:... -sslkeystorepass:... -ssltruststore:... -ssltruststorepass:... Or by properties as follows: sl.rtview.ssl.client.keyStore=... sl.rtview.ssl.client.keyStorePassword=... sl.rtview.ssl.client.trustStore=... sl.rtview.ssl.client.trustStorePassword=.... You may encrypt the passwords in your properties files by using the command-line tool \"encode_string\", for example encode_string encoder2 password This will give you an encrypted value for \"password\" you may use in your properties.\n\n23204: update_wars scripts now support command-line arguments\n\nThe update_wars scripts in all deliverables have been improved as follows: 1. The name, host, and portprefix are declared in variables at the top of the script for easy editing. 2. Those three variables may be passed into the scripts on the command-line, e.g. update_wars.sh my-appname my-hostname 99 3. You may use \"?\" or \"help\" to get a usage message, e.g. > update_wars.sh help Usage: update_wars.sh [appname [host [portprefix]]] Defaults: rtview-bwmon localhost 33 4. You may edit other variables at the stop of the scripts to set properties for HA (high-availability). Set HA_HOST to the hostname of the backup data server. Set HA_DISPLAYHOST to the hostname of the backup display server. Set HA_FAILBACK to true to automatically reconnect to the primary display server.\n\n23320: Can now run stop_rtv in two deployments simultaneously\n\nIf you tried to run stop_rtv simultaneously in two different distributions (e.g. RTViewCentral and RTViewDataServer) you might get the error \"The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.\" This has been corrected.\n\n23416: JMX port conflicts reported by start scripts\n\nThe start_rtv scripts, when checking for port conflicts before starting a server, will now detect if a port conflict is caused by another RTView server, and will identify that server by its RTVAPM_HOME. For example: ...start_rtv.bat: another dataserver running with JMX port 3268 under C:\\rtview\\RTViewDataServer\\rtvapm If the port conflict is caused by a non-RTView process the message will be like this: ...start_rtv.bat: JMX port 3268 in use by PID 1234 In either case the script will include this advice: Warning: server not started, port conflict To avoid port conflicts, run your start script with the -portprefix: command line argument to change the first 2 digits of all your server ports. To persist these port changes, change the port prefix in the Configuration Application or use the -saveportprefix: command line argument. See the documentation for more information.\n\n23431: Start scripts no longer fail on windows if there are spaces in the install directory\n\nThe scripts used to start and stop rtview servers on Windows would fail if the product were installed in a directory with spaces in the name (e.g. \"test directory\"). This has been fixed.\n\n23467: Fixed portprefix command line bugs\n\nTwo problems with the -portprefix option have been corrected. It will now emit correct args for the single-solution monitoring products, and it will not incorrectly emit args for central servers.\n\n23482: start_rtv with -portprefix now changes database port\n\nIn an RTViewDataServer distribution with database enabled, if the servers were started with \"-portprefix:xx\" the new port number was not passed to the database. This has been corrected.\n\nSolution Package\n\nAmazon CloudWatch\n\n23054: Corrected property names in sample.properties and add defaults to conf\n\nThe sample.properties file for the Solution Package for Amazon Web Services contained typos in the connection properties. This has been fixed. Default values for initialHistory and autoDiscoveryPeriod have also been added to avoid errors like so: 2018-06-18 10:36:10,303 INFO pool-2-thread-1 - [rtview] AwsCloudWatchDs: ERROR: updateDataObject: discovery period not set in Options\n\nApache Kafka\n\n22895: History Table Names shortened to stay under 30-character limit\n\nThe Kafka monitor history table names have been shortened to 30 characters to conform to database requirements\n\n23290: Now fetching historical data correctly for tabs under All Brokers Metrics Table\n\nThe Kafka All Brokers Table has three tabs - Timers, Histograms, Meters - each of which has a trend graph. Those graphs were not fetching data from the database as needed (Extend With SQL feature). This has been fixed.\n\n23395: Added JVM metrics to Broker, Producer, Consumer caches, displays, alerts, and key metrics\n\n------------------------------------ The following alerts have been added: ------------------------------------ KafkaBrokerCpuPercentHigh KafkaConsumerCpuPercentHigh KafkaProducerCpuPercentHigh Executes a single warning alert and a single alarm alert if the percent of CPU used exceeds the specified threshold. Index Type: Per KafkaBroker / KafkaConsumer / KafkaProducer Metric: CpuPercent KafkaBrokerMemoryUsedPercentHigh KafkaConsumerMemoryUsedPercentHigh KafkaProducerMemoryUsedPercentHigh Executes a single warning alert and a single alarm alert if the percent of memory used exceeds the specified threshold. Index Type: Per KafkaBroker / KafkaConsumer / KafkaProducer Metric: MemoryUsedPercent ----------------------------------------- The following key metrics have been added: ----------------------------------------- CI Type Cache Selector Metric / Alert KAFKA-BROKER KafkaServerJvm CpuPercent CpuPercent / KafkaBrokerCpuPercentHigh KAFKA-BROKER KafkaServerJvm MemoryUsedPercent MemoryUsedPercent / KafkaBrokerMemoryUsedPercentHigh KAFKA-CONSUMER KafkaConsumer CpuPercent CpuPercent / KafkaConsumerCpuPercentHigh KAFKA-CONSUMER KafkaConsumer MemoryUsedPercent MemoryUsedPercent / KafkaConsumerMemoryUsedPercentHigh KAFKA-PRODUCER KafkaProducer CpuPercent CpuPercent / KafkaProducerCpuPercentHigh KAFKA-PRODUCER KafkaProducer MemoryUsedPercent MemoryUsedPercent / KafkaProducerMemoryUsedPercent ----------------------------------------- The following displays have been enhanced: ----------------------------------------- All Brokers Table, All Consumers Table, All Producers Table - added columns \"CPU %\" and \"Mem Used %\" All Brokers Heatmap, All Consumers Heatmap, All Producers Heatmap - added \"CPU %\" and \"Mem Used %\" to mouseover tooltip. ----- Note ----- The key metric KafkaBrokerNetProcAvgIdlePct has been removed.\n\n23413: Removed duplicate alert KafkaBrokerReqHdlrAvgIdlePctLow\n\nThe alert KafkaBrokerReqHdlrAvgIdlePctLow was a duplicate of the alert KafkaBrokerNetProcAvgIdlePctLow and has been removed.\n\n23434: Kafka Cluster alerts are no longer misconfigured\n\nIn RTView EM the Kafka Cluster alerts were not configured so that the \"Go To CI\" button in the Alert Table would go to the corresponding Kafka Cluster summary page. This has been corrected.\n\n23539: Kafka 12.2 classpath support\n\nIn previous releases, connecting to Kafka 12.1 caused the RTView DataServer to throw an exception and fail to start Jetty due to a mismatch of the versions of Jetty included with Kafka and RTView. This has been fixed.\n\nHost Infrastructure\n\n23048: Fixed incorrect info in hostbase sample.properties file\n\nThis Host Solution Package property is obsolete: collector.sl.rtview.cache.config=host_cache_source_agent_v1.1.rtv $hostAgentDomain:myDomain For SL Host agents, the domain name is set in the agent's agent.properties file.\n\n23683: Corrections/additions to rtvHostAgent\n\nThe default port that the Host Agent sends to has been changed from 3972 to 3272, the new default listen port for RTView DataServers. For user convenience, information about optional command line arguments, that can override some properties in agent.properties, has been added to the README.txt and agent.properties comments.\n\nIBM Websphere Application Server\n\n23181: Removed unused properties from sample.properties\n\nThe following unused properties have been removed from the Solution Package for IBM Websphere sample properties files: sl.rtview.sub=$WAS_SERVERINFO_TABLE:'' sl.rtview.sub=$WAS_SYSTEMMETRICS_TABLE:'' sl.rtview.sub=$WAS_JVMRUNTIME_TABLE:'' sl.rtview.sub=$WAS_SESSIONTOTALS_BYSERVER_TABLE:''\n\nMongoDB\n\n23269: Show correct replica set member state\n\nPreviously, under certain circumstances, the replica set member state (\"DesignationInSet\") for an instance would not be shown correctly. This is no longer the case. Possible replica set member states are described here: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/replica-states/ e.g. PRIMARY, SECONDARY, ARBITER\n\nNode.js\n\n23278: Corrected README.txt info on host paramater\n\nThere were several errors in the readme.txt file for the rtview-nodemon agent regarding the use of the host parameter which have now been corrected.\n\n23477: Updated versions of dependencies used to build nodemon agent\n\nWhen installed, the rtview-nodemon agent will now use updated versions of pidusage and monitor-plugin-process.\n\nOracle Database\n\n23324: Added Disk Usage metrics to history\n\nThe disk utilization metrics from OraDatabaseDiskUsage cache have been added to history.\n\nSolace\n\n23258: Improved drill down behavior of Solace Neighbors topology diagram\n\nThe CSPF Neighbors Topology diagram has been fixed and now allows drill down to the CSPF Neighbor Table filtered by the selected Message Router when one double clicks on a Message Router with neighbors. Otherwise, the CSPF Neighbor table will show all neighbors from all Message Routers.\n\n23536: Data queries improved to work with heavily loaded router\n\nThe RTView Solace Data Source has been improved to incorporate paging on all high volume SEMP requests. These improved queries are for Clients, Endpoints (Queues and Topics) and VPNs.\n\n23630: Bind-requests removed from SolClients cache\n\nThe metric bind-requests has been removed from the SolClients cache and accordingly from the Clients Table and Client Summary.\n\n23690: Brokers Table no longer empty when collecting data from cloud brokers\n\nThe VPN information from the Solace Cloud Brokers has been raised to the Brokers displays to avoid misleading empty displays due to the limited characteristics of their functionality.\n\n23693: New Solace Event Module\n\nThe Solace Monitor has been enhanced to include the Solace Event Module which listens for the syslog messages that are generated by the Solace brokers. It contains meta data for parsing the syslog messages into a readable form and also for triggering alerts based on the syslog events. The parsed syslog messages are forwarded to the RTViewDataServer’s SolEventModuleEvents cache, and the alerts are forwarded to the RTViewDataServer’s SolEventModuleAlert cache. The Solace Event Module is executed as a subprocess of the data server. If you are licensed to run the Solace Event Module, you can enable it by adding the -soleventmodule command line option to the dataserver line of your rtvservers.dat file. See the documentation for more information on setup and configuration of the Solace Event Module.\n\n23722: New Solace Sparse Message Spool Files alert\n\nA new alert SolSparseMessageSpoolFile, for detecting the existence of sparse message spool files, has been implemented. This alert will be triggered when the Disk Space Utilization is above 30% and the ratio of Disk Space in MB and Spool Usage in MB is above 3. Look at the Recommended Actions Section from https://docs.solace.com/Configuring-and-Managing/Mon-Mgmt-Disk-Con.htm for details on how to solve this situation.\n\n23729: Support for Syslog messages changed\n\nSolace solution package support for Syslog messages has changed. The previously supported Syslog connections and displays are no longer available. Solace Syslog messages are now handled by the Solace Event Module. The new Syslog display is availabe in the RTViewSolaceMonitor and in the beta Enterprise Edition monitor. It is not available with Enterprise Monitor (thin client). Users with existing Solace projects from previous releases that contain Syslog connections will need to migrate their Syslog connection information to the Solace Event Module.\n\n23766: New metrics to calculate SolSparseMessageSpoolFile alert\n\nThe Disk Space Usage in MB and the Spool Usage in MB metrics have been added to the SolApplianceMessageSpool cache. These metrics will be used to calculate the condition for triggering the SolSparseMessageSpoolFile alert.\n\nTIBCO ActiveMatrix\n\n23474: Included the 'Runtime State' in the AMX 'All Service Nodes Table' display\n\nThe column 'Runtime State' has been added to the AMX 'All Service Nodes Table' display\n\n23497: Changed cache retention policy for AMX nodes to mark and delete\n\nThe AMX Node cache has been set up to mark and delete expired nodes. The time to expire and delete nodes is controlled by two new variables: $amxNodeExpirationTime $amxNodeExpirationTimeForDelete\n\n23636: CI Type AMX-NODE no longer has wrong index columns\n\nThe amxmon alert AmxNodeNotRunning was displayed in the Alerts table with incorrect indexes in the CI column. There should be three indexes, HostName;AMX Host;Node, but only HostName;AMX Host were displayed.\n\nTIBCO BusinessWorks\n\n22998: Alert descriptions now include units for CPU/memory alerts for BW/BW6\n\nThe descriptions for the following alerts have been changed to indicate the corresponding metric is \"% of total\": BwEngineCpuUsedHigh BwEngineMemUsedHigh BwServerCpuUsedHigh BwServerMemUsedHigh Bw6AppNodeCpuUsedHigh Bw6AppNodeMemUsedHigh The descriptions for the following alert has been changed to indicate the corresponding metric is \"MB\" BwServerFreeMemLow\n\n23263: New \"BW Process Hung\" alerts for BW and BW6\n\nThe alert BwProcessHung has been added to the BW5 monitor and the alert Bw6ProcessHung to the BW monitor. This alert is triggered for a given process when the delta elapsed time is greater than zero but the delta elapsed time is zero.\n\n23286: Updated OSGi Plugin\n\nThe BW Monitor OSGi Plugin has been updated to version 4.2. Please see documentation for improved installation instructions.\n\n23305: Application summary trends now show data in sender-receiver deployment\n\nIn a sender-receiver deployment, when viewing the displays on the receiver side, the trends in the Application Summary display will be blank. This has been corrected.\n\n23339: Improved error reporting in dataserver log when Hawk not available\n\nRTView dataservers configured for BusinessWorks will write warning messages to the log if Hawk is not installed and configured in the environment. The number of messages has been reduced.\n\n23405: ActiveMatrix removed from BusinessWorks names\n\nTIBCO has changed the name of TIBCO ActiveMatrix BusinessWorks to TIBCO BusinessWorks. RTView references have been updated accordingly.\n\n23530: OSGi plugin now allows appnodes to be named with container ID or env var substitution\n\nThe RTView BW Monitor OSGi Plugin has been enhanced as follows: (1) If you do not provide, via properties, a specific name for the appnode running in the container, the Docker container ID or PCF container GUID will be used for the appnode name. (2) If you do provide specific names for domain, appspace, or appnode, you can include variables from the container environment in the names, by bracketing the environment variable name with '%'. For example, if you wanted to name your PCF container appnodes \"instance-1\", \"instance-2\" etc. then you could supply an appnode name such as: sl.rtview.bw.appnode=instance-%CF_INSTANCE_INDEX% (3) The \"Deployment\" column in the Application and Appnode tables will now say \"PCF\" or \"Docker\" instead of just \"Container\".\n\nTIBCO EMS\n\n19248: Producer and consumer tables no longer show incorrect \"unknown\" type\n\nIn previous releases, the Consumer and Producer tables listed Unknown for the destinationType column if the type was not a topic. This has been fixed. They now list the following values: Topic - if getDestinationType() returns DestinationInfo.TOPIC_TYPE Queue - if getDestinationType() returns DestinationInfo.QUEUE_TYPE Topic or Queue - if getDestinationType() returns DestinationInfo.ALL_TYPE Unknown(typeVal) - if getDestinationType() returns any other value\n\n22485: Value of max # of history rows for EmsQueuesExt and EmsTopicsExt updated\n\nThe cache attribute max number of history rows has been updated to use the substitution emsMaxNumberOfHistoryRowsLarge in EmsQueueExt and EmsTopicsExt caches, which is set by default to 200,000 rows.\n\nVersion 4.2.0 Release Notes\n\nConfiguration\n\n22451: Solution Package for TIBCO ActiveMatrix added to Configuration Application\n\nThe RTView Configuration Application has been enhanced to include the Solution Package for TIBCO ActiveMatrix.\n\n22826: Solution Package for Amazon Web Services added to Configuration Application\n\nThe RTView Configuration Application has been enhanced to include the Solution Package for Amazon Web Services.\n\n22828: Solution Package for IBM DB2 added to Configuration Application\n\nThe RTView Configuration Application has been enhanced to include the Solution Package for IBM DB2.\n\n22829: Solution Package for Docker added to Configuration Application\n\nThe RTView Configuration Application has been enhanced to include the Solution Package for Docker.\n\n22830: Solution Package for RTView Host Agent added to Configuration Application\n\nThe RTView Configuration Application has been enhanced to include the Solution Package for RTView Host Agent.\n\n22832: Solution Package for MongoDB added to Configuration Application\n\nThe RTView Configuration Application has been enhanced to include the Solution Package for MongoDB.\n\n22834: Solution Package for Node.js added to Configuration Application\n\nThe RTView Configuration Application has been enhanced to include the Solution Package for Node.js .\n\n22835: Solution Package for Oracle Database added to Configuration Application\n\nThe RTView Configuration Application has been enhanced to include the Solution Package for Oracle Database.\n\n22838: Solution Package for Oracle Web Logic added to Configuration Application\n\nThe RTView Configuration Application has been enhanced to include the Solution Package for Oracle Web Logic.\n\n22839: Solution Package for IBM WebSphere added to Configuration Application\n\nThe RTView Configuration Application has been enhanced to include the Solution Package for IBM WebSphere.\n\n23135: Fixed bug with removing vpn from Solace connection\n\nIn the previous release, it was not possible to remove all Solace vpn's from the connections dialog. This has been fixed.\n\n23140: New Connection icon no longer disappears from Configuration Application after toggling tabs on SYSLOG connections.\n\nThe Solace Add Syslog Connection ('+') button now always appears as expected.\n\n23187: IE 11 Compatibility mode is now recognized as not supported\n\nIE 11 Compatibility mode is now flagged as being unsupported for the Configuration Application.\n\nJBoss\n\n22976: Wildfly documented in sample.properties and added to Configuration Application\n\nThe connection properties for WildFly have been added to the sample.properties and included in the Configuration Application.\n\nData Server\n\n23210: Improved error reporting for start_rtv.bat/sh scripts\n\nThe start_rtv scripts have been enhanced to report possible port conflicts before trying to start a server, and to report if a server is not actually started due to some other cause (e.g. expired license key). if a server's data and/or JMX port is already in use by another process, start_rtv will report e.g.: dataserver: JMX port xxx in use by PID yyy dataserver: Data port xxx in use by PID yyy If the server fails to start for some other reason, start_rtv will report e.g.: dataserver: Executing rundata -propfilter:receiver dataserver: ... was not started, check log file.\n\nDistribution\n\n23077: RTView DataServer for Kafka port prefix and server name default updated\n\nThe following changes have been made to the default project in the RTView DataServer for Kafka deliverable: - Default port prefix is now 32 - Short-form server name has been changed from KAFKAMON to DataServerKafka - Long-form server name has been changed from Apache Kafka Monitor to RTView DataServer for Kafka - project directory name has been changed from projects\\sample-server to projects\\rtview-server\n\n23198: Sample project directory renamed to rtview-server\n\nTwo naming changes have been made to the RTViewDataServer family of deliverables: The sample-server project for the RTViewDataServer* deliverables and the sample-collector project of the RTViewDataCollector deliverable have been renamed to \"rtview-server\". The RTViewDataCollector_x.zip deliverable has been renamed to RTViewDataServerSP_x.zip, to reflect that it contains all solution packages.\n\n23223: RTView DataServer for TIBCO - new deliverable\n\nA new RTView(R) DataServer variant has been added to the RTView monitoring lineup. It is intended for use by those who wish to monitor TIBCO's middleware products. Files: RTViewDataServerTIBCO_x.zip RTViewDataCollectorTIBCO_x.zip RTView(R) DataServer for TIBCO includes Solution Packages for: - TIBCO BusinessWorks 5 - TIBCO BusinessWorks 6 - TIBCO Enterprise Message Service - TIBCO Adapters - TIBCO ActiveSpaces (2.x) - TIBCO Hawk - TIBCO FTL - TIBCO ActiveMatrix - RTView Management\n\n23228: RTView DataServer for Solace - new deliverable\n\nA new RTView(R) DataServer variant has been added to the RTView monitoring lineup. It is intended for use by those who wish to monitor Solace appliances. Files: RTViewDataServerSolace_x.zip RTViewDataCollectorSolace_x.zip RTView(R) DataServer for Solace includes Solution Packages for: - Solace - Syslog\n\nGeneral\n\n22859: Spurious file no longer appears in cache subdirectory\n\nPreviously, under certain circumstances a spurious file was generated in the cache subdirectory when using the datacache mechanism. This is no longer the case.\n\n23064: Configuration Application now displaying proper warning after failing to write property.\n\nAn alert dialog has been added to display any warning msgs that follow a successful save.\n\n23168: Extend With SQL previously not working for trends in some displays\n\nRTView trend displays will automatically retrieve data from a database if available and if required by the time range requested in the display. This feature was not working correctly for a number of displays. This has been corrected.\n\nRTView Core Functionality\n\nData Historian\n\n22195: RTView Historian now uses PreparedStatements\n\nThe Historian now uses PreparedStatements for repeated SQL Queries against the historian database - For raw data insert - For data compaction - For retention deletion Previously the historian used literal SQL queries with unique timestamps.\n\nData Server\n\n23211: Message now shown in dataserver console when Java is not available.\n\nThe scripts which start servers have been improved to give a clear indication if the java command is not available. If java(.exe) is not found on the PATH but JAVA_HOME is defined, the scripts will add JAVA_HOME/bin to the PATH and try again. If JAVA_HOME is not defined or java(.exe) cannot be found in JAVA_HOME, the scripts will fail with the error \"java not found on PATH and JAVA_HOME not defined or not valid.\" On Windows this will be followed by a pause and \"Press any key to continue\".\n\nScripts\n\n23032: New validate_install.bat/sh script\n\nA new script has been added to the RTView distributions to validate the RTView installation. It will verify the environment and directory structure and on Unix it will also fix file permissions and file formats as required. The script is validate_install.bat/sh. It is used in a command prompt or terminal window by changing to the toplevel/rtvapm directory and typing \"validate_install(.sh)\". On Unix, if file permissions or formats are fixed, the script will print a count of the files fixed. Additionally, if invoked with the argument \"-v\" (verbose) it will list the names of the files fixed. Examples: Validating installation in /opt/rtview/RTViewSolaceMonitor ... Java installation correct. ... rtvapm installation correct. ... file permissions correct. ... file formats correct. Validating installation in C:\\rtview\\RTViewDataServerKafka ... Java installation correct. ... rtvapm installation correct.\n\n23219: hsqldb updated to 1.8.1\n\nThe version of hsqldb included has been updated to 1.8.1. Previously when the hsqldb database was shut down with stop_rtv.bat/sh, its console window would show multiple messages of the form Exception in thread \"HSQLDB Connection @5757c327\" java.lang.NullPointerException This has been corrected. Note that on Windows, when shutting down the database you may see messages of the form \"database alias=alertdefs does not exist\" in the hsqldb console window. These messages may be ignored.\n\nSolution Package\n\nApache Kafka\n\n23184: Custom Kafka DS incorrectly parses some command output\n\nThe Solution Package for Kafka makes use of the output from the kafka-consumer-groups.sh command. In the case where a consumer is not assigned any partitions it will appear in the command output with dashes for the partition-related fields, e.g. TOPIC PARTITION CURRENT-OFFSET LOG-END-OFFSET LAG CONSUMER-ID HOST CLIENT-ID - - - - consumer5-67bd6d45-0f4c-450e-a969-c16e565808b4 /192.168.200.226 consumer5 Lines of this form were not correctly handled by the dataserver, resulting in error messages like: [rtview] getLagTable: java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: \"-\" This has been corrected.\n\nIBM DB2 Database\n\n21571: Minor typo on display for IBM DB2 Database display\n\nA typo in the IBM DB2 Database displays has been fixed.\n\nIBM Websphere Application Server\n\n22991: WSM data server no longer crashes if classpath not set\n\nIn previous releases, the Solution Package for IBM WebSphere crashed if the classpath did not contain the WebSphere jars. This has been fixed.\n\n23182: Cache configuration parameters now available in Config UI\n\nAll caches from the RTView IBM WebSphere Monitor have been enhanced to support parametrizion of condensing and cache size attributes. This enhancement will be taken into account for the RTView Configuration Admin Tool to allow customers to make changes in these cache attributes.\n\nTIBCO BusinessWorks\n\n22503: SQL statements for BW tables optimized\n\nThe schemas for the BW historian tables listed below (found under rtvapm/bwmon/dbconfig) have been optimized to reflect common customer scenarios: BW_ENGINES BW_PROCESSES BW_PROCESS_TOTALS BW_ACTIVITIES BW_ACTIVITY_TOTALS 1. \"MicroAgentName\" VARCHAR(100) increased to \"MicroAgentName\" VARCHAR(160) since the engine name often exceeds 100 chars. NOTE: This change does not apply to Sybase, due to Sybase not supporting >100 characters for an index column. 2. \"MicroAgentInstance\" VARCHAR(255) decreased to \"MicroAgentInstance\" VARCHAR(10) because this column refers to the instance # which rarely exceeds 1000. This will save some space in the database. Users with existing tables do not need to update their tables.\n\n23167: BwProcessCreatedRateLow now alerts corrected\n\nThe BwProcessCreatedRateLow alert was incorrectly configured so that it acted like a \"High\" rather than a \"Low\" alert. In other words, the alert would trigger if the Created Rate value was greater than the threshold rather than less than. This has been corrected.\n\nVersion 4.1.0 Release Notes\n\nConfiguration\n\n22559: Run all sample projects as receivers\n\nThe solution package data servers for all sample projects are now run as receivers. This means that all data servers open an RtvAgent port to listen for collector/sender data.\n\n22574: Added sender target to all sample projects\n\nEnterprise RTView has been enhanced to include sender targets in the configuration for all sample solution package projects. The sender target is only used when the solution package data server is run as a sender.\n\n22583: Solution Package for Apache Kafka added to configuration application\n\nThe RTView Configuration Application has been enhanced to include the Solution Package for Apache Kafka.\n\n22606: Improved user notification\n\nWhen one or more solution packages are added to a data server connection, and the project type is a configclient, a message will be displayed instructing the user to update the data server connections list with the new solution package(s).\n\n22747: Solution Package for Solace added to the Configuration Application\n\nThe RTView Configuration Application has been enhanced to include the Solution Package for Solace Message Router.\n\n22831: Solution Package for Redhat JBoss added to configuration application\n\nThe RTView Configuration Application has been enhanced to include the Solution Package for Redhat JBoss.\n\n22833: Solution Package for IBM MQ added to configuration application\n\nThe RTView Configuration Application has been enhanced to include the Solution Package for IBM Websphere MQ.\n\n22847: Enable Checkbox should be enabled for default diagram generator and metric explorer DB\n\nThe enabled checkbox should always appear ungrayed for Diagram Generator and Metric Explorer DB connections\n\n22891: Configuration Application now uses basic authentication instead of digest\n\nIn the previous release, the Configuration Application used Digest authentication which cause occasional problems with the login dialog coming up repeatedly when single sign on was not enabled in the app server. It has been modified to use BASIC authentication instead which does not require single sign on. Basic authentication sends the username and password as a base64-encoded string. This a public encoding scheme and is therefore not secure unless https is used. If you are concerned about keeping the login credentials of the Configuration Application secure, you should deploy it using https which will secure all data including the login credentials.\n\n22892: New Restart Data Server option added to configuration application\n\nThe RTView Configuration Application has been enhanced with a button to restart a Solution Package data server. This button is available whenever there are unapplied changes. To restart a solution package data server: 1. Make some configuration changes and click SAVE to save them. 2. A Restart button will appear in the top right corner of the page. When you click the Restart button, you will be taken back to the top level page. The data server for the solution package project will exit, then start back up with the changes applied. The button is also available on the top level page if you want to restart your data server later. There is a delay of 10 seconds between the shutdown of the server and the restart in order to allow system resources to be released by the exising process. It may take several more seconds before Configuration Application and other clients reconnect to the data server. Note that this process only restarts the data server. Settings for the display server or historian processes will not be applied until those processes are restarted using the scripts. They cannot be restarted from the Configuration Application.\n\nDeployment\n\n22056: Added https support to the servlet container\n\nThe html server feature of RTView Enterprise Monitor has been enhanced to support https. This is configured in the Configuration Application Data Server page in the HTML Server section. There are 4 fields for configuring https: - Use Https - Set to true to use https - Keystore File - Set to the key store file name (including path) that contains the certificate for your domain. This is required to use https. - Keystore Password - Set to the password for the keystore. This field is optional. - Key Manager Password - Set to the password for the key manager. This field is optional.\n\n22173: New cache viewer added to servlet container\n\nRTView Enteprise Monitor html server feature has been enhanced to include a cache viewer. This is useful for verifying cache contents without the need for setting up the thin client. For any data server that has the html server enabled, navigate to the following url to bring up the cache viewer: http://localhost:3270/common Replacing the 32 with the port prefix used by your data server. Select a cache from the top table to show the cache contents in the lower table.\n\nDistribution\n\n22850: RTViewDataServer available on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform\n\nThe RTView DataServer deliverable has been made available on Red Hat's OpenShift Container Platform, starting with version 4.0.0. The URL for the image is: registry.connect.redhat.com/slcorp/rtview-dataserver More information is available on RedHat's site at: https://access.redhat.com/containers/?tab=overview#/registry.connect.redhat.com/slcorp/rtview-dataserver\n\nRTView Core Functionality\n\nData Sources\n\n22840: Automatically detect when JSON configured standby EMS Servers become active\n\nThe EMS Admin data adapter had an issue with fault-tolerant server pairs configured via JSON, such that the data adapter would not detect when the inactive server became active. This has been corrected.\n\nDistribution\n\n22853: rtvpost servlet added to Jetty\n\nRTView Enteprise Monitor html server feature has been enhanced to include the %RTV_HOME%\\servlets\\rtvpost\\rtvpost.war servlet in Jetty.\n\nScripts\n\n22888: Start script no longer fails on Solaris\n\nOn Solaris 10/11 using RTViewEnterpriseMonitor, starting the central database might give the error \"expr: string too long\". This has been corrected.\n\nSolution Package\n\nApache Kafka\n\n22731: Add summary data to kafka caches.\n\nThe column \"ZK Disconnect Rate\" has been added to the All Brokers table. This is the mean rate of Zookeeper disconnects per broker, in seconds. Two caches have been added: KafkaServerZookeeper contains per-broker counts of zookeeper disconnects and expirations KafkaCluster contains server and client counts and specific metrics summarized at the cluster level.\n\n22808: Added missing database definitions\n\nTwo tables have been added to the SQL schemas under kafkamon\\dbconfig. These caches were added in the previous release as task 22094: KAFKA_TOPIC_PARTITION KAFKA_TOPIC_TOTALS_SERVER\n\n22852: Simplified connection properties\n\nThe instructions for kafkamon connections included the following section, which is now obsolete and should be disregarded: ## The aggregator dataserver (if it is not also a collector) will not include any of the above ## Kafka configuration, but it must include a topic property (without a bootstrap-server) for ## the cluster, e.g. ## ## receiver.sl.rtview.cache.config=kafka_topic_partition_cache_source.rtv $kafkaClusterName:prodCluster\n\nSolace\n\n22721: Support Solace Cloud Edition\n\nSupport for Solace Cloud Edition has been added. Connections can be defined using the RTView Configuration Application.\n\n22787: Wrong metric name in renaming function will generate a wrong zero value\n\nA typo on the name of the spool message size in MB metric for topic endpoints was preventing the correct value to be collected. This typo has been fixed and now the spool message size in MB for topic endpoints is collected properly. Also, several typos on client bridge received bytes metrics have been removed which prevented the correct values to be stored in the SolBridges cache. Now the client received total, data, persistent, non persistent, and direct bytes are stored properly into the cache.\n\n22789: Collect SEMP version automatically to avoid configuration problems\n\nAs of Solace VMR version 8.7+ and Solace Appliance version 8.3+, it is no longer required to include a SEMP version string in connection properties. See https://docs.solace.com/SEMP/Using-Legacy-SEMP.htm. For earlier versions of Solace VMR and Solace Appliance, the SEMP version string should be entered in connection properties. Not using the proper SEMP version string would impair the collection of monitoring metrics. See RTView Solace Solution Package documentation for a description to determine the SEMP version string in your Solace Message Router and to enter this value in your connection properties.\n\nTIBCO ActiveMatrix\n\n22707: New AmxNodeNotRunning alert\n\nThe following alert has been added to amxmon: AmxNodeNotRunning. It triggers if the runtime state of the node is not RUNNING.\n\nTIBCO BusinessWorks\n\n22695: BWAgentPlugin can now get max heap size from java.extended.properties if found\n\nThe Hawk microagent BWAgentPlugin reads the BW engine deployment files to determine the Java max heap allocation. Usually this is given by the property \"java.heap.max\" in the engine's .tra file, but it can also be given by the property \"java.extended.properties.\" The microagent has been enhanced to look for the second property if the first is not found.\n\n22884: bw6mon application table appnode counts and timestamps corrected\n\nIn a situation where there a number of applications with no process execution in any appnode, bw6mon would report incorrectly the number of appnodes per application, and would report the timestamp as zero (blank). These issues have been corrected.\n\n22885: Alert LED indicators now navigate to a page with detailed alert information\n\nThe summary pages have been enhanced with new alert displays. The Application, AppNode, and Container summary pages have alert indicators whose color indicates whether there are current alerts for the displayed item, in the categories relevant to it. Clicking an indicator will now bring up a table listing the alerts in each category. To close this table and restore the previous display, click the Close button. Clicking a row of the alert table will bring up a detail window for the selected alert.\n\n22886: bw6mon appnode summary page heatmap tooltip correction\n\nThe bw appnode summary page has a heatmap of the processes of the appnode. The heatmap cell's tooltip showed an incorrect set of columns. This has been fixed.\n\n22889: bw6mon now correctly displays appnodes if containers are displayed first\n\nIn the BW monitor displays, if a container display was selected followed by an appnode display, the appnode display would not show data correctly. This has been fixed.\n\n22898: BW6 Application Heatmap and AppNode Heatmap bug fixes\n\nIn the case of no processes execution in the lifetime of an application, the application heatmap would not display the application correctly. This has been corrected. The appnode heatmap was not correctly connected to memory usage as indicated. This has been corrected.\n\nVersion 4.0.0 Release Notes\n\n22415: New RTViewDataCollector deliverable\n\nA new deliverable called RTViewDataCollector has been added to the RTView lineup. It is a reduced-size subset of functionality contained in the larger RTView Enterprise Monitor deliverables - meant to be a convenient way to configure remote sender DataServers. It supports all current Solution Packages. It contains a single sample project that can be configured and duplicated as needed, and configured using the new browser-based Config UI. By default the RTViewDataServerSP is configured to be used as a sender, forwarding data to a receiver DataServer. Instructions for installation and use of the RTViewDataCollector are included in a README file in the RTViewDataCollector deliverable.\n\n22416: New RTViewDataServerSP deliverable\n\nA new deliverable called RTViewDataServerSP has been added to the RTView lineup. It is a reduced-size subset of the functionality contained in the larger RTView Enterprise Monitor deliverables - meant to be a convenient way to configure remote DataServers when the central EM installation location is not the optimal location for Solution Package data collection. It supports all current Solution Packages. It can also be used to collect real-time data to be used by RTView Cloud displays. It contains a single sample project that can be configured and duplicated as needed, and configured using the new browser-based Config UI. By default the RTViewDataServerSP is configured to be used as a receiver, listening for additional data being forwarded by sender DataServers. Users who wish to configure sender DataServer's can refer to the new RTViewDataCollector deliverable. Instructions for installation and use of the RTViewDataServerSP are included in a README file in the RTViewDataServerSP deliverable.\n\n22417: New RTViewDataServer deliverable\n\nA new deliverable called RTViewDataServer has been added to the RTView lineup. It is intended primarily for sending real-time data to RTView Cloud displays. Users who wish to leverage existing RTVIew Enterprise Monitor Solution Packages should use the RTViewDataServerSP deliverable. Instructions for installation and use of the RTViewDataServer are included in a README file in the RTViewDataServer deliverable.\n\nConfiguration\n\n22192: Replace emcommon with project-common\n\nThe emsample\\conf\\emcommon.properties file has been replaced with project-common.properties which is editable by the configuration ui. Users upgrading from previous releases can continue to use their existing emcommon.properties file by copying it into the emsample\\conf directory. It will still be read by all emsample servers.\n\n22264: New Configuration application added\n\nRTView EM and its specialized Monitors have been enhanced to support a configuration application. See the documentation for more information.\n\n22284: add rtvadmin to make_war and update_war scripts\n\nThe new rtvadmin war file, which runs the Config UI, has been added to the make_war and update_war scripts\n\n22288: Removed projects\\sample and webapps subdirectories from rtvapm\\sp directories\n\nIn previous releases, each solution package directory under RTVAPM_HOME had projects, ALERTDEFS, HISTORY and webapps subdirectories. Those subdirectories have been removed. The RTVAPM_HOME\\projects\\emsample\\servers directory has sample project directories for all solution packages that can be used instead.\n\n22290: remove server level properties from sp\\conf\\rtvapm.sp.properties files\n\nIn previous releases, each solution package defined its own ports, sender target and server identification properties. These properties have been removed from the solution package properties and should be defined in the project properties instead. The sample projects included in EM have been updated to include these properties which have been set to the same values that they inherited from the solution package properties in previous releases. New projects that do not define these properties will use the following defaults: # data server ports and process identifiers dataserver.sl.rtview.dataserver.port=3278 dataserver.sl.rtview.jvm=-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=3268 dataserver.sl.rtview.cmd_line=-proctag:RTVAPM.RtvDataServer sl.rtview.alert.persistAlertEngineName=RTVAPM sl.rtview.sub=$domainName:SL-RTVAPM-1 # data client dataclient.sl.rtview.dataserver=//localhost:3278 # display server ports and process identifier displayserver.sl.rtview.displayserver.port=3279 displayserver.sl.rtview.jvm=-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=3269 displayserver.sl.rtview.cmd_line=-proctag:RTVAPM.RtvDisplayServer # historian port and identifier historian.sl.rtview.jvm=-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=3267 historian.sl.rtview.cmd_line=-proctag:RTVAPM.RtvHistorian # database port database.sl.rtview.jvm=-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=3261 # sender ports,target and identifier sender.sl.rtview.dataserver.port=3276 sender.sl.rtview.jvm=-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=3266 sender.sl.rtview.sub=$rtvAgentName:MyMachineName # receiver port receiver.sl.rtview.rtvagent.port"
