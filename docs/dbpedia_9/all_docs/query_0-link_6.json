        "text": "Common species names of adephagan water beetles from ten selected European countries are here listed together and translated into English. The proportions of species with common names are compared among countries. The number of names per species is studied in relation to the number of countries it is known from. The meanings of names are categorized and the number of names per category calculated. Distributions of names over categories are compared among selected countries.\n\nAn updated distribution for the endemic, predaceous diving beetle, Heterosternuta sulphuria, consists of four new locations in the Ozark and Boston Mountain ecoregions of Arkansas. To date, a total of 32 specimens have been collected from these locations that are primarily spring-water influenced, small, shaded aquatic systems. Two populations are recorded for currently protected areas; Hobbs State Park-Conservation Area and Sherfield Cave (effluent, stream). The addition of H. sulphuria to the biota list from Sherfield Cave further highlights conservation efforts focussed on this Unique cave and stream system. The habitat. front which H. sulphuria has been collected includes stream margins within sediment-free gravel and cobble substrate, under leaf material covering bedrock, and within small, shallow depressions and crevices in bedrock. From current surveys, H. sulphuria has been the brightly colored member of the Hydroporinae collected from these permanent aquatic habitats and co-occurs only with the genera Sanfilippodytes and Hydrocolus."
