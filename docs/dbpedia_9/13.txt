The beetle suborder Adephaga is the second largest in Coleoptera, comprising >40,000 species. An overview of current phylogenetic hypotheses can be accessed online at Maddison (1995). Adults all exhibit a visible notopleural suture on the prothorax and six abdominal sterna with the first three fused and divided by the metacoxa. Larvae the labrum fused and lack mandibular molae.

Carabidae, the largest adephagan family, is treated separately (Erwin et al. in press.). Here we treat the four other families documented in Peru.

Gyrinidae Latreille, 1802

Diversity in Peru:

3 genera, 19 species.

Recognition:

Gyrinidae is a distinctive family of beetles, instantly recognized by the horizontally divided eyes, very short antennae, and short, paddle-like middle and hind legs.

Habitat:

Adults inhabit lentic habitats and still-water areas of lotic habitats. They characteristically swim in gyrating motions on the air-water interface, and feed on insects and spiders swimming or trapped in the surface film.

Notes:

Blackwelder (1944–1957) recorded three genera and 10 species from Peru. This has been supplemented by Ochs (1953, 1954, 1955), Guignot (1958), Spangler (1966), and Brinck (1977). All Peruvian species belong to the subfamily Gyrininae.

Gyrinus (Oreogyrinus) nigellus Ochs, 1954

Gyrinus (Oreogyrinus) peruvianus Régimbart, 1907

Gyrinus (Oreogyrinus) punctipennis Régimbart, 1907

Noteridae C. G. Thomson, 1860

Diversity in Peru:

3 genera, 4 species.

Recognition:

Noterids are very similar to the more diverse and abundant family Dytiscidae, with which they were formerly classified. Members of Noteridae may be distinguished by having the scutellum concealed (also occurring in some Dytiscidae), and the presence of the “noterid platform”—a contiguous, abrupt, flat area on the ventral surface extending from the prosternal process to the hind coxal plates.

Habitat:

Noterids are aquatic and carnivorous as both adults and larvae, and generally occur in still water with aquatic vascular plants. They predominantly feed on insect eggs and larvae.

Notes:

Noteridae was not recorded from Peru in Blackwelder (1944–1957). The list below is derived from Nilsson (2011); all belong to Noterinae: Noterini according to Miller (2009). More species are anticipated to be found in Peru when more collecting is done for them, especially in Amazonian Peru. Adults are often abundant at light traps.
