        "text": "Have you run out of water in Mutterschied? You can use our map to quickly and easily check whether there is a water fault\n\ninfo\n\nSeveral hundred thousand kilometers of water pipes lie in Germany's soil. The pipes are getting on in years: Over 30 percent of the pipes are more than 40 years old.\n\nMaterial fatigue in old pipes can lead to breaks, which affects the water supply in households. Particularly in spring, when the ground thaws and expands, bursts occur more frequently. However, excavator drivers can also inadvertently cause damage to pipes.\n\nReplacing damaged pipes requires coordination and quick action. Water samples and tests ensure hygienic repairs. Cloudy water may occur for a short time after major bursts or after flushing.\n\nIs there no water coming out of your tap? Do you have brown water? Have you noticed a leak in the immediate vicinity? In these cases, your water supplier is the right person to contact. In 55469 Mutterschied this is .\n\nOf course, it can happen that these hotlines are overloaded. Not so with us: Störungsauskunft.de allows you to report burst pipes and other water faults quickly and easily digitally. If a fault has already been reported by the water supplier, you no longer need to do so. They will already know about it and will take care of rectifying it!\n\nLoad the map to see all the information!"
