        "text": "Newly acquired customer can buy whole damn catalog while loyal customer can buy new release or two. So whose value is higher for future growth? Do the math.\n\nLoyal customers helped to build position of a company during all those years up to date, invested in them, trusted, helped them grow. True. And VSL updated their software and libraries for years, but you can't do that ad infinitum. Value of this loyalty is rather low when it comes to future revenue stream. As a loyal customer you are at the top of your life time value, a juiceless lemon.\n\nSaying that, I agree thet VSL should prepare (and most likely they will) some migration promotion so people can Synchronize their stuff as cheap as possible.\n\nDisclaimer I own only a few VI libraries, but always preferred VI as a sample player. Fortuantely I'm on Windows so most likely won't see issues for a time being.\n\nAnd suggestions like removing iLok are bonkers ideas business-wise, it equals to VSL becoming public domain available across every torrent store. Suicide for a company.\n\n[...]\n\nAnd suggestions like removing iLok are bonkers ideas business-wise, it equals to VSL becoming public domain available across every torrent store. Suicide for a company.\n\nBonkers ideas business-wise? Perhaps. Most certainly, it is understandable. Why take that risk. However, it would be unwise to think that iLok is not able to be reverse-engineered. For all we know, there could already have been some success on that front internally. Things like EoL of a piece of software/sample library (as is the case here), bad dev support, scummy tactics (not that the latter two apply here; those are just examples) are what attract reverse-engineer's interest the most.\n\nLook at consoles (video game consoles): Once the next one is released, emulation for the previous one really ramps up (the beginning of it sometimes happens during the life of the \"dying\" one, but it ramps up once the devs move on to the next gen console). Not a 1:1 comparison, but the idea kind of still applies.\n\nSometimes, what's best business-wise isn't what's best customer-wise and vice-versa, but businesses have to keep the lights on, and I can definitely understand the fear of removing protection from something so precious, even if you don't plan on selling it anymore (I know: the SY-izd versions are very similar with some upgrades).\n\nI’m in the same situation as others here.. I have almost the full VI Super package, I think I’m just missing a couple of the vocal libraries. I bought most of the libraries a while back and spent at least $7000-$8000 on them. I also have a lot of the Synchron catalog (thousands spent on them too), but I haven’t been interested in cross grading to Synchronized libraries because I prefer VI Pro for the VI series.\n\nI just checked and my price to crossgrade my VI libraries to the Synchronized package is close to $2000, which I’m sorry but I feel is OUTRAGEOUS. I wouldn’t even consider paying half of that for something that I don’t really want. I get that there’s a cost involved in editing samples for the Synchron player, but the Synchronized libraries weren’t developed for VI users, they’re a major part of the VSL catalog and allowed VSL to repurpose their existing samples to the new player.\n\nAfter spending so much with VSL over the years this is kind of the straw that’s breaking the camel’s back. I get that it probably doesn’t make sense to support two engines, but it was their decision to move to the Synchron player, they could’ve kept developing VI Pro, added multi-mic support, etc.\n\nWhat makes this discussion more odd to me is that it comes at a time when library developers themselves (including @Ben) are saying that it’s a troubled industry. I know that I’ve spent a lot on libraries over the years, but these days I’ve significantly curtailed my spending. Part of it is the uncertainty in the industry, and part of it is the amount of libraries that I’ve already purchased. It just seems like a bad time to penalize your existing customers.\n\nAnd no, it’s not being ‘entitled’ to consider it a penalty to be asked to pay another $2000 just to be able to continue to use the libraries that we’ve already spent thousands on, wrapped in a different player.\n\nI get that it probably doesn’t make sense to support two engines, but it was their decision to move to the Synchron player, they could’ve kept developing VI Pro, added multi-mic support, etc.\n\nIf this would be possible we would not have developed Synchron Player in the first place, which was a multi-million investment.\n\nAnd no, it’s not being ‘entitled’ to consider it a penalty to be asked to pay another $2000 just to be able to continue to use the libraries that we’ve already spent thousands on, wrapped in a different player.\n\nNobody is forcing you to switch, and libraries will continue to work. We are not going to pull the plug, nor will we revoke licenses.\n\nWe simply will no longer provide updates.\n\nI posted this in the commercial thread, but I’m hoping that someone might help here. The major VSL orchestral instruments that sound the most realistic to me so far other than the pianos are the VI woodwinds; if I’m going to try for those, it sounds like now’s the time, but I’d also want a solid “upgrade” path to SYNCHRON-ized to have more than 18 months with the samples. I also would want a darn good deal out of it since VSL is pricey, and I’m not happy with this move either.\n\nI have not been able to sort out the offerings, much less the pricing, and most threads are outdated. Anyone have a good summary or link to one?\n\nIt's passing hard to predict at what point Mac OS will do something that makes VI Pro incompatible, and it's probably going to be slower to occur on the Windows side, so the sky is not exactly falling.\n\nAs per the Synchron-ized WW, I have that product (somewhat surprisingly as the current price is 445 euro). In some cases it's more articulate. I don't think I got any break on it. By comparison I looked at Bass Flute (to check the articulations list) and my price is 18 euro, while if I bought it again as VI it's 33. Now, the Bb Clarinet #2 (12 multiphonics artics was the attractor here) is very close version to version. The Synchron-ized has a fluttertongue Marcato with a Staccato in that tree branch the VI doesn't, but no fluttert. crescendo. Beyond that, it's a matter of liking the visual layout. Here is one I actually prefer the Synchron-ized more minimal view. I remember needing fluttert. cresc once so...\n\nAnd suggestions like removing iLok are bonkers ideas business-wise, it equals to VSL becoming public domain available across every torrent store. Suicide for a company.\n\nA lot of defunct software can still do licensing thing without needing always be connected online. Idk how it works for the older Spitfire BML stuff but I’m pretty sure they can still work offline on your old computer without needing to be connected to the internet. It’s trying to have your cake and eating it too if you want to stop selling a product and stop supporting it but expect people who already bought it to be connected online just to be able to use it.\n\nI just checked and my price to crossgrade my VI libraries to the Synchronized package is close to $2000, which I’m sorry but I feel is OUTRAGEOUS.\n\nYeah I don’t think this is the norm either. Going back to Spitfire, I think upgrading to SSW, SSB, SSS from the BML stuff was a small price. Then if you have them, you can go for SSO Complete free, or at least discounted if you have parts of it. The Berlin Series upgrade from Kontakt to SINE is a minuscule amount.\n\nYou’re likely better off jumping to newer libraries like Synchron or to other developers with that price.\n\nDo you have some evidence to back that up, or is it pure conjecture (referring to the quote above, of course)?\n\nWell, cornet is included only in Sample Modeling Brass, for example, but SM Brass doesn't have euphonium, Wagner tuba or cimbasso. Infinite Brass doesn't have flugelhorn, Wagner tuba or cornet. Berlin Brass doesn't have cornet, flugelhorn, cimbasso, Wagner tuba (even in expansions). It starts adding up. And the libraries that have those instruments don't come with as many articulations as VSL. VSL's own Synchron Brass is even more limited in that aspect than Berlin Brass or Audiobro's Modern Scoring Brass. What I have mentioned is only one instrument group (brass). You would have to buy several libraries from each instrument group to have a sort of comparable collection. Then there is the question of consistency, different room sounds, etc. A very consistent, dry library (like the VI series) resolves many of those problems, especially with the help of a couple of (now also discontinued) MIRx extensions. But you may have other priorities. I prefer working with notation programs so I tend to need many articulations and a variety of instruments.\n\nI’m in the same situation as others here..

I just don’t understand such disdain for loyal customers.\n\nWell, cornet is included only in Sample Modeling Brass, for example, but SM Brass doesn't have euphonium, Wagner tuba or cimbasso.

They've done the woodwinds and there is the rare basset horn, bass flute, various Clarinets (A, Eb, etc.). I'm sure they will do brass justice.\n\nOf course, one still has to buy those, but the cost wouldn't necessarily add up to $1000s."
