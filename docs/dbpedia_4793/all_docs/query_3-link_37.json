If you find satisfaction in thinking logically and creatively about technology, working as a software engineer may be a good fit for you.\n\nContinue reading to learn about the typical responsibilities, career paths, and compensation for software engineers.\n\nPopular Online Software Engineering Programs\n\nLearn about start dates, transferring credits, availability of financial aid, and more by contacting the universities below.\n\nHistory of Software Engineers\n\nIn 1963, Margaret Hamilton, coined the term software engineering while working on developing the software for the Apollo spacecraft. At this time, software development faced a crisis in trying to keep up with the progress in hardware development. This period led to the rise of software engineering by introducing new programs and languages.\n\nIn 1968 and 1969, the NATO Software Engineering Conference took place, giving the software engineering industry a much-needed boost. By the 1980s, software engineering secured its place alongside the computer science and traditional engineering professions.\n\nWhat Does a Software Engineer Do?\n\nSoftware engineers create and maintain programs to address user needs. They typically work on teams to design, develop, test, and document applications. They also work with other stakeholders to determine user requirements and gather feedback for further improvements.\n\nAlthough you may hear the terms \"software engineer\" and \"software developer\" used interchangeably, the two roles have different emphases. Software engineers tend to focus on \"big picture\" design while developers tend to focus on programming work. In practice, however, software engineers often write original code.\n\nAspiring software engineers should note several challenges associated with the role. Engineers must manage accelerating technological advancement and ever-changing user needs. Additionally, teams can face significant pressure to meet tight deadlines.\n\nKey Responsibilities for Software Engineers\n\nUnderstand User Requirements\n\nSoftware engineers create solutions for users. In order to design effective software, engineers must understand user requirements and familiarize themselves with the user's industry. Additionally, while some organizations have dedicated personnel for gathering user requirements, smaller companies may require their software engineers to perform this function.\n\nEnsure Security\n\nIn addition to satisfying user requirements, engineers must design solutions that comply with organizational and industry security standards. Because the tech landscape changes so rapidly, software engineers must continually learn and implement new security best practices.\n\nDesign Software\n\nSoftware engineers must design systems that address user needs. This typically involves communicating a broad outline of the software's functionality to a team of developers. Engineers must communicate clearly and effectively to their team in order to prevent wasted labor.\n\nCreate Documentation\n\nEngineers must provide reference documentation for their software, both for the user and for other engineers and developers on their team. Users need documentation to help them utilize a product to its maximum potential, and other engineers need documentation to facilitate future maintenance.\n\nMaintain and Improve Software\n\nEven after a software product rolls out, engineers must continue to test and verify its functionality. Additionally, teams may receive requests for additional features. Regular testing and updates help ensure a positive and consistent user experience.\n\nA few of the most popular programming languages software engineers need to know include:\n\nJava: This programming language produces software on multiple platforms without the need for recompilation.

Browser-operated programs facilitate GUI and object interaction from users.\n\nJavaScript: This scripting programming language allows users to perform complex tasks. Most web pages are written in Javascript. This language allows users to update content, animate images, operate multimedia, and store variables. JavaScript represents one of the web's three major technologies.\n\nSQL: Also known as Structured Query Language, SQL queries, updates, modifies, deletes, and inserts data. To achieve this, SQL uses a set number of commands. This computer language is standard for data manipulation and relational database management. Professionals use SQL to manage structured data where relationships between variables and entities exist.\n\nC++: Regarded as an object-oriented, general-purpose programming language, C++ uses both low and high-level language. Since virtually all computers contain C++, software engineers must understand this language. C++ encompasses most C programs without switching the source code line. C++ primarily manipulates text, numbers, and other computer-capable tasks.\n\nC#: Initially developed for Microsoft, this highly expressive program language is simpler than other languages, yet it includes components of C++ and Java. Generic types and methods provide additional safety and increased performance. C# also allows professionals to define iteration behavior while supporting encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.\n\nPython: This high-level programming language contains dynamic semantics, structures, typing, and binding that connect existing components; however, the Python syntax is easy to learn with no compilation stage involved, reducing program maintenance and enhancing productivity. Python also supports module and package use, which allows engineers to use the language for varying projects.\n\nWhat Is a Typical Day for a Software Engineer?\n\nThe typical day-to-day for a software engineer varies based on the industry, size, and work culture of a given organization. Many development teams begin the day with a brief \"stand-up\" meeting so team members can share updates on a project's progress and identify potential challenges.\n\nAt larger companies, software engineers may spend more time on core duties like designing and documenting applications. Depending on the team, senior software engineers may also have management responsibilities, which can involve regular check-ins with team members, conducting performance reviews, and reporting to higher management.\n\nIf you work for a smaller organization, you may need to fulfill several other functions. For example, without personnel dedicated to testing, you may need to focus more time on troubleshooting, maintenance, and quality control. Additionally, while software engineers typically focus on the big picture, smaller teams may require you both to design and develop an application. Finally, you may need to work directly with clients to determine requirements and gather feedback.\n\nHow Much Do Software Engineers Make?\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), software developers earned a median salary of $132,270 in 2023. Individuals working in the software publishing industry were the highest earners, with a median annual wage of $143,210. Additionally, the BLS projects a 25% increase in software engineer positions through 2032, indicating plenty of future growth.\n\nWhat Are the Career Paths for Software Engineers?\n\nThose with a degree and experience in software engineering can explore different computing career options.
