        "text": "The repositories for older releases that are not supported (like 11.04, 11.10 and 13.04) get moved to an archive server. There are repositories available at http://old-releases.ubuntu.com.\n\nThe reason for this is that it is now out of support and no longer receiving updates and security patches.\n\nI would urge you to consider a supported distribution. If your computer is too old in terms of memory or processor then you should consider a distribution such as Lubuntu or Xubuntu.\n\nIf you want to continue using an outdated release then edit /etc/apt/sources.list and change archive.ubuntu.com and security.ubuntu.com to old-releases.ubuntu.com.\n\nYou can do this with sed:\n\nsudo sed -i -re 's/([a-z]{2}\\.)?archive.ubuntu.com|security.ubuntu.com/old-releases.ubuntu.com/g' /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nthen update with:\n\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nSometimes, it might be faster to create backups of your system and reinstall using supported release instead.\n\nSource: Can I keep using Ubuntu 9.04 if it's outdated?\n\nTo upgrade to a new release:\n\nOnce you have performed the above steps to switch to the old-releases mirrors, update the Update Manager and then do do-release-upgrade:\n\nsudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install ubuntu-release-upgrader-core sudo do-release-upgrade\n\nSee also EOLUpgrades - Community Help Wiki.\n\nWhat are 404 errors\n\nThe 404 or Not Found error message is a HTTP standard response code indicating that the client was able to communicate with the server, but the server could not find what was requested.\n\nThe web site hosting server will typically generate \"404 - Page Not Found\" web page, when users attempts to follow a broken or dead link.\n\nWhy are we facing 404 errors\n\nUbuntu follows the approach of two different release cycles:\n\nNormal Ubuntu releases are supported for 9 months. LTS releases are supported for 5 years.\n\nPast releases may have different support schedules (for example, normal releases (before 13.04) used to be supported for 18 months, while LTS releases (before 12.04) used to be supported for 3 years on the desktop and 5 years on the server).\n\nEOL: Once the support period for a particular release is over; they are called End Of Life (EOL) and all the updates and package repositories for that Release are transferred to a different server which results in 404 errors while running sudo apt-get update. You can confirm if your release has become EOL by going to this page. If your Ubuntu release is mentioned under \"End Of Life (EOL)\" Table, then the release is no longer supported and you should try to upgrade to a newer supported release. However, if you wish to continue using this unsupported release, you would have to make necessary modifications in /etc/apt/sources.list to point to the old-releases server of Ubuntu.\n\nSteps to make necessary modifications\n\nOpen your Terminal:\n\nPress Ctrl + Alt + T; OR\n\nIf you have Gnome: Applications → Accessories → Terminal; OR\n\nIf you have Unity: press Super (the key between Left Ctrl and Left Alt) and query for Terminal.\n\nRun the following command to enter into root shell:\n\nsudo -i\n\ninput your user password and press Enter. The prompt would change and would indicate that the root user is now logged in. Here run the following command:\n\ngedit /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nThe file would open in a new Gedit window. Find the first line which doesn't start with #. Suppose you are running Karmic Koala (Ubuntu 9.10): it should be like the following line:\n\ndeb <siteurl> karmic main restricted\n\nwhere, <siteurl> is your preferred server - http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu in your case (for example).\n\nPress Ctrl + H to replace your <siteurl> with http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu.\n\nSearch for: http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu ie; <siteurl>\n\nReplace with: http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu and\n\nPress Replace All\n\nOnce again:\n\nSearch for: http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu (this exact url for all the Ubuntu Releases — whatever be the present server that you are using)\n\nReplace with: http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu\n\nPress Replace All\n\nSave your file and exit Gedit.\n\nRun the following command to get out of root shell:\n\nlogout\n\nYou would find that the prompt switches back to indicate that your normal user is now logged in. Then run the following:\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThere you go. No 404 Errors this time. You can now install all the available packages for your Ubuntu Release. You can also run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade to install any Security/Bug-fix updates which have not yet been installed but you won't get any further Security/Bug-fix updates from Ubuntu.\n\nThe short answer is to add the next apt repository to the Third-Party Software (or Other Software in newer versions) in Software Sources (or Software & Updates in newer versions):\n\ndeb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu code_name main restricted universe multiverse\n\nThe long answer...\n\nGUI Method\n\nWell, actually we will do this without using any terminal. Not even once. Just GUI, I promise ;-)\n\nFirst, open Software Sources (or Software & Updates in newer versions). It does not matter how old your Ubuntu is, there is certainly something like this. For Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope), look at next image to see where it's located:\n\nAfter Software Sources (or Software & Updates) is open, go in Ubuntu Software and Updates tabs and unselect everything like in next pictures. You don't need these things anymore since your Ubuntu version is End of Life:\n\nWithout closing Software Sources (or Software & Updates), go in Third-Party Software (for newest releases, this tab is named Other Software) tab and add a new apt repository. Insert exactly next line when you are asked:\n\ndeb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jaunty main restricted universe multiverse\n\nIf your version of Ubuntu is not 9.04, replace in the above line jaunty with your Ubuntu codename (for example, if you have Ubuntu 9.10, replace it with karmic and so on):\n\nNow, when you will close Software Sources (or Software & Updates), you will be asked to reload the information about available software. Just be sure that you have a working internet connection:\n\nAnd now, you are free to download almost whatever you want. For 9.04, you can use Synaptic Package Manager. For newest releases, there is Ubuntu Software Center.\n\nFor example, to install VLC in Ubuntu 9.04 using Synaptic Package Manager, follow the instructions in the following pictures:\n\nIf you want to Update your Ubuntu to a new release, just go to System > Update Manager:\n\nI tested this method from a live session of Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope) and as you can see from these pictures it worked. If you are on an installed session of Ubuntu, you will be asked sometimes for root or admin password. Just insert your personal user password when you are asked.\n\nI got here since I could not upgrade a system from 15.10 (EOL) to 16.04. But none of the answers worked for me, even after doing everything that was suggested here I kept getting from sudo do-release-upgrade the annoying response:\n\nChecking for a new Ubuntu release No new release found\n\nAnd I had no success in running update-manager; it kept throwing exceptions which I could not resolve. I suspect something is corrupted in my 15.10 installation, but the bottom line is that the built-in upgrades just fail.\n\nSo I looked for a non-built-in method, and sure enough I found it looking at What does `do-release-upgrade` really do?.\n\nHere is the solution that worked for me:\n\nOpen http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/meta-release\n\nLocate the release you want to upgrade to. In my case it was Xenial Xerus (16.04 Long Term Support). You can find the corresponding codenames on Release - Ubuntu Wiki.\n\nLocate the UpgradeTool URL. For xenial it was http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/xenial-updates/main/dist-upgrader-all/current/xenial.tar.gz. Download the tarball from that URL into an empty folder and and extract it.\n\nLocate the executable file with the same name as the distribution (in my case xenial). Run it with sudo:\n\nsudo ./xenial &\n\nApprove the upgrade, and wait for the download to complete - there's thousands of files and likely over a Gigabyte. Proceed with installing the upgrade.\n\nWait until it completes, approve if asked. I don't recall the exact details\n\nAfter the reboot the new version is running successfully, and all updates can be fetched normally.\n\nWhile fossfreedom's answer does a good job of describing and solving the problem, I've found a variant solution that I think is easier and a little more elegant.\n\nThe trick is to add http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ as a mirror, and then tell Software Sources to switch to that mirror.\n\nTo do this, backup and edit /usr/share/python-apt/templates/Ubuntu.mirrors. Choose a fake location for the old-releases server (e.g. #LOC:US), and add the following line under it:\n\n#LOC:US http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/\n\nNow open the system's Software Sources dialog, and manually select old-releases.ubuntu.com as though it were your regional mirror. You should find it listed under the fake location you chose in the previous step.\n\nThe next time you reload your package information via Synaptic or Update Manager, you should see it successfully retrieving updated package information.\n\nUpgrade a very old Ubuntu\n\nIf your Ubuntu (Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Mythbuntu, whatever-buntu) is really old, you will have to take three steps to upgrade to an up-to-date version:\n\nHack the package updater (APT) to upgrade your system to the latest available in the old-releases repository (including the release upgrade manager).\n\nHack the release upgrade manager to make it agree to upgrade to the next (officially unsupported) release.\n\nDo the actual release upgrade (and repeat).\n\nRemember, you are only allowed to upgrade from one \"normal\" release to the next and from a Long Time Support (LTS) release to the next LTS release.\n\nUpdate the system to the newest available in http://old-releases.ubuntu.com\n\nSet the package sources to old-releases.ubuntu.com and update\n\nsudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.save sudo sed -i -re 's/([a-z]{2}\\.)?archive.ubuntu.com|security.ubuntu.com/old-releases.ubuntu.com/g' /etc/apt/sources.list sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade && sudo apt autoremove\n\nHere you can try a release upgrade if your current release is not too old (sudo do-release-upgrade). If it fails, you may find some clues in /var/log/dist-upgrade/main.log which could help to find a fix.\n\nIf your release is too old, go to next step.\n\nConfigure the release upgrade manager with local data\n\nRetrieve the meta-release files\n\nwget -O - http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/meta-release > meta-release wget -O - http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/meta-release-lts > meta-release-lts\n\nEdit meta-release to set all the next releases as supported\n\nYou must set Supported: 1 for each release.\n\nExample: I was on Ubuntu 17.04 (Zesty Zapus) and set all the releases supported starting from artful.\n\nDist: artful Name: Artful Aardvark Version: 17.10 Date: Thu, 19 October 2017 17:10:00 UTC Supported: 1 Description: This is the 17.10 release Release-File: http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/artful-updates/Release ReleaseNotes: http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/EOLReleaseAnnouncement UpgradeTool: http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/artful-updates/main/dist-upgrader-all/current/artful.tar.gz UpgradeToolSignature: http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/artful-updates/main/dist-upgrader-all/current/artful.tar.gz.gpg …\n\nAlso, check that the URLs for UpgradeTool and UpgradeToolSignature start with http://old-releases.ubuntu.com (not http://archive.ubuntu.com).\n\nEdit /etc/update-manager/meta-release to point on local meta-release\n\nReplace the original URIs with URIs pointing on your local meta-release files\n\n[METARELEASE] URI = file:///home/chris/meta-release URI_LTS = file:///home/chris/meta-release-lts URI_UNSTABLE_POSTFIX = -development URI_PROPOSED_POSTFIX = -proposed\n\nUpgrade\n\nsudo do-release-upgrade sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade && sudo apt autoremove\n\nReboot when asked to.\n\nRedo it until your system is up to date.\n\nWhen asked, answer that you want to keep your edited version of /etc/update-manager/meta-release excepted on the last upgrade.\n\nWhen you are stuck to an old release\n\nThe process described above worked for me to upgrade to an unsupported release, and then to the last LTS release and I couldn't upgrade anymore.\n\nWhat I did: Ubuntu 17.04 (Zesty Zapus) → Ubuntu 17.10 (Artful Aardvark) → Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver)\n\nThen I found the -p (--proposed) option of do-release-upgrade.\n\ndo-release-upgrade -p\n\nIt tries to upgrade to the newest available release! And it worked: I skipped two releases and jumped directly from Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) to Ubuntu 19.10 (Eoan Ermine)!\n\nMaybe it would have worked to upgrade Ubuntu 17.04 (Zesty Zapus) to Ubuntu 19.10 (Eoan Ermine) in one run.\n\nThere is an edge case - apt-get claims 16.04 LTS does not exist - where the old package (Vivid, in my case) was not in on the \"old-releases\" server. But apt-get could only find kernel and Google updates.\n\nI am not sure exactly what my problem was because I had blindly followed the accepted answers sed command (never a smart move).\n\nThis did not work because Vivid was not in the \"old-releases\" archive but was still on the gb.archive.ubuntu.com mirror.\n\nIn that specific case, the solution was as follows:\n\nsudo -i edit /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nCarefully go through all the sources and discover one of them was old and wrong and had failed to be properly updated (or something). Or, as I did, search replace from old-releases.ubuntu.com to gb.archive.ubuntu.com. It then upgraded, without a problem, to the next release while I caught up on some reading.\n\nSo either:\n\nThere was a fault in my sources\n\nThe gb.archive.unbuntu.com mirror has an older set of releases.\n\nThe takeaway here is that while the majority of answers here may apply in some cases it would pay to be sure that your /etc/apt/sources.list is correct before you nuke it for the \"old-releases\" archive.\n\nYou can figure out which of the archive or your mirror has the version you need by simply pointing a browser tab at the archive and question and looking for your version name in the folder list. Whichever one has your version, is the source you need to use.\n\n18.10 to 19.10 Ubuntu upgrade\n\nIf you have EOL release and if you do not afraid of reinstalling your system from scratch or just without formatting this older system, than you could try it. It tried only of curiocity and for testing purposes. Not real hardware, but VM have been used for this. DO NOT USE IT ON PROD. But strangely if you have EOL on prod.\n\nTrying to correctly answer the question I've installed Ubuntu 18.10 eol into VirtualBox VM.\n\nI changed current /etc/apt/sources.list to 18.04 Ubuntu's version:\n\ndeb http://ua.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic main restricted deb http://ua.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic-updates main restricted deb http://ua.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic universe deb http://ua.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic-updates universe deb http://ua.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic multiverse deb http://ua.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic-updates multiverse deb http://ua.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic-backports main restricted universe multiverse deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu bionic partner deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic-security main restricted deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic-security universe deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic-security multiverse\n\nChanged /etc/lsb-release to:\n\nDISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu DISTRIB_RELEASE=18.04 DISTRIB_CODENAME=bionic DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu 18.04 lts\"\n\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade && sudo do-release-upgrade\n\nDuring upgrade it failed to restart different services and even rejected to reboot or shutdown correctly. I've powered the VM off and started it again.\n\nIt started without issues.\n\n$ cat /etc/lsb-release && uname -a DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu DISTRIB_RELEASE=19.10 DISTRIB_CODENAME=eoan DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu 19.10\" Linux ubuntu18 5.3.0-40-generic #32-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jan 31 20:24:34 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nTesting:\n\nApplications are opened correctly.\n\n/etc/apt/sources.list have been generated with duplicates of eoan repositories, so I've removed excessive records and now it is:\n\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ eoan main restricted deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ eoan-updates main restricted deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ eoan universe deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ eoan-updates universe deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ eoan multiverse deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ eoan-updates multiverse deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu eoan-security main restricted deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu eoan-security universe deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu eoan-security multiverse\n\nInstalled scribus, snap, mariadb-server, docker, openssh-server using sudo apt install without issues.\n\nInstalled gimp using snap: snap install gimp --classic (Authentication prompt appeared and after password input installation started)\n\nIt looks like a usual stable 19.10 Ubuntu system upgraded correctly as my host is.\n\nIn my case I was stuck in 19.04 for months because I didn't upgrades at time and I wasn't able to do the upgrade to 19.10 after that time. But the other day, Ubuntu automatically gives me the option to do a Partial Upgrade to 19.10 (maybe because I did a lot of stuff weeks ago, but sorry, I can't be sure the reason). So I did it and the result of lsb_release -a was Ubuntu 19.10. So I think I could be able to do another upgrade to 20.04.1, but isn't possible because 19.10 reached EOL.\n\nThe solution what I found today, 16 December 2020, to make an upgrade in Ubuntu 19.10 in EOL is to:\n\nEdit /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nCopy the following sources list (https://gist.github.com/ishad0w/788555191c7037e249a439542c53e170) :\n\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal main restricted universe multiverse deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal main restricted universe multiverse deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal-updates main restricted universe multiverse deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal-updates main restricted universe multiverse deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal-security main restricted universe multiverse deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal-security main restricted universe multiverse deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal-backports main restricted universe multiverse deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal-backports main restricted universe multiverse deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu focal partner deb-src http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu focal partner\n\nPaste it to your sources.list and disable with # the Eoan links.\n\nIn a terminal: update-manager. This will open the Software Updater window and check for updates and upgrades. Here is where I be able to make another Partial Upgrade, in this case, to 20.04.1LTS. Another lsb_release -a shows that I am in 20.04.1LTS.\n\nI hope this will serve for someone, someday.\n\nMerry Christmas to all."
