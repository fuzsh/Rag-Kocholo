        "text": "Construction\n\nCoordinating it was not only a demanding task for me but also a valuable lesson. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve decided to share some insight with you. I think it‚Äôs a perfect time to rewind and take a closer look at the whole process of construction and renovation itself.\n\nSome people say that software development is like construction. To heck with ‚Äúsome people‚Äù ‚Äì when I talk to a non-technical client, it happens that I use this comparison myself. üòâ\n\nFor example, you can compare a framework to a solid basement. Or backend to the ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù parts of the house (foundations) which are extremely important for the final building (frontend). And so on. But is it accurate? Being the CTO of the software development company and having dozens of projects completed, makes me feel confident to try and compare the area of my expertise with the construction project I had a chance to coordinate.\n\nIt was my first construction project of this size, so I was not only a client, a novice but also a non-technical partner who knows nothing about this particular ‚Äútechnology‚Äù (i.e. construction industry). It was a valuable experience for me, as normally I stand on the other side of a relation between a builder (developer) and a client.\n\nDuring the construction process, I had to coordinate the work of 11 working crews managed by 11 supervisors who had to arrange and renovate around 1600 m2 of the office space. I was really curious if you can easily compare these two industries.\n\nBelow, I‚Äôll try to present its similarities and differences I‚Äôve noticed during the construction process. Also, I‚Äôve pointed out some of the conclusions I‚Äôve come up with.\n\nSimilarities\n\nThe same questions\n\n‚ÄúHow much is it?‚Äù and ‚Äúwhen can I expect the results?‚Äù. And just like in software development ‚Äì it isn‚Äôt easy to estimate total expenses.\n\nMultitude of options\n\nWhen you need to develop an app, there are many possible solutions ‚Äì exactly as when you build a house. Also, even if you have an exact specification (which is even more precise in the construction industry), there are still a lot of questions that appear during the development.\n\nQuality is the key\n\nYou shouldn‚Äôt save on quality ‚Äì whether you need to build a house or develop an app. The truth is that low costs = poor quality in both software development and the construction industry.\n\nSome specific, internal processes\n\nIn construction, there are design, ventilation, sewage system, plasters, paintings and finishing ‚Äì processes which need to come one after another but also mesh with each other and sometimes need to be repeated. Doesn‚Äôt it sound like the iterative model in IT?\n\nAs in IT strong division into two groups: technical and non-technical people.\n\nThe first ones use complicated jargon and look down on the second ones who don‚Äôt understand a single word. For example ‚Äì do you know what veneering is? It‚Äôs simply about arranging two surfaces in one line.\n\nI‚Äôve heard this term multiple times before I learned (from context!) its meaning. Using jargon by developers in IT looks exactly the same for a non-technical person.\n\nCommonness of misunderstandings\n\nEven though you‚Äôve signed piles of documentation files and agreements, there‚Äôs always a person who works on a particular part of the project and complains that he or she wasn‚Äôt informed clearly enough about how to do something, making lots of excuses.\n\nOn the other hand, if something is not agreed upon in a straightforward way, the same person will simply choose the easiest way to do it.\n\nAesthetics ‚Äì or rather the lack of them\n\nFor any technical person (in both construction and software development industries) they are in the background.\n\nFor example, our ‚Äúgreen wall‚Äù in the dining room is covered with reindeer lichen (very nice-looking and quite useful kind-of-moss thingy) and during the construction work, it turned out that in the middle of this wall there need to be two huge ventilation grills.\n\nObviously, we didn‚Äôt want them to be on that wall as they would destroy the whole visual effect, however, the workers were more than surprised ‚Äì they only thought about the functionality, not about the aesthetics.\n\nOn the other hand, in both industries, there are people who care about the final, visual effect.\n\nThat‚Äôs why both industries need technicians and designers.\n\nCosts never grow in a linear way\n\nThis means that for twice as much money you wouldn‚Äôt get a twice as good product. At some point, you have to spend a lot to get just the slightly better thing, but that‚Äôs the cost of being the best.\n\nInvisible yet costly elements\n\nBoth industries are full of invisible yet essential things. Like the backend in IT or sewage system in a building that usually costs you more than you expect (especially if you simply don‚Äôt understand them).\n\nExcuses\n\nI thought that software developers are the ‚Äúmasters of excuses‚Äù but actually builders are even better. Well, it seems that in all industries, all delays or mistakes are explained with a variety of prepared, sophisticated excuses. Or the fault is blamed on someone else.\n\nLittle is at it seems\n\nMany things look way more complicated than they are and‚Ä¶ conversely. Some elements of construction look difficult to be changed but, in fact, sometimes it‚Äôs relatively easy. For example, I thought that moving a wall a few centimeters further is a huge problem.\n\nIt turned out that it‚Äôs easier than, let‚Äôs say, rearranging wires on the same wall. Very similar surprises await you in the world of software development.\n\nThe framework\n\nFinally, I found out that, in construction, there‚Äôs something called a ‚Äúframework‚Äù! It means nothing more than using different elements of interior finish which fit each other (have a matching colour, shape, etc.).\n\nDifferences\n\nThe final price\n\nIn the construction industry is a component of two elements:\n\nthe cost of materials\n\nand labor.\n\nAt The Software House (and in a variety of other software development companies based mostly on FOSS) it‚Äôs almost only about the labor.\n\nWhen talking about the material costs, it‚Äôs way easier to explain why it‚Äôs worth paying more for high-quality floor tiles than trying to justify the price of something as ‚Äúabstract‚Äù as the better quality code. At least to non-technical clients.\n\nTurnover rate\n\nCrew members change very often in the construction industry and it‚Äôs pretty rare in software development. It‚Äôs mainly because of the domain knowledge and difficulty in replacing a developer.\n\nSubcontractors\n\nA vital part of the construction industry is the presence of a variety of subcontractors. It‚Äôs a substantial difference compared to software development. It‚Äôs caused by industry specificity ‚Äì you need electricians, plasterers, sewer workers, plumbers, fitters, and so on. And when you develop a piece of software, normally there‚Äôs only one contractor ‚Äì the software house that you outsource to.\n\nOf course, software houses also cooperate with some trusted vendors supplying them with the additional workforce, but usually, it‚Äôs a deeply internal process that is transparent to the customer.\n\nScalability\n\nIn the construction industry, it‚Äôs easier to speed up the work by increasing the number of workers. In IT, it won‚Äôt help ‚Äì or even could make things worse.\n\nImportance of money\n\nSome issues seem to be difficult to solve or change in the construction industry without money. As the construction industry is way more budget-focused than the IT industry. In software development, at the estimation stage, you agree on the price, but you also indicate that the final expenses may vary depending on the development.\n\nIn the construction industry, you get the exact estimation and a construction plan beforehand and it‚Äôs difficult to perform any changes during the construction process unless you mention that you‚Äôre willing to pay more.\n\nChange\n\nSome things during the building process cannot be changed. For example, they need to meet fire protection standards. In IT almost everything can be changed (but sometimes it requires more time).\n\nDurability\n\nIn software development, it‚Äôs way easier to develop a product that will work forever. In construction, it‚Äôs different ‚Äì you must consider a variety of factors (and spend lots of money) before you decide on a solution that won‚Äôt break down easily."
