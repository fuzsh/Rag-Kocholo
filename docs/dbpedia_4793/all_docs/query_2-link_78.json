        "text": "With effect from 1 October 2020, the fees (excluding Business Registration Fee and Levy) payable for an application for incorporation of a local company delivered in electronic form through the e-Services at the e-Services Portal will be reduced by 10%. The reduction does not apply to application delivered to the Registry in hard copy form. The details of application fees are as follows:\n\nApplicable for application delivered in electronic form\n\nThe application fee for incorporation of a local company having a share capital is HK$1,545. If your application is unsuccessful, you can apply for a refund of the registration fee of HK$1,280 (the lodgment fee of HK$265 is non-refundable).\n\nThe registration fee for incorporation of a company limited by guarantee is calculated according to the number of members stated in the Incorporation Form (Form NNC1G) of the company. The registration fee is HK$155 (with 25 members or less), HK$305 (with number of members exceeding 25 but not exceeding 100), and HK305 plus HK$18 for every additional 50 members (or less) after first 100 members, subject to a maximum of HK$925.\n\nApplicable for application delivered in hard copy form\n\nThe application fee for incorporation of a local company having a share capital is HK$1,720.

Hence, the prescribed business registration fee and levy must also be delivered together with the Notice to Business Registration Office (IRBR1) and the incorporation documents. Please refer to the Business Registration Fee and Levy Table for the correct amount of fees payable.\n\nThe Articles of Association (AA) is not a specified form. You may refer to the Companies (Model Articles) Notice (Cap. 622H) which prescribes Model Articles for public companies limited by shares (Schedule 1), private companies limited by shares (Schedule 2) and companies limited by guarantee (Schedule 3). A company may adopt any or all of the provisions of the Model Articles appropriate to the type of company being formed and the appropriate Model Articles will apply insofar as the articles registered by the company upon incorporation do not exclude or modify them. If a company’s registered articles do not prescribe any regulations for the company, the Model Articles appropriate to that type of company will form part of the company’s articles (section 80).\n\nThe Model Articles will be in addition to the mandatory articles that a company is required to have (Please see Q5 below).\n\nYou can view the full text of the Companies Ordinance and the subsidiary legislation at www.elegislation.gov.hk.\n\nA private company must have a company secretary and at least one director who is a natural person (i.e. an individual). The sole director of a private company must not also be the company secretary. A private company having only one director must not have a body corporate as its company secretary if the sole director of that body corporate is also the sole director of the private company.\n\nA public company or a company limited by guarantee must have a company secretary and at least two directors, one of whom may be the company secretary. It must not have a body corporate as its director.\n\nIf the company secretary is a natural person, he or she must ordinarily reside in Hong Kong. If the company secretary is a body corporate, the address of its registered or principal office should be in Hong Kong. There is no requirement under the Companies Ordinance that a director must be a Hong Kong resident."
