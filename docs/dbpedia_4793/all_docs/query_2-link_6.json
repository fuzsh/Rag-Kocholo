        "text": "It depends on your precise meaning, and the intended audience.\n\nIt could mean ending:\n\nFeature updates\n\nNon-security bug fixes\n\nSecurity fixes\n\nCustomer support / troubleshooting\n\nService, in the case of SaaS (software as a service)\n\nSometimes there will be different dates for ending each of these.\n\nFor a general-use single-word verb to mirror released, I suggest discontinued. That is, releases, support, etc. (whatever it is that you mean) are no longer continuing.\n\nBut I would prefer end of life, which though not a single word (unless you count end-of-life or EOL) is a common industry term, and usually denotes an end to updates or fixes. This is, for example, what the operating system Ubuntu uses: \"Release date\" and \"End of life date\".\n\nSome other possibilities:\n\nabandoned - implies the ending was unplanned\n\ndeactivated / defunct - accurate if the software is actually no longer functioning\n\ndecommissioned / retired - might work, though I would use this for when something actually stops being used, as when a particular company, user, or specific system is no longer using it\n\ndeprecated - describes software as replaced, or not officially recommended. This precedes its complete removal. This term is not widely used outside of software libraries (and software developers).\n\nobsolete - not great, as it describes the need or use for the software, not the state of development or support; software can become practically obsolete long before any planned support date\n\nsunsetted - a sunset is actually a period of time of limited support, so it doesn't fit a single date as you have requested. This term is frequently used, e.g. Google Reader\n\nterminated - good, though if you didn't like killed, this might also be too strong\n\nunsupported - good, though not all software is ever \"supported\" in the way some may think: regular bug fixes, support staff, etc.\n\nThe problem is that the end of software is not as distinct as it's start. On a legacy device old software might run just fine long after the developers have moved on and forgotten about it. The exact end of the software's life (or life cycle) depends largely on the attitudes of the person naming the software's demise.\n\nThe choice of word(s) reflects a great deal on the attitude of the community, the developer and the model of deployment. For example a commercial software company might talk of \"end of production\" as if it were a physical product (which if sold mainly on CD/DVD it might seem to be) whereas a company that makes more money from support talks about the \"end of life\" or \"end of support\" time frame.\n\nThus there are terms that talk about ongoing support and bugfixes, ongoing development (beyond just bugfixes) and just general appropriateness for any given task. Which is why you get a range of answers from withdrawn (no longer offered as a product) to Obsolete (something better exists, like an upgrade or a better solution).\n\nWhen the software is still available but it has reach \"End of Life\" (de facto term) where I have worked we often call it \"Retired\" which means that you can use it if you want but we accept no bug reports and you do so at your own risk. Sometimes it's \"Retired / Replaced with\" sometimes written as \"Retired/Obsolete. Upgrade to NewSoftwareTitle\". However that suggests that there is an upgrade path albeit a nonstandard one.\n\nSome firms are fond of \"End of Support\" or variants like that. In which case \"Superseded by\" is commonly given if there is something else.\n\nThe open source community sometimes lists software as \"abandoned\" which means that there is no one maintaining it anymore. Or if the developer is taking their time to put anything out - it might be described as \"inactive\" which can be effectively the same thing. This however indicates something entirely different to software that has been shelved or withdrawn which suggests more that the developers are the ones calling the shots, so to speak."
