Updated to reflect the functionalities and changes made to LabVIEW Version 8.0, this second edition delves deeply into the enhancements that continue to make LabVIEW one of the most popular and widely used graphical programming environments across the engineering community.\n\nLabVIEW’s new features are by no means trivial and neither are the updates made to the new edition of this popular bestseller. The authors introduce the changes to the front panel controls, the Standard State Machine template, new drivers, the instrument I/O assistant, new error handling functions, hyperthreading, and Express VIs. A new chapter mirrors the introduction of the Shared Variables function in LabVIEW 8.0 and a new section explores the LabVIEW project view. The chapter on ActiveX was revised to include discussion of the Microsoft™ .NET<sup>® framework and new examples of programming in LabVIEW using .NET. Numerous illustrations and step-by-step explanations provide hands-on guidance."
