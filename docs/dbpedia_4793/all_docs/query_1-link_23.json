        "text": "Before you start designing your office, you need to have a clear idea of what your company stands for and what you want to communicate to your stakeholders. Your values are the guiding principles that shape your decisions, actions, and behaviors. They should be specific, measurable, and meaningful. For example, if your company values innovation, you might want to create a space that fosters creativity, collaboration, and experimentation. If your company values sustainability, you might want to use eco-friendly materials, natural light, and green features.\n\n1) Vibe check: Open & collaborative? Playful & innovative? Sustainable? Design reflects your core values. 2) Storytelling space: Showcase achievements, mission, or employee voices through art & displays. Brand comes alive. 3) Employee focus: Ergonomic furniture, quiet areas, flexible workspaces show you prioritize well-being & productivity. 4) Brand whispers: Colors, logos subtly woven in create a cohesive, recognizable identity. 5) Employee voice matters: Include them in design, through surveys or voting. Ownership & belonging boost. By strategically using design elements, you can create a corporate office that goes beyond function and truly embodies your company's values and culture.\n\nCreating an emotional connection to your company's vision and values is a key element of enhancing your teams buy-in, support and sense of purpose at work. That takes a lot more than slapping graphics on the wall and adding some branded colors and artwork. Here are 2 top strategic tips: 1.) Engage your employees to find out if they understand the company vision and ask THEM how to enhance the office or environment to support it. 2.) Explore ways to show your support in the C-suite: saying you're a green company but then buying all laminate furniture is a mismatch...so it may be time to engage a professional to help align your vision, values, aesthetics and actions *note* a great Interior Designer can really help :)\n\nIt will change depending on your industry. I have been in the financial sector for 20 years. Typically it starts with a lease renewal and an opportunity. Once that opportunity is there then you should work with senior leadership to define the vision of the new space and determine what internal teams should be on the design team. Once there you can work with the team to lay out the vision, then document how the new space will meet this vision while showcasing the core values and elements of your organization. The new space should represent your organizations core values and use them to help design a space that can attract the talent you want in the future. After you have this then work on expanding your team with outside consultants.\n\nOnce you have defined your values, you can choose a style that matches them. Your style is the overall look and feel of your office, including the colors, textures, shapes, and furniture. Your style should reflect your company's personality, industry, and target market. For example, if your company is modern, dynamic, and tech-oriented, you might want to use a sleek, minimalist, and futuristic style. If your company is traditional, stable, and professional, you might want to use a classic, elegant, and formal style.\n\nWhen choosing a style you should first select the right design partners to help you. We all want to be designers and architects, but having the knowledge of outside experts in architecture and design come in and train your internal team on what the current trends and best practices are in office design is imperative. Remember most companies design a new space every five to ten years, and most of your team may not know what is happening in the field of design. Hold a bid to determine the architect that meets your needs and aligns with your values and team and have them show you what is out there. Once you see the new shiny stuff, then you can start working on selecting the type of space that will meet your current and future needs.\n\nYour office should be considered a key element in your employee attraction and retention plan. The investment you make there can offer a great return on Investment when seen as a real life 'business card' for your teams values, vision and persona. When searching for a new job employees place great value on workplace aesthetic, a sense of choice in their work area, and a feeling of easy collaboration around a common area (such as a great communal kitchen, a fabulous lounge area that doubles as workspace away from their desk, and updated furniture that includes ergonomics, and the latest technology at their fingertips.\n\nDepending on the goal and the strategy of the company, try putting some effort into making the office more like of what its seeking for. For example, if you need confidence from your clients, try using more white/blue colors and round shapes objects, which attracts security for whom is walking through the rooms and hallways. If you are an aggressive investing company, for example, try putting some peaked objects like arrows and spears. That will demonstrate which way you're leaning to and also will show more credibility with your clients.\n\nYour logo and colors are the most visible elements of your brand identity. They help you create a consistent and recognizable image across your office and other platforms. You can incorporate your logo and colors in various ways, such as on the walls, floors, ceilings, doors, windows, furniture, signage, stationery, and accessories. However, be careful not to overdo it or make it too cluttered. You want to create a subtle and harmonious impression, not a loud and overwhelming one.\n\nI see too many business owners splash their logo colors on the wall and call it done. Developing an internal brand for your space should be a thoughtful and clever endeavor that includes signage, artwork, customized furniture and fabrics, etc. The winning touches can be subtle yet interesting: for instance, if you say that creativity is an important element of your brand, then how do you showcase creativity within your space? I have seen really cool furniture and decor that add a lot of 'happy vibes' to a traditional workplace. Consider the daily touch points of your space like restrooms, lockers, break area and make an effort to go beyond function to add some fun and energy to these spaces.\n\nYour achievements and stories are the proof of your company's values and impact. They help you build trust, credibility, and loyalty among your stakeholders. You can showcase your achievements and stories in various ways, such as on the screens, boards, walls, shelves, or frames. You can display your awards, certificates, testimonials, reviews, case studies, projects, or milestones. You can also share your company's history, mission, vision, or purpose. Make sure to update them regularly and highlight the most relevant and recent ones.\n\nYour employees and clients are the most important people in your company. They are the ones who experience your values and culture every day. They are also the ones who can provide you with valuable feedback and insights on how to improve your office design. You can involve your employees and clients in various ways, such as by asking them for their opinions, preferences, suggestions, or complaints. You can also create a space that encourages their participation, interaction, or contribution. For example, you can have a suggestion box, a feedback wall, a brainstorming area, or a co-creation zone.\n\nAs a Commerocal Real Estate Broker and Decorator may want to consider the following- 1. Do you meet at your office and have walk clients. 2. If so, consider the age of your existing client base and of any potential new ones. Hope this helps\n\nYour office design is not a one-time project. It's an ongoing process that requires constant evaluation and improvement. You need to monitor and measure the effects of your design on your company's performance, productivity, satisfaction, and engagement. You can use various tools and methods, such as surveys, interviews, observations, or analytics. You can also compare your design with your competitors, peers, or best practices. Based on your findings, you can make changes or adjustments to your design to keep it aligned with your values and goals.\n\nI would actually urge businesses NOT to prioritize collaborative space over quiet, individual workspaces. The allocation between private and collaborative spaces should probably align with the time you expect your employees to put into strategy vs. execution. Giving your employees a quiet space to be productive signals that you respect their time both on and off the clock. To keep the workplace collaborative, require an open-door policy that facilitates the exchange of ideas but respect periodic closed doors and \"heads down\" time."
