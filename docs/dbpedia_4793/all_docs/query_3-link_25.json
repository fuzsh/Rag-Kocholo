If experience in this context simply means the proficiency you attained in the third-party API, the former employer has no legitimate claim.\n\nAre there any repercussions that could occur for me pursuing said side project?\n\nThis will mostly depend on the terms of the non-compete clause (if any) you might have signed with company A.\n\nA non-compete clause could be enforceable for a reasonable period upon termination of your employment with company A. But that does not mean that any and all contemporaneous or subsequent activities are within scope of a non-compete clause merely because they involve the use of same technology such as a third-party API."
