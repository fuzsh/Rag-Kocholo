        "text": "What Is Disruptive Innovation?\n\nDisruptive innovation refers to the innovation that transforms expensive or highly sophisticated products or services—previously accessible to a high-end or more-skilled segment of consumers—to those that are more affordable and accessible to a broader population. This transformation disrupts the market by displacing long-standing, established competitors.\n\nUnderstanding Disruptive Innovation\n\nDisruptive innovation involves technologies used to make products easier to use or access and available to a larger, non-targeted market. Note that it does not involve the process of improving or enhancing products for the same target market. An example of disruptive innovation is the introduction of digital music downloads, which have, by far, replaced compact discs.\n\nClayton Christensen popularized the idea of disruptive innovation in the book The Innovator’s Solution, which was a follow-up to The Innovators Dilemma published in 1997.\n\nChristensen posited that there are two types of technologies businesses deal with. Sustainable technologies allow a business to incrementally improve its operations in a predictable timeframe. These technologies and the way they are incorporated into a business are primarily designed to allow companies to remain competitive, or at least maintain a status quo. Disruptive technologies and the way they are integrated—the disruptive innovations—are more difficult to plan for and potentially more devastating to companies that do not pay enough attention to them.\n\nInvesting in a disruptive innovation can be complicated. It requires an investor to focus on how companies will adapt to disruptive technology instead of focusing on the development of the technology itself.\n\nThe internet has become so ingrained in the modern world that the companies that failed to integrate disruptive innovation into their business models have been pushed aside. Artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential to learn from employees and perform their jobs may be a disruptive innovation for the job market as a whole soon.\n\nThe internet was disruptive because it was not an iteration of previous technology. It was something new that created unique models for making money that never existed before. Of course, that created losses for other business models.\n\nPeople using smartphones instead of laptops and desktops for their computing needs, including web browsing and streaming, is another example of disruptive innovation. Technological enhancements have enabled cell phones to be equipped with small processors, chips, and software applications that support these functions.\n\nRequirements for Disruptive Innovation\n\nDisruptive innovation requires access to ignored or overlooked markets and technology that can transform a product into a more accessible and affordable one. To be disruptive, the network of partners—suppliers, contractors, and distributors—also must benefit from the new, disruptive business model. Certain core requirements include:\n\nEnabling Technology: In business, enabling technology is defined as the technologies and innovations that substantially change or improve processes or how people do things. Specific to disruptive innovation, enabling technology is the technology or innovation that makes possible the affordability and availability of a product to a broader market. Basically, the speed with which a market can be disrupted depends on how quickly the technology is developed and subsequently improved upon. However, the speed of the disruption is not necessarily a metric used to gauge the success of the disruption.\n\nInnovative Business Model: The innovative business model is a business model that uses innovations to target new or bottom-tier customers. These segments generally don't drive profits for established companies nor do they buy their offerings because they either could not afford them or the products were too sophisticated for use. This business model—a model not adopted by incumbents because of the disruptor's initial low-profit margins—seeks to present easy-to-use, economical solutions.\n\nCoherent Value Network: The coherent value network includes the upstream and downstream business partners that benefit from a successful disruption. The distributors, suppliers, and vendors may require process changes or reorganization to adapt or conform to the new business model. Members of the network must subscribe to the new business model to prevent failure. Otherwise, old network processes will yield undesirable results by not prescribing to the goal of disruption.\n\nDisruptive Innovation vs. Sustaining Innovation\n\nDisruptive innovation is an innovation that simplifies and makes more affordable products and services to undesirable or ignored markets. Established companies typically strive to improve their products and services for their profitable customer base, largely ignoring the needs and desires of untapped segments. This lack of attention gives smaller companies or new entrants ground to target this ignored population with simpler, more affordable options.\n\nSustaining innovation, on the other hand, is the process of innovating to make existing products and services better for the existing customer base, either based on customer or market demands. Sustaining innovation does not target untapped or ignored markets; rather, it's innovating to remain relevant and competitive. CD makers making CDs with the capacity to hold large volumes of music that are scratch-resistant is sustaining innovation. A company introducing digital downloads via the internet, making CDs obsolete, is disruptive innovation.\n\nExamples of Disruptive Innovation\n\nDisruptive innovation is differentiated from disruptive technology in that it focuses on the use of the technology rather than the technology itself. Two well-known examples of this are Amazon and Netflix.\n\nAmazon\n\nA classic example of the disruptive innovation of the internet being unleashed was the restructuring of the bookselling industry. The big bookselling chains lost out to Amazon (AMZN) because it could display its inventory without owning a physical store in every town and then ship the book to the buyer's home. Before online shopping became popular, books were sold in traditional bookstores, such as Barnes & Noble and the now-defunct Borders.\n\nAmazon's popularity grew along with its profits and market share, moving many bookstores to the back of the shelf or out of business. Since its launch, Amazon has successfully used the internet to create an online shopping platform, whereby most of what's offered in a physical store—including groceries—can be ordered from Amazon's website. And it all began with a small, garage-born company using the power of the internet to attend to the needs of a niche market of online shopping, book enthusiasts.\n\nNetflix\n\nNetflix (NFLX) is another disruptive innovator. During a time when VHS tapes and DVDs were rented in abundance from thousands of video stores, new-entrant Netflix saw an opening to cater to an overlooked market of online shoppers. Utilizing the growing power of the internet, it offered consumers the ability to peruse their catalog of DVDs, rent unencumbered by someone else's choice to rent the same selection, and have their selections sent directly to their home.\n\nNot long after offering mail-delivered DVD rentals, it revised its business model, finding an avenue to disrupt itself in the market by providing online-streamed entertainment. However, competitors have successfully duplicated this business model, taking away from Netflix's market share. Time will tell how long Netflix can remain dominant, but there is no doubt about the disruption it brought about.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDisruptive innovation involves the innovative processes used to transform products and services into simple and affordable options for bottom-tier or traditionally unmarketable consumers. Unlike sustaining innovation, it does not involve improving existing products for current customers.\n\nDisruptive innovation requires technology that can transform the product or service into something more affordable and easy-to-use, a business model that supports the disruptive innovation, and a network of upstream and downstream partners who support and will benefit from the success of the disruption. Amazon and Netflix are examples of market disruptors that began as new entrants in industries dominated by well-known, established companies."
