        "text": "According to data from the government of Alberta, the most popular baby names in the province in 2015 were Olivia and Liam.\n\nHere are Alberta’s top 10 girl names and top 10 boy names of 2015:\n\nIn the girls’ top 10, Chloe, Avery, and Amelia replaced Isabella, Charlotte, and Hannah.\n\nIn the boys’ top 10, Mason and Alexander replaced Jacob and Carter.\n\nBaby names that were bestowed only once last year include…\n\nFinally, here’s a link to Alberta’s top names of 2014.\n\nSource: Frequency and Ranking of Baby Names by Year and Gender\n\nImage: Adapted from Flag of Alberta (public domain)\n\nI can’t play a prank on you for April Fools’ Day, but I can give you a list of personal names that seem like pranks.\n\nExcept, they’re not.\n\nAll of the below are legit first & last names that belonged to real people — often multiple people. (In parentheses I’ve added rough estimates of how many instances I’ve come across so far.)\n\nAlma Mater (several)\n\nApril Showers (dozens)\n\nBear Trapp (one)\n\nCandy Cane (several)\n\nCliff Hanger (several)\n\nConstant Agony (two)\n\nConstant Craps (one)\n\nCrystal Ball (dozens)\n\nThere’s also Krystal Ball, who ran for office in Virginia a few years back.\n\nDeath Knox (one)\n\nGettysburg Battle (one)\n\nGold Mine (two)\n\nGreen Bean (several)\n\nHazel Nut/Nutt (dozens)\n\nIma Hogg (one)\n\nJed I Knight (one)\n\nLondon England (dozens)\n\nMud Brown (three)\n\nNever Fail (two) — father and son\n\nThe son’s headstone offers context for the name by referencing 1 Corinthians 13: “Love never fails.”\n\nNorman Conquest (two)\n\nNorth West (hundreds)\n\nNude Mann (one)\n\nOrbit Moon (one)\n\nOrchestra Harp (one)\n\nParis France (several)\n\nPreserved Fish (several)\n\nPullman Carr (several)\n\nOne had the middle name Palace, as in the Pullman Palace Car Company.\n\nRainy Day (one)\n\nRiver Bottom (one)\n\nRocky Mountain (dozens)\n\nSandy Beach (dozens)\n\nSea Shore (several)\n\nSeymour Butts (two) — not just a Bart Simpson prank call!\n\nShanda Lear (one)\n\nSilence Bellows (one)\n\nSoda Popp (one)\n\nStrong Beer (one)\n\nTell No Lyes (several)\n\nTen Million (one)\n\nHe had a daughter named Decillian Million.\n\nTimber Wood (one)\n\nHe has a sister named Drift Wood.\n\nTruly Wright (several)\n\nTu Morrow (one)\n\nDaughter of actors Rob Morrow and Debbon Ayer (read: debonaire)\n\nWhich one do you think is the best? Or should I say, the worst?\n\nSources:\n\nFind A Grave\n\nFamilySearch.org\n\nLipton, Mike. “All Adding Up.” People 18 Apr. 2005.\n\nImage: Falstaff (1921) by Eduard von Grützner\n\nClyde and Dorothy Popp of Missouri had a baby boy in 1952 and named him Soda.\n\nYup — Soda Popp.\n\nWhen Soda Popp was enrolled in school, it made the news:\n\nJefferson City, Mo., May 15 (AP) Soda Popp, 5, has been enrolled for kindergarten here next year.\n\nAnd he’s been in the news quite a bit since, thanks to his memorable name.\n\nIn a 2003 interview with the Kansas City Star, he had this to say about it:\n\n“I tell folks I have a sister named Lolly,” he said with a laugh. “And that I have twin sons, Snap and Crackle.”\n\nThat’s fiction, of course. But his name? That’s pure fact, he insists.\n\n“My mom wanted to give me a name that would stand out – something unusual; something folks wouldn’t forget,” he said.\n\nIt’s worked. “People say, ‘How could your parents name you that?’ But I’m glad they did. My name has opened a lot of doors for me.”\n\nA writer for the Topeka Capital-Journal spent a few days with Soda Popp in 2007. He said Soda was often forced to produce his driver’s license to prove his name really was “Soda Popp.”\n\nWhat do you think of the name “Soda Popp” — cool, or cruel?\n\nP.S. Soda Popp reminds me of two names I’ve seen on the 1940 census: R C Cola Osbey, a 21-year-old man in Texas, and Seven Up Stubin, a 22-year-old man in South Carolina.\n\nSources:\n\n“A Little Drink.” Milwaukee Sentinel 16 May 1957: 2.\n\nFrazee, Brent. “Refreshing Soda: Yes, his name is really ‘Soda Popp.'” Kansas City Star 25 May 2003: C14.\n\nMurrell, Marc. “Drinking in Soda’s tales.” Topeka Capital-Journal 13 May 2007.\n\nImage: Adapted from Coca Cola by Håkan Dahlström under CC BY 2.0.\n\nThe most popular baby names in Alberta, Canada, in 2010 were Liam and Emma:\n\nGirl Names\n\nEmma\n\nOlivia\n\nEmily\n\nIsabella\n\nSophia\n\nAva and Chloe [tie]\n\nElla\n\nAbigail\n\nAlexis\n\nLily\n\nBoy Names\n\nLiam\n\nEthan\n\nLogan\n\nAlexander\n\nLucas\n\nJacob\n\nNoah\n\nBenjamin\n\nOwen\n\nCarter\n\nService Alberta’s press release also mentioned some of the more unusual baby names of 2010. These included Soda, Canada, Universe and Duramax.*\n\n*When I saw “Duramax,” I thought of condoms. Turns out Durex is the condom brand, and Duramax is a type of engine. Regardless, the name made me think of condoms. Not a good thing.\n\nImage: Adapted from Flag of Alberta (public domain)"
