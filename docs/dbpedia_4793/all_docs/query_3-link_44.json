        "text": "There are several fields where using outdated equipment can be especially risky, and one of the top examples here is within business software and related security needs. Using old, possibly wildly outdated programs or solutions can put your business at serious risk, and software is a top consideration here in many cases.\n\nAt Elevated Networks, cybersecurity and related forms of protection are just some of the numerous IT and telecom solutions we offer to businesses around Salt Lake City, St. George and other parts of Utah. Here are some of the major risks of using old, outdated software programs for your business, particularly within the realm of security and related factors.\n\nCracking the Door Open for Cybercriminals\n\nOne of the single largest and most notable risks of using outdated software programs is that it can be an easy way for cybercriminals to gain access to your business. Older software packages often have known flaws and vulnerabilities which have been patched out in newer versions, but if you are stuck with an old program, these flaws might still exist and can put your business at serious risk.\n\nFor instance, if you are using an old security program, it might be missing certain key updates or patches that were released to the public. Cybercriminals often look for these kinds of outdated programs in order to gain access to a business’ systems and data with ease, making updated software one of your best lines of defense against potential cyber threats.\n\nData and Info Loss\n\nAnother major risk of using outdated software is the potential for data and information loss. In this modern era, businesses need to be able to store their customer records, financials, employee data, and more within secure systems that are reliable, efficient, and up-to-date.\n\nOld programs might not be as capable or as secure as more modern solutions, and this could end up causing major issues if such data was ever compromised due to a security flaw or an outdated program failing.\n\nUsing the latest programs and software packages is just one of the many ways your business can stay safe and secure in today’s world, and at Elevated Networks we have all the latest tools.\n\nProductivity Losses\n\nOften due to problems with security and data, using outdated software can also cause productivity losses as well. If an older program crashes or is unable to perform basic tasks due to its age or lack of compatibility with other programs, this can lead to major slowdowns and reduce the overall efficiency of your business’ operations.\n\nHaving modern systems in place that are up-to-date and running smoothly is essential for any business, and this is just one more reason why it’s important to keep your software current.\n\nLack of Compatibility With Modern Systems\n\nAnother major issue with using outdated software is that it can often not be compatible with modern systems. This can create a host of problems, such as not being able to access certain features or functions and having issues when trying to integrate newer software packages or cloud solutions within your network.\n\nLet’s say, for example, that you’re working with an old CRM system that is incompatible with modern customer databases, or a financial program that cannot handle the new tax codes. These are just some of the issues you might run into when using outdated software, and this can hamper your business’ operations, leading to slower growth and reduced profits in the long run.\n\nPossible Crashes in the Operating System\n\nIn certain cases, the use of outdated software can also lead to crashes or instability in the operating system for your business. This is particularly true if you’re using multiple software packages from different vendors and all have their own set of requirements and dependencies which must be fulfilled.\n\nUsing programs that are out-of-date could cause significant disruptions within your network, and this could lead to major losses in productivity, security flaws, data loss, and more.\n\nTo avoid these kinds of issues, it’s important to keep your software up-to-date at all times with the latest versions available from trusted vendors. Doing so will help ensure that your business remains secure and up-and-running optimally at all times."
