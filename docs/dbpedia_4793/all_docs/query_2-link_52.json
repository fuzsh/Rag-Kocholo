        "text": "A software bill of materials, abbreviated as SBOM, is defined as a machine-readable file containing an inventory of all the software components used in an application (open-source, proprietary, or licensed) that is regularly updated with authorship, vulnerability, dependency, and other information as the application evolves over time.\n\nAll commercial applications must contain an SBOM to help track the components within it. It also makes finding remedies to app component issues easier since you have more visibility into their origins.\n\nThis article explains the standards used to create SBOM files and their components. It also describes the tools you can use for SBOM generation and its benefits and challenges.\n\nWhat Is a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)?\n\nA software bill of materials (SBOM) is a machine-readable file containing an inventory of all the software components used in an application (open-source, proprietary, or licensed), regularly updated with authorship, vulnerability, dependency, and other information as the application evolves over time.\n\nThe notion of an SBOM stems from the manufacturing industry, in which a bill of materials (BOM) is a catalog listing all the different parts of a product.\n\nManufacturers in the automotive industry, for example, keep an exhaustive bill of materials for every vehicle and its components. When a defective component is discovered, the automaker understands exactly which automobiles have been impacted and can alert vehicle owners that they’ll require repair or replacement.\n\nIntelligent organizations that use, create, or resell software also keep a reliable, most recent software bill of materials, which incorporates a listing of third-party and open-source elements to ensure their code’s quality, conformity, and integrity.\n\nThe process of creating an SBOM can be:\n\nManual: In an Excel spreadsheet or comparable file, developers can manually enumerate all software parts, including each component’s version, licensing, interdependence, and other important details. This strategy may be appropriate for minor undertakings with only a few elements.\n\nAutomated: You can integrate automated tools into the continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflow to examine software projects and replace their associated components as required.\n\nSoftware bills of materials are stored in machine-readable files in the formats of xls, .spdx, .rdf, .json, .yml, and .xml.\n\nImportance of SBOM\n\nAs organizations increasingly rely on software to run mission-critical processes, an SBOM is an indispensable asset. It allows businesses to identify and monitor all external components and conform to licensing standards. Moreover, it ensures the business refrains from using vulnerable parts and keeps track of key updates and upgrades.\n\nWhen software weaknesses are discovered, the SBOM simplifies root-cause analysis and prevents the risk from spreading into other dependencies. These documents are essential for the due diligence exercise connected to any possible merger or acquisition, inaugural public offering, or funding round. Finally, SBOMs are necessary for compliance audits, data privacy, and other legal reasons.\n\nSee More: How Container Vulnerabilities Can Put Software Supply Chain at Risk\n\nSBOM Standards\n\nEmploying an industry-standard format for SBOM data exchange is crucial for developers and end-user companies needing or wanting supply chain risk visibility. Whether the organization creates an SBOM throughout development with an SCA tool or otherwise, the SBOM records must be portable and easy to comprehend.\n\nThe four most widely used SBOM standards, accepted by government agencies, software vendors, and enterprises alike, are:\n\n1. Software package data exchange (SPDX)\n\nThe Linux Foundation created the software package data exchange (SPDX) in 2010 as the principal open standard for Software Bill of Materials layouts. SPDX files contain software parts, trademarks, licenses, and security recommendations.\n\nThe SPDX specification is consistent with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration’s (NTIA) SBOM minimum requirements and use cases. Since SPDX Lite is a simplified version of the SPDX standard, businesses can use it to exchange data. In August 2021, the SPDX was formalized as an officially recognized standard as ISO/IEC 5962.\n\n2. CycloneDX by the OWASP\n\nCycloneDX is a thorough SBOM format that originates within app security but possesses various use cases. It was created by the Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) in 2017 to help with component analysis in the software development process. The CycloneDX SBOM standard features six components:\n\nMetadata: Information on the application/product itself\n\nComponents: A complete inventory of proprietary and open source components\n\nServices: External application programming interfaces (APIs) and other services\n\nVulnerabilities: Several types of vulnerability data, including severity score\n\nDependencies: Both direct and transitive relationships\n\n‍Compositions: The completeness of any description of BOM elements\n\n3. Software identification or SWID\n\n“Software identification,” or SWID for short, was proposed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2009 and then revised in 2015. The SWID standard outlines a lifecycle wherein a SWID identifier is assigned to an endpoint at the time of the installation process of a software product and withdrawn during the uninstallation process.\n\nSWID identifiers are intended to facilitate the development of detailed software inventories by facilitating software discovery, identification, and contextualization throughout its lifecycle. The standard is a component of the larger International Organization for Standardization (ISO) guidelines on IT asset management and is endorsed by NIST.\n\n4. SPDX lite\n\nSPDX Lite is a compact variant of the SPDX for deployment when the complete SPDX is unnecessary. It is meant to be user-friendly for individuals without open-source licensing experience or expertise. This standard was developed primarily by members of the OpenChain Japan working group, including Hitachi, Fujitsu, Sony, and Renesas, along with Toshiba.\n\nSPDX Lite SBOMs are interoperable with other SPDX files and can share license information since they have to include document origination and package information records.\n\nSee More: How to Protect Enterprises Against the Growing Menace of Supply Chain Attacks\n\nComponents of SBOM\n\nThe National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the United States has published a standard outlining the minimum requirements for an SBOM. As per NTIA specifications, an SBOM must contain:\n\nAuthor: Typically, this is the organization that created the software.\n\nVendor: This is the software vendor’s identity, including any aliases (alternative identities). The vendor and author can be different if a reseller creates an SBOM.\n\nComponent: The software component’s name and any possible aliases.\n\nVersion: The structure of the version data is arbitrary, but it should adhere to industry standards.\n\nComponent hash: A cryptographic hash that works as a unique identifier is the most effective way to identify a software component inside a program. The cipher shows up in the SBOM.\n\nIdentifier: Every component has to have a unique ID number that distinguishes it within the SBOM alongside the hash.\n\nRelationship: It describes the component’s relationship to the bundle. In most instances, the relationship is “included,” suggesting that a specific element is included in a specific product.\n\nThe above SBOM elements are mentioned for every software component under discussion, including open-source code. Therefore, the software bill of materials will also have:\n\n1. Names of open-source components\n\nWhile open source is neither more nor less unsafe than patented code, the inability to properly protect it presents a greater threat to the general safety of your organization. Only a few organizations can put together a precise and up-to-date software bill of materials comprising open-source components. An exhaustive SBOM specifies the licenses, versioning details, and modification status of all open-source elements in the applications you create.\n\n2. Licenses of software components\n\nA failure to adhere to open-source licensing regulations creates a major threat of litigation and intellectual property (IP) infringement for businesses. Over 50% of the codebases audited for the 2023 Open Source Security and Risk Analysis (OSSRA) report had open-source software license disputes, most often involving the GNU General Public License. Conflicts like these can substantially impact acquisitions and mergers, vendor disagreements, and distribution challenges.\n\nA software bill of materials establishes the licenses governing the components one uses, allowing the isolation and assessment of legal and intellectual property liabilities.\n\n3. Version details\n\nKnowing if your codebase’s open-source aspects are adequately managed and maintained is important. When teams use defunct components, parts without recent coding activity, or elements from projects lacking a large enough developer community to take care of the code, operational hazards come into play.\n\nIn addition to code quality, dependability, and maintainability issues, operational risk can lead to security hazards. If no developer recognizes and fixes problems or notices, reveals, and addresses security flaws, the system becomes easy prey for threat actors.\n\nAn SBOM offers a list of the component versions in the code you write, and this can be used to determine if you are using obsolete, possibly insecure code.\n\n4. Software identification tagging\n\nBefore the decade’s end, the ISO started developing an internationally recognized norm for designating software parts with machine-readable IDs. SWID tags, as known today, are structured metadata embedded in applications that transfer details like the software product’s title, version, builders, and more.\n\nThe SBOM uses four principal categories of SWID tags:\n\nCorpus: These are used to determine and classify software components that aren’t yet ready for installation. Corpus IDs are intended to be parameters for software installation procedures and tools instead of being installed directly.\n\nPrimary: The primary purpose of a tag is to determine and contextualize installed software products.\n\nPatch: Instead of recognizing and summarizing the primary product, patch identifiers define and describe the repair. Patch identifiers can also include contextual data about the patch’s association with other parts or patches and do so every so often.\n\nSupplemental: These supplementary identifiers let software consumers or management tools add valuable local usage contextual data. This might contain licensing keys and relevant stakeholder contact information.\n\nSee More: Why Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Is Critical To Mitigating Software Supply Chain Risks\n\nSBOM Best Practices\n\nThe value you obtain from SBOMs increases measurably when certain best practices are followed. Hence, it is advisable to:\n\nSBOM Best Practices\n\n1. Make sure the SBOM file is regularly updated\n\nAs application components evolve, the vendor must preserve and refresh the SBOM they have generated. This includes revisions to the code, error corrections, enhanced functionality, and other alterations. These changes may occur at any time across various teams and must be managed in real-time; if not, the SBOM will soon become obsolete.\n\n2. Manage SBOM versions efficiently\n\nSBOMs must be tracked as the same version of the software may include multiple SBOM files. For instance, you can publish an updated version of the SBOM to resolve an error or expose new vulnerabilities previously undiscovered at the time of the original release. The latest edition of the SBOM should be readily discernible and include accurate and complete data.\n\n3. Do not ignore the metadata\n\nWhile metadata isn’t directly related to security, it is one of the most essential components of an SBOM. You require extensive metadata for every component, like the component’s title, versions, licensing details, seller or creator, outline, dependencies, identified vulnerabilities, and fix or update records. Including comprehensive metadata improves software supply chain accountability, safety, and compliance oversight.\n\n4. Extend SBOMs to software that does not require installation\n\nCreating and maintaining SBOMs for software as a service (SaaS) products is equally essential. Customers of SaaS must have access to SBOMs to evaluate potential hazards, guarantee compliance, and arrive at educated decisions on service providers. SaaS vendors should adhere to the same set of best practices that apply to conventional software vendors, even if that requires an additional step in agile delivery.\n\n5. Capitalize on automation opportunities\n\nAutomatically creating SBOMs as a component of the software delivery pipeline presents two significant advantages. First, it eliminates the need for developers to manually assemble every SBOM. Secondly, SBOMs created automatically by CI/CD can be cryptographically authenticated and validated. It lets you show your clients that all the parts listed in the SBOM are actually included in the delivered software.\n\nSee More: Top 10 CI/CD Tools in 2022\n\nTop 6 SBOM Tools\n\nSBOM tools are software solutions that manage, maintain, and track software components as you progress on the development lifecycle. These tools help ensure security and compliance by creating a detailed software inventory. Some of the top SBOM tools used by software vendors include:\n\n1. Anchore\n\nThe foundation of Anchore is made up of two open-source initiatives. The first is Syft, a library and command line interface (CLI) utility. The other is Grype, a vulnerability detection app that is simple to integrate. Anchore employs these to help you create SBOMs at every phase of the development process, including source-code archives, CI/CD pipelines, containerized databases, and runtimes.\n\n2. FOSSA\n\nFOSSA’s SBOM solution detects and catalogs an application’s components autonomously and then produces an in-depth bill of materials. Furthermore, it offers continuous monitoring, informing developers of any changes made to the codebase-aware elements. It can identify an app’s dependencies, even if they are concealed or hard to recognize.\n\n3. Scribe Security\n\nScribe integrates with your software pipelines to create SBOMs and instantly establish proof of the integrity and lineage of code elements and artifacts. It verifies software components using cryptography and creates electronically signed SBOMs. These details may be communicated to the security and development teams and other external parties.\n\n4. SPDX SBOM Generator\n\nSPDX SBOM Generator is an independent open-source tool that does precisely what its name suggests. It develops SPDX SBOMs from existing package managers and builds systems. You may create SBOM data from your program’s code using its CLI. It gives you a report on your code’s components, licenses, trademarks, and security aspects. All of this data is exported according to SPDX v2.2 specifications.\n\n5. Tern\n\nTern is a Python library and software structure analytic tool that builds an SBOM for container images and Dockerfiles. Tern allows you to identify and monitor the open-source elements used in your IT systems and applications. It helps you understand the safety and licensing risks linked to these components.\n\n6. Vigilant Ops\n\nWith its InSight Platform, the cybersecurity company Vigilant Ops has shifted its focus to SBOM. Its SaaS software creates, maintains, and facilitates authorized SBOM sharing. It provides security through ongoing vulnerability detection and reporting. This SBOM tool employs patented algorithms to guarantee that all elements have been verified and vulnerabilities are interlinked and inspected.\n\nSee More: OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities in 2022\n\nBenefits and Challenges of SBOM\n\nBy now, it’s clear that the main reason to create software bills of materials is security and compliance. However, SBOMs are not without their challenges. Let us first explore the benefits in more detail:\n\nBenefits of SBOM\n\nSoftware bills of materials help in:\n\nCurbing supply chain risk: The SBOM documents all the components and associated risks in the supply chain, from code origin to usage, so you can quickly find the root cause of the issues.\n\nReducing costs: A business will avoid paying for unnecessary licenses if it’s mindful of the installed and deployed software.\n\nAddressing shadow IT: Limiting and regulating the software presence of a business will decrease its possible attack surface.\n\nPrioritizing security measures: Inventory precision — discovering critical software assets — facilitates targeted security measures.\n\nPlanning for upgrades: Knowledge of the enterprise’s trade and proprietary software utilization will help in IT investment accounting.\n\nDriving compliance: With an exhaustive list of all internal components, businesses can confidently keep up with different privacy laws.\n\nSimplifying audits: SBOMs facilitate in-house software auditing to ensure the reliability and security of applications.\n\nSupporting collaboration: Different teams, like development, security, or legal, may work together more efficiently with SBOMs.\n\nChallenges of SBOM\n\nNow, let’s turn to some of the concerns that need to be kept in mind when using an SBOM.\n\nSlowing down development: Organizations must routinely integrate SBOM production into their current processes. This can impede the development workflow.\n\nExposing sensitive data: Discussing SBOMs with other stakeholders could raise concerns about disclosing confidential or proprietary information within an organization.\n\nBeing ineffective due to low adoption: All stakeholders in the software supply chain have to execute and distribute SBOMs for their genuine efficacy.\n\nOverly broadbasing security efforts: Security vulnerabilities must be found, but not all flaws are susceptible to attack; therefore, vulnerability management must be strategic.\n\nSee More: What Is Vulnerability Management? Definition, Lifecycle, Policy, and Best Practices\n\nExample of SBOM\n\nBills of materials for software tend to be confidential and only disclosed upon submission to authorized stakeholders. SBOMs include information about an application’s design, layout, and use, which must be safeguarded from competitors. Notably, raw SBOM files can span hundreds of pages; therefore, here’s a look at the very first few lines of a sample SBOM file:\n\n{\n\n“$schema”: “http://cyclonedx.org/schema/bom-1.2b.schema.json”,\n\n“bomFormat”: “CycloneDX”,\n\n“specVersion”: “1.2”,\n\n“version”: 1,\n\n“metadata”: {\n\n“tools”: [\n\n{\n\n“vendor”: “@cyclonedx”,\n\n“name”: “cyclonedx-library”,\n\n“version”: “1.13.3”\n\n},\n\n{\n\n“vendor”: “@cyclonedx”,\n\n“name”: “cyclonedx-npm”,\n\n“version”: “1.9.2”\n\n}\n\n]\n\nYou can find the complete version of this SBOM sample hereOpens a new window . GitHub also hosts several other examples of software bills of materials in different formats to help developers and software teams get started.\n\nSee More: Top 10 Vulnerability Management Tools for 2021\n\nTakeaway\n\nCompanies with multi-faceted application landscapes need to keep track of exactly which components make up their IT infrastructure. Without this visibility, security vulnerabilities will go unnoticed, and it will be difficult to remediate issues about different app components. Ultimately, an SBOM is an essential tool in long and complex software supply chains where multiple authors contribute to the final software product and, thereby, your business success.\n\nDid this article fully explain the meaning of software bills of materials and their uses?
