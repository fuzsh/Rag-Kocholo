Netgear has launched its S3600 Series Smart Switches this week, switches built with small and large businesses in mind with eight or 16 ports, with each port offering up to 10 Gb/s connections.\n\nThe XS508TM is the eight-port switch while the XS516TM offers 16 ports, and while all of the ports offer up to 10 Gb/s connections, they both also have a pair of SFP+ fiber uplink ports. While each traditional port is capable of providing 10 Gb/s, you can also configure them to provide slower speeds, 1 Gb/s, 2.5 Gb/s, and 5 Gb/s, if that is all the device needs. The line rate fabrics for the two are 200 Gb/s for the XS508TM and 360 Gbps for the XS516TM, so there should be plenty of speed moving data between devices. The switches also provide L2 and L2+ features such as VLANs, Rapid Spanning Tree, and IGMP Snooping/Querier/Fast Leave to make integrating either into your network layers easy. Additionally you have auto DoS protection to prevent such attacks against your business or a faulty device disrupting connectivity, and the capability for remote monitoring, if needed. Naturally these Netgear switches can be managed through the Netgear Insight cloud platform, like the company's Pro Routers, Pro WiFi Access Ports, and Smart Cloud Managed Switches, making it easy to manage all aspects of your network from a single place.\n\nThe XS508TM with its eight ports is priced at $999.99 while the XS516TM is priced at $1599.99 for its 16 ports. Both come with a one-year subscription for Netgear Cloud Management and are backed by a limited lifetime warranty and 24/7 technical support.\n\nSource: Netgear (S3600 Series)\n\nTerraMaster Release 10 GbE NAS for 4K Online Video Editing\n\nCategory: Networking\n\nPosted: March 13, 2023 05:45PM\n\nAuthor: Guest_Jim_*\n\nTerraMaster has released a couple new devices targeting content creation professionals, though I can imagine many would enjoy having a NAS with dual SFP+ 10 Gb Ethernet connections. The T9-450 and T12-450 have been designed with professionals who need to work with video files that can measure in the dozens or even hundreds of GBs, being original recordings in 4K or 8K resolutions. Not everyone's personal computers or workstations can comfortably hold such large files and be able to protect that data, and then it might be necessary to share it across a team. With the dual 10 GbE connections, these NAS solutions can allow that team to work with files on these storage devices in applications such as Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, and Final Cut Pro. Link Aggregation allows you to achieve a 20 Gb connection with the SFP+ ports, but there is also a pair of more conventional RJ45 2.5 GbE ports on board.\n\nOther specifications include the use of an Intel Atom C3558R quad-core CPU paired with 8 GB of DDR4, though you can go up to 32 GB if desired. The T9-450 has nine drive bays that can each take up to 20 TB HDDs while the T12-450 has three additional slots in case that 180 TB limit is restrictive. There is also a pair of m.2 slots for NVMe SSDs that can serve as cache for accelerating some actions and transfers. Looking within the devices, the Btrfs file system is being used, allowing for its data protection features as well as its quick snapshotting and recovery. These NASes also run the latest version of TerraMaster's operating system, TOS 5 that adds new features and improvements for better speed, protection, and reliability. The TRAID disk array management tool also makes managing drives easier as it has functions for automatic disk space combination, hard disk failure redundancy protection, and automatic capacity expansion. Being automatic, the user does not need to manually configure them, which can be a definite boon for some.\n\nThe T9-450 is priced at $1199.99 while its bigger brother, the T12-450 is priced at $1599.99. Both prices are diskless, so you will need to populate the bays yourself.\n\nSource: TerraMaster [1] (T9-450 and T12-450 NAS Announcement), [2] (T9-450), and [3] (T12-450)\n\nWi-Fi Naming Changing for Easier Differentiation\n\nCategory: Networking\n\nPosted: October 4, 2018 08:00AM\n\nAuthor: Guest_Jim_*\n\nWhen choosing wireless networking equipment, for years we have been reading a, b, g, n, or ac and while those familiar with the equipment grasp what this means, it is still an odd naming scheme. Well, the Wi-Fi Alliance has decided to change it, so now the upcoming 802.11ax technology will be known as Wi-Fi 6, while 802.11ac can be identified as Wi-Fi 5, 802.11n as Wi-Fi 4, and so on. This generational naming scheme should make it easier for people to recognize how the technologies relate to each other, and we will see Wi-Fi 6 certification coming in 2019.\n\nSource: Wi-Fi Alliance\n\nWi-Fi Alliance Announces WP3\n\nCategory: Networking\n\nPosted: January 11, 2018 09:41AM\n\nAuthor: Guest_Jim_*\n\nA great deal of the information we consume and produce every day goes over wireless networks, especially Wi-Fi, which makes securing these transmissions of constant importance. To that end, the Wi-Fi Alliance has announced some of the new capabilities that will emerge this year as part of WPA3.\n\nWhile WPA2 has been widely successful, is still being developed, and will continue to be deployed in future devices, WPA3 is going to bring new protections and features. Among these are means to ensure security for simple passwords and making it easier for devices with small or no display interface to connect. Individualized encryption is another feature that will strengthen privacy even on open networks and we will also see a 192-bit security suite created to protect networks with high security requirements.\n\nSource: Wi-Fi Alliance\n\nUK WiFi Provider Keeps Sewers Clean By Tricking Customers\n\nCategory: Networking\n\nPosted: July 18, 2017 10:25AM\n\nAuthor: scr4wl\n\nCustomers in the United Kingdom unknowingly agreed to perform one thousand hours of community service in exchange for using a public WiFi hotspot. The WiFi provider, Purple, decided to sneak the clause into its terms and conditions, knowing that most people would never read it. In what has been described as a, \"technically legally binding agreement,\" users agreed to unclog sewers and scrape gum off the streets. The list of duties also included cleaning up animal litter, cleaning portable bathrooms, painting snail shells to brighten their existence, and hugging stray cats and dogs.\n\nPurple reportedly performed the hoax in order to show that users may be agreeing to things they would not like in those pesky terms and conditions. Examples could be granting access to private information, or providing data of your web browsing habits. In addition to the hoax, the WiFi provider also included a clause stating that you would be given a prize if you actually read the terms and conditions. It appears as though only one person actually claimed this prize.\n\nSource: UPI\n\n10 Gigabit Fiber and Switch Solutions Launched by TRENDnet\n\nCategory: Networking\n\nPosted: November 12, 2015 06:34PM\n\nAuthor: Brentt Moore\n\nTRENDnet, a best-in-class wired and wireless networking hardware brand, has officially launched its own line of 10 Gigabit fiber and switch solutions, which support all types of business network applications.

This is possible due to a new 8x8 MIMO chipset that the company is working on, which will work with older Wi-Fi standards such as 802.11 a/b/g and n. Some of the newest routers that are currently on the market feature 3x3 MIMO chipsets, such as the Linksys WRT-1900AC that delivers 1.3Gbps, while newer 802.11ac routers that have been announced feature a 4x4 MIMO chipset, such as the ASUS RT-AC87U that delivers 1.7Gbps. The new chipset by Quantenna will bond multiple channels found on the 5GHz frequency band to provide a single channel that is 160MHz wide; current 802.11ac routers are able to achieve an 80MHz wide channel by using the same technology.\n\nQuantenna has revealed alongside of this announcement that it does not plan to introduce any 8x8 MIMO chipsets into battery powered devices or USB Wi-Fi adapters. The company plans on the chipset being used in enterprise environments and consumer networking.\n\nSource: PCWorld\n\nWi-Fi Spectrum Coalition Formed\n\nCategory: Networking\n\nPosted: February 14, 2014 04:40PM\n\nAuthor: Brentt Moore\n\nA new coalition has been formed that is geared towards improving Wi-Fi, for both businesses and consumers. Known as WifiForward, the group seeks to alleviate the issues that face Wi-Fi in terms of the spectrums it currently uses. Wi-Fi generally suffers from a bottleneck due to spectrum frequencies that are overused. The group plans to gain support from the United State government in order to establish unlicensed rules that encourage development, strengthen current unlicensed spectrums, and make new spectrum available for unlicensed use at a variety of frequencies.\n\nMembers of WifiForward include ALA, Arris, Best Buy, Broadcom, CCIA, CEA, Charter, Comcast, CompTIA, EngineAdvocacy, Fastback Networks, Google, IAVM, Microsoft, Motorola, NCTA, SHLB, and Time Warner Cable.\n\nSource: CNET\n\nCisco Vows to Fix Backdoor\n\nCategory: Networking\n\nPosted: January 13, 2014 09:14AM\n\nAuthor: Brentt Moore\n\nDiscovered by a security researcher named Eloi Vanderbeken, some Cisco routers currently contain a backdoor system that is able to be exploited by attackers. Cisco is promising to release a firmware patch shortly that will remedy the issue, even though Belkin is now responsible for Linksys routers. The vulnerability allows attackers to gain administrative access without any form of authenticating, by simply resetting the administrative password. The devices that contain the issue contain a service that listens on port 32764 TCP. Cisco identified its RVS4000, WRVS4400N, and WAP4410N router models that contain the vulnerability. While the first two are only able to be compromised by using a testing interface on the LAN that the devices are connected to, the WAP4410N can be exploited wirelessly as well.\n\nCisco has notified users that besides the firmware patch that it plans to release shortly, there is no known workaround for the vulnerability.\n\nSource: PCWorld\n\nNew Wireless AC USB Adapter Announced by TRENDnet\n\nCategory: Networking\n\nPosted: January 7, 2014 08:34AM\n\nAuthor: Brentt Moore\n\nOne of the leaders in wired and wireless networking hardware, TRENDnet has announced from CES in Las Vegas, Nevada, the introduction of their new high gain Wireless AC USB adapter.

It is a new desktop/rack mountable 8-port gigabit switch with all eight ports supporting the PoE+ standard. The new switch makes it easier to expand a wired network, since it delivers both power and data via a single ethernet cable. So whether you need to share your small business' files with all the computers in the building, hooking up all your surveillanve cameras to your home server or you want to set up a quick and easy LAN, when your friends come over for a gaming session, then the TL-SG1008PE might be something for you. The switch's power limit is 124 W, and if the devices connected to the switch exceeds the power limit, the switch will automatically cut off power to the lowest priority port until the power usage is unde the limit again. Furthermore, the switch is said to be very energy effecient with power savings up to 75 percent, though it is not known what that number is based on.\n\nThe TL-SG1008PE has an MSRP of $199.99 and is available at retail and online stores.\n\nSource: Press Release\n\nLED Lights Could be Used to Transfer Data\n\nCategory: Networking\n\nPosted: April 12, 2013 08:58AM\n\nAuthor: EuroFight\n\nResearchers at the Fraunhofer Institute have developed a way to transfer data using rapidly blinking LED lights. The data allows information to be transmitted at speeds of up to 1GBPS, with the possibility of speeds of up to 3GBPS through use of three different colors. The technology could soon be integrated into conference rooms, trade booths and hospitals, but has many more possible applications. Additionally, the technology can easily be built into conventional lighting with relatively little modification.\n\nThe technology is not without flaws, however. Use of LEDs for extended periods of time on battery-powered devices can significantly reduce battery life, and bright light can also disrupt the transfer of data. As well as this, the technology has a very limited range. In ideal conditions, data transfer rate can drop to 100MBPS at 20m, and is affected by any objects in between the transmitter and receiver.\n\nSource: CNET\n\n4G LTE Connectivity to be Available on Flights by End of 2013\n\nCategory: Networking\n\nPosted: March 26, 2013 09:55AM\n\nAuthor: EuroFight\n\nAccording to telecommunications company ZTE, 4G LTE data connections will be available for use on flights from later this year. ZTE conducted a test on a Hainan Airlines Flight which showed that 4G connectivity was available for a large portion of the two hour flight, with download speeds of more than 12 Mbps. The technology uses a 4G LTE data connection between the aircraft and the ground, which can then be used by passengers over a Wi-Fi connection.\n\nZTE expects to apply this technology to all Chinese airlines by the end of this year, and will continue to expand after this. ZTE, however, is not alone in developing this technology, with Airbus, Alcatel and a number of other companies also working on developing these high-speed data connections. The technology is likely to be adopted fairly quickly, especially considering 4G connectivity is now available in more than 67 countries, according to the Global Mobile Supplies Association, so we may begin to see in-flight high-speed internet connections become a reality in the near future.\n\nUsing Empty TV Channels to Create Super WiFi\n\nCategory: Networking, Science & Technology\n\nPosted: April 28, 2011 05:21PM\n\nAuthor: Charles Coggins III\n\nRyan Guerra, a grad student at Rice University, has been trying to figure out how to extend the range of a WiFi signal to over a mile. Thanks to empty TV channels and some fancy engineering, Ryan has successfully extended the range of a WiFi signal belonging to a resident of Houston. This resident lives just on the outskirts of a free WiFi network, and since traditional WiFi signals use the 2.4GHz and 5GHz frequencies the signal will not easily pass through the trees surrounding the resident's home. Ryan has figured out how to take the traditional WiFi signal and convert it into an empty TV channel. He calls this project \"Super WiFi\". Ryan starts off by using a typical 2.4Ghz WiFi card running on a Linux system and has the card's output sent through a frequency translator. The translator then shifts the 2.4GHz signal down to 563MHz which is sent to a small TV antenna on the resident's home. The signal is transmitted and eventually patched into the free WiFi connection using a local transmission tower. The reason behind the use of the empty TV channel is it uses a 563MHz signal, and that signal can easily be sent though the trees and walls surrounding the neighborhood.\n\nThe transmitter Ryan has created transmits in a 60 degree directional beam allowing anyone in its path to receive the WiFi signal. Since the transmitter is directional it also allows for a smaller more discreet TV antenna to be used on the resident's home. While the results so far have been excellent, Ryan does foresee problems in the future with existing WiFi protocols and his Super WiFi project. Fear not though, Ryan and companies like Microsoft are researching new protocols for empty TV channel use.\n\nNew Zealand Kicks Anti-Piracy Corrective Action Up a Notch\n\nCategory: Networking, Copyright Infringers, General News\n\nPosted: April 14, 2011 02:29AM\n\nAuthor: IVIYTH0S\n\nIn an effort to decrease piracy within its borders, New Zealand has recently been pushing for heftier penalties on individuals caught doing any related acts of piracy. More specifically, the New Zealand government is cracking down on those sharing any electronic data that is a blatant infringement of any copyrights. The first infraction comes in the form of a written warning administered by the alleged pirate's Internet provider. The government has been granted clearance to rule on administering fines as high as $15,000 NZD (or roughly $11,133USD). Users who do not cease and desist their file sharing will have their internet service terminated for half of a year. Not all the government officials were ready to empower the government to disable the internet for any period of time. A couple of the officials had not even been made aware of the bill until after it was well along its way to becoming law. Lawyer Rick Shera makes the argument that copyright owners are given far too much power with the new bill. Rick believes that the copyright owners should not be able to prosecute any individuals based solely on the assumption they are carrying out piracy-like acts, and that all guilty rulings should be backed up by hard evidence.\n\nICY BOX Releases IB-NAS6220 Dual-bay NAS Server\n\nCategory: Networking, Storage / Hard Drives\n\nPosted: January 12, 2011 10:54PM\n\nAuthor: Daryn Govender\n\nICY BOX has released a new NAS server, the IB-NAS6220.

Either way you look at it, a man in Minnesota is facing up to 40 years in prison after pleading guilty to hacking his neighbor's wireless connection, identity theft, possession of child pornography along with issuing death threats against Vice President Joe Biden among others.\n\nBarry Vincent Ardolf used the Aircrack software to crack into his neighbor's Wi-Fi that was secured using WEP encryption standard. Ardolf then set up accounts on Yahoo and MySpace to begin a campaign to embarrass his neighbor and cause him other troubles by e-mailing child pornography to the neighbor's co-workers at the law firm where he worked. Ardolf also used the fake MySpace account to post additional pornographic images. Fortunately for the victim, the law firm hired a security consultant who installed a packet sniffer which detected Ardolf logging into the Wi-Fi connection.\n\nBoth the older Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) and its replacement, Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) have known vulnerabilities which is why users should upgrade to the newer WPA-2 encryption.\n\n3.17% of All SSL are Being Used.\n\nCategory: Networking\n\nPosted: June 28, 2010 08:13PM\n\nAuthor: Dariuas\n\nSSL or Secure Socket Layer have been used for a variety of different services such as Linux boxes, FTP servers, even webmail and banking sites. According to research from Qualys, a security research firm, out of 119 million domain names scanned, 92 million were actually active, 12.4 million of the remaining domains failed to resolve properly, and the other 14.6 million gave no response at all. Out of the 92 million active domains, Qualys shows that 34 million domains use both port 80 (typical HTTP port) and port 443 (typical HTTPS/SSL port).\n\nWhile those numbers do not seem to strike any significant problem, it seems only 23 million actually use SSL. The cause for concern comes about when discussing SSL certificates. The bigger picture shows that only 3.17% of the 23 million servers have valid certificates. This problem comes from domains generating certificates with the the incorrect domain name. According to Ian Ristic, director of engineering at Qualys:\n\n\"We have about 22 million SSL servers with certificates that are completely invalid because they do not match the domain name on which they reside.\"\n\nEssentially what this all boils down to is many sites that have SSL built in to their infrastructure are not gaining the benefits of the security it adds due to the invalid or improper domain name.\n\nNew Belkin Routers are Plug and Play\n\nCategory: Networking\n\nPosted: March 24, 2010 01:21PM\n\nAuthor: bp9801\n\nFor most people, setting up a wireless router is a bit of a hassle to make sure everything works and can get online. But now, Belkin is intent on changing that with a new series of wireless routers that are as simple as they come. Belkin has finally ditched the alphanumeric names of its past routers and is releasing four new ones with the names of Surf, Share, Play and Play Max. Each one comes with SSID and encryption pre-configured, so all the user has to do is plug it in and you will be online in no time at all. If you want to change the network name, just load up the included software to do so. All the routers are 802.11n and all of them, minus the basic Surf one, come with preloaded apps. The Share model comes with a USB port that you can plug an external hard drive or printer into as well as using Belkin's own backup and printing software. The Play Max model comes with an app that will even shift your downloads to the router itself while your computer is turned off.\n\nThe prices for the new wireless routers start at $49.95 for the Surf model and up to $129.95 for the Play Max model. Availability will begin in April for the U.S. and early May for Europe, with other regions to follow after the initial launch.\n\nApple Continues To Defy Recession, Releases New Hardware\n\nCategory: Networking, Mobile, Input Devices, Prebuilts\n\nPosted: October 21, 2009 02:35AM\n\nAuthor: d3bruts1d\n\nOn Monday Apple announced their FY09 Q4 earnings which ended on September 30, 2009. Net profit for the company rose nearly 46-percent to $1.67 billion on sales of $9.87 billion. During the quarter, Apple sold:\n\n4.7 million iPhones, a 7% growth over a year ago,\n\n3.05 million Macintosh computers, a 17% increase over a year ago, and\n\n10.2 million iPods, which while it appears to be a staggering number, is actually a decline of 8% from last year.\n\n\"We are thrilled to have sold more Macs and iPhones than in any previous quarter,\" said Steve Jobs, Apple’s CEO. \"We’ve got a very strong lineup for the holiday season and some really great new products in the pipeline for 2010.\"\n\nContinuing on the momentum of the Q4 earnings, Apple on Tuesday released a slew of new hardware in a very un-Apple-like way. Rather than a big media event, Apple simply pushed out the new hardware with a press release and update splash page on the main Apple website.\n\nMagic Mouse - Apple introduced multi-touch technology as a new way to interact with mobile devices on the iPhone and Mac Book, and now they are taking it to a new level with the \"Magic Mouse\". The low-profile seamless top is a multi-touch surface that allows you to scroll in any direction with one finger, swipe through web pages and photos using two fingers, and click or double click anywhere on the device. Apple claims that the sensor inside the mouse can determine when you are simply resting your hand on the device, swiping, or clicking. It will be interesting to see how well the device works, as previous Apple mice have been less than stellar.\n\niMac - The iMac lineup comes in 21.5\" and 27\" varieties. While the 21.5\" iMac uses the Intel Core 2 Duo processor, the new 27\" offers an Intel i5 or i7 quad core option. Both screens are LED-backlit, and the 21.5\" supports a resolution of 1920x1080. Screen space on the 27\" is increased by 78% more pixels and has a resolution of 2560x1440. Sony may use the slogan \"Beyond High Definition\" for Blu-ray, but it certainly applies to the 27\" iMac. Speaking of Blu-ray, it would have been nice to see that as an option in the 27\" iMac. Also used in the 27\" iMac is a ATI HD 4850 video card. Apple is also really happy about the design of the new iMacs, check out the video (Quicktime) for more on that.\n\nMacBook - The $999 MacBook now has a unibody design with rounded contours to make it easier to pick up and slide in or out of a bag. The rugged polycarbonate body makes it ideal for everyday usage by students and those on the go. It also has added a glass trackpad with, you guessed it, multi-touch support. The non-removable battery claims a 7 hour battery life, with 1000 charges. Some will be said to learn that along with the update, the MacBook lost its FireWire port. Interested in what the MacBook looks like on the inside? iFixit already has a teardown of the device.\n\nMac Mini & Mac Mini Server - The Mac Mini is a nice little system, though often feels neglected by Apple. It was nice to see it get an update in processing power and memory. What is interesting here is not the updated specs, but Apple has finally decided to embrace the little system as server worthy. For years now many people have taken the Mac Mini and used it as a cheap, entry level OS X server. Small business now have a more affordable server option, the Mac Mini Server. For $999 you get a nice little system than can easily be tucked away some place, but you also get OS X Server with unlimited users, no extra client access license fees required. Anyone who has ever spec’ed out a Windows Server will know that the CALs for the Server OS can end up costing more than double the hardware. TUAW goes into the other big possibilities of the Mac Mini Server.\n\nOther Stuff - Apple's Mighty Mouse has been renamed to Apple Mouse due to the lawsuit by Man and Machine. An updated Apple Wireless Keyboard was release, the new version only requires 2 AA batteries whereas the previous used 3. A new 60W MagSafe power adapter has an aluminum connector to make it more durable. The Apple remote is now aluminum, looks goofy, and can control your iPhone or any iPod connected to the Universal Dock. The AirPort Extreme Base Station and Time Capsule devices now have a bigger and more powerful antenna which promises 50% better Wi-Fi performance and 25% better range, and are certified 802.11n.\n\nIEEE Passes 802.11n Wireless Standard\n\nCategory: Networking\n\nPosted: September 14, 2009 01:12AM\n\nAuthor: Daryn Govender\n\nThe IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) has finally certified the 802.11n wireless standard. This news comes after the approval of the 802.11n-2009 amendment last weekend which \"defines how to design interoperable WLAN equipment that provides a variety of capabilities including a wide range of data rates, quality of service, reliability, range optimization, device link options, network management and security\" and describes \"WLAN Enhancements for Higher Throughput\" which \"will enable rollout of significantly more scalable WLANs that deliver 10-fold-greater data rates than previously defined while ensuring co-existence with legacy systems and security implementations.\" This approval is long overdue, seven years in total! Wireless-N products currently available are of the \"draft-n\" specification and \"proper-n\" devices should be available from manufacturers in the near future. The 560 page amendment document should be published next month. The differences between the draft-n and proper-n specifications are minimal, and shouldn't affect consumers significantly. Here's to the next faster wireless standard, and in the meantime we can feel confident knowing that wireless-n is fully certified!\n\nApp Store turns One\n\nCategory: Networking\n\nPosted: July 15, 2009 02:48AM\n\nAuthor: kingdingeling\n\nYou may not believe it, but it's just been one year since the Apple App Store was launched! The App Store is a platform for the iPhone and the iPod Touch where users can download applications to enhance the experience from their mobile devices. Just recently in April, the App store saw its 1 billionth download (OCC News), a number that has increased to 1.5 billion up to now, which is only 3 months behind the 1 billion mark. Recently, downloads have been fueled by the release of the iPhone 3GS. Apple says there are about 65,000 apps available for download, a number that is steadily increasing. However, some of the developers are not happy with Apple's ambiguous policies regarding which apps are approved and which are not. For example, an application that lets the user watch live baseball matches was approved, however an app that allowed for TV on the go was not. Even at the WWDC, Apple did not answer any questions regarding these policies, but only told the developers to go to the website for clarification.\n\nOf course, a working concept is often copied, as is the App Store. Phone developers Palm, RIM and Nokia have launched similar platforms for users to download applications to their mobile devices. Google Android and Windows Mobile also have the option of enhancing the operating system with programs. Verizon might also launch an App Store for their devices soon."
