        "text": "Many SaaS businesses emphasize customer acquisition and retention over growing gross margins, especially during the startup and scale-up stages.\n\nIt makes sense. A company can grow its revenue faster if it acquires and retains more buying customers instead of only selling more to existing customers.\n\nYet, here’s the thing. Revenue growth measures the increase in the amount of money a business earns from sales. Gross margin growth determines the profit the business makes after deducting the cost of goods sold (COGS), expenses, and taxes.\n\nThat said, how do you tell if your SaaS company is growing sustainably? And how do you know when to focus on improving profitability — rather than just capturing a larger market share or ARR?\n\nEnter the Rule of 40 for SaaS companies.\n\nWhat Is The Rule Of 40?\n\nThe Rule of 40 is a principle that states a software company’s combined revenue growth rate and profit margin should equal or exceed 40%. SaaS companies above 40% are generating profit at a sustainable rate, whereas companies below 40% may face cash flow or liquidity issues.\n\nA brief history of the Rule of 40\n\nThis concept has been around for about a decade. Brad Feld, a venture capitalist, popularized the term “Rule of 40%” in February 2015. In the article titled, “The Rule of 40% for Healthy SaaS Companies,” he describes how he learned about it from a late-stage investor during a board meeting.\n\nThe investor said they used it to assess a health software company’s suitability for investment. According to the investor, the rule applied to companies that had revenue of over $50 million per year.\n\nHowever, Brad insists that the Rule of 40% could also apply to companies with $1 million in annual revenue.\n\nWho uses the Rule of 40?\n\nInvestors.\n\nAs such, if you intend to raise venture capital, you should use The Rule of 40 to assess your investor appeal.\n\nIf you are wondering when to start using the Rule of 40%, Brad recommends following another rule popularized by SaaS investor Neeraj Agrawal; The T2D3 Approach. This is the acronym for the SaaS growth strategy “triple, triple, double, double, double”.\n\nUpon achieving product-market fit, The T2D3 method advocates tripling your annual recurring revenue (ARR) in each of the first two years, and then doubling it each successive year for the next three years.\n\nBrad Feld recommends using the Rule of 40 only after five years of using the T2D3 approach. Examples of successful companies that achieved the T2D3 method include Salesforce, ZenDesk, Marketo, ServiceNow, and Omniture.\n\nImage: T2D3 Book\n\nHow the Rule of 40 works\n\nThe Rule of 40 is an indication of how well a company is balancing profit and growth. Consider the following scenarios:\n\nNaturally, to determine whether the company is above 40% or below, it must know two things:\n\nThe Rule of 40 does not apply across every industry (it is specific to SaaS companies), but it is still a handy benchmark.\n\nThis is because the SaaS sector manages high margins of 70%-90%, making the rule readily applicable to them compared to other subscription-based companies or more traditional business models.\n\nAgain, the primary purpose of benchmarking is to make it easier to compare companies that have different operating structures, are at different phases of the business cycle, or are otherwise difficult to compare.\n\nMeasuring Growth Rate And Profitability\n\nCalculating revenue growth should be relatively straightforward for any SaaS company operating for at least a year. The Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) establish clear definitions for what constitutes revenue, and these definitions tend to remain consistent year over year.\n\nKeeping this in mind: your business should be able to quickly look at the revenue column on your most recent income statements and calculate your annualized revenue change.\n\nOn the other hand, “profitability margin” is a rather broad term that can potentially be used to describe several different items on your company’s balance sheet or income statement.\n\nA few of these possible items might include free cash flow (meaning you might need to create a statement of cash flows), total operating income, and earnings before interest, taxes, debt, and appreciation (EBITDA).\n\nIf using EBITDA, calculate profitability margin by measuring EBITDA as a percentage of total operating revenue (mentioned above).\n\nThe Rule Of 40 Formula\n\nUsing the Rule of 40, SaaS Growth Rate plus Profit Margin should be equal to or greater than 40%:\n\nSaaS Growth Rate + SaaS Profit Margin > 40%\n\nBut it’s not quite there yet. It depends on how you calculate your revenue growth and profit margin.\n\nA company’s revenue growth rate is typically measured by its monthly recurring revenue (MRR) or annual recurring revenue (ARR).\n\nMonthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) = The Total Number of Active Accounts X Average Revenue Per Account (ARPA)\n\nAnnual Recurring Revenue (ARR) = MRR × 12 months\n\nGrowth Rate = (Current Year Value – Prior Year Value) ÷ Prior Year Value\n\nWhen it comes to profit margin, the most commonly used metric is the EBITDA margin for the corresponding period.\n\nEBITDA Margin (%) = EBITDA ÷ Revenue\n\nUsing this approach, the correct formula for calculating The Rule of 40 is:\n\nThere is some debate about at what funding stage the rule should be applied (or less so), and its reliability as a metric. Yet, its simplicity and accuracy make the Rule of 40 popular.\n\n“Annual Recurring Revenue is the North Star but expanding your margins is how you win”\n\nHere’s how the Rule of 40 looks in the CloudZero platform. The top line graph is the overall calculation on a month-to-month basis, with the factors contributing to the Rule of 40 graphed beneath it.\n\nWith this view, you always have an easily accessible, up-to-date view of how you’re trending against the rule. Get started on the Rule of 40 with CloudZero.\n\nHow To Calculate The Rule Of 40 (Example)\n\nLet’s look at a simplified Rule of 40 example.\n\nIf a company generated $10 million in revenue in 2019 and $12 million in revenue in 2020, then its year-over-year revenue growth would equal 20% ($2 million divided by $10 million then multiplied by 100%).\n\nSuppose the same company is using EBITDA as its primary “profitability” metric and that its EBITDA for 2020 was $3 million. In this case, the profitability margin for the company would be 30% ($3 million divided by $10 million).\n\nIn this example, the company’s revenue growth plus profitability margin would equal 50% (20% plus 30%). This means that the company has “passed” the Rule of 40 and is likely well-positioned for the future.\n\nRevenue growth and profitability margin could be negative, especially if the company has recently accrued significant amounts of debt or significant capital expenses.\n\nHowever, even when either of these figures is, in fact, negative, the company can still utilize the Rule of 40 and hope that success in one area could offset any issues created by the other.\n\nRelated Reads:\n\nHow Malwarebytes Measures The Cost Of Their Products\n\nHow SeatGeek Decoded Their AWS Bill and Measured How Much It Costs To Host Each Enterprise Customer\n\nHow Many SaaS Companies Exceed The Rule Of 40?\n\nIn 2017, about 40% of SaaS companies achieved The Rule of 40, according to Bain and Company.\n\nCredit: Number of SaaS companies that passed the Rule of 40 in 2017\n\nIn 2021, data from the KeyBanc Capital Markets (KBCM) 2021 SaaS Survey indicated that 50 out of 175 SaaS companies with more than $5 million annual recurring revenue met the Rule of 40, which translates to 29% of the companies.\n\nCredit: Number of SaaS companies in 2021 that exceeded the Rule of 40 – KBCM data.\n\nMore recently in 2022, a Visible Alpha analysis concluded that the most well-known or largest firms in SaaS don’t always have the best outlook based on the Rule of 40.\n\nCredit: Largest SaaS companies vs. SaaS companies that exceed the Rule of 40 – Visible Alpha.\n\nHowever, some companies have consistently met and beat the rule. These include Amgen, Splunk, Adobe, Veeva, Ansys, Broadcom, and more.

Here Are Four Crucial Benefits\n\nBenchmarking, balancing profitability and growth, as well as informing long-term and short-term decisions are some examples of the uses of the Rule of 40 for SaaS businesses. Here are more details.\n\n1. The Rule of 40 offers a guide to what tradeoffs a SaaS company can afford\n\nYou are running a healthy SaaS business if you manage a 20% growth rate with a 20% profit margin. You can operate at a 10% loss if you achieve a 50% growth rate. You are also on the right track if you reach 40% growth with 0% profit and vice versa.\n\nBut suppose growth and profitability fall below 40%. In that case, you’ll want to inspect your other SaaS metrics to identify any potential issues, such as increased cost of goods sold (COGS), customer acquisition cost (CAC), churn, and more.\n\nRelated Read: How Drift Used CloudZero To Improve COGS By $2.4 Million (Case Study)\n\n2. It helps assess your ability to invest without sacrificing profit\n\nProfitability and growth rates over 40% suggest you have room to pursue hypergrowth to gain and retain more customers. A move like that can help sustain the company’s “beyond 40” performance over a more extended period.\n\nSustaining profitability and revenue growth at 20% each can be challenging, as you may easily remain in sub-scale mode for longer than necessary. A competitive market demands that you capture and hold the largest possible share of your targeted market as soon as possible.\n\nYet, you might need investors to fund that hypergrowth mode. This brings us to one of the biggest reasons for calculating the Rule of 40.\n\n3. Investors use the Rule of 40 to compare high-quality SaaS investment opportunities\n\nVCs came up with the Rule of 40, after all. It is a way to quantify a SaaS company’s potential for creating value for them as it grows — regardless of whether it is yet profitable.\n\nSaaS companies often reach high valuations, sometimes too high. But as investors consider valuation for short-term plans, they are aware that some SaaS companies destroy their value as their average annual revenue grows.\n\nCredit: Value-creating vs. value-destroying growth analysis by Boston Consulting Group.\n\nThe Rule of 40 does not take valuation into account. The approach focuses on measuring sustained value creation instead, which helps evaluate SaaS investment opportunities.\n\n4. You can use the Rule of 40 to determine when to maximize growth or profitability at any given stage\n\nIn the SaaS sector, it is assumed that startups and smaller SaaS businesses should focus on growing revenue, even if they don’t make a profit. This is not always the case.\n\nIf you are going to justify a runaway growth rate with a skin-deep margin, you need to be able to say: “we can turn a profit right away if we slow down our growth rate”.\n\nStill, the Rule of 40 can help mature SaaS businesses that have captured most of their attainable market share to focus more on margin growth than worry about expansion. After all, most SaaS companies see their growth rate decline over time.\n\nSmall companies can also use this metric to focus on marketing and sales tactics that attract and keep customers while yielding high enough margins to appeal to investors who can fund their growth.\n\nWhen To Use The Rule Of 40: Should You Measure The Rule Of 40 As A Startup?\n\nThe Rule of 40 initially applied when a SaaS business exceeded $50 million in annual revenue. Those who pioneered the rule, including Brad Feld, recommend applying it to your company if you’ve reached $1 million in annual recurring revenue.\n\nAccording to a SaaS Capital survey, many SaaS companies reach $1 million in ARR in about five years (remember the T2D3 method we mentioned earlier?). However, assessing a 12-18-month period can help you see an accurate SaaS growth curve as a younger company.\n\nAlternatively, you can wait until you have put most departments in place, have figured out your product-market fit, and sorted out cash flow issues.\n\nStill, as with any other SaaS value metric, use the Rule of 40 as part of your overall health assessment, not as the sole metric.\n\nRelated Read: How Hiya Uses CloudZero To Answer “What-If” Questions Around New Business Initiatives\n\nWhat Is A Good SaaS Growth Rate?\n\nOn average, SaaS revenue growth ranges from 15% to 45% year to year. But SaaS growth rate also varies widely based on a company’s development stage. The growth rate of companies with less than $2 million in revenue is often higher than that of companies with more than that.\n\nTake a look at this SaaS Capital chart:\n\nCredit: SaaS Capital\n\nNote:\n\nSo, what happens after calculating your 40% rule?\n\nBalancing Competing Goals\n\nUltimately, running a business — whether in the SaaS industry or any other — is going to involve making some critical tradeoffs. One typical tradeoff is that pursuing additional revenue streams will often (at least temporarily) eat into a company’s profit margin.\n\nPursuing revenue-generating activities, such as reaching a wider audience, expanding a product line, or enhancing a product via additional research and development, will introduce additional expenses that can eat at marginal profitability.\n\nAt the same time, finding ways to improve profit margins — such as cutting the marketing budget — can cause revenue to decline.\n\nThis is all okay and normal.\n\nThe management team’s role is to carefully balance both competing interests at once and think about the company’s long-term financial plan. The Rule of 40 is so useful because it allows managers to consider how each of these metrics relates to one another while still ensuring the company is at least making some type of progress.\n\nRelated Read: See How LawnStarter Used CloudZero To Power Efficient Growth And Reduce Cloud Storage Costs By 55% (Case Study)\n\nPursuing revenue growth and managing profit margins will be a vital component of running a SaaS business. The main point of emphasis here is that your business should be actively pursuing and enhancing at least one of these goals at a time.\n\nBenchmarks With A Grain Of Salt\n\nWhile the Rule of 40 is undoubtedly something that can benefit many SaaS enterprises, it is also something that should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nThere are plenty of companies above 40 that still have other financial issues and plenty below 40 that are doing quite well. Furthermore, the unusual economic year we witnessed in 2020 will inevitably cause some benchmarks to be less useful than usual.\n\nStill, even keeping these things in mind, the Rule of 40 has become quite popular throughout the broader SaaS industry. When combined with other valuable metrics, it can help managers make decisions truly best for their business.\n\nCut Waste, Optimize Cloud Costs, And Attract The Right Investors With Confidence\n\nHere’s the thing. SaaS products are hard to price profitably. It is even harder to set a price that retains and attracts your best customers — without compromising your annual recurring revenue goals. Where do you begin?\n\nCloud costs. That nagging Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), to be precise.\n\nMost cost tools only scratch the surface when reporting cloud costs; total and average costs. Not exactly the people, products, and processes that drive your cloud spend. CloudZero changes that.\n\nWith CloudZero, you can:\n\nHeck, we’ve helped customers like Drift, Remitly, and Upstart reduce cloud costs by over 22%. Others improved their Cloud Efficiency Rate by 33% on average (in just the first year). Don’t just take our word for it. to experience CloudZero firsthand and risk-free.\n\nRule Of 40 FAQs\n\nWhat is the Rule of 40 in SaaS?\n\nThe Rule of 40 states that the sum of a healthy SaaS company’s annual recurring revenue growth rate and its EBITDA margin should be equal to or exceed 40%. It is a measure of how well a SaaS balances growth with profitability.\n\nWhat is the Golden Rule of SaaS pricing?\n\nIt suggests that your product pricing should reflect the benefits and outcomes users gain from the software. This approach ensures that customers perceive the pricing as fair and see the value of their investment. This customer value focus beats arbitrary pricing and competitor pricing models. It fosters higher retention rates and sustainable revenue growth.\n\nWhat is the 80/20 Rule in Saas?\n\nThe 80/20 Rule (also known as the Pareto Principle) states that 80% of a SaaS company’s revenue often comes from just 20% of its customers. The goal is to identify and focus on the critical 20% of customers that drive the most value to your business. Prioritizing these high-value tasks and clients is the key to maximizing ROI.\n\nWhat is the Rule of 72 in Saas?\n\nThe Rule of 72 is also a SaaS growth strategy that helps estimate how many steps it takes to double SaaS revenue. It works by dividing 72 by the growth rate of each step in the customer journey. This gives the number of steps required to double revenue. For example, if each step grows by 9%, it would take 72 ÷ 9 = 8 steps to double revenue."
