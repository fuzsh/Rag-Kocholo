        "text": "Every time we use social media, sign up for a mailing list, or download a free app onto our phones, we agree to the provider’s terms of use.\n\nWhile many of these agreements are unnecessarily dense and challenging to process, they do serve one very specific role for everyday people like you and me—they set the terms for how a company can use the personal data they collect from us. Typically, that data gets used in one of three ways:\n\nPersonal data is aggregated and analyzed to provide us with more personalized advertisements.\n\nPersonal data is logged and assessed for research and development.\n\nPersonal data is sold to a data brokerage.\n\nGDPR protects the privacy rights of online users within the European Union and penalties can be applied to any company in the world that conducts data collection in the EU. The GDPR contains 7 principles that guide companies on how to gather, store, and protect user data.\n\n1. Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency\n\nBrands must articulate why they want your personal data and how they intend to use it. To take it a step further, data collectors cannot use your data against you. Companies shouldn’t, for example, track your web habits without your permission, then leverage that knowledge to compel you to purchase their service.\n\n2. Purpose limitation\n\nCompanies have to use your data in the way that they promised to apply it. While there is an exception here regarding archiving, scientific, historical, or statistical purposes, The purpose of any data collection must be specific, clear, and limited to a relevant scope. For example, private data can’t be collected for research purposes and then turned to the marketing team for outreach.\n\n3. Data minimization\n\nBrands only collect data relevant to the task at hand. For example, a company might request your name, email address, and industry to help qualify you as a potential lead for their project, but asking for a home address, your mother’s maiden name and the name of your favorite pet growing up can be a clear violation of privacy.\n\n4. Accuracy (holding)\n\nCompanies must maintain their data and take reasonable action to erase or rectify inaccurate or incomplete information. Every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that inaccurate personal data, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay.\n\n5. Storage limitation\n\nCompanies shouldn’t just keep your data for as long as they want. Instead, personal data should only be stored as long as needed and then either deleted or anonymized once it has served its purpose. With that said, “as long as needed” tends to be a bit ambiguous between industries and could just as easily be defined as after the transaction ends as it could be the entire lifetime value of the customer.\n\n6. Integrity and confidentiality (security)\n\nCompanies need systems in place to ensure the cybersecurity of their data—bad actors shouldn’t be able to access trusted personal data. Likewise, organizations ought to have backups in place if one storage system is compromised.\n\n7. Accountability\n\nCompanies must show that they are taking reasonable action to meet the six previous principles.\n\nCCPA protects the privacy rights of California residents. CCPA is applicable to for-profit businesses that collect personal data from California residents, regardless of business location. The CCPA consists of 6 consumer rights.\n\n1. Right to know\n\nYou have the right to know what information a company has collected about you, the types of sources, the purpose of collection, and third-party user access.\n\n2. Right to delete\n\nYou have the right to request the deletion of your personal data and companies must comply.\n\n3. Right to opt-out\n\nYou have the right to deny the sale of your personal data.\n\n4. Right to non-discrimination\n\nYou are protected against discrimination for exercising your CCPA rights.\n\n5. Right to correct\n\nYou have the right to request a correction of your inaccurate personal information.\n\n6. Right to limit use\n\nYou have the right to specify how your data is used.\n\nWhile the financial impact of data misuse shouldn’t be understated, perhaps the greatest business impact comes in the loss of trust between the company and its audience.\n\nIt is entirely reasonable to expect the companies that handle our data to do so securely and under the agreed terms. Anything sort of that agreement is a massive violation of trust between the people and the service provider—trust that is not easily rebuilt. Cambridge Analytica folded in less than three months, Google is still facing constant criticism, and Uber will be audited for the better part of the next two decades.\n\nWhile these actions may lack the malice of a traditional black hat cyberattack, data misuse increases the opportunities for these criminals to access private data. Many instances of data misuse start with employees or third-party vendors with legitimate access transferring company data from a secure server onto a personal device with less stringent data security features. Even the most robust network security provisions are irrelevant once data leaves the secure perimeter. Once that personal data—or access to it—is controlled by a more susceptible device, cybercriminals have a much easier path to accessing the personal data they desire.\n\nIn 2020, hackers accessed 5.2 million Marriott guest records, including customer contact information, personal preferences, birthdays, and more. This attack succeeded because the attackers compromised employee credentials to access a third-party application. It was two months before anyone realized something was wrong.\n\nWhile we can refine and perfect our online habits to prevent our own potential misuse, we rarely get to set data policies for the companies we frequent. We as users and customers and contributors must hold the brands we trust accountable for maintaining those expectations. Change never happens out of complacency; whether it’s Big Tech or Wall Street, the only way organizations create serious policy around data misuse is when their customers demand it. Organizations should have basic security structures like behavior alerts and access management tools complemented by need-to-know access and zero-trust architectures. Likewise, we as consumers have a right to clear data collection policies and transparent use cases.\n\nAs governing policies like the EU’s GDPR or California’s CCPA continue to shape the future of data regulation, it is only a matter of time before global expectations around data ownership and data misuse become more explicit expectations in every region."
