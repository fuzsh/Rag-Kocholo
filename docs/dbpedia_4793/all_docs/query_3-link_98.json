He explains how the company grew from a family start-up in Provo, Utah, to be acquired by SAP in January 2019 for $8 billion: “the largest private-enterprise-software acquisition in history.” At its IPO two years later, the opening price valued Qualtrics at three times that amount. Qualtrics transitioned from a single-product market research company primarily serving academia to a multiproduct company serving enterprises with customer-experience, employee-insights, and market research offerings. Along the way, Smith had to ask his colleagues and coworkers more than once to rebuild the technology stack, replace code, and realign a portion of the 300-person workforce.",
