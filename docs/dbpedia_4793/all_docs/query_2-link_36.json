        "text": "Here’s a question we get asked a lot:\n\nHow do you start a tech company with no money?\n\nWell – let’s just kick things off by saying the average survival rate for a startup is around 10%. That’s right — 90% of startups are shuttered before they grow enough to sustain themselves.\n\nWhy?\n\nAs research from a large database of startup post-mortems shows, failure often centers around a few major mistakes:\n\nAlmost half of failed startups shut the doors because they didn’t make a product people actually needed. Some failed because they ran out of cash, others because of an ill-equipped team.\n\nWhile the stats paint a bleak picture, knowledge is on your side. By knowing the biggest traps to avoid, and having a solid gameplan in place to build, market and sell an app people actually want to use, your startup has a fighting chance for survival.\n\nSo, where do you start?\n\nIn this article, we’ll cover an actionable 7-step plan to start a successful tech company:\n\nBuild an MVP the market wants\n\nValidate the app with early adopters\n\nIterate to meet product-market fit\n\nBuild a skilled and unified founding team\n\nGet the funding you need to grow\n\nDevelop and practice an agile methodology\n\nGenerate funding and scale team\n\nThis guide is rooted in lean startup methodology, so let’s look at an introduction to how winning startups think before diving into the step-by-step guide.\n\nDon’t Overcomplicate, Start Lean\n\nFor a tech company to make money, you’ll need a market that’s ready to buy, the right feature set to solve the pains of those users, pricing your market can afford, and a hundred other things that you can’t possibly know at the outset without doing painstaking research and spending a truckload of money:\n\nThat’s why startups perform best when they’re grown iteratively, based on user feedback from a constantly-improving app. Eric Ries outlines this successful methodology in his book The Lean Startup. This radical guide to getting a low-cost technology business off the ground before you run out of money has become the startup bible.\n\nTo run a lean startup, don’t get bogged down in creating an LLC straight away. It’s unnecessary legal baggage.\n\nTruth is: you can go into business with a general partnership and co-founder. This keeps your costs down, and saves you dealing with issues like organizational structure and taxes before you even have a product to sell.\n\nIn the lean startup methodology, the tech is far more important than the structures that support it. Your product is what’s going to make you money, after all, so start with the build.\n\nIf you have the skills or are willing to learn to code, you can start laying the foundations for a new tech startup as a side hustle, allowing the day job to pay the bills. This will give you an early prototype you can take to other potential co-founders.\n\nAs a non-technical founder, however, you need to sell your vision to a prospective CTO (chief technology officer) — this way, the technology costs nothing but time.\n\nOk:\n\nNow that you have the bare business essentials in place, and at least one technical team member, it’s time to set the wheels in motion.\n\n7 Steps to Build a Successful Tech Company\n\n#1. Shortlist the core features of an MVP\n\nMost great startup ideas are the result of a founder being unable to find a good solution to their pain. In the words of Paul Graham:\n\n“The verb you want to be using with respect to startup ideas is not ‘think up’ but ‘notice.’ At YC we call ideas that grow naturally out of the founders’ own experiences ‘organic’ startup ideas. The most successful startups almost all begin this way.”\n\nIf you’re developing a product based on your own pain, you might be the most qualified person to list its core features. But, assuming that others share this pain and are looking for a solution, you can bring on early adopters to help refine the value proposition.\n\nNailing down the features, collecting feedback and validating the concept is critical to ensuring your product roadmap is pointed in the right direction.\n\nSince 42% of failed startups close down because of poor product-market fit, making informed choices at this stage is critical to survival.\n\nYou can use a simple framework like this to define user goals and see how different pain points map to core product features:\n\nWhat is the overall idea?\n\nWho are the customers?\n\nWho are the end users?\n\nWhy would they want it?\n\nWhy are we building it?\n\nYou have to be very selective when building an MVP.\n\nFocus on providing the minimum set of features users need to achieve a goal or realize value; your project management app needs attachment uploading more than it needs support for custom emoji.\n\n3 mistakes to avoid when building an MVP\n\nOvercooking your MVP\n\nThe idea behind starting small is to start quickly.\n\nYour MVP doesn’t need to serve multiple audiences and use cases; it just needs to be validated by one niche. Get a small, highly-targeted segment of your market to buy into the idea and you get the cash needed to expand an MVP and take it to a wider market.\n\nChoosing the wrong market segment\n\nKnowing who to sell to is just as important to building an MVP with market fit. Getting an engaged community of early adopters to provide feedback doesn’t happen if you’re going after the wrong segment, and without those early adopters you won’t get the time and insight needed to iterate and grow.\n\nRefusing to pivot if the MVP won’t stick\n\nEven though you’ve done your research on the audience and feature set needed to compete in the market, it might be that your MVP is simply being marketed to the wrong customers or missing features that persuade customers to buy.\n\n“Failure in validating your MVP only invalidates a small way to acquire customers — not the whole business model.” — Swarnendu De\n\n#2. Pre-sell the MVP\n\nA lead capture page for the GrowthHacker Projects MVP, which funneled qualified companies into a concierge demo.\n\nOne way to combat the problem of running out of cash is to bring paying customers on board as fast as possible.\n\nThis gives customers a financial stake in the success of the product — they’ll be willing to help “co-develop” the product in return for getting the features that they ask for (and will want to pay for) built.\n\nSales = validation!\n\nOne of the biggest inflection points for any company is finding out people will actually pay for what you have, or plan to build.\n\nHere are the different types of MVP pre-selling strategies you can use to quickly validate a product concept:\n\nSingle-feature MVP. Focus on nailing one user goal, to validate the need for the feature and build early adoption.\n\nPiecemeal MVP. Keep costs low by combining existing products and services to come up with a unique offering. For example, your product could be the result of some Zapier zaps or a code-free prototype built with Bubble.\n\nConcierge MVP. Do some or all of the software’s work manually and work closely with customers to understand how best to improve. With that information, automate the manual work with technology.\n\nWizard of Oz MVP. An MVP that seems like a software service, but its results come from manual work. This is a way to validate the results your app will provide and whether customers will pay for them.\n\nCrowdfunded MVP. A lot of successful startups came from a video of a one-off prototype uploaded to Kickstarter — with crowdfunding, you can generate buzz and get feedback on a product before you’ve put it into production. This keeps costs down while giving you money to survive on.\n\nSmoke test MVP. Validate demand for your idea by sending paid traffic to a pre-release signup page. The number of signups will help you gauge the level of interest.\n\n#3. Source talent with equity\n\nNot technical? No problem.\n\nYou’ll be able to find an excited technical co-founder if you have the right startup idea and equity offer.\n\nYou don’t have to spend money sourcing talent — instead, use a platform like VentureStorm to get connected with your perfect CTO or CEO.\n\nThere’s a lot of debate over the matter, but startups typically offer technical co-founders around 10-35% in equity. This is because future funding will further dilute equity, so giving away a chunk close to half can be a risk for CEOs looking for investment.\n\n#4: Acquire customers\n\nOnce the MVP has been validated and you have iterated with user feedback, the next step is to release the product into a wider segment of your target market.\n\nYou can meet all the right user goals with all the right features, but if no one knows your product exists you will lose out to a competitor.\n\nIn the world of SaaS, it’s a land grab. You need to take the oxygen out of the room.\n\nFor startups that don’t have enterprise budgets, large-scale paid ad campaigns and a well-oiled sales team are largely unattainable.\n\nLack of budget is definitely a disadvantage, but not a game-ender. It just means you have to get scrappy, and do hard manual promotion that doesn’t scale.\n\nThis often involves finding where your customers hang out online, and getting involved in the conversation.\n\nGenerating early buzz with online communities\n\nEvery startup remembers their first Hacker News home run or Product Hunt launch — probably because the amount of traffic it blasted at the servers took them offline.\n\nA popular piece of content or well-received product launch that shoot to the top of sites like Reddit, Hacker News, and Product Hunt can send tens of thousands of visitors to your site. It’s a tactic used as part of regular content promotion and bigger product/feature launches.\n\nFor example, below is a 2007 Hacker News relic from Dropbox founder Drew Houston:\n\nNot only did this post get the attention of product experts, it also got thousands of users to weigh in on Dropbox.\n\nFor small sites that could mean a 60%+ increase in sessions overnight. Check out the Show HN category to see what’s hot, and try to replicate the formula.\n\nReddit is another site that consists of thousands of communities – everything from SaaS to data visualizations. It’s well-known that Reddit hates self-promotion, but submitting content that’s genuinely relevant and useful to a specific community can be a way to get vital attention in the early days:\n\nThis post links off to a promotional resource but gives the community the full text in a Reddit post — this makes it easier for users to read and comment, and is seen as less spammy than simply dropping a link in the subreddit.\n\nFour startups that grew by doing things that don’t scale\n\nTinder\n\n(Source)\n\nApps like Tinder live and die by the size of their networks. It’s a hyperlocal app, so it needed to onboard a lot of users in close geographical proximity for the pilot period.\n\nTinder launched a series of popular parties in California and made it mandatory to have the app installed to gain entry.\n\nPeople attending the parties installed the app, and Tinder’s user base grew to 15,000 overnight. The “network effect” baked a viral loop into the product, helping to retain existing users and attract waves of new ones.\n\nIn 2019, it was announced that Tinder had 5.9M paying users.\n\nQuora\n\nDeveloping a community-driven product without an actual community is a tough ask. In the early days of the site, Quora founders would start and engage in threads to provide an illusion that the community was a lot larger than it actually was.\n\nHerd mentality took hold, and soon thousands of new users were flocking to the site to engage in the conversation. Eventually, it hit a critical mass and the founders no longer had to seed new conversations.\n\nGenerating a wide variety of question-answer content around different topics is also a way to rank in the search engines for specific long tail keywords. By seeding Quora with a range of frequently asked questions in the startup/tech/coding worlds, it became wiki for information that could be expanded with different community perspectives.\n\nIt’s vital at the start to provide a way for users to see how they should use the platform and why it’s beneficial to them – the Quora staff did this by leading by example.\n\nBonus resource: Check out step #12 in this guide to learn how to mine Quora for a high-traffic threads. This is a great way to engage in the conversation, provide value, and generate targeted referral traffic to your tech startup.\n\nTwoodo\n\nIt might not be a game-changer for a mature product, but 72 signups can make a massive difference for an early-stage startup.\n\nTwoodo managed to attract 452 unique visitors which converted at a rate of 16% with a strategy that involved the founder making targeted comments on 40 blogs. The whole project took just 6.5 hours, but helped the company land its first customers.\n\nStripe\n\n(Source)\n\nStripe founders, now a hallowed duo in startup circles, got their product used by early customers with very hands-on tactics. The founders visited leads in person, where it was easy to gain access to their computers and do custom set-up work for the Stripe API (remember what we were saying earlier about how an MVP can be partly manual at first?).\n\n“If you were interested in Stripe, they would set it up for you on the spot. They didn’t go back to their office and send you a link by email hoping you’d sign up. There was no choice. If you said, “yes” to try Stripe, they would grab your laptop and set it up for you.” — Mikael Cho\n\nBonus resource: Want more inspiration?

Look at the numbers\n\nBy pushing new users into the product funnel, you get data on how well the app performs in the hands of real customers — do they stick, or churn out quickly? What changes need to be made?\n\nWhile signups are great, but they only tell part of the story. If you can’t get users to adopt the product, you’ll leak revenue and find it near impossible to get funding.\n\nHere’s a shortlist of the most important metrics every tech startup should be measuring:\n\nActive users\n\nActive users regularly return to use your product. They didn’t log in and leave never to be seen again — they get real value from the product, and are one of the most valuable assets for your business.\n\nHow to calculate active users\n\nActive users are usually analyzed by time period. So, your monthly active users (MAUs) are those who have logged in within the last 30 days. Every app promotes different usage frequencies.\n\nTwitter hopes you use the product every day, because there’s always something new to see and it makes money from ad impressions. Something like Sumo is a tool users might need to use much less frequently, because once you’ve deployed a pop-up form you don’t need to log in and adjust it every single day.\n\nTo calculate active users, you’ll need a free tool like Google Analytics or a paid, dedicated customer data platform like Amplitude or Mixpanel. The calculations are done with user IDs and event tracking.\n\nRetention rate\n\nRetention rate is often low for apps. Small improvements make a big difference.\n\nRetention rate is the metric you need to improve if you want to grow your active users. It measures the percentage of users that log back in after signing up. If your retention is low — e.g., no one that signed up a month ago still uses your product — you’re better off putting money into retaining customers than generating leads because it costs 6-7x less to retain an existing user than it does to attract a new one.\n\nWhat’s the point in attracting new users if they’re only going to stick around for a month?\n\nHow to calculate retention rate\n\nRetention rate can be calculated with this formula:\n\nCustomer Retention Rate = ( ( Number of customers at the end of a period – New customers created in that period ) / Number of customers at the start of that period ) * 100\n\nLike the active users metric, 30 days is a good guideline. Diving deeper into the data, you can also find correlations between customer profiles and behaviors that promote retention.\n\nFor example, a user that invites their team might be more likely to retain than one who just uses the product by themselves.\n\nNet Promoter Score (NPS)\n\nHow happy are users?\n\nThe NPS metric gives you the answer:\n\nAs the image hints, users that participate in this survey are divided into one of three buckets depending on their response. With feedback of 9 or 10, a user is an asset to your company — they’re doing marketing work for you – likely sending high-converting referrals your way each month.\n\nUsers scoring 1-6 are detractors who are unlikely to have much good to say about your product, whereas the neutral scorers (7-8) could go either way.\n\nWhat do you do with this data?\n\nWell, your overall NPS score is a solid measure of user happiness. The higher the score, the healthier your customer base. You can also market differently to each NPS segment — for example, launch campaigns to convert neutral fence-sitters into product evangelists!\n\nHow to calculate NPS\n\nThe first step is to deploy an NPS survey. This can be done over email, during support sessions, or inside the app itself. Tools include Delighted, Promoter.io, and Wootric:\n\nEach data point you get back from a survey is simply a number between 1 and 10.\n\nTo calculate NPS, use this formula:\n\nNet Promoter Score = (% of respondents scoring 9 or 10) – (% of respondents scoring 1 to 6)\n\n#6. Stay Agile\n\nThe Agile Manifesto and the world of literature that surrounds it is always essential startup reading!\n\nCollecting metrics and crunching numbers is great, but at this scale it’s easy to get bogged down in data that might matter less than just improving your product.\n\nWith user feedback and reports on key metrics like retention and activation, it’s time to make product, feature, and marketing iterations that impact your bottom line. This means making decisions based on limited data and voices of a few dedicated customers — it can feel like a leap of faith, but the old Facebook mantra of Move Fast and Break Things is still a valuable lesson for startups.\n\nYour team and product will grow as it gains traction, but you need internal processes and structure to support that.\n\nFor many successful startups, that means:\n\nWorking in sprints. Iterate on the product in 2-week bursts, evaluating performance at the end of each sprint and having open discussions about what went wrong and what went well.\n\nTaking user feedback logging seriously. User feedback is so vital to startup success, but it’s often mismanaged. Create specific tags in your support ticketing tool that describe the feature or aspect a user is talking about (#feedback-sidebar-ui), or at least diligently upkeep a Google Sheet with the latest snippets of feedback.\n\nKilling features or campaigns that don’t move the needle. You have such limited resources that you can’t afford to press on in the wrong direction. Does the data say that a beta feature you’re pushing hard isn’t getting much adoption?\n\n#7. Fund and Scale\n\nThe mistake a lot of startups make is thinking that step #7 is actually step #1.\n\nGetting funding to scale should come later in the startup journey. First, you need to establish product-market fit, get early adopters, and iterate fast before implementing a large scale go-to market strategy:\n\n“Funding is appropriate for products that have some traction in a large market. For the 99 percent of companies that don’t fit this bill, external capital can be a recipe for disaster. If you’re at the invention stage, just remember that necessity is the mother of invention, not money.” — Dave Bailey, VC and serial founder\n\nScaling too early can hurt a young startup. Boris Wertz of Version One VCs advises that there’s nothing damaging about scaling up things that serve many users for little cost — like better server infrastructure or self-serve acquisition — but scaling up on things that burn through money without producing reliable results, like big sales and marketing initiatives, is often a factor in failure.\n\nFor these reasons, seek out funding when you’ve already got a validated MVP and a list of active paying customers. This will separate your business from the many others vying for investor capital.\n\nHere are some of the funding options available for early-stage startups:\n\nCrowdfunding\n\nAlongside accelerators and angel investors, crowdfunding is one of the few funding options available in the early stages before a product generates real revenue.\n\nServices that can help crowdfund your startup include Kickstarter, IndieGogo, and Fundable — the options available are either pre-selling an MVP, or selling percentages of company stock to investors.\n\nAngel investors\n\nAngel investors are often ex-founders that have a combination of startup experience and tons of cash from their last big exit. They tend to invest in companies that have valuations of around $3m, and will typically invest around $150,000.\n\nAccelerators\n\nAccelerators don’t just offer money. They offer connections, mentoring, and opportunities that would otherwise be out of reach for most startups.\n\nWhen a startup’s application to an accelerator is accepted, they will usually give up around 7-10% of their company equity in exchange for $25-$125k.\n\nWhile most accelerators take a sizable chunk of equity, MassChallenge takes a 0% cut and still offers $3m in cash annually to startups as part of its accelerator programs.\n\nMassChallenge is a not-for-profit community of investors with access to angel groups, law firms, marketing agencies, PR firms, venture capital firms, and corporate executives — everything a startup needs to get set up and go to market.\n\nFounding teams also have access to staff training sessions and workshops on strategy, marketing, fundraising, and team alignment.\n\nInterested? Register here.\n\nReady. Set. Build.\n\nIt’s obvious from the stats that starting a tech company is no walk in the park. With something as complex as software and as unpredictable as team chemistry, there is bound to be a large margin for error.\n\nHowever, if you follow these steps you’re set with a battle-tested framework that successful startups like Dropbox, Uber, and Buffer have all used to build, validate, and market.\n\nTo recap:\n\nDefine what your MVP will and won’t be. List the features, and think about the lightest way to solve one important user problem.\n\nPre-sell your MVP. Leverage connections, crowdfunding, and smoke tests to build buzz and raise cash.\n\nOffer equity to build a great founding team. Tech startups need a CEO and CTO at the bare minimum. Use talent-sourcing sites to find a co-founder with the right skills, energy, and vision.\n\nHustle to reach your first few customers. Without user feedback, software can be built in the wrong direction, wasting resources and ultimately killing the company. The money your first few customers pay is important, but their input on what features to build next, and why, is priceless.\n\nAnalyze your data and pivot (or don’t). Use customer analytics tools to capture the ways users use your app, measure retention, and other success metrics. If something’s broken, find out what it is and fix it.\n\nPractice agile methodology. As your team and product scales, it gets too complex to manage informally. Agile helps startups build products in quantifiable sprints of work, and in short enough cycles to adjust to customer feedback.\n\nGet funded, scale your team. If you’ve made it this far, you have a validated idea. To make money and grow, you just need to double down on what works. That’s what funding gives you the freedom to do.\n\nIt’s a long road, but when you think about how fraught with pitfalls it is, the fact that 10% of startups survive is a good thing, because with the right action plan you’ll position yourself ahead of the majority of other businesses trying to build the tech company the wrong way."
