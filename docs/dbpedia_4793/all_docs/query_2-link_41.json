For additional information about those regulations and the electronic system that was implemented in conjunction with them, please review the below for answers to frequently asked questions.\n\nWhy did the Office issue this rule?\n\nUnder section 512 of title 17, the Office is required to maintain a “current directory” of agents that have been designated by service providers to receive notifications of claimed infringement. Since 1998, service providers have submitted paper designations to the Office, which the Office then scanned and posted on the Office’s website to make them available to the public. To modernize its practices, the Office created a fully-electronic online system through which service providers can more efficiently submit and update, and the public can more easily search for and find, designated agent information. The adopted final rule governs service provider use of this system and updated what is required of service providers to remain compliant with section 512(c)(2).\n\nWho must designate an agent?\n\nAny service provider (within the meaning of 17 U.S.C. 512(k)(1)) seeking the safe harbor protections of section 512. Related or affiliated service providers that are separate legal entities (e.g., corporate parents and subsidiaries) are considered separate service providers, and each must have its own separate designation.\n\nWhat if a service provider has previously designated an agent with the Copyright Office?\n\nAny service provider that previously designated an agent with the Office via the old paper system had a year-long period that ended on December 31, 2017 to submit a new designation electronically through the online registration system. As of January 1, 2018, any designation not made through the online system has expired and is no longer valid. To be clear, the Office has not retroactively invalidated these designations. Rather, to the extent they were otherwise compliant, they remained valid and in effect until December 31, 2017.\n\nWho can designate an agent with the Copyright Office or manage a service provider’s designation with the Office (e.g., amend, resubmit, or renew a designation)?\n\nAnyone the service provider authorizes to act on its behalf. This can be an employee of the service provider or a third party like a DMCA agent service or law firm. The online system is flexibly designed to allow multiple service provider designations to be managed through a single registration account. Meaning, for example, that a third party can manage several unrelated service providers through one account. Or, as another example, an employee of a parent company can manage the parent company’s designation as well as the designations of its subsidiaries through one account. Separate service provider and designated agent contact information can be provided for each individual service provider, even when managed through the same account. In some cases, a service provider may wish to change who manages its designation, and that new manager may not have access to the account through which the designation had been previously managed. In such cases, the designation can be transferred from the old manager’s account into the new manager’s account by making a written request to the Copyright Office. For information about transfers, see “Can I transfer a service provider designation from one system user account to another?” below.\n\nWho may serve as a designated agent?\n\nA designated agent may be an individual (e.g., “Jane Doe”), a specific position or title held by an individual (e.g., “Copyright Manager”), a specific department within the service provider’s organization or within a third-party entity (e.g., “Copyright Compliance Department”), or a third-party entity generally (e.g., “ACME Takedown Service”). Only a single agent may be designated for each service provider.\n\nHow does a service provider designate an agent with the Copyright Office?\n\nHow do I create a registration account with the Office?\n\nHow do I amend a designation?\n\nHow do I renew a designation?\n\nHow do I terminate a designation?\n\nHow do I make changes to my registration account?\n\nHow do I terminate my registration account?\n\nWhat is the fee to designate an agent with the Copyright Office (or to amend, resubmit, or renew a designation)?\n\nThe current fee is $6 per designation, amendment, or resubmission. There is no separate fee to renew per se because each time you amend or resubmit, and pay the $6 fee to do so, you are fulfilling the renewal requirement. There is no longer an additional fee for alternate names.\n\nWhat information must be made available on a service provider’s website and provided to the Copyright Office to designate an agent?\n\nA service provider is required to supply its full legal name, physical street address (not a post office box), any alternate names used by the service provider, and the name, organization, physical mail address (street address or post office box), telephone number, and email address of its designated agent.\n\nWhat are alternate names?\n\nAlternate names are all names that the public would be likely to use to search for the service provider’s designated agent in the Copyright Office’s online directory of designated agents, including all names under which the service provider is doing business, website names and addresses (i.e., URLs), software application names, and other commonly used names. Separate legal entities are not considered alternate names. For website addresses, the Office considers providing the top level domain (e.g., copyright.gov) sufficient to comply with Office regulations. It is not necessary to list all subdomains (e.g., copyright.gov/dmca-directory, dmca.copyright.gov) operated by the same service provider.\n\nAre there any circumstances under which I can provide a P.O. Box for the service provider’s address?\n\nWhat additional information must be provided to the Copyright Office for administrative purposes?\n\nThe first name, last name, telephone number, and email address of a representative of the service provider who will serve as the primary point of contact for communications with the Office, and a telephone number and email address for the service provider. Information for a secondary point of contact may be provided as well. While optional, the Copyright Office strongly recommends providing information for a secondary contact as a backup to best ensure that important communications from the Office reach the appropriate person. The primary and secondary contacts are attached to the registration account, as opposed to the service provider’s designation. This means that these individuals are the primary and secondary contacts for all service providers managed by a single account. This is in contrast to the service provider and designated agent contact information which is specific to each service provider and which may be different from the primary and secondary contacts’ information.\n\nAm I required to provide four different points of contact for the Office?\n\nCan I transfer a service provider designation from one system user account to another?\n\nWhat is the periodic “renewal” requirement?\n\nA service provider’s designation will expire and become invalid three years after it is registered with the Office, unless the service provider renews such designation by either amending it to correct or update all relevant information or resubmitting it without amendment to confirm the designation’s continued accuracy. Either amending or resubmitting a designation through the online system begins a new three-year period before such designation must be renewed, from the date of renewal. For example, if a service provider registers a new designation on January 1, 2017, and thereafter makes no amendment to that designation, it must renew the designation (by amending or resubmitting it) prior to January 1, 2020. But if that service provider instead amends its initial designation on March 1, 2019 to update it with new information, the three-year renewal clock is reset, and March 1, 2022 becomes the date prior to which the service provider must renew the designation. If the service provider then resubmits its designation without amendment on February 25, 2022 to satisfy the renewal requirement, then the three-year clock is reset again, and February 25, 2025 becomes the next date prior to which the service provider must renew again.\n\nWill I get a reminder when it is time to renew my designation?\n\nYes. To help ensure that no service provider accidentally forgets to renew its designation, the online system will automatically email reminders to the primary and secondary contacts, service provider, and designated agent at 90 days, 60 days, 30 days, and 1 week prior to each service provider’s renewal deadline.\n\nWhat is the difference between an amendment, a resubmission, and a renewal?\n\nAn amendment is when a change is made to update a designation. A resubmission is when a designation is refiled with the Office without amendment in order to confirm its continued accuracy. A renewal occurs whenever an amendment or resubmission is made.\n\nWhy is renewal being required?\n\nThe Office has found the old paper-generated directory to contain significant inaccuracies and outdated information. Although service providers are required to update their designations with the Office as information changes, an examination of a large sample of designations found that 22% were for defunct service providers, while approximately 65% of non-defunct service providers’ designations had inaccurate information (when compared to the information provided by service providers on their own websites). The renewal requirement will help ensure that the directory stays up to date, and additionally will assist service providers in retaining their safe harbor protections by reminding them to keep their information current.\n\nWhat is the consequence for choosing not to designate an agent or failing to keep a designation current and accurate (including failing to renew)?\n\nHow do I search the directory?\n\nIs the old paper-generated directory still available online?"
