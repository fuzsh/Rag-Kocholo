Look closely at your modem and you will notice a sticker which may look like below image.\n\nNow as you see it has both username and password printed on it (note that the wording may be different for different companies, for example, username as network name & password as wireless key). As you have got both so proceed to Step No. 2 below.\n\nHowever, in case you cannot physically access your device due to any reason just click on drop-down list below and select company of your model and you will see list many popular default login Username IDs & Passwords for your model, which can be used right away."
