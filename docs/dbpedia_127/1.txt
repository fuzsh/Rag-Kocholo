Det. Lipranzer: How ya doin'? Christmas present.

[takes out glass which was key piece of evidence that went missing during the trial]

Rusty Sabich: You're sticking your neck out pretty far on this one, Lip.

Det. Lipranzer: It was *them* that fucked up. Remember when they came around and gathered *all* the evidence? The glass wasn't there, I took it down to Dickerman. The next day, I get a call. The test is done, I can come pick up my glass. But when I went down there, Molto had already signed the receipt 'returned to evidence.' I guess they figured I'd put it back. Only, I got no reason to put it anyplace since it ain't my Goddamned case anymore. So I tossed the thing in my drawer. I figure sooner or later someone's gotta ask me about it. Nobody did.

Rusty Sabich: You think I killed her.

Det. Lipranzer: The lady was bad news.

Rusty Sabich: So that makes it okay that I killed her.

Det. Lipranzer: Did ya?

Rusty Sabich: Oh, pal.

[sigh, tosses glass into the water]
