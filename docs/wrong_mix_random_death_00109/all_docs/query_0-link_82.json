        "text": "In alphabetic order, we present a list of the nicest and coziest Art House cinemas spotted by our locals in 59 European cities. All of them are local favorites and many of them off the tourist track, so going to one of these theaters is a great chance to have a local experience!\n\nCinecenter – Amsterdam\n\nCinecenter is a very nice Amsterdam venue specialising in art-house movies plus interesting series featuring a certain actor, director or theme.\n\nIt has four showrooms that are rather cosy, with the smallest feeling like a living room. They recently started “Expat cinema nights” – where original language movies are subtitled in English (not Dutch)!\n\nDanaos cinema – Athens\n\nDanaos is one of the cinemas you can count on because you know it will play the good ones.\n\nNot the overly underground art house ones, not the unashamed blockbusters either; the good ones, be they Hollywood, animated films, European, or even Greek cinema, which have been flourishing in recent years.\n\n“Watching a film and then going for a beer nearby is a combination that’s quickly becoming a personal favourite of mine, especially on Wednesdays when entrance goes for just €5” —Dimitris Hall\n\nCines Renoir – Barcelona\n\nIn the Raval neighbourhood, you can find many great bars, but also cinemas. One of these cinemas is Cines Renoir; one of the great things about it is that they show films in their original language, not only dubbed films like many other cinemas in Spain do.\n\nIt also has a great bar opposite it, El Laurel, which is nice to visit after your movie visit.\n\nIllegal cinema – Belgrade\n\nIllegal cinema is the place to see hard-to-find documentaries, activist, queer, anarchist, forbidden and underground films.\n\nThe entrance is free, but the space is limited to only 30 seats. Screenings take place every Sunday at 18:00 in a small cultural centre Magacin. “Illegal Cinema” became a kind of an institution which is still going strong seven years later”.\n\nThe Moviemento – Berlin\n\nMoviemento is a favourite place for local independent filmmakers to show their films.\n\nIt’s also for those who are tired of mainstream arts. International movies are being shown mostly in their original languages with subtitles.\n\n“The venue itself is well worth a look, and you can always sit down and have a cup of coffee or beer while you check the program”. —Sharon Mertins\n\nKino Rex – Bern\n\nKino Rex has carefully selected its films as their interior. All of the films are played in their original language with German and French subtitles.\n\n”It has become a hotspot for the city’s established artists, journalists and critics alike. In my opinion, this makes the place only more interesting though. Even if I don’t plan to see a movie, I often come to the stylish retro-chic bar just to have a drink, talk about movies and watch the Bernese cultural scene preparing for the latest arthouse flick.” —Sebastian Meier\n\nKino Film Europe – Bratislava\n\nKino Film Europe is one of Bratislava’s smaller but more authentic cinemas.\n\nIt’s located in a grand building with a unique history – it once was the residence of the Third Reich and later Lenin’s Museum. The building recently got a beautiful new facade.\n\nTheir main focus is European cinema, but they screen all kinds of recently released independent movies from around the world, so you don’t even need to speak Slovak.\n\nScreenings take place four times a week and cost €4, way cheaper than big multiplexes, and you get to experience that special atmosphere of the building too.\n\nCinematek – Brussels\n\nCinematek offers a great variety of classics, rare cult movies, experimental cinema, directors/actors or genres from very old to more recent highlights of movie history collected by the Royal Movie Archive.\n\nBetter to buy your tickets upfront; on busy nights, they are sold out quickly.\n\n“Founded in the thirties last century, the Royal Movie Archive started to build one of the most important quality movie collections in the world”, —Wouter Spitters\n\nCinema Europa – Bucharest\n\nCinema Europa is the only Europa Cinemas cinema in Bucharest, as far as we can tell. Our Spotters haven’t covered it yet, but the films they show are the best in the art-house today, so we thought it would be worth putting on this list!\n\nUrania Cinema – Budapest\n\nBudapest has amazing movie theatres, but Urania is considered by many the most beautiful.
