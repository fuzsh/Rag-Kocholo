        "text": "Phillies, Mets, Tigers Among The Teams With City Connect Jerseys\n\nExcitement is building as we are a few short weeks away from Major League Baseball’s 2024 opening day. For nine teams, this new season will also mean a new uniform option to throw into the mix, with MLB continuing the City Connect jersey program.\n\nNine teams will be rocking these threads during the 2024 season. They will be: the Detroit Tigers, Philadelphia Phillies, Cleveland Guardians, Toronto Blue Jays, New York Mets, Minnesota Twins, St. Louis Cardinals, Tampa Bay Rays, and the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\n“For the fourth year in a row, Major League Baseball is rolling out its creative, yet polarizing, City Connect alternate uniforms,” USA Today said.\n\nIn addition, these alternate jerseys explore an innovative artistic touch. Often the color schemes are a bit louder. They represent the cities’ culture and history in a unique fashion. This model has been quite popular in the NBA. From fluorescent colors to graffiti fonts, often the basketball jerseys are in a color that is not part of the team’s general kit.\n\n“Introduced in the 2021 season, the Nike MLB City Connect Series celebrates each city’s deep-rooted history, culture and spirit that continues to bring the clubs and their communities together,” MLB explained.\n\nWhat To Expect With The City Connect Jersey\n\nMLB has not unveiled the official City Connect jersey for any of the nine teams named for this year. The expectation is that they will do so after the start of the season.\n\nWhat we do know is that the look will be significantly different from the alternate look that many teams wear. For example, in San Diego, the Padres wore a jersey that featured a pink, teal and fluorescent color scheme. This was a big departure from their standard brown and yellow.\n\nThe Miami Marlins had a red with white stripe City Connect jersey. The Colorado Rockies jersey paid tribute to the state license plate, and the Boston Red Sox have a yellow jersey with a light blue cap.\n\nMLB has made significant strides in their attempt to modernize part of the sport. The City Connect concept is unconventional yet fun. You can see all of the teams that have worn City Connect jerseys in years past here.\n\nIn addition to the City Connect option, each MLB team will have new technology built into their uniforms. This was developed by Nike over the past few years. It was first tested on the diamond in Seattle during the 2023 all-star game.\n\nThe vapor technology has a premier elite and a premier limited edition. Both allow for better moisture absorption. Furthermore, the primary intent is to increase mobility and comfort.\n\nJeff Gorra is a Boston-based writer who has been with Beasley Media Group since the beginning of 2023.

Jeff’s an avid surfer, New York Giants, and Pearl Jam fan, however, if you make unforgettable pizza, he is sure to find you."
