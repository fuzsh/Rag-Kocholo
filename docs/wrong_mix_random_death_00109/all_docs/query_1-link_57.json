        "meta_description": "In Association with ILEA Live 2016, this event was a tribute to the films of Quentin Tarantino! Guests were immersed into the world of the iconic films of one of the greatest writer/directors in cinematic history. Tarantino’s legendarily quotable dialogue is framed by his homage to great music and his obsession with food – two things event professionals love. This night was filled with great food, lively music and exciting entertainment!\r\nThis event raised $32,500 to support the efforts of the SEARCH Foundation.",
