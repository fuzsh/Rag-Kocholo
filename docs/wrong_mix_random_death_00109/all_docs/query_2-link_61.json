        "text": "Joe Amon\n\nOperations Manager\n\nJoe Amon completed his undergraduate work at Emerson College, where he majored in film production with a concentration in post-production. After his undergraduate work in Boston, Amon relocated to New York, where he has balanced a creative career as a director and editor, while also specializing in production as a production manager.\n\nCreatively, Amon has written, directed, and edited short films, web series, and documentaries (long and short form) for film and television. He also has consulted for independent production companies overseeing story development and occasionally working as a freelance editor. He has served as director of photography for several short form documentaries and web series.\n\nIn terms of production, Amon has worked primarily in feature films, commercials, and episodic television. Before production managing, he steadily climbed the production ladder as a location scout, extras coordinator, and line producer on various projects. He is currently attending the Feirstein Graduate School of Cinema, working on a short film.\n\nDustin Chang\n\nEquipment Room Manager\n\nDustin Chang was born in South Korea and studied painting in high school.

As a child, Gunve began to explore the capabilities of computers to create different sounds and textures. His fascination with rock music led him to electric guitar, which he began to study voraciously, simultaneously imagining ways to expand its boundaries. At the same time, he experimented with sequencing and learned how to build computer and synthesizer modules that could be used practically during performances and on recordings. Now, he translates his sensual impressions of the universe into intricate, personal, and melodic musical passages that allow him to connect powerfully with his own musicians, the audience, and each space in which he performs. He has composed music and worked as a sound designer for a wide range of independent films and Web projects as well as for various large-scale art projects in Sweden. In 2007, he founded an instrumental project, PHWG, a group that combines video, electronic instruments, cello, violin, drums, and tabla/darbuka. He has released two albums—Great Wall of Sound (2006) and Movements (2008). Gunve continues to record and perform with bands throughout the New York City area. He released The Observer in 2013 and was a finalist in the Battle of the Boroughs competition in 2014.\n\nJung-Hun Kim\n\nTechnology and Resources Manager\n\nJung-Hun Kim has more than 20 years of experience in the world of film and television production.
