In such a way, as soon as the system makes the selection, you just need to proofread the script.",

        "text": "— How much time do you need to develop the final version?\n\n— Depends on the script complexity. We act as assistants for professionals, we are not trying to substitute them. But the saving of time is considerable with the use of our program.\n\n— What are the challenges you face during your work on the project? How do you solve them?\n\n— One of our problems lies in the fact that people, especially creative people, didn’t understand what modern technologies are capable of, and they were sceptical to our idea. However, after they tried our Beta-version, they changed their point of view. Sure, there are bags but we are actively working to solve them.\n\n— By the way, how safe is it to download the script in the application? How do you secure the client’s data?\n\n— We are very cautious about the security question, as the script is the most valuable thing in the filming process of any film. All data is stored on Google’s encrypted servers, and we’re planning to undergo a security audit to meet all standards by the time of the project launch.\n\n...\n\n— How many people are currently working on the project?\n\n— There is a team that consists of 6 people, three of them are co-founders. We have known each other for many years ever since the studentship. To my surprise, I made up the team in less than a week ( it was about a year and a half ago). Since then, the team’s roster has slightly changed.\n\n— What is your major and what are the majors of your team members?\n\n— The majority of the team has technical education but we also have graduates from the Foreign Languages department, and there is also a person without a degree and that’s me. I quit university in the third year when I changed the form of activity — I switched to photo and video shooting, and that is how I end up with launching the startup.\n\n— How are responsibilities assigned?\n\n— We all develop the project, including me. I completely develop the UI/UX part, and everything that is “on the dark side of the moon” — all the server part and the neural network is done by the team. Our responsibilities are a bit blended right now, we are a startup, we learn together, look for solutions and help each other in all cases. For example, there are not many leads now, so we process them on our own and step-by-step build up a full-fledged workflow.\n\n— Recently, Filmustage has gone through the acceleration in the Startup Training Camp. How did you get there and what did you get from it?\n\n— We met Gabil Tagiev, the founder of Rocket DAO (a Startup Training Camp acceleration program is a part of Rocket DAO ecosystem), on one of the mentor sessions, provided by Angels band. Back then, Tagil invited us to take part in acceleration, and we agreed immediately.\n\nWe like the event-format, it didn’t take much time that startups don’t have by default, and it was extremely effective. We were pleasantly surprised by the fact that guys from Rocket DAO found knowledgeable experts for our project, they also invited Andrey Kureychik to help. He liked our project, and he gave useful hints and pieces of advice. The event appeared to be quite effective, besides, we won a prize of $7000, which will come in use.\n\nPieces of advice for startuppers-beginners\n\nThe first thing to do is to validate the idea. At first, I would recommend defining the problem, not masterminding it, and generate the solution idea to that problem. Then, the market would definitely like it.\n\nThe second thing is the team. The startup is a team-game, you won’t go far along. Will it work out with the team or not, you will see at the early work stages. If people are on the same “vibe”, they are ready to work out of their area of responsibilities, they are optimistic about the project just like you — those are the people you need. Still, it takes time to test a team so that you go through difficulties together. I would also recommend going for a trip with your team or partners: people tend to show who they are when they are out of their comfort zone. Together with my team, we met the difficulties, went for many joint trips, and I surely say that we are on the same “vibe” and understand each other."
