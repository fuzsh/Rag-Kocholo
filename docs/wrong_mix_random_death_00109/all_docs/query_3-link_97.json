        "text": "Former NFL running back Rashad Jennings might need to brush up on his film expertise. On Wednesday night’s (Oct. 18) episode of Celebrity Wheel of Fortune, Jennings faced off against fellow former NFL players Marcellus Wiley and Jared Allen, but fumbled on a seemingly simple answer.\n\nJennings was competing to raise money for the Rashad Jennings Foundation, which focuses on “health, leadership, mentorship, and reading,” per his interview featured on the show’s official X (the platform formerly known as Twitter) account.\n\nAt one point in the episode, Jennings was just one letter away from solving the following puzzle: “DRIVING TO RENO WITH _UENTIN TARANTINO.”\n\nWhile the correct answer is “Q” to spell out the critically-acclaimed Pulp Fiction director Quentin Tarantino, Jennings opted for “P,” spelling out “DRIVING TO RENO WITH PUENTIN TARANTINO,” instead.\n\nHost Pat Sajak attempted to soften the blow by saying, “No, no I’m sorry.” However, Wheel of Fortune fans were not as kind to the Dancing with the Stars Season 24 champ on social media.\n\nHis guess was slammed as “embarrassing” and was even deemed “the worst Wheel of Fortune guess ever.”\n\nOthers chimed in to poke fun at the guess, with one writing, “Dude said P with such confidence,” and “You don’t know his brother Puentin?? Directed classics like Gulp Fiction, Reservoir Cats, and the Greatful [sic] Eight,” making a play on some of Tarantino’s most famous titles.\n\nAccording to Parade, Jennings has previously competed on other game shows, including Name That Tune and The Celebrity Dating Game since retiring from his seven-season run in the NFL. However, nothing could match this Celebrity Wheel of Fortune appearance that scored him viral status.\n\nCelebrity Wheel of Fortune airs on Wednesday nights at 9/8c on ABC."
