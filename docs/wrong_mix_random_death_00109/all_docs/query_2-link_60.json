        "text": "1966\n\nCity Locations\n\nMadrid (Spain), Lazio (Italy)\n\nLocation Types\n\nNature, Film Studio, Riverside\n\nLocation Styles\n\nDated, Southwestern, Ranch Style\n\nAbout Django\n\nIn 1966, Django, a Spaghetti Western, premiered in Italy to critical acclaim. Francis Nero's career skyrocketed after he accepted the lead role in Sergio Corbucciâs highly-acclaimed directional and writing debut. Ãngel Ãlvarez, JosÃ© BÃ³dalo, Loredana Nusciak, and Eduardo Fajardo shared the screen in supporting roles, all adding to its timeless appeal of a captivating cinematic experience.\n\nThe captivating movie tells the story of a former Union soldier traveling with a companion, a prostitute of mixed race, who finds himself entrenched in the middle of an intense feud between Confederate Red Shirts and Mexican revolutionaries. Hoping to capitalize on Sergio Leone's success with A Fistful of Dollars, the Western captured the same spirit and was loosely based on Akira Kurosawaâs Yojimbo.\n\nDjango became renowned for its unparalleled viciousness, making it one of the most violent films ever released. No certificate was given to it in the United Kingdom until 1993 when it received an 18 and above rating. However, a later downgrade occurred in 2004 giving it a 15+ rating.\n\nThanks to its success, Django's become a cult classic across the world. It is widely renowned as one of the greatest Spaghetti Westerns due to Corbucci's direction, Nero's performance, and Luis Bacalov's soundtrack.\n\nRetrospective critics and scholars of Corbucci Westerns have defined Django as the first title of what they called his \"Mud and Blood\" trilogy, including The Great Silence and The Specialists as well. Referenced by more than 30 pretend \"sequels\" between the time of its release and the early â70s, in order to make the most of its success, most of these movies were unofficial and neither Corbucci nor Nero had anything to do with them. In 1987, Corbucci rejoined forces with Nero and the two created Django Strikes Again - a sequel to the original film.\n\nFun Fact: Generally remembered for his small part in Quentin Tarantino's 2012 tribute to Corbucci, Django Unchained, Nero is slated to make an appearance in the same-titled television series. Scheduled to air in 2023, this new show is sure to captivate audiences and stir up nostalgia with its classic flair!\n\nDjango Locations\n\nIn December 1965, the cameras began rolling on Django at Tor Caldara Nature Reserve, Italy. This magical location soon became an integral backdrop for one of cinema's most beloved films. Carlo Simi, who was already quite familiar with Corbucci and Leone's works, reinvented the Elios Film Studios, located on the outskirts of Rome, for filming most interior and exterior shots.\n\nCorbucci was initially not pleased with the muddy street when he had wanted to film in a snowy environment, however, that changed after persuasion from Bolognini and Nori Corbucci. For additional financial support, Tescia, a Spanish production company, was contacted during filming pauses so they could revise the script.\n\nAfter production resumed, select exterior scenes were filmed in the nearby towns of La Pedriza of Manzanares el Real and Colmenar Viejo, which are located just outside Madrid. As filming was about to wrap, Django and Jackson's men engaged in a thrilling shoot-out captured at Canalone di Tolfa near Rome. This scene was filmed just before production concluded in late February 1966.\n\nUnlike other Spaghetti Westerns that were typically shot in a 2.39:1 Techniscope and printed using Technicolor, Django employed European widescreen (1.66:1) format for filming and Eastmancolor printing technology to produce its vibrant visuals.\n\nAt the MexicoâUnited States border, Django (Franco Nero) is seen in his Union uniform dragging a coffin. He happened to witness Mexican bandits tying MarÃ­a (Loredana Nusciak), a prostitute, to a bridge, and in the process of whipping her. Major Jackson (Eduardo Fajardo), an ex-Confederate officer with a deep prejudice for minorities, is about to carry out their heinous plan of crucifying MarÃ­a on a burning cross.\n\nDjango bravely steps in, shoots them all, and after rescuing MarÃ­a, he offers her protection. He takes her with him to a town, where they come across Nathaniel (Ãngel Ãlvarez), a bartender, alongside five prostitutes. Nathaniel explains that the town serves as a neutral zone between Major Jackson's (Eduardo Fajardo) Red Shirts and General Hugo RodrÃ­guez's (JosÃ© BÃ³dalo) revolutionaries.\n\nPrimary filming took place at TorCaldara Park, a nature reserve situated near the Lavinio seaside town in Anzio, Italy. The Reserve is popular for its exceptional beauty, blending together the sea and mountains. In 1988, it was declared a protected area at the European level due to its biodiversity. It is filled with uncommon vegetation along with different species of fauna; the standout places being Torre delle Caldane and the sulfur mines.\n\nTor Caldara Nature Reserve is located in Lazio, Italy, about 40 km from Rome. To get there, take the A90 motorway south out of Rome for about 30 kilometers and then take exit 7 to Anguillara Sabazia. Follow the signs for Tor Caldara and you will arrive at the entrance to the reserve.\n\nJackson Fajardo) and his accomplices arrive at the saloon to threaten Nathaniel (Ãlvarez). Django (Nero) steps in when two of them try to harass a prostitute and mock Jackson's beliefs. He then shoots the men and defies Jackson to bring back his henchmen. After that, he seduces MarÃ­a (Nusciak).\n\nThe Titanus Elios Center, owned by Titanus Elios (jointly controlled by 70% Titanus and 30% Reti Televisive Italiane), is a television production studio located in Rome. It is one of the four main Mediaset production centers (along with Cologno Monzese, Technology Operative Center, and Safa Palatino Centre). This impressive facility is situated in Settecamini, a suburb of Rome located at Via Tiburtina 1361.\n\nVia Tiburtina, 1361, 00131 Roma RM, Italy can be reached by car or public transportation. By car, take the A90 Rome-Naples highway and exit at Torre Angela. Follow the directions to Via Tiburtina toward Rome and the destination will be on the left side of the street.\n\nBy public transportation, take Metro B towards Rebibbia station and get off at Tiburtina station. From there, follow Via Tiburtina until you reach number 1361 on your right side. Alternatively, consider taking a bus from Termini Station; buses 41/77/88 stop near the address.\n\nDisguised as a provider of prostitutes for the soldiers, Nathaniel (Ãlvarez) drives a horse-cart housing Django (Nero), Hugo (Canalejas), and four revolutionaries. Two of the revolutionaries are Miguel (SimÃ³n Arriaga) and Ricardo (Remo De Angelis), and Nathanielâs cart leads them into the fort, allowing them to gun down many of the soldiers.\n\nAs they progress, Miguel brandishes Django's machine gun while Django, Hugo, and Ricardo battle their way to the gold. As Django and his men escape with the loot, Jackson (Fajardo) gives chase but is forced to stop when they reach American territory. When Django asks for his share of the gold, Hugo, set on using it to fund his rebellion against the Mexican Government, promises to pay him if he succeedsl.\n\nAfter filming in his native Italy, Corbucci traveled to Colmenar Viejo for Django's second outdoor location. Several key scenes were shot there, but it is also an amazing tourist destination. You can visit Ermita de Remedios (the town's patron saint), the Basilica de Nuestra SeÃ±ora de la AsunciÃ³n, and Visigothic archaeological tombs.\n\nThere are plenty of festivities that tourists can take part in when visiting Colmenar Viejo. Some of the biggest events include the Fiesta de la Maya, the Fiesta de la Vaquilla, and a celebration held in honor of the town's patron saint, the Virgen of Remedios, which happens on the last weekend of August. The locals also honor the late Ferdinand II, King of Aragon, by celebrating the Day of Colmenar Viejo.\n\nBy car, take the A6 highway from Madrid to Segovia and then follow the M505 road until you reach Colmenar Viejo. Alternatively, take the Autovia del Henares (A2) and turn on the Pozuelo-Colmenar Viejo exit number 10.\n\nBy public transportation, take Metro Line 8 towards Colmenar Viejo and get off at Nueva EspaÃ±a station. From there, hop onto bus 719 or 751 which should take you directly to Colmenar Viejo's city center in just under an hour.\n\nJackson (Fajardo) discovers Django (Nero) waiting for him at the Tombstone Cemetery and kills Nathaniel (Ãlvarez). Resting himself on the back of Zaro's cross, Django removes his revolver's trigger guard with his teeth just as Jackson's gang arrives.\n\nAssuming Django was attempting to offer a prayer, but unable to make the sign of the cross due to his crippled hands, Jackson scornfully fires shots at all four corners of Zaro's cross. Django retaliates by pushing the trigger of his gun against the cross, taking out Jackson and his men. Placing his pistol on Zaro's cross, Django limps out of the cemetery.\n\nLa Pedriza was the filming location site of Django's final outdoor scene. It is a geological formation situated on the southern side of the Guadarrama mountain range. To reach La Pedriza, you must go through Manzanares el Real, a borough in northwest Madrid.\n\nResidents say it is an ideal place to hike over weekends. Madrid's beautiful landscape was the cinematic backdrop for Anthony Mann's 1964 classic, The Fall Of Roman Empire, and Arnold Schwarzeneggerâs 1982 blockbuster Conan The Barbarian.\n\nLa Pedriza is accessible by car or public transportation. By car, take the A6 highway from Madrid to Segovia and then follow the M505 road until you reach Manzanares el Real. From there, take the M601 (also known as âLa Pedrizaâ) towards La Pedriza's town of El Boalo.\n\nBy public transportation, take Metro Line 8 towards Colmenar Viejo and get off at Manzanares el Real station. From there, hop onto bus 527 which will bring you directly to La Pedriza in about 30 minutes."
