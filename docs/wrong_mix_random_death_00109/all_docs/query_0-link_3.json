        "text": "Who's your biggest fan?\n\nI think right now I would have to say Shane Walker, a fan from Rhode Island. He is always sharing our content on social media, has supported us by purchasing merchandise, and is traveling to Wisconsin this year for a convention we're presenting at. Aside from Shane, I have a small group of friends who are all very supportive of what we do and it makes doing this a lot easier.\n\nWhat brings you inspiration the most?\n\nDark, spooky buildings that look abandoned. Aside from the paranormal aspect, I love filming in these locations because of the vibe.\n\nWhich actor or director would you like to work with?\n\nBecause I focus on documentaries, one actor that I would love to work with is Josh Gates. His Travel Channel series are always very well done and I believe I could learn a lot from his experience.\n\nHave you ever seen a film that was better than the book?\n\nThe short answers is no, most films lose a lot of context when being adapted from a book because you lose what the narrator brings to the story. Also, sometimes the content of the book is too much to fit into a single film and things have to be cut. But cutting things from the story, even if it's something minor, could have a domino effect on something later in the story.\n\nWhat's the movie that taught you the most?\n\nSince I mostly focus on documentaries, I don't have a movie that has taught me the most. If I had to choose a documentary that has taught me the most, it would be Zak Bagans' \"Demon House\" on Discovery. His use of b-roll and sound design made me really analyze how I use b-roll and sound in my own works. I hope to one day produce on the same level as him.\n\nAbout your artistic career, have you ever had the desire to quit everything?\n\nProbably once a month. I tend to take on more work than what I should, which is evident by the three documentaries floating around in different stages. Sometimes trying to do pre-production, production, and post-production mostly by yourself can be a lot to put on your shoulders and makes you want to walk away. But, when the project is done and people respond to the work I've done, it always makes me glad that I pushed a little bit harder to finish it up. Though, once these three documentaries are done I plan to take a little break and focus on one project at a time.\n\nOn set what excites you the most?\n\nLighting. I love how the look comes together due to lighting and seeing our interview subject lit up really gets me excited for the day.\n\nDo you have a Muse or a Role Model?\n\nThere are many directors whom I admire such as Chris Nolan, Steven Soderbergh and the Coen Brothers but I think the main one who really stands out for me is Steven Spielberg.\n\nWho's your biggest fan?\n\nIt used to be my mum before she passed away but now I think my wife Jo has taken over her mantle.\n\nWhat brings you inspiration the most?\n\nI grew up in Wales and I think the rugged landscapes and weather gave me a subconscious appreciation for nature and landscape. My grandmother used to live in a small mining village in South Wales and there used to be trains shunting wagons of coal right outside her house as well as cable cars running up the mountain opposite. I found these dramatic yet ultimately bleak industrial environments sat within such dramatic landscapes truly fascinating. I think growing up in these environments has led to an inner sense of melancholy and emotion that seems to seep into my work. I also love listening to and observing people, I think you can learn a lot by just sitting and watching.\n\nWhich actor or director would you like to work with?\n\nI love working with actors and I have been lucky to have worked with some brilliant actors including the Oscar winner Jeremy Irons, Maxine Peake, Charles Dance and Jason Isaacs. I’d love to work with Olivia Colman - as she makes everything feel effortless yet utterly captivating, the camera seems to love her, she is just incredible. Also Anthony Hopkins is another actor I really admire and would love to work with, I really like his sense of playfulness and I’m sure he’s got some amazing stories to tell.\n\nHave you ever seen a film that was better than the book?\n\nYes, Jaws.\n\nWhat's the movie that taught you the most?\n\nWhen I’m in a tricky situation on set or when a project is going wrong and I’m under pressure I always say to myself “Steven Spielberg faced being sacked every single day when he was making Jaws”. Somehow this brings me some comfort.\n\nAbout your artistic career, have you ever had the desire to quit everything?\n\nNot really, no. I have experienced some difficult situations and working in the creative industry means you face many setbacks but you have to possess a resilience, an inner drive to push forward. It’s important to keep moving forward and challenge yourself.\n\nOn set what excites you the most?\n\nI love working with actors - watching them breathe life into a character who up until that point has only existed on a page is just incredible. When I worked with Jeremy Irons on my short film “I Wish for You” he had to read a letter that his character had written to his granddaughter. We recorded the sound in a small garden shed on the location and Jeremy’s reading provided the voiceover that underpinned our film. We started to record the first take and it was absolutely fantastic. We got to the end and I said ‘cut’. I turned to Sam the sound man and asked him how long the take was and he said “it’s just over five minutes”. Jeremy asked how long I wanted it to be and I said “three minutes” so he went through it all in his head then said “OK let’s go again”. The second take was even better, it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end as I sat listening to Jeremy. When he finished I held my breath as I turned to Sam who said “Three minutes and six seconds”! The precision that must have taken from Jeremy is just mind-bending.\n\nWhen did you decide you wanted to be an actor/director/ screenplayer?\n\nMovies have been my drug since the summer of 1990, when, at 5 years old, I was struck with awesome wonder by “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and “Dick Tracy”. From that age, storytelling became my way of reproducing the magic that unfolded before my eyes while sitting in the theater. At such a young age, you can imagine, I had little say in the stories I was exposed to and no access to film equipment. I was forced by circumstance, then, to work around my limitations. I taught myself to read by sounding out the words in “The Sea Wolf” by Jack London and forced myself to mull over its characters’ existential arguments until I thought I’d achieved the best understanding of the contents and context that I could. After that, there were no other books in arm’s reach, so I’d read the titles on their spines and imagine what the stories might be. I took to writing like a fish to water and tried my hand as a novelist, but as the older I grew, the more, fresh exciting ideas filled my head, and the time I had to explore them dwindled in equal measure. A couple years ago, it dawned on me that screenplays are a fraction the size of novels, and I was always more interested in the cinema, anyway, so I pivoted. I wrote my next venture as a screenplay. It took me two years, instead of ten. Not only that, but throughout the process, I could feel a sense of that same awesome wonder I’d experienced as a kid.\n\nHow did your family react?\n\nMy immediate family has never taken me or my interests seriously. Growing up, they neither understood me nor made any attempt to understand me, my drive, or my dreams. There was nothing particularly strange about me that’d warrant the mental, emotion, and physical backlash I incurred at their hands. The only difference between them and me was that I was curious and welcoming to those who were different from me and whose differences expanded my worldview, whereas my parents and siblings would ridicule and berate me, openly. My parents would even punish me for it. To their credit, my family has adapted with the times, and they’re less concerned by differences which have no effect on their own lives. Ironically, it was my family’s actions in their attempts to force my conformity which hastened my escape into a passion for storytelling and emboldened my stubborn rebuke of exclusionary notions and communities.\n\nDo you have a Muse or a Role Model?\n\nMy role model is an artist named Julie Purdum. She’s a highly-regarded painter who’s seen some success. She’s also my aunt, for whom I am eternally grateful. She’s lived with severe rheumatoid arthritis her entire adult life. In her twenties, she was told she’d never be able to use her hands again. In response, she underwent invasive surgery to fuse her bones to hold a paintbrush. That’s only the tip of the iceberg of her life story. I hope to write a screenplay about it someday.\n\nWho's your biggest fan?\n\nMy wife, a successful creative in her own right, is my champion, always. But, as her quality of life is inexorably tied to mine, she’s also something of a realist. Rightly so. I have, though, a core group of friends, mostly in creative fields, who are not so reliant on my ability to produce half a monthly household income, and they are blindly in my corner.\n\nWhat brings you inspiration the most?\n\nMovie trailers and book titles. I’m still inspired by titles of books I’ve never read. I also watch well-crafted trailers that misrepresent the movies they’re promoting. I like to dream up the story of the movie that’s promised. Teasers are the best for this.\n\nWhich actor or director would you like to work with?\n\nRobert Rodriguez directing David Harbour in a film produced by Christopher McQuarrie.\n\nHave you ever seen a film that was better than the book?\n\nI think, “To Kill A Mockingbird,” while it stayed very close to its source material, made small changes that heightened immediacy, quickened the pace, and added even greater weight to the ending. That’s expert craftsmanship on the part of either the screenwriter, Horton Foote, or perhaps more likely, the editor, Aaron Stell, as, really, only one scene was left out of the book. The rest was a matter of arrangement.\n\nWhat's the movie that taught you the most?\n\n“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” taught me how to respect an audience and the source material at the same time. “Dark City” taught me pacing, “Desperado” taught me to treat a gun in cinema like a musical instrument and a gunfight like a dance. Everything else, I learned from Sergio Leone.\n\nAbout your artistic career, have you ever had the desire to quit everything?\n\nEvery day. I believe very much that nothing I write will ever be produced. I live in constant fear of the day that I look back on my life and think about all the time that I’d wasted focusing on a passion - an obsession, really - that took me nowhere. I’ll be stuck on an image in my head, of my wife waking up every morning, alone, in a cold bed. Possibly, she’d be wondering why I’m not there, but I know that I will, because I already do. When I was younger, I had the foresight to know that, if I ever fell in love, I’d want to give up my creative endeavor in favor of happiness. To combat that, before finding the love of my life, I arranged my whole existence around writing and, to a lesser degree, acting. Now, I’m trapped. Just as I’d planned.\n\nOn set, what excites you the most?\n\nThe opportunity to collaborate. I feel very connected to my work and, certainly, I’d love to see it play out on the big screen just as it’s written. But for that to be my overarching goal is too selfish, alienating, and, frankly, boring. I wrote the script. I already saw that movie as it played out in my head. So, my greater interest is to connect my work with an engaged audience, and the best way to do that is through the collaborative process that’s so unique to filmmaking. The screenplay is a roadmap, and maps have borders. the road does not. It’s a lot more fun to take the trip than it is to draw the map.\n\nAnd what scares you the most?\n\nRegret. I think the fear of regret is mostly what fuels my drive, even in the face of imminent failure. To a lesser degree, I fear having a worthwhile idea or manuscript and having it stolen. As I understand it, there’s minimal risk of such a thing actually happening, but the fear is there, nonetheless.\n\nWho's your biggest fan?\n\nProbaly my dog Luna. But that's because I give her food and play with her.\n\nI am not sure if I even have a biggest fan. So far my family is happy with my work but I would not claim, that they are my biggest fans. Maybe with my scripts there will be somebody in the future, who knows.\n\nWhat brings you inspiration the most?\n\nI am most inspired by real life stories. This gives me ideas for my own stories. I am not inspired by fiction books because there is little left for your own ideas. As I am now more into script writing I don't want to adpapt already existing books, but develop and write my own story.\n\nWhich actor or director would you like to work with?\n\nAs I grew up in the 80's with movies my dream director would be of course Steven Spielberg. When I saw his Super 8 Films when he was a kid that remember me how I started making films.\n\nHave you ever seen a film that was better than the book?\n\nI think that the Harry Potter movies were better than the books. The casting was so good that they really did a better job.\n\nWhat's the movie that taught you the most?\n\nThis is a difficult question. I would say that Duel from Spielberg had a great influence on my work. This film is so well done and the story is very simple but also very interesting. This is the kind of movie I would like to do.\n\nAbout your artistic career, have you ever had the desire to quit everything?\n\nNo never. Because I have also a regular job I keep loving my artistic career very much.\n\nOn set what excites you the most?\n\nThe work with the actors. To be in an ongoing dialogue with them on how to shoot the perfect scene. Only at that moment you realize how good your script is and whether it really works on set. The script becomes alive with real people and your job as a director is to facilitate this transformation from written words to real life acting. This process is unique and also challenging. But if you succeed and the scene was perfect then this excites me the most.\n\nAnd what scares you the most ?\n\nThat a scene from the script does not work when shooting. At this moment it is very difficult to make any changes because this would affect the whole film. So this really scares me but fortuntaley this does not happen very often. If it's happening then the best thing is to try to make only very small changes to the script and hoping that it will work. If you have a good actor he or she can save the script by doing small changes in acting.\n\nWho's your biggest fan?\n\nI have a very big fan in Germany. He has seen all my films and is always avidly and highly enthusiastically praising them.\n\nWhat brings you inspiration the most?\n\nRelationships and hardships of people. It can be something I hear about or people I know who go through tough or trying times -- there are a lot of stories in those lives. Aspirational stories about the loner, the underdog, the outsider who fights for survival - physical or spiritual, and sometimes both - in an inspired cinematic world, always had a particularly strong grip in me.\n\nWhich actor or director would you like to work with?\n\nTimothee Chalamet. He is a very courageous actor and has great versatility. And he has a strong, while often understated, screen presence matched with a strong degree of detail in his acting. I think he is an acting genius. I see him as a kind of a young Al Pacino, although with a complete style of his own.\n\nHave you ever seen a film that was better than the book?\n\nThat's a good one. I can't actually think of one off the top of my head, but there is a Danish movie from 2004 called KING'S GAME which is a very accomplished political thriller that in many ways set a new standard, one that hasn't really been met since, for Danish political thrillers. It is based on a book that I haven't read but I'm pretty sure that the film is better than the book. I also think some of Scorsese's movies like GOODFELLAS and CASINO could potentially be better than the books upon which they are based. But again, in fairness, I haven't read those books.\n\nWhat's the movie that taught you the most?\n\nI have learned so many different things from so many different movies. In some cases you learn about what actors can do if well directed. In other cases you learn about writing dialogue. And some movies teach and inspire you to understand story structure better and how to challenge and test the concept of time and timelines in storytelling. But the aforementioned experience of watching TERMINATOR 2 is probably the one film that brought most of this together: A blockbuster action-thriller with perfect visual storytelling, cutting-edge CGI, great performances, a storyline where time is bend and played with, all done to tell a story about the power of love and the father-son relationship. It touched me personally on the deepest level since it was the movie that made me realize the truth about my sexuality after falling in love with Edward Furlong.\n\nAbout your artistic career, have you ever had the desire to quit everything?\n\nNo. It's a tough business and the road is long and you'll run into hundreds of dead ends and disappointments -- but I always knew that it would be that way. But I have had small successes along the way and worked with really talented, smart and accomplished people in front of and behind the camera in both Denmark and the U.S., and all that has kept me going, and still does. I still find new ideas and stories that I want to explore and I have a lot of movies that I want to make.\n\nOn set what excites you the most?\n\nI am actually the type of director who loves to be on set. One of the things that always fascinated me the most about filmmaking is the machinery and all the moving parts, and of course what you can do with it. Spending time, and getting really close, with the actors and the DP is extremely exciting and enjoyable for me. Being on set is the only time during the entire process of making a movie where most of the creative people are together in one place and that creates a really amazing, high-energy environment where ideas flow. It is also extremely hands-on and due to the time pressure decision making has an immediacy that is both scary and a lot of fun. On set is also where all the hard work that came before to make a movie, for the first time, becomes something that looks and feels like a movie -- that moment when you do the first take of the first setup and the actors make everything come alive for the first time, is a soul-stirring moment.\n\nWhich is the best Moment on set?\n\nThere are so many. The best moment for me is kind of an oxymoron because I enjoy shooting so much and never want it to end – but it’s probably when filming’s wrapped, everyone applauds and gives each other a hug – that’s the best feeling, because it’s the most gratifying – everyone’s worked so hard and you really feel that sense of accomplishment and love for those around you, that family you’ve spent a week, a month, a year working with feeling so happy that you’ve accomplished the really difficult task of making a movie you’re all so passionate about with.\n\nDid anyone ever tell you weren't good enough?\n\nYeah, loads of times and I thank them every day for it. Harsh criticism makes you thick-skinned, which is something you need not just as a filmmaker, but in life in general. Without being thick-skinned, how can you have those difficult conversations with all the people who don’t agree with you or the hateful people in the world today that try to cancel you and ruin your life for saying something they didn’t personally like? You have to power through without letting it get you down. When me and my composer Hayden made a comedy web series about eleven years ago, the ratio of comments was significantly more negative than positive. People told us to give up pretty much on the daily and we never, ever did. Now the movies we work on together are internationally award-winning. Without the harsh critics, I genuinely don’t think I would have had the drive to prove to people what I’m capable of behind a camera. So, I really am thankful for being told day in, day out that I wasn’t good enough, because all it really told me eventually, is that I was.\n\nHow can you stay focused on your goal?\n\nWhen so determined to meet a goal, that becomes the focus of my life until it’s achieved. I believe that if you fail to stay focused on a goal you’ve told yourself you have, then you’re not really that ambitious about it. If you’re not prepared to put in the work to achieve the goal, you don’t really want it. So, passion and determination is what drives me to complete the goal. The Village 3 took about a year to make from writing to release and, for that year, making that movie was my goal.\n\nHave you ever had a breakdown because of your Job?\n\nA breakdown, no, but I have found myself questioning if I’m going in the right direction a few times. The industry can be very competitive and you feel that taking a toll on you as you try to push your way into it. You wonder whether or not it’s everything you thought it was going to be, so I had a bit of an identity crisis when I was in university. Ultimately, I discovered that I was indeed exactly where I belonged in the film industry after I began a teacher training course and dropped out because I realised early on it was absolutely not for me. I lacked the drive I thought I had when I was accepted onto the course - something just did not feel right about it from the very start. And because of my life being consumed by that, I realised what was missing: filmmaking. So, I left and went back to filmmaking and re-discovered my passion; I do not regret that decision at all – sometimes you just need to experience something like that to really be sure of yourself. I still enjoy teaching, I run a weekly filmmaking class for young people called the Prop Box Filmmakers Academy, an off-shoot of Prop Box Youth Theatre through which I directed the first two Village films and I’m forever grateful to Caroline and Sarah and the great students at the class for giving me the opportunity to do so. However, unlike teaching in a school, it’s a very comfortable environment where I can teach my own syllabus and it doesn’t require practically giving up a social life and personal projects to pursue. So, that’s probably the closest I’ve come to a breakdown because of my job.\n\nTalent is a blessing or a curse?\n\nIt’s a blessing. It could only be a curse if you use it the wrong way like the many famous people who unfortunately find themselves going down a self-destructive path for various reasons – maybe the wealth and being able to afford dangerous and addictive substances or just the stress of being in the public eye. But no, I think it’s absolutely a blessing being able to release something from your brain and grab other people’s attention because of it – that’s not something everybody can say they’re able to do.\n\nWhat would you like to improve about yourself as a director/actor/screenplayer?\n\nSometimes us directors fall into the trap of getting so wrapped up in capturing the perfect shot for a scene that we lose track of time. My shoots have never had the benefit of having loads of time. The first Village was shot in two days, the second in three days and third had four days (although Village 3 was the only one without consecutive shoot days), so there have been times where I’ve spent too long on a particular scene or shot and that means not having as much time to spend on other scenes, so, although most of the time we’re good with the time-keeping I’d rather know for sure we’ve left enough time to get it all done.\n\nAs for writing, and I tried to do exactly this with The Village 3 since I felt it was lacking somewhat in the first two films, is create more in-depth characters. The Village 3 had a smaller cast which allowed room for the characters to grow more before we got to the carnage. All the films in the franchise are slasher horrors with elements of drama, but the first two focused a bit more on the splatter violence and less on the drama, but the new one swaps that around, which has been quite positively received. So, I think in future screenplays, I’ll stay focused on character development with smaller casts.\n\nAs for acting, I feel I’m more of a writer-director than an actor – I’m really in the new film because we struggled to find the right actor for Officer Redfield and having written probably the most complex character in the franchise, I knew how I wanted him to behave and new it’d be fun, so I took on the role myself, but never really intended to when writing it. I think if I act again, I’ll have to get better at learning my lines, because there was a fair few times during editing, I was getting frustrated with myself because there was a great take and then I’d have to stop to remember my lines halfway through and ruin it.\n\nWhat's the worst critic you have received?\n\nThey say you are your own worst critic. I have a habit of saying that looks awful or something to that effect whenever anything looks slightly off. It doesn’t help that I edit most of my own stuff, so I kick myself when I see something not quite right and I didn’t think to do it a different way on set. Actually, I suppose it does help because I know for next time. Of course, we have plenty of banter on set, none of which any of us take to heart – I think it was Charlie, one of the sound recordists and cinematographers on the set of The Village 3 that told me my policeman’s outfit made me look like a stripper, so if you haven’t watched the film yet or next time you do, try not to think about that. We all laughed our heads off, we have a great time on set, but in all seriousness, I think my worst critics except myself were the aforementioned people that told me and Hayden our web series we made at like eleven to fourteen years old was awful – there really were some scathing remarks that are far too sweary to repeat here, but as I said, I actually look at it in a positive light – not that I particularly encourage it, I think constructive criticism is a much nicer way to give feedback, but those who scream obscenities about your work and tell you to kill yourself will always be around – this is the age of the internet and hiding behind computer screens, you might as well just embrace it.\n\nIf you weren't an actor/director/screenplayer what would you like to be?\n\nIt’s all I’ve ever wanted to be really, so that’s a particularly tough question. I don’t have any skills in it really, but a record producer or DJ sounds fun. I love a concert, so being able to perform and having my art out there in a different format would be awesome. As a gamer, I often find myself thinking ‘how would I have done this’ when playing, so being a game designer or a play tester would be up my ally too.\n\nIf Cinema was a color what would it be?\n\nA rainbow. It’s such a diverse medium that it couldn’t be condensed down to one colour. I guess white since that is the shade we get when lots of colours are mixed together. If red represents horror, purple is romance, etc. the mixture into cinema as a whole would be white.\n\nA day without a movie is...\n\nA day when I’ve been very busy. For me, I never really have a day without a movie even when I haven’t physically watched one since I’m always thinking about movies, both existent and non-existent. I see my life as a movie and occasionally, something in that movie of my life I’ll pick to make a physical movie out of. I never stop looking for inspiration.\n\nIf someone offered you to play/direct/write in/a movie that you despise\n\nbut that for sure will make you rich and famous...would you accept the job?\n\nIf I truly believed the movie was hopeless then no. If I’m not loving the process or what we’re working towards, we’re not doing it right, so something needs to change. However, someone clearly truly believes that this movie can work if it will make us rich and if they were open to compromise and changing the film into something I did like, then I would consider it. If we were to work together to create something that everyone, creators and audience will love from a bad first draft I probably would. I really believe in salvaging things even if the final product bears little to no resemblance to the final product.\n\nWhat's your greatest ambition?\n\nMy greatest ambition is to be the director of at least one widely released theatrical film – a horror film perhaps, but not necessarily. That will be when I know I have officially achieved my dream. Maybe one day someone could come along and help us with funding a feature-length adaptation of The Village franchise...\n\nWhat's your biggest fear?\n\nMy biggest fear is failure. If I fail, I have faltered somewhere along the lines of my set rules to never give up until I achieve the intended goal. That fear is what drives me to always create the best film possible and never give up.\n\nDoes music helps you to play/direct, write?\n\nDepends what I’m writing. If it’s horror, I might put on a film or game soundtrack in the background like Akira Yamaoka’s Silent Hill soundtracks. It’s such a diverse sound – some tracks are creepy, others are more emotional. If I’m writing characters, I’ll put on the emotional stuff, if it’s a scary scene, something more tense. If I’m writing a drama, I might listen to silence or if I need emotional inspiration, I might put on a song or album that matches the emotion – I like Lana Del Rey’s music, that’s definitely been on in the background of the writing process a few times. If it’s a comedy, I might put on some silly club music or even just a YouTube video or documentary for some background noise and when I take a ten second break to actually listen to what the TV or music’s saying, I might suddenly find some inspiration right there.\n\nActing and directing, sometimes – music doesn’t help so much with my directing style, but can create images in my head of what I want when it comes to creating a set, a shot or atmosphere. With acting, sometimes I do discover the emotion I need through listening to a particular song or piece of music, but I tend to take inspiration from other TV shows and films more so than music for acting and directing – writing, music does very often help though.\n\nYou have the chance to make a Silent movie, what's your message to the\n\naudience?\n\nI have made a few silent movies in my time – in fact my favourite film I ever made is called ‘Divided’, which is a silent movie. The film’s about an emotionally abusive relationship where we see what’s happening in the real world and then symbolic shots of how the protagonist is feeling. The deeper we get into the subconscious, the more elaborate and disturbing the imagery and sound gets. If I was to make another silent film, I think I’d go in a similar art house direction using non-dialogue symbolism to show how a character’s feeling. My message would be communicating how a character or maybe even real person feels in that moment which I think can often be more powerful that a film grounded in reality. Without saying too much, there’s an art house script I wrote years ago that I’m confident will make it to the screen one day that uses silent sequences to depict modern anxieties that I really want to make – it’s probably my favourite script I’ve ever written.\n\nShare your speech if you should win an Oscar.....\n\nThis is not just my Oscar. This is also everyone who’s ever helped me get to where I am today’s Oscar, because I couldn’t have done it without you. Caroline, Sarah and the students of Prop Box without the support of whom, I never would have won my first awards – not loads of people will trust you when you say you want to make a movie with a youth club that involves loads of blood, but my has it paid off? My crew – Charlie Lubbock and Hayden Davey, for putting up with my extremely demanding shooting days and the amount of energy drinks you had to consume to manage it. Anybody who I’ve ever roped into being in one of my films – you cover yourself in mud and blood and do an amazing job all for my dream without any fuss at all – Patch, I hope you’ve managed to get all the stains out of your trousers by now. And of course, my family – this Oscar is for you. Mum and dad, I’ve never doubted your belief in me and your constructive criticism has helped me improve upon every film, no matter how little. Thank you all of you."
