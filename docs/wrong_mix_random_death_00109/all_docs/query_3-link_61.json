        "text": "The Justified revival just got that much more exciting for fans with talk that Quentin Tarantino may sign on to direct episodes, Evil’s Mike Colter and Katja Herbers are among those nominated for top Critics Choice Super Choice awards, and Showtime unleashes the stars of The First Lady. Plus, new trailers and more of the biggest news in TV and streaming this week.\n\nTOP STORY\n\nQuentin Tarantino May Direct Timothy Olyphant’s Return to FX in the Elmore Leonard Limited Series Justified: City Primeval\n\n(Photo by Rocco Spaziani/Archivio Spaziani/Mondadori Portfolio via Getty Images; Prashant Gupta / © FX Network / Courtesy: Everett Collection)\n\nIt just keeps getting better: not only is one of FX’s all-time greatest dramas returning to the network soon, but the limited series return of Justified: City Primeval may now included episodes directed by Quentin Tarantino.\n\nDeadline reports the Oscar winner is in early talks to direct one or two episodes in the series that brings Timothy Olyphant back to his signature role as badass U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens. Olyphant worked with Tarantino on his most recent film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and Tarantino is famously an Elmore Leonard fan (his Jackie Brown was an adaptation of Leonard’s novel Rum Punch).\n\nThe Justified limited series is an adaption of another Leonard novel, 1980’s City Primeval: High Noon, which will send the now Miami-based Givens to Detroit where he, of course, tangles with some baddies.\n\nTCA Winter 2022: Viola Davis Very Concerned About What Michelle Obama Will Think About Her Portrayal of the First Lady in Showtime’s Anthology Series The First Lady\n\nYep, even Oscar winner Viola Davis gets nervous about her performances — especially when she’s portraying a real-life “character,” and especially when that real-life character is iconic former First Lady Michelle Obama.\n\n“It keeps you up at night,” Davis said during Showtime’s virtual Television Critics Association session this week. Obama is one of three First Ladies who will be featured in the first season of the anthology series – along with Eleanor Roosevelt (played by Gillian Anderson) and Betty Ford (played by Michelle Pfeiffer) – but Davis is the only series star portraying a living subject, upping the pressure knowing her subject might see her performance.\n\n“You don’t want to insult them by your portrayal,” Davis said. “And here’s the thing … It’s a famous quote – I think it’s Thoreau who says, ‘To be known is to be misunderstood.’ As much as we feel like we know Michelle Obama, and I did everything I possibly could to research, I mean everything, but still, in those private moments, there is some level of … creative decision‑making that you have to take. I don’t know how she lays in bed with Barack. I don’t know how she would discipline her children. There’s just small minutiae that I can take creative license with and hope that I’m not insulting her with it, and that’s what you have to navigate as an artist.\n\n“It’s something I always say even to my husband; ‘Listen, if someone were to do a bio of my life 70 years from now, and they spoke to everyone that possibly came into contact with me, you’d only know 40 percent of me.’ So, yes, a huge amount of fear, huge, but that’s what we live for as artists. It’s a huge exercise in letting go, and it’s a huge exercise in transformation, yeah, but to answer your question: terrifying.”\n\nIn other Showtime TCA news:\n\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt, who’s playing a real-life character – former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick – in Showtime’s anthology series Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber, has also thought about what his subject might think about his portrayal of him, and even what might happen if he crossed paths with Kalanick in real life. He’s not worried about what the reaction might be he said during the Super Pumped TCA session.\n\n“I was really intent on not reducing Travis to his headlines,” Gordon-Levitt said. “I really wanted to show a whole and multifaceted human being. I actually think, I hope, he’ll actually like it a lot. I think it’s probably a lot more flattering a portrayal than a lot of the press around him, because the press doesn’t focus on him as a whole human being … the press more focuses on the particular decisions that he made and actions that he took as the leader of this company because that’s really more the place of journalism and nonfiction, whereas the place of a dramatization is to dive into the humanity of him. I would hope that he finds it refreshing to have a big piece about him that really does dive into him as a whole human.”.\n\nEvil and Midnight Mass Lead Critics Choice Super Awards Nominations\n\n(Photo by Elizabeth Fisher/CBS)\n\nThe Critics Choice Association announced the television nominees for its second annual Super Choice Awards, honoring the most popular, fan-obsessed genres, including Superhero, Science Fiction/Fantasy, Horror, and Action.
