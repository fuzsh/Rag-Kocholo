Tarantino is one of the most influential directors of our generation: a winner of two academy awards, who’s been praised for his original style, pop culture, and pushing the envelope for films to come.\n\nBorn on March 27, 1963, Tarantino instantly became fascinated by films, after moving to California. While he was in high school, Tarantino worked at a Manhattan Beach video store called, Video Archives. “[In 1985] the owner wanted to ask me if I wanted to have a job there. He didn’t realize he was saving my life.” Tarantino said. Enjoying his three years working at the store, his passion for …show more content…\n\nNormally the lines spoken in a scene have nothing to do with what’s happening in the scene, but are quick, snappy, and most of all, cool. Music is also a special trademark, where songs, especially pop culture songs, are placed in a scene for a specific mood. In Pulp Fiction, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) dances with Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) in one scene. Because she seems a tad suspicious, the song, “You Never Can Tell” plays. Sometimes the music and songs don’t even match with the time period the movie’s set in. Such as a scene in Django Unchained: It’s set in the South at the time of slavery, but in one scene, a rap song is played.

He notes how well Melville could take 30’s gangster films, and do them in his own way. Genre reconstruction is something Tarantino does often, like in his personal masterpiece, Inglourious Basterds, where he takes WWII history, and completely flips it: the story revolving around Nazi-killing Jews. Hong Kong director John Woo had a great influence on Tarantino as well. John Woo is best known for his amazing shootout gunfights and action scenes in his films, creating action films such as Face Off and The Killer, which have been praised as some of the best action films of all time. Woo’s work such as this greatly inspired the violence in Tarantino’s films. The 80’s, Tarantino believes, were a time for horrible action films, but it was John Woo who brought them back.\n\nTarantino says he only wants to make ten movies. As of May 2016, he has directed eight films, (he counts Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2 as one movie, because it was created as one). He wants to leave a legacy of having a 10 film filmography, and has plans on what he wants to do afterwards. “What I want to do, basically, is I want to write novels, and I want to write theater and I want to direct theater.” He hopes to do a stage version of his most recent"
