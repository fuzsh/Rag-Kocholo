        "text": "The gloves are off.\n\nNot that they were really on, but Shannon Lee held nothing back as she fired back at Quentin Tarantino’s defense of how he chose to portray Lee’s father, Bruce, in “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood” by suggesting that the director apologize, or just not say anything.\n\n“He could shut up about it,” Shannon Lee told Variety. “That would be really nice. Or he could apologize or he could say, ‘I don’t really know what Bruce Lee was like. I just wrote it for my movie. But that shouldn’t be taken as how he really was.'”\n\nThat last suggestion makes the most sense considering that Tarantino’s latest offering is a fictional account of Hollywood in 1969, loosely based around the Manson family’s heinous murders of the time. But that’s not Tarantino’s style, so there’s a possibility that this verbal kerfuffle between Tarantino and Lee’s only daughter will continue past three rounds.\n\nYou might remember that Lee didn’t take too kindly to how her father “comes across as an arrogant (expletive) who was full of hot air, and not someone who had to fight triple as hard as any of those people did to accomplish what was naturally given to so many others.”\n\nShannon Lee’s take that Tarantino’s portrayal of her father as ignorant doesn’t seem to be in dispute; Tarantino himself appeared to say that was his intent when he finally responded to Shannon’s criticisms earlier this week during a press junket for the movie in Moscow.\n\n“Bruce Lee was kind of an arrogant guy,” Tarantino said. “The way he was talking, I didn’t just make a lot of that up. I heard him say things like that, to that effect. If people are saying, ‘Well, he never said he could beat up Muhammad Ali.’ Well, yeah, he did. Not only did he say that, but his wife, Linda Lee, said that in her first biography I ever read. She absolutely said that.”\n\nAccording to Variety, Linda Lee Cadwell, who is Shannon’s mother, didn’t actually write that in her book “Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew.” Instead, she quoted a critic as saying, “Those who watched Lee would bet on Lee to render (Ali) senseless.”\n\nShannon Lee, who is the caretaker of her father’s estate and charity foundation, has a problem with Tarantino blurring the lines between fiction and nonfiction.\n\nTarantino “can portray Bruce Lee however he wanted to, and he did. But it’s a little disingenuous for him to say, ‘Well, this is how he was, but this is a fictional movie, so don’t worry too much about it,'” she said.\n\nIn the film, the Lee character, as portrayed by Mike Moh, appears in a flashback scene in which he and Brad Pitt’s stuntman character, Cliff Booth, engage in a best-of-three, mano-a-mano combat on the set of the 1966-67 TV show “Green Hornet.”\n\nLee unleashes a flying kick and easily knocks Booth off his feet in the first round. Booth gains revenge in the next round by slamming Lee against the side of a car, leaving an exaggerated dent. The match was broken up before the deciding round.\n\nTarantino also spoke of the fight scene during the Moscow junket, according to Too Fab.\n\n“Could Cliff beat up Bruce Lee? OK, Brad would not be able to beat up Bruce Lee, but Cliff maybe could,” he said.\n\n“If you ask me the question, ‘OK who would win in a fight: Bruce Lee or Dracula?’ It’s the same question. It’s a fictional character. If I say Cliff can beat Bruce Lee up, he’s a fictional character then he could beat Bruce Lee up.”\n\nIn her original criticism of the film, Shannon Lee said her father, who died of a brain edema in 1973, is again being marginalized because of his Asian background, just as she said he was back in the 1960s. “Once Upon a Time” revolves around the fictional characters of Booth and Leonardo DiCaprio’s Rick Dalton.\n\n“I can understand all the reasoning behind what is portrayed in the movie,” she said. “I understand that the two characters are antiheroes and this is sort of like a rage fantasy of what would happen … and they’re portraying a period of time that clearly had a lot of racism and exclusion.\n\n“I understand they want to make the Brad Pitt character this super bad-ass who could beat up Bruce Lee,” she added. “But they didn’t need to treat him in the way that white Hollywood did when he was alive.”\n\nEnjoyed this story?
