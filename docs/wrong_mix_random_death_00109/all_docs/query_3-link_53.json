        "text": "PARK CITY, UTAH, April 17, 2024 — Today, the nonprofit Sundance Institute announced the opening of a Request for Information (RFI), beginning on April 17 and closing on May 1, followed by a Request for Proposal (RFP) process to explore viable locations in the United States to host the Sundance Film Festival beginning in 2027.\n\nThe Festival, a public program run by the nonprofit, is the pre-eminent gathering of original storytellers and audiences seeking new voices and fresh perspectives and supporting independent film. The Festival had a record number of submissions this year — more than 17,000 from 153 countries — reflecting a continued vitality in the independent film industry and a desire to launch and screen work to the Sundance community. The 2025 and 2026 Festivals will continue in partnership with Park City, Utah, which serves as the headquarters for the Festival, and the state of Utah. The 2025 Sundance Film Festival will occur in Park City and Salt Lake City from January 23 to February 2, 2025.\n\nThe Sundance Film Festival has a rich and treasured 40-year history in both Park City and the state of Utah. Sundance Institute’s connection to Utah is profound, reflecting decades of shared cultural achievements that have shaped the Festival into what it is today.\n\nWith the Festival’s current contract with Park City up for renewal starting in 2027, the RFI/RFP will allow the Institute to evaluate, consider, and build on its foundation for an accessible Festival serving a growing global independent creative community. The Institute is making sure that inclusivity and sustainability are always at the forefront of the festival experience, while preserving the Festival’s key mission and responsibility: discovering and supporting independent storytellers and introducing their work to new audiences.\n\nThe RFI is the first step in a comprehensive selection process designed to gather critical logistical information from potential host locations in the United States before deciding on any future homes for the Festival. This includes Utah, given the Festival’s long-standing relationship.\n\n“We are in a unique moment for our Festival and our global film community, and with the contract up for renewal, this exploration allows us to responsibly consider how we best continue sustainably serving our community while maintaining the essence of the Festival experience,” said Eugene Hernandez, Director, Sundance Film Festival and Public Programming. “We are looking forward to conversations that center supporting artists and serving audiences as part of our mission and work at Sundance Institute, and are motivated by our commitment to ensure that the Festival continues to thrive culturally, operationally, and financially as it has for four decades.”\n\nWith the format of film festivals evolving to reflect the dynamic landscape of independent cinema, the Sundance Film Festival will employ the RFI process to identify new opportunities to elevate artists while providing a space that reflects the Festival’s values of inclusion, racial equity, accessibility and belonging at every level for artists, audiences, staff, and volunteers. Sundance maintains its commitment to upholding a culture of independent creativity, as well as providing a welcoming community that includes a broad base of individuals from different backgrounds and systems of beliefs.\n\nAfter the RFI, Sundance Institute will notify the cities selected to move on to the RFP, where specific details will be assessed.\n\nFounded by Robert Redford to support, sustain, and discover independent filmmakers and storytellers, the Sundance Film Festival has been a foothold for independent filmmaking, serving as an essential space for introducing unique voices while transforming careers. Each January, audiences are the first to discover and celebrate the bold, creative visions and exciting new talent that will be part of the conversation for years to come.\n\n“Park City has been our home for more than 40 years, together with the state of Utah, and Sundance cherishes and respects our history and partnership. We are thrilled with the vitality we see in independent filmmaking and want to assure the continuous discovery and support of independent artists and audiences our Festival is known for,” said Ebs Burnough, Sundance Institute Board Chair. “We look forward to reviewing each proposal and working together with all of our potential collaborators to determine how we can collectively meet the needs of the independent film ecosystem and broader creative community.”\n\nIn participating in this RFI and RFP, respondents are entering into an understanding that outlines the cooperative spirit and responsibilities expected from potential host cities. This includes an acknowledgment that, if selected, the host city’s obligations would extend from 2027 into the future, subject to negotiations and mutual agreements forged with Sundance Institute.\n\nThroughout the RFI process, the Institute will remain focused on completing a fair and comprehensive review of all possible partners and will not provide comments until the next step of the process, which will occur in the summer.\n\nInterested parties can express interest and receive information by emailing proposal@sundance.org, the RFI process will be closing on May 1, 2024.\n\nThe timeline for the process is as follows:\n\n4/17/24 RFI Opens\n\n5/1/24 RFI Phase Closed\n\n5/7/24 RFP Opens\n\n6/21/24 RFP Submissions Closed\n\nQ4 2024 – Q1 2025 Final Location Selection Announced\n\nAbout Sundance Institute As a champion and curator of independent stories, the nonprofit Sundance Institute provides and preserves the space for artists across storytelling media to create and thrive.
