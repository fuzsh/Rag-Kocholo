        "text": "Our survey of classical mythology courses in U.S. post-secondary education traces the presence and use of classical myths in college-level curricula — their scope, functions, and outcomes. Following Kitchell’s (2005) call for more data on mythology courses at U.S. colleges and universities, we collected syllabi for traditional survey courses, special-focus courses, and global mythology courses and assembled them into a database to track overall content and format. Our findings are discussed here, along with some current and emerging trends in twenty-first century mythology classrooms.\n\nSince the beginning of the millennium, more than 500 board, card, and table games about Ancient Greece and Rome have been commercialized in Europe, more than twice the number with respect to the last two decades of the twentieth century. The target audience for these games are normally adolescents and young adults. The choice of Ancient Greece and Rome is in keeping with a general interest in historical or pseudohistorical subjects: games about Ancient Egypt, the Vikings, the Middle ages, and the Orient are also available. Ancient mythology, warfare, politics (in particular of the Roman republic), economy, and the circus races are the themes preferred. Several questions arise with regard to this material: what image of Classical Antiquity is painted here, which sources do game designers and illustrators use for the information and the iconography? In recent games, Antiquity is treated more as science fiction or heroic fantasy than as a component of our historic past. This is reflected in the graphics, less inspired by ancient designs than current comic style. Movies like Ben-Hur (1959) and the more recent television series like Rome (2005) or Spartacus (2010) also influence game production. Consequently, game designers and illustrators use a lot of freedom in the way they represent Antiquity."
