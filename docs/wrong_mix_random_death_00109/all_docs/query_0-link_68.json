        "text": "Actor and musician Jeremy Renner, known for his roles in The Hurt Locker, The Avengers, Captain America, and the Mission Impossible series, will personally accept the KVIFF Festival President’s Award at the Closing Gala on July 8th. Renner will also introduce his new film Wind River, which will screen at the 52nd edition of the festival.\n\nJeremy Renner’s first breakout role was his critically acclaimed portrayal of “Jeffrey Dahmer” in the indie hit Dahmer (2002), for which he was nominated for a Film Independent Spirit Award. Since then, Renner has established himself on the big screen primarily through his roles in action and war movies. His portrayal of self-assured Sergeant James in Kathryn Bigelow’s war drama The Hurt Locker (2008) garnered his first Oscar nomination for Best Actor in addition to nods at the BAFTA, Independent Spirit, SAG, and Gotham Awards. Two years later, The Academy honored Renner again with a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his role alongside Ben Affleck in The Town (2010). He was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Awards for The Town.\n\n“I am thrilled that Jeremy Renner will be accepting an award at this year’s Karlovy Vary festival. Jeremy is an actor with a highly diverse filmography that includes both audience favourites as well as critically acclaimed films. One example is Wind River, which recently won the Prize for Best Direction in the Un Certain Regard competition at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, and which Jeremy Renner will present at Karlovy Vary in person,” says Jiří Bartoška, president of the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival.\n\nRenner’s filmography is extensive and includes numerous big-budget blockbusters such as Thor (2011), Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011), Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (2015), and The Bourne Legacy (2012), where he took over the lead role from Matt Damon in this loose series of adaptations of the book by Robert Ludlum. He portrayed the character of Clint Barton/Hawkeye in the Marvel series Avengers (2012), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) and Captain America: Civil War (2016).\n\nIn 2012, Renner and partner Don Handfield formed The Combine, a production company that is creating, developing and producing high-quality, character-driven content for mainstream audiences. They began with The Throwaways for Crackle and in 2013 they produced, Kill The Messenger, which starred Renner as journalist Gary Webb and was released by Focus Features. The Combine also executive produced the The Founder (2016) starring Michael Keaton for The Weinstein Company.\n\nRenner displays the versatility of a seasoned actor through his performances in David O. Russell’s crime drama American Hustle (2013), which was nominated for 10 Oscars, and in Denis Villeneuve’s mysterious sci-fi Arrival (2016), which won an Oscar and was nominated for several more. Renner’s most recent project, Wind River (2017), is a crime thriller directed by Taylor Sheridan, which screened at this year’s Cannes Film Festival as part of the Un Certain Regard competition. Wind River will screen for audiences this summer at KVIFF.\n\nKARLOVY VARY FESTIVAL TO AWARD UMA THURMAN\n\nThis year the Karlovy Vary IFF will welcome actress and producer Uma Thurman – Golden Globe winner for Hysterical Blindness, Academy Award nominee for Pulp Fiction, and recipient of more than twenty other prestigious festival prizes. Ms. Thurman will accept the Festival President’s Award on the occasion of the gala Opening Ceremony of the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival.\n\nFrom the beginning of her exceptionally rich acting career, Uma Thurman has had an opportunity to work with noted movie directors. Two of her first opportunities came with Stephen Frears’ adaptation (1988) of the novel Dangerous Liaisons and Terry Gilliam’s surreal tale The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988). In the mid-1990s, however, the part of Mia Wallace in Quentin Tarantino’s cult sensation Pulp Fiction (1994) marked a turning point: She was nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe, and she won numerous other awards. Another successful Tarantino collaboration followed nearly a decade later on the cult double-header: Kill Bill: Vols. 1 and 2 (2003, 2004). She received two Golden Globe nominations for her role as The Bride.\n\nUma Thurman’s varied filmography includes a wide range of genres, from small-scale independent pictures such as the comedy The Truth About Cats & Dogs (1996) to blockbusters like Batman and Robin (1997) and Les Misérables (1998). She worked with Woody Allen and Sean Penn on the biopic about musician Emmet Ray, Sweet and Lowdown (1999), and for her role in Mira Nair’s made-for-TV movie Hysterical Blindness (2002) she won a Golden Globe. Ms. Thurman and Pulp Fiction costar John Travolta met again on the set of the gangster flick Be Cool (2005), and she was directed by Lars von Trier in his sexual study Nymphomaniac: Vols. I and II (2013, 2014). She is currently working with her colleagues Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken on the family comedy The War with Grandpa directed by Tim Hill.\n\nIn addition to acting, she is also a movie producer, and this year she served as president of the Un Certain Regard jury at Cannes.\n\nKARLOVY VARY FILM FESTIVAL TO OPEN WITH THE FILM THE BIG SICK\n\nThe opening film of this year’s KVIFF will be director Michael Showalter’s unconventional romantic comedy The Big Sick. After the festival’s conclusion, the film will be distributed in Czech cinemas by KVIFF Distribution, a joint project established by the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, Aerofilms and Czech Television in order to present original works of cinema to Czech audiences. The opening film will be shown in the Grand Hall of the Hotel Thermal, and also at two other screenings for the general public.\n\nDuring the closing ceremony of the 52nd KVIFF, we will be showing director Denis Villeneuve’s mysterious sci-fi Arrival, in which one of the main roles was played by Jeremy Renner, one of the festival’s guests this year and a recipient of the President’s Award.\n\nThe Big Sick\n\nLike many other comedians, Kumail wants to escape the small stages of out-of-the-way clubs and perform before a large audience. Yet he fails to impress the man capable of arranging an appealing engagement for him, and, what’s more, his new show on his Pakistani origins slips into a boring monologue. Kumail also struggles with his parents, who would rather see their son as a lawyer married to one of the Pakistani girls they keep trying to fix him up with. Things get even more complicated when he meets Emily and falls for her quirkiness and sense of humour. The question of whether to tell his parents about his girlfriend, who meets none of their basic criteria, seriously complicates Kumail’s life. The film’s husband-and-wife co-writers, Emily V. Gordon and Kumail Nanjiani, based their film on their own life story, thus reinforcing its authenticity. Add to this the sense of lightness and immediacy typifying the film’s direction, and we get a fun and candid comedy that avoids the usual rom-com clichés.\n\nArrival\n\nWhen several giant ships of unknown origin appear at over a dozen locations on Earth, top teams of scientists set out to study them. The American team is headed by physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) and linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams), who join forces in order to show that the extraterrestrial visitors are a threat to mankind only if we fail to communicate with them. One of the most original science fiction movies of recent years, Arrival cemented director Denis Villeneuve’s position as one the most closely watched directors working today.\n\nINTERNATIONAL JURIES\n\nStatutory Juries:\n\nG r a n d J u r y\n\nAnna Brüggemann\n\nGerman actress and screenwriter. Born in Munich, Brüggemann grew up in South Africa and various parts of Germany. She got her first part at age 15, having wanted to act since childhood.

In 2006 she and her brother Dietrich started writing scripts together for his films, in which she also took one of the leads (Run If You Can / Renn, wenn du kannst, 2010; Move / Drei Zimmer/Küche/Bad, 2012). At the 2014 Berlinale, the siblings received the Best Script Silver Bear for Stations of the Cross (Kreuzweg). A year later, Brüggemann shone in her brother’s satire Heil, presented in competition at KVIFF. She is currently writing her first novel, Split Up.\n\nSarah Flack\n\nFilm editor based in New York.

Her first film job came on the Prague set of Steven Soderbergh’s Kafka, and she later edited three of his films: Schizopolis, The Limey, and Full Frontal. She graduated from Brown University with degrees in political science and semiotics, and in 2016 she was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nCiro Guerra\n\nColombian director born in Río de Oro. Guerra’s first two pictures, Wandering Shadows (La sombra del caminante, 2004) and The Wind Journeys (Los viajes del viento, 2009), are widely ranked with his country’s best cinematic output, and they traveled to more than 160 festivals, including Cannes (Un Certain Regard), Toronto, San Sebastián, Rotterdam, Locarno, and Tribeca. Both films were released commercially in several countries and received more than 40 international awards. His third feature Embrace of the Serpent (El abrazo de la serpiente, KVIFF 2015) won the top prize following its premiere screening in Cannes’ Director’s Fortnight (2015) and became the first Colombian movie to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nMichel Merkt\n\nGolden Globe-winning producer based in Monaco.

Between 1993 and 2011 he produced and directed “Filmopolis,” a monthly TV magazine.\n\nE a s t o f t h e W e s t J u r y\n\nEvrim Ersoy\n\nJournalist, festival programmer, and filmmaker. Ersoy was born in Istanbul but has spent most of his life in London. His study of criminal psychology had a marked influence on his decision to work in film. After first earning a living as a journalist, he moved on to festival programming. He is currently the creative director of the largest festival of genre movies in the United States, Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas, but is also a programmer for Beyond Fest, MotelX, the Boston Underground FF, and more.

Glurjidze graduated in French language and literature, then went on to study film directing and screenwriting under Giorgi Shengelaia at Shota Rustaveli Theater and Film University.

It subsequently screened at dozens of festivals, winning a number of prizes, and represented Georgia in the contest for Best Foreign Language Film at the American Academy Awards.\n\nIgor Soukmanov\n\nBelarusian festival organizer and film publicist.

She is also an active environmentalist, and with her husband Sting has raised some $40 million for the Rainforest Fund which they founded in 1989. She started out as a theatre and television actress, but in the early 1990s shifted her focus to producing feature films – for instance, Guy Ritchie’s Snatch (2000) and Duncan Jones’s Moon (2009). In 2011 she joined with Celine Rattray to found Maven Pictures, which produced Still Alice (2014, dirs. Richard Glatzer, Wash Westmoreland) and last year’s Cannes hit American Honey (2016, dir. Andrea Arnold). Her feature debut Freak Show screened in the Generation 14plus section at the 67th Berlinale.\n\nITALIAN ACTRESS JASMINE TRINCA TO APPEAR AT THE SCREENING OF FORTUNATA AT KVIFF\n\nThis year’s Karlovy Vary International Film Festival is proud to play host to Jasmine Trinca, one of Italy’s most distinctive young actresses today, despite the fact that she studied art history, not acting.\n\nTrinca’s acting debut met with great success: in The Son’s Room, which won the Golden Palm at Cannes, she played Nanni Moretti’s daughter – a role for which she was named talent of the year.\n\nShe subsequently appeared in the successful miniseries The Best of Youth and, reprising her collaboration with Nanni Moretti, in the biopic The Caiman about the life of Silvio Berlusconi. Karlovy Vary audiences could see her in 2013 in Valerie Golino’s Miele and Georgio Diritti’s There Will Come a Day, and two years ago in the Taviani brothers’ Wondrous Boccaccio. She also appeared alongside Sean Penn and Javier Bardem in the crime thriller The Gunman.\n\nFor her portrayal of a single mother living on the outskirts of Rome in director Sergio Castellitto’s Fortunata (Lucky), she was given the Un Certain Regard Jury Award for Best Performance at this year’s Cannes Film Festival.\n\nAT THIS YEAR’S KVIFF, CANADIAN DIRECTOR DENIS CÔTÉ WILL ACT AS A MENTOR IN THE FUTURE FRAMES SECTION, WHICH FOCUSES ON DISTINCTIVE CREATIVE TALENTS FROM EUROPEAN FILM SCHOOLS\n\nDenis Côté (b. 1973, Perth-Andover, New Brunswick, Canada) is an independent director and producer living in Quebec. He studied film at Collège Ahuntsic in Montreal, after which he began shooting short films (a genre he still works in) and working as a radio film critic (1999–2005). After his successful festival hit Drifting States (2005 – Golden Leopard in Locarno), he shot several meditative documentaries (Carcasses, 2009; Bestiaire, 2012) and eight features that earned him various awards, including a Silver Leopard at Locarno for All That She Wants (2008) and the Alfred Bauer Prize at the Berlinale for Vic+Flo Saw a Bear (2013 – Horizons at KVIFF 2013). Karlovy Vary audiences may also remember Joy of Man’s Desiring (2014) and Boris Without Beatrice (2016). His films are difficult to classify: He is interested in individuals in crisis and often experiments with form, for instance by mixing fiction with documentary and video.\n\nDIRECTOR SERGEJ LOZNITSA IS A REGULAR GUEST OF THE KARLOVY VARY INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL. THIS YEAR, HE WILL PRESENT AUSTERLITZ, WHICH IS BEING SHOWN IN THE ANOTHER VIEW SECTION\n\nSergei Loznitsa (b. 1964, Baranovichi, Byelorussian SSR) studied mathematics and then moved on to film school in the 1990s. Even his very first artistically stylised documentaries placed him right up there among Europe’s elite directors. His contemplative films, screened regularly at KVIFF, subtly and precisely conjure up the tangible essence of the Russian landscape (Landscape, 2003), of stagnation (The Train Stop, 2000) and, elsewhere, of archetypal industrial operations (Factory, 2004). Loznitsa’s documentaries reflect both current events (Maidan, 2014) and key moments in Russian history (Blockade, 2006; The Event, 2015). The director made his first foray into feature film direction in 2010. His latest offering A Gentle Creature (2017), like his two previous titles My Joy (2010) and In the Fog (2012), was screened in the main competition at Cannes.\n\nBRITISH DIRECTOR MARK COUSINS, WHOSE FILMS ARE A REGULAR PART OF OUR FESTIVAL PROGRAMME, WILL PRESENT STOCKHOLM, MY LOVE IN THE ANOTHER VIEW SECTION\n\nMark Cousins (b. 1965, Belfast) is a Northern Irish filmmaker, writer, curator, film critic, and traveller living in Scotland. His feature debut The First Movie (2009) won the Prix Italia. On the world stage, Cousins is best known for The Story of Film: An Odyssey (2011), which was presented at numerous festivals, including KVIFF 2012. He has written works on cinema: The Story of Film (2004), Imagining Reality: The Faber Book of Documentary (with Kevin Macdonald, 2006), and Widescreen: Watching Real People Elsewhere (2008). He and Tilda Swinton head up the 8½ Foundation, whose mission is to broaden kids’ cinematic horizons with movies from around the world. Other films by Cousins screened at KVIFF: What Is This Film Called Love? (2012), A Story of Children and Film (2013), Life May Be (co-dir. Mania Akbari, 2013), and I Am Belfast (2015), which competed in the Documentary Film Competition.\n\nINDUSTRY\n\nArtisans in Focus\n\nThis year, the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival is proud to announce a new initiative in partnership with Variety magazine, Barrandov Studio and Czech Anglo Productions. Motivated by the fact that Central Europe serves as a reliable hub for film professionals in film production who have demonstrated excellent skill sets in various below-the-line professions, the festival wishes to highlight these talented professions and how they relate to the festival’s programme and to the region it represents.\n\nWhile legendary film stars and great auteurs of global cinema are regularly celebrated, less heralded are the geniuses behind the camera. In a historic new event this year, Artisans in Focus will spotlight the brilliant individuals who create the images and sounds that form the magic of movies.
