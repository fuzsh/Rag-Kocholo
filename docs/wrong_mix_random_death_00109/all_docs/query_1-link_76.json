        "text": "\"When the data and the anecdotes disagree, the anecdotes are usually right\" - Jeff Bezos Jeff tells this great story about this, where the data in their weekly business review showed average wait times for customer service was under 60 seconds, but customers were complaining about long wait times. So in the meeting, Jeff called customer service, and he and the rest of the senior management team waited in silence for the call to be answered. The wait time was \"really long, over 10 minutes\". Clearly, you wouldn't want to be the customer service executive responsible for this metric in that meeting, but the reality was that the data, while it said everything was fine, wasn't measuring the right thing. He says: \"it doesn't mean you just slavishly go follow the anecdotes\" rather, \"you go examine the data because it's usually not that the data is being miscollected, it's usually that you're not measuring the right thing.\" Link to the original video clip in the comment - and download my free OKR ebook for my how-to use data the way Jeff does.\n\nImagine stepping into Amazon for a meeting and having it completely revolutionize your understanding of leadership. 🌟 After my 6 years at Google, I thought I had the leadership game down pat. But this was different. My first weekly business review at Amazon wasn’t just another meeting. Instead of the expected scene of team leaders and managers casually glancing over spreadsheets, I found myself in the midst of VPs, deeply engrossed in data. 📊 These weren't just any execs. They led teams of up to 500, yet here they were, meticulously analyzing data from: - Website pages - Product listings - Categories - Regional performances - Market dynamics They posed critical questions: - What does the data say? - How effective is this approach? - Why does this look odd? Their level of detail orientation was nothing short of astonishing. 🤯 This wasn't micromanagement. It was mastery. A profound understanding gained by actually getting into the nitty-gritty of operations. 👀 At Amazon, the top brass doesn’t just delegate. They dive deep. They analyze. They synthesize. They ensure they are intimate with every facet of their business so they can make decisions rapidly. 🚀 Leadership, I learned, isn’t just about grand visions. It’s equally about rolling up your sleeves and immersing yourself in the details. 🙌 📝 I'm here to dive deep into management, leadership, strategy and execution - the essence of scaling up.

This is how to fail as a leader. Of course, you'll also fail as a leader if you don't know how to delegate and monitor effectively. The leadership principle at work here is that as a leader, you have to Dive Deep. \"Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.\" How does one do that without burning out? Subscribe to my newsletter and find out later this week. Link in the comments.\n\nHere’s why you need a “bar” in your company. No, not that sort of bar. I mean a “performance bar”. A well-defined set of expectations for people in a given role at a given level. For example: A Senior Software Engineer should be able to: ✅ Deliver high quality, scalable and efficient software that sets a benchmark for others. ✅ Guide and mentor junior software engineers and help build a strong team. ✅ Contribute to the roadmap and technical strategy of their product. ✅ Identify and solve complex problems spanning multiple products. ✅ Collaborate with cross-functional teams including product managers, designers, and stakeholders. When interviewing for a Senior Software Engineer, you’re then looking for evidence that they have done these things at an appropriate scope and level of complexity, and potentially in a related domain to what you’re working on. But more than that, this set of expectations is what you use when: 👏 Assessing the performance of your Senior Software Engineers and calibrating performance across teams. 👏 Coaching Senior Software Engineers for performance. 👏 Deciding on a promotion of a Junior Software Engineer to Senior Software Engineer. 👏 Coaching Junior Software Engineers for development. 👏 Handling low performance and structuring a PIP, or even communicating a firing decision. This set of expectations is central to building a High Performance Team - and the concept is the same whether you are talking about software engineers, marketers, operations managers or CxO's. Do you have clear expectations for every role and level in your team? Do you apply those expectations to your specific needs and discuss that with your team? Can you articulate those expectations to your team members, your peers, your manager, and your recruiter? Are you using these expectations for hiring, firing, promotion, and coaching? The best way to develop this skill is by working with peer managers and benefiting from their experiences too. Join ScaleupLeaders for a chance to do that."
