Tarantino is undoubtedly one of the most influential writers and directors of all time. Whether you like his movies or not, his work cannot be ignored. His passion for film and writing are second to none. So how does he write?

1. Writing is the foundation for everything.

While in his twenties, Quentin worked at a video store called Video Archives for over four years. During this time, he made a feature film during his time off. He would save money to rent film equipment, and then film as much as possible during the weekend. Then he would save up more money to keep making his movie.

As he finished his movie, he realized that he did not spend enough time working on the writing. The story was a mess, so the movie was a mess. In his own words, Quentin says “I failed, but I learned how to make a movie.” That was his film school.

In the end, the footage he shot was turned into guitar picks and never saw the light of day. But he learned a ton and realized that he needed to start with solid writing. As a result, writing is now the foundation for all of his work.
