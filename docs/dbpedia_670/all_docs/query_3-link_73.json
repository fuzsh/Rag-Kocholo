        "text": "The U.S. Supreme Court proclaimed on June 26 that same-sex couples have a fundamental right to marry and are entitled to equal protection under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, but that doesn’t always entitle them to the same insurance benefits.\n\nMarisa and Terrah Pavan of Little Rock are one of three couples suing Arkansas Department of Health Director Nathaniel Smith in hopes of getting both of their names on the birth certificates of children they are parenting together.\n\nThe Pavans married in New Hampshire in 2011 and in May 2015, Terrah Pavan gave birth to baby Tucker, who was conceived through anonymous donor sperm during reproductive treatments they arranged and paid for together.\n\nTerrah Pavan is a stay-at-home mother. Marisa Pavan was able to add Terrah to her employee benefits as an “adult dependent,” but when it came time to add Tucker, she needed a birth certificate identifying her as a parent — and that’s where she hit a wall.\n\nThey tried to add Marisa’s name to Tucker’s birth certificate in the hospital after their daughter was born shortly before the Supreme Court ruling came down.\n\n“We politely crossed out ‘father’ and wrote ‘mother’ or ‘other parent’ or whatever they want to call it and wrote my name and the birth certificate came back with only Terrah’s name on it,” Marisa said.\n\nThe Pavans went to the ADH Bureau of Vital Records on the day of the Supreme Court ruling, hoping to get the issue resolved once and for all.\n\n“They told us they couldn’t do it,” she said of Health Department staff.\n\nThe Pavans have been to the Vital Records office five times in all, with no luck. They explored insurance exchanges and private insurance options, but ultimately ended up applying for Medicaid for Tucker.\n\n“It’s just really frustrating because I pay for my medical insurance and I pay for Terrah’s, and I have the ability and the job to pay for Tucker’s at a low cost if she was on my policy,” she said.\n\nLanguage of the Law\n\nThe Pavans’ lawyer, Cheryl Maples, said the Health Department’s refusal is discrimination.\n\n“They’ve been ordered by [Circuit] Judge [Chris] Piazza; they’ve been ordered by the U.S. Supreme Court; the governor of the state of Arkansas has said that all state agencies have to now treat same-sex couples like heterosexual couples but on the birth certificate issue they’re not,” Maples said.\n\nThe problem, according to Health Department Chief Financial Officer Robert Brech, lies in state statutes.\n\n“We politely crossed out ‘father’ and wrote ‘mother’ or ‘other parent’ or whatever they want to call it and wrote my name and the birth certificate came back with only Terrah’s name on it,” said Marisa Pavan of Little Rock, who is seeking to obtain health insurance for her daughter.\n\nArkansas Code Annotated 20-18-401 specifies that if a woman “was married at the time of either conception or birth or between conception and birth the name of the husband shall be entered on the certificate as the father of the child.”\n\nThere are some stipulations allowing for the court or the mother and father determining that the father is someone other than the husband, and for the father not being named on the birth certificate at all, but all of those specifications refer to the father, which is a gender-specific term.\n\n“This goes back to the time of even old common law and what it says is that if a woman is married at the time of conception or at the time of birth, the husband is the presumptive father,” Brech said. “Obviously that would be true in the vast majority of cases. With a same-sex couple, you obviously can’t presume that the other spouse is the biological parent — they’re obviously not — so that presumption doesn’t hold true with same-sex couples.”\n\nHealth Department officials can’t change the statute, Brech said. That would have to be done by the Arkansas Legislature or by a court ruling that declared the statute unconstitutional. Some states have done that, he said, doing away with the biological implications in the vital records and identifying married couples as parents.\n\n“What we’ve told the same-sex couples — and it’s not to discriminate against them in any way — is that because it’s presumed that there is a biological parent out there somewhere, really it’s best to get that court order, for that spouse to adopt that child and extinguish the right that any biological parent might have and then have the court order us to put that other spouse on the birth certificate,” he said.\n\nAnother statute — Arkansas Code Annotated 9-10-201 — deals with artificial insemination and surrogacy and may be more applicable in same-sex cases, although, again, gender-specific language prevents it from addressing present-day situations.\n\nAccording to that law: “Any child born to a married woman by means of artificial insemination shall be deemed the legitimate natural child of the woman and the woman’s husband if the husband consents in writing to the artificial insemination.”\n\nMaples said that she has performed several stepparent adoptions for same-sex couples since the Supreme Court ruling, which have resulted in court orders to add same-sex spouses’ names to birth certificates.\n\nHowever, she said, pride is damaged in many cases.\n\n“They aren’t stepparents,” she said of her clients. “These are their children.”\n\nMarisa Pavan is aware that adoption would allow for a way around the benefits conundrum her family faces but has been dissuaded from initiating the process because of the cost.\n\n“When you’ve already gone through thousands of dollars just to have a baby, it’s hard to come up with thousands more to go through an adoption,” she said.\n\nFriends have set up a GoFundMe campaign to help the Pavans with the costs of the adoption.\n\nFor other same-sex couples, barriers — albeit temporary ones — have gone up in other insurance matters.\n\nThe Marriage Discount\n\nJulie Halford of Russellville called her auto insurance company a couple of months ago and asked that she and her wife, Margie Harris, be granted the marriage discount that so many of her heterosexual couple friends enjoy.\n\n“She said, ‘Well, the problem is we’re not giving that discount to same-sex couples,’” Halford said of the customer service agent she talked with at AAA Auto Insurance’s St. Louis headquarters. “I said, ‘Why not?’ and she said, ‘Well our system doesn’t recognize two men or two women as being a married couple.’ I said, ‘That’s not my problem. You need to upgrade your system.’”\n\nRyan James, communications director and legislative liaison for the Arkansas Insurance Department, where Halford filed a complaint about her experience, said that if something on the form prevented the company from offering the discount, the company would need to request that an amendment to the form be approved by the Insurance Department.\n\nHowever, no such request has been filed, he said.\n\nAfter subsequent conversations with supervisors at AAA, Halford and her wife were granted the marriage discount.\n\n“It was a miscommunication, absolutely,” said Michael Wright, vice president of public affairs for AAA. “We’ve corrected it. I think the woman has gotten her marriage rate and we have notified all the people who are likely to be taking these calls.”\n\nAs for AAA’s paperwork, Wright said, “Everything is computerized, so there are no forms. It may be male or female on the system because there are different rates for males and females but I don’t think that had anything to do with the marriage discount.”\n\nBut, he added, “Keep in the mind that the Supreme Court decision was two months ago and insurance companies don’t move at the speed of light, let me tell you. It takes a while to do the necessary filing or understand just what is required and what the parameters of the requirement of it are, so the fact that we are up and running with it I think is pretty good.”\n\nEric Nordman, the National Association of Insurance Commissioner’s director of regulatory services, said that prior to the Supreme Court ruling, auto insurance companies operated under the laws of the states where they were doing business with respect to same-sex marriage. In states where same-sex marriage was recognized, same-sex couples were given the same discounts as heterosexual couples.\n\n“I don’t think there’s any widespread attempt by insurers to discriminate,” said Nordman. “They generally try to stay out of trouble because the last thing they want is a bunch of complaints about unjust treatment from the populace because that simply causes them to get some adverse publicity and then they have to deal with it.”\n\nNordman said married couples’ discount rates are usually somewhere around 2 to 2.5 percent through most companies, and he expects the financial impact to the auto insurance industry of new marriage discounts awarded to same-sex couples after the Supreme Court decision to be negligible.\n\n“There will probably be a rush of people to get married so there will be a bump or a blip but gradually as this becomes the norm, they will just flow into the system and it won’t be any different from getting married as a heterosexual couple,” he said. “I’m not sure it would be a significant enough number to raise rates for everybody.”\n\nLong Court Proceedings\n\nIn the Pavans’ case, Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge has asked the court, on behalf of the Insurance Department’s Smith, to issue summary judgment.\n\n“The plaintiffs in this case who are not biological parents of the children do not have any constitutional right to a parental relationship with the children, whether they are married to the biological parents of the children or not. Likewise, a child has no constitutional right to a parental relationship with an adult who is not the child’s biological parent. Accordingly, there is no due process violation in this case,” the affidavit filed by Rutledge’s office on Smith’s behalf on Aug. 13 said in part.\n\nFurther, it said: “The statutes at issue do not classify the adult Plaintiffs based upon their gender or their sexual orientation, but rather, based upon whether they are a biological parent of a child or not. Accordingly, there is no gender discrimination or sexual orientation discrimination. The state’s different treatment of biological parents and intended parents who are not biological parents is supported by legitimate state interests.”\n\n“They aren’t stepparents. These are their children,” said Cheryl Maples, an attorney representing parents trying to add their spouse’s name to their child’s birth certificate\n\nAs for Marisa Pavan, she knows this will likely be a long process but would just like to see the issue resolved so she can focus on her daughter.\n\n“I really just want to sit around and play with my daughter and go for strolls with her. I don’t want to have to worry about this,” she said.\n\n“I want to take responsibility for this baby that I helped bring into the world. I want to be held legally responsible for her, and they’re not letting me unless I pay thousands of dollars to do that.”\n\nMain graphic by Becca Tally"
