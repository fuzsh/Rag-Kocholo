        "text": "Here are three albums by guitarists from three countries placing guitar in different chamber and/or orchestral settings to marvelous effect. I highly recommend all three!\n\nItalian Guitar Concertos\n\nEmanuele Segre (with Orchestra I Pomeriggi Musicali)\n\n(Delos)\n\nEmanuele Segre is perhaps not as well-known here in the U.S. as many other top European guitarists, but through exposure to a few of his albums in recent years (Bach; Giuliani, Rossini, Paganini; and this new one), I’ve come to appreciate him as one of the finest players out there. This thoroughly wonderful recording finds Segre performing concertos by four of his Italian countrymen—two from the distant past, and two contemporary ones—fronting Italy’s Orchestra I Pomeriggi, conducted by Carlo Boccadoro. It’s an ezceptional release from top to bottom.\n\nIt starts with Aria for Guitar and String Orchestra in F-sharp minor by Antonio Vivaldi (1678–1741), originally written as a vocal piece for a cantata but arranged by Segre with the guitar playing the contralto’s part to masterful effect against an orchestration that is both spare and playful. Vivaldi’s three-part Concerto in D major was written for lute and string orchestra and is a delightful Baroque showpiece, with a gorgeous middle Largo movement that’s as pretty as it can be. Next, we move forward in time to the Classical era for the Gran Quintetto, Op. 65 by Mauro Giuliani (1781–1821), a stately and elegant work that really gives Segre the opportunity to demonstrate his rhythmic facility and keen melodic sense.\n\nThe final two pieces bring us solidly into the modern era, and perhaps what’s most surprising is that it is not that jarring a contrast with the earlier works. The Black Owl, by Giovanni Solima (b. 1962) immediately changes the mood of the disc, opening with the eerie drone of high strings, followed by a flowing, folky guitar part that sounds like a burbling woodland stream and eventually is joined by contrasting high strings which build to a climax before the rhythm changes and it enters into a passage that sounds almost Middle Eastern. It goes through other twists and turns, including a slower meditative segment that carries through to the end. Dulcis Memoria II by Carlos Boccadoro (b. 1963) is perhaps the most “modern”-sounding piece on the album, yet it, like all the other pieces, is melodic at its heart and uses the contrast between the guitar’s solo voice and the contribution of the orchestra to mesmerizing effect. Originally composed for clarinet and string orchestra, it was re-written in the mid-1990s for guitar and orchestra and it’s quite a dynamic piece.\n\nAria for Guitar and String Orchestra, RV684 (Antonio Vivaldi); Concerto in D Major, RV83 (Vivaldi); Gran Quintetto, Op. 65 ( Mario Giuliani); The Black Owl (Giovanni Solima); Dulcis Memoria II (Carlo Boccadoro)\n\nThe album can streamed and or purchased through Amazon and iTunes/Apple Music, and streamed on Spotify or YouTube.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew Music for Guitar Duets & Ensemble\n\nCarlos Pavan/Park Slope Chamber Players\n\n(Centaur)\n\nArgentinian guitarist, teacher, and composer Carlos Pavan has been living in New York for two decades now, but his native land obviously still exerts considerable influence on his soul and, by extension, his artistry. With influences ranging from Piazzolla, Ginastera, and Jorge Morel (with whom he studied), to early 20th century masters such as Debussy, Bartok, and Stravinsky, to contemporary jazz, Pavan’s compositions cover a broad range of styles and moods, yet there is something that feels fundamentally traditional about his approach and his aesthetic, even when he delves into more modern sonorities.\n\nThere’s a delightful variety to the pieces on this album, with the small chamber group Pavan directs and plays in—the Park Slope Chamber Players (named for a neighborhood in Brooklyn)—appearing in different combinations on most of the pieces, all of them written by Pavan. So, for instance, there are a couple featuring flute and guitar; another two for clarinet and guitar; and a rich, three-part centerpiece (Concertino) for the entire seven-member ensemble (flute, oboe, clarinet, violin, viola, cello, guitar)—that one is particularly interesting, with lots bold flourishes and an underlying tension that sounds positively cinematic in places: Is that a cat screeching in a dark alley? Who knows? It’s a vivid and imaginative piece. Additionally, there are three fine solo guitar pieces, and the album closes with fantastic work called Suite Cosmopolitan, which finds Pavan playing in a guitar duo with Liz Hogg. You can actually get some sense of the stylistic terrain Pavan and his mates cover just by reading the titles of the pieces below.\n\nPavan is definitely a highly talented composer—and a fine guitarist, of course."
