        "text": "This is a 1960 Lydia Lane article. Enjoy!\n\nAlthough Marisa Pavan and Pier Angeli are twins, they don’t act, talk or think alike. Marisa is rather difficult to know while Pier likes to meet and talk to people. But the one thing they do have in common is their charm. I’ve known Marisa since she first came to Hollywood. She’s a serious, hardworking girl who finds little time for play. Old beyond her years, she has a happy marriage with Jean Pierre Aumont. They live in Paris and Marisa “jets” to Hollywood for a occasional TV show. When she was here recently, we lunched cafeteria-style in the studio commissary. There we discussed the beautiful luncheons to be had in Paris. . “It’s true we lunch for hours in Paris,” Marisa said, “but we eat slowly and our portions are not large. I think it is very unhealthful to eat on the run as they do here in America. And because people seldom take time to have a good meal at lunch-time, they are always snacking. . . “I don’t gain weight in Paris. We don’t have sweets in machines to tempt us or all the billboards with such beautifully displayed food. It makes me hungry to look at it. But I don’t think you hear as much reducing talk over there as you do here. “We eat our most important meal in the middle of the day when we have time to work it off. These large, late dinners, are not nearly as healthful,” Marisa commented.\n\n“What would you have for a typical lunch?” I asked. “Perhaps hot sea food with a lovely sauce and a rice ring with steamed vegetables inside. With this we’d have a good white wine, green salad, cheese, fruit and coffee. “You know they say the French live to eat,” Marisa smiled, “but by taking enough time during meals, they break tensions. You don’t hear of people dying from heart attacks at the rate they do over here.” It was obvious that Marisa loves Paris. “The women are difficult to know but I have many friends now. The French woman is very conscious of fashion. She attends the showings and devotes a lot of time to being well-groomed. “The newest novelty in Paris is the rage for wigs. Everyone is wearing them in different colors. Sometimes it’s difficult to recognize a person as a blond one night and brunet the next. But R gives them freedom from the beauty salons because with the styles so comp’ex, the Parisian woman usually has two or three appointments every week.\n\n“The whole key to your appearance is set by your hair, and unless you learn to be a do-it-yourself girl you are at the mercy of your hairdresser,’ ‘she added. “Once you told me that there were so many interesting things in life that you wanted to do and to learn that you resented the time you had to spend on grooming,” I said. “I still don’t enjoy it,” she confessed, “but I am more disciplined. We have to be flexible in life and learn to adjust to those things we don’t like. For instance, when I was making ‘Solomon and Sheba’ we worked in Spain for four months and I didn’t care for their shooting schedule from 2 p.m. to 8 p a I found it very difficult to relax after working so late. There was nothing I could do to change it, so I adjusted. “They tell me I don’t show it but I’m the nervous type. This is my biggest problem and some day I hope I’ll learn to lose my tenseness. I enjoy lying on a board with my feet higher than my head. I think there is something beneficial about reversing the pull of gravity. “I also find it very relaxing to have a hot bath just before going to bed. I know it’s sup- ; posed to be stimulating but it has the opposite effect on me. ; But I think the most successful way to break tension is with controlled breathing,” she concluded.\n\nThis is a 1958 Lydia Lane article. Enjoy!\n\nWhen Marisa Pavan came to Hollywood she was unhappy. She didn’t speak English too well, she missed her friends in Italy and the people she met here thought of her only as Pier Angeli’s sister. But the other day when we lunched together, Marisa was radiantly happy. We talked about her husband, Jean-Pierre Aumont, and their son Jean. I commented on the contrast between her life and outlook now and the first time we’d met. And Marisa said with deep feeling: “Like a flower blooms in the sunshine, a girl responds to love. It is the prime beauty secret. Happiness Gives Beauty to a Face “There is nothing that gives beauty to a face or -unfolds personality like happiness. In many ways these few years have been wonderful for me. “Working with Anna Magnani and Tennessee Williams’ (referring to the motion picture, “The Rose Tattoo” for which she received an Academy Award nomination) was a great exigence. It was a privilege to be in the presence of such talent and greatness.” As she spoke of her husband her eyes sparkled. “Because of the differences in our years, Jean felt I should wait a little longer to know him better” she said. “But I fell in love with him, and I knew he was the right person for me. This was my happiness. “1 have always felt more or less grownup. As a child I had a feeling of responsibility to myself, and this, I believe, is a sign of maturity. I wanted to develop a mind of my own, to become capable of making my own decisions and to face my mistakes. So much unhappiness is caused by not facing our own mistakes.” “With an altitude like yours, we’d have no delinquent youth,” I remarked. “What did you feel was the biggest thing you had to overcome?”\n\n“I have always been much too critical of myself,” Marisa said quickly, “this resulted in a lack of self-assurance which I’ve been trying to overcome. A negative attitude toward yourself is destructive, and it lacks charm. “Charm is a word that is often misused. It docs not belong to things but to people. It is a variable quality a person you like has charm for you. It is a form of pleasantness that can’t be turned off and on. True charm is always there.” I asked Marisa if living in Paris had made her more fashion-conscious. “I love clothes especially those of the Italian Designer Antonelli,” she replied. “I try to attend the showings in Paris, but I find the French couturiers do not design for my type. Their clothes are too sophisticated and elaborate for me. The possible exception is Hubert de Givenchy, who has a youthful outlook. “You must feel what type you are. I like simple things. I look ‘much better without ‘make-up. I have dark lashes and don’t need mascara, and I wear a very light shade of lipstick. I know the glamour tricks but I don’t often use them.” The waitress brought Marisa a minute steak and spinach. “Remember how overweight I used to be?” she reminded me. “That was when I was unhappy. How I struggled to get thin!” “The more I talk with people,” I said, “the more I realize the importance of the mental side of dieting.”\n\n“I have no problem any more,” Marisa said. “I gave up all Italian foods that I loved the olive oil, the pasta, those rich .sauces and began eating the American way grilled foods, lots of salad, fresh fruits, green vegetables. And I don’t miss them.” “Your figure is adorable now,” I remarked. “I worked to get it this way,” Marisa said. “When I was under contract to Fox I wanted to be thinner, so every morning and every night I exercised for 45 minutes. “I had three favorite exercises for my hips, my stomach and my waist. You don’t have to go to a gym to lose weight. You can get results at home.” I wanted to know more about this routine and asked her to elaborate. Exercise Explained for Reduction of Hips “For my hips,” Marisa said, “I sat on the floor with my legs out in front. Using the palms of my hands for balance, I rocked side to side. You can roll the inches away like this! – “For my waist, I stood up and stretched my arms out from my sides. Then I twisted and bent over to touch the back of my left heel with my right hand and then reversed the procedure. I did this exercise 100 times. But if you aren’t used to exercising, I would advise working up to this gradually. “And for my tummy, I lay flat on the floor, raised my legs up in the air and lowered them very slowly. Just before they touched the floor I raised them again. I did this 100 times in a series of 10, taking a breather in between. “If you want to lose inches in the right places, you have to be consistent and work at it every day.”\n\nThis is a 1955 Lydia Lane article where actresses/twin sisters Pier Angeli and Marisa Pavan talk about a bunch of beauty stuff. Enjoy!\n\nAlthough Pier Angeli and her sister Marisa Pavan are twins, they don’t look alike, talk alike or have similar tastes or even seem to be the same age. Yet both of these Italian beauties have made their mark on the Hollywood scent. For the fist time they were working on the same lot so I managed to get them together in Warner Bros.’ Green Room for lunch. Pier who is very thin ordered a chocolate malt with her flinch. It was obvious she was not calorie conscious. Not so with Marisa, however. ‘I must be so careful what I eat,” Marisa said, eyeing Pier’s healthy lunch, but choosing a cottage cheese salad for herself. ‘I don’t like the right things end it is very difficult. I’m fondest of ice cream and candy,” she confessed.\n\n“I hate candy,” said Pier. Marisa seemed not to hear. “I’m very strict about keeping myself on a high-protein diet,” she continued. “For breakfast I have a glass of hot water with lemon juice, and one poached egg. I don’t drink coffee. For lunch it’s cottage cheese or yogurt with fruit. I have a cup of tea in the afternoon and for dinner all the steak I want with one green and one yellow vegetable and fruit for desert.” Pier laughed. “Marisa is so serious about everything. She is the intellectual one of the family. She studies and reads for hours and hours.” “My education was interrupted by the war and I’m trying to make up for it,” Marisa explained. “I think you have to have confidence to get what you want out of life and learning gives me confidence.”\n\n“The war left me with a problem, too,” Pier confided. “It was a feeling of being robbed of my childhood. I found myself not wanting to grow up. But every problem has to be faced at some tune or other.” “Just realizing that is a big step toward growing up,” I remarked. “And growing up isn’t so painful if you go along at the normal pace.” Pier was called to the telephone and as she crossed the room I noticed what a tiny waist she had. Becoming Clothes “Full skirts are so becoming to her,” Marisa remarked, “but I can’t wear them at all.” Later when I complimented Pier on her slim waist she said, “Marisa and I have such different figures we can’t even wear each other’s clothes like some sisters do. Marisa looks best in sophisticated things. When I try to wear things like that I look foolish -like a little girl trying to wear her mother’s dresses.”\n\n“I don’t think anyone can be at her beat, or even feel confident, when vibe feds the is dressed wrong,” Marisa agreed, and added “But sometimes it take a few painful mistakes before you find what suits you best.” “One thing both of you can be proud of,” I declared, “are your beautiful hands and fingernails. How do you keep them looking like this?” “It’s an old Italian trick,” Pier said with enthusiasm. ”It’s no trouble to keep your nails long if you soak them in a mixture of olive oil, heated slightly, and a little bit of vinegar. I do this a couple of times a week, usually when I change my nail polish.”\n\nWe turned to the subject of skin care and Pier told me she never used creams. “I just wash my face over and over with soap and water until it feels clean.” “My skin is different from Pier’s,” Marisa said. “Soap is too drying for me and I have to use cream, but the important thing is to get all the make-up off. Often I have to go over my face several times with cream before I feel that it is really clean.” I mentioned that when I was In Italy last year so many of the younger let were not wearing lipstick. “But they wear lots of eye makeup,” Marisa said. “That is most important. I think when you put a lot of color on your lips and nothing on your eyes you are drawing attention away from the most important point hi your face.” “But you must learn to use eye make-up to that it doesn’t show,” Pier chimed to. “Doing the wrong things with an eyebrow pencil can make a.girl look years older.” “What do you call the wrong things?” I wanted to know. “Choosing the wrong shade,” said Pier. “Making a straight, hard line instead of soft ones,” said Marisa. I left with the feeling that in spite of their differences, both girls were wise in the ways of beauty."
