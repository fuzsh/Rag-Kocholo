        "text": "WASHINGTON (AP/KATV) — The Supreme Court has ruled for same-sex couples who complained an Arkansas birth certificate law discriminated against them.\n\nThe justices on Monday issued an unsigned opinion reversing an Arkansas high court ruling that upheld the law.\n\nUnder the law, married lesbian couples had to get a court order to have both spouses listed as parents on their children's birth certificates.\n\nArkansas routinely lists a woman's husband as a child's father, even if he is not the biological parent of the child. The same-sex couples want the same presumption applied to the married partner of a woman who gives birth to a child.\n\nThe case, MARISA N. PAVAN, ET AL. v. NATHANIEL SMITH, involved two same-sex married couples from Little Rock who had applied to be listed as parents on their children's birth certificates just days following the landmark SCOTUS decision to recognize the rights of same-sex couples to get married. After being unilaterally denied the right to list both parents on their children's birth certificates, they decided to take legal action to make it happen.\n\nThe primary plaintiff in the case Marisa Pavan and her wife Terrah had been married four years prior to having their daughter Tucker. While Terrah, Tucker's biological mother, was listed on the birth certificate - Pavan's was not.\n\nPavan told KATV she's normally not an outspoken person, but the issue was obviously personal.\n\n\"This meant something to me and it meant something to a lot of people that I knew,\" said Pavan. \"I wanted to do that for everybody.\"\n\nThe Pavans already had a birth certificate with both names on it, after a Pulaski County judge had previously ruled in their favor. The Arkansas Supreme Court overturned the circuit court judge's decision, but that decision was overturned on Monday in a 6-3 ruling from SCOTUS.\n\n\"The biggest part to sink in is that I have lawyer friends from all over the country that have messaged me or texted me and said, 'you know this is great,\" said Pavan. \"It's not just something you've done for Arkansas, this is something that is now going to have to be implemented throughout the country.\"\n\nJustices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented from the ruling.\n\n“In a sharply divided decision, the Supreme Court of the United States overturned the Arkansas Supreme Court without briefing or argument on the merits,” said Attorney General Rutledge. “I disagree with the majority’s flawed reasoning and strongly agree with the conclusions of Justices Gorsuch, Thomas and Alito in their well-reasoned dissent. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has spoken, and I will continue to review today’s decision to determine the appropriate next steps upon remand to the Arkansas Supreme Court to ensure that the law is followed properly.”"
