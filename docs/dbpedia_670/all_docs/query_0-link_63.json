Born on December 4, 1964, in Brooklyn, New York, she discovered her passion for the performing arts at a young age. She studied at Boston University but left before graduation to begin her acting career. She first gained fame on the daytime soap opera As the World Turns and later in the sitcom A Different World. Tomei's breakthrough came in 1992 when she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in My Cousin Vinny. Despite initial surprise in the industry due to her relative newcomer status, Tomei's nuanced performance was widely praised. She continued to demonstrate her acting prowess in a variety of roles, ranging from comedy to drama. Notable performances include parts in films like In the Bedroom, and The Wrestler, both of which earned her further Academy Award nominations. Over the years, Tomei has continuously evolved her craft, successfully transitioning between film, television, and stage. She has appeared in highly acclaimed Broadway productions including Top Girls and The Realistic Joneses, showcasing her range as an actress. In addition to her acting accomplishments, Tomei is also known for her philanthropic efforts, particularly her work promoting civil rights and environmental causes.\n\nMarisa Miller, born on August 6, 1978, in Santa Cruz, California, is a celebrated American model and actress.

Her all-American looks and natural appeal quickly garnered her a strong fan base, and she soon became one of the most recognized faces in the modeling industry. Miller's professional journey began at an early age when two Italian modeling agents discovered her at a San Francisco caf√©. From there, she rapidly ascended in the fashion world, working with notable brands such as Marc Jacobs, Ralph Lauren, and Tommy Hilfiger. However, it was her tenure as a Victoria's Secret Angel from 2007 to 2010 that cemented her status as a global icon. Besides modeling, Miller also ventured into acting, making her film debut in the 2013 action thriller R.I.P.D. Despite her fame and success, Miller remained grounded and devoted much of her time to philanthropy. She has been involved with the USO, the American Cancer Society, and the Pedigree Adoption Drive, among other charitable organizations.
