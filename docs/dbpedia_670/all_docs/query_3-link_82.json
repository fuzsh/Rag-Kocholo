        "text": "This title is printed to order. This book may have been self-published. If so, we cannot guarantee the quality of the content. In the main most books will have gone through the editing process however some may not. We therefore suggest that you be aware of this before ordering this book. If in doubt check either the author or publisherâs details as we are unable to accept any returns unless they are faulty. Please contact us if you have any questions.\n\nTHIS IS THE FIRST biography ever written about Italian-born French actress, dancer, singer, and producer Marisa Pavan, who acquired fame during the Golden Age of Hollywood in the 1950s and in American television in the 1960s and 1970s. Pavan is the twin sister of actress Pier Angeli (1932-1971), who is best known today for her ill-fated relationship with actor James Dean. Pavan is also the widow of Jean-Pierre Aumont (1911-2001), a famous stage and screen actor and writer in France and in the United States.\n\nBased on extensive interviews with Pavan herself and with various people who have known her and worked with her over the years, this book is a tribute to Pavanâs life and career, with a focus on her Hollywood years and the studio system and star system through which she had to navigate. It is part of a bigger biographical project that includes a French-English website, www.marisapavan.com."
