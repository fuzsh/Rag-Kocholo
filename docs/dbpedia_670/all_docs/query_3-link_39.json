        "text": "Italian actress (1932–1971)\n\nAnna Maria Pierangeli (19 June 1932 – 10 September 1971[1]), known internationally by the stage name Pier Angeli, was an Italian actress, model and singer. She won the Nastro d'Argento for Best Actress for her debut role in the 1950 film Tomorrow Is Too Late, and subsequently won a Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress for her performance in the American film Teresa (1951).\n\nIn the United States, Angeli was typecast in \"European ingénue\" roles, and notably played romantic leading ladies in The Light Touch (1951), The Devil Makes Three (1952), The Story of Three Loves (1953), The Silver Chalice (1954), and Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956). She was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actress for her role opposite Richard Attenborough in the British film The Angry Silence (1960).\n\nOff-screen, Angeli was known for her high-profile romantic affairs with actors Kirk Douglas and James Dean, and later her tumultuous marriage to singer Vic Damone. She died at the age of 39 of a barbiturate overdose.\n\nHer twin sister Marisa Pavan, was also an actress.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nAnna Maria Pierangeli was born to Enrichetta (née Romiti) and Luigi Pierangeli in Cagliari, Sardinia in 1932.[1] She had a fraternal twin sister, actress Marisa Pavan.\n\nAngeli spent World War II in Rome; she was ten when the Nazis occupied Rome, experiencing both food shortages and bomb shelters. She was deeply affected by her experiences during the war, recalling later: \"What was in the world, I didn't want to know.\"[1]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nAngeli made her film debut at the age of 16 with Vittorio De Sica's Italian film, Domani è troppo tardi (1950) after being spotted by director Léonide Moguy and De Sica while studying arts in Rome. Her work was so impressive that she won the Nastro d'Argento for Best Actress, and caught the eye of MGM producers, who offered her a contract with the studio.[1]\n\nMGM launched her in Teresa (1951), her first American film, which also saw the film debuts of Rod Steiger and John Ericson. Reviews for this performance compared her to Greta Garbo, and she won the New Star of the Year–Actress Golden Globe. Under contract to MGM throughout the 1950s, she appeared in a series of films, including The Light Touch with Stewart Granger and The Devil Makes Three with Gene Kelly. Plans for a film of Romeo and Juliet with her and Marlon Brando fell through when a British-Italian production was announced.\n\nWhile filming The Story of Three Loves (1953), Angeli began a relationship with costar Kirk Douglas. She next appeared in Sombrero, in which she replaced an indisposed Ava Gardner, then Flame and the Flesh (1954). After discovering Leslie Caron, another European ingénue, MGM lent Angeli to other studios. She went to Warner Bros. for both The Silver Chalice (1954), which marked the debut of Paul Newman, and the French-language musical Oh No, Mam'zelle (Mam'zelle Nitouche), also 1954), co-starring alongside Fernandel. For Paramount, she was in contention for the role of Anna Magnani's daughter in The Rose Tattoo (1955), but the role went to Marisa Pavan, her twin sister. MGM lent her to Columbia for Port Afrique (1956), where she got to showcase her real singing voice. She returned to MGM for Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956) as Paul Newman's long-suffering wife (Angeli's former lover, James Dean, was to play the starring role, which went to Newman after Dean's death). Newman would later say of her: \"The most beautiful Italian actress of the century. She was an extremely complex and gifted woman. It was so unfortunate that the roles she was asked to play rarely demanded what I know she had to offer.\"[1] She then appeared in The Vintage (1957) and finished her MGM contract in Merry Andrew (1958) starring alongside Danny Kaye. She was in consideration to play the character of Rima in, Green Mansions (1959), a character she had long wanted to play. Instead she played the part for the July 1954 issue of Life Magazine, shot by Allan Grant.[1][2] In 1959, she released an album called Italia con Pier Angeli in which she sings in English and Italian. One reviewer called her singing voice \"warm and surprisingly rich.\"[3] She also continued to be hired for modelling jobs well into the 1960s.\n\nDuring the 1960s and until 1970, Angeli lived and worked in Britain and Europe, and was often screen-credited under her birth name, Anna Maria Pierangeli. She starred in French, Italian and English-language movies throughout the 1960s. Her performance in The Angry Silence (1960), starring alongside her friend Richard Attenborough, was nominated for a Best Foreign Actress BAFTA, and she was reunited with Stewart Granger for Sodom and Gomorrah (1963), in which she played Lot's wife. She had a brief role in the war epic Battle of the Bulge (1965). Angeli worked in Israel, and was top-billed, for Every Bastard a King (1968), about events during the Arab-Israeli Six-Day War the previous year. She was under serious consideration for a part in, The Godfather (1972), but died before shooting began.[1]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nAngeli was fluent in Italian and English, and near fluent in French. She was good friends with Debbie Reynolds, Louis Jourdan, and Richard Attenborough.[1] Because she travelled so much, she encountered many artists throughout her life. For example, In 1960, Angeli met Serge Gainsbourg in a nightclub. On a piece of paper she scribbled in French: \"J’adore 'L’eau à la bouche', ça me donne l’eau à la bouche,\" and slipped it into one of Gainsbourg's pockets. He treasured this relic, and her gesture had the effect of motivating him to persevere in romantic songwriting.[4][5]\n\nAccording to Kirk Douglas' autobiography The Ragman's Son, he and Angeli were engaged in the 1950s after meeting on the set of the film The Story of Three Loves (1953).[6]\n\nAffair with James Dean\n\n[edit]\n\nAngeli also had a passionate romantic relationship with James Dean. They met while she was shooting The Silver Chalice (1954)[7] and he was shooting East of Eden (1955), on an adjoining Warner lot.\n\nElia Kazan, the director of East of Eden (1955), remembered hearing Dean and Angeli loudly having sex in Dean's dressing room.[8][1]\n\nMuch against her will, she was forced to break it off, mainly because her mother was not happy with their relationship because Dean was not Catholic.[1][9] There were rumors that she and Dean secretly saw each other up until his death; Joe Hyams, in his 1992 biography of Dean, James Dean: Little Boy Lost, claims that he visited Dean just as Angeli, then married to Damone, was leaving his home. An Order for the Solemnization of Marriage pamphlet with the name \"Pier\" lightly penciled in every place the bride's name is left blank was found amongst Dean's personal effects after his death.[10] She would later say that he was the love of her life: \"He is the only man I ever loved deeply as a woman should love a man.\"[9] Friends of Angeli have said she never fully recovered from his death and that she had nightmares about him up until her own death.[1]\n\nMarriage to Vic Damone\n\n[edit]\n\nAngeli rejected Dean and married singer and actor Vic Damone in 1954.[11] Singer and actor Dean Martin performed at their wedding.[1] It was reported by several people who attended the wedding that they saw James Dean, claiming Dean watched the wedding from across the road on his motorcycle, even gunning the engine during the ceremony, although Dean later denied doing anything so \"dumb.\"[9][12]\n\nDuring their marriage, they appeared as guests on the 17 June 1956 episode of What's My Line?.[13] She had one son with Vic Damone; their 1958 divorce was followed by highly publicized court battles for the custody of their only child, son Perry (1955–2014).\n\nLater life and death\n\n[edit]\n\nAngeli next married Italian composer Armando Trovajoli in 1962 with whom she had another son, Howard, in 1963. She and Trovajoli separated in 1969.[14]\n\nIn the early 1970s she returned to California after having lived in Britain and Europe throughout the 1960s, and briefly lived with her close friend Debbie Reynolds until she found a little apartment in Beverly Hills.[12]\n\nOn 10 September 1971, at the age of 39, Angeli was found dead of a barbiturate overdose at her home in Beverly Hills. On the day of her death, Angeli had been given an injection of Compazine by her doctor to calm her down (she was unable to sleep and had run out of Doriden which the doctor refused to give her).[1] Death due to anaphylaxis has been suggested; however, it is not supported by the findings of her autopsy.[1][15][16]\n\nHer former lover Kirk Douglas and his wife Anne Buydens were among those who were invited to her funeral.[1] She is interred in the Cimetière des Bulvis in Rueil-Malmaison, Hauts-de-Seine, France.\n\nPortrayals in popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nAngeli was portrayed by Valentina Cervi in the 2001 TV movie James Dean, which depicted her relationship with Dean. In 2015, she was portrayed by Alessandra Mastronardi in the James Dean biopic Life. A fictional interpretation of her life can be found in the book, Anna-Maria Pier Angeli: Une Madone à Babylone.[17]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm Year Title Role Notes 1950 Tomorrow Is Too Late Mirella 1951 Tomorrow Is Another Day Luisa Teresa Teresa Russo 1952 The Light Touch Anna Vasarri Wilhelmina (Willie) Lehrt Herself Short film 1953 Nina Burkhardt Segment: \"Equilibrium\" Sombrero Eufemia Calderon 1954 Oh No, Mam'zelle Denise de Flavigny / Nitouche Flame and the Flesh Lisa Deborra 1956 Meet Me in Las Vegas Herself Uncredited cameo 1956 Somebody Up There Likes Me Norma 1956 Port Afrique Ynez 1957 Lucienne 1958 Merry Andrew Selena Gallini 1959 SOS Pacific Teresa 1960 Anna Curtis 1960 Estoril y sus fiestas Herself Short film 1961 White Slave Ship Polly Credited as Anna Maria Pierangeli 1962 Sodom and Gomorrah Ildith 1962 Musketeers of the Sea Consuelo / Gracia 1964 Shadow of Evil Lila Sinn 1965 Berlin, Appointment for the Spies Paula Krauss 1965 Battle of the Bulge Louise 1966 M.M.M. 83 Hélène Blanchard 1966 Per mille dollari al giorno Betty Benson Credited as Annamaria Pierangeli 1966 Caccia ai violenti Ann Peterson 1968 Red Roses for the Fuhrer Marie Credited as Anna Maria Pierangeli 1968 Every Bastard a King Eileen 1969 Cry Chicago Bambi Credited as Anna Maria Pierangeli 1969 Love Me, Love My Wife Alexandra 1970 In the Folds of the Flesh Falesse / Ester 1970 Quell'amore particolare Cecilia 1971 Octaman Susan Lowry Posthumous release\n\nTelevision Year Title Role Notes 1956 What's My Line?
