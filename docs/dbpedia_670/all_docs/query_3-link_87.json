        "text": "This is a 1955 Lydia Lane article where actresses/twin sisters Pier Angeli and Marisa Pavan talk about a bunch of beauty stuff. Enjoy!\n\nAlthough Pier Angeli and her sister Marisa Pavan are twins, they don’t look alike, talk alike or have similar tastes or even seem to be the same age. Yet both of these Italian beauties have made their mark on the Hollywood scent. For the fist time they were working on the same lot so I managed to get them together in Warner Bros.’ Green Room for lunch. Pier who is very thin ordered a chocolate malt with her flinch. It was obvious she was not calorie conscious. Not so with Marisa, however. ‘I must be so careful what I eat,” Marisa said, eyeing Pier’s healthy lunch, but choosing a cottage cheese salad for herself. ‘I don’t like the right things end it is very difficult. I’m fondest of ice cream and candy,” she confessed.\n\n“I hate candy,” said Pier. Marisa seemed not to hear. “I’m very strict about keeping myself on a high-protein diet,” she continued. “For breakfast I have a glass of hot water with lemon juice, and one poached egg. I don’t drink coffee. For lunch it’s cottage cheese or yogurt with fruit. I have a cup of tea in the afternoon and for dinner all the steak I want with one green and one yellow vegetable and fruit for desert.” Pier laughed. “Marisa is so serious about everything. She is the intellectual one of the family. She studies and reads for hours and hours.” “My education was interrupted by the war and I’m trying to make up for it,” Marisa explained. “I think you have to have confidence to get what you want out of life and learning gives me confidence.”\n\n“The war left me with a problem, too,” Pier confided. “It was a feeling of being robbed of my childhood. I found myself not wanting to grow up. But every problem has to be faced at some tune or other.” “Just realizing that is a big step toward growing up,” I remarked. “And growing up isn’t so painful if you go along at the normal pace.” Pier was called to the telephone and as she crossed the room I noticed what a tiny waist she had. Becoming Clothes “Full skirts are so becoming to her,” Marisa remarked, “but I can’t wear them at all.” Later when I complimented Pier on her slim waist she said, “Marisa and I have such different figures we can’t even wear each other’s clothes like some sisters do. Marisa looks best in sophisticated things. When I try to wear things like that I look foolish -like a little girl trying to wear her mother’s dresses.”\n\n“I don’t think anyone can be at her beat, or even feel confident, when vibe feds the is dressed wrong,” Marisa agreed, and added “But sometimes it take a few painful mistakes before you find what suits you best.” “One thing both of you can be proud of,” I declared, “are your beautiful hands and fingernails. How do you keep them looking like this?” “It’s an old Italian trick,” Pier said with enthusiasm. ”It’s no trouble to keep your nails long if you soak them in a mixture of olive oil, heated slightly, and a little bit of vinegar. I do this a couple of times a week, usually when I change my nail polish.”\n\nWe turned to the subject of skin care and Pier told me she never used creams. “I just wash my face over and over with soap and water until it feels clean.” “My skin is different from Pier’s,” Marisa said. “Soap is too drying for me and I have to use cream, but the important thing is to get all the make-up off. Often I have to go over my face several times with cream before I feel that it is really clean.” I mentioned that when I was In Italy last year so many of the younger let were not wearing lipstick. “But they wear lots of eye makeup,” Marisa said. “That is most important. I think when you put a lot of color on your lips and nothing on your eyes you are drawing attention away from the most important point hi your face.” “But you must learn to use eye make-up to that it doesn’t show,” Pier chimed to. “Doing the wrong things with an eyebrow pencil can make a.girl look years older.” “What do you call the wrong things?” I wanted to know. “Choosing the wrong shade,” said Pier. “Making a straight, hard line instead of soft ones,” said Marisa. I left with the feeling that in spite of their differences, both girls were wise in the ways of beauty."
