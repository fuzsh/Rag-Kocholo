        "text": "I had three people message, unprompted, encouraging me to watch #AnatomyOfAFall. It's a brilliant film and undoubtedly deserves the Cannes Palme d’Or and the five Oscar nods. But like any meaningful experience, it's taken more than a few weeks to understand how this film managed to imprint itself. What I most appreciated about #AnatomyOfAFall is how it uses death and a courtroom trial to show just how impossible it is for us to convey the truth of a relationship to anyone who is outside of it. A wife's husband dies. She is left alone to represent the truth of what their relationship was. At first it feels like she tries to give his truth as much weight as her own. And this seems to be a continuation of what she represented in their relationship. In fact, if we were looking at why they were together, rather than how he died, it's clear that her unrelenting search for truth was something that he loved or needed - despite the affairs, mistakes and betrayals. But maintaining this complex representation to an outside audience, let alone a courtroom weighing your guilt or innocence, becomes close to impossible. In the post-mortem, her independence and search for truth is now conveyed as a cold honesty, a selfishness where she continually put her needs above her husbands. Her lawyer practically begs her to reduce their relationship to a single narrative, to only her truth, so as to help in her defence. But she seems to be unable to. Why? Perhaps this would break with who she knows herself to be and so be worse than any conviction. Perversely, while this shows an undeniable strength of character, it's left to her young son to wrestle with the implications that come from not wanting to play by the rules: by refusing to reduce the complexity of their \"living\" relationship into narrative required for how it ended - she leaves it up to the courtroom (aka us) to judge her. Her son grasps the perils of this in a way that she refuses to. I guess in summary this film would've been more aptly titled an Anatomy of a Marriage - the \"Fall\" is just a hook. I'm curious to hear what your takeaways are. For a way more thorough and thoughtful review I'll pop the good.film guide in the comments.\n\nLandlords & Tenants: The Modern-Day Hatfields & McCoys https://ift.tt/M19svcA 2023-09-18 16:00:50 The Montagues and the Capulets did not like one another. In truth, if we’re being fully trustworthy, we might use the phrase “hate.” While Romeo and Juliet finally did get collectively and supply us with each a romance and a tragedy, every atop their respective lists of all-time romances and tragedies, this was a piece of fiction, in any case. Perhaps William Shakespeare’s biggest accomplishment, Romeo & Juliet featured two highly effective homes, each with monetary and political would possibly, each with grandiose aspirations, and each who would cease at nothing to realize it. It is claimed that Shakespeare bought the concept for Romeo & Juliet from the story of two feuding Italian households within the 1500’s; the Montecchi household and the Capuleti household. Nonetheless, Romeo & Juliet is nonetheless fiction. The Hatfields & McCoys, nevertheless, is a lesser-known however extra genuine story about two households that feuded – and died within the course of. I’m positive you’ve all head of Romeo & Juliet. But what number of of you might have heard of the Hatfields & McCoys? “The Hatfields & McCoys” has grow to be an idiom (or a “metonym”) related to infighting and bitter feuding, however have you ever ever learn into what, precisely, occurred? The two households lived alongside the Kentucky – West Virginia border within the late 1800’s, and each households served within the Civil War. The feud really started after a dispute a couple of hog. Yes, a hog. Specifically, who owned the hog. Can you think about? The McCoy’s who misplaced the trial over the hog, ended up killing the star witness who testified on behalf of the Hatfields. You can’t make this up. Seriously. These had been merely the primary steps in a dispute between the households that lasted a decade, noticed a dozen members of the family killed, sixteen members of the family despatched to jail, and one executed. Tell me you haven’t heard of the “Hatfields & McCoys,” go on. I’ll be trustworthy: I don’t know the place or after I first heard of them, however as soon as I did, I by no means forgot… People use the time period, “like oil and water” to explain issues that don’t combine, or don’t get alongside, and we might use “like night and day,” or “fire and ice.” I don’t know why “be like chalk and cheese,” apparently, means the identical factor. At least, not with out Googling. But whether or not you wish to use “Capulets and Montagues” or “Hatfields and McCoys,” I feel that in the case of landlords and tenants right here within the Province of Ontario, particularly within the GTA, we’re nearly there. Landlords and tenants don’t get alongside. You don’t should Google this subject to see for your self, however relatively simply maintain your eyes and ears open and I’m positive you’ll see and listen to many examples. But who is worse? Who is the antagonis..."
