        "text": "Horoscope and chart of Marisa Pavan (Placidus system)\n\n* A planet less than 1° from the next House cusp is considered to be posited in the said House. 2° when the AS and the MC are involved\n\nAstrological portrait of Marisa Pavan (excerpt)\n\nDisclaimer: these short excerpts of astrological charts are computer processed. They are, by no means, of a personal nature. This principle is valid for the 68,496 celebrities included in our database. These texts provide the meanings of planets, or combination of planets, in signs and in houses, as well as the interpretations of planetary dominants in line with modern Western astrology rules. Moreover, since Astrotheme is not a polemic website, no negative aspect which may damage the good reputation of a celebrity is posted here, unlike in the comprehensive astrological portrait.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHere are some character traits from Marisa Pavan's birth chart. This description is far from being comprehensive but it can shed light on his/her personality, which is still interesting for professional astrologers or astrology lovers.\n\nIn a matter of minutes, you can get at your email address your astrological portrait (approximately 32 pages), a much more comprehensive report than this portrait of Marisa Pavan.\n\nThe dominant planets of Marisa Pavan\n\nWhen interpreting a natal chart, the best method is to start gradually from general features to specific ones. Thus, there is usually a plan to be followed, from the overall analysis of the chart and its structure, to the description of its different character traits.\n\nIn the first part, an overall analysis of the chart enables us to figure out the personality's main features and to emphasize several points that are confirmed or not in the detailed analysis: in any case, those general traits are taken into account. Human personality is an infinitely intricate entity and describing it is a complex task. Claiming to rapidly summarize it is illusory, although it does not mean that it is an impossible challenge. It is essential to read a natal chart several times in order to absorb all its different meanings and to grasp all this complexity. But the exercise is worthwhile.\n\nIn brief, a natal chart is composed of ten planets: two luminaries, the Sun and the Moon, three fast-moving or individual planets, Mercury, Venus and Mars, two slow-moving planets, Jupiter and Saturn, and three very slow-moving planets, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. Additional secondary elements are: the Lunar Nodes, the Dark Moon or Lilith, Chiron and other minor objects. They are all posited on the Zodiac wheel consisting of twelve signs, from Aries to Pisces, and divided into twelve astrological houses.\n\nThe first step is to evaluate the importance of each planet. This is what we call identifying the dominant planets. This process obeys rules that depend on the astrologer's sensitivity and experience but it also has precise and steady bases: thus, we can take into account the parameters of a planet's activity (the number of active aspects a planet forms, the importance of each aspect according to its nature and its exactness), angularity parameters; (proximity to the four angles, Ascendant, Midheaven, Descendant and Imum Coeli or Nadir, all of them being evaluated numerically, according to the kind of angle and the planet-angle distance) and quality parameters (rulership, exaltation, exile and fall). Finally, other criteria such as the rulership of the Ascendant and the Midheaven etc. are important.\n\nThese different criteria allow a planet to be highlighted and lead to useful conclusions when interpreting the chart.\n\nThe overall chart analysis begins with the observation of three sorts of planetary distributions in the chart: Eastern or Western hemisphere, Northern or Southern hemisphere, and quadrants (North-eastern, North-western, South-eastern and South-western). These three distributions give a general tone in terms of introversion and extraversion, willpower, sociability, and behavioural predispositions.\n\nThen, there are three additional distributions: elements (called triplicity since there are three groups of signs for each one) - Fire, Air, Earth and Water - corresponding to a character typology, modality (or quadruplicity with four groups of signs for each one) - Cardinal, Fixed and Mutable - and polarity (Yin and Yang).\n\nThere are three types of dominants: dominant planets, dominant signs and dominant houses. The novice thinks astrology means only \"to be Aries\" or sometimes, for example, \"to be Aries Ascendant Virgo\". It is actually far more complex. Although the Sun and the Ascendant alone may reveal a large part of the character - approximately a third or a half of your psychological signature, a person is neither \"just the Sun\" (called the sign) nor just \"the first house\" (the Ascendant). Thus, a particular planet's influence may be significantly increased; a particular sign or house may contain a group of planets that will bring nuances and sometimes weaken the role of the Ascendant, of the Sun sign etc.\n\nLastly, there are two other criteria: accentuations (angular, succedent and cadent) which are a classification of astrological houses and types of decanates that are occupied (each sign is divided into three decanates of ten degrees each). They provide some additional informations.\n\nThese general character traits must not be taken literally; they are, somehow, preparing for the chart reading. They allow to understand the second part of the analysis, which is more detailed and precise. It focuses on every area of the personality and provides a synthesis of all the above-mentioned parameters according to sound hierarchical rules.\n\nAstrological Quadrants for Marisa Pavan\n\nEach quadrant is a combination of the four hemispheres of your birth chart and relates to a character typology. The Southern hemisphere  the top of your chart, around the Midheaven  is associated with extraversion, action, and public life, whereas the Northern hemisphere prompts to introversion, reflexion, and private life. The Eastern hemisphere  the left part, around the Ascendant  is linked to your ego and your willpower, whereas the Western hemisphere indicates how other people influence you, and how flexible you are when you make a decision.\n\nMarisa Pavan, the diurnal South-western quadrant, consisting of the 7th, 8th and 9th houses, prevails in your chart: this sector brings about a thirst for communication and sometimes, a need to take risks in your dealings with others. Relations are a factor of your evolution and your transformation, which you accept serenely. Indeed, what matters to you is the movement and the energy that link you to others and that make you gain more awareness. A kind of rebellion or a desire to get away from it all is rooted in you.\n\nElements, Modes and House Accentuations for Marisa Pavan\n\nMarisa Pavan, here are the graphs of your Elements and Modes, based on planets' position and angles in the twelve signs:\n\nLike the majority of Earth signs, Marisa Pavan, you are efficient, concrete and not too emotional. What matters to you is what you see: you judge the tree by its fruits. Your ideas keep changing, words disappear, but actions and their consequences are visible and remain. Express your sensitivity, even if it means revealing your vulnerability. Emotions, energy and communication must not be neglected; concrete action is meaningless if it is not justified by your heart, your intellect or your enthusiasm.\n\nMarisa Pavan, Fire is dominant in your natal chart and endows you with intuition, energy, courage, self-confidence, and enthusiasm! You are inclined to be passionate, you assert your willpower, you move forward, and come hell or high water, you achieve your dreams and your goals. The relative weakness of this element is the difficulty to step back or a kind of boldness that may prompt you to do foolish things.\n\nThe twelve zodiacal signs are split up into three groups or modes, called quadruplicities, a learned word meaning only that these three groups include four signs. The Cardinal, Fixed and Mutable modes are more or less represented in your natal chart, depending on planets' positions and importance, and on angles in the twelve signs.\n\nMarisa Pavan, the Cardinal mode is dominant here and indicates a predisposition to action, and more exactly, to impulsion and to undertake: you are very keen to implement the plans you have in mind, to get things going and to create them. This is the most important aspect that inspires enthusiasm and adrenalin in you, without which you can grow weary rapidly. You are individualistic (maybe too much?) and assertive. You let others strengthen and improve the constructions which you built with fervour.\n\nHouses are split up into three groups: angular, succedent and cadent.\n\nThe first ones are the most important ones, the most \"noticeable\" and energetic houses. They are the 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th houses. Their cuspides correspond to four famous angles: Ascendant for the 1st house, Imum Coeli for the 4th house, Descendant, opposite the Ascendant, for the 7th house and Midheaven for the 10th house, opposite the Imum Coeli.\n\nPlanets are evaluated according to a whole set of criteria that includes comprehensive Western astrology rules. At their turn, planets emphasize specific types of houses, signs, repartitions etc., as previously explained.\n\nThe emphasis is on succedent houses in your chart, namely, the 2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th houses, Marisa Pavan: this configuration usually endows a personality with affective and sensitive qualities. Obviously, to the detriment of self-confidence or self-assertion, but your heart qualities may be very important. These houses also favour realization. Time and patience are part of their characteristics. However, they are only indications and you must include them in the rest of your chart in order to see whether they are validated or not!\n\nN.B.: this dominant is a minor one.\n\nDominants: Planets, Signs and Houses for Marisa Pavan\n\nThe issue of dominant planets has existed since the mists of time in astrology: how nice it would be if a person could be described with a few words and one or several planets that would represent their character, without having to analyse such elements as rulerships, angularities, houses, etc!\n\nThe ten planets - the Sun throughout Pluto - are a bit like ten characters in a role-play, each one has its own personality, its own way of acting, its own strengths and weaknesses. They actually represent a classification into ten distinct personalities, and astrologers have always tried to associate one or several dominant planets to a natal chart as well as dominant signs and houses.\n\nIndeed, it is quite the same situation with signs and houses. If planets symbolize characters, signs represent hues - the mental, emotional and physical structures of an individual. The sign in which a planet is posited is like a character whose features are modified according to the place where he lives. In a chart, there are usually one, two or three highlighted signs that allow to rapidly describe its owner.\n\nRegarding astrological houses, the principle is even simpler: the twelve houses correspond to twelve fields of life, and planets tenanting any given house increase that house's importance and highlight all relevant life departments: it may be marriage, work, friendship etc.\n\nIn your natal chart, Marisa Pavan, the ten main planets are distributed as follows:\n\nThe three most important planets in your chart are Mercury, Jupiter and Mars.\n\nWith Mercury among your dominant planets, you are certainly cerebral, nervous, swift, curious, quick-witted, and you love to communicate. Your psychological pattern is intellectual, all the more so since Mercury is important, with its whole set of assets but also of weaknesses, obviously.\n\nYour sensitivity, emotions, and heart's impulses give precedence to thinking, which can lead people to believe that you are a playful and witty but heartless person, intellectualizing situations and juggling with words and numbers whilst ignoring human aspects of things. Of course, it is said that cats always land on their feet - this is your Mercurian strength and your trump card!\n\nYour weakness lies in your nervousness, and you may miss your goal because of your \"over-intellectualization\" that may be detrimental to other kind of energies such as instinct, spontaneity, heart, sensitivity, etc.\n\nJupiter, the planet of expansion, organization, power and benevolence, is quite emphasized in your chart. Like any Jupiterian, you are warm, open, sociable, consensual, active and optimistic. You can use your self-confidence to erase differences of opinion, and you leave the task of analyzing and perfecting things to specialists. Your role, and you know it since you were young, is to gather, to demonstrate your synthesizing and conciliatory mind, and to naturally reap its fruits - power.\n\nYou appreciate legality, social order but also order in general. With you as a leader, every plan or human entity can be organized and structured. You excel at supervising. The Jupiterian type is indeed the politician par excellence, and a positive Jupiter in your chart is synonymous with good integration into society, whatever the chosen path.\n\nIs this idyllic picture really perfect? Certainly not: each planet's typology has its own weaknesses. One of yours is pride, like the Solarian, but your will of expansion at all costs may generate a form of exaggeration in everything, endless pleasure, inappropriate self-confidence that could lead you to rough materialism and the thirst for absurd material comfort - in the worst cases, of course.\n\nMars is one of your dominant planets and provides you with its efficient energy and enthusiasm: with a powerful Mars in your chart, action - but also will and ability to undertake - is not an empty word for you. You are active, dynamic, willing to fight, courageous, and you are never afraid to move mountains, even though risks are part of the adventures that you start with determination.\n\nHowever, your patience is not always up to your boldness and a kind of feverishness, or even anger, can tarnish the quality of your achievements. That would be a pity since the Marsian is a champion in matters of efficiency! Mars symbolizes display of action, conquering spirit that favours discipline and order - beware of not being fussy - and lies at the frontier between action and brutality, between conquest and potential aggressiveness.\n\nIn your natal chart, the three most important signs - according to criteria mentioned above - are in decreasing order of strength Cancer, Sagittarius and Taurus. In general, these signs are important because your Ascendant or your Sun is located there. But this is not always the case: there may be a cluster of planets, or a planet may be near an angle other than the Midheaven or Ascendant. It may also be because two or three planets are considered to be very active because they form numerous aspects from these signs.\n\nThus, you display some of the three signs' characteristics, a bit like a superposition of features on the rest of your chart, and it is all the more so if the sign is emphasized.\n\nCancer is one of your dominant signs and endows you with imagination and exceptionally shrewd sensitivity. Although suspicious at first sight - and even at second...- as soon as you get familiar with people and let them win your confidence, your golden heart eventually shows up, despite your discretion and your desire for security that makes you return into your shell at the slightest alert! Actually, you are a poetess and if you are sometimes blamed for your nostalgia and your laziness, it is because your intense inner life is at full throttle...\n\nSagittarius, an adventurous and conquering fire sign, is dominant in your chart: you are enthusiastic, enterprising, optimistic, very sociable, and mobile - you have itchy feet both physically and mentally. Nobody gets bored with you because you are always planning things and suggesting excursions, at least... when you are around and not already gone on a trip! Obviously, so many movements for one woman may scare people off, and some of them may even criticize your brutality or your tendency to loose your temper, but you are so warm and genuine, so expansive, isn't this a good thing? And all the more so, since your sense of humour is overwhelming...\n\nWith the Taurus sign so important in your chart, you are constructive, stable, and sensual. Good taste, sense of beauty, manners, and unfailing good sense - all these qualities contribute to your charm and seductive power. Furthermore, if some people criticize your slow pace and your stubbornness, you rightly reply that this is the price for your security, and that you like the way it is - slow and steady....\n\nThe 7th, 8th and 2nd houses are the most prominent ones in your birth chart. From the analysis of the most tenanted houses, the astrologer identifies your most significant fields or spheres of activity. They deal with what you are experiencing - or what you will be brought to experience one day - or they deal with your inner motivations.\n\nYour 7th house is one of your dominant houses: it symbolizes other people, marriages, associations, contracts, and partnerships. Your personal achievement and maybe your problems - depending on the rest of your chart - are strongly influenced by your rapports with others, the area in which you tend to commit yourself deeply. You appreciate communication, and you give importance to others' opinions. Success requires the support of others, which seems obvious and natural to you. Your marriage generally contributes to your fulfilment.\n\nYour 8th house is very highlighted: it is the most complex house of the Zodiac. It symbolizes above all passion and transformation, which often go hand in hand. Indeed, you have a tendency to experience everything to the bitter end, and you overstep propriety borders because you want to understand everything, even what is... forbidden. This house relates to complex spheres such as sexuality, possessions and dispossessions that don't depend on you (inheritances, donations, sudden financial losses), death too - not yours in particular, so, don't worry! - and understanding of hidden or occult things: here are the fields that affect you generally, because you are naturally interested in them or because life gets you involved in spite of yourself.\n\nThe 2nd house is among your three most tenanted houses: life's material aspects - with everything that is implied in terms of security, appetite for life, desire for possession - are deep-seated and you can never be content with living on love and fresh air. On a more abstract level, you may have similar feelings regarding relationships: possessiveness and jealousy in the worst cases, but also faithfulness and durability.\n\nAfter this paragraph about dominant planets, of Marisa Pavan, here are the character traits that you must read more carefully than the previous texts since they are very specific: the texts about dominant planets only give background information about the personality and remain quite general: they emphasize or, on the contrary, mitigate different particularities or facets of a personality. A human being is a complex whole and only bodies of texts can attempt to successfully figure out all the finer points.\n\nThe Moon in Capricorn and in House 2: her sensitivity\n\nYour sensitivity is withdrawn, Marisa Pavan: more than anyone, you tend to lock yourself in your ivory tower, as you are aware of a kind of superiority that may be real, though overrated. Your moods are not perceptible because you control them with a tight fist. It is difficult to know if you are happy or upset because you show nothing. You avoid situations which compel you to reveal your emotions because you are not demonstrative. Please, be aware that it is not your amorous behaviour that is being analyzed, but the daily expression of your sensitivity. You dread the crowd and you need calm, and even solitude, to feel comfortable. You are well-equipped to remain balanced in all circumstances, but it may prove beneficial if you progressively take a relaxed attitude and show more dedication, as you are worth it; it is easier for you to exteriorize your feelings when your projects or your ambitions justify that you do so. You do not practice gratuitous outpourings, particularly when your are with a group, because you are afraid to open up, as if you were on the defensive, without any reason most of the times.\n\nMaterial affairs can have an importance disconnected from reality, Marisa Pavan: you tend to be very emotional about practical matters related to your personal interests. Maybe you unconsciously fear some kind of shortage. You seek financial security, however, it may prove counterproductive if you display too much sensitivity... (excerpt)\n\nMercury in Cancer and in House 7: her intellect and social life\n\nYour intelligence is sensitive and delicate, with good comprehension abilities, Marisa Pavan, which endows you with a strong intuition and receptivity. To you, impressions and feelings prevail over facts and your excellent selective memory is not cluttered with useless elements. Although you are not aware, your fertile imagination may lead you to change your daily reality so that it matches your dreams better. If you are creative, you may make use of your imagination in literary pursuits where you can freely invent beautiful stories taking place in the past. Your passion for History is such that you may immerse yourself into it with too much nostalgia and therefore, you may miss opportunities the present offers to design projects and to think of the future.\n\nCommunication is your forte, Marisa Pavan: you will use your entire intelligence efficiently in order to achieve agreements, compromises, or contracts. You are a born negotiator, or at least, that's what you try to be because you are not mentally self-centred and your thoughts are more aimed... (excerpt)\n\nVenus in Cancer and in House 8, and the Sun in Gemini: her affectivity and seductiveness\n\nIn your chart, the Sun is in Gemini and Venus, in Cancer. It is difficult to imagine a more complementary  and opposite  combination of solar and Venusian signs. Gemini discovers, whereas Cancer integrates. The former implies a communication function and the latter, a protection function. It influences your affectivity with the paradoxical character proper to any double-faced configuration: love is just a game, but a trapping game. There is a strong inclination for novelty, comedy and whims. Without these ingredients, your love life would be very dull. You respond to flirting and to the entertainments offered by your seduction. However, you do not allow everybody into your affective realm. This is a restricted and valued area. Indeed, despite appearances, despite your real capacity to exchange and to communicate, your affectivity is particularly selective and you are comfortable only with people whom you know well and with whom you naturally feel in harmony. You may get caught in your own traps: your ever searching soul, your eagerness for experiences and discoveries, but also, your need for a slowly maturing, isolated and privileged relationship. In addition, you have a very unusual romantic trend that flavours your sentimental life with salt, sugar and pepper.\n\nYou are sensitive, vulnerable and tender at the same time, Marisa Pavan. When you love, you give your entire affection and your partner may in all confidence rely on a long-lasting and reassuring relationship. You are so calm and so tender that you think that it is enough to win over your partner's heart, and you are often right. However, do not mix up giving and receiving. You so deeply need to receive love in return that you may be too passive and in the long run, as you become demanding, you may show immaturity. Security and sustainability in your relationship are of utmost importance. Your family also is important, it is the refuge, even the sanctuary, where you like you hide when things go awry. You also dream of love, may be too much, and it may be detrimental to what might be concretely experienced if you were more dynamic or less fearful to get hurt. However, remember that you receive only as much as you give.\n\nWhen you fall in love, Marisa Pavan, your feelings immediately reach a considerable level of intensity and quickly take you into the realm of passion. You are not a mild person when it comes to love, either you love deeply, or not at all. According to the... (excerpt)\n\nThe Ascendant is in Sagittarius and the ruler of the Ascendant is Jupiter, in Leo: her behaviour\n\nPsychologically speaking, your nature is extroverted and independent, oriented towards expansion and sociability. You have the soul of a leader, energetic and active. Your charisma and your drive are fully integrated into the collective life. Indeed, as an action-oriented fire sign, you challenge yourself and you succeed in accomplishing the task straight away. Sagittarius is hard to follow because his spirit and his independent mind constantly prompt him to go further and higher.\n\nAs you are born under this sign, you are charismatic, fiery, energetic, likeable, benevolent, tidy, jovial, optimistic, extroverted, amusing, straightforward, demonstrative, charming, independent, adventurous, straightforward, bold, exuberant, freedom-loving. But you may also be irascible, selfish, authoritarian, inconsistent, unfaithful, brutal, unreliable, reckless, tactless or unpleasant.\n\nIn love, Madam, you are a whirlwind made of life and warmth. You are mobile, cheerful, extroverted, always feeling comfortable and dynamic, a freedom-lover who appreciates variety. Had you not been so sane and so benevolent, you would have been mistaken for an Amazon of the mythological era.\n\nYou are pleasant to deal with, as long as your partner accepts your desire to constantly move. You are not fussy, you are lively, with numerous centres of interest. You often take the initiative in your amorous encounters that are likely to take place during your holidays or business trips. With you, no tragedies, no complication no questioning! You fully enjoy the present moment when you are around, unless you are already in your plane, flying towards new adventures\n\nOnce you calm down, you will be a wonderful wife and mother. You will set up a home and start a family where your husband and your children will move with you as often as possible during school holidays. You may also move into a different city or a different country, because of professional changes.\n\nBecause Sagittarius is a dual sign, it may happen that you marry more than once, if your needs for freedom and mobility, which are so important to you, are not fully met.\n\nThe ruler of the Ascendant, also referred to as the chart ruler, brings a few interesting nuances to the meanings provided by the Sun and the Ascendant. The sign in which the ruler of the Ascendant is posited fine-tunes the style of personality described by the Sun and the Ascendant. It may strengthen it if the sign is identical to either of them.\n\nThe ruler of the Ascendant, Marisa Pavan, is Jupiter. In the sign of Leo, it may endow you with authority and a certain inclination for prestige. Generous and noble, you loathe pettiness. You are not aware that you sometimes irritate the members of your entourage because of your excessive pride or your self-centredness.\n\nThe Sun in Gemini and in House 7: her will and inner motivations\n\nYour mobility is such that you are in every place where you are not expected. You spend lots of time asking questions and answering them. Your curiosity and your quick-wittedness are insatiable. Your mind is in constant turmoil, hopping from one topic to another, solving problems, accumulating anecdotes and knowledge within a short range of time. Your mobility is mostly mental, it takes you afar and turns your daily life into a mosaic of intense and pleasant moments that are not necessarily related to one another\n\nAs you are born under this sign, you are nervous, expressive, lively and adaptable, with a quick mind and a good sense of humour. You are bubbling, playful, sociable, clever, curious, whimsical, independent, intellectual, flexible, ingenious, fanciful, imaginative, charming, cerebral, and you are into everything. You may also be whimsical, unfocused, quirky, superficial, indiscreet, opportunist, unmindful, selfish, sarcastic or mercurial.\n\nIn love, Madam, you are full of intelligence and liveliness. You are so subtle, so whimsical, that you could be seen as a teaser because you can seduce in any situation. The more complex they are, the more numerous the contacts, the better.\n\nAmong all the Zodiacal signs, you are the outstanding one who can manage several simultaneous love affairs. It is not a matter of vice, but only of voluptuous pleasure of the instant. If they do not take place at the same time, your amorous encounters may be short-lived. But their number is very considerable because you constantly want to keep boredom and monotony at bay and you frantically run away from any source of peace and calm.\n\nYou will probably marry more than once. For you, the Sun symbolizes first the father then the husband: Gemini being a double sign, and your father being unique, it is likely that you will have two or more husbands. However, this is not a fatality and the rest of your chart can easily tell you more.\n\nTo assert yourself, Marisa Pavan, you cannot rest until you multiply your contacts. Although you do not consciously understand your ambition early in life, you need to shine through your relationships.\n\nIt may take the form of a tendency to rapidly get involved in associations, groups... (excerpt)\n\nMars in Taurus and in House 6: her ability to take action\n\nMarisa Pavan, the way you take action gains in power and in precision what it loses in rapidity and spontaneity. You are slow, certainly. But when you get started, you put all your ingenuity and your persistence into it and you love to see a job well done. At the end of the day, owing to your ways, you are the winner. In your sex life, similarly, you are generous and instinctive and your slowness is not an obstacle. It may even bring fulfilment to you, but above all, to your partner! In love, as well as in your exchanges in general, you tend to keep your worries to yourself because you are extremely patient; you don't say anything, you stand all the hits and one day, you explode into outbursts of anger that are as violent as they are rare, thanks God.\n\nIt is in the area of your work environment that you are most active and pugnacious, Marisa Pavan. Or in your daily life, if you do not work. You are a hard-worker, completely dedicated to the service of others: being helpful and efficient is your battle horse. Indeed,... (excerpt)\n\nConclusion\n\nThis text is only an excerpt from of Marisa Pavan's portrait. If you want to get your own astrological portrait, much more comprehensive that this present excerpt, you can order it at this page. Do you belong to the Jupiterian type, benevolent and generous? The Martian type, active and a go-getter? The Venusian type, charming and seductive? The Lunar type, imaginative and sensitive? The Solar type, noble and charismatic? The Uranian type, original, uncompromising and a freedom-lover? The Plutonian type, domineering and secretive? The Mercurian type, cerebral, inquiring and quick? The Neptunian type, visionary, capable of empathy and impressionable? The Saturnian type, profound, persevering and responsible? Are you more of the Fire type, energetic and intuitive? The Water type, sentimental and receptive? The Earth type, realistic and efficient? Or the Air type, gifted in communication and highly intellectual? 11 planetary dominants and 57 characteristics are reviewed, quantified, and interpreted; then, your psychological portrait is described in detail, in a comprehensive document of approximately 32-36 pages, full of engrossing and original pieces of information about yourself.\n\nAstrological reports describe many of the character traits and they sometimes go deeper into the understanding of a personality. Please, always keep in mind that human beings are continuously evolving and that many parts of our psychological structures are likely to be expressed later, after having undergone significant life's experiences. It is advised to read a portrait with hindsight in order to appreciate its astrological content. Under this condition, you will be able to take full advantage of this type of study.\n\nThe analysis of an astrological portrait consists in understanding four types of elements which interact with one another: ten planets, twelve zodiacal signs, twelve houses, and what are called aspects between planets (the 11 aspects most commonly used are: conjunction, opposition, square, trine, sextile, quincunx, semi-sextile, sesqui-quadrate, quintile and bi-quintile. The first 5 aspects enumerated are called major aspects).\n\nPlanets represent typologies of our human psychology: sensitivity, affectivity, ability to undertake, will-power, mental process, aptitude, and taste for communication etc., all independent character facets are divided here for practical reasons. The twelve signs forming the space where planets move will \"colour\", so to speak, these typologies with each planet being located in its particular sign. They will then enrich the quality of these typologies, as expressed by the planets. The Zodiac is also divided into twelve astrological houses. This makes sense only if the birth time is known because within a few minutes, the twelve houses (including the 1st one, the Ascendant) change significantly. They correspond to twelve specific spheres of life: external behaviour, material, social and family life, relationship, home, love life, daily work, partnership, etc. Each planet located in any given house will then act according to the meaning of its house, and a second colouration again enriches those active forces that the planets symbolize. Finally, relations will settle among planets, creating a third structure, which completes the planets' basic meanings. A set of ancient rules, which has stood the test of experience over hundreds of years (although astrology is in evolution, only reliable elements are integrated into classical studies), are applied to organize the whole chart into a hierarchy and to allow your personality to be interpreted by texts. The planets usually analysed are the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, which means two luminaries (the Sun and the Moon) and 8 planets, a total of 10 planets. Additional secondary elements may be taken into account, such as asteroids Chiron, Vesta, Pallas, Ceres (especially Chiron, more well-known), the Lunar nodes, the Dark Moon or Lilith, and even other bodies: astrology is a discipline on the move. Astrological studies, including astrological portrait, compatibility of couples, predictive work, and horoscopes evolve and become more accurate or deeper, as time goes by.\n\nPrecision: concerning the horoscopes with a known time of birth, according to the Tradition, we consider that a planet near the beginning (called cuspide) of the next house (less than 2 degrees for the Ascendant and the Midheaven, and less than 1 degree for all other houses) belongs to this house: our texts and dominants take this rule into account. You can also choose not to take this shift into account in the form, and also tick the option Koch or Equal houses system instead of Placidus, the default houses system.\n\nWarning: In order to avoid any confusion and any possible controversy, we want to draw your attention upon the fact that this sample of celebrities is very complete and therefore, it also includes undesirable people, since every category is represented: beside artists, musicians, politicians, lawyers, professional soldiers, poets, writers, singers, explorers, scientists, academics, religious figures, saints, philosophers, sages, astrologers, mediums, sportsmen, chess champions, famous victims, historical characters, members of royal families, models, painters, sculptors, and comics authors or other actual celebrities, there are also famous murderers, tyrants and dictators, serial-killers, or other characters whose image is very negative, often rightly so.\n\nRegarding the latter, it must be remembered that even a monster or at least a person who perpetrated odious crimes, has some human qualities, often noticed by his/her close entourage: these excerpts come from computer programmes devoid of polemical intentions and may seem too soft or lenient. The positive side of each personality is deliberately stressed. Negative sides have been erased here - it is not the same in our comprehensive reports on sale - because it could hurt the families of such people. We are hoping that it will not rebound on the victims' side.\n\nNumerology: Birth Path of Marisa Pavan\n\nTestimonies to numerology are found in the most ancient civilizations and show that numerology pre-dates astrology. This discipline considers the name, the surname, and the date of birth, and ascribes a meaning to alphabetic letters according to the numbers which symbolise them.\n\nThe path of life, based on the date of birth, provides indications on the kind of destiny which one is meant to experience. It is one of the elements that must reckoned with, along with the expression number, the active number, the intimacy number, the achievement number, the hereditary number, the dominant numbers or the lacking numbers, or also the area of expression, etc.\n\nYour Life Path is influenced by the number 4, Marisa, and your destiny implies sustained efforts, long-drawn-out works, and concrete achievements. The path may seem a bit tedious, but it is very promising, provided that you demonstrate some tenacity, loyalty, and patience. You are often invited to display orderly and methodical qualities, and step-by-step, you go through all the stages which may lead you to success, if you do not let hurdles dishearten you throughout your life. Persistence is among your major qualities. You see life as a challenge, and, far from falling into the trap of picking the easy way out, you face problems with calm and lucidity, and you choose the work and steady effort which open the door to success, although evolution requires quite a long time. Your personal path is based on continuous efforts and on maintaining the same immutable direction.\n\nMarisa Pavan was born under the sign of the Monkey, element Water\n\nChinese astrology is brought to us as a legacy of age-old wisdom and invites us to develop an awareness of our inner potential. It is believed that the wise man is not subjected to stellar influences. However, we must gain the lucidity and the distance without which we remain locked up in an implacable destiny. According to the legend of the Circle of Animals, Buddha summoned all the animals to bid them farewell before he left our world. Only twelve species answered Buddha's call. They form the Chinese Zodiac and symbolize the twelve paths of wisdom that are still valid nowadays.\n\nThe Asian wise man considers that a path is neither good nor bad. One can and must develop one's potentialities. The first step is to thoroughly know oneself.\n\nThe Monkey has a wide range of expressions, from idle chat - although enriching - to the gift for observation. People have thousands of facets, thousands of masks to wear according to the circumstances and the fortunes of life. You live as an observer eager for novelties, discoveries and surprises.\n\nEverything catches your attention, everything is a pretext for encounters, relationships and learning. The world amazes you, it amuses you sometimes and arouses your curiosity. Because the essentials remain to be discovered and each new situation is full of potentialities, you strive to fill the gaps in your knowledge.\n\nThere is a \"snooper\" side in you, a curiosity that may turn into indiscretion. In spite of the fact that your broad-mindedness may scatter your centres of interest, it also allows you to carefully avoid restricting your manner to an immutable, unique and rigid discourse. A faint sign is all you need to perceive what is going on underneath it all, as well as the infinite complexity of people and situations. Thus, on the human plane, you seek dialogue and the information indispensable to really understand the nature of the other one.\n\nYou are a diplomat and a schemer and, better than anyone else, you can avoid all traps and you take action behind the scenes. Your extravagant character actually conceals a deep perception of people and situations.\n\nChinese astrology has five elements, which are referred to as agents: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal and Water.\n\nYou have a deep affinity with the agent Water. In China, this element corresponds to the planet Mercury, the black colour and the number 6.\n\nYou are particularly sensitive to your surroundings, the atmosphere of a place and the climate of a meeting. Your high receptivity allows you to perceive naturally the stakes underlying people and situations.\n\nYou are reserved by nature, you favour emotions and inner life, leaving challenges and audacity to other people. You frequently maintain a certain distance and you share your true feelings with few intimate friends only. It is probably because you know that genuine communication is a difficult exercise.\n\nEverything in your realm is sheer subtlety and nuance. The danger is that you may escape realities and indulge in indolence without fulfilling your responsibilities. This is the other side of the coin of your extraordinary sensitivity and your exceptional clear-sightedness.\n\nYou feel in tune with few people. However, this selectivity forges relationships that are long-lasting because they are natural and genuine.\n\nN. B.: when the birth time is unknown, (12:00 PM (unknown)), these portrait excerpts do not take into account the parameters derived from the time, which means, the domification (Ascendant, astrological houses, etc.). Nonetheless, these analyses remain accurate in any case. Regarding the sources of the birth data in our possession, kindly note that the pages we publish constitute a starting point for more detailed research, even though they seem useful to us. When the sources are contradictory, which occurs rarely, after having analysed them, we choose the most reliable one. Sometimes, we publish a birth date just because it is made available, but we do not claim that is it the best one, by no means."
