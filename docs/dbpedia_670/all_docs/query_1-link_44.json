        "text": "Marisa Pavan (born Maria Luisa Pierangeli; 19 June 1932) is an Italian-born actress who first became famous as the twin sister of film star Pier Angeli (Anna Maria Pierangeli) before achieving film stardom on her own. Her breakthrough came in the film The Rose Tattoo (1955) as Anna Magnani's daughter; her role was first assigned to her twin, who at the time was unable to play the part. When Magnani won the Academy Award for Best Actress, Pavan accepted on her behalf as Magnani was not present at the awards ceremony. Pavan was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, losing to Jo Van Fleet (for East of Eden). Both Magnani and Pavan won Golden Globe Awards that year. Afterwards, Pavan co-starred in films such as Diane (1956), The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit (1956), The Midnight Story (1957) and John Paul Jones (1959). She also played Abishag in King Vidor's biblical epic Solomon and Sheba (1959). Her later films included A Slightly Pregnant Man (1973) and the television miniseries The Moneychangers (1976). Pavan married French actor Jean-Pierre Aumont. The two were married from 1956 until his death in 2001. They had two sons."
