I loved every bit of Poor Things. The cinematography was absolutely astounding. The crazy wide angle, even fish eye, lens add a claustrophobic feeling all while exhibiting the amazing art department. The use of color was thematic and was used 100% for the story. Making the whole world fantastic and supernatural. Absolutely beautiful movie.

The acting was top notch. Emma Stone gets the chance to create Bella Baxter and runs wild with it. Ruffalo gives one of his most entertaining turns. Willem Dafoe is always amazing. Lanthimos gets to the most direct vein of a character with a dark wit that his films are always interesting to watch.

The most impactful aspect of this movie is the direction of the whole thing. Tony McNamara and Alasdair Gray have created a monster of a story and Yorgos Lanthimos gets to teach it how to speak. His vision of each film he makes is so uniquely Lanthimos-ian (sp?) and a real treasure to watch.

It did feel a bit long though.
