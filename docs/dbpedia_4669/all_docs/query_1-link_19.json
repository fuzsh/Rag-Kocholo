        "text": "No art operates a lower barrier to entry than rock’n’roll – it’s the form’s greatest strength, and greatest weakness. Where every other mode of expression insists upon years of education, rehearsal and refinement before you inflict yourself on the public, rock’n’roll will cheerfully wave through anyone who has managed to beg, borrow, steal – or even save up honestly for and buy – an electric guitar. Mostly, this lackadaisical open door policy ushers in unlistenable racket. Just occasionally, it permits a bunch of hairy teenagers from Melbourne, who can barely play a lick between them, to make one of the best singles ever made by anyone, anywhere, anytime.\n\nGod’s My Pal first appeared as a run of 500 seven-inch singles on Melbourne indie label Au Go Go in 1987, amidst what was an astonishingly fecund period for underground music in Australia. Even by the rarefied standards of the era, however, My Pal made an impact, at least among the tiny but then-blessed proportion of Australia’s population that paid much attention to Melbourne indie labels. It seems a fair bet that most people heard My Pal first the way I did, when someone known to (but cooler than) them said “You have GOT to hear this,” and sat them firmly down in front of their record player.\n\nThe reaction, as I noted when subsequently paying this favour forward myself, was always a combination of amazement and amusement. My Pal was, and is, both astonishing and ridiculous. It’s an almost impudently sublime song, a frothy, poppy, punky thrash evocative of everything that was ever wonderful about the Stooges, AC/DC, Buzzcocks, Husker Du and early Replacements, anchored by an irresistible five-note riff that nagged and nagged even though there was no chance at all you didn’t hear it the first time.\n\nAnd it’s a fantastically ramshackle performance and recording, as if God had just written My Pal that afternoon and could only afford exactly the three minutes and 21 seconds of studio time necessary to lash it onto tape. But – and this was the important bit – the fluffed and missed notes, the fact that everyone was playing like there was a prize for finishing first, didn’t matter at all. Indeed, even contemplating what a polished, produced version of My Pal might have sounded like still feels vaguely sacrilegious (although the thought strikes that the Eastern Dark’s glorious Ramones-meet-the-Beach-Boys I Don’t Need The Reasons, though released a year earlier, is close).\n\nThe thrill of My Pal was amplified, at the time, by the deadpan audacity of God’s choice of name, and by the fact that nobody seemed to have much of a clue who they actually were. It eventually became known that they were four kids from Melbourne, fronted by one Joel Silbersher, who later claimed to have composed My Pal in the shower one morning before school. Their A&R outreach had consisted of going to Au Go Go’s shop, where they were regular customers, and handing a cassette of what they had wrought to the proprietor, Bruce Milne. They gigged sporadically, and made one EP, (1988’s Rock Is Hell), one album (1989’s For Lovers Only), and broke up shortly thereafter. Two of God, guitarist Sean Greenway and bass player Tim Hemensley, died of heroin overdoses in the early 2000s. Silbersher has since made fine records on his own, with Hoss, and with Tex Perkins and the Dark Horses, among others."
