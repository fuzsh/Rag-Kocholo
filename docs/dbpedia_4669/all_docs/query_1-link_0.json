        "text": "Last updated May 4th, 2015\n\nAfter going through 700 lbs of My Pal God discs returned to New Jersey from Chicago, very limited quantities of numerous long-thought out of print MPG titles are back in stock. Check the catalogue page to see what's available again. These are the last of the last. When they're gone, they're not coming back.\n\nIn addition to these archival finds, many records we released have been slashed in price for the foreseeable future. Order away!\n\nFinally, we're in the process of switching servers and updating our ordering system. If you come across broken links, please let us know.\n\nThe debut disc by Philadelphia MCs THE YMD, \"Excuse Me, This Is The Yah Mos Def\" [mpg062], is the sound of dingy punk clubs and parking lot freestyle battles. Manic, breathless, raw and dope. Released February 12th, 2008. Order a copy here.\n\nMy Pal God returns from a year-long hibernation to release the third album by Chicago's DEL REY. \"A Pyramid For The Living\" [mpg063] is a swirling din of hypnotic rhythms, heroic riffs, and snaking, angular melodies. a cosmic opus that features the band's most epic and aggressive storytelling to date. Released September 26, 2006. Order a copy here.\n\nI do a weekly radio show on WPRB. Wednesday from 5:00 pm - 8:00 pm ET is my timeslot. Tune in if you get the chance, either using your stereo [103.3 fm all the way from Northern New Jersey through Philadelphia] or the Internet [available using Real Player and iTunes]. If you would like to get weekly emails about special guests, giveaways and live performances on this radio program, you can sign up for the radio show mailing list.\n\nThanks,\n\nJon Solomon\n\nPrinceton, New Jersey"
