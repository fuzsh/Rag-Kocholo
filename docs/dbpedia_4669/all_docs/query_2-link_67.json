        "text": "With legions of fans on both sides of the Atlantic, singer Judith Owen has a simmering sound that marries a myriad of genres from rock and pop, to classical, jazz, blues, and more. Her latest release Come On & Get It has made a splash worldwide. Get to know her and hear her live at the Django on Saturday April 13.\n\nYour current album Come On & Get It is striking a chord with listeners worldwide. What’s different on this one?\n\nIt’s a celebration of the unapologetic and mostly unsung ladies of ‘40s and ‘50s jazz and blues, whose music and stories are still relevant and gloriously joyful, 70 years on, particularly to a young audience who are discovering these delicious songs for the first time. Most of my albums have been self-penned, but this is a deep dive into the music and the women I grew up loving and being inspired by. I’m overjoyed that with millions of streams, this album has helped reawaken an interest in these extraordinary women\n\nRumor has it the genesis was inspiration drawn from your Dad’s record collection – what did you find there?\n\nHe was the most unusual opera singer – being such a jazz and blues lover, and this mix musically shaped me as a kid. So in between the Chopin and Puccini and Rachmaninov, were the collectors 45s of these “unapologetic ladies” – Nellie Lutcher, Julia Lee, Pearl Bailey, Blossom Dearie, Julie London, Peggy Lee, Dinah Washington. I remember first hearing Lutcher’s wickedly wonderful ‘Fine brown Frame’ and feeling like the sun had just come out – it was that life affirming. So I’d say that I’m a hybrid of classical and jazz, and the blend feels natural to me. It’s all one language, just different accents!\n\nThe album was recorded in New Orleans. What is it about that city that enchants you so?\n\nI moved to NOLA full time with my husband post Katrina. We wanted to commit to its comeback. It’s the most startlingly different place in the U.S. – part French, part voodoo, the birthplace of jazz and one of the few places that still has a flourishing music scene, where musicians can work and sit-in every night. Seeing greatness on a nightly basis is inspiration for me. It’s a home for creatives and outsiders and food lovers- ticks every box for me!\n\nI remember your fellow Brit, the famed producer John Porter telling me he loved it there. “You hear jazz at the gas station!” he exclaimed when he first arrived.\n\nHe’s in town right now producing an album with my pal and another Brit, the fab Jon Cleary. I think when you come from the UK, it’s almost overwhelming just how much there is here. Not just jazz btw, but all music. It’s truly a sensory smorgasbord.\n\nWhat can people expect to hear at your Django show on Saturday April 13?\n\nActually, it’ll be a sneak preview of my upcoming release Judith Owen Comes Alive, out May 10th. Recorded this past Jan at Marians Jazzroom in Bern, Switzerland. It includes songs from Come on and Get It but much, much more, so come on and see it! I’ll be joined by my New Orleans “Gentlemen Callers,” so we’ll be raising the roof at The Django!\n\nIs it hard being married to a member of Spinal Tap? (And does the amp REALLY go to eleven)?\n\nI’m currently in NOLA with Derek (Smalls, aka Harry Shearer), who’s filming the long-awaited follow up to “This Is Spinal Tap,” with the lads. Obviously, it’s not easy being married to a rock god and bass legend, but I try my best. His amp is so old I can’t see any numbers, but Nigel’s still goes to eleven. Actually have you noticed how many things go to 11 these days? I’d be very ticked off if I were him!\n\nTime for the Speed Round! Vodka or Gin?\n\nWine.\n\nElla (Fitzgerald) or Sarah (Vaughan)?\n\nElla.\n\nMiles (Davis) or (John) Coltrane?\n\nMiles.\n\nHerbie (Hancock) or Chick (Corea)?\n\nHerbie.\n\nNYC or LA?\n\nLondon!\n\nVinyl or Streaming?\n\nVinyl. Did you need to ask?\n\nWhat’s the strangest thing on your music player these days?\n\nDust. I’ve been on tour!\n\nIn 2024 you hope to…\n\nTour and tour and tour and…….."
