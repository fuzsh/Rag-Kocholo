You can still preorder the album on our page here but this preorder DOES NOT INLCUDE A WRISTBAND FOR THE EVENT.\n\nWe’re pumped to welcome Red Clay Strays to Grimey’s on Wednesday, July 31st at noon for an album signing to celebrate the release of Made By These Moments, their RCA debut.

To participate in our Made By These Moments signing, preorder the album on opaque gold color vinyl LP or CD from Grimey’s to secure your copy of the album and a wristband for the signing. Wristbands are required to participate in the album signing for all 13+ and are free with preorder of the album from Grimey’s. (Please note, wristbands are non-transferable.)

As this events falls at the time of our weekly BEER:30 hang, where we share cold Tennessee Brew Works beers with of-age customers, we’ll be proudly offering TN Brew Works to attendees (21+ with valid IDs). Plus we’ll have some additional refreshments for attendees to make this listening event a real party! This is a free & all ages affair, so come one, come all!\n\nIn the spring of 2023, Nashville native Sarah Mason Walden embarked on a deeply personal journey as she began to craft her inaugural studio album. Collaborating with Josh Kaler at Pentavarit Studios in Nashville, she poured her heart and soul into every note, infusing her music with her distinctive authenticity. During the process. Sarah found herself recalling the challenges she faced during her early twenties, navigating the Nashville music industry where producers and executives often sought more than her musical talent alone. She was determined not to compromise her vision, so the songs lay dormant for many years as she moved on to a successful career in art and design. She revisited these songs born from her own experiences, reclaiming them from the shadows of her past. The many months spent in the studio became a poignant act of self-discovery and empowerment, granting her younger self a voice while offering her present self the invaluable opportunity to hone her new role as producer under the mentorship of the remarkable Josh Kaler.\n\nJoined by a host of talented musicians, including Jump, Little Children's Matt Bivins on accordion, Ward Williams on cello, and Jonathan Gray on upright bass, as well as Slow Runner's Michael Flynn on piano, The Reclamation resonates with a rich tapestry of sound. Special guest Nenad Leonart contributes his talent with historical harpsichords and organs from Switzerland. Kevin Max of dc Talk and Sad Astronauts, accompanied by friends Jessica Bleu and Rebecca Seaver, lends his voice to a stirring rendition of the traditional song \"In the Pines.\" Mark Robertson, of bands such as The Ragamuffin Band and Th'Legendary Shack Shakers, adds his expertise on the upright bass. With meticulous care, the album was mastered by Parachute Mastering and will be officially released on July 26th.\n\nThe Reclamation promises a warm and immersive listening experience for audiences. Sarah's debut offering stands as a testament to her unwavering dedication to her craft and her steadfast commitment to artistic integrity. We can’t wait to celebrate the album with Sarah and hope you’ll be here to join us on this merry occasion.\n\nWe hope you can join us on Thursday, July 25th at 4:00 PM when we host American Aquarium in the record store to celebrate the release of their new album The Fear of Standing Still ! BJ Barham from the band will perform a short, solo set in the shop to be immediately followed by a Fear of Standing Still album signing. You can preorder your copy now on limited edition “Blue Jean” colored vinyl and CD in the shop or on our site here and score a wristband for American Aquarium’s signing. Wristbands guarantee entrance to our event and are required to participate in our signing for all 13+.\n\nFor nearly two decades, American Aquarium have pushed toward that rare form of rock-and-roll that’s revelatory in every sense. “For us the sweet spot is when you’ve got a rock band that makes you scream along to every word, and it’s not until you’re coming down at three a.m. that you realize those words are saying something real about your life,” says Barham. “That’s what made us fall in love with music in the first place, and that’s the goal in everything we do.”\n\nOn The Fear of Standing Still, the North Carolina-bred band embody that dynamic with more intensity than ever before, endlessly matching their gritty breed of country-rock with Barham’s bravest and most incisive songwriting to date (lead single “Crier” - co-written with Stephen Wilson Jr - is a great example). As he reflects on matters both personal and sociocultural—e.g., the complexity of Southern identity, the intersection of generational trauma and the dismantling of reproductive rights—American Aquarium instill every moment of The Fear of Standing Still with equal parts unbridled spirit and illuminating empathy.\n\nRecorded live at the legendary Sunset Sound in Los Angeles, The Fear of Standing Still marks American Aquarium’s second outing with producer Shooter Jennings—a three-time Grammy winner who also helmed production on 2020’s critically lauded Lamentations, as well as albums from the likes of Brandi Carlile and Tanya Tucker. In a departure from the stripped-down subtlety of 2022’s Chicamacomico (a largely acoustic rumination on grief), the band’s tenth studio LP piles on plenty of explosive riffs and hard-charging rhythms, bringing a visceral energy to the most nuanced and poetic of lyrics. “In our live show the band’s like a freight train that never lets up, and for this record I really wanted to showcase how big and anthemic we can be,” notes Barham, whose bandmates include guitarist Shane Boeker, pedal-steel guitarist Neil Jones, keyboardist Rhett Huffman, drummer Ryan Van Fleet, and bassist Alden Hedges.\n\nOur event with American Aquarium’s BJ Barham is going to be a great one and we hope you’ll be able to be here to help welcome The Fear of Standing Still into the world with us! This is a free and all ages performance but if you want to participate in our signing and guarantee your spot in the shop, be sure to place your preorder for the album on vinyl or CD to secure your wristband. And next time you’re in the shop, be sure to register to win tickets to American Aquarium’s upcoming show on Wednesday, October 2nd at The Basement East. We’ll be selecting our ticket winner in early August.\n\nPlease join us on Friday, July 19th at 5:00 PM when we welcome Swamp Dogg to the record store to celebrate the release of Blackgrass: From West Virginia to 125th Street, his new album out now on Oh Boy Records. Swamp Dogg will be in town to perform at The Opry on Saturday, July 20th and we’re pumped he’s able to spend a bit of his time in town with us. You can purchase a copy of Blackgrass in the shop or on our site here for a wristband for his post-performance album signing and that guarantees entrance to our event. (Wristbands are required for the signing except for kids 12 & under attending with a wristbanded adult.) Our event itself is free and all ages, so come one, come all!\n\n“Not a lot of people talk about the true origins of bluegrass music, but it came from Black people. The banjo, the washtub, all that stuff started with African Americans. We were playing it before it even had a name.” - Swamp Dogg\n\nProduced by Ryan Olson (Bon Iver, Poliça) and recorded with an all-star band including Noam Pikelny, Sierra Hull, Jerry Douglas, Chris Scruggs, Billy Contreras, and Kenny Vaughan, Blackgrass is a riotous blend of past and present, mixing the sacred and the profane in typical Swamp Dogg fashion as it blurs the lines between folk, roots, country, blues, and soul. The tracklist is an eclectic one—brand new originals and vintage Swamp Dogg classics sit side by side with reimaginings of ’70s R&B hits and timeless ’50s pop tunes—but the performances here are thoroughly cohesive, filtering everything through a progressive Appalachian lens that nods to tradition without ever being bound by it. Special guests like Margo Price, Vernon Reid, Jenny Lewis, Justin Vernon, and The Cactus Blossoms all add to the excitement, but it’s ultimately the 81-year-old Swamp Dogg’s delivery—sly and playful and full of genuine joy and ache—that steals the show. The result is a record that’s as reverent as it is raunchy, a collection that challenges conventional notions of genre and race while at the same time celebrating the music that helped make Swamp Dogg the beloved iconoclast he’s known as today.\n\nThis is gonna be a super fun time, y ‘all. We can’t wait to see Swamp Dogg in the shop and celebrate Blackgrass with him and our friends at Oh Boy Records. We hope you’ll be here to enjoy this special performance with us!\n\nUpdate: Our event with Lake Street Dive on Saturday, 7/13, is sold out! Thanks to all who participated in our preorder promotion.\n\nWe’re pumped to announce that we’ll be hosting Lake Street Dive for an intimate instore performance & album signing to. celebrate the release the upcoming album, Good Together, while they tour through Nashville this summer! The band will play a short set in the shop to be followed immediately by a Good Together album signing, before they head over to Ascend Amphitheater, where they’ll be headlining their Good Together Tour that evening.\n\nLake Street Dive have pushed the possibilities of pop music as a unifying force, not only through their eclectic sound—a boldly original cross-pollination of soul, folk, jazz, classic pop, and more—the five-piece’s all-embracing ethos has also made them a beloved live band known for building a potent connection among every crowd. In the making of their new album Good Together, vocalist Rachael Price, bassist/background vocalist Bridget Kearney, drummer/background vocalist Mike Calabrese, keyboardist/vocalist Akie Bermiss, and guitarist/background vocalist James Cornelison reinforced the deep sense of purpose behind their output, often turning their attention to the many factors driving us apart today (e.g., unchecked technological growth, culturally imposed isolation, the cult of relentless self-optimization). Born from a mindset they refer to as “joyful rebellion,” Good Together arrives as a body of work both gloriously defiant and primed to inspire unbridled dancing and ecstatic singing-along.\n\n“There’s a lot to be angry about in the world right now, a lot of pain and rage and divisiveness, but it isn’t sustainable to constantly live in that anger—you need something else to keep you going,” says Calabrese. “Joy is a great way to sustain yourself, and we wanted to encourage everyone to stay aware of that. In a way this album is our way of saying, ‘Take your joy very seriously.’”\n\nIn keeping with that spirit of communal uplift, Lake Street Dive’s eighth full-length marks the first time they’ve ever worked together in the earliest and most vulnerable stages of songwriting. Back in early 2023, the band’s members met up at Calabrese’s home studio in Vermont and spent nearly a week generating new songs, catalyzing the process with the help of a 20-sided die (a holdover from the many Zoom-based Dungeons & Dragons matches held by Bermiss and Kearney during lockdown). “The captain of a particular song would roll the die, and the result would decide the chords, the meter, and the tempo for that song,” Kearney explains. “We’d take those elements and jam for a while, go our separate ways and come up with lyrics and melodies, then come back together and workshop everything. It ended up taking us to new places we never would’ve gotten to otherwise, in terms of things like harmony and tempo and groove.” Along with expanding their musical palette and expressive range, that highly collaborative approach helped the band reach a new level of intimacy. “In the past we’d written pieces of songs and shared them with each other and built them up from there, but we always had the space to listen and reflect in total privacy,” says Price. “At first it was terrifying to write together in the same room, but as soon as we got started it felt so fun. We very quickly realized, ‘Oh, we need to do this again and again.’”\n\nTo participate in our ​Lake Street Dive album signing, ​p​reorder a copy of Good Together on our website here or in the record store and you’ll receive a wristband for our event​ with your preorder pickup. Wristbands are required for the album signing line and guarantee entrance to our event.

Each individual with a wristband can get as many as two total ​Lake Street Dive Good Together L​Ps or CDs signed. Wristbands are non-transferable and are required for participation in this event.

Nick will perform a short set in the shop to be immediately followed by a Country album signing. You can preorder your copy now on vinyl and CD in the shop or on our site here and score a wristband for Medium Build’s signing. Wristbands guarantee entrance to our event and are required to participate in our signing for all 13+.\n\nAs a musician with a nomadic lifestyle, Nick Carpenter often enters spaces as a stranger and leaves with lifelong friends. The creator of Medium Build possesses a connective charisma that shows in his songs and performances—which can seem like equal parts concerts, testimony, and stand-up comedy. That gift and yearning for connection has been amplified during a transformative season for Nick. In 2023, Medium Build signed with slowplay / Island Records, toured with Lewis Capaldi, and reached the Billboard charts for the first time collaborating with X Ambassadors. Life was pulling Carpenter away from his home, dog, and sense of belonging in Anchorage to Nashville. Nick spent his drives looking, listening, and reflecting. This inner and outer journey led to Country, the thematic album draws from Carpenter’s roots as much as it considers his future—while exploring genre.\n\n​Nick's music is as vast and unique as his backstory, but “if you slow all of my songs down, they’re just three-cord bummer Country tunes,” he admits. Evident in the video single “Cutting Thru The Country,” this collection packs for a trip that explores wide open spaces, musical frontiers, and oneself.​ Medium Build began as the name Carpenter attached to four-track recordings a decade ago. The storyteller applied aspects of a middle-class church-going Georgia childhood and a Tennessee education to truths learned along the way—ultimately delivering the queer extrovert to find a community in Alaska. There is duality and dichotomy in Medium Build’s life and music—but it is drenched in authenticity. The music has endured, resonated, and connected with a growing base. “Now I’m realizing that my career can last longer than five seconds and I can kind of just breathe and show one thing at a time,” Nick shares. His dynamic catalog mirrors the people who have shown up in his corner: Elton John, Boygenius, John Mayer, and Noah Kahan, to name a few. 2019’s somber and synth-tinged “Be Your Boy” and 2022’s therapeutic “Never Learned To Dance” are fan favorites amid the kaleidoscope of sounds and moods. Country seems much more focused, even if birthed by uncertainty.\n\nNow in his thirties, Nick says he only recently learned about his father’s poor rural South Carolina upbringing. As a result, Country music was something Nick’s dad covered up—along with the poverty and corresponding shame of his past. “I had no sense of identity as far as place,” the artist admits. Lately, the father and son began talking about the past and sharing Country tunes—exchanging culture and heritage. As an understanding of his DNA developed, perhaps the twang and American in Medium Build’s songs stood out. However, his Country is something unsurprisingly personal. “It feels self-soothing,” Nick says of the opener, “Beach Chair,” which is a love letter to self in a time of need. “Crying Over U” is deeply specific but conjures emotions in us all—when confronted by closure and what remains in the rearview.Written on the road, Country was fittingly recorded on Nashville’s Music Row. ​N​ick and creative partner Jake LiBassi, aka Laiko, embraced experimentation. “We made the album we wanted to make,” he says joyfully and confidently. “It’s so easy to get back in touch with yourself if you can throw off the heavy cloak of duty and just do something that feels good.” At a time when people take the same photo a dozen times in search of a curated aesthetic, Medium Build captures the snapshot. The lyrics and the spirit of Country embrace both wandering and wondering. “I want this to feel lived-in,” Nick says. “It’s sort of me finding a defined place.”\n\nOur event with Medium Build is going to be awesome, so don’t miss out! This is a free and all ages performance but if you want to participate in our signing and guarantee your spot in the shop, be sure to place your preorder for the album on vinyl or CD to secure your wristband.\n\nWe hope you can join us on Friday, June 28th at 5:00 PM when we host Daniel Nunnelee in the record store to celebrate the release of his new album June, Baby! He’ll perform a short set in the shop to be immediately followed by a June, Baby album signing. You can preorder your copy now on limited edition Translucent Lava colored vinyl and CD in the shop or on our site here and score a wristband for Daniel's signing. Wristbands guarantee entrance to our event and are required to participate in our signing for all 13+.\n\nWith the arrival of his self-released breakout single “Pick and Choose” in 2022, Memphis-born singer/songwriter Daniel Nunnelee introduced the world to his sweetly offbeat and soul-baring form of folk/indie-rock. An instant viral sensation that amassed over a million streams in just ten days, “Pick and Choose” soon led to the making of June, Baby: a strangely enchanting debut album revealing both his old-soul sensibilities and wide-eyed perspective on finding your way in the world. With its title nodding to his birthday month and to the duality he embodies as a quintessential Gemini, June, Baby explores such emotionally heavy matters as anxiety and anticipatory grief, endlessly showcasing the graceful musicality he first developed by playing guitar in church as a kid.\n\nA lifelong nature lover who wrote much of June, Baby at his favorite park and at remote cabins in Mississippi and Colorado, the Nashville-based artist also sets his self-reflection to a one-of-a-kind sound matching its homespun charm with the unbridled energy he’s brought to the stage opening for artists like Madi Diaz and Shakey Graves (in addition to headlining his own tours). A truly gifted vocalist who brings an undeniably playful spirit to his existential questioning, Nunnelee ultimately hopes that listeners might take whatever they need from his songs—whether it’s a deeper communion with the natural world that incessantly inspires his music, or a monumental shift in their own outlook on life.\n\nOur event with Daniel is going to be super fun and we hope you’ll be able to be here to help welcome June, Baby into the world! This is a free and all ages performance but if you want to participate in our signing and guarantee your spot in the shop, be sure to place your preorder for the album on vinyl or CD to secure your wristband.\n\nMake plans to join us on Tuesday, June 25th for a special record release celebration with Jim Lauderdale and the Game Changers​, his stellar band composed of Craig Smith, Lillie Mae Rische, Frank Rische, Jay Weaver and Dave Racine​. Lauderdale and the gang will perform an intimate set in the record store at 5:00 PM and then sign copies of their new album for event attendees. The record, My Favorite Plac​e, is due out June 21st​ via Lauderdale's own Sky Crunch Records​. The album was recorded at Blackbird Studios here in Nashville and n addition to The Game Changers, it features some of Music City’s favorite ringers​ including Chris Scruggs, Kenny Vaughn, Wes L'angolis, Will Van Horn, Micah Hulshcer, and Pat Bubert. You can read more about My Favorite Place on our site here where you can also preorder the ​new album on vinyl and CD and score a wristband for Lauderdale's post-performance signing. ​**Wristbands are not required for those 12 & under. Wristbands are required for our signing and guarantee entrance to our in-store event.**\n\n\"Even in Nashville, a city teeming with singular talents, Jim Lauderdale is unique. He came to Music City​ not as a kid off the Greyhound with stars in his eyes, but as a singer and songwriter who had already begun a promising career. He is among Nashville’s “A” list of songwriters, with songs recorded by artists such as: Patty Loveless, George Jones, The Dixie Chicks, Solomon Burke, Mark Chesnutt, Dave Edmunds, John Mayall, Kathy Mattea, Lee Ann Womack, Gary Allan, Blake Shelton, Vince Gill, and George Strait. He also contributed several songs to the successful soundtrack of the George Strait film, “Pure Country.” Not content to just write hits for the stars, ​L​auderdale has toured with the likes of Lucinda Williams, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Rhonda Vincent and Elvis Costello, among others.​\"\n\nHis musical influences include​ the likes of Dr. Ralph Stanley and George Jones. These influences and ​L​auderdale's unique sense of melody and lyric help forge a sound that is truly his own. He is a two time ​G​RAMMY winner​ who has received multiple nominations, winning his first in 2002 with Dr. Ralph Stanley for Lost in the Lonesome Pines (Dualtone)​ and his second​ for his “solo” bluegrass album, The Bluegrass Diaries (Yep Roc 2007)​. ​In 2016 Lauderdale received the Americana Music Association's Wagonmaster Award. Named for Country Music Legend Porter Wagner, the award is a special lifetime achievement honor that’s bestowed only upon significant contributors to the deep history of roots music.​\n\n“When I was a teenager wanting to be a bluegrass banjo player, I never would have imagined that I would get to work with people like Ralph Stanley and Robert Hunter and George Jones and Elvis Costello and John Oates​.... Getting to work with them inspires me greatly to this day, and I know it always will.”​ - Jim Lauderdale\n\nCome on out to enjoy this special occasion with us as we celebrate the release of My Favorite Place with his top-notch band! This is likely to be an afternoon filled with some Music City Magic, y'all, and you don't wanna miss out!

Due out Friday, June 7th via Island Records, Forever was recorded in 2023 right here in Music City at Ocean Way Nashville Studios. Of the album Jon Bon Jovi says, “this record is a return to joy. From the writing, through the recording process, this is turn up the volume, feel good Bon Jovi.”\n\nThe release of the record comes hot on the heels of HULU’s four-part docuseries Thank You, Goodnight: The Bon Jovi Story that showcases the band’s illustrious career spanning more than three decades since their formation in 1983. Bon Jovi has earned their place among global rock royalty and was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as well as the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Earlier this year, Jon Bon Jovi was awarded MusiCares Person of the Year for his philanthropic work. Jon founded the Jon Bon Jovi Soul Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to bringing about positive change and helping those in need “one SOUL at a time.” The foundation has worked to address homelessness, poverty, and food insecurity looking to make a positive impact at the community level. Additionally, Jon and his wife, Dorothea, opened the JBJ Soul Kitchen nonprofit community restaurant, now with 4 locations in New Jersey, helping feed those in need.\n\nTo participate in our ​Bon Jovi album signing, ​p​reorder a copy of Forever on our website here or in the record store and you’ll receive a wristband for our event​ with preorder pickup.

Randall will speak and briefly read from her new work before she signs copies* of both her book and tribute album. She will also be joined by Saaneah Jamison, Sunny War and Caroline Randall Williams, who will each perform a song by Randall for the occasion! After Randall speaks and the performances wrap, we’ll hang out in the shop, and spin the My Black Country companion album on Oh Boy Records which features a host of talented Black, female musicians in addition to those performing here, including Adia Victoria, Allison Russell, Leyla McCalla, and Sistastrings. You can read more about the the My Black Country book and album on our site where you can also order copies with which you’ll score a wristband for Russell’s signing. *Wristbands are required to participate in the signing and guarantee entrance to our event, however it is a free & all ages affair. (Kids 12 & under do not need a wristband to participate in the signing.)\n\nAlice Randall is a New York Times best-selling novelist, award-winning songwriter, educator, food activist, and now memoirist. A graduate of Harvard University, she holds an honorary doctorate from Fisk University, is on the faculty at Vanderbilt University, and credits Detroit’s Ziggy Johnson School of the Theater with being the most influential educational institution in her life. She is widely recognized as being one of the most significant voices in 21st century African-American fiction, the only Black woman in history to write both a number one Country song (Trisha Yearwood’s “XXX’s and OOO’s”) and an ACM video of the year (“Is There Life Out There?” starring Reba McEntire).\n\nCountry music had brought Randall and her activist mother together and even gave Randall a singular distinction in American music history: she is the first Black woman to cowrite a number one country hit. Randall found inspiration and comfort in the sounds and history of the first family of Black country music: DeFord Bailey, Lil Hardin, Ray Charles, Charley Pride, and Herb Jeffries who, together, made up a community of Black Americans rising through hard times to create simple beauty, true joy, and sometimes profound eccentricity.\n\nWhat emerges in My Black Country is a celebration of the most American of music genres and the radical joy in realizing the power of Black influence on American culture. As country music goes through a fresh renaissance today, with a new wave of Black artists enjoying success, My Black Country is the perfect read for longtime country fans and a vibrant introduction to a new generation of listeners who previously were not invited to give the genre a chance.\n\nWe hope you can join us on Thursday, May 9th when we’re joined by Adeem the Artist for an intimate in-store performance and album signing celebrating the release of their new album Anniversary! The album is out on May 3rd on the Four Quarters Records label, distributed nationally by our buds at Thirty Tigers. adeem has dropped by the shop in the past and we’re thrilled to be able to host them now as we welcome their new record into the world! You can preorder you copy of Anniversary on silver colored vinyl LP and CD in the record shop or on our webstore here. All who preorder for local pickup will also receive a wristband for our post-performance signing with Adeem in the shop. (Wristbands not required for those 12 and under with wristband-holding adults.) Wristbands are required for our in-store signing and guarantee entrance to our event. And in this special instance your Grimey’s Anniversary preorder wristbands also allows you to participate in a special signing / meet & greet with Adeem at the venue after their performance that night at The Basement East with Flamy Grant and Brandi Augustus.*\n\n*Concert tickets are required for entrance to Adeem the Artist’s show at The Basement East on 5/9 and are available for purchase here.\n\nAnniversary is the 2024 studio album from critically acclaimed artist Adeem the Artist. The album was recorded live to tape over five days at The Butcher Shop here in Nashville and was produced by Butch Walker (Taylor Swift, Frank Turner). Megan Coleman (Jenny Lewis and Allison Russell), Nelson Williams (Jake Blount), Ellen Angelico (Wheeler Walker Jr.), Jessye DeSilva, Aaron Lee Tasjan, Katie Pruitt and more lend their talents here. This record is the continuation of a project that Adeem began four years ago, directing their attention both inwards & outwards simultaneously and to exact correlating values so that they might be able to unbind the inner workings of themself while imagining new tools for stitching the fabric of society together again.\n\nWalker’s ability to blend sounds from classic to contemporary, commercial to experimental, gives Adeem license to play with a range of musical styles on Anniversary, while still remaining tethered to country and roots music. Fittingly, Anniversary also arrives on the date of Adeem’s marriage to their spouse Hannah, bringing with it a heightened sense of intimacy and urgency from a songwriter whose work is characterized by fearless, incisive lyric writing.\n\n“This one feels a lot more personal and earnest — a lot of it is very close to the chest,” Adeem says. “This record is a marker as well as a collection of individual markers. I’m saying, ‘This is who I am as an artist and this is the world I want to try to help create.’”\n\nDon’t miss this intimate performance in the record shop by Adeem and help us properly celebrate Anniversary! You can preorder you copy of the album on vinyl and CD in the record shop and on our site here. Wristbands are included with local preorders and are available for pick up in the record store with preorder pickup only.\n\nImportant Parking Information\n\n* Parking on-site is limited to the spaces directly beside and behind the record store. These parking spaces are shared with our neighbors, Anaconda Vintage, Living Waters Brewing, and Sunrise Crossfit and Legion Jujitsu.\n\n* A paid parking lot is available just a block and a half away, behind Eastside Music Supply, Tiger Bar and Elegy coffee, at the corner of Gallatin Road & Trinity Lane.\n\n* A new gravel pay lot is located nearby--behind the car wash next to Nicolleto's, accessible via the alley entrance.\n\n* Please check out our parking FAQs for further info."
