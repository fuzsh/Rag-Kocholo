        "text": "The discography of The Residents officially dates from Christmas 1972 to the present day (though recordings from some years earlier are also known to exist). It consists of dozens of studio, live, and compilation albums, as well as many singles, digital releases and offshoot projects.\n\nPlease note that due to its length and complexity, the below discography has been separated into sections (ie. \"Collaborative releases\" for Title In Limbo or I Am A Resident!, or \"Serial drama and spoken word\" for The River of Crime, \"Box sets\" for Duck Stab! Alive! etc.). A small number of items have been listed under multiple sections (often indicating multiple release formats).\n\nIf you can't find a release, The Mysterious Spanish Ladies recommend checking to see if there is another, more relevant section where the item may be listed - if you still cannot find it, try searching the page by pressing Ctrl and F and entering the title.
