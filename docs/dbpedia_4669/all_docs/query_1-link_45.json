        "text": "(This page is about the Australian band. For the British band of the same name, see God(2). For the Dutch band of the same name, see God(3))\n\nGod (also stylised as GOD) were an Australian punk rock band from Melbourne, formed in 1986 by Sean Greenway on guitar and vocals; Tim Hemensley on bass guitar, drums and vocals; Joel Silbersher on guitar and vocals; and Matthew Whittle on bass guitar, drums and vocals. All four were 15-16 at the time. Their signature song, \"My Pal\", was released as their debut single in January 1988. Their sole studio album, For Lovers Only, appeared in December 1989 after the group disbanded. Sean Greenway died of a heroin overdose on 21 January 2001, aged 30. Tim Hemensley also died of a heroin overdose, on 21 July 2003, aged 31. Whittle curated their 2× CD compilation album, GOD, in February 2010.\n\n[]\n\nPeel first played the band's debut single, My Pal, in March 1988, and would often play the track on his shows, although it didn't seem that he played any further songs from the group, according to available tracklistings on this site.\n\nShows Played[]\n\n1988\n\n29 March 1988: My Pal (7\") Au Go Go\n\n12 April 1988: My Pal (7\") Au Go Go\n\n16 May 1988: My Pal (12\") Au Go Go\n\n31 May 1988 (Radio Bremen): My Pal (7\") Au Go Go\n\n19 December 1988: My Pal (12\") Shakin' Street\n\n1989\n\n13 January 1989 (BFBS): My Pal (12\") Shakin' Street\n\nJanuary 1989 (Ö3): My Pal (12\") Shakin' Street\n\n1990\n\n02 January 1990: My Pal (12\") Shakin' Street\n\n2002\n\nOctober 2002 (FSK): My Pal (7\") Au Go Go\n\n[]"
