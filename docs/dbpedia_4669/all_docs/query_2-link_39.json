        "text": "Rumi, the 13th century Persian poet, said that the wound is the place where the light enters you. Well the great singer/songwriter/mystic/minstrel/bard/muse/essayist/ima emaker/trubador/rhapsodist Joe Henry found the light when the wound entered him, and all the evidence is available on his incredible brand new album, The Gospel According to Water (due out Nov 15th).\n\nIn November 2018 I was in East Jerusalem, working on my novel Apeirogon. I woke up to an email from Joe -- who over the years has become a good friend -- telling me that he had been diagnosed with cancer. I was reeling, but I pulled myself together, walked out into the morning, sat under a tree, and wrote back straight away. My e-mail is a little personal but I quote it in full here:\n\n\"Joe, a chara. I wake up this morning in East Jerusalem to this news. Strong sunlight and birds. I have to tell you that after a moment of pure and unresolved grief, I began to think about you fighting this. The light grew. I hope that does not sound strange. I know you understand. The light grew. Yes the grief was so real that it knocked me backwards for a moment but almost immediately I was gently brought up from the unfathomable with the knowledge that it will hear the music and poetry you create and that you will not allow to inhabit you or indeed anyone else and that this too will make the world a better place to wait for the dark and overcome it. If someone is going to fight the real with the mystery (call it grace), it's you. The light grows. I am sad so very sad that this is the news today, but bolstered by the fact that it is you and it is Mel and it is possible to find meaning, language, hope, constancy, love. And somehow -- don't ask me why -- there is a deep beauty in all of this. It comes in the simple fact that you will not succumb. Not just for yourself but for all of us. Now get out there and banish this.\"\n\nThe thing is that Joe did more than go out and banish this: he found the place of the wound and went through, as Lorca would say, to the pulse on the opposite side. The album was recorded in two days. It arrived for him, yes, like a piece of light, and then it decided to stay.\n\nI got a chance to get a sneak listen to his song \"Green of the Afternoon.” I was taken by the immediate intimacy of the voice which swiftly says: The days crawl, the light falls swift and soon. It's a raw voice in your ear, saying, Come, listen, journey with me a while. You move like green upon this afternoon. What a line! To move like green upon the afternoon. There is something so Gerard Manley Hopkins about it, some Dylan Thomas-y. And then Joe takes us on this fabulous journey: What goes unspoken may not go unheard. At one point in the song he says, You take the p**ce of God away from me. The reason I put two asterisks there is that I cannot be sure whether he meant the word peace or piece. I assume it's peace, but I like it also as the word piece, as in piece of God. I don't really want to ask Joe about it because it's a beautiful lesson in the idea of the both, Whitmanesque in the way it embraces possibility.\n\nFor those of you who know Joe, this is another bouquet of flowers to the world. For those of you who don't know him, this is a basketful of seeds to plant and grow. This is his 15th album but he is also an incredible producer, having worked with, among others, Elvis Costello, Alain Toussaint, Loudon Wainright III, Billy Bragg, the Milk Carton Kids and one of my all-time favourites, Lisa Hannigan. He wrote a kick-ass book about Richard Pryor with his brother, David. He's a great bloke, down to earth, solid, loyal. He's married to the wonderful Mel. He's father of the incredibly talented Levon. And one of my great prides in life is that I got a chance to contribute, along with Lisa Hannigan, the title song on the Invisible Hour album.\n\nSend the song along to friends if you can. Buy the album when it comes. Place it in a dark spot and watch the light go to work.\n\nFinally, I'm reminded of the incredible Anne Carson who says: If all the lamps in this house/ were turned out/you could dress this wound /by what shines from it.\n\n—Colum McCann"
