Hammersmith Odeon Spring 1982 for Record Store Day 2023, released with full co-operation of the band. Haircut 100% Live! Hammersmith Odeon Spring 1982 is an in-concert album that highlights the group at the summit of their powers  high speed funk, to-die for pop and sweet melodies against the backdrop of Haircutmania. No overdubs and the high-octane energy of youth. The group moved from being London underground darlings to chart sensations in less than six months, and within a year had disappeared into pops ether, leaving behind one memorable album and four Top 10 UK singles, but many have said that the real way to experience the power of the Haircuts was to see them play live.\n\nPressed on zinging translucent red vinyl, Haircut 100% Live! Hammersmith Odeon Spring 1982 is an absolute must for all fans of frenetic funky fabulous melodic pop. This recently unearthed recording was part of the acclaimed Pelican West 40 CD set.\n\nIt includes their cover version of set opener Low Rider by War, where the group all appeared on stage one-by-one. Inner bag contains snapshots taken at the Hammersmith gig and after show on 1 April 1982 from guitarist Graham Jones personal archive. Mastered by Phil Kinrade at AIR Mastering.\n\nSIDE A\n\n1.

Dense, abrasive and focused, The Red and the Blacks complex and funky musical style was ahead of its time. Harrison's observations throughout the album on the modern condition ring all the more true in our digital age. This limited edition 2LP edition features the 1981 album recut from the original tapes plus a bonus LP of previously unreleased outtakes and alternate mixes.\n\nA1. THINGS FALL APART\n\nA2.

Lead single barcelona boots is a swirl of washed-out synths and Banks yearning falsetto, while too long is a sighing ballad underpinned with psychedelic atmospherics. On the EP's closer -- the tropical, hazy tossing and turning -- Arlie turns a self-deprecating eye on a superficial generation so fixated on projecting a lifestyle that they miss out on living the actual life.\n\n1. big fat mouth 2. barcelona boots 3. too long 4. water damage 5. didya think 6. tossing and turning\n\nIn 1968 The Rolling Stones returned to their blues roots on Beggars Banquet, which was immediately acclaimed as one of their landmark achievements. A strong acoustic Delta blues flavor colors much of the material, particularly Prodigal Son and No Expectations. Basic rock n roll is not forgotten with Street Fighting Man and Sympathy For The Devil. The lyrical bite of the material ensured the albums place as one of the top blues-based records of all time.\n\nExclusive to Record Store Day 2023, this LP is pressed on grey, blue, black and white swirl vinyl as an ode to the lyric a swirling mass of grey, blue, black and white, from Salt Of The Earth, as performed in The Rolling Stones Rock And Roll Circus.

It's also one of the earliest jazz albums to feature rapping. \"I called the project Black Renaissance because that is what I wanted to see happen - especially in music. I describe it as Dixieland circa 1976 - by the end of the songs everyone is playing together.\"\n\nGiven its rarity, when asked if he was surprised that people knew about the album Whitaker jokes \"I've told enough people about it over the years! Now they can actually hear it. It was a record before it's time. It's not a commercial release - I think of it as classical. You can call it jazz, but it's free, it's got African roots, it's for people who people who dig that sound.\"\n\nHarry Whitaker has enjoyed a successful career as a producer, arranger and composer, cutting his teeth on the best of the Roy Ayers Ubiquity releases and making a living working closely with Roberta Flack - as her musical director, even playing on her big Eugene McDaniels' written hit \"I Feel Like Makin' Love.\" Black Renaissance \"Body, Mind, and Spirit,\" was his first attempt at a project where he wrote and composed the music and played keys on both tracks.\n\nOriginally released in 1977 and highly considered as one of the grail titles in the Spiritual Jazz, Jazz-Funk canon.
