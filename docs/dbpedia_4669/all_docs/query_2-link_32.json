        "text": "AMANDA FIELDS\n\nOLD TUNES & SAD SONGS - SARAH KATE MORGAN\n\nSarah Kate Morgan is one of the up-and-coming artists I’m most excited about. She’s got a traditional foundation and is known around Appalachia for her dulcimer playing. She has such a beautiful and sweet perspective that shines through and nothing about her is put on. This album is like a gentle “welcome home” for me.\n\nRUSTIN’ IN THE RAIN - TYLER CHILDERS\n\nI love this album and its little quirks and playfulness. Tyler’s voice really resonates with me and this record is fresh while being super country!\n\nCOSMICO - CRUZ CONTRERAS\n\nThis is such a dreamy and interesting record. Cruz’s piano playing is one of my favourite things and it’s wrapped up in this dreamy soundscape on Cosmico.\n\nWORKIN’ ON A WORLD - IRIS DEMENT\n\nIris has to be one of the best songwriters of our time. The songs on this record have so much depth and lyrically so many layers, that it hit me hard the first time I heard it, which beckoned another listen to look more deeply into the wisdom she transmits. It’s a spiritual experience.\n\nBRENNEN LEIGH\n\nTHE BIGGEST LIFE - SUMMER DEAN\n\nIt has been a staple for me since it came out. It’s so honest and real.\n\nCHRISTMAS IN PRISON - HAYES CARLL AND MELISSA CARPER\n\nHayes Carll and Melissa Carper’s cover of Christmas in Prison\n\nIt has given me my daily good cry.\n\nTHAT OLD FAMILIAR DRUNKEN FEELING - CORB LUND\n\nLoving Corb Lund’s new one That Old Familiar Drunken Feeling\n\nIt never stops being funny, no matter how many times I hear it.\n\nCHERIE - THEO LAWRENCE\n\nI’m a new fan, great record.\n\nSHAWN WILLIAMS\n\nHACKNEY DIAMONDS - THE ROLLING STONES\n\nLIVE AT DEE’S - SHANNON MCNALLY\n\nGOD GAMES - THE KILLS\n\nZACH BRYAN - ZACH BRYAN\n\nGET BEHIND THE WHEEL - EILEN JEWELL\n\nMULTITUDES - FEIST\n\nSONIC CHAMELEONIC - THEM VIBES\n\nESTHER ROSE\n\nNOTHING FOR ME, PLEASE - DEAN JOHNSON\n\nRequired listening for anyone going through a breakup with another person, with themselves, or with reality.\n\nROMANTIC PIANO - GIA MARGARET\n\nThis album is ketamine approved.\n\nTOMORROW’S FIRE - SQUIRREL FLOWER\n\nPerfect vocals, perfect shredding.\n\nSHADOW PEOPLE - DUFF THOMPSON\n\nDuff Thompson produced my first album and his finesse in the studio always feels like home.”\n\nMELISSA MCCLELLAND (WHITEHORSE)\n\nHere are some of the records and artists that made an impact on me in the last year. Some of these tracks found their way to me through friends’ recommendations or being in the right place at the right time, like a 2am kitchen dance party on a frigid night in Winnipeg. Some of these voices are new to me and some are warm and familiar-we go way back. So much music enters my realm without making an impact, so when it does it tends to never leave my personal playlists. I take these songs along with me for life.\n\nCYCLAMAN - NURIA GRAHAM\n\nREVEALER - MADISON CUNNINGHAM\n\nSESSA - ESTRELA ACESA\n\nBRAZIL: SONGS OF PROTEST - ZELIA BARBOSA\n\nGOD SAVE THE ANIMALS - ALEX G\n\nARE WE GOOD - HAYDEN\n\nAGS CONNOLLY\n\nUsually when I’m asked to name my albums of the year, I make two mistakes: I miss out some great ones (probably done that again here) and I try to be way too smart about it. Well, this year there’s nothing to be smart about - these albums just cook. So here goes, in no particular order:\n\nTHE BIGGEST LIFE - SUMMER DEAN\n\nI’ve been a Summer Dean fan for a very long time, and this is a fabulous singer-songwriter country album which showcases her diversity as a writer without ever being impersonal. Opening for Summer on her first UK tour this year was an incredible goal to unlock for me, but it also taught me a lot. Summer is a force of nature as well as a model of dedication, and The Biggest Life is a manifestation of that.\n\nI’VE SEEN A LOT OF HIGHWAY - BILLY DON BURNS\n\nOne of those quasi-mythical figures who everyone in the country music trenches has a story about. Billy Don Burns has lived many lives and continues to bring them to us via his underrated albums.\n\nI DON’T KNOW A THING ABOUT LOVE - WILLIE NELSON\n\nWillie isn’t slowing down in his quest to make every possible album he’s ever dreamed of making. Harlan Howard is a big hero of mine so naturally this record of his songs is a treat for me.\n\nBLUEGRASS VACATION - ROBBIE FULKS\n\nThe sheer higher-plain quality of Robbie’s last few albums had me worried that this one couldn’t match up. I was proved majorly wrong. The song Angels Carry Me may be one of his very best ever.\n\nAIN’T THROUGH HONKY TONKIN’ YET - BRENNEN LEIGH\n\nGuess who foolishly released an album on the same day as this rip-snorter from Brennen? Yup, you guessed it. Another triumph from one of the most talented and versatile artists working today.\n\nOld album newly discovered:\n\nPENGUIN EGGS - NIC JONES\n\nSaw someone raving about this album from 1980, so I gave it a go. This is hands down the best traditional English folk (maybe any folk) album I’ve ever heard and it would probably convert many non-folk listeners. I get the impression it was a big influence on Bob Dylan’s Good As I Been To You record too.\n\nKASSI VALAZZA\n\nSWEETKORN - MICHAEL HURLEY\n\nSPENCER CULLUM’S COIN COLLECTION - SPENCER CULLUM\n\nANARCHIST GOSPEL - SUNNY WAR\n\nGOOD KID - CHRIS ACKER\n\nNOTHING FOR ME PLEASE - DEAN JOHNSON\n\nMISS TESS\n\nSTRANGER TO THE FEELING - TAYLOR ASHTON\n\nI have been pretty bad about checking out new music this year, but I did enjoy my friend Taylor Ashton’s Stranger to the Feeling.\n\nJAIMEE HARRIS\n\nWORKIN’ ON A WORLD - IRIS DEMENT\n\nThis is one of the best folk records to hit my ears in YEARS. I would expect no less from the great Iris DeMent. If I was in charge of the business, this record would be nominated for and win ALL OF THE AWARDS. DeMent was able to artfully\n\narticulate the experience of what it’s like to be a person on this Earth, during this time right now while also creating a body of work that I believe will prove itself to be timeless. A masterpiece. I keep going back to the title track over and over again because it genuinely fills my heart with hope.\n\nLIFE’S A CIGARETTE - ZÖE PETE FORD\n\nCalifornia-raised, NYC-based singer-songwriter Zöe Pete Ford is definitely an artist to watch. This self-engineered, self-produced debut album is a stunner. It’s simultaneously raw and catchy. Pairs well with The Nerves and frustrating subway rides.\n\nFALLOWEEN - DON HENRY\n\nYou may have to do some digging to find a digital version of this incredible record from Don Henry. However, the vinyl packaging is a stunner. The liner notes include a little backstory for every song, the artwork by Mike Moran is incredible, and instead of labelling the vinyl “Side A” and “Side B,” you’ll flip this pumpkin orange wax from “Trick” to “Treat.” The production on this record is perfection and the songs are rock solid. After one spin, you’ll be singing “it’s fall y’all” for weeks!\n\nIN THE THROES - BUDDY & JULIE MILLER\n\nAny time Buddy and Julie Miller put a record out into the world, it’s certain to be my favourite of the year. I can’t even type the title The Last Bridge You Will Cross without crying. What a powerful song. I feel extraordinarily fortunate to be on this planet at the same time as Julie Miller. Her writing never stops blowing my mind and expanding my heart.\n\nPIECES OF TREASURE - RICKIE LEE JONES\n\nThe Dutchess of Coolsville indeed. Rickie Lee Jones continues to be one of the most creative, captivating, and passionate artists making music on this planet today. Whatever she does, I’m in. Because she’s one of the greatest songwriters of our time and one of the greatest singers of our time, she’s one of the strongest interpreters of songs. Hell yes, I love hearing her sing selections from the Great American Songbook. I also extremely appreciate Mike Dillon’s vibes kicking off the record. How can that not put a smile on your face?\n\nSEAN BURNS\n\nTHE MORE THE MERRIER - JOEL PATERSON\n\nAnother beautifully crafted (Christmas) record by one of the finest guitar pickers out there, today. Thoughtful arrangements, wonderfully executed.\n\nVALLEY OF THE HEART’S DELIGHT - MARGO CILKER\n\nThis highly anticipated follow-up to 2021’s Pohorylle does not disappoint.\n\nAIN’T THROUGH HONKY TONKIN’ YET - BRENNEN LEIGH.\n\nBrennen follows themes for her records and this one hits hard. Produced by Chris Scruggs, he and Leigh are a combo destined to make beautiful country music together. Proof’s in the pudding.\n\nCHERIE - THEO LAWRENCE\n\nBilly Horton makes high quality records and Theo shines here with beautiful vocals, pleasing sonics and great musicians playing killer country songs.\n\nBACK TO THE BLUE SIDE - THE COUNTRYSIDE OF HARMONIA SAM\n\nI still marvel at the fact that the fellas who comprise what is arguably the top hardcore Honky-Tonk band on earth today hail from Sweden. A handful of cuts written by the aforementioned Theo Lawrence packed in with other expertly performer Honky-Tonk make for another winner by the boys from Malmo.\n\nBOTH SIDES OF LONELY - MICHELLE BILLINGSLEY\n\nI’m a fan of the Billingsley’s songs and unique voice. Backed by some dynamite pickers, this record is a step up and leap forward for this Chicago based performer.\n\nLONELY STREET - MALPASS BROTHERS\n\nThese dudes just seem to quietly go about their business. Good thing for us, their business is making beautiful country music.\n\nSASKATCHEWAN COUNTRY GUITAR - BRYCE LEWIS\n\nWith cameos from Grant Siemens, Redd Volkaert and, Jeff Bradshaw to name a few, you know you’re in for a treat. Nice instrumental selection of instrumentals from one of the nicest fellas and hottest guitar pickers you’ll meet.\n\nBOUND FOR HEARTACHE - JOEY FRENDO\n\nBased in Oklahoma, Frendo has crafted a high-quality album of country rockers and well written songs.\n\nSIEMPRE - AGS CONNOLLY\n\nBig fan of Ags. Consistetly churning out good records and songs, here’s a true country singer/songwriter in the mould of the greats and the outlaws he looks up to. Over the years, Ags has crafted a sound for himself backed by his rock-solid acoustic rhythm guitar playing that drives the material.\n\nMICHAEL WESTON KING (MY DARLING CLEMENTINE)\n\nALL THE EYES CAN SEE - JOE HENRY\n\nA new Joe Henry album is always something to get excited about, and I have been buying them ever since his debut in 1989. This album though is arguably his best, certainly of his later years, when he espoused Alt country for more jazz influenced releases. Intimate, sparse arrangements but by no means under produced. Lyrically as poetic and meaningful as anything he has written before, and that is saying something. There is not a weak song on here and it gets better with each listen. Too many highlights but Kitchen Door, Song That I Know and the title track are especially wonderful.\n\nTHE VIVIAN LINE - RON SEXSMITH\n\nLike with Joe, someone I have followed from the start, and had the pleasure to tour with. As much I have enjoyed Ron’s last few albums, this is a real return to form, with magnificent and very fitting production from Brad Jones allayed to a clutch of some of Rons best sings in years, it’s a great album and it was played to death when we albums were touring Europe in spring, which include a night off seeing Ron live in Paris. Maybe the pandemic gave everyone an enforced break from touring that allowed us to focus more on the writing and the releases that followed are all the stronger for it?\n\nSEVEN PSALMS - PAUL SIMON\n\nLike Dylan and Leonard Cohen on their later work, PS ruminates on his mortality and the onset of old age, but, unlike some of his other contemporaries, without letting the standards drop. This is a beautiful piece of work, one long 30-minute movement with reoccurring musical themes. Not an album to listen to by track, it is its own entity. My son described at You Want It Darker with better finger picking. Pretty good summarisation.\n\nWORKIN’ ON A WORLD - IRIS DEMENT\n\nIt was great to see Iris so active in 2023, a new album and a lot of touring. Sadly, I missed her when she was in the UK and\n\nIreland but have feasted on WOAW. Her albums are always made up of fine songs, and this is no exception, and she continues to fight the good fight. In an era where protest albums, and plain-speaking protest songs are in very short supply she doesn’t mince her words, so all power to here. Rave on Iris.\n\nVALLEY OF HEART’S DELIGHT - MARGO CILKER\n\nLou and I both loved her debut album, 2021’s Pohorylle. VOHD has its moments and again it eased us down the road on many trips but it feels like it maybe came a little too soon after the first one, maybe these were songs/tracks that didn’t make the cut first time round? I am sure Margo is here to stay and has many great songs yet to write, a little more time between releases and I am sure some of those would have made this a stronger album. Still, it is worth your ears, my personal faves being In The Middle and Beggar For Your Love.\n\nEVENSONGS - ANDREW RUMSEY My Album of The Year\n\nOne that I ‘reviewed’ on my social media pages, such was my enjoyment of it. SO here it is again, if space permits -\n\nA constant and soothing presence in recent months has been the starkly beautiful new album from Andrew Rumsey. A very English folk album in spirit, full of rich open tunings and pastoral songs often about the beauty of the English countryside, and his native Wiltshire in particular but also with plenty of heart wrenching personal reminisces to satisfy the miserabilists in us all. Andrew’s voice has more than a hint of Martín Carthy but he is of a vintage who was raised on pop, rock and punk. Shades of Robyn Hitchcock and Syd Barrett permeate this record too.\n\nMost of my favourite releases this year have been by men of a certain age brandishing acoustic guitars (Joe Henry, Ron Sexsmith, Paul Simon), and I now add Evensongs to that list. And in It’ll Come To Me Andrew has written, imho, a perfect modern folk song, a standard that should sit alongside the likes of May You Never by John Martyn or Withered And Died by Richard Thompson. One of those rare moments when everything just fits. Melody, lyrics, arrangements. All in their perfect place.\n\nLILLIE MAE RISCHE\n\nFavourites & songs most listened to :\n\nWATCHING THE RIVER ROLL BY - MARK THORNTON\n\nMark is an extraordinary musician and person who played guitar with Jerry Reed and plenty of others. This new song of his, features great songwriting, lovely singing and superb musicianship, and has Billy Contreras on strings. I could listen all day every day to it.\n\nTHE REAL WORLD - FREYA JOSEPHINE HOLLICK\n\nI’ve loved listening to this. She is one of the all-time greats.\n\nLONG HARD YEAR - THE HOWLIN’ BROTHERS\n\nOne of my favourites this year and every year.\n\nKISSIN CALIFORNIA - SHED SEVEN\n\nLOVE IS THE CALL - CAST\n\nMy Husband Craig, from Scotland, turned me onto Cast years ago and I got to play with Liam Tyson of Cast, funny how the world works. But their new song is awesome!\n\nHONEY, I MISS YOU - TAMMY WYNETTE\n\nThe production is so good and I listen to it on repeat.\n\nWONDERLAND - MARTHA SPENCER\n\nShe’s my dear friend and a talented writer and musician. Her next record, coming out soon, is killer as well.\n\nFRANKINCENSE AND MYRRH - MILLY RACCOON\n\nMilly is my friend and sister in love. I am played a little part here or there but Milly’s song writing is fresh, smart, and witty. I love all her songs!\n\nDRIVIN’ and ELEPHANT - ROBERT ELLIS songs\n\nI listen to them on repeat.\n\nERIN ENDERLIN\n\nI’m terrible at keeping up with which albums come out which year - but if I had a winner this year it would be Brennen Leigh.\n\nAIN’T THROUGH HONKY TONKIN’ YET - BRENNEN LEIGH\n\nMINOR GOLD - (TRACY & DAN)\n\nSWINGING STARS - MAPACHE\n\nCOMMON NOTION OF SORROW - RACHEL BAIMAN\n\nCAN’T STAY HERE - SMITH & TEGIO\n\nSTORIES FROM A ROLL ‘N’ ROLL HEART - LUCINDA WILLIAMS\n\nTHE WINDING WAY - THE TESKEY BROTHERS\n\nPAT REEDY\n\nWhat I’ve been enjoying the most is the music of Dustin Bothwell, but I’m not sure when his album is coming out. I’ve been spending a bit of time playing with him. It’s recorded by Chris Weissbaker who used to play drums for me. He’s now built a studio in his home and has been recording a lot of young people, kind of the next generation of Nashville country acts. Someone to watch. I like Dustin because he’s real. Not just working class, but this fella has been in serious trouble in the past. He came up in the same shit that I did and came out of it with really good and honest songs, so that means a lot to me. I like Chris Acker, he’s down in New Orleans, and Zach Bryson who is now up in Nashville. Kristina Murray released two singles in 2022.\n\nSAM OUTLAW\n\nPEOPLE TALK - LAUREN MARROW\n\nLauren lives on my street in East Nashville and every time I drive by her house I think “A country music superstar lives right there - if anyone in Nashville would take the time to notice”. The collection of songs on this album are… perfect. The song Hustle is a bonafide country hit with better lyrics than 99% of Music Row’s best attempts. And if you’re lucky enough to catch Lauren live, the songs shine even brighter.\n\nSACRAMENTED - MOLLY PARDEN\n\nMolly has made another subtle masterpiece with introspective songs about, well, everything. And the minimal production beautifully captures Molly’s hushed yet powerful voice. “Looking for love in the wrong spots / Thinking about the wrong thoughts”\n\nTIN ROOF - ALEX BARNES single\n\nAlex has a voice that is weary beyond her years and when I heard this single it made me want to write some more sad country waltzes. The lyrics in this song about a lovers’ quarrel on a rainy night cut right through the bullshit. She’s got the magic.\n\nHOLD - WILD NOTHING\n\nJack Tatum makes really cool songs. Great hooks and interesting instrumentation that never goes fully “electronic”. The new single Headlights On”pairs ‘90s-style “Jock Jams” beats with self-deprecating lyrics that I think everyone can relate to. Or at least I can relate to them. “I fucked it up, I fucked it up again. Was there even a chance I could change? Or am I resolute to stay the same?”\n\nGRACIE HORSE\n\nHere’s some stuff I liked this year:\n\nHAZY ROAD - BONG WISH\n\nCool psych rock- great live show- one of my best buddies- great album.\n\nYEAR AWAY - KACEY JOANSING\n\nKacey has such a pretty voice, she’s a great musician and her live show rocks- she plays piano really well too- her partner Tim Ramsey is a great pedal steel player and musician in general too and plays on the album.\n\nSO FAR SO GOOD - MEERNAA\n\nFriend of mine- beautiful voice-sounds like 1000 years old several karmic life times very wise great guitar player.\n\nMAC CORNISH – MAC CORNISH\n\nI don’t know her but I heard her song at a coffee shop so I checked it out- out of Portland Oregon- cool songs cool voice!\n\nWILD ONION - SHAWN HESS\n\nHe has a couple singles released that I like- looking forward to hearing the album coming out in January! A friend of mine, Cooper, who is a great pedal steel player is on it so\n\nOUT OF CONTROL - SAM BUCK\n\nGot to know him - his EP out of control is awesome and he is so great live.\n\nTHE RAINBOW WHEEL OF DEATH - DOUGIE POOLE\n\nMy Wharfcat brother Dougie Poole did a good cd too- check it out - I listened to track 4 so many times it doesn’t work anymore!\n\nSEAN THOMPSON’S WEIRD EARS – SEAN THOMPSON’S WEIRD EARS\n\nHaha, I love this album cove. I played a couple shows with Sean- he rocks- he is so good at guitar. Album is cool.\n\nRHINESTONE SUNSET - SUNNY AND THE SUNSETS\n\nPlayed a show with this crew too! This album is a cool take on some country styles. It’s not new but it is new to me!\n\nHANNAH ALDRIDGE\n\nTHE RECORD - BOYGENIUS\n\nI appreciated the lyrical rawness of this record. I discovered Phoebe Bridgers this year and this was an extension of my appreciation for her approach to writing.\n\nI ONLY SEE THE MOON - THE MILK CARTON KIDS\n\nI love all the Milk Carton Records but I really loved the production on this one. The strings and arrangements are beautiful.\n\nTHE LAND IS INHOSPITABLE AND SO ARE WE - MITSKI\n\nThis is another beautifully produced record. The strings production and vocal treatment is just perfect. I listened to this record on many long-haul flights.\n\nAT THE ROADHOUSE - THE PAPER KITES\n\nI really love the pop sensibility of The Paper Kites records and this one reaches into the rock world a little more which I really enjoyed.\n\nIt’s time for everyone at Lonesome Highway to put their writing implements down, turn off the computers and reflect on the year that is about to end.\n\nThe months have passed by like a speeding train and we find ourselves at the end of the line, looking back at all the wonderful music that has come our way.\n\nIt never gets taken for granted, all the long hours put into creating a new release, all the inspiration and perspiration that it takes to finally realise that goal. However it should be noted that not every release we receive will make the review process. It is simply because we like to spend time with music that moves us in a way that provides us with the inspiration to write about it. This is no reflection on the submissions but rather down to personal and subjective taste, as well as time commitments.\n\nAt Lonesome Highway we like to pay due respect to the process and we listen to as much new music as our daily activities will allow. We continue to be inspired by the depth of talent and the range of musical visions out there. We have been privileged to be in contact with a number of like-minded artists, PR companies and labels who understand what we have set out to do at Lonesome Highway. We also receive a large number of communications that fall outside the increasingly wide-ranging definition that is Americana. Often, we are included on the basis of music activity only with no real discernment for our core ethos and focus.\n\nHere are the thoughts of our chief scribes when push comes to shove and we are asked to pick our own personal favourites over the year.\n\nDECLAN CULLITON\n\nTraditional Country\n\n1.

There are so many other albums that have impressed and moved me but I have decided to focus on actual review albums for my top picks.\n\nTop 12 Favourite albums\n\nKatie Spencer - Edge Of the Land\n\nMy Politic - Missouri Folklore: Songs and Stories from Home\n\nJay Byrd - At Home Again\n\nSylvie - Sylvie\n\nRod Picott - Paper Hearts and Broken Arrows\n\nAudrey Spillman - Neon Dream\n\nSteve Dawson - Gone, Long Gone\n\nThe Mystix - Tru Vine\n\nLuke LeBlanc - Fugue State\n\nClever Hopes - Artefact\n\nEric Brace and Last Train Home - Everything Will Be\n\nFellow Pynins - Lady Mondegreen\n\nBest Irish Album\n\nPete Kavanagh - Join Up the Dots\n\nBest Irish reissue\n\nAndy Irvine/Paul Brady\n\nBest UK Folk Album\n\nConcrete Prairie - Concrete Prairie\n\nBest Compilation\n\nPaul Kelly - Time\n\nBest Retrospective\n\nBobby Allison and Gerry Spehar - Delta Man\n\nLive Gigs\n\nC2C Tour Weekend @ 3Arena, Dublin\n\nKilkenny Roots Festival\n\nOh Boy Records Tour @ The Cellar, Dublin\n\nCourtney Marie Andrews @ Liberty Hall, Dublin\n\nFelice Brothers @ Whelan’s, Dublin\n\nFellow Pynins @ The Cobblestone, Dublin\n\nJon Cleary and the Absolute Monster Gentlemen @ Whelan’s, Dublin\n\nTenille Townes @ The Workman’s Club, Dublin\n\nThe Cowboy Junkies @ NCH, Dublin\n\nHonourable mention also for the Dublin theatre tour of Girl From the North County which ran at the 3Olympia Theatre, in June/July last. It reimagined the legendary songs of Bob Dylan, like you’ve never heard them before and writer and director Conor McPherson received fulsome praise from Dylan himself when the Broadway production opened. Dylan stated that “To be associated with Conor is one of the highlights of my professional life. It goes without saying the man is a genius for putting this thing together and I’m thrilled to be a part of the experience. My songs couldn’t be in better hands.”\n\nEILÍS BOLAND\n\nAlbums of the Year\n\nPeter Rowan - Calling You From My Mountain\n\nThe Local Honeys\n\nThe Slocan Ramblers - Up The Hill and Through the Fog\n\nI Draw Slow\n\nSunny Sweeney - Married Alone\n\nThe Hanging Stars - Hollow Heart\n\nRayna Gellert & Kieran Kane - The Flowers That Bloom in Spring\n\nShawn Williams - Wallowin’ in the Night\n\nDean Owens - Sinner’s Shrine\n\nSomething Borrowed, Something New: A tribute to John Anderson\n\nGigs of the Year\n\nPeggy Seeger - The Home Place, Bellaghy\n\nThe Slocan Ramblers - Omagh Bluegrass\n\nThe Hanging Stars - Kilkenny Roots\n\nMargo Cilker - Kilkenny Roots\n\nJesse Dayton - Kilkenny Roots\n\nThe Hen House Prowlers - Westport Folk & Bluegrass\n\nThe StillHouse Junkies - Westport Folk & Bluegrass\n\nMarty Stuart & his Fabulous Superlatives - London O2\n\nJason Isbell - The Olympia, Dublin\n\nBilly Strings - O2 Forum, London\n\nFilms of the Year\n\nAn Cailin Ciuin\n\nLiquorice Pizza\n\nEmily\n\nThe Menu\n\nShe Said\n\nElvis\n\nTop Gun\n\nBones And All\n\nARTIST’S CHOICES\n\nKRISTINA MURRAY\n\nRight On – Banditos\n\nThe best effort yet from one of the most underrated rock bands in the country; this album is sublimely reflective of Banditos diverse sound blending true blue rock-n-roll with blues, country, boogie-woogie, soul, and top-notch songwriting. Plus, it’s just pure fun, from top to bottom. Mary Richardson’s voice is just unreal; be sure to see them live when you can. Favorite Tracks: title track; Waves; Said and Done.\n\nScoundrel - Sam Burchfield\n\nHad never heard of Sam Burchfield until this record and I am so glad I found him. Reminds me a little of Danny O’Keefe. Interesting songwriting and sonic arrangement; excited to be a new fan of his. Feels like this record has been criminally overlooked by the Americana world and I hope that changes for Sam in 2023. Favorite Tracks: title track; Cold Steel; Sugar Cane.\n\nNo Regular Dog - Kelsey Waldon\n\nAnother killer record by a long-time friend. Shooter Jennings and Kelsey were a great pair to create this record together; she has honed her sound and writing, and delivers these songs with conviction and, as always, you can hear her great love and reverence for country music. Dig it! Favorite Tracks: Tall and Mighty; Season’s Ending; title track.\n\nPalomino - Miranda Lambert\n\nI’ve been a fan of Miranda since her debut record and I think she just keeps getting better at making albums. Not only does she know how to write, she knows how to curate co-writers and songs that put together classic albums. Some really clever and beautiful lines on this record. Miranda is a hero. Favorite Tracks: That’s What Makes The Jukebox Play; In His Arms.\n\nBOBBY DOVE\n\nIn 2022 I scored a Charley Pride record called Charley Pride Gold and the soundtrack to Honeysuckle Rose on vinyl! My friend Charlie Treat based in Nashville put out a great record recently in November 2022 called “Into the Wild Mystic Mountain” - The Sadies released “Colder Streams” album which has the last works of the formative member and one of my inspirations, the late great Dallas Good, and my friend and fellow queer Canadian country artist Mariel Buckley put out “Everywhere I Used to Be”\n\nMICHAEL WESTON KING (My Darling Clementine)\n\nNew Albums:\n\nThe Delines - The Sea Drift\n\nMargot Cilker - Pohorylle\n\nJohn Fulbright - The Liar\n\nKevin Morby - This Is A Photograph\n\nJessie Buckley and Bernard Butler - For All Our Days That Tear the Heart\n\nMichael Head & the Red Elastic Band - Dear Scott\n\nBill Callahan - Reality\n\nArctic Monkeys - The Car\n\nEliza Carthy - Queen Of The Whirl\n\nHonourable mentions for friend’s album:\n\nDanny George Wilson - Another Place\n\nKathryn Williams - Night Drives\n\nDean Owens - Sinners Shrine\n\nRe-issues:\n\nWilliam Bell - Never Like This Before - The Complete ‘Blue’ Stax Singles 1961-1968’ on Ace\n\nVarious - The Golden Age Of Peter Bogdanovic on Cherry Red\n\nVarious - David Hepworth Deep 70s - Underrated Cuts From a Misunderstood Decade\n\nRodger Wilhoit - The Social World Of Rodger Wilhoit\n\nVarious - You Showed Me - The Songs Of Gene Clark on Ace\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival - At the Royal Albert Hall, April 14, 1970\n\nFilms:\n\nKurt Vonnegut - Unstuck In Time\n\nElvis\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin\n\nThe Worst Person In The World\n\nEMILY NENNI\n\nTeddy and the Rough Riders - self titled. It’s a great record start to finish. It’s country, it’s rock, and it’s current but there’s something warm and familiar ability it. Produced by Margo Price, she was pretty pregnant at the time and invited me into the vocal booth with her to sing harmonies together. That was pretty special. I’m such a fan of Jack Quiggins and Ryan Jennings songwriting, and it’s engineered by my favorite guy to do it, Jake Davis.\n\nKelsey Waldon - No Regular Dog. I can’t express how much I admire Kelsey for making music with such integrity, and like her past releases, this record is so true to her. That being said, it’s so relatable. She pays homage to her upbringing and writes with vulnerability and strength. Sweet Little Girl always gives me chills.\n\nJoshua Hedley - Neon Blue. I consider myself to be a honky tonk woman, and this record is another prime example of what makes Josh a honky tonk man. He’s truly keeping traditional country music alive and I love how this record is just as country and western as his debut, Mr. Jukebox, but it’s a twostep through a different decade. And any record with a Roger Miller song on it gets two thumbs up from me.\n\nErin Rae - Lighten Up. She writes with such compassion and empathy, and her songs are a reflection of how beautiful a person Erin is. Modern Woman and True Love’s Face are just two off the record that hit me hard the first time I listened to them. The world could use a whole lot more people who think about people and understand them like she does.\n\nOrville Peck - Bronco. It’s a beautiful record and these songs brought the house down at the Ryman. I just love the following Orville has; it’s people from all walks of life and a lot of folks you’re not going to see at some country shows. I appreciate what Orville does and how he may turn on non-country loving folks to country music, and shows the honky tonk crowd that fans of the music don’t all look the same. It’s very special.\n\nMARIEL BUCKLEY\n\nKelsey Waldon - No Regular Dog\n\nI was stoked that Kelsey Waldon and I were releasing music on the same day this year, and this record was a constant staple since its drop in the summer time. A warm, inviting companion with great songs throughout, it plays year-round like an old friend.\n\nMegan Thee Stallion - Traumazine\n\nI’m aware that this probably comes out of left field for some, but this is such a no nonsense, powerful record with undertones of feminism and that underdog spirit I just can’t resist. It fully slaps.\n\nCaitlin Rose - Cazimi\n\nI’m sure I’m not the only one who’s been eagerly awaiting her return to music, but this album is awesome. This album proves her commitment to quirky, thoughtful songwriting and unexpected arrangements, but still full of ear worms and memorable moments.\n\nTeddy & The Roughriders - Self-Titled\n\nThis one was a tour-van staple, right up my alley for a roadie with pals or driving to the next cold beer. Female-produced, fun, well-executed, tight and a great listen back-to-back to back. Can’t wait to see this band live!\n\nSkinny Dyck - Palace Waiting\n\nHad to throw props to a fellow Canadian and one of my fav dudes making tunes, this EP may have snuck under a few radars but these 6 songs are near perfect and carry Skinny’s signature laissez-faire panache. He’s one to watch in a big way.\n\nALMA RUS\n\nRiver Fool’s & Mountain Saints by Ian Noe\n\nI love the skinny’s pictures he paints. You can see and feel Appalachia so clearly, through haunting and cinematic lenses.\n\nWorld Without Tears by Lucinda Williams.\n\nThis album has always and will always mean a lot to me, so it’s not really unique to this year. Lucinda Williams has been my top artist on Spotify for 2 or 3 years in a row. Her songs feel like old friends to me, raw and real, sexy and serene, and while it’s hard to choose one favorite, this may be my favorite album of hers.\n\nDeprecated by John R. Miller\n\nThis album feels so good. I hope and pray that one day I’ll get to see people the way that John R. Miller illustrates them in his songs.\n\nLong Time Coming by Sierra Ferrell\n\nHow can one not be on the Sierra Ferrell train? I believe she is probably the best singer in country and Americana music right now.\n\nRed Headed Stranger by Willie Nelson\n\nI’ve always loved Willie of course, but this past year I got into the habit of listening to this album through. Feels like you’re walking with Willie through the desert.\n\nPieces of the Sky by Emmylou Harris\n\nEmmylou sings of sadness and longing so beautifully, and this album is my favorite example of that.\n\nThe Deslondes by The Deslondes\n\nThe Deslondes make me feel like I’m chilling by the Mississippi River on a sweet summer day. Their music is fun and honest.\n\nStrange Country by Kacy & Clayton\n\nThis album is dramatic and beautiful. I love her voice.\n\nViva Terlingua by Jerry Jeff Walker\n\nLondon Homesick Blues is definitely my favorite track on that one, too.\n\nDEAN OWENS\n\nTo be honest I haven’t listened to a lot of new music this past year, but done a lot of revisiting records that I’d either forgotten about or missed first time around. My friends Calexico released a great new record El Mirador. It’s always a good day when a new Calexico record is released into the world. Their records have been the soundtrack to many, many road trips over the years. There are some killer tracks on the new record. The new Gaby Moreno record - Alegoría is beautiful. I’m not picking these records just because both artists feature on my new record Sinner’s Shrine. They’re fab records. Gaby has a stunning voice and there’s a great feel to this new record.\n\nI’ve really enjoyed The Killers new album - Pressure Machine. They’re not a band I’ve listened to much, but a good friend recommended I check it out and I wasn’t disappointed. It’s got an interesting theme running throughout the whole album and there are some killer tunes on there. My friends Neilson Hubbard and Joshua Britt made the video for the track Quiet Town. The War On Drugs record - I Don’t Live Here Anymore is a lovely thing. I always find their music kinda comforting. Their sound has something of the 80’s about it. In a good way. I hear Dylan, The Waterboys and 80’s Springsteen vibes. I enjoyed the new Wilco album - Cruel Country and my buddy Grant Lee Phillips released a cool new record All That You Can Dream.\n\nAn album I really fell in love with this year is Talk Talk’s Laughing Stock. I love Mark Hollis and Talk Talk, but never gave this album much of a chance first time around. I have it on vinyl now and it’s a stunning piece of work, as is Mark’s solo album, which I’ve also listened to a lot this past year. I’ve really been enjoying rediscovering David Sylvian’s - Secrets Of The Beehive. A lovely, warm and rich sounding record. I need to get that on vinyl. Another old album that’s been played a lot this year is the beautiful Changing Places by the Tord Gustavsen Trio. This album has accompanied me on many a train journey from my new home in the Scottish Borders up to my beloved Edinburgh, to visit family and friends.\n\nSHAWN WILLIAMS\n\nI’m still digging albums from 2021, so many good releases, but here are my favourites from 2022\n\nThe Kills - No Wow (The Tchad Blake Mix)\n\nRyan Adams - Chris\n\nRyan Adams - Romeo & Juliet\n\nWet Leg - Wet Leg\n\nFather John Misty - Chloe\n\nCarson McHone - Still Life\n\nMorgan Wade - Acoustic Sessions\n\nCaroline Spence - True North\n\nRICHARD OLSON (The Hanging Stars)\n\nI’ve never been hip and I never will be. I’m always late to the party and I always leave last as you can clearly see below. So, in no particular order here is some music, old and new, that I’ve enjoyed over this blessed year of 2022.\n\nNight Beats - That’s All You Got (Single 2020)\n\nI’ve always been a latent fan of the Nightbeats ever since my old band supported them at a grotty London venue a good few years back. But this neo garage soul banger has proved to be a reliable and comforting friend during what’s been a challenging year for me.\n\nFarmer Dave Scher - Ocean Eyes (EP 2020)\n\nThe Beachwood Sparks multi-instrumentalist dives deep into the Pacific Ocean on this starry eyed, wave crashing beauty of a song that draws from everything west coast to Enya. Perhaps the defining song of the New Spacore Movement. Thanks Curation Records.\n\nAnne Briggs - Blackwater Side (Album 1971)\n\nAnne is a constant companion of mine and should be as celebrated as any Joni or Karen Dalton. As a matter of fact, I’ve always seen her as the UK version of Karen Dalton. But that’s probably a silly thing to say. Her voice makes me feel safe in the knowledge that it’ll all come tumbling down upon us at some point or another. And you know what? That’s cool.\n\nSylvie - Falls on Me (EP 2021)\n\nKindred spirits of The Hanging Stars for sure. These guys got the production, songwriting, voices and performance all nailed down in the same barge we also loiter. The fact that they named themselves after an Iain Matthews song only makes me love them more\n\nSpacemen 3 - Playing With Fire (Album 1989)\n\nThe first few days being away on our two-week European tour in November I felt out of place and ill at ease. However, medicine was about to be administered in the shape of a lonesome walk through a grey drizzling Hamburg dock with this album in my headphones. Sadness turned to bliss in 46 minutes and 45 seconds.\n\nBarbara Keith - Detroit or Buffalo (Album 1970)\n\nMy guiding star at the moment when it comes to discoveries of songs and deep cuts old or new is our friend and main Choogler Bobby Lee who turned me on to this. Everything you ever wanted from a country rock album released in 1970. You do the maths.\n\nAGS CONNOLLY\n\nDiscoveries\n\nDerrick McLendon - a superb singer and songwriter from Texas/Louisiana. I find his earthy songs bring Chris Knight and Guy Clark to mind\n\nRichard Inman - Richard is known in the serious Canadian songwriting circles but his lack of online presence meant it took a while for me to encounter his stuff. I’m very glad I did\n\nGreg Brown - I’m sure many will (rightly) scoff at me taking so long to properly hear Greg. Not sure how these songs escaped me before now but his lyrics are great and demand repeated listens.\n\nRediscoveries\n\nChristopher Cross - yes, that one. ‘Yacht rock’ it may be but I feel dim for not focusing on him before. Songs, voice, chops - it’s all there.\n\nBrooks & Dunn - stuff like this was talked about as being desperate and outdated when I started learning about country music, but in reality these guys had some great songs that were undeniably true country.\n\nPAUL McGEE\n\nIt’s been another challenging year for many. The Covid virus, and its variants, continued to dictate the manner in which our lives have changed. Even with the easing of restrictions, there were still a lot of constraining factors; not least the challenges faced by the music industry.\n\nWith live gigs shut down for most of the year, certainly in Ireland where I’m living, the opportunity to earn much needed income was hugely curtailed for most performing artists. It was a time to retreat to homes and local studios in order to create new music that reflected the mindset of musicians and songwriters. Many dusted off old songs that had been unfinished and others took the time to reimagine previous work in new formats. Creativity brings its own rewards of course and I recall a quotation; “Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations.”\n\nWell, in Lonesome Highway we’ve been given many gifts throughout the year, in the form of new music from all corners of this troubled globe. Despite the anxiety and unease, the creative output of artists and musicians has been a continued source of inspiration and motivation to me.\n\nThe choices that I have made for my year-end list are comprised of music that I have reviewed. There are so many other albums that have impressed and moved me, but I have decided to focus on actual review albums in my top picks. The other categories are also choices where I have personal experience of the selections – whether books that I have read or films that I have seen.\n\nTop 20 Favourite albums:\n\nSteve Dawson - At The Bottom Of A Canyon In The Branches Of A Tree\n\nDar Williams - ’ll Meet You Here\n\nJackson Browne - Downhill From Everywhere\n\nHiss Golden Messenger - Gently Blowing It\n\nJames McMurtry - The Horses and the Hounds\n\nSean McConnell - A Horrible Beautiful Dream\n\nCraig Cardiff - All This Time Running\n\nGarrison Starr - Girl I Used To Be\n\nAnnie Keating - Bristol County Tides\n\n3HatTrio - Lost Sessions\n\nJesse Terry - When We Wander\n\nDoug Hoekstra - The Day Deserved\n\nThe Golden Roses - Devil’s In The Details\n\nBrigitte DeMeyer - Seeker\n\nGeorgia English - Pain and Power\n\nClint Morgan - Troublemaker\n\nSuzie Ungerleider - My Name Is…\n\nJoe Stamm Band - Midwest Town\n\nBrandon Isaak - Modern Primitive\n\nEvans McRae - Only Skin\n\nBest Irish Albums:\n\nJane Willow - Burn So Bright\n\nSammy Horner - Far Away Places\n\nRev Sam & the Outcasts - Stet\n\nBest UK Folk Albums:\n\nHenry Parker - Lammas Fair\n\nJim Ghedi - In the Furrows Of Common Place\n\nJohn Smith - The Fray\n\nBest Live Albums:\n\nDanny and the Champions Of the World - Los Campeones En Vivo\n\nLaura Nyro - Trees of the Ages: Live in Japan\n\nNeil Young and Crazy Horse - Way Down In the Rust Bucket\n\nBest Compilations:\n\nHighway Butterfly - The Songs Of Neal Casal\n\nBruce Cockburn - Greatest Hits (1970 - 2020)\n\nJoni Mitchell - The Reprise Albums (1968–1971)\n\nBooks:\n\nRichard Thompson - Beeswing\n\nCowboy Junkies - Music Is the Drug\n\nMary Gauthier - Saved By A Song\n\nChrista Couture - How To Lose Everything\n\nKelefa Sanneh - A History of Popular Music in Seven Genres\n\nBest Films:\n\nSongs For While I’m Away - The Phil Lynott Story\n\nThe Sparks Brothers - Sparks documentary\n\nRespect - Aretha Franklin biopic\n\nLive Gigs:\n\nKila - Opium October 2021\n\nPaddy Casey - Whelan’s October 2021\n\nRichard Thompson - Vicar Street November 2021\n\nThe Remedy Club - The Grand Social December 2021\n\nLive music returned in early October, on a restricted basis, as Covid constraints began to unwind. This proved to be a source of happy release for everyone. The joy of musicians playing to an audience was almost overwhelming after eighteen months of silence in the venues of Dublin. Sadly, at the time of writing, new restrictions have been introduced for the Christmas season, which has led to many gigs being cancelled or deferred. So much for a return to the timeless pleasures of live music. We watch this space…\n\nHonourable mention also for three worthy albums that were released in 2020 but were reviewed in 2021 for reasons beyond my control:\n\nMartin Simpson Home Recordings\n\nDave Clancy The Path\n\nScott Cook Tangle Of Souls\n\nDECLAN CULLITON\n\nCountry:\n\n1 Sierra Ferrell – Long Time Coming\n\n2 Bobby Dove – Hopeless Romantic\n\n3 Mose Wilson – Self Titled\n\n4 Mike & The Moonpies – One To Grow On\n\n5 Charley Crockett – Music City USA\n\n6 Jesse Daniel – Beyond These Walls\n\n7 Connie Smith – The Cry Of My Heart\n\n8 West Of Texas – Heartaches, Hangovers & Honky Tonks\n\n9 Charlie Marie – Ramble On\n\n10 Charley Crockett – Ten For Slim\n\n11 Melissa Carper – Daddy’s Country Gold\n\n12 Summer Dean – Bad Romantic\n\n13 Wild Earp & The Free For All – Dyin’ For Easy Livin’\n\n14 Hannah Juanita – Hardliner\n\n15 Katie Joe – Pawn Shop Queen\n\nAmericana:\n\n1 Margo Cilker – Pohorylle\n\n2 The Felice Brothers – From Dreams To Dust\n\n3 Starry Eyed & Laughing – Bells of Lightning\n\n4 Esther Rose – How Many Times\n\n5 Mac Leaphart – Music City Joke\n\n6 Dori Freeman – Ten Thousand Roses\n\n7 The Pink Stones – Introducing The Pink Stones\n\n8 Hope Dunbar – Sweetheartland\n\n9 Shannon McNally – The Waylon Sesions\n\n10 Son Volt – Electo Melodier\n\n11 Ana Egge – Between Us\n\n12 John R Miller – Depreciated\n\n13 Rose City Band – Earth Trip\n\n14 Riddy Arman – Self Titled\n\n15 Holly Macve – Not The Gir\n\nFavourites outside the Country / Americana genres:\n\n1 Stuffy Shmitt – More Stuff Happens\n\n2 John Murry – The Stars Are God’s Bullet Holes\n\n3 Peter Bruntnell – Journey To The Sun\n\n4 Side Pony – Lucky Break\n\nCompilation:\n\nChoctaw Ridge – New Fables of The American South 1968 – 1973\n\nCovers Album:\n\nShaye Zadravec – Now And Then\n\nLive Album:\n\nGlen Campbell – Live From The Troubadour\n\nEILÍS BOLAND\n\nTop 10 albums (in no particular order):\n\nJustin Moses - Fall Like Rain\n\nJohn Blek - on ether & air\n\nDarin & Brooke Aldridge - This Life we’re Livin’\n\nBilly Strings - Renewal\n\nJames McMurtry - The Horses and the Hounds\n\nNora Brown - Sidetrack My Engine\n\nBela Fleck - My Bluegrass Heart\n\nIsrael Nash - Topaz\n\nSierra Ferrell - Long Time Coming\n\nAmythyst Kiah - Wary & Strange\n\nTop gigs:\n\nMary Coughlan - The Black Box, Belfast Dec\n\nPeter Bruntnell - The Half Moon, London Oct\n\nJohn Murry - The Ulster Social Club, Belfast Sep\n\nMalojian - The American Bar, Belfast Oct\n\nJames McMurtry - Facebook live\n\nTop movie: Wildfire\n\nSTEPHEN RAPID\n\nFirstly I would like to thank, on behalf of the Lonesome Highway team, all the PR persons, Labels and Artists who continue to make music against the odds. Not everything we receive gets reviewed or works for us on certain levels. That would be an impossible task physically and since the lockdown we receive many more considerations than previously but we do thank those who continue to send both digital and physical product. However, it is also quite apparent that a great many people who send music to us have no idea who or what we are and many of the releases are totally off target. We are first and foremost fans and from those that we appreciate, we make our selections.\n\nSticking to the roots of country (in no ranked order):\n\n1 Legendary Shack * Shakers - Cockadoodledeux\n\n2 Moot Davies - Seven Cities Of Gold\n\n3 Stephen Flatt - Cumberland Bones\n\n4 West Of Texas - Heartaches, Hangovers and Honkytonks\n\n5 Jesse Daniel - Beyond These Walls\n\n6 Ward Hayden & The Outliers - Free Country\n\n7 Elijah Ocean - Born Blue\n\n8 Sierra Ferrrell - Long Time Coming\n\n9 Jason Ringenberg - Rhinestoned\n\n10 Dallas Moore - Rain\n\n11 The Shootouts - Bullseye\n\n12 Wild Earp - Dyin’ For Easy Livin’\n\n13 Jason Boland & The Stragglers - The Light Saw Me\n\n14 Bard Edrington V - Two Days In Terlingua\n\n15 Sturgill Simpson -The Ballad Of Dood & Juanita\n\n16 JP Harris - Don’t Marry No Railroadman\n\n17 The Flatlanders - Treasure Of Love\n\n18 Zachary Lucky - Songs For Hard Times\n\n19 Mose Wilson - Self Titled\n\n20 Mike & The Moonpies – One To Grow On\n\nAmericana The umbrella for the rest (in no ranked order):\n\n1 Charles Wesley Goodwin - How The Mighty Fall\n\n2 Heath Cullen - Springtime In My heart\n\n3 Chris J Norwood - I Am Nor Cool\n\n4 Kiely Connell - Caslumet Queen\n\n5 Ross Adams - Escaping Southern Heat\n\n6 Ian Fisher - American Standards\n\n7 Nathan Bell - Red, White And American Blues\n\n8 Daniel Meade - Ever Wonder Why You Get Outta Bed?\n\n9 Starry Eyed And Laughing - Bells Of Lightning\n\n10 Rod Picott - Wood, Steel, Dust And Dreams\n\n11 Steve Almaas - Everywhere You’ve Been\n\n12 KC Jones - Queen Of The Inbetween\n\n13 Mary Duff - Razor Blade Smile\n\n14 Tim Grimm - Gone\n\n15 Malcolm MacWatt - Settler\n\nARTIST CHOICES\n\nJASON RINGENBERG\n\nShovels and Rope The Human Race\n\nBob Dylan Springtime in NY\n\nJason Isbell Georgia Blue\n\nTommy Womack I Thought I Was Fine\n\nCharlie Crockett Music City USA\n\nMARY DUFF\n\n1 Julian Lage - Squint\n\nUnadulterated genius on the pointy end of the jazz stick.\n\n2 John Murry - The Stars are Gods Bullet Holes\n\nBrilliant lyrical webs are spun by earnest vocals and captured without production pretense.\n\n3 Melissa Carper - Daddy’s Gold\n\nPure enjoyment from start to finish with a hint of nostalgia and not a shred of flimflammery.\n\n4 Carolyn Wonderland - Tempting Fate\n\nCarolyn playing guitars, singing and Produced by Dave Alvin …WINNER!\n\n5 Jade Bird -Different Kinds of Light\n\nGreat Writer, Great Singer, Reliable Observer. I like to jog on the river to this record.\n\n6 Heartless Bastards - A Beautiful Life\n\nRevolution.” Enuff said.\n\n7 Samantha Fish - Faster\n\nShe’s licking a Gibson Firebird on the cover and she plays her ass off, as usual! The songs are great, production is just about flawless and she swings from the best of Blues, Pop, Rock & Cry your eyes out Ballad. All Ice No Whiskey should sell as many records as Britney’s Toxic.\n\n8 Side Pony - Lucky Break\n\nSo honest and raw yet polished, packaged and Perfect! These women as solo artists are divine, but together they create A Duosonic Delight!\n\n9 Jose Gonzales -Local Valley\n\nHIS VOICE!!!!! The sound of a nylon guitar is special. Willie always made that obvious but Jose takes it somewhere else and his hypnotic style and compositions always impress me.\n\n10 Mathew James Adkins -Stoned on my Own\n\nFor a debut record, I was pretty blown away by this one but it’s no surprise when you consider it’s on Whistle Pig records and Produced by Detroit’s own Bunky Hunt. Sincere and packed with Mighty Feels, Matt’s debut deserves EARS!\n\nJERRY DALE McFADDEN (The Mavericks)\n\nFlyte - This Is Really Going to Hurt\n\nThad Cockrell - In Case You Feel the Same\n\nAimee Mann - Queens of the Summer Hotel\n\nThe Mavericks - En Español (Edición Deluxe)\n\nWILD EARP\n\nSturgill Simpson - The Ballad of Dood and Juanita\n\nI love concept albums, and this one is so well produced. I liked Sturgill’s bluegrass stuff just fine, but this one with a prologue, epilogue, and sound effects is my bread and butter.\n\nMelissa Carper - Daddy’s Country Gold\n\nThis album is pure fair weather back porch Sunday afternoon. She’s got the vibe dialed in just right, and the songs are all winners. I find myself singing “Would You Like to Get Some Goats?” fairly often.\n\nJesse Daniel - Beyond These Walls\n\nWhen it comes down to it, I probably like Jesse’s 2020 Rollin’ On a little better as a whole, but this one has some great tunes and some ambitious moments. I had only heard Clayton Was a Cowboy once during a livestream of his, but I realized when I heard it on the album I already remembered so much of the song. He’s making some great country music, and I’m really rooting for the guy.\n\nCharley Crockett - 10 for Slim\n\nI thought Charley did a really great job with these songs, and the genuine admiration for James Hand comes through clearly. Of course any album that starts with a spoken word intro is definitely starting off on the right foot in my book.\n\nSierra Ferrell - Long Time Coming\n\nSierra seems to be everywhere online, and has for the past couple of years (I’ve also randomly run into her a couple times in Nashville, which adds to a sense of her ubiquity). I was surprised that this was her first full-length, and the name speaks to that, but it’s a super solid record all around. She really runs the gamut across her varied musical styles, and I’m all for it. I especially dig her darker, minor key offerings. I saw her recently on tour, and she and her band just crushed it.\n\nMARGO CILKER\n\nTen Thousand Roses - Dori Freeman\n\nI find everything about Dori’s art charming- her songs’ hooks, her vibrato, her living in small-town Virginia… Every time I bring up this album with someone else on the Freeman Train, there’s a moment where we burst into “Today I felt just like a movie staaaar, driving down the highway cryin’ in my caaaaar”. Her songs feel anthemic. Dori owns the space she holds in the world. They resonate straight to the core of the listener (at least this one). One more thing I’ll add is that I like how the production doesn’t distract, but digging into the guitar parts and drum parts after the first few listens is truly a delight in itself.\n\nHome Sweet Nowhere - Lowstar Rodeo\n\nKevin Carducci, half of the California country band The Easy Leaves, released my favourite “quarantine album” in January 2021. He’s singing what the freshly unemployed songwriters were thinking in the months of bewilderment… Will things reopen? Is it worth writing songs? Should I write a song about “These walls”? Does my friend have a good enough home recording set-up to overdub pedal steel for me? It’s weepy, and that’s what makes certain lines on the record so triumphant: “Today must be my lucky day… this guitar in my hand sounds like a five-piece country band”. We’ve been there. The peaks and valleys of the last few years were strangely familiar territory to the artist community, as devastating as they were. Carducci comes across here comfortable looking for the silver lining.\n\nWarm Buildings - Junior\n\nThere’s a nostalgia for me in this Missoula band’s latest effort Warm Buildings … maybe the same kind of partner ripped our hearts out; maybe we’ve driven the same Montana back-road crying, or smoked behind the same bars. It’s chock-full of great imagery- see “Midnight Summer”. That song will paint you right into that night with a cold drink in your hand. On another song, Blue Bathroom we see an excellent use of repetition I’ve come to love about their music. Both the chorus “I worry about you in your blue bathroom” and the kind-of haunting anti-chorus “Wasn’t gonna work out” ring in your head after listening. For all the luxurious clouds of I-IV changes to sink into, the record also has some outside-the-box chord progressions that add to the experience- especially while bolstering the lyric “Cause I’m the raccoon at your cat door”. Woman of the Woods, indeed. I’ll also add I love a recording effort that features multiple songwriters, and Junior executes this well. Eric Heywood pedal steel, stacked harmonies, heart-wrenching takes on friendship and love, perfectly droned out strings, and guitar fuzz al gusto… I’m sold.\n\nFavourite Singles of the year:\n\nThe Whiskey Wouldn’t Let me Pray- Queen Esther\n\nNew Bikini- Cassandra Jenkins\n\nTONY POOLE (Starry Eyed And Laughing)\n\nIntroduction: I’ve liked so many releases during this weird time, including quite a few ‘mainstream’ best sellers, but I’ve listed some here that are possibly more obscure, in the hope that they at least get checked out by your readers ...\n\nNelson Bragg - Gratitude Blues\n\nNelson was a long-time member of Brian Wilson’s touring band, and this, his 3rd album, is a beautiful peak Beach Boys\\West Coast\\Byrds sounding collection - great songs and incredible harmonies. Hopefully not his last (as he modestly claims). The CD package is a work of art too ...\n\nThe Green Pajamas - Sunlight Might Weigh Even More\n\nA group who’ve been under the radar for almost as long as Starry Eyed & Laughing ... 33 albums since 1984, and this new one continues and develops their psychedelic excellence - this is Electric Banana (The Pretty Things) for the 21st century.\n\nSusanna Hoffs - Bright Lights\n\nThe Bangles deserve so much more respect than their great hit singles indicate - they kept alive the music and spirit of the 60s when it was completely out of fashion. And this beautiful album by Susanna continues that, with perfect choices and versions of important songs by some of my favourite artists.\n\nThe Coral - Coral Island\n\nI’ve been a fan of The Coral for 2 decades now - they seemed to carry a brilliant torch in a line from all my favourite 60s ‘groups’ through later decades favourites The Las and Cast, and this album continues that excellence.\n\nAimee Mann - Queens of the Summer Hotel\n\nBeen a fan of Aimee Mann since I heard her incredible Fifty Years After The Fair with Roger McGuinn’s Rickenbacker and harmony vocals (is that a surprise ?!) on her first album Whatever. But this new record is completely the opposite of that jangle sound, with aching Bacharach-like arrangements and Judee Sill-like melodies - though her amazing wordcraft and beautiful voice remain a constant.\n\nMICHELLE BILLINGSLEY\n\nEven if the pandemic is putting a damper on live music as we know it (or at least as we can remember what it used to be), so much good music came out this year. There’s been a lot of thought into each of the artists who chose to release music this year, and I’m sure a ton have played it safe and held onto their releases, so I’m glad some brave souls thought now is the time. Here’s some of my favourites:\n\nMelissa Carper - Daddy’s Country Gold\n\nMy favourite album of 2021. Sweet, dreamy, perfect. It’ll make a western swing fan out of everyone. I listen to it at least once a month.\n\nBill and the Belles - Happy Again\n\nFun and inventive, with amazing harmonies. Queue this one up after Daddy’s Country Gold on long car rides.\n\nWild Earp & The Free for Alls - Dyin’ for Easy Livin’\n\nEarp knows how to make an album that makes you feel like you’re in the front row of a rowdy show. But then you listen again, for the lyrics this time, and you realize how dang GOOD he is at ALL of it.\n\nMikaela Finne - Time Stands Still\n\nSometimes you need some badass gal energy to pep you up when you lose yours. She’s got you.\n\nNoel McKay - Blue, Blue, Blue\n\nAs soon as it ended, I listened to it all the way through again. It’s a cloudy day on the couch album, it’s a hanging out on a summer porch album, it’s a tinkering on your car album. There’s a song for every mood.\n\nMy most favourite Song of 2021:\n\nCharlie Marie - El Paso\n\nSuch a fantastic melody and lyrics, and her voice! I listen to it once and it’s on repeat in my head for three days.\n\nMAC LEAPHART\n\nThe Pink Stones - Introducing the Pink Stones\n\nI’ve really been digging this album-very cosmic/hippie country vibes. Great guitar & steel work, and I really like Hunter’s vocals-he puts this extra emphasis/half shout thing on some lines that I think is really cool.\n\nGotten to play some shows on the road with them, as well. Fun to hang out with, and they do a great version of the George Jones song, Her Name is. Fantastic stuff.\n\nMelissa Carper - Daddy’s Country Gold\n\nFirst time I heard a track off this album, I genuinely thought it was an artist from the 60s that had flown under my radar. The songs and the production are fantastic. I heard the album made the initial list in the Grammy Roots category. I don’t think it made the final cut, but it certainly should have. It’s a great record.\n\nBobby Dove - Hopeless Romantic\n\nI met Bobby at a Gram Parsons Tribute in Nashville and Bobby was definitely one of the artists I remember from that night. We released our albums right about the same time, and I just thought it was a great record Top To Bottom. Solid stuff-fantastic album.\n\nJohn R Miller - Depreciated\n\nThis album has great songs and also quite a bit of groove, which is something I don’t hear enough of in the Americana world. Great Sunday morning coffee album.\n\nMike & The Moonpies - One To Grow On\n\nThese guys seem to put out a great new record every year-very consistent quality. I still haven’t seen them live, which is on my list, because the recordings scream: “Great live band!”\n\nAnglea Autumn - Frontiers Woman\n\nThis album wasn’t on my radar, but we ended up on the same bill and she put on a stellar set, and ended up singing with me on my song, Window From the Sky as well as the old Townes tune, Snowin On Raton, I went home and listened to her album and it was just fantastic. Great stuff. Excited to hear more from her.\n\nHunter Hicks - Self Titled\n\nHunter was a recommended artist from Angela Backstrom’s Spotify page-and I checked it out, and it was some really vibey cool stuff. Can’t wait to hear more from him, either.\n\nANA EGGE\n\nDua Lipa - Future Nostalgia Moonlight Edition\n\nIt was necessarily a good year for dancing at home and I probably danced the most to “don’t start now” and “levitating” from this album. I really love the production on “don’t start now” it starts out with that loud bass line and vocals and then the bass completely disappears for the first chorus. Less is more and more! Also, fun fact-some of that video was filmed at a small venue I’ve played many times called Pete’s Candy Store in Brooklyn.\n\nAllison Russell - Outside Child\n\nWhat a phenomenal album. So beautiful, haunting, brave. Highly recommended! It’s really incredible. We toured together for a while in a band called Salt and I helped co-produce an EP for them years back that ended up getting repurposed as individual tracks for another album. I hope she wins a Grammy or two or three!\n\nJudee Sill - Down Where The Valleys Are Low: Another Otherworld (tribute album produced by Lorenzo Wolff)\n\nWow, I love this record! When I first heard it, I got pulled in more and more with each track. Every song features a different singer. (Check out The Pearl, feat. Bartees Strange!) Upon first listen, by the third track I’d pretty much decided I wanted to work with whoever produced this magic on my next album. And I did. Lorenzo produced Between Us.\n\nJoy Oladokun - In Defense Of My Own Happiness\n\nI saw her tiny desk performance immediately loved her writing, her voice, her presence. I already got tickets to her next show here next spring.\n\nMick Flannery and Susan O’Neill - In The Game\n\nI’m a lover of Micks past albums and he and I co-wrote a bunch of the songs on my new album Between Us. This is another great collaboration.\n\nGRACE MORRISON\n\nMusic for me this year has been a big ol’ mix of the old and the new. Taylor Swift’s Evermore and Folklore were the soundtrack to my drives to the studio to put the finishing touches on my album. They’re so elegantly written and produced, and have created a musical soundscape all their own. And selfishly, knowing they were written about figures and homes from Newport, Rhode Island (a half hour drive from me) makes them feel particularly close to me.\n\nA voice in country music that I love is Kacey Musgraves. Star Crossed is pretty different from her first couple of records, and it took me a couple of listens to get into it. But I’m glad I gave her the time. Such quirky turns of phrase, and accessible vocals. Her singing doesn’t show off any vocal acrobatics that I can think of…and she doesn’t need to. The songwriting is just so good.\n\nPrior to writing with her for my record, I hadn’t listened to much of Lori McKenna’s solo stuff. I can’t tell you why, but what a loss for me. I’ve really dug in over the past year, and The Bird and the Rifle is hands down one of my favourite records of all time. The song Old Men Young Women, I don’t even know what to say. It’s perfect. And when that chorus hits, it gets me every time.\n\nThese last two aren’t albums, but songs that I’ve fallen in love with. I was fortunate enough to be a finalist in a songwriting competition judged by Kim Richey and Walt Wilkins. It was a lovely weekend long event at the most gorgeous ranch in Texas, and the whole thing ended with a concert by the judges. I was particularly blown away by Kim’s song Chase Wild Horses and Walt’s Trains I Missed. If you haven’t heard ‘em, you gotta hear ‘em!!\n\nBECKY WARREN\n\nIn no particular order, my favourites have been:\n\nIt’s a Beautiful Day and I Love You - Jillette Johnson\n\nDaddy’s Country Gold - Melissa Carper\n\nAmerican Siren - Emily Scott Robinson\n\nBlue, Blue, Blue - Noel McKay\n\nStand for Myself - Yola\n\nCatspaw - Matthew Sweet\n\nAYCOCK TERRY\n\nDori Freeman - The Storm\n\nHighway Butterfly - The Songs of Neal Casal\n\nStarlight Cleaning co. – Self Titled\n\nDaniel Romano’s Outfit - Cobra Poems\n\nKaren Paris - A Song is Way Above the Lawn\n\nKieth Hudson - Flesh of my Skin Blood of my Blood\n\nPopol Vuh - Acoustic and Ambient Spheres (vinyl box set)\n\nBob Dylan - Springtime in New York\n\nMicheal Hurley - The Time of the Foxgloves\n\nScott Hirsch - Windless Day\n\nBOBBY DOVE\n\nI thank you for asking me to participate, my favourite albums of the year - I’m honestly not sure... I heard snippets of songs and albums mostly and was often lost in my own Dove shaped rabbit hole.\n\nBut let me think about it:\n\nI tend to listen to the same old The Best Of Joe Ely 20th Century Masters The Millennium Collection when in doubt!\n\nMore recently, there is Nick Campbell (my 17yr old prodigious honky tonk/western swing/rockabilly pal in Peterborough, Ontario) who released his debut record Livin and Other Western Ideas shortly after mine.\n\nI would also like to mention my badass friend (and paramour), Bebe Buckskin who is indigenous from Alberta. She put out a great blues-rock album this year called Captain Medicine - recorded at Fame studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama.\n\nJohn Prine’s single I Remember Everything (or was that 2020?) Either way feels like this has all been one stupid year and that song tore me apart, and should be mentioned as often as possible.\n\nMOSE WILSON\n\nMelissa Carper - Daddy’s Country Gold\n\nMelissa Carper’s Daddy’s Country Gold is not only my favourite album of the year, it’s my favourite of the last 10, and one of my favourites of all time. It is country song writing at its finest with some of the best players Nashville has to offer (which, in my opinion, means they are the best in the world.) Her voice is high and lonesome and feels like it came from an era before FM radio and coloured TV. Sad never sounded so good.\n\nSarah Jarosz - Blue Heron\n\nWhen asked to list my favourite records of the year, I realized how little I listen to modern music. I get stuck in the old stuff, and I am grateful for the opportunity to write this article because it forced me to explore new waters and find records like Sarah Jarosz latest release, Blue Heron. It is a uniquely beautiful blend of folk, pop, bluegrass, and classical themes. Just roll a J, set the needle down on the record, sit back, and enjoy the ride.\n\nJohn R. Miller - Depreciated\n\nMr. Miller proves he is an original with Depreciated. It’s as funky as it is twangy, and his smooth delivery of clever and captivating lyrics make for a great piece of art. I was humming his tunes long after listening.\n\nGarrett T. Capps - I Love San Antone\n\nI met this Texas Honky Tonk hero last November when I played his club in San Antonio. I had not heard his music before meeting him, but had heard his name. So, on the long drive back to Nashville I gave his latest record, I Love San Antone, a listen. What I found was a proud San Antonian that knows his Texas country music. From western swing to Tejano and everything in between, Garrett T. Capps delivers on his new release; I love San Antone.\n\nHannah Juanita - Hardliner\n\nI nearly didn’t put this record in my list because I had so much involvement with it and felt I was being biased. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized I couldn’t leave it out because what I love most about this album is what made me want to produce and play guitar on it in the first place––the songs. Hannah Juanita‘s writing is catchy, clever, at times heartbreaking but always fun. And she sings them with the same integrity as greats like Dolly, Tammy, and Loretta. If you are a true country fan, then you need to give this record a spin.\n\nSHAYE ZADRAVEC\n\nI’ve come up with a list of albums that caught my ear and heart this year. I’m listing them randomly and completely without a rating system. I love them all equally.\n\nJames McMurtry - The Horses and The Hounds\n\nBeatrice Deer - Shifting\n\nThe Flatlanders - Treasure of Love\n\nSamoa Wilson with the Jim Kweskin Band - I Just Want to be Horizontal\n\nJohn Wort Hannam - Long Haul\n\nShaela Miller - Big Hair, Small City\n\nDel Barber - Stray Dogs (Collected B-sides /Volume 1.)\n\nSierra Ferrell - Long Time Coming\n\nSide Pony - Lucky Break\n\nAaron Lee Tasjan - Tasjan! Tasjan! Tasjan!\n\nJERRY ZINN WEST OF TEXAS\n\nMike & the Moonpies – One to Grow On\n\nSummer Dean – Bad Romantic\n\nHannah Juantia – Hardliner\n\nMose Wilson – Mose Wilson\n\nJeremy Pinnell – Goodbye L.A.\n\nKevin Carducci – Home Sweet Nowhere\n\nJesse Daniel – Beyond These Walls\n\nDavid Miner – Silver Valley\n\nCharlie Marie – Ramble On\n\nSturgill Simpson – The Ballad of Dood & Juanita\n\nTAYLOR KOPP\n\n1 Waxahatchee Saint Cloud.\n\nThis is the rare record that feels both timeless and modern. Crutchfield’s influences aren’t tough to spot (I can hear Lucinda, Petty, Springsteen, and Dylan to name a few), but it always feels like you’re living in her world, not theirs. An instant classic and a no-brainer top choice for me.\n\nFavorite track: Arkadelphia.\n\n2 Bonny Light Horseman Bonny Light Horseman\n\nA folk supergroup that feels like it was formed just for me, BLH breathes new energy and immense talent into these old songs. What a lovely reminder that the folk music tradition is as alive and majestic as ever.\n\nFavorite track: Deep in Love.\n\n3 Christian Lee Hutson Beginners.\n\nThis might be the most beautiful sounding record you’ll hear this year. Hutson’s virtuosic guitar work and intimate storytelling combined with gorgeous, lush production from Phoebe Bridgers make this record a sonic treat. Favorite track: Lose This Number.\n\n4 Luka Kuplowsky Stardust.\n\nThis record was such a pleasant surprise in a year that called for just that. One of the most unique combinations of folk and jazz that I’ve heard in a while, Stardust is full of great writing and beautiful instrumentation, plus Kuplowsky’s voice is breathtaking.\n\nFavorite track: Do I Have to Be\n\n5 Phoebe Bridgers Punisher.\n\nBridgers brilliantly captures the darkness and absurdity of our modern world. She is a truly special songwriter that just keeps getting better.\n\nFavorite Track: I Know The End\n\nFive more albums I loved\n\nJB Paterson Young Man For A While\n\nKevin Morby Sundowner\n\nCourtney Marie Andrews Old Flowers\n\nWoods Strange to Explain\n\nLomelda Hannah\n\nMost Important Song Of The Year\n\nJohn Prine I Remember Everything\n\nGILLIAN TUITE\n\nPerhaps you saw that Thomm Jutz’s album To Live in Two Worlds, Vol 1 is up for Best Bluegrass Album at the Grammys? He released two volumes of the album this year, a mix of solo acoustic songs and some with a killer band. He’s very interesting in that he’s really into American history and writes a lot of songs in that vein.\n\nI also loved the album Bad For You from The Steeldrivers this year, the Gretchen Peters Mickey Newbury tribute album The Night You Wrote That Song , David Starr Beauty and Ruin ... it’s endless!\n\nCloser to home, Ultan Conlon There’s A Waltz produced by Sean Watkins is lovely, the new Beki Hemingway album Earth & Asphalt, Ben Reel Nashville Calling and Matt McGinn Lessons of War which is a beautiful concept album based on the experience of living in Northern Ireland (he also produced an accompanying documentary involving musicians from areas of conflict around the world). I’ve just discovered Yvonne Lyon from Scotland also so I’m currently listening to her new album Growing Wild.\n\nTHOMAS JONSSON (I’m Kingfisher)\n\n1 M. Ward Migration Stories\n\nWith some surprise, my housegod M. Ward returned to form after a weak decade. Playful heartfelt folk,giving me embracing comfort when I needed it the most. Pure magic and without doubt my album of the year.\n\n2 Bob Dylan Rough and Rowdy Ways\n\nWith little surprise, Dylan returned with an album of original songs and it was fantastic. Love his late phase a lot, holding Modern Times (2006) and Tempest (2012) along his absolute best. The new one is there too.\n\n3 Niamh Regan Hemet\n\nWith no suprise, Galway’s Niamh Regan is by far my favorite discovery of the year. Combining the rough folk of Karen Dalton, the flow of Damien Jurado and catchiness of Courtney Marie Andrews, and at the same time in a style and at a level of her own. From now on, one of three I count to Ireland’s finest, next to Lonesome Highways and Father Ted.\n\n4 Fiona Apple Fetch The Bolt Cutters\n\nAnother of this year’s most hyped albums that lived up to it’s reputation. Odd and great.\n\n5 Thåström Klockan Två På Natten, Öppet Fönster\n\nWith a style hard to describe. Joakim Thåström, Sweden’s biggest punk icon from the 70’s is bigger than ever. A boiling gospel warmth meeting pitch black darkness, Springsteen meets Nick Cave. A great live album recorded 2017-2018.\n\n6 Nightbird Travelin’ Baby\n\nFinnish Anna-Stina Jungerstam is a genius I’ve had the great honour to both tour and collaborate with. Her second album is a masterpiece, it’s just about to be released as I write this and I can’t wait to see where it will take her. The title track is so fantastic you want to punch someone in the face. A heart and a guitar, finnish forest blues meeting american dusty folk.\n\n7 Bohren & Der Club of Gore Patchouli Blue\n\nDrone-jazz. Dark, beautiful, mesmerizing and just a tiny bit uncomfortable.\n\n8 Waxahatchee Saint Cloud\n\nKatie Crutchfield might have deserved a higher spot on my list, I loved this album so much when it was released in March, but it somehow disappeared from my radar in the wave of the pandemic, also lost track of the outside world and sanity when having my own album mixed and mastered in March and April. I’ll make sure to give this an appropriate number of spins the following months.\n\n9 Jaime Wyatt Neon Cross\n\nOutlaw country for real, from ex-con Wyatt. Quirky, catchy and captivating.\n\n10 Hillary Woods Birthmarks\n\nRealizing when I’m writing this, Hillary Woods is also from Ireland! She released this awesome album in March. Eerie and folky.\n\nJANE WILLOW\n\nWill Johnson El Capitan\n\nThis is my favorite album of the year. I listen to it a lot. found his music on bandcamp as a recommended album. I was immediately taken by it. It’s so beautifully sparse and real. I don’t now what Will looks like, and I don’t know any of his other music as of yet. This album is so special to me and it means a lot to me. I hope to dive into more of his catalogue soon, but for now this album just gives me everything I need.\n\nNick Cave Ghosteen (end 2019)\n\nNick Cave lost his son in 2015. This album deals a lot with that subject. I’m especially moved by ‘Waiting For You’.\n\nCourtney Marie Andrews Old Flowers\n\nCourtney Marie Andrews is just an incredibly strong songwriter with a voice to match it.\n\nCiaran Lavery Plz Stay\n\nI just love the song ‘31’ on the album. It’s just a stunning stunning track by Antrim singer Ciaran Lavery.\n\nEmma Langford Sowing Acorns\n\nI love Emma and all that she does. She is such an incredible Irish talent. I especially love the track The Winding Way Down To Kells Bay. It sounds like an old Irish balad and just transports you to another world.\n\nAll in all it’s been a great year for new music, though I find myself, most often, returning to Nick Drake, Leonard Cohen, Gregory Alan Isakov and Richard Hawley. Their music means the most to me and truly comforts me. Since mid 2020 I have started recording my debut album with a great team of people, and despite it being on hold now during the lockdown I am genuinely excited to have created new music during this difficult time. I don’t know when I will release this album, I hope 2021 but it depends on corona and when gigs return. I’m also happy with these live cover videos I’ve been sharing on YouTube. It’s great to have music, to find comfort in it and to express myself with music. I feel very blessed to have that.\n\nDAVE VARGO\n\nKatie Pruitt Expectations\n\nJohn Moreland LP5\n\nAshley McBryde Never Will\n\nJason Isbell Reunions\n\nTHE REMEDY CLUB\n\nOur two favourite albums would have to be Beki Hemingway Earth & Asphalt - her new album and Lucinda Williams Good Souls Better Angels. They have been on repeat in our house for a while now.\n\nSTEVIE RAY LATHAM\n\nThis year has definitely been a challenge for all of us. As musicians the outbreak of Covid-19 has decimated our usual cycle of releasing and touring music, but in some ways, this unprecedented break from routine gave us some extra time and space to consider other people and their experiences. It’s probably no coincidence then, that the albums that most grabbed me this year were albums that were able to open a window into different lives and perspectives.\n\nBC Camplight Shortly After Takeoff deals with the difficult subject of Brian Christinzio’s mental health struggles but does so in a way that uses humour and bold arrangements to give the album a triumphant atmosphere. The dynamic shifts on Back to Work and Shortly After Takeoff help us to feels the highest-highs and the lowest-lows within short, radio friendly pop songs.\n\nThe laid back sound of Becca Mancari The Greatest Part belies the album’s heavy themes, the catchiest songs are often the darkest; songs like Hunter and First Time which detail the homophobia that she experienced when she came out.\n\nI had the chance to work with Malena Zavala on my EP Suburbia last year and what really stands out about her, beyond her incredible musicality, is her effortless marrying of cultures. Growing up in the UK within a close Argentinian family, her album La Yarara is a deeply personal and highly unique blend of Anglo-Latin Indie-Pop that brings together traditional elements with cutting-edge modern influences to create a world completely of her own.\n\nOn Spook the Herd, Lanterns On The Lake explore many of the contemporary anxieties that keep most of us up at night, from division and bereavement to the environmental crisis. As always, though, these musings sit nestled in folk-tinged dream-scapes that are as comforting as they are unsettling, a mirror maybe, to the complexities of the modern condition.\n\nThe last album on my list is The Neon Skyline by one of my favourite songwriters, Andy Shauf. Like his last album, The Party, this is a concept album that follows the mundane events of one night, but it does so with such attention to detail that it reveals things about the characters (and in turn, ourselves) which illuminate just how universal our most fundamental emotions and anxieties are. If I take away one thought from 2020, I hope that’s it.\n\nSYLVIE SIMMONS\n\nHere’s a batch of albums that made a big impression on me. The first 5 tied for first place, the next 4 for second place, and my album Blue On Blue, came third!\n\nBob Dylan Rough and Rowdy Ways - if anyone still needs proof that Dylan deserved the Nobel Prize for Literature, here it is. Murder Most Foul has to be the most important song of the year. A masterpiece, wise, witty and transcendent.\n\nNick Cave Idiot Prayer. A live album from a show in a vast venue with no-one there - that just about sums up the lockdown for a lot of us. Exquisite. Almost painfully beautiful at times. Now that Leonard has gone, one of his greatest disciples seems to be taking over his pew.\n\nAlison Moorer Blood. Jeez, this is powerful. Particularly the doomy Cold Cold Earth, which tells the true story of her father killing her mother and then himself. The album is the musical accompaniment to her memoir of the same name.\n\nBill Callahan Gold Record. I’ve loved him since Smog, but with this album and the one before, he just seems much more comfortable in his skin. Lovely record.\n\nLucinda Williams Good Souls Better Angels. One of her best albums yet.\n\nRay Wylie Hubbard Bad Trick. It’s all good, but I really love the title track and the lyrics, “You gotta have scars if you’re gonna be a poet”. Ray Wylie did me the honour of name-checking me in one of his songs, so you can accuse me of bias. Could be true, because I’ve also voted for my own album\n\nPhilip B Price Bone Almanac. Solo album by Winterpills’ frontman. If you love delicate, wintry, dreamlike folk songs, you’ll love songs like Jewel Wasp and Crow Mocks My Wings, well all of it really.\n\nZephaniah OHora Listening to the Music. This is just so gloriously listenable. Most of the songs evoke Waylon and Merle, which is fine by me. The musicians include my late, great friend Neal Casal on guitar.\n\nDamien Jurado What’s New Tomboy? He’s not made a bad album yet. Favourite tracks: When You Were Few; Fool Maria; Arthur Aware.\n\nSylvie Simmons Blue on Blue. My - I mean ‘her’! - last album Sylvie was named “one of the most beautiful albums of the year” by The Guardian. They seem to have forgotten to review my second album, but I’m sure they meant to say the same thing again. Actually, it’s been really well-received, which is always a huge relief; releasing an album is a bit like pinning a target over your chest. As I did with my debut, I made this album with Howe too. I also persuaded him to do his first official duet - our attempt at Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazelwood - on, the closing track 1000 Years Before I Met You. A lot of people think the opening song, Keep Dancing, sounds Leonard Cohen-esque; I don’t really hear it myself, but it’s definitely no insult. I think the songs I’m happiest with this time are Creation Day, Nothing and a song I wrote at the last minute, Sweet California.\n\nBRENNEN LEIGH\n\nWhitney Rose We Still Go To Rodeos. Whitney’s latest thing showcases her voice and songs beautifully. I’ve been a fan since I saw her live at the Continental Club in Austin years ago. She’s a top-notch singer and performer in a very classic sense. Her songs are melodic and hold my attention from start to finish.\n\nGillian Welch Boots #2 The Lost Songs. One note from Gillian takes me back to driving around Fargo in my hand-me-down ‘88 Honda when I was in high school, but there’s something fresh about this collection, even though it was recorded a long time ago. Top shelf as she always is.\n\nMalin Pettersen Wildhorse. Malin, who’s from Norway, made this album in Nashville, and her songs marry perfectly with the musicians she chose to play on it. Her music is smart, adventurous, and gorgeous.\n\nColter Wall Western Swing & Waltzes And Other Punchy Songs. Talkin’ Prairie Boy is my favourite track. The original tunes mix well with the old songs. His voice could fill a canyon. Colter is one of a kind.\n\nJosh Owen My New Place. A little biased here since I was involved as a co-writer and guest singer on this one, but Josh’s new EP is good country music about modern things … the pandemic and all the troubles that come with it. I love his singing and sense of humour.\n\nJames Steinle What I Came Here For. No one else is writing poetry and songs like this. Like every good work, this album has a sense of place … I can feel the air in Texas when I listen to it.\n\nZephaniah OHora Listening To The Music. Just a really good country record with relatable songs, good singing and good playing.\n\nSAMANTHA CRAIN\n\nThis year, I bought an AM/FM radio with antenna. I haven’t owned one of those since I was a kid and I really loved the simplicity of it. I could carry it outside with me, take it to the drive-in movies with me, or take it along to whatever room of the house I was in...so I didn’t listen to too much new music this year, mainly just whatever was on the oldies station or the classical station. But I did have time to dive into 5 specific records that I thought were really excellent, my favourite being the Bonny Light Horseman album, it’s hard to explain why, but it just fits my exact love of tempo and the instrumentation and production and recording are so good in my opinion. The Dua Lipa album, I really only found because I would hear the singles on the radio all the time and I just thought they were great disco pop songs, so fun. The Lomelda record has a rawness and personality that is undeniable, just a joy. I love everything Sam Amidon does and this new album is no exception. And then the Laura Marling album is perfect, my favourite record of hers, great for walking the dog in a field and crying and running and being a human.\n\nBonny Light Horseman Bonny Light Horseman\n\nDua Lipa Future Nostalgia\n\nLomelda Hannah\n\nSam Amidon Sam Amidon\n\nLaura Marling Song For Our Daughter\n\nMISS TESS\n\n1 Lucinda Williams Good Souls Better Angels\n\nI was really impressed with Lucinda’s newest release. It’s so raw it almost feels punk rock, with the attitude to match. Man Without a Soul really stands out to me in light of current political situations in the US of A, and the world in general being controlled by capitalist greed, and men. This song makes me really happy in a strong, yet hopeful way. I will join Lucinda for the fight of good, and not be afraid to call out the bad guys.\n\n2 Courtney Marie Andrews Old Flowers\n\nCourtney is one of the best writers performing music right now. Her lyrics are clear, yet unexpected and beautifully familiar. Usually I can only get into a breakup album if I am also going through one myself, but this album has such emotional appeal it’s hard not to get sucked in. And her voice just makes me melt!\n\n3 Charley Crockett Welcome to the Hard Times\n\nI’ve been a fan of Charley’s ever since I passed the tip jar at his 2am set here in Nashville at The American Legion. I had been drinking and carrying on with friends as you do, but then found myself completely entranced by his voice – It has a certain cosiness, maybe akin to someone like Bobby Charles, round edges. Then I thought “wait, does he have a lisp?”, which made it even more endearing. Charlie does a great job making an old style fresh again, even with songs that have been played or recorded a million times already. This album does a great job of painting a western that you want to be in.\n\n4 Willie Nelson First Rose of Spring\n\nI heard the title track of this album on the radio in my car and it made me cry. I’m sure the extra stress of pandemic times added to the strength of my emotional release, but what a beautiful song. And “Don’t Let the Old Man In”? Come on with the tenderness Willie! For someone who puts out 2–4 albums per year, it’s hard to keep track, but I’m glad I caught this one. Willie is hands down the most prolific songwriters of our time, and even at 87 years old he continues to impress.\n\n5 Molly Tuttle But I’d Rather Be With You\n\nMolly is such a fearless badass. She’s someone here in our Nashville community I’ve been watching grow into her own skin, and I really admire her determination. Her musicality and recordings continue to astound me, and this new album of covers is no exception. It just sounds really good.\n\n6 The Wood Brothers Kingdom In My Mind\n\nI’m pretty The Wood Brothers was the last show I saw before the shutdown. They were doing a promotional in-store appearance at Grimey’s, a great local record store here in Nashville. The room was packed with a standing audience, and they were sitting down. So, if you were in the back like I was, you couldn’t see them at all. But you could listen. These guys are really good at music, and it’s not often you get to see a real band play – folks that have been vibing off each other for years and years. This comes through in their recordings as well, and this album sounds really good.\n\nJERRY LEGER\n\nLucinda Williams Good Souls Better Angels\n\nRon Sexsmith Hermitage\n\nBob Dylan Rough & Rowdy Ways\n\nAndrew James Barker Andrew James Barker\n\nLindy Vopnfjörd State Of The Heart\n\nEMILY ZUZIK\n\n1 Yola Goodbye Yellow Brick Road I didn’t want to lean on a cover song, but I have had such an intense emotional response to this cover that I could not NOT include it in the list. I’ve always been partial to this particular Elton John track, so when I first heard Susan Dilger play this on her Americana radio show out of Taos, I had to email her to find out who the artist was. I had a “stop in your tracks” moment. The only other time I can remember this ever happening to me was the first time I heard Norah Jones Don’t Know Why. The second time I heard this song I was driving and I began weeping in the car. There’s just something about this performance that is really special!\n\n2 Pokey LaFarge Rock Bottom Rhapsody I think Pokey has such a unique sound and voice. Everytime I hear him, I know it’s him. The singer’s blessing when you can sonically cut through like that. Always catchy and swinging.\n\n3 Lake Street Dive Making Due Not necessarily Americana, but soulful and caught me off guard. I like it when that happens to me (see #1)\n\n4 Ted Russell Kamp Down in the Den Ted is such a talent, and he’s talented in a number of genres. This is another characteristic of artists that I’ve always admired. It has soul, swagger and twang all wrapped up in one neat package.\n\n5 Fiona Apple Fetch the Bolt Cutters I’ve been a fan of Fiona since Tidal. She’s fearless and messed up and creative and willing to always put it on the line, which makes her an anomaly in this music biz. She’s not afraid to fail or get her hands dirty and doesn’t bother with trying to please anyone to speak her truth. It’s a harder life, for sure, but a noble one and I love her for it.\n\nHonourable Mention: Emily Zuzik Torch & Trouble I’d be crazy if I didn’t say I’ve been living in this album for the entire year--pushing the release, making 4 videos, playing live streams to promote, doing interviews and basically learning and re-learning every nuance of this 3-year project. I really love it and am very proud of it. I’ve listened to the songs so much, way more than anything on the list above, but that’s kind of the reality of putting out music.\n\nEMILY BARKER\n\nHere you go ... (Not in any particular order mind)\n\n1 Phoebe Bridgers Punisher\n\nOnce again, a magical album by this incredible songwriter. The production is so divine too. I read somewhere she was quite influenced by ASMR and that makes total sense - it’s so intimate.\n\n2 Mary Chapin Carpenter The Dirt & The Stars\n\nHaving had the pleasure of touring in the USA and UK with MCC as the opening act and backing vocalist, I’ve come to know most of her catalogue, which is extensive! I feel like she just wrote her strongest album ever, and that’s really saying something given the strength of all her records over the years. There’s so much depth to her lyrics. MCC wields the power of making us all feel connected and understood. It’s beautiful.\n\n3 Laura Marling Song For Our Daughter\n\nLaura is an exceptional guitar player, vocalist and songwriter - as we all know! And this album is a stunner. Gorgeous string arrangements, quirky harmonies, fabulous playing, great songs. Love it.\n\n4 Neil Young Homegrown\n\nI am a huge Neil Young fan and I can’t believe they sat on this one for such a long time! Awesome tunes and loose vibes going on here.\n\n5 Lucinda Williams Good Souls, Better Angels\n\nQueen of grunge country - if that’s a thing? - Lucinda is on her usual incredible form. She continues to inspire me with her direct, opinionated, heart-felt lyrics and raw vocal delivery.\n\nPRINZ GRIZZLEY (Chris Comper)\n\n10 John Moreland LP 5\n\nI wasn´t a big fan of John Moreland but when I heard “A thought is just a passing train” for the first time, I was sold! Great songs and a killer production by Matt Pence! What a vibe throughout the Album funky, melancholy and heartfelt.\n\n9 Logan Ledger Logan Ledger\n\nT Bone Burnett really knows how to let shine the sparkling old timey voice of Mr. Ledger! A listen through or leave it album.\n\n8 Nathaniel Rateliff And It’s Still Alright\n\nAt first, I was disappointed, no up-tempo soul rockers no bite but oh boy how this album grows on you! Beautiful, sad and deep! If I ever get to meet Mr. Rateliff, he will get a big hug from me.\n\n7 Courtney Marie Andrews Old Flowers\n\nAnd this woman deserves an even bigger hug! If she only had to face half of the feelings, she so intensely portraits on this album then this is the best example for “the greatest art comes through pain”!\n\nSparse, intense and heartbreaking perfectly embedded in an awesome production by Andrew Sarlo.\n\n6. S.G. Goodman Old time feeling\n\nS.G. Goodman shows how it’s to be done! Write great songs, hit the studio with your band and then let your heart flow into your voice! For me this album is like the little sister of Justin Townes Earl´s “The saint of lost causes”!\n\n5 Colter Wall Western Swing & Waltzes and Other Punchy Songs\n\nFinally, Colter is backed up by his band on nearly all the songs on the album, I was waiting for that a long time!\n\nBut what really stands out to me are the great covers he does of Big Iron and Cowpoke! Beloved Americans currently there is only one real cowboy with a guitar and yes, he´s Canadian!\n\n4 Sturgill Simpson Cuttin Grass Vol.1\n\nSturgill may be gentler and humbler than the Gallagher Brothers but he´s the same punk as the brothers were on their peak! Don´t give him rules, don´t boss him, get out of his way or he eats you alive.\n\nI wasn´t waiting for a bluegrass album by Sturgill but I enjoyed it big time and now I want more of it please!!\n\n3 Daniel Romano Various albums 2020\n\nWhen asked me to put together my top ten of 2020 albums, I could have easily written down only one name “Daniel Romano”\n\nI don´t know what this man drinks or smokes but I want it too! Ryan Adams once said if you call yourself a songwriter and you can´t write 15 solid songs in a year better put that guitar aside. Daniel must be more like, if you don´t write 15 songs a week do something else! Don´t ask me which one of the ten albums he released this year is my favorite, I haven´t decided yet!\n\n2 Chris Stapleton Starting Over\n\nHe’s A force of nature but whom I have to tell this!!\n\n1 Ray LaMontagne Monovision\n\nOver ten years ago a friend of mine mentioned Ray LaMontagne, I checked him out and was like why should I listen to a not so good Ryan Adams, in hindsight a big fault!!\n\nAnd then this year this Album came out and I was lighting struck! I am totally blown away by this album, I love the production, the songs, the flow, the vocal performance, everything!! I could sit down a try to analyze what makes it so special for me but I won´t do that! Some things just touch you and I am so glad this album did!!\n\nLUAN PARLE\n\nHere we go, in no particular order ...\n\nJeff Tweedy Love Is King\n\nOne of the good things to come out of lockdown has been the streaming of live shows from the homes of some of our much-loved musicians and a favourite of mine has been @thetweedyshow on Instagram and YouTube. From their Chicago home, Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy, his wife Suzie and sons Spencer and Sammy began broadcasting The Tweedy Show. This latest album from Jeff Love Is King features sons Spencer & Sammy.\n\nJohn Blek The Embers\n\nThis album is simply sublime and should be in everyone’s record collection. My favourite track on the album is Empty Pockets but every song is exceptional.\n\nGrant-Lee Phillips Lightening, Show Us Your Stuff\n\nI was first introduced to Grant- Lee Phillips while growing up watching one of my favourite TV shows...The Gilmore Girls. Fans of the show will recognise Grant-Lee Phillips as the town troubadour. I’ve loved him ever since. This album is a stunner.\n\nGillian Welch and David Rawlings All The Good Times Are Past and Gone\n\nThis is an album of covers from Gillian Welch and David Rawlings. It features two Bob Dylan tracks, John Prine’s Hello In There, a song by guitarist Elizabeth Cotten, and a version of Jackson.\n\nBruce Springsteen Letter To You\n\nI was super excited for this album release and it did not disappoint, another classic from the boss. My personal favourite is the title track Letter To You. This is my driving album.\n\nMolly Tuttle But I’d Rather Be With You\n\nI first heard of Molly in 2018 when she played the Roots Festival Kilkenny. An incredible guitarist with a stunning voice and fabulous collection of songs.\n\nThe Lost Brothers After The Fire, After The Rain\n\nThe sixth album release from Oisin and Mark is just gorgeous. There have been so many great Irish album releases this year and this is without doubt up there with the best. Those harmonies ...\n\nJim White Misfit Jubilee\n\nI was lucky enough to see Jim play live at Cleere’s Theatre Kilkenny when he was touring with Clive Barnes. I play this latest album from Jim non-stop.\n\nLucinda Williams Good Souls Better Angels\n\nLucinda Williams reunited with Ray Kennedy for this album which he co-produced with her husband and co-writer Tom Overby. I loved this album from the first track Bad News Blues. Her voice sounds incredible. Check out Big Black Train a song about a looming, unstoppable depression.\n\nSama"
