All MULE recordings and Preston's solo recordings are fantastic and well worth investigating)\n\n​\n\nThe Au-Go-Go monthly 'Useletter'\n\nIn a Pre-Internet world there was a heavy reliance on print catalogues which would be whipped up and sent out (usually with an ORDER FORM attached) which were often the lifeblood of the music starved fan who cannot easily access the physical store. During my decades of working on both Mailorder Catalogues and Shop Newsletters it constantly blew me away how customers would write back very personal hand written letters letting you know that these things KEPT THEM SANE and made them feel very much like family within an almost secret network ! Certain music was not easy to access and you could also score a copy of some crazy LIMITED EDITION of a new Aussie or Overseas release and snaffle a killer T-SHIRT / Badge or Sticker while you were at it ( altho' these often came free with your order). If you lived on the outskirts of DULLSVILLE amongst not many or no-one else who GOT the sounds you were into and the lifestyle you were leading then these little mailbox treats became very much a LIFELINE in many cases and this resulted in many many examples of deep friendship which grew and grew from years to decades, with many of you reading this now in 2019 STILL ordering music 30 plus years along the line so this shows you the power of the connection with Underground Music at it's core.\n\nDating back to the late 70's when Bruce Milne was working with Keith Glass at Missing Link he was banging out A4 Catalogues with all the latest 7\" singles coming in from around Australia ( all $2 each) along with all the rad stuff coming in from the USA and the UK so an absolute HOTBED of activity with these records SHAPING PEOPLE'S LIVES ! You only have to see and read the reaction of the passing of Pete Shelley from the BUZZCOCKS to see how deep the sounds sunk into folks DNA and this really sums up the universal language of music.... it stays in your bones FOR LIFE and is part of the human being that you become. As the years ticked on and Bruce started up AU-GO-GO, the catalogues were a CORE part of the biz and they would often span pages and pages and go on to include Second Hand and Rarities as well ( not as indepth as say the newsprint PHANTOM catalogues which were coming out of Sydney but still easy being able to hold their own and helping to introduce hundreds of people to new and old music which they'd come to love and cherish )\n\nTwo legendary MAILORDER Flagbearers at Au-Go-Go were MATTY WHITTLE ( from GOD and currently in the band BABY 8 etc..) and RICHIE RAMONE ( Currently at the helm of one of Melbourne's best Independent Record Stores STRANGEWORLD in Fitzroy ). Both had interesting hand writing which could be easily identified and their pen and typewriter work would be seen through the mid to late 80's on Catalogues being pumped out from Au-Go-Go HQ with packages off to the Post Office daily to appease another rocking customer who had ordered a mountain of GREAT STUFF ! As I came on board in the late 80's and became a solid part of the Mailorder action one got to see how loyal and dedicated the customers were, from those coming into the shop to buy music day in day out, to those who weekly /monthly ordered their fix of music and extra goodies which would help them through another week of work and bring joy to their ears / eyes / and mind ! I started the 'Useletter' incarnation in APRIL of 1992 and it ran for a good DECADE until I jumped ship to MISSING LINK RECORDS and picked it up again there with the first issue ( November 2002 ) coming out a month after I started with this one also running into multiple years and getting fancy with DOUBLE ISSUES / Band Interviews and the like. Great fun and awesome for a shop to have something FREE every other month to represent the store and give the lowdown on things like : BIG UPCOMING RELEASES / IN-STORE SHOWS & SIGNINGS / Band Tours / Shop Label Releases and more, along with having fun with stuff like the TOP TEN LISTS and those kinda things which were always good fun to include and actually had quite an effect ( across both stores, as shop employees music tastes were trusted and people would very often take a punt on something we loved the BeJesus out of, which is neat and quite rewarding in many years as you can both discuss the merits of a record, why it's grabbed you by the scruff and how you never want it to let go ! The pure bare bones JOYS OF MUSIC....\n\nComing from a FANZINE world Pre my own Record Store tenure I was heavily set on the world of CUT AND PASTE and even with the advent of computers and Laser Printers and Graphics Programs, I would still print stuff out then cut the hell out of it with Scissors, add a photo copy logo and Glue it in with a trusty UHU stick.... it's just how it was. With the DOUBLE SIDED A3 Format of the AU-GO-GO and the MISSING LINK Newsletters it was insanely OLD SCHOOL as I would fold in half then half again and get to drawing up squares with a black graphic pen and ruler to make A5 panels then start to piece together what was going to go into each box and across which full panels. The crazy way I would do it was by typing a line of mumbo jumbo text at 10pt then type 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 down to 15 underneath in a line then repeat again at 9pt and 8pt. i'd print it out and this would become my MASTER SHEET and I'd then align said sheet onto my 'Boxes' ( on my A3 master ) to see through and pencil in where the box ended ( on my mumbo jumbo text line) and how many lines down I could go so I knew that back on the computer I could type under that line to a particular letter then go say FOUR DOWN and print out, cut up and paste in, knowing that my text would fit in that box ! A logo or LP/CD cover would already be added and the text would finish it off. This was a madly and crazed TIME CONSUMING PROCESS which would horrify many people who saw me do it this way and when it was all done it had some weight in it with all the paste ins and additions and it was always handled like a true MASTER SHEET as I knew that for it to be printed with clarity and to disguise all the cuts etc... it had to be handed over in top condition. the Bourke Street printers ( who printedthe majority of the BUTTERCUP stuff and will do the bulk of the FANTASTIC MESS Releases ) would love it when I came in and stare in awe at all the finicky fine work and ancient way of presenting a master for printing and they'd always have a bit of a chuckle whilst shaking their heads in a kind of mad appreciation that someone would still go to all this trouble in a Photoshop ridden world....\n\n​* I have a mountain of stuff to add to these pages so check back from time to time for updates and fresh blast from the past info...\n\nBelow : The complete run of 12 for the year of 1996\n\n​\n\nand below : Inside detail of an A3 Newsletter with the left having a 'Rarities' feature and the right, a MICK COLLINS (Detroit) interview\n\n​\n\nBelow : The primitive 1st and 2nd Issues of the Au-Go-Go Newsletter.... dodgy with paltry info before it found it's feet and proper format......\n\nAbove : the complete run of monthly shop Newsletters from the year of 1998\n\nThis was a White Stripes painted board I did for\n\ntheir first tour when they played tiny venues and\n\nbefore they broke real big. There was an Instore\n\nSigning with Jack and Meg at the 'Last' Au-Go-Go\n\nstore location at 2 Somerset Place in Melbourne. Bog Log III Instore at 349 Little Bourke Street\n\nwith Fionna & Pat (now Rocksteady Records)\n\nbehind the counter.

Clearing out of 349 Little Bourke Street...\n\nSetting up the 2 Somerset Place location, which for years was the jewellery offices for Ekselman's which had been there (& below) for 50 odd years, so the\n\nclean up of dust, Cleaning /Polishing of concrete, rewiring and re-painting was all systems go with 90% done by all the staff at the time with a full 24 hour\n\nshift of finishing touches, Rack Stacking, Poster /Light hanging etc... done the day before the date of opening. It was a great space with views down onto\n\nElizabeth Street and the stereo system sounded great ! Upstairs was a long held Office area where all the Promotion /Label and extra Stock was housed &\n\nstored and that space too also held a lot of history with lots of great old wood racks ( sometimes you'd find items from the 60's if up a ladder and poking around on a high shelf ) and a real classic untouched building. It was of course decked out with Original Cult /Exploitation film Posters/ Framed Music Posters and all sorts of gnarly stuff, with visiting band members always enjoying hanging out and walking out with arms full of free records and the like. It also\n\nhoused the fax machine, which in it's day was THE hot tech item and the lifeline of many gig deadline dates, tour documents and supplier invoices to see\n\n​whether you managed to get 12 of that amazing new album outta San Francisco on your fave label or if you got 4 and 8 were listed as 'On Back Order'.....\n\nABOVE : Outside the 2 Somerset Place Building and Office for 349 Little Bourke St shop (3 windows top centre) BLACKEYED SUSANS - Album Window Display ( Above Right ) and an alternate version of the Logo which was in use through mainly the 80's.
