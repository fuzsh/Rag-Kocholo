Here, New York City's hardcore movement is represented in all of its outspoken, opinionated, and often contradictory variety. Participants are shown with friends, spouses, even children, performing, dancing, and hanging out. They also explain in their own words and lyrics to songs what they think hardcore is all about.\n\nFrom moments of quiet intimacy to the controlled mayhem of live shows, Making a Scene documents in a unique way this flourishing and often misunderstood underground style.\n\nBri Hurley's photographs have appeared in the Village Voice, Jersey Beat, Teen Punk, and Maximum Rock 'n' Roll. She has also shot album covers and promotional photos for many of New York's hardcore bands.\n\nWebsite for the book is up and running.

Below is an email sent by one of the store's owners, Malcolm Tent.\n\nFirst the good news: Danbury has gained a bigger print shop.\n\nNow the bad news: Danbury is losing a cultural mecca. Thrown to the curb like........well, like....TRASH!!\n\nEffective May 1st, 2007, Trash American Style will no longer be able to conduct retail\n\noperations at 12 Mill Plain Road. Its official. Not a rumor. Tell everybody.\n\nWe must stress that this is NOT because of bad business or hard times. If we had our druthers, wed stay here at 12 Mill Plain Road forever. We love this location. It has been very good to us for 17+ years. Due to circumstances way beyond our control, and with little time to effectively plan any strategy, we are forced into action.\n\nKathy and I are going to stay in business, just in a different fashion for the time being. Youll be seeing us at record shows, flea markets, colleges, festivals, gigs, vacant lots, and assorted roadsides all over the Northeast. Those of you across the globe will see plenty of Trash action on Ebay and elsewhere on the internet. There will probably be a storefront again, we just dont know when.\n\nRight now, were starting to discount a lot of the merchandise. Youve seen how much stuff we have and we need to get rid of a lot of it. Shop at Trash and get it while you can.\n\nPlease send us your contact information if we dont already have it. An email or snail mail address will be very helpful to us because we want to keep everybody informed as our situation develops. You can always check trashamericanstyle.com for updates!\n\nKathy and I want you to know that we love each and every one of you. Youve given us the best 20 years that we could possibly ask for and were grateful to all of you for letting us serve you this whole time. We are not defeated and we will not be stopped. Our journey continues, just down a different path than the one we would have chosen. We hope to see you as much as possible along the path.

Following the string of live shows it seemed natural\n\nto get into the studio with Cheetah and lay down some new tracks. By 1992 Lost\n\nGeneration had run its course so Joe Dias (singer) started to put together a band\n\nto play the music he really wanted to play since he was growing tired of the\n\nhardcore and crossover genres. Joe ended up forming Dead City with guitarist Pugs\n\n(Hatebreed, Iron Cross, Loved And Hated) with whom he shared a common musical\n\ndirection. Joe decided to go back to his roots and play a more straight forward 70s\n\npunk rock sound like the Damned and The Dead Boys. Several sessions were recorded.\n\nThe tracks that feature Cheetah Chrome used Joes old band Lost Generation as a\n\nbacking while other sessions included Todd Knapp (76% Uncertain) and John Munera\n\n(Seizure).\n\nDead City are planning on doing a small Northeast tour this winter to support the\n\nrelease of this CD and Yes, Cheetah Chrome will be playing with them!\n\nDead City \"The Dead Sessions\" Featuring: Cheetah Chrome!\n\nIncas Records #102\n\nTracks:\n\n01 One Breath\n\n02 White Light\n\n03 Memories\n\n04 INRI\n\n05 Lonesome\n\n06 Too Fast\n\n07 Slipping Away\n\n08 Crazy As Ever\n\n09 I Gotta Kick\n\n10 Some Kinda Animal\n\n11 Timebomb\n\n12 In My Head\n\n13 Too Much Hate\n\n14 Nothing\n\n15 Ashes And Bones\n\n16 I Walked With A Zombie\n\nLink: http://www.smorgasbordrecords.com/distribution.php\n\nDate: November 8th, 2006 R.I.P.

I was 17 yrs old when I wrote the first Dead 50's song. Here I am 10 yrs. and 3 albums later having to try and explain why i'm walking away from it all. I won't spend the whole email talking about old times because I haven't the tissues, and although other people's lives have influenced my decision to leave, It's ultimately up to me, and i will try and only touch on that.\n\nIt's no secret that people change over time, and over the past few years, I believe I have. I had to take a hard honest look at the situation and ask myself, \"Am I still playing in this band because I want to be here, or am I still here because everyone else wants me to be here?\" Truth be told, my heart is just not into it anymore. This past year has totally sucked all the fun out of the band for me. I will say this. For that hour a night I spend on stage with my bandmates, i'm having a blast, even today. It's the other 23 hours of the day that have turned into a nightmare for me. The other question I had to ask myself was, \"at this point in my life, is hardly ever seeing my wife, not being able to really help with the bills, leaving her with all the responsibility around the house, and not being there to support the ones I love, worth still going after a dream that at best is years from ever making us a living? My heart is telling me no, and i'm choosing to follow it.\n\nI hope all of you understand where i'm coming from, and don't track me down in some dark alley for a good beating. Ya know when it comes down to it, D5 has given it a really good run. I'm proud of the accomplishments we have made throughout the years as a band. Matt Towsen, Shawn Miller, Andy Corman, Eric Bess, Ross Moody, and me, I'm proud, and have absolutely no regrets. Having 3 full length original albums is more than a lot of bands can say they have under their belts. We've all worked hard, and just so everyone is on the same page, there is no ill feeling between myself, Eric, or Rj. All 3 of us agree that although it's upsetting that D5 has come to an end, we each are excited for whatever might come our way in the future. The d5 website will stay up so people can follow what anyone of us might get involved with.\n\nLast but not least, thanks to the greatest fans on earth that have shown us love and support throughout the years. We've made a lot of fans, friends , ya know what i mean, that we don't want to lose contact with. Everyone has been so kind to us, and for that we are truly greatful. I promise that one, if not all of us will someday give you a reason to get out of the house for some good music once again. WIth every ending, there's a new beginning.\n\nThanks for the memories.\n\nMOODY\n\nLink: http://www.dead50s.com\n\nDate: May 26th, 2005 Up Front are playing in CT at the end of July!\n\nPayback reunion!\n\nThis show has been in the works for the last 4 months and I finally have all of the details. The guys in Payback called me back in January and asked if Up Front would play a Payback reunion in CT and we said yes.

After 18 years of only focusing on Smorgasbord Records projects, we have decided to take on a brand new task, that being the distribution for the new Incas Records.\n\nIncas records began in 1982 as a means for the Connecticut hardcore/punk band Lost Generation to release their first 7\" entitled \"Never Work\". It was an idea conceived by Lost Generation's lead singer Joe Dias. After releasing that record other Connecticut bands began to approach him asking how they could get their bands records pressed. They soon decided that it made sense to use just one label name instead of every band having their own label. From 1982 until the end of the decade Incas released approximately 45 records, tapes and CD's by bands from all over Connecticut and the surrounding states. The majority of the bands were part of the local New Haven music scene and Incas played a big part in unifying these bands and helping them get exposure outside of Connecticut and throughout the world. No hardcore/punk record collection is complete without the Incas releases by C.I.A., Miracle Legion, 76% Uncertain, Vatican Commandos (who included a young guitarist from Bridgeport, CT named Moby who went on to solo fame and fortune), the Connecticut Fun LP Compilation and so many others...\n\nBy the end of the 1980's Joe Dias was becoming less involved in playing music and eventually Incas Records just sorta faded out. Now in 2004 Joe and Sue Snow are resurrecting The Incas name. Joe Snow tells how it all came together ...\"Growing up in Connecticut and attending local punk and hardcore shows since the mid 1980's I developed a love for local bands. Connecticut has always produced an overwhelming amount of great bands of all genre's which may be surprising to many since it is such a small state. Collecting local records has been my passion for many years. As I dug for these obscure vinyl discs, I also began to find tapes of many unreleased sessions that bands had recorded but never distributed. I got the idea to compile the best of these unheard tunes so that the rest of the world could share in my discoveries but the stumbling block was what label to release it on. I had recently met Joe Dias and was familiar with Incas records and owned many of their releases. The idea just came to me, \"Why not release it on Incas since Incas has always been about supporting the local music scene?\". It was the perfect vehicle for what I was doing. I asked Joe Dias what his thoughts on this might be and before you knew it I was reviving the Incas label. Joe Dias has also given me full permission to the vast Incas back catalog some of which I will be reissuing beginning with the legendary \"Connecticut Fun\" compilation of mid 1980's hardcore bands including Vatican Commandos, Youth Of Today, Seizure, No Milk On Tuesday and 76% Uncertain. There is a lot of history behind Incas Records and I'm hoping to continue that legacy and keep the Incas tradition alive with new releases and reissuing the old classics\".\n\nFirst up from Incas Records will be a cd compilation called \"Up All Night: Unearthing The Relics Of CT's Lost Underground\", Incas Records 100. The CD is the first release in a series featuring Connecticut bands of the early punk era and is the result of endless hours writing emails, talking with people and exploring Connecticut's mostly forgotten early days. Most of the material on this compilation has never seen the light of day or if it was released, it never made it outside the local Connecticut music scene. Many of these bands existed for only a brief period in time and they didn't have the money to put out a record.

It's been over two years since our last new release, but that is about to change.\n\nHere's what's new and exciting. No official release dates have been set, but both releases will be out late March / early April 2004.\n\nFirst up is Smor 028: Windfall / Psychopunch limited edition split 7 inch. Four songs in all, two from USA's Windfall and two from Sweden's Psychopunch. The songs are exclusive to this vinyl only split 7 inch release. The cover art was created specially by Mike Fisher at Wrecking Crew Studios. See what it's like when two countries collide and bring you raw, powerful, hardcore/punk rock 'n roll! We are accepting pre-orders and suggest that you pre-order to guarantee a colored vinyl copy. There will be 1,000 total records pressed, and there will be only one pressing. The price will be the same as any other Smorgasbord 7 inch release, $4.00 postage paid if you live in the USA and $7.00 air mail postage paid to anywhere else in the world. Pre-order now and receive a free Windfall \"Awaken\" cd/ep. Pre-orders must be received by March 31st and must be through the snail mail. This offer is available for direct mailorders only.\n\nNext up is a cd release from Up Front compiling all of the band's 7 inch releases onto one cd. Smor 027: Twenty five songs in all including three tracks from the 1999 split 7 inch release with Building, six tracks from the 1994 7 inch release \"What Fire Does\", four tracks from the 1992 7 inch release \"Changes\", seven tracks from the 1990 7 inch release \"Daybreak\", and five tracks from the 1996 7 inch release \"Doin' It Live On WNYU\". Except for the \"What Fire Does\" 7 inch, these recordings have been sold out and out of print for many years. The cover art was created specially by Jason Powell / Killerkatt Artworks and is very reminiscent of the band's 1988 LP release \"Spirit\". Fans worldwide have been asking, and we finally got this release together. All from the original masters, no remixes here, just what you heard on 7\", only now remastered for cd format. Pre-order now and receive a free Up Front \"Movement' cd. Pre-orders must be received by March 31st and must be through the snail mail. This offer is available for direct mailorders only.\n\nWe are also planning a follow up Up Front cd in about a year or so compiling all of the band's demos onto one cd. What demos might those be you ask? Before the three tracks that appeared on the 1987 \"X Marks The Spot\" 7 inch, a friend of the band Mitch Mitchell recorded the band's 1986 six song demo tape. These were the only recordings with the band's original drummer Dan. Six songs were released, but thirteen songs were recorded in all. In addition to the 1986 demo, the band recorded a four song demo in 1991 prior to the recording of the Striving For Togetherness Records \"Changes\" 7 inch and a four song demo in 1996 prior to the recording of the \"Movement\" LP. I don't know how, but over the years none of these recordings have leaked out and besides for the original six song demo from 1986 that you occasionally see on ebay and/or trade lists, the other songs have never been heard by anyone other than Up Front and close friends of the band!\n\nSo as you can see, the wheels are still turning here at Smorgasbord Records and we are extremely excited to add these fine releases to our catalog.\n\nThe Up Front \"Spirit\" cd and the Wide Awake \"25 Song Discography\" cd have both been sold out for the past year or so. If you tried to order one and could not get one, we apologize. Good news though, the reorders have been placed and both cds should be back in stock the same time that the two new aforementioned releases are available! If you pre-order one before March 31st we will be sure to throw in some buttons, stickers, and whatever else happens to be lying around.\n\nLastly, we are so excited about the new releases and the re-presses that we are having a HALF OFF sale on select titles. Check out the Releases page for more details...\n\nAs always, thanks to everyone for the years of support and for keeping the true spirit of hardcore/punk music alive!!!!\n\nJeff Terranova\n\nDate: February 4th, 2004 Smorgasbord News\n\nIt's been a while...\n\n2003 was a rough year for Smorgasbord Records and there wasn't a lot to write about.

We would like to thank all the sponsors, bands, and volunteers who worked so hard with us during the past couple of months while we were planning this event.\n\nPlease keep checking back to our website, http://www.WICedFest.com for information regarding the future of this year's event.\n\nShould you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact either:\n\nDan DeLaiarro\n\n(516) 318-4584\n\ndan@earthwake.com\n\nRob Anderson\n\n(203) 775-9393\n\nAXISBOARDS@aol.com\n\n2003 WICed Fest\n\nWICed Fest\n\nWakeboarding In Connecticut Since 1998\n\nLink: http://www.WICedFest.com\n\nDate: June 19th, 2003 2003 WICed Fest\n\nBrookfield, CT\n\nI don't know if anyone knows this, but for the past four years I have coordinated all of the live music for WICed Fest. The event is set up by Rob from Axis Board Sports (ex Wide Awake bass player) and friend Dan DeLaiarro. My contribution to actually booking the bands this year was very minimal due to the fact that I was busy with planning my May 17th wedding. None the less, it is going to be another great weekend for wakeboarding , extreme sports, and live music. I will be there all day Saturday the 21st helping out and hanging out. Hope to see you there!\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE WICed FEST 2003 IS READY TO ROCK & ROLL!\n\nBrookfield, CT\n\nThe weekend of June 20th & June 22nd will surely be a huge kickoff to the summer and a great official start to the wakeboarding season in the Northeast. For those of you who donít know, The Marina at Cottonwood Cove is playing host to the sixth annual WICed Fest, which is once again calling Candlewood Lake home.\n\nThe sponsor lineup for this event is growing everyday with more and more people being added all the time. Of course, the event comes to you courtesy of AIXS Boardsports. The main board sponsors, Hyperlite and Liquid Force, will be providing board and binding demos all weekend. Malibu Boats and Centurion Boats will be there displaying their new lineups. You may even get a chance to ride behind one of these fine beasts! Inland Watersports will be present supporting the cause as well as Red Bull. In Good Health LLC and Brookfield Community Chiropractor will both have information booths set up. More sponsorships are in the works and weíre just itching to let you know about them but the best chance you have at learning about all the sponsors is to come on down and experience the mayhem that is the WICed Fest first hand!\n\nThe general schedule of the WICed Fest will remain relatively similar to the past few years. If it ain't broke, don't fix it, right? Friday will be a Meet & Greet kind of day with last minute touches taking place and everyone arriving. The culmination of that day will be the Liquid Force sponsored party at Down the Hatch, a local bar located on Candlewood Lake. Down the Hatch is located both by land and water, but, due to a parking crunch, is far more accessible by water.\n\nSaturday morning will provide you will stellar riding conditions. Head out early and rip it up like a madman! During the day Saturday there will be a $12 BBQ put on by the folks at The Marina. Bands will be playing all day featuring the reggae of Guerillafinga, the rock of Dead 50's, and the punk stylings of Victor's Army. Product demos and information booths will also be up all day. Feel free to ride as much as you want, thatís what this event is all about! Later that night Malibu will be sponsoring the Malibu Luau. This party has been a staple of the last two WICed Fests and has always been remembered as one of the highlights of the weekend.\n\nDemos and chilling will be the theme of the day on Sunday. Sunday is traditionally a more laid back day where everyone sits back with their friends new and old and reminisces over the funny, wacky, and unbelievable events of the weekend. This day is also a good day to try out that last board or binding and to make sure that all those new riding buddies youíve made know how to get in touch with you. Buy yourself a WICed Fest T-shirt and start getting ready for next year!\n\nAs we tell you every year, you'll do yourself a big favor by bringing your own boat! While there will be plenty of people there for pulls, getting a ride behind your boat and not having to wait as long is always a plus. If you need information about getting an inexpensive slip for the weekend, give Talbot a call at the The Marina and ask about a slip for the WICed Fest. His phone number is (203) 746-2947.\n\nOur website is full of information regarding the WICed Fest. Do yourself a favor and check it out at http://www.WICedFest.com On there we have the latest and most up to date information. You'll also be able to get directions to the event, find local lodging (Best Inn & Suites has a special WICed Fest Deal), check out where you can grab some grub after riding, and check out pictures from last year's WICed Fest.\n\nSo, get ready because the Northeast is about to get rocked by the biggest party this side of the Mason/Dixon line! WICed Fest 2003 is going to be one for the record books!\n\nFor more information on the event, or if you are interested in sponsoring the WICed Fest, please contact:\n\nDan DeLaiarro\n\n(516) 318-4584\n\ndan@earthwake.com\n\nRob Anderson\n\n(203) 775-9393\n\nAXISBOARDS@aol.com\n\nWICed Fest\n\nWakeboarding In Connecticut Since 1998\n\nLink: http://www.WICedFest.com\n\nDate: June 11th, 2003 The Anti-Emo Empire!

Unsyned Artist with Radio 104 and the Webster Theater in Hartford CT hosted the 1st annual Connecticut Rock Awards this past Friday night, March 14th. Many CT bands were judged and given awards for such categories as best rock band, best solo artist, best single, best live performance, and many more. Windfall and the band Glennbyrnie were both up for the People's Rock Award and had to go head to head at the end of the evening, and the response of the crowd would determine which band would carry home the award. It was close, some of the Glennbyrnie fans had some massive lungs, but Windfall's fans screams and cheers overpowered and Windfall took home the award!\n\nLink: http://www.windfall-go.com\n\nDate: March 17th, 2003 Up Front Guitar Tabs!\n\nI have no idea if these are correct or not, but hey, if these kids can take the time to figure out the songs and post them on the web, the least that we can do is acknowledge their hard work and effort.\n\nSo pick up your guitar or bass and jump around your room like it's 1988!\n\nPS: Here are some more Up Front tabs, as well as every other hardcore band's that you can think of...

Now, 13 years later, Thorp Records has documented the career of this legendary Philadelphia band.\n\nHere is what the Thorp Records web site has to say:\n\nAll throughout the nineties, Philadelphia's EDGEWISE toiled and labored to make their assault of metallic hardcore prominent in the ears of east coast hardcore and metal kids. They toured constantly, including a stint with the then-unknown GREEN DAY. Somehow, the band never had a proper full length released domestically. They had some songs on comps and seven inches and the like, and a full length overseas, but no nationally distributed full length in North America.\n\nTHORP RECORDS has decided to salute EDGEWISE and brand them a part of our UNSUNG SERIES by bringing their history to the world in the form of the EDGEWISE \"Complete Discography\". EDGEWISE surpassed the existing standards for intense, metallic hardcore in the early nineties. With a slew of releases under their belt, this long-awaited, much-needed discography will solidify the band's mark on the worldwide hardcore scene. get into it and take a lesson from history.\n\nFor Fans Of: CRO-MAGS, INTEGRITY, HATEBREED and SICK OF IT ALL\n\nLink: http://www.thorprecords.com/\n\nDate: February 18th, 2003 Windfall Release Four Songs On Pal-Tone Records\n\nRadioDick 3 Way Split Series Volume 1\n\nWindfall together with The American Plague and Vanguard hit you square in the face with 4 kick ass songs each on this highly recommended cd.\n\nClick on the link below to see the Pal-Tone Records web site for more info on this and their other great releases.\n\nGet all of your up to the minute info on Windfall by frequently visiting http://www.windfall-go.com\n\nLink: http://www.pal-tonerecords.com\n\nDate: February 6th, 2003 Up Front Complete T-Shirt-ography\n\nOn How's Your Edge Site\n\nDid you ever have a great idea and then realize that you don't have the know how or the money to back it up? Well, that is what happened to me last year when I wanted to launch the Smorgasbord Records Web-Zine. I thought that I could put it all together and launch a cool web site with a lot of old school information. Being that I could not get the project off of the ground, I have decided to work with other web sites that already exist and can post the info for me.\n\nThis is exactly what I did on howsyouredge.com and if you click on the link below, you can view an extensive, to the best of my knowledge T-shirt-ography of every Up Front t-shirt known to me and the other band members.\n\nThere are some real gems up there like the picture here of the very 1st Up Front t-shirt ever made and some interesting bootlegs too.

I know first hand how hard it is to get the right members to play with and to keep things together. The loss of the band's drummer just after the release of the cd and difficulties finding a permanent replacement was the start of the band's slow demise. Now, a little over one year later, the breakup is official.\n\nJason and Sharie plan to continue to write and record together and if all goes well, they will have a new band in the future.\n\nAs for now, Jason is concentrating on his artwork, (and I must say, he is a very talented individual) and Sharie is taking courses in graphic design. You can check out a temporary web site that Jason has launched to display his art. A bigger and better site will be coming in the future.\n\nLink: http://homepage.mac.com/killerkatt/PhotoAlbum1.html\n\nDate: November 1st, 2002 Compression Book\n\nBy Martin Crisis\n\nOkay, here is a cool book that you should definitely check out. I am posting it in the Smorgasbord news section for three reasons.\n\n1st, We were suppossed to launch the Smorgasbord Web-Zine and review this book, but never got around to finishing the site.\n\n2nd, Three Days Dead Records released this book and then decided not to distribute it, leaving the author stuck with a ton of books, and no distributor.\n\n3rd, You can purchase it from Tim Cundle from Mass Movement zine. He is a great guy and a good friend and you can contact him for copies of the book at massmovement@currantbun.com\n\nHere are some reviews about the book for you to check out.\n\nCompression - Reviews\n\n\"The debut from writer Martin Crisis has been released on Punk label Three\n\nDays Dead ' cos it would be a tragedy if this book was left to rot on the\n\nshelves of a big time publisher while they figured out how to market it to\n\nGuardian readers. Author Crisis probably wouldn't want them touching his\n\nbook anyway, y'see Compression is built around punk music and it's author\n\nhas a passion for it that stretches way beyond name checking Black Flag\n\nwithin the novels pages. The book begins with it's hero Flanagan returning\n\nto the seaside dump of his youth for a school reunion. Having escaped the\n\ntown to become a famous punk rocker with a major label deal and a home in\n\nthe States, it becomes obvious that the singer is returning for more than a\n\nchance to see old school chums. Witnessing the murder of a mentally\n\ndisturbed man haunts him and Flanagan returns to seek redemption after drugs\n\nand music have failed him only to find that the murder case has been\n\nreopened. With excellent characterization and a rawness that's hard to find\n\nin the bookshelves of WH.Smiths, Compression raises questions about the\n\npower of music to change one's life, the validity of being 'punk' in the new\n\nmillenium and what it means to be truly honest with oneself. Fully\n\nrecommended\"\n\nBig Cheese Magazine.\n\n\"The debut novel from the cryptically named Martin Crisis, Compression, is\n\nthe story of Michael Flanagan, A successful. Contemporary British punk\n\nmusician (okay, this is a novel) whose past - and present - hides many\n\nsecrets, some murkier than others. The story unfolds over the space of 24\n\nhours, with more and more being gradually revealed, as Flanagan seeks\n\nredemption, and eventual freedom, from the long carried burdens of his\n\nyouth. Although the 'action' starts less than promisingly with the long,\n\nrain-sodden tedium of a motorway journey, things soon pick, and the reader\n\nreally starts to care about Flanagan's fate. Mr.Crisis has a definite way\n\nwith words and this is a promising debut. I'd recommend you seek this out\"\n\nVirginia Black, Rock Sound Magazine\n\n\"Martin Crisis, whoever he may be, is one pissed-off individual. His hatred\n\nfor himself and everyone around him is smeared across every page of his\n\ndebut novel like so much blood and shit. 'Compression' is a high-octane\n\nmixture of autobiography, wish fulfillment and twisted fantasy; the sordid\n\ntale of a punk rockstar returning to his home town for his school reunion,\n\nto confront a dark secret from his past that he has struggled to keep buried\n\never since he left there in the first place. Several painful home truths\n\nhave to be exhumed and dealt with en route; not least of all the fact that\n\nhe is in love with the wrong woman - and that for most of his adult life he\n\nhas been living a lie! This has been written with tremendous feeling, and\n\nthe anger of the author reaches out to grab the reader by the throat and\n\ndoesn't let go. And as someone who refused to attend my own school reunion -\n\nmainly out of disinterest than to make any concerted point to anyone - I can\n\ncertainly relate to the frustrations of the book's nihilistic anti-hero.\n\nWorth checking out\".\n\nIan Glasper, Terrorizer Magazine\n\n\"I'm so pleased to see books coming out of the punk rock underground and\n\nespecially from the UK scene. This is a work of fiction but methinks certain\n\ncharacters and situations are culled from the authors' own real-life\n\nexeriences. Flanagan is a successful punk rocker returning to his hometown\n\nfor a school re-union, the re-union is just a feeble excuse for him to tie\n\nup loose ends he left behind and more importantly, a chance to relieve his\n\nguilt of a crime committed years previously. It's a simple, short story,\n\nthere are few surprises and the writer leads you to the hopefully perfect\n\nending that you wish for the main character. I must admit that I thought it\n\nmay be a bit of a tough read, but I found myself absorbed after the first\n\nfew pages and it's a solid piece of work. I enjoyed it and you should\n\nsupport this endeavor, the more underground DIY literary projects the better\n\nas far as I'm concerned and watch out for further books from the guys at\n\nThree Days Dead. Good stuff\"\n\nDavid Stuart, Fracture Magazine.\n\nDate: October 10th, 2002 The Anti-Emo Empire! Radio Show\n\nWNHU 88.7 FM\n\nFor those of you who may not already know, I have been doing a radio show on WNHU 88.7 FM for the past year and a half. The show is called The Anti-Emo Empire! and I spin all 'old school' and 'new school' hardcore/punk. If you live near New Haven Connecticut or in Eastern Long Island, you can get the station. I am on every Tuesday afternoon from 4-5 PM. Tons of labels have been supporting me and the show, so I have many newer releases as well as the classic old school stuff. If you play in a hardcore or punk band or run a label that caters to hc/punk, you are welcome to send your music to me at the Smorgasbord PO Box address. Be sure to put the package attention to The Anti-Emo Empire! I don't care where you are from, as long as the music is good, fast, and passionate. Please though, no Emo, no Nu metal, and for God's sake, no Pop Punk!. I spin bands from all over the world. Past shows have included Bambix from Holland, Driftnet from Germany, Crivits from Holland, Pointing Finger from Portugal, and many many more.\n\nMy show is followed by my fiance' Michelle. She plays all Rockabilly/Psychobilly, classic and new. Her show is called Go Kat Go! and is every Tuesday from 5-6 PM.\n\nI am working on an Anti-Emo Empire! web site in the future, but for now, here are a few weeks worth of playlists.\n\nThe Anti-Emo Empire!\n\nTuesday October 8th, 2002\n\nSong / Band / Album / label / * Request\n\nSearch / Verbal Assault / Trial / Giant\n\nBringin' It Backwards / Lifetime / Jersey's Best Dancers / Jade Tree Records\n\nFurthest From The Middle / Ensign / Direction Of Things To Come / Indecision Records\n\nSanctuary / Sick Of It All / Live In A Dive / Fat Wreck Chords\n\nCoagulate / Snapcase / End Transmission / Victory Records\n\nThe Underage Anthem / Blind Society / Contrary To Popular Belief / Blackout Records\n\nWeak Dogs Bark More / What Happens Next? / Start Something / Young Blood Records\n\nNow I Get It / Lifes Halt / Start Something / Young Blood Records\n\nStupid Songs / Dayglo Abortions / Feed Us A Fetus / God Records\n\nBurning My Blindfold / Pointing Finger / The Distance Between... / Still Believe Records\n\nHe Who Says Farewell When The Road Darkens / Shai Hulud / Rev 100 / Revelation Records\n\nRuining It All / The Casualties / Die Hards / SideOneDummy\n\nMannequin Dream / Psychopunch / Bursting Out Of Chucky's Town... / White Jazz\n\nStep On It / Slapshot / The CD / Taang Records\n\nRed Black Blood Attack / Crispus Attucks / Red Black Blood Attack / Soda Jerk Records\n\nBack Track / Raw Deal / New Breed Tape Comp / Urban Style Records\n\nRunning Like Thieves / Bold / Looking Back / Revelation Records\n\nSilent Grave / Windfall / RadioDick Split Series / Pal-Tone Records / *\n\nSick People / Breakdown / 1987 Demo CD / Blackout Records\n\nLive For The Moment / Death Threat / For God And Government / Triple Crown Records\n\nCrimson Ghost / Misfits / American Psycho / Geffen\n\nThe Anti-Emo Empire!\n\nTuesday October 1st, 2002\n\nSong / Band / Album / label / * Request\n\nGoonies Never Say Die / The Curse / The Philadelphia Sound / Chunksaah Records\n\nGood Job, Kid / Go!

A memorial service was held in his hometown on Friday, June 21, 2002, to honor his memory. As the family wishes the details of Skip?s death to remain private, this is all of the information that Jade Tree can offer.\n\nA talented musician, Skip?s involvement in music began in his early teenage years and continued up until his accidental death. Skip played a huge role in the development of the emerging east coast straight edge hardcore scene of the late eighties and early nineties as a member of Turning Point. Turning Point later grew to defy simple categorization as they branched out from New York influenced hardcore to more complicated and emotional music based on Skip?s personal lyrics, which in turn inspired a new generation of reflective hardcore. Skip played a huge part in both Tim and Darren?s lives and our condolences, as well as those of all at Jade Tree, go out to his friends and family.\n\nLink: http://www.jadetree.com\n\nDate: June 27th, 2002 Ali Fast Times Interview\n\n1st interview as a stripper\n\nClick on the link which will take you to BurningAngel.net to read Ali's 1st interview since deciding to become a stripper back in March of 2001.

The cd will be released on Pal-Tone Records and the songs will be recorded at Up Start Studios in Hoboken NJ. Windfall's debut cd/ep 'Awaken', which was released back in July of 1999 was recorded with Chris and the band is excited to get back to work with him and Up Start.\n\nWindfall will be re-recording the song 'Growing Alive' which appeared on their full length cd 'Loud With The Windows Open So The Neighbors Can Hear', released in June of 2001. Also to be recorded will be the old time favorite 'Silent Grave', which originally appeared on the bands 1996 demo tape and has been a staple of their live show over the past few years. 'Kindle' and 'Touch The Touch' were actually recorded during the 'Loud' sessions, but were not up to par enough to make the final cut for the release.\n\nLink: http://www.upstartstudios.com\n\nDate: May 24th, 2002 Windfall to be on RadioDick Split\n\non Pal-Tone Records\n\nPal-Tone Records announced that Windfall, a tri-state area band will be featured on their upcoming RadioDick 3-sided CD release. The band will have four songs, including Growing Alive on the album, which is expected to be released in late summer.\n\nAccording to Pal-Tone Records A&R Director, Kevin Palisi, Windfall \"is a high energy band who gives a hard-hitting powerhouse live show. I was also very impressed on how well that energy can be felt in their recordings.\"\n\nWindfall's Jennifer Catucci's unique blend of strong sultry singing, coupled with genuine and passionate lyrics, hits you deep within. Bass player Mike Marmo, (formerly of Deny Victoria and World Indefference), along with veteran guitarists Jeff Terranova (formerly of Up Front) and Jon Biviano (from Supertouch - one of the best from the NY hard-core scene in the 80's and early 90's) help give Windfall a sound all its own. Add in the extremely talented Rob McDonough on percussion, and you can hear why the band's unique style of \"hardcore/rock\" continues to attract fans both near and far. With a European tour and countless live shows in the US, Windfall is making their mark and bringing passion, originality and sincerity into the music scene.\n\nPal-Tone Records is an independent record label from Milford, CT. The RadioDick series seeks out the best in local and underground music. The 3-sided LP features three bands that fit into a similar music genre. The other two bands to join Windfall on the 3-sided CD will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nLink: http://www.pal-tonerecords.com\n\nDate: May 24th, 2002 Smorgasbord Records Label Portrait\n\nAt www.In-Your-Face.de\n\nThis has been up there for a little while now, but we were just notified of it.

Windfall will be ready to hit the stage again by the middle of February and are in the process of confirming a bunch of dates for February and March. The last week of March the band will embark upon a three week Europen tour. This tour is to replace the tour from Nov/Dec 2001 that the band was forced to post-pone due to the loss of their bass player. The tour is being arranged by MAD from Berlin Germany and a few dates have already been confirmed. The tour will open with four consecutive shows with Holland's Bambix and then the band will venture out on their own.

The band made the decision a few months ago but did not want to make a huge deal about it. They did not want to play a \"farewell\" show or draw attention to the fact that they were no longer going to continue. The band's web site will remain up and the releases will remain in print, and who knows if the future will ever bring a reunion show or not.\n\nYou can catch bass player Graham playing in the Graves which features Michael Graves and Dr. Chudd of the Misfits. Chris is jamming with a drummer and will hopefully get something new rolling in the future. Ali is taking some time off and traveling the world and the country. Steve, the drummer from \"Counting Down\"\n\nhas been playing in the Worthless for many years and the band is quickly making a great name for themselves.

We want to thank all of the people who were involved in trying to make the tour a sucessful one. From the promoters to the zines to the fans of the band and Smorgasbord Records. Please accept our humble apologies and please understand that the band did everything in their power to try to complete the tour.\n\nHere is a statement from the news page on the Windfall web site.\n\n\"It comes as a great disappointment to the band to have to announce the following news. On 11/14/01 our bass player of 4 plus years decided to step down from his position. It comes as a semi major blow to the band leaving us having to postpone our European tour and most likely having to cancel some shows that were\n\nscheduled for mid December. The four of us were so determined to not cancel the European tour, that Jeff learned all of the bass lines and Jon Learned many of Jeff's guitar parts and we practiced as a four piece. It just wasn't the same, the band sounded very different and we did not have the proper amount of time to make the set tight enough to take to the stage. Plans are being made right now to reschedule the European tour for spring of 2002 and we will let you know the new itinerary once we have it. We are going to diligently seek out a new bass player and like the many other hurdles that this band has had to overcome this past year, we will come back stronger and better than ever\".\n\nLink: http://www.windfall-go.com\n\nDate: November 19th, 2001 SMORGASBORD MP3'S\n\nEmusic.com\n\n30 second snippets are avaialble by all of the Smorgasbord Records releases on the \"releases\" page.
