        "text": "This is an Atlantic Records Discography, albums released on the Atlantic Records label from its founding up until 1982, ordered by catalog number. Two of the major series of LP recordings were the \"1200\" and \"8000\" series, started by Nesuhi Ertegun. The \"1200\" series was reserved for jazz albums. The \"8000\" and subsequent series, started shortly after the 1200 in 1956, featured Atlantic's R&B and pop albums; when the \"1200\" series was discontinued in the 1970s, the jazz albums were mixed with the R&B and pop albums in their respective series. This list includes albums using Atlantic's numbering system that were released under their numerous subsidiary labels. There is a section containing albums related to the label as well.\n\nAtlantic's first 33⅓ RPM LP records were 10-inch albums and their first release in 1949 was a recording of Walter Benton's poetry set to music which was also issued as three 12 inch 78 RPM records.[1] This was followed by two albums in 1950 with the bulk of Atlantic's 10-inch albums released between 1951 and 1953. The 100 Series released mainly instrumental jazz LPs and the 400 Series featured vocalists. The album catalog numbers were often denoted by the prefix \"LP\" on the album cover and \"ALS\" or \"ALR\" on the record label.\n\nCatalog Artist Album Notes 110 and Vernon Duke This Is My Beloved Also released as a 12-inch 3 record 78 RPM set 108 I Love a Piano 109 Rhapsody 111 Heart Songs 112 Erroll Garner: Piano Solos 113 Piano Panorama Volume 1 of Piano Panorama Series – reissued as part of LP 1277 114 Piano Panorama Volume 2 of Piano Panorama Series 115 Ruth Brown Sings Rhythm and Blues Favorites Unreleased 116 Sarah Vaughan Sings 117 Tenor Sax Solos 118 Soprano Sax Solos 119 Jazz Guitar 120 A Fabulous Collection of His Most Famous Piano Solos Compilation of recordings originally released on QRS Records 121 Fantasy for Clarinet and Strings 122 Square Dance Party 123 Drums of Haiti Haiti Dances Recorded in Haiti under the supervision of Nicky Peters 124 Various Artists Waltzes of Vienna 125 Goldie Plays By the Sea 126 Pee Wee Russell 127 Jimmy Jones: Piano Solos 128 Passport to Fame Erroll Garner's First Recordings 129 Be-Bop 130 & Mama Yancey Yancey Special 131 Al Hibbler Unreleased 132 Piano Panorama Volume 3 of the Piano Panorama Series 133 Interpretations of the Great Boogie-Woogie Styles 134 Jimmy Yancey: Piano Solos 135 Erroll Garner: Piano Solos Vol. II 136 Piano Panorama Volume 4 of the Piano Panorama Series 137 Songs By Sylvia Syms 138 Dizzy Volume I Compilation of French recordings for the Blue Star label 139 Various Artists Dixieland at Jazz, Ltd.

This was followed by a two record set of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet in 1951.[2] Subsequent releases featured Dixieland, opera and selections from Broadway musicals before Nesuhi Ertegun took over responsibility for the LP series in 1955 and the series focused almost exclusively on jazz releases.[3] After one a very early experiment in 1953 stereo releases of Atlantic LPs began production in 1958 and by 1960 all releases were available in mono or stereo pressings—indicated by the prefix SD on the catalog number.[3] The series continued until late 1977 when it concluded with SD 1700 and most of the popular jazz artists moved to the SD 18100 Series and a limited number of albums were released on the 8800 Series.[4]\n\nCatalog Number Year Artist Title Notes 1201–3 1949 and Vernon Duke This Is My Beloved 3 record 78 RPM set 1204–5 1951 and Richard Waring with Dennis King Romeo and Juliet Scenes 2 record 33⅓ RPM set produced by Margaret Webster 1206 1952 and Muggsy Spanier Duets 1207 1952 Marie Powers Concert 1208 1952 Wilbur de Paris and His Rampart Street Ramblers Issued in \"binaural,\" an early stereo process 1209 1953 and Rex Stewart Big Jazz 1210 1954 Charles Sherrill Plays Music from \"Show Boat\" and \"Roberta\" 1211 1954 Charles Sherrill Plays Music from \"Pal Joey\" and \"A Connecticut Yankee\" 1212 1955 and His Giants The Swinging Mr. Rogers First album produced by Nesuhi Ertegun 1213 1955 Mabel Mercer Sings Cole Porter 1214 1955 Songs by Bobby Short 1215 1955 Paul Barbarin and His New Orleans Jazz 1216 1955 Octet Jazz & Romantic Places 1217 1955 and Warne Marsh Lee Konitz with Warne Marsh 1218 1955 Ted Straeter's New York 1219 1955 Wilbur de Paris and His New New Orleans Jazz 1220 1955 Tony Fruscella 1221 1955 Wein, Women & Song 1222 1956 The Magic Piano 1223 1956 with Bob Gordon Arranged/Played/Composed by Jack Montrose 1224 1956 Lennie Tristano 1225 1956 and the Famous Sidemen Tribute to Benny Goodman 1226 1955 Nobody Else but Me 1227 1956 The Greatest Garner 1228 1956 Chris Connor 1229 1956 The Teddy Charles Tentet 1230 1956 Bobby Short 1231 1956 Fontessa 1232 1956 and His Giants Martians Come Back! 1233 1956 and His New New Orleans Jazz Marchin' and Shoutin' 1234 1956 The Boss of the Blues 1235 1956 Here Is Phineas 1236 1956 Rodgers Revisited 1237 1956 Pithecanthropus Erectus 1238 1956 The Jimmy Giuffre Clarinet 1239 1956 Various artists Rock and Roll Forever Featuring Joe Turner, LaVern Baker, The Clovers, Clyde McPhatter & The Drifters, Ray Charles, Ruth Brown and T-Bone Walker 1240 1956 He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not 1241 1956 The World of Alcina 1242 1956 Ballads & Blues 1243 1956 Sylvia Syms Sings 1244 1956 Midnight at Mabel Mercer's 1245 1956 and Thomas Talbert Wednesday's Child 1246 1956 Baritone Sax 1247 1956 and Jimmy Giuffre The Modern Jazz Quartet at Music Inn 1248 1956 The Clovers 1249 1956 Octet Love Story 1250 1956 Bix, Duke, Fats 1251 1956 After the Lights Go Down Low 1252 1956 and Vernon Duke This Is My Beloved 1253 1957 Wilbur de Paris at Symphony Hall 1254 1957 The Jimmy Giuffre 3 1255 1957 Lush Life 1256 1957 with Phil Moore's Music That Satin Doll 1257 1957 Dizzy at Home and Abroad 1258 1957 Inside Hi-Fi 1259 1957 The Great Ray Charles 1260 1957 The Clown 1261 1957 Various artists Dixieland at Jazz, Ltd.
