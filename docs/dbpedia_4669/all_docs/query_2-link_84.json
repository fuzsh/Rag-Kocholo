        "text": "Rundgren\n\nOk, I need to start this off by saying that when I first got lit up by the radio… you know that moment… when you are glued to it… or maybe you don't. It's a very funny time we live in right now. Where music isn't consumed like it was. There are so many places to get it now.\n\nBut back when it hit me… (and in fact, I'm gonna do a quick search to get the year correct…) ok, I'm back. So 1972. That made me 10 years old. The songs that were on the radio when it REALLY hit me… when I was glued to the radio… “Hello It's Me” by Todd Rundgren, “Just You And Me” and “Feeling Stronger Every Day” by Chicago, “We're An American Band” by Grand Funk. These were the first sounds…\n\nSure, the stuff leading up to that my mother would play in our household were LOTS of Dionne Warwick… I remember James Brown… so there was always an undercurrent of soul music, rhythm and blues… which explains that my first love affairs with music, bands, etc were groove and funk based… It wasn't the rock stuff.\n\nAs I'm currently out touring performing The Beatles White Album with Todd Rundgren, Christopher Cross, Micky Dolenz and Joey Molland of Badfinger I get asked a LOT about what the White Album meant to me on its release and my answer is that it had no impact on me. I was 6 years old.\n\nBut now, cut to today… I'm 57 years old and I'm out with these iconic artists, and I'm reflecting back on when it all started clicking for me… and it was right then, about 1972-1973 that I became a MASSIVE radio fan. We all were. When we were all starting to bloom into teenagers and love was in the air, this was our soundtrack and anybody who was there can testify, what an amazing soundtrack to your life this was. STILL IS, right?\n\nSo I'm hearing “Hello It's Me” and I liked it. It wasn't what I was gravitating toward but I appreciated it… And more importantly it was one of the songs to the soundtrack of the next phase of my life. But what I was really gravitating more toward were the Chicago records… I also LOVED “We're An American Band” by Grand Funk and shortly after that Earth Wind and Fire would be coming onto the scene. I also LOVED Ohio Players, Kool and the Gang… again, just gravitating toward that kind of music.\n\nAnd of course, anybody who knows me knows that the ultimate awakening was/is Elton John. And again, if you break it down, VERY funk and R&B based. Those early records were PURE funk! I mean, come on. Bennie And The Jets! Funk? Please… the ULTIMATE deep funk groove… (thank you Nigel, Dee and Davey putting that funk into those records with Elton).\n\nI would sit and wait to hear my favorite songs. I would call in and request songs. I'd make friends with the DJs… at least I thought I was… and the first time I'd be *reminding* them of who I was and they acknowledged me… I was on cloud nine! I would call in and win prizes. In fact, one year I won Grand Funk's “We're An American Band” album. It was GOLD! Not only what it sold but the actual color of the album jacket. Someone told me the other day they actually released some LPs that were gold colored!\n\nBut I won it on the radio, and brought it home and played it LIKE CRAZY! I'd actually pretend I was a DJ too! My brother Todd won “Chicago 6” and I WORE THAT ALBUM OUT! “Feeling Stronger Every Day” and “Just You And Me” were hits on the radio right then so I'd play those songs and “We're An American Band” on our little toy record player and pretend I was a DJ. In fact, I think I made some little weird Radio Shack intercom system and told my brothers to go in the other room and I'd broadcast to them! haaaaaaaaaaa\n\nI LOVED this time. I was all over the radio… listening constantly… and when you think about it… it's so eery how these artists and songs would be little pointers to what I'd do in my lifetime. And when you're a kid and dreaming, this is impossible stuff. To be listening to these artists and one day not only know them but be contributing to these legacies at some point in very significant ways.\n\nSo cut to years and years later… I make friends with incredible artists, writers, producers, you name it and some of my favorite most brilliant musical minds reveal to me that Todd Rundgren is THEIR guy. And truthfully, I didn't quite get it. I mean, I loved that song and it represented a big change in my life with where radio, hits, music evolution was in the early 70s but I didn't know what I had missed… and now I do know…\n\nIt's well documented that when Todd had those first couple of hits as an artist he did a complete about face to all of it. Staying in that lane repeating himself or doing what an industry was telling him what to do. Some would call it crazy? Sabotaging a moment that you might be dreaming of your whole life? Getting to the top of the hill and doing an about face? The reason I didn't know much about him was because the records he would start to make were so different and for lack of a better phrase, anti what he'd been before… I just didn't really hear any of it.\n\nAnd now I know even more it's because I was listening to the radio… if it wasn't on the radio, I was young, impressionable and was in a social structure. School, basically the water cooler. We all went to school and were listening to the same music, watching the same tv shows… we had a common denominator… we wanted to fit in. We were wanting to like the same things.\n\nYes, there were a few people who were going off on different paths finding underground stuff and Rundgren's subsequent recordings would certainly be in that category, as he'd chosen to take it.\n\nI have one friend in particular who I won't mention by name… he can leave a comment if he so choses but I'll keep him anonymous for now… and this guy became one of the hottest music producers in LA for a good stretch. This guy influenced me heavily around 2007 onward. I started working with him and the speed in which he worked really appealed to me. I like working real fast too. He's a multi-instrumentalist… and when I saw how he recorded I realized that's who I need to hang with. Letting it rub off on me.\n\nNow remember, when I signed my first publishing deal in 1985 it was mainly to have autonomy. Because back then the gear wasn't out yet to be able to record decently without going into a studio. When the publishers who signed me asked me why I wanted a publishing deal I told them that a lot of it was to be able to go into the studio any time I wanted not depending on anybody else to get my in there… and I told them I wanted to be able to play all the instruments if I wanted and they gave me an opportunity…\n\nI went in and recorded “Heart Of Mine” that I co-wrote with Bobby Caldwell and Dennis Matkosky… I played all the instruments on that demo recording… that opportunity was literally what landed me the opportunity to join Chicago as the new lead vocalist at the end of 1985. Funny how I didn't really go back to that for a LONG time… the self sufficient musician. And that's because suddenly I had access to the best in the world. Best musicians, writers, producers… etc. But it's important to note what happened when I only relied on myself to go in and record.\n\nSo my buddy who is this incredible producer/musician and I are starting to really work on a bunch of stuff… and actually another thing he really inspired me to do was to not only work fast but do it wherever I was… and that was hotel rooms at the time. He would send me tracks for the major artists he was producing and there I'd go, into my room with my recording setup and get background vocals done. In fact, one of my favorite moments with all this and when I knew where the future was headed was probably somewhere around 2005 and we were on tour, Chicago and Earth Wind and Fire… I had sent my background vocals to my friend from our production office at the venue we were playing that night with EWF… think of this visual… I've got my stage clothes on, I've got my laptop wired into the internet… wireless kind of wasn't that robust yet… and Earth Wind and Fire was finishing up their set and we were about to go on…\n\nAll of a sudden I get this instant message from my buddy saying, “Plugging them in”… and I'm blown away… I sent him the files and he's PUTTING THEM INTO THE SESSION for the artist! He gets back within 2 minutes saying, “This is GREAT! Let me see if I can wrangle the first chorus into the other choruses”, and I'm thinking, “I was just sending them to you to see if we're close on this or not” and he's already plugging them in?!\n\nHe gets back about 2 minutes later and says, “It's great! It's working” and I'm just kind of standing there in awe… I'm hearing Earth Wind and Fire's last song which means there's going to be a 20 minute break before we go on… and all of a sudden a couple minutes later I see this instant message from my friend and it says “Sending”, and I'm going “WHAT????” and all of a sudden this moment happens where I literally saw the world change…\n\nRobert Lamm walks into the production office and the file had just finished downloading to me and it starts playing and Robert lit up and asked, “What's THAT?” and I said, “It's Clay Aiken's new record… I just did background vocals today in room 308. This is the new way of making records.” And I was never the same. As technology improved almost on a daily basis I started putting systems together to take out on the road with me and did more and more work for my friend who would send me tracks… he still does!\n\nSOOOOOOO, and I know this is a super long winded way to get to the point… BUT, my buddy would tell me from time to time how much Todd Rundgren meant to him… and it REALLY piqued my curiosity. If this is HIS guy, I need to dig deeper into this… but didn't get around it at first. We would have very spirited discussions on this and he knows Elton is MY guy. We'd actually have debates on the Elton vs, or compared, to Billy Joel. Billy Joel is my buddy's favorite between those 2. So there is definitely a fundamental difference to our tastes but still, the fact he was, and is, a self admitted Todd Rundgren FREAK I was very intrigued.\n\nWell, cut to this last year. I was just finishing up my solo record that Jay DeMarcus of Rascal Flatts produced. Basically an extension of the work we brought to the table to enable Chicago to get back into the studio after 16 years of no new music in 2006. We started a solo album on me right after Chicago 30 and got about half way through and I told him I wanted to shelve it for a while. We were touring so extensively that I just wasn't into stopping and starting so much so we put it on the back burner.\n\nWe revisited it about a year ago and realized we needed to finish it. Once we were getting close Jay said he was going to go around and start talking to agents to book me. He said, “When your record comes out the fans are going to want you to get out and perform so I'm going to speak to some agents.”\n\nOne agent pointed me toward Toby Ludwig. He said Toby works these corners real well of us legacy artists. Can you believe that? Going from being a kid listening to radio like I did in 1972 onward, not even really making my own music yet, to eventually playing at the 2016 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction with the band I contributed some of the biggest hits with in the 80s to eventually become a legacy artist?! What an amazing thing…\n\nSo Toby says he has this great tour he's putting together of an all star band to go out and perform The Beatles White Album. He says it's Todd Rundgren, Christopher Cross, Micky Dolenz and Joey Molland of Badfinger. It took me about 5 seconds to think about it!\n\nNow I need to say I didn't really know any of these guys… I'd met Christopher a couple times and played bass on one of his albums (he wasn't there during my session), but the rest would be new to me. I'm not afraid of that… I know some people get a bit nervous or concerned when there's a new group of folks to work with… and in all honesty… sure, there was a part of me that was thinking, “You never really know… these are BIG artists with I'm sure big personalities… so you just never know… it could go one of 2 ways” but I was really looking forward to it.\n\nI'd heard stories about Todd over the years. The one that seemed to be the most consistent and would explain all the sub categories of the stories, is that he's brilliant… actually genius level and with that you just might get strong personality… very strong opinions… and I'd heard he could be very sarcastic… (which guess what? that's music to my ears!).\n\nNow my buddy gave me a bit of a crash course on what he knows about Todd. As long as you're not fawning all over him, that's a good thing. And I'm thinking, “No problem… fortunately I'm not a freak like you are! Now if it was Elton, I'd probably be freaking out a bit here”. And I was also told as long as you're bringing the music, everybody's happy. So for the most part I'm pretty comfortable going into this. And, I'm one of the names they wanted to add to this for marketability… so I'm thinking that we're all looking at the list of who's doing this and either knowing or will be informed of what everybody's done and there will most likely be a certain amount of respect walking into it. Which there was. So the only thing that could go wrong is to start freaking out about this… which I wasn't worried about…\n\nAnd that's not to mention any of the other names on this. I mean, come on! Micky Dolenz? My age group was experiencing The Monkees AS IT HAPPENED! This was MUCH more of a potential fanboy scene for me than Rundgren would be. And Christopher Cross… I'll never forget being in Evanston, IL with my buddy Bill Quateman in 1980 waking up one morning to a very soft level of a nightstand radio playing “Sailing”. Another life changing moment for me. I was hearing the voice of an angel coming out of the speakers… it was morning so the metaphor was I was awakening… I was as far east as I'd ever been. First time past Arizona as far as leaving the comfort of my youth and discovering a new world. Again, looking at the signs… in a city that would be the name of the band I'd join, eventually performing that song “Sailing” and providing harmony vocals to him and reading from our mutual fans, “Jason's voice is the perfect compliment to Christopher Cross's!” I mean, come on you guys… it's as if I'm making this stuff up, right? Just kind of too over the top, BUT, it's true. And Joey Molland? Not only performing with him nightly but singing background vocals to him on his upcoming solo record? Hearing my voice with Badfinger? Crazy… but true.\n\nWhen I was doing my homework for this White Album tour I not only studied the actual White Album but I was brushing up on my partners for the tour. Listened to the Badfinger hits we would perform… (I already knew the Monkees stuff just because… it's in your dna!), revisited and learned Christopher's stuff, learned Todd's 2 tunes he'd be doing during our mini set of our hits… and I found a book on Todd on how he produced records… Now THAT sounded like a great way to check this guy out.\n\nI knew that he produced “We're An American Band”. I didn't know it or would have looked for that as a 11 year old kid but I'd heard it somewhere many years ago. And THAT impressed me. The sound of that record, EVERYTHING about it, was as great as it gets. The recording… all of it.\n\nWell, I dive into his book and realize HE WAS THE RECORDING ENGINEER on all this stuff he produced! In fact, one of his first gigs was being a staff engineer, which backed into the first opportunities he'd get as a record producer, such as taking over the reins on Badfinger's “Straight Up” album that yielded the hits… “Baby Blue” and “Day After Day”. George Harrison was producing “Straight Up” and got pulled away to do the “Concert For Bangladesh” so Rundgren stepped in to finish the album as the producer.\n\nNow let's just pause for a second and think about this… I remember, vaguely since it was 1971, hearing about this. I remember when the Badfinger hits came out and it was right there during this time when I was getting into LOTS of radio listening. The Beatles were still together, not much longer… and during that period of radio I remember “Maxwell's Silver Hammer” came out… so I was there present listening to the radio when the Beatles were still releasing singles… amazing to me when I look back on it and saw what I great up in. And more amazingly, to eventually become part of this family.\n\nSo here's this guy who's really not even thinking about being an artist, at least not as his main thing… is being hired as this wonder kid engineer, started producing… started having hits and then has one of his own as an artist… well a few actually but “Hello It's Me” is what I'm referring to.\n\nI keep reading the book and all of a sudden the essence starts popping out… the speed in which he works… (which is truly where I choose to be these days because I believe when you put the right ingredients together and get out of the way that's when you're going to capture the magic). The fact he's PLAYING on these records. One of the greatest quotes from this book is that he'd tell the artists, “If you know what you want I'll get it for you. If you don't know what you want, I'll do it for you” HAAAAAAAAAA!!!! I love it! No goofing around… let's move! Let's GO! And with that, of course you're going to step on toes now and then.\n\nI'd heard that about David Foster… that he'd just plow through and sometimes there would be feelings hurt. But guess what? These guys are hired to make hits. It's called *produce* which means produce hits. And they did. It's what was expected of them and that's why they were/are called.\n\nAs I kept reading this book I realized this was what I did at first that launched my career… I went into the studio, played everything myself and produced a hit. Boz Scaggs ended up cutting “Heart Of Mine” but it was a hit for me in the sense that it started everything for me.\n\nAnd then, as I kept reading about how Todd made/makes music one thing really jumped out at me. Sure, great engineer, great producer, great artist… actually there are 2 things that jumped out at me… I already knew about the first thing but when I went back and revisited his work, I heard it for myself… he is one of, if not the first person to be self contained. He not only was engineering getting great sounds but he PLAYED EVERYTHING. All the instruments, INCLUDING the drums! Reading how he'd press record in the control room and have to run out to play drums and then when finished run back into the control room to stop the tape! Now THAT is having to get it right! This is before you can go in and really fix things like drums.\n\nAnd then, the REAL epiphany happened… when I realized ALL THE BACKGROUND VOCALS WERE HIM! Now think about this… I've made a career out of being a singer and not just that having an affinity toward background vocals and not just background vocals, BIG background vocals. I was under the tutelage of the best. Starting with David Lasley and all the great vocalists he'd assemble for my first pro background vocal session dates, on to Bobby Caldwell and ultimately Bill Champlin one of the all time great singers and recording singers… yes, lead vocalist from another planet but the background vocal thing… otherworldly… and that's what I made my career with. Mainly Champlin and myself. Not only Chicago but Kenny Rogers, Gino Vanelli, The Commodores, George Benson and many more.\n\nSo when I found out it was Rundgren doing all of those background vocals on not only his own stuff but on records like Meatloaf's “Bat Out Of Hell” record? (which he also produced). Celine Dion! I mean, go back and listen to those records and listen to the precision of the background vocals… that sound like an extension of the artist… not drawing attention to itself!\n\nI mean at the risk of comparing, (which in one sense is really impossible… there's no one like him), this reminded me of what I've always strived for… if I'm singing background vocals with anybody I'm trying to make myself an extension of them. And I know that's not an easy thing… and here's Rundgren… operating at this highest level! And really just supporting… not trying to be noticed… the guy behind the scenes… an unsung hero if you will…\n\nAnd I'm really relating to this! As a 23 year old kid and getting thrust into the spotlight of singing all the singles off Chicago 18 with a LOT of spotlight and attention… when I'd go back into the role of singing background vocals and with Champlin… (remember, this is my teacher… and early mentor) I'd watch and saw how Bill behaved… sure, we were singing some of the biggest pop hit singles as lead vocalists in one of the greatest American bands but when we shifted duties and worked for someone else, it was about supporting that artist, that song… and here's Rundgren doing it, as one of the founding fathers quite honestly… leaving the clues for people like me that eventually go on a discovery mission and realize what all the fuss has been about!\n\nI'm also a HUGE Hall and Oates fan and am very grateful to have toured with those guys too… and come to find Todd is one of Daryl's biggest heroes. What?! I never would have seen that coming… until I actually went back and studied it.\n\nSo here I am embarking on this tour here in 2019 and realizing this is a guy who I related to in so many ways. The artist who wears so many hats and isn't caught up in that one thing… and again, I almost wince when I call myself an artist in the same sentence as Todd Rundgren. And yes, I know I am one and continue to explore and expand what that is… but I'm pointing out that I'm able/lucky enough, once again to be standing next to someone who is going to influence. In fact, that's the one thing, even before I did any homework on Todd, I knew would happen. Or at least I thought there was a good chance of it, and it actually did. I figured other than the music, (which I was becoming a fan of for the first time… the deep stuff… the stuff I realized now are the things that have created the Todd freaks), but what he'd be like *as an artist*. Let's see what that looks like.\n\nAnd as I've just released my 2nd solo album “Here I Am” a couple weeks ago, I'm out there as an artist and really for the first time as a solo artist. So I figured one of the benefits, potentially, would be to see what an artist like Todd would be like.\n\nAnd here it goes… this is going to be so simple… I'm not going to pretend to know what goes on this guy's head but this is my interpretation and most importantly how it hits *me*. And remember, I'm not specifically looking for this. If we just went out to perform this music and he was just another great artist doing his job, fine and dandy… but I'm a pretty observant person and especially when something is brilliant, to me. When there is that thing that's going on that no one else would be able to catch… (and how would they? I'm speaking of my own experience and the impact certain influences would have on me), I REALLY take that stuff in. And with all the things that have happened in the last few years of my life, I'm reminded almost daily to take it all in because life is screaming by and on a dime it changes. We lose people… we are faced with a new world… it's happening left and right. I guess it always has… it's just that when we get to a certain age and more change, loss, etc. happen we keep getting awakened.\n\nSo back to Todd… he's standing right next to me on stage. FIRST thing I notice, is he walks out with an outfit that is PURE rockstar. And not put on. Not trying to be anything… it IS who this guy is. And as he's standing on the side of the stage, where I'm standing, and we're ready to go out, I see and feel his energy that it appears this guy LIVES for this. So how do you think that makes me feel? Monkey see monkey do. There's an energy that goes out on that stage and it's EXTREMELY heightened. And as I look across the stage, everybody has it. I'm not going to throw all the credit to Todd… you've got Micky Dolenz, Joey and Christopher not to mention the incredible backup band we have… it's ON.\n\nAnd we get out there and start wailing “Back In The USSR”. And as it goes into the guitar solo Todd turns to me and I turn to him and we start doing rock pose, head bobbing moves and it's authentic! One of the first shows we did as our hair was flailing around he leans over to me and yells over the stage level, “We have the Hair! Let's USE IT!” and we just start ROCKING OUT!\n\nWe then go into “Dear Prudence” which I sing and feel out of the corner of my eye Rundgren reacting to notes, feels… this guy is IN IT. Then, we go into “Everybody's Got Something To Hide (Except Me and My Monkey)… and let me tell you… THIS IS NOT AN EASY SONG TO SING IN THAT RANGE. And it's Todd's first song of the night. I remember in rehearsals when he commented on, “Nice, my first song is up in this range!” and I have to say, I was thinking to myself, “Man, that's not only up there but to sing it properly, with the gravel and growl… mere mortals would be TOAST after night 1”.\n\nWell, EVERY night this guy is not holding back… and delivering. EVERY NIGHT. I'm noting to myself “TOTAL… COMPLETE… OLD SCHOOL… WORLD CLASS… PRO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” I can't believe it. EVERY NIGHT. And not only that… later in the show he sings “Helter Skelter” and it's even MORE of a potential throat killer because this guy ISN'T GOING TO BACK OFF. And guess what? He never misses a note, all tour. Never coming up the next night a little *worn out*. NEVER. ALWAYS THERE. PRO!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI'm taking this all in with a front row seat and being schooled, again, nightly… and I have to say that when I look back on all the concerts I've done with Chicago I've never felt like I backed off. I lost my voice a few times over the years. I mean where I literally lost it, and still would try to sing the tunes… I never backed off… I'm proud of that truth. But when I see Todd Rundgren go out there and on NOTE 1. He is absolutely delivering on another level and I'm just thinking of all the people who would be thinking to try and be careful… Don't overdo it… pace yourself… but this is another one of those examples of extremely world class and I've been so lucky to have them as a simultaneous peer/partner but a mentor/teacher right alongside of that. And I'll also throw in to all the up and comers… you have to pay attention to see it. I see so many younger people who miss this kind of stuff… they may be in a higher/better position as far as their current professional status and think there's nothing to learn from these people but wow, if you have your eyes open and are lucky enough to work with these folks… the lessons will blow you away, if you're paying attention.\n\nSo we've got this going on… we're out there getting this tour up and running and we start drilling it as a team. We start selling out and the reviews are awesome… so much that we're getting interest and offers to do it next year as well. About 2 weeks into the tour we're all riding along on the bus… and there are a LOT of us. Since this was a real startup and we had to go out there to get it going we've had to do it as economically as we could so there are a LOT of us on a bus. Here's another thing I was wondering about how this was going to go. Was there going to be 1 guy who would commandeer the back lounge, or the front lounge and the unspoken rule would be, “Don't go back there… that's so and so's space…”? But guess what, that didn't happen.\n\nAll of a sudden one night after a show and the thing was really gelling I looked around and notice we were all up in the front lounge! There was Todd, Micky, Joey Molland, Joey C. our musical director, Darin – drummer/vocals, Gil – keys and Geoff our tour manager… I think there were 8 of us up there. No one was in the back lounge… and we were hooting and howling… the thought occurred to me that my buddy who loves Todd so much give anything to be stuffed in a front lounge with a bunch of dudes including mainly his hero… and here I was, in the middle of it. THEN, it occurred to me when it was explained to me on many occasions… all of us are heroes to someone. Each one of us has people who would love to be up in the front lounge hanging with us… and again, I realized how lucky I am. And I'll go one step further that we ALL are heroes to somebody. Everybody who reads this… don't ever forget that. You are a hero to someone so make sure you let them know you acknowledge that and honor it.\n\nOne night I drove with Todd into the city, NYC, with Toby since we had a day off and it was a really nice ride. Todd ended up playing some songs he's working on… mainly collaborations he does with other people and of course, since we were working together and from my perspective it was going well and I felt we have a nice thing musically going on, (you should hear him singing background vocals with me on “25 or 6 to 4”! Actually I'll post at the bottom of this), so I'm thinking, “Man, I'd like to collaborate with him…” but you never know… this is a guy who can pick and choose so who knows? So I figure I might as well just kind of probe a little bit.\n\nAnd I'm thinking about my project with Tommy Thayer. We have 8 songs recorded we wrote with Randy Goodrum and they're just kind of sitting around incubating. A lot of it is pretty close to being finished but Tommy's out on the “End Of The Road” tour with KISS that's supposed to go all the way through 2021. But I called Tommy and asked what he thought about me asking Todd if he'd be open to hearing any of our stuff to possibly mix? So I asked him… and he told me he does it all the time. He said, “Just send me a song, and if I like it you can send me another one” and I thought, cool. He's at least open to listen. So I sent him one. He got back to me a couple days later and said he'd take a crack at it. When I called Tommy he was super happy Rundgren would possibly work with us.\n\nI sent him the files when we got done with that tour and in typical TR fashion, everything I'd heard about him, he whipped up a GREAT mix quickly. I played it for Tommy, who loved it, told Todd we loved what he had so he went in and finished it. *Detailed* it as he put it. It came back the next day and there we had it. One of our tunes mixed by Todd Rundgren.\n\nAfter going back and studying what this guy is about and now having worked with him as a performing artist but now he's gotten involved with my recordings, I can't tell you how happy I am to not only have met an icon but become an associate. AND, believe me, for those who know me… my wheels are spinning on ideas to do some other things with him. Based on my solo album having just been released and having an amazing team back in Nashville with Jay and our other partners on the record label side of things, they all know this solo album is basically just opening the floodgates. As I said, I have the project with Tommy Thayer that's almost complete. I've reconnected with Mark Hudson on Joey Molland's record and we talked last night about new projects… my team knows I'm going to be forming my own production company to do many projects. And one thing I'd LOVE to do is put together some kind of project with Todd. Don't know that is, what his ultimate interest would be, his availability… but this I do now… time and life are screaming by and I'm not waiting for anything.\n\nI'd like to close for now by saying I went to this AWESOME party in Akron, OH during our first run of White Album tour dates. Kasim Sultan performed Utopia stuff, along with Gil who has been playing in Utopia and us on the White Album Tour, and they told me that if I attended this party there would be so many super fans for Todd there. Getting all geared up for our show the next night… and they were… well, the amazing thing were among those fans there were many who had seen me over the years with Chicago and were so wonderful, gracious, appreciative… and as I was told, suddenly in all my posts in social media, I'd see many of you starting to show up! You have to know how great that makes me feel that our families are expanding. And I know how much you love the music… believe me, I'm paying attention… and if there's any way to continue to grow our recordings, our associations, our lives together, I will do the best I can to facilitate.\n\nWe've all run into each other for a reason. And I'd love to say how happy and grateful I am to not only have been able to work with Todd Rundgren musically but now I have him as a friend.\n\nHere's to the next run of White Album dates we have coming up… (this was written on Nov 20, 2019)\n\nThank you all for being here!\n\nJason"
