        "text": "Death Valley/Afterburn/Buttercup Records\n\nIn early 1991 myself and longtime pal Bevan ( we worked together at Au-Go-Go Records for six +years) decided that we wanted to do a label together so we set DEATH VALLEY RECORDS on it’s way. We were into Overseas stuff at that time like : SUGAR SHACK , SLUG, DAZZLING KILLMEN, SISTER RAY, 64 SPIDERS, UNSANE, GIRL TROUBLE, THE MELVINS, DEAD MOON, THE MIRACLE WORKERS,THE MIKE GUNN, and more.. And Aussie /NZ stuff on our radar from our notebook at the time had bands such as : THE GUTTERSNIPES, GREEN BEAVER, TRUCKHEAD, VENOM P. STINGER, THE DEAD C, SLUB, FREELOADERS, 3 TOED SLOTH and more.. We got a pal to design the logo ( Evel Knieval jumping the grand canyon) and set about to get stuck the hell in…Two of those we locked in and we did a nice little run of 7”s initially of some of our favourite bands featuring some of our favourite people. It wasn’t a label with a HUGE discography ( 10 singles and 5 CD’s) but we did some PRETTY GREAT releases and some of the songs here are STILL amongst a bunch of my fave songs of all time so we can look back at it fondly, knowing that we did some good shit and stayed true to the music that we loved. Here is how it panned out over time….& at the bottom are detailed notes on each release..\n\nDV 001 - SLUB - Barracuda 7”1993 Still Available\n\nDV 002 - CHRISTBAIT / DIRT CLOD FIGHT -Split 7”1994\n\nDV 003 - SCOURGE - Phoenix 7”1994 Still Available\n\nDV 004 - VENOM P. STINGER -Thickskin 7”1994\n\nDV 005 - HOSS - The Tiredest Man Awake 7”1994\n\nDV 006 - THE POWDER MONKEYS -Get the Girl Straight 7”1994\n\nDV 007 - THE SICK THINGS - Committed To Suicide 7”1994\n\nDV 008 - MUD CITY MANGLERS / THE SPOILERS -Split 7”1997\n\nDV 009 - PETER JEFFERIES & CHRIS SMITH -Ghost Writer 7”1999\n\nDV 010 - LIMES -Tarantula CD2005 Still Available\n\nDV 011 - DERN RUTLIDGE /WARPED -Split 7”2000\n\nDV 012 - CHRIS SMITH -Replacement CD2000\n\nDV 013 - CHRIS SMITH -Bad Orchestra CD2007\n\nDV 014 - STEVE YOUNG - Australian Tour CDep2007 Still Available\n\nDV 015 - NOW TIME DELEGATION -Watch For Today CD2010 Still Available\n\nNotes on the Discography :\n\nDV 001 -SLUB - The first cab off the rank was from this great local experimental band who we both dug & thought they were a vital part of Melbourne’s underground scene. For them to cover an 80’s mainstream band ( Heart ) was in itself kinda trippy and they did it in the SLUB way.\n\nIt had a great sleeve and came with a DIY cassette, the remaining copies of which are for sale on the FMR homepage. Great band and amazing musicians.\n\nDV 002 - CHRISTBAIT / DIRT CLOD FIGHT - Wow ! We were both MAD on these bands… Christbait from Melbourne and DCF from the USA… Christbait had been blowing us away with their Godflesh inspired HEAVY for awhile and they remain for me, a huge live fave who filled my brain with all that it needed at that time across the early 90’s so we were super stoked to get this 7” out and it remains their only release on that format. When we both ordered in the early DCF 7” and ‘Everything That Isn’t’ album on Flipside they crushed us with their power & delivery…Phil Merwin’s vocals were just on FIRE ! so we followed up and made this split happen and love the heck out of it. Geelong was an area which took to Dirt Clod Fight & there were a bunch of us ( like a secret cult) who fussed over them and held a ‘code’ of appreciation for this band for many a year. They would even end up playing one of the RIVER ROCKS gigs at the Barwon Club in Geelong in 2016 ( which unfortunately we both could not make).\n\nDV 003 - SCOURGE - Well again, we had seen tens and tens of shows of Scourge live ( mostly at the Great Britain Hotel) and we got to know them as friends through our fandom so it was a no brainer to us to lock in a 7” and their dark howling rock rumble was something that we loved the shit out of. Really interesting characters with deep involvement in music ( some of the members were from the mid 80’s Punk scene in AARDVARK’S AFTERBIRTH, and were also heavily embedded in the noise/ Art /experimental scene in bands such as WOMNAL & SOOTERKIN FLESH) Great creative guys who we always enjoy seeing out and about to this day when we are at shows or friends 50th’s or 60th’s parties in some dark haunt deep in the guts of Melbourne…\n\nDV 004 - VENOM P. STINGER - We were longtime fans of VPS and held them in incredibly high esteem as one of Melbourne’s most original bands. They were a part of our musical DNA & we loved them live and on record and were always gonna lock in a single or the discography just would not be the same…All members had deep deep history going back to the early days of the Punk scene and some of the band members lived utterly wild kinda lives sometimes on a knife edge ( with two no longer with us),and the other two of course being intense players in THE DIRTY THREE (along with the mesmerizing violin of Warren Ellis). Top single and what a band…\n\nDV 005 - HOSS - Well again, these are just our MAIN FAVE BANDS, we’d travel to see them play, turn up at every gig, buy every record and we both knew they were simply AMAZING as a band & these two songs are utterly magical for me personally with that dynamic guitar, hard punch sonic kick and Joel’s always brill lyrics and delivery… A band where EVERY member was SUPER IMPORTANT to the end result and this remains one of my fave 7”s of ALL TIME !We both will forever hold this band up high on any pedestal you wanna slide in front of us…10/10 this 7”…\n\nwith the cover drawn by the cat who also designed and drew the DV logo at the time…\n\nDV 006 - THE POWDER MONKEYS - What can I say… ANOTHER band who we would drive for miles to see AS MANY GIGS AS WE COULD, we knew ALL the songs, every kick, every beat, every snarl & they soundtracked our 90’s like no other band in so many ways. We were of course big fans of GOD from being at Au-Go-Go at the time of ‘My Pal’ and their 12”s and LP so our love of both Joel and Tim’s future music was always gonna be on our radar and as we were such active gig attendees of course you get to know people quite well over a period of years. The PM’s remain one of my fave all time live band experiences and they are a part of everything that I do with music and creativity to this day, one hundred per cent. The fact that every single member of GOD kicked on to do solid and interesting music is a testament to their musical chops, drive and attitude as people… to forge their own paths in the way they saw fit. Influential as you wanna…\n\nDV 007 - THE SICK THINGS - This one was a straight up reissue of the classic 1981 AUSSIE PUNK SPUZZ ep which would see band members later end up in VENOM P. STINGER and THE DIRTY THREE and is a totally insane audio attack from another of Melbourne’s most intense bands. It\n\nremains one of the most INTENSE musical monsters to be unleashed in this state and STILL blows people away to this day. Total Total PUNK GOLD….fierce, nasty and Nhilistic Muck bar none…\n\nDV 008 - MUD CITY MANGLERS / THE SPOILERS - By this point.. 1998/1999 I had stepped aside from the label as Bevan became heavily involved with his friend Craig Bailey ( Scott from Hoss’s Brother), who had a label and distro (International Trash) running out of the CORDUROY RECORDS vinyl pressing plant in the backwoods of the South East. He was a member of THE SPOILERS and had imported copies of the band’s first two killer singles (1997, 1998), the latter being on 007 Records which was a label which Craig really championed. This 7” came out in 1999 and the next year Craig would release (the incredible) debut album from THE MUD CITY MANGLERS (‘Heart full of Hate’) which a shitload of Aussies discovered, played to death and rocked out to hard for the next 12 months. A great bratty punk LP you should seek out..\n\nDV 009 - PETER JEFFERIES & CHRIS SMITH - Bevan is a walking encyclopedia on NEW ZEALAND independent music ( being born there) & over the decades has turned so many people onto bands from across the way, many of whom may still mention it to this day if they happen to bump into him at a show, so PJ was long on his radar from his time in NOCTURNAL PROJECTIONS ( early 80’s with his equally active Bro Graeme) & THIS KIND OF PUNISHMENT, along with a deep solo catalogue, and local musician CHRIS SMITH was someone who Bevan became close friends with and a huge supporter of his music and would later put out two of his great albums on DV on CD. ‘Ghost Writer’ is a great little 7” and Bevan did a great insert with one of his many detailed artist discographies he would meticulously create over the years.\n\nDV 010 - LIMES - I came back into the fold around 2004 and we were both taken by this CD-R from this killer MEMPHIS band we loved which I think turned up at Au-Go-Go or in one of our Mailboxes… We got in touch with Shawn from the band and ‘Tarantula’ came out in 2005 and we both still play it to this day ! Great people and really awesome laid back garage ( If you do an order on this site, ask for a FREE COPY of it in the notes section) & it was well received locally by maybe 100 or so people who LOVED it, but a tough call to try and sell 500 of an unknown CD in Australia. Six years later in 2011, the great Memphis label GONER reissued our little CD ( saying it came from NZ) on LP/CD & included another cool CD-R ( Blue Blood) as extra tracks. Killer CD.\n\nDV 011 - DERN RUTLIDGE /WARPED - Sometimes when you do a label you fuss and fart over the Catalogue Numbers and you often lock in a number which may take a while before it comes out, or you leave a number vacant for a later release… this happened here as 011 came out in 1999.. SIX YEARS BEFORE 010 above so shit happens with sequence sometimes so we try not to lose any sleep over it… This was another which Bevan was all over and he was big on the music of Craig Westwood ( Dern Rutlidge) who was creating songs from his Post -CHRISTBAIT period. This was another split ( and the labels last VINYL release), with Geelong/Melbourne’s mighty WARPED, who we knew as very young fellas who we’d watch lug in gear to pubs with their parents and who were also associated with the Au-Go-Go label. It came in a odd fold over 7” sleeve at it’s tip and was also stamped with the International Trash logo.\n\nDV 012 /013 - CHRIS SMITH - Bevan worked very closely with Chris and issued two CD full length albums ‘ Replacement’ (his second album from 2000) and ‘ Bad Orchestra’ (2007). I was supportive of what he was doing but had no real part in seeing these come to fruition but that ‘Bad Orchestra’ album really IS a MAGNIFICENT GEM of a record of cool abrasive blues etched punch and this would not go un noticed 7 years hence as BEN CHASNY of the excellent SIX ORGANS OF ADMITTANCE would reissue this album on LP/CD as the second release on his own ‘Hermit Hut’ imprint ( HH-02 ) and it would get GLOWING reviews from around the world both then and now and is a wonderful wonderful album. Swedish free-jazz saxophonist MATS GUSTAFSSON penned a great heartfelf review of it which may well make you wanna own it (read it here). Chris\n\nwould go about his musical business as an unknown entity for the most part within his own country, but without a doubt had scattered fans around the globe who REALLY got what he was doing and hold these albums close. Chris was also previously a member of the GOLDEN LIFESTYLE BAND who will appear on FMR in 2022 on LP…So the circle keeps turning.\n\nDV 014 - STEVE YOUNG - 2007 Australian tour CDEP\n\nBevan remains a HUGE fan of STEVE YOUNG ( along with others like CAPTAIN BEEFHEART , THE VELVET UNDERGROUND, IGGY & THE STOOGES & PERE UBU to name but a few), and we are talking DEEP DEEP fandom here, not just ownership and enjoyment of an artists officially released albums and singles…This is TRUE band devotion, where you track down every version from every country, seek out demos, bootlegs, promos, cover versions…it’s a true engagement with the artist and he has had a great impact and influence on MY OWN music appreciation and discovery and has turned me onto SO MUCH insanely magical music over the years it’s wild so for us both to work together and get this AUSTRALIAN TOUR EP out in 2007 was a really proud and personally rewarding moment and something we would both follow up on the CD Reissue label listed below. Steve is a legend in music, a Outlaw Country champion who had an incredibly rich life and whose songs affected millions of people the world over, with artists from THE EAGLES to LINDA RONSTADT to DOLLY PARTON to WAYLON JENNINGS and many more. He passed away in 2016 and if you haven’t…you really should ! I thank Bevan for making me a big SY fan to this day.\n\nDV 015 - NOW TIME DELEGATION - We were both fans of a lot of the music which came from TEXAS, especially 80’s/90’s Punk/Garage, so when we heard this album ‘Watch For Today’ featuring BIG BOYS / LORD HIGH FIXERS legend TIM KERR, along with LISA K from L.A.’s BELLRAYS doing wild Soul /Garage, we thought that an Aussie version would be a cool thing so that is what we did and it became the final release on the label. The American release was on our fave label IN THE RED, one that we had both religiously followed for decades and whose label head LARRY HARDY had an incredible ear for great gritty music ( and still does) and who has also heavily supported wild Aussie sounds sporadically across his vast discography (since the early 90’s)\n\nIn 2000 and something or other we had two great external office spaces for the label, one in Hawthorn and a big shop front space in Gilbert Rd Preston which we fully decked out ceiling to floor with music posters and desks and storage etc… which was a great space while it lasted but could never sustain itself so we had to give it up as the rent payments and reality stepped in and told us to shape the hell up and move the hell out.\n\nAfterburn Records - 2003 to 2008"
