        "text": "Featured Titles:\n\nErika de Casier – Still CD/LP (4AD)\n\n33-year-old Danish singer, songwriter and producer Erika de Casier built a cult following with her 2019 debut album Essentials, and emphatically lopped off that “cult” designation with 2021’s Sensational, her first album for 4AD. In the past few years, she’s performed at some of the biggest festivals in the world, written for pop stars (such as New Jeans) and sung on hyped dance tracks. But when she ushers you into the expanses of her third album-with a coy “Welcome… it’s gonna be a lot of fun” – she’s inviting you to leave any crass The Nordics’ Next Big Thing or Rising Alt-Pop Star epithets at the door, next to your shoes and coat. de Casier may have won a lot of new fans in the past three years, and a lot of high-profile collaborators, but as this album’s title confirms, she’s the same old Erika de Casier.\n\nJJ Grey & Mofro – Olustee CD/LP (Alligator)\n\nOlustee is a masterpiece of soul-shaking music. JJ’s deep Southern roots and skill as a storyteller shine through, whether he’s rocking with gospel-tent fervor or slowly winding his raspy voice around a lyric of heartbreak and loss. It’s an aggressively groove-driven record fueled by JJ’s gritty vocals and funk-infused guitar playing.\n\nHurray For The Riff Raff – The Past Is Still Alive CD/LP (Nonesuch)\n\nThe follow-up to their acclaimed album Life On Earth – which landed on Best of 2022 lists from the New York Times, Rolling Stone, NPR Music, Mojo, Uncut, among others – The Past Is Still Alive sees Hurray For The Riff Raff reunite with Brad Cook, while further expanding their creative cast of collaborators. Anjimile, Conor Oberst and S. G. Goodman all join Alynda Segarra on vocals at various points throughout the LP, with a band of musicians including Cook, Libby Rodenbough, Matt Douglas, Meg Duffy of Hand Habits, Mike Mogis, Phil Cook and Yan Westerlund. Mike Mogis also mixed the album, and it was mastered by Heba Kadry. The “nature punk” of Life On Earth marked a departure for Hurray For The Riff Raff, as they contemplated surviving and thriving amidst a world in crisis. The Past Is Still Alive brings the focus back inwards, with arrangements that are raw, melodies direct and indelible, and lyrics that are personal yet largely rooted in family and community.\n\nI DONT KNOW HOW BUT THEY FOUND ME – Gloom Division CD/LP (Concord)\n\nI DONT KNOW HOW BUT THEY FOUND ME’s second album Gloom Division is a glimpse into the mind of Dallon Weekes. Produced by Dave Fridmann (Tame Impala, MGMT), the album is the follow-up to iDKHOW’s Razzmatazz (featuring the #1 Alternative Radio single “Leave Me Alone”), and an EP featuring the gold-certified record Choke. The most autobiographical work to date from Weekes (formerly of Panic! At The Disco), Gloom Division leaves listeners with the same sense of euphoric fascination that sparked the album’s creation.\n\nJob For A Cowboy – Moon Healer CD/LP (Metal Blade)\n\nThe iconic extreme experimental death metal lineup of Job For A Cowboy had some long-awaited unfinished business. After nearly nine long years of silence, they have awoken from their slumber, forging Moon Healer, the follow-up to their previous landmark album, Sun Eater. But why the extended wait? “I had to take a step back in the band for family. It was the catalyst that eventually created a fork in the road for all of us. We all drifted into our separate paths,” explains frontman and band co-founder Jonny Davy. “Fatherhood, additional music projects, academic degrees, and careers outside the band took priority and life’s focus,” so the band agreed on a prolonged hiatus, but with the door open for a return. “Everything lined up for us to collaborate on a new project together, it was time to cross the threshold for something new,” states Davy. [Multiple vinyl colorways are available: indie store exclusive magenta; and purple w/ black smoke.]\n\nMGMT – Loss Of Life CD/LP (Mom + Pop)\n\nA joyous return and everything you could want from MGMT. A very “MGMT MGMT album” which the band describes as “a group of songs about love and change, first and foremost.” Descriptors from the band include bold, flavorful, playful, sincere, optimistic, and perceptive. Loss Of Life was produced by MGMT and Patrick Wimberly (Solange, Lil Yachty, MGMT), with mixing and additional production by Dave Fridmann (Flaming Lips, Interpol, Spoon). The album includes the first ever MGMT song with a feature, courtesy of Christine and The Queens. The album artwork has been licensed from John Baldessari’s estate and is an artwork titled Noses And Ears, Etc. (Part Two). [An indie store exclusive translucent blue color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nAdditional Social Media Program Titles:\n\nGracie Abrams and Aaron Dessner – The Good Riddance Acoustic Shows (Live) LP (Interscope)\n\nMagenta colorway. The Good Riddance Acoustic Shows (Live) vinyl LP contains a series of songs performed live by Gracie Abrams and close collaborator Aaron Dessner during their limited run of shows last September. The songs were recorded live at the McKittrick Hotel in New York, Riverside Revival in Nashville, and the Masonic Lodge in Los Angeles.\n\nBoys Like Girls – Sunday At Foxwoods LP (Fearless)\n\nReleased last October on CD – now available on vinyl. Multiplatinum artists Boys Like Girls released their first new studio album in over 10 years with 2023’s Sunday At Foxwoods. The album features the band’s infectious pop-rock sound that created the platinum singles “Two Is Better Than One” (feat. Taylor Swift), “Love Drunk” and “The Great Escape”. Sunday At Foxwoods has all the fun and bouncy hallmarks of their early sound with plenty of modern hooks.\n\nRemo Drive – Mercy LP (Epitaph)\n\nRemo Drive, the longstanding project of brothers Erik and Stephen Paulson, wants you to feel something. Following a six-year run of pristine emo-influenced rock ‘n’ roll records comes Mercy, the band’s fourth album. It’s the band’s most lyric-focused offering to date, a record about reinvention, trusting yourself, and wearing your heart on your sleeve even when it’s painful or vulnerable. Sonically, Mercy is also a major departure for Remo Drive. It’s less indebted to the emo and pop punk that foregrounded the duo’s career and instead invested in thorny, baroque indie pop byway of Father John Misty and Fleet Foxes.\n\nCDs + Vinyl:\n\nAllie X – Girl With No Face CD/LP (Twin Music Inc.)\n\nAllie X’s fourth album, Girl With No Face, is a daring excavation of her identity. A maniacal journey into the mind of an artist who just spent three years in isolation, refusing any input as she became the solitary producer, writer, and creative voice for the first time in her career. Infused with early 80’s British experimentalism, with nods to The Human League and New Order, the album is a strident move away from 2020’s introspective and spare Cape God — so much faster, more threatening. [Two vinyl colorways are available: indie store exclusive mustard yellow; and oxblood.]\n\nAmigo The Devil – Yours Until The War Is Over CD/LP (Liars Club)\n\nThe next chapter of Danny Kiranos, p/k/a Amigo the Devil, continues with Yours Until the War Is Over – his most disarming and singular work to date. The 13-track project weaves themes of relatable self-destruction and trauma bonding with arresting authenticity. Riddled with obscure literary references – akin to Kiranos’ maniac reading habit – the album proves that this whole Amigo The Devil thing isn’t some true crime niche. Yours Until the War Is Over is a songwriter’s record. [An indie store exclusive white/black swirl color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nLiam Bailey – Zero Grace CD/LP (Big Crown)\n\nFollowing the success of 2020’s Ekundayo album, the tried-and-true chemistry of Bailey and producer Leon Michels (El Michels Affair) is on full display again as they take the sound they established and push it further. On Zero Grace they lean more into the bleeding-heart singer-songwriter side of Liam. The result, much like Bailey himself, is impulsively honest without reserve. The title Zero Grace represents his uninhibited energy. He wears his heart on his sleeve, he speaks his mind without filters, and he has little concern for formalities where his ambitions are concerned. [An indie store exclusive sea glass color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nJazmin Bean – Traumatic Livelihood CD/LP (Interscope)\n\nTraumatic Livelihood is the highly anticipated debut album from Jazmin Bean. The non-binary, London-based artist continues their evolution, by inviting listeners into their unparalleled universe of alternative, infectious pop. Traumatic Livelihood is emotionally laden, and explores themes of consent, addiction, and relationships. It pairs otherworldly visuals with music that represents the sound and spirit of Generation Z’s genderless subculture – unapologetic and impossible to define. [A limited-edition clear vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nCan – Live In Paris 1973 CD/2xLP (Mute)\n\nLive In Paris 1973 finds Can in magical form for a performance recorded at L’Olympia in Paris on 12 May 1973, marking the first of the live series to feature Damo Suzuki on vocals. From 1970-73 the core line up of Irmin Schmidt, Jaki Liebezeit, Michael Karoli, and Holger Czukay were joined by Japanese improviser and vocalist Suzuki. They met after a chance encounter while Suzuki was busking in Munich, and several months after the Paris 1973 performance his wanderlust would take him back on the road.\n\nDarkest Hour – Perpetual Terminal CD/LP (MNRK Heavy)\n\nDC’s Darkest Hour combines the passion, energy, and soul of punk/hardcore with the style, speed, vengeance and fury of melodic speed/thrash/death metal. [A limited-edition pink color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nErika de Casier – Still CD/LP (4AD)\n\n33-year-old Danish singer, songwriter and producer Erika de Casier built a cult following with her 2019 debut album Essentials, and emphatically lopped off that “cult” designation with 2021’s Sensational, her first album for 4AD. In the past few years, she’s performed at some of the biggest festivals in the world, written for pop stars (such as New Jeans) and sung on hyped dance tracks. But when she ushers you into the expanses of her third album-with a coy “Welcome… it’s gonna be a lot of fun”- she’s inviting you to leave any crass The Nordics’ Next Big Thing or Rising Alt-Pop Star epithets at the door, next to your shoes and coat. de Casier may have won a lot of new fans in the past three years, and a lot of high-profile collaborators, but as this album’s title confirms, she’s the same old Erika de Casier.\n\nDust Bolt – Sound & Fury CD/LP (AFM)\n\nNew album from the Bavarian thrash metal band. [A limited-edition white w/ black marbled color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nEktomorf – Vivid Black CD/LP (AFM)\n\n14th album by the Hungarian groove metal band. [A limited edition dark red w/ black color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nBill Fahey Group – Tomorrow Tomorrow and Tomorrow CD/2xLP (Dead Oceans)\n\nThe temptation to mythologize Bill Fay can be overwhelming; Fay was, for decades, as prolific as he was under-appreciated. Fay’s unsung-hero status has changed slowly, steadily, on the order of almost twenty-five years. With each new album comes new hosannas and evangelizers – Jeff Tweedy, Kevin Morby, Adam Granduciel and Julia Jacklin, to name just a few. The Bill Fay Group, in particular, is Fay’s most significant collaborative work; he records as a member of a larger group here, and the result summons a grander sonic scale, an elegent counterweight to Fay’s instincts for the understated. Tomorrow Tomorrow and Tomorrow brings to bear the galactic qualities of early rock, the intricacy of jazz improv, and Fay’s earthy folk magic.\n\nAce Frehley – 10,000 Volts CD/LP (MNRK Heavy)\n\n10,000 volts sees Ace perform electrifying, hard-hitting, riff-heavy rock ‘n’ roll and heavy metal. [Multiple color vinyl pressings are available, including indie store exclusive splatter.\n\nGhost Funk Orchestra – A Trip To The Moon CD/LP (Colemine)\n\nComing off the heels of 2022’s A New Kind Of Love, A Trip To The Moon sees GFO diving even deeper in the worlds of film music, exotica, and psychedelic surf rock. The aim is to create a layered and collaged listening experience with more elements than you could possibly pick out in a single listen. The guitars are fuzzy and flooded with spring reverb, and the horns are arranged in a studio big band fashion. It’s full of big compositions with garage rock attitude. Influences range everywhere from Eddie Palmieri and Esquivel to The Lively Ones, Dusty Springfield, and War. The tracks are tied together by real recorded transmissions from the Apollo moon missions. [A limited-edition sea glass w/ black swirl color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nJJ Grey & Mofro – Olustee CD/LP (Alligator)\n\nOlustee is a masterpiece of soul-shaking music. JJ’s deep Southern roots and skill as a storyteller shine through, whether he’s rocking with gospel-tent fervor or slowly winding his raspy voice around a lyric of heartbreak and loss. It’s an aggressively groove-driven record fueled by JJ’s gritty vocals and funk-infused guitar playing.\n\nHaystack – Doomsday Goes Away CD/LP (Threeman Recordings)\n\nDoomsday Goes Away isn’t merely an album; it stands out as a testament to Haystack’s unwavering significance in the power-rock-noise-landscape. Its ten fearless tracks echo a mantra of raw authenticity: “No bullshit, no trends, just honesty, in your face anarchy and hope.” Conceived in a fervent four-day recording sprint, the album showcases the band’s raw spontaneity. Stripped down to its core, recorded live with minimal overdubs, there’s no hiding behind dense production this time. It’s unfiltered, pure Haystack.\n\nHalm – Runner CD/LP (Halm Music)\n\nRunner, the third full length album by Halm, is the result of 15 years of intense touring, a global pandemic and finding themselves in a new context, both personally and musically. Together with producer Johannes Bergenheim and engineer Roger Krieg Halm made a 10-track album of Scandinavian Americana music that flows between acoustic fragility to heavy rock riffs.\n\nHe Who Walks Behind The Rows – They Thought They Were Alone CD/LP (Heptown)\n\nHe Who Walks Behind The Rows continues to write songs based on your favorite scary movies. The album They Thought They Were Alone contains twelve new songs about evil, violence, bloodshed, and death and even though you haven’t seen all of the movies yet; they all serve their purpose once again, to introduce even more people to the glorious world of horror movies. [A limited-edition red color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nHurray For The Riff Raff – The Past Is Still Alive CD/LP (Nonesuch)\n\nThe follow-up to their acclaimed album Life On Earth – which landed on Best of 2022 lists from the New York Times, Rolling Stone, NPR Music, Mojo, Uncut, among others – The Past Is Still Alive sees Hurray For The Riff Raff reunite with Brad Cook, while further expanding their creative cast of collaborators. Anjimile, Conor Oberst and S. G. Goodman all join Alynda Segarra on vocals at various points throughout the LP, with a band of musicians including Cook, Libby Rodenbough, Matt Douglas, Meg Duffy of Hand Habits, Mike Mogis, Phil Cook and Yan Westerlund. Mike Mogis also mixed the album, and it was mastered by Heba Kadry. The “nature punk” of Life On Earth marked a departure for Hurray For The Riff Raff, as they contemplated surviving and thriving amidst a world in crisis. The Past Is Still Alive brings the focus back inwards, with arrangements that are raw, melodies direct and indelible, and lyrics that are personal yet largely rooted in family and community.\n\nI DONT KNOW HOW BUT THEY FOUND ME – Gloom Division CD/LP (Concord)\n\nI DONT KNOW HOW BUT THEY FOUND ME’s second album Gloom Division is a glimpse into the mind of Dallon Weekes. Produced by Dave Fridmann (Tame Impala, MGMT), the album is the follow-up to iDKHOW’s Razzmatazz (featuring the #1 Alternative Radio single “Leave Me Alone”), and an EP featuring the gold-certified record Choke. The most autobiographical work to date from Weekes (formerly of Panic! At The Disco), Gloom Division leaves listeners with the same sense of euphoric fascination that sparked the album’s creation.\n\nIntegrity – All Death Is Mine: Total Domination CD/LP (Relapse)\n\nAll Death Is Mine: Total Domination is a collection of rarities and unreleased tracks from the last seven years of Integrity’s domination. The album includes covers of Ozzy Osbourne, Motörhead, Misfits and more. [A limited-edition gold color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nJob For A Cowboy – Moon Healer CD/LP (Metal Blade)\n\nThe iconic extreme experimental death metal lineup of Job For A Cowboy had some long-awaited unfinished business. After nearly nine long years of silence, they have awoken from their slumber, forging Moon Healer, the follow-up to their previous landmark album, Sun Eater. But why the extended wait? “I had to take a step back in the band for family. It was the catalyst that eventually created a fork in the road for all of us.

[Multiple vinyl colorways are available: indie store exclusive magenta; and purple w/ black smoke.]\n\nMeiko Kaji – Gincho Wataridori [Reissue/1972] CD/LP (Wewantsounds)\n\nMeiko Kaji’s debut album features the song “Gincho Wataridori” a theme song for the eponymous gangster film released by Toei Films in 1972 (and known outside of Japan as “Wandering Ginza Butterfly”). On the cover of the album, Meiko wears the kimono she wears in the film. The song showcases Kaji’s distinctive singing over a funky backbeat and fuzz guitar. The first of a series of five LPs produced for Teichiku between 1972 and 1974, Gincho Wataridori marks the beginning of Meiko Kaji’s fruitful career as a recording artist and is a unique testament of her singing talent.\n\nKirlian Camera – Radio Signals For The Dying 2xCD/2xLP (Dependent)\n\nKirlian Camera is an ever churning maelstrom of creativity and musical innovation. Their inspirational power is both destructive when it comes to limitations of genre, style, and conventions as well as constructive for example regarding building a new sonic architecture on the ruins of the old. The Italians latest masterpiece, Radio Signals For The Dying, is no exception as a new artistic high-watermark. [A translucent red color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nLe Sserafi – 3rd Mini Album ‘EASY’ Balmy Flex CD (Source Music)\n\nLe Sserafi – 3rd Mini Album ‘EASY’ (Compact Ver.) CD (Source Music)\n\nLe Sserafi – 3rd Mini Album ‘EASY’ Featherly Lotus CD (Source Music)\n\nLe Sserafi – 3rd Mini Album ‘EASY’ Sheer Myrrh CD (Source Music)\n\nNew mini album from the K-Pop group – available in an array of collectable versions.\n\nCorb Lund – El Viejo CD/LP (New West)\n\n“I’ve been wanting to make a record like this for a long time. The band, Franny and I produced it ourselves in my living room with no adults present. It’s all acoustic, not an electric lick on the album… banjos and mandos and string basses and stripped-down drums. I put a ton of work into the tunes and I’m pretty proud of this batch. Had a little help from my old co-writing pal Jaida Dreyer on a couple, also wrote a good one with my screenwriter buddy, Brian Koppelman. Lots of gambling songs and lots of minor keys. And my band guys absolutely killed it too, they’re all badasses. I’m dedicating the record to my old compadre, Ian Tyson, who passed away a few months back. I’ve named the album for him as well. ‘El Viejo’, or ‘the old one’ is what our mutual friend Tom Russell took to calling him in later years. The title track is a special one for us. We had a blast making this thing, and we hope you enjoy it too.” [Two indie store exclusive versions are available: autographed CD and limited-edition autographed clear w/ black & white splatter.]\n\nMelissa Manchester – Re:view CD (Green Hill)\n\nThis milestone release features iconic collaborations, including new versions of “Whenever I Call You Friend” with Kenny Loggins and “Midnight Blue” with Dolly Parton. Guest artists Gerald Albright and Dave Koz join the symphony of nostalgia and innovation. Immerse yourself in this musical journey where five decades of brilliance converge in a star-studded celebration.\n\nMick Mars – The Other Side Of Mars CD/LP (1313 LLC)\n\nWhen Mick Mars stepped back from touring with Mötley Crüe – the band he co-founded more than 40 years ago – following their massive summer 2022 stadium tour, it seemed like the end of an era. Really, it was the beginning of a new one. The legendary guitarist, whose riffs, solos and overall, devastatingly heavy sound powered the L.A. icons through four decades of world-conquering, multi-platinum sonic mayhem is, as he demonstrates on his debut solo effort, still a serious force to be reckoned with. Only now, listeners are reckoning with more Mars than ever before. On the aptly-titled The Other Side Of Mars, fans get that vision in it’s full, multifarious glory.\n\nMGMT – Loss Of Life CD/LP (Mom + Pop)\n\nA joyous return and everything you could want from MGMT. A very “MGMT MGMT album” which the band describes as “a group of songs about love and change, first and foremost.” Descriptors from the band include: bold, flavorful, playful, sincere, optimistic, anf perceptive. Loss Of Life was produced by MGMT and Patrick Wimberly (Solange, Lil Yachty, MGMT), with mixing and additional production by Dave Fridmann (Flaming Lips, Interpol, Spoon). The album includes the first ever MGMT song with a feature, courtesy of Christine and The Queens. The album artwork has been licensed from John Baldessari’s estate and is an artwork titled Noses And Ears, Etc. (Part Two). [An indie store exclusive translucent blue color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nModern English – 1 2 3 4 CD/LP (Inkind Music)\n\nModern English’s new album, 1 2 3 4 – produced by Mario McNulty (David Bowie, Lou Reed, Nine Inch Nails), mixed by Cenzo Townsend, and mastered at Abbey Road – retains the intrinsic spirit of these early, post-punk days and is also a sterling sonic example of what Modern English have always done best. The album encompasses seething songs with punk bite (“Long in The Tooth”, “Plastic”), keyboard-forward melodic rockers (“Not Fake”, “Crazy Lovers”) and simmering, darkwave-meets-post-punk gems (“Exploding”, “Out To Lunch”).\n\nMotörhead – The Löst Tapes – The Collection (Vol. 1-5) 8xCD (BMG)\n\nNow collating all five volumes in the series in this 8xCD Box Set, you can relive Motörhead live and loud from the UK and Europe with rare, riotous sets and 97 tracks spanning the decades from: The Löst Tapes Vol 1: Live At Sala Aqualung, Madrid 1st June 1995 (2xCD) / The Löst Tapes Vol 2: Live At University Of East Anglia Norwich, 18th October 1998 (2xCD) / The Löst Tapes Vol 3: Live At KB Hallen, Malmö 17th November 2000 (2CD) / The Löst Tapes Vol 4: Live At Sporthalle, Heilbronn, 29th December 1984 (1xCD) / The Löst Tapes Vol 5: Live At Donington, Download Festival 13th June 2008 (1xCD). [The Lost Tapes Vol 5 (Live At Donnington 2008) is available this week on yellow color vinyl.]\n\nLevy O’Donel – Simba [Reissue/1974] CD/LP (Mr Bongo)\n\nBaltimore-born, Levy was already well regarded as one of the best up-and-coming jazz guitarists at the time of Simba‘s release. Having toured with George Benson and Jimmy McGriff, as well as featuring on McGriff’s Black Pearl album on Blue Note, he went on to sign with Sonny Lester’s Groove Merchant. A masterclass in tight yet effortlessly funk-driven rhythms, the tracks showcase these musicians at their zenith.\n\nPlantoid – Terrapath CD/LP (Bella Union)\n\nThe cover art for Plantoid’s debut album, the jazzy, prog-rock opus Terrapath, is a desolate, misty landscape, where a massive half-vegetable, half-machine structure resembling a spaceship looms above figures shrouded in shadow. It’s weird and eerie, but it also ignites a feeling of wonder and nostalgia, like cracking open your favorite sci-fi novel as a kid. Musically, Plantoid’s cauldron harnesses multiple subgenres at once to concoct a sort of primordial soup, the molecules of which are built as much from progressive rock as they are jazz, fusion, folk, and even a bit of ’70s hard rock for good measure.\n\nReal Estate – Daniel CD/LP+MP3 (Domino)\n\nReal Estate’s sixth full-length album Daniel was recorded in an ebullient nine-day spree at RCA Studio A, in Nashville with Grammy-winning producer and songwriter Daniel Tashian (Kacey Musgraves). In 11 compulsively tuneful songs, they connect the uninhibited wonder of their earliest work with the earned perspective of adulthood. Several days into recording, all five members of Real Estate were discussing album titles when someone suggested “Daniel,” simply because it seemed funny to bestow a human name upon a record. Was it for Daniel Tashian? Maybe. Was it a nod to The Replacements’ Tim? Possibly. Was it the sign of a band that has now been around long enough to take its music seriously without taking itself or its perception too seriously? Absolutely. [An indie store excusive silver color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nRevival Season – Golden Age Of Self Snitching CD/LP (Heavenly)\n\nForeseen by oracles and foretold by angels, the coming together of rapper Brandon “BEZ” (B Easy) Evans and beatmaker/producer Jonah Swilley was, by their own admission, a divine appointment. Both halves musically and spiritually forged in the twin flames of Georgia’s Pentecostal churches and grassroots hip-hop scene, Revival Season tell straight-shooting tales of our golden age – chop, cops, badass bitches, self-snitches, drug-dealing, and revolution – chronicling and critiquing the culture over baselines and beats that kick squarely in the teeth with a platform boot.\n\nLaetitia Sadier – Rooting For Love CD/LP (Drag City)\n\nLaetitia issues a call to the traumatized civilizations of Earth: we’re urged to finally evolve past our countless millennia of suffering and alienation. Her songs score the complexities and harmonies within this directive: organ, guitar, bass, synth, trombone, vibraphone, live and programmed drums, and a vocal assembly of men and women billed as The Choir, working intricate chord/tempo/and dynamic changes, as Laetitia’s empathic presence leads the way.\n\nPhilip Sayce – The Wolves Are Coming CD/LP (Forty Below)\n\nThe Wolves Are Coming is powerful, unique, and brash. Signature fuzz tones and sledgehammer mountain-sized drum grooves with delicate, intimate, and dynamic performances. “These songs and stories came into focus during my darkest times. The Wolves Are Coming represents a bridge – a connection between despair and hope – that invites broken spirits to be transformed and healed.” – Philip Sayce.\n\nSlade – Live At The New Victoria CD/LP (BMG)\n\nSlade – Til Deaf Do Us Part [Reissue/1981] CD/LP (BMG)\n\nSlade’s Live At The New Victoria is the powerful live performance taken from their London show in April 1975. The setlist features the hits “How Does It Feel”, “Gudbuy T’Jane”, “Far Far Away”, “Mama Weer All Crazee Now”, as well as longtime stage favorite “Just A Little Bit”. Following the success of 1981’s We’ll Bring The House Down Slade continued their new found resurgence with Till Deaf Do Us Part. The album features the single “Lock Up Your Daughters” as well as other tracks that were to become staples of the Slade live set over the years including “Rock and Roll Preacher” (which became the band’s new opener) as well as “Ruby Red” and “Knuckle Sandwich Nancy”.\n\nSleepytime Gorilla Museum – of the Last Human Being CD/2xLP (Joyful Noise)\n\nAfter thirteen years of hibernation, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, the most gloriously uncategorizable American band in existence, has emerged from stasis with their fourth studio album of the Last Human Being. The group has consistently evaded easy categorization, garnering accolades from across the aisles of contemporary classical music, prog rock, industrial music, metal, avant-garde improv, and more.

I’ve not been scared of it because it’s not my story. It’s a shared one.” The Nottingham-based songwriter and producer’s life was upended in February 2021, months before the release of his debut album, Wake, when his brother-in-law was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. What followed was the most “unbelievable” year of togetherness when life seemed set on fracturing the life of a young man.

The Dead Weather’s sophomore effort Sea Of Cowards is as feral and unrelenting as their debut. Released in May 2010, the lead-off track “Blue Blood Blues” would become one of the band’s most loved songs. Sea Of Cowards is noteworthy for being the first record in history to contain songs hidden underneath the center labels of the disc.\n\nOlivia Dean – Messy LP (Island)\n\nUK soul-pop star Olivia Dean’s long-awaited debut album Messy features the singles “Danger” and “UFO”.

The album features 16 tracks, a deeply personal and powerful work that explores themes of fearlessness, Black resilience, beauty in darkness and unity over a thrilling mix of hip-hop, soul, dub, psych and beyond. Several years in the making, Erick crafted it in his Los Angeles home studio, and it features several longtime collaborators and new friends: Joey Bada$$, Westside Boogie, George Clinton, Channel Tres, Kimbra, Lalah Hathaway, RÜDE CÅT, Boy Boy, Pale Jay and FARR. Also known as the main producer and founding member of influential Brooklyn rap group Flatbush Zombies, Erick worked with several producers including several tracks with celebrated electronic musician James Blake.

These songs, recorded 1977-1985, are different from anything previously released by the artist. Rich with the sound of birds outside the window, the creak of the piano bench, the thump of Emahoy’s finger on the record button, they create a sense of place, of being near the artist while she records. Emahoy dreamt of releasing this music to a larger audience before her passing in March of 2023.\n\nF***cked Up – The Chemistry Of Common Life [Reissue/2008] 2xLP (Matador)\n\n15th anniversary orange colorway. F***ed Up’s now classic album The Chemistry Of Common Life synthesizes numerous diverse impulses into an expansive epic about the mysteries of birth, death, and the origins of life (and re-living). Merging elements of hardcore songwriting with up to 70 tracks of guitars, organs, winds, and vocals, (including 18 guitars on the first single, the fatalistic “No Epiphany”), the music remains iconoclastic and startling, with Pink Eyes’ vocals front and center. Guest musicians, of course, abound, notably gorgeous voices such as Brooklyn’s Vivian Girls and Toronto’s Katie Stelmanis.\n\nStan Getz – Previously Unreleased Recordings [Reissue/1974] LP (Verve)\n\nStan Getz and Bill Evans are about as close as musicians can get in terms of artistry, musical philosophy, and technique. These sessions, recorded in 1963 with drummer Elvin Jones and bassists Ron Carter (Side A) and Richard Davis (Side B), perfectly blend their strong individual styles and collaborative sensibilities, with both artists at the peak of their creative powers.\n\nGhost – Ghost [Reissue/1990] LP (Drag City)\n\nGhost – The Second Time Around [Reissue/1992] LP (Drag City)\n\nGhost – Temple Stone [Reissue/1994] LP (Drag City)\n\nColor vinyl reissues of the Japanese experimental rock and improvisation group’s first three albums. Formed in 1984, Ghost burgeoned slowly, blowing open the gate in 1990 with their eponymous debut. Opening with a vast spirit-plosion – shards of antique light and clouds of centuries-old, dust-laden airs escaping from a primeval tomb – they settle into the deep feeling. A variety of mostly acoustic instruments aids their projection of traditional sounds from space and time, troubadours of unknown, an enigma of eternal trippiness all about them.\n\nDebbie Gibson – Electric Youth [Reissue/1989] LP (Friday Music)\n\nRed colorway. Electric Youth is the second studio album by singer-songwriter Debbie Gibson, originally released in 1989.\n\nAstrid Gilberto – Look To The Rainbow [Reissue/1966] LP (Verve)\n\n1966’s Look To The Rainbow is one of the jewels of Astrud Gilberto’s catalog and of the bossa nova canon. Teaming with arranger Gil Evans and producer Creed Taylor, the orchestral backing perfectly complements Astrud’s whispery, understated voice, especially on the title track and the sweet ballad, “I Will Wait For You”.\n\nGlitterer – Rationale LP (ANTI-)\n\nOffering fuzzy grunge-pop with doses of shimmering synths and emo angst, Ned Russin co-fronted Title Fight before halting in 2018 and Ned began playing music as Glitterer. Now a full band, Glitterer returns with Rationale, combining ‘90s grunge, capital-R riffs a la The Stooges, and a keyboard lead that gives self-deprecating melodrama.\n\nGuava – Out Of Nowhere LP (Guava Noise)\n\nGuava is the moniker for Bradley Hutchings, a British producer, composer, multi-instrument performer and DJ based in Berlin.

LP (ZZK)\n\n“My music is a landscape for you to enter your own journey,” sings Luiza Lian’s crystalline voice after the ceasing of a sonic collage that blends a lament on the keyboard, church bells, hummed vocals, distorted speeches, syncopated beats, and a striking bass line. “Minha Música” (My Music) is our first encounter with 7 Estrelas – Quem Arrancou O Ceu? (7 Stars Who Ripped The Sky Down?), the fourth album of the São Paulo-based artist, and her third collaboration with French/Brazilian music producer Charles Tixier. Nearly five years after the celebrated Azul Moderno, the duo returns to the scene they materialized before a period of darkness that rewrote Brazil’s history.\n\nLil Wayne – I Am Music 2xLP (Young Money)\n\nTranclucent ruby red colorway.

I wanted to reimagine a couple of those songs more stripped down as a follow up to that first EP. Judee Sill’s songwriting and arrangements have impacted me deeply, and so I hoped to honor the music she made by recording a version of her song, “Emerald River Dance” – one of my favorite songs for many years and a song I still sing at most of my shows. The first time I heard “Black Is The Color” was Tia Blake’s version that she recorded in 1971, and then Nina Simone’s performance inspired me to try and record a rendition of my own. While writing “On My Way” and “The City”, I always imagined versions of those songs stripped down with three-part harmonies, which I was finally able to do here with dear friends, Cécile McLorin Salvant and Kate Davis, who have both been big inspirations to me throughout the years. [A limited-edition crystal-clear pressing is available.]\n\nMotörhead – The Lost Tapes Vol 5 (Live At Donnington 2008) 2xLP (BMG)\n\nYellow colorway.

Following a six-year run of pristine emo-influenced rock ‘n’ roll records comes Mercy, the band’s fourth album. It’s the band’s most lyric-focused offering to date, a record about reinvention, trusting yourself, and wearing your heart on your sleeve even when it’s painful or vulnerable. Sonically, Mercy is also a major departure for Remo Drive. It’s less indebted to the emo and pop punk that foregrounded the duo’s career and instead invested in thorny, baroque indie pop by way of Father John Misty and Fleet Foxes.\n\nStan Rogers – Songs Of A Lifetime 5xLP (Borealis)\n\nIt is testament to Stan Rogers’ impact as a songwriter that 40 years after his sudden tragic death at the young age of 33 – people young and old are still singing his songs and celebrating his influence.

The pride of their town since 1922, the band represented a fast-disappearing musical tradition when these recordings were originally released in 1975. Their unique sound derived from an unusual combination of instruments, a repertoire including pieces dating from more than fifty years before the recordings were made to more recent ones, and above all from the highland Maya style of their playing, which is characterized by a preference for freer rhythmic structures and a wider variety of pitches than Western scales allow.\n\nSee You Next Tuesday – Distraction LP (Good Fight Music)\n\nLimited-edition translucent pink colorway. “It is more or less about looking back at your life and basically being in mourning for the moments of your life that you’ll never get to relive as you are ultimately aging, slowly moving towards your own death alone and becoming less and less relevant to the world. I struggle heavily with the idea of death and growing old and fixate on it a lot which I express a few times on this album. At times I am devastated by remembering and realizing the moments I should have cherished more at the time that they were happening. And then I get back to reality where I’m there by myself and separated by years from that moment.”\n\nSam Shure – Regency 12” (Habitat)\n\nSam Shure drops the Regency EP – a DJ favorite embraced by Mind Against. The title track, “Regency”, pulsates with relentless beats, while “Heir Of Snare” explores rhythmic depths. “Magnus” climaxes with melody and cutting-edge sound design. Shure’s EP resonates with innovation and emotion, an electrifying journey for the dancefloor.\n\nMartin Simson’s Destroyer of Death – Eternal Reign LP (Jono)\n\nNow available on vinyl Classic, melodic metal.\n\nSnuts – Millennials LP (Snuts Partnership)\n\nThe Snuts present Millennials: a sharp, snarling 10-track run of firecrackers. From start to finish, top to bottom, Millennials has been made entirely to The Snuts’ script. The result: a tight, taut, fat-free masterclass in songwriting and production. The Snuts have three albums under their belts, songs that attack subjects affecting the youth of today, and an arsenal of adoring fans up and down the country. As these four lads from Whitburn, West Lothian vowed four years ago, The Snuts wanted to be risky. And with Millennials, The Snuts have followed through on that promise. [An indie store exclusive 180gm yellow colorway is available.]\n\nKeith Sweat – Make It Last Forever [Reissue/1987] LP (Elektra)\n\nLimited dice game color vinyl pressing. Make It Last Forever is the debut album by R&B artist Keith Sweat, originally released in 1987. The album went to number one on the Top R&B Albums chart for three weeks (and topped the Billboard Year-End R&B chart for 1988), and number 15 on the Billboard 200.\n\nSerj Tankian – Elect The Dead [Reissue/2007] LP (RHR Cat)\n\nSerj Tankian – Harakiri [Reissue/2012] LP (RHR Cat)\n\nNew colorways (gray and translucent red, respectively) of the debut and third solo albums by the System Of A Down frontman.\n\nTeethe – Teethe [Reissue/2020] LP/LP+7” (Winspear)\n\nTeethe – Tag b/w Lucky 7” (Winspear)\n\nTeethe is a band from Texas. The members of Teethe met while attending the University of North Texas in Denton, TX, a small college town outside of Dallas with a fertile music scene. Recorded over the course of 2020, Teethe’s eponymous debut album is a collection of songs pieced together over time – a sonic collage of fragmented recordings and half-finished tracks made whole during isolation. Initially self-released in November of 2020 with little fanfare, the album’s warm, lo-fi aesthetic and slow, calming songs spread by word of mouth. [An indie store exclusive green colorway including the “Tag” b/w “Lucky 7” is available.]\n\nThou – Blessings Of The Highest Order LP (Sacred Bones)\n\nBlessings Of The Highest Order compiles all of Thou’s Nirvana covers, originally recorded and released piecemeal on various EPs, splits, and tributes from 2009 – 2018.

The record features artwork by New Orleans’ underground, BDSM, xerox freakaleek Trashboy. [A limited-edition white colorway is available.]\n\nThe Trashmen – The Best Of The Trashmen LP (Sundazed Music)\n\nWhite colorway. The Trashmen’s defining moment, 1963’s “Surfin’ Bird,” is perhaps the ultimate lightning-in-a-bottle record. Their first true studio recording, it captures the group’s interminable energy and mastery of live performance. But it also is the culmination of spirit and experiment that turned it into something new and, from the perspective of 50 years, unique. This collection shows them to be variously a first-rate surf band, a great protopunk outfit, solid rockers with the raw essence of the earliest originators of the sound, and adept enough to work in some comedy and country.\n\nTV On The Radio – Dear Science [Reissue/2008] LP (Touch & Go)\n\n180gm white colorway. TV On The Radio’s story is one of synchronicity, of serendipity, of epiphany. TVOTR began with Tunde Adebimpe (vocals) and David Sitek (multi-instrumentalist and production kingpin) being roommates, drinking way too much coffee, making art: comics, movies, paintings. They started trading tapes of each other’s four track recordings and thought it’d be fun to try to make “a real record” out of all that stuff. The band’s third studio album released in 2008, Dear Science, opened with vintage TVOTR, but the nostalgia does not last. With Dear Science, the band continued to push the limit with sonic experiments that fill out the rest of the album.\n\nVan Halen – Live: Right Here, Right Now [Reissue/1993] 4xLP (Rhino)\n\nVan Halen’s first live album – 1993’s double-platinum Live: Right Here, Right Now – now available on 180gm black vinyl. Recorded in May 1992 as the band was wrapping up their massive world tour in the support of their classic, triple-platinum album For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge, the collection finds singer Sammy Hagar, guitarist Eddie Van Halen, drummer Alex Van Halen, and bassist Michael Anthony firing on all cylinders and delivering over two hours of Van Halen’s signature hits.\n\nThe Veldt – Illuminated 1989 LP (Little Cloud)\n\nThis is the original 1989 full-length record produced by Cocteau Twins’ Robin Guthrie, previewed by the lead track “The Everlasting Gobstopper” and the single “Aurora Borealis” with Elizabeth Fraser making a cameo appearance on backing vocals towards the end, plus a B-side remix, created by The Veldt. Guthrie also remastered the album for vinyl earlier this year. While originally intended to be the band’s first album, their label Capitol Records shelved the recording and sent them back into the studio with producer Lincoln Fong (Moose), resulting in their first album being released with the title Marigolds.\n\nElla Washington – Ella Washington [Reissue/1969] LP (On High)\n\nElla Washington was born and raised in Miami, FL where she still makes her home as a pastor. Her family background wasn’t a particularly musical one, although one of her sisters was Audrey Royal who recorded briefly for Spector International in the ‘70s. Like so many singers of her generation Ella started her career singing in local clubs and it was at one of those, the Birdland, where she encountered two of Miami’s greatest soulmen, Clarence Reid and Paul Kelly. Under their helpful guidance Ella began her path as a recording artist.\n\nThe Waterboys – This Is The Sea [Reissue/1985] LP (Chyrsalis)\n\nThis Is The Sea is the third album by The Waterboys. Released in September 1985 and includes the classic single, “The Whole Of The Moon”, along with other tracks, “Don’t Bang The Drum”, “The Pan Within” and “Old England”.

More hip selections include: “Stolen Moments”, “Pensativa”, “Impressions”, and the bonus track: Lee Morgan’s “The Sidewinder”.

Wynonna is the debut solo studio album by Wynonna Judd, originally released in 1992. Before the release of Wynonna, she recorded alongside her mother, Naomi, as The Judds, a duo which charted more than 20 country singles in the 1980s and early 1990s until hepatitis forced Naomi to retire. Tell Me Why is the second solo studio album by Wynonna, originally released in 1993. Features the hit singles “Only Love”, “Is It Over Yet”, “Rock Bottom”, “Girls With Guitars”, and the title track, all top ten hits on the Billboard country music charts.\n\nNeil Young & Crazy Horse – Dume 2xLP (Reprise)\n\nDume is a 16-song album by Neil Young with Crazy Horse from 1975, recorded during the Zuma recording sessions.

[An indie store exclusive version w/ litho is available.]\n\nCassette:\n\nGhost Funk Orchestra – A Trip To The Moon (Colemine)\n\nComing off the heels of 2022’s A New Kind Of Love, A Trip To The Moon sees GFO diving even deeper in the worlds of film music, exotica, and psychedelic surf rock. The aim is to create a layered and collaged listening experience with more elements than you could possibly pick out in a single listen. The guitars are fuzzy and flooded with spring reverb, and the horns are arranged in a studio big band fashion. It’s full of big compositions with garage rock attitude. Influences range everywhere from Eddie Palmieri and Esquivel to The Lively Ones, Dusty Springfield, and War. The tracks are tied together by real recorded transmissions from the Apollo moon missions."
