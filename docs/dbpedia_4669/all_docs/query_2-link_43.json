Haircut 100% Live! Hammersmith Odeon Spring 1982 is an in-concert album that highlights the group at the summit of their powers  high speed funk, to-die for pop and sweet melodies against the backdrop of Haircutmania. No overdubs and the high-octane energy of youth. The group moved from being London underground darlings to chart sensations in less than six months, and within a year had disappeared into pops ether, leaving behind one memorable album and four Top 10 UK singles, but many have said that the real way to experience the power of the Haircuts was to see them play live.\n\nPressed on zinging translucent red vinyl, Haircut 100% Live! Hammersmith Odeon Spring 1982 is an absolute must for all fans of frenetic funky fabulous melodic pop.

This hand-numbered (limited edition worldwide of 3000), double LP set was transferred from the original tape reels and is pressed on 180g vinyl and boasts 100 minutes of music, The gatefold sleeve includes an extensive booklet with essays by esteemed jazz journalist Ted Panken and jazz video journalist and friend of Bishop's, Bret Primack, rare photos by Don Schlitten, Raymod Ross and Jan Persson, and poetry pieces written by Bishop. The set is produced by label owner/musician Cory Weeds and \"Jazz Detective\" producer Zev Feldman.\n\nThe double LP set consists of two shows recorded in Baltimore, Maryland, LP 1 recorded at The Madison Club on August 28, 1966 and LP 2 at The Famous Ballroom on February 26, 1967.\n\nHarlem-born Bishop began his performing and recording career as part of Art Blakeys Jazz Messengers on his debut Blue Note album in 1948. His bebop style continued on with gigs and recordings with Kenny Dorham, Jimmy Heath, Milt Jackson, Stan Getz, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Oscar Pettiford, Wynton Kelly and many others. In the 1960s he fronted a trio with Jimmy Garrison and G.T. Hogan. He recorded for various independent labels including Jazztime, Black Jazz and Muse Records.\n\nThe 8-track set cooks with two Miles Davis compositions along with standards such as Willow Weep for Me, Antonio Carlos Jobims Quiet Nights and Henry Mancinis The Days of Wine and Roses.\"\n\nSide A (25:10)\n\n1) My Secret Love (12:47)\n\n2) Blues (12:23)\n\nSide B (24:39)\n\n1) Days of Wine & Rose (14:55)\n\n2) Quiet Nights (10:10)\n\nSide C (25:06)\n\n1) If I Were A Bell (11:00)\n\n2) So What (13:45)\n\nSide D (24:54)\n\n1) Willow Weep For Me (11:46)\n\n2) Pfrancing (No Blues) (13:02)\n\nQueen Talk: Live at the Left Bank is an official, never-before-released concert recording from one of the greatest female jazz organists of all-time, Shirley Scott, featuring a powerhouse trio with George Coleman on tenor saxophone and Bobby Durham on drums, plus special guest vocalist Ernie Andrews on three tracks. This hand-numbered, limited edition (3000 worldwide), double LP set was transferred from the original tape reels and is pressed on 180g vinyl. It features 100 minutes of music and is packaged in a gatefold sleeve with an extensive booklet with liner notes by acclaimed music writer A. Scott Galloway, rare photos by Don Schlitten and Raymond Ross, and memorabilia from the Left Bank archives plus interviews with jazz organ icon Joey DeFrancesco, former Shirley Scott bandmate, saxophonist Tim Warfield, and pianist Monty reminiscing about drummer Bobby Durham. The set is co-produced by label owner/musician Cory Weeds and renowned archival recording producer Zev Feldman.\n\nThe show was recorded at the Famous Ballroom in Baltimore Maryland on August 20, 1972 and hasn't ever been previously available. Philadelphia-born Scott rose to fame in the late 1950s playing the Hammond B-3 organ influenced by blues and gospel evolving into '60s soul jazz. She recorded numerous albums for Prestige, Impulse!, Atlantic, Cadet and Candid performing with countless jazz legends including Stanley Turrentine, Oliver Nelson, Eddie \"Lockjaw\" Davis, Clark Terry and Kenny Burrell.\n\nThe 10-track set cooks on songs of the day like \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix,\" \"You Don't Mess Around With Jim,\" and \"Never Can Say Goodbye,\" along with standards such as \"Smile,\" \"Witchcraft\" and John Coltrane's \"Impressions.\"\n\nSide A (23:23)\n\n1) Impressions\n\n2) Never Can Say Goodbye\n\nSide B (24:39)\n\n1) Like Someone In Love\n\n2) Witchcraft\n\nSide C (25:06)\n\n1) Blues By Five (6:36)\n\n2) By The Time I Get To Phoenix (9:08)\n\n3) Smile (9:22)\n\nSide D (24:54)\n\n1) You Dont Mess Around With Jim (8:12)\n\n2) Girl Talk (8:38)\n\n3) Blues (Unknown) (8:08)\n\nHarry Whitaker is a piano player, producer and arranger who at the age of 26 recorded Black Renaissance \"Body, Mind, and Spirit,\" a holy grail amongst collectors of soul-jazz and rare groove, and an album so rare it's virtually a myth to many.\n\nMade up of two long tracks that periodically build and release for forty minutes over two sides of an LP it's an improvised masterpiece combining Afrocentric spiritual soul, jazz, poetry, amazing solos, a tasty bass line or two and more than a fair share of funky beats. It's also one of the earliest jazz albums to feature rapping. \"I called the project Black Renaissance because that is what I wanted to see happen - especially in music. I describe it as Dixieland circa 1976 - by the end of the songs everyone is playing together.\"\n\nGiven its rarity, when asked if he was surprised that people knew about the album Whitaker jokes \"I've told enough people about it over the years! Now they can actually hear it. It was a record before it's time. It's not a commercial release - I think of it as classical. You can call it jazz, but it's free, it's got African roots, it's for people who people who dig that sound.\"\n\nHarry Whitaker has enjoyed a successful career as a producer, arranger and composer, cutting his teeth on the best of the Roy Ayers Ubiquity releases and making a living working closely with Roberta Flack - as her musical director, even playing on her big Eugene McDaniels' written hit \"I Feel Like Makin' Love.\" Black Renaissance \"Body, Mind, and Spirit,\" was his first attempt at a project where he wrote and composed the music and played keys on both tracks.\n\nOriginally released in 1977 and highly considered as one of the grail titles in the Spiritual Jazz, Jazz-Funk canon. Reissued by Luv N'Haight in 2002 with a limited pressing. This repress on black vinyl will be exclusive to RSD.\n\nA1) Black Renaissance B1) Magic Ritual\n\nA 2xLP set of rare, early Hüsker Dü live recordings, featuring original flyers and artwork. Drawn from the historical Hüsker Dü recording archives compiled by Terry Katzman, this double disc live set is an essential companion piece to the band's Savage Young Du Box Set. While the SYD release principally featured studio demos, the 28 tracks presented here are the aural and enchanting equivalent of a time machine that vividly thrusts the listener straight back to Husker Du's embryonic unsheathing on stage.\n\nSide A dates to July 1979. Side B gives us a full year's evolution to July 1980, while Sides C and D land the listener in September 1980. Perhaps 120 people in total saw these three Longhorn performances. Until now, a handful at most have heard the playbacks. So, rare and fresh, it's all here: the songs, the driven performances, the small club intimacy of being in front of select friends, fans, and peers, with one fair shot at getting it right. These four sides compellingly document that you can't doubt that they did.\n\nSide A - July 6. 1979 20:56\n\n1 Insects Rule The World (Hart) (BMG Bumblebee BMI)\n\n2 Im Not Interested (Hart) (BMG Bumblebee BMI)\n\n3 Sex Dolls (Hart) (BMG Bumblebee BMI)\n\n4 Cant See You Anymore (Mould) (Granary Music BMI)\n\n5 Sexual Economics (Mould) (Granary Music BMI)\n\n6 Do You Remember?

There was always music around my house, but as a teenager, I started digging deeper and deeper in to the blues records in my Dad's collection. That was when I started to get the Fred Davis story in fits and starts. Fred could play like T-Bone Walker and sang in a high, keen voice like J.B. Lenoir, he said. He used to front a jump band in Kansas City, before something went down that sent him to prison at Leavenworth. In the summer of 1967, he ended up working alongside my Dad at Harco, the Cleveland factory where my grandfather was an executive. They became friends, bonding over the B.B. King and Bobby Bland records blaring from the AM radio on the factory floor.\n\nFred taught my Dad the rudiments of blues guitar, but his style. Instead of barring with his first finger, he wrapped his thumb around the back of the neck. That left his other fingers free to create big, ringing voicings that imitated the Kansas City horn sections he heard in his youth. Fred could play up and down the neck and, even when he played and sang just by himself, he sounded like a full band. Or, at least, so the legend went. These were only foggy memories from thirty years previous, passed down from a father to a son.\n\nBut then we found the tape. A quarter inch reel in a plain white cardboard box, hiding on a shelf in the attic. My Dad explained how it came to exist: He found some friends (acquaintances really) who had a band and some equipment. They setup in my grandparents living room where the upright piano was, and he invited Fred over to record some of his songs with the band backing him up. Invited him over, to play loud music, in his bosss living room. Sounds like something I would have done. The idea was that maybe if there were some recordings of Fred that he could use them to get booked on the nascent college blues-revival circuit, but it wasnt to be.\n\nWe found a place nearby that could dub the tape and put it on a CD for us. When we finally got the transfer back, the legend became real. Fred really COULD sing like J.B. Lenoir and play like T-Bone Walker. He really DID have his own style. And that style had now been passed on to me. Without even realizing it, I had learned to play like Fred Davis. Even now, when I sit down to play the guitar or write a song and I wrap my thumb around the neck, Im playing like he did. With this music now professionally transferred and remastered, I can only hope that Fred Davis can finally receive the acclaim that he deserves; that he never received in his lifetime. The legend can finally go behind the confines of my living room and, with any luck, to the whole world.\"\n\n-- Eli Paperboy Reed, fall 2022\n\nWine Hop, Drifting Blues, Express Train, Midnight Is Falling, Piano Boogie, Time When You Say You Love Me, Midnight Is Falling, Euclid Ave., Five Long Years, Wine Hop, Tell Me Pretty Baby\n\nIn 2017, DIIV took the stage at Brooklyns Murmrr Theatre for a special, on-off, unplugged performance. Now, the band shares a compilation of those live recordings. Includes unique arrangements of tracks from the bands first two albums - Oshin and Is The Is Are - as well as covers of Alex Gs Hollow and My Bloody Valentines When You Sleep.\n\nFollowing the digital release in November 2022, the compilation is now available on vinyl for the first and only time, pressed on Eco vinyl - exclusive to Record Store Day 2023.\n\nIn August 2017 I was 5 months sober and DIIV hadnt played a show in almost a year. Our friend Ric helped us set up an intimate acoustic show in a theater in our hometown of brooklyn. We decorated the stage with stuff from our houses and played our home videos on a tv. We invited our friends and family and played some songs from our first two albums and some other artists songs that felt important to us as a band. It felt like some kind of reset. We recorded the show and forgot about it for a bunch of years. We recently found the recordings and thought people might want to hear them. I think of it as a kind of official bootleg I guess. Our friend Jarvis mixed it and our friends Parker and Jim made the art. enjoy.  Zachary Cole Smith\n\n1. Druun 2..Past Lives 3. Human 4. When You Sleep (MBV cover) 5. Dopamine 6.
