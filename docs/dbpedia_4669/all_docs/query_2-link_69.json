        "text": "Dear listeners,\n\nWhen an artist you’re curious about but unfamiliar with has an extensive back catalog, it can be difficult to know where to start. Sometimes a trusted guide is needed. And when people learn I’m a fan of the Mountain Goats — the wildly prolific, verbose and cult-beloved group led by the singer-songwriter-novelist John Darnielle — I am sometimes called upon to be that guide. I’ve made multiple “introduction to the Mountain Goats” mixes and playlists for friends over the years, and today I’ve made one for you.\n\nThe occasion is the band’s new album — its 22nd! — “Jenny From Thebes,” which is a kind of sequel to the great 2002 Mountain Goats album “All Hail West Texas.” “Jenny From Thebes” is a rich and rewarding listen, but for the uninitiated it would be a strange place to start. Which is why I am here to initiate you into the world of one of the greatest American songwriters currently working.\n\nDarnielle started the Mountain Goats in the early 1990s as a solo project; he would record most songs (often directly onto a Panasonic boombox) right after he’d written them, which gave early Mountain Goats albums a sense of rough-hewed urgency. Beginning with the 2002 release “Tallahassee” — a song cycle about a doomed married couple — he began making more polished studio recordings with other producers and filled the Goats out into a full band. The current lineup includes the longtime bassist Peter Hughes, the drummer and frequent “Best Show With Tom Scharpling” guest Jon Wurster and the multi-instrumentalist Matt Douglas.\n\nDarnielle’s writing strikes a difficult balance between weightiness and levity. Some of his songs are about incredibly heavy topics — abuse, addiction, spirituality — but there’s a wit, a precision and a humanity to his voice that makes his music cathartic rather than depressing. That sensibility has translated into a particularly fervent and still expanding base of fans, who do things like make elaborate podcasts called “I Only Listen to the Mountain Goats.”\n\nThe Mountain Goats are something of an acquired taste: They’re earnest and wordy, and Darnielle’s vocals strike some people as too … well, goatlike*. There are people in my life who have given them a fair chance and decided they’re just not for them. Fine. But I also have several decades-long friendships in which a mutual love of the Mountain Goats is a major component. My dear pal Matt first introduced the band to me almost 20 years ago (!) when he played me “Going to Georgia” while we were driving aimlessly around the New Jersey suburbs, and the world seemed to stand still. All these years later, we’re still going to shows, trading rarities and debating the merits of each new release. They’re just that kind of band.\n\nListen along on Spotify as you read.\n\n1. “Jenny”\n\nSome of the best Mountain Goats songs — like this one, from “All Hail West Texas” — seem like they’re trying to slow time and preserve an ecstatic moment as precisely as possible (“Our house faced west,” Darnielle specifies here, “so the big orange sun positioned at your back lit up your magnificent silhouette”). This song introduces the motorcyclist Jenny, for whom the Mountain Goats’ new album is named. (Listen on YouTube)\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
