        "text": "Craft Recordings is delighted to announce its line-up of titles for Record Store Day 2022, taking place on Saturday, April 23rd at participating independent retailers. Showcasing the depth and breadth of Craft’s catalog, this year’s ten exclusive releases span a spectrum of genres—from classic jazz and Latin-flavored psychedelia to foundational emo and ’90s hip-hop.\n\nPEANUTS fans will be excited to collect the first-ever 7-inch pressing of “Baseball Theme,” from the Vince Guaraldi Trio’s Jazz Impressions of a Boy Named Charlie Brown. Meanwhile, Nitro Records’ ’90s punk sampler, Go Ahead Punk…Make My Day, debuts on vinyl. Craft is also offering an array of vinyl reissues from artists like Commander Venus (featuring a teenage Conor Oberst of Bright Eyes), the Brand New Heavies (with rhymes by Gang Starr, the Pharcyde, Kool G. Rap, among others), Collective Soul, Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers, Art Pepper, and Esther Marrow, plus a Fania Records psych-rock rarity from Flash & the Dynamics. Additionally, the latest edition of Jazz Dispensary will take listeners on a soulful and meditative journey, with tracks from Cannonball Adderley, Houston Person, Catalyst, the Bar-Kays, and more.\n\nNow in its 15th year, Record Store Day champions the culture of the independent record store, offering music lovers the chance to pick up exclusive releases and support their favorite record store at the same time. Details on individual titles are below. For a full list of participating Record Store Day retailers, visitrecordstoreday.com.\n\nFlash & the Dynamics — The New York Sound (1-LP; 180-Gram Purple Vinyl)\n\nMuch has been documented about the pioneering music that came out of the United States in the ’60s and ’70s, amid the social and political strife of the era. But the scene wasn’t just about the Summer of Love or Woodstock. There was another movement happening in the Latin neighborhoods of New York City, as cultural barriers loosened. Beginning in the mid-’60s, musicians were filling the clubs with an irresistible combination of soul, R&B, and Afro-Cuban dance rhythms. By the turn of the decade, U.S. Latin music had evolved, often integrating socially conscious lyricism (in both English and Spanish), rock and funk influences, and a heavy dose of psychedelia.\n\nThat sound is captured in Flash & the Dynamics’ The New York Sound—a 1971 rarity from the Fania Records vaults. The album—which marks the band’s sole title—blends traditional Latin melodies with distorted guitars, soulful psychedelia, and funky rhythms. Listeners will be transported to another era with jams like “Everybody’s Got Soul,” “Guajira Sicodélica,” and the trippy instrumental “Electric Latin Soul.”\n\nReturning to vinyl for the first time in decades, The New York Sound features all-analog remastering by Kevin Gray at Cohearent Audio. Limited to 3,350 units worldwide, this special edition has been pressed on 180-gram purple vinyl at RTI for an optimal listening experience.\n\nThe New York Sound tracklist:\n\nSide A\n\nGuajira Sicodélica\n\nElectric Latin Soul\n\nYo Te Quiero\n\nNena\n\nEl Son de la Loma\n\nSide B\n\nChangó\n\nCampesino\n\nEverybody’s Got Soul\n\nBorinquen\n\nSanta Isabel de las Lajas\n\nVarious Artists — Jazz Dispensary: Super Skunk (1-LP; Opaque Red Vinyl)\n\nThe highly coveted Jazz Dispensary series is back with Super Skunk: a brand-new blend that’s hard on the drums and horns…and easy on the ears. Featuring tracks by Cannonball Adderley, the Bar-Kays, and Gary Bartz, among others, Super Skunk will take listeners on the ultimate groove trip—zigzagging between hard-bop soul jams and rhythmic meditations.\n\nSide A opens with Gary Bartz’s supremely funky “Make Me Feel Better,” a cut off the saxophonist and singer’s 1973 Mizell Brothers produced LP, The Shadow Do! Cannonball Adderley continues the vibe with 1974’s “Pyramid,” while the Bar-Kays luxuriate in a 1978 cover of Traffic’s “Feelin’ Alright.”Closing out the first side is “The Houston Express,” a 1971 soul-jazz delicacy from Houston Person, followed by Art Jerry Miller’s chilled-out instrumental, “Finger Lickin’ Good.”\n\nPhiladelphia fusion pioneers Catalyst pick up the pace on Side B with “Ain’t It the Truth,” an upbeat selection from their 1970 self-titled debut, while Woody Herman delivers a fantastic cover of Herbie Hancock’s “Fat Mama.” The set continues with “Las Cuatro Culturas” by Mexico’s Rabbits & Carrots. The high-energy instrumental is culled from the group’s 1970 LP, Soul Latino, a sought-after rarity among funk fanatics and crate diggers. The album closes with the hard-grooving “You’ve Got to Do Your Best,” from the Pazant Brothers & the Beaufort Express’s 1975 LP, Loose and Juicy.\n\nLimited to 5,800 units worldwide, Super Skunk is pressed on eye-catching opaque red vinyl and housed in a jacket designed by the GRAMMY®-winning art director, Masaki Koike, with original illustrations by Humberto Howard.\n\nJazz Dispensary: Super Skunk tracklist:\n\nSide A\n\nGary Bartz – Make Me Feel Better\n\nThe Cannonball Adderley Quintet – Pyramid\n\nThe Bar-Kays – Feelin’ Alright\n\nHouston Person – The Houston Express\n\nArt Jerry Miller – Finger Lickin’ Good\n\nSide B\n\n1. Catalyst – New-Found Truths\n\nWoody Herman – Fat Mama\n\nRabbits & Carrots – Las Cuatro Culturas\n\nThe Pazant Brothers & The Beaufort Express – You’ve Got to Do Your Best\n\nVarious Artists — Go Ahead Punk… Make My Day (1-LP; Orange Splatter Vinyl)\n\nAny ’90s punk fan will surely remember coveting a copy of Go Ahead Punk… Make My Day—a classic sampler CD from Nitro Records. Originally released in 1996, the album delivered early cuts from some of the biggest names in West Coast punk, including AFI, the Offspring, and the Vandals.\n\nEstablished just two years earlier, Nitro Records became one of Southern California’s premier independent labels, as well as an incubator for the era’s rising punk acts. Founded by the Offspring’s Dexter Hollandand Greg K. Nitro, the label not only signed up-and-coming stars like AFI, A Wilhelm Scream, and Rufio, but was also home to such venerable acts as the Vandals, T.S.O.L., and the Damned. Over the next few years, Nitro showcased their talented roster through a series of popular compilations, beginning with Go Ahead Punk… Make My Day.\n\nAvailable for the very first time on vinyl, Go Ahead Punk… Make My Day features ten high-energy tracks from AFI, Guttermouth, Jughead’s Revenge, the Vandals, and the Offspring, including the latter band’s cover of “Hey Joe”—a long-sought-after fan favorite, which was previously exclusive to this compilation. Pressed on orange splatter vinyl, this collectible edition is limited to 7,250 units worldwide.\n\nGo Ahead Punk… Make My Day tracklist:\n\nSide A\n\nGuttermouth – God’s Kingdom\n\nThe Vandals – Marry Me\n\nAFI – He Who Laughs Last…\n\nJughead’s Revenge – Tearing Down the World\n\nThe Offspring – Hey Joe\n\nSide B\n\nThe Vandals – Let the Bad Times Roll\n\nJughead’s Revenge – The People’s Pal\n\nGuttermouth – Derek\n\nAFI – Wake-Up Call\n\nThe Offspring – Beheaded\n\nThe Brand New Heavies — Heavy Rhyme Experience: Vol. 1 (1-LP; Orange Vinyl)\n\nWhen British funk/acid jazz combo the Brand New Heavies arrived in New York for their first U.S. show, they were joined on stage by rappers Q-Tip and MC Serch—much to the surprise and delight of their fans. That memorable show inspired the concept for their sophomore album, which paired the band with some of hip-hop’s most talented rising stars.\n\nLong ahead of its time, 1992’s Heavy Rhyme Experience: Vol. 1 featured airtight rhymes by the likes of Gang Starr (“It’s Gettin’ Hectic”), the Pharcyde (“Soul Flower”), Kool G. Rap (“Death Threat”), and Masta Ace Incorporated (“Wake Me When I’m Dead”), all underscored by the Brand New Heavies’ live, laid-back grooves. The album felt like a late-night jam session—experimental, spontaneous, and utterly cool.\n\nWhile acts like the Roots would eventually popularize live instrumentation, Heavy Rhyme Experience: Vol. 1 was innovative in the world of hip-hop, which typically relied on sampling. In a 2017 retrospective, Albumism hailed Heavy Rhyme Experience: Vol. 1 as “Visionary…. The [album’s] bold and ultimately genius formula…forever changed the game.” AllMusic.com, meanwhile, called it a “landmark collaborative experiment,” adding, “Never before had rap taken such an on-the-fly, jam-like approach.”\n\nA must-have for any hip-hop fan’s record collection, Heavy Rhyme Experience: Vol. 1 now returns to vinyl after more than a decade. Limited to 3,800 units (available in the U.S. and Canada), this 30th-anniversary edition of the album is pressed on orange vinyl.\n\nHeavy Rhyme Experience: Vol. 1 tracklist:\n\nSide A\n\nBonafide Funk (Feat. Main Source)\n\nIt’s Gettin’ Hectic (Feat. Gang Starr)\n\nWho Makes the Loot? (Feat. Grand Puba)\n\nWake Me When I’m Dead (Feat. Masta Ace Incorporated)\n\nJump N’ Move (Feat. Jamalski)\n\nSide B\n\nDeath Threat (Feat. Kool G. Rap)\n\nState of Yo (Feat. Black Sheep)\n\nDo Whatta I Gotta Do (Feat. Ed O.G.)\n\nWhatgabouthat (Feat. Tiger)\n\nSoul Flower (Feat. The Pharcyde)\n\nCommander Venus — The Uneventful Vacation (1-LP; Red-and-Black-Smoke Vinyl)\n\nNot long before recording his first songs for Bright Eyes, 14-year-old singer-songwriter Conor Oberstco-founded Commander Venus alongside bassist (and future Cursive frontman) Tim Kasher, guitarist Robb Nansel (now president of Saddle Creek Records), and drummer Matt Bowen (who would soon join the Faint and be replaced by Ben Armstrong). After releasing their 1995 debut, Do You Feel at Home?, the Omaha indie rockers caught the attention of Wind-up Records, who backed the group’s sophomore album, The Uneventful Vacation.\n\nRecorded in August 1996 at Hoboken’s Water Music, The Uneventful Vacation found the talented young musicians full of raw energy and emotion. Featuring songs like the angular “Jean’s T.V.,” the anthemic “Lock n’ Chase,” and the breakneck “Dressed to Please,” the album garnered critical acclaim and plenty of spins on college radio. While The Uneventful Vacation marked the musicians’ final record together, before they each embarked on their next ventures, this formative album has since become a cult favorite in the ’90s emo canon.\n\nTo celebrate the 25th-anniversary of The Uneventful Vacation, this special pressing features red-and-black-smoke vinyl and all-analog mastering from the original tapes by Kevin Gray at Cohearent Audio. Limited to 4,600 units worldwide, this edition also includes the bonus track “Congratulations!,” which appeared on the original vinyl release.\n\nThe Uneventful Vacation tracklist:\n\nSide A\n\nJean’s T.V.\n\nRefused by Light\n\nWe’ll Always Have Paris\n\nThe Uneventful Vacation\n\nLock N’ Chase\n\nLife as Expected\n\nSide B\n\nThe Way Things Had to Be\n\nDress to Please\n\nThe Walk-Around Problem\n\nMy Collapsing Frame\n\nThe Raining Holiday\n\nThe Role of the Hero in Antiquity\n\nCongratulations!\n\nVince Guaraldi Trio — Baseball Theme (7-Inch Single; White Vinyl)\n\nIn 1964, Bay Area jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi was tapped by producer Lee Mendelson to score a 60-minute documentary about PEANUTS creator Charles M. Schulz. Although the film never aired, Guaraldi’s evocative soundtrack was released by Fantasy Records as Jazz Impressions of a Boy Named Charlie Brown, while several of the artist’s cues (including the instantly recognizable “Linus and Lucy”) appeared a year later in the enduring TV special, A Charlie Brown Christmas.\n\nOne particularly memorable selection is “Baseball Theme,” a cue that was intended for a sequence devoted to Charlie Brown’s ill-fated efforts on the ball field. Accompanied by bassist Monty Budwig and drummer Colin Bailey, Guaraldi deftly leads his trio through the up-tempo instrumental track.\n\nAvailable as a 7-inch single for the very first time, “Baseball Theme” comes pressed on white vinyl and is limited to 4,600 units worldwide. This collectible release includes the original, 1964 soundtrack version of the song, plus an alternative studio take that was previously unavailable on vinyl. The jacket, meanwhile, features whimsical, baseball-themed images of Charlie Brown and Snoopy.\n\nBaseball Theme tracklist:\n\nSide A\n\nBaseball Theme\n\nSide B\n\nBaseball Theme (Alternate Take)\n\nArt Pepper — Art Pepper Meets the Rhythm Section (Mono Edition) (1-LP; 180-Gram Vinyl)\n\nAccording to jazz lore, on the morning of January 19, 1957, the esteemed alto saxophonist Art Pepper woke up to learn that he was booked for a session, just hours later, with Miles Davis’ highly respected rhythm section (pianist Red Garland, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Philly Joe Jones). Despite feeling utterly unprepared, Pepper gave the performance of a lifetime. The resulting album, Art Pepper Meets the Rhythm Section, stands as a landmark title in his extensive catalog and is a testament to all of the musicians’ incredible talents. The all-star quartet sounds effortless, performing Pepper originals (“Straight Life,” “Red Pepper Blues,” and “Waltz Me Blues”) as well as pop and jazz standards, including Dizzy Gillespie’s “Birks’ Works” and Cole Porter’s “You’d Be So Nice to Come Home To.”\n\nProduced by Contemporary Records’ Lester Koenig and recorded by engineer Roy DuNann, Art Pepper Meets the Rhythm Section has been praised as “a diamond of recorded jazz history” by AllMusic.com, while The Penguin Jazz Guide called the session “a masterpiece…a poetic, burning date, with all four men playing above themselves.”\n\nLimited to 8,600 units worldwide, this special mono edition of Art Pepper Meets the Rhythm Section features all-analog mastering from the original mono tapes by Bernie Grundman and is pressed on 180-gram vinyl at QRP. Released in partnership with Acoustic Sounds, this release celebrates 70 years of the venerable West Coast jazz record label.\n\nArt Pepper Meets the Rhythm Section tracklist:\n\nSide A\n\nYou’d Be So Nice to Come Home To\n\nRed Pepper Blues\n\nImagination\n\nWaltz Me Blues\n\nStraight Life\n\nSide B\n\nJazz Me Blues\n\nTin Tin Deo\n\nStar Eyes\n\nBirks’ Works\n\nCollective Soul — Disciplined Breakdown (1-LP; Translucent Red Vinyl)\n\nIn 1994, Southern alt-rockers Collective Soul became one of the biggest bands in the country with the release of their breakthrough self-titled album. Not long after, however, they would find themselves in a messy legal battle with their former manager. That difficult breakup is documented in their 1997 follow-up, Disciplined Breakdown.\n\nWritten and produced by frontman Ed Roland, Disciplined Breakdown was recorded in a cabin in Stockbridge, GA, where the band channeled their emotions into a cohesive collection of catchy, post-grunge tunes. While the process helped the group overcome a challenging time, it also resulted in a best-selling album. Released in March 1997, Disciplined Breakdown landed in the Billboard 200 Top 20 and earned a platinum certification from the RIAA.\n\nAdditionally, the LP spawned several popular singles, including the anthemic “Precious Declaration,”which topped Billboard’s Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and peaked at No.5 on the Canadian pop charts. The mid-tempo rocker “Listen” followed suit, also becoming a No.1 Mainstream Rock hit. Other highlights include the dynamic third single, “Blame,” and the soulful “Full Circle,” which features a cameo from the legendary Memphis Horns.\n\nLimited to 7,400 units worldwide, this 25th-anniversary edition of Disciplined Breakdown is pressed on translucent red vinyl and features newly-remastered audio by the GRAMMY® Award-winning engineer Paul Blakemore and lacquers cut by Kevin Gray at Cohearent Audio.\n\nDisciplined Breakdown tracklist:\n\nSide A\n\nPrecious Declaration\n\nListen\n\nMaybe\n\nFull Circle\n\nBlame\n\nDisciplined Breakdown\n\nSide B\n\nForgiveness\n\nLink\n\nGiving\n\nIn Between\n\nCrowded Head\n\nEverything\n\nEsther Marrow – Sister Woman (1-LP; 180-Gram Vinyl; Tip-On Jacket)\n\nLegendary jazz, soul, and gospel singer Esther Marrow (also known as Queen Esther Marrow) has enjoyed a long and storied career—one that has taken her to Broadway, Hollywood, the Vatican, and the White House. Rising to fame in the sixties, Marrow performed with Duke Ellington during his Sacred Concert world tour and was a powerful voice in the Civil Rights Movement, joining Dr. Martin Luther King at his World Crusade rallies. In between high-profile stage and screen appearances, the singer also recorded several albums, including 1972’s Sister Woman.\n\nA long-overlooked gem from the Fantasy Records vaults, Sister Woman finds Marrow incorporating socially conscious lyricism with a blend of jazz, gospel, and R&B influences. Backed by an all-star line-up of musicians—including drummer Bernard Purdie, guitarist Cornell Dupree, and bassist Chuck Rainey—the singer delivers funky renditions of “The Ghetto” (first recorded by the Staple Singers in 1968) and Laura Nyro’s “When I Die” (made famous several years earlier by Blood, Sweat & Tears). The singer’s sophomore effort also features a supremely soulful performance of the popular ’70s ballad, “Trade Winds.”\n\nBack on vinyl for the first time since 1972, Sister Woman features all-analog mastering from the original tapes by Kevin Gray at Cohearant Audio. Housed in a tip-on jacket, and limited to 3,350 units worldwide, the album is pressed on 180-gram vinyl at RTI for the highest-quality listening experience.\n\nSister Woman tracklist:\n\nSide A\n\nWoman in the Window\n\nGhetto\n\nTrade Winds\n\nTurn on to Jesus\n\nSide B\n\nRainy Night in Georgia\n\nThings Ain’t Right\n\nAsk Me to Dance\n\nAnd When I Die\n\nJonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers — Modern Lovers 88 (1-LP; “Hot Nights Sky Blue” Vinyl)\n\nHailed for his authentic storytelling and candid observations about life, Jonathan Richman holds a unique place in modern musical history. Richman first emerged in the early ’70s as the quirky frontman of the Boston proto-punk group, the Modern Lovers. Heavily influenced by the Velvet Underground, the band built a cult following and recorded a widely acclaimed self-titled LP before disbanding in 1974. Over the next decade, Richman re-assembled several iterations of the band (under the moniker Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers) and moved away from the harder, electric sounds of his earlier days.\n\nHis final album with the group, 1987’s Modern Lovers 88, features a trio setting (with drummer John Avila and guitarist Brennan Totten) and finds Richman fully embracing the lo-fi aesthetic that he would come to be known for as a solo artist. Delivering a surprisingly lush sound, the musicians perform an upbeat selection of playful, acoustic tunes, including “I Love Hot Nights,” “African Lady,” and “Gail Loves Me.” A favorite title in Richman’s lengthy catalog, Modern Lovers 88 has been praised by AllMusic as “Quite rocking, with heavy debts to doo-wop and Bo Diddley rhythms, and a jolly (though not sappy) summertime campfire feel.”\n\nLimited to 7,000 units worldwide, this 35th-anniversary edition of Modern Lovers 88 features all-analog mastering from the original tapes by Kevin Gray at Cohearent Audio and is pressed on“Hot Nights Sky Blue”-colored vinyl.\n\nModern Lovers 88 tracklist:\n\nSide A\n\nDancin’ Late at Night\n\nWhen Harpo Played His Harp\n\nGail Loves Me\n\nNew Kind of Neighborhood\n\nAfrican Lady\n\nSide B"
