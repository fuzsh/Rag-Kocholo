        "text": "The Rance Allen Group\n\nComprised of brothers Tom, Steve and Rance Allen (occasionally featuring brother Esau on congas), the Rance Allen Group was discovered by Gospel Truth president Dave Clark and producer Toby Jackson at a Detroit talent show. Hailing from nearby Monroe, Michigan, the group wasted no time introducing their crossover gospel sensibilities with their eponymous debut album in 1972.\n\nRight from the album’s first track, an upbeat take on the traditional “Up Above My Head,” to the standout “Just My Salvation,” a sanctified rework of the Temptation’s “Just My Imagination,” the group makes very little qualms when juxtaposing their spiritual foundation with their secular influences. On the latter, by turning the popular soul stylings of Motown on its head, the group offers a subversive and defiant take on seminal Detroit soul. And in a somewhat opportunistic manner, make way for its lead singer Rance to draw direct comparison to already monolithic vocalists synonymous with the area, such as David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks.\n\nDexterous and dynamic in his vocal approach, Rance, plays guitar and piano on the record, while also arranging the entirety of its eight tracks. The album was originally engineered by Richard Becker at his Pac 3 Recording Company in Dearborn, Michigan, before being re-mixed by Stax’s William Brown.\n\nAT CALVARY\n\n“Assisted by the Fenkell Avenue Baptist Church Congregation & Choir” might seem like an odd addendum for Reverend Lee Jackson’s 1971 release “At Calvary,” as congregations aren’t often billed as performers on records. But the stray, echoing hums of churchgoers, calling out in testimony in concert with Jackson during this sermon, render mention of the members of the church necessary.\n\nPulling from Luke 23:33, Jackson ruminates on the significance of Calvary, the very place outside of Jerusalem where Jesus Christ was crucified. In short, punchy phrases, repeated like the hook of a song, Jackson uses the refrain, “At Calvary” to define sense of place, giving credence to the idea that the essence of a moment can be captured in where it takes place. It’s an apropos message for a sermon that is so intrinsically informed by where it was delivered and the people who were around to witness.\n\nIN CONCERT\n\nOriginally recorded in 1969 and released the following year on the Volt label as “Hello Sunshine,” Reverend Maceo Woods’ “In Concert” highlights the talents of Woods’ Christian Tabernacle Concert Choir. Woods founded the Christian Tabernacle Baptist Church in 1960 in his native Chicago with just 14 members. It’d soon grow to 2,000 members, and Woods would gain prominence as both singer and organist.\n\nThe optimistic title track “Hello Sunshine” interpolates Wilson Pickett’s 1968 song of the same name, written by saxophonist King Curtis and Ronald Miller. The mainstream-leaning appeal of the song was in line with Woods’ philosophy for joining the Stax Records’ family: to reach ears that otherwise would not have been in tune with the catalogs of traditional gospel labels. “The Gospel Truth label is an answer to my prayers,” he stated in a press release for the label. “I feel that gospel and other religious-oriented music have a rich reservoir of talent which has been left to deteriorate or to be corralled only in the church. This talent needs exposure.”\n\nJesus People\n\nBefore it was released on Gospel Truth, “Jesus People” was released by Volt as “Step to Jesus” in 1971, named for its opening and title track. The song “Step to Jesus” is led by vocalist Melvin Smothers and written by Christian Tabernacle Baptist Church Minister of Music George Jordan. Jordan’s original writing fills the majority of the album’s first half, save for his choral arrangement of Diana Ross’ 1970 hit “Reach Out and Touch (Somebody’s Hand).” On it, Smothers returns for a resoundingly uplifting solo and the Christian Tabernacle Concert Choir provides steady accompaniment.\n\nIt’s Woods’ own writing, however, that would accentuate the album’s latter half. On his “Thinking of His Goodness,” soloist Pearl McCombs melds traditional gospel with a nod to piano blues. And with “One Is Missing,” Woods calls to his congregation to minister to their neighbors absent from worship and appeals to potential believers to make their own personal step toward salvation in Christ.\n\nGod's Newspaper\n\nAnchored by its titular sermon, “God’s Newspaper” is a showcase of Detroit’s Greater Mt. Carmel Baptist Church. Recorded in the church’s sanctuary, the album includes a sermon by then-pastor Reverend J.D. Montgomery, as well as selections by the Greater Mt. Carmel Choir. Dropping the listener right into the excitement of Sunday service, the album opens with an energetic rendition of the traditional praise and worship song “Jesus,” arranged by Gospel Truth label head and Detroit native David Clark.\n\nVocalist Joyce Clark leads the choir on the first track, before being joined by Pat Chambers for a spellbinding performance of “It’s Getting Late in the Evening.” Accentuated by its wailing vocal arrangement and embellished by the chilling organ of Lloyd Harris, “It’s Getting Late in the Evening,” serves as a solemn transition into Montgomery’s interpretation of Isaiah 34:16, in which the prophet advises, “Seek ye out of the book of The Lord, and read.” Bringing the sermon to life, Stax Creative Director Larry Shaw visualized Montgomery’s analogy of the Holy Bible as good news for believers by depicting Montgomery on a periodical page that includes articles from Genesis and the Book of Revelations.\n\nGod Save Your People\n\nSettling officially into the Gospel Truth label, Reverend Maceo Woods and his Christian Tabernacle Concert Choir performed their first proprietary release on the label, “God Save Your People,” in 1972. The album’s opening selection picks up where Woods and the group’s previous LP left off, evangelizing to wayward souls with the cadence of “The Magnificient Sanctuary Band (Marching for the Man).” The group’s frequent male soloist Melvin Smothers sings an enthusiastic lead, encouraging all who can hear to drop everything and make a joyful noise about God’s grace. But the gleeful vocal is nearly overshadowed by the military-inspired taps of percussionist Billy Carson.\n\nGospel Truth director Dave Clark regarded Woods and his choir as the “greatest exponents of the true music that has its roots from black music,” promising that the album would include a style of music that had been recently “accepted around the world as the music of today.” While perhaps hyperbolic in nature, the statement frames the label’s intention to make Woods an ambassador for gospel as more than music for the sanctified, giving it context as a genre that carries within it the building blocks of all black music forms and branding it with the label’s own idea of “truth.”\n\nWoods, who had previously paid medical school tuition with money he made from playing the organ, steps back as an instrumentalist during the duration of the album. The album’s closer, an instrumental organ rendition of “His Eye Is on the Sparrow,” performed by Woods, stands as the only exception. With an undeniable range, Woods’ finale stands as a testament to his talent on the instrument, conveying deep, harrowing, sincere conversation with the listener and God, even without words.\n\nMessage For Today\n\nIn a miraculous instance of cross-promotion, Detroit’s the Howard Lemon Singers nod to Stax star Luther Ingram’s 1972 single “To the Other Man.” Both versions of the song, along with a rendition by the Rance Allen Group in the same year, stand in the lineage of Stax’s signature “message music,” in which social awareness set to song took the place of straight-on gospel tunes.\n\nLemon plays host to an impressive cast of soon-to-be highly regarded stalwarts in Detroit’s gospel music scene and churches throughout the U.S. The sessions, recorded at neighboring Warren, Michigan’s Pampa Studios, feature Rance Allen on guitar, Thomas Whitfield on organ and early soprano vocal work from Esther Smith, who’d break out as a viable solo talent in the 1980s.\n\nDeferring to William Garrett as the dominant male voice, Lemon conducts, arranges, produces and writes the better part of an album in which a stunning array of male and female voices take precedent in the absence of any discernable instrumental flourishes. Lemon’s metered, measured approach to arranging bore a sonic resemblance to the secular soul of ensembles such as the Soul Children, holding up a mirror to a familiar sound within Stax’s larger stable of artists.\n\nTruth Is Where It's At\n\nPhotographer Maldwin Hamlin depicted Rance, Steve and Thomas Allen in an apropos trance of introspection on “Truth Is Where It’s At.” On the front cover, the group looks low, staring into their own reflections within the muck of the water underneath a lonely bridge. On the album’s back cover, they stand atop a ledge, looking to the sky. With Rance at arguably the most lucid juncture in the family band’s early career, playing guitar, piano and displaying absolutely astonishing vocal elasticity, it’s of little to no consequence that the album is split down the middle between original material and cover songs. Rance Allen has never seen a song he couldn’t make his own.\n\nTake, for instance, “There's Gonna Be a Showdown,” a clever retooling of a 1968 rhythm and blues single by Archie Bell & the Drells. Though the formerly released version is far from lacking in the realm of energy, the tumbling, tambourine-accented exuberance of the Allen brothers’ take on the song is drenched in a spirit that borders on the impractical.\n\nThe almost alien qualities of Allen’s tonal gymnastics never really slide back down to Earth, but the album’s subject matter does manage to shift, at times, away from the heavenly. On “See What You’ve Done,” the brothers sing of the plight of a mother whose child perishes as a casualty of the Vietnam War, before singing an ode to their own mother on the aptly titled “Mama.”\n\nReverend Bernard Avant & The St. James Gospel Choir\n\nDirected by Southern California–based minister and radio show host Rev. Willie Bernard Avant, Jr., the St. James Gospel Choir’s sound isn’t far removed from the sound of gospel in the American South. Likely a holdover from Avant’s upbringing in Pierce County, Georgia, as well as his years studying in Florida at Bethune-Cookman College and Florida A&M University. It was at the latter institution where he met his soon-to-be wife, Dolly, who is granted a frequent spotlight as a soloist on the St. James Gospel Choir’s album.\n\nThe quintessence of Avant’s work appears on selections such as “God Really Cares for You,” a song he wrote, arranged, sang lead and played piano on. Commanding the choir while stepping out to share his gifted voice, he strikes a chord of confidence, not only in himself, but in faith.\n\nA Tribute To Mahalia Jackson\n\nIn a time when the gospel world was reckoning with the 1972 passing of gospel titan Mahalia Jackson, Detroit singer Louise McCord leaned into her legacy. Accompanied by the Rance Allen Brothers in engineer Richard Becker’s Pac-Three Studios, McCord, in actuality, broke away from the conventions of Jackson’s more traditional gospel. She opts instead to charge forth toward a deeper, funkier path, most glaring on the album’s single “Better Get a Move On,” written by Stax staff writer Bettye Crutcher.\n\nSteve Allen’s bass makes the heartbeat of the song’s groove, Rance’s guitar licks adorn it with flair and McCord’s mezzo-soprano reaches an atmosphere adjacent to rock and roll singers of the day. Though it’s at home in this collection, the song’s potential to move both souls and bodies is realized even further during McCord’s performance at the 1972 concert at the Los Angeles Coliseum that would become Stax’s “Wattstax” documentary. And McCord’s liveliness in both the studio and on that particular stage, awakens the song’s essence, reinforcing the song’s message of immediacy in the face of mortality.\n\nWalk With Me\n\nA sharp departure from the black traditional gospel and soul-infused message music of Gospel Truth’s catalog, the Commanders’ 1972 release “Walk With Me” promises a very different type of “Old-Time Religion.” This quintet of white voices raised their joyful noise from the rolling hills of Birmingham, Alabama, a state mired by the imagery of fire hoses, police attack dogs and race-related unrest, as the wounds of the Civil Rights Era only recently began the process of healing.\n\nHowever, it would be in Neal Hemphill’s Sounds of Birmingham recording studio where soul man Frederick Knight would record 1972’s “I’ve Been Lonely for So Long,” scoring a hit record for Stax. And the optimism for collaboration between the two companies would continue with the Commanders, a group which included Neal’s brother, Bob Hemphill, on bass guitar and baritone vocals. That wasn\n\n’t the only familiar link in the studio, either. The album’s sound largely revolves around Marvin Logan’s vocal solos and his wife Flay Logan’s consistency on piano. Beginning with the solemn devotion of songwriter Al Langdon’s “Walk With Me,” the album is an early testament to the ambitious scope of Gospel Truth, a label unafraid to cross cultural barriers to deliver quality product.\n\nThis Too Is Gospel\n\nThe opening measures of “Are You Ready,” track one of the Marion Gaines Singers’ “This Too Is Gospel,” are a manifesto for a group vying to be unchained. What begins as a bar of metered, tame gospel, breaks away ever so slightly as guitarist Rance Allen teases the listener with the tickle of his strings. By the time the accompanying quartet of singers joins in, the natural order has tipped back into balance, and the gospel is back as the listener should expect. But moments like these, in little pockets, peak out throughout the record, which bore a title that suggests the old guard of gospel music was headed in a radical direction.\n\nFormed in Detroit in 1966 and consisting of Katie Mitchell, Shirley Johnson, Robert Waters and Marion Gaines, the Marion Gaines Singers had previously recorded releases on Minit and King Records by the time they landed on Gospel Truth. Though they were far from buttoned up by gospel standards on their previous outings, the group made obvious strides to announce a new era for their musicianship on “This Too Is Gospel.” Here, they revisit “I’ve Been Talked About,” the title track of their 1969 debut album, adopting a funkier, groovier tone, assisted by the heavy bass of Steve Allen. And while making room for traditional tunes such as “Oh, Mary Don’t You Weep,” the group also saves space for Rance Allen to flex a bit on the wah-wah pedal, for an understated, yet brave, infusion of hard rock.\n\nSongs Our Father Used To Sing\n\nThe process behind concept record “Songs Our Father Used to Sing” included a great deal of fanfare. On its face, the album is based on a humble enough premise: siblings Charles May and Annette May Thomas pay a loving tribute to their father, legendary gospel singer Brother Joe May, known affectionately in the gospel world as the “Thunderbolt of the Middle West.” But the album, ambitious in its sound, indulges even further into the grandiose in almost every aspect of its creation.\n\nBoth Charles and Annette come into the album, each with their fair share of recent fortunes in entertainment. Charles had just traveled abroad with a rock-gospel outfit and had placed songs in television and film. In a similar vein, Annette’s singing made its way into the film “Class of ’74.” The album’s supporting cast was star-studded, too. Engineer Andrew Berliner was already an established presence in the Los Angeles recording community, and background parts were dispersed between well-known gospel artists Edna Wright, Rueben Franklin and Oma Drake, among others.\n\nAs the album’s title insists, the sibling duo interpret a six-minute medley of songs their father made famous. The rest of the album, though, finds Charles May at the helm, arranging, producing and writing tracks such as “Satisfied,” a minimalist, conga-driven track that, removed from its sanctified subject matter, could fit right at home in the score of a Blaxploitation film. Gospel Truth director Dave Clark fittingly defined the album as a deliberate mixture of gospel and soul, assuring to listeners, “You will hear the messages that today’s crusaders for Christ are sending to the youth of the world.”\n\nWhatever Happened To Love\n\n“Whatever Happened to Love” has the remarkable distinction of being the only Gospel Truth recording to originate from in-house sessions with Stax producers, engineers and affiliated players. Stax staffer Tom Nixon oversaw the project with a team of engineers that included Dave Purple, William Brown, Henry Bush and Josephine Bridges, who with Nixon had previously co-founded Stax subsidiary We Produce Records. We Produce solo artists Lee Sain and Lou Bond both sing backup behind Smith, who had anoff-kilter approach to gospel without ever listening to his record. For one, he was adamant about removing his shirt for the cover, according to label leadership. Within the grooves of the album, he wears a knack for experimentation on his proverbial sleeve—even without a shirt.\n\nStretching out for a deep rendition of “Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child,” Smith disregards just about everything that people know about the song, leaving only its words to bear any resemblance to versions of the past. Opening with the slow-burning title track “Whatever Happened to Love,” he cries out to find the answer to sorrow, dejection, poverty and abandonment.\n\nThe Gospel Artistics\n\nBased in the Washington D.C. area, nine-piece ensemble the Gospel Artistics set up shop at DB Sounds Studios in nearby Silver Spring, Maryland, for a full-length project, tied together and informed by elements as disparate as Northern soul and jam rock. The all-male group displayed the talents of all of its participants, as several members were multi-instrumentalists, vocalists, writers and producers. This includes work from vocalist and organist Al Mason, guitarist and baritone vocalist Tyrone Chase and songwriter and tenor vocalist David Hood.\n\nHood and Chase co-write “Lord Is It I?” a standout callback to the doo-wop of Motown and Chess, affixed in an otherwise largely livewire album. Though still a pared-back respite from the electrified soul of the album’s remaining runtime, the song’s syrupy, sweet tone is jilted by LeVon McNeil’s hard-hitting drumming, hinting at the group’s brash overtones.\n\nI Found The Answer\n\nBefore his songs would be incorporated in the creation of Kanye West’s “Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1” and before being charged with encouraging his members to participate in a pyramid scheme, Rev. T.L. Barnett, Jr., was riding the rippling momentum of his 1971 debut album ahead of a 1973 release on Gospel Truth. On “I Found the Answer,” Barrett boasts that in his Youth for Christ Choir he’s “made something from nothing,” finding his own talent for music without any formal training and harnessing his leadership enough to shepherd a sprawling, young choir to success in the recording industry.\n\nSupplementary to all his self-assurance, Barrett and his choir do give glory to God in the duration of the album’s 10 tracks. While “I Found the Answer” is a stunning vocal affair, the album’s true virtue is upheld in its instrumental dexterity. Pianist Larry Ball and Gary “Snake” Riley trade the heavy lifting on their respective instruments, revealing covertly through each song that they could be equally as effective in either a jazz lounge or a Sunday service.\n\nInstead of opting for the melancholy on “He Rose (From the Grave),” Barrett makes a turn toward the uplifting, recalling the details of Christ’s crucifixion with an air of positivity. Singing, “I’m so glad he set me free,” the choir turns turmoil into triumph.\n\nThe People's Choir Of Operation Push\n\nStax’s proximity to the Civil Rights Movement and struggle for black American liberation was well established prior to the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., mere city blocks away from the label’s headquarters. It deepened thereafter, as Stax label head Al Bell forged an ongoing partnership with King confidante Rev. Jesse Jackson. Around the same time that Jackson spun off his own Operation PUSH (People United to Save Humanity) from the Southern Christian Leadership Council’s Operation Breadbasket, he’d also ascended as a household name, thanks to the success of a recording of his signature litany, “I Am Somebody.” A recording of the speech, made famous by Jackson at rallies and meetings in Chicago, had gained notoriety nationwide with the help of its own Stax Records LP.\n\nDevised as a genre-mixing band of musicians, heralded by Operation PUSH executive vice president Thomas N. Todd as the “master weavers” of the organization’s musical message, the People’s Choir of Operation PUSH was conducted by saxophonist, songwriter and producer Gene Barge. In addition to musical guidance, the group was led spiritually by Rev. Marvin Yancy during a recording session at Universal Recording Studio in Chicago.\n\nYancy sings lead on the traditional “I’m a Child of the King” with an effortless falsetto, threading himself into the “weavers’” fabric, adding color to their complicated “patchwork quilt.”\n\nBlue Aquarius\n\nAs an aside from both the traditional and more cutting-edge gospel styles in the Gospel Truth catalog, 1973’s “Blue Aquarius” is a stark departure in sound and subject matter. While the album may be classified under the “religious music” banner, the album foregoes any notion of “gospel,” aiming instead for followers of a new age spiritual sect known as the Divine Light Movement.\n\nFounded in northern India in 1960 by Hans Rām Singh Rawat, the organization was led in 1973 by his 15-year-old son, Prem Pal Singh Rawat, known to a purported base of more than one million global devotees as Guru Maharaj Ji. Much like Stax had done with its Los Angeles Coliseum concert in August 1972, the DLM staged a large-scale festival in the Astrodome in Houston, Texas. Centered on growing its U.S. membership, the three-day event featured speeches by the Guru, a performance by Enterprise Records avant-garde bluesman Eric Mercury and 50-piece band Blue Aquarius, who’d already pressed this LP of odes to their leader.\n\nThe group was led onstage and in the studio by Maharaj Ji’s older brother Shri Bhole Ji and former Bee Gees drummer Geoff Bridgford. Met with derision by American reviewers in its day, the album has held up, in some regard, as a relic of the so-called “Age of Aquarius,” in which musicians in the U.S. and U.K. upheld a movement of music inspired by Eastern philosophy and aimed at soundtracking the freedom of youth counterculture.\n\n“God Is Love,” the album’s cinematic opener, utilizes a moving and emotive wall of sound to usher in the sheer magnitude of the enormous orchestra. There, winding, rushing brass carries the listener as far away from their own reality as the DLM’s teachings suggest. Still, the album is at its best in its meditative moments, such as the quiet and subdued “Rock Me Maharaj Ji,” a song that does all it can to appeal to potential followers with a trance-like soft rock exterior, encapsulating its very direct religious intentions.\n\nEverybody Will Be Happy\n\nThe magic of Bob Hemphill and the Commanders’ “Everybody Will Be Happy” is its sheer commitment to simplicity and good cheer. The peaceful stillness of the record is reflected in its packaging: an overtly non-descript cover, invoking a calm blue sky and a soaring white dove.\n\nNow with his own specialized billing alongside his group of Commanders, Bob leads his troupe of hopeful Commanders through a program of decidedly minimal hymns. And once again, Bob’s brother Neal Hemphill returns at the helm as producer and engineer. As the two Hemphill brothers complete the album in audible conversation with one another, the drawn-back direction of the album yet allows for deliberate contrast between tracks like the swinging country of “I’ll Soon Be Gone” and the incessantly moody “Ten Thousand Years.”\n\nBrothers\n\nIn their third outing, Steve, Thomas and Rance Allen are joined by their brother Esau Allen on congas for a family affair. Less bombastic than their previous efforts, Rance leads the group in a manner that speaks to the brothers’ comfortability within their own range, their familiarity with one another and their reverence for the material.\n\nThe album’s second side begins with “Be True,” a soft piano-laden recording, with airy vocal backing provided by Linda, Judy and Annie Mendez. Maintaining relatively muted, somber vocal refrains for the song’s duration, Rance’s physicality when singing still manages to extend itself to listeners as he argues a case in favor of finding truth within yourself while supporting others.\n\nI Am Determined\n\nThe opening measures of the Howard Lemon Singers’ “I Am Determined” command sincerity, as well as attention. Delicate woodwinds lure in all who are able to hear before halting brass notes disarm the melody and the group begs, “Stop, look, listen to the voice of Jesus.” Unlike more famous versions of the song, sung before in a romantic fashion by the Stylistics and Diana Ross with Marvin Gaye, the Howard Lemon Singers sing in a state of alert, as if there is little time to settle your heart with Jesus.\n\nThey sing with the same urgency on “Let Him Come In” and “Glory, Glory Since I Laid My Burden Down,” where each member offers their own testimony. Aided by a blistering and steady rhythm, the song inspires the instinct to dance just as easily as it might one to rejoice. On an album by a group which specializes in covertly encroaching into the territories of funk and soul while delivering the good news of the Lord, the song is right at home.\n\nLeaning On Everlasting Arms\n\nThe Marion Gaines Singers open “Leaning on Everlasting Arms” by leaning into a bluesy, hard rock-esque soundscape. Gaines’ hazy lead vocal tips its cap in the direction of Joe Cocker and Creedence Clearwater Revival, instead of that of the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi or Mahalia Jackson. Save for “Open Your Heart,” the album’s sole straight-ahead gospel song, Gaines and his group relish in the realms of deep, heavy funk.\n\nProduced by Gene Barge, the album’s most egregious solicitation to fans of funk on radio and in film comes in the form of “The Man,” an allegory transposing the common tropes of slick street hustlers onto a fictional preacher man. Instead of selling dope, he a “super-cool blesser” who pushes salvation at no charge. Fixating further on the blaxploitation of the era, the group re-imagines Isaac Hayes’ “Do Your Thing,” a staple of the “Shaft” soundtrack, as a praise song, singing over a hip-shaking beat that their audience should “Pray on, pray on!”\n\nGoodbye Loneliness, Hello Happiness\n\nIf only judged by its guitar introduction, handled by Morris Dollison, Jr., Maceo Woods’ “Good-Bye Loneliness” could be characterized as a blues song. Like the majority of the album which bears its name, the track bears enough musical resemblance to the music of juke joints and parlors to provide an unmistakable contrast to its richly sanguine content.\n\nRelying heavily on organ, guitar and bass, the album may, at points, sound downtrodden. But its messaging constantly reminds the masses to look to the sky for inspiration. As is customary with Woods releases with his Christian Tabernacle Concert Choir, soloists are given opportunity to extend the ensemble’s reach. None rise to the occasion with the same effectiveness as Alfredia Burton and Doris Sykes, who"
