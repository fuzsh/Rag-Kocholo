Peter Broderick)\n\nThe concert recorded at Hammersmith Odeon in London on 26th March 1977, was one of the stand-outs from that memorable tour and it has been mixed by Stephen W. Tayler and is presented here on vinyl for the very first time. The recording reveals the improvisational side of Be Bop Deluxe, particularly on pieces such as Shine and Blazing Apostles which made each Be Bop Deluxe concert unique. Cut at Abbey Road Studios and pressed on white vinyl, this special Record Store Day limited edition release is a fitting tribute to a fine live band and the creative vision of Bill Nelson.\n\nS1 - INTRODUCTION-BLIMPS, 2 LIFE IN THE AIR AGE, 3 FAIR EXCHANGE, 4 PIECE OF MINE, SISTER SEAGULL S2 - 1 MILL STREET JUNCTION, 2 SHIPS IN THE NIGHT, 3 SWANSONG, 4 MAID IN HEAVEN S3 - 1 SHINE, 2 ADVENTURES IN A YORKSHIRE LANDSCAPE S4- BILL NELSON'S INTRODUCTION, 2 TWIGHLIGHT CAPERS, 3 MODERN MUSIC SUITE S5 - 1 FORBIDDEN LOVERS, 2 TERMINAL STREET S6 - 1 BLAZING APOSTLES\n\nPaul Butterfield met aspiring blues guitarist Elvin Bishop in the early 1960s and with bassist Jerome Arnold and drummer Sam Lay (both from Howlin Wolfs touring band), the new group secured a highly successful club engagement at Big Johns Folk Club in Chicago, bringing them to the attention of producer Paul A. Rothchild. During their engagement, Butterfield met and occasionally sat in with guitarist Mike Bloomfield. Rothchild was impressed with the chemistry between the two and having persuaded Paul to bring Bloomfield into the band, eventually signed them to Elektra Records in 1964. This Deluxe 3LP expanded edition of The Paul Butterfield Bands lost sessions from the 1964-1966 era features the classic line-up working through blues classics. It is the first time this killer collection is available on vinyl and is expanded to include unreleased demo and alternate tracks recently found in the Warner Vaults.\n\nThis double LP release features one of Miles Davis final great bands: John Scofield on guitar, Bill The Other Bill Evans Evans on saxophones, flute and electric piano, Darryl Jones on bass, Al Foster on drums, and percussionist Mino Cinelu. Miles was back in amazing form (incandescent and iridescent as ever, critic Greg Tate noted), when he mounted the stage at the Theatre St-Denis during the Festival International De Jazz De Montreal in July 1983, and this revelatory performance has been lovingly mixed and mastered for its first ever release, on vinyl for Record Store Day 2022. (A CD will be part of the next edition of the Miles Davis Bootleg Series, focusing on the 1981-1985 period, later in the year.)\n\nWhat It Is includes tracks from that years release Star People, the Marcus Miller tune Hopscotch and the song Jean-Pierre that appeared on 1982s We Want Miles. The recordings of What It Is and Thats What Happened were so well thought of by Miles that he utilized them for his 1984 release Decoy, but in heavily edited form and this release would include the first release of them in complete form. Packaged in beautiful gatefold packaging, the album features liner notes penned by the incomparable music journalist Greg Tate and represent some of his final writing.\n\nSide A\n\n1.

Creepin In\n\nIn the summer of 1970, Linda Hoover, then 19, entered Manhattans Advantage Sound Studio to cut her first album with Gary Katz, Walter Becker and Donald Fagen leading a team that also included guitarists (and future Steely Dan members) Denny Dias & Jeff Skunk Baxter, and Eric Weissberg, saxophonist Jerome Richardson, plus members of the Dick Cavett Orchestra.\n\nI Mean To Shine includes three original compositions by Linda alongside The Bands In A Station (from Music From Big Pink) and Stephen Stills 4+20 (which appeared on CSN&Ys Déjà Vu). Almost half of the album was penned by the pre-Steely Dan songwriting duo of Becker and Fagen, including what would become the albums title track. After creating a wonderful record, album cover photos were taken and then it all fell apart.\n\nThe release was shelved over a business disagreement and if that wasnt heartbreaking enough, Hoover learned that Barbra Streisand also recorded I Mean To Shine (which would appear on her album Barbra Joan Streisand). Streisands album hit #11 and went gold. For the production team of Katz, Becker, and Fagen one success built on another and they were hired to staff positions at ABC-Dunhill Records in Los Angeles.\n\nHoover continued to pursue musical opportunities in New York, but with her creative team gone and no record release to show for their collective efforts, she wound up returning to her parents house in Florida. However, she did take a tape copy of her album home with her.\n\nNow, with the blessing from Hoover and original producer Katz, the previously unissued album, I Mean To Shine finally sees the light of day and even features the proposed 1970 cover shot by Joel Brodsky (whose work at that time had already graced the covers of releases from The Doors, Van Morrison, The Stooges, and more). The album has been produced for release by Linda, Jay Willingham, and Grammy®-winner Cheryl Pawelski with audio restoration and mastering by Grammy®-winning engineer Michael Graves. Scott Schinders liner notes are informed by new interviews with Hoover and Katz.\n\nSide A\n\n1) I Mean To Shine\n\n2) Turn\n\n3) Roaring Of The Lamb\n\n4) Roll Back\n\n5) Autumn\n\n6) Jones\n\nSide B\n\n1) In A Station\n\n2) Mama Tears\n\n3) City Mug\n\n4) 4 + 20\n\n5) The Dove\n\nLinda Martell was the first African-American woman to make the country charts and to appear at the Grand Ole Opry, and helped lay the groundwork for future artists of color in the genre. Despite multiple TV appearances, a dozen appearances at the Opry, and some big hits - including \"Color Him Father\", \"Before the Next Teardrop Falls\" and \"Bad Case of the Blues\" - her 1970 debut album, Color Me Country, would also be her last. Now the album is being remastered for its first vinyl pressing in over half a century. Org Musics reissue was mastered by Dave Gardner at Infrasonic Mastering and pressed on color vinyl at Furnace Record Pressing, exclusively for Record Store Day 2022.\n\n1 Bad Case Of The Blues\n\n2 San Francisco Is A Lonely Town\n\n3 The Wedding Cake\n\n4 Tender Leaves Of Love\n\n5 I Almost Called Your Name\n\n6 Color Him Father\n\n7 There Never Was A Time\n\n8 You're Crying Boy, Crying\n\n9 Old Letter Song\n\n10 Then I'll Be Over You\n\n11 Before The Next Teardrop Falls\n\nThe Gold Experience was the first full-length Prince album to be credited to his unpronounceable symbol, and was released at the most public, heated stage of his battle with the major label industrial complex. With the word SLAVE written on one cheek, Prince shined on the opulent ballads The Most Beautiful Girl in the World and Gold and the defiant single Eye Hate U, and the album earned widespread critical acclaim.\n\nThe Record Store Day 2022 re-release of The Gold Experience is an homage to the rare US-only promo version of the album released in 1995. The two-LP set is pressed onto translucent gold vinyl with a bonus suite of Eye Hate U remixes on Side D.\n\nSide A\n\n1. P Control\n\n2. NPG Operator #1\n\n3. Endorphinmachine\n\n4. Shhh\n\n5.
