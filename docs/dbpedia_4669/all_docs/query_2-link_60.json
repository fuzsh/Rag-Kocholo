        "text": "hello people,\n\nthis is johnny not-dead-yet dowd. in a couple weeks i'll be flying across the pond with my buddies mike stark and park doing. i think i have put together some of the best music i've ever done. of course i always feel that way before a tour. i'll let you be the judge.\n\ni'll be bringing some of my art work too. its the kind of stuff that would look good hanging in your laundry room.\n\ni haven't done an overseas tour in a few years but i feel ready. i just need to update my wardrobe and get a haircut. both things seem doable. looking forward to seeing old friends and making some new ones.so god willing and the creek don't rise, i'll see you soon.\n\nspread the word,\n\nyour pal johnny\n\nOctober 1, 2023\n\nJohnny releases new album Is Heaven Rea? How Would I Know and announces European tour dates for 2024\n\nThe air was charged at producer Bruce Watson's Delta-Sonic Sounds when some of Memphis' hippest players gathered to record with Dowd. In addition to his longtime bandmates, drummer Jif Dowd (his sister) and guitarist Mike Edmondson, Dowd had a slew of ringers: twin stars Will Sexton, who co-produced and played guitar, and Amy LaVere, on bass and vocals, a touring couple who embody the Great American Songbook; Rick Steff (Lucero) on piano; Alex Greene (Reigning Sound) on organ and trombone; Jim Spake (Lucero, Alex Chilton) on reeds; Krista Lynne Wroten (Memphis Dawls) on fiddle and vocals; and Will McCarley and Shawn Zorn adding percussion.\n\nAnd yet, so varied and versatile were the players that what emerged was a far cry from any typical “Memphis Sound” album. Leaning into the weathered old world of Dowd's lyrics and voice, the band helped fashion a soundscape that's as earthy as an Oklahoma field, as sweet and soulful as a Memphis doughnut shop, as edgy as walking the rails over a river bridge.\n\nWith the new release come brand new tour dates. Johnny Dowd will be over in Europe all March.\n\nSeptember 15, 2023\n\nJohnny Dowd releases \"Homemade Pie\" and premiered first single \"Call Me The Wind\" today. In September Johnny Dowd will bring this record over to European soil.\n\nWhat goes around, comes around, and Johnny Dowd shows us how to keep on going the way only the \"scary troubadour\" can - with a wry smile, a cut-off pool cue under the front seat, and a sharp eye on the rear view mirror. Along with Mike Edmondson, Willie B and Kim Sherwood-Caso, (the old band from Pictures from Life's Other Side), Johnny covers the kind of emotional gamut he explored in his breakthrough album Wrong Side of Memphis. Be sure to get a copy of Homemade Pie. You won't be sorry, or at least not any sorrier than you already are.\n\n\"I call my new album Homemade Pie because I recorded it at my house and I like pie. I could have called it Pie A La Monde but I didn't. I think this is the best batch of songs I've written in long time. I had plenty of time last year to dig in so that's what I did. I had one rule for writing and recording this record, no second guessing, in other words don't be clever [nobody likes a wiseass]. Musically the album was influenced by the music I grew up with: soul, blues, country and a little garage rock. Like most records it's best listened to loud with windows down and nothing but open road ahead. I hope u like it if not no hard feelings\" --- johnny\n\nDowd is the self-styled ultra-scary troubadour with a glint in his eye. He’s one of those artists that seems to fly under the radar yet those lucky enough to stumble across his albums become evangelical exponents of his terrifically twisted take on rock ‘n’ roll. Homemade Pie is the latest album in a long line of hidden gems from the ever-prolific, Americana outlaw.\n\nTourdates\n\nCopyright © 2022 Sedate Bookings\n\nThere’s been a lot of great times between hard ones this summer. Johnny met some fine folks and played some good music. If this weren’t the NEWS page we’d write all about it (yes, there really needs to be a blog). Let’s just let one of the good people of New York sum it up when he said, “Whoa, shit just got real there, real fast.” Indeed it did, my friend, indeed it did.\n\nNow here’s the news:\n\nJohnny’s combination art and music XMAS 21 EP came out in time to make the holidays merry, if you have a kinda twisted sense of merry. Each cover was hand-drawn by Johnny, and his sister Jif added the lino cut. There’s a few left if your Xmas just keeps on going, or you can miss out on the collectible art part and get the tunes from Bandcamp.\n\nBig news is - HOMEMADE PIE will be available the first week of January! We’ll announce it on social media, or get a personal reminder by signing up for the newletter.\n\nApril 17,2021\n\nYo people---\n\nwhat up (as if I didn't know)--\n\nWorking on new record with compatriot Mike Edmondson--went back to the basics on this one--and proud to be part of an upcoming tribute to Jackie Leven. Also my sister Jif and i have art showing at the greenly art space show (yes I'm entering the art biz)— In Sept I'm teaching a songwriting class--I promise to teach u how to play guitar or keyboard and write a song in an hour and a half.\n\nPS--I'm looking to do some house parties in the fall (if the creek don't rise). Contact me if interested.\n\n— Johnny\n\nThe Greenly Art Space online opening of the USPS-Art-Project will be conducted via Zoom on Sat. April 24th at 4pm PDT. John and his sister have three pieces in the show, and will be part of an artists interview section.\n\nYou can register for the opening here.\n\nJohnny and Mike will be covering Jackie Leven’s “Farm Boy” for the tribute album Michael Weston King is putting together. Seems very appropriate, and early takes sound incredible. Look for a helluva line-up of artists appearing alongside Johnny on this.\n\nCheck out out Rik van Iersel’s mixed media project: The Conductors Tales. Brian Wilson and Johnny Dowd joined long distance style for this mind-blowing art and music collaboration.\n\nThurs. Sept. 23 at 6:30pm Johnny will join Jennie Lowe Stearns and Mary Lorson for an online workshop: A Demystification of Songwriting. They will break down their individual writing practice, and each will also perform a song or two that they have recently written. Bound to be illuminating.\n\nRegister for the workshop here.\n\nAND NOW THE BIG NEWS:\n\nInternational shipping is available again, and soon we’ll have more CDs up. Check back soon to complete your collection!\n\nHere's a nice review by Hans Werksman of Johnny's new release, \"Live at GrassRoots 2006.\" The CD-R is available on the Store page.\n\nJohnny Dowd has dug up a rocking show from the past. Live at GrassRoots 2006, recorded in Trumansburg, NY, in July 2006, catches him in full flight, with Michael Stark (keyboards, organ), Willie B (drums, bass pedals) and Kim Sherwood-Caso (vocals). He played quite a few songs that were unreleased at the time — the scary blues rocker \"Demons and Goats,\" for instance, would turn up on his Wake Up the Snakes album in 2010.\n\nWhile most artists play it safe on stage and stick close to the studio versions, Dowd and his band love to turn things upside down and inside out. Warts and all is pretty much their modus operandi, but it works like a charm. \"Uncle Willie\" comes barreling down the tracks like a runaway train. \"The Good Die Young,\" a song that became a highlight on the Hellwood album Chainsaw Of Life, is a slowed-down lament that hits hard. \"Miracles Never Happen\" is dedicated to his mother, who would be surprised that her son is still kicking ass today, a music critics' favourite, and a cult artist with a fervent and vocal fan base.\n\n\"Drunk\" is skewed and lopsided, almost falling apart, with Kim Sherwood-Caso as the one who keeps it together. Performing a song with reckless abandon is what Johnny Dowd does best, but he is smart enough to take a time out after such a demanding excursion and let \"his band within a band,\" Tzar (Willie B and Michael Stark), plus guest vocalist Eva Revesz, do their electronic thing with \"Don't Drink the Water\" — which must have confused the hardcore folkies in attendance. Closing the show with \"God Created Woman,\" a song that was already part of the shows of his first band, Neon Baptist, and a standout track of his Pictures from Life’s Other Side album, he bade the audience farewell, after putting on a show that delighted his fans, converted a few and generally confused and/or irritated the rest.\n\nHans Werksman\n\nHere Comes the Flood\n\nwerksman.blogspot.com\n\nThis is a live recording of Johnny and the band’s performance at the GrassRoots Festival in Trumansburg, New York, in the summer of 2006. Band members at that time were Michael Stark, Willie B, and Kim Sherwood-Caso (shown on CD cover above). Includes a song performed by Tzar (Willie B and Michael Stark), with vocals by Eva Revesz.\n\nFull song listing available on Store page. Track 9, “Demons and Goats,” is above.\n\nSeptember 11, 2019\n\nJohnny will have a new CD out in a few weeks.\n\nWe’re doing a limited run of CD-Rs of his performance at the Grassroots Festival in Trumansburg, New York, in the summer of 2006.\n\nHis bandmates at that time were Michael Stark, Willie B, and Kim Sherwood-Caso (shown on the CD cover above, with Johnny).\n\nIt will only be available here at his site. If you aren’t already on Johnny’s email list, please sign up here, and you’ll receive an email when the CD is available.\n\nAugust 15, 2019\n\nWe have gotten our hands on a few more copies of Hellwood: Chainsaw of Life, the CD Johnny made in collaboration with Jim White and Willie B in 2006. This CD is hard to find, but you can purchase it now on the Store page here.\n\nBelow is a review that appeared in Americana UK when Hellwood was released. Also below, photos taken during the making of the album by Kat Dalton, who also took the photo for the CD cover.\n\nHellwood: Chainsaw of Life\n\nWelcome to Hellwood, population 3. Be afraid.\n\nThere has been a lot of collaboration on the Americana scene of late. The members of Golden Smog found the time to record a third long player while those busy guys in Calexico also tied-up with Iron & Wine for a release. Yet for lovers of the darker, weirder side of the genre, Hellwood is the one you’ve been waiting for. After nine years of talking about it, the cool and often creepy Johnny Dowd, a man that has that David Lynch knack of raising a laugh while he’s unsettling the hell out of you, has hooked up with his regular drummer and composer Willie B and the ‘hick-hop’ visionary Jim White to bring ‘Chainsaw of Life’ to the table. It’s a natural blend for the long-time friends who also worked together on the Jim White film ‘Searching for the Wrong Eyed Jesus.’\n\nDespite associating these artists with the dirty south, the album was recorded in a cabin in central New York that was plastered with obituaries of dead musicians. It’s a weird and wonderful journey the three artists paint with characters and scenarios that stretch the imagination. With every listen, new nuances about these stories reveal themselves, whether it’s Dowd’s funky ‘God’s Back Pocket,’ which shares a theme with John Goodman’s character in ‘O Brother Where Art Thou,’ or the co-written frenetic ‘Man in a Plaid Suit’ about a frightened obscure man who only lets his hands out of the pockets of his Plaid suit at night.\n\nThe record is dominated by Dowd, his ‘Thank You Lord,’ ‘Chicken Shack’ and ‘The Good Die Young’ adding a forceful and heavy invective. White, however, tones down the darkness with the dreamy and beautiful numbers ‘A Man Loves His Wife,’ and ‘Dream On’ as well as the oddball pop of ‘Spider in the Bed.’ As such, the album is not a smooth ride as it veers between styles at an alarming rate and a multitude of voices are apparent. The appearance of a Talking Heads riff (‘Crosseyed & Painless’) on ‘Ten Commandments’ comes straight out of leftfield. However this only serves to intrigue.\n\nFor fans of Dowd, the inclusion of White augments his vision without watering down his style. For fans of White, Dowd gives his lyrics a creepier feel, the hip ‘Fireworks Factory’ a case in point. All three artists chime in with songs that would stand out on any of their solo albums and they feed off each other’s strengths. If you’re planning a trip anytime soon, Hellwood ain’t like any place you’ve been before.\n\nNic Fildes, Americana-uk.com\n\nAugust 11, 2006\n\nI’ll be hitting road next Thursday. Yikes.\n\nI’m as ready as I’ll ever be and think we have a pretty entertaining show—including some choreography. I’ll have all my records for sale plus some artwork and Johnny Dowd masks!\n\nLooking forward to seeing old friends and hope to make some new ones. — Johnny\n\nLatest press for Family Picnic:\n\n“Dowd has made a career of making music full of piercingly bleak, hard fought, gnarled dreamscapes that make David Lynch’s tales seem like those of a choir boy. But just when I thought I had him figured out, Dowd delivers a blues record so beautiful that I cannot stop playing it. It is also full of demons that live on a merry-go-round with feedback and distortion taking the places of the painted ponies going up and down. Paradoxically, it’s his most accessible music in quite a while, maybe ever.”\n\n— Amos Perrine, No Depression (US)\n\n“On these 14 new songs, Dowd, like America, has reverted to his dark, twisted country roots. In Dowd’s case, it’s a good thing.”\n\n— MOJO (UK)\n\n“....because the songs are so damn well put together (after two tunes it sounds like edits of long-forgotten classics from an indefinable past) and following each other at such a fast pace, this is perhaps the man’s most accessible record of the past decade.”\n\n— Guy Peters, Enola (Belgium)\n\n“The grizzled, weather-worn drawing of Dowd that peers out from the CD cover is matched by the dark and ramshackle country-blues noir within....’Vicksburg’ is a blood-drenched affair, the title track is anything but a picnic, and the country legend Conway Twitty gets a surreal namecheck.”\n\n— Daily Express (UK)\n\n“The album of the moment, and probably of the year, is without a doubt Johnny Dowd’s. Family Picnic is, pardon my French, a splendid cubist portrait of forty years of American music. Let’s say Georges Braque with a Fender amp and a flask of whiskey.”\n\n— Dyl Dylan, Le Cri du Coyote (France)\n\nJohnny on his new album, Family Picnic, which will be released March 1:\n\n“I had to dig pretty deep for this one. Not sure how many more tunes I have in me. Tick tock. This record took an unexpected turn to the past — my past. It’s kind of like Wrong Side of Memphis 30 years down the road. Surprisingly little has changed for me (emotionally, that is). I’m still drawn to the same themes — unrequited love, murder, general foolishness. Waltzes and shuffles and boom chuck beats abound. Ice cream chord changes. Plus Kim Sherwood-Caso and Mike Edmondson. What’s not to like? An Americana classic, if I do say so myself.”\n\nMany thanks to artist Mike Massingham who created the woodcut for the cover of CD. He contacted us after meeting Johnny at his London show earlier this year and offered to do the artwork for the next album. We took him up on his kind offer. You can see the lovely result above. Below is Mike in his studio.\n\nWe’ve gotten some requests for the Euro tour t-shirts from people in the U.S. So we’ve put them up for sale on the Store page.\n\nIf you order now, Johnny will put one aside for you, in your size, and bring it home with him after the tour. Then we’ll ship in mid-February.\n\n“Going Down the Road Feeling Bad” is both the name of the tour and the title of a track on Johnny’s latest album, “Twinkle, Twinkle.” Johnny’s co-bill on the tour, Melle de Boer, designed the shirt.\n\nIf you’re interested in having one, be sure to order soon. They could sell out on the tour.\n\nThe tour has been going very well. The show in London, in St. Pancras Old Church, was packed.\n\nThere are still nine more shows. If you’re in the United Kingdom or The Netherlands, please check out the schedule on the Tour page. The Antwerp show is sold out.\n\n”Twinkle, Twinkle” CD available now on the Store page of this site. It‘s available digitally at all the usual outlets.\n\nUncut made it Americana album of the month in their February 2018 issue:\n\n“Reverence be damned. . . . Twinkle, Twinkle finds the prolific miscreant sifting through some of the keystones of American blues, folk, and jazz and giving them a radical makeover. . . . few manage to recycle existing musical forms quite like him.” — Rob Hughes\n\nAlso a very perceptive review at Soundblab site here. An excerpt:\n\n“’The coo coo is a pretty bird,’ Clarence Ashley once crooned on a scratchy bit of shellac sometime in early 20th Century. Well, Dowd’s version is just plain cuckoo. Here this well-worn standard sounds like it joined up with Devo after a 5th of Jim Beam. This bird is so mean, it will rip your heart out like a buzzard if you so much as tip toe around it. And you not only won’t recognize this ‘St. James Infirmary’, you’ll need directions home after sliding all over the guts spilled on the floor. In Dowd’s hands, Son House’s ‘John The Revelator’ reads more like a Dear John letter to Nietzsche’s lost, dead God. ‘Tom Dooley’ gets a make- over with a pair of brass knuckles. And God help you if you’re caught snoozing in this ‘House of The Rising Sun’. If that weren’t enough, Dowd has cut the most unsettling and terrifying version of ‘Twinkle Twinkle Little Star’ you’ll ever hear. Mozart must be laughing in his grave.“ — Kevin Orton\n\nJust got back from a mini southern tour­—Local 506 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina; 123 Pleasant Street in Morgantown, West Virginia; and Mouthhole Festival in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nAll three gigs were a ton of fun. Mike Edmondson and I dubbed ourselves the Muggles Brothers for this tour. Jennifer Edmondson came with us and was a great help with the merch table. In Chapel Hill, I was able to visit with my sister and her husband who gave me an awesome madras jacket from the sixties! Thanks to the clubs for booking us and the people who came out to see us. Give yourself a big hand.\n\nOne of the highlights of the tour was an out-of-the-world lunch at Mama Kay’s in Princeton, West Virginia. The food was great, and the owners really made us feel at home. If you are in the area, check it out. Tell them Johnny sent you.\n\nHere’s a brand new Johnny song for you. Johnny wrote and recorded this for The Mouthhole who commissioned the song via his Indiegogo campaign earlier this year. The Mouthhole is a Nashville-based house venue run by Michael Sadler, Zac Caffrey, and Travis Caffrey. It hosts regular parties that feature live music, art, theater, and all things bizarre. It’s home to weirdo rock band The Chewers and electronic monkey man Chop Chop Chang.\n\nMichael, Zac, and Travis created their own fund-raising campaign to raise money for their Johnny song in which they also wrote songs for donors. They wrote 36 songs altogether which are awesome! Be sure to check them out here. There’s even one written for Johnny.\n\nWe’ve added some new merch to the store page —\n\n— Neon Baptist CDs: Two disks of live recordings of Johnny’s first band in handmade package including photo of Johnny from that era (photo below).\n\n— Zolar t-shirts: Shirts worn by employees of Johnny’s moving company. Become an honorary Zolar employee!\n\n— 7-inch vinyl: Johnny song on one side and Mark Lotterman song on the other.\n\nWe’ve also slashed the prices of older CDs. Maybe some of your friends and family would like Johnny music for Christmas? Or maybe Johnny’s song “Christmas is Just Another Day” would suit you? (It’s on the Cemetery Shoes CD.) All CDs will be autographed.\n\n—Kat\n\nNovember 15, 2016\n\nHowdy people.\n\nJust got back from a super fun tour of Europe. The crowds were great. They really opened their hearts (and wallets) to me and the Sex Robots.\n\nI want to thank Mike Edmondson and Anna Coogan. They rocked it every night and did all the hard work behind the scenes (driving, merch sales, getting me out of bed). Also want to thank Mark Lotterman and Park Doing. They did the support on the tour and lit a fire under me every night (and also helped with the practical stuff).\n\nThanks to Sedate Bookings for a great job booking the tour, to Artist on the Road for supplying the van and equipment, and to Del Day of Ark PR for promo. It’s a pleasure doing business with you guys. And last, but not least, thanks to Kat Dalton, my wife and manager. Without her hard work, there would be no tour or indeed no Johnny Dowd music career.\n\nBelow are some of my photos from my instant camera which Kat got for me for the tour.\n\n— Johnny\n\n“Soaked in swirling guitars with extraterrestrial synth sounds throughout, Dowd here creates a piece which is on a par with the best of Beck.”\n\n—Americana-uk.com\n\n“Sometimes music shouldn’t be easy, and instead should be mysterious, idiosyncratic and the work of a true maverick. So we should welcome the arrival of a new Johnny Dowd album. . . . Never a man to run from the truth, if there was any justice, this guy would be a legend.“\n\n— Acoustic Magazine (UK)\n\n“Imagine if Hank Williams had mutated into Captain Beefheart, acquiring a bunch of primitive electronic equipment along the way, and you’ll get some idea of where Johnny Dowd is at on Execute American Folklore. . . . Gloriously deviant.“\n\n— Andy Gill, The Independent (London)\n\nThis 14-song album is among Johnny Dowd’s best and, in an aberrant way, most accessible. Opener Unease and Deviance, which sounds like a disco single played at 33, is weirdly danceable, while the rap brag-a-thon Modern Woman is a gleeful sing-along. As well as a beatnik-hillbilly rap, there’s punk-blues too, SFX, synths, cool arrangements, and luckless characters who wouldn’t feel alone at a Trump rally.\n\n—MOJO\n\n“Great album.“\n\n— Oor (Netherlands)\n\nSeptember 9, 2016\n\nAvailable now! Song samples on new record page. Available in stores and Amazon in Europe, on our store page (autographed), and at iTunes and other digital outlets worldwide.\n\nThanks again to all the Indiegogo campaign donors who made this release possible.\n\nHere’s a nice review that came out today:\n\n“Imagine if Hank Williams had mutated into Captain Beefheart, acquiring a bunch of primitive electronic equipment along the way, and you’ll get some idea of where Johnny Dowd is at on Execute American Folklore. The songs, narrated in Dowd’s ornery, fatalist drawl, feature his usual cast of hapless characters adrift in a world of mordant ill-fortune, but this time they are driven by mutant funk grooves crafted with buzzing, quacking synthesisers. ’Unease And Deviance’ sets the tone, harsh drum-machine driving its account of ’twisted terror, vicious pleasure’; before the protagonists of ’Sexual Revolution’ and ’Rhumba In The Park’ suffer their below-the-belt blows. But balancing this is the maniacal glee with which Dowd recounts the detriments of booze and drugs in ’Whiskey Ate My Brain,’ climaxing in the album’s most wonderfully tortured burst of guitar noise. Gloriously deviant.“ (4/5) —Andy Gill, The Independent (UK), September 9, 2016\n\nSeptember 3, 2016\n\nThe final batch of perks were shipped to Indiegogo donors last Thursday. Whew. About 200 packages went out all together. Thanks again to everyone who made Johnny’s campaign a success.\n\n“Execute American Folklore“ will be released on September 9. CDs will be in stores and at Amazon in Europe (distributed by Cadiz Music), on this site, and at iTunes and other digital outlets worldwide.\n\nA few reviews have been coming in, such as this one:\n\n“Sometimes music shouldn’t be easy, and instead should be mysterious, idiosyncratic and the work of a true maverick. So we should welcome the arrival of a new Johnny Dowd album, which is like opening a case of gelignite. Whatever lurks inside, you know it ain’t going to be an easy ride, and this is no exception. ’Whiskey Ate My Brain’ comes on like some crazed ZZ Top out-take, before Mr. Dowd goes on to rail about his ’Modern Woman,’ and the demented title track does just what it suggests. Never a man to run from the truth, if there was any justice, this guy would be a legend.“ — Acoustic Magazine (UK)\n\nHad a fabulous time at Grassroots Festival in Trumansburg, New York, a couple of weeks ago. That’s Anna Coogan and Mike Edmondson there with me, and here’s an excerpt from Amos Perrine’s report at the No Depression site:\n\n“Johnny Dowd was a firebrand last year playing very late on Saturday night. This year he did two sets—both special in their own distinct ways. Even when the material is much the same, as any Dowd fan knows, no two performances are alike. Such was the case here as he geared up for a European tour. The first night was vintage Dowd, hard edged as if he were William S. Burroughs with a guitar; the second afternoon set, as one dedicated follower put it, was more accessible. But I think clarity may be the more apt observation. In any event, both performances were spellbinding, as you never quite knew where this pre-/post-punkster tightrope walker, with a touch of insurgent alt-country, would take you. I even saw him smile a time or two.“\n\nIt indeed was a nice warmup for the European tour (dates here).\n\nIndiegogo donors: The perks are almost ready to be shipped out. We picked up the Zolar t-shirts this week, and they look great. You Zolar Moving Company honorary employees will be stylin’!\n\nThe new record, “Execute American Folklore,“ will be released on September 9. Thanks again to Indiegogo donors for helping to make it happen.\n\nIndiegogo campaign extended\n\nWe were so close—89% of goal last night when the campaign was going to end. So I decided to extend the campaign ten days.\n\nIndiegogo lets you extend just once. So I have until July 2 to get that final 11%.\n\nI’ll be adding a new perk or two tomorrow. Will keep you posted on that.\n\nThanks to everyone who has brought me this far—I’m blown away by your kindness!\n\nIf you know anyone who might be interested in this project, please spread the word. It will help if I can reach new people. Remember there’s a sample from the album just below (“World Without Me“).\n\nThanks again,\n\nJohnny\n\nJune 14, 2016\n\nThanks, everyone, for your continuing support of my Indiegogo campaign. As of today, I’ve reached 64% of my goal.\n\nIn the past week, one fabulous donor chose the song perk, so I’ll be writing and recording a special song in July. That will be fun.\n\nRemember, the song perk is still available. I’d like nothing better than to write a song for you, you, and especially YOU!\n\nWe reduced the donation necessary for the framed painting (below). It’s really a cool piece of art which has been hanging on my living room wall and was reproduced on the cover of my “A Drunkard’s Masterpiece” CD. It’s a vibrant watercolor by Kurt Herrmann and comes matted and framed.\n\nThanks again, and please help spread the word. There are only 10 days left in my campaign.\n\n—Johnny\n\nMay 17, 2016\n\nI just finished my new album, “Execute American Folklore.” I’m really happy with it. I think it’s the most danceable one yet.\n\nI’ll launch an Indiegogo campaign next week, because I need your help to get this album into your hands. There will be lots of cool perks for supporters (hint: Neon Baptist fans will be pleased). Will post the Indiegogo link next Monday or Tuesday.\n\nMy October European tour is booked. Just have a couple dates to fill; all the other shows are confirmed. Band members Mike Edmondson and Anna Coogan will be coming, and Park Doing will be support for the first half of tour and Mark Lotterman for the second half. Looking forward to seeing my friends on the other side of the pond!

The show is an Independent Music Awards (IMA) event. (It’s not an awards show, only performances.) Band members Mike Edmondson and Anna Coogan will be performing with Johnny, and Bent Knee is also on the bill.\n\nThe show is free, but seating is limited and on a first-come, first-served basis. Click here for more information at the Lincoln Center web site. The Independent Music Awards Facebook page for the event is here. The David Rubenstein Atrium’s Facebook page is here.\n\nIt promises to be a fabulous show. Catch it if you can!\n\nMany thanks to Martin Folkman and the Independent Music Awards for organizing this show and for their ongoing commitment to indie artists.\n\nIthaca-area folks can catch Johnny at the Rongo in Trumansburg this Saturday, March 5.\n\nWelcome to Johnny’s new site. He’s in Europe right now, on tour to promote his new album, “That's Your Wife on the Back of My Horse,“ and having a blast.\n\nThanks to everyone who has come to his shows—he really enjoyed seeing and talking to you. Some of the shows in the UK were sold out, and the response in general has been phenomenal. There are still some shows left. Please check the tours page to see if there will be one near you.\n\nMike Edmondson has been accompanying Johnny on some of the songs, and the talented songwriter/musician Mark Lotterman was on the bill for all the UK shows, as well as the Eeklo and Lille shows. Be sure to check out his music if you haven’t already. If you like Johnny, you will like Mark—they’re kindred spirits. Mark will be catching up with Johnny again for the Zeist show.\n\nWe hope you like the new site. Our plan is for Johnny to regularly upload interesting little audio clips—music he’s working on, recordings from shows, verbal meanderings. . . who knows what. Feedback is always appreciated. You can email Johnny via the form on the contact page."
