        "text": "Moxie and Mettle\n\n2021\n\nApple Music | Spotify | Amazon\n\nFor Balsam Range what matters most is still a song, a message, a distinctive sound and a compelling performance. And though the western North Carolina quintet is known as a bluegrass band par excellence, they’ve always escaped easy categorization; just when you think you’ve got them pegged, they’ll surprise you once again. Such is the case with Moxie and Mettle.\n\nAeonic\n\n2019\n\niTunes | Spotify | Amazon\n\nIt has been said that great songs are timeless. But they also organize time into attractive human pieces while their lyrics manage their way into our hearts and minds with lasting meaning. Great music has no expiration date—it is Aeonic.\n\nOn the heels of their second International Bluegrass Music Association Entertainer of the Year award, this eminent band continues to be a tour de force in Bluegrass with their album, Aeonic, released January 4, 2019 from Mountain Home Music Company.\n\nMountain Overture\n\n2018\n\niTunes | Spotify | Amazon\n\nMountain Overture, from Mountain Home Music Company, takes the band’s most-loved songs and elevates them, pulling together the rustic and symphonic for a profound effect.\n\nThe music scores, arranged by Wes Funderburk and Shelley Washington lift the heartfelt tale of “Trains I Missed” (IBMA 2011 Song of the Year), intensify the sentimental longing of “Blue Mountain,” and draw out the melancholia of “I Hear the Mountains.”\n\nMountain Voodoo\n\n2016\n\niTunes | Spotify | Amazon\n\nNominated for three International Bluegrass Music Association (IBMA) Awards (Entertainer, Vocal Group, and Vocalist of the Year) for 2016, Balsam Range is offering something that is sure to continue to mesmerize fans of Bluegrass and beyond with their release of Mountain Voodoo.\n\nMountain Voodoo is like the book of life “Chapter Six” for Balsam Range; 13-tracks filled with songs of journey, home, sense of place, hardcore stomping drive, and longing. There are fiery instrumental parts alternating with heavy, deep ballads overlaid by the vocal harmonies the group has become known for.\n\nFive\n\n2014\n\niTunes | Spotify | Amazon\n\nThe band has a consistent knack for conveying emotion with power. The result is a heartfelt delivery of tributes to working class heroes, an original Gospel a cappella song, a pulsing instrumental, and even a John Denver classic. The group pulls from diverse influences and original sources while giving each track the Balsam Range treatment. Five is an album full of songs that have both drive and nuance. With the band’s level of success and their delivery of great albums, expectations are high. Balsam Range Five will not disappoint but continues to raise the bar for the best bluegrass of today.\n\nMarching Home\n\n2007\n\niTunes | Spotify | Amazon\n\nThe album features six great Bill Monroe songs and seven original tunes written by band members and by today’s premier songwriters. Marching Home grabs your attention from the start with the rocking bluegrasser “The Train’s Ready” as well as “Calloway County Flood” and fan favorite “Burning Georgia Down.” The band’s debut album Marching Home has been receiving rave reviews from fans and music critics throughout the music industry. The album was recently recorded in Arden, NC at Crossroads Studios and was produced by Jerry Salley, award winning songwriter.\n\nBuddy Melton\n\n2007\n\nAmazon\n\nBuddy’s debut solo album contains a fourteen song package with a tasteful mix of uncut gems and classic bluegrass tunes. Backed by a stellar instrumental cast that includes Tony Rice (guitar), Marc Pruett (banjo), Adam Steffey (mandolin) and Tim Surrett (upright bass), Buddy’s powerful tenor voice soars to unbelievable heights, and his tasty fiddle playing serves as the spice needed to complete the ensemble.\n\nStreamline Canonball\n\n1981\n\nDiscogs\n\nThis album is a Marc Pruett solo album. Marc has lived all his life in Haywood and Buncombe Counties, and he is dedicated to preserving the musical traditions of his native region. Pruett received a banjo for Christmas when he was eleven years old, after hearing Earl Scruggs on the radio and getting excited about the instrument. Over the next years he learned by observing and imitating local banjo players. He includes among his influences were local masters Mike Pressley, Raymond Fairchild, Shorty Eager, Roy Kirkpatrick, Howard Burnette, and Tom McKinney. This album is essential listening."
