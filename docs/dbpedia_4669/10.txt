The final two copies of the third Dis- record from 1996. More significant wear on these silkscreened covers, because these LPs are now old enough to vote so the price has been reduced. Sell it out!

Dis- broke up suddenly after the release of this album. This was the only Dis- full-length released in Lp format, following two compact discs for Twelve Inch records.

"The Historically Troubled Third Album" was without a doubt the strongest and most interesting Dis- collection, and it is a shame that things had to end for Dis- right in the middle of a period of time where they were becoming something very unique and compelling.
