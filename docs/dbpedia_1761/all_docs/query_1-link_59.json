        "text": "So how do you sterilize male mosquitoes ? with really small scissors ‚úÇÔ∏è :) At Senecio Robotics we are often asked how are the mosquitoes we release at people houses are sterilized. How do we cut the next generation. So, simplifying it, one of the options is using irradiation. Others, can be the use of a bacteria, called Wolbachia. Senecio process is indifferent to the sterilization method, and also a combination is possible. But coming back for a moment to irradiation - Basically, (completely different dose), that's why we protect ourselves when we go to the dentist... So, you can think of us, as the mosquito dentist, only on steroids... üòÄ And as we work on scaling and optimizing our factory production process to be streamlined and efficient, such that can quickly deployed at different sites, handling millions per week, the integration between the packing of mosquitoes, irradiation, and then shipping them are closely linked and we put efforts to be able to provide you with the highest quality of sterile male mosquitoes that we can. In the picture - myself and our mechanical guy, going wherever we need, learning about the different options out there, checking one such irradiator. #xray #sterile #technology #mosquito"
