        "text": "High priest of the Samaritan community\n\nThe Samaritan High Priest is the high priest (kohen gadol) of the Samaritan community in the Levant. According to Samaritan tradition, the office has existed continuously since the time of Aaron, the brother of Moses, and has been held by 133 priests over the last 3400 years. However, the historicity of this claim is disputed. One account by Josephus suggests that its office holders are an offshoot of the Zadokite high priests of Jerusalem from around the time of Alexander the Great.[1][2] As of 2013 , the incumbent high priest is Abdel V.\n\nOffice of the High Priest\n\n[edit]\n\nDuties and responsibilities\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Samaritan High Priest has the following duties in the present:[3]\n\nHe decides all religious law issues.\n\nHe presides over the religious ceremonies on Mount Garizim.\n\nHe validates all marriages and divorces within the Samaritan community.\n\nHe annually publishes the liturgical calendar of the Samaritans.\n\nHe confirms a joining of the Samaritan community.\n\nHe appoints the Cantors and the Shechita of the community.\n\nHe represents the Samaritan community to the outside world.\n\nLineage\n\n[edit]\n\nSince 1623/24, the office of high priest has been passed down in a family traced back to Aaron's grandson Itamar. After the death of a high priest, the office passes to the oldest male in that family, unless he has entered into a marriage that disqualifies him from the high priesthood.[3]\n\nIt appears, based upon the larger gaps in time between high priests, that several names might be missing, or that there were long periods of vacancy between priests.\n\nThe continuous lineage of Samaritan High Priests, descending directly from Aaron, through his son Eleazar, and his son Phinehas, was however disrupted in the early 17th century. In 1624, Shalma I ben Phinehas, the last Samaritan High Priest of the line of Eleazar son of Aaron died without male succession, but descendants of Aaron's other son, Ithamar, remained and took over the office.[4]\n\nThere are four families within the house of Ithamar. The Åbtå order, descended from the 113th High Priest Tsedaka ben Tabia, which has held the office of the High Priesthood since 1624; the House of Phineas a.k.a. Dār 'Åder, descended from Fīn'ās ban Yīṣ'å̄q (Phineas ben Isaac); Dār Yīṣ'å̄q, descended from Yīṣ'å̄q ban Åmrām (Isaac ben Amram); and Dār Yāqob, descended from Yāqob ban Årron (Jacob ben Aaron).\n\nPhotographs of Samaritan High Priests\n\nList of Samaritan High Priests\n\n[edit]\n\nPummer's list\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following list gives the names and terms of office according to Reinhard Pummer.[5] Pummer uses a spelling for the name of the high priest that is based on the English Bible for the bearers of biblical names, while he chooses a more scientific transcription for the full name (last column). The traditional counting begins with the first post-biblical high priest Sheshai. It differs in order in some cases from the list prepared by Moses Gaster and Reinhard Pummer on the basis of the ancient Samaritan sources, and includes additional names (italics here).\n\nTraditional Numbering High Priest Name Term Comments Civil name and life data Aaron I. (אהרן) Biblical figure, brother of Moses. He is considered in the Torah to be the \"ancestor of the legitimate Levitical-Aaronid priesthood.\"[6] Eleazar I. (אלעזר) Biblical figure, son of Aaron and his successor as high priest.[7] Phinehas I. (פינחס) Biblical figure, son of Eleazar. Because of his religious \"zeal\" he and his descendants are awarded a perpetual priesthood.[8] Abishua I. (אבישע) According to Samaritan tradition, Aaron's great-grandson[9] is said to have written down a Pentateuch scroll that is first mentioned by Abū l'Fatḥ in the 14th century and, in a very poor state of preservation, is kept by the Samaritan community as a precious possession. The Abisha Scroll is considered the original of all Samaritan Torah scrolls.[10] 1 Sashai ben Abishua 2 Bakhi ben Sashai probably identical to the Jewish High Priest Bukki 3 Uzzi ben Sashai According to Samaritan tradition, Uzzi hid the tent sanctuary of the desert migration (Mishkan) in a cave at Garizim when the Israelites introduced the cult at Shiloh, which was illegitimate from the Samaritan point of view.[11] 4 Shashai II ben Uzzi 5 Bakhi II ben Sashai 6 Shembet ben Bakhi who served at the shrine to God at Shechem alone 7 Shalom I ben Shembet 8 Hezekiah I ben Shalom 9 Jonathan I ben Abiathar (ben Hezekiah?) According to Samaritan tradition, he is said to have been a contemporary of King David.[12] (2 Samuel 15:27), served as a messenger during Absalom's rebellion (2 Samuel 15:36, 17:17) 10 Jair I ben Jonathan 11 Daliah I 12 Jair II ben Daliah In his time the Jerusalem temple is said to have been built.[12] 13 Jonathan II ben Jair 14 Ishmael ben Jonathan 15 Tabia I This high priest is said to have been murdered by the Ishmaelites.[13] 16 Zedekiah I 17 Ahid 18 Jair III 19 Jehozadak 20 Zadok (צדוק) 21 Amram I. (עמרם) 22 Hilkiah or Hezekiah II 23 Amram II. (עמרם) 24 Akkub 25 Akkubiah I According to the Samaritan chronicler Abū l'Fatḥ (14th century), Aqabiah was a contemporary of Nebuchadnezzar II and thus of the conquest of Jerusalem by the Babylonians (587 B.C.).[14] He is said to have been led into Babylonian exile with the Israelites.[13] 26 Hillel I 27 Seriah He is said to have returned with his people from exile.[13] 28 Levi I. (לוי) 29 Netaniel I 30 Azariah In the 10th year of his high priesthood he is said to have been captured by the Chaldeans.[13] 31 Aabed-El I This high priest returned from exile; in his time the Samaritan community is said to have had 300,000 members.[13] 32 Hezekiah III 33 Hananiah 34 Amram III. (עמרם) His son is said to have married the daughter of King \"Derus\"; according to tradition, the Samaritans made a riot and killed both of them.[13] 35 Hillel II/Hanan This high priest is said to have married the daughter of the king of Assyria and to have been killed by the Samaritans.[15] 36 Hezekiah IV According to the Samaritan historian Abū l'Fatḥ, Hezekiah was high priest when Alexander III of Macedonia defeated the Persian king Darius.[16] 37 Daliah II 38 Akkub II 39 Akkubiah II 40 Levi II. (לוי) 41 Eleazar II 42 Manasseh the son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite 43 Jair IV 44 Netaniel II 45 Joachim c. 4 BCE According to Samaritan tradition, Jesus of Nazareth was born during the tenure of Jehoiakim.[17] 46 Jonathan III c. 29 CE In his time Jesus is said to have been killed \"in the cursed Shalem\" (= Jerusalem).[15] 47 Elishama 48 Shemaiah 49 Tabia II 50 Amram IV. (עמרם) 51 Akabon I 52 Phinehas II 53 Levi III. (לוי) early 2nd century Emperor Hadrian (r. 117–138 CE) is said to have shown special favors to the Samaritans in the time of the high priest Levi III.[18] 54 Eleazar III 55 Baba I. (בבא) 56 Eleazar IV 57 Akabon II 58 Netaniel III 59 Baba II Rabba c. 308–\n\n328\n\nThe Samaritan reformer Baba Rabba was a historical figure (early 4th century CE). He organized synagogue construction, worship and community structure.[11] 60 Akabon III 61 Netaniel IV This high priest is said to have burned his maid at the stake because she fell in love with his son.[19] 62 Akabon IV 63 Eleazar V 64 Akabon V 65 Eleazar VI 66 Akabon VI late 6th century 67 Eleazar VII 68 Netaniel V early 7th century He is said to have been a contemporary of the \"cursed king Zinon.\"[19] 69 Eleazar VIII c. 630 Abū l'Fatḥ said Muhammad lived during his tenure.[20] 70 Netaniel VI 71 Eleazar IX 72 Akabon VII This high priest was drowned in the Jordan River according to tradition.[21] 73 Eleazar X 74 Akabon VIII 75 Eleazar XI 76 Akabon IX 77 Eleazar XII 78 Simeon (שמעון) In his time, \"Karozai the King of Assur\" (perhaps the Sassanid ruler Khosrow I or II) is said to have enlisted many Samaritans as soldiers. The Byzantine emperor Heraclius conquered the Holy Land. Then the Ishmaelites came and conquered all the cities, and the inhabitants of Caesarea Maritima were led into captivity.[21] 79 Levi IV. (לוי) 80 Phinehas III 81 Netaniel VII. (נתנאל) 82 Baba III.

(אהרן) 95 Tsedaka I 96 Amram V. (עמרם) 97 Aaron III. (אהרן) In his time the Samaritan synagogue of Shechem was built.[22] 98 Amram VI. (עמרם) 99 Uzzi II In his time, the Muslims took away from the Samaritans their synagogue and the \"piece of land\" in Shechem.[23] 100 Joseph I. (יוסף) This high priest also came from Damascus.[24] 101 Phinehas V His son Raban Abishah composed liturgical chants.[24] Pinḥas ben Josef, der Sohn des Vorigen. 102 Eleazar XVII. (אלעזר) 1362/63–1387 Eleazar ben Pinḥas ben Josef 103 Phinehas VI haNatzri (פינחס) This high priest was the son of the hymn writer Raban Abishah.[24] Pinḥas ben Abisha ben Pinḥas ben Josef 104 Abishua II.

(אלעזר) Eleazar ben Abisha ben Pinḥas 106 Itamar (איתמר) The high priest Itamar ben Aaron ben Itamar in Damascus was one of the scribes of a Pentateuch codex (Ms. London, British Library, Cotton Claudius B. viii).[25] 107 Amram VII. (עמרם) In his time Samaria was conquered and many Samaritans were captured and taken to Damascus, but the Samaritan community in Damascus bought them free.[23] 108 Uzzi III 109 Phinehas VII. (פינחס) In 1516, Ottoman rule began in Palestine. The total number of Samaritans at that time is given as 500 people who lived in Cairo, Gaza and Damascus in addition to Nablus. The census of 1538/39 mentions 29 Samaritan households in Nablus, from which a number of 178 persons can be estimated.[26] Pinḥas ben Eleazar 110 Eleazar XIX. (אלעזר) 1549–1595/96 In his time a ritual bath was built for the Samaritans in Shechem.[24] Eleazar ben Pinḥas 111 Phinehas VIII. (פינחס) 1595/96–1614/15 Pinḥas ben Eleazar 112 Shalma I ben Phinehas 1614/15–1623/24 With Shelemya, who was murdered,[27] ended the original high priestly dynasty, which traced itself back to Phinehas, the grandson of Aaron. Centuries later, the Samaritan community was still researching whether there might have been members of the Phinehas dynasty living in Europe.[27] Shelemia ben Pinḥas 113 Tsedaka II ben Tabia ha'Åbtå'i 1623/24–1650 Ṣadaqa II was the first high priest from the family that has been in office since then, tracing back to Itamar, the brother of Phinehas.[3] This family was considered Levitical until then; since it was the only surviving Levitical family, Levitical and Aaronid descent has been synonymous among the Samaritans since then.[27] Ṣadaqa ben Ṭabia Halevi 114 Yitzhaq I ben Tsedaka 1650–1694 Jiṣḥaq ben Ṣadaqa 115 Abram ben Yitzhaq 1694–1732 Abraham ben Jiṣḥaq ben Ṣadaqa 116 Levi V ben Abram 1733–1752 Levi ben Abraham 117 Tabia III ben Yitzhaq ben Abram 1752–1787 This high priest settled in the Samaritan community in Gaza.[28] Ṭabia ben Jiṣḥaq 118 Shalma II ben Tabia 1798–1828 Salama was four years old at his father's death and the only surviving member of the high priestly family. He assumed the office of high priest at the age of 15.[29] In 1810 he sent a letter to the French senator Henri Grégoire, in which he lamented the distressed situation of the Samaritans. Since 1785 it was no longer possible to offer the Passover sacrifice on the Garizim; it had to take place in the city.[30] Salama ben Ṭabia ben Jiṣḥaq (1784–1855) 119 Amram VIII ben Shalma 1828–1859/60 In 1832 the pilgrimages to Mount Garizim could be resumed.[30] In the 1840s, Muslim ulama demanded that all Samaritans be forcibly converted to Islam because they did not belong to any book religion. The Sephardic chief rabbi of Jerusalem produced an expert opinion that the Samaritans belonged to the people of Israel and lived according to the Torah. This (together with a gift of money) averted the danger from the Samaritan community.[31][32] Upon British intervention, the Passover sacrifice on Mount Garizim was again permitted by the Ottoman authorities in 1849.[33] 120 Yaacob I ben Aaharon ben Shalma 1859/60–1916 Jacob I promoted the opening to the West and to the Jewish community, seeing opportunities for the small Samaritan community in the interest of the world public.[34] Jaaqob ben Aharon ben Salama\n\n(1840/41–1916)\n\n121 Yitzhaq II ben Amram ben Shalma ben Tabia.
