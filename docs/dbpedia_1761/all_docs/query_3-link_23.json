        "text": "Advertisement\n\nSPONSORED:\n\nThis Is Amer-I-Can\n\nAuburn is a diverse community with many ethic and political differences. This is why individuals like Hanan Amer are so needed, tirelessly working to create safe, vibrant, and inclusive communities where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. Hanan Amer’s dedication serves as an inspiring example of how individuals can make a profound impact on their communities and society as a whole when you overcome adversity and serve people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBorn in Oklahoma and raised in Benghazi, Libya. Hanan Amer is Arabic, African, and American. She moved to Auburn in 2008 and married her husband who had been living in Auburn since the 90s. Together they raised two beautiful children who graduated from Auburn High School. Graduating herself from Benghazi University with a Bachelor’s Degree in Chemistry, Hanan has built her career here in Auburn working for many years at a large Aerospace Company.\n\nAlthough she was extremely lonely when she first moved here, having no friends, being profiled and excluded, she signed up for a class at the Auburn Senior Citizen’s Center titled “How to Write Your Life Story”. A classmate introduced her to volunteering. She took initiative and began investing in the community wherever she could. At the Auburn Food Bank, White River Valley Museum, United Way, Girl Scouts both the Auburn and Muckleshoot libraries and even with Auburn police doing clerical work so officers can focus on keeping the community safe.\n\n“It’s amazing the difference you can make when you help someone else,” says Amer. She obviously is no longer lonely but she is helping make this community safer, more vibrant, and inclusive everyday. This year marks 34 years of volunteering with the Girl Scouts and was recently awarded the Girl Scout Honor pin for outstanding service in Girl Scouts of Western Washington. She earned both Bronze and Gold President’s Service volunteer awards for her efforts with United Way.\n\nIn 2022, she was appointed by City of Auburn Mayor Nancy Backus, and approved by the city council, to serve on the City of Auburn Planning Commission to help Auburn better plan for the future. She has also had the privilege to serve on the Diversity Council. When she is not working, being a wife, a mom or volunteering, she loves to spend time with her bow and arrows doing some archery. She is a certified Level II USA archery instructor for the Girl Scouts. She may not always wear bows but she sure knows how to shoot them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHanan truly loves Auburn and her remarkable story is a testament to the power of one individual’s determination and vision. There is a reason she is an Amer-I-Can. Her dedication to providing opportunities for all, fostering vibrance, and advocating for better safety is transforming Auburn into a place where everyone has the chance to thrive. Amer’s work serves as an inspiring example of how overcoming adversity can create lasting positive change. Reminding us all that we have the capacity to build a better, more inclusive community for ourselves.\n\nTo discover how you can help Auburn thrive, please visit:\n\nhttps://www.voteamer.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE: Sponsored Posts like this are paid, “Native Advertisements” that help businesses and organizations improve their internet presence and all-important SEO.
