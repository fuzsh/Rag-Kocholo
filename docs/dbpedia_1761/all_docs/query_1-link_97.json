        "text": "05.\n\nLecture 7 THE HANAN-ROBSON ERA: 1960-1970: POLITICS 1955-60:\n\n Towards the end of the era, particularly from 1955 onwards, Barnett’s dreams of modernizing the prison system were destroyed by exploding prison numbers and limited funds/resources.  In 1957, the national party was defeated by Labour. Rex Mason was Labour’s mild- mannered but not highly effective Minister of Justice 1957-1960. Labour had been elected on a slim majority - couldn’t afford to take any risky actions.  There were no executions during Labour’s time in government even though capital punishment was still in legislation  Labour only lasted one term – until 1960. A major issue labour faced was law and order. In December 1960 the Hasting Blossom Festival Incident occurred – the first youth riot in NZ history. Publicity about riotous behaviour at the festival contributed to Labour’s defeat in the November election.  Between 1954-1960, reported crime doubled, with youth crime being a particular problem during the wild ‘rock’nroll’ era of youth  The first NZ chapter of the Hells Angels was established in 1960, the gang was officially recognised by HAMC clubs in California in 1961  Part of the emerging ‘Maori crime problem’ identified in the late 1950s was a result of post-war urbanisation. In 1945, only 16% of the Maori population lived in cities. By 1961 the figure had more than doubled, and by 1980 it had increased to 80%. In 1965 a Maori Community Centre was established in Auckland 1942, only 15% of all people sent to prison were Maori, by 1960 this was 26% and rising  Nationals promise to the public that was concerned about crime, was to control hooliganism and stop rising juvenile offending.\n\nHANAN-ROBSON INITIATIVES:\n\n Josiah Ralph Hanan a trained lawyer, was National’s liberal and highly-respected Minister of Justice 1960-1969. One of the most influential men in Parliament.  John Lochiel Robson served as Secretary for Justice, 1960-1970. Intelligent and equipped with a PhD in law from UCL, Robson was responsible for introducing a raft of progressive changes to the justice system during the 1960s.  Hanan’s first project as minister was to write the Crimes Act 1961. This Act aimed to consolidate and amend the Crimes Act 1908. The most notable act was s172, which abolished Capital punishment for murder  The next year, the non-parole minimum for murder was raised from 5-10 years imprisonment  Hanan-Robson also worked together to address the youth crime problem. The first step they took was activating the detention centre sentence – a fixed term of 3 months with 1 month remission for first offenders aged 16-21. It was a boot camp ‘shock incarceration’ for young first offenders. The first detention centre was Waikeria Borstal, opened in 1961  Secondly, they altered the Borstal sentence, reducing it to 0-2 years.  Waipiata Borstal, Central Otago, was established for redeemable first offenders in 1961 as a showpiece of the Hanan-Robson method.\n\n05.\n\nLecture 7  Wi Tako Prison, opened in 1919, was rebuilt in 1967 as a special institution for the treatment of adult first offenders. It was renamed Rimutaka Prison in 1990 and now serves as a general adult facility. The focus at Wi Tako was also rehabilitation  Parole for finite sentences was abolished in 1954 in favour of fixed remission, in 1967 this changed again, with the Parole Board coming in power to review all sentences of 6 years or over, after an inmate had served 3 years  In 1962, an amendment to the Penal Institutions Act, work parole was created. This allowed an inmate in the last 12 months of his sentence to be released during the day into the community to work for wages, and return to the prison at night. Some of these wages would be deducted to pay for his imprisonment, and support extended family members. This allowed a prisoner to establish an employment record before release and to be eased back into the community  In 1965, in order to help the families of men in prison and keep family relationships alive, 72 hours home leave was permitted to minimum security prisoners every 4 months, and reduced to every 2 months in 1975.  Hanan addressed the need for a non-custodial sentence for young offenders. This came with a sentence of Periodic Detention. Parnell Periodic Detention Centre, opened in 1963, was New Zealand’s first residential PD centre for juveniles. This was a punitive sentence that kept young men off the streets during the weekends  Non residential PD was extended to adult males in 1966 and to women in 1974, and was one of the most successful innovations of the decade. The notion of PD still exists today in the form of Community Work  The early 1960s was a period of intense legislative activity, a time when a serious, systematic and coordinated attempt was made to modernize the penal system and control the rise in crime, particularly regarding young people\n\nCRISIS PERIOD:\n\n Security at Mt Eden Prison left a lot to be desired. All Mt Eden had was cells, corridors and a visiting room, with no other facilities.  As a result of the scandals in 1955 and 1958, freedoms became increasingly restricted  The prison was understaffed, and the trustee system had disappeared, which made it hard for Haywood to keep in touch with what was going on at ground level. With few privileges and little to lose, problems with inmates began to escalate  Overcrowding was held responsible for a series of issues throughout the prison system in 1959. After Robson took over, he tightened procedures in an effort to gain control. At Mt Eden, difficulties continued.  Haywood was deeply affected by having to officiate at the 8 executions that took place at Mt Eden 1952-57. He began drinking heavily in order to cope with the stress from the hangings, and by 1960 he was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Haywood’s gradual loss of control was reflected in a rising number of escapes and disturbances at Mt Eden.\n\nESCAPES:\n\n05.\n\nLecture 7  Once back at the prisons while in the bathrooms, Evans gave Gilles the shotgun, who turned it around on the prison guard and commanded him to open the cells. The men then got outside, got a prison truck, and escaped onto Mt Eden road.  As they escaped, the sentry tower guard aimed a round at the truck – luckily missing the officer taken hostage  They took some innocent members of the public hostage. This became the Armed Offenders Squad’s first call out – eventually the inmates surrendered after negotiation for a bottle of whiskey. The men were arrested and then given the whiskey.\n\nMT EDEN PRISON RIOT:\n\n Bank robber and remand prisoner Daniel ‘Cosmo’ MacMillan, along with Cook Islander Jon Sadaraka, started the 1965 Mt Eden riot following a failed escape attempt. The riot was initiated by a pistol the men managed to smuggle into the remand room. Once they were out of the cells, they planned to take a prison officer hostage and escape this way. They badly beat one of the guards, and another guard heard the noise and came to help, the men fired multiple rounds at him as he ran. The guard then locked the grille doors and raised the alarm – meaning they could no longer escape.  The men went downstairs, unlocked all the security risks in the separates division, and then all of the other prisoners.  Dirk Gilles set fire to the curtains in the chapel, this fire spread to the prison, burning the thick oil based paint of the walls, and the tar infused pine of the ceilings. The heat was so fierce, the steel cell doors began to buckle. The fire brigade arrived, and a fireman was knocked out by an extinguisher thrown by a prisoner. This meant the fire brigade withdrew their hoses and refused to work. In the end, the jail was contained so no one could escape, and let the fire and the riot burn out.  3 days later, the inmates ran out of food, and with no electricity they were left cold and wet and surrendered. Mt Eden Prison was left unusable for a number of months and spelt the end its maximum security days. Those who were doing short term sentences or close to release were released immediately, and the rest were distributed around NZ.  The riot spelt the end of Hanan and Robson’s reformative programme, as there was little time and money to spend on anything but the new maximum security prison\n\nPAREMOREMO:\n\n From 1965 onwards, a new maximum security prison was commissioned. Paremoremo Prison was the most technologically advanced, secure prison in the world. It was based on a telegraph pole construction pattern.  4 months after opening, Ralph Hanan died suddenly. In March 1970, Robson retired at the compulsory retirement age, thus ending a 20 year period in which NZ corrections had evolved into a modern system."
