        "text": "These photos represent a perspective of typical Jewish families of Rhodes. In many photos, you will notice the distinctive foreground of the graceful stone mosaic floors called “sheshikus” used throughout Rhodes’s Old City. These stones were used to pave the streets and flooring of the homes, shops, and even the synagogues.\n\nThe poses may appear to be more “stiff” than normal. That was because the camera lens was required to remain open for at least a few seconds—so the photographer would say the equivalent of, “OK, hold still.”\n\nThe men wore the “fez” which was the customary Turkish headwear, salvar (long wide trousers) and entari (robe). The women often wore the sayo (tunic or robe), entari (dress), jube (overcoat lined with fur) and the traditional head cover, called the “tokado”. A “rozeta” (ornamental pin) was fastened in the front center of the “tokado” which symbolized the woman’s married status.\n\nThe family photos also illustrate the fashion transition; it shows the change in European clothing styles. Older family members tended to dress in the costume of the Turkish traditions, while the younger family members would adopt the more European styles. The younger women wore shorter dress lengths, and some started wearing high heels and new hairstyles of curls and waves."
