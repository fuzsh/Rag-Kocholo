It appears that a school teacher by the name of Tom Howard, armed with a gun called at the home of a farmer named Ed Gill, whom he found at the barn. Upon seeing Howard approach with the weapon in his hands Gill ran into the barn, but came out in a short time upon Howard's assurance that he would not be harmed. As he emerged from the door, Howard seized a pitchfork that was standing against the side of the barn and plunged it into Gill's body, killing him almost instantly. After committing the murder, Howard fled, but was followed a short time after by a posse of neighbors, well armed and who are said to have been close upon the fugitive just before dark set in.
