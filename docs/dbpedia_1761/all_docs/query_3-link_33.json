Another mention is Aditya Mehrotra, graduate student at MIT, but rather more lead behind the Hydrogen and Electric project at MIT. Yes there are a body of undergraduates and graduates, working on hydrogen powered vehicles #greentechnology But also one thing that I have been thinking is, he is from Mechanical Engineering and hence true also that he can be the man behind vehicles. But rather what more awkward is, why doesn't our top college UGs and grads of mechanical think some same. Why ain't the news from IIT/NIT? We need to address this question. Well there are mentions after long time about the Hyperloop by IITM and I really loved it. And to the students here, and myself, it's our future and world to build now. We are the innovators and creators, and we got to use this oppurtunity not just for writing code for some firm, rather developing something truly ours. Prof. V Ramgopal Rao sir what are your thoughts on it? #innovation #education #mit #hydrogen #greenFuture Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nüå± Meet our DC's! Who üë®üéì : Hiva Hormozi Hosted by üèõ : HSB Hochschule Bremen ‚Äì City University of Applied Sciences, Albert Baars Fromüåé: Iran \"I was born and raised in Iran, where I developed a deep fascination for engineering and technology from a young age. I was mesmerized by the idea of positively impacting the world, which inspired me to pursue my B.Sc. and M.Sc. studies in mechanical engineering at K.N. Toosi University of Technology, one of the most prestigious universities in my country. During my B.Sc., I developed an unwavering passion for fluid mechanics, and this passion continued to flourish during my M.Sc. studies. Taking courses such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and multiphase flow simulations became the cornerstone of my master's thesis, and I was privileged to address a real-world problem and fulfill a lifelong dream. The global COVID-19 pandemic was a pressing issue at the time, and preventing infection in densely enclosed spaces became imperative. Consequently, I felt a sense of duty to dedicate my thesis to investigating cough particle dispersion within an aircraft cabin. The results marked a significant milestone in my academic journey, confirming my passion for research and solidifying my commitment to pursuing a Ph.D. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to work as a teaching assistant for numerous B.Sc. and M.Sc. courses. This experience allowed me to discover my enthusiasm for teaching and mentoring. Pursuing my childhood dream, my vision is to secure a professorship position. I believe working in academia would enable me to continue enhancing people's quality of life through cutting-edge research while nurturing the potential of future students.\" #Nature4Nature #msca #doctoralcandidate #mariecurie #bioinspiration #computationalfluiddynamics\n\nPhD Studentship now accepting applications: Aerospace Al alloy cold spray coating performance under corrosion and subsequent environments at University of Southampton PhD Supervisor: Philippa Reed Project description: Cold spray is a repair process that can be considered an additive repair process, whereby metal powder particles are impacted at high speed in a carrier gas, at relatively low temperatures, so the repaired surface layer is formed by extreme deformation rather than melting and solidification. The evolving microstructures and the residual stress states between the substrate and new coating layer mean CS structures are not currently used in highly stressed locations as their mechanical performance is not well understood. A better understanding of how the micromechanical processes in this layered system control in particular corrosion interactions is needed. This is part of a larger research project supported by Airbus Operations, in collaboration with Coventry University. This project will use advanced microstructural characterization techniques (SEM, EBSD, EDX, TEM and X-ray CT) to analyse the evolution of the CS microstructure and defect distributions, and will also investigate full field experimental mechanics approaches (e.g. EC-AFM) to evaluate strain evolution and corrosion processes under fatigue loading and in the presence of unloaded corrosion service conditions. https://lnkd.in/ecv3Nhhr\n\nLast semester, I participated in the Mechanical Engineering exchange program in Germany between Purdue University Mechanical Engineering and Leibniz Universit√§t Hannover. I took several very interesting advanced or master's level courses, including Advanced Thermodynamics, Biophotonics, and Photonics and Multiphysics Simulation courses. These courses placed a strong emphasis on theories and their real-life applications. After taking these classes, I began to notice the inventions in my surroundings and appreciated how they could be applied and created with the engineering knowledge I gained in class. Additionally, I feel fortunate to work on two research projects at Institut F√ºr Mehrphasenprozesse, which exposed me to interdisciplinary engineering projects in the healthcare industry. These courses and research projects introduced me to topics such as in-depth engine cycles, optical microscopy, medical devices, and cryopreservation. I also honed my technical skills in simulating fluids and optics with ANSYS Fluent and ANSYS Lumerical. Last but not least, my exchange experience at LUH allowed me to meet many local and Erasmus students, further enhancing my intercultural competence. Studying abroad helped me grow academically, professionally, and personally. Shout out to Joe Tort (Purdue GEARE), Stephen Sechrist, and Purdue Study Abroad for providing this incredible study abroad opportunity. My time in Hannover, Germany was filled with unforgettable memories. #studyabroad #Germany #Hannover #research #cryopreservation #ANSYS #simulations\n\nI started my PhD at UNSW during the peak of COVID, which ultimately led to me getting stuck in India (my home country) for nearly a year of my PhD tenure. When I finally reached Australia in early December 2021, I faced another six months of struggles due to the aftereffects of COVID on my resource availability. There were many ups and downs in my personal and family life, mostly downs, and ongoing challenges. But now, within the next 2-3 months, I will finally be submitting my PhD thesis,...... a bitter-sweet journey but without regret I regret many decisions I made over the last four years, but I can safely say I don‚Äôt regret pursuing my PhD or my research interests. I applied to my supervisor back in January 2020 with my novice ideas, thinking I loved electrochemical and solid-state chemistry, and solid-state batteries seemed like the best place for me. At that point, it felt like a sense of adventure, and now, looking back, I would say I chose this out of love. Each battery I make in that 12 mm diameter nylon/PEEK die, pressed under extra-hardened steel, makes me love the concept of all-solid-state batteries and solid-state electrochemistry even more. I was the only one in the group working towards the fundamental development of the CEI engineering. In my supervisor's words, I was a \"one-man army.\" This didn‚Äôt result in a long list of publications, and honestly, my output is lackluster compared to many of my peers in battery research. But it always challenged me to rethink every electrochemical technique I ever applied, and I take pride in that. Now, at the end of my student life and on the brink of my first venture into the real world, whether as a postdoc or a battery engineer in industry, I am understandably anxious. However, I am proud that the path I chose to think about every night, cry over, or be fascinated by during my PhD was a conscious decision I made four years ago. I wanted to share this feeling, especially with all my fellow battery researchers and others. Whether I become successful by the number of publications or by my h-index is still a long journey for me. But I will never regret doing a PhD. I owe it to my supervisors, my peers, my girlfriend, my parents and the many professors and researchers whose publications and passion for their subjects never made me regret this path.\n\nAt IIT Madras, one of the best decisions I took is to starting doing research after my 2nd year itself. At that time, it was not an easy decision to take. All my peers were busy chasing positions of responsibilities: - Co-ordinator at the tech festival of IIT Madras - Event manager of the sponsorship club - Volunteer at the culture festival of IIT Madras No one was interested to do research. I remember thinking at that time: \"Am I making a mistake by starting to do research so early\"? 2 years later, that decision of doing research early got me an admit at MIT. It also got me admits at Stanford, Purdue, Michigan, UIUC and CMU. Amongst my batch of mechanical engineering, I was the only one to have a publication in the prestigious \"Journal of Fluid Mechanics\". That made all the difference. For grad school applications, building a strong research profile is one of the most important things you should start doing. The earlier you start, the better. Me, Rajat Dandekar and Sreedath Panat are conducting a webinar on Wednesday, Jan 31 at 7pm. The webinar will be titled \"Building a strong research profile to get into top universities\".
