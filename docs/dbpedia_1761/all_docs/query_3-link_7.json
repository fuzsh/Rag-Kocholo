        "text": "New Zealand politician\n\nWilliam Mortimer Clarence Denham (August 1888 – 21 September 1969) was a New Zealand politician of the Labour Party.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly life and career\n\n[edit]\n\nDenham was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, in August 1888,[1] and was educated both there and in Melbourne.[2] He shifted to New Zealand in 1907 and settled in Invercargill working as a farmer and later as a tramway worker. For 12 years he was an employee representative to the Tramways Appeal Board.[2]\n\nPolitical career\n\n[edit]\n\nNew Zealand Parliament Years Term Electorate Party 1935–1938 25th Invercargill Labour 1938–1943 26th Invercargill Labour 1943–1946 27th Invercargill Labour\n\nDenham began his political career in local-body affairs. He was elected to the Invercargill City Council in 1928 and was also a member of the Southland Technical College Board.[2]\n\nDenham first stood for Parliament in 1928 in the Awarua electorate, placing third.[4] He then unsuccessfully contested the Invercargill electorate in the 1931 election; of the three candidates, he came last.[5] He represented the Invercargill electorate in the House of Representatives from 1935 to 1946, when he was defeated. He was defeated twice more for the seat in the 1949 and 1954 general elections. While an MP he legislated for the establishment of the Invercargill Licensing Trust in 1944 and advocated for a special fund for writers, resulting in the formation of the Literary Grants Advisory Board.\n\nIn 1947 he stood for the Invercargill mayoralty against incumbent Abraham Wachner. Denham polled respectably but was defeated by a margin of 997 votes.[7]\n\nLater life and death\n\n[edit]\n\nDenham later became chairman of the Invercargill Savings Bank. He died on 21 September 1969 at the age of 81. He is buried at Invercargill's Eastern Cemetery, along with his wife Gwendolyn who died 1 January 1971, and his mother-in-law Ada Meadows.[8]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nGustafson, Barry (1986).
