        "text": "A cancer patient who spent nine weeks in a coma during pregnancy is celebrating the birth of her daughter.\n\nBeth Paterson, 30, from Basingstoke, Hampshire, was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma which spread from her chest to her brain, rendering her unconscious.\n\nShe successfully completed chemotherapy in her unresponsive state, while hospital staff monitored the effect of the treatment on her unborn child.\n\nMs Paterson said she woke up aware of her pregnancy, even though she had lost memories, mobility and speech.\n\nShe recalled: \"I just knew I was still pregnant because my mum said even though I wasn't fully conscious, I still had my hand on my stomach.\"\n\nBaby Isabella was born prematurely in March at 31 weeks and five days.\n\nMs Paterson said health workers initially put her symptoms in October 2023 down to morning sickness.\n\nHowever, her rapid weight loss, fatigue and visual hallucinations led to her hospital admission and eventual cancer diagnosis.\n\nA complication of encephalopathy caused her to fall unconscious in the 16th week of pregnancy, the hospital said.\n\nLymphoma nurse Lauren Duhig, who cared for Ms Paterson, said she had never given chemotherapy to a pregnant woman before.\n\nShe said: \"We really did think of Beth and the unborn child before we did anything.\"\n\nSpecialists in neurology, oncology and obstetrics held weekly meetings to coordinate treatment, Ms Duhig added.\n\nMs Paterson said she was now in remission from cancer.\n\nThe mother of three said she was slowly regaining her strength and short-term memory, while making up for lost time with her two young sons."
