        "text": "Brigadier Duncan MacIntyre CMG DSO OBE ED PC (10 November 1915 – 8 June 2001) was a New Zealand politician of the National Party. He served as Deputy Prime Minister from 1981 to 1984 under Prime Minister Robert Muldoon.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nMacIntyre was born at Hastings on 10 November 1915.[1] He received his education at Christ's College, Christchurch. He was a farmer from 1933 to 1939, when he joined the New Zealand Army.\n\nMilitary career[]\n\nMacIntyre served in World War II in Australia, the Middle East, and Italy, and commanded the Māori Battalion. He was made a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order. After the war, he was commander for troops in Japan.[4] MacIntyre commanded the Divisional Cavalry Regiment from 1945 to 1946.[5]\n\nIn the 1956 New Year Honours, MacIntyre was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (Military Division).[6]\n\nMember of Parliament[]\n\nParliament of New Zealand Years Term Electorate Party 1960–1963 33rd Hastings National 1963–1966 34th Hastings National 1966–1969 35th Hastings National 1969–1972 36th Hastings National 1975–1978 38th Bay of Plenty National 1978–1981 39th East Cape National 1981–1984 40th East Cape National\n\nMacIntyre represented the Hastings electorate in Parliament from 1960 to 1972, when he was defeated. With Robert Muldoon and Peter Gordon he was one of the three Young Turks of the National Party who entered Parliament in 1960.[4]\n\nIn 1961 he was one of ten National MPs to vote with the Opposition and remove capital punishment for murder from the Crimes Bill that the Second National Government had introduced. In 1971 and 1972 MacIntyre was Administrator of Tokelau.\n\nHe then represented the Bay of Plenty electorate in Parliament from 1975 to 1978, and the East Cape electorate from 1978 to 1984, when he retired. His son, Hamish MacIntyre, was elected to Parliament in 1990.\n\nHe served under three Prime Ministers (Holyoake, Marshall, and Muldoon) as Cabinet Minister. He was Minister of Lands (1966–1972), Minister of Forests (1966–1972), Minister of Māori Affairs (1969–1972 and 1975–1978), Minister of Island Territories (1969–1972), Minister of Island Affairs (1972), Minister for the Environment (1972), Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (1975–1977), Minister of Agriculture (1977–1984), and Minister of Fisheries (1978–1984). He was made a Privy Councillor in 1980.[8]\n\nIn September 1980 MacIntyre gave a Marginal Land Boards loan to his daughter and son-in-law raising questions around Conflict of interest. A public inquiry later concluded that MacIntyre had not acted willfully improperly. Nonetheless, several public resignations of National Party officeholders followed in MacIntyre's East Cape electorate causing serious damage to MacIntyre's reputation.\n\nIn the 1992 Queen's Birthday Honours, MacIntyre was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, for public services.[10]\n\nLater life[]\n\nBy 1982, MacIntyre had a serious heart problem.[4] He died at Waipukurau on 8 June 2001.[1] Ngāti Kahungunu held him in such high regard for his conduct as Māori Affairs Minister that his body was at their Porangahau Marae for one night before the funeral. He was survived by his second wife Jaqueline MacIntyre (Gilbertson),[11] daughters and a son.[4]\n\nNotes[]\n\nReferences[]\n\nGustafson, Barry (1986).
