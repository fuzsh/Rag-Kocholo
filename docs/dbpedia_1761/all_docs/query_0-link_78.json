Today we are digitizing photos from 1905-1909. Lots and lots of images.\n\nAs my instavideo shows, the above dance card -- from a dance at her sorority in Chi Omega -- comes from her senior year in 1908-09. She tongue-in-cheek writes below the dance card, “‘Tis not the first time.\"\n\nHa, ha, Ava.\n\nHere's a little window into our socialite: She danced. A lot.\n\nBack in the day, women kept small booklets known as \"dance cards.\"\n\nThe cards were handed out at specific dances. Women recorded who they danced with and what dances they shared. Some dance cards even have small pencils attached via ribbon (!). They're adorably cute and small. I plan to blog more about them soon.\n\nFor Ava, her dance cards are incredibly detailed. She kept really, really good notes. (Notice how she even wrote the fraternity letters next to each beau? Kind of amazing.)\n\nAnd, it's no wonder that her waist was so small ... by my counts she danced roughly forty times a week.\n\nThe next time I hit up a dance club in Madison, I think I'll bring a dance card along and fill it out. What do you think?\n\nThis project is part of a practicum conducted by School of Library & Information Studies master’s candidate Megan Costello. (You can follow her along as she documents some of the more candid snapshots at Megan in (UW)-Madison or on Twitter at @meggo_costello.)"
