        "text": "The Academic Senate of PCC represents the faculty of the Pasadena Area Community College District. Our primary function is to make recommendations with respect to academic and professional matters.\n\nOur purpose is to represent the District's faculty in negotiations with the Board of Trustees and in the development and implementation of all college-wide policies and procedures of interest and concern to the faculty, to strengthen the role that faculty plays in the governance processes, to participate in the process of developing the educational philosophy along with the objectives, plans, and budgets of the District and to provide a forum for the faculty to discuss, debate, and formulate formal faculty opinions and resolutions both on academic and professional matters and on other issues of concern.\n\nPublic Comment\n\nPublic comment can be submitted via email to academicsenate@pasadena.edu and submissions will be read aloud in their entirety at the public meeting. Such submissions must be received prior to the start of the board meeting.\n\nThe guidelines for the time and quantity of public comment remain effect.\n\nSenate Board\n\nThe Academic Senate's primary function is to make recommendations with respect to academic and professional matters.\n\nSenate Committees\n\nThe senate has established committees, composed of PCC faculty. Our standing committees investigate issues of either a legislative or academic and professional nature, and provide recommendations for the Academic Senate Boardâ€™s consideration. Our operational committees are responsible for performing the academic and professional duties and responsibilities of the Senate. Finally, our Ad Hoc Committees are temporary committees formed to address specific issues or tasks that do not fall under the purview of another standing committee."
