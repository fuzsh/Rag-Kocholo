        "text": "Parliament of New Zealand Years Term Electorate Party 1969–1972 36th Invercargill National\n\nJohn Guy Chewings (14 April 1920 – 12 September 1994) was a New Zealand politician of the National Party.\n\nBiography[]\n\nChewings was born in 1920 at Invercargill. He received his education at Waitaki Boys' High School. During World War II, he was a flying instructor for the Royal New Zealand Air Force. He later took up farming in Mossburn.[2]\n\nChewings was selected on 17 September 1969 as the National Party candidate for the Invercargill electorate in the 1969 election, following the death of Ralph Hanan in July.[2] He represented Invercargill until 1972, when he was defeated. He was one of four National Party incumbents from Otago and Southland who lost their normally blue electorate to the Labour challenger over the proposed raising of the lake levels of lakes Manapouri and Te Anau, which was opposed by the Save Manapouri campaign. Labour's election manifesto was for the lakes to remain at their natural levels.[4]\n\nThe year after his defeat, he moved to Whangarei. In 1990, Chewings was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal.[5]\n\nNotes[]\n\nReferences[]\n\nGustafson, Barry (1986). The First 50 Years : A History of the New Zealand National Party.
