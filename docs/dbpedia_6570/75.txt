The Pang Brothers (Oxide & Danny) first Hollywood film THE MESSENGERS is much like most of their other films â a moody, atmospheric ghost picture done extremely well. Unlike director Takashi Shimizuâs JU-ON/THE GRUDGE films, which rely only on atmosphere and mood for scares, the Pang Brothers rely on suspense and shock like the majority of Americaâs most influential horror film directors, so, they should fit right in here in the states. Much of what made their film THE EYE a disturbing film is present here but unlike their previous films this film is set on a farm with lots of open exterior shots, which makes for a more interesting palette for the brothers to craft the film in.

The barn as well as the over grown sunflower patch are truly haunting locations and the basement of the house itself harbors dark secrets that should not be opened. Kristen Stewart as Jess experiences the bulk of the ghostly phenomena to great effect. This film is definitely a step up for the actress who was previous seen in PANIC ROOM and ZATHURA. Itâs also good to see Dylan McDermott back in a genre film, not seen since 1990âs HARDWARE, and Penelope Ann Miller, not seen since THE RELIC. Both are great additions to the cast.

The only deterrent of the film is The X-Files alumni William B. Davis who has two or three minor scenes before disappearing. He has nothing to do in the film and was a waste. Another problem with the film is the lack of motivational logic that while youâre watching you never really notice or feel until the end when everything is finally revealed

and youâre left scratching your head, but then again many people have the same problem with THE EYE and JU-ON and THE GRUDGE and generally most Asian ghost films. Maybe we arenât meant to fully understand.
