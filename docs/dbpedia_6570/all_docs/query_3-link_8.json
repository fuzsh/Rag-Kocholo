        "text": "RYAN: “The Messenger” is a new little indie movie from a first-time director starring Woody Harrelson, Samantha Morton and one of my favorite actors, Ben Foster.\n\nCAROLINE: Why do you like him so much again?\n\nRYAN: He’s a very intense, subtle actor who I think is totally underrated. And I think he’s hot.\n\nCAROLINE: Ah yes, there’s that.\n\nRYAN: This is a juicy role for him. He plays a soldier who’s forced to work as the dude who goes door to door telling families that their son or daughter was killed overseas.\n\nCAROLINE: Oh, that has to be the worst job ever.\n\nRYAN: Exactly. But it does make for some truly original drama. Those scenes were the best in the film. I actually had wished there were more of them.\n\nCAROLINE: You’re a sadist. Sadly, I didn’t get to see this one with you. What’s the rest of the movie about?\n\nRYAN: There’s just a lot of back story for Ben’s and Woody’s characters, their new, awkward friendship and their baggage.\n\nCAROLINE: How’s Samantha Morton?\n\nRYAN: Good. Doughy.\n\nCAROLINE: [laughs’ She’s a real woman. And such a good actress.\n\nRYAN: Oh wait. Jena Malone is also in it. I’ve loved her since seeing her play young Jodie Foster in one of my all-time favorite films, “Contact.”\n\nCAROLINE: Right, her. I think of her as the girls from “Stepmom.”\n\nRYAN: She goes topless in this and I so wasn’t prepared.\n\nCAROLINE: Are you ever though, really?"
