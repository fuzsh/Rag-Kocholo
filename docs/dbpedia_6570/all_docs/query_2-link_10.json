Soon after arriving, teenage Jess (Kristen Stewart) and her younger brother see terrifying apparitions and endure attacks from a supernatural source. Jess must warn her disbelieving family before it is too late to save them.",

        "text": "Been awhile since I saw this.\n\nDidn't remember much about it other than it has Kristen Stewart, lots of crows, and a creepy dark house.\n\nHad fun watching it again.\n\nThat lil boy was so adorable.\n\nJohn Corbett plays a good psycho.\n\nüåª\n\nI wanted to revisit this one because I know I saw it before my drug-fueled heyday and I still couldn‚Äôt really remember any of it. It turns out that‚Äôs because it really isn‚Äôt anything special.\n\nThe story is really familiar with a family from the city relocating to the country only to discover their house is haunted. Aside from one beautifully tense ghost scene, it‚Äôs hard to believe the guys who made the original The Eye also made this. That one had such awesome atmosphere, but this one was pretty much devoid of everything that made that one great. It‚Äôs way too polished for a haunted house movie. I mean, it looks great and is well made, but it‚Äôs all just too ‚Äúclean‚Äù if that makes sense? Anyway, Dylan McDermott never fails me, but John Corbett was so hysterically miscast it was distracting. Cool basement tho!\n\nSince 2017 is coming to a close soon, I‚Äôve decided to revisit some genre flicks from 10 years ago that I don‚Äôt have much recollection of/want to give enough shot.\n\nMy only memory of this was ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a lot of crows‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs fine if you‚Äôre into that mid 2000‚Äôs pale ghost kinda thing, but I don‚Äôt see myself revisiting this again anytime soon. Yet again, my only real memory after just finishing this is still ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a lot of crows‚Äù.\n\nI do remember the sequel had a scarecrow in it, I can jive with that."
