        "text": "THE MESSENGER, Directed by Su Rynard\n\nIn ancient times humans looked to the flights and songs of birds to foretell the future.\n\nToday once again the birds have something to tell us.\n\nSynopsis\n\nSu Rynard’s wide-ranging and contemplative documentary THE MESSENGER explores our deep-seated connection to birds and warns that the uncertain fate of songbirds might mirror our own. Moving from the northern reaches of the Boreal Forest to the base of Mount Ararat in Turkey to the streets of New York, THE MESSENGER brings us face-to-face with a remarkable variety of human-made perils that have devastated thrushes, warblers, orioles, tanagers, grosbeaks and many other airborne music-makers.\n\nOn one level, THE MESSENGER is an engaging, visually stunning, emotional journey, one that mixes its elegiac message with hopeful notes and unique glances into the influence of songbirds on our own expressions of the soul. On another level, THE MESSENGER is the artful story about the mass depletion of songbirds on multiple continents, and about those who are working to turn the tide.\n\nIn ancient times humans looked to the flight and songs of birds to protect the future. Today once again, birds have something to tell us."
