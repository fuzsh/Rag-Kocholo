        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Warner Bros Pictures has acquired Shannon Messenger’s bestselling book series Keeper of the Lost Cities, with Emma Watts set to produce.\n\nMessenger’s series focuses on Sophie, a telepathic girl who must figure out why she is the key to a world that exists side by side with our own. She must do this before dark forces find the answer first, putting both worlds in jeopardy.\n\nWith nine installments and over 7 million copies sold worldwide so far, Messenger continues Sophie’s saga with the next installment, Unraveled, which will be published on November 12, 2024.\n\nWhile the former production topper at Fox and Paramount has been in the mix for several of the big jobs in the past few years, it is easy to see how Watts can flourish in the role of producer of a literary property with franchise potential for Warner Bros. As an executive, she has shown a great eye for material, and shepherded such large-canvas projects as The Kingsman, Maze Runner, Deadpool, Bohemian Rhapsody, The Martian, Logan and Avatar.\n\nMessenger will serve as EP on the project. The deal for Messenger was brokered by Joel Vanderkloot of Vanderkloot Law; CAA; and Laura Rennert at Andrea Brown Literary Agency."
