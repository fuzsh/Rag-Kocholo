        "text": "Stories and movies about angels are captivating and convicting. They are sprinkled throughout history and in modern media as people recount seeing or being assisted by angels during difficult times.\n\nThe Bible mentions angels more than 500 times and are defined as beings and messengers that can assist others. Hebrews 1:14 (NIV) says:\n\n“Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?”\n\nMany people believe that guardian angels watch over them and protect them from harm. Many Christians even refer to real people as angels when they help them through difficult times. Through faith, we believe that God can inspire our friends or family to be there in our time of need. While you may not have wings or a halo, God can quietly encourage you to be in the right place, at the right time for someone who needs your help.\n\nAre There Movies About Angels?\n\nYou might be asking yourself if there are any movies about angels?
