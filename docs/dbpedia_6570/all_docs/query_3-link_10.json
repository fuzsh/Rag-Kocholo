When she awakes, she finds herself somehow connected to four strangers who collapsed at the same time: Erin, a young woman trying to protect her daughter from an abusive ex-husband; Peter, a troubled high-school student; Raul, a federal agent trying to evade an undercover assignment; and Joshua Jr., a second-generation televangelist. And all of them awake with unexplained powers.",
