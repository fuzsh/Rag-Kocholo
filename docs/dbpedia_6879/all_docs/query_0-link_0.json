        "text": "Carl Braden, former executive director of the Southern Conference Education Fund, who since 1971 had led the Training Institute for Propaganda and Organizing in Louisville, Ky., died of a heart attack last Tuesday in Louisville. He was 60 years old.\n\nMr. Braden, who left a Roman Catholic seminary in Louisville at the age of 16 to become a newspaper reporter, had worked for newspapers there and in Cincinnati and aided union groups.\n\nHe and his wife, the former Anne McCarty, were indicted for sedition under a Kentucky law in 1954 after they bought a house and sold it to a black couple. The indictments were dismissed in 1956, and Mr. Braden soon joined the Southern Conference Education Fund, which was working for blackwhite cooperation in civil rights.\n\nThe Bradens were indicted again for sedition in 1967 after Pike County officials found “a truckload of seditious material.” They were accused of seeking to spread “the Communist theory… to overthrow the government of Pike County.” The case ended after the United States Supreme Court ruled in the Steve Nelson case that state sedition laws were unconstitutional."
