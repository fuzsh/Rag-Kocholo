        "text": "Carl Braden (1914-1975) and Anne McCarty Braden (1924-2006) were journalists and activists known for their social justice work, particularly with the Civil Rights Movement, during the mid-20th century.\n\nCarl and Anne met while working for the Louisville (KY) Times and married in 1948. They began working together to fight racial and social injustice, causes they dedicated their lives to. After writing for several newspapers in Kentucky, Carl and Anne were eventually blacklisted from employment due to their activism. They began working as field organizers for the Southern Conference Educational Fund (SCEF) and published a monthly newspaper for the organization, The Southern Patriot.\n\nIn 1958, Anne published The Wall Between, a memoir of race relations in the U.S. south. The story was based on the Bradens' experience helping an African-American family purchase a home in the height of Jim Crow housing practices for which Carl was convicted with sedition. Anne's book received high praise from civil rights leaders and was a runner-up for the National Book Award.\n\nCarl and Anne had three children: James (b. 1951); Anita (b. 1953); and Elizabeth (b. 1960). Following Carl's death in 1975, Anne continued her activism and taught civil rights history at the University of Louisville and Northern Kentucky University. In 1990, she received the Roger Baldwin Medal of Liberty. Anne Braden died on March 6, 2006 in Louisville, Kentucky."
