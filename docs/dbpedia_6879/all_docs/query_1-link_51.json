        "text": "Geraldine Langford was born on March 30, 1947 in Monroe, Michigan. She was one of three beautiful children born to the union of U.G. and Grace (Reed) Langford. Geraldine attended Lincoln School in Monroe.\n\nOn May 28, 1963, in Toledo, Ohio Geri married the love of her life, Mr. Carl Braden and together the couple would raise two wonderful daughters: Lisa and Carla. In addition to caring for the needs of her family, Geraldine worked as a secretary at Tecumseh Products for more than thirty years. She retired in 2002.\n\nGeri loved music. Whether she was singing, playing the guitar, or dancing she had a smile on her face and was entertaining to those in her presence. Her public presentations usually involved country music at the infamous Braden’s Beach.\n\nGeri and Carl often spent time together playing the slot machines at two of their favorite destinations: Firekeepers or Hollywood Casino. Known as “Grammy” to her grandchildren, great grandsons and so many others, Geri enjoyed hanging out with the ladies, which meant, having “Mother Time” with her daughters, granddaughters, and best friends, but her true joy in life was spending time with her four great grandsons: DeShaun, Justice, Carl and Anthony.\n\nGeraldine Braden, age 75, of Petersburg passed away at her home on Thursday; December 1, 2022. Her passing was preceded by her parents: U.G. and Grace Langford; a sister: Sylvia Glandon; and brother: Clifford Turner.\n\nTo cherish Geraldine’s memory, she leaves her loving husband of fifty-nine years: Carl Braden of Petersburg, Michigan; two daughters: Lisa (John) Jacobson of Petersburg and Carla (Mike) Dunn of Dundee; three grandchildren: Amanda Pena of Petersburg, Kyle Dunn of Dundee, and April (Ryan) Walsh of Temperance; four great grandsons: DeShaun Martin, Justice Chase, and Carl and Anthony Walsh.\n\nPrivate family services are planned for a later date. Geraldine’s care has been entrusted to Merkle Funeral Service, Dundee; 297 Tecumseh Street Dundee, Michigan 48131 (734) 529-3156. Cremation will take place through the on-site crematory, Covenant Cremation of Erie, Michigan.\n\nOnline guests may leave words of inspiration and comfort or share a photo by visiting www.merklefs.com."
