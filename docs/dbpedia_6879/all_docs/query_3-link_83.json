        "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. — More than a century ago under its famed first editor Henry Watterson, The Courier Journal routinely published vile racial slurs such as \"darky,\" \"Sambo\" and \"n-----\" to refer to African Americans — reflecting Watterson’s ugly belief in white superiority.\n\nA generation later, under the ownership of the powerful Bingham family, The Courier Journal and its sister paper, the Louisville Times, became staunch advocates for civil rights and busing to integrate public schools.\n\nEven so, members of the Bingham family now say The Courier Journal proceeded too cautiously under their family's leadership in pushing for equality.\n\n\"Our constant refrain was 'go slow,' 'don’t ask for too much at once,' 'don’t you see we’re trying to help you?' and more of the like,\" Emily Bingham and Eleanor Bingham Miller wrote in a recent statement endorsed by Sallie Bingham.\n\nMore: Family that owned The Courier Journal apologizes for going 'slow' on racial justice\n\nFounded three years after the end of the Civil War in a former slave state that chose not to secede, The Courier Journal has a legacy on race that is equally complicated.\n\nDuring its 153 years, The Courier Journal endorsed the rights of Black citizens but failed in its earlier decades to treat them as equal to white people — both through its news coverage and its employment practices.\n\nIn recent years, under Gannett, the chain that acquired The Courier Journal in 1986, the newspaper named its first Black executive editor in 1997 and its second in February. And while the size of its staff shrank, its percentage of Black staffers has nearly doubled.\n\nAs the death of Breonna Taylor at the hands of police forced Louisville into a reckoning on racial justice, The Courier Journal decided to confront its past — just as it has sought to hold police, the school system and the city accountable for their treatment of African Americans.\n\nThe Courier Journal reviewed more than 100 stories and editorials and interviewed historians and civil rights advocates and protest leaders. It found the newspaper had a mixed record on race that depended largely on the era under review.\n\nHistorians, including Tracy K’Meyer, a history professor at the University of Louisville, said The Courier Journal can justifiably be proud of portions of its history.\n\n\"The general impression that the CJ was ‘liberal’ and ‘forward thinking’ on civil rights is correct,” she said.\n\nFrom cautious support to full-throated endorsement\n\nThe newspaper was among the few in the South to welcome Brown vs. Board of Education, the U.S. Supreme Court's 1954 decision renouncing the doctrine of separate but equal.\n\nIt went on to support the Civil Rights Act of 1963, the Voting Rights Act of 1964 and anti-discriminatory housing legislation at the local, state and federal levels.\n\nMost famously it embraced busing for school desegregation in the 1970s, even as thousands of readers canceled their subscriptions and the newspaper came under attack.\n\nBut Tracy K’Meyer, a history professor at the University of Louisville, and others note in the 1940s and 1950s, The Courier Journal only promoted \"gradual reform in removing formal legal barriers” to equality.\n\nK’Meyer said when the city finally integrated parks and downtown stores and restaurants, The Courier Journal praised city leaders rather than Black demonstrators who forced those changes.\n\nUniversity of Kentucky Professor George Wright, author of \"A History of Blacks in Kentucky: In Pursuit of Equality, 1890-1980,\" said the Binghams were not like the \"Negrophobes\" and \"virulent racists\" at other Southern newspapers.\n\nBut he said the plaudits they won in liberal circles were for merely following the law — for supporting \"modest steps in desegregation.\"\n\nAnd The Courier Journal under the Binghams committed serious missteps.\n\nEditors insisted on calling Muhammad Ali by his given name, Cassius Clay, for six years after he adopted his Muslim name in 1964.\n\nAnd perhaps most egregiously, in 1954, they turned on one of the Bingham’s own employees, Carl Braden, a copy editor for The Louisville Times, when he and his wife, Anne, were charged with sedition after a home they bought for a Black veteran in a white neighborhood was dynamited.\n\nCarl Braden was fired and never reinstated despite his conviction being overturned after he served eight months of a 15-year sentence, said Catherine Fosl, author of “Subversive Southerner: Anne Braden and the Struggle for Racial Justice in the Cold War South.”\n\nIn its editorial on the Bradens, The Courier Journal at the time blamed the couple — not the white mob that burned a cross and bombed the new home of Andrew Wade, a Black man.\n\n\"Whatever may have been the motives of the Bradens, we believe they gave poor service to idealism in forcing an issue of race relations in this artificial and contrived way,\" The Courier Journal editorial said.\n\n‘We are sorry’: Bingham family apologizes\n\nRobert F. Bingham's purchase of The Courier Journal in 1918 ushered in the newspaper's more progressive approach to racial equality — but one still imbued by Southern attitudes.\n\nHis son, Barry Bingham, followed by his grandson, Barry Jr., earned a reputation for pushing for Black rights, but at a pace their surviving family members regret wasn't more aggressive.\n\n\"The Courier-Journal advocated progress for Black people but only at the pace its owners and editors considered manageable and appropriate,\" historian Emily Bingham, one of Barry Bingham Jr.’s daughters, and Eleanor Bingham Miller, one of his sisters, said in a statement.\n\nBingham and her aunt said they know The Courier Journal and its sister paper the Times published strong anti-racist editorials. And they said they are proud of Barry Sr.’s work to bring reforms to the South and Barry Jr. for recruiting Black reporters and editors, though not until the 1970s.\n\nHowever, they said: \"We deeply regret the damage done by the daily newspaper monopoly our family owned and controlled. We take responsibility for our harmful actions as individuals and for the actions taken by these companies. We are sorry and we offer our apology with our whole hearts.\"\n\nIn an email, author Sallie Bingham, Bingham Jr.’s other sister, said she agreed:\n\n\"The history of covering issues of race, for The Courier Journal as well as for many other newspapers, was deeply affected by the personal prejudices of its owners.\"\n\n‘Southern newspaper in a segregated city’\n\nStill, said civil rights historian David Garrow, winner of the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for his biography, \"Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,\" it is important to recognize the \"huge difference\" between most Southern papers and more liberal ones such as The Courier Journal and the Atlanta Constitution, which at least tried to avoid \"trafficking in hate.\"\n\nIn contrast, Lexington's Herald Leader conceded in 2004 it had virtually ignored civil rights protests in Lexington under orders from top executives as part of a conscious strategy to play down the movements in hopes they would wither away.\n\n'Marse Henry' and vile stereotypes\n\nUnder \"Marse Henry\" Watterson, who was editor from 1868 to 1918, The Courier Journal opposed lynching and the Ku Klux Klan and called for modernizing the South.\n\nBut while the former Confederate soldier and editor initially supported giving former slaves the right to vote, he later concluded Black suffrage was a failure.\n\n\"Where there is one Negro fit for citizenship, there are myriad of Negroes wholly unfit,\" he said in a speech in 1903 that captured national attention.\n\nThe Courier Journal was formed in 1868 through the merger of the Morning Courier and the Louisville Journal.\n\nThe Journal had been edited by the notorious George Prentice, who baited Black people and immigrants, brewing hysteria against Catholics that resulted in at least 22 killed in the Bloody Monday riots of 1855.\n\nThe Journal celebrated the Confederacy and routinely ran ads to buy and sell slaves, including one saying, \"We wish to purchase 18 or 20 Negro boys, from 9 to 12 years of age, for which the highest price in cash will be given.\"\n\nPrentice died two years after The Courier was founded. Watterson, as editor of the new Courier Journal, campaigned for education for Black people, although of the vocational variety and separate from white people.\n\nHe also championed giving Black residents the right to testify against white people, which was prohibited. But he opposed their service as jurors, lawyers or judges.\n\nHistorians say he supported limited rights for Black people only to curtail federal interference in Kentucky and maintain the superior status of whites.\n\nJames Klotter, Kentucky’s state historian and professor emeritus at Georgetown College, told The Courier Journal for a history of the newspaper in 2018 that Watterson was clearly a racist.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court in 1908 upheld Kentucky’s infamous Day Law, which kept Black and white students from being taught in the same school or college, Watterson celebrated.\n\n\"Southerners, after many years of practical experience and observation, have found the separation of the races works the better results in the long run,\" he wrote, adding that “leaders of thought in the Negro race have reached the same conclusion.”\n\n‘Southerness on his sleeve’: Robert Bingham\n\nUnder its new owner and second editor, Robert Worth Bingham, who ran the paper until his death in 1937, The Courier Journal adopted a more enlightened view on race, scholars say.\n\nHe met with Black people and served as chairman of the Louisville chapter of the Urban League, founded a few years earlier to bring economic and social justice to Black citizens.\n\nHe banned the use of the N-word in news accounts, though they still appeared in letters to the editor and features. He published letters, including from Black readers, denouncing racist language in the paper.\n\nAnd when the Ku Klux Klan burned a cross a half block from the mayor’s house, he condemned the group as \"un-American and unpatriotic.\"\n\nBut his paper continued to run \"Hambone,” an insulting caricature of a bulging-eyed African African. And he editorialized against a bill making lynching a federal crime, saying it would infringe on states' rights.\n\n“He wore his Southernness on his sleeve,” said his biographer, William Ellis, author of “Robert Worth Bingham and the Southern Mystique.”\n\nAccording to the Ellis book, in the mid-1930s, when Bingham was serving as U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom and an Englishwoman asked him when Southerners would stop \"your hideous, horrible lynching of Negroes,\" an angry Bingham replied they would \"probably stop when Negroes stopped raping white women and girls.\"\n\n‘All in good time’: Barry Bingham Sr.\n\nWith Bingham's death, his son, Barry Sr., swiftly made changes.\n\nThe Courier Journal in 1940 editorialized in favor of the federal anti-lynching law Judge Robert Bingham had opposed.\n\nDuring the '40s, the editorial pages supported the admission of Black teacher Lyman T. Johnson to the graduate school at the University of Kentucky; applauded the Supreme Court for striking down restrictive covenants, which had been used to keep white people from selling real estate to Black people; and denounced the “embarrassing paradox” of racial segregation within the armed forces.\n\nWith his wife, Mary, Bingham Sr. personally worked to persuade white store and restaurant owners to integrate.\n\nBut to Mary, who ran the editorial pages while her husband served in the Navy during World War II, civil rights was not the most pressing issue for liberals, Marie Brenner wrote in “House of Dreams: The Bingham Family of Louisville.”\n\nMary wrote to Barry Sr. that she had gone on the board of the Urban League, for example, \"simply because it is so hard to turn away\" Blacks, for whom she used a racial epithet, when they \"ask for your support on things like this.\"\n\nThe family was called out for its hypocrisy in a 1948 letter to the editor that said, “You pretend a deep interest in schooling and otherwise mixing Negroes and whites” but don’t have a single \"Negro on your editorial staff\" or \"give part of your society columns to Negro functions.\"\n\nStill, during the 1950s, the editorial pages applauded the University of Louisville for enrolling Black students. They condemned the Jefferson Country Medical Society for refusing to admit Black doctors, which kept them from practicing in most local hospitals.\n\nAnd within days of the unanimous vote in Brown vs. Board of Education, The Courier Journal began crusading for peaceful enforcement of the decision — in sharp contrast with other Southern newspapers.\n\n\"The Binghams had the best intentions,” Brenner writes. \"Their liberalism was safe, respectable. Conventional. But for Louisville during the McCarthy years with its segregated schools, hospitals that would not admit Negroes, department stores that would not let Negroes try on clothes or use the bathroom, even their tepid liberalism was extreme.\"\n\nCourier Journal endorses ‘orderly integration’\n\nAt the dawn of the 1960s, the newspaper continued to urge patience as young Black people marched in the streets to demand integration of downtown stores and restaurants.\n\n\"The Negroes made it clear that they will not be put off indefinitely,” The Courier journal editorialized in 1961. \"At the same time, it must have been obvious to them that they will not accomplish their objectives by demonstrations alone. In negotiations lies our best hope for averting recriminations and bitterness that this community can ill-afford.\"\n\nBy 1963, however, the editorial board had had enough.\n\n\"The timetables of a few years ago are obsolete,\" The Courier Journal editorialized. \"The federal government has an obligation to act.\"\n\nThree years later, The Courier Journal pushed the Kentucky General Assembly to pass the first state civil rights act south of the Mason-Dixon line, barring discrimination in employment and public accommodations based on race.\n\nThe Courier Journal and the Times integrated their engagement and wedding photos in 1963 and the same year hired their first Black journalist as a summer intern at the Times: Charlayne Hunter-Gault, who had broken the color barrier at the University of Georgia and later worked at The New York Times, PBS, NPR and CNN.\n\nThe Courier Journal hired its first Black reporter, James Alsbrook, in 1965, its first Black news artist, Merv Aubespin, in 1967, and its first Black editorial writer, W. Curtis Riddle, in 1972, making him the first African American whose name appeared on its masthead.\n\nSome Black employees, such as former columnist Betty Winston Baye, said the newspaper sometimes failed to support African American journalists and disproportionately assigned them to work nights and weekends.\n\nStill, modern-day civil rights leaders praised the coverage in The Courier Journal.\n\nThe president of Louisville’s NAACP chapter, Raoul Cunningham, said when he was a teenager The Courier Journal covered civil rights marches and sit-ins fairly.\n\nFormer chapter president Aubrey Williams said the paper through the years has done “an admirable job of addressing the issues that are important to the Black community.”\n\nDewey Clayton, a U of L political science professor, said since he moved to Louisville in 1994, The Courier Journal has done a \"very good job\" of covering issues of equality and economic opportunity and police use of force, particularly in the past couple of years.\n\nAnd Hannah Drake, an activist and poet, said she thinks The Courier Journal's current coverage of Black people is \"fine.\"\n\nDiversity grows under Gannett\n\nDiversity accelerated under Gannett, which purchased The Courier Journal in 1986.\n\nIt hired The Courier Journal its first Black executive editor, Bennie Ivory, in 1997 and its second, Mary Irby-Jones, in February.\n\nAlthough its news staff was trimmed dramatically, its percentage of Black staffers has nearly doubled from 10% in 1993 to about 16% today. Nine of its 55 news employees are Black.\n\nThe newsroom editorially has continued to support a progressive agenda.\n\nIn a 2003 column, for example, it defended affirmative action, saying “strength will come by embracing diversity, not by running away from it.”\n\nIn 2016, in a front-page editorial, it apologized for waiting so long to call Muhammad Ali by the name he called himself.\n\nIn 2019, after The Courier showed police were disproportionately stopping and searching Black motorists — and had degraded and humiliated a gainfully employed teenager — the department reformed its practices.\n\nThe county attorney also stopped prosecuting people for possession of small amounts of marijuana after The Courier reported Black residents were nearly six times more likely to be cited for it than white people.\n\nLast year, The Courier Journal published an eight-part series on systemic racism in Louisville. And in conjunction with that series, in another front-page editorial The Courier Journal said: “It is time for us to stare deeply into the mirror and acknowledge the truth: Systemic racism has repressed Louisville's Black residents — and for far too long.”\n\nIrby-Jones, who most recently ran Gannett's The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, Mississippi, said she plans to form a citizen advisory board for The Courier Journal to \"make sure our newsroom reflects the community and is out in the community.\""
