        "text": "About The Documentary\n\nWhat is required to bring about a change in society? An idea whose time has come? Skilled and charismatic leaders to articulate goals and plan strategies? Both of those are necessary, but they are not sufficient. True change happens when “ordinary” people, acting on the courage of their convictions, put the idea to work in their own lives. Through individual acts of bravery, a great movement can be born.\n\nAbout the Project\n\nIn the 1950s and ’60s, Kentucky and the rest of the nation were swept by such a movement, as African Americans—joined by sympathetic others—organized to demand legal and social equality. In Living the Story: The Civil Rights Movement in Kentucky, individual Kentuckians tell their own stories of what they saw, heard, experienced, and did then. Some were leaders and organizers, but others were simply people who wanted to enroll in a different school, move to a new neighborhood, or shop at a downtown department store. In the segregated society of the time, such seemingly mundane acts could require great courage. By finding that courage, and by standing firm for what they knew to be right, these ordinary people accomplished extraordinary things.\n\nThe Kentucky Oral History Commission, a division of the Kentucky Historical Society, started the Civil Rights Movement in Kentucky Oral History Project in 1998 to capture stories from the civil rights era. Dr. Betsy Brinson, project director for the commission, and Dr. Tracy K’Meyer of the University of Louisville have conducted and taped interviews with more than 175 participants in the movement. For the accompanying television program, producer/director Arthur Rouse and colleagues asked 15 of them to tell their stories on videotape. Our biographies section above has brief background information on these individuals, plus several other historical figures discussed in the documentary.\n\nLiving the Story is not a comprehensive or definitive history of the civil rights era in Kentucky. Its purposes are to give contemporary audiences a sense of what it was like to be part of the civil rights movement, to encourage further exploration of the subject, and to inspire young people by illustrating the role people their age played in the movement. For more about the aims and the lessons of the documentary, read on for perspectives from some of its creators.\n\n↑ Top\n\nExecutive Producer Betsy Brinson\n\nKentucky Oral History Commission\n\nproject director; video executive producer\n\nFor executive producer Dr. Betsy Brinson, the documentary Living the Story: The Civil Rights Movement in Kentucky is just one part of an ambitious undertaking: collecting and preserving the stories of Kentuckians who were part of the state’s civil rights history.\n\nFor nearly four years, she and others involved in the project have traveled the state collecting the 175 interviews that were used in the documentary and that will be preserved by the Kentucky Historical Society for future generations.\n\n“There is very little written documentation of the civil rights movement in Kentucky,” says Brinson. “It was really important to collect the stories of the people who were part of it. Once they’re gone, the opportunity is lost.”\n\nA native of North Carolina, Brinson moved to Kentucky at an opportune time, she says. In 1998, the Oral History Commission initiated the Civil Rights Movement in Kentucky Oral History Project. She is the project’s director.\n\nBrinson has her own experiences with the civil rights movement in North Carolina, and she is a historian of social movements. But as the project progressed, she was surprised to see her own stereotypes of Kentucky shattered. “I didn’t know Kentucky,” she says. “I was surprised at the violence that went on here.\n\n“Kentucky’s part in the civil rights movement is interesting because it’s a border state,” she continues. “Though voting was not an issue, it was a true segregated society in terms of schools, jobs, public accommodations, etc.”\n\nFinding people to tell their stories was done mostly by word-of-mouth, says Brinson. “People I had not expected to be willing to work with me thought it was important that these stories be told.”\n\nOf the 175 people interviewed, 15 are included in the documentary. “The vivid recollections of the men and women presented in the program clearly illustrate the depth of commitment of Kentuckians to social justice here and in the nation,” Brinson says.\n\n—Marianne Mosley\n\n↑ Top\n\nProducer/Director Arthur Rouse\n\nVideo Editing Services\n\nvideo producer/director\n\nProducer/director Arthur Rouse and the staff of his company, Video Editing Services in Lexington, faced some intimidating challenges while producing a documentary on the civil rights movement in Kentucky.\n\nThe first task was obvious. The stories had to be visual. It was, after all, a television documentary. So Rouse and his staff would have to track down archival film, video, and photographs and find people to interview about the struggle for civil rights for African Americans in Kentucky.\n\n“We spent quite a bit of time looking for primary source materials,” says Rouse. The Courier-Journal and University of Louisville opened their archives, and Rouse’s team worked with every archivist and museum in Kentucky.\n\nThey also used national resources, obtaining artifacts from the Library of Congress, NBC, and ABC. As a matter of fact, Rouse says their request prompted ABC to dig deep into un-catalogued archives, where the researchers found all kinds of footage of the civil rights movement that they’d forgotten they had.\n\nRouse also dug—figuratively—into the attics and garages of those who were prominent in the civil rights movement in Kentucky to find the visual evidence to illustrate their stories.\n\n“You have to ask people several times if they’ve saved anything,” says Rouse. “People always say they don’t have anything, but then the fourth or fifth time you ask them, they’ll say something about an old film in a box somewhere that nobody cares about. They don’t realize that what they have is a treasure.”\n\nThe Kentucky Oral History Commission, the Kentucky Historical Society, and the Advisory Board of the Kentucky Civil Rights Project were crucial players—consulting on the content and accuracy of the documentary, providing archival photographs and film, and knowing the people who had a story to tell and who could tell a story.\n\nBut there was another challenge: The documentary would have to engage the general KET viewing audience and appeal to high school students.\n\n“We wanted to make this interesting for younger folks who may not typically watch documentaries,” says Rouse. “We knew that kids are visually and aurally engaged and would lose interest in a string of talking heads.”\n\nTo find out how to appeal to young people, Rouse held two focus groups. Teenagers were asked what they already knew about the civil rights movement in Kentucky and what they wanted to know, what they like to watch and what turns them off, and what they think about using television in the classroom.\n\nRouse said the two groups were unanimous on one particular issue: They didn’t want a historian telling them what happened. They wanted to see people tell their own stories, then make up their own minds about what happened.\n\n“These kids are very savvy,” says Rouse. “They know when they’re being manipulated by sound bites and images, and they don’t like it.”\n\nRouse proposed a thematic approach to the documentary treatment—focusing on young people who took courageous stands and risked their lives for civil rights. “I wanted it to be historically correct and useful to teachers,” he explains. “I didn’t want it to be a chronological, linear account of what happened.”\n\nThroughout the documentary, Rouse used old photographs to underscore the theme of courageous young people.\n\n“In the opening slate for each segment, you see a portion of the interview, accompanied by a photograph of the person at the time of the movement, when they were young.” says Rouse. “Teenagers see other teenagers doing really courageous things.”\n\nRouse also used a map of Kentucky to show where various incidents took place to further emphasize the history of the movement in the Commonwealth.\n\n“Meeting all the challenges while producing the documentary, from the archival process to the art design, green screen technology and original music, was invigorating for all of us,” Rouse says. “But the result made it worthwhile. Kentuckians now have a portrait of an important chapter in Kentucky and U.S. history, and we’ve preserved on tape the living histories of the civil rights movement in Kentucky.”\n\n—Marianne Mosley\n\n↑ Top\n\nCo-Producer/Director Joan Brannon\n\nJoan Brannon, the co-producer/director of Living the Story: The Civil Rights Movement in Kentucky, describes the story of the movement in Kentucky as “elusive.” Though aware that some of the people she knew had been powerful forces in the fight for civil rights, she didn’t know their individual stories. “There’s a rich history in Kentucky that hasn’t been revealed,” says Brannon. “My interest in the project was to be part of that.”\n\nMost of the documentary’s visual images are of events that happened in Kentucky. Many photographs—of segregated schoolhouses, a lynching, a Klan rally—have never been so widely seen. “I’m a Kentuckian,” she explains, “yet while I was growing up, I didn’t see a reflection of myself in media.”\n\nBut most of the story is told not by images, but by those who lived it. Relying on the movement’s participants to tell their stories was one of the suggestions made by a focus group of 11th-grade students, one of the documentary’s important target audiences. “Very early on we talked to teens about what appeals to them [and] what turns them off,” says Brannon. “I wanted to make an honest effort to make something that they could embrace.”\n\nThe students who participated in the focus group didn’t know much about the civil rights movement, according to Brannon, though they felt inundated with images of Martin Luther King Jr. “They didn’t want to hear any more about the ‘dream’ speech. They wanted to know what happened in Kentucky.”\n\nOne very important insight the students gave the filmmakers was “to let the people talk.” Instead of relying mostly on images and narration to tell the story, Brannon says they let people who were part of the movement have the time to sit and talk.\n\nInterviews with history’s eyewitnesses resulted in hours of personal stories that had to be winnowed down for the hour-long documentary. “We originally tried to keep the interviews to one hour, but they were so riveting,” Brannon says. Interviews averaged about two hours each, and many lasted longer, she says.\n\nBeing true to the stories of the people who have done this amazing work was an important personal challenge, says Brannon. The resulting documentary is a project she is proud to be part of.\n\n“The documentary is very powerful, but because of the length and format, we were only able to touch on the subject,” she says. “I hope that it makes people really want to talk to someone who lives down the street or who goes to their church who really was a hero.”\n\n—Marianne Mosley\n\n↑ Top\n\nTips for Conducting an Oral History\n\nThe mission of the Kentucky Oral History Commission is to preserve the rich histories of Kentucky citizens from all walks of life. These projects explore and describe local individuals and their communities and provide students and researchers the rare opportunity to become involved with their subject matter in an interactive process of learning.\n\nTips for conducting an oral history as well as an interview release form are available from the Kentucky Oral History Commission.\n\nTips for Successful Interviewing\n\nFirst, recruit appropriate people to talk to. Choose people based on their experiences and knowledge of the subject matter. For the civil rights movement, choose people who are over age 50—preferably 60 to 70 years old or older. Select people who like to talk; quiet people are generally harder to interview.\n\nOnce you have agreed on a time for the interview, find a quiet place to conduct it. Turn off radios and televisions, and close the door if appropriate.\n\nBefore you begin, make sure your recording equipment is working properly. Use of an external microphone is recommended. If you use a tape recorder, try to use cassette tapes that allow 30 minutes of recording on each side. Longer tapes break more easily and do not preserve well.\n\nAs the conversation proceeds, keep these tips in mind:\n\nBe respectful.\n\nListen carefully, and do not interrupt. Take notes to help you keep track of follow-up questions. Do not share stories about yourself or your reactions to the subject’s stories until after the formal interview is over.\n\nNod your head and use eye contact as much as possible to show you are paying attention. (This may be harder to do if you are taking notes.)\n\nWhen you are finished with the interview, have the individual sign a consent form agreeing to the interview. A sample consent form is available from the Kentucky Oral History Commission; call (502) 564-1792.\n\nSelect an archive and donate the finished interview. Not only will tapes last longer if placed in an archive, but they also will be available to future researchers. Consider university archives in your area first. The Kentucky Oral History Commission, 100 West Broadway, Frankfort, KY 40601, also accepts taped interviews for the archives.\n\nIf possible, make a duplicate of the interview tape and give it to the interviewee. Such a gift will be greatly appreciated by both the interview subject and his or her family.\n\n↑ Top\n\nSample Oral History Interview Questions\n\nThe following questions will serve as a starting point if you are planning to interview someone about the civil rights era in Kentucky. (See our tips for successful interviewing for advice on preparing for and conducting the interview itself.)\n\nOf course, every oral history interview should be tailored to the individual being interviewed. Before the interview, ask your subject for a biographical vita, an article, or some other descriptive information. Explain that having this information in advance will help you frame your questions. Then modify and add to the following generic suggested questions as needed.\n\nCould you please give me some basic background information about yourself—your full name, date and place of birth, parents and siblings, ancestors, spouse and children, education, religion, community involvement, professions, political party, etc.?\n\nGrowing up during segregation, can you recall an early incident when you recognized a difference of treatment on account of color?\n\nHave you traveled outside Kentucky?
