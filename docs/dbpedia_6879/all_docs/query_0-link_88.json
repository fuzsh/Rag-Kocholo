Yes, it is the job of media outlets like us to inform people about the mayhem.\n\nYet, it's also important to shine a light on the good things happening in the communities on both sides of the Ohio River in Kentuckiana.\n\nThis weekly column will highlight some of those people and their accomplishments.

Crit Luallen spoke about the women's suffrage movement.\n\nMore than 100 people gathered to celebrate Delahanty, who has a long list of accomplishments. She served on the Kentucky Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights. In a 1978 report, the committee presented evidence showing that neither race nor gender were properly represented within the Kentucky Police Force. She led a challenge to the credentials of the Kentucky democratic delegation to the 1972 national convention in Miami. After that challenge, all delegations to the Democratic National Conventions were to be 50% female.\n\nFrom 1973 to 1976, Delahanty was the secretary of the Kentucky Governor's Commission on Women. Instrumental in the passage of Kentucky's Fair Credit Law, Delahanty was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to study the aid given to women from the Cabinet of Health and Human Services.\n\nDelahanty was inducted into the Kentucky Civil Rights Hall of Fame in 2012, and her portrait hangs in the West Wing of the state Capitol as part of the Kentucky Women Remembered exhibit.\n\nRead this: Marty Pollio touts JCPS' progress, but confronts challenges ahead\n\nAnne Braden commemoration planned\n\nAnne McCarty Braden was a writer, a civil rights activist and a warrior in the battle to end state-sponsored segregation. An event to celebrate her life and work is set for noon Saturday, March 7, at St. George’s Episcopal Church, where Braden was a member.\n\nBraden spent much of her life fighting for racial equity and civil rights. People who worked and worshiped alongside her will speak at the commemoration, and numerous exhibits will focus on her time at St. George’s.\n\nBraden and her husband, Carl Braden, gained national attention in 1954 when they bought a house for an African American couple in an all-white neighborhood near Shively. The house was bombed in response, but no one was hurt. The couple were charged with sedition and accused of planning the explosion to stir up trouble and promote communism. The Bradens denied the charges.\n\nCarl's eventual conviction was later overturned, and he was released from jail.\n\nAfter Carl died in 1975, Anne went on to support many causes, including busing to desegregate Jefferson County's public schools. She also spoke out on issues such as gay rights, Rubbertown pollution and police shootings of black residents. She was arrested numerous times.\n\nAfter turning 80, Braden continued to organize protests and show up at local government meetings. She died in 2006 at age 81.\n\nHer work for social and economic justice was recognized by The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in his famous 1963 \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail.\" He expressed his gratitude to a group of white Southerners, including Braden, who “have written about our struggle in eloquent and prophetic terms... and committed themselves to it.”\n\nPeople attending the commemoration at St. George's Church, 1201 S. 26th St., are asked to bring a non-perishable food item for the church’s Dare to Care food distribution site.\n\nNews: Rep.
