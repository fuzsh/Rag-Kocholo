        "text": "Andrew Wade was born on Feb 12, 1922 in Nashville, TN. Charlotte Ann Wade (Williams) was born on November 22, 1928 in Louisville, KY. They were married in 1950 [source: Ancestry.com].\n\nAndrew Wade and his family were at the center of the infamous Wade home bombing in Louisville. Wade was a World War II veteran and an electrician who owned Wade & Son Electrical Contractors [source: \"Andrew E. Wade IV Obituary\", Courier Journal, 9/28/2005]. He sought to move his family to Shively, a segregated, whites-only suburb of Louisville, after being dissatisfied by the houses for sale in blacks-only neighborhoods because they lacked space for his children to play [source: \"The Wade-Braden Affair,\" in The Encyclopedia of Louisville, edited by J. Kebler].\n\nAlthough Louisville was in the process of desegregating their public areas like golf courses and parks, private housing very much still followed the color line [source: Civil Rights in the Gateway to the South: Louisville, Kentucky, 1945-1980, by T. E. K'Meyer]. Wade continually encountered realtors unwilling to show him houses in whites-only neighborhoods [source: Freedom on the Border: An Oral History of the Civil Rights Movement in Kentucky, by C. Fosl]. Before buying the home on Rone Court (now called Clyde Drive), the Wades attempted to purchase a different home in the neighborhood. However, when the owners realized that Andrew was African American, they asked the realtor to return Andrew’s money. Rather than fight the case, Andrew accepted the return [source: C. Fosl, \"Interview with Andrew Wade\", 11/8/1989. University of Kentucky, Special Collections Research Center, Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History].\n\nA real estate agent suggested that the only viable workaround would be to get a white person to buy the home and then transfer the deed to him [source: Subversive Southerner: Anne Braden and the Struggle for Racial Justice in the Cold War South by C. Fosl]. Andrew approached the Bradens after several other of his white acquaintances expressed fear at facilitating the sale. The Wades and Bradens knew each other casually at the time that Andrew approached them as both couples were members of the Progressive Party (PP) in Louisville [source: Devinatz, V., \"We Had a Utopia in the Union\": James Wright, the Farm Equipment Workers Union, and the Struggle for Civil Rights Unionism in Postwar Louisville, 1946-1952,\" Nature, Society, and Thought, vol. 20, nos. 3-4, pp. 261-278].\n\nOn May 10th of 1954, the Wades moved into their new home on Rone Court. Just two days later, the neighbors burned a cross on the front lawn next door, threw rocks through the windows and shot at the house in attempts to intimidate the Wades into leaving [source: \"Wade-Braden Affair,\" in The Encyclopedia of Louisiville, edited by J. Kebler]."
