        "text": "Free and easy!\n\nReading and discussing good books brings members of a community together. Kentucky Humanities makes it easy for libraries (and other nonprofit groups) to offer their communities book-discussion programs on Kentucky history and literature.\n\nYou arrange the program, then we provide a grant of up to $1,000 that covers book purchases, publicity, and honoraria for discussion leaders. Here's how simple it is:\n\nCHOOSE four books from the lists below that will attract a group of people (preferably at least 10) who'll read the books and meet at regular intervals to discuss them.\n\nFIND college teachers or other scholars familiar with the books to lead the discussion sessions. You can have the same discussion leader for all the books, or up to four different leaders. (However many you want, we'll help you find them.)\n\nFILL OUT and submit an application at least six weeks before your program starts. As long as money is available, properly completed applications are automatically funded. No cash expenditure by the sponsor is required.\n\nPUBLICIZE the program as widely as possible. Be sure to submit your final report when it's over.\n\nFor application forms and more\n\ninformation about\n\nKH book-discussion\n\nprograms, contact\n\nKathleen Pool at\n\n859/257-5932, or\n\n206 East Maxwell,\n\nLexington, KY 40508.\n\nJust the Facts: Kentucky History, Biography, and Autobiography\n\nClear Springs: A Family Story, Bobbie Ann Mason.
