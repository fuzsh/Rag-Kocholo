        "text": "Carolyn Sue Braden (nee Carper), born February 9, 1938, to the late Silas and Ruth Carper, passed away surrounded by loved ones on March 28, 2023. Loving wife of 66 years to the late Carl Braden, cherished mother of Monty (Karen) Braden who proceeded her in death, Mickey (Steve Dempsey) Braden, and Melissa (Greg) Troy, beloved grandmother of Christina, Jesse, Annie, and great-grandmother of Bella and Thomas. Carolyn was a social butterfly and cared for others before herself. She would demonstrate this without even realizing the impact she made on those around her. Quilting and sewing were a gift that Carolyn had, and she carried that talent on throughout her life. She would make quilts, crafts, and for many years made the entire cast’s clothing for the Christmas play at Christ’s Church Mason. Carolyn also spread joy to many as Daisy Bright, the clown. She was a devoted and loving mother, fiercely independent when the time required her to be, and loved to spend time with her grandchildren and family. All Carolyn was to so many, will be greatly missed. The family of Carolyn will be receiving friends and family for a visitation at Shorten and Ryan Funeral Home – 400 Reading Rd., Mason, OH 45040 on Thursday, April 6, 2023, from 10:00 AM – 11:00 AM. A graveside service at Maplewood Cemetery, 200 College Dr., Anderson, IN 46012, will follow the visitation where the family will receive friends at 3:00 PM. Donations may be made in honor and memory of Carolyn to The Alzheimer’s Association."
