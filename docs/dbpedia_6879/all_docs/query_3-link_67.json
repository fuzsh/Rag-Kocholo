        "text": "If positive thinking counts for anything, the people in charge of Rifle’s newest downtown bar are sure to see success.\n\nCarl Braden is the owner of Big Kids Corner Bar, a sports bar that plans to open New Year’s Eve in the same space occupied by the Sports Corner bar for 28 years, the corner of Third Street and Railroad Avenue.\n\nManager Dawn Parks and head bartender Jordan Shaw are just as gung-ho they can help make Big Kids a popular hang out and socializing hot spot.\n\nBraden, a Parachute resident who was previously a bouncer for the Sports Corner and Cheermeister’s, bought the business for an undisclosed amount and said the name stems from his personality.\n\n“I usually don’t act my age all the time,” Braden said during a Friday, Dec. 20 interview in the bar’s downstairs office. “And it just seemed like the right time to open a bar.”\n\nBraden also operates Big Kid Trucking and said he was looking to diversify his income.\n\n“The location is great and I knew people had been coming here for years,” Braden added.\n\nThe previous owner had not maintained the Sports Corner as an attractive bar, Braden said, “So we decided we would just kill the Sports Corner and go for a complete remodel.”\n\n“We’re cleaning it up, we hired people who had never worked here before and just want to have a new hot spot for Rifle,” Braden said.\n\nBig Kids will employ seven people and offer live music by local bands, ladies’ nights wine tasting and lingerie shows, along with food catered by local restaurants, he said.\n\n“I’m a big believer in local business, so we want to work with anyone who wants to work with us,” Braden said.\n\nParks noted the remodeling work that began in October, and was to likely continue until close to New Year’s Eve, was done by local contractors.\n\nThe building itself is around 100 years old, Parks noted, and includes a bank vault from one of its previous uses, along with the bank tellers counter.\n\n“Most of the wood is the original wood, we just refinished and restained it,” Parks said. “We want the building ambiance to continue, but we’ll be cleaner and more functional.”\n\nPulling down the papers\n\nOn New Year’s Eve day, the bar plans to open at 2 p.m. with prizes and games, the Missing Links band will also perform and from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m., food will be provided by Shooter’s Grill. A photo booth will also be available for New Year’s revelers to visually record their fun times.\n\n“We know the entire valley is very excited to see what we’ve done,” Shaw said. “We can’t wait to pull down the newspapers [that have covered the windows fronting Railroad Avenue while work took place inside]. It’s going to be a fun roller coaster.”\n\nFive percent of all proceeds from New Year’s Eve will be donated to the Wounded Warrior Project that helps U.S. military veterans returning from war, said Shaw.\n\n“We really think that anyone in the entire valley who comes here will just drop their jaw when they see what we’ve done,” Parks said.\n\nSocial media will be used to promote the bar and special attractions, Braden added.\n\nDesignated drivers will be available at special events and on holidays to help those who imbibe a bit too much get home safely.\n\n“As far as bars go, this will be something Rifle’s never seen,” added Shaw. “We’re going to have pinball, a hunting game, but it won’t be all about drinking. It will be a place everyone can have a little fun.”\n\nBig Kids will feature seven TVs to show nearly any sports event available, said Braden.\n\n“If you want to watch NASCAR or pro bowling, we’ll find a TV to show it on,” he stated.\n\nAn economic ‘jump start’\n\nBraden said he’s confident Big Kids will be a success because he “has a finger on the pulse of what Rifle and the valley wants.”\n\n“Rifle needs a jump start economically, and I just hope a new business on one of the main corners of town can help do that,” Braden added.\n\n“We’re thinking big and we want everyone from all the areas around Rifle to want to come here and have fun,” Shaw said. “All the bartenders have great personalities to help make it fun and Big Kid [Braden] is the main personality.”\n\nBraden said he planned to reinvent the image left behind by the Sports Corner.\n\n“Hunters who always used to come here came to a closed door this year,” he said. “The Shriners always used to stop in after the [Garfield County Fair] parade, but they were met with a closed door. Now they won’t have to go anywhere else.”\n\nBraden said Big Kids will operate as a “classy, clean bar with very good service.”\n\n“We don’t want to get comfortable and think we’ve very got it made,” he added. “We hope we can be a jewel and an anchor point to downtown.”\n\nBraden added he planned to reopen an adjacent pizza parlor on Railroad Avenue, as well as a video arcade for youth by the Rifle skate park, sometime in the next year.\n\nBut Big Kids Corner Bar is the linchpin to his future plans.\n\n“A nice neighborhood bar is something every community needs,” he said. “A place to go to get caught up on the news of the day, to talk politics or sports. I was 16 when we moved here and when I turned 21, a bar was the place my dad took me to celebrate. This is going to be a place like that.”"
