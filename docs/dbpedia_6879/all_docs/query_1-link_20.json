        "text": "Braden Elliott Carl was born February 11, 1995 in Norman, OK to Tony and Candi (Thornton) Carl. He passed away suddenly on October 22, 2018.\n\nBraden attended Madison Elementary and Irving Middle School and graduated from Norman High School in 2013. He had a passion for cars and began a career in automotive parts sales with Big Red Kia and Norman Mitsubishi. At the time of his passing he worked for Canadian Valley Winery as a Sales Representative learning the wine industry. Braden enjoyed soccer, music, and hanging out with his friends.\n\nSurvivors include his parents, Tony and Candi Carl of Moore; one sister, Lauren York and her husband Ethan of Moore; grandparents Bea Woodard and her husband Roy of Norman, Diane Blackburn and her husband Tom of Moore, and Gary Thornton of Oklahoma City; great-grandmother, Jaqualin Thornton of Bremerton, WA; three uncles, Keith Carl and his wife Mary of Roanoke, TX, Stacy Thornton and his wife Staci of Moore, and Brandon Thornton and his wife Denise of Garland, TX; and numerous cousins.\n\nBraden was preceded in death by his grandfather, William Lee Carl; great-grandparents Nana Lou and Harvey Sanders; great-grandparents Russell and Anna Carroll; great-grandparents T.W. and Clara Carl; great-grandfather Donald Thornton; and cousin Alexis Thornton.\n\nAnyone who knew Braden experienced his constant smile and his ability to make everyone feel welcome and comfortable. Braden never met a stranger. His life motto was “23 years of winging it and hoping for the best!” which fit him perfectly.\n\nFuneral services will be held at 2:00pm on Friday, October 26, 2018 in the Bethel Baptist Church at 1717 W Lindsey in Norman, OK with Pastor Bruce Ingram officiating. Braden will be laid to rest at Sunset Memorial Park Cemetery in Norman, OK.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made in expression of sympathy for Braden at www.gofundme.com/braden-carl-memorial-fund."
