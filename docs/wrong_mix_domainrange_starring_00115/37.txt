We love bundling up under a bunch of blankets, with a cup of cocoa in hand, and binging every Christmas movie we can find. Now, we love the classics like It’s a Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street, and Love Actually, but sometimes, we wanna shake things up.

Eventually, we run out of Christmas movies (and sometimes, we just want to try something new, but still in the same vein as the wintertime). We want those wintertime movies, packed with all the fixings of a Christmas film: a lesson about togetherness or being grateful, love, and something to make us cry.

Now, quite a few films have been debated as Christmas films over the years (yes, we’re talking about you, Die Hard). And years after the films have been released, some put these films in their Christmas cycle.

Will you, though?

From action-packed films like The Nice Guys and The Long Kiss Goodnight to romance films placed during winter like Serendipity and Edward Scissorhands, there’s something for everyone.
