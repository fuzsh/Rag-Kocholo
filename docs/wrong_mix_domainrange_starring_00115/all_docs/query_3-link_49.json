        "text": "Adam Driver called out Amazon and Netflix for refusing to meet SAG-AFTRA’s demands Thursday (August 31) during Ferrari’s press conference at the Venice Film Festival. The actor was asked about his appearance to promote the new film while the actors and writers strikes are ongoing. Driver, 39, said, “I’m very proud to be here to be a visual representation of a movie that’s not part of the AMPTP and to promote the SAG leadership directive, which is an effective tactic, which is the interim agreement.”\n\nThe actor pointed out that Ferrari is distributed by smaller distribution companies Neon and STX Entertainment. Driver made it a point to state that these companies are meeting the “dream demands of what SAG is asking for” in the pre-negotiations stage of their “wishlist, but a big company like Netflix and Amazon can’t? And every time people from SAG go and support a movie that has met the terms of the interim agreement, it just makes it more obvious that these people are willing to support the people that they collaborate with, and the others are not.”\n\nThe Interim Agreements\n\nPer Variety, leading up to the festival, SAG-AFTRA agreed to grant interim agreements to certain productions so that they can promote their films. In order to obtain an interim agreement, the film’s producers and distributors have to operate independently from companies belonging to the AMPTP and agree to terms proposed by SAG-AFTRA in its negotiations. That applies to Ferrari and other films premiering in Venice that aren’t produced or distributed by a streaming service.\n\nIn the Michael Mann-directed film, Driver plays Enzo Ferrari following the story of the automotive tycoon’s pivotal year in his life. Ferrari also stars Penélope Cruz, Shailene Woodley, Sarah Gadon, Gabriel Leone, Jack O’Connell and Patrick Dempsey. Mann said of the drama, “Ferrari got made because the people who worked on Ferrari made it by forgoing large sectors of salaries, in the case of Adam and myself. It was not made by a big studio — no big studio wrote us a check. And that’s why we’re here, standing in solidarity.”\n\nWatch the teaser trailer for Ferrari below. The film comes out on December 25.\n\n5 Of The Most Visually Stunning Films\n\nLaila Abuelhawa is the Top 40 and Hip-Hop pop culture writer for Beasley Media Group.
