        "text": "It may be hard to believe, but many of the movie lines that you know and love were not originally in their film scripts.\n\nThese 15 movie lines underwent changes that made a large impact on the final cut of the films.\n\n1. \"You can't handle the truth!\" was not scripted in A Few Good Men; Jack Nicholson altered his line as he played Col. Nathan R. Jessup.\n\n2. Clemenza's \"Leave the gun — take the cannoli\" Godfather line resulted from some spontaneous script additions.\n\n3. The Avengers was going to conclude with Tony Stark waking up and asking, \"What's next?\" but Robert Downey Jr. advocated for a different ending during filming.\n\n4. Crispin Glover cut the lines of his Charlie's Angels character, Thin Man, which added to the creepy nature of the part.\n\n5. Leonardo DiCaprio's iconic \"I'm king of the world!\" moment in Titanic was added to the scene as it was being filmed after other lines didn't make the cut.\n\n6. Johnny Depp rewrote a line in Edward Scissorhands to demonstrate the character's innocence.\n\n7. \"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,\" spoken by Clark Gable as Rhett Butler in Gone With the Wind, was almost a way different line.\n\n8. Bruce Willis changed a curse word in his famous \"Yippee-Ki-Yay\" Die Hard line.\n\n9. The Star Wars \"I love you\"/\"I know\" exchange was scripted as a more serious moment.\n\n10. A change to John Krasinski's emotional last words that he signs as Lee Abbott at the end of A Quiet Place was thought of by costar Millicent Simmonds.\n\n11. Meryl Streep as Miranda Priestly saying, \"Everybody wants to be us,\" in The Devil Wears Prada resulted from a table read adjustment.\n\n12. Whoopi Goldberg's line in Ghost as Oda Mae Brown, \"Molly, you in danger, girl,\" was first scripted as a more traditional statement.\n\n13. Anthony Hopkins added in a hissing sound after delivering a frightening Silence of the Lambs line as Dr. Hannibal Lecter.\n\n14. A line spoken by Tommy Lee Jones as Samuel Gerard during a pivotal moment of The Fugitive was altered from the script and showcased the character's motivation.\n\n15. Humphrey Bogart's “Here's looking at you, kid” Casablanca line was a rewrite and was influenced by a poker experience.\n\nShare This Article"
