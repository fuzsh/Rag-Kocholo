        "text": "This list of movies that started off-screen romances might astound you, simply because it seems like everyone who co-stars in a movie together winds up hooking up. That's not necessarily true, but some of these high profile relationships did indeed begin on film sets. Some of the best actors and actresses of all time have found love at work. In some cases, they went on to star together in these movies with real family members playing fictional families, too.\n\nDo the relationships formed between co-stars off screen last? Sometimes, but not always. Just like any relationship, some will stand the test of time and others will falter. Whenever celebrities are involved, though, the failures are usually filled with high drama. Julia Roberts and Keifer Sutherland met and fell in love on the set of the movie Flatliners, but she later left Sutherland at the altar. Matt Damon and Minnie Driver got together while filming Good Will Hunting, but they didn't last. And yeah, there's that whole Warren Beatty and Madonna Dick Tracy thing â€“ basically a five-minute affair. Beatty, by the way, later met his future wife, Annette Bening, on the set of Bugsy, and they've been together ever since.\n\nNow, success-wise, a lot of movies started off-screen romances that had real staying power. Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor fell in love while filming one of the best epic movies of all time, Cleopatra, and their love spanned decades. The same goes for Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart, who fell for each other on the set of To Have And Have Not (they never married, but they had a decades-long love affair). And yes, who could forget the affair between Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, who got together while filming Woman of the Year in 1941. That relationship lasted for the rest of Tracy's life.\n\nSometimes, movies start off-screen romances that wind up as front page tabloid headlines. No list of famous off-screen hookups would be complete without Mr. and Mrs. Smith, which united powerhouse celebrities Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt (despite the fact that at the time, Pitt was married to Jennifer Aniston). And in 2000, Meg Ryan, star of some of the greatest romantic comedies ever, ignited a firestorm of gossip when she had an affair with Russell Crowe on the set of their movie, Proof of Life. Ryan was married at the time to Dennis Quaid; they later divorced."
