        "text": "our old friend Kevin OâKeeffe and Texas native for a very Texas movie. Debuting in 2011 but arriving in theaters, Richard LinklaterâsÂ BernieÂ accounts a real-life Texan wink wink bachelor Bernie Tiede (played by Jack Black), beloved by the church ladies and local community. However, he is taken in by the town villain Margie (Shirley MacLaine) and ends up convicted for her murder, but not necessarily in the court of public opinion. Though the film was recognized as comedy (especially for Blackâs delicate performance), its awards history was largely left as a footnote to the McConaissance.\n\nThis episode, we talk about the different vibes of Texas cities and the filmâs spectacular ensemble of real-life witnesses. We also talk about Linklaterâs outsider status to the Hollywood establishment, Blackâs preceding failures, and reporter Skip Hollandsworth.\n\nTopics also include âone of them CMT girls,â Linklaterâs upcomingÂ Merrily We Roll Along, and 2012 Best Actor.\n\nFollow Us on Twitter!@Had_Oscar_BuzzJoe: @joereidChris: @chrisvfeil\n\nWeâve hit another year of the podcast, arriving at our milestone 300th episode! No better way to celebrate that by finally revisiting one of the past decades most notorious bombs, 2016âsÂ Collateral Beauty. Starring Will Smith as a grieving father, this all-star cast includes Edward Norton, Michael PeÃ±a, and Kate Winslet as his three friend who devise a plan toâ¦ oust Smith from their advertising firm byâ¦ hiring three struggling actors (Helen Mirren, Keira Knightley, and Jacob Latimore) toâ¦ portray the concepts of Death, Love, and Time that he has been writing letters to, and make him appear mentally unstable. Yeah, this one goes some places!\n\nThis episode, we talk about how the filmâs imbalance with magical realism makes it more deranged. We also talk about Smithâs Oscar-chasing dramatic roles pre-slap, Ann Dowd as a felony committing private investigator, and the previous talent attached to this buzzy but ill-begotten project.\n\nTopics also include Winslet joining our 6 Timers Club,Â Rogue One, and our Best Of ballots for the last year of the show!\n\nFollow Us on Twitter!@Had_Oscar_BuzzJoe: @joereidChris: @chrisvfeil\n\nThis weekâs film has Joe and Chris on opposite sides of a divisive reception. The Matrix not only revolutionized genre filmmaking in 1999, but it resulted in a resounding Oscar success. Reception to its first two sequels in 2003 was decidedly unappreciative, but the franchise has received some critical reassessment in the two decades since. Enter 2021âsÂ The Matrix Resurrections, a COVID-delayed and incredibly meta revisiting of The Wachowskiâs science fiction world, this time with only Lana Wachowski at the helm. The last of Warner Bros.â films to be released simultaneously in theaters and online during the pandemic,Â ResurrectionsÂ nearly cracked craft categories, but its timing proved unfortunate.\n\nThis episode, we talk about Oscars relationship to awarding franchises and overlooking later installments. We also talk about our opposing points of view on the film, how the film incorporates new cast members as stand-ins for the original lineup, and the filmâs bold meta elements.\n\nTopics also include the late 2021 box office, gay villainy, and doomscrolling.\n\nFollow Us on Twitter!@Had_Oscar_BuzzJoe: @joereidChris: @chrisvfeil\n\nEarly in the 1990s, two westerns emerged as Best Picture winners when the genre was first thought dead: Kevin CostnerâsÂ Dances with WolvesÂ and Clint EastwoodâsÂ Unforgiven. In 1993, those heralded actor-directors would unite forÂ A Perfect World, casting Costner as an escaped convict who takes a small boy hostage and teaches him about masculinity, with Eastwood as the lawman in pursuit while also taking the directing reigns. That pedigree missed the Academy on this round, however, as the filmâs downer telling was a poor fit to the holiday season to which it was launched.\n\nThis episode, we talk about the early poor reception for Costnerâs new sagaÂ HorizonÂ and our differing opinions on this filmâs approach to masculinity. We also talk about Eastwoodâs output in the 1990s, Laura Dernâs underserved role as a criminologist, and how the film disappointed for denying audiences an onscreen showdown between its male stars.\n\nTopics also include Schindlerâs List as the 1993 undeniable frontrunner, Costnerâs sex appeal, and the Cahiers du Cinema.\n\nFollow Us on Twitter!@Had_Oscar_BuzzJoe: @joereidChris: @chrisvfeil\n\nWhy not derail an originally planned episode to close pride season with a beloved queer 90s film with three praised performances? In 1995,Â To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie NewmarÂ spun a tale of three drag queens on a road trip that get stranded in middle America. Its headliners were two macho movie stars in Patrick Swayze and Wesley Snipes and one emerging theatre actor in John Leguizamo, resulting in Globe nominations for Swayze and Leguizamo. One of a few of the 90s drag centric movie hits,Â To Wong FooÂ was ignored by the Academy for both its performances and its costumes, a category won byÂ The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the DesertÂ the previous year.\n\nThis episode, we unpack how the film has stood the test of time in the queer canon and the performances from these straight performers. We also discuss the filmâs divine female ensemble, how the film holds up to contemporary expectations for queer cinema, and title punctuation.\n\nTopics also include favorite outfits from Snipesâ Noxeema Jackson, the drag road trip movie tradition, and 1995 Best Supporting Actor.\n\nFollow Us on Twitter!@Had_Oscar_BuzzJoe: @joereidChris: @chrisvfeil\n\nWe return this week to one of the Oscar years we bemoan the most, 2011, to talk about Jeff NicholsâÂ Take Shelter. After Michael Shannon landed a surprise acting nomination forÂ Revolutionary Road, it seemed heâd somewhat cornered the market on onscreen psychosis. In this film, he plays a rural father who begins to see apocalyptic visions that may or may not be coming to fruition. As his wife, Jessica Chastain would make her debut when the film premiered to Sundance audiences, already amassing a reputation as the next big thing due to the several films she had coming, including Terrence MalickâsÂ The Tree of Life.\n\nThis episode, we talk about Shannonâs onscreen persona and how it may shade our perceptions of this film. We also talk about howÂ The HelpÂ became the film that Chastain was Oscar nominated for in her breakthrough year, Kathy Baker inÂ Edward Scissorhands, and the filmâs divisive ending.\n\nTopics also include Sundance 2011 movies, theÂ Death Becomes HerÂ musical, and cozy culture during the apocalypse.\n\nFollow Us on Twitter!@Had_Oscar_BuzzJoe: @joereidChris: @chrisvfeil"
