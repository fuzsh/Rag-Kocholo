I remember discovering it in high school on HBO, and being shocked how gritty it was. It follows Vanessa Lutz, a teenage juvenile delinquent on the run from a social worker after her mother gets arrested for prostitution. She is traveling to her grandmother's house who she’s never instead of being out in foster care again, and on this journey she meets and is then hounded by a charming, but sadistic, serial killer and pedophile. Written/directed by Matthew Bright, this is a filthy and unhinged film that is as wild and trashy as you’d expect by the plot line. I love how he took from 70’s exploitation both in the road film elements and the women prison films and just crafted such an entertaining and violent film. Danny Elfman delivers one of his most underrated scores, one that harkens more to his work with Oingo Boingo than his work with Burton.  This is Reese Witherspoon at her feistiest, full of nihilism and I love it. \n.\n.\nShe has always worn her southern roots proudly, and her accent in this might be her best aside from her work in ‘Walk The Line’. It was a perfect role from her at the point of her career since she had mainly played innocent roles, and I love her energy here , especially as she delivers some banger one liners and dials it up to 11. For me, it’s honestly one of her best performances, and her sex appeal is fantastic here. Kiefer Sutherland just has one of these voices that works so good in villain roles. Similar to his work in ‘Phonebooth’, it gives you the creeps and while he first comes off nice, you just know he’s going to switch any minute and it’s a fun process to see. Once he really shows his true colors, he becomes of the sleaziest and down right nasty characters ever put on screen. While they are the two main highlights, there’s fun appearances from Brittany Murphy, Brook Shields, Bokeem Woodbine, Alanna Ubach and Amanda Plummer. I highly recommend this for those who like really wild and fun films that don’t hold back, and it’s available on Prime, Tubi, AMC+ and Freevee, so there’s options.\".",
