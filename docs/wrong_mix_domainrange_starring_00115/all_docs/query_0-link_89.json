While some stars seem to always be the nominee and never the winner, other celebrities have never even had the honor of an Oscar nod.

There are plenty of stars who come up short in the awards department — at least as far as the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences is concerned. While some stars seem to always be the nominee and never the winner, other celebrities have never even had the honor of an Oscar nod. Scroll through to find out which stars are still waiting on their gold statues:\n\nCredit: Jeff Spicer/Getty Images\n\nMargot Robbie\n\nRobbie earned a Best Actress nomination in 2018 for I, Tonya and a Best Supporting Actress nod in 2020 for Bombshell. However, the Australia native has yet to win big at the awards ceremony.\n\nIn 2024, Robbie was left out of the Best Actress category for her titular role as Barbie, although the film, which Robbie coproduced, earned a Best Picture nomination.\n\nCredit: Matt Baron/BEI/Shutterstock\n\nAngela Bassett\n\nAfter playing Tina Turner in What's Love Got to Do with It, Bassett was up for Best Actress in a Leading Role in 1994 but lost to The Piano's Holly Hunter. Nearly 20 years later, she was nominated for Best Actress in a Supporting Role after playing Queen Ramonda in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\n\nCredit: David Fisher/BAFTA/Shutterstock\n\nSaoirse Ronan\n\nThe rising star has been nominated for four Oscars so far in her short career, but has yet to win. She is up for Little Women in 2020.\n\nCredit: Steve Granitz/WireImage\n\nScarlett Johansson\n\nJohansson may have a massive contract for her Marvel films (she’s been a part of the franchise since 2010), but the one thing this superhero doesn’t have is an Oscar. She is nominated twice in 2020 for Marriage Story, however.\n\nCredit: Steve Granitz/WireImage\n\nEmily Blunt\n\nSpoonfuls of sugar, sure, but an Oscar? Not quite. The six-time Golden Globe nominee (and one-time winner) doesn’t yet have a little golden statue to call her own. However, she earned a Best Supporting Actress nomination in 2024 for her performance in Oppenheimer.\n\nCredit: Jason Merritt/Getty Images\n\nJennifer Aniston\n\nShe may be America’s sweetheart, but the Friends alum has never even been nominated for an Academy Award despite her more serious roles in films such as The Good Girl and Cake. She did, however, win a Golden Globe for her famous role on her long-running NBC hit.\n\nCredit: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic\n\nBradley Cooper\n\nCooper, who was admittedly “embarrassed” not to have been nominated for his directorial work on A Star Is Born in 2019, has been on a losing streak at the Oscars since 2013, when he was first nominated for best actor in Silver Linings Playbook.\n\nCredit: Kevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nJim Carrey\n\nThe comedian has been making Us laugh on screen for decades — since 1983, to be exact — but his work has never resulted in an Oscar nod, even when taking a turn for the serious (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, anyone?).\n\nCredit: Mike Marsland/Mike Marsland/WireImage\n\nHugh Grant\n\nThe Brit got cheeky after he was nominated for a Golden Globe in 2019 for his work on TV in A Very English Scandal, but he hasn’t had the opportunity to do the same for the Oscars; the Love Actually star has yet to be nominated.\n\nCredit: Samir Hussein/WireImage.com\n\nHugh Jackman\n\nThe Greatest Showman star has both a Golden Globe and an Emmy to speak of, but as for an Academy Award, he’s 0 for 1: Jackman was nominated in 2013 for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role for Les Misérables.\n\nCredit: Ian West/PA Images via Getty Images\n\nRyan Gosling\n\nDespite his bonafide movie star status, Gosling has zero Oscars to speak of. He was nominated for Best Actor in 2006 and 2016 for Half Nelson and La La Land, respectively, and earned a Best Supporting Actor nod in 2024 for his portrayal of Ken in Barbie.\n\nCredit: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nJude Law\n\nLaw has struck out two times in the Oscar-winning department: The Alfie star lost out for Best Actor in a Leading Role for Cold Mountain in 2004 and Best Actor in a Supporting Role for The Talented Mr. Ripley in 2000.\n\nCredit: Ian West/PA Images via Getty Images\n\nMark Wahlberg\n\nWahlberg’s career has done a 180 since his days in Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, but the Fear star didn’t bag a win for either nomination he received for 2011’s Best Motion Picture of the Year for The Fighter or 2007’s Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role for The Departed.\n\nCredit: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty\n\nMichelle Williams\n\nHey, Marilyn Monroe never won an Oscar either! The Dawson's Creek alum has been nominated four times through the years but has yet to hold a gold statue. Her first nomination came for her supporting role in 2005's Brokeback Mountain, followed by three best actress nods for 2010's Blue Valentine, 2012's My Week With Marilyn and 2016’s Manchester by the Sea.\n\nCredit: Dan MacMedan/WireImage\n\nJohn Travolta\n\nBelieve it or not, this Phenomenon of an actor can’t yet count himself as a member of Hollywood’s elite club of Oscars winners. He does, however, have two best actor nominations to speak of for his work in 1977’s Saturday Night Fever and 1994’s Pulp Fiction.\n\nCredit: Kevin Winter/Getty\n\nJohnny Depp\n\nCould it be the curse of the Black Pearl? Depp is known for his quirky characters like Captain Jack Sparrow and Edward Scissorhands, but Tim Burton's male muse hasn't been able to score an Oscar. He was nominated three times: Once in 2004 for Pirates of the Caribbean, again in 2005 for Finding Neverland and a third time in 2008 for his role in Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.\n\nCredit: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty\n\nHelena Bonham Carter\n\nBonham Carter was nominated for her lead role in The Wings of the Dove in 1998, and again in 2011 for her supporting role in The King's Speech, but she doesn’t yet have a win.\n\nCredit: George Pimentel/WireImage.com\n\nKeira Knightley\n\nIs it pride or prejudice? Though plenty of the films she's starred in have gone on to win Oscars (Atonement and Anna Karenina, to name a few), British-born actress Knightley doesn't have one of her own. She was nominated in 2006 for her lead role in the adaptation of Pride & Prejudice and again in 2015 for her supporting role in The Imitation Game.\n\nCredit: Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic\n\nTom Cruise\n\nHe may be one of Hollywood’s leading men, but Cruise certainly isn't top dog at the Oscars: The box-office star (whose ex-wife Nicole Kidman is an Oscar winner) has earned three nominations — for 1989's Born on the Fourth of July, for 1996's Jerry Maguire and for 1999's Magnolia — but winning has proven to be Mission: Impossible.\n\nCredit: Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty\n\nHarrison Ford\n\nNot even one for Indy?! Iconic Indiana Jones star Ford has only received one Oscar nomination — for 1985's Witness — but the force is not with him when it comes to taking home the gold.\n\nCredit: Taylor Hill/FilmMagic\n\nAmy Adams\n\nKeep hustlin'! Adams has received a total of six Oscars nominations, but so far hasn't won one. She has been nominated for her roles in 2005's Junebug, 2008's Doubt, 2010's The Fighter, 2012's The Master, 2013’s American Hustle and 2018's Vice.\n\nCredit: Mike McGregor/Getty\n\nSteve Buscemi\n\nHe has one of the most memorable faces in Hollywood and has even starred in Oscar-winning movies, but the Boardwalk Empire star and Golden Globe winner has yet to pick up a nomination.\n\nCredit: Eugene Gologursky/Getty\n\nLaura Linney\n\nDespite her family's theater background, New York native Linney hasn't managed to score the highest honor for her acting. She's been nominated for three Oscars, however, for 2000's You Can Count on Me, 2004's Kinsey and 2007's The Savages."
