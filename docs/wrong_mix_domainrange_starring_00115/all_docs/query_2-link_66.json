        "text": "I was reading some information about Emile Hirsch when I saw a quote he’d made that I thought was really cool. This led me down a rabbit hole of actor quotes from the IMDb website. So the following are all quotes with just one thing in common: I found them interesting, funny, or for some reason they jumped out at me.\n\n“I’m too tall to be a girl, I never had enough dresses to be a lady, I wouldn’t call myself a woman. I’d say I’m somewhere between a chick and a broad.”\n\n– Julia Roberts\n\n“I have a theory that everyone’s crazy anyway. And those who think they aren’t, are the ones who are even crazier – because they’re in denial.”\n\n– Michael Fassbender\n\n“This is a career about images. It’s celluloid; they last for ever. I’m a black woman from America. My people were slaves in America, and even though we’re free on paper and in law, I’m not going to allow you to enslave me on film, in celluloid, for all to see.”\n\n– Angela Bassett\n\n“I never thought I’d land in pictures with a face like mine.”\n\n– Audrey Hepburn\n\n“You never really learn much from hearing yourself talk.”\n\n– George Clooney\n\n“I’ve often been mistaken for Meryl Streep, although never on Oscar night.”\n\n– Glenn Close\n\n“I act for free, but I demand a huge salary as compensation for all the annoyance of being a public personality. In that sense, I earn every dime I make.”\n\n– Michelle Pfeifer\n\n“I don’t want to spread the peanut butter of my personality on the mouldy bread of the commercial press.”\n\n– Marlon Brando\n\n“I’m one of those strange beasts who really likes a corset.”\n\n– Cate Blanchett\n\n“My mother used to tell this corny story about how the doctor smacked me on the behind when I was born and I thought it was applause, and I have been looking for it ever since.”\n\n– Kathy Bates\n\n“Think slow, act fast.”\n\n– Buster Keaton\n\n“I fight cynicism. It’s too easy. It’s really boring. It’s much harder to be positive and see the wonder of everything. Cynicism is a bunch of people who aren’t as talented as other people, knocking them because they make them feel even more untalented.”\n\n– Ewan McGregor\n\n“I think diverse stories are just stories. I don’t think ‘diverse’ is an add-on package. Things that are not diverse are weird because that’s not accurate.”\n\n– Daniel Kaluuya\n\n“I hate violence, yes I do. It’s kind of a dilemma, huh?”\n\n– Jackie Chan\n\n“Be yourself. The world worships the original.”\n\n– Ingrid Bergman\n\n“I know what I’m capable of doing and what I’m capable of not doing. To be perfectly honest, I’m a little afraid of doing a straight dramatic film. I’m not saying I couldn’t do it. I’m saying I’m afraid to. Everyone is afraid of failure.”\n\n– Eddie Murphy\n\n“James Dean taught me not to speed, River Phoenix taught me not to DO speed, and Marlon Brando taught me to slow down on the cheeseburgers.”\n\n– Emile Hirsch\n\nCongratulations Into the Wild. This is your week.\n\nAnd the Oscar goes to…\n\nBest Actress: Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate in Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood\n\nBest Actor: Aside from Emile, let’s give this week to Hal Holbrook who was nominated for an Oscar for his performance in Into the Wild\n\nBest Quote: “Anything in life worth doing is worth overdoing. Moderation is for cowards.” – Alexander Ludwig as Shane Patton\n\nMy top 10 favourite movies with a character having to survive the wilderness:\n\n127 Hours (2010)\n\nLife of Pi (2012)\n\nDeliverance (1972)\n\nThe Mountain Between Us (2017)\n\nLeave No Trace (2018)\n\nThe Wild (2014)\n\nCast Away (2000)\n\nThe Revenant (2015)\n\nInto the Wild (2007)\n\nApocalypto (2006)\n\n…there was a stable boy who fell in love with a beautiful movie list. This is their story:\n\nHere is my attempt to list the top 10 fairy tale movies of all time (Two actually: one for non-animated and one animated.). This will not be a list of my own favourites, though I’m sure it will be influenced by them. It also only includes movies I’ve seen, so correct me if I’ve left an important one out.\n\nTHE CRITERIA:\n\nDictionary.com defines ‘fairytale’ as “a children’s story about magical and imaginary beings and lands.” I’ve also come to discover that they are often short (shorter anyway) stories than that of, say, Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter. They are also intended for children, so I did not include Brothers Grimm (2005) or Big Fish (2003). I also left off a personal favourite, Pan’s Labyrinth (2006), as it can be a little too scary for children.\n\nNow with the list credo out of the way, here is the list:\n\nPART I: The Ultimate Top 10 LIVE ACTION Fairy Tale Movies:\n\nAlice in Wonderland (2010)\n\nMaleficent (2014)\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005) <I nearly excluded this one, but it is clearly a stand-alone movie despite its being a part of a franchise.>\n\nThe NeverEnding Story (1984)\n\nHook (1992)\n\nEdward Scissorhands (1990) <Maybe this one is too high? It’s one of my own favourites…>\n\nEver After (1998)\n\nEnchanted (2007)\n\nThe Princess Bride (1987)\n\nThe Wizard of Oz (1937)\n\nHonourable Mentions: Into the Woods (2014); Willow (1988); Gulliver’s Travels (2010); Inkheart (2008); Bridge to Terabithia (2007); Penelope (2006); Peter Pan (2003); Bedtime Stories (2008); Ladyhawke (1985); Where the Wild Things Are (2009)\n\nPART II: The Ultimate Top 10 ANIMATED Fairy Tale Movies:\n\nSpirited Away (2001)\n\nAladdin (1992)\n\nSleeping Beauty (1959)\n\nPinocchio (1940)\n\nThe Little Mermaid (1989)\n\nTangled (2010)\n\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) <This one gets its high spot based mainly on its groundbreaking influence. Most of the preceding movies I’d say are much better.>\n\nFrozen (2012) <And this one gets its high spot based on the opinions of actual children all over the world.>\n\nCinderella (1955)\n\nBeauty and the Beast (1991)\n\nHonourable Mentions: Peter Pan (1953); Alice in Wonderland (1951); Anastasia (1997); Robin Hood (1973); The Princess and the Frog (2009)\n\nTechnically, one movie above doesn’t fit the description, though I think most everyone would consider it a fairy tale movie. Ever After doesn’t have the element of magic or fictional lands, but it is based on Cinderella, a story that is a 100% bona fide fairy tale. So it not only gets a pass to be included, but it also gets the high distinction of being our movie of the week.\n\nCongratulations Ever After. This is your week.\n\nAnd the Oscar goes to…\n\nBest Actress: Other than Barrymore, I saw we give the honours to as Cameron Diaz as Natalie in Charlie’s Angels\n\nBest Actor: Former WCW heavyweight champion David Arquette as Rob Geller in Never Been Kissed\n\nBest Quote: “This is horrible Alex, this is very bad! Unless you’re happy about this in which case I couldn’t be more pleased for you… Should we do pros and cons?” – Brad Garrett as Chris Riley in Music and Lyrics\n\nI found it interesting on one site I visited that listed The Matrix (1999) as a fairy tale movie. The webpage writers stated that they saw it as a kind of retelling of Alice in Wonderland.\n\nAlso, my own personal fairy tale favourites list would have The Princess Bride, Edward Scissorhands, and Hook at the top.\n\nThis week I was talking to someone who brought up Leonardo DiCaprio in conversation. They said it wasn’t until watching Gangs of New York (2002) that they “got it.” In other words, before seeing Leo in that movie, they didn’t see him as an actor they would pay a ticket to see. But after that movie, things changed.\n\nThis got me thinking of different actors and when I first really took notice. For instance, I’d seen Steve Buscemi in a number of movies in the 90’s and 00’s. Mostly it was comedic roles in Adam Sandler movies, but he also stood out in Fargo (1996), as he did for most of us. But it wasn’t until I had watched Reservoir Dogs (1992) that I saw him as a great actor and became a fan. Here are some others:\n\nTom Hanks: The ‘Burbs (1989). I enjoyed Tom Hanks a lot throughout the 80’s. He was great in Splash, Big, The Money Pit, etc. Yes, I thought he was funny, but it wasn’t until The ‘Burbs that I knew I’d be watching for every movie he comes out with and go see it (or rent it… most of the time it was rent it).\n\nChristian Bale: The Fighter (2010)\n\nRachel Weisz: About a Boy (2002)\n\nBenicio Del Toro: Traffic (2000)\n\nLaKeith Stanfield: The Harder They Fall (2021). I don’t know of a lot of people who have him high on their favourites list, but since watching this western two years ago is when I took notice of LaKeith Stanfield. I loved him in Judas and the Black Messiah, and he was in other movies I’d seen, but I didn’t recognize him afterward. Nor could I remember his name. His Cherokee Bill was even cooler than Dirty Harry in my mind.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix: Walk the Line (2005)\n\nRachel McAdams: Mean Girls (2004)\n\nKate and Leo: After Titanic (1997), these two had the impossible job of eclipsing their roles. For me it didn’t take long with Kate Winslet, but it did take seven years until she completely won me over in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004). For Leo, I first realized just how good he was when I watched Blood Diamond (2006), but kinda took me until 2012 to really embrace him after watching Django: Unchained.\n\nAlicia Vikander: The Light Between Oceans (2016)\n\nPaul Dano: There Will Be Blood (2007)\n\nDaniel Kaluuya: Widows (2018)\n\nSean Connery: First Knight (1995). It’s true. It took me that long. I remember seeing Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991) in a theatre and hearing the crowd gasp when the legendary 007 appeared on screen near the end. And I had to ask the person sitting with me who it was. I guess I hadn’t remembered him well enough from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade or Hunt for Red October, both ones loved. After seeing him as King Arthur alongside Julia Ormond and Richard Gere I had officially arrived late to the party.\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis: Gangs of New York (2002)\n\nCharlize Theron: Monster (2003)\n\nGeena Davis: A League of Their Own (1992)\n\nViola Davis: Fences (2016)\n\nJohn Cusack: High Fidelity (2000). As much as I enjoyed seeing him in films for 15 years prior, High Fidelity made him one of my all time favourites, and he still is.\n\nBrad Pitt: Snatch (2000)\n\nCongratulations Snatch. This is your week.\n\nBest Actress: Halle Berry as Audrey Burke in Things We Lost in the Fire. I actually haven’t seen this one, but HB always rocks. I’m sure she does in this one too.\n\nBest Actor: Aside from Del Toro, it’s fitting to give this to Brad Pitt as Mickey O’Neil in Snatch\n\nBest Quote: “You’re asking me how a watch works. For now we’ll just keep an eye on the time.” – Benicio Del Toro as Alejandro in Sicario\n\nTop 10 Benicio Del Toro Movies:\n\nReptile (2023)\n\nSicario (2015)\n\nSin City (2005)\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy (2014)\n\nAvengers: Infinity War (2018)\n\nAvengers: Endgame (2019)\n\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi (2017)\n\nThe Usual Suspects (1995)\n\nSnatch (2000)\n\nTraffic (2000)\n\nWe come out of Halloween season with some talking about how much they love horror movies with others asking, “How could you like those?” And now, in Remembrance Day season, I think of how many of us love war movies with many others not being able to understand why. I do concede that, like horror films, they’re not for everyone. And it’s not like every war movie is a good one. I’ve seen plenty that I wasn’t into. But I have a deep connection with war movies. It may not be my favourite genre, but my list of favourite war movies is a special list to me. Here is what I get from them that makes me love them so much:\n\nWAR IS HELL. We all love a good villain. They give us reason to love and cheer on a hero. To me, war is the ultimate movie monster. It’s not a moustache twirling, black top hat wearing villain, but it’s a very real antagonist that lives and thrives in our real lives. For me, it is good to, from time to time, face this enemy. To look it in the eye and and deal with its presence. It’s important to be mindful of what it has done and continues to do to my fellow humans all over the world and all through history. And the movie screen is a safe setting to do so (The only thing better is hearing stories firsthand from people who were there, whether in person or in a book.). I also believe it is possible for this villain to weaken and shrink, though I don’t know just how much of that will happen in my lifetime.\n\nHONOUR THE FALLEN. As much as it is NOT enjoyable to watch someone suffer and/or die, to see it played out realistically gives me the opportunity to connect with those who have made those sacrifices. I see you, soldier. Though I may not know your name, my heart is with you. Your pain and loss is not in vain.\n\nLIVE AND LEARN. One thing we all share (though the younger we are the less we are likely to admit it) is a love of learning new things. Every time I see a war movie for the first time I learn new stuff. Whether it’s how the fighting was done, the dynamics surrounding the event, or even what went on inside of the people serving.\n\nI guess that’s the best I can describe why I like a good war movie. So with that said, here is my top 10 favourite war films:\n\nThe Silent War (2019) — This was a big surprise for me. It’s a Spanish movie that had a brand new story and perspective I’d never heard before. Loved it.\n\nDas Boot (1981)\n\n1917 (2019)\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front (2022) — I need to rewatch the 1930 version. I think it will hit different after seeing this one last year.\n\nFury (2014)\n\nJojo Rabbit (2019)\n\nInglourious Basterds (2009)\n\nSaving Private Ryan (1998)\n\nDownfall (2004) — You may remember me talking about this one before. It’s in German and portrays that final days of Hitler during the Battle of Berlin. It is powerful and edge-of-your-seat storytelling.\n\nSchindler’s List (1993)\n\nCongratulations 1917. This is your week.\n\nBest Actress: Claire Duburcq as Lauri in 1917\n\nBest Actor: Alec Guinness as Prince Faisal in Lawrence of Arabia\n\nBest Quote: “You still think it’s beautiful to die for your country. The first bombardment taught us better. When it comes to dying for country, it’s better not to die at all.” – Lew Ayres as Paul in All Quiet on the Western Front (1930)\n\nIf anyone in Hollywood is listening, please make a movie about Vimy Ridge!. I just finished watching a short documentary on the event and there is so much that this story can give to a big budget Hollywood movie. The desperation and high stakes of the situation, the sacrifices made, the innovation and ingenuity that the Canadian army had to use to accomplish their objectives. It’s the stuff of legend. Please, please, please make it happen!"
