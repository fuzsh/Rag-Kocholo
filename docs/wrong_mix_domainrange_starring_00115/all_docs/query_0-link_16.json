        "text": "Now that we've passed the 300 episode mark, we are bringing back our old friend Kevin O'Keeffe and Texas native for a very Texas movie. Debuting in 2011 but arriving in theaters, Richard Linklater's Bernie accounts a real-life Texan wink wink bachelor Bernie Tiede (played by Jack Black), beloved by the church ladies and local community. However, he is taken in by the town villain Margie (Shirley MacLaine) and ends up convicted for her murder, but not necessarily in the court of public opinion. Though the film was recognized as comedy (especially for Black's delicate performance), its awards history was largely left as a footnote to the McConaissance.\n\nWe've hit another year of the podcast, arriving at our milestone 300th episode! No better way to celebrate that by finally revisiting one of the past decades most notorious bombs, 2016's Collateral Beauty. Starring Will Smith as a grieving father, this all-star cast includes Edward Norton, Michael Peña, and Kate Winslet as his three friend who devise a plan to... oust Smith from their advertising firm by... hiring three struggling actors (Helen Mirren, Keira Knightley, and Jacob Latimore) to... portray the concepts of Death, Love, and Time that he has been writing letters to, and make him appear mentally unstable. Yeah, this one goes some places!\n\nThis week's film has Joe and Chris on opposite sides of a divisive reception. The Matrix not only revolutionized genre filmmaking in 1999, but it resulted in a resounding Oscar success. Reception to its first two sequels in 2003 was decidedly unappreciative, but the franchise has received some critical reassessment in the two decades since. Enter 2021's The Matrix Resurrections, a COVID-delayed and incredibly meta revisiting of The Wachowski's science fiction world, this time with only Lana Wachowski at the helm. The last of Warner Bros.' films to be released simultaneously in theaters and online during the pandemic, Resurrections nearly cracked craft categories, but its timing proved unfortunate.\n\nThis episode, we talk about Oscars relationship to awarding franchises and overlooking later installments. We also talk about our opposing points of view on the film, how the film incorporates new cast members as stand-ins for the original lineup, and the film's bold meta elements.\n\nEarly in the 1990s, two westerns emerged as Best Picture winners when the genre was first thought dead: Kevin Costner's Dances with Wolves and Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. In 1993, those heralded actor-directors would unite for A Perfect World, casting Costner as an escaped convict who takes a small boy hostage and teaches him about masculinity, with Eastwood as the lawman in pursuit while also taking the directing reigns. That pedigree missed the Academy on this round, however, as the film's downer telling was a poor fit to the holiday season to which it was launched.\n\nThis episode, we talk about the early poor reception for Costner's new saga Horizon and our differing opinions on this film's approach to masculinity. We also talk about Eastwood's output in the 1990s, Laura Dern's underserved role as a criminologist, and how the film disappointed for denying audiences an onscreen showdown between its male stars.\n\nWhy not derail an originally planned episode to close pride season with a beloved queer 90s film with three praised performances? In 1995, To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar spun a tale of three drag queens on a road trip that get stranded in middle America. Its headliners were two macho movie stars in Patrick Swayze and Wesley Snipes and one emerging theatre actor in John Leguizamo, resulting in Globe nominations for Swayze and Leguizamo. One of a few of the 90s drag centric movie hits, To Wong Foo was ignored by the Academy for both its performances and its costumes, a category won by The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert the previous year.\n\nThis episode, we unpack how the film has stood the test of time in the queer canon and the performances from these straight performers. We also discuss the film's divine female ensemble, how the film holds up to contemporary expectations for queer cinema, and title punctuation.\n\nWe return this week to one of the Oscar years we bemoan the most, 2011, to talk about Jeff Nichols' Take Shelter. After Michael Shannon landed a surprise acting nomination for Revolutionary Road, it seemed he'd somewhat cornered the market on onscreen psychosis. In this film, he plays a rural father who begins to see apocalyptic visions that may or may not be coming to fruition. As his wife, Jessica Chastain would make her debut when the film premiered to Sundance audiences, already amassing a reputation as the next big thing due to the several films she had coming, including Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life.\n\nThis episode, we talk about Shannon's onscreen persona and how it may shade our perceptions of this film. We also talk about how The Help became the film that Chastain was Oscar nominated for in her breakthrough year, Kathy Baker in Edward Scissorhands, and the film's divisive ending.\n\nSay it with us: confusion! In our episodes where we have discussed 2020, one of the major conversations we've yet to really tackle is the confusion around what films would be considered theatrical while most of the country's theatres were closed. This week's film occupied that undefined space: Steven Soderbergh's ensemble comedy Let Them All Talk. Meryl Streep starred as a heralded author reunited on a cruise with old friends who may have inspired her work, played by Dianne Wiest and Candice Bergen. While at sea, conversations of art vs. commerce, authenticity, and inspiration play out in improvisational delight. But alas, no one knew whether Let Them All Talk was a movie or TV.\n\nThis week, we talk about Soderbergh's films made for HBO Max and the Oscar nominated performances we would swap out this year in favor of the LTAT women. We also talk about Streep's career post-The Devil Wears Prada, Wiest monologuing about the night sky, and Murphy Brown vs. Dan Quayle.\n\nThe May miniseries is over and we're kicking off June with a dose of movie monoculture with 2004's The Notebook. Adapted from the Nicholas Sparks romance novel, the film's journey to the screen attracted a range of huge Hollywood names from Steven Spielberg to Britney Spears. The tale of two lovers divided by class in the south, the film captured lightning in a bottle with Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams as the lovers and old school Hollywood legends James Garner and Gena Rowlands as their older versions facing dementia. Though Garner would see a SAG Supporting Actor nomination, the industry didn't recognize what would become a beloved classic.\n\nThis week, we talk about the film's double threat appeal between teens and their moms and how Gosling and McAdams recreated the film's iconic kiss at the MTV Movie Awards. We also talk about Gosling and McAdams' ascendant careers in the mid aughts, Joan Allen shouting \"trash!\", and the unmissable similarities between Sparks movie posters.\n\nThe 70s Spectacular comes to a close this week with actress Natalie Walker joining us to discuss 1979 and Milos Forman's adaptation of Hair. The brainchild of Galt MacDermot, Gerome Ragni, and James Redo, Hair took Broadway by storm in the late 1960s for its narrative and political audacity, presenting the free-love and anti-war hippie movement of the time. Forman wanted to bring the musical to the screen after seeing the Off-Broadway production, but wouldn't achieve that goal until after his One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest Oscar victory. This delay turned the once ripped-from-the-headlines musical into old news when it eventually became a film.\n\nThis episode, we discuss the 2009 Broadway revival and the changes made to the film to give the story a more linear structure. We also discuss the best hair of 1970s cinema, Dustin Hoffman being a monster on the set of Kramer vs. Kramer, and Actors Fund Benefit concerts.\n\nThe 1977 Oscar year is famously when Annie Hall triumphed over the cultural behemoth of Star Wars, but elsewhere Martin Scorsese followed up his Taxi Driver Best Picture nomination with a big swing and a miss. The Ankler's Katey Rich is back on the show to discuss New York, New York, Scorsese's attempt at a movie musical. Starring then-recent Oscar winners Liza Minnelli and Robert DeNiro as two post-WWII lovers whose creative ambitions clash with their relationship, the film received a critical drubbing for its pointed attempts at pastiche and its meandering length, and remains one of Scorsese's least seen and discussed films.\n\nThis episode, we get into what does and doesn't work in the film and how it gave us its indelible title track, later made infamous by Frank Sinatra. We also talk about the film's tangled behind-the-scenes relationship to Star Wars, the music branch snubbing Saturday Night Fever, and the surprising lack of current availability for 1970s films.\n\nWe're on to 1976 (go sign up for our Patreon for 1975 and our Exception episode on Tommy!) and Christina Tucker rejoins us to talk about the 70s Spectacular's wildest movie, The Ritz. From the play by Terrence McNally, the film is a mob farce set in a bathhouse with Jack Weston as a straight man hiding out from Jerry Stiller's mob boss and living legend Rita Moreno as the sex establishment's kooky cabaret headliner. Despite the pedigree of Oscar winner Moreno and then-newly-minted theatre icon McNally, The Ritz turned out to be a little too Looney Tunes for the stiff-upper-lip (and super straight) Academy.\n\n1974 brings us to one of the final films of Billy Wilder, which also reunited a screen duo beloved by both Oscar and audiences, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. Vulture writer Roxana Hadadi is back to the show to talk about The Front Page, an oft-adapted farce about newspapermen getting wrapped up in the case of an escaped convict. Most famously retold in a gender swapped version in His Girl Friday, this version stumbles to deliver the best of this director-star trio and missed Oscar's good graces despite multiple nominations in the decade for Mathau and Lemmon, including Lemmon's win the previous year.\n\nThis episode, we talk about the victory lap made by Francis Ford Coppola with The Godfather Part II and The Conversation both earning Oscar love. We also talk about the film's apoliticism was atypical of the moment, our love for Ingrid Bergman's Supporting Actress speech, and the hubbub over the acceptance speech for Best Documentary Feature Hearts and Minds.\n\nIn 1973, the Academy embraced horror in a big way by slapping cultural phenomenon The Exorcist with 10 nominations - but then The Sting would triumph over its success on Oscar night. Critic David Sims returns to the show to talk about a different iconic and formative horror title, Nicolas Rouge's Don't Look Now. With prestige stars Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie, the film follows a married couple grieving the loss of a child while working overseas in Venice. Clairvoyance, a serial killer, and disturbing visions all amount to a unique horror film that would influence many to come, but nevertheless one that the Academy was not ready to embrace.\n\nThis episode, we talk about the film's notorious sex scene and the film as an odd middle ground between The Exorcist and Last Tango in Paris. We also talk about how the reputation of the film's twist ending, Christie's Oscar legacy, and how Sutherland was never nominated for an Oscar ahead of his honorary win.\n\nThe 70s Spectacular is dancing as fast as it can! And we're spinning right into 1972 with one of the decade's biggest stars, the one and only Barbra Streisand, and joining us is one of her superfans, writer Jordan Hoffman. This year saw the first films of First Artists, a production company that intended to give more power to stars to create their passion projects the studios wouldn't touch. Streisand's first effort with the company was Up the Sandbox, a timely satire that cast the legend as a housewife faced with a third pregnancy, who retreats into her wild and often politically charged fantasies. Indifference from audiences and the industry made this one of Streisand's rare flops.\n\nThis episode, we talk about our love for Barbra and this legendary Oscar year that pit Cabaret against The Godfather. We also talk about the film's bizarre fantasy sequences, how it exists as a product of a specific moment in time, and cinematographer Gordon Willis' shockingly slim Oscar history.\n\nThe 70s Spectacular continues with critic and podcaster Katie Walsh joining us to discuss 1971 and Hal Ashby. After making his directorial debut with The Landlord after a career as an editor (including an Oscar win for In the Heat of the Night), Ashby returned to the director's chair for what might be the film that became his signature. Harold and Maude cast recent comedy breakthrough Bud Cort as a death-obsessed, disaffected youth who falls for a free spirit who just so happens to be 60 years older, played by recent Oscar winner Ruth Gordon.\n\nThis episode, we talk about Ashby's prolific career in the 1970s, where Harold and Maude would be his only film without Oscar nominations. We also talk about Gordon's three screenwriting Oscar nominations with her partner, Vivian Pickles' underpraised performance as Harold's mother, and the musical contributions of Cat Stevens.\n\nIt's time to kick off our May miniseries - the This Had Oscar Buzz: 70s Spectacular! For 1970, television writer Chris Schleicher joins us for a forgotten tale of wealth, deception, and Bavarian castles. The directorial debut of stage legend Hal Prince (and with a screenplay by his frequent collaborator Hugh Wheeler, from the novel The Cook by Harry Kressing), Something for Everyone starred a pre-Cabaret Michael York as a young man who weasel's his way into the good graces of a wealthy family in order to claim their family castle. As the family matriarch, Angela Lansbury earned a Golden Globe nomination that didn't translate to Oscar.\n\nThis episode, we talk about the 1970 Oscar year dominated by controversy surrounding George C. Scott's rejection of Oscar pomp and circumstance and this film's very obvious similarities to Saltburn. We also talk about Lansbury's Oscar and Tony run preceding the film, Michael York as canonical cinematic bisexual, and Prince's directorial failure adapting A Little Night Music.\n\nMay is upon us and that means it's time for another May miniseries! How could we top last year's 100 Years, 100... Snubs! success? Well, we'll be doing a deep dive into the Oscar era that was the 1970s! In the month of May, we will be looking back at each year of the decade with not only a discussion of a film from that year, but also the Oscar history of each year. Before that kicks off, here's your intro episode to get you excited for what's to come!\n\nWe're stoked for Challengers this week, so naturally we're talking about one of our favorites in the Luca Guadagnino resume, 2016's underdiscussed and hot as hell A Bigger Splash. Premiering at the 2015 Venice Film Festival and playing internationally in 2015, but opening late spring 2016 in the States, A Bigger Splash is a rock-and-roll-inflected tale of sex and ego that loosely remakes La Piscine. With a foursome of stellar performances by Tilda Swinton, Ralph Fiennes, Matthias Schoenaerts, and Dakota Johnson, the film earned strong notices especially for Fiennes' bawdy dance moves, but category confusion and the spring release hindered his chances.\n\nThis week, we talk about the film's portrayal of desire and deception, and how slyly the film weaves in themes of morality. We also discuss Tilda's vocal acting choice, Johnson's career emerging from 50 Shades, and the 2015 Venice jury. And we reveal the topic for the coming May miniseries!!\n\nIf you think we are too dismissive of westerns, allow this week's episode to contradict that notion! In 2018, Jacques Audiard made his English language debut with an adaptation of Patrick deWitt's novel The Sisters Brothers. John C. Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix starred as gunslinging assassin siblings in 19th century America, with both on the pursuit of a detective and a scientist (played respectively by a reunited Jake Gyllenhaal and Riz Ahmed) with a plot for gold. Despite the reputation of everyone involved, the film received a mild reception at fall festivals before a quiet September release.\n\nThis episode, we talk about the struggles of Annapurna to successfully switch from being a production house to a distributor. We also discuss the career of Reilly with the hopes of a career reappraisal, our feelings about the western genre and the attempts to revive it, and Audiard's French submission contender in A Prophet.\n\nWe're finally diving into the time capsule that is 2004's Garden State. The writing and directing debut of Zach Braff, the film stars Braff as a depressed actor who returns to his Jersey home to attend his mother's funeral. Once there, he reunites with former friends and maybe meets the love of his life (played by Natalie Portman in an urtext manic pixie dream girl mode) who helps him reevaluate his life. The film was a Sundance sensation and unleashed a gangbusters trailer package, igniting the love of young cinephiles, if not the Academy.\n\nThis episode, we discuss what about the film has aged poorly and its place in Fox Searchlight's very busy 2004. We also talk about the film's incredibly popular and definitive soundtrack, Portman's performance and career up to her first Oscar nomination, and Jackie Hoffman's brief performance in the film hilariously singing Lionel Ritchie."
