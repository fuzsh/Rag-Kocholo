We recommend verifying those before every trip to the theater.\n\nüìΩÔ∏è CRUCIAL VIEWING\n\nJonas Mekas‚Äô PARADISE NOT YET LOST (OONA‚ÄôS THIRD YEAR) (US/Experimental) and Steven Spielberg‚Äôs THE FABELMANS (US)\n\nGene Siskel Film Center (OONA) ‚Äì Friday, 8:15pm\n\nVarious Multiplexes (FABLEMANS) ‚Äì See Venue websites for showtimes\n\nIn a fruitful coincidence, Chicagoans have the opportunity this weekend to see two nakedly personal masterworks by two titans of American cinema, both in the format in which they were intended to be seen. Jonas Mekas‚Äô PARADISE NOT YET LOST (OONA‚ÄôS THIRD YEAR) (1979, 96 min, 16mm) will screen at the Siskel Center on 16mm, the same gauge as the film Mekas put in his trusty Bolex, while Steven Spielberg‚Äôs THE FABELMANS (2022, 150 min, DCP Digital) is still screening in multiplexes, those secular shrines to motion picture entertainment generally of the sort with which Spielberg was once synonymous. These are very similar films, straight down to their near-interchangeable titles. Spielberg‚Äôs largely autobiographical bildungsroman ends with the director‚Äôs stand-in, Sammy Fabelman, entering the paradise of the Hollywood studio system after having experienced dislocation, antisemitism, and his parents‚Äô messy divorce. As for Jonas Mekas, what was he if not a ‚Äúfable man,‚Äù an individual uprooted by war and displacement who found rebirth by capturing everything he experienced on camera? Mekas‚Äô diary films blur the line between home movies and avant-gardism, as the subject matter concerns his direct experience and the form employs rapid cutting and asynchronous sound to render that experience directly. PARADISE NOT YET LOST was inspired by the early development of the filmmaker‚Äôs daughter Oona; Mekas dedicated the movie to her, calling it ‚Äúa romantic‚Äôs guide to the essential values of life.‚Äù The onscreen action shows Mekas and family experiencing one blissful moment after another (visiting friends, meeting distant family members, traveling), and the presence of the camera seems to commemorate each one, make it that much more special. In turn, the film becomes an intimate connection between filmmaker and spectator‚Äîwhich, per THE FABELMANS, is a power inherent in all movies. One of the through lines of Spielberg‚Äôs film is that cinema not only serves as a bond between auteur and audience; it has the potential to serve as a secret between them. (The most opulent gift a filmmaker has given the Freudians since the heyday of Bertolucci, THE FABELMANS argues that the ideal spectator is always the filmmaker‚Äôs mother.) This association of pleasure with guilt and responsibility makes Spielberg‚Äôs film, which he wrote with Tony Kushner (the most valuable collaborator he‚Äôs had after Janusz Kaminski), feel supremely Jewish, in spite of the fact that it‚Äôs also a film about Jews‚Äô assimilation into American society. It‚Äôs complicated. I can‚Äôt explain how Spielberg makes the gentile actors Paul Dano and Michelle Williams, who play Sammy‚Äôs parents, seem acceptable, even lovable as Jews; it has something to do with how all the little details of the world they inhabit speak to a socially aspirational mid-century Jewish-American mentality. (For me, the movie inspired visceral memories of the homes of elderly relatives I visited as a boy.) Sammy‚Äôs interest in filmmaking as a technical process he can master parallels his father‚Äôs interest in early computing systems; the folkloric quality of a son inheriting his father‚Äôs scholasticism is one of the most Jewish things about THE FABELMANS. In the movie‚Äôs third act, Spielberg and Kushner hone in on another truth any Jew can confirm: that antisemites don‚Äôt care what you or your parents look like; their ignorance makes them hate you as they hate all Jews. Thanks to Spielberg‚Äôs extraordinarily rich visual language, he‚Äôs able to deliver dark observations about both cinema and secular Jewish life in a manner that‚Äôs never less than breathtaking. Spielberg has described the film as being like therapy in that it forced him to relive some of his most painful memories; he even makes the connection early in the film, when Sammy‚Äôs mother lets him recreate a train wreck on film so he stops having nightmares about them. Yet in rendering those memories through cinematic means (and how‚Äîit‚Äôs the sort of film where every lighting cue, prop, and focal length tells you something about the characters or their creator), he ends up revealing the psychological complexes behind a range of cinematic devices, including many he all but created. Why has Spielberg always shot his most personal films in the aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (this one included)? Because, as the first scene of THE FABELMANS explains, this is the most appropriate ratio for presenting a middle-class Jewish-American kitchen circa 1952. The film‚Äôs formal and thematic concerns coalesce in an audacious set piece that suggests something out of Michael Powell‚Äôs PEEPING TOM (another film with which THE FABELMANS has a lot in common), an unholy communion between a young man and his mother that only cinema could have made possible. [Ben Sachs]\n\n---\n\nAlso screening as part of the Jonas Mekas 100! series at the Gene Siskel Film Center are his 2000 ‚Äúmasterpiece of nothing,‚Äù AS I WAS MOVING AHEAD OCCASIONALLY I SAW BRIEF GLIMPSES OF BEAUTY (288 min, 16mm), on Saturday at 5pm, and his 2005 film A LETTER FROM GREENPOINT (80 min, Digital Projection) on Sunday at 5pm.

Bryn Mawr Ave.) ‚Äì Wednesday, 7:30pm\n\nA link between the New American Cinema of the 1970s and the blockbuster cinema of the 1980s and beyond, Bob Rafelson‚Äôs comic drama STAY HUNGRY evokes his FIVE EASY PIECES with its story of an orphaned Alabama steel heir, played by Jeff Bridges, seeking authenticity with a ragtag crew of bodybuilders at a Birmingham gym, but it also introduced moviegoers to Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose charismatic performance as a gentle Austrian weightlifter elevates the film. Sally Field costars as a woman working at the gym who leaves the bodybuilder for the heir but calls out the latter for his arrogance after he tries to show them off at a society party. Shooting on location in Birmingham, Rafelson captures not only local color (particularly a rural hoedown where Schwarzenegger is welcomed into a band of fiddlers) but also the rigid class lines in Dixie; this is a Hollywood production, but it draws on the peculiar energy of 70s regional filmmaking. Rafelson began to slide professionally after this, but of course Schwarzenegger ascended into the entertainment stratosphere. He would never have another role this fascinating or endearing‚Äîuntil he became governor of California, that is. Preceded by the 1936 Fleischer Studios short VIM, VIGOR, AND VITALIKY (7 min, 16mm). (1976, 102 min, 35mm) [J.R. Jones]\n\nSean Baker‚Äôs Fabulous Christmas Double Bill\n\n---\n\nPedro Almod√≥var's ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER (Spain)\n\nChicago Film Society at the Music Box Theatre ‚Äì Monday, 7pm\n\nIn ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER, Pedro Almodovar uses widescreen in a manner similar to Cukor and other such early masters of color-and-‚ÄòScope melodrama as Douglas Sirk and Vincente Minnelli, using widescreen to show off the lushness of his production design and augment the presence of his actors. MOTHER was the movie that cemented Almodovar‚Äôs international reputation as a modern master, and for obvious reasons. The mix of comedy and melodrama feels natural and confident (not provocative or intentionally jarring, as it was in the director‚Äôs early films), and it offers numerous life lessons that make you feel good. Like the melodramas of Sirk, Cukor, and Minnelli, it‚Äôs also an actors‚Äô showcase, featuring at least a dozen roles that allow the actors inhabiting them to shine. Not for nothing did Almodovar dedicate the film to three major actresses (Bette Davis, Gena Rowlands, and Romy Schneider); MOTHER celebrates not just actresses, but assertive, highly present women in general. (1999, 101 min, 35mm) [Ben Sachs]\n\n---\n\nScreening with Baker‚Äôs 2015 film TANGERINE (88 min) on a newly struck 35mm print.\n\nEliza Hittman's NEVER RARELY SOMETIMES ALWAYS (US)\n\nGene Siskel Film Center ‚Äì Monday, 6pm\n\nIt becomes evident early on in NEVER RARELY SOMETIMES ALWAYS, a film about a young woman seeking an abortion, that we‚Äôre not going to see or hear from the man who contributed to the unwanted pregnancy. It‚Äôs a conspicuous absence that bespeaks Hittman‚Äôs straightforwardly feminist attitude and approach, in which the denial of even the possibility of a male-controlled narrative necessarily returns focus and agency to the young woman, whose subjective experience take precedence above all else. The girl is Autumn (newcomer Sidney Flanigan), a diffident seventeen-year-old in rural Pennsylvania. Things are not great for her: at home, her deadbeat stepfather only shows affection for the dog, while on her supermarket shift she and her cousin Skylar (Talia Ryder) are subjected to ritual workplace harassment. One day, wondering if she‚Äôs pregnant, Autumn visits a local clinic and is given an over-the-counter drugstore test (one among many details in the film indicating the sorry state of healthcare in the US). It comes back positive. Discovering that Pennsylvania disallows women under eighteen from getting an abortion without parental consent, Autumn embarks to New York City with Skylar, aiming to have the procedure done with Planned Parenthood. Working in her preferred mode of muted urban realism, Hittman avoids the myriad obvious, didactic dimensions this material might‚Äôve taken on under a different writer-director. This means a narrative devoid of polemics, one that respects Autumn‚Äôs journey as the private one she experiences, rather than as the public political lightning rod it becomes in the eyes of a fanatical, patriarchal society. Hittman trusts that it‚Äôs enough to simply observe all the mundane socioeconomic and gender barriers Autumn‚Äôs forced to endure‚Äîsomething she does with a numbed impassivity suggesting how naturalized such factors are‚Äîto understand how stacked the deck is against women‚Äôs bodily autonomies. Yet NEVER RARELY SOMETIMES ALWAYS doesn‚Äôt advance a sense of hopelessness, and doesn‚Äôt, despite its success in capturing vexing bureaucracy and dour milieus, wish to condemn American social welfare as totally broken. Instead, it upholds the necessity of the systems that do work, and betrays a faith in the ability of both collective and individual action to pull through. In the shattering scene that gives the film its title, Autumn is prompted to respond to questions about her sexual past. Flanigan goes from forthcoming to paralyzed with emotion across one viscerally impactful take, her eyes downcast as she tries to hold back tears. She doesn‚Äôt have to answer, not to the counselor or to us. It‚Äôs her choice. (2020, 101 min, DCP Digital) [Jonathan Leithold-Patt]\n\nJerzy Skolimowski‚Äôs EO (Poland/UK/Italy)\n\nGene Siskel Film Center ‚Äì See Venue website for showtimes\n\nIn 2022, Steven Spielberg retrofitted JAWS for IMAX theaters, transforming a classic film into a towering, visceral experience. One might say that Jerzy Skolimowski did the same thing that year with Robert Bresson‚Äôs AU HASARD BALTHAZAR (1966); his quasi-remake EO (a prizewinner at Cannes) is a big screen experience par excellence, with large-scale imagery and booming sound design that make you feel the titular donkey‚Äôs suffering in your bones. Some might balk at Skolimowski‚Äôs decision to put his spin on Bresson‚Äôs allegorical masterpiece‚Äîwhich is beyond question one of the greatest films ever made‚Äîyet such an audacious move is in keeping with this major artist, who first came to prominence in the early 1960s as an acclaimed poet and a figurehead of Poland‚Äôs postwar youth culture. The director‚Äôs ‚Äò60s work remains astounding in its freewheeling energy and inspired visual metaphors (it‚Äôs worth noting that, after Bresson, he was one of the European filmmakers that Cahiers du cin√©ma championed the most in that decade); this period culminated with the blunt social critique of his 1967 production HANDS UP!, which was so incendiary that it more or less got him exiled from his native country (moreover, he wasn‚Äôt able to complete the film until 1981). After that, Skolimowski made movies in several other countries (including the US) before returning to Poland in the 1990s. The handful of films he‚Äôs made since then feel less indebted to his work as poet than his work as a painter, which has occupied much of his time in the past several decades. Indeed, EO contains an abundance of striking images, and these drive the film more than the loose narrative, which follows a donkey in his travails after he leaves the circus where he‚Äôs performed. The animal‚Äôs misfortunes mirror those of contemporary Europe; the most upsetting episode is probably the one that concerns the violent activity of a thuggish group of modern-day nationalists. A late episode in the film with guest star Isabelle Huppert works in some anticlerical sentiment that feels more akin to Bu√±uel than Bresson, while the final episode approaches the apocalyptic feelings of Bresson‚Äôs last two features, THE DEVIL, PROBABLY (1977) and L‚ÄôARGENT (1983). It‚Äôs a grim work, to be sure, yet Skolimowski‚Äôs immersive camerawork alleviates the proceedings, reminding us (as Bresson did) how miraculous the cinematic form can be. (2022, 86 min, DCP Digital) [Ben Sachs]\n\nAlternative Christmas Features\n\nMusic Box Theatre ‚Äì See Venue website for showtimes\n\nStanley Kubrick's EYES WIDE SHUT (UK)\n\nTuesday, 4pm and 7:30pm\n\nIt took more than a decade‚Äôs remove from its initial release for many to finally begin to understand Kubrick's final film, which is set in a facsimile of contemporary New York but heeds closely to the psychology and sexual mores of the 1924 novella on which it is based. This discrepancy sparked incurious outrage in 1999‚Äîparticularly among writers in the New York Times, who actually seemed offended by the lack of realism‚Äîbut it's come to resonate as one of the deepest mysteries of the director's monumental career. For Martin Scorsese, who placed the film in his top five for the entire decade, it's about New York as it appears in a dream. \"And as with all dreams,\" he wrote, \"you never know precisely when you've entered it. Everything seems real and lifelike, but different, a little exaggerated, a little off. Things appear to happen as if they were preordained, sometimes in a strange rhythm from which it's impossible to escape. Audiences really had no preparation for a dream movie that didn't announce itself as such, without the usual signals‚Äîhovering mists, people appearing and disappearing at will or floating off the ground. Like Rossellini's VOYAGE IN ITALY, another film severely misunderstood in its time, EYES WIDE SHUT takes a couple on a harrowing journey, at the end of which they're left clinging to each other. Both are films of terrifying self-exposure. They both ask the question: How much trust and faith can you really place in another human being? And they both end tentatively, yet hopefully. Honestly.\" Kubrick arrived at this combination of mystery and exposure through singular working methods unlikely to be repeated in a major studio film. In one of the longest shoots in movie history, Kubrick spent weeks on individual scenes, running actors through conversations until they were no longer conscious of performing. He had pursued this sort of marathon process before‚Äîmost notably on THE SHINING and FULL METAL JACKET‚Äîbut never on material so explicitly psychological. As a result, even superstars like Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman (giving their finest performances as a wealthy married couple) seem unfamiliar and strangely vulnerable. But EYES WIDE SHUT is only truly unsettling on contemplation: on the surface, it's one of Kubrick's funniest (with some of the most eccentric supporting performances in anything he made after THE KILLING) and most luminous, capturing the allure of Manhattan in winter with remarkably simple lighting arrangements. (1999, 159 min, 35mm) [Ben Sachs]\n\n---\n\nTim Burton's EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (US)\n\nWednesday, 4:30pm and 9:40pm and Thursday, 7pm\n\nAfter the success of BATMAN, Tim Burton was able to pull out all the stops for this personal take on teenage suburban isolation and got twice the budget that was originally planned. The title character is based on drawings Burton made while growing up in Burbank, where he struggled to keep friends and often retreated into painting and stop-motion animation. This contemporary fairy tale vacillates between elements that would be right at home in a Universal horror film and a stylized set of pastel tract homes, emphasizing Burton's mixed feelings about the American middle class. Johnny Depp's portrayal of the meek and scarred Edward is among his finest performances, notable for his character's economy of dialogue and cautious demeanor. The incomplete construction of a deceased inventor (played by Vincent Price), Edward stands in for every adolescent who would rather be left alone to make art than conform in order to make friends. Dianne Wiest is wonderful as the Avon Lady who finds Edward in the abandoned mansion on a hill and takes him home to join the cookie cutter enclave below. Frightened by his outward appearance but seeing the gentle prince underneath, her motherly efforts to integrate him into the conservative town are doomed from the start. But there is magic in both of their hearts, and eye-candy galore for us. (1990, 105 min, 35mm) [Jason Halprin]\n\n---\n\nTim Burton‚Äôs BATMAN RETURNS (US)\n\nWednesday, 7pm and Thursday 4:20pm\n\nNo one else captures the nostalgic kitsch and dark melancholy of Christmastime with perfect balance like Tim Burton. His first feature after one of his other Christmas classics, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (1990), BATMAN RETURNS shifts the gloomy holiday cheer from the suburbs to Gotham City. The constructed sets and detailed production design have produced some of the most iconic images in a career filled with memorable visuals. The story involves Gotham industrial businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) teaming up with twisted crime lord Penguin (Danny DeVito), who‚Äôs searching for his origins. Superhero vigilante Batman (Michael Keaton) is out to stop them, but everyone‚Äôs plans are complicated by Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer), Shreck‚Äôs meek secretary who seeks revenge against her boss as the formidable, whip-brandishing, latex-wearing Catwoman. It's hard to argue that this isn‚Äôt Pfeiffer‚Äôs movie, as the submissive cat lady violently transforms into the dominant Catwoman, one of the great cinematic femme fatales. Her early scenes, set in her baby pink apartment, where Selina talks to herself to cope with the loneliness of her life are unexpectedly moving, so much so that her story looms over the other character‚Äôs. Through her, the film presents complex themes about duality and female sexuality. She also helps to make the film more noir than anything else, despite its titular superhero; like its conflicted approach to the holiday season, BATMAN RETURNS is funny and morbid, beautiful and grotesque, ridiculous and sincere‚Äîone of Burton‚Äôs best. (1992, 126 min, 35mm) [Megan Fariello]\n\nThe 39th Annual Music Box Christmas Sing-A-Long & Double Feature\n\nMusic Box Theatre ‚Äì See Venue website for showtimes\n\nFrank Capra's IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (US)\n\nLike Steven Spielberg today, Frank Capra was associated more with reassuring, patriotic sentiment than with actually making movies; but just beneath the Americana, his films contain a near-schizophrenic mix of idealism and resentment. In this quality, as well as his tendency to drag charismatic heroes through grueling tests of faith, it wouldn't be a stretch to compare Capra with Lars von Trier. There's plenty to merit the comparison in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE alone: The film is a two-hour tour of an honest man's failure and bottled-up resentment, softened only intermittently by scenes of domestic contentment. Even before the nightmarish Pottersville episode (shot in foreboding shadows more reminiscent of film noir than Americana), Bedford Falls is shown as vulnerable to the plagues of recession, family dysfunction, and alcoholism. All of these ills weigh heavy on the soul of George Bailey, a small-town Everyman given tragic complexity by James Stewart, who considered the performance his best. Drawing on the unacknowledged rage within ordinary people that he would later exploit for Alfred Hitchcock, Stewart renders Bailey as complicated as Capra himself‚Äîa child and ultimate victim of the American Dream. It's because the film's despair feels so authentic that its iconic ending feels as cathartic as it does: After being saved from his suicide attempt (which frames the entire film), Stewart is returned to the simple pleasures of family and friends, made to seem a warm oasis in a great metaphysical void. (1946, 130 min, DCP Digital) [Ben Sachs]\n\n---\n\nMichael Curtiz's WHITE CHRISTMAS (US)\n\nCritics agree that Mark Sandrich's HOLIDAY INN (1942), the first musical comedy to feature Bing Crosby, an inn, and Irving Berlin's \"White Christmas,\" is a better film than this partial remake. Yet it turns out that it's revivals of this Technicolor, VistaVision version that people look forward to this time of year. WHITE CHRISTMAS incorporates the history of its own title song, which, while it would go on to become perhaps history's largest-seller, actually seemed a flop at first. Music historians Dave Marsh and Steve Propes note, \"What saved 'White Christmas' were requests made by GIs to Armed Forces Radio around the world. Soldiers away from home, many of them in the South Pacific or North Africa, uncertain of whether they'd ever again see family and friends, let alone a snowfall, responded passionately to Berlin's understated evocation of the mythic romance of Christmas Past.\" This history is folded into the opening scene: it's Christmas Eve, 1944, somewhere on a World War II battlefield, and Crosby sings the song to fellow troops amidst some very fake rubble, as bombs explode in the background. The movie's got Crosby and Danny Kaye as music-and-lyrics team Wallace and Davis, and Vera-Ellen and Rosemary Clooney as sister act the Haynes. They're a treat to watch even just sitting around a railroad passenger car singing \"Snow,\" bound for Pine Tree, Vermont, where the inn turns out to be run by ex-General Waverly (Dean Jagger). When people gather for a screening of this movie, I doubt they worry that it may not rank with Michael Curtiz's best work (CASABLANCA, YANKEE DOODLE DANDY, MILDRED PIERCE). They come to mark the change of years together. If there's a season for nestling in the warmth of nostalgia, it's this one. Plus, there's the camp appeal of Crosby and Kaye doing \"Sisters.\" (1954, 120 min, DCP Digital) [Scott Pfeiffer]\n\nüìΩÔ∏è ALSO RECOMMENDED\n\nReid Davenport‚Äôs I DIDN‚ÄôT SEE YOU THERE (US/Documentary)\n\nGene Siskel Film Center ‚Äì Friday, 6pm\n\nOne day in the Oakland, California, neighborhood where disabled director Reid Davenport lives, a red-and-yellow circus tent was erected. Circuses are an entertainment from a bygone era, yet they live on both in modified form and as shorthand for such modern concepts as political inclusiveness (‚Äúbig tent‚Äù), mayhem (‚Äúthree-ring circus‚Äù), and blockbusters (‚Äútentpole‚Äù films). This big top that confronted Davenport in his daily life was a source of great irritation as a reminder of the freak shows that were an integral means of getting people to come out to the circus. In his first feature-length documentary, Davenport decided to give audiences a front-row seat on what it‚Äôs like to see the world from a wheelchair. Equipped with a new camera better suited to shooting from his motorized ‚Äúlegs,‚Äù the director goes about his business in a city where he was forced to settle to have access to public transportation and nearby conveniences that were not available in his hometown of Bethel, Connecticut‚Äîironically, the birthplace of circus impresario P.T. Barnum, whose bronze statue we see when Davenport goes home to visit his family. Many people know and say hello to Davenport when he is out and about, but others are casually blind to how they interfere with his ability to get around. One group unloads their car at the curb ramp, causing him to wait until they move. In one intense scene, an electrical cord is strung in front of the ramp Davenport uses to get to his front door. He barely contains his anger and unleashes it with one long ‚ÄúFUUUUUUCCCCK‚Äù when he gets indoors. But the film is not entirely about his invisibility to the able-bodied. It is also about what he sees that those of us who don‚Äôt navigate a wheelchair never do‚Äîthe abstract movement of pavement underneath his speeding wheels, the geometric wallpaper of a chain link fence he captures as he rides down the street. I DIDN‚ÄôT SEE YOU THERE does what all great films do‚Äîprovide a unique vision of our world that helps us understand the variety of human experience. Director in attendance. (2022, 76 min, Digital Projection) [Marilyn Ferdinand]\n\nMark Waters' MEAN GIRLS (US)\n\nMusic Box Theatre ‚Äì Thursday, 9:45pm\n\nSet just a short drive away in nearby Evanston, the highly quotable MEAN GIRLS is a satirical look at the awkward, cliquish, hormone-crazed minefield that is high school. Sixteen-year-old fish out of water Cady Heron (Lindsey Lohan) moves to Illinois after spending the previous 12 years in Africa with her parents, who were on a zoological research study. Upon her arrival, she enrolls at North Shore High School and quickly learns that making new friends is nothing like it was halfway across the world. During her first math class, taught by the affable but down on her luck Ms. Norbury (Tina Fey), Cady makes friends with social outcasts Janis (Lizzy Caplan) and Damien (Daniel Franzese), who teach her about navigating the school's social hierarchy. At lunch, Cady is approached by The Plastics to join their group. Consisting of queen bee Regina George (Rachel McAdams), Gretchen Wieners (Lacey Chabert), and Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried), The Plastics are North Shore's equivalent of teen royalty and have very strict rules on how to dress and act. As Cady becomes friendlier with them, Janis and Damien fear she will become one of them. They decide to have her pretend to join the group as a joke and destroy them from within as revenge for all the victimizing they have done. As time progresses, Cady slowly goes from pretending to be Plastic to actually becoming Plastic and risks losing her only true friends. The backstabbing intensifies and secrets are revealed, and the whole school is turned upside down. This film is a perfect look at teenage cliques and the damaging effects they can have on everyone, school staff included. A cult classic with a lasting legacy largely thanks to Fey's well-written script, MEAN GIRLS is a painfully accurate representation of how fun and cruel high school can truly be.

I had a lot to learn, but one thing I noticed right away was that I often didn‚Äôt see films the same way the majority of film reviewers saw them‚Äîand that seemed to have something to do with the fact that they were male and I was female. As I grew at my craft, I noticed that I also didn‚Äôt see films the way audiences saw them. This was made clearest to me when I panned the sexism of the 2013 film 1,000 TIMES GOOD NIGHT. Those who had seen it pointed out to me that the story of a female combat photographer couldn‚Äôt be sexist because the director, Erik Poppe, actually had been a combat photographer. This made absolutely no sense to me on its face, but it definitely revealed that the moviegoing public accept without question that a man‚Äôs experience is the default experience of all people. The knowledge that took me years of study and practice to acquire is now available to anyone who watches Influential independent filmmaker and educator Nina Menke‚Äôs BRAINWASHED: SEX-CAMERA-POWER. This documentary seeks to make visible the ‚Äúyou understood‚Äù of filmmaking‚Äîthe male gaze‚Äîthrough film clips and interviews with female and nonbinary scholars, actors, and filmmakers, including the coiner of the term, Laura Mulvey. Menkes shows how a film vocabulary has formed and hardened into accepted practice‚Äîone that even women filmmakers use. This vocabulary includes shooting women in flat, two-dimensional light that contrasts with the three dimensions men are allowed to inhabit (THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI); shooting women as a series of body parts rather than as whole people (LOST IN TRANSLATION); standardizing sexualized images such as butt shots and slow-motion panning down a woman‚Äôs body (DIE ANOTHER DAY); using sound design in which men are recorded having conversations, but women in the same location are seen, but not heard (RAGING BULL); creating scenes in which a man forces a woman to accept his sexual advances, only to have the woman surrender to him happily and willingly (GONE WITH THE WIND). It is Menkes‚Äô contention that these internalized norms of film construction influence how men and women behave in the real world. If women cannot be heard in a film, it‚Äôs only a short leap to silencing them in workplaces, public spaces, and relationships. If women are sexualized and give in to men‚Äôs sexual demands with pleasure in the movies no matter the circumstances, then sexually harassing and raping them in real life won‚Äôt seem so wrong. It is a fact that movies are more than mere entertainment. Men at the top of the male-dominated filmmaking food chain are trying to protect their financial interests by giving the public what they have been trained to want, but they are protecting so much more. They are protecting their right to behave however they wish toward the people they consider their inferiors. It will not be easy, but through the education that BRAINWASHED provides, we can change the conversation and make room for the voices these gatekeepers wish to silence.

(2022, 107 min, DCP Digital) [Marilyn Ferdinand]\n\nFrederick Wiseman‚Äôs A COUPLE (France/US)\n\nGene Siskel Film Center ‚Äì See Venue website for showtimes\n\nFrederick Wiseman turns to drama for the first time in 20 years, and though this hourlong portrait of Sophia Tolstoy, long-suffering wife of Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy, is destined to become a footnote in Wiseman‚Äôs brilliant career, it provides some interesting perspectives on his larger body of work. His lengthy documentaries are revered for their intensive studies of institutions and systems, and of people messily interacting; restricted here to French actor Nathalie Boutefeu in a variety of forest settings as she delivers a bitter monologue to her absent husband, Wiseman directs his penetrating gaze to the natural systems around her (boldly colorful flowers, rich spring foliage, epic cobwebs, mossy ponds). ‚ÄúYour power crushed my life and my personality as well,‚Äù Sophia tells the tyrannical Leo, and there‚Äôs a certain logic to Tolstoy, a writer of such metaphysical ambition, being played here by nature itself. Drawn from Sophia‚Äôs diaries, the monologue dissects the Tolstoys‚Äô troubled marriage and family life, which centered Leo‚Äôs genius to the cruel detriment of his wife and children. Near the movie‚Äôs midpoint, Sophia gets so worked up about a fight with her husband that she grapples with a dead tree, snapping off branches; unfortunately, the tree doesn‚Äôt fight back, and in the film‚Äôs latter half, as Sophia begins to circle back on her discontents, Wiseman‚Äôs naturalistic conceit bears less fruit (so to speak). (2022, 63 min, DCP Digital) [J.R. Jones]\n\nJoanna Hogg‚Äôs THE ETERNAL DAUGHTER (US/UK)\n\nGene Siskel Film Center ‚Äì See Venue website for showtimes\n\nJoanna Hogg has described her latest film as being like a short story, and that feels appropriate. It comes after THE SOUVENIR (2019) and THE SOUVENIR: PART II (2021), which together comprise a miniature epic vis-√†-vis an autobiographical coming-of-age narrative, so it follows that this abstract continuation of those stories is slighter. Slighter, but no less consequential; indeed, what the previous films conveyed about the beginning of a life lived is magnified in this haunting epode about the ending of one, and how those left behind must cope. Tilda Swinton (who also featured in the SOUVENIR films as the protagonist's mother, Rosalind) plays Julie, ostensibly a middle-aged version of the character from the preceding films played by her real-life daughter, Honor Swinton Byrne. She also again plays Rosalind; the dual role was a bit jarring at first, but Hogg handles the conceit subtly, avoiding the shortfalls of gimmickry. (This is something that only artists like Hogg and Swinton can accomplish, with a stature of integrity and seriousness that would make their doing a stand-up comedy special a legitimate artistic endeavor.) The beginning of the film finds Julie and Rosalind traveling to a palatial hotel in the English countryside in celebration of the latter‚Äôs upcoming birthday; settled into their rooms (with little help from a sardonic receptionist played by Carly-Sophia Davies, who also appears as the waitress in the hotel restaurant where mother and daughter appear to alway be the only customers), it soon becomes apparent that Julie, still a filmmaker as in the earlier films, is also there on a working holiday, starting to plan a film about herself and her mother. In tandem with Rosalind‚Äôs eventual revelations about her childhood experiences at the estate‚Äîthe building had once been in her family, where her aunt took in relatives‚Äô children to shelter them from the bombings in London during World War II‚ÄîJulie begins to hear strange noises and see strange things. The film soon turns into a rather restrained ghost story, with hints of a larger twist (an overstatement, maybe) that all is not as it seems. In keeping with Hogg‚Äôs preternatural talent and themes prevalent throughout her oeuvre, THE ETERNAL DAUGHTER is less about the hauntings of trauma and grief (as is the trend nowadays) and more about how it‚Äôs that which is not spoken that pervades us. Whether or not ghosts literally linger in the estate, they do so figuratively in the clipped, overly polite conversations between mother and daughter. The silences between conversations contain phantoms of inherent misunderstanding between the women, separated as they are by age and circumstance. The women‚Äôs reticence does not indicate a lack of affection‚Äîif anything, their love is all-consuming, just not fortified by the bond of honest communication. THE SOUVENIR explored a similar theme: can we ever really know another person? Is this a privilege that even the most privileged among us (considering the milieu of the characters in Hoggs‚Äô films) are kept from experiencing? Perhaps it‚Äôs a truism that the only person we can ever really know is ourselves. How, then, do we make heads or tails of the inner lives of those we love? Maybe the ghost in the window isn‚Äôt just the spirit of a person lost, but of the person we never really found. Such considerations are evoked also through Hogg‚Äôs refined sense of pacing and rich visual sensibility, which lend credence to every aspect of her aesthetic, from the cinematography to the sets to the characters‚Äô clothing. In sum, the film is an affecting genre turn as well as another entry in an indelibly auspicious oeuvre.

In a confident first feature, director Martika Ramirez Escobar pays homage to Filipino action films of the 1970s and '80s. Leonor (a revelatory Sheila Francisco) is a former scriptwriter now living with her frustrated son Rudie (Bong Carbera) and unable to pay the bills. She‚Äôs struggling to find meaning in her life, haunted, too, by the death of her other son, Ronwaldo (Anthony Falcon). When she reads an ad requesting script submissions, she returns to work, imagining a new film which focuses on a story about a young hero named Ronwaldo (Rocky Salumbides) and his love, Isabella (Rea Molina). After being struck on the head by a falling television, Leonor falls into a coma and finds herself within her own film, interacting with her characters. Rudie attempts to wake his mother by trying to get her film made while also coming to terms with their difficult relationship; Leonor meanwhile becomes a hero in her own story. The ‚Äúreal world‚Äù and the cinematic world of Leonor‚Äôs action film are distinguished by visual style; grainy film, dated soundtrack, and slow-moving camerawork alert the audience to the action film scenes. But as the film progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult to parse the two. The diegesis of the film is playfully always one step beyond the audience. A scene taking place on a busy sound stage depicts actors recreating a very similar moment from earlier in the film; in another, a television on the street is playing the film that Leonor is imagining. These moments emphasize the blurring between reality and fiction, which culminates in a wild finale that further complicates the film‚Äôs larger themes about the creative process. It‚Äôs all pretty fantastic, including moments when Leonor is repeating her own lines in perfect sync with her characters and when the sound of a typewriter dictates a dance break for the fictional Ronwaldo. As fictional and real melodramas mesh and become intertwined with one another, Leonor‚Äôs living script reflects and refracts her own family‚Äôs struggles. Amid the spirited cinematic storytelling, Francisco‚Äôs performance is wholly enchanting; LEONOR WILL NEVER DIE‚Äôs experimental construction and themes work so well only because it's amazing to watch her navigate these varied filmic spaces. (2022, 99 min, DCP Digital) [Megan Fariello]\n\nNoah Baumbach‚Äôs WHITE NOISE (US)\n\nMusic Box Theatre ‚Äì See Venue website for showtimes\n\nStories about families, love, death, and the pursuit of meaning are nothing new, but in the 1980s, they were subjected to postmodern scrutiny, especially in literature. Don DeLillo‚Äôs 1985 novel White Noise became and remains a sensation for its examination of all of the aforementioned subjects through the lenses of America‚Äôs rash of blended families, hyperconsumerism, religious chaos, and pop cultural studies then invading academia. Over the years, there have been thoughts of turning the book into a movie, but they were all abandoned. Noah Baumbach, a long-time fan of White Noise, has finally broken through and adapted a book that seems particularly suited to his artistic concerns. What has emerged is another of his examinations of families under stress‚Äîin this case, a mandatory evacuation, drug abuse, and an extreme fear of death‚Äîwrapped in the fetchingly bright colors of name-brand supermarket items. Adam Driver and Greta Gerwig play Jack and Babette ‚ÄúBaba‚Äù Gladney, each trying love and marriage for a fourth time. They live in an Ohio college town with their four children, three from previous unions and one of their own. In general, Jack and Baba are blithely oblivious parents, forcing their oldest children, Denise (Raffey Cassidy) and Heinrich (Sam Nivola), to take on much of the caretaking and thinking for the family. Jack teaches Hitler Studies at the College-On-The-Hill, where the film opens. We see Jack‚Äôs friend and colleague, Murray Siskind (Don Cheadle), showing clips of Hollywood car crashes to his class and instructing them that these seeming disasters are actually quite uplifting, happy sequences because they provide us with harmless excitement and spectacle‚Äîa perfect description of the types of entertainment that flourished in the ‚Äô80s. Still, Murray wishes to be considered an expert in the way Jack is about Hitler and chooses Elvis Presley as his ticket to professional renown. The scene in which he and Jack tag team a lecture about Elvis and Hitler to a growing crowd of students and faculty emphasizes the kind of celebrity worship that exploded as a secular religion during the ‚Äô80s. A collision between a tank truck and train, far from being a happy event, ignites in a huge fireball that creates an ‚Äúairborne toxic event‚Äù that forces the town‚Äôs evacuation, an experience fraught with horrors. Once the danger has passed some 10 days later, Jack and Baba must confront her use of an experimental drug that is designed to take away her fear of death and the ‚Äúindiscretion‚Äù that enabled her to access it. A final reckoning takes place in a seedy motel with a man (Lars Eidinger) Jack has seen before‚Äîperhaps the avatar of death Jack himself fears beyond reason‚Äîbefore some kind of equilibrium can be restored. In a film premised on the perceived depth of the shallow, Baumbach provides plenty of visual bread and circuses, from the endless line of evacuating cars to the endless rows of grocery shelves‚Äîeven dancing in the aisles in a well-choreographed closing-credit sequence. He tips his hat to Robert Altman‚Äôs overlapping dialogue in our first meeting with the Gladneys, though the chaos of their chatter at the beginning of the film, unlike the calmer exchanges at its end, is impossible to understand. Rapidly updated information on the toxic cloud is reminiscent of the ever-changing directives surrounding the novel coronavirus, and the cloud itself reminded me of the snaking plague sent from the sky to kill Egypt‚Äôs firstborn in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS (1956; when it obscures a Shell sign as Jack gasses up the family station wagon, it certainly feels like the shadow of death falling across him and his consumerist world. I enjoyed many of the performances, particularly the didactic earnestness of Cheadle and Barbara Sukowa as a nun whose declaration in German that she does not believe in God is like a savage slap in the face in a film meant to skim the surface. And that superficiality kept the film from complete success for me. I wish I had believed that Jack and Babette were as afraid of death as they claimed to be. A long scene in which the couple is finally straight with each other plays like a serious scene in an archly written Neil Simon comedy. This film held my attention and showed expert craftsmanship, but could have benefited from something like the anarchic Jewish humor of the Marx Brothers to highlight the absurdity of the plastic world DeLillo created. (2022, 129 min, DCP Digital) [Marilyn Ferdinand]\n\nCharlotte Wells‚Äô AFTERSUN (UK/US)\n\nMusic Box Theatre ‚Äì See Venue website for showtimes\n\nThere‚Äôs something about the quality of DV home-movie footage that feels particularly, singularly fragile. Maybe it‚Äôs the tendency of the image to pixelate at relatively slight movements, or the fact that the format now exists in hindsight as a consumer video relic that experienced only the briefest of heydays before being usurped by HD and smartphones. Whatever the case, writer-director Charlotte Wells employs DV to poignant effect in her debut feature. The film opens in the low-resolution format, presented as video taken by 11-year-old Sophie (Frankie Corio) of her father Calum (Paul Mescal). The pair, whom we soon learn are sharing a motel room near a resort in Turkey, are spending one last summer vacation together before Sophie heads back to live with her divorced mother in Scotland. Wells will return to the girl‚Äôs video diaries throughout, although it takes one a while to situate them in time: are they sweet documents of the present or fragmented representations of the past? What‚Äôs the difference? Such temporal indeterminacy gradually reveals itself to be central to the meaning and effects of the film, which regards memory as always a hazy refraction of the then, now, and never-quite-was, an equation that, as it so happens, finds expression in the ontology of moving images. Not unlike the work of Wells‚Äôs compatriot Lynne Ramsay, AFTERSUN comes at its characters and events from oblique angles that delay or preclude our apprehension. In visual terms, this sometimes manifests as a darkness in which figures are barely or fleetingly perceptible; at other moments, Wells composes shots using various reflective surfaces, such as when we see Sophie‚Äôs live video playing on a tube television in front of a mirror, the source of the action never glimpsed directly, just as Calum‚Äôs unspoken inner turmoil remains elusive to Sophie. Based on Wells‚Äô relationship with her own father, who passed away when she was an adolescent, AFTERSUN both diegetically depicts the splintered, wistful process of remembrance and evokes it through a nonlinear, diaphanous formal construction. During the climax, an outsize emotional crescendo set to ‚ÄúUnder Pressure,‚Äù the film snaps into focus as a kind of spiritual bridge from daughter to father, through which their ‚Äúlast dance‚Äù leaves a perpetually echoing afterimage.
