        "text": "The Hollywood's writers and actors on strike will soon start affecting tv shows and even movies. With no signs of an end date any time soon, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) are concurrently striking for the first time in over 60 years. The writer’s strike began at the start of May, with the actors guild joining just last week.\n\nBoth unions share the same reasons for striking. This includes getting paid a living wage to meet basic needs, receiving higher residuals (financial compensation paid out to actors whenever TV shows or movies they’ve appeared in are replayed on streaming and syndication), and the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to be regulated to protect talent and writers’ jobs from being completely taken over. Some big-time actors have joined the picket lines, including Rachel McAdams, Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick, Rosario Dawson, Hilary Duff, and more.\n\nFilms have been an inspiration in our lives, with some of the most impactful ones being the most visually stunning to watch. For a few hours, you are transported to a completely different world through the use of set design, camerawork, color palettes, and costumes. Storytelling is what can make or break an aesthetically pleasing film, but with all of these factors working in perfect harmony, we can see the directors’ visions come to life. See below our top five picks of the most visually stunning films to watch."
