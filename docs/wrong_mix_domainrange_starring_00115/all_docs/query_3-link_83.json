The series comes from Mattson Tomlin, who’s best known for writing or co-writing ‘Project Power’, the underrated ‘Little Fish’ and ‘The Batman’. Production I.G, the Japanese anime studio behind such titles as ‘Ghost in the Shell’ are also be involved. The supporting cast includes includes Rosario Dawson, Emmy winner Ann Dowd, Sonoya Mizuno (‘House of the Dragon’) and André Holland (‘Moonlight’) \n.\n.\nThe series is set in two time periods. In 2022, a future war has raged for decades between the few human survivors and an endless army of machines. In 1997, the AI known as Skynet gained self-awareness and began its war against humanity. Caught between the future and this past is a soldier sent back in time to change the fate of humanity. She arrives in 1997 to protect a scientist named Malcolm Lee who works to launch a new AI system designed to compete with Skynet’s impending attack on humanity. As Malcolm navigates the moral complexities of his creation, he is hunted by an unrelenting assassin from the future which forever alters the fate of his three children.\n.\n.\n#ahsoka#timothyolyphant#onceuponatimeinhollywood#jamescameron#hereditary#terminator#theterminator#ghostintheshell#megaman#thebatman#houseofthedragon#lalaland#terminator2judgmentday#terminator2#gonein60seconds#terminatordarkfate#scream2#exmachin#justified#daisyjonesandthesix#deadwood#thebookofbobafett#fargo#santaclaritadiet#hegotgame#clerks#theexorcist#zombieland#thehandmaidstale#bonesandall\".",
