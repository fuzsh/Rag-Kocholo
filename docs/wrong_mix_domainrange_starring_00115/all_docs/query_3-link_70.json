        "text": "1\n\nLeo Woodall and Meghann Fahy\n\nThere’s been plenty of rumours of romances sizzling throughout plenty of the White Lotus season two cast — but it’s taken a year for just one of those rumours to have proven true. British actor Leo Woodall, who played the charmingly mysterious Jack, and Meghann Fahy, who played divisive housewife Daphne, confirmed relationship rumours on November 21, 2023, when they were snapped holding hands and kissing on an outing in New York City. The confirmation follows a few sneakily suspicious Instagram posts, and Fahy’s cheeky denial of the rumours.\n\n2\n\nKristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson\n\nAfter meeting on the set of the first Twilight film as protagonist lovers Bella and Edward, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson first started dating in 2009. After four years of on-again, off-again dating — and a year after Stewart was accused of having an affair with Snow White and the Huntsman director Rupert Sanders — the pair broke up.\n\n3\n\nAlexis Bledel and Jared Padalecki\n\nWhile on the set of Gilmore Girls, Alexis Bledel — AKA Rory Gilmore — fell for a few of her co-stars. Her most public romance was with Milo Ventimiglia, who played Jess, but the bigger secret was Bledel’s fling with Jared Padalecki, who played Dean. In 2021, Padalecki finally confirmed the long-swirling rumours of their romance, saying that the relationship “wasn’t anything super juicy” and more a matter of circumstance during the first season.\n\n5\n\nBlake Lively and Penn Badgley\n\nLike their on-again, off-again characters on Gossip Girl, Blake Lively (Serena van der Woodsen) and Penn Badgley (Dan Humphreys) dated in real life. They kept things pretty hush-hush when they started dating in 2007, and called it quits in 2010 — managing to hide their split even from the Gossip Girl crew to avoid any personal drama affecting the show. Lively attributes their break-up to wanting to differentiate themselves from the characters they played on-screen.\n\n6\n\nEmma Stone and Andrew Garfield\n\nBefore there was Zendaya and Tom Holland, the previous on-screen Spiderman couple was also an item off-screen. Having met on the set of The Amazing Spider-Man, Andrew Garfield (Peter Parker) and Emma Stone (Gwen Stacy) started dating in 2011. In 2015, their split was confirmed after rumours that long-distance combined with their busy schedules as in-demand actors was too difficult to maintain. Stone went on to marry and welcome her first child with SNL writer Dave McCary, but she and Garfield are still friends. Garfield even revealed that she texted him to ask about his much-anticipated appearance in Spider-Man: No Way Home, and jokingly called him a “jerk” after he was forced to lie about it.\n\n7\n\nMatthew Broderick and Jennifer Grey\n\nThough they played siblings who hated each other in Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, Matthew Broderick and Jennifer Grey secretly dated during filming. They temporarily parted ways after the shoot ended, but resumed their relationship soon after. Their relationship remained a secret until 1987, when they were involved in a tragic car crash in Ireland — when Broderick, while driving, hit a vehicle containing two local women, who both died in the crash. They were briefly engaged in 1988, but broke up soon after.\n\n8\n\nAna de Armas and Ben Affleck\n\nDeep Water may have only been released in 2022, but its leads — Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas — were cast way back in 2019, with filming taking place in 2020. Affleck and de Armas’ on-screen romance led to a blossoming romance off-screen too, and the couple were together until January 2021 when they amicably parted ways. Affleck went on to rekindle things — and ultimately marry — J.Lo, while de Armas went on to flourish in Blonde, revealing that the media attention that had surrounded their relationship was “horrible”.\n\n9\n\nDiane Keaton and Al Pacino\n\nRenowned actors Diane Keaton and Al Pacino were cast opposite each other in The Godfather, which went on to catapult them both into fame after its 1972 release — but it also sparked the beginning of a romance. It wasn’t until after the sequel that their slow burn relationship began, but Keaton has since revealed that when Pacino couldn’t commit to a marriage ultimatum, they parted ways after The Godfather Part III. The pair continue to hold admiration for each other, with Pacino’s 2017 tribute to Keaton for her AFI Lifetime Achievement Award ending with him telling her, and the audience, “I love you forever”.\n\n10\n\nZac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens\n\nThey were the teen couple of the noughties that everybody was obsessed with: After being cast opposite each other as Troy and Gabriella in High School Musical in 2005, Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens became the It couple of the moment. They confirmed their relationship in 2007, but went on to keep things fairly private. After more than four years together, they called it off in 2010, saying that they would remain friends. “We grew up together. It was nice to have someone to share all of those experiences with,” Hudgens said after their break-up. 15 years after they first met, in 2022, both Hudgens and Efron posted photos in front of the school where HSM was filmed — sparking rumours of a reunion that could see the old flames reunited.\n\n11\n\nElizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton\n\nWhen they first met on the set of Cleopatra, Elizabeth Taylor was still married to Eddie Fisher, her fourth husband, and Richard Burton was married to Sybil Williams. And yet, a forbidden romance bloomed between the two leads, budding into an affair that dazzled the world with its scandal and extravagance. The couple would recklessly spend their wealths on jewels and art, viciously argue in private and public, and married only a year after their meeting in 1964. They filed for divorce 10 years later, but were married briefly again in 1975 before calling it quits officially less than a year later. “I don’t want to be that much in love ever again,” Taylor reportedly told a friend. “I gave everything away…my soul, my being, everything.”\n\n12\n\nJohnny Depp and Winona Ryder\n\nJohnny Depp and Winona Ryder were one of the most adored couples of the ’90s. Their relationship began shortly before they starred together as love interests in Edward Scissorhands (1990) — Depp called it “love at first sight” when they locked eyes at a film premiere in 1989 and within five months of courtship, the young couple were already engaged. After four years together, the couple called off their engagement in 1993, but Ryder went on to say of their time together, “I had my first real relationship with Johnny, a fiercely deep love that I don’t know that I’ll ever [have again].”\n\n13\n\nAudrey Hepburn and William Holden\n\nPerhaps one of Audrey Hepburn’s most adored films is Sabrina — and in addition to landing herself an Academy Award nomination, Hepburn also landed herself in a love affair with co-star William Holden (while she was married to Mel Ferrer). Holden was 11 years her senior, married, and a father of three — and yet a passionate affair ensued. Allegedly, Holden went so far as promising to leave his wife and children to marry Hepburn — but when she discovered that he’d had a vasectomy, she ended their relationship, as she was desperate to have children. They famously were forced to reunite in 1962, on the set of Paris When It Sizzles.\n\n14\n\nAngelina Jolie and Jenny Shimizu\n\nBefore Brangelina, there was Jenny and Angelina. Having met on the set of 1996 film Foxfire, model Jenny Shimizu and Hollywood darling Angelina Jolie embarked on a brief but passionate romance. Jolie says she “fell in love with [Shimizu] the first second she saw her”, and that if she hadn’t married Jonny Lee Miller in 1996, she “probably would have married” Shimizu.\n\n15\n\nZendaya and Jacob Elordi\n\nThey may not have played lovers on-screen, but a short-lived romance blossomed between Zendaya and Jacob Elordi on the set of Euphoria. Their relationship started out platonic — in 2020, Zendaya called Elordi her “best friend” in a speech — but later that year, they were papped getting cosy together in New York City. While they never confirmed a romance, things didn’t last particularly long, with Elordi being linked to Kaia Gerber in September 2020 and Zendaya’s long-rumoured relationship with Spider-Man co-star Tom Holland being confirmed in July 2021.\n\n16\n\nRyan Gosling and Rachel McAdams\n\nOn the set of what is widely considered to be one of the most romantic films of all time — The Notebook — co-stars Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams reportedly did not get along well at all, despite their on-screen chemistry. Their director, Nick Cassavetes, even revealed they had “constant screaming matches” on set. But two years on, the pair ran into each other again, and realised they had feelings for each other. They dated from 2005 to 2007, parting ways due to their booming careers. Gosling told GQ, “when both people are in show business, it’s too much show business. It takes all of the light, so nothing else can grow.”\n\n17\n\nHelen Mirren and Liam Neeson\n\nWhile their relationship was never a secret, it’s likely you’ve never heard of Helen Mirren and Liam Neeson’s four-year relationship until now. The pair met on the set of Excalibur in the ’80s, which was Neeson’s first film role. When he saw her on-set in costume for the first time, he said, ‘Oh f—”, he recalled in 2018 alongside Mirren on the Graham Norton Show. “I was smitten,” he added. Being seven years Neeson’s senior, Mirren took the young actor under her wing, encouraging him to move to London and get an agent. “We didn’t date, we lived together for four years – we were a serious item for a while,” said Mirren on the Graham Norton Show. “Lucky me!” The pair parted ways in 1985, but given their openness in discussing their relationship in recent years, it’s clear that there’s still a lot of admiration and love between them."
