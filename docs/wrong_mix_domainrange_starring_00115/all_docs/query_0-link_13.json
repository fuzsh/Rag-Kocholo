That’s part of what I’ve loved about ‘Godzilla Vs Kong’ and this, that they’ve felt more like ‘Skull Island’ sequels due to how Kong heavy they are, which makes me happy as I’m more of a Kong guy. In very surprising fashion, a lot of the film was from Kong and Godzilla’s POV, which made me happy as that’s what I want from these and it was almost my favorite aspect of the others, which often relegated them to the side for some more human storylines. The sequel sees Kong encounter more of his species in the Hollow Earth and must unite with Godzilla to stop their tyrannical leader and a powerful, climate-changing Titan from destroying the surface. With one big budget film under his belt, Adam Wingard felt more comfortable this time around and delivers another crowd pleasing film with this one having the most action out of the entire MonsterVerse. \n.\n.\nIt’s non stop action scenes coming at us left and right throughout the film with excellent special effects, while the last 40 minutes in Hollow Earth being everything we’ve wanted and deserving of the best big screen experience possible. Seeing Godzilla x Kong team up lives up to the hype, as it’s such a bad ass moment. I loved Suko aka Baby Kong, he was a mischievous delight and simply adorable. The soundtrack was excellent, as Wingard picked the perfect needle drop for certain scenes. It was very old school rock heavy, which reminded me of the blockbusters of the late 90’s/early 2000’s. Rebecca Hall gets a more interesting angle as Dr. Ilene Andrews caring for her daughter, and keeping things grounded with the human elements. Kaylee Hottle as Andrews’ adoptive deaf daughter Jia is even better this time around and is once again the heart of the film as her emotional bond with Kong really hits. \n.\nCONTINUED IN THE COMMENTS\".",
