        "text": "Since I've been fully vaccinated, I've been heading back to the movies, and I gotta say, it's been pretty great. Before COVID, I was at the movies at least once a week, and usually more often than that. I desperately missed sitting in a dark theater with a huge screen and surround sound that just envelops you into the story unfolding on screen.\n\nSo I've been easing my way back into my old ways, and as I was figuring out my moviegoing schedule this week, I noticed a new release that I had almost forgotten about - and I'm not sure how I did, because I was pretty excited for it. It's a movie called Those Who Wish Me Dead, an action thriller starring Angelina Jolie and written and directed by Taylor Sheridan, who some may probably know as the creator of the hit TV series Yellowstone.\n\nPeople in Missoula are probably already familiar with Yellowstone even if they don't watch the show, considering it filmed its entire fourth season around here, Hamilton, and Darby (and it's looking like they'll be back to film season five). So Sheridan's got a little bit of a Montana connection there - and it turns out, this new movie also takes place in Montana. IMDB's plot synopsis describes a young boy being chased by assassins in the Montana wilderness while a forest fire rages around them. (Although according to Wikipedia, even though the movie takes place in Montana, it was actually shot in New Mexico.)\n\nI think it sounds pretty cool - I haven't watched Yellowstone, but I'm a fan of other movies that Sheridan has been involved in like Sicario, Hell or High Water, and Wind River. And if you don't feel like heading out to the theater to see it this weekend, good news - it'll also be available for 30 days on HBO MAX."
