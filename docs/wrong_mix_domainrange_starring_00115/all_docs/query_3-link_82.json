        "text": "Sonic Sea\n\nDirectors: Michelle Dougherty, Daniel Hinerfeld\n\nSonic Sea is a 60-minute documentary about the devastating impact of industrial and military ocean noise on whales and other marine life. The film begins with a mystery: the unexplained stranding and mass mortality of several species of whales in the Bahamas in March 2000. As the mystery unfolds, the film explores the critical role of sound in the sea, and the sudden, dramatic changes human activity is inflicting on the ocean’s delicate acoustic habitat — changes that threaten the ability of whales and other marine animals to prosper, to function, and ultimately, to survive\n\nPangolin\n\nDirector: Katie Schuler\n\nJourney of a single pangolin, from the moment it is taken from the wild to its final destination in China. Filmed on location across three countries with the help of reformed poachers and wildlife enforcement officers, the film acts as a surrogate for an estimated hundred thousand pangolins that are poached and smuggled annually in SE Asia and Africa. Pangolin offers audiences the opportunity to experience the life, death and afterlife of one of the most illeally trafficked and endangered mammals on the planet.\n\nMonarchs: The Milkweed Mission\n\nDirector: Turk Pipkin\n\nThe latest conservation film from director Turk Pipkin and The Nobelity Project, The Milkweed Mission tracks the amazing year-long path of North America’s main Monarch butterfly migration, documenting threats from logging and community conservation challenges in the winter reserves in Michoacán, Mexico to loss of essential pollinators and milkweeds due to droughts, climate change and chemical agriculture across the U.S. and into the northern migration range in Canada.\n\nThis event is sponsored by the Athena Cinema and Alden Library.\n\nShowtimes: ONE NIGHT ONLY: Wednesday, February 22nd at 7:00PM. Free admission!\n\nContinue Reading →\n\nShare this Film\n\nLandfill Harmonic follows the Recycled Orchestra of Cateura, a Paraguayan musical group that plays instruments made entirely out of garbage. When their story goes viral, the orchestra is catapulted into the global spotlight. Under the guidance of idealistic music director Favio Chavez, the orchestra must navigate a strange new world of arenas and sold-out concerts. However, when a natural disaster strikes their community, Favio must find a way to keep the orchestra intact and provide a source of hope for their town. The film is a testimony to the transformative power of music and the resilience of the human spirit.\n\n“An inspiring tale — if it were fiction you’d dismiss it as unbelievable ” – Ken Jaworowski, The New York Times\n\nShare this Film\n\nThrough the stories of workers and entrepreneurs in the U.S. and China, the film captures the global race to lead the clean energy future. Over the course of a solar jobs training program, the film follows the hope and heartbreak of unemployed American workers seeking jobs in the solar industry. With countries like China investing in innovative technologies and capitalizing on this trillion-dollar opportunity, the film tells the story of the global energy transition from the perspective of workers and entrepreneurs building solutions to income inequality and climate change with their own hands. Their successes and failures speak to one of the biggest questions of our time: will the U.S. actually be able to build a clean energy economy?\n\n“A must-see film. An eye-opening look at workers and entrepreneurs on the forefront of the clean energy movement that will transform, and enliven the way you see the future. What is clear is the wonderful opportunity the transition to clean energy represents.” – Actor, Mark Ruffalo\n\nShare this Film\n\nAt a popular bakery café, residents of New York’s Upper East Side get bagels and coffee served with a smile 24 hours a day. But behind the scenes, undocumented immigrant workers face sub-legal wages, dangerous machinery, and abusive managers who will fire them for calling in sick. Mild-mannered sandwich maker Mahoma López has never been interested in politics, but in January 2012, he convinces a small group of his co-workers to fight back.\n\nRisking deportation and the loss of their livelihood, the workers team up with a diverse crew of innovative young organizers and take the unusual step of forming their own independent union, launching themselves on a journey that will test the limits of their resolve. In one roller-coaster year, they must overcome a shocking betrayal and a two-month lockout. Lawyers will battle in back rooms, Occupy Wall Street protesters will take over the restaurant, and a picket line will divide the neighborhood. If they can win a contract, it will set a historic precedent for low-wage workers across the country. But whatever happens, Mahoma and his coworkers will never be exploited again.\n\n“A crowd pleaser… a captivating David & Goliath story.” Anthony Kaufman, Indiewire\n\nShare this Film\n\n*CaptiView® Closed Caption & Audio Description devices are available for this film. All showings on Mondays will feature Open Captions.*\n\nOne afternoon during the summer of 1989, two young lawyers named Michelle Robinson and Barack Obama go on their first date in the South Side of Chicago.\n\n“Southside with You is a sweet, intelligent, well-crafted, wonderfully romantic, no-frills re-imagination of the first date between Barack Obama and Michelle Robinson, when both were young stars on the rise but neither possibly could have imagined they’d one day take up residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue for eight years.”- Richard Roeper, Chicago Sun-Times\n\n“Tanne’s impressive accomplishment rests in not having been intimidated by his protagonists’ stature, thereby opening the door for him to create a living and breathing picture of two people spending a few hours together, offering select details about their lives and personalities, probing, questioning, pushing things a bit on his side and her pushing back on the other.” -Todd McCarthy, The Hollywood Reporter\n\n“Richard Tanne’s writing-directing debut deepens into a pointed, flowing conversation about the many challenges (and varieties) of African-American identity, the need for both idealism and compromise, and the importance of making peace with past disappointments in order to effect meaningful change in the future.”- Justin Chang, Variety\n\nShare this Film\n\nIn Manchester by the Sea, the latest film from award-winning writer and director Kenneth Lonergan, the life of a solitary Boston janitor is transformed when he returns to his hometown to take care of his teenage nephew. The story of the Chandlers, a working-class family living in a Massachusetts fishing village for generations, Manchester by the Sea is a deeply poignant, unexpectedly funny exploration of the power of familial love, community, sacrifice and hope. After the death of his older brother Joe (Kyle Chandler), Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) is shocked to learn that Joe has made him sole guardian of his nephew Patrick (Lucas Hedges). Taking leave of his job, Lee reluctantly returns to Manchester-by-the-Sea to care for Patrick, a spirited 16-year-old, and is forced to deal with a past that separated him from his wife Randi (Michelle Williams) and the community where he was born and raised. Bonded by the man who held their family together, Lee and Patrick struggle to adjust to a world without him. In his first film since 2011’s acclaimed Margaret, Lonergan once again proves himself a powerful and visionary storyteller as he seamlessly weaves past and present together, crafting a tension-filled tale that deftly eschews sentimentality in favor of penetrating emotional insight and deeply affecting human relationships.\n\n“A beautifully textured, richly enveloping drama about how a death in the family forces a small-town New Englander to confront a past tragedy anew.” – Justin Chang, Variety\n\nShare this Film"
