        "text": "As we all know, the acting profession is one of supreme unpredictability and pressure. For some, the fame becomes too much and their career spirals out of control. Fortunately, there are a handful of extremely talented actors who have managed to claw their way out of whatever rut they were in, and produce a successful comeback story. Whether it was the teen-transition, overcoming drugs, or simply finally avoiding awful film roles like the plague, this is the list of the top ten most successful acting comebacks in recent years.\n\n10. Eddie Murphy\n\nEddie Murphy is an actor who tends to go for the safe, obviously comedic roles. However, in 2006, he played James ‘Thunder’ Early in Dreamgirls (2006), and was a potential turning point in his career. For once, his performance wasn’t satirical or attention seeking or character wasn’t functional for comedy. Instead, there was a depth to his performance, seeing him as a man thirsty for power yet broken inside. However, his comeback was soon over by playing cheap and vulgar characters, which were not funny despite his intention. Think of Norbit (2007) and Imagine That (2009), quickly putting his comeback down the plug-hole. However, for that one moment in 2006, Murphy’s comeback was strong.\n\n9. Johnny Depp – Pirates\n\nNot that this was Johnny Depp’s comeback, per se, but rather this defined Johnny Depp as a box office, bankable, leading man – a title he seemed to resent for many years prior. Depp always looked to hide away from the spotlight, appearing in a huge variety and iconic lot of movie roles, from the kooky Ed Wood to the handsome, sexy Roux in Chocolat (2000). But in 2003, Depp stepped off a sinking boat and into our hearts as the charming, arrogant and hilarious Captain Jack Sparrow. From this point on, his face and name is recognised by mainstream moviegoers everywhere, providing Depp with a (possibly unwanted!) comeback as a leading man in box office movie hits.\n\n8. Winona Ryder\n\nWinona Ryder was one of the most promising actresses of her generation. From a young age, she was able to capture an audience’s heart. Edward Scissorhands (1990) comes to mind as her first big breakout role, in which she portrayed a naïve yet mature young woman, falling in love with a man with scissors as hands. It was in the early 2000s however when she started receiving some bad press, having been accused of stealing from a large department store. She faded from starring film roles, until Black Swan (2010). Although not playing the lead lady, Ryder was able to gain some valuable screen time playing a dark, twisted and almost insane character, a character she plays well. A glass of wine in one hand and running mascara on her face complimented her distraught embodiment of Beth Macintyre. A comeback for sure, but we’re ready for more!\n\n7. Mickey Rourke\n\nIn 1991, Mickey Rourke was ready to throw in the towel in his acting career. He officially quit acting, and decided to pursue a career in boxing. It’s ironic really that the film that marked his return to acting was The Wrestler (2008). In the film, Randy ‘The Ram’ Robinson experiences a host of emotional, mental and physical strain, desperate to seek forgiveness for his daughter and to find a life outside the wrestling ring. Possibly why Rourke’s performance is so intense and honest is the fact that he too experienced very similar emotions, pulling out an Oscar-nominated performance and definitely highlighting his comeback to the silver screen.\n\n6. Neil Patrick Harris\n\nAnyone remember how cute Neil Patrick Harris was as Dr. Doogie Howser? Now, that feels like ancient history! After Doogie Howser MD was cancelled after four seasons, Harris took a long break from stand out television and film roles. Harris stepped into the limelight for the Harold and Kumar films, but that didn’t note his huge return as a great actor. Finally, he found his two feet in the hit television series How I Met Your Mother. Not only has this propelled him to the forefront of Hollywood television actors, he has also made a name for himself on Broadway, even appearing in Glee. A comeback indeed for Harris, now having three Emmys under his belt, he is definitely here to stay!\n\n5. Jason Bateman\n\nJason Bateman failed to secure his place as a successful actor for years, until he gained his place on the hit television show Arrested Development. His hilarious, over protective father role is stereotypical (such as his firm dislike and disapproval for his son’s girlfriend Ann) yet there is something about his performance that makes it appear genuine and relatable. Not only this, but Bateman is a subtly brilliant and humble actor, accepting a wide range of supporting roles which really show off his versatile performance skills. From Juno (2007) to Horrible Bosses (2011), Bateman has produced a comeback worthy of recognition.\n\n4. Drew Barrymore\n\nDrew Barrymore was one of the cutest child stars of her era, appearing as the little sweetheart Gertie in E.T The Extra Terrestrial (1982). However, after a battle with drug and substance abuse in her teenage years, Barrymore hit back hard and strong in her comeback of the mid-late 90s. She played up her cute-sie looks, and starred in some of the most notable rom-coms of the era, such as The Wedding Singer (1998), Ever After (1998), Never Been Kissed (1999), all of which were large successes. Barrymore isn’t only a one trick pony, however, and began her comeback with a minor role in Scream (1996), despite dying right at the beginning by some serious slashing! This proved that she wasn’t afraid to go for the alternative roles and was still serious about being a versatile actress.\n\n3. John Travolta\n\nAfter Travolta’s breakout success with Saturday Night Fever (1977) and Grease (1978), he was in a string of film flops that put him behind the radar for a number of years. Anyone remember any of the films he did in the 80s? No, I don’t think so! However, in 1994, he starred in Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction (1994), and received critical acclaim for his performance. His performance was almost satirical – think of the scene when he danced with Uma Thurman? I’m sure there were a few jazz hands in there, subtly mocking his musical theatre background. A great comeback indeed.\n\n2. Alec Baldwin\n\nAlec Baldwin was involved in a string of bad family adventure films in the early 2000s, including Thomas and The Magic Railroad (2000) and Dr Seuss’ The Cat in the Hat (2003). The functional, empty characters he played in these films, such as the over-expressive, overly nice Mr. Conductor, contrasted his impressive list of quirky, character parts from his earlier career, such as the kooky and loving husband Adam Maitland in Beetlejuice (1988). What indeed happened to his sparkle? No, he won’t sleep on it, I’m afraid (poor Thomas and The Magic Railroad reference), he had a huge comeback with the help of one very special lady, Tina Fey, in the creation of the hit television show 30 Rock. Baldwin’s main character Jack Donaghy propelled Baldwin’s status, and has definitely found a true comeback with the show.\n\n1. Robert Downey Jr.\n\nWho doesn’t think Robert Downey Jr. is one charming, handsome and burly creature? Gracing our screens with years of movies to his name, Robert Downey Jr. is now one of the most bankable actors in Hollywood. His recent fame and success in the Iron Man and Sherlock Holmes franchises marks his biggest comeback yet. In the early 2000s, Downey Jr. was in turmoil once more after his dangerous drug use. However, spring forward to 2008 with the release of Tropic Thunder (2008) and Iron Man (2008) when his career took a 180 degree turn. These were both box office smash outs, and paved the way for one of the most successful and iconic superhero characters ever. Shoot a few bullets, rustle on some metal and kiss Rachel McAdams! Keep going, Robert Downey Jr. We can’t wait to see more!"
