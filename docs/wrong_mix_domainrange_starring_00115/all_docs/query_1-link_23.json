        "text": "\"Twilight\" is certainly having a resurgence now that the entire saga was released on Netflix. Maybe it's the pandemic, or maybe we never really appreciated these movies before, but many are rediscovering their love for the saga and sharing their thoughts on TIkTok.\n\n\"Twilight\" was released on November 21, 2008. After five movies and 13 years, I think it's safe for me to admit I enjoyed those movies. I read the first two books, I stood in line at midnight to get my copy of \"New Moon,\" I dragged my boyfriend to see \"Eclipse,\" and I even owned an \"Edward\" t-shirt. I know! It's crazy, right? I don't even know how it happened.\n\nIt was 2008, I was 19 and I was going through that whole \"I'm too cool for tween/teen stuff because I am a college student\" phase. So when \"Twilight\" came out I immediately rejected it. Then, I don't know how it happened, but I heard the song, you know which one... THE SONG!\n\nMuse's contribution to the \"Twilight\" soundtrack mesmerized me, and one day I stumbled upon the book and bought it. It was so corny but I couldn't stop reading it! It was basically a teen version of \"True Blood\" which I was very into at the time. I was invested. I finished the book within two days and immediately got the next one. Then I saw the movie and immediately fell in love with Edward!\n\n\"Twilight\" created a phenomenon worldwide and it was hard not to be drawn into it. It had cute guys, vampires, werewolves, a revenge plot and a love triangle, it was clearly targeted to me! Yes there were parts that were just plain dumb like the whole \"sparkly vampire\" thing. There certainly were some questionably creepy elements as well like Jacob imprinting with Bella's daughter and the whole childbirth nearly killing Bella. But yet, there I sat, watching each movie anticipating the next move.\n\nYou kind of had to be there in 2008/2009 to understand. Today, the \"Twilight\" mania feels like forever ago. After ten years it's hard to believe that at one time we all loved a skinny, pale sparkly vampire, we lusted over a barely legal buff teen werewolf and Kristen Stewart was straight. It's also crazy to believe that many of the actors we love today got their start in the \"Twilight\" universe. Sure, \"Twilight\" isn't a cinematic masterpiece, but it sure is a helluva lot of fun to watch. So, are you team Edward or team Jacob? I'm more of a team Charlie gal."
