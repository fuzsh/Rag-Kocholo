Christmas-y Factor: All excellent Christmas films have some sort of bully or bad guy, here perfectly played by Rachel McAdams. The anti-hero with a secret heart of gold. Oh, also the entire story takes place in the family home while everyone is in town celebrating Christmas. There is so much heart in this movie. Actually, I'm gonna take a break and go re-watch it real quick! BRB. \"You have a freak flag.
