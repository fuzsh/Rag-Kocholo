        "text": "'Tis the season for laying on the sofa and scoffing mince pies while watching a festive film, so what better time than now to find out the nation's favourite?\n\nAccording to investigated what films are our Yuletide favourites by looking at Google search data, it turns out Elf is the UK's best-loved Christmas movie.\n\nYep, Elf on its own was searched for TWICE as often as traditional titles, and beat the likes of Home Alone and Love Actually to the top spot.\n\nSurprisingly, traditional Christmas movies including the 1947 film Miracle on 34th Street and Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life didn't even make the top five.\n\nRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer came in at ten, while Edward Scissorhands came seventh and Bruce Willis's Die Hard landed in fourth place.\n\nHere's the list in full...\n\n1. Elf\n\n2. Home Alone\n\n3. Love Actually\n\n4. Die Hard\n\n5. Gremlins\n\n6. It's a Wonderful Life\n\n7. Edward Scissorhands\n\n8. Miracle on 34th Street\n\n9. The Nightmare Before Christmas\n\n10. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\n\nSo, wait, no room for The Muppet Christmas Carol? Bah, humbug."
