        "text": "Do you ever wonder how this generation’s actors and hunks compare to Johnny Depp?\n\nIf your answer is yes, then allow me to compare apples and oranges in celebration of Johnny’s 50th birthday.\n\n1) Johnny Depp vs. Ian Somerhalder\n\nWhat they have in common: Like Ian (Vampire Diaries), Johnny first made a name in show business on TV, via the show 21 Jump Street. They both rock plain white T-shirts and look good with or without facial hair.\n\nWho wins: At age 35, Ian is still just a TV star while Johnny already played lead roles in movies such as Donnie Brasco and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas when he was the same age. If Ian lands the Christian Grey role then he’s headed for a great movie career but as for now, Johnny beats him, handily.\n\n2) Johnny Depp vs. Justin Bieber\n\nWhat they have in common: Aside from wearing tank tops, both are known for being bad boys. Johnny is infamously remembered for thrashing a hotel room, while Justin is known for terrorizing his neighborhood with his driving.\n\nWho wins: As far as I know, Johnny never had to flex his muscles to show his toughness, while Justin is trying very hard to shed his little boy image. That’s the challenge when you start young in the business.\n\n3) Johnny Depp vs. Robert Pattinson\n\nWhat they have in common: They have both made women swoon with their brushed up long hair and dreamy gazes. They also played vampires in the big screen. Rob in Twilight and Johnny in Dark Shadows.\n\nWho wins: What Johnny lacked in chest hair, he made up through the bangs. Rob exudes depth that will remind you of young Johnny. But as far as acting goes, he is still stuck with the Edward persona, while Johnny easily jumped from one character to another during his younger years.\n\n4) Johnny Depp vs. Ryan Gosling\n\nWhat they have in common: They both have a tendency to fall in love with their co-star. Johnny did it with Winona Ryder (Edward Scissorhands) and Amber Heard (The Rum Diary) while Ryan got involved with Rachel McAdams (The Notebook) and Eva Mendes (The Place Beyond the Pines).\n\nWho wins: Both men have gone viral through fan-made posts that show their romantic side. While what Ryan says in his memes were written by fans, Johnny’s were his own words. So, Johnny wins still.\n\n5) Johnny Depp vs. James Franco\n\nWhat they have in common: Both are multi-dimensional individuals. Johnny acts, directs, paints, sings, plays the guitar and writes songs. James acts, directs, produces, paints, teaches and writes. They have both been compared to Hollywood legend James Dean too.\n\nWho wins: Marlon Brando, who was best friends with James Dean said it himself. No one comes closer to James Dean than Johnny Depp. Anyway, I think both Depp and Franco have already surpassed whatever Dean has accomplished. But what if he lived longer?\n\n6) Johnny Depp vs. Adam Levine\n\nWhat they have in common: They both have slender and inked bodies. They’re both musicians and they both dated models. Johnny was engaged to supermodel Kate Moss and Adam is currently linked to Sports Illustrated model Nina Agdal after breaking up with a Victoria’s Secret model.\n\nWho wins: Adam has the more successful recording career, obviously. But then Johnny is friends with rock legends Keith Richards, Steven Tyler, Alice Cooper, and Slash while scoring one box-office hit after another. You choose.\n\n7) Johnny Depp vs. Joseph Gordon-Levitt\n\nWhat they have in common: Both like to play quirky characters and have gained indie credibility by starring in small, low-budgeted films. Joseph is into music too.\n\nWho wins: Of all the young stars today, Joseph seems to be the closest to Johnny in terms of career choices. He has proven to be ready to take on any role, whether for a big or small movie. As of now, he has to collect more acting nominations to at least be mentioned in the same breath as the Johnny Depp.\n\n8) Johnny Depp vs. Taylor Lautner\n\nWhat they have in common: Both actors have Native American roots and have played as such in the movies (Taylor in the Twilight Saga and Johnny in The Lone Ranger). Yeah, I think that’s about how similar they are.\n\nWho wins: Taylor easily beats Johnny in the battle of biceps. Yeah, that’s about the only edge he has on Johnny, who has also long embraced his ancestry. The actor shared recently that he was adopted by a Comanche tribe and was given the name Mah-Woo-Meh, which means “shape-shifter.” How appropriate.\n\n9) Johnny Depp vs. Epy Quizon\n\n(Sorry, I just had to inject a little Pinoy flavor somewhere)\n\nWhat they have in common: Dudes got the same look.\n\nWho wins: You know who.\n\nTOTAL SCORE: JOHNNY – 9 wins. Give it to him, it’s still his birthday month.\n\nWow, can you believe it? Johnny Depp is already 50 years old! As I am a big fan of his since his Tommy Hanson and Cry-Baby days, I came up with a little list to celebrate this milestone, which happened last June 9.\n\nHere are 9 reasons why we still love John Christopher Depp II.\n\n1) He doesn’t get old.\n\nWell, it is more of he is aging gracefully. For someone not known for his vanity or for healthy living, Johnny is looking more like 35 rather than 50.\n\nMust be good genes but whatever the reason is, the ladies are happy Johnny still looks like this, and the guys are happy to have an excuse to be scruffy.\n\n2) He is an artist.\n\nWe all know him as one of his generation’s most gifted actors. The great Marlon Brando said this himself. However, acting is just one Depp’s creative channels. He also paints and is a long-time musician.\n\nAmong his masterpieces is a portrait of Rolling Stone’s Keith Richards, who was his inspiration for his Capt. Jack Sparrow character in the Pirates of the Carribean. Richards eventually played his dad in the film.\n\nHe was also a part of bands The Kids and P. These days, he would be seen jamming on stage with the likes of Marilyn Manson and Aerosmith.\n\n3) He’s unpredictable.\n\nWith a knack for playing oddballs and eccentric characters early in his career, Johnny was considered to be anti-Hollywood. He would pass up big roles in films like Speed (that went to Keanu Reeves) and Legends of the Fall (which went to Brad Pitt) to do small yet challenging films.\n\nHe has been unpredictable like that. But what has been more surprising lately is that he is now one of Hollywood’s top-paid actors, thanks to a string of box-office hits he gathered by going mainstream.\n\nEven if he seems to have mellowed down (euphemism for “sellout”), it’s nice to see that we still see his craziness and creativity in the characters he plays in the big movies.\n\n4) He doesn’t give a shit.\n\nFor all his recent successes, Johnny’s remained the same guy off-screen. He is rarely seen in the public and is seldom interviewed. Instead of living in LA or New York, he stays in Southern France where he lives “the simple life” with his children.\n\nWhile he would be seen once in a while looking dapper in suits, he still shows up at the red carpet sometimes looking like he can’t pay for a stylist. And we love it.\n\n5) He is nice to his fans.\n\nJohnny is said to be always accommodating to people asking for autographs or wanting to take a picture of him. The web is full of stories from fans narrating their great experiences with the actor.\n\nAnd while he has been gracious with the paparazzi, once he got angry at them when they shoved an 11-year old girl to get a better shot of him.\n\n6) He’s a cool dad.\n\nDespite his busy schedule, Johnny still has time to attend school events with his kids Lily-Rose Melody and Jack. He also has time to bring them to events like the Iggy Pop concert. How cool is that?\n\n7) He’s no diva.\n\nJohnny has played the title character in many films. Among these are Ed Wood, Donnie Brasco, and Sweeney Todd. He’s been the lead star in most of his recent movies so it’s logical that at this point of career, there is no way he’s going to play second fiddle in a movie. Wrong.\n\nJohnny just played sidekick to Armie Hammer’s the Lone Ranger, which is fine because his role Tonto just fits in alongside Willy Wonka and Edward Scissorhands. It also gave him an opportunity to get in touch with his Native American heritage.\n\n8) He loves his mom.\n\nThe honor of being the first woman whose name was inked on Johnny Depp’s body does not belong to his ex-girlfriend Winona Ryder (remember “Winona Forever”). It belongs to his mother, Betty Sue.\n\nUnlike the Winona tattoo (which now reads “Wino Forever”), the Betty Sue tattoo remains intact and the same.\n\n9) He is romantic.\n\nAfter one failed marriage and a series of failed engagements with the likes of Ryder, supermodel Kate Moss, and former long-time partner (and baby mama) Vanessa Paradis, it is possible that Johnny has lost his romantic edge. Well, recent reports claim the contrary.\n\nA story on the website www.mirror.uk said that after a fight with on and off-again girlfriend Amber Heard (The Rum Diary), Johnny built a bar in her honor – on his private island – and even named a beach after her.\n\nWhat a sweet and grand gesture, indeed. But I guess nothing can beat this declaration of love that can bring us right back to the late ’80s and early ’90s.\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY JOHNNY DEPP!\n\nDisclaimer: I do not own the photos above.
