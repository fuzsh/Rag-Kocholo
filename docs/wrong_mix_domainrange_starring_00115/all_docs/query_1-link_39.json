        "text": "Miracle Mile (1988)\n\nDirected by Steve De Jarnatt\n\nStarring:\n\nAnthony Edwards\n\nMare Winningham\n\nDenise Crosby\n\nMykelti Williamson\n\nKurt Fuller\n\nMusic by Tangerine Dream\n\nRunning time: 87 minutes\n\nPlot Synopsis: (via IMDB)\n\nA young man hears a chance phone call telling him that a nuclear war has started and missiles will hit his city in 70 minutes.\n\nMy Opinion:\n\nWhat‚Äôs this? An apocalyptic movie from my beloved 1980s with a Tangerine Dream score yet I‚Äôd not even HEARD of it let alone ever seen it?! How is this possible?!?! Well, I think UK Netflix is finally getting better as they‚Äôre starting to stick some slightly obscure 80s films on there, which is exactly what I want! I‚Äôm always on the lookout for lesser known movies from the 80s (and 70s) and Netflix has surprised me twice in the past month with this and then with one I watched a couple weeks ago (Ladies And Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains. I can‚Äôt wait to review that!).\n\nI‚Äôll start by saying that Miracle Mile isn‚Äôt exactly a great movie & it‚Äôs obvious why it didn‚Äôt end up some mainstream hit at the time. However, I liked it because it‚Äôs my type of thing and I‚Äôll probably end up giving it a higher rating than it may actually deserve. I think my positive reviews here are sometimes taken as recommendations but I‚Äôd only recommend this one to a select few people. I kind of attempted to explain my rating system in my recent Re-Rated post (HERE). For example, though I LOVE Hardware and gave it a really positive review, I‚Äôve only actually recommended it to two people (who haven‚Äôt watched it) as I know it‚Äôs only for a certain type of person. So I take no responsibility for anyone hating this if they watch it! Make up your own mind & don‚Äôt get mad at me if you choose to watch this and then hate it like MovieRob did after I declared my love for Hardware. üòâ\n\nMiracle Mile is an odd one. From the tiny bit I read when I discovered it on Netflix & from looking at some pictures, I thought it may be more of an ‚Äúapocalyptic romance‚Äù and in a way it almost looked like it could be closer to an 80s teen film than a dreary nuclear war film (as in, it looked like it would be a little closer to WarGames than Threads but it ended up somewhere in between the two). There IS a romance that‚Äôs quite sweet but not in a bad or annoying way ‚Äì I liked how it was fit in around the story of how the main character (Anthony Edwards) is going to get to safety in only 70 minutes after hearing a chance phone call telling him missiles are about to strike his city. He‚Äôs an awkward guy and he‚Äôs only just met a quirky girl who seems to be his perfect match (Mare Winningham). After missing their date due to his alarm clock not going off, he receives the phone call & then must track her down in order to save her. For anyone not into romance, they don‚Äôt exactly get a lot of screen time together but when they do I liked seeing their strange little relationship & Winningham‚Äôs innocent & almost childlike character (except when she says to Edwards ‚ÄúThird date, Harry, I‚Äôm gonna screw your eyes blue‚Äú).\n\nWhen I mentioned this movie, someone somewhere (sorry, I don‚Äôt remember who ‚Äì it may have been on Twitter) said something about Mare Winningham being a second rate Lea Thompson but, really, we have a movie that stars Goose instead of Maverick so it was less likely to be a big blockbuster with Anthony Edwards in the lead. It also looks & feels pretty low budget (I have no idea if it was) and the acting from some of the supporting characters isn‚Äôt the greatest. But, hey ‚Äì I liked the story and it went in a way I wasn‚Äôt really expecting. It‚Äôs nice to watch a movie that‚Äôs not 100% predictable for a change. Edwards meets a lot of different types of people in his 70 minutes of running around the Miracle Mile neighborhood of L.A. and it was fun seeing faces I recognize from other 80s films & TV shows.\n\nYou of course have Edwards & Winningham in this who, although not often in leading roles, were in their fair share of big 80s movies (Top Gun, St. Elmo‚Äôs Fire, Revenge Of The Nerds, etc). You also have Mykelti Williamson (Forrest Gump), Denise Crosby (Star Trek: TNG & Pet Sematary ‚Äì two things I loved way too much!), Kelly Jo Minter (Mask ‚Äì an all-time favorite film of mine), O-Lan Jones (crazy lady in Edward Scissorhands), Jenette Goldstein (the woman who stabs the guy through the milk carton in Terminator 2 and who was Vasquez in Aliens, which is possibly the best movie ever!), Earl Boen (also in Terminator 1, 2 & 3!), and Brian Thompson (in The Terminator! what‚Äôs with all the Terminator people in this?! okay ‚Äì looks like they‚Äôre from the same film company or something). I can‚Äôt find a good picture of Brian Thompson from Miracle Mile so here he is in The Terminator ‚Äì he has a face that‚Äôs hard to forget!\n\nMy favorite ‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs that guy‚Äù actor, though, is Kurt Fuller (Wayne‚Äôs World) & I was very happy to see him in this! Here‚Äôs Fuller in Miracle Mile ‚Äì he probably has the most memorable scene of the whole movie.\n\nSummary:\n\nMiracle Mile certainly wasn‚Äôt quite what I was expecting but I love that it managed to actually surprise me. It‚Äôs somewhat quirky & unpredictable. It won‚Äôt be for everyone but I enjoyed it and, as always, enjoyed seeing familiar faces from what‚Äôs probably my favorite era of movies. The Tangerine Dream score did help to give it that 80s feel I love although none of it was quite as good as the train sex music from Risky Business. There was one great totally Tangerine Dream-y scene which I‚Äôll include a YouTube clip of at the end. Another scene like that really would have helped this strange little film I‚Äôd never before heard of but I did like it & am hoping to discover more movies like this that I somehow managed to miss when I was younger.\n\nMy Rating: 7.5/10\n\n**This scene is safe to watch ‚Äì it‚Äôs toward the beginning of the film & just shows how Edwards misses his date. It‚Äôs a great piece of music.**\n\nMidnight In Paris (2011)\n\nDirected & Written by Woody Allen\n\nStarring:\n\nKathy Bates\n\nAdrien Brody\n\nCarla Bruni\n\nMarion Cotillard\n\nKurt Fuller\n\nRachel McAdams\n\nMichael Sheen\n\nOwen Wilson\n\nRunning time: 94 minutes\n\nPlot Synopsis: (via Wikipedia)\n\nSet in Paris, the film follows Gil Pender, a screenwriter, who is forced to confront the shortcomings of his relationship with his materialistic fianc√©e and their divergent goals, which become increasingly exaggerated as he travels back in time each night at midnight.\n\nMy Opinion:\n\nThis has nothing whatsoever to do with Midnight In Paris but I just have to say this: I think I deserve a payrise for getting the word ‚ÄúXenomorph‚Äù into my company‚Äôs newsletter last week.\n\nNow, onto Midnight In Paris: a movie I watched months ago but never reviewed because I don‚Äôt really have much to say about it. But, shit ‚Äì apparently a lot of you like it as it‚Äôs in third place in that poll of movies you want me to review. So, damn, I better stay true to my word! üôÇ\n\nHere‚Äôs my big, embarrassing movie blogger confession: I‚Äôve never watched a Woody Allen film. NONE! So Midnight In Paris was my first & only. Tell me, Woody Allen fans ‚Äì was this the place to start? I assume not. But, I dunno‚Ä¶ I really liked the sound of it plus I‚Äôm a big fan of Van Gogh so I was a sucker for that poster up there. ^ I am NOT, however, a fan of Owen Wilson. Probably because he‚Äôs been in too many of those annoying Wes Anderson movies. Plus, I‚Äôve always hated his voice. And, you know, that nose. I‚Äôm sounding bitchy now but I‚Äôm just trying to point out how much I do NOT like Owen Wilson so that you know this may have had an effect on my enjoyment of my first Woody Allen movie. However, it‚Äôs definitely a good film & I can understand why some people really like it. It needs to be your type of ‚Äúthing‚Äù, though.\n\nWith this movie, as with Wilson‚Äôs character, it really comes alive when it‚Äôs in the past. These scenes are so much better than those set in present day with Wilson‚Äôs absolute bitch of a fianc√©e (Rachel McAdams). But that‚Äôs the whole point ‚Äì a viewer may very well end up loving 1920‚Äôs Paris just as much as Wilson‚Äôs character does. I may not be able to fully relate to a love of 1920‚Äôs Paris but I can relate to feeling nostalgic about a certain time. I hate 2015! The world is shit now. I‚Äôd probably go back to the 1970s/early 80s. Hmm‚Ä¶ I suppose that‚Äôs a little unoriginal. I‚Äôd probably be happy in any time that‚Äôs before the Internet but after indoor plumbing! Oh, and after women stopped being treated like shit. Wait‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre still treated like shit! Oh cool ‚Äì I think I‚Äôve written enough now. I can finish this horrible first-ever Woody Allen review I‚Äôm making a mess of! üôÇ\n\nSummary:\n\nMidnight In Paris is a good film and I would assume those who love Woody Allen films loved this one too (not that I can compare it to another film of his since I‚Äôve not seen any). I‚Äôm probably not cultured enough to have fully appreciated all the famous historical figures Wilson‚Äôs character meets in the past but I did find this a very fun part of the story as I actually didn‚Äôt know beforehand that anyone ‚Äúspecial‚Äù was going to be in this. I also didn‚Äôt mind the romance in this although I‚Äôm not the type to usually go for that. Oh yeah! And my favorite ‚Äúhey, it‚Äôs that guy!‚Äù guy was in this (Kurt Fuller ‚Äì never thought to look up his name before now). I can‚Äôt say Midnight In Paris is a movie I fell in love with or that I‚Äôll ever watch it again, though. I liked the originality & it was entertaining but I know I probably should have watched an older Woody Allen film first.\n\nMy Rating: 6.5/10"
