        "text": "The new Tim Burton movie stars Johnny Depp as an ageless weirdo, whose magical skills are matched only by his hangups about where he came from and how he is supposed to make friends with regular people. The film is called “Edward Scissorhands.” I beg your pardon. The film is called “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” and it springs from the book by Roald Dahl.\n\nCharlie (Freddie Highmore) lives in a heap of a house with his parents (Noah Taylor and Helena Bonham Carter) and a selection of bedridden grandparents who appear to be rehearsing for a production of “Endgame.” The least collapsed of them is Grandpa Joe (David Kelly), who used to be employed locally at Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory. One day, Grandpa Joe and his colleagues were sacked to make way for a workforce of Oompa-Loompas—tiny mischief-makers, hired from distant shores.\n\nReaders of the book will recall what happens next. Mr. Wonka establishes a contest. Five golden tickets are hidden inside five random chocolate bars, offering five children the chance to tour the Wonka factory. We know full well that Charlie will find a ticket, yet there is still a great crunch of satisfaction when he does. Accompanied by Grandpa Joe, Charlie arrives at the gates of the factory on a shining day and meets his fellow-winners: Augustus Gloop, Violet Beauregarde, Veruca Salt, and Mike Teavee. (Dahl never hung back on names.) All are present on-screen, with a number of tweaks. Augustus, for example, is still pneumatically plump, but now he hails from Germany, where we see him posing in a sausage shop. This is so unjust, outdated, and downright obvious that all you can do is laugh, and it suggests a cackling kinship between author and director. Neither so much as nods to political correctness—Dahl because he knows that children are the most incorrect members of society, and Burton because politics of any flavor belongs to a faraway place named Planet Normal, upon which he has yet to land.\n\nThe remaining plot is an infantilized version of Agatha Christie. The more unsavory children are herded into a closed environment and, one by one, eliminated. Augustus is sucked up a glass pipe, Veruca is attacked by trained squirrels, and so forth. The role of the mock villain is taken by Willy Wonka himself, and, in the book, we heartily concur with the penalties that he inflicts; Violet does deserve to be inflated into a giant blueberry, the acidic little brat. But what if the perpetrator is Johnny Depp? And what if he dresses like Oscar Wilde, smiles like Michael Jackson, enunciates like Tootsie, and wears rubbery purple gloves to keep away the germs? Where does moral tutelage end and sadistic farce begin? There is an Old World courtesy to Dahl’s Wonka that is abandoned by the film; he now retorts to overtures of friendship (“I’m Violet Beauregarde”) with a venomous “I don’t care.” He is what Macbeth would call a cream-faced loon, and far more of a child than the actual children around him. There is no doubt that he despises them, and that raises questions as to why he has lured them, with promises of candy, into his edible home.\n\nI suspect that Depp has gone to these unappetizing lengths because he fears that, without a handful of spice in the mix, the movie might overdose on whimsy. Depp is getting used to these mercy missions, having realized that eyeliner alone could stop “Pirates of the Caribbean” from sinking into period heartiness. He is right to worry, because “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” is surprisingly unwild. It is often astounding, but if you hand a hundred and fifty million dollars to Tim Burton and tell him to spend it on sweetmeats you damn well expect to be astounded. He summons all the drooling luxuries that abound on the page (the thunderous, cocoa-hued waterfall is perfectly rendered), while adding a few toppings of his own—the bulging pink sheep, for instance, that are sheared for their fleeces of cotton candy. The trouble is that the eye, no less than the palate, is at first dizzied, then acclimatized, then jaded, and, finally, semi-sickened. You don’t know what treat is coming next, but you know that it will be succulent and strange, and that very knowledge starts to dull the edge of your enjoyment, as if it were coating your tongue.\n\nThis is not so in the novel, and for one good reason: Roald Dahl was a man of speed. His imagination was as fat as a pig, but his literary method was lean. In an early draft of the book, fifteen children entered the factory; he tested the result on a young relative, who pronounced it “rotten”; in the end, only the five made the cut. As for the opening chapter, “Here Comes Charlie,” it’s one of the most efficient scene-setters since the start of “Great Expectations,” with a compound of impoverishment and yearning so sharp that it pricks the senses, like vinegar. (And it’s still not as quick as “James and the Giant Peach,” which kills off a couple of parents in thirty-five seconds flat.) Dahl inherited from Dickens a direct feed into the terrors and wishful thinkings of the young, and that is why Freddie Highmore, as Charlie, is the nerve center of the film. Highmore, as he proved opposite Depp in “Finding Neverland,” is up for high jinks, but he sees through low tricks. You catch a straightforwardness in him, a sanity in his gaze, that Dahl would have trusted. What virtue is there in a maddened, quaking world unless a small boy like Charlie or James can hold steady and register the shocks?\n\nThere is one aspect of Burton’s film which is wholly foreign to the book. He and his screenwriter, John August, have decided to honor Mr. Wonka with a backstory. And so we hear of his deprived upbringing at the hands of a father who, as a dentist, disapproved of candy. This is smoothly done, and the father is played by Christopher Lee, but the whole conceit is superfluous. It shrinks rather than heightens the oddity of Willy Wonka, and its sole purpose is to crank up the director’s obsession with parenthood. (Depp is to Lee what he was to Vincent Price in “Edward Scissorhands,” and even “Batman” traced its heroics back to a childhood trauma.) Some things in life just cry out not to be explained, and the urge to make chocolate, like the desire to eat it, is one of them. Dahl’s story was never intended to be anything other than a sticky-fingered feast, whereas the movie flits through pedophobic creepiness and ends up as a slightly costive parable of family values. To chide a movie that oozes so many gags may sound churlish, but you can’t help feeling that a fantasist as accomplished as Burton can manage this kind of project with his eyes shut. The trouble is that, from film to film, his dreams are starting to look the same.\n\nThe first twenty minutes of “Wedding Crashers” are rabid with simple pleasure. The crashers in question are Jeremy (Vince Vaughn) and John (Owen Wilson), a pair of divorce mediators in Washington, D.C., who spend their summer weekends rolling up to the weddings of people they don’t know and becoming the life, the soul, and, in many disgusting instances, the smeared cake frosting of the party.\n\nI was wondering when somebody would make a movie out of this compelling contact sport, with its built-in safety procedures. (If guests from the groom’s side don’t recognize you, they always assume that you know the bride, and vice versa.) The director, David Dobkin, and his writers, Steve Faber and Bob Fisher, kick off with a hectic montage of good will, as John and Jeremy grin their way into Jewish, Chinese, and other ceremonies, eagerly joining in with the dances and toasts. In short, they are the most convincing democrats that you could hope to find, delighting not in cultural one-upmanship but in the glories of ethnic diversity. Could there be a more cheerful sight than that of Vaughn marching into an Indian marriage service and giving his name, at the door, as Sanjay Collins?"
