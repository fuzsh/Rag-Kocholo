        "text": "Each year, as the air turns cold and the music merry, comes the inevitable debate about the best Christmas movies to stream during the holidays. There are those who insist their yuletide entertainment be staunchly seasonal—think the candy-coated North Pole of The Santa Clause franchise or Will Ferrell’s Buddy the Elf skipping through a department store. Others prefer films that take a more unconventional approach to the festivities, such as the action-packed Die Hard or erotically existential Eyes Wide Shut. Enter Vanity Fair’s Christmas favorites, 65 offerings that span from certified classics of the 1940s to new holiday movies destined for a yearly rewatch—a little something for everyone under the tree.\n\nThe Holdovers\n\nRelease Year: 2023\n\nDirector: Alexander Payne\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Paul Giamatti, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Dominic Sessa, Carrie Preston\n\n“I just don’t see it as a Christmas movie,” filmmaker Alexander Payne told Vanity Fair of his latest, which stars Paul Giamatti, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, and newcomer Dominic Sessa as three lost souls stranded at a New England prep school over the holidays. “It’s a movie that could take place only at Christmas because of the nature of it,” sure—but when the director sees “some early reviews like, ‘Oh, people will watch this every Christmas,’ I’m like, ‘Really? Great.’ But I didn’t think about that.” Nevertheless, it’s difficult to watch The Holdovers, written by David Hemingson, without sinking into its seasonal setting—complete with snow-covered windowpanes and 1970s holiday needle drops.\n\nSanta Camp\n\nRelease Year: 2022\n\nDirector: Nick Sweeney\n\nLeave any preconceived ideas about a Santa-centric documentary at the door. Centered on a New Hampshire campsite where professional Santas, Mrs. Clauses, and elves train to be experts in jolly, the film is actually all about how these mystical creatures get packaged and sold in society—in an upbeat, cheerful sort of way. Much of the doc confronts Santa’s diversity problem, told through the lens of a Black Santa, a transgender Santa, and a Santa with special needs who all attend the training program in hopes of disrupting a mythology that has largely embraced just elderly white men.\n\nFalling for Christmas\n\nRelease Year: 2022\n\nDirector: Janeen Damian\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Lindsay Lohan, Chord Overstreet, George Young, Olivia Perez\n\nSure, it’s a fairly by-the-numbers tale in which a hotel heiress recovers from head-injury-induced amnesia at a cozy but struggling lodge owned by a charming widower. But this Netflix rom-com featuring Glee’s Chord Overstreet has one important factor working in its favor: the long-awaited return of Lindsay Lohan as leading lady. It’s best to just lean into the plot’s lunacy and let its smoothing seasonal magic take hold. You won’t be alone—the movie became a certified hit on streaming, earning more than 31.2 million views in its first four days of release.\n\nThree Wise Men and a Baby\n\nRelease Year: 2022\n\nDirector: Terry Ingram\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Paul Campbell, Tyler Hynes, Andrew W. Walker, Margaret Colin\n\nDetermining which of Hallmark’s many, many holiday offerings are worth watching is an art form in and of itself. But cornball title aside, this Christmas-themed take on the hit 1987 comedy is one of the network’s best in recent years. Resident Hallmark hunks Andrew W. Walker, Tyler Hynes, and Paul Campbell (also a cowriter with fellow network regular Kimberley Sustad) play the Brenner brothers, who must put aside familial discord to raise a baby who gets unexpectedly placed in their path. Everyone, including their mother—played by the original film’s Margaret Colin—is playfully aware of how outlandish this premise is. That allows the audience to have fun with it too, so much so that it became cable’s most-watched movie of 2022 upon debut.\n\nSingle All the Way\n\nRelease Year: 2021\n\nDirector: Michael Mayer\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Michael Urie, Philemon Chambers, Luke Macfarlane, Jennifer Coolidge\n\nWhen Luke Macfarlane booked this film, following dozens of leading roles on Hallmark but before the release of his R-rated Bros, which features multiple Christmastime scenes, he found himself in hot water. As Macfarlane told Vanity Fair, people behind both Bros and his Hallmark titles were “not happy” that he had dipped his toe somewhere in between the two. Perhaps that’s the best way to describe the delicate tone of Netflix’s queer rom-com, which toes the line between raunchy humor and sentimental realism. Michael Urie’s Peter and Philemon Chambers’s Nick are longtime friends whose relationship teeters on the edge of romance just before they pose as real-life partners to smooth things over during a trip to visit Peter’s overbearing family. It also includes a star turn from Jennifer Coolidge as scene-stealing Aunt Sandy, who has a far more copacetic dynamic with these gays than the ones she (correctly) accused of trying to murder her in season two of The White Lotus.\n\nLove Hard\n\nRelease Year: 2021\n\nDirector: Hernán Jiménez\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Nina Dobrev, Jimmy O. Yang, Darren Barnet, Harry Shum Jr., James Saito\n\nCatfishing during Christmastime serves as the focal point for this R-rated holiday rom-com starring Nina Dobrev as a writer who learns she’s being scammed when she flies 3,000 miles to visit her online paramour (posing as Darren Barnett, though he’s actually Jimmy O. Yang).\n\nJingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey\n\nRelease Year: 2020\n\nDirector: David E. Talbert\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Forest Whitaker, Madalen Mills, Keegan-Michael Key, Anika Noni Rose\n\nIf you’re going to watch a far-fetched Netflix romantic comedy, why not go for the one in which Vanessa Hudgens stars as identical women—one royal, the other a baker living in Chicago—who switch lives and fall in love during the holiday season. Naturally, Hudgens upped the ante for subsequent films—playing three different characters in both 2020’s The Princess Switch: Switched Again and 2021’s The Princess Switch 3: Romancing The Star.\n\nThe Man Who Invented Christmas\n\nRelease Year: 2017\n\nDirector: Bharat Nalluri\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Dan Stevens, Christopher Plummer, Jonathan Pryce\n\nA Christmas Carol is one of the most frequently revisited and reinterpreted holiday stories of all time; but how did it come to be? The Man Who Invented Christmas follows Charles Dickens (Dan Stevens) as he tries to bounce back from several recent creative and financial failures. While writing A Christmas Carol on a tight and inflexible deadline, his characters appear to interact with him, including his protagonist, Ebenezer Scrooge (Christopher Plummer).\n\nA Bad Moms Christmas\n\nRelease Year: 2017\n\nDirector: Jon Lucas and Scott Moore\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn, Christine Baranski, Cheryl Hines, Susan Sarandon\n\nIn this sequel to 1999’s The Best Man, Mia (Monica Calhoun) and her husband Lance (Morris Chestnut) invite their old college friends to spend Christmas with them at their lavish home—the first time they’ve all been together since the events of The Best Man. Some old tensions resurface, which may be why only Harper (Taye Diggs) notices that Mia has lost a lot of weight and doesn’t seem to be feeling well….\n\nArthur Christmas\n\nRelease Year: 2011\n\nDirector: Sarah Smith and Barry Cook\n\nNoteworthy Cast: James McAvoy, Bill Nighy, Jim Broadbent, Hugh Laurie\n\nAardman Animations, of Wallace and Gromit fame, is one of the studios that brings us this take on North Pole operations. Sitting Santa Malcolm Claus (voice of Jim Broadbent) supervises while his son and presumed successor Steve (Hugh Laurie) runs deliveries with military efficiency. Steve’s younger brother Arthur (James McAvoy) answers letters. But when Steve and Arthur argue over whether one missed gift is an acceptable screw-up, Arthur goes rogue, determined to make it right despite his total lack of experience.\n\nIn Bruges\n\nRelease Year: 2008\n\nDirector: Martin McDonagh\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, Ralph Fiennes\n\nNearly 15 years before they’d reunite—and earn Oscar nominations—as former best friends in The Banshees of Inisherin, Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson took cover in Martin McDonagh’s feature-film debut. Set during Christmastime, Farrell is Ray, an amateur hit man who accidentally kills a child while purposely killing a priest. His far more experienced partner is Gleeson’s Ken, with whom he hunkers down in the historic Belgian town of Bruges to shelter while their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) decides their fate.\n\nFour Christmases\n\nRelease Year: 2008\n\nDirector: Seth Gordon\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Vince Vaughn, Reese Witherspoon, Sissy Spacek, Robert Duvall\n\nBecause each of their four parents has divorced, remarried, and created stressful new households, Brad (Vince Vaughn) and Kate (Reese Witherspoon) have always escaped familial obligations by planning glamorous travel and claiming they’re doing charity work. But when a weather system cancels their flight so disastrously that they’re interviewed about it on TV, all their parents learn that they’ll be staying in the contiguous U.S.—and they have to strain their own relationship by visiting all their families.\n\nThis Christmas\n\nRelease Year: 2007\n\nDirector: Preston A. Whitmore II\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Regina King, Idris Elba, Delroy Lindo, Loretta Devine\n\nA series of mishaps and misunderstandings bring burglar Harry (Robert Downey Jr.) from a botched job in New York to an audition, and then a party, in Los Angeles (at Christmastime!). It turns out to be a fateful affair for Harry: he meets PI “Gay” Perry (Val Kilmer) and reunites with his childhood crush Harmony (Michelle Monaghan), and the three of them get snarled up in a complicated caper.\n\nThe Family Stone\n\nRelease Year: 2005\n\nDirector: Thomas Bezucha\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Sarah Jessica Parker, Diane Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Luke Wilson\n\nEverett Stone (Dermot Mulroney) is bringing his girlfriend Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) to spend Christmas with his family. But as warm as they can be, Meredith is so nervous she makes a terrible impression. Everett’s sister Amy (Rachel McAdams) already has her knives out after meeting Meredith once before; Everett’s mother Sybil (Diane Keaton) fears he’s going to ask her for an heirloom engagement ring to propose to Meredith; and things only get worse when Meredith begs her sister Julie (Claire Danes) to come give her moral support, and all the Stones like Julie better—possibly including Everett.\n\nChristmas with the Kranks\n\nRelease Year: 2004\n\nDirector: Joe Roth\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Jamie Lee Curtis, Tim Allen, Dan Aykroyd\n\nIn an adaptation of John Grisham’s 2001 novel Skipping Christmas, Jamie Lee Curtis and Tim Allen star as a well-meaning couple who opt to do just that. But it’s not long before their suburban neighbors catch wind of their plan to trade tinsel and holly for a tropical vacation—and do everything in their power to stop it.\n\nMean Girls\n\nRelease Year: 2004\n\nDirector: Mark Waters\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert, Amanda Seyfried\n\nLong before there was the Mean Girls musical (which, yes, does contain actual music), there was a lascivious dance performance to “Jingle Bell Rock” at a Christmas assembly in the original 2004 film. It’s a major dynamic-shifting sequence in the film, as the previously uncool Cady (Lindsay Lohan) rises in the ranks to become Regina George’s (Rachel McAdams) best friend over fellow Plastics Gretchen Weiners (future Hallmark Christmas queen Lacey Chabert) and Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried). The scene became so iconic that it got recreated in the music for Ariana Grande’s “Thank U, Next,” featuring Grande as Regina, her Victorious costar Elizabeth Gillies as Cady, and Kris Jenner as Amy Poehler’s “Cool Mom.”\n\nThe Polar Express\n\nRelease Year: 2004\n\nDirector: Robert Zemeckis\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Tom Hanks (over and over again)\n\nRobert Zemeckis is known for visual spectacle, from Back to the Future to Death Becomes Her, but nothing scratches a particular seasonal itch like his adaptation of a seminal picture book written and illustrated by Chris Van Allsburg. For however strange you remember this film being, it’s worth revisiting as a reminder that Tom Hanks expertly, eerily shifts between six different roles; that an earworm of a “Hot Chocolate” song is way better than it has any right to be; and that Zemeckis’s Jim Carrey–led take on A Christmas Carol in 2009 could never match the mystical oddities of The Polar Express.\n\nElf\n\nRelease Year: 2003\n\nDirector: Jon Favreau\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Will Ferrell, Zooey Deschanel, James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, Bob Newhart\n\nIt becomes clear minutes into Jon Favreau’s sophomore directorial feature that Buddy (Will Ferrell) will never quite fit with the other elves at the North Pole, both because of his physical size and toy-making ineptitude. Why? Because he’s human, as Buddy learns from his Papa Elf (Bob Newhart), who adopted and raised him. In the search for his greater purpose, Buddy takes a mystical journey to meet his biological father, Walter (James Caan), in New York City, a land rife with treasures including “the world’s best cup of coffee” and part-time Gimbels elf Jovie (Zooey Deschanel).\n\nEloise at Christmastime\n\nRelease Year: 2003\n\nDirector: Kevin Lima\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Sofia Vassilieva, Julie Andrews, Christine Baranski, Gavin Creel\n\nThis under-the-radar gem, aired by ABC and Walt Disney Studios as a follow-up to 2003’s Eloise at the Plaza, was adapted from Kay Thompson and Hilary Knight’s beloved children’s books. Sofia Vassilieva stars as a holiday-obsessed Eloise, who celebrates the season at the Plaza alongside her doting if occasionally disapproving nanny, played by Julie Andrews. The whimsical picture books are brought to delightful life, thanks in part to a musical subplot featuring Tony-winning actor Gavin Creel as Bill, a bellhop and aspiring actor who acts out songs with Eloise. As lensed by Kevin Lima, who went on to direct Amy Adams in Enchanted, the musical moments are among the movie’s best.\n\nLove Actually\n\nRelease Year: 2003\n\nDirector: Richard Curtis\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Keira Knightley, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson\n\nWhy do we still love Love Actually? Maybe it’s the way the film melds tragedy and comedy. As Vanity Fair’s Katey Rich noted on the film’s 20th anniversary, Love Actually boasts a “dogged optimism that in the face of awfulness—the death of a spouse, infidelity, inexplicably being called fat by your loved ones—the human spirit can prevail.” This is evident in a number of the love stories that play out against the backdrop of London at Christmastime. Karen (Emma Thompson) has no idea her husband Harry (Alan Rickman) is flirting with his new assistant, Mia (Heike Makatsch); Mark (Andrew Lincoln) is tortured by his obsession with Juliet (Keira Knightley), despite having just stood up as best man at her wedding to his friend Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor); the prime minister (Hugh Grant) is drawn to a household staffer (Martine McCutcheon), problematic work dynamics aside; a grieving father (Liam Neeson) and son (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) conspire to make his schoolyard crush a reality; and so on, until we see at the end how they all wildly interconnect.\n\nBad Santa\n\nRelease Year: 2003\n\nDirector: Terry Zwigoff\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Billy Bob Thornton, Brett Kelly, Bernie Mac, Lauren Graham, John Ritter\n\nDirector Doug Liman followed his surprise hit Swingers with this film, set at Christmas in Los Angeles. Supermarket clerk Ronna (Sarah Polley), trying to avoid eviction, pursues a lead to sell ecstasy to a couple of strangers while her co-worker—the actual dealer they were looking for—is out of town. The story spirals outward into several other plots involving a rave, a couple of closeted soap actors, a comedy of errors in Las Vegas, and a shirtless Timothy Olyphant.\n\nStepmom\n\nRelease Year: 1998\n\nDirector: Chris Columbus\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts, Ed Harris, Jena Malone, Liam Aiken\n\nIsabel (Julia Roberts) loves her boyfriend Luke (Ed Harris), but feels inadequate compared to his effortlessly competent ex-wife Jackie (Susan Sarandon). While Isabel has a good relationship with Luke’s son Ben (Liam Aiken), his daughter Anna (Jena Malone) is relentlessly hostile. Jackie and Isabel have already clashed over parenting when Luke puts more stress on their relationship by proposing marriage to Isabel. Then Jackie finds out she has terminal cancer, and realizes she not only has to accept Isabel, but prepare her to raise Jackie’s children when Jackie is gone.\n\nJingle All The Way\n\nRelease Year: 1996\n\nDirector: Brian Levant\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sinbad, Phil Hartman, Rita Wilson\n\nRemakes of any kind are risky business, but perhaps none had more going against it than John Hughes’s take on this 1947 classic. But screenwriter Hughes and director Les Mayfield endeavored to reimagine a film that still gets watched on a yearly basis without even the approval of Macy’s department store (“Coles” is this version’s proxy). In doing so, they produced a perfectly heartfelt, slightly updated version with Elizabeth Perkins as the store event director; Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle; and Mara Wilson as Susan. It’s a lesson in appreciating the original while still welcoming another iteration to the holiday film canon—if only to see a blink-and-you-missed-it Allison Janney as a sassy department store shopper.\n\nThe Santa Clause\n\nRelease Year: 1994\n\nDirector: John Pasquin\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Tim Allen, Eric Lloyd, Wendy Crewson, Judge Reinhold, David Krumholtz\n\nThe whole Santa Clause enterprise has become quite lucrative for Disney, with two increasingly big-budget sequels and a current streaming TV adaptation (though the less said about that, the better) that delves far, far into the lore of Santadom. But it’s the 1994 original that stands above the rest for its utter simplicity. Tim Allen is toy salesman Scott Calvin, a curmudgeonly single father who takes his kid to Denny’s for Christmas Eve dinner hours before a clatter on the roof changes his life forever. When Santa topples from the roof, Calvin finds a card in his suit pocket, which indicates that the reindeer will know what to do, and…long story short, Scott has to become the new Santa Claus.\n\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas\n\nRelease Year: 1993\n\nDirector: Henry Selick\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Chris Sarandon, Catherine O’Hara, Paul Reubens\n\nIts shoddy New York geography aside, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York remains one of the most delightful holiday sequels ever made. The same can’t be said for subsequent follow-ups Home Alone 3, Home Alone 4: Taking Back the Heist, Home Alone: Five Lives, and Home Alone: The Holiday Heist. (Only one of those is made up.)\n\nBatman Returns\n\nRelease Year: 1992\n\nDirector: Tim Burton\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Michael Keaton, Michelle Pfeiffer, Danny DeVito, Christopher Walken\n\nGotham socialites Tucker and Esther Cobblepot (Paul Reubens and Diane Salinger) throw their physically disfigured child into a sewer, where he drifts into the zoo to be raised by penguins. Thirty-three years later, the former Oswald is now The Penguin (Danny DeVito), determined to scheme his way back into society by staging acts of heroism, but also blackmailing local millionaire Max Schreck (Christopher Walken). Schreck’s assistant Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) stumbles upon compromising material; when he pushes her out a window, she discovers she has nine lives. It’s a gnarly plot, but basically: Batman (Michael Keaton) fights two villains, one of whom he’s attracted to, around Christmastime!\n\nEdward Scissorhands\n\nRelease Year: 1990\n\nDirector: Tim Burton\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, Dianne Wiest, Vincent Price\n\nA reclusive inventor (Vincent Price) constructs and raises Edward (Johnny Depp), an artificial boy, but dies of a heart attack before he can replace with hands the scissors that have served that function all Edward’s life. Eventually, Edward is discovered by Peg (Dianne Wiest), an Avon lady, who brings Edward home to live with her. He doesn’t fit into her suburban neighborhood, but he is drawn to her daughter Kim (Winona Ryder).\n\nHome Alone\n\nRelease Year: 1990\n\nDirector: Chris Columbus\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, Catherine O’Hara\n\nThe large and noisy McCallister family gather at Peter (John Heard) and Kate’s (Catherine O’Hara) house the night before a trip to spend Christmas in Paris. A power outage knocks out everyone’s alarms, leading to a mad dash to the airport; not until Kate is seated on the plane does she realize they forgot her 8-year-old son, Kevin (Macaulay Culkin). While Kate scrambles to make her way back home, Kevin looks after himself and protects the house from burglars Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern).\n\nNational Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation\n\nRelease Year: 1989\n\nDirector: Jeremiah S. Chechik\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Chevy Chase, Beverly D’Angelo, Randy Quaid, Juliette Lewis, Johnny Galecki\n\nFor those who grew up in a Christmas Vacation–watching household (hi there), this sequel to 1983’s Vacation remains one of the most quotable, rewatchable Christmas comedies of all time. Returning players Chevy Chase, Beverly D’Angelo, and Randy Quaid are reliably hilarious, but it’s the performances from Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki as their ever-traumatized children (roles recast in each Vacation film) that shine a bit more with each repeat viewing. Even the wealthy, buttoned-up next-door neighbors played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Nicholas Guest are now so beloved that their brief roles have spawned merch alongside the expected Griswold gear.\n\nDie Hard\n\nRelease Year: 1988\n\nDirector: John McTiernan\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Bonnie Bedelia\n\nOn Christmas Eve, New York City detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) reunites with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) at her company’s holiday party atop the partially completed Nakatomi Tower. He’s freshening up after his flight when terrorists break in and start making demands; since they don’t know he’s there, John tries to use his stealth and ingenuity to save the hostages. And would you believe Die Hard 2: Die Harder also involves John McClane having a terrible Christmas Eve?\n\nScrooged (1988)\n\nRelease Year: 1988\n\nDirector: Richard Donner\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Bill Murray, Alfre Woodard, Karen Allen\n\nFrank Cross (Bill Murray) is a TV executive planning a garish adaptation of A Christmas Carol to air live on Christmas Eve. As he gets increasingly stressed, Frank is visited by the ghost of Lew Hayward (John Forsythe), his former mentor, who warns him that more ghosts will be walking him through the events of his life in order to change his heart. Alfre Woodard plays Grace, the Bob Cratchit stand-in, whose son hasn’t spoken since his father died; Karen Allen is Claire, a social worker and the ex-girlfriend Frank left behind in pursuit of his career.\n\nGremlins\n\nRelease Year: 1984\n\nDirector: Joe Dante\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Hoyt Axton, Zach Galligan, Phoebe Cates\n\nFailed inventor Randall Peltzer (Hoyt Axton) thinks he’s found the perfect Christmas gift in a shop in Chinatown: a cuddly little creature called a mogwai. The shop owner (Keye Luke) tries to refuse to sell the mogwai, finally relenting after telling Rand the rules for its care: he must not expose it to sunlight or bright lights, let it get wet, and never feed it after midnight. Rand and his family will learn the hard way how important it is to follow these rules.\n\nA Christmas Story\n\nRelease Year: 1983\n\nDirector: Bob Clark\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Peter Billingsley, Melinda Dillon, Scott Schwartz, Darren McGavin\n\nThere’s an inherent warmth in the original version of this tale—directed and coproduced by Looney Tunes veteran Chuck Jones, and with Boris Karloff voicing the titular character—that’s missing from every subsequent version. Ignore both 2018’s CGI animated version with Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead, and the 2000 live-action film starring Jim Carrey under prosthetics. It is the understated, 25-minute take on the creature with “a heart two sizes too small” that remains the most heartwarming of the bunch, and one of the reasons it gets re-aired yearly on broadcast TV decades after its debut.\n\nA Charlie Brown Christmas\n\nRelease Year: 1965\n\nDirector: Bill Melendez\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Peter Robbins, Chris Doran, Sally Dryer\n\n“Christmas Time Is Here” is the simple but soulful refrain at the center of this 1965 special, born when CBS asked producer Lee Mendelson if he could put together a holiday program in merely six months. As his son, Jason Mendelson, told CBS in 2021, “My father called [Peanuts creator] Charles Schulz and he said, ‘Hey, I just sold Charlie Brown Christmas to CBS. And Charles Schulz said, ‘What’s that?’ And my father said, ‘It’s something you and I have to write over the weekend!’” The result of this expedited process is astonishing. Voiced by Peter Robbins, Charlie Brown is depressed about his lack of Christmas spirit; when he chooses an anemic little tree from the lot, his so-called friends mock his choice. Can Linus’s recitation of the nativity story from the Book of Luke turn things around?\n\nBabes in Toyland\n\nRelease Year: 1961\n\nDirector: Jack Donohue\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Tommy Sands, Annette Funicello, Ray Bolger, Ed Wynn\n\nOnce you get past the part where crooked miser Barnaby (Ray Bolger) tricks Mary Contrary (Annette Funicello) into marrying him after...first tricking her into marrying Tom Piper (Tommy Sands), who then gets kidnapped and falsely reported dead, this is a cute romp for kids! The toy soldier battle is an all-timer. And if you like it, you can stream the 1986 remake—starring Keanu Reeves and Drew Barrymore.\n\nWhite Christmas\n\nRelease Year: 1954\n\nDirector: Michael Curtiz\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, Vera-Ellen\n\nAlthough Holiday Inn had the distinction of featuring a rendition of “White Christmas” first, this is the Bing Crosby–led musical set in a bucolic setting that most associate with the yuletide season. Crosby stars alongside Danny Kaye as a pair of singers who join forces with a sister song-and-dance act to put on a Christmas show in rural Vermont. To add even more confusion in differentiating this film from Holiday Inn, the foursome put on a show in order to save—what else—a financially failing country inn.\n\nMiracle On 34th Street\n\nRelease Year: 1947\n\nDirector: George Seaton\n\nNoteworthy Cast: Edmund Gwenn, Natalie Wood, Maureen O’Hara\n\nWhat some may not know is that 12 years before a full-fledged film was constructed around Irving Berlin’s “White Christmas,” it was actually sung for the first time onscreen in this classic big-screen musical. The whole feature is a showcase for Berlin’s music, as well as the song-and-dance stylings of Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire, who engage in a twisty love triangle with Marjorie Reynolds at a cozy country inn.\n\nThe Shop Around the Corner\n\nRelease Year: 1940\n\nDirector: Ernst Lubitsch\n\nNoteworthy Cast: James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan, Frank Morgan\n\n“You know, people seldom go to the trouble of scratching the surface of things to find the inner truth,” a pre–It’s a Wonderful Life Jimmy Stewart tells his coworker and secret pen pal, played by Margaret Sullavan. She retorts, “Well, I really wouldn’t care to scratch your surface, Mr. Kralik, because I know exactly what I’d find: Instead of a heart, a hand-bag. Instead of a soul, a suitcase. And instead of an intellect, a cigarette lighter…which doesn’t work.” Sound familiar? It’s a quippy exchange recreated by Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in 1998’s You’ve Got Mail. Nora Ephron adapted Ernst Lubitsch’s tale of feuding shop employees with a shielded romantic entanglement for a new generation—but her original inspiration is worth revisiting, no matter how many decades have passed.\n\nAll products featured on Vanity Fair are independently selected by our editors.
