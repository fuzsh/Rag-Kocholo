        "text": "At its core, the Tim Burton directed and co-written movie Edward Scissorhands (1990) is a romantic love story. So much more comes into play in moving this film into the fantastic and the dramatic that the story of love can be lost, however, my perspective is that we should not lose hold of the movie’s core. That we deal in an incompletely built artificially intelligent man amongst a quirky landscape of people behaving badly gives this film charm.\n\nThe movie Edward Scissorhands opens with an elderly grandmother telling her granddaughter the tale of a man, Edward as portrayed by Johnny Depp, with the blades of scissors for hands. The film then settles back into the current day with Peg Boggs as portrayed by Dianne Wiest discovering the young man in a crumbling Gothic mansion while selling Avon cosmetics door-to-door.\n\nEdward is an artificially created man built by an inventor, portrayed by Vincent Price, who had died before giving his creation, the artificially intelligent Edward, hands. Pegs brings the harmless being home to meet her family, including Pegs husband Bill, teenage daughter Kim and young son Kevin as portrayed, respectively, by Alan Arkin, Winona Ryder and Robert Oliveri. Edward comes to love Kim romantically quickly after meeting her.\n\nThe Boggs family hosts a barbecue to introduce Edward to the neighborhood. While Edward is generally befriended by the neighborhood, religious fanatic Esmeralda and Kim’s boyfriend Jim, as portrayed by O-Lan Jones and Anthony Michael Hall prove themselves two notable exceptions. Finding himself unique among his neighbors, Scissorhands sets upon an increasingly ingratiating path of using the blades attached to his forearms to perform yardwork, animal grooming and hairstyling for women of the neighborhood.\n\nJoyce Monroe, as portrayed by Kathy Baker, toes the line between friend and enemy when at first she attempts to help Edward open a hair salon. Efforts included attempts to find a loan, locate a physical place for the establishment, and finally an unsuccessful attempt to seduce Scissorhands in exchange for her generosity. Monroe lies about Edward’s actions in the aftermath of the third point, lessening trust in Scissorhands and enabling drama the both discourages the future potential for the movie’s protagonist while also enabling those who actively dislike Edward to pursue their ends. It is in this space that the movie’s drama and romantic aspirations become fully realized in a particularly sweet manner for the grandmother sharing a story with her granddaughter from earlier in the movie.\n\nBeyond Tim Burton‘s writing contribution, additional screenwriting credit for Edward Scissorhands rests with Caroline Thompson. Having particularly been taken with romantic sensibility and sweetness for how the character of Edward Scissorhands is remembered within the movie, I grant Edward Scissorhands as directed by Tim Burton 4.0-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Saturday, April 20, 2024\n\nOne shall not trifle with the relationship between a boy and his dog. Tim Burton appreciated the story of Mary Shelley‘s 1881 book Frankenstein; or the Modern Prometheus, which was made into the James Whale movie Frankenstein (1931). Mix these three things together, and we are offered Burton‘s sensibility for story combined with an inclination for stop-motion animation to offer us the comedy drama Frankenweenie (2012).\n\nWith a handful of important relationships at the center of Frankenweenie, perhaps the one at the emotional center of the movie is the one of Victor Frankenstein and his bull terrier dog, Sparky. Charlie Tahan voices the boy scientist and filmmaker Victor Frankenstein. Frank Welker voices Sparky, his dog. Frankenstein is a bit quiet and awkward among his classmates, so his parents push him into playing baseball.\n\nIt was at the baseball game that Victor’s parents, Edward and Susan as voiced by Martin Short and Catherine O’Hara, respectively, see rejoice turn to sorrow when Victor hits a home run. The sorrow comes in, along with the homage and parody of the Frankenstein movie comes into play as Sparky meets his demise. In true Tim Burton style, what comes next is meant to celebrate the love for a dog in as comedically inappropriate a way as possible.\n\nIn the aftermath of Sparky’s death, Victor’s school happens to bring in a new science teacher named Mr. Rzykruski, as voiced by Martin Landau. Mr. Rzykruski demonstrates the effect of electricity on dead frogs to his classroom in New Holland. Victor is inspired to apply this concept on a deceased Sparky, succeeding in bringing his beloved pooch back to life. The occasion of a school science fair, Sparky’s escape from the Frankenstein’s attic, and the ignorance of Victor’s parents releases a drama that more fully brings in Victor’s schoolmates.\n\nClassmates central to the larger story of Victor, his classmates, Sparky, a cat named Mr. Whiskers and, finally, a pair of goldfish include Edgar ‘E’ Gore as voiced by Atticus Shaffer, Elsa Van Helsing as voiced by Winona Ryder, Weird Girl as voiced by Catherine O’Hara, Toshiaki as voiced by James Hiroyuki Liao, Bob as voiced by Robert Capron and Nassor, as voiced by Martin Short. Without heading too specifically into the way the story works out, the notions of competition, friendship, parenting and the blurry lines that can emerge in a PG rated comedy drama are appropriate for this animated cartoon.\n\nWriting credit for the screenplay that became Frankenweenie belongs to Leonard Ripps for the 1984 screenplay, Tim Burton for the idea and John August for this screenplay. The story is charming with its own quirky formula for who the heroes and villains are, without there being a refreshingly clear sense of the villain not being motivated by villainy. I give Frankenweenie as directed by Tim Burton 4.25-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Wednesday, October 12, 2022\n\nTim Burton directed the musical slasher movie Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007). The 1979 Tony Award winning musical Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street by Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler was adapted into the movie starring Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Alan Rickman.\n\nWe are introduced to the stories central plot when Benjamin Barker arrives in mid-19th century London, England with sailor Anthony Hope. We learn that Hope coaxed Barker back home from an illegitimate exile to Australia by a corrupt judge who had falsely sustained a conviction of Barker 15-years previous. Barker adopts the alias Sweeney Todd, resuming his life as a barber bent on the revenge for the wrongs done him at the hands of the corrupt judge. Jamie Campbell Bower portrayed sailor Anthony Hope.\n\nAlan Rickman portrayed the corrupt Judge Turpin, who we learn had physically amorous feelings for Lucy Barker, the wife of Benjamin Barker (aka Sweeney Todd) and the mother of the couple’s biological daughter, Johanna Barker. We learn that Turpin raped Lucy and took custody of Johanna in advance of exiling Benjamin. Lucy, we learn, had poisoned herself with arsenic. Jayne Wisener portrayed Johanna Barker. Laura Michelle Kelly portrayed Lucy Barker, aka Beggar Woman.\n\nAs Anthony Hope becomes enamored of Johanna without an awareness for any of this backstory, he is driven away from Judge Turpin’s ward by Turpin’s henchman, Beadle Bamford. Bamford, as portrayed by Timothy Spall, also offers some sideways assistance to the revenge motive of Benjamin Barker when he adjudicates a disagreement between Barker (as Sweeney Todd) and Adolfo Pirelli (aka Davy Collins). Pirelli, aka Collins, was portrayed by Sacha Baron Cohen.\n\nIt is through Pirelli that Barker meets Tobias ‘Toby’ Ragg. Ragg, Pirelli’s young assistant, helps to cement the relationship between Benjamin Barker and Nellie Lovett that makes the plot we see through the movie possible. Lovett runs the meat pie shop located below Benjamin Barker’s barbershop, where she sells the “worst pies in London.” Much of the background for Lucy Barker’s fate after Benjamin’s exile is learned through Lovett, as portrayed by Helena Bonham Carter. The details, connections, fates and flaws for all these characters truly are part of the charm that suggests watching the movie. Ed Sanders portrayed Tobias ‘Toby’ Ragg.\n\nThe film version of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street did undergo streamlining of sorts when compared to the overall story and the music included with the movie. The smaller movie emphasis on the relationship between Anthony Hope and Johanna Barker offered a notable example of this. The overall sense of the macabre combined with a distinctly Burton visual palette and storytelling gave the movie the quirky feeling of oddness that struck the strongest point of resonance for me. I give Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street as directed by Tim Burton 4-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Saturday, April 30, 2022\n\nTurning our attention today to a family comedy mixed with adventure, we look to the Tim Burton directed movie Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005). Based on the 1964 book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by British writer Roald Dahl, the movie by the same name also is predated by the movie Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971). Dahl received screenwriting credit for the 1971 film, though not the 2005 film direct by Burton.\n\nThe movie Charlie and the Chocolate Factory introduces the audience to the underprivileged Bucket family. Noah Taylor and Helena Bonham Carter portray the parents to young Charlie Bucket, as portrayed by Freddie Highmore. Four of Charlie’s grandparents lived with his parents and him, with a special connection for Charlie with his Grandpa Joe. David Kelly portrayed Grandpa Joe.\n\nBefore heading deeply into the nature of Charlie’s connection to a chocolate factory, the connection one Willy Wonka has with candy as an adult and into his childhood is introduced. Dr. Wilbur Wonka, dentist, takes a dim view of the confectionary arts for his one and only son. The vocational paths for father and son, as portrayed by Christopher Lee and Johnny Depp, gain voice in their early interactions. Years later, the circumstances for a contest with five prized tickets for entry is hatched.\n\nThe intrigue in for who goes to the chocolate factory stands well in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, functioning as the character introduction needed to learn of the five kids and their accompanying parent or grandparent. For those familiar with the 1971 movie, the sweetness of Charlie is slightly less drawn here. The playfulness rests a bit more with Willy Wonka at this early stage, with the feel of intrigue and charm updated with a more modern sensibility.\n\nThe hallmarks of the chocolate factory are presented with a directness that bespeaks actors defining themselves in their roles with distinctions from the precursor movie. The musical interludes and storytelling capture not so much an air of cautionary tale in parenting style or manner of behavior within the kids. The aim is more for wisecrack and explication of trouble for one Willy Wonka back to childhood. We get a clearer sense of the leading Oompa Loompa. Deep Roy portrayed multiple iterations of an Oompa Loompa in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\n\nThe payoff for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory rests on a handful of factors. First, this movie is more faithful to the source book than it is to the source movie. Second, the sensibility felt heavier and more adult in focusing less on the imaginary and aspirational and more on the notions of different and odd. Finally, getting into the familial for Willy Wonka was an unexpected turn for many, adding a dimension that I found had its own charm. I grant Charlie and the Chocolate Factory as directed by Tim Burton 3.75-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Saturday, November 13, 2021\n\nWith the oddness that has been the year 2020, new movie releases have been few and far between.

The Martin Scorsese concert goodbye The Last Waltz (1978) with The Band leads three other productions getting 3.75-stars.

The Lady Vanishes earned 4.0-stars from Matt Lynn Digital.\n\nMatt Lynn Digital also enjoyed sharing a review of Richard Linklater‘s Before Trilogy of movies. Blog friend Cobra reviewed Before Sunrise (1995), Before Sunset (2004) and Before Midnight (2013) in a single review. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy explore the notion of relationships a bit more fully and cleverly than often happens with any movie franchise.
