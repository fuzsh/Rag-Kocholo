        "text": "Thomas Jeffrey Hanks was born in Concord, California, to Janet Marylyn (Frager), a hospital worker, and Amos Mefford Hanks, an itinerant cook. His mother's family, originally surnamed \"Fraga\", was entirely Portuguese, while his father was of mostly English ancestry. Tom grew up in what he has called a \"fractured\" family. He moved around a great deal after his parents' divorce, living with a succession of step-families. No problems, no alcoholism - just a confused childhood. He has no acting experience in college and credits the fact that he could not get cast in a college play with actually starting his career. He went downtown, and auditioned for a community theater play, was invited by the director of that play to go to Cleveland, and there his acting career started.\n\nRon Howard was working on Splash: Jungfrau am Haken (1983), a fantasy-comedy about a mermaid who falls in love with a business executive. Howard considered Hanks for the role of the main character's wisecracking brother, which eventually went to John Candy. Instead, Hanks landed the lead role and the film went on to become a surprise box office success, grossing more than $69 million. After several flops and a moderate success with the comedy Schlappe Bullen beißen nicht (1987), Hanks' stature in the film industry rose. The broad success with the fantasy-comedy Big (1988) established him as a major Hollywood talent, both as a box office draw and within the film industry as an actor. For his performance in the film, Hanks earned his first Academy Award nomination as Best Actor.\n\nHanks climbed back to the top again with his portrayal of a washed-up baseball legend turned manager in Eine Klasse für sich (1992). Hanks has stated that his acting in earlier roles was not great, but that he subsequently improved. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Hanks noted his \"modern era of movie making ... because enough self-discovery has gone on ... My work has become less pretentiously fake and over the top\". This \"modern era\" began for Hanks, first with Schlaflos in Seattle (1993) and then with Philadelphia (1993). The former was a blockbuster success about a widower who finds true love over the radio airwaves. Richard Schickel of Time magazine called his performance \"charming\", and most critics agreed that Hanks' portrayal ensured him a place among the premier romantic-comedy stars of his generation.\n\nIn Philadelphia, he played a gay lawyer with AIDS who sues his firm for discrimination. Hanks lost 35 pounds and thinned his hair in order to appear sickly for the role. In a review for People, Leah Rozen stated, \"Above all, credit for Philadelphia's success belongs to Hanks, who makes sure that he plays a character, not a saint. He is flat-out terrific, giving a deeply felt, carefully nuanced performance that deserves an Oscar.\" Hanks won the 1993 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Philadelphia. During his acceptance speech, he revealed that his high school drama teacher Rawley Farnsworth and former classmate John Gilkerson, two people with whom he was close, were gay.\n\nHanks followed Philadelphia with the blockbuster Forrest Gump (1994) which grossed a worldwide total of over $600 million at the box office. Hanks remarked: \"When I read the script for Gump, I saw it as one of those kind of grand, hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feel ... some hope for their lot and their position in life ... I got that from the movies a hundred million times when I was a kid. I still do.\" Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his role in Forrest Gump, becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive Best Actor Oscars.\n\nHanks' next role - astronaut and commander Jim Lovell, in the docudrama Apollo 13 (1995) - reunited him with Ron Howard. Critics generally applauded the film and the performances of the entire cast, which included actors Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Kathleen Quinlan. The movie also earned nine Academy Award nominations, winning two. Later that year, Hanks starred in Disney/Pixar's computer-animated film Toy Story (1995), as the voice of Sheriff Woody. A year later, he made his directing debut with the musical comedy That Thing You Do! (1996) about the rise and fall of a 1960s pop group, also playing the role of a music producer.\n\nAs of 2022, Hanks is 66-years-old. He has never retired from acting, and has remained active in the film industry for more than four decades.\n\nTimothy Allen Dick was born on June 13, 1953, in Denver, Colorado, to Martha Katherine (Fox) and Gerald M. Dick. His father, a real estate salesman, was killed in a collision with a drunk driver while driving his family home from a University of Colorado football game, when Tim was eleven years old. His mother, a community service worker, remarried her high school sweetheart, an Episcopalian deacon, two years after Tim's father's death. He was raised with his many siblings and step-siblings. When Tim was young, his family moved to Birmingham, Michigan.\n\nIn high school, his favorite subject was shop, of course, and after high school, he attended Western Michigan University and graduated with a degree in Television Production in 1975. In 1978, he was arrested on drug charges and spent two years in jail. Upon his release, he had a new outlook on life and on a dare from a friend, started his comedy career at the Comedy Castle in Detroit. Later, he went on to do several cable specials, including, Comedy's Dirtiest Dozen (1988) and Tim Allen: Men Are Pigs (1990). In 1991, he became the star of his own hit television series on ABC called Hör' mal, wer da hämmert (1991). While continuing to film his television series throughout most of the 1990s, he starred in a string of blockbuster movies, including Santa Clause - Eine schöne Bescherung (1994), Toy Story (1995), Toy Story 2 (1999) and Galaxy Quest - Planlos durchs Weltall (1999). In August 1996, he developed and unveiled his own signature line of power tools, manufactured by Ryobi. On top of all that, he has his own racing team, Tim Allen/Saleen RRRRacing. In May 1999, he ended his series Hör' mal, wer da hämmert (1991) after eight seasons and in 2001, he filmed such movies as Jede Menge Ärger (2002) and Joe Jedermann (2001).\n\nAmerican character actor and playwright Wallace Shawn has one of those fun, delightfully mischievously gnomish faces made for entertaining. Though he got out of the acting starting gate rather late, he quickly excelled film and TV while managing to turn himself into comedy egghead or loser types. Woody Allen's slightly threatened character in the movie Manhattan (1979) amusingly describes Wallace's benign gent as \"a homunculus\", which may be a pretty fair description of this predominantly bald, wan, pucker-mouthed, butterball-framed, slightly lisping gent. Shawn made his movie debut at age 36 in Allen's heralded classic in a brief but telling scene as Diane Keaton's ex-husband.\n\nThe 5'2\" Jewish actor was born Wallace Michael Shawn into privilege on November 12, 1943 in New York City, as the son of Cecille (Lyon) (1906-2005), a journalist, and William Shawn (1907-1992), renowned and long-time editor of The New Yorker. His brother, Allen Shawn, went on to become a composer. Wallace was educated at both Harvard University, where he studied history, and Magdalen College, Oxford. Wallace initially taught English in India on a Fulbright scholarship, and then English, Latin and drama back in New York. However, a keen interest in writing and acting soon compelled him to leave his cushy position and pursue a stage career as both playwright and actor.\n\nDuring his distinguished career, Wallace churned out several plays. \"Our Late Night\", the first of his works to be performed, was awarded an off-Broadway Obie in 1975. This was followed by \"A Thought in Three Parts\" (1976);, \"The Mandrake\" (1977) (which he translated from the original Italian and made his acting debut), \"Marie and Bruce\" (1979), \"Aunt Dan and Lemon\" (1985) and \"The Fever,\" for which he received his second Obie for \"Best New Play\" during the 1990-91 season.\n\nA popular supporting player of comedy and the occasional drama, Shawn's assorted kooks, creeps, brainiacs and schmucks possessed both endearing and unappetizing qualities. He earned his best early notices partnered with theatre director/actor Andre Gregory in the unique Louis Malle-directed film Mein Essen mit André (1981). Shawn co-wrote the improvisatory, humanistic piece with brother Allan as the composer. Shawn and Gregory would collaborate again for Malle in another superb, original-concept film Vanya - 42. Straße (1994).\n\nAmong Shawn's offbeat films have been Bruce Paltrow's Der verführte Mann (1982); James Ivory's Die Damen aus Boston (1984); Stephen Frears' Das stürmische Leben des Joe Orton (1987); Rob Reiner's Die Braut des Prinzen (1987); Alan Rudolph's Wilde Jahre in Paris (1988) and Mrs. Parker und ihr lasterhafter Kreis (1994); and Paul Bartel's Luxus, Sex und Lotterleben (1989). He also appeared in several other Woody Allen offerings including Radio Days (1987), Schatten und Nebel (1991), Im Bann des Jade Skorpions (2001), Melinda und Melinda (2004) and the title role in Rifkin's Festival (2020).\n\nSince the 1990s, he has lent his vocal talents to a considerable number of animated pictures including Der Goofy Film (1995), Toy Story (1995) (and its sequels), Das Dschungelbuch - Mowglis Abenteuer (1998), Die Unglaublichen (2004), Himmel und Huhn (2005), Es war k'einmal im Märchenland (2006), Cats & Dogs - Die Rache der Kitty Kahlohr (2010) and Ein tierischer Zirkus (2017). TV voices have included Der rosarote Panther - Die neuen Folgen (1993), The Lionhearts (1998), Family Guy (1999), Kung Fu Panda - Legenden mit Fell und Fu (2011), The Stinky & Dirty Show (2015) and The Bug Diaries (2019).\n\nMillennium films graced with Shawn's participation include Southland Tales (2006), Kit Kittredge - Ein amerikanisches Mädchen (2008), Jack and the Beanstalk (2009), The Speed of Thought (2011) and Vamps - Dating mit Biss (2012). He co-starred as Halvard Solness and wrote the screen adaptation for Ibsen's classic play A Master Builder (2013) co-starring Julie Hagerty, and went on to appear in Don Peyote (2014), Maggies Plan (2015), Robo-Dog (2015), Drawing Home (2016), Another Kind of Wedding (2017), Book Club - Das Beste kommt noch (2018) and Marriage Story (2019).\n\nOver the decades, Shawn has scurried about effortlessly with a number of television guest appearances including \"Taxi,\" \"Homicide: Life on the Streets,\" \"Ally McBeal,\" \"Law & Order: Criminal Intent,\" \"Sex and the City,\" \"Desperate Housewives,\" \"The Daily Show,\" \"The 7D,\" \"Life in Pieces,\" \"The Good Fight,\" \"Mr. Robot\" and \"Search Party. He has also drummed up a few recurring roles for himself in the process, including Die Bill Cosby Show (1984), Murphy Brown (1988), Clueless: Die wichtigen dinge des lebens (1996) (based on the hit film Clueless - Was sonst! (1995), revisiting his teacher role), Murphy Brown (1988), Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993), Crossing Jordan: Pathologin mit Profil (2001), The L Word: Wenn Frauen Frauen lieben (2004), Gossip Girl (2007), Good Wife (2009), Mozart in the Jungle (2014), and, more recently, as Dr. Sturgis in the comedy Young Sheldon (2017).\n\nAnnie Potts is an American film, television, and stage actress. She is known for her roles in popular 1980s films such as Ghostbusters - Die Geisterjäger (1984) and Pretty in Pink (1986). She made her debut on the big screen in 1978 in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer comedy film California Highway (1978), with Mark Hamill, for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe. In 2017 she was cast to portray Meemaw in Young Sheldon (2017), a spin-off of the CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory (2007). Potts also voiced voiced Bo Peep in the animated films Toy Story (1995), Toy Story 2 (1999) and A Toy Story: Alles hört auf kein Kommando (2019).\n\nInterested in stage and film at an early age, Annie Potts attended Stephens College in Missouri, enrolling in the theater studies course, followed by graduate work in California. At the age of 20, she married her college sweetheart, Steven Hartley. Only a short time later, she and her husband were in serious automobile accident in Sumner, Washington -- their Volkswagen bus was demolished by two drivers who were drag racing. Steve lost a leg, and Annie had multiple fractures (resulting in a traumatic arthritis that still persists). Early roles were primarily in television, such as Black Market Baby (1977), but her presence moved up with an appearance in the mega-hit Ghostbusters - Die Geisterjäger (1984), and then she hit the big time with a seven-year stint as one of the stars of Sugarbaker's: Mann muss nicht sein (1986). A brief period in Love & War (1992) ended with the cancellation of the show, about which she remains resentful.\n\nPossessing leading man good looks and undeniable charm, Erik von Detten has proven himself to be an actor of unquestionable talent. Having amassed an impressive resume of feature film and television credits running the gamut from comedy to drama, the young actor has had a lively career.\n\nErik was born in San Diego, California, to Susan (Farber), a photographer, and Volker von Detten. His father is a German immigrant and his American mother is of English and Russian Jewish descent. He was raised in Southern California in a family of three sisters, which was a far different experience from that of his Complete Savages (2004) character. At the age of nine, Erik accompanied his sister to an agent meeting and was signed on the spot. Soon after, he landed his first professional role, that of a series regular on NBC's Zeit der Sehnsucht (1965), which he considers his training ground. After a two-year stint on the show, von Detten continued to amass an impressive list of film and television credits throughout his teenage years.\n\nVon Detten's television credits include series regular roles on ABC's half-hour comedy, Complete Savages (2004) (Produced by Mel Gibson), ABC's Dinotopia (2002), ABC's Odd Man Out (1999) and The Disney Channel's Fionas Website (1999). He has guest-starred on many popular television series, including ABC's Meine wilden Töchter (2002) in which he played the roommate to David Spade's character; an Emmy Award-winning episode of NBC's Emergency Room: Die Notaufnahme (1994) where he played a kid trapped in a storm drain; and NBC's Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999), in the role of a preppie murderer. He also appeared as a guest contestant on ABC's Episode #3.1 (2003).\n\nHis diverse telefilm credits include the lead role in the hit rollerblading movie, Soulskater - Vier Freunde auf Rollen (1998), which was one of the first Disney Channel Original Movies; Replacing Dad - Eine Familie ohne Vater (1999) with Mary McDonnell; a starring role opposite Robert Hays in The Family Channel's Und täglich grüßt der Weihnachtsmann (1996); CBS' A Stranger to Love (1996) with Beau Bridges; the lead character of Danny in Disney's remake of Die Flucht zum Hexenberg (1995) for ABC; CBS' A Season of Hope (1995) opposite JoBeth Williams; NBC's \"In the Line of Duty: Kidnapped\" with Dabney Coleman and Timothy Busfield; and the CBS drama Bitteres Blut (1994), in which he played the young son to Keith Carradine's character.\n\nVon Detten's feature credits include leading roles in Disney's Plötzlich Prinzessin! (2001) where he played the object of Anne Hathaway's affections; and Universal's Beaver ist los! (1997) in which he played Wally Cleaver opposite Christopher McDonald and Janine Turner. He also lent his voice to Disney's and Pixar's highly successful Toy Story (1995) in which he played Sid, the next-door neighbor toy torturer. Additionally, he has voiced characters for Disney's animated feature Tarzan (1999) and the television series Tarzan (2001), the animated television series Disneys Große Pause (1997) and the feature versions Disneys Große Pause - Der Weihnachtswunderfilm (2001) and Disneys grosse Pause - Die geheime Mission (2001).\n\nAside from acting, von Detten's interests include classical piano, landscape photography and self-portraiture, and spending time on his classic 1969 sailboat which he bought at the age of twelve and has fully restored. During his free time, von Detten also enjoys hiking, surfing, tennis and rollerblading on the Venice Boardwalk with his Dalmation, Miles. He is also a Big Brother through the Big Brothers Big Sisters mentoring program."
