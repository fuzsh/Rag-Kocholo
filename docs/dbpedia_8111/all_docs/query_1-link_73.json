        "text": "Joanne Sharkey has been charged with murder and concealing the birth of a child in connection with the death of Baby Callum.\n\nCallum, named after the Callands district of Warrington where he was found, died on March 14 1998.\n\nDiscovered at around 11am wrapped in a black plastic bin bag in woodland near Gulliver’s World, he would have only been a few hours old when he died, having been born weighing just 7lb 8oz.\n\nOne of Cheshire’s longest-running open murder investigations, Cheshire Police revealed in October last year that it had arrested two people – a man and a woman – two months earlier in July in connection to Callum’s death.\n\nBoth were released on bail, with Sharkey rearrested on Monday, before being charged with murder and remanded in custody.\n\nThe man who was arrested as part of the investigation was released without charge, and the force has confirmed that officers are not looking for anyone else in relation to the death.\n\nSharkey, aged 54 and of Denham Close in Croxteth, Liverpool, made a first appearance in relation to criminal proceedings in the investigation before Warrington Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday.\n\nShe spoke only to confirm her name, date of birth and address, with magistrates further remanding her in custody and sending the case to the crown court.\n\nSharkey appeared before Liverpool Crown Court this morning, Thursday, via video link from HM Prison Styal, wearing a black jumper and with her brown hair up.\n\nShe was again asked to confirm her full name and date of birth, with Christopher Taylor, representing the prosecution, confirming to the court that today would be a bail determination hearing and to set procedural dates.\n\n“There is no formal application for bail, and your lordship can remand the defendant in custody,” he said, adding that remanding in custody was ‘appropriate’.\n\nHe also confirmed that the court was ready to set a provisional trial date, as well as a plea and trial preparation hearing date.\n\n“Speaking to the listing officer, we understand the date of the week commencing January 14 is available,” Mr Taylor continued.\n\n“I ask the court to set that date. The current estimate is two weeks at this stage.”\n\nThis was in agreement with Rebecca Feletti, representing Sharkey and appearing in court remotely.\n\nJudge Menary set the trial date for January 14, 2025, and set a plea and trial preparation hearing date for July 25.\n\nAdjourning proceedings, he said: “Joanne Sharkey, this has been a fairly formal hearing today, but we have set a number of dates for things to happen, in particular for a trial if there is to be a trial in this matter.\n\n“Your next hearing is July 25 unless there is to be a further bail application next week. Before that can happen, more material needs to be made available to the court.\n\n“In the meantime therefore, you must remain in custody. That concludes the hearing, you may go with the officer.”\n\nAfter Sharkey was charged, DI Hannah Friend, of Cheshire Police's major crime review team, said: \"I understand that this is an extremely emotional case which has attracted a lot of attention over the past 26 years, however I would ask people not to speculate.\n\n\"Criminal proceedings are now active against Joanne Sharkey and she has the right to a fair trial.\"\n\nResidents rallied following the disturbing discovery, raising more than £800 to pay for a headstone engraved with a shepherd.\n\nThis was to be used when Callum was buried at Warrington Cemetery on Manchester Road more than four months later.\n\nIt was inscribed: “Baby Callum, precious child of God. Laid to rest July 27, 1998. With love, from the people of Warrington.”"
