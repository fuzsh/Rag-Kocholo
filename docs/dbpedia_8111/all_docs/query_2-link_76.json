        "text": "British Arts Minister Estelle Morris announced the formation of the forum which is designed to help live music flourish in England and Wales.\n\nFigures from the music industry, the Arts Council, local authorities, small venue owners and the Government will sit on the body for two years.\n\nIt will spend six months examining the current state of the live scene, working with venue bosses and promoters to find out more about the music they put on and their audiences.\n\nThe forum will also look at barriers to live music, before turning its attentions to what improvements can be made and making a series of recommendations.\n\nMinisters committed themselves to looking into live music during the passage of the Licensing Act 2003, making sure grass roots musicians saw tangible benefits.\n\nSharkey notched up a string of hits with The Undertones starting with Teenage Kicks in 1978 – still veteran DJ John Peel’s favourite track.\n\nHe went solo in the Eighties, getting his only number one in 1985 before moving behind the scenes and working for record labels.\n\nSharkey worked with the UK government as a member of the Radio Authority until it was replaced recently by Ofcom.\n\nHe said today: “Most musicians will tell you there is nothing else like live performance, and they would be right.\n\n“For performers and audiences alike, those few wonderful moments of direct, personal contact can provide a lifetime of memories.\n\n“I am delighted to have been asked to play a part in this unique initiative, one which we hope will help develop, encourage and promote live music.”\n\nMs Morris said: “A vibrant live music scene is a vital element of our cultural life.\n\n“It gives grass roots musicians the opportunity to do what they love to do and gives us the opportunity to enjoy live performances while fostering future talent.”\n\nBritish Musicians’ Union general secretary John Smith said: “I believe that the Live Music Forum will play a vital role in the development of the live performance of music in the next couple of years.\n\n“The Musicians’ Union looks forward to working with the DCMS (Department of Culture, Media and Sport) in order to ensure that, not just our members, but the whole of society benefits from the thrill, joy and excitement of live music performance.”"
