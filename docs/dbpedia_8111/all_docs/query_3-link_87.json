        "text": "Who this is…\n\nProducer/DJ Sharkey from DC, this is his debut album via Babygrande. Part of the group the Crownsayers (signed to Elektra), and The Spark (who has back the likes of Wyclef and Black Eyed Peas).\n\nWhat this is…\n\n“Sharkey’s Machine” is just about everything. The quasi-instrumental album dabbles in about just about every major genre you can think of; Hip-hop, jazz, turntablism, electronica, funk, and rock to name a few. Not only is it very diverse, but it is very well done. It features some excellent guest spots from Cannibal Ox, Jean Grae, The Pharcyde, Grand Puba, Cherrywine (Digable Planets), Zooks and The Graykid.\n\nWhy you should listen…\n\n“Fuzz” f. Cannibal Ox\n\n“Summer in the City” f. Jean Grae\n\n“Slo-Mo In The Grotto”\n\n“Little Cabin Song” f. The Zooks\n\n“A Typical Day Is Sunny Washington, DC” f. The Graykid\n\n“Here We Are”\n\n“Meltdown” f. The Zooks & The Graykid\n\n“Song 20”\n\nAll dope songs that should please the ears and get the head nodding. Definitely original and definitely worth (and needing), multiple spins.\n\nWhy you shouldn’t listen…\n\nNot everything works (“Skateboarder’s Blues,” “Something’s Gotta Give”), and others kind-of-work and kind-of-don’t (“Phone Sex,” “Ice Water,” “Snobird”). None of this is bad, and shouldn’t prevent you from picking up the album. But they are certainly not on par with some of the other selections.\n\nAll in all…\n\nA really good debut featuring some nice genre-bending that should get recognition across various scenes. I actually think the alternative/rock stuff is the strongest material on the album, save the songs with Jean and Cann Ox (which are too dope)."
