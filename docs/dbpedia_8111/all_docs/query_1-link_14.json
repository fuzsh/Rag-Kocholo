        "text": "Career\n\nSharkey initially became known as an MC at \"hardcore rave\" events in Great Britain in 1993. In 1995, he moved into music production, teaming up with DJ Hixxy to release the track \"Toytown\", which proved one of the most significant signature tunes of the UK's happy hardcore style in the 1990s. This led both Sharkey and Hixxy to being signed by the UK's leading dance music label, React Music, and the pair released \"Bonkers\", the first in a series of albums which has become the best-selling hardcore compilation series of all time. \"Revolutions\", a release on React, reached 53 in the UK charts, and Sharkey consequently released the album \"Hard Life\" in 1998.\n\nSharkey also produced mixes for Bonkers 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17. Volumes 4 and 5 achieved silver sales status in the UK with Bonkers 3 reaching gold status. In 2001 Sharkey made his first appearance on the eurodance compilation Dancemania series, at Speed 6, along with Hixxy. He was also invited to mix on BBC Radio 1 in 2003, performing John Peel's Essential Mix.\n\nRetirement\n\nIn January 2011, Sharkey announced his retirement from Hardcore and Freeform. He completed a final tour, playing in various countries around the world, and then officially retired in September 2011. While Sharkey has previously stated that he has completely retired, his current status is under speculation. There is at least 1 instance of DJ Sharkey performing in 2015."
