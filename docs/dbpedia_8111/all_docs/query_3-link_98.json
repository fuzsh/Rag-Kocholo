Not only is this next DJ a legendary producer and radio presenter, but he‚Äôs also known to be quite a ‚ÄúWicked MC‚Äù üòâ We‚Äôre absolutely fizzing to be hosting one of UK hardcore‚Äôs pioneers and absolute LEGENDS‚Ä¶.. DJ SHARKEY\n\nSharkey is of course a household name when it comes to hardcore, hard dance and rave. His name is synonymous with the infamous Bonkers series (that he co-founded with Hixxy), which went on to become the UK‚Äôs best-selling hardcore compilation series of all time.\n\nKnown for his high octane sets, he covers the spectrum of the harder styles right through hardstyle, hard trance, happy hardcore, freeform and gabber. His lyrical genius makes him one of the few MCs who has risen to the epitaph of being the voice of the UK hardcore scene.\n\nAlongside Sharkey, we also have another UK harder styles producer on Al Storm‚Äôs ‚Äú24/7 Hardcore‚Äù label. Please welcome for his first time in NZ‚Ä¶. DJ MONSTER.\n\n‚òÖ ‚òÖ SUPPORTING LINEUP ‚òÖ ‚òÖ\n\n‚û§ Firefly\n\n‚û§ Flek C\n\n‚û§ Orphic\n\n‚û§ Shane-O\n\n‚òÖ ‚òÖ TICKETS ‚òÖ ‚òÖ\n\n$25+bf Earlybirds\n\n$30+bf First Release\n\n$35+bf Final Release\n\nhttps://www.ticketfairy.com/event/sharkey"
