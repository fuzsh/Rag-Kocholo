        "meta_description": "RINSED // Celebrating two decades of the harder styles\n\nAfter an overwhelming response to Steve Hill at Hide, Rinsed is stepping up its 20 years celebration. Not only is this next DJ a legendary producer and radio presenter, but he's also known to be quite a \"Wicked MC\" ;) We're absolutely fizzing to be hosting one of UK hardcore's pioneers and absolute LEGENDS..... DJ SHARKEY\n\nSharkey is of course a household name when it comes to harcore, hard dance and rave. His name is synonymous with the infamous Bonkers series (which he co-founded with Hixxy), which went on to become the UK’s best-selling hardcore compilation series of all time.\n\nKnown for his high octane sets, he covers the spectrum of the harder styles right through hardstyle, hard trance, happy hardcore, freeform and gabber. His lyrical genius makes him one of the few MCs who has risen to the epitaph of being the voice of the UK hardcore scene.\n\nAlongside Sharkey we also have another UK harder styles producer on Al Storm's \"24/7 Hardcore\" label. Please welcome for his first time in NZ.... DJ MONSTER.\n\nâ â SUPPORTING LINEUP â â\nâ¤ Firefly\nâ¤ Flek C\nâ¤ Orphic\nâ¤ Shane-O",
