        "text": "Feargal Sharkey is well-known for being the lead singer of power-pop/proto-punk band The Undertones, best-known for “Teenage Kicks”, the favorite song of legendary DJ John Peel.\n\nAfter The Undertones broke up, Sharkey pursued a solo career making a very different type of music. His solo records, which came out in the mid-80’s and early-90’s, took influence from New Wave and AOR and generally involved more elaborate arrangements than the stripped-down sound of his old band. These songs took advantage of his unique voice, which is wavering, accented, and somewhat high-pitched.\n\nSeeing Sharkey live is interesting because it seems like many people are unaware of the fact he was in The Undertones and only associate him with his solo career or his status as someone with quite a bit of clout in the British music industry. Sharkey’s live show involves the presence of quite a few people on stage, as a result of the maximalist arrangements of some of his songs. He tends to sing with backup singers to contrast his somewhat unusual voice.\n\nThe crowd mostly consists of older people, as Sharkey’s popularity as a singer mostly came in the 80’s, and most of his material is quite ballad-like, which appeals to that demographic.\n\nSharkey’s music certainly took a odd left-turn after The Undertones, but he is worth seeing because of his unusual but distinctive voice and interesting musical arrangements.\n\nRead more"
