        "text": "Back in the midst of time (circa '92) the Hardcore rave scene divided into a Dark Side, which developed into Jungle, and a Happy side which disappeared back underground with a flurry of breakbeat activity only to re-emerge defiantly as Happy Hardcore. Meanwhile across the European mainland Hardcore had become chart material which although ignored in England found favour with Scottish and Irish dance fans who have always liked a bit of fast stomping Euro Techno. Then suddenly the British DJ's start playing in Scotland following the fusion in sound between the Scottish-Dutch Happy Gabba hybrid and the new improved harder Happy Hardcore sound and before you can say \"Hardcore will never die\" Technohead's \"I Wanna Be A Hippy\" single sells 300,000 copies in the UK. Now React, who always strive to deliver the finest contemporary collections have compiled \"Bonkers\" 35 of the most bangin' 4-Beat monster dub plates selected and mixed by DJ Hixxy and MC Sharkey, recognised as the youngest and freshest talents on the Happy Hardcore scene.\n\nBonkers reads like a who's who of Happy Hardcore scene and features the hot plates from Dougal, Brisk, Slipmatt, Sy, Seduction, Eruption, Force & Styles, DJ Scott Brown, Marc Smith, Druid, Vinylgroover, & Billy Bunter. For the label conscious the vinyl come courtesy of Essential Platinum, United Dance Recordings, UK Dance, Kniteforce, Evolution, Inferno, Impact, Universal, Stormtrooper, Quosh and Clubscene. Following his ascendance over the last couple of years to the Hardcore DJ elite, DJ Hixxy has conquered Britain, Scotland, Germany, Switzerland and the other place where they like it nuts, Australia. Based in Portsmouth, and aged only 20, Hixxy runs probably the most influential label on the scene, Essential Platinum, and is widely regarded as top dog on the South coast.\n\nMC Sharkey was recently voted No.1 MC on the rave scene, and although he's never one to turn down a night of coaxing the whistle posse, he will now only be holding court at large events as his DJ'ing consumes most of the weekend. Hailing from Plymouth Sharkey now lives in Wokingham, Berkshire and he has set up the Bonkers record label, which is based in Mansfield. Together Hixxy & Sharkey have produced the biggest single yet on the 4-beat scene, \"Toytown\" (included on this site) is huge - according to DJ Magazine \"You may not have heard it yet but at your local rave barn it's bigger than Goldie and Josh Wink mixing back to back\"."
