        "text": "Feargal Sharkey, the singer with punk band The Undertones and 1980s solo artist, has rounded on the British music industry for failing to encourage and nurture new talent.\n\nIn an interview with The Sunday Telegraph to mark his 60th birthday on Monday, the vocalist, who found fame with songs including Teenage Kicks and My Perfect Cousin, said the music business is so obsessed with marketing and online promotions that it is stifling creativity.\n\nAnd, the Northern Irish musician who for many years worked as a music executive, claims The Undertones would not have made it in today’s industry, adding that songwriters are likely to make more money “flipping burgers” than getting paid for writing a well-crafted song.\n\nExplaining how the Derry band he joined as a teenager in 1975 relied on the simple but effective marketing strategy of sending the “good song”, Teenage Kicks, to radio DJ John Peel, he said real talent was getting now lost in the “gazillion” songs on the internet.\n\n“In the modern world we think because you can make a noise that that noise has some sort of intellectual, creative or artistic depth and integrity attached to it. It hasn’t - it’s often a noise,” he said from his North West London home.\n\n“For those who have some innate talent and ability, it’s become more difficult because there is a much greater volume of noise and static that they have to push their way through to get noticed. That’s made life way more difficult for them.”\n\nSharkey, who had international success and a UK Number One in 1985 with “A Good Heart”, added: “Young artists think they have to develop their marketing campaign, have a podcast, facebook and YouTube presence. When I talk to young artists, I say, ‘Why are you worrying about all of that?’\n\n“How do you have a long, successful, productive and creative career in the music industry? The answer is if you write utterly fantastic music.\n\n“So I say, ‘Stop worrying about your facebook page and go and write a better song.’”\n\nHe said “digital utopians” who claimed the internet would “democratise music” had been proven woefully wrong, in part because music streaming services pay so little in royalties.\n\n“A songwriter now will be better off working in a hamburger bar on a minimum wage because they will probably make more money.\n\n“Streaming is killing the ability for songwriters and artists to make a living. And, that may impact on their desire and capability to make music.”\n\nExplaining how most computers have a built-in recording studio program offering everyone the chance to record music, he said: “In many ways this utopian world we were told would give us a level playing field where we could record our own songs has not turned out that way.\n\n“Throughout the 1970’s and early 1980’s all kinds of record companies were signing up a huge range of artists. So, the Undertones got a chance. But, most major labels are no longer in a position or willing to take that kind of risk and make that kind of investment to develop cutting edge artists exploring the fringes of what is possible creatively.”\n\nHowever, Sharkey believes the UK remains the most likely country where the next great musical talent is likely to be found.\n\n“I’m an eternal optimist and think there’s some 17-year-old somewhere about to create the most incredible piece of music anyone has ever heard. And, if any country on earth can deliver that, it probably is the United Kingdom.\n\n“I just hope that among all the other noise and static out there that when that moment comes there is enough space so we can identify that unique talent and ability and give it the opportunity and support and nurturing that a band like the Undertones had in 1978.”"
