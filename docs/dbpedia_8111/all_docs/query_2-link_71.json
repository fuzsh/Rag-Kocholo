        "text": "They were formed in Londonderry in the 1970s - a city deeply affected by Northern Ireland's Troubles, yet few bands can put a smile on your face as quickly as The Undertones.\n\nAs the conflict raged on at their doorstep, a group of friends came together to offer the youth of Derry and Northern Ireland a brief but welcome respite from the daily doom and gloom.\n\nTo this day, they remain the most successful band to have emerged from Derry and one of the most successful to ever come from Northern Ireland.\n\nAn hour-long documentary, Here Comes The Summer: The Story Of The Undertones, on BBC One NI on Monday, 21 January at 10.35pm, charts the story of the band from when it first formed around a campfire in 1974 until 1983, when the members decided to go their separate ways.\n\nCombining archive footage with new interviews with band members Michael Bradley, Billy Doherty and brothers John O'Neill and Damian O'Neill, the documentary tells how a group of teenagers beat the odds to become an improbable pop phenomenon whose hits still resonate today.\n\nFriends Michael and Billy and brothers John and Vincent O'Neill formed their band in 1974 and invited classmate and Derry Feis regular Feargal Sharkey to join as singer.\n\nThe Undertones were born and the lads would spend most of their time over the next couple of years in the O'Neill household rehearsing and listening to everything from British R&B, American rock 'n' roll, glam rock, garage bands and new, emerging punk music from the US and Britain.\n\nAfter a couple of years, Vincent O'Neill left the band to concentrate on his studies and was replaced by his brother Damian and by 1977, The Undertones had a set of finely rehearsed covers and became regulars at Derry's alternative nightspot The Casbah, where they developed a loyal following.\n\nWhen they started writing their own songs, a mutual friend suggested they contact Belfast music impresario Terri Hooley to record some tracks.\n\nIn 1978, the group made the trip to Belfast for Hooley's Battle of Bands competition and he was so impressed that he invited them to record their debut EP the following day.\n\nThat EP was Teenage Kicks and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nThe band soon found a fan in legendary BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel and were then signed to the major record label Sire Records by Seymour Stein, the man responsible for signing Madonna a few years later.\n\nThe Undertones experienced a meteoric rise to fame and their music reached the masses.\n\nThough they came from a conflict-torn city at an extraordinary time, their music was not about politics or protests.\n\nInstead, they created their own brand of infectious punk pop and sang adolescent anthems about ordinary yet universal themes such as teenage angst, finding a girlfriend and having annoyingly flawless relatives.\n\nSingles such as Teenage Kicks, Jimmy Jimmy and My Perfect Cousin soared up the charts and the band made numerous appearances on shows such as Top Of The Pops and The Old Grey Whistle Test."
