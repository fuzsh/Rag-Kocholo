        "text": "Police say Joanne Sharkey, from West Derby in Liverpool, will appear in court tomorrow, Tuesday, to face the charge.\n\nAs reported last year, officers arrested a man and a woman last July on suspicion of the murder of Baby Callum, who was found in Callands in woodland in March 1998.\n\nThe pair were subsequently released on bail, but the woman, aged 54, was rearrested today, Monday.\n\nThis evening, Cheshire Police has confirmed that the Crown Prosecution Service has authorised detectives to charge her with murder.\n\nShe will appear before Warrington Magistrates' Court in the morning, having been remanded in custody.\n\nREAD> All we know about Baby Callum as woman charged in murder probe\n\nDI Hannah Friend, of Cheshire Police’s Major Crime Review Team, said: “I understand that this is an extremely emotional case which has attracted a lot of attention over the past 26 years, however I would ask people not to speculate.\n\n“Criminal proceedings are now active against Joanne Sharkey, and she has the right to a fair trial.\n\n“It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.”\n\nThe man who was arrested as part of the investigation has since been released without charge.\n\nThe force has confirmed that officers are not looking for anyone else in relation to the death.\n\nIn the late morning of March 14 1998, the body of a baby boy was found in wooded areas near to Gulliver’s World Theme Park, wrapped in a black plastic bin bag.\n\nHe was named after the Callands area of Warrington in which he was found.\n\nBaby Callum was born weighing just 7lb8oz hours before his body was discovered by a dog walker at 11am.\n\nHe would have only been a few hours old when he died.\n\nResidents rallied following the disturbing discovery, raising funds to pay for a headstone engraved with a shepherd.\n\nThis was used when Callum was buried at Warrington Cemetery on Manchester Road more than four months later."
