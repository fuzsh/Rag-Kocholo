        "text": "JOHN PEEL has been remembered at the SHOCKWAVES NME AWARDS (February 17) – with a one-off category named in his honour, as well as being recognised for his contribution to new music.\n\nThe Undertones’ singer Feargal Sharkey presented Peel’s wife Sheila and son William with The Special Award For Lifelong Service To New Music this evening – recognising his lifetime’s work as a broadcaster, mainly on Radio 1.\n\nThe entire audience were united in a standing ovation for Peel, with many people visibly moved to tears.\n\nSharkey agreed to present the award, as The Undertones song ’Teenage Kicks’ was the DJ’s favourite song of all time.\n\nSharkey said that the first time Peel played ‘Teenage Kicks’ on air, it changed his life.\n\nPeel died of a heart attack aged 65 last year.\n\nThe broadcasting legend had a career spanning over 40 years, was on holiday in Peru when he was taken ill.\n\nPeel was born in Heswall near Chester and started his radio career in Dallas, Texas.\n\nThroughout the 1960s he worked at a number of radio stations across the US, before returning to Radio London in 1967.\n\nPeel consistently championed new music, and in 1994 was given the NME Godlike Genius award for his services to music.\n\nA second award, the John Peel award for innovation was given to recent NME cover stars The Others, for guerrilla gigging. To celebrate, the band did an unannounced show in the pub next door to the venue."
