        "text": "The daybook of W. John Harris, doctor of Homeopathic Medicine in St. Louis, provides information from 1882 to 1923. The name and birth date of many St. Louis children is included. The list often includes the weight of the baby, the number of children born to the mother, and the time of birth. Since a large number of these records do not specify the child’s name, they are sorted by the father’s name.\n\nThis information was published in the 1996 St. Louis Genealogical Society Quarterly, volume 29, number 2, pages 43–46; number 3, pages 89–92; number 4, pages 113–116; and volume 30, number 1, pages 9–13.\n\nLast modified: 05-Jul-2016 23:30"
