        "text": "DJ, MC, Radio presenter, Producer and Musician are some of the role’s which Sharkey is not only accomplished at, but a master of. UK legend is another name which Jon could boast if he wasn’t so god damn modest!\n\nSharkey is of course a household name when it comes to Harcore/Harddance/Rave. His name is synonymous with the famous Bonkers compilation, were he A&R’d and mixed his own disc on 15 outings of the UK’s best-selling and most famous hardcore compilation series of all time.\n\nLike Sharkey’s multifaceted skill set, his musical range when Djing is as dynamic, ever evolving and always at the forefront of the underground. Sharkey sets can be diverse or focused encompassing Breakbeat, Hardtrance, Oldskool Happy Hardcore, Freeform and Hardcore Techno.\n\nOn the MIC hosting Sharkey gravitates to The harder or trance orientated sides of the rave spectrum (Hardstyle, Hardtrance, Hardcore Techno or multigenre sets ).\n\nNo matter which role or music faceat Sharkey is booked for you can expect a high octane, exciting performance which will make a lasting impression on ravers"
