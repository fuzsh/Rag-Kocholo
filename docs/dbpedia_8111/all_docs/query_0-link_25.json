        "text": "Universal Energy - 2020\n\nHaving built a great producer/singer relationship with Jasmine Knight over many years, once lockdown dropped I was gifted time at my commercial studio to explore a concept I'd always envisaged for a long time - a vocal freeform album. The seed was planted through Kickstarter and within 2 days, the album was fully funded so I knuckled down and got to work with Jasmine. I'm extremely proud of the works - especially the Drum & Bass remixes that Jasmine insisted I produced as I quickly realized that is a difficult genre to produce. The album was released as a limited run of 300 CDs and digital download featuring 2 x DJ mixes, 16 new singles and 10 D&B remixes.\n\nCD 1: DJ Kevin Energy Freeform DJ Set\n\n1) Universal Energy (VIP Intro Mix)\n\n2) Take Me Down\n\n3) Supernature - Stone Cold Killer - (Kevin Energy Remix)\n\n4) The Belonging - A\n\n5) Eternal reality\n\n6) Kid Freeform 2000 - featuring DJ Randomized Mind and Cat Knight\n\n7) Aya\n\n8) Drifting Higher\n\n9) Open Your Mind - featuring K Complex\n\n10) Let Me Be Your Freeform Fantasy\n\n11) Insanity\n\n12) Hearts On Fire - featuring Paul Hardcore\n\n13) Invincible\n\n14) Why Can’t We See G\n\n15) Have Me\n\n16) Electrify\n\nInside Right\n\nCD 2: DJ Kevin Energy Drum & Bass DJ Set\n\n1) Universal Energy (Drum & Bass Mix)\n\n2) Why Can’t We See (Drum & Bass Mix)\n\n3) Have Me (Drum & Bass Mix)\n\n4) Take Me Down (Drum & Bass Mix)\n\n5) Aya (Drum & Bass Mix)\n\n6) The Belonging (Drum & Bass Mix)\n\n7) Invincible (Drum & Bass Mix)\n\n8) Electrify (Drum & Bass Mix)\n\n9) Insanity (Drum & Bass Mix)\n\n10) Drifting Higher (Drum & Bass Mix)\n\nMy Rave - 2011\n\nAfter 18 solid years of rave production and DJing, I took some time out from things to re-build my health and find a reliable career.

This was an NEC album project designed from the ground up by the great team we had working together back then. The album was a great success for both myself and S3rl who I'm pleased to still be collaborating with today. The CD's have sold out and the digital version remains on sale.\n\nKevin Energy Mix\n\n01 Kevin Energy and Douglas - Chop Suey meets FM-200 (Kevin Energy Mega Mix)\n\n02 Nick 235 and Solution Feat.

I can remember working hard to include as many of the established and new NEC artists at the time to offer up the best mix possible for the CD series. Masif Hardcore was only released on CD and has never had a digital release. You can hear my full DJ mix right here and all of the singles from my mix have been released on the NEC labels over the years so you can easily find digital copies of them all.\n\nSongs\n\n1\n\nDo What Ya Like (Hyperbass mix)\n\n3:28\n\n2\n\nRoll the Track (Gammer mix)\n\n4:33\n\n3\n\nAlways on My Mind\n\nDMO\n\n4:19\n\n4\n\nHardcore Hustler (Weaver mix)\n\n5:07\n\n5\n\nTurn Up the Music (Breeze & Styles mix)\n\n3:03\n\n6\n\nLive Wired\n\n3:34\n\n7\n\nMy Intention (feat.

When I was asked to also feature on the 17th compilation I jumped at the opportunity and worked with Sharkey intently to create the best possible compilation of freeform and hardcore that we could get our hands on. Resist music who released the album went bankrupt a few years after releasing the album but somehow the album remains for sale. Here I am offering you mine and Sharkey's mix for streaming so turn it up and enjoy 🙂\n\nDisc: 1\n\nDisc: 2\n\nDisc: 3\n\nFreeformation: Wise Up Get Stupid! - 2007\n\nThis was a really fun album to compile and mix. Freeformation was the name of the London-based rave night founded by myself and Sharkey. Some of our best raving memories are from Freeformation raves where we unearthed the spirit of 'Wise Up Get Stupid' to bring the fun back to raves and put DJs on the same level as ravers. This CD compilation album was released by Resist music who went bankrupt shortly after which is a shame as no money was ever received for all of the hard work! The good news for you all is that you can listen to all 3 mixes from start to finish right here.\n\nCD 1\n\n1) Together (Karl Future Remix) - Dancelordz\n\n2) Seven Wonders - Double Dekka\n\n3) Believe Me - Nervous Testpilot\n\n4) Numb Hardcore - Flame\n\n5) I May Be Dreaming - Arkitech Vs Double Dekka\n\n6) B.T.S - Eryk Orpheus & Mark Ashley\n\n7) Dreamspell - Firefly\n\n8) Stereo Sonic - Darwin Obie & Mr. E\n\n9) Like A Maniac - Sharkey Vs CLSM\n\n10) Future Hero - Flame\n\n11) Psymbiosis (Four To The Floor Mix) - Ephexis Vs Seventy-7\n\n12) The Retreat - DJ Delta Vs K Complex\n\n13) Never Say Die - Sharkey & Arkitech\n\n14) Innocence - Weaver & Antix\n\n15) Rippin Up (Kevin Energy Remix) - Gammer\n\n16) Study My Bounce - Freeza\n\n17) Never Lose Your Hardcore - Rampant & Dizzyvibe\n\n18) Suck My Rock (Ethos & Stormtrooper Remix) - Kevin Energy & K Complex\n\n19) This Is The Place - Kevin Energy & Gammer\n\n20) Nan Chaun - Ephexis\n\n21) Letting Go - Arkitech\n\n22) Wise Up Get Stupid (Exclusive Album Edit) - Sharkey Vs Kevin Energy\n\nCD 2\n\n1) Ecoplex - Marc Smith\n\n2) Crazy Styles - Kevin Energy & Blackout\n\n3) The Baptism - Sharkey, Kevin Energy & K Complex\n\n4) Take Me Up - Kevin Energy\n\n5) Distanord - Eclipse & Sharkey\n\n6) In Deep Trouble - Kevin Energy\n\n7) Freaky Fazes - Kevin Energy\n\n8) Lotek (Sharkey Remix) - Sharkey\n\n9) Crescendos Of Ecstasy - Kevin Energy\n\n10) Chemical Warefare - Cynista Vs Safe 'n' Sound\n\n11) Roll With This - Kevin Energy\n\n12) Say It Again - Andy Vinal & DJ Devotion\n\n13) Future Dimensions - Kevin Energy\n\n14) The Future - Fade\n\n15) Mind Launch - Eclipse & Sharkey\n\n16) Insane Asylum - Helix & Fury\n\n17) Overdose - Kevin Energy ft.

Thunder Downunder went on to help spread the reputation of the NEC in Australia which has always had a thriving rave scene. I've dug out my mix so you can enjoy it here.\n\nElevate: The Next Level - 2007\n\nFollowing on from the success of the first Elevate CD album, I joined forces once more with hard dance legend Phil York to collaborate on a new offering of hard dance productions. Once again we followed the format of a CD each featuring a DJ mix of all of the productions backed up by a run of vinyl singles of the releases. The album is not available in a digital format anywhere, however, I'm happy to offer you my DJ mix to enjoy right here. Turn it up and get rocking!\n\nCD 1 Mixed By Phil York\n\nDark by Design vs Section 8 - Elevation (Intro mix)\n\nSection 8 vs. Shaun M – Command & Conquer\n\nNFX- No Go Go – (Alex Kidd vs. Dark by Design remix)\n\nJason Cortez- No Other Way\n\nTechnikal & Marc French- Mad & Confused (Guyver remix)\n\nExpose- Seven Cities (Phil York & The Coalition remix)\n\nFlashheads- Who Wins\n\nPhil York & Nick Rowland- Revolver\n\nPhil York & Technikal- Rock & Rollin’\n\nMasif Dj’s – Everyday (Phil York vs. Dark by Design mix)\n\nJason Cortez- Finally\n\nPhil York- Intellect\n\nMDA & Spherical – Dutch Courage\n\nMasif Dj’s- Wasted (Steve Hill vs. Guyver mix)\n\nTechnikal presents JK- Crank It Up\n\nPhil York & Colin Barratt- Knowledge Is Power\n\nCD 2 Mixed By Kevin Energy:\n\nGreg Brookman – Hypersonic\n\nKevin Energy vs K Complex – Hands Up (Kevin Energy’s Hard Trance Edit)\n\nColin Barratt - Knowledge Is Power (Kevin Energy Remix)\n\nSQ & Fallout – Karma\n\nGreg Brookman vs Kevin Energy – Execute\n\nKevin Energy - Get Hard\n\nMDA & Spherical vs Chrysus - Phantasm\n\nKevin Energy vs Phil York – We Can Hear It\n\nPhil Reynolds vs Kevin Energy – Pounding Senses (Technikal Remix)\n\nRainbow 6 vs Kevin Energy – Make Ya Move\n\nChrysus vs Kevin Energy – Unleashed\n\nRainbow 6 vs Kevin Energy – What The Fu*k?\n\nK90 – Red Snapper (SQ Warp Bass Mix)\n\nMark Richardson – One Message\n\nAMS – Underground Sound\n\nMatt Lee vs Kevin Energy – Shake Your Body\n\n17. Arkitech – Everyone Corrupt (Beat Goes Boom Mix)\n\nHardcore Heaven 4 - 2006\n\nContinuing the success of the Hardcore Heaven compilation series, I was always on a mission to better each of my offerings. This 4th release is the favorite of mine from all 4 of the album mixes that I recorded. The album was only licensed as a CD release and the company that released it went bankrupt so it's very confusing as to why it's somehow on sale as a digital album. I'd like you all to enjoy my mix so I have added it here for you to blast again and again.\n\nHardcore Heaven 3 - 2006\n\n2006 was a very busy year for me with the NEC being in full flow, Freeformation taking off and a jam-packed DJ schedule. I was thrilled to still be a vital part of the Hardcore Heaven compilation CD series where I always tried my best to include the full spectrum of hardcore and freeform in my mixes.\n\nThe record company behind the compilation has closed down so this album is no longer available anywhere, however, I'm pleased to offer you my DJ mix in high quality from start to finish right here.\n\nElevate - 2006\n\nElevate was a new album concept born out of the NEC and a desire to spread our hard dance sound further north in the UK matched with a desire of DJ Phil York to spread his hard dance sound further south. Both Phil and I were extremely motivated and active DJs and producers in that era and we both shared an equal passion and drive for releasing and distributing music. We conjured up a plan to release a double CD album, a run of 12\" single vinyls, and a UK-wide tour filling clubs with an Elevate tour. The whole project was a big success featuring a wide range of established and up-and-coming producers on the album. The CDs have since sold out, however, you can stream my whole DJ set right here and the majority of the singles are available digitally or in the NEC re-mastered bundles.\n\nCD1: Phil York\n\nDark by Design vs Section 8 - Elevation (Intro mix)\n\nSection 8 vs. Shaun M – Command & Conquer\n\nNFX- No Go Go – (Alex Kidd vs. Dark by Design remix)\n\nJason Cortez- No Other Way\n\nTechnikal & Marc French- Mad & Confused (Guyver remix)\n\nExpose- Seven Cities (Phil York & The Coalition remix)\n\nFlashheads- Who Wins\n\nPhil York & Nick Rowland- Revolver\n\nPhil York & Technikal- Rock & Rollin’\n\nMasif Dj’s – Everyday (Phil York vs. Dark by Design mix)\n\nJason Cortez- Finally\n\nPhil York- Intellect\n\nMDA & Spherical – Dutch Courage\n\nMasif Dj’s- Wasted (Steve Hill vs. Guyver mix)\n\nTechnikal presents JK- Crank It Up\n\nPhil York & Colin Barratt- Knowledge Is Power\n\nCD 2: Kevin Energy\n\nGreg Brookman – Hypersonic\n\nKevin Energy vs K Complex – Hands Up (Kevin Energy’s Hard Trance Edit)\n\nColin Barratt - Knowledge Is Power (Kevin Energy Remix)\n\nSQ & Fallout – Karma\n\nGreg Brookman vs Kevin Energy – Execute\n\nKevin Energy - Get Hard\n\nMDA & Spherical vs Chrysus - Phantasm\n\nKevin Energy vs Phil York – We Can Hear It\n\nPhil Reynolds vs Kevin Energy – Pounding Senses (Technikal Remix)\n\nRainbow 6 vs Kevin Energy – Make Ya Move\n\nChrysus vs Kevin Energy – Unleashed\n\nRainbow 6 vs Kevin Energy – What The Fu*k?\n\nK90 – Red Snapper (SQ Warp Bass Mix)\n\nMark Richardson – One Message\n\nAMS – Underground Sound\n\nMatt Lee vs Kevin Energy – Shake Your Body\n\nArkitech – Everyone Corrupt (Beat Goes Boom Mix)\n\nHardcore Heaven 2 - 2005\n\nI was surprised and humbled by the success of the first Hardcore Heaven album series. The amount of feedback I received from my CD motivated me to make the follow-up bigger & better so I embarked on a mission to include as many different producers as possible. I remember people being surprised at how many tracks I could fit into a CD mix - don't forget this was still the era of vinyl mixing so there was no such thing as special edits or syncing. Boy do I miss that era of DJing 😉 Anyway.... the album is not available digitally, however, I have offered you my DJ mix in high quality here to stream. Enjoy.\n\nHardcore Heaven 1 - 2005\n\nIn 2005 Hardcore Heaven events were MASSIVE! When the brand decided to launch its own album series I was super excited to be invited to offer up the more diverse sounds of the NEC on the third CD. My brief was to bridge the barrier between the cheesy hardcore and the more underground sounds so I got to work compiling the best-unreleased music of that era to offer up a CD full of unheard exciting music. The whole album was a massive success which would later follow up with more in the series. This was a CD release only so there is no digital release, however, I have offered you my DJ mix here to enjoy time and time again.\n\n1-01 Asa & S1 Featuring Lou Lou (2)– Makin Me Wanna Dance (Sy & Unknown VIP Remix)\n\nRemix – Sy & Unknown\n\n1-02 CLSM Featuring Stefan B*– Drifting Away (VIP Remix)\n\n1-03 Sy & Unknown– Out Of Your Mind\n\n1-04 Scott Brown– Bassline Of The Century\n\n1-05 Sy & Unknown– Dance With Me\n\n1-06 DJ Robbo (Geos Crew)*– Raise Your Hands\n\n1-07 Gavin G & Dan Rolla* Feat.

It came at a time when the NEC was extremely productive in supplying a constant flow of music to the scene. The plan was to raise awareness to the music through a double mix compilation with a CD each from Kevin Energy and DJ Silver highlighting some of the untapped talents that were bursting through the scene at the time. The album was really well received globally. I'm happy to offer you my DJ mix smashed on in the good days on Vinyl mixing right here to enjoy time and time again.\n\n1.

Back in 2003, I was invited to DJ in Japan with Sharkey so we could record an album 100% live at the event. I can remember being amazed at how much energy the ravers had! It was a small but completely packed buzzing club and I'm very grateful to everybody involved in making this album come to life.\n\n1) Ready Or Not - Duncan Oatham\n\n2) Locked Inside Your Mind (Breeze 'n' Styles Remix) - DJ Dirt\n\n3) Get Fucked - Kaos & Ethos\n\n4) I'm Feeling (Scott Brown & DJ Evil Remix) - Lia\n\n5) Party Zone - Ethos & Dan Devotion\n\n6) Crazy Styles (Vinal & Devotion Remix) - Kevin Energy & Blackout\n\n7) Wipe Away - Kevin Energy & Just Rich\n\n8) Phat As Fuck - DJ Impact\n\n9) Fuckin' With The Frequency - Kevin Energy\n\n10) The Future - DJ Fade\n\n11) Blow The Roof - RLD\n\n12) Freedom - Social Outcast Ft.

After a jam-packed worldwide tour, the final task to undertake was to produce and release a farewell album. 'My Rave' journeys from Harddance to Freeform and Hardcore across two DJ mixes. Mix one features 16 original songs while disk 2 features a hand-picked selection of my own productions. The compilation was released as a limited-edition CD and digital download, however, the CDs have since sold out.\n\n1: DJ Vinal And K Complex – Andromeda (Kevin Energy Remix)\n\n2: Kevin Energy, Sharkey And K Complex –The Baptism (Kevin Energy Remix)\n\n3: Lou Cypher Project – Plague\n\n4: Spencer Freeland – At The Hippodrome\n\n5: Kevin Energy And DJ Odyssey – It's Rockin'\n\n6: System 6 Southside – Turbulence\n\n7: Kevin Energy – Roll With This\n\n8: Daniel Ro – Subterrain\n\n9: Mark Ashley – Frenetic\n\n10: Kevin Energy – Crescendo's Of Ecstasy\n\n11: Duncan Oatham – Rock The Disco\n\n12: Lost Soul – Plazma\n\n13: Two's Company – Parallel Minds\n\n14: Kevin Energy And Just Rich – Wanna Be\n\n15: Sharkey, Kevin Energy, Just Rich* And K Complex – Visions Of Infinity (Kevin Energy N Sharkey Remix)\n\n200% Nu Energy - 2002\n\nThe follow-up from 100% Nu Energy featured a DJ mix from myself and Sharkey B2B. This was a great era with the Nu Energy Collective Live PA performing BPM-building sets for Frantic, Pendragon, and Logic. It was so cool bridging the gap between two scenes with music that keeps people dancing harder, faster, and longer! The CD has been sold out for many years but like all my albums, I'm offering you the audio to stream time and time again for free right here.\n\n1: Safe n Sound – Mantra\n\n2: The Preacher And John Paul – Power\n\n3: Kevin Energy – Beat For Me\n\n4: Safe n Sound – Lost Souls\n\n5: K Complex – Battle Star\n\n6: Kevin Energy And DJ S4 – Evil Returns\n\n7: AG Systems – Unda Ground\n\n8: Rez – Rez Out\n\n9: Kevin Energy, Sharkey & K Complex – The Baptism\n\n10: The Omen – Bust It (Fast Mix)\n\n11: Cynista v's Safe n Sound – Cascading Minds\n\n12: Safe n Sound – Synergise\n\n13: Kevin Energy, Sharkey And K Complex –Turn Up The Heat\n\n14: Just Rich, Kevin Energy And Safe n Sound – Visions Of Infinity\n\n100% Nu Energy - 2001\n\nHere's a blast from the past - my 100% Nu Energy CD album from 2001 where I crossed the boundaries of hard dance and freeform in a blistering BPM-building DJ mix that just gets on getting faster. This album concept was proposed by Ola at Just Another Label who had links to the HMV stores in that era. His idea was to create a super cheap album series at £1.99 retail price each so we could get as many CDs sold to get the music known far and wide. The plan worked perfectly with hundreds of new fans discovering the NEC through the CD series. Here you can hear the whole album in full time and time again.\n\nChemical Generation Vol. 2 - 1999\n\nThe first Chemical Generation album was really well received and bought a lot of attention to the underground sounds of hardcore and hard trance of that era. the second CD continued to offer up new music on a low-budget CD compilation available in all the HMV stores to bring attention to the music and artists.\n\nCheck out my DJ mix b2b with Sharkey from the album series right here.\n\nChemical Generation - 1999\n\nThe Chemical Generation CD album was a concept born from the Stage 1000 Music Company aka Just Another Label. This was the era when the Freeform sound was developing and there started to be an uprising in the underground sound of hardcore as opposed to the everyday cheese. Chemical Generation was a budget CD album stocked in all the major HMV stores designed to bring attention to the music, artists, and labels that were daring to be bold and different at that time.

The CD featured a series of shorter mixes from DJ Slam, Jimmy J, Vinyl Groover, DJ Fury, Brisk, and myself. My job was to represent the freeform sounds that were a new concept in that era. Check out my mix right here which at the time was full of exclusive new songs.\n\nDJ Brisk Mix (Happy-Core)38:521.1Brisk & Devastate–Time 2 Move1.2Brisk & Vinyl Groover*–Don't Give A Damn (Justin Time Remix)\n\nRemix – Justin Time\n\n1.3Stealth–Flower Needs The Rain1.4Bang*–Hyperspace (Brisk Mix)\n\nRemix – Brisk\n\n1.5Robbie Long & Devastate–Flip Flop Flava1.6Bang*–Give Me A Reason1.7Northern Lights–Love Of My Life (Exclusive Mix)1.8Trixxy–Sunrise1.9Supernova–Step OffDJ Vinyl Groover Mix (Techno-Core)37:411.10Hyperdrive (2)–More Lovin (Vinylgroover Remix)\n\nRemix – Vinylgroover\n\n1.11Unique–Feelin' Fine (Force & Styles Remix)\n\nRemix – Force & Styles\n\n1.12Techno Phobic–The Rave Theme1.13Vinylgroover & Trixxy–40 Miles1.14Select–Ray Of Light1.15VGT–VGT 21.16Sy & Unknown–Head In The Clouds1.17Vinylgroover–Rainbows (Vinylgroover Mix)\n\nRemix – Vinylgroover\n\n1.18Vinylgroover & Trixxy–Seven WaysDJ Fury Mix (Trance-Core)37:412.1Citadel Of Kaos–Feed The System2.2Helix Brand*–Quango2.3The Player (5)–Life Aint No Game2.4Helix & Tekno Dred–Tribalistic2.5Helix–Deep Incision2.6Charley T*–Cookin' Up2.7DJ Fury–Comin' Up For Air2.8DJ Fury–Dallas2.9Cortex–Movin' OnDJ Energy Mix (Trance-Core)39:152.10Mark Smith* & Sharkey–It's All Just Hardcore2.11Blackout (4) & Energy*–Crazy Styles2.12DJ Energy*–Take Me Up2.13Taz & Elements*–Shape Shifter2.14Sharkey & Eclipse (18)–Mind Launch2.15Helix–Now Control2.16Tekno Dred & Ad Man–A Voice Spoke To Me (Exclusive Mix)2.17DJ Energy*–Acid Dawn2.18Blackout (4) & Energy*–7 Deadly StringsDJ Jimmy J (Triple J) Mix (Classic-Core)47:453.1Force & Styles–Heart Of Gold3.2DJ DNA Meets Dougal*–Hornz3.3Love Nation–Positive (Ad Man Remix)\n\nRemix – Ad Man\n\n3.4JDS*–Higher Love (Slipmatt Remix)\n\nRemix – Slipmatt\n\n3.5JJ*–99 Red Balloons3.6Triple J–Follow The Sun3.7Ramos, Supreme & Sunset Regime–Gotta Believe (Remix)3.8DJ Ham, Demo* & Justin Time–The Big Spill3.9JJ*–Do You Believe3.10Jimmy J & Crul T*–Take Me AwayDJ Slam Mix (Classic-Core)23:033.11Ramos & Supreme–The Journey3.12DJ Vibes–Music So Wonderful3.13SMD–SMD 1A3.14DJ Slam–Looking Into The Light3.15Q Project–Champion Sound3.16Jimmy J & Crul T*–Six Days\n\nCredits\n\nHardcore Innovators - 1998\n\nThis was the first major record compilation I had been asked to compile and mix. It came at a time when I was first branching out into the more forward-thinking and underground sounds of hardcore trying to inject some excitement into my DJ sets at a time when everything else was starting to sound the same. I rallied together as many of the producers that also felt the same to be able to compile something that covered a range of emotions to take the listener on a journey. The album was really well received and helped to bring a lot of attention to the labels that would soon join forces to soon-to-become the Nu Energy Collective.

Back then, our underground music had been coined as 'Trancecore' however it was felt by many that it was not purely trance-based, and associating the word trance with it limited what could be done musically. Everybody involved in the underground movement of that era felt that we were trying to free the boundaries and structures that had somebody made many songs of that era sound the same. We all wanted to have the freedom to make some songs dark, some happy, some euphoric, some breakbeat, some hard, and some progressive. When we were approached by Dream magazine to have an article and front cover CD representing our movement, we collectively called ourselves 'The Freformers' as a headline for the magazine. the name seemed to stick and went on to become the brand of our music being called 'Freeform'\n\nI'm still sourcing the audio from this compilation.\n\n1.1Tekno Dred Alliance*–The Promised Land1.2Arcade Of Sound–Musicology1.3Steve Johnson–Genesis (Helix Remix)\n\nRemix – Helix\n\n1.4Fury*–Coming Up For Air1.5Energy*–Anticlockwise1.6Tekno Dred Alliance*–Endorphia2.1Energy*–Hustler2.2Eclipse (18)–Devastator2.3Energy*–Warped Reality2.4Marc Smith–Encounters2.5Sharkey & Eclipse (18)–The Warning3.1Fury*–De Sensitize3.2Sharkey–The Awakening3.3Sharkey & Eclipse (18)–Mind Launch3.4Sharkey–Product Of Society3.5Eclipse (18)–Ultraworld 5"
