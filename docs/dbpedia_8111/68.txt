One of the leading producer/DJ/MCs in the hardcore techno scene of the 1990s, Sharkey helmed four volumes of the successful compilation series Now We're Totally Bonkers! (with major mate Hixxy) and made the move to a solo career in 1998 with HardLife. Born in West Germany, Sharkey entered the British rave scene as a combination DJ and MC during the early '90s. Though commercial success soon forced rave underground, he became one of the few recognizable names in the scene later in the decade with the 1994 happy hardcore anthem "Toytown" (recorded with Hixxy for his Essential Platinum Records). The single forced major labels to take notice of the much-maligned happy hardcore scene, and the first volume in the Bonkers! sold tens of thousands of copies upon its release in 1996. Sharkey recorded singles as himself for Club Kinetic and Bonkers before signing a solo contract with React in 1997. Charting across trance and breakbeat techno as well as happy hardcore, HardLife was released in mid-1998.
