        "text": "\"There will not be a peace treaty, it will be a treaty of derogate of Armenia. It is similar to the Alexandropoul Pact, which was also a peace treaty,\" Archbishop Michael Ajapahyan, leader of the Diocese of Shirak, told us. He thinks that Azerbaijan is teaching us how to behave in order not to attack us. In case of peace, the parties take steps forward, but Azerbaijan does not show such an attitude.\n\n\"Aliyev teaches us how we should have behaved in 1994, he shows that in 1994, when you won, you should have treated us that way: you didn't behave, you didn't impose a peace agreement on us then, you were afraid, you subdued, you didn't liberate Nakhichevan , You did not liberate Gandzak, you stood and did not force us to peace, you did not force us to capitulate, now we will force you to capitulate\" said the Bishop.\n\nThe leader of the Shirak Diocese considers Artsakh to be lost and calls the statements about returning to Artsakh a sham: the more we returned to Mush and Ardahan, the more we returned to Kars, the more we will return to Artsakh. \"We have lost our cowardice, our phobias, and Azerbaijan is non-mythical, Azerbaijan also teaches how to be non-mythical. It was those Armenians who mocked each other's non-mythicism, but mock the Azerbaijanis' non-mythicism, why don't you mock them? A great country, a country bigger than Armenia, let it give up even two inches to Armenia, it does not give up. Why did they mock the Armenian non-mythists, let them mock the Azerbaijani non-mythists. He who is non-mythical will live in this region,\" says the Bishop.\n\nReferring to the Armenian-Turkish relations, the leader of the Shirak Diocese emphasizes that, regardless of the circumstances, whether the Turkish factor is good or bad, the Turkish element is a threat to Armenian existence. However, this does not mean that the Turk should be eliminated, it means to make the borders of the motherland impregnable and ensure our own security so that we can continue to exist after a thousand years. And with the \"peace agreement\" Armenia will become an unfenced garden, an unclassified territory.\n\n\"Being an unfenced garden, one must enter and reap the fruit, because that garden does not even have a guard, if it does have a guard, the guard does not have a club in his hand. And, in the end, a day will come when the dominant element in Armenia will not be Armenian, we won't even realize it,\" said Srbazan."
