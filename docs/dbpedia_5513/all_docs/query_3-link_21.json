        "text": "The historic Holy Cross Church, located in Gyumri, Armenia, was consecrated by His Holiness Karekin II, Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of All Armenians, on September 27. The church was reconstructed and renovated due to the efforts of the mayor of Gyumri, Vardan Ghoukassian, and the Ghoukassian family. The church was built in 1857 and originally consecrated in 1864. It initially had been named the Church of the Holy Mother of God, yet several years later was renamed as Holy Cross.\n\nAt the entrance to the city, His Holiness and his entourage were met and welcomed by His Grace Bishop Mikael Ajapahian, Primate of the Diocese of Shirak; Roman Manoukian, the Governor of the Region of Shirak; and Vardan Ghoukassian, the Mayor of Gyumri. The Pontifical procession entered the church under the singing of the \"Hrashapar\" hymn, and the consecration service commenced. The Catholicos and the Bishops accompanying him consecrated the Holy Altar, the columns, and the baptistery of the Church with Holy Chrism (Muron).\n\nFollowing the service, His Holiness addressed words of congratulation and appreciation to the benefactors of the Church and the faithful of Gyumri. \"The doors of God's mercy and hope have again been opened before Armenia, and especially before you, the faithful flock of Shirak. From day to day, the traces of the destructive earthquake which brought so much pain, grief and mourning to our nation, are disappearing . . . Today this Church of the Holy Cross is also reconstructed and renovated, magnificent and glorious. We exhort you, our beloved flock of Gyumri, to keep your loyalty to God and your ancestors' sacred faith unshaken, to keep your churches filled, and to fortify their walls and stones through your faith and prayers,\" said His Holiness in his message.\n\nHis Holiness presented a chalice for Holy Communion to the church as a gift from the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin. The Pontiff of All Armenians was accompanied by Archbishop Grigoris Bouniatian, Primate of the Armenian Diocese of the Ukraine; Bishop Paren Avedikian of the Mother See; and members of the Brotherhood of Holy Etchmiadzin. Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Andranik Margarian, and representatives of regional and municipal authorities also attended the service of consecration."
