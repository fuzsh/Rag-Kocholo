        "text": "Gyumri (Armenian: Գյումրի) is the second largest city in the Armenian SSR, Soviet Union and the capital of the Shirak Province in the northwestern part of the country. By the end of the 19th century, when the city was known as Alexandropol, it was one of the largest cities of Russian-ruled Eastern Armenia with a population similar to that of Yerevan. It was renamed to Leninakan during the pre-WW2 Soviet period. The city's population grew above 200,000 prior to the 1988 Spitak earthquake, when it was devastated. As of the 2011 census, the city had a population of 128,319, down from 158,765 reported at the 2001 census.\n\nGyumri is the seat of the Diocese of Shirak of the Armenian Apostolic Church.\n\nGeography[]\n\nGyumri is 78 miles (125.53 kilometers) north of the capital Yerevan at the central part of the Shirak plateau. It has an approximate height of 5,090 feet (1,551.4 meters) above sea level, the high altitude line being 4,900 feet (1,493.5 meters). The Akhurian River passes through the western suburbs. The Shirak plateau is surrounded with the Pambak Mountains from the east and Aragats volcanic range from the south. The city of Gyumri is 122 miles (196.34 kilometers) away from the Black Sea. The surrounding lands near the city are rich in tufa, basalt and clay.\n\nClimate[]\n\nGyumri has a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb), characterized by cold and snowy winters where the minimum temperature in extreme spells can plummet to −41 °C or −41.8 °F.
