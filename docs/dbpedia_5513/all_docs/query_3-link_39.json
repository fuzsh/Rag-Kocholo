        "text": "The enormous humanitarian crisis caused by the territorial conflict that erupted in September 2020 on the border between southern Armenia and Azerbaijan continues today, months after a peace agreement was signed in November last year. This region, called Artsakh in the Armenian language, which had a population of 140,000, suffered repeated attacks which targeted civilians. The conflict, which lasted six weeks, claimed the lives of 1,700 Armenians and displaced 100,000 others who fled to areas further north. Among these refugees, an estimated 35,000 people from Artsakh have now returned to their land, including residents of Shushi and Qarin Tak village (Shushi region). Families from the towns of Hadrut, Qashatakh and Shahumian had to flee their homes leaving all their possessions behind. Their homes have either been destroyed or are now located in the territories belonging to Azerbaijan.\n\nUrgent humanitarian relief for displaced families from Shirak and Gegarkhunik\n\nThis project will support displaced families from areas which are now under Azerbaijani rule. Urgent support is needed for 500 households who are either displaced families from Nagorno-Karabakh, host families or local Armenian families with one or more family members who have been killed or injured in the war. The project activities include: – House repairs for 500 homes for displaced persons, hosts and locals.- Productive capital (sewing machines, livestock, etc.) for 400 displaced families- Reintegration support and assistance for 600 people: displaced persons, hosts, locals.\n\nBudget: £86,251 (out of a total budget of £684,741 of which 80% is already funded).\n\nGive to FACE\n\nYour donation will enable us, through our partnerships on the ground, to deliver quick and effective support to local communities across Armenia.\n\nYour contribution will make a huge difference to many lives.\n\nYou will bring a message of love, solidarity and hope to our brothers and sisters in Armenia.\n\nNow more than ever they need our support"
