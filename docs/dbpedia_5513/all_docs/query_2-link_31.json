The guests will be introduced to the history of memorable events in Gyumri, the famous people of Gyumri in the 18th-19th centuries, the everyday life of Gyumri residents, their culture and healthcare in this period.\n\nChurch of the Holy Archangel Michael\n\nThe church is named after the canonized Archangel Michael. The church is built of local black stone. It is called \"Plplan Jam\" because of its shiny pewter dome. The church was consecrated in 1886 by Archbishop Poghos of the Greek-Russian Orthodox Church in Georgia. After the establishment of Soviet power in 1920, the chapel was closed.\n\nBlack Fortress\n\nThis fortress is a monument in Gyumri, Shirak region of RA. It is a castle built in 1834. As in the case of the underground structures of Ani, underground roads were built to the fortress leading from the fortress to the present-day monument of the Mother of Armenia, the Red Fortress. It is included in the list of immovable monuments of history and culture of Gyumri.\n\nThe Old Theater Building\n\nThe old white building of the Gyumri Theater, formerly called the \"People's House,\" is located at the beginning of Gyumri's Central Park. This 150-year-old building was built at the expense of the residents of Alexandropol. Over time it became the main venue of folk events. Armen Tigranian's first opera \"Anush\" was first performed here in 1912.\n\nThe building of the dowry\n\nAs the people say, \"The House of Dowry\" was built in 1910 by the rich Drambyan from Alexandropol. He originally built the building as a house to give a dowry to his daughter Jahavir, who married Gegham Margar Ter-Petrosian, the first political leader of Alexandropol. The house has two floors and has a gorgeous staircase leading from the first floor to the first floor.\n\nAvetik Isahakyan House-Museum\n\nOn October 29, 1975, on the 100th anniversary of the great Master's birth, the house of Isahakyan became a memorial museum. In the early 1990s the museum building was completely demolished to build a new building in the same architectural style, but construction was halted soon after, for more than a decade. The restoration commissioned by the Shirak province administration began in earnest in the spring of 2002, opening its hospitable doors to all.\n\nHovhannes Shiraz Memorial Museum\n\nThe house was dedicated to the great Armenian poet Hovhannes Shiraz and was built in July of 1983. However, the poet did not live in this house. He died in March 1984. The building was built in 1886 and was the home of a wealthy merchant.\n\nThe church \"Yot Verk\" of St. Astvatsatsin\n\nThe Church of St. Astvatsatsin or the Church of the Seven Ranks is located in Gyumri, Shirak province, RA. It was built in 1874-1886 and is located in the central square of the city, now Vardanants. The church is the Diocese of Shirak.

In 2014, the church was restored to its appearance. In 2014. June 21, Garegin II consecrated the crosses of the church and placed them on the dome and bell tower.\n\nPark of Copies of Destroyed Armenian Khachkars in Jugha\n\nThe park was built in 2010 near the Amenaprkich Church. The cross-stones are typical of medieval Armenian Christian art.
