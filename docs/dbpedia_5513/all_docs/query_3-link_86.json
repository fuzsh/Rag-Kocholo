        "text": "She's right, but what's done is done. The people running Armenia right now are determined to break away from Russia and are willing to sacrifice people and land to achieve it. Much of the electorate is fine with it too. It was a nice couple of centuries, give or take a few massacres and genocide. The US has been preparing for this moment for decades (Yerevan's US embassy is the second largest in the world after Baghdad).\n\nA lot of Cold Warriors from the diaspora have also been brought in to oversee the transition. And by transition I mean they're going to try and do as much damage to Russia–Armenia relations that it's nigh-irreperable for succeeding regimes. There's literally a pair of Canadian sibling Redditors of Armenian and Irish extraction who have been brought in and are apologists for the pro-Western regime. Both are very pro-Ukraine and pro-Israel. Surprised? These people see home as Los Angeles and Montreal but are supposed to have Armenia's best interests in mind.\n\nAnd when you invite the West, you get these people (location is \"Astrakhan/Yerevan/Jerusalem\") who for some reason decide to come in and lecture you about being nice to minorities (except in places like Gaza, I guess). They are joined (and some part of) a liberal Russian minority of draft-dodgers who have established themselves there since the SMO. Ask yourself why these people would move to tiny, vulnerable Armenia instead of oil-rich Azerbaijan, probably the most Zionist \"Muslim\" country in the world?\n\nSo the regime announced recently that they were going to make even more concessions to Azerbaijan in the form of surrendering villages under Armenian control. The announced territories fall within the Tavush province of Armenia, which prompted the Primate (Archbishop) of the Tavush Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church to organize peaceful protests. He has been supported by the Primate (also an Archbishop) of the Shirak Diocese, which is a province bordering modern-day Turkey.\n\nThere are statements that these announcements and actions have the blessing of the Holy See of Echmiadzin:\n\nThe Mother See and Catholicos of All Armenians Garegin II are standing by us. Archbishop Bagrat said this after the march arrived in Tsovagyugh village of Gegharkunik Province.\n\n“The Mother See is always with us. We do not act without the blessing of His Holiness. The Supreme Patriarch himself is our father, the one who blesses us and guides us,” Archbishop Bagrat said.\n\nWestern-funded media sounds a bit concerned:\n\nHere's a profile of the Archbishop:\n\nNot sure how this will evolve politically, but an interesting development whereby the Church has officially gotten involved, represented by high-ranking clergy."
