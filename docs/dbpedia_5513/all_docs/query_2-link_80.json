        "text": "If you’re traveling through Armenia one of the most important sites you have to visit is to the Vargharshapat region. Located 30 kilometers to the west of the capital, Yerevan, lays the cultural and spiritual center of Armenia. The region is also known as Etchmiadzin and translates as “the place where the Only Begotten descended”. This area is the Armenian equivalent to the Vatican and is the source of the Armenian identity. My colleagues at work were kind enough to arrange a day trip to historic sites and this place was definitely the highlight.\n\nThe Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin is huge complex and consists of the first state built cathedral in the world, various residences, museums, a vestry, a seminary, and a library. The entire area is well manicured with plenty of flowers and trees carefully placed throughout the complex. There are also numerous statues, monuments, and kachkars (cross stones) scattered all throughout the area too. I happened to be traveling during the summer when all the flowers and plants were in full bloom. The complex acts as the administrative headquarters of the Armenian Apostolic Church and the Pontifical Residence of the Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of All Armenians (the chief bishop and spiritual leader). The Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin is also an UNESCO World Heritage Site as of 2000.\n\nI entered the complex through the Gate of Vazgen I and the first building I saw was the Church of the Holy Archangels. Located in the northeastern corner of the church this impressive structure was completed in 2011 is mainly used by the deacons and students of the seminary to hold their daily liturgical services. The outward appearance is circular and reminds you of the tower you would see in an ancient castle. The first thing you notice inside is how incredibly high it is and the beams of light going through the windows.\n\nI left the complex by walking through the Gate of Saint Gregory. This massive stone gate is an architectural beauty and its worth to see it from various angles to see the various details.\n\nThe entire experience at the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin was amazing and historic. This area is such a source of pride and Armenian culture and identity. It’s safe to say that Armenians worldwide will always point out that they were the first nation to adopt Christianity and wear it as a badge of honor. If you visit this place and then meet someone throughout the Armenian diaspora it’s a great ice breaker and way to get a conversation going.\n\nHappy traveling…"
