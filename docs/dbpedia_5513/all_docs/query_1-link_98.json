        "text": "Brill&#39;s Companion to Ancient Geography edited by S. Bianchetti, M. R. Cataudella, H. J. Gehrke is the first collection of studies on historical geography of the ancient world that focuses on a selection of topics considered crucial for understanding the development of geographical thought. In this work, scholars, all of whom are specialists in a variety of fields, examine the interaction of humans with their environment and try to reconstruct the representations of the inhabited world in the works of ancient historians, scientists, and cartographers. Topics include: Eudoxus, Dicaearchus, Eratosthenes, Hipparchus, Agatharchides, Agrippa, Strabo, Pliny and Solinus, Ptolemy, and the Peutinger Map. Other issues are also discussed such as onomastics, the boundaries of states, Pythagorism, sacred itineraries, measurement systems, and the Holy Land.\n\nThis paper places the concept of ‘common sense geography’ as developed by the members of Topoi research group C-5 within the context of ancient geographical literature. For the first time, a consistent model of arranging and classifying Greek and Roman geographical texts from a historical perspective is presented.\n\nThis collection of papers is dedicated to the problems of centre and periphery in the ancient world in their historical and geographical aspects. These problems are discussed here within a broad chronological scope: from the Mycenaean period, through the flourishing of geographical science in Hellenistic times, to the Roman period, represented by the names of Strabo, Pomponius Mela, Pliny and Ptolemy. The papers embrace all parts of the ancient oikoumene, from Africa in the south and Ireland in the west, through northern and eastern Europe to Central Asia in the east. Several authors have devoted their contributions to ancient mapmaking and how this reflects Greek and Roman conceptions of the periphery of the ancient world. The authors are drawn from across Europe: France, Italy, Poland and Russia."
