        "text": "Harichavank Monastery - The peculiarity of Haritchavank Monastery is that large stones of different shades were used for its construction. Multicolored elements create a unique pattern on the walls of the building. Harichavank known as one of the most famous monastic centers in Armenia and it was especially renowned for its school and scriptorium. The oldest part of this Armenian monastery is the Church of St. Gregory the Enlightener; it is a domed structure that is usually placed in the category of so-called “Mastara-style” churches (named after the fifth century church of St. Hovhannes in the village of Mastara, in the southern part of Shirak). The founding date of the monastery is unknown, but probably it was built no later than the 7th century, when St. Gregory was erected.\n\nGyumri - Gyumri is the second largest city in Armenia, after the capital. There are various interesting sights in the city and its surroundings. Here you can visit the art gallery, local history museum or historical and cultural reserve. There are five different churches in Gyumri and in its surroundings, the ancient Marmarashen monastery and the Orthodox chapel. One of the symbolic and recognizable sights of the city is a monument to the legendary commander Vardan Mamikonyan, who was considered the defender of Armenia and the Christian faith and was ranked among the saints. Another iconic historical monument of Gyumri is the Alexandropol Fortress. The fortress was a military defensive object and played the role of protecting Russian territories from Persian or Turkish invasions. Gyumri is considered the “capital of art” in Armenia, as well as an important cultural center. The city is also usually called the “capital of humor”, as many prominent Armenian artists and comedians come from here."
