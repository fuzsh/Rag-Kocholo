        "text": "On Sunday, December 2, His Holiness Karekin II, the Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of All Armenians, announced the establishment of a new diocese in Armenia. The Diocese of Artik grew out of the Shirak Diocese, which is based in Gyumri. It will be led by Bishop Hovakim Manukian.\n\nIn recent years, Artik has seen an increase in the number of churches as spiritual life in the region has blossomed. As an independent diocese, it will be better equipped to provide ministries that meet the needs of the local community.\n\nOn Sunday, December 9, the newly-appointed Primate celebrated the Divine Liturgy at St. Gregory the Illuminator Church in Artik. A reception was held following services, giving parishioners the opportunity to welcome Bishop Manukian."
