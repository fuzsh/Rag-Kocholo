        "text": "THE SUNDAY MESSENGER\n\nAugust 26, 2018\n\nThird Sunday of Assumption\n\nSt. Gregory of Narek\n\nSt. Gregory of Narek (945-1003) is one the most revered saints of the Armenian Church. He has been widely influential due to his penitential flavor of prayerful expression, particularly through his renowned and deeply introspective Book of Prayers. He has also gained the popularity of those outside the Armenian tradition. On February 21, 2015 Pope Francis declared St. Gregory, Doctor of the Catholic Church, joining the company of thirty-five other important figures and saints such as St. Augustine, St. John Chrysostom, St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Athanasius, St. Ephrem, and St. Teresa of Ávila. More recently, at the Vatican on April 5, 2018, under the auspices of the Pope, in the presence of the president of Armenia and both Armenian Catholicoi, a statue of St. Gregory of Narek was unveiled and blessed.\n\nBesides St. Gregory’s new status in the Catholic Church, his influence lives on in our own tradition. Thanks to Abraham Terian, Professor Emeritus of Armenian Theology and Patristics at St. Nersess Armenian Seminary, for the first time in English, the Armenian faithful have the chance to rediscover our beloved mystical poet, philosopher, and theologian through the newly published Festal Works of St. Gregory: Annotated Translation of the Odes, Litanies, and Encomia.\n\nThe poetical odes and litanies vary in length ranging from 10 to 165 lines, with headings such as Ode for the Blessing of Water, Ode for the Coming of the Holy Spirit, and Litany for St. Gregory the Illuminator. The assumption is they were composed for public and liturgical use, but how the festal works of St. Gregory were employed, if they were used at all, is unknown. Similarly, we do not know the setting of the encomia, lengthy prose texts dedicated to praising subjects such as the Holy Virgin, the Holy Cross, and the Holy Apostles.\n\nGregory’s poetry is replete with vivid imagery and descriptors, drawn from his panoramic view of Scripture. Additionally, each of the genres included embody a sense of the worshipping community’s joyful praise, serving as a perfect supplement to Gregory’s penitential Book of Prayers. Read, for example, these lines from his Ode for the Raising of Lazarus (p. 43):\n\nThe Gift able to transform the speechless, dead body,\n\nThe dead body wrapped in burial clothes, to be clothed\n\nand sealed with breath again by the Caller to Life.\n\nThe seal of death was broken as were the torments of hell,\n\nThe torments by the (evil) one who cannot harm the\n\nblessed assembly.\n\nThe great Hebrew assembly, a galaxy of thousands, praises\n\nin song the glory,\n\nThe glory of the One who bestows light, now and eternally.\n\nAmen.\n\nTODAY’S BIBLE READINGS:\n\n2Corinthians 1: 1-11 (pages 162-163) New Testament\n\nMark 4: 35-41 (page 35) New Testament – (Please follow the Armenian Reading in your Bible)\n\nIsaiah 9: 8-19 (pages 689-690) Old Testament\n\nREQUIEM SERVICES: Karasoonk (40th Day memorial Service) today will be for:\n\n– REV. FR. DAJAD DAVIDIAN on the 40th Day of His eternal life requested by the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of America.\n\n– VICTORIA BABOUDJIAN on the 40th Day of Her eternal life requested by Alice and Karnig Torossian.\n\nHokehankist today will be for:\n\n– HARRY (1st Anniversary of His eternal life) & ALICE ANDONIAN requested by David and Marta Brann.\n\n– DER MGURDITCH & OVSANNA MINASSIAN, MISAK & NOEMZAR MAZMANIAN, DEACON SHAHAB & MARY MINASSIAN, DEACON SEBOUH MINASSIAN, GABRIEL\n\nTATARIAN, JOHN ARSLANIAN, JACK, JOHN & SOOREN GOUSHIAN requested by the Peckjian and Sherenian Families.\n\n– DIRAMAYR HRIPSIME & HAROUTIOUN AIVAZIAN, SHNORHIG & HOVHANNES DONIGIAN, YEZNIG & MAXIME TOROSSIAN and AZAD AIVAZIAN in loving memory requested by Alice and Karnig Torossian.\n\nPRAYERS DESPERATELY NEEDED for one of our sister churches in the Oriental Orthodox community. As a result of the monsoon in Kerala, India, prayers are requested for all those who have lost family members (over 300 people to date) with a certainty for more to come, as well as those who have been displaced, with many of them currently homeless (over one million). This is a catastrophe of unimaginable scale.\n\n“Therefore I want the men everywhere to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or disputing” (1Tim 2:8). Please pray for Doris Alahverde, Anto Vartanian, Butch Kumkumian, Annabelle Alexanian, Alice Charles, Armenoui Aznavuryan, Pearl Jamgochian, & Albert Santerian for a return to better health and to feel the presence of God in their lives. Pray for our country and her leaders; and also for the children who will soon be returning to school that they may continue their education in a peaceful and safe environment.\n\nALTAR FLOWERS: are donated today by David and Marta Brann in loving memory of HARRY (1st Anniversary of His eternal life) & ALICE ANDONIAN.\n\nALTAR CANDLES: are donated today by Alice and Karnig Torossian in loving memory of\n\nDIRAMAYR HRIPSIME & HAROUTIOUN AIVAZIAN, SHNORHIG & HOVHANNES DONIGIAN, YEZNIG & MAXIME TOROSSIAN and AZAD AIVAZIAN.\n\nSAVE THE DATE: A Banquet honoring The Deacons and Choir of Holy Trinity Armenian Church Sunday, November 18, 2018 immediately following Badarak Stay tuned for more information Contact Holy Trinity Office 215-663-1600or office@holytrinity-pa.org with questions.\n\nHELP Coffee Hour: Parishioners help needed to run a Coffee Hour or we may not be having them in the future.

The project aims to raise funds to rebuild and refurbish libraries at 17 rural Armenian schools. “Ayo! is very excited to be part of this initiative and to support each of the fellows who are living and teaching in these communities,” said Laura Gevoryan, Ayo! Program Director. “By providing them the resources they need most to rebuild their libraries, we are ultimately empowering them to better help their students gain an improved education.” Libraries will be created in the Lori, Tavush, Aragatsotn, Armavir and Shirak provinces of Armenia, as well as one in Artsakh. Each will receive the most valuable and necessary resources, including books, bookshelves, tables and chairs, etc. To learn more about AdoptALibrary, go to: https://weareayo.org/home\n\nMen’s Club “200 Club” Ticket Information: The 2018 – 19 tickets will be distributed at the end of this month.

God longs for all of us to express our faith and devotion to Him.\n\nTHE KISS OF PEACE: After the gifts of the Eucharist are brought to the Altar Table, the deacon proclaims, “Greet one another with a holy kiss.” The person giving the greetings says, Kristos ee mech mer Haydnetsav – Christ is revealed amongst us.
