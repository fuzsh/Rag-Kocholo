        "text": "KIRANTS, Armenia -- An outspoken archbishop and his supporters have begun marching to Yerevan from a border village in the northern Tavush Province that has been the epicenter of protests over the past two weeks against the Armenian government’s territorial concessions to Azerbaijan.\n\nArchbishop Bagrat Galstanian, who has emerged as a leader of the protests, and other participants said they were taking their campaign to the streets of the capital to try to scuttle the handover of border areas adjacent to the village of Kirants and nearby Tavush communities.\n\nMany local residents have been angered by the government’s plans, citing grave security concerns.\n\n“The Tavush for the Homeland movement has decided that the people must just go to Yerevan… to demand that this process here and elsewhere be stopped,” Galstanian said in Kirants before starting the 160-kilometer journey to Yerevan.\n\nThe decision was announced two days after police cracked down on Kirants protesters who tried to stop authorities from clearing an adjacent area of land mines and make other preparations for its handover to Azerbaijan. The police presence in and around the village remained strong after the crackdown.\n\nGalstanian, who heads the Tavush diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church, said protesters plan to reach Yerevan on May 9. He gave no details of their planned actions once there.\n\nHis announcement drew statements of support from Yerevan-based opposition politicians and public figures who pledged to join the campaign.\n\nThe marching protesters, among them at least two opposition parliamentarians, spent their first night in Tavush’s medieval Haghartsin monastery. They resumed their march to the capital after attending a Mass there early on May 5.\n\n“This march is going to give us one thing: honor and homeland,” Galstanian told the crowd of more than 100 people following the liturgy. He urged Armenia’s leaders to “behave well,” “repent,” and “stay away from all kinds of sins.”\n\nPrime Minister Nikol Pashinian’s political allies and other supporters have verbally attacked Galstanian during the protests. Galstanian was highly critical of Pashinian and especially his handling of the conflict with Azerbaijan even before the protests.\n\nDuring an April 30 session of the Armenian parliament, pro-government lawmakers branded Galstanian a Russian spy, accused him of provoking another war with Azerbaijan, and even called on Armenian border guards to forcibly draft the 52-year-old archbishop.\n\nPashinian has said the unilateral concessions are necessary to prevent Azerbaijani military aggression against Armenia.\n\nThe Armenian opposition maintains he is actually encouraging Baku to demand more territory from Armenia and use force for that purpose.\n\nYulia Navalnaya, the widow of Russian opposition politician Aleksei Navalny, said on August 15 that a three-page document provided by Russian authorities offered no convincing explanation for his death in a penal colony six months ago.\n\nNavalnaya said in a video posted on YouTube that she had received \"the first and only\" official document on the cause and circumstances of Navalny's death: a three-page document stating it had not been the result of a crime and there were consequently no grounds for a criminal investigation.\n\nNavalnaya, who lives in exile, said everyone wants to know what really happened: how Navalny died, who was with him at the time, what medical aid was provided, and other questions such as whether there were attempts to save him and why it took so long to release his body.\n\n“There are still a thousand questions hanging in the air,” she said.\n\nNavalny died on February 16 in an Arctic prison where he was serving a lengthy sentence on what he and his supporters said were politically motivated charges.\n\nNavalnaya said lawyers for Navalny have been seeking autopsy results, medical documents, and video footage from his cell and the courtyard and medical office of the prison \"and after six months, this is all we've been given -- a half page of explanation.\"\n\nThe document attributes his death to a \"combined illness,\" including a gall bladder infection, a slipped disc, and staphylococcus infection, with cardiac arrhythmia ultimately causing death.\n\n\"When I first saw these pathetic three pages, I couldn't believe my eyes,\" Navalnaya said. \"It's another pathetic attempt to cover up what really happened: a murder.\"\n\nNavalnaya noted that every third Russian had illnesses of the kind described in the document but did not die from them. In addition, Navalny underwent a comprehensive medical examination when he entered the penal colony that had turned up no evidence of such ailments.\n\nShe also recalled how the day before his death he was seen in a video attending a court hearing and \"feeling fine, smiling, even joking with the judge,” she said.\n\nThe document, which has been posted in full on Navalny's website, was signed by investigative official Alexander Varapayev. Varapayev was the official in the Russian Investigative Committee who refused to hand over Navalny’s body to his mother unless she agreed to hold his funeral in private. According to Russian media reports, Varapayez was promoted after the events.\n\nLeonid Volkov, an opposition activist who was close to Navalny, also criticized the official document. The investigators took six months to formulate their version of events, and it revealed nothing, he wrote on Telegram.\n\nNavalnaya remains under an arrest warrant in Russia that was upheld on August 7 by a Moscow City Court. She is charged with taking part in an extremist group’s activities and was added to Russia's wanted list in July.\n\nThe arrest warrant was issued less than two weeks after Navalnaya was elected to head the Human Rights Foundation, a New York-based nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting and protecting human rights around the world.\n\nKosovar President Vjosa Osmani said on August 15 the country must ensure that the main bridge in Mitrovica, which divides the northern city into an Albanian-majority southern side and a Serb-majority northern side, is opened in a way that does not provoke conflict with Kosovo's international partners.\n\nThe country’s prime minister, Albin Kurti, announced at the beginning of August plans to open the bridge to vehicle traffic, a move that was opposed by members of both NATO and Quint, an informal decision-making group consisting of the United States, France, Germany, Italy, and Britain.\n\nThe announcement sparked protests by Serbs in northern Kosovo, who expressed concerns that the move would increase ethnic tensions and impact their safety.\n\nKosovo and Serbia reached an agreement about the bridge in Brussels in 2014 and the European Union funded its revitalization worth 1.5 million euros. The bridge was supposed to open in 2017, but it is currently open only for pedestrians.\n\nThe U.S. ambassador to Pristina, Jeffrey Hovenier, has said that, while the United States believes the bridge should ultimately be open to vehicles, \"this is not the time,\" due to security concerns.\n\n\"We believe there's a real risk associated with taking this action right now,\" he said in an interview with RFE/RL's Kosovo Service on August 13, citing potential violence and threats to NATO soldiers, including Americans.\n\nThe European Union has repeated its stance that the issue of opening of the bridge in Mitrovica should be resolved within the framework of official dialogue.\n\nOsmani said that the bridge in Mitrovica \"must absolutely be opened.\"\n\n“But we must ensure that when it is opened, it remains open permanently, [and] that its opening doesn’t lead to a much greater NATO presence there,” she told reporters on August 15 during a visit to the southern town of Viti.\n\nNATO forces have been operating in Kosovo to maintain peace and stability since 1999, when the Western military alliance intervened to stop escalating violence being perpetrated by Serbian forces against ethnic Albanians in what was then a province of Serbia.\n\nKosovo went on to declare independence in 2008, but neither Serbia, nor its traditional ally Russia have recognized its sovereignty.\n\nSoldiers from NATO's mission to Kosovo, KFOR, are currently stationed on the bridge in Mitrovica, while members of the Kosovo Police patrol nearby.\n\n“Is it in Kosovo's interest to see conflict between Kosovo police and an American soldier? I don't believe there is any Albanian who would agree with that. We have no reason for a conflict with our allies. They have saved us,\" Osmani added.\n\nKFOR has said it could \"adjust\" its presence \"as needed and will not hesitate to act in response to any significant security developments and in accordance with our UN mandate.\"\n\nKurti has defended the plans to open the bridge, saying his government will continue consultations with international partners.\n\nOsmani, however, dismissed the EU position that the issue of opening of the bridge in Mitrovica should be resolved within the official dialogue with Serbia.\n\n“I oppose in every way the discussion of the bridge opening in Brussels. We have no reason to ask Serbia,\" she said.\n\nOsmani was elected president in 2021 with the support of Kurti's party, Vetevendosje (Self-Determination), but the two have recently disagreed on issues like the level of coordination with Kosovo's international allies.\n\nKosovo's plan to open the bridge in Mitrovica comes amid rising tensions in the Serb-majority north of the country.\n\nEmbed

August, the Kosovar authorities closed down nine branches of the Serbian post office in the north after determining that they were operating illegally and without a license, a move that was criticized by the United States and the European Union, which have mediated Serbia-Kosovo relations for over a decade.\n\nThere are an estimated 120,000 ethnic Serbs living in Kosovo, mostly in the north, and many still receive benefits or pensions from Serbia.\n\nBulgarian President Rumen Radev has signed into law a recently adopted amendment banning LGBT \"promotion\" in schools despite calls to veto it from Bulgarian intellectuals as rights groups are preparing to stage a protest against the measure on August 15.\n\nThe law, which bans \"propaganda, promotion, or incitement\" in the education system of \"ideas and views related to nontraditional sexual orientation and/or gender identity other than the biological one,\" will be published in the August 16 issue of Bulgaria’s State Gazette.\n\nHundreds of Bulgarian academics urged President Rumen Radev in an open letter to veto the amendment.\n\nThe changes aim to tackle \"a problem that does not exist\" in Bulgaria's school system, the letter says, and would instead \"normalize political attacks\" on the LGBT community.\n\nThe Council of Europe commissioner for human rights, Michael O'Flaherty, had also called on Radev not to sign the law, adding that he was \"deeply concerned\" by the ban.\n\nRadev did not comment on the calls, but his press service said he \"has expressed his attitude to the changes\" by signing them into law.\n\nCrowds of protesters gathered on August 7 and 8 in Bulgaria's capital, Sofia, after lawmakers adopted the amendment to the Law on Preschool and School Education on August 7.\n\nRights groups have announced a new protest on August 15.\n\nThe amendment was proposed by the pro-Russian far-right Revival party and passed with 159 votes in favor, 20 against, and 10 abstentions.\n\nLawmakers also voted on another amendment to the education law, which defines \"nontraditional sexual orientation\" as \"different from the generally accepted and established notions...[of] attraction between persons of opposite sexes.\"\n\nThe text also passed but with a smaller majority.\n\nSupporters of the amendments have said they reflect the spirit of Bulgaria's constitution, which stipulates marriage is only between a man and a woman and is based on Orthodox Christian values.\n\nThe Bulgarian Orthodox Church welcomed the amendments in a statement published on August 8.\n\nBut many rights groups have criticized the move, calling it \"an attack\" on children's rights.\n\n\"The proponents of the law, the Revival party, and all those who voted in favor of the law claim that this is to protect young people,\" LGBT advocacy group ILGA-Europe said in a statement.\n\n\"However, the truth is that this is an attack on the rights of children, particularly LGBTI children,\" the statement said.\n\nDomestic and international LGBT groups have said the wording of the Bulgarian legal changes has similarities to \"LGBT propaganda\" laws in Russia and Hungary, which have been criticized by rights groups for violating freedom of expression and promoting discrimination and abuse against LGBT people.\n\nResearchers and human rights organizations routinely place Bulgaria among the worst countries in Europe for its record on LGBT rights.\n\nA Russian court in Yekaterinburg has sentenced dual U.S.-Russian citizen Ksenia Karelina to 12 years in prison after convicting her of treason for transferring $51 to a Ukrainian aid charity in early 2022.\n\nThe verdict was rendered on August 15 by Sverdlovsk regional court Judge Andrei Mineyev after prosecutors had sought a 15-year prison term for Karelina, who is also known by her marital surname Khavana.\n\nKarelina’s lawyer, Mikhail Mushailov, said his client admitted making the donation, but planned to appeal the verdict.\n\nThe verdict came one day after a Moscow court gave a U.S. citizen identified as Joseph Tater a 15-day jail term for \"petty hooliganism.\"\n\nKarelina, 33, moved to the United States in 2015, married a U.S. citizen, and received U.S. citizenship in 2021.\n\nThe U.S. State Department is aware of Karelina’s verdict, spokesman Vedant Patel said, adding that Russia \"has a track record of…not recognizing their (dual nationals') American citizen status and frankly being uncooperative when it comes to…meeting their obligations under consular conventions.\"\n\nShe was arrested in Yekaterinburg in January on suspicion of petty hooliganism.\n\nOn February 7, however, treason charges were filed against her after investigators learned that on the second day of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, she had transferred $51 to Razom, a Ukrainian aid group that helps civilians affected by the war.\n\nPatel reiterated that donating to a nonprofit, NGO, or supporting the Ukrainian cause and its people, especially on American soil, is not a crime. Patel also strongly condemn the Kremlin's \"escalating domestic repression.\"\n\nLawyer Mushailov said prosecutors found evidence of the donation on her mobile phone.\n\nIn February, Razom co-founder Dora Chomiak appealed to the U.S. government to \"continue doing everything possible to demand that [Russian President Vladimir] Putin free all those unjustly detained in Russia.\"\n\nMineyev was the same judge who in July sentenced U.S. journalist Evan Gershkovich to 16 years in prison on espionage charges.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal correspondent was then included in a large prisoner exchange on August 1 that also included RFE/RL journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, and several imprisoned Russian dissidents.\n\nAccording to rights groups, nearly 900 Russians have been convicted of treason, espionage, or cooperation with foreign governments since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAt least 1.4 million girls in Afghanistan have been denied access to secondary education since the Taliban returned to power in 2021, UNESCO, the United Nations' cultural agency, said on August 15.\n\n\"In just three years, the de facto authorities have almost wiped out two decades of steady progress for education in Afghanistan, and the future of an entire generation is now in jeopardy,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\nIt comes as the Taliban marked three years since its forces seized Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, on August 15, 2021, after the U.S.-backed government collapsed and its leaders fled into exile.\n\nSince the Taliban's return to power, women have been squeezed from public life -- banned from many jobs as well as parks and gyms -- and barred from secondary and higher education.\n\nThe restrictions amount to what the United Nations has described as \"gender apartheid.\"\n\nThere are now nearly 2.5 million girls deprived of their right to education, representing 80 percent of Afghan school-age girls, UNESCO said. This represents an increase of 300,000 since the previous count carried out by the UN agency in April 2023.\n\n\"As a result of bans imposed by the de facto authorities, at least 1.4 million girls have been deliberately denied access to secondary education since 2021,\" UNESCO said.\n\nAccess to primary education has also fallen sharply, with 1.1 million fewer girls and boys attending school, the agency added. It blamed the drop on the authorities' decision to ban female teachers from teaching boys as well as the lack of incentive for parents to send children to school.\n\nThe agency is \"alarmed by the harmful consequences of this increasingly massive drop-out rate, which could lead to a rise in child labor and early marriage.\"\n\nEnrolment in higher education is equally concerning, the statement said, adding that the number of university students had decreased by 53 percent since 2021.\n\nUNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay urged the international community to remain mobilized \"to obtain the unconditional reopening of schools and universities to Afghan girls and women.\"\n\nLack of access to education has been among the main points of criticism by Afghans toward the Taliban authorities.\n\n\"There are those who are not literate enough, and more importantly, a part of society, women, are deprived of education, and this is a big problem for the people of Afghanistan,\" a male resident of the northern Balkh Province who preferred not to be named due to security concerns, told RFE/RL's Radio Azadi.\n\n\"The issues of education -- women's education and work -- and their participation at national and international level have been completely nullified and pushed to the sidelines,\" a female resident of Kabul, who also preferred not to be named, said.\n\nThe Taliban celebrates their return to power both in mid-August around the date Kabul fell and at the end of the month, when the last U.S.-led international troops left Afghanistan.\n\nThe withdrawal, agreed by the United States and the Taliban on February 29, 2020, allowed the radical Islamist movement's return to power 20 years after being ousted by U.S. forces following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States.\n\nThe Taliban government remains unrecognized by any other state.\n\nWATCH: Rights groups have documented targeted killings, disappearances, and extrajudicial arrests of hundreds of former Afghan service personnel, while RFE/RL has spoken to two women who say they live in fear due to their past roles in the military.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:04:32 0:00\n\nInternational aid organizations have warned that millions of Afghans struggle in \"one of the world's largest and most complex humanitarian crises, three years after the change in power.\"\n\n\"Heavily dependent on humanitarian aid, Afghans are trapped in cycles of poverty, displacement, and despair,\" a statement by 10 aid groups -- including Save the Children, World Vision, Islamic Relief Worldwide, and the International Rescue Committee -- said on August 13.\n\nWomen and girls are among the most seriously affected by this humanitarian crisis, Human Rights Watch has said. The Taliban has created \"the world's most serious women's rights crisis,\" the organization said on August 11.\n\nWith reporting by AFP\n\nA former RFE/RL correspondent in Turkmenistan has died at his home in the northern Turkmen city of Koneurgench following a long illness that supporters say was brought on by pressure from the authorities over his journalistic activity.\n\nHudaiberdy Allashov died on August 13 at the age of 35 and was buried the following day, RFE/RL's Turkmen Service, known as Azatlyk in Turkmen, reported.\n\nUsing the pseudonym Mekan Tashliyev, Allashov worked with RFE/RL for three months in 2016. Among other topics, he reported on the government's use of forced labor to harvest cotton in the Dashoguz area, food shortages, and wage arrears among state officials.\n\nIn December 2016, he and his mother were arrested and accused of possession of chewing tobacco, which is illegal in the authoritarian former Soviet republic. RFE/RL reported that authorities in Dashoguz had learned Allashov's identity the day of his arrest.\n\nSources told RFE/RL that he was tortured by police in Koneurgench, including with electric shocks. Police also questioned his wife and two young children.\n\nIn February 2017, Allashov and his mother were given three-year suspended prison sentences, following calls by diplomats and rights groups for their release. Fearing for his safety, Allashov stopped working with RFE/RL.\n\nAllashov was arrested again in October 2019 and was beaten during several hours of interrogation. His mother, Kurbantach Arazmedova, fell ill under the stress of her son's arrest and died in a hospital of a heart attack.\n\nDuring police interrogation in November 2019, Allashov said, he was told that the authorities would not leave him alone \"until they drove him to his grave.\"\n\nAllashov was arrested again in December 2023 and told by police that this time he would be imprisoned \"for a long time.\" But following action by rights groups and diplomats, he was given a 15-day jail sentence.\n\nAllashov is survived by his wife and two minor children.\n\nA Moscow court has placed U.S. citizen Joseph Tater in pretrial detention until October 14, extending his original 15-day sentence on charges of petty hooliganism.\n\nMoscow's Meshchansky district court on August 14 originally imposed \"an administrative punishment in the form of detention for a period of 15 days\" however, this has been extended to two months.\n\nEarlier, Russia's Investigative Committee said on August 14 that an American had been detained in Moscow on suspicion of using violence against a police officer.\n\nThe man was detained on August 12 on a \"hooliganism\" charge, it said.\n\nU.S. State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters in Washington that the State Department was aware of reports that another American had been arrested in Russia, and said, \"we're working to get as much information as we can, working to ascertain the consular situation, and see if consular access is available.\"\n\nSeveral other Americans remain behind bars in Russia even after a prisoner swap on August 1 involving 16 people that Moscow agreed to free in exchange for eight Russians jailed in the United States and Europe.\n\nOne of them, Ksenia Karelina, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for treason for transferring $51 to a Ukrainian charity in early 2022. Karelina, who is also known by her marital surname Khavana, has been held in Russia since January.\n\nKarelina, a dual U.S.-Russian citizen, was detained by Russia's Federal Security Service in January in Yekaterinburg, where she had traveled to meet relatives. A verdict is expected on August 15.\n\nKarelina was initially charged with hooliganism, reportedly for cursing at police officers. Security agents, however, searched her phone and said they discovered that prior to traveling to Russia she had made a $51 donation to a U.S-based organization that provides aid and assistance to Ukraine.\n\nThe August 1 prisoner swap involving the United States, Russia, and several European countries included three high-profile U.S. citizens, as well as five German citizens jailed in Russia and Belarus and eight Russian political activists held in Russia in connection with their opposition to President Vladimir Putin.\n\nAmong those freed by Russia were RFE/RL journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, and former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan.\n\nUkrainian forces have taken full control of the Russian town of Sudzha in the Kursk region, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on August 15, adding that the Ukrainian military is setting up a command office there.\n\nSudzha is the administrative center for the border area of the Kursk region and is larger than any of the other small towns or settlements that Ukraine says its forces have taken since launching a cross-border incursion on August 6.\n\nZelenskiy didn't elaborate on what functions the command office might handle, although he said earlier that Ukraine would be distributing humanitarian aid to Sudzha residents in need.\n\nAn informed source within the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) told RFE/RL on August 15 that Ukraine had captured 102 Russian soldiers in the Kursk region, one of numerous competing claims by both sides about the fighting in the western Russian region.\n\n\"This is the result of a special operation carried out by soldiers of...the SBU,\" the source said about the operation the previous day.\n\nA Telegram channel connected to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry reported that \"more than 100 Russians\" had surrendered on August 14 after having been \"abandoned by their commanders.\"\n\nIt was unclear whether it was the same group of Russian soldiers.\n\nUkraine's top military commander, Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskiy, announced that a military commandant's office had been created for the parts of the Kursk region controlled by Ukrainian forces. The office has been charged with assuring order and the safety of civilians.\n\nSyrskiy also said Ukraine now controls 82 settlements in the region and about 1,150 square kilometers of territory.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said its forces had regained control of the Kursk region settlement of Krupets. It was Moscow's first claim to have retaken a settlement since the Ukrainian incursion began on August 6.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians.

Two people were killed in an air attack in the northeastern Kharkiv region and one person died in an artillery strike in Donetsk in the east, local officials said.\n\nOne person was killed in a drone attack and another died in a hospital from injuries sustained in an earlier strike in the Kherson region of southern Ukraine, authorities said.\n\nNeither side's battlefield claims could be independently verified.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov met in Moscow with military officials, members of the presidential administration, and the governors of the three western Russian regions most directly affected by the Ukrainian incursion.\n\nThe purpose of the meeting was to discuss additional measures to ensure \"the integrity and inviolability of the territory and protecting the population and infrastructure” of the Kursk, Belgorod, and Bryansk regions, a ministry statement said.\n\nKursk region officials earlier in the day ordered the mandatory evacuation of civilians from the entire Glushkov district situated along the border with Ukraine.\n\nThe Glushkov district is also near the region's Sudzha district, which has been the scene of the most intense fighting since Ukraine launched its military incursion into Russian territory. Its prewar population was about 20,000 people.\n\nAnnouncing the move, acting Kursk region Governor Aleksei Smirnov called on locals to \"treat the current situation with understanding and follow all recommendations of security agencies and local authorities\" in a post on Telegram.Amid the fighting, authorities in Ukraine on August 14 voiced concern about the humanitarian situation in Kursk and announced efforts to assist displaced Russians, including those who wish to evacuate to Ukraine.\n\n\"Ukraine complies with all norms of international humanitarian law,\" the Reintegration Ministry wrote on Facebook. \"We will provide the civilians of the Kursk region with the necessary protection and humanitarian support.\"\n\nRussia has declared a federal state of emergency for the Kursk region and a regional state of emergency for the neighboring Belgorod region. Moscow has also proclaimed an \"anti-terrorism operation\" in the Kursk, Belgorod, and Bryansk regions.\n\nUkraine's military reported on August 15 that Russia had targeted at least nine regions of the country with missile and drone attacks overnight, most of them launched from air bases inside Russia, saying that 29 drones were reported \"destroyed.\"\n\nLate on August 14, Ukraine's military confirmed that it had launched drone strikes targeting four airfields in Russia's Voronezh, Kursk, and Nizhny Novgorod regions and had caused heavy damage.\n\nEarlier, a source in the Ukrainian security agency told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service that it was the largest attack on Russian airfields since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nThe Revolutionary Court of Isfahan has acquitted Toomaj Salehi, an Iranian rapper who was sentenced to death over his protest songs against the Islamic republic.\n\nSalehi’s lawyer said the court that heard his client's case in 2022 on the charge of \"corruption on Earth\" issued the ruling on August 14.\n\nAmir Raesian said on X that Branch 5 of the Revolutionary Court of Isfahan had issued a verdict of acquittal in the case.\n\nHe added that the court also \"issued a suspension of the prosecution order on other charges” and sent two charges of publishing computer lies and disturbing order to Criminal Court 2 with a “disqualification order.”\n\nSalehi was sentenced to death by the Revolutionary Court in May on the \"corruption on Earth” charge, but the Supreme Court overturned the punishment and referred the case to a parallel branch of the Revolutionary Court for reconsideration.\n\nSalehi was serving a six-year prison sentence for his involvement in the 2022 protests that rocked Iran when he was sentenced to death on the \"corruption on Earth” charge.\n\nSalehi was initially arrested in October 2022 after making public statements in support of the protests that followed the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who died while in police custody for allegedly wearing her head scarf improperly.\n\nSalehi gained prominence for lyrics that rail against corruption, widespread poverty, executions, and the killing of protesters in Iran. His songs also point to a widening gap between ordinary Iranians and the country's leadership, accusing the authorities of \"suffocating\" the people without regard for their well-being.\n\nAfter spending much of his pretrial detention in solitary confinement, he was sentenced to six years in prison but released in November 2023 on appeal after the Supreme Court found \"flaws in the original sentence.\" But he was arrested with \"beatings\" only 12 days later after a video describing his torture in prison was published.\n\nIn a letter published in late May, Amnesty International said Salehi had been tortured and beaten repeatedly during his detention.\n\nRussian forces launched a ballistic missile strike on Ukraine's southern city of Odesa on August 14, hitting port infrastructure and injuring the driver of a grain truck, the regional governor said.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nThe attack came as the Ukrainian military continues to advance into the Kursk region, taking over more territory as they go.\n\nThe incident in Odesa occurred in the evening after the air force warned of a possible attack with ballistic weapons and declared an alarm.\n\nOdesa Governor Oleh Kiper said the truck driver who was injured in the attack was hospitalized.\n\nThe forces advancing in Kursk took over as much as 2 kilometers of territory in some directions on August 14, according to the Ukrainian military. They are creating a \"security zone,\" said Iryna Vereshchuk, deputy prime minister and minister of reintegration of the temporarily occupied territories. The goal is to help protect the border regions, primarily Sumy, from daily enemy shelling.\n\nShe noted that the Russian civilians in this zone are under the protection of international humanitarian law, which she said Ukraine fully complies with. Ukrainian Commissioner for Human Rights Dmytro Lubinets added that the Ukrainian military strictly adheres to the obligations stipulated by the Geneva and Hague Conventions.\n\nVereshchuk said Ukrainian forces plan to conducting humanitarian operations to support civilians within the security zone, open humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of civilians to both Russia and Ukraine, admit international humanitarian organizations to the security zone, and monitor the humanitarian situation.\n\nShe announced the plans after a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy regarding the situation in the Kursk region during which humanitarian aid was discussed.\n\nZelenskiy said authorities are considering creating military command posts in the Kursk region. Lubinets said these would be necessary to provide humanitarian aid to local residents.\n\nAuthorities in Russia's western Belgorod region earlier on August 14 declared a regional state of emergency [...] and a senior U.S. diplomat was in Kyiv to express continued support for Ukraine's war effort.\n\n\"The situation in our Belgorod region remains extremely difficult and tense,\" Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on Telegram on August 14. \"There is daily shelling from the armed forces of Ukraine.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office said the two men discussed the battlefield situation and security cooperation.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink wrote on the X social-media site that O'Brien's visit sent \"a powerful signal\" that \"U.S. support for Ukraine remains unwavering.\"\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said on August 14 that 37 Ukrainian drones had been \"destroyed\" over the Voronezh region, several hundred kilometers southwest of Moscow. Voronezh region Governor Aleksandr Gusev said no casualties had been reported, but several residential buildings were damaged.\n\nIn all, the ministry said 117 drones and \"four tactical missiles\" had been launched against Russia overnight, including 37 that were reportedly \"destroyed\" over the Kursk region.\n\nA source within the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service on August 14 that it had carried out a major strike on Russian military airfields in the Kursk, Voronezh, and Nizhny Novgorod regions aimed at preventing Russia from using those bases to launch attacks against Ukraine.\n\nThe claim could not be independently confirmed.\n\nUkrainian state TV on August 14 broadcast footage purportedly showing Ukrainian soldiers pulling down the Russian flag from a building in the Kursk region town of Sudzha, about 10 kilometers from the border between the two countries.\n\nThe Russian head of the Sudzha district told the TASS state news agency that the evacuation of civilians from the area was ongoing and that the situation there remained \"difficult.\"\n\nIt is not possible to verify battlefield claims.\n\nRussia's main soccer league announced that a match scheduled to be held on August 18 in Voronezh would be held in Moscow instead.\n\nUkrainian forces launched a surprise incursion into Russia's Kursk region on August 6 and claim to have occupied about 1,000 square kilometers of Russian territory.\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said in Helsinki that Ukraine \"has the right to self-defense and it's clear that they can do their operation in Kursk.\"\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:03:09 0:00\n\nThe U.S. newspaper The Wall Street Journal reported on August 13, citing unnamed U.S. officials, that Russia had transferred some of its forces from Ukraine to the defense of the Kursk region, which analysts have said was a key goal for Kyiv.\n\nThe officials said it was unclear how many troops had been transferred or what impact the move could have on the fighting in Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian publication Vyorstka wrote on Telegram on August 13 that Russian conscripts who had been evacuated from the fighting in the Kursk region were facing increased pressure from military officials to sign volunteer contracts and return to the front.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters\n\nKosovar Prime Minister Albin Kurti on August 14 defended his government's plan to open the main bridge in Mitrovica, which divides the northern city into the Albanian-majority south and the Serb-majority north, despite international criticism.\n\nKurti informed Western diplomats in Pristina at the beginning of August of his plans to open the bridge to vehicle traffic, a move that was opposed by members of both NATO and Quint, an informal decision-making group consisting of the United States, France, Germany, Italy, and Britain.\n\nThe announcement sparked protests by Serbs in northern Kosovo, who expressed concerns that the move would increase ethnic tensions and impact their safety.\n\nThe U.S. ambassador to Pristina Jeffrey Hovenier has said that, while the United States believes the bridge should ultimately be open to vehicles, \"this is not the time,\" due to security concerns.\n\n\"We believe there's real risk associated with taking this action right now,\" he said in an interview with RFE/RL's Kosovo Service on August 13, citing potential violence and threats to NATO soldiers, including Americans.\n\nNATO forces have been operating in Kosovo to maintain peace and stability since 1999, when the military alliance intervened to stop escalating violence being perpetrated by Serbian forces against ethnic Albanians.\n\nSoldiers from NATO's mission to Kosovo, KFOR, are currently stationed on the bridge in Mitrovica, while members of the Kosovo Police patrol nearby.\n\nKFOR commander Ozkan Ulutash held a meeting with Kurti late on August 13, and called on \"all the actors to refrain from unilateral statements and actions that could create tensions.\"\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:02:21 0:00\n\nBut Kurti has defended the plans to open the bridge, saying that his government will continue consultations with international partners.\n\n\"The opening of the bridge is not against anyone, especially not against international partners,\" Kurti said during a government meeting on August 14.\n\nHe added that he and his government consider the move \"to be the right, necessary, and beneficial thing for everyone.\"\n\nKosovo and Serbia reached an agreement about the bridge in Brussels in 2014 and the European Union funded its revitalization worth 1.5 million euros. The bridge was supposed to open in 2017, but it is currently open only for pedestrians.\n\nThe EU has repeated its stance that the issue of opening of the bridge in Mitrovica should be resolved within the framework of official dialogue.\n\nKosovo's plan to open the bridge in Mitrovica comes amid rising tensions in the Serb-majority north of the country.\n\nEarlier in August, the Kosovar authorities closed down nine branches of the Serbian post office in the north after determining that they were operating illegally and without a license, a move that was criticized by the United States and the European Union, which has mediated Serbia-Kosovo relations for over a decade.\n\nThere are an estimated 120,000 ethnic Serbs living in Kosovo, mostly in the north, and many still receive benefits or pensions from Serbia, which has never recognized Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence.\n\nThe Taliban celebrated the third anniversary of its return to power in Afghanistan with a military parade on August 14 amid what international aid groups say is one of the world's largest and most complex humanitarian crises.\n\nTaliban forces seized Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, on August 15, 2021, after the U.S.-backed government collapsed and its leaders fled into exile.\n\nTheir government remains unrecognized by any other state, with restrictions on women, who bear the brunt of the radical group's policies that the United Nations has branded \"gender apartheid,\" remaining a key sticking point.\n\nThe Taliban takeover is marked both in mid-August around the date Kabul fell and at the end of the month, when the last U.S.-led international troops left Afghanistan amid a chaotic withdrawal.\n\nThe withdrawal, agreed by the United States and the Taliban on February 29, 2020, allowed the radical Islamist movement's return to power 20 years after being ousted by U.S. forces following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States.\n\nThe August 14 military parade was held at the Bagram airfield, some 40 kilometers north of Kabul, which was once the largest U.S. military base in Afghanistan. The audience of some 10,000 men included senior Taliban officials. Women were barred.\n\nUniformed soldiers marched carrying light and heavy machine guns, with a motorcycle formation bearing the Taliban flag. The parade was also an opportunity to showcase some of the military hardware abandoned by U.S. and NATO-led forces after decades of war: helicopters, Humvees, and tanks.\n\nTaliban Prime Minister Mohammad Hassan Akhund, who had been scheduled to appear at Bagram, praised the Taliban authorities' victory over \"Western occupiers\" in a statement read by his chief of staff.\n\nThe Taliban government has \"the responsibility to maintain Islamic rule, protect property, people's lives, and the respect of our nation,\" the statement said.\n\nBut international aid organizations have warned that millions of Afghans struggle in \"one of the world's largest and most complex humanitarian crises, three years after the change in power.\"\n\n\"Heavily dependent on humanitarian aid, Afghans are trapped in cycles of poverty, displacement, and despair. Afghanistan is at risk of becoming a forgotten crisis without sustained support and engagement from the international community,\" a statement by 10 organizations said on August 13.\n\nThe aid groups -- including Save the Children, World Vision, Islamic Relief Worldwide, and the International Rescue Committee -- said an estimated 23.7 million people are currently in need of assistance in Afghanistan, out of a population of around 40 million.\n\nMore than 6.3 million people are internally displaced in Afghanistan, the statement said, while unemployment has doubled over the past year.\n\nWomen and girls are among the most seriously affected by this humanitarian crisis, Human Rights Watch has said.\n\nThe Taliban has created \"the world's most serious women's rights crisis,\" the organization said in a press release on August 11.\n\nSince the Taliban's return to power, women have been squeezed from public life -- banned from many jobs as well as parks and gyms -- and barred from secondary and higher education.\n\n\"The issues of education -- women's education and work -- and their participation at national and international level have been completely nullified and pushed to the sidelines,\" a female resident of Kabul, who preferred not to be named due to security concerns, told RFE/RL’s Radio Azadi.\n\nAfghan women's rights activists have been campaigning to declare the Taliban's treatment of Afghan women and girls as gender apartheid.\n\nWith reporting by AFP, AP and dpa\n\nSerbian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vulin discussed security issues and the \"involvement of external forces\" in Serbia with Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu in Moscow, the Serbian government said on August 13.\n\nVulin thanked the Russian security agencies that \"warned Serbian leadership about preparations for mass unrest and an attempted coup,\" a government statement said.\n\nVulin, who has been designated by the United States for sanctions due to his close ties to the Kremlin, met with Shoigu after a mass environmental protest over the weekend in Belgrade in which thousands of citizens demanded a ban on lithium mining. Three activists were jailed and several were questioned by police.\n\nThe Serbian government accused organizers and participants in the protests, which have been ongoing for weeks across Serbia, of attempting to violently overthrow Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic.\n\nVucic said last week that Russian security services \"warned that mass unrest was being prepared in Serbia, with the ultimate goal of a coup and the overthrow of the country's leadership.\"\n\nForeign policy analyst Bosko Jaksic told RFE/RL this was \"a colossal manipulation\" and considers Vucic's statements \"part of a multiyear game of swinging between East and West.\"\n\nHe said the Russians \"use every situation everywhere in the world\" to destabilize and \"turn countries and politicians against the West.\"\n\nVulin, who is on an official visit to Russia, reiterated on August 12 that Serbia would not impose sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. Serbia justifies its refusal citing friendly relations with Russia and the support it receives from Moscow.\n\nThe protesters demand a halt to Anglo-Australian metals and mining giant Rio Tinto's lithium project in Jadar in western Serbia over fears it could pollute nearby land and water.\n\nThe organizers of the most recent mass protest demand the release of the three activists -- Ivan Bjelic, Nikola Ristic and Jevdenije Julijan Dimitrijevic.\n\nTheir lawyer, Marko Pantic, told RFE/RL they were charged with violating the Law on Public Order and Peace and released on August 13.\n\nPantic had filed an appeal against verdicts issued by the Misdemeanor Court, which told RFE/EL the three activists were convicted in the first instance for \"indecent, insolent and reckless behavior.\"\n\nThe article referred to by the court provides for a sentence of 30 to 60 days in prison for those who \"disturb public order and peace or endanger property or insult the morale of citizens by indecent, insolent or reckless behavior.\"\n\nThe court declined to answer RFE/RL’s inquiry on the specific allegations against the three activists.\n\nPantic told RFE/RL all three allegedly approached a journalist from a pro-government newspaper, surrounded her, obstructed her work, and yelled at her. In addition, Bjelic is charged with waving a sandwich in the journalist’s face and pushing it into her mouth.\n\n\"We hope and believe that the verdict will be quashed and that all three defendants will be released,\" Pantic said."
