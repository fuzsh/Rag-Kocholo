        "text": "Province of Armenia\n\nProvince in Armenia\n\nTavush (Armenian: Տավուշ,[a] Armenian pronunciation: [tɑˈvuʃ] ⓘ) is a province of Armenia located at the northeast of Armenia, bordered by Georgia from the north and Azerbaijan from the east. Internally, Tavush borders the Gegharkunik Province from the south, Kotayk Province from the southwest, and the Lori Province from west. The capital and largest city of the province is the town of Ijevan.\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nThe name of the province is derived from Tavush; a variant of the original name of the Tuchkatak canton of the historical Utik province of Ancient Armenia. It first appeared during the 9th century as the name of the 9th-century Bagratid fortress near modern-day Berd.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nTavush has an area of 2,704 km2 (9% of total area of Armenia). It occupies the northeastern part of Armenia. It is bordered by Georgia to the north and Azerbaijan to the east. Domestically, it is bordered by the Gegharkunik Province from the south, Kotayk Province from the southwest and Lori Province from west. The territory is mainly mountainous and rocky hillsides covered with a green carpet of Alpine meadows. Tavush is sometimes referred to as a little Armenian Switzerland. The average height of the region is around 900 meters above sea level.\n\nBased on the historical divisions of Ancient Armenia, the current territory of the province occupies parts of the Varazhnunik canton of Ayrarat province, the Dzorapor and Koghbapor cantons of Gugark province, and the Aghve and Tuchkatak (Tavush) cantons of Utik province.\n\nThe province entirely lies among the mountains of the Lesser Caucasus. It is surrounded by the Miapor mountains from the east, the Somkheti mountains from the north, the Gugark mountains from the east and the Kenats mountains from the south. The highest point of Tavush is the Miapor peak with a height of 2993 meters, while the lowest point is located at a height of 380 meters in the Debed river valley near the village of Debedavan.\n\nThe province is a major source of water in Armenia. The main source is Aghstev river with its tributaries Getik, Voskepar and Sarnajur. Minor rivers include Akhum, Tavush and Khndzorut.\n\nTavush is also rich for its mountain springs, mineral water and small lakes such as the Lake Parz and Lake Gosh.\n\nMost of the Tavush territory is covered with thick forests, mainly around the towns of Dilijan, Ijevan and Berd. The province has a number of protected forests including the Dilijan National Park, Akhnabad Taxus Grove Sanctuary, Arjatkhelni Hazel Sanctuary, Gandzakar Sanctuary, Ijevan Sanctuary and Zikatar Sanctuary.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe territories of present-day Lori and Tavush along with the neighboring Georgia, became part of the Russian Empire in 1800–01. The territories became an official region of Russia as per the Treaty of Gulistan signed between Imperial Russia and Qajar Persia in October 1813, following the Russo-Persian War of 1804–13.[5] In 1840, the Elizavetpol uezd was formed and most of the territories of Tavush were included in this new administrative division of the Russian Empire. Later in 1868, the Elisabethpol Governorate was established and Tavush became part of the newly formed Kazakh uezd of the governorate.\n\nFrom 1930 until 1995, modern-day Tavush was divided into 3 districts within the Armenian SSR: Ijevan raion, Noyemberyan raion, and Shamshadin raion. With the territorial administration reform of 1995, the 3 raions were merged to form the Tavush Province.\n\nIn July 2020, Tavush became the main site for the clashes with Azerbaijan.[6]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nPopulation\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the 1989 Soviet census, the Tavush Province (then part of the Shamshadin, Noyemberyan, and Ijevan districts in 1930–1995)[7] had a population of 144,583. 49,114 or 33.97% of which was urban, distributed into the cities of Dilijan (30,433) and Ijevan (18,681), and 95,469 or 66.03% were rural, distributed into the districts of Shamshadin (34,559), Noyemberyan (33,973), and Ijevan (26,937).[8]\n\nTavush is the second least populated province in Armenia. According to the 2011 official census, Tavush has a population of 128,609 (62,083 men and 66,526 women), forming around 4.3% of the entire population of Armenia. The urban population is 54,186 (42.1%) and the rural is 74,423 (57.9%). The province has 5 urban and 55 rural communities. The largest urban community is the provincial center of Ijevan, with a population of 21,081. The other urban centres Dilijan, Berd, Noyemberyan and Ayrum.\n\nWith a population of 4,420, the village of Koghb is the largest rural municipality of Tavush.\n\nEthnic groups and religion\n\n[edit]\n\nThe majority of the Tavush Province population are ethnic Armenians who belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church. The regulating body of the church is the Diocese of Tavush, headed by Bishop Bagrat Galstanyan. The Surp Nerses Cathedral in Ijevan is the seat of the diocese.\n\nThe town of Berd is home to around 200 Udis who also belong to the Armenian Church.\n\nA tiny community of Yazidis is found in Dilijan.\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\n[edit]\n\nAs a result of the administrative reforms that took place on 15 December 2015, 17 June 2016, 16 July 2016 and 9 June 2017, Tavush is currently divided into 24 municipal communities (hamaynkner), of which 5 are urban, and 19 are rural:[9][10][11][12][13]\n\nMunicipality Type Area (km2) Population\n\n(2017 est.)
