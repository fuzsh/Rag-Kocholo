Hundreds of protesters led by Archbishop Bagrat Galstanyan, Primate of the Tavush Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church, will continue their march to Yerevan on Wednesday.

The march began in the border village of Kirants on 4 May following non-stop protests against the unilateral handover of territories in Tavush Province to Azerbaijan announced by Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan’s government on 19 April.

Today, the marchers will continue their journey from Charentsavan to Abovyan, where members of the Shirak for the Homeland movement will join them.

"We are joining the march of truth. The Shirak for the Homeland movement pursues the same goals and will join the march led by Holy Father Bagrat against falsehoods and lies,” one of the participants said before they began the march from Gyumri.

The marchers aim to reach Yerevan by 9 May to press for the cessation of the border delimitation and demarcation process.
