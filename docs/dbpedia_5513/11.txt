Last month, the Shirak diocese celebrated the 10th anniversary of the leadership of Primate Bishop Mikael Ajapahyan, a highly educated theologian and a spiritual leader of his community. In 1999, Vardapet Mikael Ajapahyan was appointed as a primate, and later consecrated as bishop. During his 10 years of leadership, the Shirak Diocese has grown to become an integral part of the community, present in almost every aspect of life.

When Bishop Ajapahyan arrived in 1999, the Shirak Diocese consisted of only 4 priests and 4 churches. Today, the diocese oversees 16 priests and more than 25 acting churches. The Diocese oversees administrative offices, Social-Educational Centers, a Youth Center, a seminary, an orphanage, a summer camp, and Sunday schools. To celebrate the tenth anniversary of Primate Bishop Mikael Ajapahyan, FAR was happy to be one of the main sponsors of a calendar commemorating the event. We hope the Shirak Diocese will continue to grow and strengthen as it has over the past decade.

In a novel by Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist, the King of Salem says: “Everyone, when they are young, knows what their Personal Legend is….there is one great truth on this planet: whoever you are, or whatever it is that you do, when you really want something, it’s because that desire originated in the soul of the universe. It’s your mission on earth.”

A strong young girl, Gohar, despite having been born in a shattered damp temporary house after the 1988 earthquake, persists in working towards her mission and knows that through study, through great learning, it can be fulfilled. But under the strained monetary situation in which her family lives, she faces many obstacles. With the father unemployed and the mother supporting the family as a violin teacher at the FAR-affiliated Octet School of Music in Gyumri, their daughter’s dream of enrolling at university might be left unfulfilled.

Fortune sent a group of young American professionals and among them an enterprising individual, Daniele Sahr, to help. This young woman immediately focused her time and energy to organize fundraising among her family and friends to meet an impending tuition deadline – Gohar would start university at Yerevan State in 3 weeks or she would not. Daniele’s genuine desire to help quickly mobilized people’s concern and in timely fashion their goal was met.

Thanks to those who took the challenge into their hands, Gohar, full of hope and gratefulness, attends the Turkish Department of the Oriental Faculty bachelor program. As Daniele explained to the donors, “This opportunity leaves Gohar poised to return to Gyumri (near the Turkish border) to work as a specialist in the event of the Armenian-Turkish border opening. Armenians must continue developing their knowledge in intercultural relations, culture, and history to help maneuver future changes in border rules and diplomatic activities. It is key that we ensure intelligent, driven students, like Gohar, get the education they need.” And most certainly, to fulfill their missions.

When I entered the Gyumri Aslamazyan Sisters Art Gallery and saw the paintings hanging on the walls, I could not believe that these works had been painted by the little girl standing in the huge hall, almost lost in the crowd of Gyumri beau monde who were wandering around to see the works.

The girl with one left hand that produced those pictures is Ophelia, who is also the only Gyumri-based beneficiary of FAR’s Gulamerian Scholarship. Ophelia was raised in the Gyumri Children’s’ Home, as her parents abandoned her right at a very young age. All of the emotions from her adolescence could be traced in the pictures: loneliness, and brief moments of joy gradually transforming into hope and a feminine spirit.

Harold Gulamerian himself was in the art business, and I can’t help but thing that ties between strangers are not always coincident. Ophelia benefitted greatly from the Gulamerian scholarship. When she was of age to attend University, Ophelia’s caretakers were not able to afford the tuition payments of the European Educational Academy Gyumri. Ophelia was fortunate to be selected for the Gulamerian scholarship. As they say, a talented person is talented in many areas: despite her trouble childhood, Ophelia has grown to be a strong woman who is a not only a successful student of the International Relations Department of the Academy, but also a talented artist and a sociable young lady. The Gulamerians and Fund for Armenian Relief are so proud to have provided someone like Ophelia with the opportunity to discover her talents.

The atmosphere at the exhibition was very jovial, and FAR is thankful to all people who assist such gifted children with special needs. At the exhibition, FAR presented Ophelia with a book containing prints of works by Leonardo da Vinci, and the FAR teamed wished her success in her future artistic endeavors. According to a Gyumri-born writer and philosopher Gurdjieff: “A tree springs from the ground, but it is not created by the earth. A grain is necessary.”
