        "text": "On August 9, 1759, Eliza Hamilton was born to the wealthy couple of Catherine Van Rensselaer and American Revolutionary War General Philip Schuyler. American, who was one of fifteen children. She was one of the seven children to make it to adulthood. In 1780, Schuyler-Hamilton was staying with her aunt in Morristown, New Jersey for the winter and there she met Alexander Hamilton, who would become her husband and was stationed with George Washington in Morristown as well. During that winter, Schuyler-Hamilton made good friends with Martha Washington, and that friendship would last throughout their husband’s political careers. Eliza Schuyler and Alexander Hamilton got married months after meeting, with blessing from Schuyler-Hamilton’s father,\n\nIn this essay I want to examine how the corset evolved from a staple of the British feminine wardrobe of the Nineteenth Century into a symbol of an outmoded tradition – only to later return as a statement of female liberation. I am going to look at different aspects of this development including technological advances, economic facts, external events, particularly the First World War and changes in social, political and aesthetic attitudes. I will also look briefly at the role of Chanel on the silhouette and how this impacted on the corset: focusing on the trend to towards ‘opulent androgyny’ in the 1920’s. Finally I will examine the resurgence of the corset\n\nEmma Trosper,20 born is Valporaso Indiana. Graduated from Valpo University. Works as a nurse. She signed up for this race to win and have fun. She said if she gets money from this race she will give it to charity. She has 7 sponsors and is very prepared for this race. She is ready to go she loves dogs and said they love her too. She said she felt adventurous one day and decided to do this race. She said will most likely eat all her food in a short period of time and hates the cold this musher is ready to go!\n\nEmma sent her child in refuge to Normandy while she stayed behind in England. She tried to secure England’s power but was captured by Cnut. To secure her spot in power, she accepted a marriage with Cnut in 1017. “Emma was linked not merely with Normandy but with the English past; the widow of the dead king of the English and their queen”. It was a political power play for both of them because they got to legitimize their power. “The reason for Emma’s resolve to remain in her adopted country must have involved claims over property. Without her estates and wealth in England, she would have been entirely dependent on her Norman family, once again, have become little more than a pawn for her brother Richard”. She knew that it was a risk because Cnut had not fully taken power in England but she knew she had no other choice. In comparison to her first marriage, “Emma had been a peace weaver between hostile states, this time round she was a figure of both subjugation and détente. From her perspective it would not have been an entirely humiliating situation: her importance would be recognized; her conciliatory role could place her in a position of great power, and, of far more immediate concern, she would retain her own estates across the country”. Her marriage to Cnut was the moment that she was able to display and use her political knowledge of England\n\nShe was born on February 23, 1787 in Berlin, Connecticut. Being the second to last of seventeen children, she had a younger sister, Almira Hart, who was also and educator and writer. Emma’s father, Samuel Hart, introduced her to her passion of education by including her in conversations that women rarely spoke about and encouraging her to be a thinker. This was beneficial for her because during that time period, women receiving education was not a popular concept. She began teaching herself geometry at the age of twelve and a few years later, in 1802, enrolled into her first school, the Berlin Academy. Within two years, she started a teaching position at that academy. She received a lot of teaching experience; after teaching at the Berlin Academy, she was able to be in charge of it for a term and went to teach at another academy in Westfield, Massachusetts in 1807. Soon after, she became the principal of a female academy in Middlebury, Vermont. In 1809, she married a physician, Dr. John Willard, who was supportive of her passion for education; however, it was still not a tolerable concept amongst most other people. Therefore, she decided to give up her career of teaching, but she still continued her studies using the college textbooks that belonged to her husband’s nephew. Emma began to realize the college education that women were deprived of since no colleges allowed female students. Furthermore, in 1814 she opened up the Middlebury Female Seminary in her home; with this, she was able to show that women had the ability to learn subjects that were deemed suitable for men. A few years after this, Willard created a proposal, called “A Plan for Improving Female Education” directed towards legislators; none of them responded, however, it did catch the attention of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. Since it was not appropriate for women to speak in public settings, this proposal was Emma\n\nThis costume is designed for Sir Thomas’ More’s daughter, Margaret More, in the part of Act 1 Scene 7 when More’s family interacts with King Henry VIII during his visit to their home. Margaret is portrayed as a fine, young lady who is demure and well-educated; she is noted by King Henry VIII as a ‘scholar’ whose Latin abilities surpasses his. As the daughter of a man of nobility, it is thus appropriate for her costume to be made out of lavish materials with intricate details to reflect the wealth and status within her family. The first layer that would have been worn by a noble lady in Tudor London is a smock, which was changed daily as people of higher classes prided themselves on being able to change into clean linen on a regular basis."
