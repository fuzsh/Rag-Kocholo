        "text": "By Sam McBride\n\nA while ago I inherited an interesting, but cumbersome, family history artifact. It features studio portraits of five men, under glass, in a heavy wood frame. There is no information on the artifact, except for the signatures below photos of four of the men, one of whom noted the date Dec. 17, 1896.\n\nAs family historian, I knew the man on the left was my great-grandfather, the Hon. Frederick Peters (1852-1919), who was a lawyer and premier of Prince Edward Island from 1891 until 1897, when he resigned and moved his family from Charlottetown to Victoria, BC where he set up a law partnership with another man in the photo group, Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper (second from the right) from Nova Scotia, whose service earlier in the Bering Sea seal-harvesting international dispute while he was federal minister of marine and fisheries earned him a knighthood. Both Peters and Tupper (1855-1927) were elected as vice presidents at the initial meeting of the Canadian Bar Association in September 1896.\n\nWith some searching I learned that the 5 men in the frame were members of the Bering Sea Claims Commission which had hearings and other meetings in Victoria during the winter of 1896-1897. Others in the display are Victoria lawyer Ernest Victor Bodwell (far right) and U.S. representatives Charles Beecher Warren (second from left) and Robert Lansing (middle). Lansing (1864-1928) would serve as U.S. Secretary of State under President Woodrow Wilson in WW1. Warren (1870-1936) would serve as U.S. Ambassador to Mexico and later Ambassador to Japan.\n\nBodwell (1856-1918) represented the government of British Columbia in the Claims Commission. He had been a founding member and president of the Victoria Board of Trade, and as an immigration lawyer. Fred Peters was the only one of the group not to sign his photo in this display, probably because it was his copy and he saw no need to sign it. He did the Bering Sea work on the side, supplementing the modest salary of $1,400 a year he received as PEI premier.\n\nTo get good scans of the photos I took them out of the frame, and was pleased to find them in excellent shape. After checking online, I found the same photo group and frame is in the archives of Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. The sealing dispute was important historically because it examined issues that would become part of international fishing disputes. The British/Canadian side came out victorious in the sealing dispute, which left a sour taste with the Americans. They got the last laugh in 1903, when they won the Alaska Panhandle in the Alaska Boundary Dispute.\n\nPeters and Tupper were excited by the prospects of an economic boom on the West Coast, particularly with the oncoming Klondike Gold Rush. They were also impressed by the mild Victoria winter weather compared to their home provinces in the Maritimes.\n\nTupper and Peters stayed at the Mount Baker Hotel while their adjacent homes designed by architect J.G. Tiarks were built in Oak Bay, known as Annandale and Garrison House. Their families, including my maternal grandmother Mary Helen Peters (1887-1976, known to all as “Helen”), joined them in the summer of 1898. The men parted ways in about 1902, with Peters continuing in Victoria and Tupper in Vancouver. The move west never panned out financially for Peters as he hoped. The family moved to Esquimalt in about 1909, and then in 1911 to Prince Rupert, where Fred once again hoped to get in early on a boomtown, and again found disappointment. Helen, who was the eldest child, remained in Victoria, where she married E.E.L. “Ted” Dewdney in 1912, and they moved to Vernon where he had been transferred by his employer, the Bank of Montreal. Fred Peters worked as city solicitor for Prince Rupert and later also as city clerk, helping the city through difficult financial times. Grief-stricken after the death of sons Jack and Gerald Peters in WW1, Fred died in 1919 and was buried at Ross Bay Cemetery in Victoria, next to daughter Violet Avis Peters, who died at age six in 1905 when her nightdress caught fire due to her being too close to one of the fireplaces at Garrision House. A third son, Capt. Frederic Thornton Peters, would die in WW2 in 1942 after winning the Victoria Cross in the Allied invasion of North Africa. Another son, Noel Quintan Peters (1894-1964) had a moderate, but noticeable, mental disability that led to him being bullied and rejected for military service in the First World War, which resulted in more extensive bullying for not serving in the war. In 1917, Noel was finally accepted into the Canadian Forestry Corps. Helen Dewdney was the only one of six Peters children to have children.\n\nFred’s widow, Bertha Hamilton Gray (1862-1946) was the youngest daughter of the PEI Father of Confederation Colonel John Hamilton Gray and Susan Bartley Pennefather. In 1915 she travelled to England to be close to her sons who were there for war service. She was devastated by the deaths of sons Jack and Gerald, particularly Gerald who was her favourite child. Desperate to contact Gerald in the afterlife, she became keen on spiritualism and seances with mediums, which her son Fritz and daughter Helen strongly disapproved. After returning to Canada in December 1916 she said she could not bear to return to Prince Rupert with so many memories of Jack and Gerald, so she moved in with Helen’s family in New Denver in the West Kootenay region of southeastern British Columbia, where Ted Dewdney was posted as branch manager. She would continue living with the Dewdney family in Rossland after Ted was transferred there by the bank in 1920, then in nearby Trail 1927-29, and then in Nelson in 1929 where Ted retired in 1940. Bertha stayed with them and their children in Nelson until her death in 1946 at age 84. Through each of these moves, Bertha took the framed group of photos of the Bering Sea Claims Commission. Daughter Helen looked after it for some time, and then for many years it was in her son Peter Dewdney’s basement in Trail, B.C. Knowing my interest in the family history, it was passed on to me a couple of years ago, and I have enjoyed investigating its origins and content.\n\nby Sam McBride\n\nOne of the great coincidences of Canadian history is that there were two unrelated Fathers of Confederation named John Hamilton Gray — one in Prince Edward Island (born in Charlottetown in 1811 and died in Charlottetown in 1887) and the other in New Brunswick (born in Bermuda in 1814 and died in Victoria, B.C. in 1889).\n\nThe P.E.I. Gray was Fritz Peters` grandfather and my great-great-grandfather. He had the more prominent role among the J.H. Gray`s at the Charlottetown Conference of September 1864 because, as head of the P.E.I. government at the time, he was the official host of the conference and was elected by delegates to be chairman of the conference. Both J.H. Grays were fervent supporters of Confederation at a time when many of the men also known as Fathers of Confederation were lukewarm or actively opposing it. The two men were also alike in qualifying for the title of Colonel Gray — the P.E.I. Gray as a career officer in the British cavalry, and the New Brunswick Gray as an Lieutenant-Colonel in his colony`s militia.\n\nIn 2014, as part of the commemoration of the 150th anniversary (sesquicentennial) of the Charlottetown Conference, a sculpture has been commissioned which will depict the two John Hamilton Grays interacting at the 1864 conference. The artist doing the bronze work is Nathan Scott from Vancouver Island. See the recent CBC report on the project http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/fathers-of-confederation-statue-to-be-unveiled-this-fall-1.2519721 and information on the artist http://www.sculpturebynathanscott.com/1/post/2013/11/canadian-artist-nathan-scotts-latest-public-commission-the-two-john-hamilton-grays.html\n\nThe fact that the artist is from Vancouver Island is interesting because Victoria, B.C. is part of the story of the two John Hamilton Grays and their descendants­. In 1872 the New Brunswick Gray moved to Victoria to serve as a judge on the Supreme Court of B.C. He died in Victoria in 1889 and was buried in Victoria`s historic Ross Bay Cemetery, which has the graves of most of the famous B.C. names of the 19th century. The people who lead tours of the Ross Bay cemetery point out that this Gray was the only Father of Confederation buried west of Ontario.\n\nI think it is ironic that the burial site and tombstone of the New Brunswick Gray in Ross Bay is in the Anglican section of the cemetery just a few yards from the grave and tombstone of former P.E.I. premier Frederick Peters, who was a son-in-law of the P.E.I. Gray. The person who organized Frederick Peters` funeral and burial at Ross Bay in August 1919 was his son Lt. Frederic Thornton “Fritz“ Peters, DSO, DSC, RN, who took leave from Royal Navy service to travel to Victoria to look after arrangements on behalf of his widowed mother Bertha Gray Peters. It is quite possible that Fritz — who later received the Victoria Cross and the U.S. Distinguished Service Cross for valour in the invasion of North Africa in 1942 — chose the gravesite because of its proximity to the “other“ Father of Confederation John Hamilton Gray. While they were not related, there was a bond between Fritz`s grandfather and the other John Hamilton Gray as builders of Canada.\n\nLast October while in Charlottetown for a book tour I visited the gravesite of my great-great-grandfather J.H. Gray at Sherwood Cemetery for the first time. I had visited the Ross Bay Cemetery on the other coast of Canada several times in recent years, but I paid closer attention to the Gray tombstone when I visited a couple of weeks ago while in Victoria. The Gray tombstone at Sherwood is much bigger than the one at Ross Bay, but is quite faded from the effects of weather and time, while the Ross Bay one is in good shape. Something they have in common is a small accompanying plaque installed years ago by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada for deceased Fathers of Confederation. As can be seen on the accompanying images, the wording on the federal plaques is exactly the same, as both men attended the Confederation gatherings at Charlottetown and Quebec City, but not the one in London: “A delegate to the Intercolonial Conferences of 1864 (Charlottetown and Quebec) at which the basis was laid for the federal union of the British North America provinces in a new nation. This grave is marked by the Government of Canada.“\n\nThe PEI Gray was long-retired and died of a lingering illness in bed at his home Inkerman House on August 13, 1887. It must have been a difficult time for his daughter Bertha, who was about to give birth to her first child, Helen (my maternal grandmother), who was born August 31, 1887. At age 75, the New Brunswick Gray was still serving as a judge in B.C. when he collapsed on June 6, 1889 while walking down a street in Victoria, according to a report the following day in the Colonist newspaper. He was looking forward to a visit from his old friend (and fellow New Brunswick Father of Confederation) Samuel Leonard Tilley, who held the post of Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick at the time. Tilley arrived to find that Gray had died while he was en route. Tilley served as a pallbearer at Gray`s funeral, along with several Victoria judges, including the most famous of B.C.`s pioneer judges, Sir Matthew Baillie Begbie, also known as “The Hanging Judge“, who would die five years later on June 11, 1894 and be buried at Ross Bay Cemetery just a few yards from the New Brunswick John Hamilton Gray. Interestingly, Frederick Peters` father James Horsfield Peters was also an actively-serving judge when he died in Charlottetown on June 20, 1891 — in fact, at 80 years of age he had the distinction of being the oldest serving judge in Canada in the year he died. http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/peters_james_horsfield_12E.html\n\nAncestry-wise, no one has ever established a family connection between the two John Hamilton Grays. The New Brunswick Gray had roots in England, while the PEI Gray was the son of Robert Gray, a United Empire Loyalist from Virginia who was born near Glasgow, Scotland. The PEI Gray`s mother, Mary Burns, was a descendant of the Burns family in Scotland, and the Stukeley and Browne families in England. Robert Gray was a penniless young man with no prospects in Scotland when he was hired as an agent in Colonial America by the Hamilton family of tobacco traders. He expressed his appreciation to his benefactors by naming his youngest son John Hamilton Gray. http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/gray_robert_1828_6E.html I do not have equivalent information regarding the naming of the New Brunswick John Hamilton Gray.\n\nSHERWOOD PARK CEMETERY, CHARLOTTETOWN, PEI\n\nThe P.E.I. Gray tombstone at Sherwood in Charlottetown reads “John Hamilton Gray entered into rest Aug. 13, 1887. Erected as a loving trbute to his most beloved memory by his wife and children. Looking unto Jesus the auther (sic) and finisher of our faith.“ The wife who decided on the tombstone inscription was his third wife, Sarah Caroline Cambridge. His first wife, Fanny Sewell Chamier, died in her first childbirth. The second wife, Susan Ellen Bartley Pennefather, was mother to five daughters: Harriet Gray Stokes, Margaret Gray Lord, Florence Gray Poole, Mary Gray Abbott and Bertha Hamilton Gray Peters. Sarah Cambridge Gray was mother to daughter Rosie Gray, son Arthur Cavendish Bentinck Hamilton Gray and son Hamilton Edward Jarvis Gray (born in 1880 when his father was age 69). Of Sarah`s children, only Arthur survived to adulthood.\n\nhttp://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/gray_john_hamilton_1811_87_11E.html\n\nROSS BAY CEMETERY, VICTORIA, B.C.\n\nThe tombstone of the New Brunswick Father of Confederation Gray says “John Hamilton Gray, D.C.L. 17 years a Judge of the Supreme Court of B.C. Eldest son of Wm Gray H.M. Vice Consul for Virginia U.S.A. Died June 5, 1889. Also, Eliza, his wife, daughter of Lt. Col. Ormondo H.M. 30th Regt Died Dec. 3, 1895. Aged 75.“\n\nhttp://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/gray_john_hamilton_1814_89_11E.html\n\nby Sam McBride\n\nFrederick Peters was born Charlottetown on April 8, 1851, the son of Judge James H. Peters of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island, and Mary Cunard, eldest daughter of Sir Samuel Cunard. He received his early education in Charlottetown schools and at Prince of Wales College before gaining a Bachelor of Arts degree from King’s College in Nova Scotia.\n\nFollowing his graduation, Peters studied law in England and later returned to Charlottetown where he set up his first law practice. He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple, London in 1876, and to the bar of Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia the same year. In England he articled under Lord Alverstone, who later said Peters was the most brilliant student he ever had. He established a law practice in Charlottetown with his brother Arthur Peters, who followed Fred`s schooling and legal career, almost step for step.\n\nAlways a supporter of the Liberal Party, Peters was first elected to the House of Assembly in 1890. One year later, after a series of by-elections, the government of Neil McLeod found itself in a minority position and Peters was asked to take over the Premiership and form a government. He became PEI`s sixth premier since Confederation, serving also as attorney general. He was the first Liberal to lead the province.\n\nPerhaps the most significant act during his term as Premier of Prince Edward Island was a bill changing the form of the Island Legislature. Previous to his administration, the Legislature consisted of two houses, a Legislative Council and a House of Assembly, much the same as the Senate and the House of Commons in the federal government of today. This system became unnecessary in Prince Edward Island and abolition of the Legislative Council was seriously looked at as a solution. However, such a bill did not have a chance of passing the Upper House so Premier Peters offered a compromise by abolishing both Houses and creating a Legislative Assembly in which members were referred to as Councillors and Assemblymen.\n\nHe served as premier and attorney general until resigning in October 1897 to move to British Columbia. He retained his seat in the Prince Edward Island legislature until 1899 despite no longer residing in the province. His brother Arthur became premier and attorney general in 1901, serving until his death in office in 1907.\n\nFred Peters was senior counsel for Great Britain against the United States of America in the Behring Sea Sealing Dispute. Americans laid claim to all seal harvesting in the Bering Sea based on their purchase of Alaska from the Russians, but this was disputed by Britain, Canada and other countries. Peters` co-counsel was federal Conservative Marine and Fisheries Minister Charles Hibbert Tupper of Halifax. Tupper was a son of the Nova Scotia Premier and Father of Confederation Sir Charles Tupper who served briefly as Prime Minister of Canada in 1896. The August 1893 decision of an international arbitration panel solidly in favour of Britain’s position was a feather in the cap for Peters and Tupper, who was knighted. Peters and Tupper also subsequently served as counsel in the Bering Sea Claims Commission.\n\nIn 1896 Frederick Peters attended the founding meeting of the Canadian Bar Association in Montreal and was elected as a vice president of the new organization.\n\nWhile in Victoria, British Columbia for hearings in the Bering Sea sealing case, Peters and Tupper were impressed with the city`s scenery, mild weather and positive economic prospects, and vowed to move there some time in the future with their families. Their plan to move across the continent and establish a law practice in Victoria was speeded up by excitement associated with the Klondike Gold Rush in the Yukon in the spring of 1897. The paid wanted to get in on the prosperity of the gold rush in some way. They saw that the city of Victoria stood to gain as a supply point for people and goods going to and from the Klondike. Peters resigned as premier as of October 27, 1897. He and Hibbert Tupper crossed Canada by train and arrived in Victoria on November 11, 1897. Their law firm in the west coast capital was established as Tupper, Peters & Potts.\n\nImpressive homes were built on adjoining lots in 1898 for the Tupper and Peters families in the recently-developed community of Oak Bay, east of Victoria.\n\nPeters invested heavily in mining ventures which faded away as the stampeders left the Yukon for new gold finds in Alaska. This was the start of money problems that would dog him and his family for the rest of his life. By 1902, Peters and Tupper had parted ways in their law firm.\n\nThe outcome of the Alaska Boundary Dispute in October 1903 was a huge disappointment for Canadians, especially for Peters, whose reputation suffered because of his involvement with the case as a researcher and his longtime association with Britain’s arbitrator Lord Alverstone, who stunned Canadians by casting the deciding vote for the Americans, who were still angry about losing the seal hunt arbitration a decade earlier. U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt had threatened to send in the marines if the boundary dispute did not go his way, and Britain was not interested in battling the Americans so far away at a time when their focus was on the rising power of Germany close to home.\n\nPeters found his law work bringing in much less income than he expected and needed, particularly as his wife Bertha wanted their children to attend private school in England. In 1911 Peters took a job as Solicitor (lawyer) for the new city of Prince Rupert, which looked like it was about to boom as a result of the Grand Trunk Railway establishing a major port that would rival Vancouver in the extent of its business. However, the boom never happened, and Peters found himself struggling each year to keep Prince Rupert from bankruptcy. He took on the higher position of City Clerk in 1916.\n\nDuring the Great War Peters was regularly called upon to deliver speeches supporting the war effort to Prince Rupert community groups. While he was proud of the honours won during the war by his eldest son Frederic Thornton “Fritz” Peters serving with the Royal Navy, the war hit his family hard, as son Private John Francklyn “Jack” Peters died in the Second Battle of Ypres in April 1915 and son Lieutenant Gerald Hamilton Peters died a year later in the Battle of Mount Sorrel. His wife Bertha was in England when she learned of the death of her sons. Instead of returning to Prince Rupert, where she would be haunted by the memories of her dead sons, she chose to live with her daughter Helen Dewdney in New Denver, B.C. Fred Peters visited his wife at least once in New Denver, and the couple got together for a short holiday in the spring of 1919, but Fred was already in ill health by then. He died July 29, 1919 alone in Prince Rupert. According to his wishes, his funeral was in Victoria and he was buried at historic Ross Bay Cemetery in Victoria."
