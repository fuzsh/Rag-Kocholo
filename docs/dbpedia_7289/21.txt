Tupper Family, 1896

In 1855 Tupper entered politics and defeated Joseph Howe in Cumberland County. He sat in opposition until 1857 when the Liberals were defeated. He became Provincial Secretary and initiated discussions with other jurisdictions regarding the Intercolonial Railway. The Conservatives were defeated for a short time but returned to power in 1863. The following year, on May 11, 1864, Tupper took over as Premier of Nova Scotia. He was a strong proponent for both Maritime and British North American union. Tupper was the lead delegate at the Charlottetown, Québec and London conferences but was unable to win approval for the Quebec Resolutions in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly.

In 1867 he entered federal politics and was Nova Scotia's only representative in favour of Confederation.

Tupper was successively president of the Privy Council (1870-72), minister of inland revenue (1872-73), and minister of customs (1873). He served as minister of public works (1878-79) and minister of railways and canals (1879-84). He became high commissioner to Britian in 1884, but returned to Ottawa to serve as minister of finance (1887-88).

Tupper and the Conservatives were badly defeated in the general election in June. He resigned on July 8, having served only ten weeks as prime minister, the shortest tenure in Canadian history. He continued in Parliament as leader of the Opposition but was defeated in the election of 1900. On retirement he lived in Bexleyheath, England.
