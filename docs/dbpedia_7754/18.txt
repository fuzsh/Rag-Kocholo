1924-2007

I compiled this genealogy of doctoral advisors using the data at the Mathematical Genealogy Project, for “Feldmania”, a scientific meeting honoring the 65th birthday of my doctoral advisor, Prof. Marcus W. Feldman. Marc's doctoral advisor was Samuel Karlin, who, sadly, passed away on December 18, 2007, a month after I last saw him at the meeting. We were fortunate that the meeting gave us the opportunity to see Sam one more time. And neither Sam nor Marc realized that their academic lineages included such luminairies of mathematics, so I am glad it came in time for Sam to see it. Below is the doctoral advisor genealogy of Sam and his students (evidently not all are in the database yet).

I mourn his loss.
