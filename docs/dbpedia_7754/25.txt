Genetic variation in human transcription factors

Sequencing of exomes and genomes has revealed abundant genetic variation affecting the coding sequences of human transcription factors (TFs), but the consequences of such variation remain largely unexplored. We developed a computational, structure-based approach to evaluate TF variants for their impact on DNA-binding activity and used universal protein binding microarrays to assay sequence-specific DNA-binding activity across 41 reference and 117 variant alleles found in individuals of diverse ancestries and families with Mendelian diseases. We found 77 variants in 28 genes that affect DNA-binding affinity or specificity and identified thousands of rare alleles likely to alter the DNA-binding activity of human sequence-specific TFs. Our results suggest that most individuals have unique repertoires of TF DNA-binding activities, which may contribute to phenotypic variation.

Protein-RNA interactions and function of alternative 3' UTRs

Many RNA binding proteins (RBPs) bind specific RNA sequence motifs, but only a small fraction of RBP motif instances are occupied in vivo. To determine what additional contextual features discriminate between bound and unbound motifs, we are using in vitro binding of RBPs of interest to large pools of array-synthesized oligonucleotides. Using ~110 nt oligos representing natural RNA sequences, we find that the subset of motif instances bound in vitro correlates with in vivo binding and developmental regulation, and multiple lines of evidence implicate RNA secondary structure in modulating binding. I will also discuss recent work showing that mRNA isoforms that contain gene-distal alternative last exons are preferentially localized to neurites.

Heterogeneity in Large-Scale Biomedical Data Sets

There is a great deal of hype surrounding the concept of ‘Big Data,’ especially in the biomedical sciences. The belief that collecting massive amounts of data and mining it appropriately could lead to unprecedented basic biomedical insights and suggest ways of predicting health outcomes in individual patients is motivated by many successes large-scale data collections have had in the recent past (e.g., the 1000 Genomes project, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), etc.). However, there are number of issues plaguing the analysis of large data sets, not the least of which concern the reliability and harmonization of the data. One important and often overlooked issue concerns overt if not cryptic heterogeneity in the data. In this talk, discussions of both the motivation to accommodate heterogeneity and methods for achieving it are provided. In addition, examples settings in which heterogeneity is the rule rather than the exception are provided that range from single cell analyses, characterizing the properties of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSc), cell line-based drug screens, the ‘rewiring’ of tumorigenic networks, and accommodating and exploiting heterogeneity in tests of health interventions via emerging clinical trials designs.

Expanding the ENCODE Encyclopedia: Applications for Annotating Non-coding Variants

Jill Moore, Michael Purcaro, Henry Pratt, Arjan van der Velde, Tyler Borrman, and Zhiping Weng

The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Consortium has generated hundreds of high throughput genomic datasets with the goal of cataloging functional elements in the human genome. Our goal was to integrate these complex data types to annotate regulatory elements and their target genes. We then used these annotations to functionally characterize non-coding variants associated with human disease.

We began by developing an unsupervised method for predicting enhancer-like regions, which we evaluated using experimentally validated data from transgenic mouse assays. Using only H3K27ac ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data, our method shows high concordance with more complex genome segmentation methods with the advantage that it can be applied across many more cell and tissue types. Our next step was to then connect these predicted enhancers to their target genes. In order to compare different methods, we created a novel benchmark dataset by integrating eQTLs, ChIA-PET clusters and Hi-C links. We developed a Random Forest (RF) based approach using features such as the distance between the enhancer and gene, DNase and H3K27ac signals, and gene expression. With this model, we saw a dramatic increase in performance compared to methods based only on signal correlation. We then applied both methods to over 100 cell and tissues types across human and mouse and created a visualization tool (http://zlab-annotations.umassmed.edu/) where users can query and download regions of interest.

Using this resource, we then sought to annotate non-coding variants in the NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog. While there were many cases of variants residing in enhancers that targeted only the nearest gene, there were some interesting exceptions. In particular, rs1250564, which is in high LD with SNPs associated with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), resides in an enhancer-like region within the ZMIZ1 gene. In lymphoblastoid cells, whose regulatory regions were previously determined to be enriched in MS variants, this enhancer targets both ZMIZ1 and PPIF. PPIF encodes a protein that is part of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore which supports the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction may play a role in the the onset of MS. This finding demonstrates that by using the ENCODE Encyclopedia, researchers can determine target genes of non-coding variants and gain a better understanding of the underlying disease.
