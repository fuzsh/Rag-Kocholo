        "text": "The Autonomous Tiger Racing Team is comprised of Ph.D., M.S., and B.S. students from across the Samuel Ginn College of Engineering at Auburn University. Team members learn skills in:\n\nhigh-speed vehicle dynamics\n\nperception-based navigation (LiDAR, cameras, etc.)\n\nlocalization and estimation\n\nV2V and V2X Communication and Networking\n\nSimulation Environments\n\nIn 2020, the GAVLab began preparing to make history, and throughout participation in the Indy Autonomous Challenge, we did just that. AU was the first team to see their car run autonomously at Lucas Oil Motor Speedway.\n\nThe first official competition took place on October 23, 2021 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The team then traveled to Las Vegas in January of 2022 to compete at Las Vegas Motor Speedway as a part of CES 2022."
