        "text": "Thanks for keeping the Peoples Bank Theatre alive during these incredibly difficult times!\n\nAs the year comes to a close, we would like to give thanks to those generous supporters that helped us out in the last year and a half. In the middle of 2020 we really did not know whether we could survive closure due to the pandemic. Fortunately for us, many people have grown to love the Peoples Bank Theatre and have realized what an important role it plays in our community. When we needed it most, the following people and institutions made sure we would be around so we can all continue to share in the magic that takes place at our historic theatre.\n\nOur heartfelt thanks!\n\nSincerely,\n\nR. Hunt Brawley, J.D., Executive Director\n\nand the Hippodrome/Colony Historical Theatre Association Board of Directors:\n\nJerry Brock, Dan Bryant, Tammy Cinalli, Geoff Coward, Misty Crosby, Sarah Drake, Matt Evans, Jennifer Garrison, Dan Harrison, Stephen Hussey, LeeAnn Johnson, Christy Minard, Ken Morrison, Tatum Parmer, Jennifer Powers, Sharon Reagan, Jill Ruff, Brad Smith, LeeAndra Smith, David Tenney, Jim Vuksic, Bernita Watson, Shelly Windeler, and Paul Zecchi"
