        "text": "Areas of expertise\n\nApplications of Organic Chemistry to Chemical Biology, Medicinal Chemistry and Chemical Ecology\n\nResearch interests\n\nPhysical organic chemistry informs interdisciplinary areas that link together chemical synthesis, biological and material sciences with theoretical and physical chemistry. Research in the Kehlbeck Lab falls into three major categories: Chemical Biology, Chemical Ecology, and Material Science. All projects involve organic synthesis, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry(LC-MS/MS) or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). I am interested in molecular recognition events that control biological events and how we as chemists can design and synthesize small, non-natural, molecules that mimic the functional properties of materials found in nature. Researchers in my lab can gain experience in molecular modeling, solution and solid phase organic synthesis and purification using chromatographic methods as well as a variety of analytical techniques including NMR and chromatography-mass spectrometry.\n\nTeaching interests\n\nCHM 080 Culinary Chemistry\n\nCHM 231 Organic Chemistry I & Lab\n\nCHM 232 Organic Chemistry II & Lab\n\nCHM 330 Medicinal Chemistry\n\nI teach courses for majors and non-majors in the application of organic chemistry to areas such as culinary chemistry and medicinal chemistry.\n\nAdditional media\n\nDistinctions\n\nAwards and Honors\n\nDonald C.
