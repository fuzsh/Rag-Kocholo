His research interests bridge molecular biology, statistical modeling, and bioinformatics algorithm development. Several software applications from his group are in wide use, including programs for gene structure prediction and sequence comparisons (https://brendelgroup.org/bioinformatics2go). His group has also been involved in the development and implementation of databases and web resources for genetic and genomic data, in particular for maize (www.maizegdb.org) and other plants (www.plantgdb.org). Recent efforts of the group have been devoted to exploring cyberinfrastructure solutions to mining massive amounts of new genomic sequence data. Prior to joining Indiana University, Dr. Brendel was the Bergdahl Professor of Bioinformatics at Iowa State University. He received his M.Sc. degree in Applied Statistics from the University of Oxford, UK, in 1981 and his Ph.D. in Life Sciences from the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel, in 1986. From 1987 to 1998, Dr. Brendel was at Stanford University, CA, as postdoctoral associate, research associate, and lecturer.\n\nDegrees and Appointments\n\nProfessor, 2012-present, Department of Biology and Department of Computer Science, Indiana University Bloomington.\n\nBergdahl Professor of Bioinformatics, 2002-2011, Department of Genetics, Development and Cell Biology (formerly Department of Zoology & Genetics), Department of Statistics (courtesy appointment), Iowa State University, Iowa, U.S.A.\n\nChair, Interdepartmental Graduate Program in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Aug. 2009 - Aug. 2011\n\nProfessor, 2001-2011, Department of Genetics, Development and Cell Biology (formerly Department of Zoology & Genetics), Department of Statistics (courtesy appointment), Iowa State University, Iowa, U.S.A.\n\nAssociate Professor, 1998-2000, Department of Zoology & Genetics, Iowa State University, Iowa, U.S.A.\n\nResearch Associate (and [part-time] Lecturer in Mathematics), 1989-1998, Department of Mathematics, Stanford University, California, U.S.A.\n\nPostdoctoral Associate in bioinformatics, 1987-1988, Advisor: Samuel Karlin, Stanford University, California, U.S.A.\n\nPh.D. Life Sciences, 1986, Advisor: Edward Trifonov, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel\n\nM.Sc.
