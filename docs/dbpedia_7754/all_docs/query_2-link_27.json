He has been a member of the Department of Statistics at Purdue University since 1964. Professor Studden is a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics and is an elected member of the International Statistical Institute. In addition to his many distinguished publications in leading journals in the field, he has coauthored two books: Tchebycheff Systems: with Applications in Analysis and Statistics (1966 with Samuel Karlin), and The Theory of Canonical Moments with Applications in Statistics, Probability and Analysis (1997 with Holger Dette). During his career, he has been the major advisor for fifteen Ph.D. students and served for many years as Department Graduate Chair. His research interests include Geometry of moment spaces, Optimality of experimental designs, Spline smoothing and Canonical moments."
