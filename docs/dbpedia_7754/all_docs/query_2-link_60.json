        "text": "#conference alert. We are just one week away from the 2024 ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings, which is taking place August 4-9 in beautiful Pacific Grove, CA. This \"summer camp for nerds\" brings together experts to collaborate, debate and share research on how to equitably decarbonize the building sector to address the urgency of the climate crisis. If you're attending Summer Study, be sure check out our CEO Beth Karlin at the following sessions: - Monday at 10:30am, Beth will present on \"Understanding Innovation-Decision Gaps in Utility Program Offerings\" in the \"Occupant Behavior and Utility Programs\" session alongside Will Sierzchula, PhD (Guidehouse), and Gregory Romine (Eversource Energy) - Wednesday at 1:00pm, Beth will serve as an expert panelist in the BECC Solutions Session alongside Karen Ehrhardt-Martinez, Reuven Sussman (ACEEE), and Shelby Ketchum (Seattle City Light). Not attending? Check out the proceedings after the conference, which has two See Change authored papers: - Understanding Gaps in Utility Program Offerings and Customer Engagement - How do Small and Medium Businesses Understand and Respond to TOU Rates? You're also welcome to comment here or message us for a copy of either / both papers... :) More info and registration at: https://lnkd.in/eQk2_UG4\n\nExcited to share a free course I'll be teaching next week - \"The Art and Science of Civic Entrepreneurship.\" The course is publicly available through the InnovateUS platform. You can register here: https://lnkd.in/etjAzrJR We'll be taking an enterprise change management perspective to learn: > The top 10 \"get things done\" skills for introducing innovation in gov > How to use storytelling to align “coalitions of the willing” > The importance of working across fed, state, and local gov to make progress on shared policy priorities See you there 😁\n\nStoked to share the U.S. Department of Commerce Equitable Data Playbook! This playbook is for all federal leaders looking to improve their capacity to better deliver for the American people. The playbook helps answer questions like: > How to identify communities most in need of federal investments? > How to design a \"fit-for-purpose\" data system for delivering on program goals? > How to involve communities in your program data decisions? Plus - you can check out innovative DOC programs that demonstrate \"the art of the possible\" with improved data capabilities. Get the playbook here: https://lnkd.in/eGMid89d Special shout out to our DOC Chief Data Officer Oliver Wise for catalyzing this important effort. Also - a special thanks to the DOC leaders and bureaus featured in the playbook, including those at the U.S. Economic Development Administration, NOAA: National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, USPTO, U.S. Census Bureau, National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), as well as to our inter-agency friends at the Office of Evaluation Sciences and White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n\nBefore I worked in government, I was naive about what it takes to create real change in the public sector. Now, I have utmost respect for the people I call \"civic entrepreneurs.\" I have personally met hundreds of committed change agents across federal, state, and local governments. Through our work on a historic policy portfolio together, I'm amazed at the creativity and resourcefulness of world-class public sector professionals. But a lot of their entrepreneurial efforts have yet to be captured. This semester, I've been inspired to uplift their stories as part of a Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy dinner salon series. The idea is to show a \"behind the scenes\" look at what it takes to help large enterprise teams improve how they deliver for communities. For those that want to take a peek, I've included a short slide deck that includes \"10 Elements of Civic Entrepreneurship.\" This is hard work, but it's work that matters. *Special thanks to Tom Kalil for his seminal article on the topic, \"Policy Entrepreneurship at the White House.\" Found here: https://lnkd.in/eAYWk-Qd #civicentrepreneur #publicservice\n\n***PLEASE HELP*** The Local Zero pod is looking for funding to continue! 💰💰💰 Hosts Matthew Hannon, Fraser Stewart and I have been running Local Zero since 2020, in conjunction with Bespoken Media. Over the years, it has become established as the leading platform to spotlight and debate local climate action. We’ve pulled together a video that showcases some of our guests, the positive impact that the series has had, as well as engagement stats and highlights (70k listens, 20k listeners, 130 countries reached). 📽 https://lnkd.in/e2FgxjQN We have been operating to date on funding from a UKRI research grant, but we’re looking to transition our funding model in 2024, and partner with organisations who hold the same values we do. If you or someone else might be interested in supporting us in our next chapter, please contact us at localzeropod@gmail.com. At the very least, please promote this post, so we can reach someone who does. Thank you, Matt, Becky and Fraser 🎙 https://lnkd.in/eDWePVcg #climateaction #netzero #sustainability #community\n\nSIMA 2024 WINNERS ANNOUNCED 🏆 Congratulations Filmmakers!
