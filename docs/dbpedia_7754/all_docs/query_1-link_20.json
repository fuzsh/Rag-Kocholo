        "text": "Director’s notes for As You Like It: Al Bowlly and the Possibility of Love by David Melville\n\nSometime earlier this year Melissa and I were thinking about how to approach this play when an old sentimental song came streaming over the speakers in the kitchen. I think it was Love is the Sweetest Thing, a delightfully uncynical romantic number, flecked with dashes of melancholy in the melody. The perfect distillation of love and a great example of the tin-pan alley hits that were popularized by the dance orchestras in London in the 1930’s. The singer, Al Bowlly, was familiar to me as I’d discovered him in pile of 78’s that I nearly sent to the charity shop when clearing out my parent’s house in our little village in England a few years ago. Somewhat forgotten now but hugely popular in his time he recorded something like 400 records and died quite young in the blitz during WW2.\n\nI felt that his music might provide some romantic inspiration for As You Like It and, already thinking about mining his songbook for scene changes etc. I put on an Al Bowlly playlist. Such great songs: The Very Thought of You, Midnight With The Stars And You, My Woman etc. and then something very strange occurred. A song of his, that I didn’t know, came on but the words were oddly familiar “ It was a lover and his lass…” Wait a minute, isn’t that the Springtime song from As You Like It?\n\nIndeed, it was and not only that he also recorded a swing version of Blow, Blow, Thou Winter Wind. These were both settings, composed by Arthur Young, that were used in a musical revue in London called New Faces of 1940. The same revue show-cased the debut of A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square. I don’t know if these songs were ever used in a proper production of As You Like It before but it became clear to me that they needed to be in this one.\n\nSo, we began to think about placing our As You Like It in 1930’s; Rosalind’s journey wouldn’t be out of place in a screwball comedy of that era. The possibility of love is a rich seam of gold throughout the play. A possibility that takes some unlikely turns. When Rosalind and Orlando first begin to fall in love, they lose the power of speech. They can’t even utter the basic necessities of a courting couple, let alone deal with the more complex transactions and compromises that love engenders. Lucky for Rosalind, that in her next encounter with Orlando she has taken on a male alter ego and she can road test the relationship loquaciously and without risk to her own fragile heart. She quizzes and schools him on the themes of jealousy, mood swings, trust, faith, fidelity and female freedom. Orlando’s sweet, guileless spirit wins every time. For his part, Orlando gets very attached to his young male tutor. Shakespeare starts to blur the edges of this seemingly conventional love and hints at a possibility of love for Orlando that probably wouldn’t have made it past the Hays Code in the 1930’s. When Orlando finally grows tired of their horseplay, Rosalind faces a crisis and must find a way to reveal her true identity to Orlando but in reality she can never go back to the person she was: perhaps Ganymede was part of her true identity all along.\n\nIn his comedies, Shakespeare only ever gives us love coming together: he leaves us at their greatest and most delightful moment – what will Orlando and Rosalind/Ganymede be up to in 5 years? Something tells me Rosalind’s thorough vetting will have guaranteed her an apt and accommodating partner.\n\nI find Celia’s journey through the play fascinating and in early discussions about As You Like It Bukola and I agreed that we should try to see Orlando and Rosalind’s bizarre courtship through Celia’s perspective. For Celia, the possibility of love is uncharted waters fraught with danger. Rosalind’s love for Orlando also represents a very real threat to her close and loving relationship with her cousin. She fails to check Rosalind’s emboldened and increasingly outrageous antics as Ganymede but not without trying. When she meets Orlando’s reformed super-handsome brother late in the play, she has an about face and is suddenly all-in on the possibility of love.\n\nJaques, on the other hand, adds some salt to all the sweetness in the play. Like the blue notes in those 30’s jazz songs, Jaques’s melancholy provides a slightly sour counterpoint to the proceedings. Jaques is closed to the possibility of love – perhaps he had his heartbroken and can never get over it. Duke Senior’s men find themselves exiled in the forest and, as one does in a pastoral comedy, they seek to find meaning and solace in the hardship and privations of their life in the woods. We tried to imagine them as supremely incapable aristocrats with very few actual survival skills and not very well-tuned philosophical skills either. They bring a chandelier, piano and dinner service with them but no change of clothes and only one gun (that none of them use as they are all vegetarian). Of them all, only Jaques appears to be gaining any true meaning from their ascetic existence. His soul is nourished by experience, even if it makes him sad.\n\nPhebe’s eventual acceptance of Silvius may have been more familiar to Shakespeare’s audience than ours – the settling for something that might not be the most exciting but, nevertheless, a love that is practical and pragmatic. Touchstone and Audrey round out the quartet of lovers with the baser and more bestial aspects of love, a marriage that is about one thing only: sating one’s desire.\n\nElizabeth Cox, our costume designer, helped bring our 1930’s inspiration to life. We spent some time studying a charming and whimsical cosplay movement in the UK which began about 15 years ago. It goes under the lofty title of Anarcho-Dandyism but it mostly centers around publication The Chap Magazine and its ancillary events such as The Chap Olympiad a summer festival in London that features English Chap sports such as jousting with umbrellas on bicycles. These men and ladies dress meticulously in styles from the 30’s and 40’s with some touches of anachronism and quite a bit more color than real clothes from the display.\n\nLike Duke Senior, we find ourselves exiled this year further into the forest. The long-awaited construction of our permanent stage in Griffith Park is imminent which is why we are not performing in our regular spot. Hopefully, any day soon the excavating machines will start digging the foundation for a much grander platform than the one you see tonight. However, we are very grateful to have this opportunity to explore performing in the round for the first time in the magical dell at the top of the Old Zoo picnic area. We regard this season as an opportunity to try some things that we may never have a chance to do again. Hence our opening up the playing areas to include more of the park and exploring the cages and other areas in our immersive pre-show prologue (written and directed by ISC ensemble member Nikhil Pai.) As the dell is a smaller capacity and as this production is perhaps more ambitious than anything we have done in a while (it’s the largest cast we have assembled since 2016) we are only presenting one play this season but we will be back with two shows next year (hopefully on our new stage).\n\nSongs in As You Like It\n\nUnder The Greenwood Tree – Lyrics William Shakespeare, Music David Melville\n\nBlow, Blow, Thou Winter Wind - Lyrics William Shakespeare, Music Arthur Young\n\nCountry Girl – Music and Lyrics David Melville\n\nCity Girl (Goat Poop Song) - Music and Lyrics David Melville\n\nIt Was A Lover And His Lass - Lyrics William Shakespeare, Music Arthur Young\n\nGrow Old With Me – Music and Lyrics John Lennon\n\nEpilogue - Music and Lyrics David Melville\n\nTHE COMPANY"
