        "text": "Dean Stover values quality and communication in health care and will ensure high-quality and innovative educational opportunities as VTSU continues to grow health care programs to meet workforce crisis.\n\nVermont State University (VTSU) welcomes Caitlin Stover, PhD, RN as the new Dean of Nursing and Health Sciences. Stover joins VTSU as the nursing program continues to expand to meet the demands of the health care workforce crisis. Highly skilled and well-prepared nurses are desperately needed across Vermont in all sectors of the health care system. VTSU graduates about 375 nursing students at all levels each year, with programs offered from a practical nursing certificate to a Master’s-level nursing education, with flexible learning programs that include online courses, in-person and on-campus options, and hands-on learning experiences in state-of-the-art labs available for every student.\n\n“We are so fortunate to welcome a leader with Caitlin’s, skills, experience and drive in the essential leadership position of dean of nursing and health science,” said David Bergh, interim president of VTSU. “Over three-quarters of our nursing graduates earn licenses to practice in Vermont when they leave VTSU, and our dedication to providing Vermont with the health care professionals it needs at all levels in all corners of the state is unwavering. Caitlin is up to the challenge of thoughtfully and efficiently expanding our nursing and health sciences programs in a way that will ensure the programs retain their stellar reputation of producing highly capable graduates.”\n\nStover has worked in nursing education for more than 17 years, many of them in at the university administration level. Drawing her to her new post as dean of nursing and health sciences at VTSU is the opportunity to work with both future nurses and their future colleagues. In her position at VTSU, she will oversee not only the nursing program, but the education of allied health professionals, including radiology technicians, respiratory therapists, dental hygienists, and future physical, speech and occupational therapists who use the general health sciences major as a foundation for further studies, among others.\n\n“It’s important to me that all of us on the health care team who work together be educated together. The only way we’re going to be successful as nurses is if we work well with the other members of our team,” she explained. “It translates into the workplace—not only into better outcomes for the patients, but for the employees, too,” she said, citing improved employee satisfaction, and employee retention. “The nurse is often referred to as the care manager. The more nurses who understand what’s going to happen, for example, when patients go down to radiology, the better they can prepare their patients.”\n\nStover will also focus on ensuring that programs adhere to strict accreditation and regulation requirements and retain their high-quality offerings and reputation. She knows the accompanying demands well, having created a nursing program from the ground up at her last job at Assumption University, where the inaugural class had a 100 percent pass rate on the nursing boards.\n\n“We are in a health care crisis, and, in particular, we are in a nursing crisis right now. We need to graduate safe practitioners of high quality and caliber because they are our brand and they are our ambassadors and that’s what society deserves,” she noted.\n\nVTSU has an incredible impact on our state’s health care landscape—growing their programs efficiently. With pass rates each year well above national averages and even 100 percent for the Practical Nursing program, it’s no surprise that 75 percent of Vermont’s nurses today were educated at VTSU. Last year, VTSU announced it would grow its nursing program to 1000 seats. Significant investments in facilities and equipment include substantial renovations to expand the nursing education center at Williston and create a new nursing education center at Johnson, as well as a telepresence classroom at Castleton and updates to its lab in Lyndon. Dean Stover will be taking the lead on this expansion.\n\n“We offer our students the ability to learn all across Vermont while accessing courses in a way that fits their lifestyle and needs – whether that is in-person, online, or in a hybrid format,” shared Bergh. “We are very excited to continue to grow this program and support our health care system under Dean Stover’s leadership.”\n\nWith recognition that we are living through an era in which Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming our society, on August 8, the Vermont State Colleges System’s (VSCS) Teaching & Learning with Technology (TLT) hosted an AI Retreat to bring together faculty and staff from across Vermont’s public higher education system to explore the profound implications of this technology on education.\n\nOver 200 participants from Vermont State University and Community College of Vermont – the two institutions that make up VSCS – faculty and staff gathered at the Vermont State Randolph campus to gain a comprehensive understanding of AI, from the foundational differences between narrow, generative, and general AI, to the latest advancements in the field and how they can be effectively utilized in higher education.\n\nKellie Campbell, Chief Information Officer at Vermont State Colleges Information Technology, explained, “TLT, a group of colleagues across both VTSU and CCV, is a working committee to support and foster the sustainable, innovative use of technology for teaching and learning at all VSC member institutions. The group identified early on the importance of AI and wanted to provide space for collaboration and learning. Open to both faculty and staff, we gathered in community to learn, discuss, and consider AI through the lens of ethics, equity, pedagogy, security, business process improvement, change readiness and practical/potential use cases (to name a few). “\n\nThe day kicked off with a fantastic presentation from keynote speaker, Stephen Aguilar, Associate Professor of Education at USC Rossier School of Education and Associate Director of the USC Center for Generative AI and Society, whose insightful and inspiring presentation “Authentic Intelligence: Preventing AI from “Hijacking” Education” delved into the rapidly evolving world of AI in education, explored the benefits and efficiencies AI brings, and discussed the potential downsides of an over-reliance on AI in education. Watch a clip of that presentation here.\n\nLeslie Kanat, Dean for the School of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics at VTSU, shared, “As our students increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs), it is essential that we, too, understand and use these tools. We must ask ourselves: What can we do better than even the most advanced AI? LLMs excel in many tasks, but they lack the ability to form personal relationships and offer the human interactions that are so vital to the educational experience. This is where we, the faculty, truly excel and where our irreplaceable value lies.”\n\nAfter the keynote, participants chose from a wide range of breakout sessions focused on everything from Exploring Generative AI for Pedagogical Uses, to Utilizing an Equity and Justice Lens to Understand Bias in the Machine, to Microsoft Copilot for Beginners. Faculty and staff were empowered to analyze, better understand, and work with AI responsibly, with the goal of ensuring that the benefits of this technology can be utilized across our institutions while continuing to protect privacy, accessibility, and in the academic environment.\n\nRobert Franklin, Social Media Manager and University Photographer at VTSU, added, “Attending the AI retreat was a game-changer for me as a social media manager. It opened my eyes to the potential of AI in streamlining content creation and analyzing trends in real-time. I walked away with practical tools and strategies that will not only enhance our social media presence, but also make our communication efforts more efficient and impactful.”\n\nKellie also shared, “Higher education has such a key role to play in how we support and position AI not only in our internal work, but how we balance opportunity and use with a human layer of intervention to prepare a future community of leaders. Our community was ignited yesterday, ready to think about what is next as we transition into a new academic year. A special thank you to Jen Garrett-Ostermiller, Jeff Tunney, Lisa Hayward, Jen Alberico, Sarah Chambers, Sean Dailey and Tony Harris for their leadership in planning.”\n\n“The AI retreat was a wonderful opportunity for CCV and VTSU faculty and staff to come together and learn more about AI and how it may impact teaching and learning,” shared Nolan Atkins, Vice President of Academic Affairs and Provost at VTSU. “The event generated a great deal of rich conversation among the nearly 200 participants.”\n\nMultilingual students find support and academic success at Vermont State University\n\nNineteen percent of Vermont State University (VTSU)’s first-year students in Fall 2023 identified as Black, Indigenous, or People of Color (BIPOC). Multicultural students make up a significant proportion of these students, including international and exchange students, refugees, immigrants, and domestic students with multilingual heritage. Amongst the multicultural students, the number of students who are fluent multilinguals, meaning they regularly use two or more languages in their day-to-day lives, increases from 87 in Fall 2023 to 166 this coming fall. Vermont State University has taken steps to support these students in their educational pursuits to ensure they are able to succeed.\n\nVTSU Multilingual Student Services has implemented a comprehensive approach known as Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL). This approach goes beyond traditional English as a Second Language (ESL) support, providing a robust framework that integrates language learning with subject-specific content learning.\n\n“Vermont State University is committed to meeting our students where they are to support their academic journey and that means approaches like CLIL,” said VTSU Interim President David Bergh. “Additionally, we remain committed to our office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Social Justice at a time when many institutions of higher education are stepping back from this work. Ensuring that all students have the academic and personal support structure in place to succeed is essential. We want these students, and all students, to have a great experience while they are learning here at VTSU.”\n\nDr. Mary Dinh, Assistant Director of Multilingual Students Services, published her work extensively on how bilingualism can be embraced as a cognitive advantage and academic excellence[1]. She notes that supporting the unique experiences of multicultural multilingual students and the faculty who engage with them is essential to the students’ success, sharing, “so many students that we engage will need a little bit of help to bridge their academic and daily lives. Academic English in higher education, often involving complex scientific concepts and field-specific jargons, is different from the interactional language we in use daily life and our role is to support students so they have both a positive experience and are able to achieve at their full potential.”\n\n“I have to understand each student’s case for personalized support,” she adds. “Sometimes, it’s raising their confidence when they are minorities on campus, sometimes it’s finding ways to promote an intercultural mindset by encouraging students to draw on their diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds as assets in the learning process.”\n\nThe CLIL method is based on the idea that learning a language can help students learn content, and that learning to use language can be integrated into content development. This enables VTSU Multilingual Students Services to serve the needs of historically marginalized students by providing an inclusive and equitable learning environment rather than an isolated English-as-a-second-language course. Students are provided access to resources such as one-on-one tutoring with subject specific (e.g., English in Nursing, English in Music Education, English in Business, etc.), mentoring, learning strategies, and cultural orientation, which are essential for the academic and personal development of multilingual multicultural students.\n\n“Mastering complex medical terminology and understanding lectures in a non-native language takes time. We also have the same amount of time in tests as monolingual language users while having to navigate the translation in our head. The high-pressured assessment styles may also differ greatly from those in a student’s home country. At the same time, we also need to adapt to the rigorous demands of clinical practice, where effective communication and comprehension are crucial,” shared Kimoy Creary in a personal conversation with Dr. Dinh, an international student from Jamaica, who is a newly graduated registered nurse and will be working at Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington. After earning a degree in nutrition in her home country, she came to VTSU for her nursing degree.\n\nCreary greatly benefited from the self-paced learning resources provided on the Multilingual Students Services shared internal webpage, where she was able to access books and multimedia related to English in nursing, terminologies flashcards, and English used in hospitals. Students can book tutoring sessions to learn testing strategies before high-stakes exams, practice conversations before clinical practicum, or discuss how to draft a publishable research paper. 98% of nursing students using Multilingual Students Services showed significant improvement in both conversational skills and academic performance.\n\nPart of the Student Success and Academic Support Teams, Dr. Dinh’s office also collaborates with VTSU International Students Services, Upward Bound Programs, faculty members, school libraries, and local communities to facilitate activities, such as presentations for local elementary and high school students, international festivals, and public intercultural galleries.\n\nVTSU is playing a crucial role in fostering inclusive and supportive environments for students from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds. In fact, the VTSU CLIL model will be featured in the upcoming book, Intercultural Competence in Higher Education English Language Instruction and the university recently partnered with Ho Chi Minh City University of Science (Vietnam National University) to launch a training program for students studying to be English teachers so that they can apply a similar instruction model in their country.\n\n“It’s about recognizing the student’s potential and finding the support they need to study and learn at their best,” adds Dr. Dinh. “We live in an increasingly multilingual world and meeting students where they are, supporting their personal and academic successes, and preparing them to make positive contributions to their communities, our state, and the world, is foundational to our mission. The transformative impact is clear, and stories like Kimoy’s highlights its potential to help VTSU students overcome language barriers and achieve academic success.”\n\n[1] https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=roR3zPEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao\n\nOn Tuesday, July 16, Vermont State University’s (VTSU) Johnson campus co-hosted Vermont’s annual Disease and Wildlife Ecology Symposium alongside faculty from Middlebury College, Norwich University, and St. Michaels College. The event included presentations focused on the themes of disease dynamics and ecological interactions among various species, including studies on melanoma in fish, tick-borne diseases, parasite infections, microbial pathogens, and the effects of invasive species and stress on health.\n\nFour VTSU students from the Castleton and Johnson campuses presented their research, “Is black-legged tick abundance associated with invasive plant species cover in rural private woodlands?” Deacon Watson, a student at VTSU Castleton, shared, “It is great to get a chance to collaborate with my fellow peers as well as get an idea of what the future looks like in these sort of events, because in undergrad, you often don’t get chances to do research – much less to present that research in a meaningful forum – and so this is a good opportunity to get an idea what that looks like.”\n\nThe symposium arose from a Disease and Wildlife Thematic Interest Group formed through the Vermont Biomedical Research Network (VBRN), which supports biomedical research at VTSU and other colleges and universities in the state.\n\nAlexandra Williams: Student at VTSU Castleton: “I’m really excited to learn about everyone else’s research and see how we can learn from others and apply that to our future research. We got to present the work we spent three months on and get to actually talk about it with other people that aren’t in the woods!” Allie Cloutier, a VTSU Johnson student, echoed these sentiments, sharing, “I’m most excited about sharing our research and getting to speak to other people about ecology, and share ideas.”\n\nAttendees of the symposium included professors, graduate, and undergraduate students from the University of Vermont, Vermont Department of Fish & Wildlife, Middlebury College, Norwich University, St. Michael’s College, as well as from University of Massachusetts Amherst and University of Maine. This year the event was co-sponsored by the VBRN and the New England Center of Excellence in Vector Borne Diseases.\n\nFor more information or questions about the event, please contact Associate Professor William Landesman at William.Landesman@VermontState.edu.\n\nPursuant to Executive Order: 11988 (Floodplain Management) and 11990: (Wetlands) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s(FEMA) implementing regulations at Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 9, FEMA hereby provides final notice of its decision to provide Pre-Disaster Mitigation program funding for an action located in a floodplain and wetland. Funding would be provided through Vermont Emergency Management to Vermont State University for the Glen Brook Dam Partial Removal Project.\n\nThe proposed action is located at the Vermont State University’s Castleton, VT campus. The purpose of the project would be to reduce the hazards associated with the potential breach of the dam impounding Glen Brook Pond, which is currently assigned a Significant Hazard Potential classification by the Vermont Dam Safety Program. Partial removal of the dam would reduce the Dam Safety Program classification to that of Minimal Hazard and reduce the potential risk to human life and property, owner liability, and long-term costs for the University.\n\nThe proposed scope of work would be to reduce the height of the concrete spillway by 2 to 3.5 vertical feet over the full length of the spillway, which would reduce the dam’s height to within 1-foot of the rip rap currently buttressing the downstream slope of the dam. In doing so, the total volume of the impoundment would be reduced to approximately 330,000 cubic feet of combined water and sediment, and the surface area of the impoundment would be reduced from approximately 2.2-acres to 1-acre while allowing the majority of the sediment currently impounded by the dam to remain in place. The project would also involve decommissioning the low-level outlet in-place by filling it with flowable fill and removing the valve stem, removing invasive knotweed, spreading sediment removed from the impoundment, and planting native upland and wetland vegetation in areas disturbed and converted from pond.\n\nThe project is within a mapped special flood hazard area (1% annual flood chance) (A Zone); however, based upon hydrologic and hydraulic study completed during project design, the project is not anticipated to affect flood elevations or areas inundated during flood events. Portions of the project would occur within a delineated wetland, and the reduction of the impoundment area would affect wetland areas; however, impacts to wetlands above the impoundment would be expected to be limited by the presence of upstream beaver dams.\n\nAdditionally, aquatic organism passage would be expected to improve.\n\nThe project must occur in a floodplain and wetland due to the location of the dam. Alternative solutions were considered including no action, repair or modification of the dam, and full removal. The proposed action was selected as the alternative that achieved the project purpose of reducing the hazards of potential dam failure while minimizing project costs. Grant conditions will require compliance with all federal, state, and local laws, including coordination with the local floodplain administrator.\n\nMap requests and comments about this project and potential floodplain and wetland impacts should be submitted within 15 days of the date of this publication to: Christian Paske, Environmental Protection Specialist Federal Emergency Management Agency, Cambridge, MA Christian.Paske@fema.dhs.gov; 202.704.1027\n\nRegister now through July 10\n\nFirst responders provide critical and often live-saving services at both natural and technological disasters. They may be exposed to death, grief, injury, pain or loss, as well as threats to their own safety, frequent shifts and/or long shifts, lack of sleep, physical hardship, and other negative experiences. In many cases across Vermont, these first responders are community-based volunteers taking time away from their careers and family to respond in a moment’s notice to serve their neighbors in need. That is why Vermont State University’s Center for Social Justice and Trauma Response Care on the Castleton Campus is hosting its second Annual First Responder Wellness Conference on July 15-16. You can register here.\n\n“First responders carry the weight of their own safety and well-being as well as those they serve,” said Dr. Linda Olson, executive director of the Center for Social Justice and Trauma Responsive Care at Castleton on the Castleton campus of Vermont State University (VTSU). “Often, they get little time to heal and recover from one potentially traumatic situation before the next one occurs. It’s therefore understandable that first responders face a greater risk of stress, PTS, depression, substance use, and suicide ideation and attempts. These risks only increase when issues of structural inequality are considered—they disproportionately impact groups already disadvantaged by race, class, and gender,” she added.\n\n“Often times first responders are made up of groups of people that were taught to be tough and to suppress their emotions,” reported Danielle Morse, a volunteer firefighter, registered nurse, and 2021 graduate of the VTSU nursing program. “A mental health crisis doesn’t always happen after just one bad call, but trauma can slowly add up over time. Sometimes it’s just seeing or experiencing one little thing that is enough to overfill the cup and lead to emotional collapse. Especially in the volunteer world, many of us go directly home after a call and have to deal with emotions on our own,” she explained.\n\nThe Center has mobilized to mitigate the risks faced by the heroes we count on in emergencies and other crises with a two-day training session designed to support first responders and help build community. Participants will listen to two keynote speakers— Nicole Sawyer, PsyD, a licensed clinical psychologist in New Hampshire who works exclusively with public safety professionals and agencies, Mike Cancellieri, who directs the Front Line Foundations a Vermont-based non-profit dedicated to providing culturally competent mental health care to veterans and first responders. They will also choose from a variety of workshops.\n\n“This preventive training major aim is to promote peer support programs, resilience skills and interventions to address burnout prior to disasters or other events,” Olson noted. “Our program is unique because it recognizes and actualizes the connection between structural inequity and trauma,” she stressed.\n\n“Workshops and wellness sessions that are available specifically for first responders are critical to help those who are already in need, and to help prevent future trauma by teaching more first responders that it’s okay to not be okay, but that it’s not okay to deal with those emotions alone,” Morse stated. “Keeping a community healthy and well starts with making sure those who are helping the community are as well. As a registered nurse and volunteer firefighter of over 10 years, I have seen far too many people who could have utilized these services but never reached out for help and didn’t know how to help themselves,” she said.\n\nThe Center launched four years ago with a $100,000 grant from Rutland Regional Medical Center. The organization is a laboratory for advancement in the field of social justice and trauma informed care. The program, run by VTSU faculty and staff and incorporate students, provides resources and trainings to improve the health and wellbeing of residents of Rutland County. The group recently received a $10,000 grant to expand services into Addison County. The conference is open to all first responders and scholarships are available for those needing assistance.\n\nAll first responders statewide are encouraged to register and attend. Affordable overnight accommodations and meals are available.

College athletics provide both immediate benefits—such as academic support, medical care, and access to coaching, facilities and equipment—and longer-term benefits, such as teamwork and leadership skills. One Castleton student is experiencing even more from the NCAA, as an intern beginning in the organization’s Indianapolis office and culminating at the its Women’s College Basketball Academy in Rock Hill, South Carolina.\n\nZack Durr, a track and field athlete, who is also the Castleton campus’s new Senior Class President, hit the ground running in more ways than one this summer. He splits his days between work and track training. “The days are long, but really fun,” he notes. “The internship has been an absolute blessing from God. I’m just over a month in—so halfway. In some ways, it feels like we’ve been here forever; in other ways, it feels like it’s only been a week.”\n\nHe and nine other interns work together on the Women’s College Basketball Academy, which gives prospective women student-athletes a sample of the college basketball experience. Another team of seven administers the men’s academy. All live together in some capacity. The interns share living quarters as well as office space.\n\n“The College Basketball Academies are three-day long showcases for the best high school and junior college basketball players in the country. They pair high-level basketball competition with life skills instruction relating to being a student athlete,” Durr explained. “All of the interns were hired to help with planning and executing the events. We communicate with athletes and their parents to be sure all the forms and waivers we need are in place. I oversee 60 students and their families,” he noted.\n\n“Most of the work involves calling and emailing parents and cross-referencing information with spreadsheets we maintain to be sure all forms are filled out. We also answer any questions families may have and help with steps like booking flights. I like people, so I enjoy the work,” he continued.\n\nHe explained that students arrive at the academy through several different pathways. Some come with other members of their own teams, others as individuals.\n\n“Some are selected to attend by NCAA Division I coaches,” Durr said. “Those coaches watch players play and scout at the event. Several Division II and Division III coaches coach the student teams. Some of our work involves checking information for coaches. We also did some research on where players from last year ended up—where they committed for college.”\n\nAfter the initial administrative work is done, Durr and the other interns will travel to South Carolina to see their planning executed during the academy from July 27 to 29.\n\n“We’ll arrive a few days before the students and leave a day after. I’m really looking forward to seeing all work we’ve done come to reality. I think it’s great to provide student athletes with this kind of experience, so it will be cool to see it happen,” he noted.\n\nDurr credits his time at Castleton both for helping him land the job and teaching him skills he’s using in it. He learned of the opportunity through a website, teamworkonline, that details jobs in college athletics. Having served as president of the Castleton Student-Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC) and an associate member of the NCAA Division III SAAC, he had been to the Indianapolis office before. While he wasn’t familiar with the basketball academies, he knew a lot about the way NCAA operates.\n\n“I also was student government treasurer for several years and the number of skills I learned about organizing and communications are really applicable to this role or a similar role In any field. I owe some credit to the extracurricular activities I did at VTSU for that. Being a student-athlete gives you a packed schedule, but being at VTSU Castleton has allowed me the opportunity to get involved in more things without sacrificing anything about my sport,” he noted. In addition to competing in track, holding several offices in student government and participating in SAAC, Durr has been treasurer of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA) and resident assistant at his dorm, Wheeler Hall.\n\n“I give a lot of credit to my coaches in the VTSU Castleton track and field program over the past three years— David Harvey, Ian Sawtelle, Mike Audette, Austin Beauregard and Jay Condon—for helping me to adjust my training based on my other commitments and giving me the best chance to succeed on the track and in my other roles on campus,” he acknowledged.\n\n“Zack is involved in numerous leadership roles on campus and thrives in each of them,” said VTSU Castleton Director of Athletics Tim Barrett. “He has immersed himself into every opportunity that has come his way since the moment he arrived at Castleton, and his hard work has led him to an incredible opportunity with the NCAA this summer. Those who work closely with him know that this is just the beginning of what will be an impressive career in athletics.”\n\nDurr said he decided on VTSU Castleton because of the effort the campus’s former head coach Jay Condon put in to recruit him.\n\n“He truly made me feel like I would be a huge addition to the team,” Durr related. “I also intended on dual majoring in sports management and business management—with a career goal of working in college athletics—and I realized that was something I could do after a few professors were kind enough to chat with me about the programs as a prospective student.”\n\nDurr said he is proud of his decision to choose VTSU.\n\n“Going to VTSU Castleton is one of the best decisions I have ever made. It has been incredible for my development as a leader, a student-athlete, and as a Christian. I have able to grow physically, emotionally, and spiritually throughout my time as a Spartan,” he shared.\n\nDurr said he highly recommends playing sports at VTSU to high school students making decisions about college now.\n\n“This is a place filled with special people. It’s hard to describe, but VTSU Castleton is unlike anywhere else. The sheer heart that everyone has for athletics and supporting each other is incredible,” he noted. “Our Student-Athlete Advisory Committee collaborates to ensure all teams are supported by each other, and our athletic department puts a heavy emphasis on that idea as well. This is the place to be if you want to grow and be part of something bigger than yourself.”\n\nPhoto above of Zack Durr, courtesy of Zack.\n\nVermont State’s Early Childhood Education Institute Enrolls a Record Number of Students\n\n135 participants from across Vermont engage in rich, diverse curriculum, partnership with State of Vermont make program substantially free\n\nThe Vermont Early Childhood Educators Institute (ECEI) 2024 is filled to capacity. All 135 slots are taken and that’s good news for Vermont, where quality child care providers are still in strong demand. ECEI equips early childhood and afterschool educators to provide high quality experiences to the children in their care. The Institute, coordinated by Vermont State University (VTSU), also makes it easy for those seeking or renewing licensure to get the credits or certification they need online, while learning through a rich curriculum developed by expert instructors. Participants can choose to earn a certificate for attending the institute, or they can study more in-depth and earn college credit.\n\n“We realized a lot of the folks who are attending the institute were working toward licensure or getting continuing education to retain their license,” said Ric Reardon, PhD, executive director of VTSU Center for Schools. “The Agency of Education prefers to see credits, rather than just ‘seat time.’ For example, a licensed kindergarten teacher who wants to add an early childhood endorsement would need to include credited courses as evidence to use to add that endorsement.”\n\nThis year, the Center for Schools has been able to offer the ECEI for free to participants, with an additional low cost added if participants choose to receive college credit because of some very substantial financial support from the State of Vermont Child Development Division.\n\n“We have a child care crisis in Vermont with too many families waiting too long to find care and this impacts our entire workforce, including at VTSU, so we are proud that this institute is part of the solution,” said VTSU Interim President David Bergh. “We are training and skilling up hundreds of early childhood educators. This program is a great example of how we step in and respond with accessible and affordable programs that address our State’s social and economic needs.”\n\n“Vermont employers understand that an effective childcare system is a precondition to having an available and engaged workforce” noted Seth Bowden, President of the Vermont Business Roundtable. “One of the key metrics to a sustainable system is the number of educators entering into high quality programs and viewing childcare not as a job, but as a career. We are excited to see this collaboration led by Vermont State University in partnership with the State of Vermont to train and prepare more childcare providers. By developing a professionalized childcare workforce, this work will both strengthen the economy and support the youngest and most vulnerable Vermonters.”\n\nThe State partnership makes it even easier for educators to participate in the ECEI. “The State funds the Institute to offer these courses at a low cost,” related Lynne Robbins, early childhood and afterschool systems specialist for the Vermont Department of Children and Families Child Development Division, who sits on the planning committee for the Institute. “Many early educators are achieving courses that help them meet qualifications under Vermont Child Care Licensing requirements or for Agency of Education Educator License requirements. Others enjoy the opportunity to interact with educators across the broad early childhood system while engaging in content that is relevant for their work with young children and families,” she said.\n\nThe diverse programming offers many options to participants and brings together leaders from across the state in early learning.\n\n“We hold a keynote presentation for the first 45 minutes—welcoming speakers from VTSU, the Agency of Education, Head Start, the Vermont Association for the Education of Young Children (VAEYC), and other organizations dedicated to quality childcare. Then the participants head off to the strands they select,” shared Reardon.\n\nThe seven strands this year range from “Creative Techniques for Working with Trauma-Impacted Children and Families” to “Math in the Outdoor Classroom.” Reardon said they repeat the most popular ones from year to year, but they like to add two or three new strands each year for variety.\n\n“The beauty is that there is a good variety of topics presented, so that anyone can hopefully find one that speaks to their needs,” Robbins explained. “For me, I like seeing topics related to social and emotional learning, because understanding this topic helps early childhood educators in reducing behaviors that may otherwise result in suspension or expulsion of children. No young child should be kicked out of a program because their early childhood educator did not have a better understanding of early childhood behaviors,” she expressed.\n\n“Every year, we ask folks who attend—usually around 90 to 95 students—how they would like to see the Institute function the next year—on campus, virtually, or hybrid. They continue to love the fact that it’s online—for financial reasons, geographical reasons, their own childcare,” he noted. “We have participation from 13 Vermont counties and some from New York, New Hampshire and Connecticut.\n\n“Our costs, much of which are now covered by State and Federal grants, can be lower when we offer the course online—even the cost to provide college credit. A typical 3-credit course from VTSU is almost $2,100. The cost to students for this course (3 credits) is only $435,” he remarked.\n\nReardon praised the work Robbins and her colleagues have done to help the Institute gain funding—particularly this year, when the four-day program registration is free to participants.\n\n“They asked, ‘if you brought in 135 participants, how much would it cost for their registration fees and to cover the instructors’ stipends?’ and they covered it,” he explained. “We hope we can partner together to continue providing this low-cost programming in the years to come, as long as the demand for it continues.”\n\nThe workforce demand in the field is high. Aly Richards, CEO of Let’s Grow Kids, applauded the work of the ECEI to strengthen the quality of Vermont’s early childhood education programs. “Congratulations to VTSU for record enrollment in The Vermont Early Childhood Educators Institute and thank you to the participants for all you do to advance the profession and care for our children. Continuing education is essential to strengthening the quality of Vermont’s early childhood educators. Prioritizing the development and ongoing support of educators is essential to solving Vermont’s child care crisis as we work together to create a comprehensive childcare system that meets the needs of Vermont families, children, and employers. These professionals are nurturing, teaching and preparing our youngest Vermonters for their future. I’m excited to see such strong enrollment in this program this year and know it will bring incredible value to early childhood education programs across Vermont.”\n\nAs Vermont High School Spring Athletics Wind Down, Vermont State University has Message for Seniors: Come to VTSU and Continue as a Student Athlete\n\nAthletics are strong and thriving at Castleton, Lyndon, Randolph and Johnson Campuses\n\nInterim President David Bergh has a strong message for graduating senior high school athletes: come to Vermont State University and continue playing the sport or sports you love. Athletics have long been part of the culture and excitement that comes with attending Vermont State University’s campuses in Castleton, Johnson, Lyndon, and Randolph. Campus sports include competitive NCAA (Castleton, Johnson, Lyndon) and USCAA (Randolph) varsity programs, as well as intramural and club sports ranging from basketball to baseball and football, both alpine and Nordic skiing and field hockey, among others.\n\n“Enrollment is up and we’re excited for our future. Our student-athletes have great experiences at Vermont State University and provide us with so much entertainment and excitement all year long,” shared Interim President Bergh. “Athletics are a great way to make friends, stay fit physically and emotionally and bring school spirit and inspiration to the community. I encourage any graduating student-athlete who would like to continue with athletics next year in college to give VTSU a look. We have such a broad array of sports teams in all seasons and our multiple campuses mean students can very likely play the sport or sports they love here at VTSU. If playing on a varsity team isn’t your thing, we have great club and intramural options as well.”\n\nFurthering the VTSU commitment to collegiate athletics, Interim President Bergh was recently unanimously elected presidential chair of the North Atlantic Conference, the conference in which VTSU Lyndon and Johnson participate.\n\n“Johnson athletics is a close-knit community which provides me the resources needed for success on the court and in the classroom,” noted women’s basketball center, Gabby Wardwell. “Diversity, inclusivity and caring for others is what being a Badger is all about!”\n\n“Athletics here is a way of life,” shared Johnny Johnson, class of 2025, a proud VTSU Randolph Knight who competes in both basketball and track. “Athletics teaches you quality leadership skills, teamwork skills, and how to overcome adversity. We hold each other accountable and help each other grow.”\n\nUnification of VTSU last year has afforded students the opportunity to participate in a broader array of athletics, intramurals and club sports offered across four of the five campus sites. Vermont State University has retained each of its legacy mascots, preserving cherished individual campus identities. Athletes can be Hornets at VTSU Lyndon, Knights at VTSU Randolph, Badgers at VTSU Johnson or Spartans at VTSU Castleton. Many VTSU student-athletes have the opportunity to travel for competitions and serve as proud ambassadors for the school and the state, which is a unique and meaningful experience.\n\n“There’s no question that academics come first for our students, but athletics here are treated as extensions of our student’s academic experience. Students are supported by our faculty, staff, peers and the community to succeed in both areas,” Bergh continued.\n\nUnlike some higher education programs where students are limited to just one sport, students at VTSU are given the unique opportunity to participate in two, or even three sports.\n\n“We are so proud of our athletics programs and are excited to welcome our next first-year class of student-athletes in the fall,” shared Greg Eckman, athletic director and women’s basketball coach at VTSU Johnson. “We are hoping it’ll be our largest recruiting year yet and set the stage for a great experience for all—athletes and spectators alike—at VTSU”\n\nYou can learn more about all athletic offerings at Vermont State University here.\n\nVermont State University Class of 2028 on Track to Exceed Class of 2027 After First Decision Milestone on June 1\n\nSignificant jump in applications creates stronger pipeline of students\n\nDespite a national Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) debacle which has delayed college decisions typically made on May 1 to June 1, Vermont State University (VTSU) is on track to welcome a larger class this fall than in fall 2023. Just how much larger remains to be seen, as students have until classes start in August to enroll. Colleges and universities around the country have been alarmed by the rollout of the new, streamlined FAFSA form, and have deployed additional resources to ensure families have the financial information they need to make decisions.\n\nAt VTSU, significantly more students are enrolling, particularly in online programming. “This is very good news for our growing university as we enter just our second year and we are humbled that so many more students are giving VTSU consideration,” shared David Bergh, Interim President at Vermont State University. “Our students have the opportunity with rolling admissions to make decisions over the summer, so I expect even more of those accepted students to commit to VTSU in the coming months. We are working hard to make our case to them, showing them that VTSU is a growing community of creative, active and engaged learners and a wonderful place to get your degree or certificate.”\n\nVTSU enrollment officials credit a much larger pipeline of students and growing student interest in the school. To date, there is an increase in applications of over 14 percent year-over-year including a 23 percent increase in out-of-state student applications and a nearly 40 percent increase in students seeking online opportunities. At this critical juncture, there is a nearly 14 percent increase in accepted students leading to about a two percent increase in deposits over last year.\n\n“The numbers themselves may seem small,” Bergh continued, “But given the challenges families faced with the FAFSA this year and all the changes that came with our unification, which cannot be understated, to be where we are at this moment is a great sign for our future. We are so excited for the fall semester ahead.”\n\n“I am pleased with our progress to date given the headwinds facing higher education at this time,” shared Beth Mauch, Chancellor of the Vermont State Colleges System. “My expertise as a mathematics professor tells me that we are trending in the right direction and there are positive signs pointing to strong enrollment this fall. That said, we will not rest on our laurels and are working very hard to reach students who are accepted but undecided, as well as other, non-traditional students who may want to change careers or level-up their skills. There’s no better place to learn in Vermont than at our Vermont State Colleges – both VTSU and CCV–and we are eager to grow our student rolls to support a stronger economy and more robust workforce.”\n\nThis news comes just weeks after VTSU’s inaugural commencement where it graduated nearly 1,000 students prepared to help address Vermont’s critical workforce shortages, power our economy, and take on leadership roles in our communities.\n\n“This first graduating class serves as such an inspiring example to those students who are still undecided about their post-secondary path. They are a living example of the power of education and training after high school to earn a degree that is relevant and prepares students for rewarding and well-paying careers,” added Bergh.\n\nVermont State University serves as a model for structured programs, multiple campuses, online, and hybrid offerings that meet students where they are to ensure they succeed. The enrollment process is no different. Students have until August for most programs to enroll in a flexible and student-friendly process. Additionally, students can live on-campus, commute, or take classes online. And very importantly, tuition is free for qualified Vermont students with family incomes of $50,000 or less and competitive financial aid offerings ensure a degree is within reach of all students regardless of age, circumstance or income.\n\nOlivia Davis is a rising sophomore in the Health Sciences degree program and lives on the Johnson campus. She hails from Saranac, NY and is a part of the inaugural first-year class of VTSU and believes VTSU is a great place to learn and grow after high-school. “Whether it’s athletics, clubs or classes, VTSU just pulls you in and makes you feel at home,” said Olivia. “I’ve had an incredible experience on the Johnson Women’s Soccer team this year and can’t wait to return in the fall. On campus, faculty and staff are accessible, class sizes are small, and the atmosphere is welcoming. You are somebody here, not just a number. I’m studying Health Sciences and know that VTSU will prepare me well in the years ahead so I can get a good job and make a difference in my community.”\n\nMore information will be forthcoming throughout the summer as more students make their final decisions.
