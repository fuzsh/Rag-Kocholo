This early history is obscured by the fact that the first animals were soft-bodied and left only enigmatic fossils. Here we take a comparative genomic approach to inferring the early evolutionary history of early animals and the subsequent events that gave rise to vertebrates. We show that, with a few notable exceptions, animal chromosomes are remarkably stable and evolved slowly over hundreds of millions of years, and that some gene linkages extend even further back to before the first animals. We then use these deeply conserved aspects of genome organization to (1) show that ctenophores rather than sponges are the earliest branching lineage of living animals, which has implications for the evolution of nervous systems, and (2) decipher the history of Paleozoic polyploidy and promiscuity in our vertebrate lineage.\n\n* Ted Chiang, Exhalation\n\n3:30 | Foege Auditorium | flier | seminar recording\n\n4/3/24 -

Despite continual progress in the cataloging of these elements, little is known about the code and grammatical rules that govern their function. Deciphering the code and their grammatical rules will enable high-resolution mapping of regulatory elements, accurate interpretation of nucleotide variation within them and the design of sequences that can deliver molecules for therapeutic purposes. To this end, we are using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) to simultaneously test the activity of thousands of gene regulatory elements in parallel. By designing MPRAs to learn regulatory grammar or to carry out saturation mutagenesis of nucleotide changes in disease causing gene regulatory elements, we are increasing our understanding of the phenotypic consequences of gene regulatory mutations. Regulatory elements can also serve as therapeutic targets. By targeting regulatory elements via CRISPR activation (CRISPRa), we show that they can be used to rescue a variety of haploinsufficient diseases (having ~50% dosage reduction due to having only one functional allele). In addition, we have taken advantage of CRISPRa to engineer adipocytes and adipose organoids to outcompete tumors for nutrients, showing that they can be used as a novel cancer therapy, termed Adipose Manipulation Transplantation (AMT).\n\n4/19/23 - Dr. Rupa Sridharan | University of Wisconsin\n\n\"Identifying cell state transitions in the acquisition of pluripotency\"\n\nAbstract:\n\nPluripotent stem cells have the unique ability to differentiate into any cell type given the correct stimulus. Pluripotency can be induced from somatic cells at a low efficiency of ~5% with the over expression of the Yamanaka transcription factors.\n\nUsing a rationally designed combination of small molecules that modify the somatic epigenome to resemble that of pluripotent cells we increased mouse reprogramming efficiency to ~42%. Gene regulatory network analysis of scRNA-seq in this system revealed that Â pluripotency genes can be activated even with residual somatic expression. scATAC-seq analysis identified transcription factors that are essential for specific cell fate transitions during reprogramming.Further using a newly developed computational method scCISINT weÂ identify putative enhancers that are essential for gaining pluripotency.\n\nOne of the epigenetic small molecules that increase reprogramming efficiency is an inhibitor of the histone H3K79 methyltransferase, DOT1L. In somatic cells H3K79me2 is enriched on highly expressed genes proportional to gene activity. In contrast, we find that pluripotent stem cells enforce low H3K79me levels to facilitate RNA polymerase II elongation that leads to greater nascent RNA accumulation. Mechanistically, DOT1L inhibition causes a local gain of histone acetylation at genes that lose the most H3K79me, which unexpectedly are ubiquitously expressed genes that perform essential functions in every cell. Maintenance of this elevated histone acetylation is required for the enhanced conversion of somatic to induced pluripotent stem cells. Together, we discover a high H3/H4ac - low H3K79me bivalent domain that promotes hypertranscription and transcription elongation at ubiquitously expressed genes to enforce cell identity.\n\n4/18/23 - Dr. Barak Cohen | Washington University\n\n\"Integration of Cis-Regulatory Information in the Genome\"\n\n3:30 | Foege Auditorium | flier\n\nAbstract:\n\nMost heritable disease-causing variation resides in the non-coding portions of the genome. Interpreting this variation will require quantitative models that describe how cis-regulatory sequences specify expression in the genome. To generate the input data for such models we have been developing high-throughput assays that measure the activities of cis-regulatory elements at scale. One focus has been determining the DNA sequence features that distinguish bona fide regulatory elements from spurious collections of transcription factor binding sites. Because most genes are controlled by multiple enhancers, silencers, and insulators we are also trying to determine when cis-regulatory sequences contribute independently to expression and when they interact in more complex ways. Ultimately, we hope to understand how the constellation of cis-regulatory sequences in a gene's non-coding DNA controls its expression and to predict the effects of genetic variants in these sequences.\n\nThursday, 4/13/23 - Dr. Samantha Morris | Washington University\n\n\"New Genomic Technologies to Deconstruct and Control Cell Identity\"\n\n3:30 | Foege Auditorium | flier\n\nAbstract:\n\nA mechanistic understanding of how cell identity is established and maintained is fundamental to the precise engineering of cell fate. Here, I will present new genomic technologies developed by my lab to permit single-cell lineage tracing throughout reprogramming, accompanied by recording of transcription factor binding and chromatin accessibility profiling. Integrating this information using our unique computational tools for interrogating gene regulatory networks delivers a systems-level understanding of how cell identity can be manipulated via lineage reprogramming. We also apply these methods to understand how cell identity is naturally programmed during differentiation and development. The deconstruction of cell identity via these approaches supports precision engineering of cell fate\n\n4/12/23 - Dr. Benjamin Wolfe | Tufts University\n\n\"Evolution in your kitchen: how microbes adapt to fermented food environments\"\n\nflier | lunch discussion hosted by Leah Anderson and Candice Young\n\nMonday, 4/10/23 - Dr. Marco Marra | University of British Columbia\n\n\"The Genomics of Treatment-Resistant Cancers\"\n\n3:30 | Foege Auditorium | flier\n\nAbstract:\n\nTwo decades of cancer genome science have revealed unanticipated DNA sequence-level heterogeneity across cancers. To personalize cancer therapies, state of the art approaches, capable of revealing genomic heterogeneity on a case-by-case basis, are required. I will provide a brief overview of British Columbia's Personlized OncoGenomics (POG) program, in which whole genome and transcriptome sequencing are being used to inform cancer patient treatment planning. I will also discuss how newer genomic technologies, including single cell sequencing, may be used to study unappreciated genomic and phenotypic heterogeneity that may be relevant to precision cancer genomic medicine.\n\nThursday, 4/6/23 - Dr. Junhyong Kim | University of Pennsylvania\n\n“Everything everywhere all at once: Towards subcellular omics and the theory of cell type”\n\n3:30 | Foege Auditorium | flier | seminar recording\n\nAbstract:\n\nSingle cell biology has undergone remarkable progress in the last fifteen years. In this talk, I will first briefly touch on early history of single cell biology. Then, I will present our work on subcellular localization of mRNA and the evolution of localization in mammalian neurons in which we find evidence of rapid evolutionary substitutions of localized genes. Our interest in subcellular processes led to establishing a NHGRI funded Center for Subcellular Genomics, where we are developing new techniques for subcellular assays as well as discovering novel patterns of subcellular genomic variation. I will present an overview of our work and recent analysis of within-organelle variation in mitochondria. Lastly, I discuss our current work in developing unsupervised learning methods as well as deep learning approaches to understanding single cell variation motivated by geometric considerations of biological proces\n\n4/5/23 -Dr. Danny Miller | University of Washington\n\n\"Streamlined genetic testing: the promise of long-read sequencing\"\n\nflier\n\nMonday, 4/3/23 - Dr. Frederick Roth | University of Toronto\n\n“Studies in Contextual Genomics”\n\n3:30 | Health Sciences T-625 | flier\n\nAbstract:\n\nWe have sequenced the genomes of many humans and of diverse species, entering what some have called the “post-genomic era”. However, nearly every possible single-nucleotide human variant already exists in someone alive today, and our ability to interpret individual genomes remains profoundly limited. To diagnose, prevent and treat genetic disease, we should therefore strive to know the functional impact of every variant. Adding to the challenge, the impact of a variant often depends on environmental or genetic context. Given the combinatorial complexity of these contexts, the accuracy with which we can infer phenome from genome will ultimately depend on a mechanistic understanding of the function of organismal systems. First, I'll describe how improved computational inference of missense variant effects can reveal new evidence for gene/trait associations. Second, I'll describe systematic experimental mapping of variant effect landscapes for the enzyme MTHFR under different environmental and genetic contexts. Third, I'll describe a study of often-high-order and environment dependent genetic interactions amongst ABC transporters. Finally, I'll describe proteome-scale protein interaction mapping under different environmental contexts. These studies will highlight the value of blending computational and experimental technology with both model organism and human genetics and support the idea that the genomic era has only just begun.\n\n3/29/23 - Dr. Mona Singh | Princeton University\n\n\"Predicting the impact of protein mutations: from interaction specificity to cancer\"\n\nflier | lunch discussion hosted by Lincoln Harris, Melih Yilmaz, and Xavi Guitart\n\n3/8/23 - Dr. Ian Ehrenreich | University of Southern California\n\n\"Characterizing genotype-phenotype relationships in yeast using CRISPRi and chromosome synthesis\"\n\nflier\n\n3/1/23 - Dr. Sizun Jiang | Harvard Medical School\n\nâInterrogating Host-Disease Interactions in situâ\n\nflier\n\n2/15/23 - Dr. Nancy Chen | University of Rochester\n\n\"Tracking short-term evolution in a pedigreed wild population\"\n\nflier | WiGS-invited speaker\n\n2/8/23 - Dr. Gregory Cooper | HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology\n\n“Genomic approaches to the diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders”\n\nflier\n\n2/1/23 - Dr. Nicholas Banovich | Translational Genomics Research Institute\n\nâUsing single cell and spatial genomics to dissect the molecular underpinnings of pulmonary fibrosisâ\n\nflier\n\n1/25/23 - Dr. Chia-Lin Wei | The Jackson Laboratory\n\n“Advancing Genomic Technologies for Insights into Genome Organization and Transcription”\n\nflier\n\n1/18/23 - Dr. Eimear Kenny | Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai\n\n\"Population Genetics in an Era of Genomic Health\"\n\nflier\n\n1/4/23 - Dr. Tomi Pastinen | University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine\n\nâGenomics of rare and functional variation in diseaseâ\n\nflier\n\n11/30/22 - Dr. John Ray | Benaroya Research Institute\n\n\"Discovering genetic mechanisms of immune-mediated diseases\"\n\n3:30 | Foege Auditorium\n\n11/16/22 - Dr. Melissa Gymrek | UC San Diego\n\n“Dissecting the role of the repeat-ome in complex traits”\n\n3:30\n\n11/16/22 - Dr. Ahna Skop | University of Wisconsin\n\n\"Too Creative for Science\"\n\n1:30 | Foege Auditorium | flier\n\nsponsored by Genome Sciences, MCB, and GSEE\n\n11/10/22 & 11/11/22 - Genome Sciences Symposium\n\nrecording will be posted when it is available\n\n11/2/22 - Dr. Sina Ghaemmaghami | University of Rochester\n\n\"Global Analysis of Protein Folding Stabilities\"\n\nflier\n\nlunch discussion hosted by Alexis Chang, Chris Hsu, and Chris McGann\n\n10/26/22 - Dr. Andrew Ellington | University of Texas\n\n\"Is a blind watchmaker the same as a blind neural net?\"\n\n10/12/22 - Dr. Eszter Posfai | Princeton University\n\n\"Advancing genome engineering in early mouse embryos\"\n\ntalk will not be recorded\n\nlunch discussion hosted by Wei Yang and Austin Gabel\n\n10/5/22 - Dr. David Stern | Janelia\n\n\"Toward a mechanistic understanding of plant gall induction by aphids\"\n\nflier\n\nvideo abstract | abstract:\n\nInsect plant galls are beautifully patterned atypical plant growths that provide the insects with enhanced nutrition and protection from environmental vicissitudes, predators, and parasites (Mani, 1964). Around 300 B.C., the Greek philosopher and founder of botany Theophrastus described ten kinds of insect galls found on oak trees and discussed their economic uses (Senn, 1942). Probably at least since that time, students of natural history have wondered how insect galls are formed. Are they a plant “wound response” or an “extended phenotype” of the attacking organism (Dawkins, 1982)? We have discovered that gall-inducing aphids inject hundreds of Bicycle proteinsâa new family of proteins specific to aphids and scale insectsâdirectly into plant cells during gall development (Korgaonkar et al. 2021; Stern & Han 2022). I will present genetic evidence that Bicycle proteins contribute to gall development and describe our efforts to identify the molecular mode of action of these novel proteins.\n\nDawkins, Richard.

Recently, long-read sequencing and assembly methods have enabled reconstruction of complete centromeric and pericentromeric sequences, providing an unprecedented opportunity to study their organization, evolution, and function. In order to fully leverage these complete assemblies, we have created and applied new sequence analysis tools to reveal the organization and evolutionary relationships of human satellite DNA sequences. We also developed DiMeLo-seq, a long-read, single-molecule method for mapping protein-DNA interactions, and we applied it to measure the density of CENP-A containing nucleosomes across human centromeres. These efforts revealed strong associations between low CpG methylation, high CENP-A density, and the very recent expansion of underlying satellite repeats, raising important questions about the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms responsible for these associations.\n\n5/25/22 - Dr. Andrea Gomez | UC Berkeley\n\n\"Alternative splicing choices for synaptic function\"\n\n3:30 | Foege Auditorium | flier\n\nGSAIMS-invited speaker | lunch discussion hosted by Valentina Grillo Alvarado\n\n5/18/22 - Dr. Andre Green | University of Michigan\n\n\"Making a Migratory Monarch\"\n\nFoege Auditorium | flier | student-invited speaker\n\nlunch discussion hosted by Lilian Heil\n\nAbstract: Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) are renowned for their annual transcontinental migration where they fly thousands of miles each fall to overwinter at specific sites in central Mexico. How did this phenotype evolve? One of our approaches to this question is to study the unique features of monarch migration. The mechanisms (behavioral, genetic, and molecular) required for migrants to perform this trip, particularly to naÃ¯vely identify their overwintering sites with remarkably high fidelity, are unknown.

Dr. Ellen Clayton\n\nVanderbilt University\n\n“The Evolving Ecology of Genetic Privacy”\n\nseminar lunch paper discussion led by Danielle Faivre | talk will be streamed via Zoom\n\nFor years, the debate about genetic privacy focused on two major issues: 1) that genetic information in the medical record would be used to deny people insurance and employment; and 2) that people would try to identify someone from de-identified DNA. In this talk, I will address the impact of several major changes that both change and broaden the debate. A growing amount of research that can be conducted without any consent, and the pressure for broad data sharing continues to mount, raising questions about control of downstream use. Giant databases are being created. Research is occurring in more diverse settings, which vary in their institutional oversight. Direct to consumer genetic testing has exploded, and a large number of people who post their identified genomic data online, typically to find previously unknown relatives, which may or may not be well received. Forensic genetic genealogy is front page news. The Affordable Care Act may fail. The European Union enacted the General Data Protection Regulation, while the US takes a more piecemeal approach to privacy protection. I will suggest how these and other developments affect genetic privacy.\n\nFebruary 19 - Dr. Suzanne McGaugh\n\nUniversity of Minnesota\n\n\"Little blind cavefish lead to big evolutionary insights\"\n\nflier | talk will be streamed via Zoom\n\nFebruary 12 - Dr. Maulik Patel\n\nVanderbilt University\n\n\"Beyond the cellular powerhouse: Biology of the mitochondrial genome\"\n\nseminar lunch paper discussion led by Kate Dusenbury | flier | talk will not be streamed\n\nWednesday, February 12 - Dr. Kathy Niakan\n\n\"Genome editing and single cell approaches to study early lineage specification in human embryos\"\n\n11:00, Foege Auditorium\n\nObstetrics & Gynecology, Genome Sciences, ISCRM - joint faculty candiate seminar | flier\n\nFebruary 5 - Dr. Hannes Rost\n\nUniversity of Toronto\n\n\"Developing the tools for the personalized medicine revolution: Using mass spectrometry for longitudinal molecular profiling\"\n\n3:30, Foege Auditorium | seminar lunch paper discussion led by Deanna Plubell | flier | talk will be streamed via Zoom\n\nFebruary 5 - Dr. Jason Sheltzer\n\nâGenetic approaches to study cancer progression and drug specificityâ\n\nfaculty candidate seminar | flier\n\n1:30, Foege Auditorium\n\nWednesday, February 5 - Dr. Jian Shu\n\n\"Cell Fate Plug and Play: from Totipotency to Pluripotency to the Placenta\"\n\n11:00, Foege Auditorium\n\nObstetrics & Gynecology, Genome Sciences, ISCRM - joint faculty candiate seminar | flier\n\nJanuary 29 - Dr. Vagheesh Narasimhan\n\n\"Using ancient DNA to understand human population structure, natural selection and life history traits over the past 10,000 years”\n\nfaculty candidate seminar | flier\n\nJanuary 22 - Dr. Alison Feder\n\nâEvolutionary dynamics under strong population genetic forces: HIV drug resistance through space and timeâ\n\nfaculty candidate seminar | flier\n\nJanuary 15 - Dr. Margarida Cardoso-Moreira\n\n“Origins and evolution of organs”\n\nfaculty candidate seminar | flier\n\nWednesday, January 15 - Dr. Francesca Cole\n\n\"How chromosome structure and recombination ensure homolog segregation in mammalian meiosis\"\n\n11:00, Health Sciences T-639\n\nObstetrics & Gynecology, Genome Sciences, ISCRM - joint faculty candiate seminar | flier\n\nJanuary 8 - Dr. Melissa Ilardo\n\nâAdaptation to Extremes: Sea Nomads and Evolutionary Genomicsâ\n\nfaculty candidate seminar | flier\n\nAutumn 2019\n\nDecember 4 - Dr. Stephen Montgomery\n\nStanford University\n\n“Functional genomics to interpret common and rare genetic diseases”\n\nseminar lunch paper discussion led by Nick Popp\n\nNovember 20 - Dr. Gary Karpen\n\nUC Berkeley\n\n“Heterochromatin Formation, Function and Evolution\"\n\ntalk will be streamed via Zoom | flier\n\nThursday, November 14 - Dr. David Kelley\n\nCalico labs\n\n\"Sequential regulatory activity prediction across species with convolutional neural networks\"\n\n3:00, Foege Auditorium | flier\n\nNovember 13 - Dr. Samuel Wasser\n\nUniversity of Washington\n\n\"Intelligence-led forensic science: Combatting the illegal wildlife trade amidst a burgeoning world market\"\n\nflier\n\nMajor transnational organized crimes have grown dramatically over the past decade, coincident with massive increases in legal containerized cargo shipped worldwide. Wildlife traffickers are capitalizing on these legal shipments to conceal their contraband cargo. This is depleting targeted non-renewable wildlife populations and their habitat at a frightening pace. Â Intelligence-led forensic science that capitalizes on genetic divergence between wildlife populations offers a valuable way forward. Genetic divergence can be used to determine the origin of poached material, identify poaching hotspots, and even identify wildlife products derived from the same individual or family group shipped in separate consignments by the same trafficker. This talk describes how our lab uses such genetic tools to track changes in Africa’s major ivory poaching hotspots, as well as the number, scale and connectivity of the major transnational criminal organizations smuggling ivory out of Africa. These tools enable law enforcement to target the illegal ivory trade before the contraband enters transit where it becomes far more difficult and expensive to trace. Results are also empowering financial crime investigations into these criminal networks, which is one of the most powerful tools available to identify, interdict, disrupt and dismantle transnational criminal organizations.\n\nFriday, November 8 -

Identifying the network of interactions among regulatory factors, the chromatin network, is of paramount importance in understanding epigenome regulation.\n\nMethods: We developed a novel computational approach, ChromNet, to infer the chromatin network from a set of ChIP-seq datasets. ChromNet has four key features that enable its use on large collections of ChIP-seq data. First, rather than using pairwise co-localization of factors along the genome, ChromNet identifies conditional dependence relationships that better discriminate direct and indirect interactions. Second, our novel statistical technique, the group graphical model, improves inference of conditional dependence on highly correlated datasets. Such datasets are common because some transcription factors form a complex and the same transcription factor is often assayed in different laboratories or cell types. Third, ChromNet's computationally efficient method allows joint network learning across across 115 cell types, which greatly increases the scope of possible interactions. Finally, the genomic context causing any network edge can be inferred to aid understanding.\n\nResults: We applied ChromNet to all available ChIP-seq data from the ENCODE Project, consisting of 1,451 ChIP-seq datasets, which revealed previously known physical interactions better than alternative approaches. ChromNet also identified previously unreported regulatory factor interactions. We experimentally validated one of these interactions, between the MYC and HCFC1 transcription factors.\n\nDiscussion: ChromNet provides a useful tool for understanding the interactions among regulatory factors and identifying novel interactions. We have provided an interactive web-based visualization of the full ENCODE chromatin network and the ability to incorporate custom datasets at http://chromnet.cs.washington.edu.\n\nFebruary 3 - Dr. Eric Alm\n\nMIT\n\n\"Bugs as Drugs: Lessons learned from the use of fecal transplants to cure recurrent Clostridium difficile infection\"\n\nflier\n\nJanuary 27 - Dr. Nicole King\n\nUC Berkeley\n\n\"Bacteria as master regulators of choanoflagellate multicellularity and mating\"\n\nflier\n\nJanuary 20 - Dr. Daniel Voytas\n\nUniversity of Minnesota\n\npostdoctoral trainee-invited speaker\n\n\"The genome engineering revolution and plant agriculture\"\n\nflier\n\nJanuary 13 - Dr. Jeff Barrick\n\nUniversity of Texas\n\n\"Evolutionary opportunities and obstacles in synthetic biology\"\n\nflier\n\nJanuary 6 - Dr. Stephen Jones\n\nWashington State University\n\n\"Chromosomes, Community and Bread\"\n\nflier\n\nand related symposium:\n\nBread Lab Symposium\n\nWednesday, January 6th\n\n1:30-3:15, Foege Auditorium\n\nTalks from Bread Lab (http://thebreadlab.wsu.edu/) grad students Bethany Econopouly, Colin Curwen-McAdams, and Brigid Meints, followed by talks from Ingrid Swanson Pultz (Institute for Protein Design), and grad students and post docs from the Dunham and Fowler labs\n\nAutumn 2015\n\nDecember 9 - Dr. Marta Luksza\n\nInstitute for Advanced Study\n\n\"Predicting the evolution for influenza\"\n\nflier\n\nDecember 2 - Dr. Elissa Hallem\n\nUCLA\n\n\"The neural basis of parasitic behaviors\"\n\nflier\n\nNovember 18 - Dr. Chris Marx\n\nUniversity of Idaho\n\n\"Novel induction of cell stasis to protect the cell from a toxic central metabolic intermediate\"\n\nflier\n\nThursday, November 12 - Dr. Robert Sclafani\n\nUniversity of Colorado\n\n“Exploitation of DNA Replication Stress and Repair Mechanisms for Cancer Chemoprevention”\n\nflier\n\nTuesday, November 10 - Mia Levy, MD, PhD\n\nDirector of Cancer Clinical Informatics and Ingram Assistant Professor of Cancer Research, Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center\n\nAssistant Professor of Biomedical Informatics and Medicine, Vanderbilt University\n\n\"Integrated genomic approaches to identify cancer targets\"\n\nNovember 4 - Dr. Jeanne Lawrence\n\nUniversity of Massachusetts Medical School\n\n\"Regulating the Epigenome via Chromosomal RNAs: Implications for Genome Biology and Chromosome Pathology\"\n\nOctober 28 - Dr. Christopher Link\n\nUniversity of Colorado\n\n“TDP-43, RNA metabolism, and ALS”\n\nOctober 21 - Dr. Susan Rosenberg\n\nBaylor College of Medicine\n\n“How bacteria and cancer cells regulate mutagenesis and their ability to evolve”\n\nOctober 14 - Dr. Kirsten Bomblies\n\nHarvard University\n\n“Adaptive evolution of meiosis in Arabidopsis arenosa”\n\nOctober 7 - Dr. Andrew Ellington\n\nUniversity of Texas\n\nSeptember 30 - Dr. Melissa Kemp\n\nGeorgia Tech\n\nSummer 2015\n\nAugust 19 - Dr. Rick McLaughlin\n\nMalik Lab, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center\n\n\"The coevolution of primates and endogenous retroelements: conflict and co-option\"\n\nSpring 2015\n\nJune 10 - Dr. Karen Avraham\n\nTel Aviv University\n\n\"Genomics of Hereditary Hearing Impairment\"\n\nseminar flier\n\nMay 27 - Dr. Alexander Stark\n\nResearch Institute of Molecular Pathology\n\n“Decoding transcriptional regulation in Drosophila”\n\nMay 20 - Dr. Adam Arkin\n\nUC Berkeley\n\n\"Knowledge, Context and Process: Building a Foundational Infrastructure for Engineering Cells for Use in an Uncertain World \"\n\nMonday, May 11 - Dr. Craig Mello\n\nUniversity of Massachusetts;
