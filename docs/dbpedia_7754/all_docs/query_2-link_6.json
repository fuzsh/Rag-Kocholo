        "text": "American statistician (1936–2019)\n\nCharles \"Chuck\" Joel Stone (July 13, 1936 – April 16, 2019) was an American statistician and mathematician.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nCharles Joel Stone was born and raised in Los Angeles.[1] After secondary school at North Hollywood High School, Stone graduated with a Bachelor of Science in science from the California Institute of Technology in 1958.[2][3] He then matriculated at Stanford University, where in 1961 he received his PhD in statistics. His PhD thesis Limit Theorems for Birth and Death Processes and Diffusion Processes was supervised by Samuel Karlin.[4][5]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom 1962 to 1964 Stone was an assistant professor in the mathematics department of Cornell University. From 1964 1981 to he was a faculty member of the mathematics department of UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles), where he worked extensively with Leo Breiman (who moved to Berkeley in 1980) and Sidney Charles Port (born 1935).[1] In the statistics department of the University of California, Berkeley, Stone was from 1981 a full professor, a position which he held until his retirement as professor emeritus.[3]\n\nWhen they were professors at UCLA, Stone and Breiman consulted for Technology Services Corporation in Santa Monica. Based on their work, they co-authored a 1978 technical report, Parsimonious Binary Classification Trees, Elaborating on the report, in 1984 they published, with two more co-authors, Jerome H. Friedman and Richard Allen Oshlen (born 1942), a greatly expended version entitled Classification and Regression Trees.[3]\n\nIn addition to research on statistical algorithms, Stone did research on potential theory, \"local limit theorems, weak convergence of stochastic processes, and renewal theory.\"[3]\n\nStone was the advisor for 14 doctoral students, including Probal Chaudhuri, Michael P. Cohen, Mark Henry Hansen, and James Stephen \"Steve\" Marron.[4] Stone was a Guggenheim Fellow for the academic year 1980–1981.[6] In 1986 he was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berkeley, California.[7] He was elected a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics in 1970 [8] and a Fellow of the Class of 2013 (announced in 2012) of the American Mathematical Society. He was elected a Member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1993.[9]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nIn June 1966 he married Barbara L. Cohn in Los Angeles. They had two sons.[3]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nStone died on April 16, 2019.[3]\n\nSelected publications\n\n[edit]\n\nArticles\n\n[edit]\n\nStone, Charles (1963). \"Weak convergence of stochastic processes defined on semi-infinite time intervals\".
