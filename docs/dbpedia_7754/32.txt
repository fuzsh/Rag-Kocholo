Biography

Sam Baugh started as an Assistant Professor of Statistics at Penn State in Fall 2023. Previously, he completed an NSF postdoctoral research fellowship at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab under the supervision of Dr. Mark Risser, and received his Ph.D. in Statistics from Professor Karen McKinnon at UCLA in 2022. He also completed his MS in Statistics and BS in Mathematics at the University of Chicago advised by Professor Michael Stein. His research is motivated by developing statistical methods for understanding the impacts of climate change, including long-term changes in the oceans and atmosphere as well as changes in the probabilities of extreme events. HIs primary methodological areas are in spatio-temporal statistics, Bayesian hierarchical models, and computational approximations. He is also works in Bayesian methods for psychometric modeling problems, and has collaborations in medicine and public health.
