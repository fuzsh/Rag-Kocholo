        "text": "In 1781, Gen Chao Phraya went on the campaigns against Cambodia, only to return prematurely due to the instability caused by a rebellion which deposed the ruler King Taksin. In 1782, Gen Chao Phraya defeated the rebels and then executed the ousted Taksin. He seized power and made himself King, establishing the Chakri Dynasty, which continues to rule Thailand to this day.\n\nChakri Kings of Thailand\n\nRama I, the Great (1782–1809), Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke (ruled 27 years)\n\nRama II (1809–1824), Buddha Loetla Nabhalai (15 years)\n\nRama III (1824–1851), Nangklao (27 years)\n\nRama IV (1851–1868), Mongkut (17 years)\n\nRama V, the Great, (1868–1910), Chulalongkorn (42 years)\n\nRama VI (1910–1925), Vajiravudh (15 years)\n\nRama VII (1925–1935), Prajadhipok (10 years)\n\nRama VIII (1935–1946), Ananda Mahidol (11 years)\n\nRama IX, the Great (since 1946, coronation 5 May 1950), Bhumibol Adulyadej\n\nNobody knows what kind of ruler Prince Vajiralongkorn would be. Many believe that Prince Vajiralongkorn will replace the Privy Council with his own men. One reason why Prince Vajiralongkorn is distrusted in military circles is his past association with Mr Thaksin who was said to have lavished money on the prince. That may have been the real reason for the coup which overthrew Thaksin,, which appeared to have the blessing of Prem Tinsulanonda, the chairman of the Privy Council and thus the king's chief adviser.\n\nAn old prophecy holds that the Chakri dynasty will last only nine generations. King Bhumibol is Rama IX. Republican voices are rising to the surface—unreported in Thailand's pliant media.\n\nWithin palace circles, however, there is a dawning realisation that change is coming. Senior royalists know that King Bhumibol's charisma and influence will not easily transfer to his successor.\n\nWill the 'reincarnation' of king Taksin return to claim his throne?\n\nits funny that theThe crown prince has military experience and led troops in battle during Vietnam war I think but is unpopular with the milirary. Also considering he is a flirt etc does not boad well for him and he not popular with the people. The one that is popular is his sister, but she not next in line to the throne,,.and if the privy council and royal family continue on this yellow shirt nonsense, the monarchy will fall.\n\nIn 1781, Gen Chao Phraya went on the campaigns against Cambodia, only to return prematurely due to the instability caused by a rebellion which deposed the ruler King Taksin.
