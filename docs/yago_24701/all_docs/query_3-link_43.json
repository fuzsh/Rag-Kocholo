        "text": "Introduction\n\nWat Chaloem Phra Kiat Waraviharn is located in Nonthaburi on west side of the Chao Phraya River. The temple is just next to the Chaloem Kanchanaphisek Park. This was the name when I visited the park last time. But now it seems to have been renamed to Chaloem Golden Jubilee Park. And the area is an eBird hotspot: called: Chaloem Kanchanaphisek Park & Wat Chaloem Phra Kiat Worawiharn\n\nThis is the only place in Bangkok where I have seen Parakeets. And when I have been here the most interesting area is at the temple area and the parking area along the Chao Phraya River.\n\nGuide\n\nI usually don't use any bird watching Guide in / around Bangkok. But could be a good idea to have a Guide to help me identify all the birds I see. As it is now my eBird checklists are not very impressive as I can only ID half of the birds I see\n\nLand transportation\n\nThe most convinient way is of course to go by taxi. About 30 minutes from Sukhumvit/ Askok area early in the morning. Around 5 thirty that is. And it set you back by 250 Baht (8 to 9 US Dollars) I think the temple (wat in Thai) is more famous than the park and I ask the taxi to take me to Wat Chaloem Phrakiat Worawihan.\n\nName in Thai for the taxi driver:\n\nWat Chaloem Phrakiat Worawihan in Thai script: à¸§à¸±à¸à¹à¸à¸¥à¸´à¸¡à¸à¸£à¸°à¹à¸à¸µà¸¢à¸£à¸à¸´à¸§à¸£à¸§à¸´à¸«à¸²à¸£\n\nChaloem Golden Jubilee Park in Thai script: à¸­à¸¸à¸à¸¢à¸²à¸à¹à¸à¸¥à¸´à¸¡à¸à¸²à¸à¸à¸à¸²à¸ à¸´à¹à¸©à¸\n\nYou can take the Chao Phraya Express Boat to pier N30 NONTHABURI on the eastern side of the river. From there you can cross the river on a small boat. More information at www.chaophrayaexpressboat.com\n\nYou can walk from the ferry pier, 15 minutes or so and you can look for birds on the way. You can also take a motorcycle taxi from the ferry terminal and then you will be there in 2 minutes.\n\nGOING BACK HOME!!! I use to send a motorcycle taxi to get a taxi as there is not many taxis around.\n\nEquipment\n\nCanon 5D Mk. III + Canon 5D Mk. IV\n\nCanon EF 28-300/3,5-5,6 L IS USM\n\nCanon EF 70-200/2,8L IS II USM\n\nCanon EF 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L IS II USM lens\n\nCanon Speedlite 600EXII-RT flash\n\nCanon PowerShot G7X Mark II\n\nPanasonic HC-W585 video camera\n\nSound recorder\n\nZOOM H5 Handy Recorder\n\nWeather / climate\n\nWeather, I donÂ´t know if Bangkok is the hottest capital in the world. But this is what they say and I have no reason to doubt this information because it is darn hot.\n\nBangkok, Thailand - Climate & Temperature\n\nPictures from www.climatemps.com\n\nBangkok, Thailand - Climate & Temperature - Click picture for full size\n\nPictures from www.climatemps.com\n\nReferences/Resources\n\nThai National Parks - About the National Parks in Thailand A very good web page - Do you know that there are still wild tigers, elephants, leopards, tapirs, gaurs, bears and many monkey species in many tropical rainforests across Thailand? Do you also know that around 10% of all marine species in the world can be found in Thailand? And the fact that Thailand is the best bird-watching destination in mainland Asia?\n\nNational parks are protected areas of land because they have unspoilt landscapes and a diverse number of native plants and animals. There are 127 national parks in Thailand, of them 22 marine national parks. These parks offers a diverse range of flora and fauna, home to important population of endangered species. So now it will be easy to find out if there are any National Park close to you.\n\nBird Conservation Society of Thailand (BCST) - The Bird Conservation Society of Thailand (BCST) is one of the oldest organisations conserving birds and nature in Thailand and is the country partner of BirdLife International. BCST's role to the local community is to spread awareness about urban birds and reconnect people back to nature.\n\nThe Logo\n\nDated back to 1986 when BCST was then a loosely-formed âBangkok Birdwatching Clubâ, the Oriental Magpie Robin (Copsychus saularis), or âNok Gang Ken Baanâ in Thai, has been chosen to represent the organisation.\n\nThere are two sites covering Thailand and I have used them many times. These two web pages are actually everything you need for your birding adventures in Thailand. All the information you need about all the birding spots. Click on the map and then select your spot and you will have maps and everything you need to know about the areas. They have put a lot of jobs in to their web pages, North Thailand Birding and thaibirding.com A must to visit before you go bird watching in Thailand.\n\nwww.norththailandbirding.com - A one stop only for all your birding in Thailand\n\nthaibirding.com - Nick Upton's one stop only for all your birding in Thailand.\n\nUse both www.thaibirding.com and www.norththailandbirding.com and you have a winner. Some of the maps on www.norththailandbirding.com are way better than Nick UptonÂ´s, while some of Nick's maps are much more detailed. So I have found that if I use both the web pages for information, well, nothing else needed.\n\nPBase/Peter Ericson - Peter Ericson, a guy I thought was from USA because of his family name. I met him at Lat Krabang Paddies in May 2020 and turned out that he was Swedish. Anyway, I have used his excellent page PBase since 2016 as help to ID birds by the help from his beautiful bird pictures.\n\nHere you can also find information about birding tours.\n\nHe is also having a Blog - Thaibirds and more with interesting information.\n\nBangkok City Birding - A lot of interesting birding stories and information on this bird watching blog by David Gandy. Bangkok-based patch-worker in Suan Rot Fai, a large park close to the city's famous weekend market. He have recorded 150 species on his patch since 2008. As one of the only big green spaces in the city, “SRF” acts as a real magnet for migrants during spring and autumn, and holds a healthy selection of \"sibes\" during the winter months.\n\nebird - Find birding hotspots with bird checklists from all over the world\n\nAvibase - is an extensive database information system about all birds of the world, containing over 25 million records about 10,000 species and 22,000 subspecies of birds, including distribution information for 12,000 regions, taxonomy, synonyms in several languages\n\nwww.oiseaux.net This web page is also excellent for identifying birds. There is information and range maps for many many birds from all over the world. This page is almost guaranteed to give you any answer you have about any bird in the world.\n\nCloudbirders - Read birding trip reports from all over the world\n\nFatbirder - Linking birders worldwide... Wildlife Travellers see their sister site: WAND\n\nFatbirder is a fantastic web page with information from, I think every country in the world. My first stop when I plan for my bird watching trips. There is information about locations and guides, well, pretty much everything you need to know. Sometimes this is the only place I need to visit to plan my trip.\n\nBirdingPal - find a birding Guide around the world\n\nAnd the web page you cannot live without. I have been around the world looking for birds. I usually have a Guide, but sometimes it is not possible to find a Guide. So, well, I have lost count on how many times I have had help to ID birds at BirdForum. Joining this forum have been very very good for my bird watching experience.\n\nwww.birdforum.net\n\nClimaTemps.com is the place to learn about the worlds climates with more than 4000 locations documented. Each aspect of the climate is represented using colour enhanced tables and professional graphs so that data can easily be compared by switching between locations in different tabs in your browser.\n\n“A Field Guide to the Birds of Thailand and South East Asia by Craig Robson”\n\nA Field Guide to the Birds of Thailand and South East Asia by Craig Robson. New edition updated with 76 species since previous edition âA Field Guide to the Birds of Thailand and South East Asia by Craigâ Nick Upton at www.thaibirding.com wrote âThis quite excellent book is packed full of quality illustrations and written information on 1251 species recorded in Southeast Asiaâ\n\nI bought this book for bird watching in Thailand, but it goes for all over SE Asia\n\nPlaces to visit\n\nWat Chaloem Phrakiat Worawihan & Chaloem Golden Jubilee Park\n\nWat Chaloem Phrakiat Worawihan\n\nAs the ancient temple, priceless, of Nonthaburi which older than 100 years. The King Jessadabodindra (Rama III) reign 3 (1824 â 1851) ordered to be built before death on Year 1847 at former dwelling of his grandfather, grandmother, and mother Sri Sulalai, which is to honour for all of the three person. And then, the King gave the name âWat Chaloem Phra Kiatâ and ordered to build a border wall and the four corner turrets, which is majestic scenery. Because of in the past, this area was once the site of the old fort before, the construction of the temple during the reign 3 has not been completed. Later, the reign 4 ordered to build it until finish. And, it was renovated to grace until now.\n\nThis temple, riverside of Chao Phraya, is famous for its beautiful architecture. That is, the church which has a mix of Thai-Chinese architectural styles as the kingâs likes. Within the church, the principle Buddha statue Mara Vichaya was placed, which cast up the body by copper by lap width of 6 elbows and height as 8 elbows 2 creeps 4 inches. The reign 4 gave the name âPhra Buddha Maha Logapinantapatimaâ.\n\nIn the south side is the grand sanctuary of Wat Chaloem Phra Kiat Worawihan, which is called âWiharn Sila Khaoâ. The reign 4 ordered to bring the principle Buddha statue âPhra Sila Khaoâ to place here in 1858. Nearby is also the site of the Phra Wiharn Luang, which is Thai-Chinese art as well, with âPhra Buddha Patima Chaiwatâ placed inside. On the back of the church, if looking out over that you can see the white pagoda stand out, this is the Lung-Ga style pagoda that height is 45 meters and putting inside with the Buddha dharma relics.\n\nOpening Hours: 06:00 - 18:00 every day\n\nAdmission: free\n\nLocation:\n\nà¸à¸­à¸¢ à¸§à¸±à¸à¹à¸à¸¥à¸´à¸¡à¸à¸£à¸°à¹à¸à¸µà¸¢à¸£à¸à¸´ à¸à¸³à¸à¸¥ à¸à¸²à¸à¸¨à¸£à¸µà¹à¸¡à¸·à¸­à¸ à¸à¸³à¸à¸¥à¸à¸¥à¸²à¸à¸à¸§à¸±à¸ à¸à¸à¸à¸à¸¸à¸£à¸µ 11000\n\nWat Chaloem Phrakiat Alley, Tambon Bang Sri Muang, Amphoe Mueang Nonthaburi, Chang Wat Nonthaburi 11000\n\nChaloem Golden Jubilee Park\n\nIt located at Soi Chalerm Phrakiat 13, next to Wat Chalerm Phrakiat Worawiharn with 100 rai land.

It also is a center of water plant, waterside plant, vegetation and several species of water animal.\n\nThe most remarkable thing in this park is the Wiman Saran Nawamin building standing in the middle of the pond. Not far away, there are Thai Style houses for relaxing and services, made of teakwood entirely.

Last time I was here it was possible to walk between the Wat Chaloem Phrakiat Worawihan and Chaloem Golden Jubilee Park. There was also snack places at the pier on the parking lot and they seems to be closed now. So bring water!\n\nThe nearest place to buy water is in the village behind the temple. The road leading to the parking area for the Chaloem Golden Jubilee Park. There is also shops to buy snacks and at the gate they were selling fresh coconuts. So bring water to last you while birding at the temple parking area.\n\nRoad to the temple parking and the river\n\nRoad to the temple parking and the river\n\nTemple parking at the river front\n\nSnacks area was closed\n\nNot possible to enter the park from the temple\n\nStarting on the parking and you go to the tree in the NE corner. The tree on your right hand side entering the parking area. You will find a lot of birds in this tree. Different barbets, Kingfishers, Parakeets and other birds enjoying whatever they are eating.\n\nThe area is full of the Red-breasted Parakeets and they are nesting in the area. So if you come here during this time you will see them feeding their young ones in the holes in the trees.\n\nWalk along the river and keep an eye out for egrets etc. When you reach the western part there is trees with more barbets and all the other birds. There is a wall and fence now so you cannot continue in to the park.\n\nEntering the temple area from the parking\n\nMany birds in the temple area\n\nThe area in front of the temple has a lot of birds to offer. And look up the trees as you can spot owlets. As you cannot walk between the park and the temple any more you need to walk around the temple. Takes 10 minutes to walk to the park entrance so it is not bad.\n\nAnd after the walk in the blazing sun you will be happy to learn that there are some shops with snacks and cold drinks. There are also a place where they sell fresh coconuts. Very refreshing after a long birding session in the sunshine.\n\nGate to Chaloem Golden Jubilee Park parking area\n\nChaloem Golden Jubilee Park parking area\n\nWalking across the parking area and you cross the walk bridge and youÂ´re in the park. Take to the right and you will pass the bathrooms. You will have a big pond on your left hand side when walking towards the eastern border to the temple area. In the pond you see the Wiman Saran Nawamin building in the middle of the pond.\n\nComing down to the water front and you have some scrub and trees and about 30 meters to the fence between the park and the temple. Look in the trees and the scrub for birds. Waterhens and small birds. I have seen the beautiful Pink-necked Pigeon in this area. Tailor birds and Prinias in the trees.\n\nWiman Saran Nawamin building\n\nSmall bridges to walk across the water all over the park\n\nA lot of water in the park\n\nIt is a beautiful park\n\nMy favourite areas in the park is the north eastern corner along the river and the fence towards the temple. And when you have crossed the park you come to the western side with scrub and more wilderness. No lawns and decorations. Of course, there are the loudspeakers and the annoying music they play.\n\nHere you can see herons and Indian Rolls etc. There are of course birds in the “maintained” park. Sunbirds, Munia and Oriental Magpies etc. I have also seen one Plaintive Cuckoo in one of the trees.\n\nWalking around the park is nice and you can see the boats passing on the river. But it is hot, very hot so bring water as I have not seen any water for sale in the park. Only at the entrance.\n\nWestern side of the park is a little bit more “wild”\n\nWestern side of the park is a little bit more “wild”\n\nWestern side of the park is a little bit more “wild”\n\nWestern side of the park is a little bit more “wild”\n\nReaching the western border of the park\n\nThe park is well worth a visit but if I had to choose between the park and the temple it would have been the temple area as I have seen more interesting birds there. But if time is no issue, do both areas. The temple area is not so nice to walk around in, but the park is beautiful.\n\nAnd I have seen the parakeet and Lineated Barbet every time at the temple. And keep an eye out in the trees, the only place where I have seen three Spotted Owlets sitting next to each others.\n\nBird checklist\n\nI never use any bird lists, but since I try to make it in to Cloudbirders. A very helpful site when planning your birding trips. But they ask for a bird checklist, and if I use their service, of course I want to contribute as well. My two first bird watching trip reports was rejected by Cloudbirders.\n\nSo I started to take ideas from the reports I found on Cloudbirders. So I have started to use bird lists, eBird generate one for me and I can post it on Cloudbirders. I will post my birds on eBird and on my different “BIRDS THAT I HAVE OBSERVED” pages.\n\nFull Thai list updated to the taxonomy, nomenclature and sequence of the IOU/IOC World Bird List. The complete checklist, including Thai names and synonyms, can be downloaded in Excel format - Thailand Bird Checklist. - Version 8.2 (2018) - found at www.norththailandbirding.com\n\nCheck lists can come in handy to find out the local name of the bird etc. And Avibase have a list with pictures and sounds, excellent!\n\nSo I will post bird checklists here and if my Guides provide me with checklists I will also post them here.\n\nBangkok Metropolis bird checklist from Avibase, click HERE - eBird version 2018 taxonomy\n\nAvibase is providing you with bird checklists from all over the world. And IÂ´m impressed by their web page. Select country and area and you get the bird checklist. Like the PDF files I got from Avibase on the links above. You also get the checklist with pictures and sounds.\n\nThe best part is that you get the local names of the birds and the online checklist gives the names in English plus the language you have selected. But it seems like the PDF cannot handle some alphabet.\n\nFor example the Japanese language so it is blank in the PDF checklist. But it worked excellent with Swedish. But you get them in the local language on the online version.\n\nBird list\n\nI only list birds I have got on picture on my list of OBSERVED BIRDS. But since I started using eBird I have changed a bit. I list all the birds on the eBird checklist. See the DAY TO DAY report in the itinerary below.\n\nAnd you can visit my list of “Birds I have seen in Thailand” ONLY BIRDS I HAVE ON PICTURE.\n\nMy eBird check list from Wat Chaloem 23rd of June, click HERE\n\nTrip Report\n\nTodayÂ´s track\n\nGetting out of the taxi at 7 oÂ´clock and I started the eBird app. I was late as I had slept longer than I wanted to. I started to explore the parking and it didnÂ´t took long before I had seen several Red-breasted Parakeets. There were many of them in the three on the right hand side entering the parking area. And one Lineated Barbet was sitting in the tree as well.\n\nBut the pictures didnÂ´t turned out as good as I had been hoping for as the birds was between me and the sun. I take a few pictures to see if I can do anything with the lighting when IÂ´m back home.\n\nWalking towards the fence at the west side of the parking and there is a lot of the mynas, Great and Common. Malaysian Pied-fantails and sparrows. So there is a little to look at while walking between the trees. I spotted the beautiful Pink-necked pigeon, looked to be a couple but I could not come close as the fence to the park blocked my way.\n\nOne Little Egret watching over the river when I walked back towards the parking along the river. What a disappointment with the closed snack stall as it was hot and I was really thirsty. Go back home or walk to the park? I really donÂ´t know how to get to the park as when I was here last time I walked between the park and temple area.\n\nRed-breasted Parakeet / à¸à¸à¹à¸à¸à¹à¸à¹à¸² feeding on fruit\n\nRed-breasted Parakeet / à¸à¸à¹à¸à¸à¹à¸à¹à¸² feeding on fruit\n\nRed-breasted Parakeet / à¸à¸à¹à¸à¸à¹à¸à¹à¸² feeding on fruit\n\nRed-breasted Parakeet / à¸à¸à¹à¸à¸à¹à¸à¹à¸² feeding on fruit\n\nRed turtle dove / à¸à¸à¹à¸à¸²à¹à¸ (male)\n\nWalking up the road and I look down the soi behind the temple. I decide to try to walk down that way to see if I find the entrance to the park. Turned out to be quite close and about 10 minutes to walk from the parking at the temple to the park entrance. I had a few cold coconuts at the entrance and I bought water to bring with me in to the park.\n\nAnd it was very nice with the coconuts in the heat, pounding sun and really no place to take cover from it. Walking across the parking and over the small walk bridge and I was in the park. Walking towards the fence between the temple and the park and I see Sunbirds, Prinias and a White-breasted Waterhen in the scrub.\n\nThen walking towards the west side and after 10 minutes you reach the wilderness at the western side of the park. I spotted a snake at Bang Pu yesterday so I was really not in a mood to venture out in the scrubs. Usually see Kingfishers here but after the snake experience I stayed on the walk paths.\n\nPlain Prinia / à¸à¸à¸à¸£à¸°à¸à¸´à¸à¸«à¸à¹à¸²à¸ªà¸µà¹à¸£à¸µà¸¢à¸\n\nOlive-backed Sunbird and we can see the white in the tail\n\nI could not identify the sunbirds until I came home and saw the pictures. White in the tail and it is a female Olive-backed Sunbird and not a female Brown-throated Sunbird. The white tail is a trick I learned on birdforum OPUS.\n\nChaloem Kanchanaphisek Park & Wat Chaloem Phra Kiat Worawiharn, Nonthaburi, TH Jun 23, 2019 7:04 AM - 9:20 AM\n\nProtocol: Traveling\n\n4.59 kilometer(s)\n\n20 species\n\nFeral Pigeon X\n\nRed Collared Dove 2\n\nSpotted Dove 3\n\nZebra Dove 5\n\nPink-necked Pigeon 2\n\nWhite-breasted Waterhen 1\n\nLittle Egret 1\n\nStriated Heron 1\n\nCoppersmith Barbet 6\n\nLineated Barbet 2\n\nRed-breasted Parakeet 25 Many\n\nMalaysian Pied-Fantail 4\n\nLarge-billed Crow 2\n\nStreak-eared Bulbul 9\n\nPlain Prinia 1\n\nOriental Magpie-Robin 19 All over\n\nCommon Myna X\n\nGreat Myna X\n\nOlive-backed Sunbird 3\n\nEurasian Tree Sparrow X\n\nScaly-breasted Munia X\n\nView this checklist online at https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S57608592\n\nI had a bottle of water while one of the motorcycle taxis went to get me a taxi, it had been a good morning and the afternoon promise to be good with boxing and yoga.
