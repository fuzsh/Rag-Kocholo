        "text": "Sri Sulalai\n\nChao Chom Manda Riam, later Krom Somdet Phra Sri Sulalai, was a royal concubine of King Buddha Loetla Nabhalai, the king of Siam. Her family was Muslim from the Southern part of the Kingdom, and her very name is the shortened version of \"Maryam\" an Arabic name. She married Prince Isarasundhorn as the second concubine and gave birth to Prince Tub in 1787. In 1809, Prince Isarasundhorn was crowned as King Buddha Loetla Nabhalai. Chao Chom Manda Riam then moved to the Royal Grand Palace and presided over the royal kitchen. Prince Jessadabodindra was trusted by the king to handle various state affairs. In 1824, King Buddha Loetla Nabhalai died. According to the tradition, the throne would go to Prince Mongkut, the son of Queen Sri Suriyendra. However, the nobility instead enthroned Prince Jessadabodindra because he had served the king in Krom Tha for years and was proved to be competent to rule. As her son was crowned, Chao Chom Manda Riam was raised to Krom Somdet Phra Sri Sulalai, thus a member of the royalty. She died in 1837."
