        "text": "… for centuries\n\n(History of Thailand)\n\n‘JJ’ Jeremy Johanson\n\nGenuine smiles emanate from deep inside. Founded in mutual respect, caring and trust, they take root in a spark of ‘warmth’ generated within the heart, whose outward glow turns up the corners of the lips on its journey to brighten the eyes. Adopting the tenets of Buddhism over 1750 years ago, with its five basic rules*for creating peace and harmony throughout society, has successfully navigated an entire nation through generations of trials and tribulations.\n\nToday, over 60 million people from more than 50 different ethnic groups live peacefully together in an open society centuries old… with a smile in their hearts.\n\nIN THE BEGINNING\n\nModern day Thailand is the result of natural progression – from pre-historic times till present – of the interaction between peoples of diverse origins; a succession of events that has created a prosperous sovereign nation vibrantly rich in culture and arts.\n\nEvidence exists of pre-historic man inhabiting the region, with rice being cultivated as far back as 4,000 BC. During the first half of the first millennium activity radiated from Nakorn Pathom during the peaceful Suvarnabhumi Kingdom, followed by the Mon Dvaravati Kingdom with its rich culture whose influence extended up through Northern Thailand together with the Northern Mon Kingdom of Haripunchai (Lamphun), as well as Isan’s Si Kottaboon culture until the 10th century. It was then that Khmer influence arrived to replace the city-states of Dvaravati with Lavo (Lopburi) and Supannabhum (Suphanburi), introducing a Hindu culture.\n\nDuring the same period, the Tai’s started moving into the upper north from Southern China founding cities and kingdoms of their own, starting with Chiang Saen and Luang Prabang, adopting Theravada Buddhism from Hariphunchai.\n\nBUDDHISM\n\nBuddhism first reached the region around the year 100 AD, with its first official record being in the year 250 AD when India’s King Ashoka sent Buddhist monks to the Suvarnabhumi Kingdom’s capital, Nakhon Pathom, to teach Buddhism; a social system creating peace and harmony, particularly feelings of charity and compassion towards the whole universe. It was officially recognized as a way of life by the first Tai Empire, the Kingdom of Sukhothai, during the 13th century.\n\nAside from Buddhism, Thai Temples which are situated in every provincial community also fill a very important diverse social role as community centres for; information about news and jobs, recreation, hotel, clinic, old-age home, reformatory for juvenile delinquents, as well as free schooling for the poor.\n\nCareful examination would reveal that in actuality Buddhism is not a ‘religion’, but a community educational/social system, training individuals (monks) to obtain clarity of mind so they can be helpful to others. Ordaining as a ‘monk’ is a ‘contract’ stipulating commitment to earnestly practice and study the science of the mind as discovered by Prince Siddhartha, the Buddha Śākyamuni, 2500 years ago, while also upholding ethical rules of conduct for the community to follow. ‘Tuition’ to support these ‘schools (temples)’ comes from daily donations of food and basic necessities.\n\nThe more these individuals (monks) ‘practice’ the Prince’s techniques for observing the world with neutral eyes –devoid of any pre-conceived beliefs or non-neutral thoughts, especially those that might arise from greed, anger or jealousy – true wisdom develops; wisdom that is at the disposition of the community for advice on maintaining peace and harmony. By relinquishing all and any activities/behaviour/habits that could be non-constructive (with only three sets of robes for clothing), assurance is given that donations are used for their intended purpose.\n\n.\n\n“Do not believe in hearsay, rumour, speculative opinion,\n\npublic opinion, or mere acceptance to logic and inference alone.\n\nHelp yourself. Accept as completely true only that which is\n\npraised by the wise, and which you test for yourself,\n\nand know to be good for yourself and others.”\n\n— The Budda Śākyamuni, The Kalama Sutta, Charter of Free Inquiry\n\n.\n\nAt no time does Buddhism ask you to believe in anything. Quite the contrary, it teaches not to believe in anything that you yourself cannot deduce with wisdom and common logic (cause and effect) for yourself. When visiting a temple, the ‘prayers’ heard are simply words of respect to a fellow human being, Prince Siddhartha, the Śākyamuni Buddha, as discoverer and teacher of a science and technique to obtain true wisdom, with the desire to succeed in practicing these techniques as a student. So in actually, anyone of any religion could also be ‘Buddhist’ in addition to their religious and personal beliefs.\n\nThe technique is easy to explain, but more difficult to achieve; stilling the mind to arrive at a point of non-perception to observe the world with total clarity. One simply stays silent, normally focusing on the breath. With practice, the truths of human nature and Mother Earth become apparent to all. Arriving at this point takes determination. The proof of its efficiency is that before practice, while everyone sees the world from ‘their perspective’ of the controlled mind, upon mastering the practice through ‘being’ in the present moment devoid of all thought, everyone becomes identically aware of the world’s true nature without any external suggestions or imposed beliefs.\n\nThe only ‘requirement’ for being a legitimate Buddhist is a personal physical promise (no beliefs, thought systems or oaths) to adhere to the five basic ethical rules* forming the foundation of a peaceful and harmonious community, (with the realization that free will makes you, and you alone, responsible for your own acts):\n\n1- not to kill/harm\n\n2- not to steal\n\n3- to refrain from inappropriate sexual behaviour (adultery)\n\n4- not to lie or talk incorrectly\n\n5- to refrain from intoxication (as to never lose control of oneself)\n\nBuddhist Monks are accorded immense respect in Thai culture for their sacrifice of giving up all worldly pleasures for the greater good of the community. Monks must imperatively follow the 227 rules of proper behaviour; failing to do so entails consequences ranging from a simple reprimand to permanent expulsion from the Monkhood.\n\nIn Thailand, temporary ordination from a few days to three months or more is expected, at least once, by all males. Doing so bestows enormous merit on their mother. This is for good reason. If you take the time to go through the 227 rules, they equate to civil obedience school teaching men proper behaviour in society; an important pillar for the creation of a peaceful nation.\n\n.\n\nTHE TAI SUKKOTHAI KINGDOM\n\nIn 1238, the Khmer town of Sukhothai was captured by Tais, led by Pho Khun Banglanghow, who became king taking the title Kamornteng Sri Indraditya (1249-1257) (Phra Ruang Dynasty / 10 kings / 200 years). In just over a decade the first Tai Kingdom of Sukhothai (‘The Dawn of Happiness’) dominated Northern Thailand.\n\nHe was succeeded by his second son, and then third named Ramkhamhaeng who became Ramkhamhaeng the Great (1277-1298). King Ramkhamhaeng created and set-in-stone the first Thai Alphabet, the Thai form of Theravada Buddhism, as well as a Sukhothai currency to facilitate trade. The Sukhothai Kings were reputed to be just and paternal kings, having created an ideal state and land of plenty, where subjects could simply ring a bell in front of the palace to consult with the king directly about their problems.\n\nDuring his reign the Sukhothai Kingdom reached as far south as Nakhon Si Thammarat, stretching from the upper Mekong River valley to Bago in Burma. Magnificent temples surrounded by water were constructed, whose present ruins (20 wats and monuments) reveal their magnificent beauty of the past.\n\nUnfortunately, in the mid-14th century another Tai kingdom was established to the south causing a decline in the kingdom’s influence. In 1378, Sukhothai’s governing bodies relocated to Phitsanulok, resulting in the complete desertion of Sukhothai by 1438.\n\n.\n\nTHE TAI AYUTTHAYA KINGDOM\n\nAfter an epidemic of cholera forced Phya U-Thong, the ruler of the principality of U-Thong (Suphanburi) to evacuate the city in 1350, he relocated his people to an ancient settlement named Ayutthaya.\n\nConveniently located on a small island between three rivers, it was accessible to trade, as well as being well-situated to be able to assure its defences. This helped its quick rise as an economic and political power, rapidly expanding through its teaching of Buddhism over military means, transforming it into a kingdom (5 dynasties / 33 kings / 417 years). After three years of preparation Phya U-Thong took on the title of King Ramathibodi (1351-1369), with a court fashioned after Khmer influences, together with Brahmanism and Buddhism.\n\nKing Ramathibodi established Theravada Buddhism as Ayutthaya’s official religion. He also set down a legal code, the Dharmashastra, based on Hindu as well as Thai custom, which served as a tool of Thai law for over five centuries. As such, Ayutthaya began a new era of immense cultural prosperity for the region and its people.\n\n70 wars were also fought; with the other Tai kingdoms, as well as the Burmese, Khmer and Vietnamese. After the fall of Sukhothai, Chiang Mai was eventually conquered and came under Ayutthaya rule. Ayutthaya’s authority thus spread from the north down to Nakhon Si Thammarat in the south.\n\nOther than China, with whom at the beginning of each reign a Royal Message was delivered to the Chinese Emperor (7 centuries / 200 missions), the first foreigners to arrive in Siam were the Portuguese in 1511, establishing diplomatic relations in 1516. They were followed by Spain, Holland, Britain and France who were looking to promote Christianity, as well as sell arms and offer the services of paid mercenaries. This helped contribute to the many wars with Burma, which until then had only been fought with elephants and large armies. Victories were now aided by those who had the most up-to-date artillery. This was especially true for the Burmese, whose new strategy was to raise cannons high enough to pass over a city’s walls, thus killing its inhabitants.\n\nThai cuisine was also influenced by these foreigners’ passage. Cooking techniques were borrowed from China, Muslim cuisine was introduced, as well as curry and other spices from India and the use of coconut milk. Present day Thai deserts such as Foy Thong (Golden Egg Yolk Shreds), Thong Yip (Golden Egg Yolk Flower Tart) and Thong Yod (Golden Egg Yolk drops) made with egg yolks and flour were ‘borrowed’ from the Portuguese.\n\nIt was with the help of the Portuguese that Ayutthaya was able to fend off the Burmese attack of 1549. Unfortunately, valiant Queen Suriyothai, wife of King Chakraphat (1548-1564, 1569), died in battle at the hands of Prince Prome of Burma while mounted atop her elephant protecting her husband whose wounded elephant had collapsed. But in 1569, the Burmese took both Ayutthaya and Vientiene, ransacking the cities as well as abducting most of the population to Burma.\n\nIn 1555 Prince Naresuan was born in Phitsanulok. Seven years later, he was captured by the Burmese and taken to Pegu to assure his father’s obedience. Raised according to his status as a prince, he received the finest training in Burmese war strategies and martial arts. At 16, he was exchanged with his sister and appointed by his father, now King Sanpet I, as Governor of Phitsanulok.\n\nAyutthaya rejected obedience to Burma in 1584, with Naresuan going to battle against them, capturing their vassal kingdom Lan Na. Upon his father’s death in 1590, Naresuan became king, and in 1591, having killed Burmese Prince Minchit Sra in a personal dual, successfully caused Burma to cancel their impending invasion. He then invaded the Khmer Kingdom (Cambodia) in 1593, as well as helping the Shan Tai gain their independence from Burma. Securing both eastern and western borders allowed Ayutthaya to prosper, earning King Naresuan the title of ‘The Warrior King’, as well as the royal designation of ‘Naresuen the Great’.\n\nHalf a century later, King Narai’s attraction with the west allowed adventurers and missionaries a prominent place at court. It was upon his death in 1688, and the realization of these individuals’ methods were vying for the control of peoples’ minds, that they were thrown out of the country or killed. It took nearly a century for Siam to again open to the West.\n\nBy 1700, Ayutthaya’s population burgeoned to nearly 1 million inhabitants. It was one of Asia’s wealthiest, as well as one of the world’s largest, cities on a par with London, whose 2000 golden spires impressed visitors from around the world.\n\nBut Burma started new attacks mid-century, until finally, in 1767 after many months of siege, they broke through the city walls pillaging and burning down Ayutthaya, melting down gold from all the temples and taking it back to Burma along with 90,000 prisoners including members of the Royal Family.\n\nTHE TAI THONBURI KINGDOM\n\nDuring Ayutthaya’s downfall, three courageous friends – Phraya Tak, Phraya Pichai and Chao Phraya Chakri – escaped the flaming city, determined to take Siam back from Burma.\n\nGeneral Tak took his men to Chantaburi on the southern coast, assembling an army and navy. In just over six months he took back Siam, formed a new kingdom at the mouth of the Chao Phraya River south of Ayutthaya at Bangkok’s west bank of Thonburi, and was proclaimed King Taksin. He then ousted the Burmese from Northern Thailand and Chiang Mai, sending his general Chao Phraya Chakri to take back Laos, from where Bangkok’s famous Emerald Buddha originates.\n\nKing Taksin the Great (1767-1782) restored the administration and internal finances, reviving the Thai identity through Buddhism and its derived arts. He also re-opened Siam to the west, helping French missionaries to build a church as did past kings. He was interested in increasing the country’s income through foreign trade, mostly with China, as well as obtaining arms from Britain and Holland. In the mean time, in order to alleviate widespread famine, he used his own funds to buy food and clothing for the populace.\n\nIn 1782 King Taksin was ‘officially’ declared mad and deposed. Formal historical records state that he was executed in royal style by General Chao Phraya Chakri as to prevent any future claims to the throne. General Chakri had previously summoned King Taksin’s son for execution. But folklore has it that King Taksin the Great, who began meditation practice in 1776, ordained as a monk, taking up residence in a remote part of Nakhon Si Thammarat where he lived until 1825.\n\n.\n\nTHE RATTANAKOSIN ERA AND THE CHAKRI DYNASTY\n\nAs Commander-in-Chief of the army in Cambodia, as well as being the highest ranking noble of the kingdom, General Chao Phraya Chakri was offered the throne backed by officials and the general public. Upon ascending to the throne, he received the name of King Phra Phuttha Yot Fa Chula Lok or King Rama I (1782-1809) (Rama being the King of Ayodhya in Indian mythology), thus founding the current House of Chakri.\n\nIn order to better assure the security of his subjects, he moved the capital across to the river’s east bank, at the village of Bang-Koh, naming the new city Rattanakosin, from which he proceeded to rebuild the nation within a fortified city. Wat Phra Kaew, the temple for the Emerald Buddha, was the first construction, around which was built the Grand Palace. In Ayutthaya style, they still retain their entire splendour.\n\nKing Rama I accorded a high priority to culture and traditions, modelled after the Ayutthaya period. He personally wrote the Thai Ramakian which is still very culturally valid today, in addition to establishing the legal system, ‘The Book of Three Seals’, creating the foundation for a modern nation.\n\nHe was succeeded by his son Buddha Loetla Nabhalai, King Rama II (1809-1824), followed by Rama II’s son Nangklao, King Rama III (1824-1851). During their reigns western colonialism became a major concern leading to the Treaty of Amity and Commerce with Britain in 1826 and diplomatic relations in 1833 with the United States. This resulted in missionaries taking up residence in Siam. After almost two decades although not one convert was made, their introduction of western medicine and science was of great influence, especially their creation of the first Thai alphabet printing press in 1835, leading to the first Thai newspaper in 1844.\n\nAnother important consequence was the effects this would have on Prince Mongkut. As a monk for 27 years while his brother Nangklao was king, Prince Mongkut’s inquisitive mind was free to study, and pilgrimages gave him the opportunity to travel throughout Siam by foot, witnessing first-hand the kindness and generosity of the Thai people. He learned English from his missionary friends, as well as Latin and sciences like astronomy. This cultivated in him a great benevolence towards foreign nations, as well as a very tolerant nature founded in the Buddhist principles of observation and logical deduction based on cause and effect. In their attempts to convert him, he is quoted as having stated; “What you teach them to do is admirable, but what you teach them to believe is foolish.” But as Siam is open to all faiths, both Catholics and Protestants were welcome to receive Royal support.\n\nIt was upon his deathbed that Prince Mongkut’s brother, King Rama III, expressed a final warning concerning Western influence:\n\n“Wars fought with the Vietnamese and the Burmese seem no longer likely.\n\nMy concerns are over the Westerners. Remain cautious about falling prey to them.\n\nCertain of their ideas worth learning should be emulated, but not blindly embraced.”\n\nAscending to the throne as King Rama IV (1851-1868), wisdom and insight developed throughout many years of humble monkhood equipped King Mongkut with diplomatic skills. He exchanged Royal Envoys with Europe’s Royal Courts (notably the English and French), signed treaties authorizing trade with all countries on equal terms (10 countries in 1855), as well as recognized the need to keep up with the pace of modernization. He also appointed foreigners as Thai consuls for the first time. Although wanting to personally visit foreign countries, to his regret, he was not able to do so during his lifetime.\n\nHe had his children educated in western ways, commissioning, among others, Anna Leonowens to teach English to his children. (She subsequently wrote about her experiences, made into plays and movies that were more fiction than fact.)\n\nUpon the death of King Mongkut in 1868, his son Chulalongkorn became King Rama V (1868-1910) at 15. With a regent appointed to govern, within two years young King Rama V began to realize his father’s dream of travelling to foreign lands, visiting Batavia and Singapore, then considered British soil. Respecting diplomatic etiquette, he sent a telegram to Queen Victoria informing her of his visit. The next year he visited India. In 1873 he entered the monkhood for 15 days, before a second coronation ceremony.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1897 that he toured Europe for many months, strengthening relations with friendly countries, as well as solving the political problems of the Gunboat Crisis of 1894.\n\nUpon returning home, he delivered a Royal Address wherein he expressed that having been most cordially welcome throughout his trip, it was not a personal honour, but one accorded to all of Siam’s citizens, stating; “It is also our intention to bring the benefits to all our subjects.”\n\nHaving been educated in foreign ways by his father, he commanded that Thai people be able to choose their faith freely, with Muslims and Christians assured of total freedom to practice their religious rites. He also abolished slavery, and fixed the date of April 1st as the official Thai New Year.\n\nTo stay close to his subjects, he travelled around the country to personally talk with them, sometimes incognito, so he could truly understand their needs. He started Siam’s modernization of the administration, as well as building hospitals, roads and railways, setting up postal services, improving the army/navy and founding courts of law, while installing electricity and waterworks.\n\nMost of all, he withstood colonization pressures, maintaining the country’s independence through personal friendships with Germany’s Emperor William II and Russia’s Tsar Nicholas II, as well as an equilibrium between England and France with ‘gifts’ of territory; realizing that freedom from colonization is more than just avoiding physical invasion, but more importantly, keeping his subjects free from external control of their minds.\n\nDuring the reign of King Rama VI (1910-1925), he introduced university education, upgrading King Chulalongkorn’s School for Civil Servants to become Chulalongkorn University. He was also a talented scholar and writer, later honoured by UNESCO.\n\nIn a Royal Address to the Association of Siamese Students in Europe, he stated; “We are here studying in Europe to seek knowledge in disciplines that are not sufficiently taught in our country…. The administrators sent us out to seek additional knowledge and expertise, so that we could go back and work beneficially for the prosperity of our nation.”\n\nKing Rama VII (1925-1935) paid visits to Japan, French Indochina, Singapore and the United States, but the most significant event of his reign was 1932’s bloodless revolution. While at the summer palace in Hua Hin, a group of young military officers and civil servants took key figures of royal blood as hostages, demanding the government be changed from an absolute to a constitutional monarchy, presided over by a prime minister.\n\n.\n\n(Bangkok, Venice of the East, 1930s)\n\nThe King granted the new constitution, but three years later abdicated due to conflicts with the revolutionary government, installing his 10-year-old nephew, Ananda Mahidol, as King Rama VIII (1935-1946).\n\nIn his abdication speech, King Rama VII said that the duty of a ruler was to reign for the good of the whole people, not for a selected few.\n\nDue to HRM King Ananda’s young age regents were appointed, and His Majesty spent the next three years together with his older sister, Princess Galyani Vadhana, and his younger brother, Prince Bhumibol Adulyadej, at school in Lausanne, Switzerland, returning for a two month visit at the end of 1938. With the outbreak of WWII, the family remained in Switzerland and suffered like everyone else, only to return again on November 29th 1945.\n\nIt was during this time that infighting erupted in the government; leading to the emergence of the military faction under the authoritarian regime of Prime Minister Luang Phibunsongkram. In 1939, Prime Minister Field Marshal Phibul changed the country’s name ‘Siam’, which it was known by since the Sukhothai period, to ‘Thailand’ in an effort to give a common identity to all of the country’s different ethnic groups, as well as switching the date of the official New Year to January 1st,in 1940.\n\nStill a student in Switzerland, King Rama VIII was asked to delay his departure until June 13th 1946 so that he could present the new constitution on May 9th and open Parliament on June 1st. But in a tragic incident, he was found dead, shot in the Grand Palace’s Boromphiman Throne Hall.\n\n.\n\nHis Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej the Great – King Rama IX (1946-present)\n\nAscending to the throne while still a student in Switzerland, King Rama IX’s uncle, Rangsit-Prince of Chainat, was appointed Prince Regent. His Majesty thus returned to finish his education at the University of Lausanne, switching his major from science to political science, law and economics.\n\nHe also made frequent visits to Paris where he met Mom Rajawongse Sirikit Kitiyakara, daughter of the Thai ambassador to France, who subsequently, upon the request of HRH the Princess Mother, moved her studies to Lausanne to be closer to His Majesty after a car accident required his hospitalization. The Royal Couple was engaged on July 19th 1949, and married on April 28th 1950, a week before His Majesty’s coronation on May 5th 1950.\n\nOver the next decade His Majesty and Queen Sirikit started to raise their family of four children; Princess Ubol Ratana (1951- ), HRH Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn (1952- ), HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn (1955- ) and HRH Princess Chulabhorn Walailak (1957- ), before embarking on state visits beginning in 1960 to neighbouring countries, followed by a seven-month tour to the United States and 13 European Countries.\n\nIn 1962 they paid state visits to Pakistan, the Federation of Malaya, New Zealand and Australia, then in 1963 to Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines and in 1964 to Austria. In 1966 their Majesties returned to Germany and Austria, went to Iran in 1967, followed by the United States and Canada for the ’67 Expo. The next and last state visit was in 1994 to the Lao People’s Democratic Republic. Once grown up, the Royal Children have also taken on the responsibility of forging royal bonds of friendship, as well as promoting cooperation with the international community.\n\nWhile by law a constitutional monarchy, the country’s succession of governments were military, with only brief periods of democratic rule until democracy was restored in 1992, leaving His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej, as Head of State, to provide stable development for his beloved subjects.\n\nIt was in September 1957 that His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej issued a first Royal Command to maintain public order. The monarchy was revitalised, with Royal ceremonies from the early Chakri Dynasty, such as the Royal Ploughing Ceremony and the Royal Barge Procession, reinstated. His Majesty’s Birthday was declared the new national day replacing the anniversary of the Siamese Revolution of 1932.\n\nTheir Majesties started touring throughout all of the provinces, while patronizing development projects whose number of Royal Initiatives rose to 3000+. Ever since, His Majesty’s astute wisdom has maintained peace and happiness throughout the land.\n\nIt was during the 60th Anniversary of His Majesty the King’s accession to the throne that he addressed the awaiting crowd, asking Thai citizens; to unite, embrace kindness and compassion, as well as cooperation, to uphold honesty and observe rules and traditions with impartiality, adhering to righteous thoughts and act within reason. More recently, in response to the tense situation in Southern Thailand, His Majesty advised to “understand, reach out and develop”.\n\nEven more recently, this past July 11th 2011 during a special audience granted to State Attorneys for their oath-taking, His Majesty the King urged them to uphold their oath and perform their duties accordingly so as to bring peace and order to the Thai society. His Majesty stressed that attorneys formed an essential part in justice provision to all in the country without bias, so that peace could prevail in the society, despite differences and conflicts among citizens.\n\n.\n\n‘Tossapit Rajatham’\n\nThe 10 Virtues of the Righteous Leader\n\nAs with all Thai Kings before him, in his Oath of Accession to the throne His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej pledged to “reign with righteousness for the happiness and benefit of the Siamese people.”\n\nIn addition, His Majesty also vowed to uphold the 10 Virtues of the Righteous Leader: alms-giving and charity, strict moral standards, self-sacrifice, honesty and integrity, courtesy and kindness, austerity in habits, harbouring no anger or hatred, practising and promoting non-violence, exuding patience, forbearance and tolerance, and displaying impartiality to all. Never swaying from these principles His Majesty has created a country where love and respect abound, based on tradition and reverence of acts rather than words.\n\nHis Majesty’s devotion to uphold this code has not only earned him the immense love and respect of his people, but also internationally.\n\n.\n\nTHE WORLD’S DEVELOPMENT KING\n\nCited as the world’s ‘Development King’, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan came to Thailand in 2006 to bestow His Majesty Bhumibol Adulyadej the Great with the inaugural United Nations Human Development Lifetime Achievement Award for his dedication to human development, poverty reduction and environment conservation through his innovative and successful work in creating happiness amongst his subjects.\n\nDuring his extensive travels around the Kingdom, projects personally undertaken by His Majesty have helped countless millions of people to lead better sustainable lives. His ‘Sufficiency Economy’ philosophy has been called ‘visionary thinking’ for its middle-path approach focusing on people and their well-being as the axe of development, rather than the current economic growth paradigm. Emphasizing moderation and responsible consumption during these times of rapid globalization, they are an inspiration to people around the world.\n\nwww.SufficiencyEconomy.org\n\nTo achieve these development goals, His Majesty noted 10 principles for Sufficiency Economy business practices:\n\n1. Adopting a long-term perspective to management and decision-making; not managing for short-term gains, but considering cause and effect in the long run.\n\n2. Genuinely valuing and continuously developing human resources. This includes avoiding laying off employees even in a time of economic difficulty, considering them as an investment.\n\n3. Being honest and genuinely concerned with, and accountable for, a wide range of stakeholders; including society, the environment and future generations. This often suggests stakeholders’ involvement in business decision-making and social contributions.\n\n4. Nurturing both incremental and radical innovation throughout the entire organization, including products and processes. This often means promoting cross-functional teams.\n\n5. Utilizing resources effectively and efficiently.\n\n6. Adopting/developing effective, but not expensive, technology. Usually, this technology is developed from local materials and wisdom.\n\n7. Expanding business because of its actual growth, as opposed to a surge in market demand. This often means a careful and gradual expansion.\n\n8. Carefully diversifying products, markets and investment portfolios to minimize risks.\n\n9. Sharing knowledge to develop markets. This often means knowledge sharing with competitors because doing so helps develop the market to benefit consumers.\n\n10. Being truly ethical, perseverant and diligent.\n\n.\n\n“Sufficiency means moderation, reasonableness, and the need of self-immunity mechanism\n\nfor sufficient protection from impact arising from internal and external changes.\n\nTo achieve this, an application of knowledge with due consideration and prudence is essential.\n\nIn particular great care is needed in the utilization of theories and methodologies for planning\n\nand implementation in every step. At the same time, it is essential to strengthen the moral fibre\n\nof the nation, so that everyone, particularly public officials, academic, businessmen at all levels,\n\nadheres first and foremost to the principle of honesty and integrity. In addition, a way of life\n\nbased on patience, perseverance, diligence, wisdom and prudence is indispensable\n\nto create balance and be able to cope appropriately with critical challenges arising\n\nfrom extensive and rapid socioeconomic, environmental, and cultural changes in the world.”\n\n– HM King Bhumibol Adulyadej\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n• Home • 89+ Columns • ‘What Is?’ •\n\n• ThaiWais TV • Why?
