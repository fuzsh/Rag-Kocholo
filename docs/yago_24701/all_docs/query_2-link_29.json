I had gone to visit the Grand Place with two friends who had never been before. But unfortunately that day the palace was closed because the King was in attendance with a family birthday. It was a surprise. Entering the City Pillar Shrine  I had  just missed the Thai Dancers and was treated to  a version of family Thai life, with a wife arguing with her husband. \n\tThe Shrine is located across the street from the eastern wall of Wat Phra Kaew ( also known as the Temple of the Emerald Buddha ) to the south east of Sanam Luang, opposite Na Phra Lan Rd junction. This shrine contains a wooden pillar erected by King Rama I in 1782 to represent the founding of the capital.  This wood is used as a part to build the pillar. It was 2.74 metres high from the ground and buried 2 metres deep, which makes this pillar’s total height 4.74 metres with 73 cm diameter. \n\tThe shrine has been renovated several times, under the reign of the King Rama IV, King Mongkut. The pillar had become dilapidated. So, The King ordered  the excavation of the old one and built a new pillar, then placed a new horoscope for Bangkok inside of  it.  It was replaced in 1752 with a new pillar measuring 5.035 metres high, 47 centimetres  in diameter measured at the base of the pillar with a width base of 1.80 metres and combined both the old and new pillars to a refurbished pavilion with a Prang shape which was the model of the shrine of Ayudhya. It was finished on Sunday, 1st May in 1753. In 1980, in preparation for the Rattanakosin celebration of the 200th anniversary in 1982. \n\tShortly after the shrine in Bangkok was built, similar shrines were built in strategic provinces to symbolize central power, such as in Songkhla. Further shrines were created during the reign of King Buddha Loetla Nabhalai ( Rama II ) in Nakhon Khuen Khan and Samut Prakan, and by King Nangklao ( Rama III ) in Chachoengsao, Chanthaburi and Phra Tabong Province ( now in Cambodia ). However, after King Mongkut raised a new pillar in Bangkok, no further shrines in the provinces were built until 1944, when the then Prime Minister of Thailand Phibunsongkhram built a city pillar shrine in Phetchabun. \n\tNearly every city in Thailand has a City Pillar shrine some elaborate some quite plain compared to most buildings around Thailand. Bangkok City Pillar Shrine ( also known as San Lak Muang ) is one of the City Pillar Shrines in Thailand that is ancient, sacred, and magnificent. It was believed that people achieved prosperity and fulfilment in their work and career, cut the misfortunes and supplemented their luck, power, and prestige if they bowed and respected this sacred place. According to a historian, the shrine was built after the establishment of Rattanakosin Kingdom  ( Bangkok ) instead of the old capital, Thonburi Kingdom in the reign of King Rama I of the Chakri Dynasty at 6.45 a.m. on Sunday, 21th April in 1782. \n\tThere is  plenty to see at this shrine besides the usual building. They have landscaped gardens, a  stage where acts demonstrate about Thai culture and life. They have food booths for snack food.",
