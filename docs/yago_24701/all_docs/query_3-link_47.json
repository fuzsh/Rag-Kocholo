This Day is also celebrated as Shourya Diwas in Bharat, as the encroached structure over the Shri Ram Janmabhumi place was freed by Hindus on the same day in 1992. Wasim Rizwi chose to do the Ghar wapasi on this very day is significant. The shuddhi ceremony was conducted at Dasna Devi Mandir near Gaziabad under supervision of Mahamandaleshwar Yati Narsinghanand Giri of the Dasana Mutt.\n\nWasim Rizwi is not the first to denounce Islam. Here are a few more of them:\n\nAnnapurna Devi (born Roshanara Khan) Sitar player and music teacher in the North Indian classical tradition.\n\nAnwar Shaikh – British author\n\nAashish Khan – Indian musician\n\nBukka I – King of Vijayanagara Empire who converted to Islam, then reverted to Hinduism.

He has been vocal against it and also filed a petition in the Supreme Court to remove those 26 inhuman verses which discriminate among humans, non-Muslims & women especially. Hundreds of Fatwas have been issued for his head by many maulvis for so-called blasphemy.\n\nWhereas the Azan which is called call for prayers is the most blasphemous thing and it is announced five times a day from each mosque with loudspeaker. The Azan says there is no God except Allah which means your Gods are fake, our Allah is the only God. This should be banned & declared blasphemy first.\n\nWasim Rizwi’s ghar wapasi will be a milestone in Islamic history. The casteism in Islam will ruin this religion sooner or later. Though they all believe in one God not one cast of Muslims recognises the way of worship of another cast, in spite of belonging to same Sunni cast. “My way of worship is the only right path and it alone will lead us to Jannat” - is the belief and the root cause of what we are seeing in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria etc. Otherwise these are all Muslim countries and should actually not have any difference of opinion in the first place. Wasim Rizwi comes from the Shia caste which the Sunni Islamis do not consider to be Muslims. Shias are treated as non-Muslims though they are the followers of direct descendants of Muhammed. The Sunnis are followers of the Calipha Abu Bakar, and are divided into seventy-two sub-casts, and they too do not recognise other caste’s way of worship.\n\nIt is evident that Islam has been designed to rule the nomads of Arab tribes. The fight for food, women, sex and unlimited male supremacy has led this cult spread with sword. The other big reason is that there is no exit from Islam. Leaving Islam has death penalty and any ordinary Muslim has the right to deliver it. The design is so vicious that no one could dare to leave it. But, the spread of Islam to democratic countries has open the doors for the moderate Muslims to leave Islam and comment on the atrocious arrangements of it. Today there is huge number of people in US and other countries who are openly showing their disassociation with Islam & “Proud To Be Ex-Muslim” placards are visible all over. But this is impossible in Muslim countries.\n\nIt’s time for the Islamic scholars to come forward and understand the facts that it’s not seventh century Arab land but the 21st century that we are living in, and we need to amend the text as per new norms. On one hand we want the latest iPhone and on other hand we want our society to live in sixth century kabilah! How can we live with this dichotomy? Today’s youth have access to every information. They are thus comparing the facts with other texts. If they find it unscientific, they will out throw it and in no time millions of Wasim Rizwis will come in open to outcast Islam."
