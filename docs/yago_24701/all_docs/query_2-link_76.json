        "text": "Tina from Autour Asia was fantastic from the moment I contacted her with my interest. She provided detailed planning and maintained continuous communication throughout the trip. She helped me customize a perfect two-week itinerary according to my preferences and promptly answered all my questions leading up to the trip. The journey itself was seamless, with excellent accommodations, guides, tours, and transportation throughout.\n\nTina met us at the start of our trip to review everything and stayed in touch via WhatsApp to address any questions or update us on flight delays or driver schedules. It was an ideal trip at a great price, and I highly recommend Autour Asia to anyone considering a trip to Vietnam.\n\nEspecially at the end of the tour, Tina and her boss invited us to a delightful dinner in Hanoi. The meal was wonderful, and we had extensive conversations about traditional dishes and Vietnamese culture.\n\nOur itinerary included: Ho Chi Minh City, Mekong Delta, Hoi An, Hue, Hanoi, Halong Bay\n\nDinner together in Hanoi\n\nCruise in Halong Bay\n\nCruise in Mekong River\n\nCruise in Mekong River\n\nCooking class in Hoi An\n\nEcotour in Hoi An\n\nVisit of Hue Imperial City\n\nIt was hot when we were there, but they always provide coconut juice to cooling us down wherever we arrived. Some locals may have whole families working for coconuts.\n\nWe visited the houses of the locals and took a boat. The river was quiet and comfortable.\n\nThe food at the B&B was delicious and the host was very friendly.\n\nIn addition, I also custom-made a local costume. Driver and guide are friendly, the guide took lots of photos for us, It was a pleasant trip accompanied by beautiful scenery, delicious food and friendly people.\n\nMy three friends and I recently went on a long tour and we were highly satisfied with how the tour was handled. There were no glitches or problems throughout the entire trip. Upon arriving at each destination, our guide and driver were already waiting for us outside the arrival area. The hotel choices were excellent and we enjoyed a delicious breakfast every morning. The guides were helpful and knowledgeable about the places we visited.\n\nAdditionally, most of our lunches were included, allowing us to savor the cuisine of each country. We would like to express our gratitude to Eliese for organizing and facilitating the itinerary for each country we visited. We wholeheartedly recommend \"Autour Asia\" to our friends!\n\nMr. Duvori Martin 4pax (Vietnam Tour 15 days)\n\nI had a delightful meeting with Mrs. Laura and her mother from Switzerland at Autour Asia in Hanoi, which made for a great start to my new work week. They were charming and had a great sense of humor. It was their first time in Asia, so they were filled with excitement to explore all the new things here.\n\nOverall, we had a fantastic holiday and would love to return. The guides were knowledgeable and provided us with valuable information. However, our only observation is that they seemed to have difficulty engaging in conversation. We understand that this could be attributed to the complexity of the English language and translation.\n\nMrs. Lenzinie Boccona (Tour of Vietnam and Cambodia 14 days)\n\nMrs. Ami Krace, a fitness trainer from Singapore, had an incredible trip with her husband in Central Vietnam. She is not only cute but also very nice. We are always delighted when she recommends us to her family and friends for their upcoming trips to Vietnam.\n\nWorking with our company has been an absolute pleasure, with no issues whatsoever. Initially, I was a bit hesitant about working with an online company instead of meeting in person, but everything went smoothly. In fact, we received overwhelmingly positive feedback. My consultant, Eliese, provided excellent service despite all our interactions being through email. She responded promptly, provided thorough explanations, and assisted us in booking tickets and obtaining visas, all at a reasonable cost.\n\nThe tour guides were exceptional, and the hotel locations were superb. We can't speak highly enough of them and the overall experience.\n\nMrs. Ami Krace (Amazing Tour in Da Nang and Hoi An)\n\nAfter attending an exhibition in Ho Chi Minh City, my wife and I decided to embark on a journey together, and that's when we came across Autour Asia through a friend's recommendation. The trip we chose was just right in terms of duration, allowing us ample time to savor the delectable local cuisine and engage with fascinating people we encountered along the way. This experience provided a sense of comfort and solace, especially after a long period of time without such opportunities.\n\nWe truly embraced every moment of the journey and wholeheartedly recommend it to others seeking a fulfilling travel experience.\n\nMr. Reda (Vietnam tour 8 days)\n\nThank you so much once again for your invaluable assistance and for organizing such a wonderful tour for us. We had an incredible time and will definitely be recommending your services to others. I understand that you are already working on arranging a tour package for my sister-in-law and her friends. Additionally, I have some other friends who are planning to visit Vietnam this year, and I will gladly pass on your contact information to them. Furthermore, my family and I are interested in a tour of Hanoi, including Halong Bay, and we will reach out to you again soon. Hopefully, we can meet up with you in Hanoi during our visit.\n\nRegarding the feedback for our tour guide, Ms. Oanh, I would like to add some comments in addition to the ones I shared with you during our tele-conversation. Ms. Oanh is not only a delightful person but also possesses extensive knowledge about the places of interest she took us to. One noteworthy aspect was the sequence of our visits. She wisely took us to the Cham Museum in Da Nang on the first day, before our trip to My Son Sanctuary on the fourth day. This arrangement enhanced our understanding and appreciation of these historical sites as there were connections between them. Moreover, Ms. Oanh recommended that we visit the remarkable government cruise boat in Da Nang, known as the Dragon Cruise (or something similar), which was docked along the river, opposite the Cham Museum, on Sunday. We had the opportunity to enjoy a delightful dinner on the cruise and witness the mesmerizing fire and water show on the Dragon Bridge. It was an absolutely fantastic experience.\n\nOnce again, thank you for everything.\n\nMrs Lim Ang (Vietnam Central Tour 5 days)"
