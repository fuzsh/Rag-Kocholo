        "text": "It was a bright, sunny day in Nonthaburi. As we set off on a sight-seeing trip along the Chao Phraya, the prow of our chartered boat kicked up a refreshing spray of fine water droplets from the surface of the river. We had all been invited to take part in one of the annual boat excursions organised by Nakhon Nonthaburi Municipality and throughout the day we would we hopping on and off this vessel to visit historic and cultural attractions, including several temples featuring fine examples of art and architecture from the Ayutthaya and early Rattanakosin periods.\n\nThe mayor of the municipality, Somnuek Thanadechakul, welcomed us on board with a short speech. “The town of Nonthaburi was established in 1549,” he informed all and sundry. “In years past it was best known for growing durian, tangerine and other fruit.”\n\nAccording to the province’s official handbook, simply entitled Nonthaburi, the town has a long history dating back more than 400 years to the Ayutthaya period. Originally a small settlement in Tambon Ban Talat Khwan, a tranquil riverside area of orchards, Nonthaburi was upgraded to the status of a municipality in 1549, the year after King Maha Chakkraphat acceded to the throne. In 1665, King Narai the Great had a fortress and official buildings erected at the mouth of the Om River.\n\nDuring the Rattanakosin period, Nonthaburi grew in importance due to its close proximity to Bangkok, the new capital established by King Rama I. King Rama IV (1851-68) had the town’s centre moved to the mouth of Khlong Bang Sue. Later, King Rama V ordered the erection of a town hall at this site. In 1928, King Rama VII had the town hall moved to Ban Bang Khwang, next to the Chao Phraya, with officials taking over King’s College, a school for boys founded by King Rama V to teach English and law as part of his efforts to prepare Siam for the modernisation it would require to compete with other nations on an equal footing.\n\n“A must-see is Nonthaburi Museum,” the mayor told our party. “It was built in 1910 and originally used as King’s College before it was turned into the provincial hall.’’\n\nRight next to the museum is a shrine to Chao Mae Tubtim, a female deity long revered by Thais of Chinese extraction who believe she has the power to fulfil requests for success in business ventures.\n\nThe next stop on our itinerary was Wat Khemaphirataram which dates back to the Ayutthaya period and was restored by Queen Srisuriyentramart, a consort of King Rama II. Later, we disembarked again to tour Wat Thai Muang which was restored during the Second Reign (1809-24) by Chao Phraya Rattanathibet (Kun), a samuhanayok (top-level official) and ancestor of the Rattanakul family. It boasts an ubosot (ordination hall) shaped like a Chinese junk and a stupa from the early Rattanakosin period.\n\nOur next destination was Wat Chaloemphrakiat, built in 1847 by King Rama III in memory of his mother, Somdej Phra Sri Sulalai. It is very beautiful and often used as a location for shooting period dramas for television. We travelled farther along the river to Wat Khae Nok which was established by Thai-Mon people in 1824 during the Third Reign (1824-51). Phraya Phahonphonphayuhasena and other conspirators gathered here to make a solemn wish before carrying out their bloodless revolution of June 24, 1932 which replaced the absolute monarchy of King Rama VII with a constitutional system which laid the foundations for today’s democracy.\n\nAs a token of their gratitude, the revolutionaries later paid for the building of a bell tower at this temple in the shape of a lotus flower in full bloom.\n\nReturning to our boat, we proceeded north to Phutthasathan Choeng Tha-Na Bot, a religious site where the surviving structures from two ancient temples (Wat Choeng Tha and Wat Na Bot) are preserved for posterity. Here we toured the old ordination hall of Wat Na Bot and viewed the statues of Luang Phor Sua Dam and Phra Nirantarai.\n\nThen it was on to Wat Chimphlee Sutthawas, another venerable old temple on Ko Kret, an island in the river where the descendants of Mon immigrants still live, adhering to many of the customs of their ancestors. We then strolled the 700m or so to Wat Paramaiyikawat, site of the island’s best-known landmark, a pagoda which leans over at a precarious angle. Along the way, one can stop to shop for local goods, such as pottery, vegetables and traditional desserts. Later, we crossed the river to visit Wat Bang Chak and pay our respects to Luang Phor Toh, the largest Buddha statue in the whole province.\n\nAfter a long day of sight-seeing, we returned home with aching feet but happy hearts after making merit at so many temple and getting a taste of what it might be like to live in Nonthaburi, this veritable melting pot of Thai, Mon and Chinese culture."
