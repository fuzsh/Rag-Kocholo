        "text": "main-page/conference/dr-christopher-m-joll/ The Legacy of Melaka’s 15th Century Successes in 16th Century Siam This paper seeks to respond to the perceived dearth of studies pursuing an explicitly comparative approach to Southeast Asian historiography. Before the publication of Chris Baker’s Ayutthaya Rising From Land or Sea?, there were a few examples in the secondary literature on “littoral“, and “mainland” of any engagement between Thai Studies specialists and members of the Malay Studies Guild. Although this paper seeks to build on Baker’s seminal contribution to comparative historiography vis-à-vis mainland Southeast Asia subservient to Ayutthaya, and Melaka, I ask questions about what insights into Melaka in the 15th century might be provided from an exploration of developments in the 16th. I argue that the prosperity of port cities such as Ayutthaya and Patani following 1511, confirms Melaka’s regional importance in the 15th Century. Furthermore, the presence of transcultural entrepreneurs in Siamese palaces and ports suggests Ayutthaya to have actively imitated Melaka’s highly successful cosmopolitan model. Finally, I consider case studies of how aspects of Melaka’s religious cosmopolitanism spread to Ayutthaya. These include Sufi tariqat, and Persian mercantile networks present in South Indian port cities arriving via transpeninsular portages revitalised by mercantile networks forced to establish new operational hubs.\n\n“The Ottoman Empire And The Kingdom Of Siam Through The Ages” explores the interactions between the two countries from the 16th century to the early 20th century. The book comprises two chapters written by Dr. Andrew Peacock and Dr. İsmail Hakkı Kadı, and an extensive appendix of various documents from the Turkish archives. The first chapter “The Ottomans and Siam, c. 1500-1800” by Dr. Peacock focuses on the relations between the two countries through the early modern period mainly on the basis of the geographical treatises of Ottoman intellectual milieu. In this chapter Dr. Peacock also analyses the Ottoman servants of the Kingdom of Siam and the commercial links between the two countries during the period. In the Second chapter “Relations between the Kingdom of Siam and the Ottoman Empire during the Nineteenth and early Twentieth Centuries” Dr. Kadı focuses on the interactions during the 19th century mainly based on Ottoman archival sources and newspapers. The royal visits to Istanbul by the prominent Siamese princes Damrong, Chakrabongse and Boworadet are studies in detail as they were covered by Newspapers and official documents. Dr. Kadı’s chapter deals also with Ottoman interactions with the Muslim communities of Siam and the presence of Ottoman figures on various buildings belonging to the Muslims in Bangkok. The extensive appendix at the end of the book contain the original photos of the relevant documents in the Ottoman archives in Istanbul. Transliterations and (summary)translations of these documents are given in the appendix as well.\n\nThe primary purpose of this article is to reconstruct the date, location, and significance of Ayutthaya's Shi'ite enclave within the former Siamese capital during the seventeenth century. This reassessment is based on a mixture of Persian, Thai, and European sources that clarify the confused picture generated by European cartographers that has for too long cast a shadow over Muslim studies in Thailand. Following a summary of extant explanations and a description of my primary sources and methodological approach, I summarise two aspects of Muslim presence in Ayutthaya. First, I introduce readers to connections between the incremental growth of the Muslim presence in Ayutthaya during the sixteenth century with geopolitical developments on the eastern littoral of the Bay of Bengal. Second, I present the range of accounts provided in primary sources specifically mentioning Ayutthaya's Muslim enclave. Having orientated readers to the origins of the Muslim presence within Ayutthaya's citadel, I incrementally introduce annotated portions of Thai and European maps. These clarify confusion about where and when this Shi'ite mosque was constructed. I conclude with comments about how this reassessment brings into focus the presence of Shi'ite 'alid piety, Shi'ite polemics about local Sunnis, Siamese conversion to Shi'ism, and distinctions between these \"Moors\" and \"Malays.\"\n\nThis writer delivered a public lecture upon invitation by the renowned NalandaSriwijaya Centre (NSC) at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS) in Singapore. In recent years, Thailand – as well as other Southeast Asian nations such as Malaysia, where to date there are said to live more than 100,000 Iranians in its capital Kuala Lumpur alone – has become a popular destination for Iranians. As a matter of fact, Iranian migration to what is now Thailand began as early as the seventeenth century, during the Ayutthaya period when the kingdom hosted a large colony of Iranian merchants. Some of their descendants converted to Buddhism and continued to retain influence in Thai public life to the present day; one prominent example is the Bunnag family, whose ancestor ‘Shaykh Aḥmad’ is said to have come from Qom and arrived at Ayutthaya in 1602. A cohesive, comprehensive, and chronological account of the Persian cultural presence in Southeast Asia is difficult, if not impossible, to p...\n\nThis chapter describes Patani’s Indic, Islamic and Thai pasts. The argu- ment is that the Malay kerajaan of Patani was similar to—rather than distinct from—other port city-states on the peninsula and islands of Southeast Asia where a Sanskrit cosmopolis existed for a millennium before the earliest chapters of Islam’s Southeast Asian expansion. Islam also circulated east and west of Patani through trade between the Middle East and China via the Indian Ocean. This created a range of Indian/Arab/Malay creole communities whose members played key roles in the adoption of, or adhesion to, Islam in Southeast Asian port city-states like Patani. India’s importance to the arrival of Islam to the Thai/Malay peninsula relates to what Islam came to, where Islam initially came from, and who Islam came through. Rather than refer to conversion, I refer to an adhesion to, or adoption of, Islam. The impact of Thai and Islamic influences in Patani/Pattani following its defeat in 1785 is described. The details of the process through which the Malay Kingdom (SM. kerajaan) of became the Thai Province of Pattani, including Bangkok’s legislative and administrative initiatives are also provided. A central con- cern of this chapter is to highlight the fact that these developments coincided with a period of revolution and reform in the Hijaz. I describe how these developments impacted local religious life and thought through local luminaries such as Shaykh Daud Al-Fatani, Shaykh Ahmad Al-Fatani and Haji Sulong. The methodologies and contributions of present-day reformist revivalist movements are also described.\n\nThis paper describes Malay negotiation with Thai Influences and Islamic reformism in Thailand’s far-south by analyzing the changes in merit-making rhetoric, rituals, and rationales. I begin by demonstrating how the local rise of Thai/Siamese influence coincided with growth of Islamic reformism. The subjugation of the Malay Kerajaan of Patani by Siamese forces between the 178Os and the 1820’s led to an exodus of ‘ulama to Mecca at a tumultuous time. The writings and returning students of Malay-Indonesian scholars based in Mecca began to challenge traditionalist orthopraxy in Pattani before Siam increased its attempts to assimilate its southern subjects following the 1909 Anglo-Siamese Treaty. The governments of General Prem Tinsulanonda negotiated an amnesty to Malay separatists, accommodated Malay demands, and co-opted Malay elites. Once more, these developments roughly coincided with Islamic resurgence. As a result, Malays in South Thailand are both more religiously observant, and engagement in Thai modernity. The second half of this paper describes the impact of these Thai and Islamic influences on merit-making rhetoric, rituals, and rationales. Malay language loss among urban Malays have led to increasing numbers referring to the generation, accumulation and transference of merit as tham bun (merit-making)⎯an expansive Thai religious idiom. While Thai influences have impacted merit-making rhetoric, Islamic reformism has changed merit (Th. Bun, SM. Pahala) are generating. Traditionalists and reformists both insist that the performance of one’s individual ritual obligations (fardu ‘in) has the biggest effect on Muslim’s comfort in the grave and eschatological vindication. Nevertheless, reformist reject the efficacy of merit transferred to the deceased (except when performed by anak saleh) have led to the circle of posthumous funeral feasts being replaced by merit-transference strategies considered consistent with the sunnah. Traditionalists argue for the efficacy of a range of merit-generating ritual complexes, and that merit-transference is a meritorious act. While Thai influences have impacted merit-making rhetoric, and Islamic influences merit-making rituals, both affect merit-making rationales. Islamic tradition emphatically affirms that one’s the level of one’s store of merit affects one’s comfort in the grave and vindication at judgment. While Malays of South Thailand share the Indic background with other Southeast Asian Muslims, contact with Theravada Buddhism can be seen to have led to a greater emphasis on, and more sophisticated conception of, the economy of merit in South Thailand.\n\nThis article fills some of the gaps in the secondary literature about the growing Muslim presence in the Siamese capital of Ayutthaya during the mid-sixteenth century. It does so by reconstructing the arrival of Tok Takia, a miracle-working Sufi missionary who arrived from somewhere in the Indian subcontinent. The study begins with a description of the Tok Takia Complex which consists of a mosque that once was a Buddhist temple and a maqam where Tok Takia was buried in 1579, before introducing references to the former in Thai primary sources. Although we address details about Qadriyyah presence across the Bay of Bengal, we first reconstruct the geopolitical and commercial developments from the late fifteenth century contributing to the growth of Muslim—and specifically, Kling Muslim— presence in Ayutthaya mentioned in a range of Siamese and Portuguese primary sources. This paper presents reasons for suggesting that Tok Takia’s missionary activism was connected to the Nagore-e-Sharif complex in present-day Tamil Nadu."
