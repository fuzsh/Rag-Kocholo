His full title in Thai is Phra Bat Somdet Phra Paramoruracha Mahachakkriborommanat Phra Phutthayotfa Chulalok (Thai: พระบาทสมเด็จพระปรโมรุราชามหาจักรีบรมนารถ พระพุทธยอดฟ้าจุฬาโลก). He ascended the throne in 1782, after defeating a rebellion which had deposed King Taksin of Thonburi. He was also celebrated as the founder of Rattanakosin (now Bangkok) as the new capital of the reunited kingdom.\n\n19th-century Thai people · 85T\n\n18th-century Thai people · 15T\n\nRattanakosin Kingdom · 19T\n\nBuddha Loetla Nabhalai King of Siam from 1809 to 1824\n\n0 0\n\nrank #4 ·\n\nPhra Phutthaloetla Naphalai (Thai: พระพุทธเลิศหล้านภาลัย; 24 February 1767 – 21 July 1824) or Rama II was the second monarch of Siam under the Chakri dynasty, ruling from 1809 to 1824. In 1809, Itsarasunthon succeeded his father Rama I, the founder of Chakri dynasty, as Loetlanaphalai the King of Siam. His reign was largely peaceful, devoid of major conflicts. His reign was known as the \"Golden Age of Rattanakosin Literature\" as Loetlanaphalai was patron to a number of poets in his court and the King himself was a renowned poet and artist. The most notable poet in his employ was the illustrious Sunthorn Phu, the author of Phra Aphai Mani.\n\n19th-century Thai people · 85T\n\n18th-century Thai people · 15T\n\nRattanakosin Kingdom · 19T\n\nMaha Sura Singhanat Vice King of Siam\n\n0 0\n\nrank #5 ·\n\nSomdet Phra Bawornrajchao Maha Sura Singhanat (Thai: สมเด็จพระบวรราชเจ้ามหาสุรสิงหนาท; Somdet Phra Boworaratchao Mahasurasinghanat, lit: His Royal Highness, Maharurasinghanat, Prince of Front Palace) (1 November 1744 – 3 November 1803) was the younger brother of Rama I, the first monarch of the Chakri dynasty of Siam. As an Ayutthayan general, he fought alongside his brother in various campaigns against Burmese invaders and the local warlords. When his brother crowned himself as the king of Siam at Bangkok in 1781, he was appointed the Front Palace or Maha Uparaj, the title of the heir. During the reign of his brother, he was known for his important role in the campaigns against Bodawpaya of Burma.\n\n19th-century Thai people · 85T\n\n18th-century Thai people · 15T\n\nRattanakosin Kingdom · 19T\n\nJessadabodindra Third king of Siam of the Chakri Dynasty\n\n0 0\n\nrank #6 ·\n\nNangklao (Thai: พระบาทสมเด็จพระนั่งเกล้าเจ้าอยู่หัว) or Rama III (31 March 1788 – 2 April 1851) was the third monarch of Siam under the House of Chakri, ruling from 21 July 1824 to 2 April 1851. He succeeded his father, Rama II, as the King of Siam. His succession was unusual according to the traditions because Nangklao was a son of a concubine rather than that of a queen. His accession was perceived by foreign observers as having usurped the prior claim of Prince Mongkut, who was a legitimate son of Rama II born to a queen, Srisuriyendra. Under the old concept of Thai monarchy, however, a proper king must emulate Maha Sammata in that he must be \"elected by the people.\" Ironically, Prince Mongkut may have later contributed to this misconception, when he feared that his own accession might be perceived by foreign observers as a usurpation.\n\n19th-century Thai people · 85T\n\n18th-century Thai people · 15T\n\nRattanakosin Kingdom · 19T"
