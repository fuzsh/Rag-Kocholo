        "text": "\"He [Robert Hunter, - 1848] did not settle in Bangkok at once, but made journeys to and fromSingapore and traded with the Rajahs of Pattani [كراجأن ڤتتاني], Trengganu [‏ترڠڬانو] and Kelantan [‏كلنتن‎] on these journeys. He also apparently retained business interests in Singapore. Buckley, in his Anecdotal History of Old Times in Singapore, republishes Braddels list of European Inhabitants of Singapore in March 1827. There Robert Hunter is given as of the firm of Morgans, Hunter & Co. There is a record of another trading venture in 1833. George Windsor Earl, who wrote Voyages and Adventures in the Indian Archipelago 1832, 1833 and 1834, describes a journey to Bangkok with Robert Hunter. He says he had on board several seamen belonging to a vessel of Mr. Hunter which had lately been sold in Singapore, and Hattee, a fat good humoured little Siam- Chinese, the personal attendant of Mr. Hunter. Hunter proved a most agreeable companion. He had spent many years in the different parts of the Archipelago and therefore possessed valuable information concerning it.\n\nNo one desiring to do business came to Bangkok without bringing gifts, and Hunter arrived at an opportune moment. King Phra Nang Klao [พระนั่งเกล้า\n\n/ Rama III.] was experiencing trouble at Viengchan [ວຽງຈັນ / Vientiane], and among the gifts which Hunter brought were a thousand muskets from India, which no doubt proved very acceptable at this juncture. The King had the wood on which the the barrels were placed painted red, and these muskets are known in the country to-day as pün rang deng [ปืนร่างแดง]. But despite careful search in likely places I have not been able to find one of these muskets. The Museum has been examined without success, nor does the collection of arms at the Ministry of War contain one.\n\n[...]\n\nBy vessels trading to Siam the building was called the British factory, but to the Siamese it was always known as \"Hang Huntraa.\" The factory was the rallying point for all foreigners visiting the country, and in all the books of the period one finds references to to the hospitality of Robert Hunter, who not only accommodated visitors, but in virtue of his position afforded them introductions to the Siamese and accompanied them to Court when the Sovereign gave audiences.\n\n[...]\n\nAt this time Portugal was the only one of the western nations which had a Consulate established here. It was opened in 1820. But she had little, if any, trade directly with Siam, and no great amount through her East India dependencies. Great Britain was represented in trade by Hunter, and there were several Mussulman merchants whose business brought to Bangkok three or four ships annually from Bombay. The native commerce of the kingdom was carried on entirely by means of junks of Chinese fashion up to 500 tons burthen. Square rigged vessels were first built in the Second Reign by the Phra Klang [พระคลัง], as Government vessels. One was named Buddha Ummarth and the other Riddhi. They were used both for trading and sending Missions to China. In the Third Reign not only were more trading vessels built, but also war ships, such as Siam Bipop, Chop Samute, Soot Sagara, Chon Chap Chor, and Phonephen Tale. The building of these was superintended by the late Regent, known in the Third Reign as Khoon Sit (Luang Siddhi Naiwen), and later by Phra Nai Wai (son of the Phra Klang). Some Siamese and Chinese merchants also built square-rigged vessels, but made the head of the vessel like a junk. Bradley [Dan Beach Bradley, 1804 - 1873] in his calendar, describing his recollections of 1835 (Third Reign), says Hunter had then about four vessels annually making voyages for him. The larger junks plied between Bangkok, Singapore, and Batavia [heute: Jakarta] ; the smaller traded to the ports on the east and west coasts of the Gulf of Siam. Junks in the China trade then, as now, made one voyage each way a year. From February to June there were 60 to 80 of these junks moored in the river in two lines. These junks were practically a great bazaar for a period of two months or more from the time of their arrival. Each junk was freighted with the goods of several parties, and the commodities brought were chiefly teas, silks, Chinese crockery and Japanese wooden and lacquer ware.\n\n[...]\n\nSome stories are still current regarding his business dealings. On one occasion he persuaded an official to provide him with the measurements of the floor of the Amarindr Hall [พระที่นั่งอมรินทรวินิจฉัย], and in due time a costly carpet arrived which Hunter wished to sell to the King. But not only was the price rather high but the official had evidently misled him, for the carpet was much too small; and the King refused to buy. No one else dared to buy it and finally with the Kings permission the Phra Klang was allowed to purchase it, and it long adorned the sitting room of that noblemans residence.\n\nIn 1843 Hunter advised the Phra Klang to have a steamer such as was then in use in Europe. The Phra Klang was in favour of making the purchase if the price was not too high. Hunter ordered the vessel which duly arrived and was moored in front of the Phra Klangs house (until recently the residence of the late Chao Phya Bhanuwongse [เจ้าพระยาภาณุวงศ์มหาโกษาธิบดี, 1830 - 1913]). Capt Bronze brought the vessel out. She was a paddle boat and called \"Express.\" Difficulties arose regarding the price, and the boat was not bought. It is said the King was not impressed and pretended he did not believe an iron boat could float. An experiment was accordingly made with an iron bowl belonging to a priest, and on seeing that it floated Krom Luang Midisawarind, as he afterwards became, then the head of the Chang Sang (department for making arms) examined the steamer and subsequently made a small model for the King to see. His Majesty thereupon declared that there was no need to buy the imported vessel as when such boats were needed they could be made in Bangkok.\n\nAt this time cowrie shells were universally in use as small change, and were brought by vessels coming from Surat [સુરત] and Bombay, together with other goods for the Indian merchants located at Tük Khao and Tük Deng, and there was a considerable profit attaching to their re-sale. A percentage of every shipment was presented to the King and the accumulations were kept in large Sawankaloke jars under the Chakra Vatti Hall [พระที่นั่งจักรพรรดิพิมาน] in the Palace. In the 12th year of the Third Reign the King sent three nobles to visit Singapore and the Malay States, and on their return they reported that a copper coinage was in use in Singapore, and Hunter was requested to submit several kinds, and if one was approved an order would be given. The Phra Klang had two models made. One had Muang Tai [เมืองไทย] in Siamese characters and two stars on the one side, and on the reverse a model of an elephant. The other was a design of lotus flowers. The coins did not commend themselves to the King and, when a small consignment arrived, Hunter found they were not wanted.\n\nNot only did Hunter import, but we also find him conducting a thriving and profitable export business.\n\n[...]\n\nIt may not be without interest to describe briefly the method of commercial intercourse between the firm and the Siamese. Goods were sold on credit, and the mode of payment was principally produce for export, the exportation of ticals being seemingly prohibited. When the sugar produce practically became a royal monopoly, dealers in sugar only being able to sell to the King or his representative, it created an awkward situation for the foreign traders, and Hunter was not slow to lay a complaint before the Governor of Prince of Wales Island [Penang], and later before the Governor General of India. The details which follow are taken from the correspondence published in the Burney Papers. James Hayes, his partner in business, first petitioned the Governor of Prince of Wales Island. After detailing the transactions of the firm in sugar, which Hayes maintained were being carried on at a loss, he proceeded. \n\n\"In 1841 my firm in Siam had purchased up a very large quantity of teakwood timber. The exportation of Teak having been allowed hitherto, no suspicion had been entertained of a prohibition of this article, more particularly so, as the officers of the Siamese Government were aware of our buying up the said timber. If we had been informed beforehand, or while buying this timber, that its export would not be allowed, it would have prevented a very serious loss; but the Siamese did not do so until it was in the act of being shipped, and as it was principally purchased by barter, the price it commanded in Siam, when resold, left us very heavy losers. \"\n\n[...]\n\nAbb.: Angelina Sap (?)\n\nHunter married in 1825, and his bride was Tan Puying [ท่านผู้หญิง] Sap, whose home was close by the Hang Huntraa at Kadi Chin. This lady has quite an interesting ancestry, which it is believed extends back to Constance Phaulcon [Constantine Phaulkon / Konstantin Gerakis / Κωνσταντίνος Γεράκης, 1647 - 1688] of Louvo [ละโว้ = Lopburi / ลพบุรี]. I have put together the information as far as it goes in an attempt to prove the relationship of Tan Puying Sap with Chao Phya Vichayen [เจ้าพระยา วิชาเยนทร์\n\n/ Phaulkon] of Louvo. Phaulcon was married to a Japanese lady, and they had one son. This son afterwards served Siam, and was sent as Envoy to Pondicherry [புதுச்சேரி]. He married a lady of Portuguese descent and died in 1754. There were many grandaughters of Constance Phaulcon but only one grandson, named John. He was taken into captivity at the fall of Ayuthia [อาณาจักรอยุธยา], but escaped in a few years and returned to Siam, settling in Bangkok at Sta. Cruz [โบสถ์ซางตาครู้ส]. One of the grand-daughters was taken to Mergui [ဗိက်] as a prisoner of war, and while there met Jean Chi, a Portuguese Captain in the Burmese Army, and subsequently married him at Mergui in in 1768. He was a Catholic and came from Macao [澳門]. Of this marriage there was a daughter, Philippa, who married one Ta Vian, and was alive in 1861, when a census of the people at Sancta Cruz was taken. Angelina Sap was the daughter of this marriage, and she was born in 1805, and married in 1825 to Robert Hunter. She was thus a great grand-daughter of Phaulcon. The lady is spoken of as being a beauty, extremely fair, with eyes like Queen Victoria. She was accomplished, and it is not unlikely that part of her early life was spent in the palace of Wang Lang [วังหลัง]. In Bishop Pallegoix's [Jean-Baptiste Pallegoix, 1805 - 1862] book is a woodcut of a Siamese lady, which is said to be the portrait of Angelina Sap, and which Chao Phya Bhaskarawongse has recognised. Her portrait was used as being the fairest type the Bishop could get. Before her marriage she was always spoken of as Tan Puying Sap. She dressed grandly and was considered to be the most fashionable person of her day. On great occasions her silk panung [ผ้านุ่ง] was converted into a skirt, and she wore big silk pahoms (black or pale yellow). In old age she was stout, with very little hair.\n\nHunter was a sportsman, and fond of sailing. He had a cutter called \"Friends of about thirty tons burthen, in which excursions to the islands at the head of the Gulf were undertaken.\n\nOf the marriage one son was born, in 1827, and was named after his father. He was sent home to be educated, and when ho returned the father built himself a building on the klong at Sancta Cruz to the north of the factory. It was in front of Angelina Saps old home. Hunter the second married in 1849 Rosa Ribeiro de Alvergarias Noi, the Catholic daughter of Phya Viset Songkram. Of this gentleman Crawfurd wrote in 1822: \n\n I had an interview this afternoon with Pascal Ribeiro de Alvergarias, descendant of a Portuguese Christian of Kamboja. His acquirements were remarkable, for he not only wrote the Siamese, Kambojan, and Portuguese languages with facility, but also spoke and wrote Latin with considerable propriety.....He was married to the lineal descendent of an Englishman named Charles Lister, a merchant who settled in Kamboja in 1701. \n\nHe was descended from the Cambodians who settled in Samsen [สามเสน], but at the time of his daughters wedding was said to be living at Ban Kamen, on the site now occupied by the palace of the Prince of Kambaeng Bejra [กำแพงเพชร]. Robert the second was liked by the Siamese and in the course of time received the Siamese title of Luang Sura Sakorn, and carried on the duties which John Bush was later on to develop, and which are to-day under the control of the Harbour Department. Hunter the second had a great deal to do with Sir John Bowring [1792 - 1872] when that Minister arrived in Siam. On the arrival of the Rattler in the river Hunter went on board, and Sir John says: \n\nAs far as I can see the arrangements tor my entertainment have been confided to the care of Mr. Hunter.  The Rattler after some discussion came up river and moored opposite the British factory.  I am located,  Sir John wrote,  in the building called the British factory, but the building has been reconstructed and put in good order for my reception. I occupy two appartments abovea sitting room, large and airy, and a bedroom which has been newly papered, in which I sleep in a bed which is ornamented with drapery of scarlet and gold and from which garlands of flowers are suspended. Jars of fresh water are placed on my table with bouquets of roses and a Siamese servant speaking English has me in special charge. \n\nAt one of the plays given by the King in honour of Sir John at which Hunter was also present, His Majesty called out to Mr. Hunter suggesting that he should bring Mrs. Hunter to the palace to dance, adding that he knew this lady could dance as well as any of the performers then playing.  It is to be assumed that the King spoke from knowledge as we know that the lady was brought up in the Palace.\"\n\n[Quelle: Moore, R. Adey: An early British merchant in Bangkok. -- In: Journal of the Siam Society. -- 11,2 (1914/15). -- S. 21 - 36]\n\n\"ANDERSON, JOHN (17951845), a diplomatic agent and writer on questions of Eastern policy and commerce, was born in Scotland (Mission to Sumatra, p. 116), and presumably in Dumfriesshire, in 1795.\n\nReceiving an appointment to the civil service of the East India Company in 1813, he became a writer in Pulo Penang [‏بينانج], or Prince of Wales's Island. He was promoted in 1821, when he held the position of deputy-warehousekeeper and Malay translator to the government, to the rank of factor, and to the discharge of the functions of deputy-accountant, deputy-auditor, accountant to the recorder's court, and commissioner to the Court of Requests; the duties of which offices were continued to him on his preferment, in 1823, to be junior merchant. By various steps he had become, in 1826, accountant and auditor, accountant-general to the recorder's court, superintendent of lawsuits, and Malay translator, and in 1827 attained the dignity of senior merchant, with the offices of secretary to government and Malay translator. Later in the same year he was made a justice of the peace for Penang, Singapore, and Malacca (Singapore Chronicle, 6 Dec. 1827). In 1830 he was at home (East India Register and Directory, 1831).\n\nHis first publication was a work entitled Political and Commercial Considerations relative to the Malayan Peninsula and the British Settlements in the Straits of Malacca, Prince of Wales Island, 1824. This work consists of reflections on the Siamese conquest of Quedah [Kedah - ‏قدح] and Perak [‏ڤيرق]; an exposition of the advantages likely to result from declaring Quedah and the whole of the Malayan states under the protection of the British government; and a descriptive sketch of the tin countries on the western coast of the peninsula of Malacca [‏ملاك].\n\nAbb.: Lage von Penang, Deli, Siak und Langkat\n\n[Kaart van Nederlandsch-Indie / H. Ph. Th.

U. Aitchison's Collection of Treaties, Engagements, and Sunnuds relating to India and neighbouring Countries, 8vo, Calcutta, revised edition, vol. i. 1876). Anderson's Sumatran employment bore fruit a few years later in his Mission to the East Coast of Sumatra, in 1823, under the direction of the Government of Prince of Wales' Island: including historical and descriptive Sketches of the Country, an Account of the Commerce, Population, and the Manners and Customs of the Inhabitants, and a Visit to the Batta Cannibal States in the Interior, 8vo, Edinburgh, 1826.\n\nOn his return to this country Anderson entered actively into mercantile and other duties in London, in the course of which he produced a work entitled Acheen, and the Ports on the North and East Coasts of Sumatra; with incidental Notices of the Trade in the Eastern Seas, and the Aggressions of the Dutch, 8vo, London, 1840. This volume attracted much attention to the state of British commerce in the parts of the world of which it treated.\n\nAnderson died, after a short illness, at his house, No. 1 Euston Place, Euston Square, on 2 Dec. 1845, as correctly stated in the Gentleman's Magazine for January 1846 (p. 104). In the first sentence of a more extended notice in the same periodical for the following month (p. 208), he is perplexingly described as of Bond Court, Walbrook, and Prince's Place, Kennington, and as having died on 15 Jan. 1846, at the age of 75; being unaccountably confounded with Mr. John Adamson, a London merchant of the two specified addresses, whose obituary occurs in the Gentleman's Magazine for March 1846 (p. 329).\"\n\n[Quelle: Grant, Arthur Henry <18491917>. -- In.
