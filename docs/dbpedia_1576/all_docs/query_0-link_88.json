        "text": "The past decade or so has witnessed a rapid rise in scholarship that seeks to seize or transform the language of the “science” for liberatory ends. Such an attachment to the reparative and/or divisive logic of “science” is most evident in minoritized knowledge-formations such as sexuality studies and colonial/postcolonial studies. In the face of contemporary challenges about the limits of scholarship bowing out to the forces of globalization, the colloquium will examine what is at stake for sexuality studies and postcolonial studies to carve out a critical relationship to histories of science?\n\nThe types of issues we envisage participants addressing will engage three central questions:\n\nWhat are the conversations instituted about sexuality in relationship to the colonial and postcolonial state in the global south?\n\nHow does sexuality studies’s own adherence/attachment to science studies parochialize key assumptions about freedom, rights and the subject?\n\nWhat are the ways in which modalities of sentiment, affect, emotion entangle with the logic of state discourses and what role does sexuality play within such exchanges?\n\nSchedule:\n\n10:00am–10:15am: Introductory Remarks\n\nAnjali Arondekar, Feminist Studies, UCSC\n\n10:15am-10:30am: Poetic Techne\n\nRonaldo Wilson, Literature, UCSC\n\n10:30-12:30: The Arabic Freud and the Invention of the Psychosexual Subject\n\nOmnia El Shakry, History, UC Davis\n\nRespondent: Alma Heckman, History, UCSC\n\n12:30-1:30: Break\n\n1:30-3:30: Origins and the Sexuality of Science in Colonial India\n\nDurba Mitra, History, Fordham\n\nRespondent: Megan Moodie, Anthropology, UCSC\n\nParticipants:\n\nDurba Mitra, Department of History, Fordham University\n\nOrigins and the Sexuality of Science in Colonial India\n\nDurba Mitra is an assistant professor of history at Fordham University.

Brown / “Contesting Equality of Opportunity: Race and Liberalism in the Freedmen’s Bureau, 1865-1872” / 3:30 – 5:00 / Charles E. Merrill Lounge\n\nWhat did equality of opportunity mean during Reconstruction? Political leaders in the U.S. have assumed that voting rights combined with equality of opportunity would rectify a tortured history of slavery and racial oppression. Yet there is no consistent meaning of equality of opportunity as political elites and activists have struggled to impose their meaning on the idea. Historically, we may distinguish at least two different meanings of equality of opportunity: anti-privilege egalitarianism and the rehabilitation of subjugated populations. I argue that rehabilitation is the template for the Freedmen’s Bureau though the idea is contested by the freed people, who voice a conception of equality of opportunity based on “Negro agrarianism,” and of course deeply opposed by white southerners. I show how racial ideology and conceptions of race influenced the institutionalization of equality of opportunity and the consequences for the freed people.\n\nMichael K. Brown, professor emeritus of Politics, is the author of Race, Money, and the American Welfare State and co-author of Whitewashing Race: The Myth of a Color-Blind Society. His current research focuses on race and equality of opportunity during three moments of madness—Reconstruction, the New Deal, and the Great Society—in six southern states.\n\nWednesday, May 27 / CENTER FOR EMERGING WORLDS / John Modern / Public Lecture: “Akron Apocalypse: Religion, Rubber, and Devo” / 6:00-7:30pm / Humanities 1, Room 210\n\nThe end of the world occurred in Akron, Ohio, in the mid-1970s, when the “Rubber City” lost all its tire manufacturing. Modern narrates the sense of doom deindustrialization brought through Akron’s punk scene and the televangelist Rex Humbard’s Cathedral of Tomorrow.\n\nDr. John Lardas Modern, Associate Professor of Religious Studies at Franklin & Marshall College, will be visiting UCSC in a few weeks for a series of lectures and a reading seminar. Dr. Modern is the author of Secularism in Antebellum America (2011), an eclectic, discipline-shattering book on spiritualism and religion, science and technology, and American secularism. He is currently at work on two new projects: the first explores the intersections of religion and cognition in American history and the second is a meditation on entropy, tentatively entitled “Akron Devo Divine: A Delirious History of Rubber.”\n\nThursday, May 28 / CENTER FOR EMERGING WORLDS / John Modern / Reading Seminar: “Technologies of American Secularism” / 10:00am-12:00pm / Humanities 1, Room 408\n\nWe will read selections from Secularism in Antebellum America and a short piece on American colonial-capitalist modernity.\n\nPlease contact pxalvare@ucsc.edu for more information and/or readings for the reading seminar.\n\nDr. John Lardas Modern, Associate Professor of Religious Studies at Franklin & Marshall College, will be visiting UCSC in a few weeks for a series of lectures and a reading seminar.

The Conditional Waiver of Waste Discharge Requirements for Discharges from Irrigated Lands (“The Conditional Agricultural Waiver”) is the primary regulatory mechanism to achieve Clean Water Act TMDL requirements for water toxicity in California. Using policy documents, monitoring and enforcement data, meeting minutes, interviews, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping, Drevno describes the rise and fall of the two pesticides spotlighted for regulation in the Central Coast Region. Results from this study indicate that the 2012 Central Coast Conditional Agricultural Waiver successfully reduced the use of diazinon and chlorpyrifos, but several unintended consequences, such as pesticide switching and continued toxicity, remain.\n\nThe Friday Forum is a graduate-run colloquium dedicated to the presentation and discussion of graduate student research. The series will be held weekly from 12:00 to 1:30PM and will serve as a venue for graduate students in the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Arts divisions to share and develop their research. Light refreshments will be available.\n\nFor more info, or to inquire about joining the roster of presenters for the 2015-16 academic year, contact: fridayforum.ucsc@gmail.com\n\nFriday-Saturday, May 29-30 / CENTER FOR EMERGING WORLDS / Global Islam: A Weekend of Film and Video / Communications 150, Studio C\n\nFriday, May 29\n\n4:00-5:30pm: Videos by Mounir Fatmi including Mixology (2010), Technologia (2010), and Rain Making (2004); Discussion with Tarek El Haik, Assistant Professor, Cinema, San Francisco State University & Peter Limbrick, Associate Professor, Film and Digital Media, UC Santa Cruz.\n\n7:00-9:00pm: The feature film is Dernier Maquis/Aden, dir.
