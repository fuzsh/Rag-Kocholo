        "text": "By John & Wendy\n\nLast year held plenty of changes, and their timing isn’t always what you’d prefer. For instance, had to move out of our rental home and into our very own house at the same time as the Indianapolis Theatre Fringe Festival a/k/a IndyFringe 2023, in August through early September.\n\nWith no real time to sit down with WordPress, and the world of quick-post media in flux (emphasis on “X”), we decided to write short reviews to post to Facebook (where we are also /PlaysWithJohnAndWendy). Those pieces are reproduced below.\n\nPosted early September 2023: As many of you know, John & I have bought a house and are moving into it. Therefore, the reviews below compromise our entire Fringe experience for this year.\n\nWe did our best to see as many shows as possible and only missed out on a few. Please understand and forgive us if your show was not one we saw. We did our best, but our personal lives had to overtake our reviewing duties this year.\n\nThanks everyone for an amazing Fringe this year and we look forward to seeing you again next year. Break legs and much love! – Wendy\n\n–\n\nLISTED IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER\n\nTitles: 3 Magic Wishes – Alice’s Wonderful Afternoon – Angel on Eros – A Bat in the Wind – Because, You’re Worth It – The Betsy Show – Between Trains – Beyond Ballet – Bread Crumbs – Breakneck Romeo & Juliet – A Curious Woman – Currents – The Curve – The DECAGON Project – Designated Debaters – The Dice Player – Dragons & Dungeons – An Evening with Matt Soverns – Flavor Fight – How the Grinch Solved Racism – I, Trump – Inner State Stories – The Jester of All Maladies – Let Me Say This About That – Momsplaining – Monica Cantrel: Journey Home – A Monster Calls – The Most Massive Woman Wins – Mush – Nerdgasm – No Better News – On Earth as it is in Hell – Plastic Potato: A Bottoms Up Mystery – Reject – Rhythm & Groove: Songs of the 60s and 70s – Shy: The Musical – Super Mario Is Dead – That’s Hot – Three 2 One – Twenty Years: A Comedy of Manners – Twisted Terrors – U Sing 2 – Voyages & Journeys – Zoe Rose Spills Her Guts\n\nWriters: JB – John Lyle Belden; WC – Wendy Carson\n\n–\n\n“3 MAGIC WISHES” with Jordan Rooks\n\nExperience a delightful journey of storytelling and magic as our host finds a magic lamp and wishes to put on the best magic show in the Fringe.\n\nRooks does an excellent job of finding new takes on tricks you’ve probably seen before and also a few that are unique. His tricks do not fail to amaze both old and young alike. The overall theme holds true, especially at the end when he must make his third and final wish, and the question of what people do or should wish for is considered.\n\nThe show is a fun time to share with the whole family and will keep you talking about it for a while afterwards. – WC\n\n–\n\n“Alice’s Wonderful Afternoon”\n\nThis is a splendidly fresh re-telling of a curious (and ever “curiouser”) girl’s adventures in Wonderland, presented by the students of University High School of Indiana. Alice’s afternoon companions, including her sister, narrate the story as our heroine follows a nervous White Rabbit, deals with size issues, meets more talking animals and playing cards, attends a mad tea party and a high-stakes croquet game, encounters a nicely puppeted Jabberwock, and goes nowhere with a pair of poetic twins. The genuinely youthful voices and free-form use of stage space aid the surreal atmosphere and make the familiar narrative engaging. Accompanying music is more familiar to today’s kids, with the effective use of instrumental passages by artists such as Linkin Park, The Offspring, and Garbage, and providing a “Beastie” beat to some well-known verse. Our talented young actors deliver with spirited energy, keeping the story easy to follow through all its odd turns. A wonderful experience for all ages, spend some time with “Alice” at the Athenaeum Indy on the last days of IndyFringe 2023. – JB\n\n–\n\n“Angel on Eros”\n\nAngel is an artist whose inspiration has dried up. He decides to change things up and get a job. Matt runs a struggling restaurant where Angel ends up as a waiter. They strike up a fast friendship much to the chagrin of the chef who is also Matt’s demanding wife.\n\nThis is a story of inspiration, desire, and narcissism but mostly friendship. Male friendship can be confusing especially when being gay & straight is involved.\n\nBright, daring, sexy and enjoyable. Not for the younger crowd but a treat for the grown ups. – WC\n\n–\n\n“A Bat in the Wind”\n\nCasey Ross seems to alternate her Fringe performances between the downright silly (last year’s Tortillo offering) and deeper more meditative studies of artists (her Portraits series). This year she digs deep and gives us a gritty look at an aspiring young writer and his connection to his pathetic, alcoholic neighbor.\n\nWe witness a tragic dance in which each takes the lead at some point and our writer realizes that one small step is all it takes to make you plummet into the depths of despair. The characters are only loosely based on real people, so it’s even more sad that no one here escapes unharmed.\n\nThis is a truly powerful hour of theater that will keep you thinking for a long time after. – WC\n\n–\n\n“Because, You’re Worth It”\n\nThis is definitely a quintessential Fringe show.\n\nYou find yourself a shopper at The Fairyland Mall where you will witness three unique and dazzling takes on the classic tales of Narcissis, Cinderella, and The Emperor’s New Clothes.\n\nWhile the latter two utilize modern and classic dance techniques to tell their stories, the costumes and choreography bring a captivating look and feel that is honestly so beautiful it’s impossible to explain.\n\nThe first tale is given to us by Daisy, our helpful makeup counter guide. While her attempt to give an audience member a makeover starts snarky and then takes a supremely surreal turn, she is a sheer delight to behold.\n\nMy only regret was that the final five minutes of the show, in which all the performers interacted together to close their shopping day, was in constant strobe light and I was unable to watch.\n\nStill, this was an amazing show that has skyrocketed to my top five of shows this Fringe.\n\n– WC\n\n–\n\n“The Betsy Show”\n\nElizabeth Young-Collins returns with a more autobiographical story, told with colorful scarves and delightful bits of song. Feeling like her life is one big performance, she comes to terms with the character she was meant to be. Learn how her family was featured in a national magazine and why she truly loves Paris – but not the champagne. So fascinating, the hour was over before I realized it. Feel free to get swept away at The District Theatre during IndyFringe . – JB\n\n–\n\n“Between Trains”\n\nThe Indiana Drama Club brings us this sweeping metaphor of the journey of a soul through the trials and tribulations they will face in the future.\n\nIt is described as a play with music which is very apt. The songs that occur throughout, are sometimes a reflection of what’s happening and sometimes just to continue the mood.\n\nPerformed with two cast divisions gives the young cast members more opportunities to be in the spotlight.\n\nOne note: Friends and family of the large cast are causing sellout crowds. Buy early if you plan to attend. – WC\n\n–\n\n“Beyond Ballet”\n\nIf you appreciate the dance arts at all, you must see “Beyond Ballet” by Indianapolis Ballet. As part of IndyFringe it is the most affordable way to see this professional company. And it’s more than just standing on your toes to orchestral music, the exceptional control necessary for Ballet allows for marvelous modern numbers as well. Featuring the artistry in motion and choreography of William W. Robinson as part of a talented company of around a dozen dancers. They’re “Too Darn Hot!”\n\nPerformances at the Athenaeum Indy up in the Basile. – JB\n\n–\n\n“Bread Crumbs”\n\nRichie Whitehead is a master of taking familiar material and mining every last drop of humor out of it. This is the story of the ocean’s wrath against a lighthouse keeper. While that may sound deep and serious, the biggest hurdle will be preventing yourself from injury through laughter.\n\nWhether portraying the capricious ocean, a grizzled Lightkeeper, or even the titular character, his unique take on these characters is a delight to behold.\n\nThis is a treat for all ages that shouldn’t be missed. With his recent relocation to the Chicago area, I hope we will have more opportunities to witness his talent in the future. – WC\n\n–\n\n“Breakneck ‘Romeo and Juliet’”\n\nTimothy Mooney Repertory Theatre brings us his latest offering “while he’s still able to pull off playing a 13-year old girl.”\n\nEmphasizing the cosmic imagery throughout the script as well as the fact the show only covers a five-day period, the show brings a few new insights to the story you thought you were so knowledgeable of.\n\nWhile it is a wonderful introduction to Shakespeare for younger viewers, Mooney finds a humorous freshness to the tale which will appeal to all attendees. – WC\n\n–\n\n“A Curious Woman”\n\nPart storytelling, part self-encouragement and entirely enjoyable. Debra Clark has lived a very interesting life and we are privy to a few highlights showcasing many highs and lows of the rocky road to her successfully fulfilling her greatest desire.\n\nWhile her stories will help nourish your soul, each seat contains a tasty snack to help nourish your body. – WC\n\n–\n\n“Currents”\n\nRelatively new local dance company Relevations (yes, spellchecker, that’s right) has an impressive set of numbers in “Currents” in Athenaeum Indy at IndyFringe\n\nPower with flow and resistance, elements of ballet and hip-hop, music includes Drake and Foo Fighters. Stunning solos and excellent ensembles. Check em out. – JB\n\n–\n\n“The Curve”\n\nThis review of “The Curve” is brought to you by Facebook, apparently the lesser evil. The show isn’t about that, but it does have “commercials” like this, as well as snarky puppets. But it’s not about them, either.\n\nIt’s about “The Curve”, the arc of the spine essential for a Chinese acrobat (think Gymnastics with showbiz flair). Teacher tells Genie Cartier hers isn’t good enough. But she can’t accept that, can she?\n\nIt’s about the arc of a life –- a chair, calluses, firespinning, Halloween with Scientologists, the stories told by X-rays, an MFA in poetry, and good advice from a clown.\n\nThis masterful memoir with movement charms and fascinates with her narrative, dance and acrobatic moves. From the clever “opening titles” to the end when she reclaims her body, this is a can’t-miss show (ignore what the shark puppet says).\n\nOnly two performances of “The Curve” left, this evening and tomorrow afternoon (Aug. 19-20) in the Athenaeum Indy auditorium (first floor) as part of IndyFringe. – JB\n\n–\n\n“The DECAGON Project”\n\nThe 46 Minutes Collective brings us a totally unique hour of theater that is eternally changing. Stories, dialogue, movement and some level of audience participation (only if you wish to participate) combine to give us intimate insight into various interpersonal relationships as well as our own psyches.\n\nThis is another example of what a Fringe show should be. – WC\n\n–\n\n“Designated Debaters”\n\nWho knew an ultimate battle between superheroes would center on arguing the merits of socks and underwear? “Designated Debaters” are unafraid to confront such vital issues in an elaborate improv style drinking game.\n\nThe Friday battle of Batman vs. Superman, moderated by Wonder Woman, is done, but you can still see the pop culture icon showdowns of horror legends hosted by the Mistress of the Night on Saturday, and Broadway leading men with a grown-up Orphan Annie on Sunday. The District Theatre cabaret will fill up fast, so get tickets quick and prepare for nonstop laughs as practically any topic is confronted in the silliest way. – JB\n\n–\n\n“The Dice Player”\n\nThis show defines exactly what the Fringe Festival is here for. It brings a new and unique voice to audiences that might not ordinarily get the chance to experience it.\n\nRaja El Majzoub tells the story of a soul that survived through sheer chance, a roll of fate’s dice, perhaps? It is a powerful and intimate experience that is beautiful yet harrowing to behold.\n\nDo not miss this show; you will surely regret it. – WC\n\n–\n\n“Dragons and Dungeons: A Party’s Parody”\n\nThe most important thing I can say about this show is that if you don’t get a ticket now, you’re going to miss it. The two remaining shows have less than a dozen tickets left and you will greatly regret missing this hilarious offering.\n\nThe show gives us a tale of a few characters adventuring through Center Earth on a heroic quest. The audience fills out some suggestion slips prior to the show to help flesh out their background.\n\nAudience members are also called upon during the show to roll the dice which decides the fate of that activity.\n\nEven if you have little to no knowledge of the game being parodied, you will enjoy the zany characters and the wild story. But be warned, not only is the story’s outcome in your hands, so too is your destiny. Get one of those remaining tickets now or lose our forever. – WC\n\n–\n\n“An Evening with Matt Soverns”\n\nWhile he got his start at a Broad Ripple club, Matt Soverns has been touring the country and some of the globe homing his performance and piano skills. While he has spent much of his time playing covers, in this show he gives us a taste of his own original work.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the concert and found his style reminiscent of the style of early Billy Joel, Elvis Costello, and a bit of Jerry Lee Lewis with his more boogie-woogie touches. He even borrows a riff from The Roots, creating a song on the spot about an audience member.\n\nJust a note, if you absolutely can’t catch his show, he does have a great merch display in the lobby so you could pick up a CD or two and find out what you missed. – WC\n\n–\n\n“Flavor Fight”\n\nHas actor/improvisor Mark Cashwell finally topped himself, or is that just caramel sauce and whipped cream? His “Flavor Fight” richly parodies various cooking shows such as one would find on a Network of Food. Cashwell stars as Gavin “Gay” Ferrari, connoisseur of sloppy food from questionable locations, joined by Paige Scott as deep-South deep-fried butter-obsessed Cathy Bean, as well as one or two other characters portrayed by local funny people Mark talked into doing this.\n\nTwo “chefs” are summoned from the audience to compete in various games, earning ingredients for the final challenge. Yes, the edible and inedible components will be odd, silly, and not likely meant to end up on the same recipe card – but that’s what makes this whole mess fun. Also, the nonstop improv and escalating weirdness.\n\nJust know that in the end, there will be something cooked. And everyone may get a chance to taste it afterwards (if you dare, though the winning dish at the episode I attended was pretty good). – JB\n\n–\n\n“How the Grinch Solved Racism”\n\nWhat begins as a thesis presentation of Capitalism throughout the Jim Carrey movie version of “The Grinch” quickly devolves into a farcical journey on Consumerism, Racism, Climate Change, Nixon, and Chinese Exclusion, just to name a few.\n\nBouncing from silly to starkly serious, the audience is in for a very strange ride in which not only can anything happen, they may accidentally even learn something.\n\nIt’s not for kids, but definitely for those with a more eclectic sense of humor. – WC\n\n–\n\n“I, Trump”\n\nThe end of our recent President’s command of the headlines will happen eventually. “I, Trump” at the Athenaeum Indy, part of IndyFringe, gives one way it could happen. As funny and satirical as it is, the show looks practically prophetic compared to the events of the last several years. – JB\n\n–\n\n“Inner State Stories”\n\nThe rise of the Interstate system connected America, while bypassing much of it. Here are “Inner State” stories about a mother’s love, maps marked with red pencil, memories of roadside attractions, and a journey to see those disappearing places accompanied by the spirit of one who would have enjoyed them. Presented by Errol McClendon, it’s a show that’s as easy and interesting as a good spiced rum cocktail. Also, if you have a road-trip roadside attraction story, he would love to hear it! – JB\n\n–\n\n“The Jester of All Maladies”\n\nAfter a last-minute cancellation at last year’s Fringe, Kurt Fitzpatrick brings us the tale of his bout with cancer. While the subject matter is serious and frightening, Fitzpatrick’s storytelling abilities keep the journey upbeat and hopeful. In fact, he manages to find humor throughout the entire story.\n\nAfter an initial diagnosis in December of 2019, an initial treatment regime, and a diagnosis of remission, he finds the disease returns with a vengeance and must endure even more desperate measures to combat it. But this summer he celebrated two years of remission, on the way to many more.\n\nAgain, it’s very weird to tell you that you will laugh uncontrollably at someone’s cancer story, I must tell you that this is indeed true. With only two shows remaining, I strongly encourage you to make a concerted effort to fit it into your schedule. You won’t regret it. – WC\n\n–\n\n“Let Me Say This About That”\n\nLet me say this about “Let Me Say This About That,” it is one of the funniest improv–based shows we have ever seen. Heather (Meyer), Danna (Sheridan), and their producer Amber (a/k/a Raffi Jarvis) present episodes from the Imaginary Podcast Network. These women easily riff off of each other and whatever the audience throws at them, at times so smooth you’d think it was scripted and rehearsed. Our performance started with a general interest ‘cast that became a hilarious stream–of–conscience series of what should have been non–sequitur that somehow still linked. After a couple of instantly–composed ads, our second podcast was “live” with questions from the audience (feel free to get clever, they can handle it). After another improv ad break, things got truly surreal, yet it all fit so well in the evening’s “theme” it ended on a callback.\n\nEven if you’ve never heard or heard of a podcast (think NPR, but with the hosts on good drugs), this is one of the more fun hours of IndyFringe. – JB\n\n–\n\n“Momsplaining”\n\nIn “Momsplaining,” two major local talents – actors, directors, producers – employ those skills to address another important role they share: Motherhood. Myths are busted as bodies are ruined to perpetuate the species. Informative and hilarious, with much empathetic laughter from the women in the audience. Callie Burk, Georgeanna Smith Wade, and (I would suspect) your Mom think you ought to see this, at The District Theatre cabaret stage, part of IndyFringe. – JB\n\n–\n\nMonica Cantrell: “Journey Home”\n\nThe exceptional Monica Cantrell graces us with her beautiful soulful voice in her “Journey Home”, singing a program that includes standards, songs by Sondheim, cuts fron “The Wiz” and even a hit by Sting. Accompanied brilliantly by Kathy Ryan on piano, Cantrell commanded a full audience and likely will again so get tickets now, at The District Theatre as part of IndyFringe . – JB\n\n–\n\n“A Monster Calls”\n\nWith “A Monster Calls,” Carmel High School brings another stellar production to this year’s Fringe Festival.\n\nConnor is a troubled young man. He is experiencing nightmares, being bullied at school, and his mother is fighting cancer. The demonic tree that terrorizes his dreams promises to return each night and tell him a story, and on the fourth night he must admit the truth of what he truly fears.\n\nThe stories are haunting tales in which no one is truly good or evil, but a mixture of both. He is never sure if anyone actually gets what they deserve in each. They also vaguely echo situations within his life, and keys to dealing with them.\n\nWhen his time for a story occurs, his heart breaks with his personal truth but it leads to a better understanding of himself and how to proceed.\n\nThis beautiful show can be a bit intense for younger viewers, but a recommended grim fairy tale for all others. – WC\n\n–\n\n“The Most Massive Woman Wins”\n\nFirst of all, this show has a plethora of content warnings, and for good reason. Frankly, being overweight increases the likelihood of depression, self–harm, drug use as well as a myriad of other debilitating conditions.\n\nSpeaking as someone who personally identified with and experienced almost all of the stories here, this show is raw and brutally honest. That said, it feels liberating to hear these stories in a public venue. I know that some of the content is hard to hear, and I imagine it was quite difficult for the cast to share, but every word here is somebody’s truth.\n\nOverweight people are still grossly discriminated against and it is considered socially acceptable to do so. These women bravely bare their souls during the show and deserve our attention, respect and adulation for it. – WC\n\n–\n\n“Mush”\n\nLiterally a sobering tale, “Mush” is an intense 30–minute one–act about a young man and his father reaching the breaking point in their relationship with alcohol, and each other. Voices and thoughts and denial and bargaining leave the mind the texture of gruel, susceptible to the ravenous Jabberwock behind the bottle. Can an imperfect father’s love prevail?\n\nPerformed on the Cabaret stage at The District Theatre during IndyFringe . – JB\n\n–\n\n“Nerdgasm (2023 edition)”\n\nWonder(ful) Women at Angel Burlesque “Nerdgasm” to open IndyFringe. For mature folks with immature senses of humor, lots of naughty fun! – JB\n\n–\n\n“No Better News”\n\nThe good news about “No Better News” is that there are more opportunities to give this one–woman show the big audience it deserves. Gael Schaefer uses her recent battle with cancer as a catalyst for entertaining stories about her entertainer life. Find out how an introverted actor made her way from a park that inspired Walt Disney to performing on Disney’s Big Red Boat to her present life in New York and the theatre life that sustains her. Inspiring and engaging, hear the “News” in the first floor auditorium at the Athenaeum Indy as part of IndyFringe . – JB\n\n–\n\n“On Earth as it is in Hell”\n\nThe modern concept of Christian Hell doesn’t go as far back as what you think, though its roots are deep. Andrew Spink takes us on one heck of an underworld journey where little girls are gremlins, ancient Greeks are toddlers, and we find what we should truly fear. Balancing researched material with an easy manner and personal touch, he enlightens this dark subject. – JB\n\n–\n\n“Plastic Potato: A Bottoms Up Murder Mystery”\n\nBefore going into the Athenaeum Indy Basile (upstairs) theatre to see “Plastic Potato: A Bottoms Up Murder Mystery,” it is advised that you bring in a beverage as we are asked to drink every time an adult beverage is mentioned. I recommend it be non–alcoholic as the booze and beer references are all over the place, including most of the character names.\n\nThe ever charming and effervescent Josiah Ray McCruiston joins the ranks of comic masters like Peter Sellers and Eddie Murphy by playing absolutely every on–stage character except for Mitchell Hedges as IMPD Detective Bob, who grows ever frustrated at this compounding murder mystery. Poor Jimmy Beam has died in front of the theater, and it was not an accident! Now Reo Nite and her family of curious and suspicious characters must be questioned.\n\nCan you guess whodunit? The audience will be asked – fortunately, more untimely deaths will narrow the suspect pool. And if it helps, the titular potatoes will make an appearance. – JB\n\n–\n\n“Reject”\n\nAnthony Myers is a relative newcomer to the Fringe circuit, but has nearly a lifetime of experience to bring to his show, “Reject.” He looks back to his birth and adoption in Terre Haute, Ind., and the family who accepted him – some perhaps reluctantly. Now that he’s in his 60s, he confronts society’s rejection of the old.\n\nWith the practiced skill of the teacher, standup, and storyteller he has been, Myers gives charming perspective on his world, and ours. He reassures us that regardless of your being young or old, the operative word is “be.” Accept the opportunity to join him in the Athenaeum Indy first–floor auditorium, part of IndyFringe. – JB\n\n–\n\n“Rhythm & Groove: Songs of the 60s and 70s”\n\nA truly groovy good time with Circle City Tap Company with “Rhythm & Groove: Songs of the 60s and 70s”. They dance to the music of artists including The Supremes and Earth Wind & Fire, go on the “Dock of the Bay,” to the “Car Wash” and out to the “Copacabana.” Also see what they do with the unique drum rhythm of “Come Together.”\n\nAs always, they end with the audience invited to join the Shim–Sham, so bring your happy feet (and shoes if possible). – JB\n\n–\n\n“Shy: The Musical”\n\n“Shy” is the story of two people who share the same bus commute.\n\nAfter taking notice of each other, we are witness to their varying thoughts about whether or not they should take a chance on getting to know the other perhaps romantically.\n\nWhile their imaginations often skew to the extremes, they are nevertheless enjoyable to watch.\n\nA treat for anyone who has considered or is considering taking a chance on a potential relationship. – WC\n\n–\n\n“Super Mario is Dead”\n\nJosh Brown and Matt Day bring us a wacky tale of what could happen within the Mushroom Kingdom should Super Mario finally run out of lives.\n\nWhen Luigi refuses to take over, things shuffle along as best they can. However, a new menace arises and Luigi reluctantly agrees to join the crew in their quest.\n\nAll of the usual suspects are involved or referenced here. Zany songs and jokes abound. A must for any fan of the games. Also you can play a game betting how long the mustaches will remain attached to the various actors. – WC\n\n–\n\n“That’s Hot”\n\nThis is the story of two world–renowned vulcanologists shooting a documentary about the impending eruption of Mount Priapus, or is it?\n\nThe fiery Helena is running hot while her driven husband/partner Rudiger is too cool to be distracted by her advances. What is behind his reluctance, and what will or could his future hold?\n\nJoin his strange journey as he navigates his way through time (the audience) and sees several different variations of his life thanks to the strange, red–robed cabaret singer.\n\nA delightfully enjoyable trip that will surely leave you feeling warm inside. – WC\n\n–\n\n“Three 2 One”\n\nMary Karty gives us the story of one woman’s quest to bounce back from her recently failed relationship.\n\nHer psyche breaks down into three basic components, Heart, Body, and Mind. These three try to work together (or more often, assert dominance) in order to try to navigate dating possibilities.\n\nThe zany situations may seem a bit over the top at times but they honestly all rang true to me. We should all encourage more men to see it as a primer to how a woman’s mind really works. – WC\n\n–\n\n“Twenty Years: A Comedy of Manners”\n\nEver had a dry vintage that turned out delicious? I’m not talking about wine, I’m referring to the wit of “Twenty Years: A Comedy of Manners” at The District Theatre as part of IndyFringe. Thomas Smith and Craig Kemp are at the top of their game as a wealthy English gentleman in 1880 and his lawyer (and apparently only friend). It occurs to the master of the estate that he’d best find the bastard offspring he had long disregarded so that there will be someone to inherit. With a satirical air, and hilarity more akin to Wilde than Python, the search proceeds to a nice resolution, with Kellyn Merrell, Sean Wood, and Ben Elliott appearing as potential heirs. One of the treats awaiting Fringe–goers in this third and final weekend of this year’s festival. – JB\n\n–\n\n“Twisted Terrors”\n\nMike Speller serves up a three–course meal of delightful twists on traditional literature.\n\nOur Appetizer consists of a sly turn of a Pie classic as we look at a dieter’s struggle with his appetite in “The Cravin’.”\n\nThe Main course is a very inventive take on Homer’s “Odyssey.” complete with Food Trucks, Rachel Ray, and living gingerbread men. The story itself is hilarious but the greater your knowledge of the source material, the more delightful it becomes.\n\nWe finish up with a Dessert Tray of quick takes on a few familiar tales including the five new commandments added as a result of Mary Shelley’s work.\n\nFamily friendly but sadly only here for one week. Don’t miss it. – WC\n\n–\n\n“U Sing 2”\n\nKevin Kelso likes to write clever little songs, and to sing them. In his offering for this year’s IndyFringe , “U Sing 2”, he encourages – insists, actually – that the audience join him in song. The sing–along bits are fairly easy, and Kevin makes it fun.\n\nThough listed as “all–ages” the content gets a bit PG, but nothing obnoxious (you might not bring a small child, but perhaps your mother). Discover a new Birthday song, a potential theme to a popular podcast, and help Kevin achieve his “Sweet Caroline” moment – or something similar, he says every show is a little different. Join the fun at The District Theatre cabaret stage. – JB\n\n–\n\n“Voyages & Journeys”\n\nWell worth coming aboard for “Voyages & Journeys” with Seda Negra / Black Silk dance, directed by Iris Rosa Santiago. With a singular theme, the dancers are nearly constantly present, as well as the suitcases which symbolize our being ever on the journey, old world to new. Beautiful and easy to comprehend movement telling our important shared story. Watch for this next weekend at the Athenaeum Indy , part of IndyFringe. – JB\n\n–\n\n“Zoe Rose Spills Her Guts”\n\nThis show is a delightful character study of a few quirky characters.\n\nThe first is a thoroughly woke and enlightened frat bro who parties hard but thoughtfully. Since he always wakes up with no memory of the night before, he faithfully writes in his journal before passing out. Also, he can’t miss his sunrise yoga (his mantra is “bro”).\n\nThe second is a young British tap dancer who is heartbroken over being fired by her married boss whom she has been having an affair with. Her obsessive stalking leads to more trouble but an outlet for some great poems.\n\nWe are then treated to a clown who performs some really great gags (with the help of the audience).\n\nFinally, we hear from Zoe herself as she shares excerpts from her childhood diary.\n\nThis is a charming show that will keep you laughing and reflecting for a while afterwards. – WC"
