        "text": "Archive for the ‘Poetry’ Category\n\nWhere the tide took us this week\n\nJanuary 20, 2023 @ 6:38 pm | Filed under: Books, Homeschooling, Poetry\n\nhttps://melissawiley.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bonny-Glen-Hauge-and-Fillyjonk-post-012023.m4a\n\nI want to end the week with a few notes about our homeschooling high points. Olav Hauge was a big hit, and apart from a side-trip to Elizabeth Bishop’s “One Art,” we roamed through my Hauge books every day.\n\n“This Is the Dream” provoked intense discussion—\n\nThis is the dream we carry through the world\n\nthat something fantastic will happen\n\nthat it has to happen\n\nthat time will open by itself\n\nthat doors shall open by themselves\n\nthat the heart will find itself open\n\nthat mountain springs will jump up\n\nthat the dream will open by itself\n\nthat we one early morning\n\nwill slip into a harbor\n\nthat we have never known.\n\nMy copy of The Dream We Carry (named after a line from “This Is the Dream”) has the original Norwegian on the verso and the English translation on the recto. Rilla, curled up beside me, enjoyed comparing the two versions. She was struck by the lovely image of the mountain springs “jumping up” and reached for Google Translate’s snapshot feature to compare the literal (and much less poetic) translation. That led to a line-by-line unpacking of the language. The Hauge collection Luminous Spaces has an entirely different translation and we got really caught up in discussing the figurative and connotative differences between these variants:\n\n…that we one early morning\n\nwill slip into a harbor\n\nthat we have never known\n\n(from The Dream We Carry, translated by Robert Bly)\n\nand that one morning we’ll glide\n\ninto a cove we didn’t know\n\n(from Luminous Spaces, translated by Olav Grinde)\n\nthat I one early morning will glide\n\nin on a wave I have never known\n\n(Google Translate’s rendering of the original—interesting that it’s in first person singular, when both English translations use we)\n\nSlip into a harbor, glide into a cove, glide in on a wave—such distinct and potent images, each in their own way.\n\nThere are buckets more I could say about our Hauge conversations, but the only one I’ll mention now is the Fillyjonk connection. We’re reading Tales From Moominvalley and today we finished the scene in which the anxious, constantly catastrophizing Fillyjonk tries to share her worries with her neighbor, Gaffsie, over tea in her gloomy seaside house:\n\n“…This calm is unnatural. It means something terrible is going to happen. Dear Gaffsie, believe me, we are so very small and insignificant, and so are our tea cakes and carpets and all those things, you know, and still they’re so important, but always they’re threatened by mercilessness…By something one can’t ask anything of, or argue with, or understand, and that never tells one anything. Something that one can see drawing near, through a black windowpane, far away on the road, far away to sea, growing and growing but not really showing itself until too late. Mrs. Gaffsie, have you felt it? Tell me that you know what I’m talking about! Please!”\n\nGaffsie, a practical and restrained creature, doesn’t get it. She’s uncomfortable with the Fillyjonk’s demonstration of emotion, and she doesn’t have much use for a dramatic recitation of all the terrible things that could happen—because none of them have.\n\nThe poor Fillyjonk! Hauge’s dream is utterly closed to her—so far, at least.\n\nToday this chapter sent me leaping (like a mountain spring) to read Hauge’s poem “We Don’t Sail the Same Sea”—\n\nWe don’t sail the same sea,\n\nthough it looks the same.\n\nRough timber and iron on deck,\n\nsand and cement in the hold,\n\nI ride low, plunge\n\nheadlong through breakers,\n\nwail in fog.\n\nYou sail in a paper boat,\n\nyour dream fills its blue sail,\n\nso soft is the wind, so gentle the wave.\n\nHauge struggled with depression and had to endure some very dark periods. Some of his poems acknowledge a sense of bleakness or of brooding menace—Fillyjonk feelings. I think the two of them do sail the same sea. But Hauge has the promise of that dream, the promise that some day the doors will open to a world where mountain springs jump up and and the wind fills a blue sail. I have hopes that the Fillyjonk, too, will encounter that dream—perhaps through an encounter with the Moomintroll family, or with Snufkin, later in the book. Right now she’s wailing in fog—with a kind of raw courage, the kind it takes to “plunge / headlong through the breakers.”\n\nWell. At the end of lessons today I said we’d be moving on from Hauge next week, and such a clamor arose! Scott and the children think not. It seems I’ve been remiss in hoarding Hauge to myself all these years. I’m so happy they find him as compelling as I do.\n\nhomeschooling high school, moomins, Olav Hauge, Poetry, Tidal Homeschooling, tidal learning\n\n“I get up. It’s lighter.”\n\nNovember 29, 2021 @ 10:10 am | Filed under: Assorted and Sundry, Books, Poetry\n\nThis is the poem that carried me through this year, more than any other. “One Poem a Day” by Olav Hauge, from his lovely book The Dream We Carry. Those last lines especially—\n\nI get up. It’s lighter.\n\nHave good intentions.\n\nAnd see the bullfinch rise from the cherry tree,\n\nstealing buds.\n\nThere have been so many days during the pandemic (and before) when I’ve walked around thinking: Have good intentions. Look for the bullfinch, the buds.\n\nIn her wonderful book Keep It Moving: Lessons for the Rest of Your Life, Twyla Tharp urges us to “make sharing delight into a daily occurrence,” or, as she puts it a few pages later, to find “the Daily Miracle. Find something that pleases you greatly first thing every morning when your mind is fresh.”\n\nMary Oliver puts it like this:\n\nEvery day\n\nI see or hear\n\nsomething\n\nthat more or less\n\nkills me\n\nwith delight,\n\nthat leaves me\n\nlike a needle\n\nin the haystack\n\nof light.\n\n(From “Mindful” in Why I Wake Early)\n\nWhat, for you, is the bullfinch rising from the cherry tree, stealing buds, today? Your ‘daily miracle’ for this last day of November? What little thing, ordinary or extraordinary, has more or less killed you with delight?\n\nlittle happy lists, Olav Hauge, Twyla Tharp\n\nAstonished at the voices of Willamette and wren\n\nJanuary 23, 2020 @ 8:22 am | Filed under: Assorted and Sundry, Nature Study, Poetry\n\nWould you like to hear this post read aloud? Allears has invited me to try their new voice recording studio for bloggers. I’d love to know what you think! (If the embedded audio player isn’t visible below this note, try this link.)\n\nMost mornings I’m still sipping my first cup of caffeine when Huck rolls in for a snuggle in my writing chair. He’s markedly up-tempo at that time of day, and I’m still dragging. One way I manage the discrepancy in our states of alertness is to reach for a book of poems, which he’ll dive into eagerly and read aloud while my brain catches up to his speed. The Everyman’s Library Pocket Poets Haiku volume is a favorite and usually sparks some sweet discussion about the trees, the sky, the rain.\n\nMisty rain;\n\nToday is a happy day,\n\nAlthough Mt. Fuji is unseen.\n\n—Basho\n\nThat’s a pretty good one for a January day in Portland. For us it’s Mt. Hood and Mt. St. Helens, the latter of which we can glimpse in parts of our neighborhood on very clear days. When we catch sight of Mt. Hood, we’re usually in the car. “The mountain is out today!” someone will exclaim. Or: a delighted gasp and a cry of “Super Death Mountain!” which is what Scott and the kids call our local volcanoes. Third winter here and volcanoes are still a novelty for my gang.\n\nOnce a week Huck and Rilla attend classes at a co-op near the science center. Rilla has a free hour that we’ve been spending at the museum, a pretty giddy experience for both of us. We want every single thing in the gift shop. We spend long, absorbed minutes trying to solve brainteasers in one of the exhibits. We look out at the gray river in the rain and make plans for walks along its bank in the spring.\n\nAfter Rilla heads to her classes, I have a chunk of time on my own—still as much of a novelty for me as those glimpses of volcanoes! Often I’ll have a work date at a café with my friend Shannon. On days she can’t make it, I walk to a nearby ramen shop for lunch and then take my laptop to the riverside cafe at the science center. I could eat there, but I really love ramen. I love the unavoidable single-tasking of eating it. You have your chopsticks in one hand for the noodles and the big spoon in the other hand for the broth, and that’s it, that’s all you can do—just eat this meal. No screens, no books even—you’d splash drops of broth all over the page if you tried. I sit where I can look out at the winter streets and watch people hurry or mosey past, and I imagine what David Sedaris would write about them in his diary. What Ross Gay would notice. What Joan Didion would see. Later, if I remember, I write down what I saw.\n\nNot often, though—by the time co-op is over and I’ve driven back home, my mind has rushed on to the next thing, the next thing. This week we stopped at the bird shop for suet cakes. A flock of bush tits, tiny gray-brown things, swoops to our feeder every day for a feast. A female Northern flicker visits daily, and sometimes the male. Or maybe he comes every day too and I just haven’t caught the moment. We get downy woodpeckers and three chickadees and an occasional nuthatch, and of course lots of goldfinches and house finches. A pair of pine siskins. One sweet little Bewick’s wren. And sometimes a hermit thrush or two strides under the bare bushes, flinging leaf litter left and right in search of insects.\n\nWithered branch\n\nwhere a crow has settled\n\nautumn nightfall\n\nAnother haiku from Basho, who wrote of being “astonished at the voices of mountain streams and wild birds.” Astonishment, yes. Every day, the world astonishes me.\n\nBasho, birdwatching, haiku, ramen\n\nAlways leave thread in the needle\n\nSeptember 19, 2019 @ 1:14 pm | Filed under: Poetry, Writing\n\nA poem-of-sorts I shared on Medium last week: Advice to Writers: Always Leave\n\nAlways leave thread in the needle and the sentence half-written.\n\nThe plunge into chill water is the hardest part, so leave the burner on, the hot tap running.\n\nDon’t let ink sit in the pen for too long — it clogs the nib. You’ll lose time momentum interest scraping a dry point across your skin until the clot dissolves.\n\nAlways leave the iron on. You may return to find useful scorch marks, or with luck ashes you can read like tea leaves.\n\nFail to secure the lids of your garbage bins. While cleaning up the raccoon rummagings, you may happen upon lost notions or revelatory peelings. Sweep up the spilt verbs and reassemble them into cracked sentences. Smells are the best glue.\n\nRead the rest here.\n\ncreative practice, medium, Poetry, writing, writing life, writing process\n\nCommonplace Book: Lawrence Ferlinghetti’s Poetry As Insurgent Art\n\nMay 13, 2019 @ 12:47 pm | Filed under: Books, Poetry\n\nWhat times are these\n\nWhen to write a poem about love\n\nIs almost a crime\n\nBecause it contains\n\nSo many silences\n\nAbout so many horrors….\n\n(His reworking of Bertolt Brecht’s “What times are these when to talk about trees is almost a crime because it implies silence about so many horrors?”)\n\n***\n\nStrive to change the world in such a way that there’s no further need to be a dissident.\n\n***\n\nDon’t let it be said of you that sluggish imagination drowned out the slush of your heart.\n\n***\n\nDon’t hew stones. Dip into the sea for poetry, every poem a live fish.\n\nbook quotes, commonplace book, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Poetry As Insurgent Art\n\n“Look for a lovely thing and you will find it”\n\nNovember 22, 2017 @ 8:51 am | Filed under: Books, Family, Fun Learning Stuff, Homeschooling, Poetry\n\nAs often as not, this is what our Poetry Teatime looks like: circus animal cookies on a Dominoes napkin. Yesterday we didn’t even remember to bother with something to drink. Although it doesn’t take much to elevate the event (plates would be a good start) 😉 — there are days when you know you’ll miss your moment if you don’t jump right in. This was one of those days. We had just enough time left in our morning for a no-frills poetry teatime and a short nature walk, or a frillier tea and no walk at all. The vote was to squeeze in both.\n\nHuck certainly doesn’t care, as long as poetry teatime contains the two essentials: cookies + Shel Silverstein. He had us all howling with “The Nap Taker” (“I did not take a nap— / The nap took me”). Beanie picked the Lewis Carroll collection (more howls) and Rilla chose a family favorite: Jack Prelutsky’s Imagine That! Poems of Never-Was. (When she read “The Multikertwigo” I had such déja vu. I will always hear that poem in wee Jane’s four-year-old voice.)\n\nI, of course, read selections from Favorite Poems Old and New. There would be a mutiny if I reached for anything else.\n\n(I sneak more contemporary poems into other parts of our day. These children mustn’t grow up without some Billy Collins in their lives.)\n\nJack Prelutsky, Lewis Carroll, Poetry, poetry teatime, Sara Teasdale, Shel Silverstein\n\nHe holds him with his glittering eye\n\nSeptember 7, 2017 @ 5:55 pm | Filed under: Assorted and Sundry, Poetry\n\nHMMM, I just realized my Diigo sidebar feed hasn’t been updating. If you like to check in on my Caught My Eye section, I’ve fixed the problem now. You especially shouldn’t miss Gabrielle Calvocoressi’s gorgeous and devastating poem, “The Sun Got All Over Everything.”\n\n“…which seems like something I’d make up in a poem\n\nexcept this time I actually did it.\n\nI wrote: Grieve. Because we’re all so busy\n\naren’t we? And so broke.”\n\nLately it seems like poetry is the one constant in my day. (Well, and nail-biting.) We slid back into high tide about a week ago—albeit a choppy one, since I have to slip away for an hour in the middle of every morning to lie on a table that looks like something out of the set of 2001: A Space Odyssey—and what fits best into the allotted space are poems. Giddy over the thought of a Real Autumn, I turned to the “almanac” section of Favorite Poems Old and New and am working my way through all the seasonally appropriate verses. And then I’m reading “Rime of the Ancient Mariner” a section at a time—I can’t remember what prompted me to reach for it last week, but I’m glad I did because it’s been a big hit. You know it warms the cockles of this mama’s heart to hear her young children actually pleading for me to keep going, just a little more. I mean, of course they love it, it’s a good old-fashioned ghost story. Huck has joined the ranks of those tormented by the question of why the Old Mariner shot the Albatross. Why?\n\nSide note: I had to chuckle over this stanza:\n\nHe holds him with his glittering eye—\n\nThe Wedding-Guest stood still,\n\nAnd listens like a three years’ child:\n\nThe Mariner hath his will.\n\nI know Coleridge had a pretty good handle on childhood—“Frost at Midnight” is in my top five favorite poems—but “listens like a three years’ child”? You mean the Wedding-Guest is wiggling and thumping his heels on the floor and interjecting questions into the tale every four seconds?\n\n***\n\nThank so you much to all of you who have subscribed to my Patreon!

(But I promise you some Poetry Friday at the end.) The child whose blog name was decided before his real name was firmly settled upon…turns eight years old today.\n\nOh for boyhood’s painless play,\n\nSleep that wakes in laughing day,\n\nHealth that mocks the doctor’s rules,\n\nKnowledge never learned of schools,\n\nOf the wild bee’s morning chase,\n\nOf the wild-flower’s time and place,\n\nFlight of fowl and habitude\n\nOf the tenants of the wood;\n\nHow the tortoise bears his shell,\n\nHow the woodchuck digs his cell,\n\nAnd the ground-mole sinks his well;\n\nHow the robin feeds her young,\n\nHow the oriole’s nest is hung;\n\nWhere the whitest lilies blow,\n\nWhere the freshest berries grow,\n\nWhere the ground-nut trails its vine,\n\nWhere the wood-grape’s clusters shine;\n\nOf the black wasp’s cunning way,\n\nMason of his walls of clay,\n\nAnd the architectural plans\n\nOf gray hornet artisans!\n\nFor, eschewing books and tasks,\n\nNature answers all he asks;\n\nHand in hand with her he walks,\n\nFace to face with her he talks,\n\nPart and parcel of her joy,—\n\nBlessings on the barefoot boy!\n\n—from “The Barefoot Boy” by John Greenleaf Whittier\n\nThe poem’s final stanza paints a somewhat grim vision of the boy’s likely future—”Made to tread the mills of toil,/Up and down in ceaseless moil”—but we’ll acknowledge that the weary adult may from time to time experience a pang of envy, looking at the carefree child with his life before him, “living and laughing as boyhood can.” Eat, drink, and be merry, the poet seems to be urging the child, for tomorrow you must get a job.\n\nThis bleak perspective sent me seeking to find out more about Whittier. I learned that he worked as editor of several weekly papers, including the New England Weekly Review, and was a passionate and active abolitionist. His anti-slavery publications and lobbying efforts earned him much enmity, including being stoned by angry mobs. He was politically active, pushing for legislation to end slavery, and was a founder of the Liberty Party which eventually morphed into the Free Soil Party. In addition to numerous abolitionist pamphlets, he published two volumes of antislavery poetry. In the late 1840s and ’50s, he served as editor of an influential abolitionist paper called The National Era. He was one of the founding contributors of the Atlantic Monthly. He was supportive of women writers, and in fact Sarah Orne Jewett, with whom he worked closely, dedicated one of her books to him. In short: Whittier was one of the good guys. And the wistfulness with which he urges the Barefoot Boy to celebrate his current joy and freedom makes sense in the context of Whittier’s grim awareness of the work that awaits him in the adult world. The more I learned about him, the more I saw that my initial take on the poem was a bit reductive.\n\nI came to realize this was a particularly apt poem for me to ponder on my son’s birthday, here at the dawn of 2017. I understand why Whittier can’t extol the delights of a magical childhood—rooted in the small delights of the natural world, “rich in flowers and trees,/ Humming-birds and honey-bees…”—without his mind running to the toil that awaits the boy when he’s grown. We’re not finished yet. In the world of man, there remains a great deal to be done.\n\nThis week’s Poetry Friday roundup can be found at Keri Recommends.\n\nHuck, John Greenleaf Whittier, Poetry, Poetry Friday\n\npoetry friday: “America, why are your libraries full of tears?”\n\nNovember 11, 2016 @ 8:51 am | Filed under: Poetry\n\nAmerica this is quite serious.\n\nAmerica this is the impression I get from looking in the television set.\n\nAmerica is this correct?\n\nI’d better get right down to the job.\n\nIt’s true I don’t want to join the Army or turn lathes in precision parts factories, I’m nearsighted and psychopathic anyway.\n\nAmerica I’m putting my queer shoulder to the wheel.\n\n—from “America” by Allen Ginsberg\n\nRing the bells that still can ring\n\nForget your perfect offering\n\nThere is a crack in everything\n\nThat’s how the light gets in.\n\n—from “Anthem” by Leonard Cohen\n\nWhy Poetry Is Viral in the Aftermath\n\nAnd poetry keeps the intensity and the passion of a point of view, but in a forum where people aren’t hurting each other. It says, “Here’s what it’s like from my point of view.” All you have to do is listen to the poet.\n\nAnd, in that, you don’t have to be anything other than what you are. The poem is a catalyst where you’re bringing two different kinds of people together. And at its best, when it works, there’s a kind of spark, and everyone comes away illuminated by what the spark has ignited.\n\nPoems to visit today:\n\n“Differences of Opinion” by Wendy Cope\n\n“Tenacious” by Tanita Davis.\n\nAnd here’s one from me.\n\nFall\n\nby Melissa Wiley\n\nI have quit romanticizing\n\nsmall towns. Don’t tell me\n\nsomewhere Miss Daisy and the Colonel\n\nsip sweet tea from green glasses.\n\nDon’t say Dog Monday pats its patient\n\ntail on the swept platform.\n\nYou know Doc Gibbs is no longer\n\nin network. Behind trim doors fixed eyes\n\nwatch what all of us are watching.\n\nSome of the mothers smoke still.\n\nTheir strong son the quarterback\n\nsnaps his frame: splayed limbs,\n\nfanned hair, the blue dolphin vaulting\n\noff the tanned swell. His swell friends\n\nretweet. Here the wagons are circling.\n\nThere is plenty of posterboard.\n\nSix fine pumpkins up the porch steps,\n\nand artful corn husks: pin this. Touchdown\n\nat Grover Cleveland High. Hear the roar\n\nshivering the bruised leaves of the Bradford pears\n\non Elm Street above the patter of talk\n\nradio. The limp girl among the red cups\n\nunder the butternut tree cannot\n\nhear what they are saying in the cities.\n\nThis week’s Poetry Friday roundup is hosted by Jama’s Alphabet Soup.\n\nPoetry Friday"
