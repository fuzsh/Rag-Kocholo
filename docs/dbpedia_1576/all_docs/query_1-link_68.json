        "text": "Crazy idea of the day‚Äì what if we created an admissions process based on ‚Äúgrit‚Äù? If you haven‚Äôt read the book, ‚ÄúGrit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance‚Äù by Angela Duckworth, I could not recommend it enough. Dr. Duckworth defines grit as ‚Äòthe ability to sustain and work toward long-term goals, despite setbacks, and self-control as the regulation of one‚Äôs behavior through concentration and effort. These‚Äîmore than intelligence, quality of instruction, family life, or income‚Äîdetermine a child‚Äôs educational achievement.‚Äô The study actually followed a few of my West Point classmates. Researchers said ‚ÄúCadets who displayed that special quality of ‚Äúpassion and perseverance for long-term goals of personal significance‚Äù were more successful during basic training and the four-year military academy that followed. To quote Scott Galloway ‚ÄúState-sponsored education is who I am, and how I got here.‚Äù There is no doubt in my mind that I was a product of Affirmative Action. Being a kid who grew up in Harlem in the 80s, the product of a single-mother household, on WIC‚Äìthese \"setbacks\" shaped me to be the man that I am today. Army Ranger School was easy compared to growing up in Section-8 housing. So my question is, how can we build an admissions process that looks at a broader set of factors that are strong predictors of success and create a healthier society reflective of the values that built this great country‚Äìhard work, grit, and equal access to opportunity? If anyone knows Admissions Officers who are looking at impactful ways to expand their talent pool, I‚Äôd love to see how Equity Quotient, with our vast access to socioeconomic data, can help invest in future leaders of tomorrow :)\n\nThe federal Title I program has been around for nearly 60 years, is funded at $18 billion a year, and supports academic and non-academic programs across the nation's schools -- with an emphasis on helping students in poverty. In a new story, EdWeek Market Brief breaks down the results of a survey of the country's district and school leaders on how they use that money for core academic subjects, social-emotional learning, school counseling, and resources for English-language learners and special needs populations. The story is based on nationally representative survey by the EdWeek Research Center. Title I is likely to become even more important over the coming year, as school systems reach the end of a historic amount of federal stimulus money. https://rebrand.ly/kpt6lcy\n\nLearn more about the Virginia Literacy Act before it is fully implemented in the 2024-2025 academic year. This research and policy brief offers an overview of the VLA. It is structured to explore the following questions: 1) What are the recent trends in reading achievement in Virginia? 2) What are the policy implications of the VLA for Virginia school divisions? 3) What does the research say about Science of Reading (SoR)? 4) What core instructional programs are approved to meet the VLA? It concludes with a series of key takeaways and recommendations. https://lnkd.in/eF5KFTyk VCU School of Education Chesterfield County Public Schools Hanover County Public Schools Henrico County Public Schools Richmond Public Schools Virginia Education Association Virginia Department of Education National Network of Education Research-Practice Partnerships (NNERPP) ‚Äì Rice University\n\nPLEASE SHARE! This course delves into the examination of social, political, educational, and cultural factors influencing relationships between parents and schools. It involves analyzing neighborhood resources, school climate, and parent perspectives to provide teachers with insights on being effective mediators and advocates. A significant focus is on Civic Learning/Community Engagement, specifically a project aimed at enhancing parent engagement in low socioeconomic areas. Students, as future leaders, will develop the necessary knowledge and skills to address the needs of their field and community, emphasizing giving back in the context of Chicanx and Latinx Studies. The course requires a Civic Learning project, fostering practical application of learned theories through group or individual work.\n\nResponse üìù to Pedro A. Noguera What you ask is the minimal. We must not allow student to forget history but we must also embolden them to manifest their futures. As a life-long educator, I argue that those seeking to eradicate ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù have linked themselves to legislation and school boards with hidden agendas. Opting to promote willful ignorance, welcome biased external influences, and I believe the most have a personal stake in hindering students academic acuity - never forget the adage an ignorant society (person) is easier to control. Educators must assume the onus of navigating flawed federal and state legislation, all the while cultivating the cognitive growth of students in the face of acknowledged obstacles such as antiquated academic standards; politicized school districts; inadequate funding; societal disrespect and community devaluation of educational institutions and educators; societal mental health challenges not to exclude educators, students, parents; problematic student discipline & harmful discipline practices - both can be true; insufficient educator compensation in a period of national inflation; unprecedented teacher shortages; parent apathy; just to name a few. Yet, good educators continue to show up and out for our students. Loving ü•∞ the work and curating space of belonging for them. The incorporation of Black history into the curriculum should be regarded as a fundamental requirement for educators, as they endeavor to foster the ambitions of students and enable them to pursue their individual and collective brilliance. But it is as imperative to provide support to students on how to effectively critically think ü§î on ways this history can be applied to the present circumstances and in some cases used to innovate viable solutions. If not, they‚Äôll be no education system to set expectations because the issues will enivitavebly grow bigger than the work force and Robert Smalls efforts will have been for nothing.\n\nIf you're someone who is talking about, planning for, trying to provide, or demanding \"quality early care and education,\" I urge you to spend some time with Defending the Early Years' free, virtual summer institute \"Advancing Quality in Defense of Early Childhood Education and Care\" from June 24-26. \"Quality has always been an important component in ensuring that all young children have access to early care and education. Nonetheless, defining, measuring, and guaranteeing high quality demonstrates the complexities and difficulty in making high quality for all a reality. What does quality mean to you? How do you demonstrate quality in your program or classroom? How can the systems used to measure quality be improved? What does high quality mean in relation to justice and equity for disadvantaged and marginalized children? The 2024 Sixth Annual DEY Summer Institute will address these questions and many more.\" Click the for more information or to register!"
