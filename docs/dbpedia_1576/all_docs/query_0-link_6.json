This is because SMP are subject to a boycott due to anti-Palestinian racism from one of their employees, and their own subsequent inaction to counter it. Until the point that they take action, we will not be including their titles on our lists (or, in the event that we have inadvertently done so, we will be flagging those titles) as part of the boycott. For more detail info, head to Readers for Accountability.\n\nPlease note: we have removed titles by Freydís Moon after on discovering they’re a pseudonym for Taylor B. Barton/Taylor Brooke who was accused of racism, bullying, & pretending to be Latine a few years back.\n\nIf you like this post, please consider supporting me on ko-fi.\n\nShare this:"
