        "text": "In July of 1989, with the rest of the three-year old Portland Lesbian Choir, I carpooled up to Seattle for the third GALA choral festival. GALA is the Gay and Lesbian Association of Choruses. (Well… the acronym used to stand for that – a few years ago, the organization changed the name to BE the acronym, in recognition that we are far more than ‘lesbian and gay’ these days!) Our thought at the time was, “The Portland Gay Men’s Chorus has been going on and on about this event for months now, we might as well go see what all the fuss is about! We can drive to Seattle. The next one will be in Denver and there’s no way we’re going to Denver!” By the end of that magical week, we were plotting and scheming how to get to Denver. The PLC has never missed a GALA choral festival since, nor has PGMC.\n\nSo what made it so special? A women’s chorus workshop with Bernice Johnson Reagon, teaching us to approximate sounding like Sweet Honey in the Rock? The closing ceremony, 3,000 of us forming a ring in a huge outdoor plaza, holding hands as Holly Near stood in the center, leading us in singing “We are a gentle, angry people”? Rehearsing for a women’s festival chorus, meeting singers from all over, realizing the dynamic of diva first soprano and butch second alto was not unique to the PLC? Yes. Yes. And yes!\n\nAnd singing for each other weeklong. There is no audience like GALA, all of us choral singers, all of us having the same conversation for months. “Who can take the time off work? Who needs financial aid to get there? What can we do to make sure all of us are there who can possibly make the trek?” And the directors – “What should we sing for each other??? What should I pick for us to sing that will showcase who we are, and that no other chorus will also be singing???”\n\n1992, Denver. 1996, Tampa Bay. 2000, San Jose. 2004, Montreal. 2008, Miami. 2012, Denver. 2016, Denver. 2020 – well, we all know what happened to 2020… 2024, Minneapolis. I haven’t missed any of them, singing in one chorus or another. If you are a fan of the Portland Lesbian Choir, or the Portland Gay Men’s Chorus (hopefully both!), then you know what these choruses bring to your life. Sustaining hope, building community, singing for our lives. It’s no accident choral singing originated in spiritual traditions. Converging on a single note of unison thins the barriers between us, making our interconnection so palpable, for singer and audience alike. Converging at GALA strengthens the power of the choruses, an energy we bring right back to you.\n\nWe blew the roof off Minneapolis, over 7,000 of us converging in six square blocks. Eight years of drought lifted, singing in unison once again. This screen shot from the GALA Choruses website says it all, the countdown to 2028:\n\nSome years ago, I participated in a project sponsored by the Portland Art Museum, creating an intergenerational LGBTQ+ exhibit. One aspect of the exhibit paired people from different generations, allowing an opportunity for questions and answers in both directions.\n\nI was paired with a 17-year-old non-binary high school student. I was gifted with the opportunity to learn what it was like to live a non-binary identity in high school. And they said to me, “I’m so glad I get to ask you questions, I don’t know anything about the history of this community I’m part of!”\n\nThis comment struck me, as it occurred to me, “How could you? How much LGBTQ+ history is taught in any high school?” Upon further inquiry, it turned out they had read a one-paragraph summary of the Stonewall riots at some point. They knew there had been an AIDS epidemic. That was it.\n\nWe had a wonderful several-hour conversation as I caught them up on some community history based in my own personal experience; in turn, I learned a lot about navigating high school while living in authenticity with a queer identity.\n\nIf we don’t transmit our own community history, it will be lost to history. I have participated in several interviews for Queer archives. I talk about intergenerational communication in presentations. I take advantage of random opportunities to have deep conversations intergenerationally with folks I meet, learning from them as they learn from me.\n\nIf we are accurately informed about the past, we will have a better sense of where we came from, and more respect for the elders who helped us get where we are today. And we can avoid rewriting our own history. As an example, I recently heard a young non-binary person refer to the term ‘FTM’ (female-to-male) as a binary slur intended to demean those who transition away from a female birth assignment. In fact, this was a term that came of age when I transitioned in the mid-1990s, one of the first community-created terms to replace ‘transsexual.’ It was a first attempt at trans people taking over our own terminology, not allowing others to define who we were. We felt empowered by the term FTM. I was quite taken aback to hear it described as a slur.\n\nOur communities build and thrive and grow because of the efforts of previous generations. And this includes my own generation. I came out as a lesbian at 19, in 1974. It didn’t occur to me at the time that the blossoming community development of my generation was built on the efforts of a World War II generation that began taking very cautious steps out of the closet. I now wish I’d had an opportunity to talk with someone from that generation as I was coming out.\n\nWe all of us come into the middle of history. There’s no such thing as the beginning or the end. We move forward from what has come before, and others come after us to carry on. Respect and story-telling across generations can help our communities be more united in our support of each other, especially in these times of conservative backlash against who we are.\n\nIn 1999, trans folks began commemorating trans people who had been murdered because of their identity. November 20 became Trans Day of Remembrance. In 2010, a different idea came into fruition – let’s celebrate our lives as well as commemorating those who have died. Today is Trans Day of Visibility.\n\nTrans people have nothing in common beyond not being okay with the gender we were assigned at birth. Race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, age, political affiliation – nothing else is common ground. If you think about it, the same applies to cisgender people – they have nothing automatically in common except that they’re okay with the gender they were assigned at birth. So, when I talk about the importance of visibility, I’m speaking only for myself.\n\nI’m as out as possible for a transman 28 years on hormones. We transmen are an invisible population unless we deliberately come out. I’d have to wear a neon sign around my neck for folks to know I’m trans just by looking at me. So, I do presentations, write for ShoutOut, talk to various groups – whatever I can do to put a face to the identity ‘transman.’ I published my memoir. For me, every day is Trans Day of Visibility.\n\nWhy do I feel so strongly about coming out? Because I didn’t know who I was until June of 1995. I had thought I was a lesbian; I was increasingly unhappy and anxious as the years went by, though I had no idea why. I don’t know if I would ever have figured out who I really was if a partner hadn’t come out to me, saying, “I’ve always felt like a man inside and if I had the money, I’d have an operation tomorrow.” This put my identity in my face so prominently, my denial could no longer function.\n\nMy partner was 37 at the time. I was 39. Neither of us had ever heard of a transman; neither of us knew anyone who was trans, and would not have been able to accurately define the identity if you’d asked us. My partner happened to see a magazine article about a transman and thus found out transition this direction was even possible. Though my partner had always had the self-knowledge, he had never known transition this direction was a thing. (I say ‘he’ now, though it took a long time for me to use the correct pronoun without bitterness and anger)\n\nI repeat: neither of us had ever heard of a transman. And this is precisely why I come out now at any opportunity, why I welcome visibility – I look to the day when no one will have to wait until 39 to find out their identity exists. The day when people will have an opportunity to understand their identity at young ages because they see themselves reflected in movies, on television, in books.\n\nI see this day on the imminent horizon, far more trans visibility culturally. And this has led to a sharp uptick in anti-trans reactions, from legislation to violence, from people who don’t want us to exist; they see us as polluting U.S. culture, seducing their children away from the literal straight and narrow. What keeps me going, gives me hope for the future, is a saying I keep firmly in mind as I live my life: first they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you – then you win.\n\nI broke my leg on November 30, 2000, ending up in a non-walking cast with crutches. I lived in the most unsuitable apartment imaginable – up twelve stairs from a parking garage, then a LONG walkway, up six more stairs, then another LONG walkway, then up twelve more stairs to my second-floor apartment.\n\nI didn’t leave my apartment if I could help it. My sister came over weekly to help with my laundry. I had groceries delivered. I was in graduate school at the time, and made the trek down to the parking garage twice a week to go to classes.\n\nI finished my master’s thesis six months early. There was no Netflix or social media to distract me. Television only interested me to a certain degree. What to do??? I know! I’ll write my memoir! By the time my cast was off and I was released to walk again, I’d finished writing my life to date.\n\nThat document sat on my hard drive, untouched, unread, for the next 20 years. And then – stuck at home once again, this time in the midst of a pandemic quarantine. What to do??? I know! I’ll write the second half of that memoir!\n\nThus Work in Progress progressed, and now is published, available on Amazon. https://www.amazon.com/dp/199892467X Please ask your favorite bookstore to stock my book; if the store is local to me, I’m also happy to do a book reading. Bookstores can order copies through my publisher: admin@transgenderpublishing.ca\n\nAs I said in the introduction: “This book presents a deeply personal point of view. I leave it to others to write histories of trans people at a more sociological level. Trans people need to tell our stories to each other, to provide this continuity that has been sadly lacking in previous times. Isolation and feelings of being negatively unique are common among many trans people, in part because this historical continuity has been lacking.”\n\nOkay, now what? Hive mind – what’s my next book about???\n\nSeptember 1 is my birthday. My neograndson Theo did me the honor of booking his flight back to England on Sept. 3, not leaving on my birthday. Our sense of loss in this household will be profound.\n\nTheo has been with us since January 29, planted serendipitously in Portland as he sorted out his visa to be ‘student’ rather than ‘tourist.’ (For back story see the previous three blog entries) In that seven month period, he has been able to achieve everything related to early transition – legal name and gender change (affecting everything from his driver’s license to his passport), beginning hormones, and having chest surgery. Just as important are the invisible changes – centering into himself as his hormone balance aligns with his identity. Initially Theo was running away from an unsupportive biological family. Now he’s focusing on his new life, new possibilities, moving forward with confidence rather than running away into an uncertain future.\n\nTheo came to my attention in my capacity as a PFLAG board member. I’ve been a member of the Portland PFLAG board since 2014; PFLAG is a perfect fit for this former therapist, supporting families as they learn what they need to know to be allies to an LGBT+ family member. As a therapist, I was gifted with the experience of watching trans clients blossom, helping facilitate this life-changing process of self-actualization that we call transition. As a PFLAG board member, I have been gifted with the experience of helping family members shift their perspective, helping them embrace the gift of knowing their LGBT+ family member more fully.\n\nNow I am the neograndad, gifted with the experience of a family member transitioning while living with me. My wife Cristina and I took Theo in as a mitzvah, what our church would see as an example of ‘good works.’ It wasn’t long, however, before we viewed him as a grandson who had been missing from our lives. We are all family to each other. I recently came across a meme that perfectly captures our experience. A young boy sits on a tree branch, speaking to an injured sparrow in a cage next to him. The boy says, “I’ll take care of you until you can fly again.”\n\nThe sparrow responds, “But then I may leave you.”\n\n“Yes,” says the boy, “that’s the point.”\n\nFly free and far, Theo!\n\nIt’s been seven months since I first wrote about needing to form Team Tim, seeking support for a young man transported from England to Portland to take care of bureaucratic issues around a visa. (See https://reidvanderburgh.com/2023/02/26/team-tim/ and https://reidvanderburgh.com/2023/02/26/what-a-great-town-we-live-in/ for the back story)\n\nHow times have changed… Now, it’s fine to use his real name, Theo; he no longer fears his biological family has any power over the course of his life (and he’s right).\n\nLet’s see… he landed here with Wendy (his UK mom) on January 29. As I write this on July 20… Three days ago, Theo celebrated four months on hormones. His speaking voice is beginning to have baritone overtones to it. I tease him about that, as I’m a baritone in the Portland Gay Men’s Chorus and Theo sang in the first tenor section in the June Pride concert, a Disney extravaganza. I am the baritone section rep, and threatened to be Theo’s section rep were he to sing with the chorus again. As it is, my wife is the first tenor section rep, so he would be switching from one to the other of his current family.\n\nAs we were rehearsing the concert, the chorus was told there were opportunities for two-minute storytelling scattered throughout the show. The story category “Life’s a Journey” spoke to me, so I submitted the following story and told it during the concert:\n\n“The path toward happiness in life along the wrong gender trajectory isn’t an easy one. You don’t know it to look at me, but I’m a transman. In 1974, I fell in love with a woman and it seemed to explain everything: ‘No wonder I always felt different, like I didn’t fit in –I must be a lesbian!!!’ However, over the next twenty years or so, I still felt uncentered, not fitting in with myself. Eventually I realized I’d misunderstood my identity back in 1974 – I wasn’t a lesbian, I was a transman.\n\nLong before I transitioned, I ventured forth several times on solo cross-country bicycle trips. I was having lunch in a Midwest café at some point and got to talking with a local guy. When he found out I was riding my bike cross-country, he joked, “That’s what trains and planes are for!” However — Boston was my destination; the journey was my goal.\n\nDo I wish I’d understood myself back in 1974 and transitioned when I was 19? Not really. My journey through life was meant to be convoluted. Do I wish I could have snapped my fingers back in 1995 and hey, presto, I’m a man? No, an authentic life requires a journey, not a snap of the fingers.”\n\nThe category that spoke to Theo was “Magical Families,” and he read this during the concert:\n\n“Growing up in a conservative city in California, I understood two things relatively young: One: I was a boy, not a girl. Two: that would not be safe in the family I was born into.\n\nThankfully, I met my boyfriend online: Jack, who just happened to live in Manchester, England. Two weeks after I turned 18, I ran away from home, boarded a plane from LAX to the UK, and told my biological family not to contact me until they were able to love me not as their daughter, but as their son. The plan was to unite with my boyfriend Jack and begin University in the Fall. When I arrived, I instantly felt more loved and supported by Jack and his parents than I ever had at home. Unfortunately, it quickly became apparent that I didn’t have the time or the funding to secure a Student Visa. We tried everything, but in the end, I would have to go back to the United States until I could get my Visa for the next school year.\n\nKnowing that returning to my biological family was not a safe option, Jack’s mother, Wendy, sent thousands of emails to charities across the US, looking for somewhere I could stay. Months went by with no response, and I had to leave England in only a few weeks. I was terrified. I had nowhere to go. Finally, someone replied: Reid Vanderburgh from the Portland PFLAG chapter. We threw together a plan. As soon as I arrived in Portland, an overwhelming connection and love sprouted… just like it had in Manchester. These people helped me move out here, find a place to live, they saved my life; and, as a bonus, I now sing with PGMC.\n\nAs I expected, I haven’t spoken to my biological family since I left California. But with the loss of one family, I’ve gained not one, but two chosen families who I now can’t imagine my life without.”\n\nWendy and Jack made the journey from Manchester to see this concert. They were here for a magical week. Wendy and Jack both fell in love with Portland, and Wendy told me if she was twenty years younger, she’d transplant her family here immediately. As it is, by the end of their visit we had come up with a new last name for all of us: Vandermingdale, combining all our last names into one. Theo no longer feels he has two families; we are all one family to each other now.\n\nOh, and by the way – Theo is scheduled for chest surgery Aug. 15. His visa process is well underway, and he will be on his way back to England in early September with all his early transition goals checked off or in process. Thank you: Abigail, Bo, Sue, Mark, Carissa, Jordan, Charlotte, Bridging Voices, the Portland Gay Men’s Chorus, and Portland PFLAG. It’s taken a village.\n\nOn January 27, I wrote a piece for Shout Out titled You’ve Got a Friend, outlining the convoluted journey of a young transman named Tim. He had moved from southern California to England to live with a new family of choice, starting a new life for himself, out from under the extreme religious conservativism of his biological family; he saved the money for the trip surreptitiously, and has no desire to tell his biological family anything at all about his current life or hopes for the future. After nearly six months happily living a new life, he found himself faced with visa issues that necessitated returning to the U.S. to get his paperwork in order so he could remain in the U.K. indefinitely.\n\nHis adoptive U.K mom Kathy sent emails to many dozens of LGBT+ organizations all over the U.S., seeking advice, seeking help, seeking any kind of support that might be offered. Portland was on several people’s short list of cities that might be a supportive place for Tim to take refuge in the six months it would take to sort out his visa. Two people specifically recommended contacting PFLAG here in Portland, which is where I come in. Kathy sent an email to PFLAG Portland; I answer the emails for the Portland PFLAG chapter. Kathy and I had a Zoom call the same day she emailed, and it was clear she had found the support she and Tim needed.\n\nTwo weeks after her initial email to Portland PFLAG, Kathy and Tim flew to Portland. They arrived January 29. They stayed with my wife and I; Tim is going to remain with us for the duration of his visa process. I wrote You’ve Got a Friend in part to elicit local support for Tim. Several people have stepped forward very helpfully. The result? Before Kathy left a week later Tim’s paperwork for legal name/gender change was submitted, he was enrolled in the Oregon Health Plan, he had applied for about a dozen jobs, and he had a doctor’s appointment at Outside In’s Trans Clinic to hopefully receive his hormone prescription. Whew!\n\nBefore we connected, Kathy had been beyond worried at the idea of Tim on his own in the U.S. for the six months the visa process would take. As we put her on the plane back to the U.K. Kathy said, “I’m not worried about him now – I’ll just miss him is all.”\n\nAs I write this a month later… Tim’s name and gender change are legal, he’s got his new driver’s license (now Oregon – buh bye, California!), he has a bank account in his new legal name, he’s had a job offer, he got all his bloodwork and lab tests done in preparation for getting a hormone prescription in mid-March, he has submitted paperwork to get a new passport and birth certificate, and he’s singing with Bridging Voices, our queer youth chorus. And our cat has a new best friend; Tim has taken over cat feeding duties.\n\nIn 1976, at the age of 20, I moved from San Francisco to attend Pacific University in Forest Grove. Did I move back to San Francisco after graduation in 1978? No. I moved into Portland. Even then, the open-armed ethos of this city captured my heart. Portland has exceeded my expectations, fast-tracking Tim into his new life without question, with nothing but loving support coming his way. Way to go, Portland! (As I said in my previous piece, Kathy and Tim are pseudonyms. Everything else – totally true!)\n\nThis story is about a young person named Joanna, born in southern California 18 years ago. Joanna grew up in a Christian family, a family that belonged to a church so conservative as to border on cult-like. All friends of the family, and of their children, had to be part of the same church. Any family members who rejected the church were in turn rejected by Joanna’s parents, who viewed them as evil influences, even if they had a religious practice of their own.\n\nA most unfortunate family for any child to grow up in, particularly if they aren’t straight, or cisgender. At 14, Joanna came out as a lesbian. Coming out resulted in two rounds of conversion therapy. (In California, it isn’t legal to subject minors to conversion therapy; the church had to call it Bible therapy instead.) Fortunately, Joanna survived both ordeals, thanks to secret online support. It’s quite possible Joanna would have committed suicide without such on-line support; one ‘minister’ said to Joanna, “You’d be better off dead; you’d come back as a better person.”\n\nUnbeknownst to mom and dad, Joanna developed a wonderful friendship on-line with James, a young transguy in England, also in his mid-teens at the time. This friendship was a lifesaver for Joanna on multiple levels. It provided hope there was life beyond this constricted family and church. It provided a forum for discussing identity, leading to Joanna’s eventual conclusion that ‘lesbian’ wasn’t really it, that ‘transguy’ was a truer fit. And ultimately it provided a new family.\n\nJoanna chose the name Timothy, though his parents never knew this. Tim worked at a local coffee shop. He surreptitiously saved his tip money, adding to it money given to him for birthdays and the like; over a two-year period, he saved enough money to make his way over to England.\n\nBy this time, James and Tim had been on-line friends for four years. James’ mom and dad (Kathy and Frank) were both incensed by Tim’s birth parents. Kathy said indignantly, “They had one job!” Kathy, Frank, and James frequently went for hikes in the woods; they would take a phone with them and FaceTime with Tim so he would be hiking with them. All were so happy when he finally was able to make his way to join them. Tim fit right in with his new family unit, and began the enrollment process at a local college.\n\nAt this point, Tim discovered that his visa was the wrong type to stay in the UK as a student; he had acquired a visa that permitted a six-month stay. His visa was going to expire January 31, 2023. The only way he could fix it was from the U.S. side of the pond. Don’t ask me why – he can’t begin the visa process until April, and he can’t return to the U.K. until about a month before school starts in September.\n\nKathy was beside herself with worry. She couldn’t leave the rest of her family for six months. She had no idea where was the best place for Tim to land to navigate the bureaucratic process. (The only input Tim could give – “anywhere but California.”) Kathy sent emails all over the U.S., finding as many LGBT-focused organizations as she could. She got no helpful responses.\n\nAnd this is where I enter the picture, feeling like I’ve come into the middle of Chapter 10. Kathy sent an email to the Portland PFLAG chapter; I answer the emails for Portland PFLAG. The bottom line – Kathy and Tim will be landing at PDX on January 29, and Kathy returns to the U.K. the following Sunday. Tim will be planted here in Portland until sometime in August. We have some support systems already in place. If you’d like to be part of Team Tim in some way, let me know: reidpdx@gmail.com. And BTW, a holdover from having been a therapist – Kathy, Frank, James, and Tim aren’t their real names. Nor was Tim given the name Joanna at birth. The rest of the story? Totally true.\n\nSeptember 13, 1917. My mother’s birthday. When I was a child, my mom told me that she’d been born on Friday the 13th. It never occurred to me to doubt this, much less go to the pre-internet trouble of fact-checking this tidbit of information. So I don’t remember what prompted me to look it up when such things became simple. I DO remember teasing my mother that her mom probably told her she acted like she’d been born on Friday the 13th. In fact – she was born on a Thursday.\n\nMy mother was a Rosie the Riveter in WWII. She welded ship bottoms in the Oakland shipyard, justifiably proud of her job — only the best were allowed to weld the bottom of a ship. She had lots of stories to tell of that era, bringing alive World War II for those of us born into a subsequent generation, if we cared to listen.\n\nFamily always came first with my mother. In the early 1990s, listening to Pat Buchanan give a Republican National Convention keynote speech waxing eloquently about the homosexual agenda and family values, my mom was horrified to realize how far to the right her Republican party had drifted on social issues. She had been a fiscal Republican, blaming the problems of the country on Roosevelt and the New Deal. She voted for Bill Clinton in 1992, and never voted Republican again. My jaw just about hit the floor when she told me she had switched her party affiliation. She didn’t have to say a word to me about this huge change in her world view; in telling me of her vote, she was also telling me how much my safety and well-being mattered to her. She was living her love for her family.\n\nMy mother died 19 years ago. Nineteen years ago today. A couple of years ago, I realized I’d passed into a new stage of grief about my mother’s death. Prior to that time, the date January 22 did not approach without my being aware of its imminence. This new grief stage is different – the date doesn’t pass without acknowledgment, but it does approach without my circling it in red in my mind. I realized the date this morning as I sat in church, the perfect place to toss a prayer of thanks heavenward for giving me Elizabeth Vanderburgh as my mother.\n\nFour years ago, I started a tradition for myself. I no longer celebrate Thanksgiving in a traditional way; I don’t feel thankful that my ancestors participated in a genocide, colonizing the continent in the process. I have rebranded this day as an opportunity to reflect on Thankfulness.\n\nCentral to my thankfulness… I am blessed to have a loving partner in life. So thankful to have loving family. Blood relatives coming to hear my chorus in a few weeks. Family of choice to share a Thankfulness meal with a few hours from now. Thankful for the pecan and pumpkin pies that are making our house smell so good! Thankful we have a house…\n\nReflecting back on the past year, one milestone of thankfulness immediately comes to mind. March 18 – I came home from the hospital with a new right knee. Though still hobbling a bit when I walk, still needing physical therapy, still taking pain meds at night, yada yada… nevertheless I now walk without the pain that hampered me for several years. So thankful for the technology and medical expertise that made this possible!\n\nFor the first time in my life as a GALA choral singer, spanning 36 years, I took a complete leave of absence from chorus this past spring, missing not just rehearsals but the March concert itself. Back from leave for the Pride concert, I had the joyous experience of hearing our audience cheer as our new director Braeden Ayres was introduced, watching his first PGMC concert! Braeden then spent the summer programming this season, passionate about his avocation, about his new chorus, about his new city. In two weeks, we will perform three shows a sold-out holiday concert. I am thankful to be a part of this wonderful chorus!\n\nI am beyond thankful for the three years I had with Kiko, inherited from my sister Susan and her wife Rita after they both died in the summer of 2019. A formerly-feral cat, Kiko allowed me to be her person during her last three years, happily purring on my heart every time I sat down within range. She died September 21, purring on my chest as the visiting vet sent her on from this life.\n\nA friend of mine used to sing in a local chorus, an organization some sixty years old. I say ‘used to’ as this chorus may or may not exist in the future. There was no mask or vaccination requirement made of the singers, and within weeks of their first rehearsal in August, 17 members came down with Covid. The rest of their season is cancelled.\n\nI am thankful to sing in a chorus with a strict vaccination/booster policy. We rehearse largely unmasked, over 120 voices strong. While a few members (4 or 5) have quarantined with Covid in the year since our return to live rehearsals, the chorus has largely been unaffected. Those members who contracted the disease all eventually returned. Covid is here to stay, sure and certain – and so is the chorus.\n\nIn recent years, with violence against LGBT+ folks on the rise, I have wondered if there might not be a watershed moment of some kind, turning the tide as happened with the 1969 raid on the Stonewall Inn. The recent shootings at Club Q in Colorado Springs may prove to be such a moment, this time with Richard Fierro at the hero’s center, rather than Sylvia Rivera, Marsha P. Johnson, Stormé DeLarverie, and a crowd behind them – all who fought back at the Stonewall Inn that June night over 50 years ago.\n\nCreation of community was the tide’s turning after Stonewall; we shall see how the tides turn after the Club Q shootings. I am thankful for the loving resilience of our community, though always sad at the need for the resilience. Regardless the circumstances necessitating resilience, whether AIDS, Covid, or violent attack, we come through. We are there for each other, and I am so blessed to call this community home. Thankful."
