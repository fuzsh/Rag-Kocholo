These works are not only important for the LGBTQ community but also for society as a whole. They provide a platform for marginalized voices to be heard, challenge stereotypes, and foster empathy and understanding.\n\nOne of the most significant contributions of LGBTQ literature is its ability to provide representation and visibility to individuals who have historically been marginalized and underrepresented in mainstream media. By sharing their stories, LGBTQ authors help to normalize and humanize their experiences, making it easier for readers to empathize with and understand the challenges they face.\n\nMoreover, LGBTQ literature often addresses important social and political issues, such as discrimination, prejudice, and the fight for equality. These works can serve as powerful tools for advocacy and activism, helping to raise awareness and promote social change.\n\nThe 2024 Goodreads Pride Reading List\n\nBlack Gay Author James Baldwin: 100th Birthday More Than Half of 2023's Most Challenged Books Have LGBTQ Themes\n\nAmerican Library Association's Queer President: How to Fight Book Bans Nation's Oldest LGBTQ Bookstore Is Ready for 50 More Years\n\nThese are the Books Your Favorite Celebs Love Federal Judge Blocks Arkansas Law Targeting Books and Librarians\n\nTrans Woman, Bookstore, Teacher Sue Over Law Banning Drag Reading Events LGBTQ Writers Create Ultimate Pride Reading List Out100 2022: LGBTQ Literary and Publishing Stars Book List: Amazing LGBTQ Childrens Books\n\nQueer Book Sagas to Lose Yourself In\n\nLGBTQ Book Bans are Harming Children, Authors Warn: Echoes of Nazi Book Burnings\n\n4 in 10 Books Banned in 2022 Are LGBTQ-Related\n\nIn addition to its social and political significance, LGBTQ literature also has immense cultural value. It enriches our literary landscape by offering diverse perspectives and narratives that challenge traditional norms and conventions. This diversity not only makes our literature more inclusive but also more interesting and thought-provoking.\n\nLGBTQ literature has a profound impact on individuals who identify as LGBTQ. For many, reading about characters and experiences that reflect their own can be incredibly validating and empowering. It can help them to feel seen and understood, and to realize that they are not alone.\n\nLGBTQ literature, books, and authors are essential for promoting diversity, understanding, and empathy. They provide representation and visibility to marginalized voices, address important social and political issues, enrich our cultural landscape, and empower individuals who identify as LGBTQ. As such, they deserve to be celebrated and supported.\n\nNew Book Documents Evolution of Queer Womens Spaces\n\nNew Wave of Bills Targeting Libraries is a Threat to Democracy\n\nFlorida School Districts Removed 300 Books Last School Year\n\nMore Than Half of 2023's Most Challenged Books Have LGBTQ Themes\n\nRed, White and Royal Blue: Film vs. the Book\n\nTeacher Fired for Reading Gender-Inclusive Book to Students LGBTQ Authors Hit Back as US School Book Bans Pick Up\n\nHere's the First Look at DC Comics' 2023 Pride Anthology\n\nTexas Judge Orders LGBTQ Books Returned to Public Libraries\n\nQueer and Feminist Books Coming Out Winter 2023\n\nTrans Books By Trans Authors in 2023\n\nNew Book by NPR's Ari Shapiro\n\nBest Queer Books of 2022\n\nLGBTQ Books Banned In Schools in 2022\n\nFeatured LGBTQ Titles\n\nPapa's Coming Home by Chasten Buttigieg\n\nBlood, Sweat and Suspenders by Andrea Orme\n\nQueer as Folklore by Sacha Coward\n\nMy Guncle and Me by Jonathan Merritt\n\nThe Queer Parent by Lotte Jeffs and Stu Oakley\n\nBirdbone by Ash Shirvington\n\nA Place of Our Own: Six Spaces That Shaped Queer Womens Culture by June Thomas\n\nOut in the World: Gay Guide to Travelling with Pride by Stefan Arestis and Sebastien Chaneac\n\nFinding My Rainbow: Journey of Courage, Acceptance, and Pride by Josh Coleman\n\nGay Science: The Totally Scientific Examination of LGBTQ Culture, Myths, and Stereotypes by Rob Anderson\n\nAnother Word for Love: A Memoir by Carvell Wallace\n\nHere We Go Again by Alison Cochrun\n\nWhen We Were Silent by Fiona McPhillips\n\nHollywood Pride by Alonso Duralde\n\nAffirmations for Queer People by Jess Vosseteig\n\nThe No-Girlfriend Rule by Christen Randall\n\nFeel It All by Casey Tanner\n\nPeople Collide by Isle McElroy\n\nI Am Enough: A Gay Guy's Truths by James A Fink\n\nDevin's Dreams by DC Wilkinson\n\nWhat A Girl Wants: A (True) Story Of Sexuality And Self-Discovery by Roxy Bourdillon\n\nThe Pairing by Casey McQuiston\n\nLow Hanging Fruit by Randy Rainbow\n\nJust Happy To Be Here by Naomi Kanakia\n\nDear Wendy by Ann Zhao\n\nHomebody by Theo Parish\n\nLoveless by Alice Oseman\n\nCupids Revenge by Wibke Brueggemann\n\nDont Want You Like A Best Friend by Emma R.

The American Library Association, a nonprofit organization that tracks efforts to ban books nationwide, released a list detailing the 10 most challenged titles of 2023  seven of which deal with LGBTQ themes, according to the group.\n\nMaia Kobabes Gender Queer, a graphic memoir that chronicles the author coming out as nonbinary, topped the list for the third year in a row. The other LGBTQ-themed titles on the list include George M. Johnsons All Boys Arent Blue, Juno Dawsons This Book Is Gay and Mike Curatos Flamer.\n\nIn recent years, school districts and state legislatures across the US have been roiled by fierce debates over what reading materials are appropriate for kids and teenagers. The moves to restrict or withdraw books have been driven in part by conservative activist groups such as Moms for Liberty as well as Republican elected officials.\n\nMeanwhile, the American conservative movement has increasingly coalesced around initiatives to curb lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer visibility, including Floridas restrictions on LGBTQ education in public schools and wider efforts to prevent trans athletes from competing in school sports.\n\nIn looking at the titles of the most challenged books from last year, its obvious that the pressure groups are targeting books about LGBTQ people and people of color, American Library Association President Emily Drabinski said in a statement accompanying the list.\n\nWe are fighting for the freedom to choose what you want to read, Drabinski added. Shining a light on the harmful workings of these pressure groups is one of the actions we must take to protect our right to read.\n\nThe American Library Association announced that the number of books challenged in libraries across the US in 2023 spiked 65% over the previous year, reaching the highest level ever documented by the nonprofit organization.\n\nIn a report released March 2024, the association said that 4,240 individual book titles were targeted for removal from schools and public libraries  a dramatic uptick from the previous high of 2,571 in 2022.\n\nThe most challenged books of 2023  the top five of which all had LGBTQ themes  also included Stephen Chboskys The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Toni Morrisons The Bluest Eye, Ellen Hopkins Tricks, Jesse Andrews Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, Erika Moen and Matthew Nolans Lets Talk About It, and Patricia McCormicks Sold. Three of the titles on the list were not specifically flagged for LGBTQ themes. The Bluest Eye, widely considered a literary classic, drew complaints because it features depictions of rape and incest, according to the library association. It was also claimed to be sexually explicit and flagged for EDI content, an acronym that refers to equity, diversity and inclusion.\n\nThe list of challenged books was released just as National Library Week began, an observance co-sponsored by the library association, which was founded in 1876. The library association, which has monitored attempted book bans since 1990, compiles data on challenges from two sources: reports from library professionals and news stories. The association said the 2023 data represents only a snapshot of book censorship, partly because many attempts to challenge books are not formally flagged or covered by the news media.\n\nEach challenge, each demand to censor these books is an attack on our freedom to read, our right to live the life we choose, and an attack on libraries as community institutions that reflect the rich diversity of our nation, said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the associations Office for Intellectual Freedom. When we tolerate censorship, she added, we risk losing all of this.\n\n[Source: Daniel Arkin, NBC News, April 2024]\n\nThe 2024 Goodreads Pride Reading List\n\nBlack Gay Author James Baldwin: 100th Birthday\n\nNew Book Documents Evolution of Queer Womens Spaces\n\nMore Than Half of 2023's Most Challenged Books Have LGBTQ Themes\n\nTransgender Man and Former Athlete Opens Up About What It Means to Be A Real Man\n\nThese are the Books Your Favorite Celebs Love\n\nLGBTQ Writers Who Have Won the Pulitzer Prize\n\nLGBTQ Romance Book Recommendations\n\nNew Book for Parents of Newly Out LGBTQ Kids\n\nPride of Our Lives: LGBTQ Book Recommendations\n\nNew Young Adult Novel: Terror and Thrill of Same-Sex Prom Date Advocate Books: Having a Gay Kid Isn't Easy\n\nQueer Friendly Books for Young Adults, Kids, Families\n\nConservative Group Wants to Pass Law to Jail Librarians Who Give LGBTQ Books to Kids Pageboy: Elliot Page Releases Memoir About Transness, Love, and Hollywood\n\nLGBTQ Authors Hit Back as US School Book Bans Pick Up\n\nAlice Oseman is Helping Author a Brighter Future for LGBTQ Youth\n\nGeorgia Teacher Fired for Reading Gender-Inclusive Book Teacher Katie Rinderle testified that she believes there is nothing inappropriate or sensitive about My Shadow is Purple\n\nAfter administrators alleged that she violated the districts regulations by reading a book about gender fluidity to her students, a Georgia public school teacher attempted to reverse her dismissal by speaking at a hearing concerning the matter in August 2023.\n\nAfter teaching for a decade, Katie Rinderle got in trouble in March 2023 after reading My Shadow Is Purple, a picture book for children, to her fifth-grade students at Due West Elementary School in Cobb County, in the Atlanta metroplex. She was eventually fired.\n\nGeorgia Teacher Fired for Reading Gender-Inclusive Book to Students\n\nLGBTQ Authors Hit Back as US School Book Bans Pick Up\n\nFlorida School Districts Removed 300 Books Last School Year\n\nTexas Judge Orders LGBTQ Books Be Returned to Public Libraries\n\nLGBTQ Books Banned In Schools in 2022\n\nConservatives are Attacking LGBTQ Books\n\nSchool Bans on LGBTQ Books Escalating Dramatically\n\nFederal Judge Blocks Arkansas Law Targeting Books and Librarians\n\nConservative Group Wants to Pass Law to Jail Librarians Who Give LGBTQ Books to Kids\n\nIn light of a nationwide conservative assault on LGBTQ-themed books and school lessons, this case has gained considerable attention due to its concern with teachers teaching abilities, the control of school systems over teachers, and whether or not some parents should have a say in the public curriculum. This termination is unrelated to education, Rinderles lawyer argued. It exists to create political scapegoats for the elected leadership of this district. Reading a childrens book to children is not against the law.\n\nCobb County officials say Rinderle broke school rules by teaching controversial subjects, and parents complained, leading to Rinderles termination. Cobb County is the second-largest school district in Georgia. Introducing the topic of gender identity and gender fluidity into a class of elementary grade students was inappropriate and violated the school district policies, argued the school districts counsel.\n\nBut Rinderle disagreed. The fact that Rinderle read the book wasnt wrong, she said, because she found it appropriate and not a sensitive topic. She argued that the book conveys a message to students about their many interests and the desire to be free to choose and explore them all.\n\nFollowing Georgia Republican lawmakers ban on divisive concepts in the classroom and creating a bill of rights for parents in 2022, Cobb County adopted a rule prohibiting teaching controversial issues. Divisive concepts law prohibits teachers from espousing personal political beliefs. By law, parents have the right to direct the upbringing and the moral or religious training of his or her minor child. According to Georgia law, teachers cannot be fired without cause. Three retired school principals will review Rinderles case and recommend whether to fire or retain her, but ultimately the school board will decide the educators fate.\n\n[Source: Christopher Wiggins, Advocate, August 2023]\n\nChasten Buttigieg Releases a Childrens Book and Its Super Adorable\n\nGrowing Demand for LGBTQ Fiction is Transforming the Book World\n\nLGBTQ Romance Book Recommendations\n\nNew Book Documents Evolution of Queer Womens Spaces\n\nRainbow Books: Religious and Queer\n\nLGBTQ Books Banned In Schools in 2022\n\nCalvin: Children's Book Shows How a Community Can Embrace a Trans Child's Identity\n\nChasten Buttigieg: New Book is Frank Discussion of Growing Up Gay\n\nAdvocate: LGBTQ Books You Absolutely Need to Read\n\nInterview With Brandi Carlile About Her New Book\n\nNovels Featuring Endearingly Messy Queer Characters Wikipedia: Lesbian Writers\n\nJenny Boylan: Best Selling Trans Author\n\nMolly Knox Ostertag Talks Queer YA Visibility in The Girl From the Sea\n\nPFLAG: Coming Out Books\n\nFeatured LGBTQ Titles\n\nCleat Cute by Meryl Wilsner\n\nPage Boy by Elliott Page\n\nNobody Needs to Know by Pidgeon Pagonis\n\nFeed It To The Dog by Ash Shirvington\n\nLesbian Love Story: A Memoir in Archives by Amelia Possanza\n\nLet's Talk About Love by Claire Kann\n\nGorgeously Me by Jonathan Van Ness\n\nJoy to the World by Kai Shappley and Lisa Bunker\n\nThen Comes Marriage by Roberta Kaplan and Lisa Dickey\n\nGirls Like Girls by Hayley Kiyoko\n\nMoby Dyke by Krista Burton\n\nHe/She/They by Schuyler Bailar\n\nKings of B'More by R.

He was publicly recognized in 1992 when National Public Radio broadcast his essay \"Santaland Diaries. He published his first collection of essays and short stories, Barrel Fever, in 1994. His next book, Naked (1997), became his first of a series of New York Times Bestsellers, and his 2000 collection Me Talk Pretty One Day won the Thurber Prize for American Humor.\n\nDavid Sedaris' list of published works include: \"Barrel Fever\" (1994), \"Naked\" (1997), \"Holidays on Ice\" (1997), \"Me Talk Pretty One Day\" (2000), \"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim\" (2004), \"Children Playing Before a Statue of Hercules\" (2005), \"When You Are Engulfed in Flames\" (2008), \"Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk: A Modest Bestiary\" (2010), \"Let's Explore Diabetes with Owls\" (2013), \"Theft by Finding: Diaries\" (2017), \"Calypso\" (2018), \"Happy-Go-Lucky\" (2022).\n\nDavid Sedaris: Biographical Notes\n\nUSA Today Interview with David Sedaris\n\nDavid Sedaris: Having a Hoot Getting Dressed\n\nThe Funny Life of David Sedaris\n\nDavid Sedaris on Jimmy Kimmel Show\n\nEssay: Walking and Talking With My Friend Dawn By David Sedaris\n\nMuch of Sedaris's humor is ostensibly autobiographical and self-deprecating and often concerns his family life, his middle-class upbringing in the suburbs of Raleigh, North Carolina, his Greek heritage, homosexuality, jobs, education, drug use, and obsessive behaviors, as well as his life in France, London, New York, and the South Downs in England. He is the brother and writing collaborator of actress Amy Sedaris. In 2019, Sedaris was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters.\n\nSedaris was born in Johnson City, New York. The Sedaris family moved when David was young, and he grew up in a suburban area of Raleigh, the second oldest child of six. Among his siblings, many people would recognize Amy from film and TV fame and Paul (\"the Rooster\") whom he mentions in his stand-up comedy routines.\n\nSedaris briefly attended Western Carolina University before transferring to, and dropping out of, Kent State University in 1977. In his teens and twenties, David dabbled in visual and performance art. He describes his lack of success in several of his essays. He moved to Chicago in 1983, and graduated from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1987.\n\nAs of 2019, Sedaris lives in Rackham, West Sussex, England with his longtime partner, painter and set designer Hugh Hamrick. Sedaris mentions Hamrick in a number of his stories, and describes the two of them as the \"sort of couple who wouldn't get married.\"\n\nChasten Buttigieg Releases a Childrens Book and Its Super Adorable\n\nNew Book Documents Evolution of Queer Womens Spaces\n\nMore Than Half of 2023's Most Challenged Books Have LGBTQ Themes\n\nConservative Group Wants to Pass Law to Jail Librarians Who Give LGBTQ Books to Kids\n\nLGBTQ Book Bans are Harming Children, Authors Warn: Echoes of Nazi Book Burnings\n\n4 in 10 Books Banned in 2022 Are LGBTQ-Related\n\nPageboy: Elliot Page Releases Memoir About Transness, Love, and Hollywood\n\nLGBTQ Authors Hit Back as US School Book Bans Pick Up\n\nAlice Oseman is Helping Author a Brighter Future for LGBTQ Youth LGBTQ Books That Are Banned In Schools in 2022\n\nCalvin: Children's Book Shows How a Community Can Embrace a Trans Child's Identity\n\nChasten Buttigieg: New Book is Frank Discussion of Growing Up Gay\n\nAdvocate: LGBTQ Books You Absolutely Need to Read\n\nFeatured LGBTQ Titles\n\nThis Book Is So Gay: Motivational Coloring Book for Grown Ups with Affirmations, Stress Relief & Relaxation by Natalie & CoCo\n\nStars Collide by Rachel Lacey\n\nLove and Other Disasters by Anita Kelly\n\nNone of the Above: Reflections On Life Beyond The Binary by Travis Alabanza\n\nTake Your Own Advice by Jeffrey Marsh\n\nLove and Other Disasters by Anita Kelly\n\nOnly Mostly Devastated by Sophie Gonzales\n\nMiss Meteor by Tehlor Kay Mejia and Anna-Marie McLemore\n\nWho Could Love You, Astor Price? by Amy Jane Lehan\n\nThe Best Strangers in the World by Ari Shapiro\n\nPlanning Perfect by Haley Neil\n\nWhat's The T? by Juno Dawson\n\nThe Pink Marine: One Boys Journey Through Bootcamp to Manhood by Greg Cope White\n\nFor the Love of April French by Penny Aimes\n\nThe Mirror Season by Anna-Marie McLemore\n\nHot Dog Girl by Jennifer Dugan\n\nGlassworks by Olivia Wolfgang-Smith\n\nDhalgren by Samuel R.

Be astonished. Tell about it.\"\n\n-Mary Oliver\n\nMary Jane Oliver (1935-2019) was an lesbian American poet who won the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize. Her work is inspired by nature, rather than the human world, stemming from her lifelong passion for solitary walks in the wild. It is characterized by a sincere wonderment at the impact of natural imagery, conveyed in unadorned language. In 2007, she was declared to be the country's best-selling poet.\n\nMary Oliver was born to Edward William and Helen M. (Vlasak) Oliver in Maple Heights, Ohio, a semi-rural suburb of Cleveland. Her father was a social studies teacher and an athletics coach in the Cleveland public schools. As a child, she spent a great deal of time outside where she enjoyed going on walks or reading. Oliver described her family as dysfunctional, adding that though her childhood was very hard, writing helped her create her own world. Oliver revealed that she had been sexually abused as a child and had experienced recurring nightmares.\n\nMary Oliver: Biographical Notes\n\nPoetry Foundation: Mary Oliver\n\nAcademy of American Poets: Mary Oliver\n\nBooks and Bio: Mary Oliver\n\nMary Oliver: Collection of Her Poems\n\nMary Oliver: Lesbian Poet, Mystic of Nature\n\nOliver began writing poetry at the age of 14. She graduated from the local high school in Maple Heights. In the summer of 1951 at the age of 15 she attended the National Music Camp at Interlochen, Michigan, now known as Interlochen Arts Camp, where she was in the percussion section of the National High School Orchestra. At 17 she visited the home of the late Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Edna St. Vincent Millay, in Austerlitz, New York, where she then formed a friendship with the late poet's sister Norma. Oliver and Norma spent the next six to seven years at the estate organizing Edna St. Vincent Millay's papers.\n\nOliver studied at The Ohio State University and Vassar College in the mid-1950s, but did not receive a degree at either college.\n\nOn a visit to Austerlitz in the late 1950s, Oliver met photographer Molly Malone Cook, who would become her partner for over forty years. In Our World, a book of Cook's photos and journal excerpts Oliver compiled after Cook's death, Oliver writes, \"I took one look at Cook and fell, hook and tumble.\" Cook was Oliver's literary agent. They made their home largely in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where they lived until Cook's death in 2005, and where Oliver continued to live until relocating to Florida.\n\nOliver valued her privacy and gave very few interviews, saying she preferred for her writing to speak for itself. In 2012, Oliver was diagnosed with lung cancer, but was treated and given a \"clean bill of health.\" Oliver died of lymphoma on January 2019, at the age of 83.\n\nThe 2024 Goodreads Pride Reading List\n\nChasten Buttigieg Releases a Childrens Book and Its Super Adorable\n\nA Renaissance of Gay Literature Marks a Turning Point for Publishing\n\nBook List: Amazing LGBTQ Childrens Books\n\n100 Books With Lesbian Characters\n\nInspiring Children's Books With a Positive Message\n\nLesbian Author Marijane Meaker Dies at 95 Best Classic LGBTQ Novels of All Time Out100 2022: LGBTQ Literary and Publishing Stars\n\nLGBTQ Writers Who Have Won the Pulitzer Prize\n\nRanker: Best Gay Authors\n\nBlack LGBTQ Book Recommendations\n\nRainbow Books: Religious and Queer\n\nFeatured LGBTQ Titles\n\nLet's Not Do That Again by Grant Ginder\n\nAristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Sáenz\n\nFriday I'm in Love by Camryn Garrett\n\nWe Deserve Monuments by Jas Hammond\n\nAfter Sappho by Selby Wynn Schwartz\n\nMy First Pride by Aida H Dee\n\nYou Gotta Be You by Brandon Kyle Goodman\n\nJust By Looking at Him by Ryan O'Connell\n\nThe One You Want to Marry by Sophie Santos\n\nWorking Girls by Trixie and Katya\n\nThis Time For Me by Alexandra Billings\n\nThe Sparsholt Affair by Alan Hollinghurst\n\nThe Tensorate Series by Neon Yang\n\nThe Night Watch by Sarah Waters\n\nMy Government Means to Kill Me by Rasheed Newson\n\nThe You Kind of Kind by Nina west\n\nOur Lonesome Nights Together by O.S.

Matt Krause, a \"Texas lawmaker running for attorney general, identified a list of 850 books that he says should be questioned; many of those books are written by women, people of color and LGBTQ authors,\" NPR detailed.\n\nMaia Kobabe's graphic novel memoir \"Gender Queer: A Memoir\" was targeted by Texas State Rep. Jeff Cason. The state's governor, Greg Abbott, \"sent a letter to the state's school board association saying public schools shouldn't have pornographic or obscene material.\" NPR Abbott did not provide any specific examples of content.\n\nBut GOP officials in other states have also increased attacks on books they say are objectionable. In a recent article, The New York Times noted several titles that were yanked from school libraries in various places around the country, including \"All Boys Aren't Blue,\" by gay Black author George M. Johnson and Alison Bechdel's graphic novel \"Fun Home,\" a memoir of her own youth as a lesbian and her relationship with her father, who was closeted. \"Gender Queer\" was also singled out by Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina, who called the memoir \"pornographic.\"\n\nThe book-banning push is \"part of a trend of conservative-led fights across the country over how schools can teach about issues of race, particularly systemic racism, as well as sex and gender, blurring the already-faint line between local and national politics,\" the Houston Chronicle said.\n\nThough critical race theory is taught in colleges, and not in elementary, middle, or high schools, the term has been appropriated to indicate books in general that discuss issues of race in America, news reports said.\n\nBooks by writers of color have come under attack, with reports citing two Toni Morrison novels. \"The Bluest Eye\" and \"Beloved\" (the latter won the Pulitzer Prize) have faced challenges. The campaign of Glenn Youngkin, the Virginia gubernatorial candidate who defeated incumbent Terry McAuliffe, pointed at \"Beloved\" as an example of what should not be in schools. Youngkin made education a central plank of his campaign, and his campaign used a decade-old video in which a conservative activist attacks \"Beloved\" in its advertising.\n\nTwo members of a Virginia school board in Spotsylvania County called for books to be not only banned, but burned, NPR noted, quoting representative Rabih Abuismail as saying, \"I think we should throw those books in a fire.\" Fellow school board member Kirk Twigg \"said he wants to 'see the books before we burn them so we can identify within our community that we are eradicating this bad stuff,'\" NPR added.\n\nHowever, though critical race theory is loudly decried by Republican officials, it is books with LGBTQ content that the GOP is more focused on eradicating, at least in Texas, the Houston Chronicle said.\n\n[Source: Kilian Melloy, Edge Media Network, Nov 2021]\n\nMore Than Half of 2023's Most Challenged Books Have LGBTQ Themes\n\nLGBTQ Authors Hit Back as US School Book Bans Pick Up\n\nLGBTQ Books That Are Banned In Schools in 2022\n\nSchool Bans on LGBTQ Books Escalating Dramatically\n\nSheriff Urges Library to Yank Books with LGBTQ Content\n\nFilthy and Obscene: GOP Attacks Books About LGBTQ Kids and Racism\n\nMississippi Mayor Withholds $110k in Library Funds Over LGBTQ Books\n\nTwo Students Sue School District for Banning LGBTQ Books\n\nFlorida Senate Bill Could Ban Books With LGBTQ Characters\n\nSouth Carolina Governor Calls for LGBTQ Book to be Banned in Schools\n\nTennessee GOP Wants to Ban Books that Promote LGBTQ Lifestyle\n\nMore Republican Leaders Try to Ban Books on LGBTQ Issues\n\nSchool Board Bans Books on LGBTQ Issues and More\n\nTennessee Bill Would Ban Books that Mention LGBTQ People\n\nFeatured LGBTQ Titles\n\nThe One You Want to Marry (And Other Identities I've Had) by Sophie Santos, Joey Soloway\n\nThis Time for Me by Alexandra Billings\n\nSomething Fabulous by Alexis Hall\n\nNo Way Renee by Renee Richards\n\nAll the Young Men by Ruth Coker Burks\n\nRead Between the Lines by Rachel Lacey\n\nThe Weddings by Alexander Chee\n\nSmall Town Pride by Phil Stamper\n\nBloody Summer by Carmen Maria Machado\n\nTen Steps to Nanette by Hannah Gadsby\n\nMe by Elton John\n\nMy Shadow is Pink by Scott Stuart\n\nShe|He|They|Me: Interactive Guide to the Gender Binary by Robyn Ryle\n\nMagical Boy by The Kao\n\nWelcome to St. Hell by Lewis Hancox\n\nHeartstopper by Alice Oseman\n\nLoveless by Alice Oseman\n\nI Wish You All the Best by Mason Deaver\n\nThe Music of What Happens by Bill Konigsberg\n\nThings We Couldn't Say by Jay Coles\n\nAll About Love by Bell Hooks\n\nRainbow Books: Religious and Queer\n\nMorris Micklewhite and the Tangerine Dress\n\nRowan Ellis: Interview with LGBTQ Book Authors\n\nFlorida School Districts Removed 300 Books Last School Year\n\nTrans Woman, Bookstore, Teacher Sue Over Montana Law Banning Drag Reading Events\n\nLGBTQ Nation: Top Ten Books on Trans Issues\n\nInspiring Children's Books With a Positive Message\n\nLesbian Author Marijane Meaker Dies at 95 Best Classic LGBTQ Novels of All Time Out100 2022: LGBTQ Literary and Publishing Stars\n\nLGBTQ Writers Who Have Won the Pulitzer Prize\n\nRanker: Best Gay Authors\n\nBlack LGBTQ Book Recommendations\n\nLGBTQ Reading List: General Topics\n\nOn Being Different: What it Means to Be a Homosexual by Merle Miller\n\nMom, Dad, Im Gay: How Families Negotiate Coming Out by Ritch C.

Such activities feature storytellers using the art of drag to read books to kids. It is a very kid-friendly event during which a drag queen generally reads 3-4 children's books, sings children's songs, and leads children in a craft activity such as making crowns, wands, or paper bag puppets, or sometimes other activities like face painting or dress-up time.\n\nThrough a fun literary experience, drag story times center on learning and play, encouraging kids to celebrate gender diversity and all kinds of difference, while building confidence in expressing themselves. In spaces like this, kids are able to see people who defy rigid gender restrictions and imagine a world where everyone can be their authentic selves.\n\nChildren learn, grow, and mature best when they are playing and having fun. In pre-school and kindergarten, learning looks like play. Kids are the most engaged when they are playing games, singing songs, and expressing themselves in outrageous ways. They enjoy interactive and participatory exercises and they love to be entertained. They are amused by flamboyant, festive, fanciful personalities. They love clowns, jesters, magicians, dancers, musicians, superheroes, princesses ... and drag queens.\n\nWhat is a drag queen?\n\nDrag is an artistic way of expressing yourself and showing the world who you are or who you want to be. Drag queens are generally male entertainers who often express their feminine sides or different aspects of their gender or personality through dressing up, performing in shows, marching in parades, and volunteering in their communities.\n\nDo drag story time events promote an agenda?\n\nMost librarians and their drag queen guests would say that their only agenda is that people of all ages should be free to express themselves however they want, free from the constraints of prescribed gender roles. Storytime activities teach children that there are many ways to express themselves and their gender, and they are all OK. Drag is an art form that is rooted in diverse LGBTQ communities, and they support equality, justice, and respect for all people. Given that LGBTQ people are present in every community, they believe that children deserve to be exposed to these aspects of our shared history and culture, in age appropriate ways. If there is an agenda, it could be described simply: To encourage diversity, inclusion, acceptance, and respect. To promote empathy, creativity, imagination, and self-expression. To prevent bullying, bigotry, prejudice, homophobia, and transphobia.\n\nDrag Queen Storytime\n\nDrag Queen Librarians\n\nPhiladelphia Sets World Record for Drag Queen Story Hour Attendance Case of the Missing Carrot Cake: Read by Wanda Sykes\n\nRead Aloud: Thelma the Unicorn\n\nHarry the Dirty Dog: Read by Betty White\n\nDrag Queen Story Hour: Spokane Public Library Joins National Trend\n\nGreen Eggs and Ham: Read by Michael Douglas, Adam Devine, Keegan-Michael Key, Ilana Glazer, Eddie Izzard\n\nThe Empty Pot: Read by Rami Malek\n\nDrag Queens at Local Bookstore\n\nThe Tooth: Read by Annette Benning\n\nQuackenstein Hatches a Family: Read by Kristen Bell\n\nDrag Queens Reading To Kids in Libraries\n\nHula-Hoopin' Queen: Read by Oprah Winfrey\n\nArnie the Doughnut: Read by Chris O'Dowd\n\nDrag Queen Story Hour Offers a Different Kind of Page-Turner\n\nDrag Queen Story Hour: With Pickle the Drag Queen\n\nTo Be A Drum: Read by James Earl Jones\n\nDrag Queens Reading To Kids in Libraries\n\nNew Book Teaches Kids How to Swish, Snap, and Twirl Like a Drag Queen\n\nDrag Story Hour\n\nFeatured LGBTQ Titles\n\nHappy Go Lucky by David Sedaris\n\nMemorial by Bryan Washington\n\nOne Last Stop by Casey McQuiston\n\nQueer Anxieties: Of Young Adult Literature and Culture by Derritt Mason\n\nParable of the Sower by Octavia Butler\n\nDon't Fucking Panic by Kelsey Darraugh\n\nWhat Does a Princess Really Look Like? by Mark Loewen\n\nThe New Queer Conscience by Adam Eli\n\nIf Beale Street Could Talk by James Baldwin\n\nRaising Them: Our Adventure in Gender Creative Parenting by Kyl Myers\n\nRed, White and Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston\n\nI Can't Date Jesus by Michael Arceneaux\n\n100 Best Gay and Lesbian Novels\n\nWikipedia: Gay Writers\n\nSome Books We Can Take Pride In\n\nNovels Featuring Endearingly Messy Queer Characters\n\n100 Books With Lesbian Characters\n\nNew Book: Ultimate Guide for Gay Dads\n\nBook List: Amazing LGBTQ Childrens Books\n\nLibrary Refuses to Move Gay Kids Book After \"Family\" Group Complains\n\nTimeline: 20 Years of LGBTQ Literature\n\nBooks for Parents\n\nThis Is a Book for Parents of Gay Kids: A Question & Answer Guide to Everyday Lifeby Dannielle Owens-Reid and Kristin Russo\n\nIs It a Choice?: Answers to 300 of the Most Frequently Asked Questions About Gay and Lesbian People by Eric Marcus\n\nAlways My Child: A Parents Guide to Understanding Your Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgendered, or Questioning Son or Daughter by Kevin Jennings\n\nOut of the Closet, Into Our Hearts by Laura Siegel and Nancy Lamkin Olson\n\nUnconditional: Guide to Loving and Supporting Your LGBTQ Child by Telaina Eriksen\n\nBeyond Acceptance: Parents of Lesbians and Gays Talk About Their Experiences\n\nCarolyn Welch Griffen\n\nNow That You Know: A Parents Guide to Understanding Their Gay and Lesbian Children by Betty Fairchild and Nancy Hayward\n\nWhen Your Child is Gay by Davidson and Tobkes\n\nComing Out, Coming Home: Helping Families Adjust to a Lesbian or Gay Child by Michael C.

DC Universe's new Superman and the son of Clark Kent, is coming out as bisexual in the new edition of the Superman comic book series.\n\n\"I've always said everyone needs heroes and everyone deserves to see themselves in their heroes and Im very grateful DC and Warner Bros. share this idea,\" Taylor said in a statement to DC. \"Superman's symbol has always stood for hope, for truth and for justice. Today, that symbol represents something more. Today, more people can see themselves in the most powerful superhero in comics.\"\n\n\"We couldnt be prouder to tell this important story from Tom Taylor and John Timms,\" DC Publisher and Chief Creative Officer Jim Lee said. \"We talk a lot about the power of the DC Multiverse in our storytelling and this is another incredible example. We can have Jon Kent exploring his identity in the comics as well as Jon Kent learning the secrets of his family on TV on Superman & Lois. They coexist in their own worlds and times, and our fans get to enjoy both simultaneously.\"\n\nJon Kent was created by Dan Jurgens and debuted in 2015's Convergence. The character is the son of Clark Kent and Lois Lane, and in the DC Rebirth era, he took up the mantle of Superboy. Several years later, he was aged up and became a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, and in April 2021, it was announced that he'd take over as Superman with Superman: Son of Kal-El.\n\n[Source: Jon Arvedon, Comic Book Resources, Oct 2021]\n\nLGBTQ Comic Books\n\nClassic Queer Indie Comics Every Gay Geek Should Read Marvel Voices: Pride Series Book Riot: List of LGBTQ Comics and Graphic Novels\n\nPaste: LGBTQ Inclusive Comics\n\nSpark Unmasked\n\nSuperhero Diversity in Comic Books\n\nQueer Representations in Anime\n\nAutostraddle: Best LGBTQ Graphic Novels\n\nRanker: List of Queer Comic Books\n\nGay Times: Best LGBTQ Comics\n\nAnime Planet: Best LGBTQ Themed Manga\n\nComicosity: Indie Comic Books for LGBTQ Fans\n\nList of the Best Queer Comics\n\nComicosity: More Indie Comic Books for LGBTQ Fans\n\nMary Sue: Top Queer Voices in Anime and Manga\n\nLGBTQ Themes in Comics\n\nConservative Group Wants to Pass Law to Jail Librarians Who Give LGBTQ Books to Kids Pageboy: Elliot Page Releases Memoir About Transness, Love, and Hollywood\n\nLGBTQ Authors Hit Back as US School Book Bans Pick Up\n\nAlice Oseman is Helping Author a Brighter Future for LGBTQ Youth LGBTQ Books That Are Banned In Schools in 2022\n\nCalvin: Children's Book Shows How a Community Can Embrace a Trans Child's Identity\n\nChasten Buttigieg: New Book is Frank Discussion of Growing Up Gay\n\nAdvocate: LGBTQ Books You Absolutely Need to Read\n\nLGBTQ Related Topics: Children's Books\n\nDaddy and Me by Jeanne Moutous-Ashe | AIDS\n\nBootsie Barker Bites by Barbara Bottner | Bullying\n\nThe Ant Bully | Bullying\n\nCory Coleman, Grade 2 by Larry Dane Brimner | Bullying\n\nHow to Lose All Your Friends by Nancy Carlson | Bullying\n\nBully by Judith Caseley | Bullying\n\nJake Drake: Bully Buster by Andrew Clements | Bullying\n\nThe Hundred Dresses by Eleanor Estes | Bullying\n\nChrysanthemum by Kevin Henkes | Bullying\n\nGoggles! by Ezra Jack Keats | Bullying\n\nNobody Knew What to Do: A Story about Bullying by Becky Ray McCain | Bullying\n\nThe King of the Playground by Phyllis Reynolds | Bullying\n\nBullies Are a Pain in the Brain by Trevor Romain | Bullying\n\nAshok By Any Other Name by Sandra S.
