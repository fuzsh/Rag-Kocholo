        "text": "I’m so glad to have discovered the magic of Alice Thomas Ellis and once again I have to thank Andrew Male for tweeting about The Clothes in the Wardrobe; in case you have missed it, Andrew also introduced me to Lars Gustafsson’s wonderful novella, A Tiler’s Afternoon.\n\n“I’ve never known such a miserable bride. What’s the matter with you?” quips Margaret’s exasperated mother in the opening pages of the hauntingly bleak and deliciously witty The Clothes in the Wardrobe, the first novella in Alice Thomas Ellis’ The Summer House Trilogy.\n\nRight from the very first page and in the days leading up to her wedding, nineteen-year-old Margaret, our protagonist and narrator, appears increasingly morose and listless. Her impending wedding feels like an unavoidable punishment, particularly since her fiancé is unattractive with no redeeming qualities. For one thing, Syl Monro is a shallow, odious man, old enough to be her father (he is forty), and secondly, Margaret does not love him but passionately detests him instead.\n\nEven the moment of her engagement to Syl is fraught with apathy – it’s not that she wholeheartedly agrees to marry him but rather that she isn’t vociferous in opposing it.\n\nWhat had happened was that Syl had, one evening, flushed with wine, remarked that he thought it would be a good idea if we got married. I had said nothing and he had assumed that we were engaged, telling his mother that night and mine the following morning.\n\nThe feeling of being adrift and bored is intense, and her vague acquiescence to Syl’s proposal is borne out of a misguided notion of the marriage not actually materialising, until it terrifyingly does. Little wonder then, Margaret is wretched filled with a deepening sense of lethargy she can’t quell, the fear and maybe panic simmering under the surface threatening to erupt.\n\nThis deep-rooted ennui and despair seething within her is not just a byproduct of her young age. The stifling atmosphere at home and her mother’s oppressive behaviour overwhelm Margaret, and she has a blurry notion of marriage being a means to escape, but the prospect of being wedded to Syl, Margaret despondently realises, is even worse.\n\nThere are other factors troubling Margaret. Through memories filtered through her mind involving her recent trip to Egypt, we learn of Margaret’s stay with Marie Claire, a friend of her mother’s, but more specifically, Marie Claire’s son, Nour, an exotic but mysterious man with whom Margaret has fallen in love. Margaret knows those feelings are unrequited, they both come from simply different worlds in terms of race and culture, but interestingly the picture painted of Nour through Margaret’s perspective hardly presents a desirable young man but rather someone cruel and self-centred, in many ways unnervingly mirroring some of Syl’s qualities. Margaret acknowledges this as she does the dichotomy of her feelings toward two men likely cut from the same cloth. Nour does have youth and beauty on his side, magnetic qualities that always attract the young and are sorely lacking in Syl. But Nour also exudes a whiff of menace, a facet of his personality that remains unfathomable to Margaret, and the reader gets a sense of something buried deep; a secret that will be revealed later and throw some light on Margaret’s profound feeling of doom.\n\nMeanwhile, as Margaret’s inner turmoil rages, so does her mother’s single-minded insistence on getting her involved in wedding preparations. Drawing up a list of invitees, buying wedding clothes, and other innumerable but essential tasks to be completed seem utterly joyless to Margaret as do her dull and dreary outings with Syl, and this indifference refuses to melt away despite her mother’s continuous nagging.\n\nInto this bleak atmosphere, then, enters the fiery and free-spirited Lili, like a breath of much-needed fresh air, in whom Margaret sees a confidante and possible ally. Margaret’s mother and Lili are best friends, their bond evident through snippets of shared reminisces, although personality-wise the two women could not have been more different. Margaret’s mother is a slave to the strict norms of conventional society where appearances matter, while in stark contrast, Lili is more of a daredevil, irreverent and carefree, not weighed down by the opinions of polite society. In Lili’s company, Margaret feels open and comfortable in a way she never did with her mother. Flamboyant and eccentric, Lili brings a sense of rebellion and a unique, nonconformist worldview that is alluring to Margaret but irritating to her mother. Lili is sharp and perceptive, aware of Margaret’s deep unhappiness, and subtly offers her a different perspective on life specifically with respect to desires and relationships.\n\nAs the wedding day approaches, Margaret grows increasingly distressed and withdrawn, feeling trapped by the expectations of her mother, Syl, and Syl’s mother Mrs Monro. She secretly wishes that Lili dons the role of her redeemer or savior, but is disappointed when Lili does not immediately take her side when she musters up courage on a couple of occasions to air her misgivings about the marriage. But is Lili indifferent as a frustrated Margaret perceives her to be, or does she have something up her sleeve?\n\nThe Clothes in the Wardrobe, then, is a razor-sharp, engrossing tale with its interplay of shadows and light; a novella that is both dark and comic in its exploration of love, marriage, friendship, conformity, and societal expectations seen through the lens of a dysfunctional family and the impending marriage of an unwilling bride. Margaret’s despair is so intense and all-pervading that it lends a bleak, hypnotic quality to her narrative and this is thrown in sharp relief by the oodles of mordant wit that laces the tale, displaying Ellis’ artistry in blending these two elements. This is a novella where conversations and internal drama take centre stage as opposed to plot and action, and yet Ellis’ sublime prose and gimlet-eyed observations underlined with glints of latent menace add tension to the story as it moves to its startling and satisfying conclusion.\n\nEllis’ wicked sense of humour is top-notch. Lili is the driving force behind some of the novella’s hilarious moments, amply evident in her numerous conversations with Margaret’s mother. We get a sense that Lili is always testing Margaret’s mother, putting her on the defensive through her outspoken views and shrewd questioning.\n\n‘I don’t know why you have to be so contrary,’ snapped my mother. ‘Brides always wear white veils. They always have.’\n\n‘Murder is fairly common too,’ said Lili. ‘It always has been.’\n\n‘Don’t be silly, Lili,’ said my mother. “The white is meant to represent purity and innocence.’\n\n‘That’s pretty stupid,’ said Lili, ‘considering that marriage means an end to all that. I can see why nuns wear white when they take the veil, but when you think of the way everyone goes on at the prospect of the wedding night innocence is the last thing on anyone’s mind.’ She now had a cigarette between her teeth and squinted against the smoke.\n\n‘Don’t be disgusting,’ said my mother.\n\n‘There you are,’ said Lili. ‘You said disgusting.’\n\nThe mother’s defensiveness can also be attributed to her insecurities; she can’t stand being perceived as inferior to Lili when both have received similar education, but Lili has the kind of intelligence, open-mindedness, and life experience that the mother can’t match.\n\nThere’s a striking variety to the texture of the humour here – sometimes withering and self-deprecating, at other times unexpectedly laugh-out-loud. The former is palpable in Margaret’s feeble attempts to argue with her mother out of spite as evinced from this conversation at the beginning…\n\nI told my mother with timid spite, hidden terror and a certain mad braggadocio that in some countries chrysanthemums were considered appropriate only for funerals.\n\n“This is not some countries,’ retorted my mother, perhaps wondering again whether the money she had spent so that I might learn French and a little grace had been utterly wasted, for I had learned only superstition and discontent.\n\nThe laugh-out-loud moments revolve around Lily and her devil-may-care attitude, wonderfully showcased, for instance, in a set-piece where she accompanies Margaret to Mrs Monro’s for tea. The dreariness of this visit is not lost on both Lili and Margaret and when Mrs Monro berates Margaret for wasting the food on her plate, Lili responds with a classic retort once Margaret’s mother-in-law is out of earshot – “You should empty the teapot over the old horror’s head.”\n\nThe characters are brilliantly etched – the darkness of Margaret’s gloom and passivity is expertly interwoven with the joy of Lili’s vivacity and candour. Lily is the obvious interesting character here, but it is Margaret’s self-awareness and richness of thoughts, despite being drenched with despair that adds much depth to her personality and a zing to this story.\n\nI wondered if it was fair to wish somebody dead because he was going to marry me. I wondered if I was truly eternally wicked and how many people had turned to destruction because they had no strength in them. I wondered if the venom of weakness was more dangerous than the rage of power, more insidious with its content of despair, and if when the world failed it would be because it was heavy with inertia and the tears of deceit, not the fires of wrath. I wondered what would happen if I laughed at Syl. He might kill me.\n\nAn array of secondary characters also adds meat to the tale complete with their murky motives and shadowy personas. Margaret’s mother leads the pack here – a woman with a domineering personality and double standards who has no qualms about pushing her daughter to marry despite having a failed marriage behind her and takes pleasure in the trials and tribulations of her ex-husband’s new married life. Then, there’s Syl, the quintessential dull man whose nauseating acts of kindness hide his propensity for pettiness and childish behaviour. His mother Mrs Monro remains an enigma; she seems perhaps kinder and even a tad bearable to Margaret while not being blind to her son’s follies and yet shows no intention of opposing this marriage. And then there is a stream of characters that float on the fringes – Margaret’s father Derek who has a lot on his plate now that he has married again and started a family; Lili’s artist husband Robert fretting over his upcoming exhibition; Derek’s wife Cynthia tied down by the demands of domesticity and two young children.\n\nThe novella’s title has both literal and metaphorical connotations – it stands for not just Margaret’s bridal trousseau at the centre of which is an archaic wedding dress she has been compelled to wear by her mother, but also a metaphor for the excess baggage in these characters’ lives with its associated memories that have the potential to wreak havoc.\n\nDid the elderly have minds like old wardrobes stuffed to overflowing with useless memories and take them out sometimes and look at them and ask themselves why they were there? My own mind seemed full of memories already and I couldn’t imagine storing away the new ones as years and years went by. Some surely must be discarded as outworn, but some wouldn’t let themselves be forgotten. Some would take up for ever more space than they were entitled to like my mother’s wedding dress, shrouded in sheet linen, suspended in time, uncrushed by the other more workaday but less significant garments that crowded together…\n\nIn a nutshell, with its wisdom, impeccable comic timing, and penetrating insights into human nature The Clothes in the Wardrobe is a stunningly written novella and I can’t wait to read the other two books in the trilogy.\n\nAugust is Women in Translation (WIT) Month and I thought this was the perfect time to put together a list of some of my favourite WIT books read in 2023 and 2024 so far, many of them influenced by Kim’s wonderful reading projects (“NYRBWomen23” and “NYRBWomen24”). This list is a mix of 8 languages spread across 11 books – Spanish, Chinese, Russian, French, Hungarian, Swedish, Dutch, and Italian.\n\nA CRACK IN THE WALL by Claudia Piñeiro (Translated from Spanish by Miranda France)\n\nI love how Claudia Piñeiro employs the framework of crime to explore relationships and social issues, and in this aspect, A Crack in the Wall is no different; it’s another excellent tale of cowardice, ruthless ambition, moral ambiguity, deception, and precarious relationships.\n\nThe novel opens with an image of our protagonist Pablo Simó, sitting at his desk “drawing the outline of a building that will never exist.” Pablo works as an architect in the offices of Borla and Associates, a firm engaged in construction and real estate. Borla, a greedy, ambitious man willing to cut corners, is at the helm of things ably helped by his secretary Marta Horvat (with whom he’s having an affair), a beautiful woman Pablo secretly desires. Pablo has worked for Borla for more than a decade but there’s a sense that both Marta and Borla don’t treat him as an equal, and Pablo seems to have resignedly accepted this. The monotony of his days is not lost on Pablo until a stranger walks into their offices one evening deeply disturbing their fragile sense of calm, and evoking deeply hidden memories of a crime committed in the past. In this novel, Piñeiro’s superb storytelling skills are on full display as she artfully combines the finer elements of plot development with astute character portraits that make for an utterly riveting narrative.\n\nLAST WORDS FROM MONTMARTRE by Qiu Miaojin (Translated from Chinese by Ari Larissa Heinreich)\n\nLast Words from Montmartre begins on an ominous note signaling the author’s intention to commit suicide, evident not only from the title but also from this epigraph – “For dead little Bunny and Myself, soon dead.” Deeply confessional and an intense, lyrical book about betrayal, heartbreak, passion, breakdown, and death, the novel is structured as a series of letters and diary entries addressed by the unnamed narrator to various lovers, friends, and family members, offering an intimate glimpse into the protagonist’s inner world. Based on the subject matter alone, it is not always an easy read, but the fierce tone and richness of the writing make it pretty compelling.\n\nQiu Miaojin mysteriously committed suicide after writing Last Words from Montmartre but before its publication fueling discussions about the ‘autobiographical” nature of the novel. This ambiguity is further heightened by these cryptic words at the beginning of the novel – “If this book should be published, readers can begin anywhere. The only connection between the chapters is the time frame in which they were written.” Don’t be fooled by the length – though short, this isn’t a novel that can be breezed through but rather like wine is meant to be sipped slowly and savoured. A book I’m glad to have read and would recommend!\n\nNOT A RIVER by Selva Almada (Translated from Spanish by Annie McDermott)\n\nSet in a rural region of Argentina, Selva Almada’s Not a River is a brilliant, spare novella about male friendship, trauma, encroaching boundaries, unexpressed guilt, grief, and violence. There’s a cinematic feel to the opening pages as we are presented with the image of Enero Rey standing on the boat in the vast river, poised with a gun. He is not alone, accompanying him is his good friend El Negro and a young kid called Tilo.\n\nThe three have come to this island on a camping trip, to spend quality time together, for some much-needed male bonding. Tilo’s father, Eusebio, also a good friend of Enero and El Negro died many years ago, drowned in that very river. On this particular fishing expedition, the three are in pursuit of a large, beautiful sting ray; Enero, dazed by the wine and heat, fires more bullets than is necessary to bring it in. Their activities attract the attention of the island inhabitants – first, a coterie of boys to be followed by a mysterious man called Aguirre, who seems offended by the presence of the three and the manner in which they catch the ray. The sense of tension between the men is immediately palpable, glints of latent menace that fill Enero, El Negro, and Tilo with a sense of foreboding.\n\nWritten in a spare, lean style, and impressive in the way it manages to pack the weight of its themes into these slim pages, Not a River is another excellent work by Selva Almada.\n\nVALENTINO AND SAGITTARIUS by Natalia Ginzburg (Translated from Italian by Avril Bardoni)\n\nIn both Valentino and Sagittarius, we see Natalia Ginzburg in full form; she’s just brilliant at writing about families laced with her trademark dry wit, effectively capturing the simmering tension between an assortment of flawed characters.\n\nIn Valentino, our narrator, Caterina, is a young woman, training to be a teacher and living with her parents and her brother Valentino in a small rented apartment in the middle of town. We learn how Valentino is an utterly spoiled man and the cynosure of their parents’ eyes on whom they have pinned all their hopes for the future. The family’s circumstances are poor, but Valentino who is studying medicine, has a penchant for luxury and idle pursuits, marked by expensive tastes and a hunger for the finer things in life. This level of extravagance lies outside the ambit of the parents’ meager income, but they oblige him at the cost of neglecting Clara and Caterina. And then, one day, he decides to marry Maddalena, a woman considerably older than him and quite ugly. The family is shocked and the stage is set for conflicts and heartaches.\n\nIn Sagittarius, a dark tale of deceit and trickery, the narrator’s mother is a brash, opinionated, overbearing, and chronically dissatisfied woman, who craves a vibrant intellectual and artistic life but is overtly critical of her family. Fed up with the boredom and drabness of village life, the mother moves to the city hopeful of being at the centre of a rich cultural and intellectual milieu and opening her own art gallery, a dynamic space that will attract the who’s who from the city’s artistic and literary circles. And yet, despite this fresh start, the mother remains deeply dissatisfied. The creative and artistic people that she wishes to meet are strangely nowhere to be seen, and the days just stretch before her, endless and empty. Until one day, at the parlour, she strikes up a conversation with the vague but charismatic Priscilla Fontana, also known as Scilla; a questionable friendship that ominously spells doom for the mother.\n\nOTHER WORLDS: PEASANTS, PILGRIMS, SPIRITS, SAINTS by Teffi (Translated from Russian by Robert Chandler, Elizabeth Chandler & Others)\n\nTeffi’s Other Worlds is a beguiling, evocative collection of stories immersed in the world of fairytales and folklore but laced with her intelligence, wit, and psychological acuity; haunting, ethereal stories filled with house spirits and bathhouse devils, she-wolves and shapeshifters, mermaids and monks.\n\nWe begin with “Kishmish”, a wonderful story that starts with sinister overtones and ventures into droll territory capturing a young girl’s inner conflict, her spiritual crisis, and ruminations on how to turn into a saint. “Solovki”, one of my favourites in the collection, is a haunting mood piece about an unhappy marriage, redemption, and spiritual fervor set on a remote island where a group of pilgrims travels annually to visit its monastery. “Leshachikha” is a story about female forest spirits, sibling rivalry, and favouritism, while in “Yavdokha”, an illiterate rustic woman, gets a letter about her son, who is away fighting on the front, and heartbreakingly misunderstands what is communicated to her. In “The Dog”, a story about love, loyalty, bohemianism, and war, the spirit of the narrator’s childhood friend who labels himself her dog comes to her rescue in a moment of crisis.\n\nThe stories in Other Worlds conjure up images of a bygone, faded Russia. These are stories about religion, occult, age-old customs and superstitions, and the supernatural drawing on ancient folklore from Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus but infused with the touch of the modern as they dwell on the realism of timeless human emotions. It’s a wondrous tapestry of stories where the mythical and otherworldly elements are skillfully interwoven into themes of unrequited love, unhappy marriages, family politics, and upstairs-downstairs drama among others.\n\nHER SIDE OF THE STORY by Alba de Céspedes (Translated from Italian by Jill Foulston)\n\nAfter the resounding success of Forbidden Notebook, Her Side of the Story is another excellent novel by Céspedes – ambitious, intense, richly layered but also longer at 500 pages. Packed with astute observations, this is an absorbing internal drama of a deeply conflicted woman complete with her memories, reflections, turmoil, hopes, and frustrations. It’s a story that records her path to self-awareness as it satisfyingly hurtles towards a Ginzburg-reminiscent ending.\n\nFor Alessandra, our protagonist, the crux of her story is her unhappy marriage to Francesco Minelli, but to get to that core she feels it necessary to give the reader a flavour of her childhood, her upbringing, and the neighbourhood she grew up in. We learn of Alessandra’s adoration of her mother Eleanora trapped in a tumultuous marriage to a man they both despise, and which leaves scars on both women. When she grows up into a young woman herself, Alessandra marries Francesco, but her fate disturbingly begins to blend with that of her mother, although it must be said that while Eleanora falls out of love with her husband, Alessandra remains passionately and perhaps frustratingly devoted to Francesco. Set against a background of days leading up to the Second World War, the war itself, the rise of resistance, the fall of Mussolini, and the signing of the armistice, Her Side of the Story explores an array of themes centred on the stifling stronghold of patriarchy, the net it casts over the relationships between men and women ensnaring them in its fold, the concept of romantic love, feminism, alienation and also increasing resistance.\n\nIZA’S BALLAD by Magda Szabó (Translated from Hungarian by George Szirtes)\n\nOn the death of her husband Vince, Ettie goes to live with her daughter Iza in her flat in Budapest. Ettie is ecstatic at first, she looks forward to spending quality time with her beloved daughter, but alas things unfold quite differently. The first days of adjustment in the big, bustling city of Budapest are particularly hard for Ettie who has spent most of her time in a village taking comfort in its familiarity and sense of community. Pest frightens her, and with Iza too immersed in her career and social life, Ettie’s sense of isolation only heightens.\n\nOne of the biggest strengths of the novel is Szabó’s superb characterization. Ettie and Iza are such brilliantly etched, fully realised characters, and Szabó particularly excels in showing how their diametrically opposite personas and outlook set the stage for heartache and tragedy. The two are as unalike as chalk and cheese. Ettie is warm, Iza is frozen. For Ettie the past is an anchor, while Iza is forward-thinking, her gaze settled on the future. Ettie craves companionship, Iza wants to be alone. Iza’s Ballad, then, is a piercing, unflinching examination of a complicated mother-daughter relationship, a striking depiction of two women who are poles apart.\n\nTHE MIRADOR: DREAMED MEMORIES OF IRÈNE NÉMIROVSKY BY HER DAUGHTER by Élisabeth Gille (Translated from French by Marina Harss)\n\nThe Mirador is no ordinary biography. The byline below the title reads “Dreamed Memories of Irène Némirovsky by her Daughter” which is to say Gille has breathed life into her mother by giving her a voice and thus positioned this as a memoir. What we read, therefore, is a first-person narrative giving the impression that it is Irène herself who is speaking directly to us.\n\nThe Mirador comprises two sections – the first is Némirovsky’s imagined memoir penned in 1929 covering her childhood in Russia and Paris amid sweeping changes and a rapidly evolving political landscape; while the somber and hauntingly sad second section fast forwards to 1942, days before her arrest at a time when she was living in precarious circumstances with her husband and two young daughters in a small French village, isolated with a deep sense of foreboding with regards the future.\n\nÉlisabeth Gille traverses the zenith and nadir of her mother’s glittering but cruelly short life; The Mirador is not only a brilliant, immersive, and deeply humane account of Irène Némirovsky’s life lived in tumultuous Russia and France, but also a window into her legacy and fame as a writer par excellence.\n\nTHE WOMAN WHO BORROWED MEMORIES: SELECTED STORIES by Tove Jansson (Translated from Swedish by Thomas Teal & Silvester Mazzarella)\n\nTove Jansson’s The Woman Who Borrowed Memories is a sublime collection of short stories displaying Jansson’s delicate touch and mastery of the form complete with rich characterisations, evocative and often solitary settings, and keen insights on the nuances of human relationships. This collection comprises 26 stories assembled from five books (The Listener, The Doll’s House, Traveling Light, Letters from Klara, and Messages: Selected Stories) published between 1971 and 1998 and showcases Jansson’s incredible range.\n\n“The Listener” is a beautifully expressed, poignant character study of an aging woman losing her sense of self as well as a meditation on loneliness and finding a purpose. “Black-White” is an homage to the talented artist and illustrator Edward Gorey; a story that dwells on the process of creating art with the artist’s sometimes obsessive tendency to strive for perfection. Another favourite “The Cartoonist” is a marvellous, unsettling piece on the price of ambition and the perils associated with the commercialization of art, while jealousy and rivalry take centre stage in “The Doll’s House”, which begins on an innocuous note but steadily descends into violence.\n\nIn graceful, sensitive prose that is filled with air and light, Jansson’s deceptively simple and enchanting writing style transforms into something profound as the stories progress often belying the darker undercurrents flowing underneath.\n\nTHE TEN THOUSAND THINGS by Maria Dermoût (Translated from Dutch by Hans Koning)\n\nA novel of “shimmering strangeness” as aptly described by the blurb at the back of this NYRB edition, the opening chapter in Maria Dermoût’s magical and enigmatic The Ten Thousand Things reverberates with a mesmeric, otherworldly quality as we are transported to the verdant, exotic spice islands of Indonesia called the Moluccas. This chapter is a masterclass in scene setting, conveying a dazzling sense of place, a fascinating blend of myth with reality where the wonders of the island are as fascinating as the evils that lurk within it.\n\nSubsequent chapters dwell on Felicia who is our protagonist and in many ways the pulse of the novel, outlining the course of her life right from childhood to old age, a bulk of which is spent on the island with particular emphasis on her relationship with her grandmother and her son.\n\nThe novel is a glittering mix of stories of menace, myths, legends, and a lush, hypnotic vista against which the individual histories of Felicia and her family are juxtaposed. These are stories seamlessly woven into a rich tapestry of love, loss, loneliness, nostalgia, and memory transforming the novel into one of immense beauty.\n\nEASTBOUND by Maylis de Kerangal (Translated from French by Jessica Moore)\n\nSet aboard the Trans-Siberian Express, Eastbound is a stunning, propulsive, and suspenseful novella of fugitives, flight, and freedom. A young conscript Aliocha, barely twenty, is travelling with a slew of men of his ilk to some godforsaken outpost in Siberia. Right till the last moment, Aliocha refuses to believe that he will be forced to sign up for military service even when all his attempts to avoid conscription prove futile. Now he is on the train galloping towards an unknown destination beset by dread, entrapment, and the driving urgency to escape.\n\nAnd yet, the strange workings of Fate throw him a lifeline. He meets Hélène, an older Frenchwoman in her 40s, who we learn is also a fugitive although Aliocha has no inkling of this at the time. As this fast and furious, adrenaline-charged novella hurtles towards its conclusion, Aliocha and Hélène will encounter some heart-stopping moments that could thwart their uneasy alliance and derail their journey toward freedom. Thundering like a juggernaut, and teeming with nerve-wracking tension, Eastbound soars thanks to Kerangal’s gorgeous, haunting prose with its musical cadences and potent energy.\n\nMy WIT Reading Plans for August\n\nI’ve started the month with Mercè Rodoreda’s In Diamond Square, which I’m enjoying very much. For the rest of August, I plan to select from the stack of books shown in the picture below…\n\nWhat are you planning to read for WIT Month? Do let me know in the comments:)\n\nAfter having read and loved Barbara Comyns’ wonderful Who Was Changed and Who Was Dead earlier this year, I was more than happy to read (more precisely to reread) another of her novels – The Vet’s Daughter, this time for “NYRBWomen24” and it was just as fabulous this second time around…\n\nSomewhere in the middle of this deeply sad and haunting novel, Alice Rowlands, our 17-year-old protagonist discovers that she has the power to levitate. This happens immediately after a particularly traumatic experience where she is almost raped, and subsequently faints. As Alice recuperates in her room, and the day disappears into the night, she realises she is floating. She moves up noiselessly, her blankets fall to the floor, and she feels weightless, almost touching the ceiling. Alice dares not to breathe lest something breaks in her terribly small room, but while touching the gas globe, the mantle breaks depositing chalk powder in her hands. Alice gently floats back down and on waking the next morning feels less afraid and more calm and peaceful. The frequency of these levitations would increase in the subsequent chapters hurtling towards an unexpected outcome, but when we are first introduced to this phenomenon, we wonder about its significance – is this just a flight of fantasy, or Alice’s coping mechanism to retreat into a dream world to escape the daily horrors of her existence, or a unique gift, an inner strength vital to Alice in an otherwise harsh and unforgiving world?\n\nIt is the depiction of Alice Rowlands harrowing life, a lonely girl at the cusp of adulthood that lies at the heart of The Vet’s Daughter – a stunning, unforgettable novel of loss, dysfunctional families, tyranny, vulnerability, and the longing for escape.\n\nWhen the novel opens, Alice is on her way home, to a mean-looking house in a dingy London suburb. Alice’s father is a vet (lending the novel its title), a cruel and brutal man who given his volatile moods and temper not only terrorizes Alice but also his wife (Alice’s mother), a meek little woman suffering from poor health. Alice’s world is narrow and claustrophobic which involves running errands for her temperamental father, feeding the animals, cleaning the cages, and helping her poor, scared mother with cooking and household chores. Visits to her friend Lucy’s house and taking the dog out for walks help ease the dreariness of her days a bit, and on evenings when the father is out, Alice and her mother look forward to the peace and calm, but otherwise in all aspects, Alice’s life is limited and lonely.\n\nThings take a darker turn when Alice’s mother falls terminally ill. Confined to her bed, the mother’s aches and pains and groans are distressing signals of her impending death filling Alice with sadness and foreboding. But in a rare moment of confession, Alice’s mother tells her of her happy childhood on a farm with its space and fresh air, how her parents forbid her to marry the man she loved, and forced her to marry Alice’s father instead who given his qualifications seemed a better prospect. Unsurprisingly, Alice’s mother was miserable in the marriage, always afraid of her husband, and also powerless to do anything about his philandering.\n\nDuring the mother’s final days, the tough and good-natured Mrs Churchill is employed to care for her, and over the days comes to love Alice’s mother, devoting herself to her, and being a comforting presence to Alice after her mother’s death.\n\nI must have walked miles those first few weeks after Mother died, but I couldn’t bear to be home and always thinking of her. Everywhere in the house there were sad little reminders – a limp string shopping-bag hanging from the kitchen door, a fortune-telling book in the dresser-drawer, a fern in the dining-room window that had died from neglect since she had ceased to tend it, and one small black glove mixed up with the string she used to save – little things like that were everywhere.\n\nHowever, Mrs Churchill is unceremoniously packed off when the father brings the disreputable Rosa Fisher home as his companion. Alice is unhappy about this but given her father’s brutal personality can’t do anything about it, so she adjusts. With Rosa refusing to engage in household chores, the burden falls on Alice, relegated to the role of a housekeeper despite being a part of the family.\n\nAs the days progress, Alice and Rosa begin to get on tentatively well, but things become sinister when Rosa insists on introducing Alice to an unsavoury man, a friend of Rosa’s who seems to fancy Alice. Alice is horrified and deliberately avoids him whenever she steps out of the house, but Rosa deceptively lures Alice into a meeting with him which culminates in near-rape.\n\nThe father, in a fit of fury, dismisses Rosa, but Mrs Churchill appears in Alice’s life again and there is also Blinkers, a young man and budding veterinarian who seems to have fallen in love with Alice. Poor Alice tormented by cruelty for much of her life, finds it difficult to process Blinkers’ acts of kindness. Blinkers is a steady, dependable man, whose qualities Alice appreciates only later, perhaps when it’s too late. Meanwhile, Blinkers offers Alice a window to the outside world, the chance to settle in a different environment when he takes her to the countryside to be a companion to his mother Mrs Peebles. And yet, things are not hunky-dory there either – Mrs Peebles is a disturbingly melancholy woman, and the Gowleys, a couple hired by Blinkers to manage the house, are simply ghastly. Forced by another tragedy to return to London, Alice’s fate becomes distressingly darker when her father uncovers her flair to levitate.\n\nOne of the themes touched upon in The Vet’s Daughter is the debilitating impact of tyranny, control, and exploitation of vulnerable people, and Alice’s father is an embodiment of this in the way he abuses Alice both physically and mentally for a larger part of the novel, and later as he tries to misuse her gift of levitation propelled by sheer greed.\n\nBut more than the cruelty of the people in her life and her horrific circumstances, what heartbreakingly stands out in The Vet’s Daughter is Alice’s loneliness and isolation, both physical and emotional. Throughout the novel, we witness how her father’s abusive behavior, emotional neglect, and the oppressive atmosphere of her home leaves her feeling abandoned and disconnected. When Alice loses her mother, she is truly alone, there is not a soul she can talk to and confide in, and there is a particularly heartbreaking paragraph where Alice tries talking to herself if only to alleviate the burden of loneliness. She longs to escape the restricted contours of her existence, and the opportunity to become a companion to Blinkers’ mother finally seems like a gateway to better things, but alas that is not to be given that Mrs Peebles is such a tragic figure herself prone to depressive episodes and preferring solitude rather than Alice’s company.\n\nThe theme of escape is also central to the novel not only in terms of Alice’s yearning to be as far away from home as possible but also in her ability to levitate which could be looked upon as a metaphor for her desire to escape her grim reality. At first, this seems involuntary, a direct response to episodes of trauma and abuse, but later we see how she can control this gift, and in which her father greedily sees an opportunity to make money much against her wishes. An air of death and loss permeate the pages of this novel and Alice, in true Comyns style, absorbs these tragedies as they come, and yet there is ample evidence of scars that remain.\n\nIn a clearing there was a felled beech tree, where I often sat so still that birds came quite near. Now I lay down on this tree and felt a lonely sadness coming over me in waves. Slow tears ran from my eyes and trickled into my ears. I thought, ‘I even cry in a humble, common way, with tears flowing into my ears.’ But the humble, common tears had relieved me…\n\nAs ever with Comyns, one of the striking features of The Vet’s Daughter is its singular unvarnished narrative voice. In terms of age, Alice is somewhere between Frances in the marvellous The Skin Chairs and Sophia in Our Spoons Came From Woolworths, but the essence of her voice remains the same – the innocent, matter-of-fact, and childlike simplicity of narration that blunts the sharper edges of horrors she is forced to face.\n\nComyns’ vivid imagery lends a stark, dreamlike quality to the novel – for instance, when Alice goes to reside with Mrs Peebles around Christmas, the snow and frost transform the countryside into a winter wonderland throbbing with the cry of seagulls in the deafening quiet, as gleaned from this passage…\n\nIt was almost Christmas before the frost came. The water in the cart tracks turned to very white ice, which I enjoyed crunching with my feet, and the pond at the top of the lane was frozen with thin ice which the village children called ‘cat ice,’ but which remained so thin I don’t think it would even have borne the weight of a cat. In the early morning, when I looked out of my bedroom window, the trees and fields were white with hoar frost and the glass in the window was beautifully patterned with it. I’d never loved the frost before but now it enchanted me. Besides the beauty, there were the sounds: the snap of a stick, the hard rustle of a frozen leaf, the crack of breaking ice – even the birds’ winter cries seemed to be sharp and intensified.\n\nThe Vet’s Daughter, then, has all the hallmarks of an adult fairytale laced with Comyns’ strange vision where the fantastical seamlessly blends with the everyday, and the novel’s haunting beauty, despite its moments of horror and sadness, makes it an utterly compelling read. It was the novel that first introduced me to the magic of Comyns off-kilter world about a decade ago, and it remains my favourite.\n\nFaber is steadily reissuing Celia Fremlin’s books which is exciting because I’ve loved what I’ve read so far, her novel The Hours Before Dawn and a couple of her short stories released by Faber in a single edition called Ghostly Stories. And to this, I’m glad to add The Trouble Makers, another brilliant novel, which I can’t recommend highly enough…\n\nIn the first chapter of the novel, our protagonist Katharine, a harried housewife, is trudging back home after the day’s shopping to yet another evening of seemingly never-ending household duties. As she walks through the neighbourhood she spots one of her friends, Mary Prescott, deliberately walking slowly so that she can lengthen the time it will take to reach home. Katharine is perturbed by Mary’s behaviour but also eager to get the latest details of her quarrels with her husband Alan, gossip that is disconcertingly vital to Katharine’s sense of well-being given the unhappiness in her own marriage. Every time she listens to Mary’s travails, Katherine is secretly happy that her own marital life fares better, a small window of solace in an otherwise claustrophobic world.\n\nIt is these women’s lives that form the core of Celia Fremlin’s The Trouble Makers – a brilliant, absorbing, psychologically astute tale of fear, paranoia, the trials of being a housewife, and the malignant force of gossip.\n\nWe meet Katharine in the opening pages, a woman burdened by the stress of running and managing her home and family as evident from her train of thought. Katharine is standing in a bus queue, that welcome period that gives her a break from being constantly on the move, allowing her time for herself however brief…\n\nSometimes Katharine felt the evening rush hour to be an almost tranquil thing. These long, devitalised queues provided a massed solitude-a breathing-space; an amorphous, unassailable no-man’s-land between work and home, where you had an opportunity, at last, to worry in peace.\n\nAs she ponders the chores she needs to complete while managing the moods and temperaments of her husband Stephen and their three children, we get a sense of the unhappiness and resentment that seethes within her. Among many things, Katharine and Stephen don’t often see eye to eye on how to bring up their daughters – Katharine is more easygoing and a confidante for the girls, while Stephen is distressingly particular about their manners and behaviour, craving for respect from the girls that he feels is lacking – as a result of which the atmosphere at home is often tense and a constant source of friction between husband and wife. Katharine, meanwhile, loves her daughters but they also annoy her for a variety of reasons – the eldest Clare is a plodding girl, struggling with studies that often bring her on the verge of tears; Flora is the bright one but infuriatingly righteous and patronising; and the youngest is Jane who adores her pet rabbit, and is always arranging programmes around him that only adds fuel to an already fraught relationship between Katharine and Stephen.\n\nWith the children creating a ruckus almost every day which irritates Stephen no end, Katharine finds herself treading on eggshells as she struggles to maintain an equilibrium between such opposing forces as her husband and daughters, a task that largely involves keeping Stephen in the dark about the girls’ activities, feeding him little white lies which Katharine deems harmless as long as it holds the peace.\n\nThis, we learn, is the plight of quite a few women in the neighbourhood as they frequently gather to bicker about their husbands in a show of solidarity, secret glee, and even one-upmanship. So restricted are their lives by the daily grind of domesticity, their roles limited to catering to the demands of a patriarchal society that the only way for these women to let out steam is through gossip. There’s Mrs Forsythe always quick to deride her husband who comes across as an ineffectual man reaping the benefits of living in a man’s world as she is required to unfailingly cater to his needs. There’s the brash, opinionated Stella who leaves no stone unturned in bragging about her seemingly spotless children, the epitome of model good behaviour who study in good schools, the kind of bragging that annoys Katharine because she is made to feel that her children come up short in comparison.\n\nKatharine is part of this gossip circle, although she remains uneasy about bad-mouthing Stephen to these women; she is obviously miserable in her marriage but at the same time feels guilty about betraying Stephen, and also conflicted about not contributing enough to the conversation. And yet, Katharine’s role in this group is implicit, if not through words then through silence – she may not actively gossip about Stephen, but she is more than willing to prod others in their circle to air grievances about their husbands.\n\nAll the women, though, seem united in their secret agreement that Mary is the one who has received the short end of the stick when it comes to painful husbands. Mary despises Alan who always criticizes her quietly and politely leaving no room for Mary to defend herself. Mary would rather have preferred a husband who raged and shouted, but instead, she is stuck with Alan in whose ambit of cold fury Mary finds herself out of depth. Even their adopted daughter Angela is a tricky issue – she was adopted at Mary’s insistence, Alan would have preferred not having children and moving on.\n\nBut things take an unnerving turn when Angela knocks on Katharine’s door unexpectedly that evening. Turns out that she has been uncharacteristically left home alone, Alan is nowhere to be found and neither is Mary. Out of sheer curiosity, and even worry, Katharine and Stella comb through the house for clues and discover blood in Alan’s study. It appears that Alan had a minor accident, and Mary is in the hospital with him. It later emerges that Alan was attacked by a burglar, a dark man in a raincoat, leaving Mary completely distraught.\n\nAfter these shocking incidents, when Mary confides a secret to Katharine, a secret she claims she has told no other, Katharine finds herself caught in a maelstrom, as the subsequent rapid unravelling of events dotted with a sprinkle of suspicious occurrences increasingly leaves her bewildered. Adding fuel to the fire is the dark man in a raincoat who rears his ugly head again as Angela and even Alan’s sister Auntie Pen spot him lurking under a street lamp on different days further heightening Mary’s rising paranoia.\n\nThe Trouble Makers, then, is a wonderfully suspenseful tale, domestic horror at its finest, as Celia Fremlin artfully plumbs the depths of women’s domestic lives, the feelings of claustrophobia and entrapment they feel caught in the snares of patriarchy where they are often at the receiving end of passive and cleverly veiled male aggression. This skillful exploration of the everyday is brilliantly laced with her razor-sharp acumen as her characters grapple with sinister circumstances and mounting psychological pressures. The mechanics of gossip and its consequences and the presence of politics in a housewife’s narrow world is also superbly depicted – while they find consolation in each other’s company united by common grievances, there’s also a sense of unhealthy competition and the primal instinct to pull the other woman down through the uncontrollable force and widespread tentacles of rumours and gossip.\n\nThe suspense and atmosphere in The Trouble Makers is top-notch adding to the sense of unease and creeping dread – the eerie silence of the night (“the shock of sudden stillness like the shock of sudden sound”), the piercing rings of doorbells at unexpected moments, wild and frantic knockings on the door, the hazy silhouettes lurking in the dark, the potent force of irrational fears intermingled with the deceptive calm and tranquility of ordinary domestic settings, and the shadowy realms of the mind where crippling anxieties fuel troubled dreams. Through her murky yet evocative portrayal of the dark man in a raincoat, Fremlin unleashes the unnerving power and fear of the unknown – he represents a figure who is banal and frightening at the same time and can be anybody (men wearing raincoats being so common) and also nobody (his exact identity being a mystery).\n\nEven when it comes to the portrayal of the everyday concerns of a housewife, her observational skills are spot on – for instance, in a scene earlier on in the novel, as they discuss an upcoming fireworks party, Auntie Pen tells Katharine of the convenience and usefulness of old coats (“An old coat is so useful, isn’t it, and so irreplaceable? It takes years and years to get another old coat, whereas a new one can be bought in five minutes”), and later on, when Katharine spends the evening at Mary’s home with the responsibility of looking after Angela when Mary is away, she is filled with a sense of peace and rest, reveling in the luxury of sitting still in a home that is not hers, released from the efforts of continuously cleaning and other mundane tasks.\n\nFor a few minutes she sat idly on the sofa, looking through a magazine. There was more than enough time for the mending in the four hours or so before the Prescotts could be back, and it was so restful to sit in someone else’s house doing absolutely nothing. You could never do this at home; there was always something, somewhere, nagging at your conscience – usually in full view, too, no matter where you sat. Curtains that needed washing if you faced the window; a grate that needed black-leading if you faced the fire: books that needed sorting and dusting if you faced the wall: the threadbare piece of carpet that needed patching if you faced the door. But here nothing mattered at all. Indeed, the blemishes in someone else’s home can be a positive delight to a jaded housewife’s eye. The black smudge on the wallpaper that you don’t have to rub at with breadcrumbs; the vase of wilting flowers that you don’t have to give fresh water to; the dust in the carved table legs that you don’t have to poke at with a duster wrapped round a stick. Bliss!\n\nThe atmospheric quality of the novel also comes to the fore in Fremlin’s evocative descriptions of the natural surroundings that amplify the magnitude of the characters’ already existing fears. Here’s a passage that superbly conveys Katharine’s troubled, overactive mind as she traverses a lonely stretch of wasteland on the way to her daughter’s school…\n\nBut it was queer how lonely a place could be, so near to busy roads: lonely, and deeply, mysteriously alive in its own right. Even though there was no wind, the bare twigs of the elder bushes were forever moving; twitching, stirring, shuddering against the heavy reddish clouds. Even the ground itself was not quite still. All round her, far into the darkness on every side, there was a something less than rustling, less than pattering or dripping – the vast, indefinable stir of autumn wetness soaking its way into the earth: rotting its way through old newspaper; rusting its way through old cans; somehow, by some route, reaching its victorious end in the deep ground.\n\nKatharine stood still and listened to the huge, faint tumult of the dying season. It was a mistake, of course; for as soon as she stood still and listened she began to fancy she heard other sounds, too-definite, yet inexplicable.\n\nFrom helping with her daughters’ homework and planning their activities to mending the fabric of her marriage to Stephen while also confronting the terrifying spectre of the dark man in a raincoat that pushes Mary to the fringes of paranoia, Katharine finds herself unwillingly donning the garb of a juggler desperately trying to assuage her friend’s fears while also containing her own, as the novel hurtles towards its terrifying but immensely satisfying conclusion.\n\nIn a nutshell, then, in Celia Fremlin’s world, the thin veneer of normalcy can often hide deeper, darker psychological truths, and in this aspect The Trouble Makers more than delivers.\n\nI read some stellar books during May and June with most of these (barring one) being strong contenders for my year-end list. These books were a mix of Kim’s #NYRBWomen24 reading project, translated literature, British and Irish literature, and Golden Age crime. If I had to pick favourites, they would be Gustafsson and Enard.\n\nSo, without further ado, here’s a brief look at the seven books…You can read the detailed reviews on the first six by clicking on the title links.\n\nA TILER’S AFTERNOON by Lars Gustafsson (Translated from Swedish by Tom Geddes)\n\nLars Gustafsson’s marvellous novella – A Tiler’s Afternoon – is a strange, hypnotic, existential tale exploring loss, the power of memories, the meaning of work, and the mysteries of life, that as the title suggests captures one working day in the life of an ageing, lonely tiler. On a grey November morning in 1982, we meet Torsten Bergman, the tiler of the title and our protagonist, aged 65 and living alone in Uppsala, Sweden, a man pretty much at the end of this tether. Then one Thursday morning, the piercing shrill of the telephone sets the stage for the unravelling of a puzzling, disconcerting set of events. A man called Pentti, a plumber and a jack of all trades, who has worked with Torsten in the past, tells him of some tiling work to be done in a big, old-fashioned, suburban house. When Torsten lands at the house that is to be his workplace, he is impressed by its stylishness and ambitious planning. But there’s not a soul to be found.\n\nTorsten, nevertheless, gets to work, priding on his resourcefulness while also being lost in his daydreams, but as the clock ticks away, the mysterious quality of the house begins to spark a sense of unease. By turns quiet, understated, and unsettling, with its masterful interplay of melancholia and wry humour, A Tiler’s Afternoon is a powerful little gem.\n\nTHE ANNUAL BANQUET OF THE GRAVEDIGGERS’ GUILD by Mathias Enard (Translated from French by Frank Wynne)\n\nEnard’s The Annual Banquet of the Gravediggers Guild is a dazzling feat of the senses, a brilliant novel of rural life, violence and death, love and revelry, agriculture and anthropology, reincarnation, and the afterlife. Set in the marshlands of Deux Sevres, a village called La Pierre-Sainte-Christophe in Western France, the novel comprises seven sections but is arranged in a circular structure that begins and ends with an anthropologist’s journal entries, enveloping a third-person narrative that is the hallmark of Enard’s rich, dense, immersive prose style, that in turn surrounds the novel’s central feature, the icing on the cake, which is the banquet or the feast that gives the novel its name, a section that brims with ribaldry and bawdy humour. The Annual Banquet is a richly detailed, intricately crafted literary feast with its exhilarating range of styles, forms, and voices, garnished with Enard’s trademark historical and literary references that make his books such a pleasure to read.\n\nLIFE WITH PICASSO by Françoise Gilot & Carlton Lake\n\nIn 1953, Françoise Gilot, in her early thirties and with two children in tow, left Pablo Picasso, painter extraordinaire, with whom she was in a relationship for a decade. A move that greatly enraged the powerful and influential Picasso, he threatened to destroy Gilot’s painting career. That Picasso should behave abominably is not surprising once you have read Gilot’s memoir and got a sense of his personality – a narcissistic and entitled bully, and deeply disrespectful of women. The publication of Gilot’s memoir also faced a lot of rage and drama, Picasso tried to halt its release but to no avail. Picasso, who had no qualms about criticizing his peers and other important people in his life, could not handle any criticism leveled at him.\n\nIt explains his response to Gilot’s memoir and yet, Life with Picasso isn’t a book that only rails against Picasso but rather a comprehensive, richly layered text that highlights Picasso’s extraordinary talent as an artist and painter along with fascinating snippets on an array of renowned well-known artists and painters who were his contemporaries whom Gilot met first-hand. In terms of tone, it is a frank, honest, detached portrayal of a fascinating yet turbulent time in Gilot’s life, a very balanced account of a complex, difficult man – a celebration of his art and painting techniques but also a critique of his volatile temperament and persona. More importantly, Life with Picasso is about Françoise Gilot herself, her independence, her intelligence and fearlessness, her singlemindedness in pursuing art, and her courage to stand up to a man who consistently failed to value her.\n\nENDLESS NIGHT by Agatha Christie\n\nAgatha Christie’s Endless Night is a haunting, ominous, artfully crafted tale of greed, love, ambition, and deception. It’s unlike her usual mysteries featuring the drama-inclined Hercule Poirot and the psychologically astute Miss Marple in the sense that the tone feels more noirish as it culminates in an ending that reeks of despair.\n\nMichael Rogers, our narrator, is an aimless drifter never sticking to a job, seeking new adventures, and refusing to settle down in the conventional sense. One day, he finds himself in the English village of Kingston Bishop where a sign for a house on sale catches his attention. Turns out the house is called The Towers, situated on a lonely stretch of land called Gipsy’s Acre, unoccupied for a long time and almost in ruins. Michael learns that it is cursed, but there is something in the air of Gipsy’s Acre that makes him want to buy it, find a girl he loves, and settle there. Told entirely from Michael’s perspective, there is a melancholy, dreamlike quality to the narrative, an all-pervading sense of doom that makes itself felt from the very beginning, of things not likely to end well, but we don’t yet know how or why.\n\nGREENGATES by RC Sherriff\n\nGreengates is a wonderful, absorbing tale of retirement, building a new home, the excitement and trepidation of fresh beginnings, and the search for meaning and fulfillment in later life.\n\nIn the opening pages, we are introduced to Tom Baldwin on the last day of his employment as a senior insurance clerk. Despite this big and inevitable change, Mr Baldwin, at first, is enthusiastic about charting a new life and routine post retirement, but as the days progress, his enthusiasm begins to peter out. He struggles to adjust to his new life of leisure, but more importantly, Tom’s despondency and morose demeanour begin to impact and fluster Edith too. One autumn Saturday, though, everything suddenly changes when they go for a country walk as a much-needed change of scene.\n\nComing across a construction project, when a salesman convinces them to tour one of their show houses, Tom and Edith are entranced by the cleanliness and newness of the house, the abundance of space and modern amenities, so unlike the pondering build of Grasmere, their current residence. They love the house, and their initial hesitation gives way to excitement as they realise they want to move into such a home and rebuild their lives. Sherriff brilliantly captures the sense of excitement, aspiration, sprinkle of recklessness, bouts of fear, and the sudden twinge of nostalgia associated with the whole process of buying a new house and selling the old one.\n\nA GAME OF HIDE AND SEEK by Elizabeth Taylor\n\nElizabeth Taylor’s masterful A Game of Hide and Seek is another beautifully rendered tale of the complexities of love, marriage, loneliness, and missed chances written with the subtlety and astuteness so characteristic of her writing.\n\nThat there could be a possibility of something brewing between eighteen-year-olds Harriet and Vesey is palpable from the very first page, when the two of them are playing a game of hide and seek with Vesey’s cousins, Deirdre and Joseph, entrusted into Harriet’s care. Deirdre and Joseph are still children, but Deirdre is perceptive enough to sense the understated yet potent connection between Harriet and Vesey. Harriet is a tentative and timid young woman, with no remarkable talents for whom the prospect of a meaningful career or a chosen path seems dim, while Vesey comes across as self-centered and unreliable, prone to pursuing his whims without regard for others’ feelings. Harriet is enthralled by Vesey’s magnetic personality, clearly attracted to him, but she remains unsure of her feelings being requited. Eventually, their paths take dramatically opposite trajectories widening the distance between them until one day, after many decades, Vesey suddenly re-enters Harriet’s life.\n\nTaylor’s characterization is superb, particularly in the nuanced portrayal of her central characters – the internal anguish, unspoken words, crippling fears, and insecurities that they struggle to navigate.\n\nSO LATE IN THE DAY by Claire Keegan\n\nClaire Keegan’s So Late in the Day is a story about misogyny and missed chances, which I’m afraid didn’t completely work for me. In the opening pages, we meet our protagonist Cathal, a clerk in a Dublin office, who goes about his usual work. Judging from his interactions with his colleagues, there’s a sense that the day is significant but revealed to us only in the later pages. On his way home, his thoughts drift to a woman called Sabine with whom he was in a relationship and gradually the nature of their relationship is fleshed out. Sabine is the one who appears to be giving a lot in the relationship, while Cathal comes across as an increasingly conservative, misogynistic man, his nature shaped by his faulty upbringing. Keegan’s prose is wonderful as ever – spare and lyrical, and yet the story lacked the subtle touches seen in Small Things Like These and Foster that made those two books so unforgettable.\n\nThat’s it for May and June.
