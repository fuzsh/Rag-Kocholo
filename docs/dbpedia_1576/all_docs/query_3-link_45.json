        "text": "I feel like thereâ€™s been a bunch of fun news lately but Iâ€™ve been busy at my day job, including a whirlwind trip to Montreal in the heart of winter, and writing Mistressâ€™s Master (Men in Blue 3) in the evenings. Between all that, I havenâ€™t taken the time to share as much as I could have. Sorry! ðŸ™‚\n\nSoâ€¦ first up, is a biggie. I just found out today that Canâ€™t Buy Love, Red Light Book 3 featuring Star will release from Elloraâ€™s Cave on FEBRUARY 23RD! HOORAY! And you donâ€™t have to wait a long time either. For those of you who were a little timid about reading because of the lack of HEA, youâ€™ll be glad to know there is a solid HFN at the end of Canâ€™t Buy Love that incorporates the story line from the first two books. Click on the cover for a blurb and excerpt!\n\nNext, Kaylaâ€™s Gift has an official cover! I have to say my hatâ€™s off to Angie Waters again for bringing the crew to life. In fact, Kaylaâ€™s Gift is dedicated to my fabulous cover artist. The artwork sheâ€™s done for this series has really captured the spirit of the heroes and are just plain yummilicious. Click on the cover for a blurb and excerpt from Powertools book three, coming MAY 3RD.\n\nAs a random aside, Kaylaâ€™s Gift will be my fifteenth published book! My good friend Jambrea Jo Jones has her fifteenth coming out just hours apart. Weâ€™re going to have to have a celebration event of some sort so keep your eyes peeled!\n\nI also heard today that Morganâ€™s Surprise was awarded a 4.5 Cherry review from LASR Whipped Cream! This means it will be up for best book of the week in the poll that opens for voting tomorrow. If you enjoyed the book, I would love your support. You can check out the review here.\n\nLast, as far as I can remember at the moment, but certainly not leastâ€¦ When I first started writing I stumbled upon a great group of critique partners who helped me immensely. One of them was Elayne Venton! Almost five years from sitting down to write my first book, the group we belonged to is defunt but we havenâ€™t lost touch with each other. In fact, Elayne has interviewed me in her newsletter this month. Feel free to stop by and read a little bit about how I got started and whatâ€™s coming next here.\n\nWhew!\n\nJayne\n\nwww.jaynerylon.com"
