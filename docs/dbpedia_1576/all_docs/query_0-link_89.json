        "text": "THIS IS NOT A CANON…\n\nIt is, however, a complete inventory of the archive. For the sake of convenience and to aid those authors, publishers, and supporters who might be interested in helping us acquire additional texts for the archive (whether through donation or through purchase), we felt it would be useful to have the contents available for all to see. In 2017, we also drew on our own private collections to supplement the exhibit and fill in some gaps (physical and in terms of representation), but moving forward we hope to establish an archive that will be completely independent."
