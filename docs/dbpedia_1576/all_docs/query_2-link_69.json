Diversity and its Discontents\n\nVirtual Event\n\nPresented by Marta Tienda, Maurice P. During â22 Professor of Demographic Studies\n\nand Professor of Sociology and Public Affairs\n\nPrinceton University\n\nThe United States is the most demographically complex nation in the world, but does diversity undermine social cohesion? In its 2003 decision permitting narrowly tailored consideration of race in college admissions (Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 328-29), the U.S. Supreme Court opined that diversity is a compelling state interest. But what does that mean, exactly? This lecture will describe the changing ethno-racial composition of the U.S. population and discuss social, economic and political implications of these changes by focusing on higher education, where access has become contested terrain. I interrogate whether and how diversity undermines cohesion on college campuses. I also provide evidence about diversity and social cohesion by drawing on evidence about intermarriage, voting behavior and attitude surveys signaling acceptance of others.\n\nCo-sponsored by Hofstra University Phi Beta Kappa Society, the Hofstra Cultural Center and the Visiting Scholar Program, The Phi Beta Kappa Society. in collaboration with Latin American and Caribbean Studies Program\n\nEvent is FREE and open to the public.

Here on Long Island Republicans swept nearly every election. Following recent elections, weâve heard people talk of red waves and blue waves. Was this a red wave?\n\nJoin Hofstra Professors Philip Dalton (Rhetoric and Public Advocacy and Center for Civic Engagement); Mary Anne Trasciatti (Labor Studies and Rhetoric and Public Advocacy); and Rosanna Perotti (Political Science), as we discuss this election and its meaning as we look forward to next yearâs midterms.\n\nCo-sponsored by the Center for Civic Engagement and the Hofstra Cultural Center.\n\nLeo A.

Guthart Cultural Center Theater\n\nAxinn Library, South Campus\n\n1-2:25 p.m.\n\nCenter for âRace,â Cultural and Social Justice\n\nThe Colloquia Series\n\nHofstra faculty members present their recent and ongoing publications and engage critically and theoretically with new scholarship focused on ârace,â culture, and social justice.\n\nDr. Jonathan Lightfoot\n\nCo-Director, Center for âRace,â Culture and Social Justice\n\nAssociate Professor of Teaching, Learning and Technology\n\nPrivileging âRaceâ at Centers and Institutes in Higher Education: A Study of the Landscape\n\nCenters and institutes have become an increasingly important part of the higher education landscape. This research takes a closer look at centers and institutes in the United States of America that focus on issues of ârace,â culture and social justice to determine the value they bring to their host institutions. They offer an opportunity to produce and share interdisciplinary research and bypass the restrictions often inherent within the traditional departmental design. Removing structural barriers that limit creativity and innovation can broaden ideological perspectives and address larger policy problems towards the greater public good. Qualitative determinations of value will hopefully inspire more colleges and universities to establish or increase support of centers and institutes that seek to challenge issues of âraceâ and racism and the intersectional social injustices they engender.\n\nPresented by the Center for âRace,â Culture and Social Justice, Center for Civic Engagement and the Hofstra Cultural Center.\n\n6-8 p.m.\n\nKeynote Panel\n\nVIGILANTISM IN THE UNITED STATES: âA START â¦ WITH NO FINISH?â\n\nfeaturing\n\nFrederick K. Brewington, Esq.\n\nCivil Rights Attorney\n\nMark C. Niles\n\nProfessor of Law\n\nHofstra University Maurice A. Deane School of Law\n\nThe presentation will focus on the roots of the civil rights movement in the United States which began after the Civil War with the 13th Amendment, and the creation of Black Codes and the 1871 passage of the KKK Act. The KKK act is federal legislation enacted as an attempt to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution â an amendment aimed at protecting all citizens from state laws that enabled discrimination against people of color. Since that time, vigilantism against people of color has continued in various forms, from lynchings, to so-called âstand your ground laws,â to citizens arrests. Both Niles and Brewington, will discuss the history and local implications of the vigilante phenomenon in our society and its impact overall, particularly on people of color.\n\nThis article and video below features Frederick Brewington regarding desegregation in a Malverne school that he eventually attended.\n\nhttps://newyork.cbslocal.com/2022/02/07/malverne-school-desegregation-black-history-month-fred-brewington-dr-martin-luther-king-jr/\n\nPresented by the Center for âRace,â Culture and Social Justice, Center for Civic Engagement and the Hofstra Cultural Center.\n\nWatch Event Video\n\nView event photos\n\nRead The Hofstra Chronicle News Story\n\nWednesday, February 23, 7-8:30 p.m.\n\nPATH TO ABOLITION:\n\nAnalyzing the Legacy of Malcolm\n\nProfessor Jamel Coy Hudson teaches courses on rhetoric and public advocacy at Hofstra University and Baruch College at City University of New York.

In this talk I will present a few problems from this intersection and show how random graphs was used to design the tool. There are two main reasons to include random graph models in mining complex networks. One may use random graphs to produce synthetic graphs with known ground truth. Or, the null-models can be used to test whether a given object exhibits some âsurprisingâ property that is not expected on the basis of chance alone. Applications include community detection, link prediction and anomaly detection, among others.\n\nDr. Pawel Pralat is a Full Professor at Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada, and the Director of Fields-CQAM Lab on Computational Methods in Industrial Mathematics at The Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences.\n\nCo-sponsored by the Hofstra Cultural Center and the Department of Math.\n\nLeo A.

He will delve into support for Ukraine throughout the world through art and other clever strategies. He will also discuss the psychological role of visual satire and memes in helping to promote the Ukrainian war effort and as a counter to Putinâs aggressively expansionist policy of ârusskii mirâ (the Russian world), which constitutes a replay of the tsarsâ sixteenth-century gathering of lands Putin perceives to be historically Russian in the twenty-first.\n\nMichael Naydan is Woskob Family Professor of Ukrainian Studies and Professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures at The Pennsylvania State University and works primarily in the fields of Ukrainian and Russian literature and literary translation. He has published over 50 articles on literary topics, more than 80 translations in journals and anthologies, and more than 40 books of translations and edited volumes.\n\nPresented by the Department of History in collaboration with the Hofstra Cultural Center.\n\nEvent is FREE and open to the public.

Registrants will be sent an email with zoom link prior to join event.\n\nTuesday, March 29, 11:20 a.m.-12:45 p.m.\n\nAfro-Peruvian Music Workshop\n\nAfro-Peruvian music dates back to colonial times, and later in the 19th century it reached its peak, expressing its uniqueness in typical dances such as the Marinera, festejo, landÃ³, tondero, zamacueca, and contrapunto de zapateo. Araceli Poma, âHuevitoâ LobatÃ³n, and Yuri Juarez offer us the best of the Afro-Peruvian heritage through a workshop with songs and dances alluding to the great black culture of Peru.\n\nAraceli Poma\n\nAraceli Poma is one of the most representative artists of the new generation of Peruvian musicians. Araceli was nominated for the 2020 Latin Grammy Awards, with the album and documentary âThe Warrior Women of Afro-Peruvian Musicâ, produced by the North American label JUST PLAY. This production poses a defiant challenge to racism, sexism and marginalization, through the power of the music and culture of the African diaspora. Her work is defined by her interest in making visible the fundamental contribution of women, challenging racism and marginalization through her musicârecovering popular genres of Peruvian music, disseminating the legacy of male and female cultivators of the musical traditionâand, due to her Afro-Andean heritage, betting for the unification and integration of cultures. For more information on Araceli Poma visit aracelipoma.com\n\nFredy âHuevitoâ LobatÃ³n\n\nâHuevitoâ was born and raised in Lima, Peru, with a father who led a highly respected Afro-Peruvian music and dance troupe, Huevito learned the rhythms, and the CajÃ³n, at a very young age. He is also a three-time winner of Peruâs national zapateo fancy footwork contest. LobatÃ³n is considered one of the masters of Peruvian zapateo in the world, and one of the most virtuoso percussionists of his generation. His distinctive approach to the CajÃ³n, Quijada (jawbone) and Cajita, in a jazz context has made him a pioneer among Afro-Peruvian percussionists.\n\nYuri JuÃ¡rez\n\nYuri MartÃ­n JuÃ¡rez Yllescas is a guitarist and composer, began his career in 1996 as guitarist for various groups of Afro-Peruvian music, folk and fusion. His musical training ranges from formal studies at New York University with Gil Goldstein, John Scofield and Peter Bernstein and with the Peruvian masters of the guitar such as Pepe Torres, Alvaro Lagos, Jorge MadueÃ±o and more âstreetâ experience in Afro-Peruvian PeÃ±as. He has shared the stage and recorded with musicians such as Eva AyllÃ³n, Susana Baca, Arturo OâFarrill, Ron Carter, and iconic Peruvian composers such as Kiri Escobar and Javier Lazo, and trail blazing bands including the Gabriel AlegrÃ­a Afro-Peruvian Sextet, among others.

The documentary looks particularly at the town of Carmel, Indiana, and their struggle over the introduction of diversity, equity and inclusion in the classrooms. A battle has erupted over those that welcome the changes and others that view it as \"leftist indoctrination of their children,\" or the introduction of critical race theory in schools.\n\nRead The Hofstra Chronicle News Story\n\nDiscussion will be facilitated by: Amudalat Ajasa\n\nMajor: Journalism; Minors: Global Studies and Meteorology\n\nand\n\nDr. Katrina Sims\n\nAssistant Professor of History\n\nFaculty-in-Residence\n\nHofstra University\n\nPresented by the Hofstra Cultural Center and the Office of Intercultural Engagement and Inclusion in collaboration with the NOAH Scholars' Program, The Lawrence Herbert School of Communication, Black Student Union, Hofstra NAACP Chapter, and the African Students Association.\n\nGuthart Cultural Center Theater, Axinn Library, First Floor, South Campus\n\nView Event Photos\n\nWednesday, March 30, 4:15-5:45 pm\n\nCarceral Straits and Sentimental Appeals:\n\nAfro-Cuban Political Deportees in Chafarinas\n\nIn 1847, Spain occupied and incorporated the Chafarinas Islands, just off the Moroccan coast, into its carceral circuit in the Straits of Gibraltar; the tiny archipelago joined existing nodes of confinement in CÃ¡diz, Melilla, Ceuta, and VÃ©lez de la Gomera. In this talk, I will focus on one group of Cubans who were forcibly sent to Chafarinas at the end of the second of Cubaâs three independence wars, the âLittle Warâ, in 1880. This deportee group was largely comprised of Afro-Cubans (many of them previously enslaved) and included significant numbers of women and children. I study the confluence of processes of racialization and discourses of family and sentimentality. The Afro-Cubans, I argue, sought to mobilize those discourses for their ends, a phenomenon that would ultimately pit the Spanish against the British empire, exemplifying the fraught interactions and intersections of diverse colonial spheres.\n\nPresenter: Susan Martin-MÃ¡rquez, Professor of Cinema Studies/Spanish and Portugese/Comparative Literature\n\nRutgers University, New Brunswick\n\n105 Breslin Hall, South Campus\n\nPresented by the Latin American and Caribbean Studies Program.\n\nFor more information, email Professor Benita Sampedro Vizcaya at benita.sampedro@hofstra.edu.\n\nWednesday March 30, 6:30-8 p.m.\n\nCELEBRATE: Women and Freedom Music with Vienna Carroll and The Folk\n\nVienna Carroll and The Folk will join us for a performance and talk back as she walks down memory lane inviting us all into forgotten history, weaving personal and found stories with rousing song and images.

While the change of status of the two islands was mostly perceived as a positive development, the people of Guadeloupe and Martinique have a specific history and identity that is distinct from that of the French metropolitan population. To this day, many feel misunderstood and discriminated against. The current sanitary crisis with Covid-19 has brought underlying conflicts to the surface and let to a movement for cultural validation in the French Caribbean that is worth exploring and discussing. #HofNoHate\n\nProfessor Sabine Loucif teaches French and Francophone Studies in the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures, and she is an active member of the Latin American and Caribbean Studies Program, the Africana Studies Program and the Womenâs Studies Program at Hofstra.\n\nPresented by the Latin American and Caribbean Studies Program.\n\nBreslin Hall 209, South Campus\n\nFor more information, email the Latin American and Caribbean Studies Porgram at LACS@hofstra.edu.\n\nWednesday, April 13, 2:40-4:05 p.m.\n\nCoffeeland: One Manâs Dark Empire and the Making of Our Favorite Drug\n\nCoffee is an indispensable part of daily life for billions of people around the world.

In the process, both El Salvador and the United States earned the nickname âCoffeeland,â but for starkly different reasons, and with consequences that reach into the present. Provoking a reconsideration of what it means to be connected to faraway people and places, Coffeeland tells the hidden and surprising story ofone of the most valuable commodities in the history of global capitalism.\n\nPresenter: Augustine Sedgewick, City University of New York\n\n209 Breslin Hall, South Campus\n\nPresented by the Latin American and Caribbean Studies Program.\n\nFor more information, email Professor Benita Sampedro Vizcaya at benita.sampedro@hofstra.edu.\n\nEARTH DAY\n\nTuesday, April 19, 2022\n\n11:20 a.m.-12:45 p.m.\n\nIndigenous Leaders in the Climate Movement\n\nPresenter: Alex Attilli, Center for Civic Engagement Fellow\n\nIndigenous voices for decades have been some of the most vocal proponents for climate action.

They resulted into the brief and unequal incorporation of these territories into the Spanish nation, a project which did not prevent uneven decolonization processes in Spanish Africa, with dissimilar consequences: from the effective independence of Equatorial Guinea to the forced integration of Western Sahara into a neighbour state within the Maghreb. This presentation analyses the trajectory of postcolonial relations between Spanish and African rulers, and it inquires into the possibility of granting citizenship status to old colonial subjects and their descendants.\n\nPresented by the Department of the Romance Languages and Literatures, the Africana Studies Program and the European Studies.\n\nFor more information visit https://www.hofstra.edu/latin-american-caribbean-studies/\n\nDistinguished African Scholars and Writers Series\n\nFeaturing Imali J.
