LGBTQ Literature and Libraries

LGBTQ literature, books, and authors play a crucial role in shaping our understanding of diverse identities, experiences, and struggles. These works are not only important for the LGBTQ community but also for society as a whole. They provide a platform for marginalized voices to be heard, challenge stereotypes, and foster empathy and understanding.

One of the most significant contributions of LGBTQ literature is its ability to provide representation and visibility to individuals who have historically been marginalized and underrepresented in mainstream media. By sharing their stories, LGBTQ authors help to normalize and humanize their experiences, making it easier for readers to empathize with and understand the challenges they face.

Moreover, LGBTQ literature often addresses important social and political issues, such as discrimination, prejudice, and the fight for equality. These works can serve as powerful tools for advocacy and activism, helping to raise awareness and promote social change.

In addition to its social and political significance, LGBTQ literature also has immense cultural value. It enriches our literary landscape by offering diverse perspectives and narratives that challenge traditional norms and conventions. This diversity not only makes our literature more inclusive but also more interesting and thought-provoking.

LGBTQ literature has a profound impact on individuals who identify as LGBTQ. For many, reading about characters and experiences that reflect their own can be incredibly validating and empowering. It can help them to feel seen and understood, and to realize that they are not alone.

LGBTQ literature, books, and authors are essential for promoting diversity, understanding, and empathy. They provide representation and visibility to marginalized voices, address important social and political issues, enrich our cultural landscape, and empower individuals who identify as LGBTQ. As such, they deserve to be celebrated and supported.

Book Banning Activity is Skyrocketing More than half of 2023's most challenged books have LGBTQ themes

The number of books challenged in libraries across the US in 2023 spiked 65% over the previous year, according to the American Library Association. The American Library Association, a nonprofit organization that tracks efforts to ban books nationwide, released a list detailing the 10 most challenged titles of 2023  seven of which deal with LGBTQ themes, according to the group.

Maia Kobabes Gender Queer, a graphic memoir that chronicles the author coming out as nonbinary, topped the list for the third year in a row. The other LGBTQ-themed titles on the list include George M. Johnsons All Boys Arent Blue, Juno Dawsons This Book Is Gay and Mike Curatos Flamer.

In recent years, school districts and state legislatures across the US have been roiled by fierce debates over what reading materials are appropriate for kids and teenagers. The moves to restrict or withdraw books have been driven in part by conservative activist groups such as Moms for Liberty as well as Republican elected officials.

Meanwhile, the American conservative movement has increasingly coalesced around initiatives to curb lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer visibility, including Floridas restrictions on LGBTQ education in public schools and wider efforts to prevent trans athletes from competing in school sports.

In looking at the titles of the most challenged books from last year, its obvious that the pressure groups are targeting books about LGBTQ people and people of color, American Library Association President Emily Drabinski said in a statement accompanying the list.

We are fighting for the freedom to choose what you want to read, Drabinski added. Shining a light on the harmful workings of these pressure groups is one of the actions we must take to protect our right to read.

The American Library Association announced that the number of books challenged in libraries across the US in 2023 spiked 65% over the previous year, reaching the highest level ever documented by the nonprofit organization.

In a report released March 2024, the association said that 4,240 individual book titles were targeted for removal from schools and public libraries  a dramatic uptick from the previous high of 2,571 in 2022.

The most challenged books of 2023  the top five of which all had LGBTQ themes  also included Stephen Chboskys The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Toni Morrisons The Bluest Eye, Ellen Hopkins Tricks, Jesse Andrews Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, Erika Moen and Matthew Nolans Lets Talk About It, and Patricia McCormicks Sold. Three of the titles on the list were not specifically flagged for LGBTQ themes. The Bluest Eye, widely considered a literary classic, drew complaints because it features depictions of rape and incest, according to the library association. It was also claimed to be sexually explicit and flagged for EDI content, an acronym that refers to equity, diversity and inclusion.

The list of challenged books was released just as National Library Week began, an observance co-sponsored by the library association, which was founded in 1876. The library association, which has monitored attempted book bans since 1990, compiles data on challenges from two sources: reports from library professionals and news stories. The association said the 2023 data represents only a snapshot of book censorship, partly because many attempts to challenge books are not formally flagged or covered by the news media.

Each challenge, each demand to censor these books is an attack on our freedom to read, our right to live the life we choose, and an attack on libraries as community institutions that reflect the rich diversity of our nation, said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the associations Office for Intellectual Freedom. When we tolerate censorship, she added, we risk losing all of this.

Georgia Teacher Fired for Reading Gender-Inclusive Book Teacher Katie Rinderle testified that she believes there is nothing inappropriate or sensitive about My Shadow is Purple

After administrators alleged that she violated the districts regulations by reading a book about gender fluidity to her students, a Georgia public school teacher attempted to reverse her dismissal by speaking at a hearing concerning the matter in August 2023.

After teaching for a decade, Katie Rinderle got in trouble in March 2023 after reading My Shadow Is Purple, a picture book for children, to her fifth-grade students at Due West Elementary School in Cobb County, in the Atlanta metroplex. She was eventually fired.

In light of a nationwide conservative assault on LGBTQ-themed books and school lessons, this case has gained considerable attention due to its concern with teachers teaching abilities, the control of school systems over teachers, and whether or not some parents should have a say in the public curriculum. This termination is unrelated to education, Rinderles lawyer argued. It exists to create political scapegoats for the elected leadership of this district. Reading a childrens book to children is not against the law.

Cobb County officials say Rinderle broke school rules by teaching controversial subjects, and parents complained, leading to Rinderles termination. Cobb County is the second-largest school district in Georgia. Introducing the topic of gender identity and gender fluidity into a class of elementary grade students was inappropriate and violated the school district policies, argued the school districts counsel.

But Rinderle disagreed. The fact that Rinderle read the book wasnt wrong, she said, because she found it appropriate and not a sensitive topic. She argued that the book conveys a message to students about their many interests and the desire to be free to choose and explore them all.

Following Georgia Republican lawmakers ban on divisive concepts in the classroom and creating a bill of rights for parents in 2022, Cobb County adopted a rule prohibiting teaching controversial issues. Divisive concepts law prohibits teachers from espousing personal political beliefs. By law, parents have the right to direct the upbringing and the moral or religious training of his or her minor child. According to Georgia law, teachers cannot be fired without cause. Three retired school principals will review Rinderles case and recommend whether to fire or retain her, but ultimately the school board will decide the educators fate.

Essay: Walking and Talking With My Friend Dawn By David Sedaris

Much of Sedaris's humor is ostensibly autobiographical and self-deprecating and often concerns his family life, his middle-class upbringing in the suburbs of Raleigh, North Carolina, his Greek heritage, homosexuality, jobs, education, drug use, and obsessive behaviors, as well as his life in France, London, New York, and the South Downs in England. He is the brother and writing collaborator of actress Amy Sedaris. In 2019, Sedaris was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

Sedaris was born in Johnson City, New York. The Sedaris family moved when David was young, and he grew up in a suburban area of Raleigh, the second oldest child of six. Among his siblings, many people would recognize Amy from film and TV fame and Paul ("the Rooster") whom he mentions in his stand-up comedy routines.

Sedaris briefly attended Western Carolina University before transferring to, and dropping out of, Kent State University in 1977. In his teens and twenties, David dabbled in visual and performance art. He describes his lack of success in several of his essays. He moved to Chicago in 1983, and graduated from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1987.

As of 2019, Sedaris lives in Rackham, West Sussex, England with his longtime partner, painter and set designer Hugh Hamrick. Sedaris mentions Hamrick in a number of his stories, and describes the two of them as the "sort of couple who wouldn't get married."

Poet Mary Oliver

"Instructions for life: Pay attention. Be astonished. Tell about it."

-Mary Oliver

Mary Jane Oliver (1935-2019) was an lesbian American poet who won the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize. Her work is inspired by nature, rather than the human world, stemming from her lifelong passion for solitary walks in the wild. It is characterized by a sincere wonderment at the impact of natural imagery, conveyed in unadorned language. In 2007, she was declared to be the country's best-selling poet.

Mary Oliver was born to Edward William and Helen M. (Vlasak) Oliver in Maple Heights, Ohio, a semi-rural suburb of Cleveland. Her father was a social studies teacher and an athletics coach in the Cleveland public schools. As a child, she spent a great deal of time outside where she enjoyed going on walks or reading. Oliver described her family as dysfunctional, adding that though her childhood was very hard, writing helped her create her own world. Oliver revealed that she had been sexually abused as a child and had experienced recurring nightmares.

Mary Oliver: Lesbian Poet, Mystic of Nature

Oliver began writing poetry at the age of 14. She graduated from the local high school in Maple Heights. In the summer of 1951 at the age of 15 she attended the National Music Camp at Interlochen, Michigan, now known as Interlochen Arts Camp, where she was in the percussion section of the National High School Orchestra. At 17 she visited the home of the late Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Edna St. Vincent Millay, in Austerlitz, New York, where she then formed a friendship with the late poet's sister Norma. Oliver and Norma spent the next six to seven years at the estate organizing Edna St. Vincent Millay's papers.

Oliver studied at The Ohio State University and Vassar College in the mid-1950s, but did not receive a degree at either college.

On a visit to Austerlitz in the late 1950s, Oliver met photographer Molly Malone Cook, who would become her partner for over forty years. In Our World, a book of Cook's photos and journal excerpts Oliver compiled after Cook's death, Oliver writes, "I took one look at Cook and fell, hook and tumble." Cook was Oliver's literary agent. They made their home largely in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where they lived until Cook's death in 2005, and where Oliver continued to live until relocating to Florida.

Oliver valued her privacy and gave very few interviews, saying she preferred for her writing to speak for itself. In 2012, Oliver was diagnosed with lung cancer, but was treated and given a "clean bill of health." Oliver died of lymphoma on January 2019, at the age of 83.

GOP Ramps Up LGBTQ Book Banning Efforts

Republican officials in a number of states have ramped up efforts to ban books with LGBTQ themes from school libraries, along with books that discuss race, and books by women, NPR reported.

Those efforts have been particularly strenuous in Texas, where State Rep. Matt Krause, a "Texas lawmaker running for attorney general, identified a list of 850 books that he says should be questioned; many of those books are written by women, people of color and LGBTQ authors," NPR detailed.

Maia Kobabe's graphic novel memoir "Gender Queer: A Memoir" was targeted by Texas State Rep. Jeff Cason. The state's governor, Greg Abbott, "sent a letter to the state's school board association saying public schools shouldn't have pornographic or obscene material." NPR Abbott did not provide any specific examples of content.

But GOP officials in other states have also increased attacks on books they say are objectionable. In a recent article, The New York Times noted several titles that were yanked from school libraries in various places around the country, including "All Boys Aren't Blue," by gay Black author George M. Johnson and Alison Bechdel's graphic novel "Fun Home," a memoir of her own youth as a lesbian and her relationship with her father, who was closeted. "Gender Queer" was also singled out by Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina, who called the memoir "pornographic."

The book-banning push is "part of a trend of conservative-led fights across the country over how schools can teach about issues of race, particularly systemic racism, as well as sex and gender, blurring the already-faint line between local and national politics," the Houston Chronicle said.

Though critical race theory is taught in colleges, and not in elementary, middle, or high schools, the term has been appropriated to indicate books in general that discuss issues of race in America, news reports said.

Books by writers of color have come under attack, with reports citing two Toni Morrison novels. "The Bluest Eye" and "Beloved" (the latter won the Pulitzer Prize) have faced challenges. The campaign of Glenn Youngkin, the Virginia gubernatorial candidate who defeated incumbent Terry McAuliffe, pointed at "Beloved" as an example of what should not be in schools. Youngkin made education a central plank of his campaign, and his campaign used a decade-old video in which a conservative activist attacks "Beloved" in its advertising.

Two members of a Virginia school board in Spotsylvania County called for books to be not only banned, but burned, NPR noted, quoting representative Rabih Abuismail as saying, "I think we should throw those books in a fire." Fellow school board member Kirk Twigg "said he wants to 'see the books before we burn them so we can identify within our community that we are eradicating this bad stuff,'" NPR added.

However, though critical race theory is loudly decried by Republican officials, it is books with LGBTQ content that the GOP is more focused on eradicating, at least in Texas, the Houston Chronicle said.

Drag Queen Story Time

Local public libraries and bookstores may, from time to time, host drag queen story time (or drag story hour) events. Such activities feature storytellers using the art of drag to read books to kids. It is a very kid-friendly event during which a drag queen generally reads 3-4 children's books, sings children's songs, and leads children in a craft activity such as making crowns, wands, or paper bag puppets, or sometimes other activities like face painting or dress-up time.

Through a fun literary experience, drag story times center on learning and play, encouraging kids to celebrate gender diversity and all kinds of difference, while building confidence in expressing themselves. In spaces like this, kids are able to see people who defy rigid gender restrictions and imagine a world where everyone can be their authentic selves.

Children learn, grow, and mature best when they are playing and having fun. In pre-school and kindergarten, learning looks like play. Kids are the most engaged when they are playing games, singing songs, and expressing themselves in outrageous ways. They enjoy interactive and participatory exercises and they love to be entertained. They are amused by flamboyant, festive, fanciful personalities. They love clowns, jesters, magicians, dancers, musicians, superheroes, princesses ... and drag queens.

What is a drag queen?

Drag is an artistic way of expressing yourself and showing the world who you are or who you want to be. Drag queens are generally male entertainers who often express their feminine sides or different aspects of their gender or personality through dressing up, performing in shows, marching in parades, and volunteering in their communities.

Do drag story time events promote an agenda?

Most librarians and their drag queen guests would say that their only agenda is that people of all ages should be free to express themselves however they want, free from the constraints of prescribed gender roles. Storytime activities teach children that there are many ways to express themselves and their gender, and they are all OK. Drag is an art form that is rooted in diverse LGBTQ communities, and they support equality, justice, and respect for all people. Given that LGBTQ people are present in every community, they believe that children deserve to be exposed to these aspects of our shared history and culture, in age appropriate ways. If there is an agenda, it could be described simply: To encourage diversity, inclusion, acceptance, and respect. To promote empathy, creativity, imagination, and self-expression. To prevent bullying, bigotry, prejudice, homophobia, and transphobia.

DC's New Superman, Jon Kent, Comes Out as Bisexual

The November 2021 Superman: Son of Kal-El, by writer Tom Taylor and artist John Timms, presents Jon Kent as queer. DC Universe's new Superman and the son of Clark Kent, is coming out as bisexual in the new edition of the Superman comic book series.

"I've always said everyone needs heroes and everyone deserves to see themselves in their heroes and Im very grateful DC and Warner Bros. share this idea," Taylor said in a statement to DC. "Superman's symbol has always stood for hope, for truth and for justice. Today, that symbol represents something more. Today, more people can see themselves in the most powerful superhero in comics."

"We couldnt be prouder to tell this important story from Tom Taylor and John Timms," DC Publisher and Chief Creative Officer Jim Lee said. "We talk a lot about the power of the DC Multiverse in our storytelling and this is another incredible example. We can have Jon Kent exploring his identity in the comics as well as Jon Kent learning the secrets of his family on TV on Superman & Lois. They coexist in their own worlds and times, and our fans get to enjoy both simultaneously."

Jon Kent was created by Dan Jurgens and debuted in 2015's Convergence. The character is the son of Clark Kent and Lois Lane, and in the DC Rebirth era, he took up the mantle of Superboy. Several years later, he was aged up and became a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, and in April 2021, it was announced that he'd take over as Superman with Superman: Son of Kal-El.
