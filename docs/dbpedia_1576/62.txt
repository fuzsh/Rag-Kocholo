“As a child, I listened to the stories of my ancestors and their migration to America. They escaped persecution and poverty and hoped to find freedom and opportunity in our great country. I was motivated to volunteer to support the asylum seekers as a way to honor those stories. It is a way to return the kindness shown to my family, I close my eyes and see my grandfather’s smiling face when I extend my hand to help.”

“For me, this work is at the heart of being a human. The plight of the refugee, of the asylum seeker, so deeply heartbreaking to me as a human, and also as a Jew. The stories call to me–the stories of people who have been forced to say goodbye to everything they ever knew in order to survive, of people who arrive in a place they do not know, of people who have nothing but what they could carry, people who have lost everything. Their stories break my heart open and compel me to help. I am proud to be part of a community that is doing so much to help those in need.”

Cantor Shayna De Lowe

“We are honored to be a part of a congregation that has extended open arms to our community beyond the walls of our synagogue. We are helping asylum seekers because so many refugees are fleeing countries because they don’t have the right to worship, to vote and support their own candidates, or to educate themselves because of their gender. Many simply can’t afford to live where work is limited. We are privileged in our free choices and resources but we must never take them for granted. Supporting refugees seeking asylum reminds me of my own blessings every day and the importance of helping those less fortunate who risk everything to start over in our country.”

Jill Temkin & Carol Kurtz

“I volunteer to help asylum seekers to do my part in Tikkun Olam. Asylum seekers are the bravest, kindest and most grateful people you’ll ever meet. Their determination to make a better life for themselves and their families inspires me like nothing else can. I also love surrounding myself with people who HELP asylum seekers and am equally inspired by their generosity. “

Val Coleman

“Supporting asylum seekers appealed to us as we had been thinking about how to be involved and best help. With our family’s history as immigrants fleeing persecution and given Abraham’s upbringing in Mexico, we hoped our experience would be helpful in reaching out to and interfacing with the families.”

Jennifer Chu & Abraham Bleiberg

“When we learned that Congregation Rodeph Shalom would be connecting congregants with asylum-seeking families from Venezuela we knew that we would volunteer and that we had chosen the right Congregation for our family.

We look forward to meeting with Mariangel and Fabiana – it is the highlight of our weekend. We are always amazed at how much English they have learned from week to week and we are thankful they are patient with our Spanish!

Knowing them is a joy and being part of their American story is an honor.”

“After the 2016 Presidential election, we became concerned with the direction the country, particularly the new administration, was taking with respect to immigrants in general and asylum seekers in particular. We thought our skills as lawyers could be useful although we had no experience in this complicated area of the law. We heard that the Immigration Justice Campaign was seeking pro bono lawyers to represent asylum seekers, and we volunteered. We were provided hours of training and the on-call mentoring assistance of an experienced immigration attorney. With this support, we successfully represented five asylum seekers and Henry represented two more. We obtained either asylum or the right to remain in the US for all seven and are now helping John Harry, CRS’s Venezuelan refugee in his quest for asylum for himself and his family.”

Helen & Henry Freedman

“I volunteered to participate with the refugee resettlement committee at Rodeph Sholom and then, when asked, agreed to chair the committee with Janie Roher. My motivations were simple: there but for the grace of God go I. My grandparents fled Russia in the early part of the 20th century for the United States and were it not for the support from both their relatives already in the US and the Jewish community, their life in the United States would have been much more difficult and challenging. And so, I was merely “paying it forward.” And in return for providing support to 4 young men from Pakistan I learned so much about their lives, community and religion. I know they came to respect and appreciate the Jewish community that opened itself to them.”

“I decided to help the asylum seekers because my parsha for my b’nai mitzvah made me think about how hard it was for the Israelites when they were crossing the desert, even though they were finally free, they struggled so much. This made the connection to asylum seekers also struggling with their journey to the United States. They arrive and are free but have no money, food, or shelter. I am thankful that my family and friends supported me in raising money to support the asylum seekers. I am hoping to be able to work more directly with them soon.”

“Rodeph Sholom taught me that social consciousness and whatever small action one person takes can have a great impact on the lives of others. When our former US President all but closed the doors to immigrants, I felt strongly that CRS should, and could, do something to counter his closed-door policy. With the approval of the Board, the partnership of HIAS, the outpouring of support from our congregants, and the clear-headed energy of a co-chair – Claudia Wagner – we welcomed four young men from Pakistan. We housed them, clothed them, supported their job-hunting – again with help from the congregation – and launched their lives here in the US. They are now independent, happy to have learned about our community, and eager to become US citizens. I would not have attempted to help had I not been a member of CRS and watched over many years how this community has “walked the walk.””

Janie Rohrer

“When I heard that the synagogue was organizing efforts to help immigrants from Venezuela, I had no doubt that I SHOULD help. After all, we were wandering Jews; our history is defined by immigration. I am an immigrant myself, and while I came to the US with all the comforts imaginable, I know first-hand how hard being in a new country could be. So, I had to do it, even to help alleviate the human tragedy that Venezuela has become.”

“For me, the work is very personal. Both of my parents were Holocaust survivors. Only sixteen when the War began, they arrived in the US without any money, unable to speak English, lacking high school degrees, and were filled with extraordinarily traumatic memories. They found work in a factory and slowly began to build a life together. Memories of food insecurity would haunt them for the rest of their lives.

I believe strongly that our country, founded by refugees from religious persecution, should always welcome asylum seekers. The political, economic and social conditions in the countries which today’s refugees flee are atrocious.

I am so proud to belong to a community that embraces the stranger, which has never hesitated to step up and offer assistance so that today’s new arrivals will have the same opportunity my parents had to establish a new life in a new land.”

Annette Orenstein

“My motivation to volunteer stems from several places: compassion and concern for the plight of refugees; the story of my family’s ancestors; and the Torah teaches us to welcome the stranger. Since my involvement with the refugee program at CRS, I have found the experience personally rewarding.

The stories of refugees who risk their lives and separation from family to escape intolerable situations in the hope of beginning a new life are truly remarkable. Their hardships echo my own family history from Russia; my paternal great-grandparents emigrated in the mid-1800s and my maternal grandparents in the early 1900s. They arrived with very little yet they shared the same strong aspiration for a better and safer life.

The young men we helped through the CRS/HIAS program emigrated alone from Pakistan. Well-educated in their home country, several in pre-med and pre-engineering studies, they chose a quicker road to financial independence in the U.S. in order to send money back to their families and to work towards citizenship. In less than five years since their arrival in NYC, they are now dispersed across the country. Three of the four are long-haul truck drivers, two have married hometown sweethearts, one is a new father, and they hope to arrange for family members to immigrate to the U.S. to join them.

Despite the horrific conditions of their escape from Pakistan and internments prior to arriving in this country, it has been gratifying to know that we have been instrumental in helping them get on their feet. It is also heart-warming to see these young men grow and become self-sufficient, hardworking contributors to our society. We need more like them. Their gratitude for the fresh start and appreciation for the volunteer assistance has been undeniable. Their perspectives on personal freedom and opportunity are incredibly refreshing and the hunger to succeed can be so much greater for those who have experienced adversity.

I can’t help but ponder if the refugees and migrants arriving today, who left behind very oppressed circumstances, have it harder than generations before. Although my ancestors traveled to this country in steerage, they did arrive with a suitcase and with each other. Many today come with even less. Helping this new wave of migrants seeking asylum in the U.S., whether preparing a hot meal, providing clothes, or coordinating donations, is a basic but essential way to welcome the stranger in our community.”

“In the Torah (Genesis and Exodus), “Hineni” appears eight times, and in the Hebrew Scriptures (adding in Samuel and Isaiah), it appears seventeen times. It is not only how God answers Isaiah in Isaiah 58, but also how humans like Abraham and Moses answer God in the Bible, as well. While trying to figure out why this phrase has always resonated with me, I stumbled upon a passage by Avital Snow who writes, “What makes ‘hineni’ such a powerful statement? It is an offer of complete availability, of total readiness to serve. When we utter ‘hineni,’ we make ourselves fully available to whatever it is God might ask of us. Even without knowing what that might be. The answer of ‘hineni’ is one of faith.” For me, it’s that and more: It’s making myself as fully available as I am able, to whomever it is who might need me.

At the end of the summer of 2022, I heard that busloads of asylum seekers were being sent from Texas to New York City. I had followed the border crisis for years and I knew injustices were happening all the time. But it wasn’t until I went to Port Authority and witnessed people – adults, children, families – coming off the busses with nothing at all, that I saw the injustices with my own eyes and knew that I wanted to step in to help repair the breach. There are many wonderful organizations providing food, shelter, and clothing. What I quickly realized was that many people need much more than material support. LGBTQIA+ community members need an accepting person to speak to about where they can safely seek shelter; undocumented people need someone to listen to them as they speak about their fears of arriving without a single document proving their identity; those who are bullied in their shelters need help navigating the system to try to file a complaint and//or be transferred; unaccompanied minors need help finding a safe place to stay; pregnant women need help finding a doctor and help getting to their appointments; and most need a smile, a hug and an advocate to help navigate the multitude of barriers and injustices migrants with no money and no ability to legally work face while trying to survive in our incredible sanctuary city. I have chosen to help repair the breach by showing up for some of NYC’s most vulnerable people by living out the words I have heard my whole life – “Hineni! Here I Am.”

Throughout my most recent advocacy journey, I have been inspired by my supportive family and by many other people I love and respect – both new friends and old. From fellow advocates and volunteers to clergy and to my many new friends who have come here seeking safety, I have been challenged and energized in my quest to help those who need us most and to block out the voices of those who want to widen the breach. I hope that during this important season, we can all listen to Isaiah and to not only fast, but to fast with intention. Instead of spending 40 days giving up something that feels hard, remember during and after the 40 days, to say, “Here I Am.” How can I help repair the breach and bring justice to everyone, every day.”
