        "text": "Located not far to the east of Independence Monument along Sihanouk Boulevard in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh, is a monument to commemorate the late King Norodom Sihanouk (from who the road takes its name). Norodom Sihanouk Monument is testament to the Cambodian people’s affection for their late king.\n\nNorodom Sihanouk\n\nBuilt in 2013, the monument serves as a memorial to the life of the much-loved former King of Cambodia, Norodom Sihanouk.\n\nSihanouk was born on October 31, 1922 in Phnom Penh, and died 90 years later on October 15, 2012. In many respects, he is seen as the father of the country, with the official title of Samdech Euv, or King’s Father. He was king from April 24, 1941 to March 2, 1955, and subsequently September 24, 1993 to October 7, 2004, when he was succeeded by his eldest son Norodom Sihamoni, who is the current monarch of Cambodia.\n\nSihanouk also served as Chief of State of Cambodia in the 1960s, as well as President of the State Presidium briefly between 1975 and 1976. In addition to being king, he produced, directed and acted in 50 films.\n\nMemorial to a Beloved King\n\nThe memorial itself is just as popular with Cambodian visitors as it is with international tourists, and people can often be spotted snapping pictures at all times of day.\n\nThe park, which surrounds the monument, is also a popular place during the cooler early morning or evening hours for people to gather outside and exercise.\n\nAs with all Cambodian monuments, this is a place of respect and national history, and should be treated accordingly.\n\nWhere is Norodom Sihanouk Monument?\n\nThe monument lies on Sihanouk Boulevard, close to Independence Monument.\n\nNearby Attractions"
