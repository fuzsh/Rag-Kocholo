        "text": "For more than sixty years, Cambodia has been personified by Norodom Sihanouk. Throughout his life, he has played roles as King, Prime Minister, Prince, Head of State for Life, Exile, and Prisoner. THE NINE LIVES OF NORODOM SIHANOUK chronicles his remarkable life story, which is inextricable from the modern history of Cambodia.\n\nAppointed King in 1941, when the nation was still part of French Indochina, Sihanouk helped win the country's independence in 1953, and played capitalist and communist superpowers off one another during Cambodia's golden age of neutrality.\n\nDuring the Sixties, however, Sihanouk increasingly became victim of international pressures. The Vietnam War spilled over Cambodia's borders, leading to a civil war, a coup d'etat, and Sihanouk's misbegotten alliance with Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge. Following years of exile, Sihanouk returned to Cambodia in 1991, regaining his title as King.\n\nUsing archival footage and contemporary interviews with Sihanouk's former colleagues and political opponents, eyewitnesses, journalists and historians, including Jean Lacouture, David Chandler, Patrice De Beer, Jacques Bekaert, and John Gunther Dean, former U.S. Ambassador to Cambodia, THE NINE LIVES OF NORODOM SIHANOUK tells the story of this controversial political leader whose country became the \"killing fields\" for one of the greatest human tragedies of the 20th century."
