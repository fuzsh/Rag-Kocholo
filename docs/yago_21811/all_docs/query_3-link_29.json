        "text": "King Norodom Sihanouk, renowned as one of Southeast Asia's most prolific film producers, has decided to end his association with the industry.\n\nThe king announced the end of 50 years behind the cameras in a letter to the French magazine Le Point.\n\nKing Sihanouk, 74, who has survived a coup d'etat, a palace arrest at the hands of the Khmer Rouge and a civil war, has been been setting Cambodian scenes to celluloid since the mid-1940s.\n\nHe has produced more than 20 feature films.\n\nThe king said he had alway been inspired by the classics of the 1940s, and quoted Gone With The Wind as his favourite movie.\n\nBut in a curious rejoinder, the palace yesterday denied King Sihanouk's film-making career was over, saying they believed the statement was the only way that the publicity-shy king could close the door on journalists requesting interviews.\n\nReporters have known for years that to receive a royal audience they had to request an interview on his film-making rather than his political profile.\n\nA close aide to the king said: 'In his letter to Le Point he used the phrase 'I stop producing films' in the present tense. This means that he could start producing tomorrow or next year again.' And a quote in Le Point perhaps gives credence to the palace's beliefs. 'With regard to my cinematography, I . . . do not want to talk about it any longer,' the king said.\n\nThe aide said King Sihanouk had not yet finished producing The Big Assassination, a film based on his overthrow in 1970.\n\nThe ageing King Sihanouk had only a limited time for film-making, the aide added.\n\n'He has so many things to do now . . . he distributes humanitarian aid to Cambodia's poor almost every day.' Meanwhile, in another counterpoint to the royal statement in Le Point, an interview in Cambodia's current in-flight magazine featuring the king says he 'is in the process of planning another fiction film', but does not know when he will be able to shoot it.\n\nCambodia can only wait and see."
