        "text": "Cinema of Cambodia refers to the films made within Cambodia, or by Cambodian directors. It began in the 1950s, and many films were being screened in theaters throughout the country by the 1960s, which are regarded as the \"golden age\". After a decline during the Khmer Rouge regime, competition from video and television has meant that the Cambodian film industry is a small one.\n\nAs early as the 1920s, documentary films were shot in Cambodia by foreign filmmakers. By the 1930s, King Norodom Sihanouk had a desire for films and dreamed of stardom before the French chose him to be king. Even after his selection, he kept in mind the idea of acting or directing. The first Cambodian-made films were made in the 1950s by filmmakers who had studied overseas. In the 1960s, several production companies were started and more movie theaters were built throughout the country. This was the \"golden age\" of Cambodian cinema, when more than 300 movies were made. Some Cambodian films were released abroad. and during the 1970s they were well received internationally.\n\nThe industry's decline began in late 1974, when the fall of Phnom Penh to the Khmer Rouge was imminent. After the Khmer Rouge takeover, the cities were depopulated and film audiences shrank. The Khmer Rouge itself made some propaganda films to screen at collective meetings, and diplomatic visits were recorded on film. With the invasion of Cambodia by Vietnam, the fall of the Khmer Rouge and the installation of the Vietnam-backed government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea, movie houses in Phnom Penh were re-opened, but there was no domestic film industry, because many filmmakers and actors from the 1960s and 1970s had been killed by the Khmer Rouge or had fled the country. Cambodia's film industry began a slow comeback and by the 1990's, hundreds of local Cambodian movies were released every year.\n\nBest International Feature Film Nominations[]"
