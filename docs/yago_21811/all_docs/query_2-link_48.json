        "text": "Norodom Sihamoni (born May 14, 1953, Phnom Penh, Cambodia) is the king of Cambodia who succeeded his father, King Norodom Sihanouk, in October 2004 after Sihanouk abdicated the throne.\n\nSihamoni was the elder of Sihanouk’s two sons with his last queen, Monineath. At the time of Sihamoni’s birth, Cambodia was becoming independent of France (which until then had maintained a protectorate over Cambodia). However, the new country was in the middle of a protracted period of warfare and unrest in the region (the Indochina wars), and Sihamoni spent much of his life outside the country.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz\n\nFrom an early age Sihamoni showed an aptitude for the arts. He went to study in Czechoslovakia when he was 9, and at age 14 he starred in The Little Prince, a film made by his father. After Sihanouk was deposed from power in a 1970 coup, Sihamoni remained in Prague (now in the Czech Republic), where he attended the National Conservatory and the Academy of Music Arts, concentrating on dance, music, and theatre. In 1975 he joined his father in North Korea and began film school there. He followed his parents and returned to Cambodia during the totalitarian Khmer Rouge regime (1975–79) of Pol Pot, and after 1976 he resided with his parents under house arrest in the palace at Phnom Penh. Several of Sihamoni’s half-brothers and half-sisters, living elsewhere in the country, died during that period.\n\nAfter the fall of Pol Pot, the family was evacuated to China, where Sihamoni served as his father’s secretary for two years. In 1981 he moved to Paris, where he became a professor of classical dance and formed his own dance troupe, called Ballet Deva. He choreographed some of the troupe’s performances and also made two films with a dance focus. In 1992 he was named permanent representative of Cambodia to the United Nations. In 1993, the year his father was recrowned king, Sihamoni became Cambodia’s permanent representative to UNESCO, a position he held until 2004."
