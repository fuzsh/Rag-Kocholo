        "text": "Cambodia is best known to the West through the ancient temples of Angkor Wat near Siem Reap, and the torture and execution centre Tuol Sleng in Phnom Penh. Few know that this country once produced a wild escapist cinema which grew, flourished and disappeared in the space of little more than a decade. This book chapter discusses cinema in Cambodia during its 1960s 'golden age' and the nature of stardom in that era.It was a cinema where stars could shine, but the basic structures familiar from Hollywood were subverted by Khmer popular culture and the unique moment of modernity during which this cinema arose. The great stars of Cambodian cinema embodied special qualities which came from their own charisma and skills. However, we also recognise them as spectres, ghostly reminders of a past gone but not forgotten. These stars live on in memorial fragments, bearing a tragic load through the knowledge of their fate. Today a resurgent interest in Cambodian golden age cinema is apparent, with re-releases and recovery of many of these treasured films."
