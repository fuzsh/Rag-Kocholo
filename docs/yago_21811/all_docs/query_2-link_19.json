        "text": "Norodom Sihanouk, born Oct. 31, 1922, was a charismatic figure in Cambodian politics. In many ways he was larger than life: He took six wives and concubines and fathered at least 14 children in 11 years; he was fascinated with films and became a film director, producer, cameraman and actor; and he played the saxophone well. The French plucked him from down the line of succession and put him on Cambodia's throne in 1941, mistakenly thinking he would be easy to control. But the young king agitated for Cambodia's independence, eventually gaining the support of the U.S., Canada and Japan, among others. France finally relented, granting Cambodia independence on Nov. 9, 1953.\n\nIn 1955 Sihanouk abdicated in favor of his father so he could enter politics and become prime minister. When his father died in 1960, Sihanouk again became head of state, with the title of prince.\n\nI met Norodom Sihanouk when I visited Phnom Penh in 1967, and later I twice visited Angkor Wat in Siem Reap, where the ruins bear witness to a once great civilization. Both times he generously requested that I use his residence at Siem Reap as my base, with all the residence's services at my disposal.\n\nIn 1965 Sihanouk made a pact with China and North Vietnam that allowed North Vietnam to establish bases in Cambodia and China to send military supplies to Vietnam through Cambodia's ports. This, combined with the severe political repression unleashed in 1966-67, set the stage for civil war. In 1970, when Sihanouk was on a visit to Moscow, General Lon Nol staged a successful coup. Sihanouk sought refuge in China and set up a government-in-exile. Lon Nol, however, was unable to stop the North Vietnamese from using Cambodian territory to infiltrate and attack South Vietnam. This caused U.S. forces, in defense of South Vietnam, to regularly bomb the border.\n\nIn 1975 the Khmer Rouge, whose goal was to demolish Cambodian society and rebuild it from scratch, overthrew Lon Nol. The Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot, in his ideological madness, destroyed the Cambodian intelligentsia and killed more than 1 million people in what came to be known as the killing fields. Ieng Sary, Khmer Rouge foreign minister of Democratic Kampuchea, came to Singapore and explained that they were going to build a new society, one not corrupted or influenced by French colonialism.\n\nOnce the Khmer Rouge took over, Prince Sihanouk returned to Cambodia as the symbolic head of state. But it wasn't long before he was placed under house arrest. During this time many members of the Sihanouk family were killed or deported.\n\nFollowing the Vietnam War, North Vietnam signed a mutual defense pact with the Soviet Union, hoping it would be protected when it embarked on the annexation of Cambodia and Laos. Deng Xiaoping, China's supreme leader, wasn't about to let this happen. He visited Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore and in November 1978 told me to expect a response from China if Vietnam embarked on such an invasion. He said China didn't want a Soviet \"Cuba\" in Southeast Asia. When the Vietnamese invaded Cambodia that December and seized control of Phnom Penh in early 1979, China crushed and punished the provinces of North Vietnam just across its border and put paid to their wider ambitions.\n\nSihanouk was sent by the Khmer Rouge to speak at the UN in its defense and against the Vietnamese invasion. But while in New York he planned his escape, fleeing after his UN speech and seeking refuge in China and North Korea.\n\nIn 1993, following UN-sponsored elections, Cambodia's National Assembly voted to restore the monarchy, and Sihanouk was reinstated as king. But in October 2004, citing poor health, Sihanouk abdicated. The government proclaimed him His Majesty the King-Father of Cambodia. He lived the rest of his life in Pyongyang and Beijing, returning to Phnom Penh to celebrate his 89th birthday with a last public appearance in October 2011.\n\nSihanouk died 16 days shy of 90, having spent most of his life in service to his country and people."
