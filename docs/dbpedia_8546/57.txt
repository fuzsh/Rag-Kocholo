Actor Robert Vaughn, best known for playing Napoleon Solo on the NBC spy drama "The Man From U.N.C.L.E.," died surrounded by his family after battling acute leukemia, his manager Mathew Sullivan tells FOX411.

He was 83.

"Mr. Vaughn passed away at 7:30 this morning," Sullivan said, calling Vaughn "a great human being and a great actor."

"The Man from U.N.C.L.E." aired from 1964-68 and made Vaughn one of TV's biggest stars.

Before moving to the small screen, Vaughn got his start in the movies as an extra on "The Ten Commandments" in 1956. Three years later he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for "The Young Philadelphians," and played a gunman in the classic 1960 film "The Magnificent Seven."
