Deadline reports that Vaughn died on Friday after a brief battle with leukemia. He was 83.\n\nVaughn played suave spy Napoleon Solo, a sort of American James Bond, on NBC's The Man From U.N.C.L.E. from 1964 to 1968. The series ran for four seasons and spawned a spin-off, The Girl from U.N.C.L.E., and a 1983 TV movie Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.\n\nHe won an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in 1978 for the miniseries Washington: Behind Closed Doors. Other memorable TV roles include General Hunt Stockwell, the antagonist of the fifth season of The A-Team, and an angry audience member on Late Night With Conan O'Brienwith the catchphrase \"you people make me sick.\"\n\nHis movie career began in 1956 as an extra in The Ten Commandments; by 1959 he was an Oscar nominee for his role in The Young Philadelphians. He also appeared in Bullitt, Superman IIIand Pootie Tang, among many other films.\n\nStars we've lost in 2016\n\nVaughn was born Nov. 22, 1932 in New York City and grew up primarily in Minneapolis. A lifelong Democrat, he was an early opponent of the Vietnam War and was active in Hollywood antiwar activism.
