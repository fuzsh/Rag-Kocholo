        "text": "You Can't Take It With You won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. It's the \"classic screwball comedy that pits the eccentric Sycamore family — prone to spontaneous eruptions of music, dance poetry and fireworks — against the buttoned-up bigwigs of Wall Street and the IRS,\" according to Geva. \"When Alice Sycamore agrees to marry the son of ultra-conservative parents, will true love win out?\"\n\nGeva artistic director Mark Cuddy will direct. Additional casting will be announced.\n\nVaughn might be best known to television viewers for his portrayal of Napoleon Solo in \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" He was Oscar-nominated for his work in \"The Young Philadelphians.\" His movie credits include \"Bullitt,\" \"The Towering Inferno,\" \"Superman III,\" \"The Magnificent Seven\" and more. He won an Emmy for his portrayal of a presidential henchman in the TV mini-series \"Washington: Behind Closed Doors,\" and was nominated for his portrayal of Woodrow Wilson in the miniseries \"Backstairs at the White House.\"\n\nVaughn began his stage career at the age of 12 in the Famous Players tent shows in Iowa. He later became the resident director and leading man at the Albuquerque and Santa Fe Summerhouse Theaters in New Mexico, the Tustin Playbox in California and the Los Angeles Stage Society. He appeared on Broadway in Love Letters with Polly Bergen.\n\nFor more information, visit gevatheatre.org. *\n\nFounded in 1972, Geva Theatre Center is a not-for-profit, professional theatre company dedicated to creating and producing professional theatre productions, programs and services of a national standard.
