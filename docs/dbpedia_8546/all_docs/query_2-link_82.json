        "text": "A surprise to everyone but me.\n\nThe current show at Circle in the Square is CHICKEN & BISCUITS. And it’s a big success. Here’s what so surprising about it to the Broadway community:\n\nIt’s a comedy.\n\nGod forbid!\n\nAnd not just a comedy — a conventional comedy.\n\nKind of a familiar plot — relatives fighting after a funeral. But apparently it’s funny.\n\nBlasphemy!\n\nWhile every other play on the Great White Way is heavy, experimental, and “important,” audiences are turning to a show where they can laugh.\n\nAs disturbing as this concept might be, people occasionally want to go to the theatre to enjoy themselves.\n\nThey don’t always want to be challenged, to be lectured, to be made to feel guilty.\n\nWhat really surprises me is how this is always a surprise to Broadway. For every THE PLAY THAT GOES WRONG there are five award-winning OSLO’S that close. They named a theatre for Neil Simon yet don’t seem to remember what his contribution was.\n\nThe big issue in theatre this year of course is diversity. And that’s fine. But that shouldn’t dictate subject matter and genre. Douglas Lyons, the playwright of CHICKEN & BISCUITS is Black. So what? People are going because they want to be entertained. And Lyons delivers the goods.\n\nI congratulate everyone involved in the production of CHICKEN & BISCUITS for taking the daring courageous step of staging an actual show that people want to see.\n\nSince we seem to be on a nostalgia kick following this weekend's post...\n\nThe remake of classic game shows is a current network trend. And they try desperately to be funny. As a result they are so forced and for my money, mostly unwatchable. When ABC has to rely on Anthony Anderson's mother for laughs you know we've reached rock bottom.\n\nSome of the original game shows elicited laughs, but usually they came out of the double meanings of certain questions and answers. They weren't desperate quips by celebrity guest stars. And unlike today, these shows were done live. Bloopers and unexpected moments were part of the fun. I'm sure the current prime-time game shows are edited to death in order to eke out a semblance of actual entertainment.\n\nHere is an example of a classic game from the 1950's. It's called WHAT'S MY LINE? Four panelists have to guess the occupation of the guest. So the occupations tend to be somewhat unusual to better stump the panel. Part of the charm (and bonus humor) of the show is John Daly, the moderator. His attempts to clarify points are so long-winded and precise that he forever confuses everybody.\n\nEnjoy a segment from WHAT'S MY LINE? Remember, this was 1958. I don't want any \"This is inappropriate and offensive\" comments. No one was offended then.\n\nHalfway through the month. Here are some Friday Questions for your Halloween shopping weekend.\n\nOwlchum gets us rolling.\n\nYou'll read every once in a while about actors who are so in tune with their characters that they will decline to do a line or a scene stating their characters wouldn't say/do that. I'm curious if you've had that problem in the writing room i.e. a scribe who felt so possessive about a character that he/she actually became too disruptive in finishing script(s)?\n\nYes, it happens, but let me say this. Fighting for your script to the point of being disruptive is the fastest way to get yourself fired off a staff.\n\nHere’s the thing: You’re not going to win.\n\nThe showrunner is not going to put back your material because you put on a full court press. So you lose the battle and lose the war when you’re out of a job.\n\nAnd it doesn’t matter if you’re right. It’s not your call.\n\nSuck it up. That’s part of being a professional. It's happened to all of us. Multiple times.\n\nThe showrunner points the boat and you all row in that direction. Someday if you pay your dues you might be the showrunner and you change other writers’ scripts at will. But for now, don’t jeopardize your job, reputation, and career.\n\nPhilly Cinephile wonders:\n\nHow far in advance do you write your blog posts? Is every post \"written to order\" or do you have a cache of essays that you can pull from if you're short on time?\n\nBoth. I try to have some posts prepared in advance to lesson the burden of constant deadlines. But I also love the immediacy of something happening one day, being able to write about it, and having it post the next day.\n\nFriday Questions I usually prepare in advance.\n\nI probably shouldn't divulge these closely guarded secrets, but what the hell?\n\nJeff asks:\n\nKen, do you get personally annoyed when you watch modern shows and the credits list half the cast as a \"producer\" or \"executive producer\"? Are you worried these stars and their agents will next push for writing credits?\n\nYou need to write a script to get writing credit. And if you’re a staff member rewriting a script it’s harder to get shared credit. This is to prevent people in power from arbitrarily piggy-backing their name on writing credits.\n\nAs for number of producers, I don’t mind at all if they’re writers. More producers mean more working writers. And you move up in pay grade as your title improves. So more power to ‘em.\n\nHowever, I don’t like all the non-writing producer credits. “Pod” producers who basically do nothing, managers, and stars. These are all vanity positions that eat into the showrunner/creator’s potential profit in success, and are often sources of obstruction. They’re the partners you don’t need.\n\nAnd finally, from marka:\n\nI was watching an unnamed movie which was fantastic until the end, which seemed slapped together. It seems to be a thing where someone has a great idea, develops the story really well but then has some disappointing conclusion. Like they just can't figure out how to end the darn thing. Could you comment on this? It doesn't happen all the time, but more than it should it seems.\n\nMost studio films have preview screenings, and if the audience doesn’t like the ending, or the studio feels it’s too much of a downer, whatever — the filmmaker will often scramble to quickly come up with a new ending and shoot it. So it becomes a mad scramble with other factors that must be worked out. Which actors are available for re-shoots? Which sets are still up? How much will it cost? How much will we have to cut from the existing film which led to the ending you’re throwing out? How much time do you have? When is the release date?\n\nMore often than not what you end up with are band-aids and endings that are “better” in that they address the audience’s concern, but not really “good.”\n\nWhat’s your Friday Question?\n\nThis is from a Variety article that really made me laugh. Here's the full article.\n\nIt's about Andrew Lloyd Webber. And here's the part I loved:\n\nAlan Parker’s 1996 version of “Evita,” he concludes, was the best of the lot and that’s due to Madonna’s performance. “To this day, I don’t think anybody else could have done it better,” he says.\n\nAnd then there’s “Cats,” which hit theaters in 2019 and was a cinematic bomb that launched a thousand memes, one that was excoriated by critics and ignored by the public. Lloyd Webber says the source material was sold to Amblin, which after trying to turn it into a Steven Spielberg-directed animated feature, eventually handed the reins to Tom Hooper, who had helmed “Les Misérables” and “The King’s Speech.” That proved to be a disastrous decision, according to the composer.\n\n“‘Cats’ was off-the-scale all wrong,” says Lloyd Webber. “There wasn’t really any understanding of why the music ticked at all. I saw it and I just thought, ‘Oh, God, no.’ It was the first time in my 70-odd years on this planet that I went out and bought a dog. So the one good thing to come out of it is my little Havanese puppy.”\n\nThat puppy has been a constant companion of Lloyd Webber’s during lockdown. They have grown so attached that he’s even figured out a way to bring the dog to New York the next time he travels to the city.\n\n“I wrote off and said I needed him with me at all times because I’m emotionally damaged and I must have this therapy dog,” says Lloyd Webber. “The airline wrote back and said, ‘Can you prove that you really need him?’ And I said ‘Yes, just see what Hollywood did to my musical “Cats.”’ Then the approval came back with a note saying, ‘No doctor’s report required.’”\n\nCharlie Hauck was a terrific comedy writer (FRASIER, MAUDE, etc.) and a hilarious author. Sadly, he passed away this year.\n\nH is comic novel about a writing team launching a sitcom starring the diva from hell is both hilarious and all-too-real. The book is called ARTISTIC DIFFERENCES and well worth reading.\n\nOn one page he explains how you can tell a bad sitcom. Simple rules, worth repeating here.\n\n1. Any show in which any character at any time during the life of the series says the words “Ta da!” is a bad sitcom.\n\n2. Any show in which one character says to another, “What are friends for?” is a bad sitcom.\n\n3. Any show in which a character says “Bingo!” in the sense of “Eureka!” is a bad sitcom.\n\n4. Any show in which an actor or actress under the age of seven says cute things in close-up is a bad sitcom.\n\n5. Any show in which an actor or actress over the age of seventy-five says vulgar things in close-up is a bad sitcom.\n\n6. Any show that resorts to the use of Dr. Zarkov dialogue (named for the villain in the FLASH GORGON series, where one character tells another character something they both already know, for the benefit of the audience) is a bad sitcom.\n\n7. Any show in which a character, in the closing minutes, says, “I guess we’ve all learned a lesson,” and then goes on to explain what that lesson is, is a bad sitcom.\n\nAnd if I may add a few of my own:\n\n8. Any show where the studio audience says “Awwwwww” and the producers leave it in is a bad sitcom.\n\n9. Any show that makes a Willard Scott joke is a bad sitcom.\n\n10. Any show with opening titles that show close-ups of the cast and then freeze frames to catch zany expression on each is a bad sitcom.\n\n11. Any show with Jim Belushi is a bad sitcom.\n\nUPDATE: Getting a number of commenters fact checking minor points and pointing out exceptions. I invite you to focus on the spirit and gist of the post instead. There are always exceptions to everything. I don't quite understand this need to dispute any opinion someone might have. Yes, there are exceptions. But you write a spec script trying to break into the industry and ignore these points and see how well you do. And then defend your rejected script by pointing out the exceptions.\n\nBARNEY MILLER is one of those forgotten gem sitcoms from the 70s. I guess because they were taped and now look like crap you rarely see them pop up in reruns. Set in a detectives’ squad room in an NYPD precinct, BARNEY MILLER was a quirky character comedy revolving around the detectives and the nutcases that walked through their door (most in handcuffs).\n\nIt was created by Danny Arnold who was a true character. Brilliant, unpredictable (a nice term for bi-polar), demanding, and kind, Danny was an A-list show runner and a type-A+ personally. The man had a heart attack on the treadmill in his doctor’s office getting his heart checked. He had an oxygen tent installed on the BARNEY set so he could keep going during demanding shooting nights (which lasted routinely until 5 in the morning because of all the pick-ups he wanted). The results were fabulous but what a cost.\n\nWhen David and I were starting out BARNEY MILLER was just starting to take off. It was one of the show we really wanted to write for. We had sold a couple of things and were making the freelance rounds. Our agent called with the good news that Danny had read our material and loved it. He wanted a meeting.\n\nThat meeting was one of the best EVER. We walked into his office and there was the nicest, most ebullient cigar-chomping uncle you’ve ever met. He was effusive in his praise. We couldn’t have been more excited. It was like the prettiest girl in school let you eat at her lunch table.\n\nHe invited us to come back with some story ideas and very much looked forward to working with us. A week later we were back in his office with our notions.\n\nI noticed a bit of change right at the start. He was a little more gruff. Probably just the result of a long day. We started pitching and every idea was met with, “NO!!” “FUCK! ARE YOU KIDDING?” “JESUS, HAVE YOU EVER WATCHED OUR SHOW?” Needless to say we were shaken. After he had rejected all of them we started out and just before getting to the door he said, almost as an afterthought, “That Yamada gambling thing. I don’t think there’s anything there but if you want to develop it more you can.” Not exactly a sale.\n\nBut we went home and decided to develop it anyway. We wanted to show him that if nothing else we weren’t intimidated by him… although we sure as hell were.\n\nWe turned in an outline. He bought it. Had us in for notes and was very complimentary. We implemented his changes and turned in the revised outline.\n\nHe cut us off.\n\nWell, we figured, so much for BARNEY MILLER. At least we got outline money.\n\nTwo weeks later I get a call from Danny’s assistant. Could we be in his office tomorrow at 8:30? Swell, I thought, he wants to chew us out again.\n\nBut we go and it’s the happy ingratiating Danny. “Boys! Come on in. You want a doughnut? How was your weekend?” He had read over our outline again and decided it was terrific. He had just a few tweaks. We were told to dash off a revised outline and then we’d go to work on the draft.\n\nTwo days later we delivered the new outline. And the following day…\n\nHe cut us off.\n\nIt just didn’t “jump off the page” for him. But he paid us for a second outline.\n\nElements of those outlines appeared in future shows but what the hell? He did pay us.\n\nWe never did a BARNEY MILLER assignment but a few years later when we were head writers of MASH he called and asked if we wanted to be his showrunners for the upcoming season. We chose to stay with MASH.\n\nThe guys who did take the job worked a million hours a week, learned a hell of a lot, got paid a fortune, and Danny gave them Rolls Royces… which they used to drive themselves to Cedar-Sinai hospital.\n\nBARNEY MILLER is back, on some retro cable channels, DVD's, and downloading If you’ve never seen it, it’s a treat."
