        "text": "Robert Vaughn, who played a slick spy on TV’s The Man From U.N.C.L.E., died Friday, our sister site Deadline reports. He was 83.\n\nVaughn had been ill with acute leukemia and died surrounded by his family. He is survived by his wife, Linda, and his children, Cassidy and Caitlin.\n\nIn addition to portraying U.N.C.L.E.‘s Napoleon Solo for four seasons (and in subsequent movies and a spinoff), Vaughn’s prolific small-screen career included stints on The A-Team, Murder She Wrote, Law & Order, Law & Order: SVU and the British soap opera Coronation Street.\n\nIn 1978, he won an Emmy for his work in the miniseries Washington: Behind Closed Doors.\n\nNCIS’ David McCallum, who starred opposite Vaughn in The Man From U.N.C.L.E. as Illya Kuryakin, said in a statement to TVLine, “I just heard the news, and I’m utterly devastated. Robert and I worked together for many years and losing him is like losing a part of me. My deepest sympathies go out to Linda and the Vaughn family.”"
