        "text": "I was a huge fan of the NBC TV series “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.”, created by Norman Felton and developed by Sam Rolfe, it starred Robert Vaughn as Napoleon Solo (a character named by James Bond’s Ian Fleming), and David MCCallum as Illya Kuryakin. With the venerable Leo G. Carroll as their boss, Alexander Waverly, the duo set off to stop international villains intent on world domination. The show was a huge hit in the mid-sixties, some even calling McCallum “the blonde Beatle”. Like many kids during that era, I had all the toys, the guns, the games, and later, the novelizations, soundtracks, videos and DVDs. After 4 seasons and even a spin-off called The Girl From U.N.C.L.E., the series was eventually cancelled.\n\nVaughn and McCallum reunited in the ’80s in “The Return of the Man From U.N.C.L.E. – The Fifteen Years Later Affair”; It was great for fans of the show who enjoyed their albeit brief reunion. Following that last TV appearance, there had been many more attempts at making an updated films about TV series; others had been tried; Mission Impossible, I Spy, The Avengers, The Saint, Star Trek, Lost in Space and even Get Smart were all rebooted to varying degrees of success and or abysmal failures. Enter Director Guy Ritchie, (Sherlock Holmes); Could he succeed where so many others have failed?\n\nRitchie enlisted the actors Henry Cavill (Man of Steel, The Tudors) as Solo, and Armie Hammer (The Social Network), as Kuryakin. Hugh Grant was cast as Waverly, in a story that acts a a prequel to the beginning of U.N.C.L.E. Like many movies based on iconic, legendary TV shows and characters, I try to view them with an open mind, because I’m usually disappointed with them; Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman were not Patrick MacNee and Diana Rigg in the Avengers; Luke Wilson and Eddie Murphy were ridiculous in the roles once inhabited by Robert Culp and Bill Cosby in I Spy; and as much as I may have liked Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible, his character didn’t exist in the original series and Jon Voight (in the role made famous by Peter Graves), was turned into the villain; killing him off was just awful and don’t get me Started on the Wild, Wild, West. At least Steve Carrel and Anne Hathaway in the Don Adams and Barbara Feldman roles from Get Smart were funny, but I digress…\n\nFans of U.N.C.L.E. both old and new will find plenty to like in this new film, beginning with Cavill’s Napoleon Solo. Cavill plays Solo with the right kind of cadence, humor and seriousness when called for, just as Vaughn did in the original series. Hammer brings a new twist on the role of Kuryakin, and it’s quite different from McCallum’s portrayal. Hammer is more serious, more violent, and edgier than McCallum. That being said, Hammer however brings out the some of the qualities we’ve come to expect from Kuryakin; loyalty, ingenuity and action. I was concerned when I heard Grant would be playing Waverly, however he was great, even better than I’d hoped. Like most reviews, the so-called innocent, (a plot device used in nearly every episode of the TV series), was ably played by Alicia Vikander, who more than held her own and every bit as good as any of the incredible leading ladies to grace the TV series. As for the evil villainess “Victoria Vinciguerra”, (played by Elizabeth Debeki), she too can comfortably stand alongside some of the TV series’ deadliest damsels, like Janet Leigh, Anne Francis, Jeanne Cooper, Vera Miles and Joan Crawford, to name just a few!\n\nRitchie’s hiring of Daniel Pembelton to score the film was another excellent choice; his soundtrack to the BBC America spy series “The Game” was fantastic. Pemeberton’s music echoes the ’60s spy films quite well, influenced by the likes of Ennio Morricone, John Barry, and Jerry Goldsmith, who scored the original TV series theme. Die hard fans will no doubt catch the very brief notes of Goldsmith’s score that was performed by Hugo Montenegro and appears in the film.\n\nI truly enjoyed this prequel, which sets the stage for the creation of U.N.C.L.E., the pairing of Solo and Kuryakin and the arrival of Waverly. Like the chemistry that existed between Vaughn and McCallum, Cavill and Hammer seemed to be well on their way to establishing something similar. Time will tell if there will be a sequel, as it took decades to make this film a reality. If they do, a new generation may be inclined to see it. I certainly will."
