In film, gunman Lee in The Magnificent Seven (a role he kind-of reprised in Battle Beyond the Stars), Major Paul Krueger in The Bridge at Remagen, the voice of Proteus IV, the computer villain of Demon Seed, Walter Chalmers in Bullitt, Ross Webster in Superman III, and war veteran Chester A. Gwynn in The Young Philadelphians which earned him a 1960 Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nRobert was a true gent and will be greatly missed."
