While I can’t imagine who thought Bradley Cooper could carry off such a suave, charismatic character as Napoleon Solo (Hello movie studios [say that in your mind as Jerry would address Newman], stop trying to shove this guy as a leading man down our throats), it matters not, as long as he is out. According to rumors, Joel Kinnaman (“The Killing,” The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo [2011]) and the Fassbender were first choices, but neither could be worked out schedule-wise. If you’re not familiar with the original television series, “The Man from U.N.C.L.E.” was a spy show about a worldwide intelligence agency (with the main characters written/developed by Ian Fleming), starring Robert Vaughn (Solo) and David McCallum (Kuryakin). Here’s a cool, little behind-the-scenes summary:\n\nCurrently, Joel Edgerton (Warrior, The Great Gatsby [2012])\n\nis set to portray Solo’s Russian spy partner, Illya Kuryakin; he’s a great choice, but they still need to find the right lead. And since it’s well known in Hollywood my head that I am nothing if not helpful and full of suggestions, here are five candidates who should be carefully considered…\n\nand pondered…\n\nand stared at for long periods of time…\n\nand mulled over…\n\nand thought about day and night, until one of them is offered the role, causing him to want to come to my house and “thank” me, in person.\n\n5. The BAMber:\n\n4. Eric Bana:\n\n3. Damian Lews:\n\n2. Ewan McGregor:\n\n1. John Simm:"
