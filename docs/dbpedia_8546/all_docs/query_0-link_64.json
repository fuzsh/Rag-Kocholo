        "text": "NEW YORK — Robert Vaughn, the debonair, Oscar-nominated actor whose many film roles were eclipsed by his hugely popular turn in television's The Man From U.N.C.L.E., has died. He was 83.\n\nMr. Vaughn died Friday morning after a brief battle with acute leukemia, said his manager, Matthew Sullivan.\n\nThe Man From U.N.C.L.E., was an immediate hit, particularly with young people, when it debuted on NBC in 1964. It was part of an avalanche of secret agent shows (I Spy, Mission: Impossible, Secret Agent), spoofs (Get Smart), books (The Spy Who Came in From the Cold) and even songs (Secret Agent Man) inspired by the James Bond films.\n\nMr. Vaughn's urbane superspy Napoleon Solo teamed with Scottish actor David McCallum's Illya Kuryakin, a soft-spoken, Russian-born agent.\n\nThe pair, who had put aside Cold War differences for a greater good, worked together each week for the mysterious U.N.C.L.E. (United Network Command for Law and Enforcement) in combatting the international crime syndicate THRUSH.\n\n\"Girls age 9 to 12 liked David McCallum because he was so sweet,\" Mr. Vaughn said in a 2005 interview in England. \"But the old ladies and the 13- to 16-year-olds liked me because I was so detached.\"\n\nThe Man From U.N.C.L.E. also was a big hit abroad, particularly in McCallum's native Great Britain.\n\nThe show aired until early 1968, when sagging ratings brought it to an end. In his The Man From U.N.C.L.E. Book, Jon Heitland blamed its demise on a shift from straight adventure to more comic plots in the show's third season that turned off many viewers, as well as time slot changes.\n\nVaughn and McCallum reunited in 1983 for a TV movie, The Return of the Man From U.N.C.L.E., in which the super spies were lured out of retirement to save the world once more.\n\nMcCallum has found stardom anew in his 14th season playing Dr. Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard on the hit CBS drama NCIS.\n\nHe said he was \"utterly devastated\" after learning of his former co-star's death.\n\n\"Robert and I worked together for many years and losing him is like losing a part of me,\" McCallum said in a written statement.\n\nIn recent years, Mr. Vaughn had starred for eight seasons on the British crime-caper series Hustle, playing Albert Stroller, the lone Yank in a band of London-based con artists. Hustle also aired in the United States.\n\nBefore U.N.C.L.E., Mr. Vaughn made his mark in movies, earning an Oscar nomination in 1959 for his supporting role in The Young Philadelphians, in which he played a wounded war veteran accused of murder."
