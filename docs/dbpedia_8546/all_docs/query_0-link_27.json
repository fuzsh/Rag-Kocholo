        "text": "The original “Man From U.N.C.L.E.” has died. Robert Vaughn, who played secret agent Napoleon Solo on the 1960s spy comedy series, passed away at the age of 83, according to media reports.\n\nVaughn died from complications from acute leukemia.\n\nAfter appearing as an uncredited extra in “The Ten Commandments” in 1956, Vaughn landed his first breakthrough role in “The Young Philadelphians” in 1959, for which he was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar.\n\nIn 1964, Vaughn was offered his own TV series, originally titled “Solo,” in which he would play the suave secret agent Napoleon Solo. The show became “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.” and Vaughn was partnered with David McCallum, who played his fellow agent and partner, Illya Kuryakin.\n\n“The Man From U.N.C.L.E.” was such a success it launched spinoff series, a line of merchandise and was recently remade as a big screen feature with Henry Cavill in the Napoleon Solo role and Armie Hammer as Kuryakin.\n\nVaughn continued to act well into the 2010s, with roles on TV shows such as “Bonanza,” “Law & Order,” “The A-Team” and “Hawaii Five-O” and films like “Superman III,” “The Magnificent Seven” and “Bullitt.”"
