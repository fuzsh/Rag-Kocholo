        "text": "I think I'll read the Girl episodes reviews. I've never seen the Girl episodes, so reviews can sub for now.\n\nI burned through the complete series Man Dvd set a few years ago, and recently did a complete 10 film movieathon.\n\nI have the briefcase dvd set, so sometimes I also put on a suit, tuck my communicator into the inside jacket pocket, grab the briefcase and head out the door on a mission ie a sweep for Thrush agents.\n\nYes the Uncle car was quite exciting, being chased by helicopters on the open road.\n\nThat's about the only episode that readily comes to mind, involving the car.\n\nYou're not missing much with the Girl episodes. They're a curiosity at best. I acquired the two DVD sets from eBay for a decent price last year just to have them and have gotten through roughly a third of them. I'd seen most before, but wanted to be a completest. Then again I am more of a plodder rather than a binger, so I have lots of series on DVD and Blu I like to savor.\n\nAnother great review blog is here http://benzadmiral-uncle.blogspot.com/\n\n@BT3366\n\nGood blog linked above. I read the Uncle 2015 review. Quite interesting. The burning of Uncle Rudi, was yes, a well played scene. Cavill nailed that.\n\nI will eventually pick up The Girl dvd sets, for completist purposes. The two sets are quite pricey on Amazon.ca.\n\nWill have to look around.\n\nI forget if these have been posted, but I found another one I hadn't seen before (even though it was posted in 2014).\n\nThe television of Please Don't Eat the Daisies was produced at MGM (UNCLE's studio) and shown on NBC (UNCLE's network).\n\nIllya Kuryakin cameo at the top of an episode.\n\nNapoleon Solo's cameo at the end (note end titles).\n\nThese have been on YouTube for some time. But, the following season, there an April Dancer cameo. Again note the end titles.\n\n@waverly\n\nPat Crowley, lead actress of Please Don't Eat The Daisies, earlier starred in TMFU pilot as lead girl,lead innocent.\n\nWas Daisies trying to tie her character in with her earlier Uncle role?\n\nIt kind of fits as Solo did return her to her normal suburban family life after her glamorous and dangerous flirtation with the UNCLE spy world, but she doesn't seem to recognize the \"government man\" Solo, but maybe she wasn't letting on, as her Uncle adventure was top secret, not to be shared with family.\n\n//Pat Crowley, lead actress of Please Don't Eat The Daisies, earlier starred in TMFU pilot as lead girl,lead innocent.\n\nWas Daisies trying to tie her character in with her earlier Uncle role?//\n\nPerhaps.\n\nIn real life, Please Don't Eat the Daisies was a book written by Jean Kerr. It was made into a movie at MGM with Doris Day and David Niven.\n\nThe studio still had the rights so it made a sitcom starring Pat Crowley.\n\nI found the first season on DVD in a charity shop over the weekend, so I have treats in store. I've seen some of these episodes, but nowhere near all, because the B/W ones don't usually get repeated.\n\nIt turns out I'd never seen the very first episode before, and it is awfully good. Sets the template for the series (apart from it being a bit of a one-man show rather than the partner dynamic, which took a while to develop).\n\nI especially like the relationship with the Girl of the Week, which is nuanced and believable, and the ending, where we see Napoleon\n\nwatch Elaine's reunion with her family, reflect on the lonely life of a secret agent, then shrug and hit on an air hostess.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSky are selling TMFU film at the moment,on offer at £5.99.\n\nIts downloaded to your Sky Box ,mobile etc and the DVD is posted to you.\n\nJust in case any of you want to buy it cheap,i'm not,as I thought the film was crap.\n\nJust watched The Finny Foot Affair, which is one of my favourite episodes and contains my favourite line in the whole series, delivered by a young Kurt Russell as Chris:\n\n\"Boy, sometimes being a spy doesn't make sense at all!\"\n\nYou said it, kiddo.\n\nJust this morning I finally got in the post the 8-film DVD set of UNCLE films. I've been wanting it for a long time and was able to get it for a good price. I now officially have all the UNCLE series and films.\n\nJust this morning I finally got in the post the 8-film DVD set of UNCLE films.

Burning thru these 8 films in order is a hoot, and then tag with the 1983 Return of the Man From Uncle, 15 Years Later Affair\n\nAs for complete set, do you also have the Girl From Uncle season.\n\nThat's all I'm missing.\n\nJust this morning I finally got in the post the 8-film DVD set of UNCLE films.

I had fun going through each of them briefly and enjoying the trailers. I noticed the credits of each film all have the same fonts and slow motion so that continuity was interesting.\n\nYes, I do have both Girl from UNCLE sets, got a good deal on them a couple of years ago on eBay. But it's one of those shows I can only watch in small doses. Just got through the Paradise Lost Affair, which if you know you'll understand why.\n\nI don't see the sets around a lot, but they don't seem to be nearly as expensive as they had been previously. But you're really not missing anything, either."
