        "text": "Mr. Solo is a fictional gangster in the James Bond novels by Ian Fleming. This is a character that appeared in EON Productions' of the 1964 James Bond film \"Goldfinger\". The character was portrayed by British actor Martin Benson and was adapted from the literary character who first appeared in Ian Fleming's 1959 novel 'Goldfinger'.\n\nMr. Solo is one of a trio of crime bosses who joined up with Auric Goldfinger for \"Operation Grand Slam\". He had a laser shipped from Switzerland to aid in Goldfinger's break-in of Fort Knox. Solo is the only person who refuses to take part in Goldfinger's heist. He opted to simply receive his payment of one million dollars in gold bullion for services rendered. The gold bullion was placed in the trunk of a Lincoln automobile provided by Goldfinger. Unnoticed James Bond slips a piece of paper with details of \"Operation Grand Slam\" into Solo's pocket along with a tracking device for Felix Leiter to find him.\n\nThe henchman Oddjob drives Solo to the airport. On the way there, he pulls onto a side-road and uses a gun to kill the enemy gangster. Oddjob then takes the car to a wrecking yard where it is placed in a scrap metal crusher with Solo's body still in the back seat.\n\nThe surname (Solo) after being used in the film is given to the character of Napoleon Solo a few months later in \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\" TV show, which was co - created in part by Ian Fleming shortly before he died."
