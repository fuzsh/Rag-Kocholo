        "text": "Today saw the passing of iconic television actor Robert Vaughn. The legendary television star succumbed to acute leukaemia.\n\nThe actor who was 83 had starred in numerous television and film projects over a long and illustrious career.\n\nVaughn first came to international attention when he played the role of Napoleon Solo in the original ‘Man From Uncle’ series of the 1960’s. The series, which cashed in on the success of the cinematic James Bond adventures managed to put a science fiction element into spy drama and is credited as the original Spy-Fi series. The show centred on an international agency known as UNCLE, which did battle on a weekly basis against the diabolical organised criminal organisation known as THRUSH.\n\nVaughn’s portrayal of Napoleon Solo was a suave and sophisticated one and very memorable to fans of the series.\n\nVaughn enjoyed many roles in genre television and film, which included that of Albert Stroller in the hit BBC Drama ‘Hustle’ as well as General Stockwell in the final season of ‘The A – Team’.\n\nVaughn’s film work saw him take on the role of Lee in the original ‘Magnificent Seven’ other memorable roles included space outlaw Gelt in ‘Battle Beyond The Stars’, Walter Chalmers in the Steve McQueen hit ‘Bullitt’ and Ross Webster in ‘Superman III’.\n\nDavid McCallum, from the hit TV show NCIS, who as Illya Kuryakin starred alongside Vaughn in The ‘Man From UNCLE’, told TVLine.com he was “utterly devastated” by the news.\n\n“Robert and I worked together for many years and losing him is like losing a part of me. My deepest sympathies go out to Linda and the Vaughn family,” he said.\n\nVaughn is survived by his wife Linda and two children, Cassidy and Caitlin Vaughn.\n\nWe here at SciFiPulse wish to pay our respects to Robert Vaughn and pass our condolences on to the family and friends he leaves behind. Rest In Peace."
