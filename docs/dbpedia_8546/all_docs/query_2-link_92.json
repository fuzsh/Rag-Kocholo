        "text": "MODE cover star Henry Cavill talks to Andrew Dickens about the joy of polo necks, the fun of guns and the wardrobe issues of being Superman\n\nFor a man whoâs used to getting changed in a phone box, swapping clothes in the offices of a private air charter company must seem positively luxurious. Mind you, Henry Cavill needs the space.\n\nOnly weeks after he wrapped up filming the latest Superman film, with shoulders you could drive across and biceps like prize hams, heâs still sporting a superhero physique that can make us mortals feel simultaneously fat and skinny.\n\nHeâs also just wrapped MODEâs jet-setting cover shoot. His look, as he swaggers around an airfield just outside Exeter (giving rise to âIs it bird? Is it a plane? Yes, itâs a planeâ gags), has a dash of Sixties styling, which is a nod to the next Cavill film to hit cinemas: Guy Ritchieâs take on the classic TV show The Man From UNCLE. Cavill, it transpires, loves clothes, loves dressing up, but thanks to those muscles, his passion has problems.\n\nâItâs bloody expensive,â he says, now dressed down in a checked shirt and jeans, and digesting a sausage butty. âIâm buying new clothes every year. Iâm bigger than I was in the first Superman film (Man Of Steel), so I donât fit the same clothes I did then. And when I was doing The Man From UNCLE, I was smaller, so itâs a constant shift in body size and shape. Itâs fun, but youâve got to have a big closet, so you can leave stuff in there and go, âOh, back to that size again â I can wear that sweaterâ.\n\nâBut I never throw stuff away because Iâve changed size. Things Iâve loved, Iâve worn so much Iâve had to get rid. Iâll love something so much, I still see it the way it initially was, and then a friend will say, âWhy do you dress like a homeless person? Look at your f*cking clothes, mate.â And then you realise that the T-shirt you adore has four holes in it. And that pair of jeans no longer has a fashionable rip, itâs just your knee hanging out.â\n\nCavillâs character in The Man From UNCLE is Napoleon Solo. Or, âthe one played by Robert Vaughnâ for those of us who spent childhood Saturday teatimes being entertained by TV repeats â always featuring men in roll necks â from this strange, colourful decade our parents banged on about. Solo, a postwar art thief-turned-Cold War agent, is the dapper playboy â who Cavill describes as âan arsehole with a heartâ â working alongside Soviet spying machine Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer in the film, David McCallum when it was on TV). Itâs Soloâs look that inspired the shoot. Cavill likes this.\n\nâI really do,â he says. âI was looking at some photos of myself in The Man From UNCLE, and I thought, âThose are really great.â I love wearing classic suits. And the great thing about the Sixties is that they had a little bit of flair. You can go big flair, or just a little bit, and I like a little bit. Iâm more of a classic guy; Iâm not outspoken, so itâs nice to wear something that looks so sharp and has a bit of colour.â\n\nAnd your feelings on polo necks?\n\nâPolo necks are great! Thereâs this attitude towards polo necks, where if you wear one, then all of a sudden youâre a dickhead. And itâs not fair, because polo necks look really good. Itâs just a matter of people opening their minds to it. We can wear all sorts of stuff these days, so why not a polo neck?â\n\nWhy not, indeed? And it wasnât just the polo necks Cavill enjoyed about the film; he claims Ritchie is âthe best person Iâve ever worked with. He makes great movies, but doesnât sacrifice any fun or enjoyment in the making â if I could do every movie in the future with him, I would happily do it.â This, of course, wonât be the case. For example, Ritchie isnât directing Stratton â the film for which Cavillâs currently preparing. Based on the John Stratton novels by ex-SBS commando Duncan Falconer, itâs something of a passion project for Cavill, whose brother Nik is in the Royal Marines, and heâs co-producing the film with another brother, Charlie.\n\nâIâve always been a huge supporter of the Royal Marines, and therefore the SBS is largely â not entirely â drawn from the Marines,â he says. âItâs my chance to be the Marine I never got to be, and draw some attention to them, hopefully raise some money. Iâm an ambassador for the Royal Marines trust fund. And I like the guns and stuff. I do. Itâs fun.â\n\nNor did Ritchie get his hands on the biggest film of Cavillâs career to date, the currently titled Batman vs Superman: Dawn Of Justice. Next summerâs clashing of the capes â and cause of Cavillâs enormous wardrobe requirements â sees his Man Of Steel take on Ben Affleckâs Dark Knight. A major salvo from DC in the war with Marvel for comicfilmiverse supremacy, itâs a subject of anticipation and hope. What can he tell us about it?\n\nâI canât tell you anything.â\n\nNot even from a fashion perspective? Surely there was some costume envy. With all that black, Batman has a much more chic look. And external underpants have never caught on.\n\nâIâm incredibly loyal to my character,â says Cavill, with genuine conviction. âI love him. Iâm protective of him. Supermanâs the dude. Heâs an absolute ledge. Iâd never say, âIâd prefer to be that superhero.â Iâm Superman.â\n\nThe Man From UNCLE is at cinemas nationwide from 14 August\n\nWhen asked about your weaknesses in a job interview, the old joke is that you should always answer: âI care too much â¦â\n\nBut thatâs actually the truth about Clark Kentâs heroic alter ego in the new DC cinematic universe. As Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice heads to theaters March 25, Entertainment Weekly has been talking with the filmmakers and stars about where things will go after 2013âs Man of Steel.\n\nHenry Cavill literally describes his Superman as the new guy on the job, one who knows he messed up while trying to save the world the last time around. It sounds like a fair amount of regret hangs over the head of this superhero, and now he has invoked the ire of this bizarre man in a bat costume from neighboring Gotham City.\n\nHere are the actorâs thoughts on what Kal-El is facing in Dawn of Justice, and how heâs learning on the jobâ¦\n\nEntertainment Weekly: This film has been in the works for three years, so what are your earliest memories of getting back into the cape and picking up the story after Man of Steel?\n\nHenry Cavill: My first memory of getting back into it was delving back into the comics and finding bits of personality. Obviously, I had to wait for the script to come back so I knew what I was allowed to implement, and then it was just about trying to get as much of Supermanâs character into the script as possible â as far as how I saw it â and of course everyone has their different viewpoints on the character. My lasting memory, was going back to the comic books and really exploring the psychology of the man with the hope that I could apply it to the script.\n\nKryptonite has become a synonym in the English language for a weak spot, an Achilles heel, but beyond that these movies have taken the fact that Superman canât save everyone and made that a weakness. I think thatâs a very human weakness to have.\n\nFor me, when it came on to Supermanâs weakness, itâs inside him. Itâs the fact that he does really love humans. He loves what they bring to the world, he loves this planet and who he lives alongside, and he wants to really, really help them. We could go deep into the psychology of what that means and what that makes ones intentions on a daily basis when youâre a super-powered alien.\n\nNot only is he bulletproof, but he can withstand a lot of cruel treatment from us.\n\nEssentially itâs that. Thatâs his weakness, that he doesnât want to hurt anyone. He doesnât want to scare anyone, and in that you can take advantage of him. It makes it very easy to take advantage of him. â¦ This is someone who is a complete amateur, and heâs facing up against someone who is very well versed in the arts of war.\n\nThatâs the way religions of the world talk about God, isnât it? That God loves us even if weâre horrible, even if we do the worst things imaginable. Itâs interesting seeing that element in Superman.\n\nI mean, thereâs always been some parallels drawn, theological parallels drawn between Superman and various religions. I do my best to draw parallels just between mythological heroes if I can, and yeah, because religionâs a dangerous ground. Thatâs a minefield.\n\nAfter the destruction we saw in Man of Steel, is Superman suffering from a kind of survivorâs guilt, since he saved the world, but destroyed a city?\n\nI wouldnât necessarily say itâs a survivorâs guilt. I mean, thatâs a different kind of thing because heâs above the threat. I think the most difficult thing for him at this stage of the story is that he has just come to terms with the fact that he is really, really quite powerful and he hasnât found any major vulnerabilities yet, and despite this, despite the enormous power that he has, he still cannot do everything, and he really struggles with that. Itâs not just a quick, âOkay, I get it. I canât save everyone.â That takes a long time to work out.\n\nThere were complaints from some fans that it was out-of-character for Superman to allow the Man of Steel fight to cause such destruction and loss of life. In Batman v Superman, that anger is part of the story â itâs why Bruce Wayne hates Superman. Did it surprise you that they incorporated that?\n\nI think that may have been part of the master plan all along. When it comes to the major story stuff I canât really speak on that, because that was above my paygrade. What I can speak of is the idea of Superman, especially when the finger is pointed at collateral damage in the first movie. I mean, weâre talking about a greenhorn.\n\nDo you think heâd do it differently now?\n\nLetâs say now, [if] Superman has the same threat again, thatâs a different story. He would, of course, bring collateral damage to an absolute minimum, but in that, heâs just trying to survive because if he doesnât, the planetâs gone. Thatâs the excuse I make for Superman. Heâs fresh and heâs new, and itâs very easy to point out the faults in someone after theyâve done it, but put yourself in their shoes and see what happens.\n\nIn the past, some have complained Superman is too perfect. But give them the flawed hero, and there are complaints that Superman should be perfect. It seems like your Superman deals with the same problem. He seems to want the world to cut him a little bit of slack.\n\nI mean, itâs going to be impossible to please everyone anyway, but I think there is huge potential to provide Superman with the weakness that people crave in the future and expand upon story stuff without offending the lore of Superman. Itâs a fine line to tread because weâre in a different age now, but I think we can tell a fascinating, interesting story where Superman has his weaknesses and is also doing the thing which we expect Superman to do. Heâs being the ideal. It shouldnât be easy to tell the story of Superman.\n\nShouldnât this Superman be a little angry? He saved the world, but that doesnât seem to be enough for everyone.\n\nThe thing about Superman is that although he is physically infallible, psychologically heâs very much vulnerable to the same things that make us vulnerable. When youâre doing your best, your utmost, and you still canât save everyone, and then people point their finger at you and call you the bad guy, I mean, that would be enormously frustrating. I know the human reaction would be, âHold on a second, F-you man,â and his reaction is the first half of that: not quite the âF-you.â Itâs the hurt.â\n\nAre there any offbeat Superman stories from the comics that youâd especially love to see in film? I always loved Mark Millarâs Red Son, where Superman lands in the Soviet Union instead of Kansasâ¦\n\nI think the offbeat stories are great, and I read Red Son in particular before I did Man of Steel, to get an idea of the baseline of the character because despite the fact that itâs offbeat and heâs grown up in a completely different environment, the character is still, at itâs very core, the same thing, and I love that. I think whatâs important now is to tell a story which is dedicated to sharing the same character in the comic books in the cinematic universe, and then after thatâs been established, then we can start exploring some more of the offbeat stuff.\n\nNow, your Batman, Ben Affleck, played early Superman actor George Reeves in a movie called Hollywoodland a few years ago. So, for you, as an actor who is now playing Superman, I wondered if you had any interesting conversations with him about him playing a guy who once played the same iconic role.\n\nI didnât actually. Maybe I should have a good long chitchat with him about that.\n\nWhat do Batman and Superman talk about when youâre both in costume between takes?\n\nLike, âDo you need to pee?â âYeah, I need to pee.â âShould we go now or wait?â âHow much time do you think weâll have between shots?â [Laughs] Thatâs pretty much it. The process.\n\nLONDON â Itâs not every day that you go shopping with Superman.\n\nIt was 10 a.m. on a sunny Friday last month, one of those rare autumn days when the English capital seems to have swapped weather with Santa Monica, Calif., when I first spotted Henry Cavill, the British actor who has put his stamp on the Man of Steel for a new generation of filmgoers.\n\nMilitary erect, his arms folded purposefully, he was standing outside Gieves & Hawkes, the Savile Row clothier that has been outfitting the British gentry since King George III.\n\nHe was hard to miss. Regardless of oneâs age, gender or sexual orientation, it can be agreed that the man is a specimen, a 99.9999 percentile hunk, a super man. I pictured a hypothetical ad in Variety: âWanted: Actor. Untitled Superman project. Must be as handsome as Ryan Gosling, as charming as Colin Firth and as ripped as any starting linebacker on the Dallas Cowboys.â\n\nHe had arrived on Savile Row from his home in Londonâs genteel Kensington district to browse for suits on the eve of the publicity blitz for âJustice League,â the superhero blockbuster-to-be featuring Mr. Cavill alongside Ben Affleck as Batman and Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman.\n\nAside from a Superman-ish forelock that tumbled down his forehead, Mr. Cavill looked more like a romantic lead from an E. M. Forster period drama, wearing a royal blue Cifonelli blazer, a dandyish confection of curls and a distinctly retro, and distinctly absurd, handlebar mustache.\n\nâItâs for a role, âMission: Impossible 6,ââ he said sheepishly, referring to his giant crumb catcher. âIt makes me feel a little odd at times. People think Iâm some crazy handlebar-mustache-growing person.â\n\nâBut,â he added gamely, âIâm also playing around with it now, growing it a bit longer. Why the hell not? When else am I going to grow a handlebar mustache?â\n\nTo the degree the mustache was intended as a disguise, it failed. In recent weeks, the whiskers had seemingly become more famous than he was, inspiring countless tabloid items after Mr. Affleck jokingly referred to it as a âfull-on porn-star mustacheâ during a âJustice Leagueâ reshoot.\n\nThen again, Mr. Cavill has an uneasy relationship to fame. For years, he was a Hollywoodâs king of the near miss. He lost out to Daniel Craig to be the next James Bond, and also to Robert Pattinson on both âTwilightâ and âHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.â Although he has been working steadily since he was a teenager, he always seemed to receive second billing to his biceps.\n\nBut he has been flirting with A-list stardom ever since he inherited the role of Superman in Zack Snyderâs 2013 franchise reboot, âMan of Steel,â followed by featured roles opposite Armie Hammer in âMan from U.N.C.L.E.â in 2015 and now Tom Cruise in his latest âMission Impossibleâ installment.\n\nIn person, though, Mr. Cavill comes across less like a Hollywood action hero than an English gentleman in the prewar sense, a vestige of an era when leading men were described as âdashingâ or âdebonair,â and civility meant something.\n\nIn a less august setting than one of Londonâs oldest bespoke tailors, he might be fair game for the âpapsâ (paparazzi), as they say in England, as well as for any hormonal young woman with a smartphone and an Instagram handle.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nBy now itâs likely not a spoiler to reveal that âJustice Leagueâ includes the return of Superman, who sacrificed himself to save humanity at the end of 2016âs âBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.â That film, which was generally regarded as overly dark and somewhat unwieldy, gave audiences a version of Superman (Henry Cavill) that felt morose and off-base from the comic books. Here, filmmaker Zack Snyder â as well as Joss Whedon, who stepped in to direct the re-shoots â uses âJustice Leagueâ as a chance to reestablish the character.\n\nâHeâs definitely different from previous incarnations,â Cavill says, speaking a few weeks ago during the âJustice Leagueâ press junket here. âI feel like this is the natural progression from the end of âMan of Steelâ into what he is now. This is a rebirth of the character, to coin the D.C. comics franchise right now: Itâs a refresh.â He adds, âThis movie highlights the qualities of Superman that exist in the comic books. Thatâs something Iâve always been very keen to highlight in the character. This rebirth provided the opportunity for me to play those characteristics.â\n\nSuperman was largely left out of the marketing campaign for âJustice League,â and most of the cast and the filmmakers did their best to keep the revival a secret for as long as possible. But fans, especially those familiar with the comic books, had been speculating for months, asking: âHow can you have âJustice Leagueâ without Superman?â One of the only clues for his return? Reports that Cavillâs mustache for the upcoming âMission Impossibleâ sequel had to be digitally removed during the re-shoots, meaning that Superman would be somewhere in âJustice Leagueâ (âThat damn mustache,â Cavill jokes). As it turned out, the studio always intended to include Superman but did its best to keep the rollout spoiler free.\n\nâI think die-hard fans will know you canât have the Justice League without Superman,â says producer Deborah Snyder. âWithout Superman, there was this loss of hope. At the end of [âBatman v Supermanâ], there was this impending doom. This danger that was coming. That was the impetus of Bruce [Wayne] recruiting the Justice League. That was the why. But the threat is so big and large that they still needed Superman. They needed to be a team.â\n\nâHis self-sacrifice causes such a huge ripple,â adds producer Charles Roven. âItâs so inspiring that his presence is really all over this movie before you know whether or not heâs going to come back. The world is not the same without him, because he was representative of hope. Hereâs the thing: We wanted to make a movie that was about hope and the positive force hope is. And it meant that you had to bring him back.â\n\nThe process by which Batman (Ben Affleck) and the other members of the Justice League bring Superman back to life is complicated, involving several scenes that would be impossible to fully explain here. Suffice to say that Supermanâs lifeless corpse (which was not played by Cavill for these scenes) is not lifeless for long. And ultimately, itâs Supermanâs reaction to being awoken from death thatâs more interesting than how heâs actually brought back. His initial anger and confusion shift to an emotional confrontation with himself over whatâs happened to Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and his mother, Martha (Diane Lane), since his death.\n\nâI think itâs very confusing for him in that scenario, as it would be for any of us,â Cavill says. âHeâs trying to work out what the hell happened. Iâm sure thereâs a sense of failure there, akin to that sense of âI wish I hadnât died so I could still be here and the world wouldnât be in the state itâs in now and I could have protected my mother and Lois from the pain theyâve been experiencing.â Thereâs that sense of guilt, but it comes with unconditional love. Itâs not rational. One of the great things about us is that we still care even though we may not have a reason to feel guilty.â\n\nRead the full story.\n\nVanity Fair: When you take on roles like Superman or Geralt, which have an existing fandom, is your approach different than it would be while playing a role that doesnât come with that burden of expectation?\n\nHenry Cavill: I suppose it is. I approach every role in the same way, with 100% effort and dedication. But with an IP attached, more often than not, I am already a fan of that IP if Iâm playing the character. For me, thereâs a heavy responsibility to do the character as much justice as possible from the source material.\n\nWhen you approach a role from the perspective of both a performer and a fan, do you give more input? Do you feel more ownership over what a character like Geralt might or might not do?\n\nI do think it carries more weight if an actor is well-versed in the lore. And itâs certainly beneficial to my performance if I know the world. There was collaboration in the process. I would make notes because the schedule was grueling, to say the least. I would often do my work in my two hours of hair and makeup every morning. When it came to getting to set, Iâd have a few suggestions about dropping lines that felt they were too obvious. When it comes to book Geralt, it tended to be a bit more complex and nuanced than that.\n\nUltimately, [this was] Laurenâs vision and it was my place to represent Geralt, my character, as accurately to the books as I possibly could. I would email her every now and again, when a new script came through and she would always be receptive of the emails. [But] it was entirely up to her whether she chose to apply the thoughts in [them].\n\nWhat were the challenges in translating a character like Geralt, who has a running inner monologue readers can follow along with, to the screen?\n\nIn the books, he has a very grim exterior and everything about him is potentially unlikable. When you couple that with the bookâs inner monologue, you forgive him and you have an understanding for who this character is, because he has these long complex conversations with kings and queens. And he can have those same conversations with thieves and villains. And you really get an idea of the level of the philosophical nature of this character.\n\nLaurenâs vision was more of an ensemble piece than the first Witcher books. Itâs driven a lot more by the characters of Yennefer and Cirilla. So instead, I decided that less was more. I wanted to really show Geraltâs perceptiveness, his intelligence, his old age, his wisdom, because heâs an old man, essentially, as far as weâre concerned. That, for me, was hopefully going to give the audienceâitâs almost like theyâre trying to crack a cipher when it comes to Geralt. So when he does say something, it means something. Heâs not shouting from the rooftops, and yet he is as large as a house of a character.\n\nHow much of that comes through in the actual voice that you developed for him, which is very different from your natural speaking voice?\n\nThe voice work really was very much in line with the idea of the character saying little. With Joey [Batey], who plays an amazing foil for Geralt in Jaskier, itâs nonstop jibber jabber. A lot of itâs very funny. I took rather obvious inspiration from Doug Cockle, who voices Geralt in the games. He has a slightly more whisper tone than mine. And itâs an American accent. But mine, I tried to make it as different as possible, so Iâm not just copying him. A lot of my inspiration came from there, but I didnât work with any voice coaches. I just found it as I went along.\n\nWith the look of Geralt, you could have gone a couple of ways. If you wanted to distinguish him entirely from the video game version, you might have chosen a different wig.\n\nThe wig was a long, long journey. Jacqui Rathore, who was in charge of the wig for me, she was having nightmares about that wig. She was taking it home every nightâI think she had three of themâshe was taking them home every night, working on them more and more and more. But by the end of the show, by episode one reshoots, fortunately, the wig was just on point. For me, for the character, it was important to have that white wig. Itâs gray more than anything else now, because white on camera, in those lights, ends up shining like the moon and it looked, frankly, ridiculous.\n\nRead the full interview at Vanity Fair!\n\nHenry Cavill has never been afraid of a challenge.\n\nThe British actor, known for his ripped physique in Man of Steel, spends hours training for his physically demanding roles. But the 38-year-old says he didnât discover his love for the gym until later in life. âWhen I was in school I played sports,â he tells PEOPLE. âI wasnât the most spectacular physical specimen back then, but I definitely had drive.â\n\nThat drive helped him land his first major physical role in Immortals. âI was doing a lot of martial arts and bodyweight exercises because it was apt for the character,â he says. âAnd the first time I really moved into lifting weights properly was for Man of Steel.â\n\nFrom there, says Cavill, his fitness journey took shape. âItâs evolved and developed in its own way depending on the characters that Iâve played or what Iâve had access to â the facilities, where Iâve wanted to go with my body and what Iâve wanted to do.â\n\nThese days, he says, he likes to maintain a baseline level of fitness that can be adjusted depending on his work. âI will do a lot of body building work for an aesthetic look for a project or a role,â he says, adding that he focuses on different body parts on different days.\n\nCavillâs fitness came to a halt in December after injuring his hamstring while working on The Witcher. While some people suffer a mental blow when injured, the Justice League star chose not to see it as a setback.\n\nâWhen I look back, I realize, yes, it was a hard time,â he says. âI think one of the skills Iâve picked up over the years is just forging ahead regardless of difficulty or hard work or trials and tribulations. So when the hamstring injury came, I tried to look at the silver lining. It was like, âOk. I was working insane hours and it was exhausting and I now physically canât work because Iâm on crutches.â So I was focusing more on taking the time off and going, how can I best heal myself?â\n\nHe explains further. âWhen it comes to my mental health, [I] focus on what I can control and work on that. And that gives me something to work towards rather than something to deal with or work through or manage my life through.â\n\nWith the injury now behind him and no immediate roles coming up, Cavill is working on sprinting. âI want to build a better engine,â says Cavill, who has partnered with MuscleTech supplement company. âOne of the things my physical therapy for my hamstring showed me was that I have a lot of capacity in my engine but I have not accessed it. And itâs something which I really want to build upon.â\n\ncontinue reading\n\nHenry Cavill stands in a Miami hotel room looking like a comic book drawing made real.\n\nHeâs 6-foot-2 but seems taller because heâs so broad. His muscles stretch an ordinary camel-colored knit shirt into a bulky superhero outfit. âIâm amazed how many people recognize me with a mask on,â the actor says, and itâs unclear if heâs being modest or truly doesnât know how cinematic he looks â even his wavy jet-black hair with its jagged widowâs peak would give him away (you may recognize this hairline from films such as Mission Impossible: Fallout).\n\nYet as we sit down for the first of our two interviews, Cavillâs brawn is quickly contrasted by his genteel demeanor that his colleagues say is typical of the 38-year-old Englishman. Take the way the Witcher actor typically starts his days on set: Cavill will select a crewmember, say hello, shake their hand and ask how their day is going. Then heâll approach another crewmember and do the same â then another and another and â¦\n\nâItâs to the point where sometimes our ADs are like, âOK, we have a huge crew, you canât ask everyone,â â says The Witcher showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich.\n\nExplains Cavill: âA set is often rush-rush-rush, and we forget the basic human decencies. I want people to know I respect everything they do and theyâre just doing a job like I am. To me, itâs just respect and good manners.â\n\nItâs a characteristically nonchalant answer from somebody whose approach to his work is anything but casual. From Cavillâs recent selection of roles to his work ethic to his social media engagement, his strategic deliberation reflects the hard-core gamer that he is.\n\nHeâs played Superman in a trio of DC films (which have grossed more than $2 billion), launched The Witcher franchise (Netflixâs most watched original series until Bridgerton came along) and had a scene-stealing turn in 2018âs Mission Impossible: Fallout (which brought in $800 million worldwide as the highest-grossing film in the franchise). All of this has positioned Cavill as arguably the biggest action hero in the world who isnât a household name â yet.\n\nZack Snyder calls Cavill âa warrior monk.â Fallout director Christopher McQuarrie sees Cavill a bit differently: In a town full of celebrities, âHenry is a classic movie star.â\n\nâItâs not like there was something in the water in the 1930s and â40s that there isnât today,â McQuarrie says. âMovie stars are not as abundant now for two simple reasons: The industry wanted and cultivated stars, and there were people ready to do the work required to be stars. Henry is in the category of somebody hell-bent on doing the work, and that work is hard.â\n\nCavill is certainly working more than ever, set to star in John Wick director Chad Stahelskiâs reboot of the action-fantasy Highlander, reprise his role as Sherlock Holmes in the Netflix sequel movie Enola Holmes 2, and head the all-star cast of Kingsman director Matthew Vaughnâs spy thriller Argylle. And Dec. 17, The Witcher returns for season two (with Cavill having just signed a new deal paying more than $1 million per episode, sources say). Thereâs also never-ending speculation that Cavill might be in line to play the most highly coveted character in action cinema â James Bond.\n\nFor his part, Cavill acts vaguely perplexed by all this. âSomething has changed, something has shifted,â he says of his busy coming slate. âAfter 21 years of hard work, I have three jobs lined up. Maybe itâs me, maybe itâs my approach, maybe my value as a commodity increases being attached to things like The Witcher. Now I can really focus on the storytelling and grow from here.â\n\nYou can read the full interview at The Hollywood Reporter!\n\nEsquire: What attracted you to the role of Geralt besides already having an interest in the medieval-fantasy genre and knowing The Witcher through the book and game adaptations?\n\nHenry Cavill: Iâd played the games extensively and enjoyed them enormously. But what really drew me to the character was Sapkowskiâs writingâthe way heâs written extraordinary characters that have so many layers and depth.[Geraltâs] a bit morbid at times. But heâs also a philosopher and intellectual; a white knight but also incredibly cynical. He tries to do the best thing but always ends up in terrible situations because of it. The cynicism comes from what heâs been through. Yet, he still continues to do what he thinks is the right thing. Heâs also quite funny at times and witty as well. In that, there are wonderful character moments throughout the books with opportunities to dive into that character as honestly as possible. That has drawn me to portray the live-action version.\n\nESQ: How do you depict notable character nuances of Geralt from both the book and games to make him familiar with the audience? And did you inject bits of yourself into this live-action adaption?\n\nCavill: For me, it has to have a fine balance. Because this is very much Lauren [Schmidt Hissrichâs] version of the story. So, itâs about me trying to bring as much of Geralt thatâs true to the books to fit into that storyâthat fine line of playing a character who is necessary for the plot and also trying to colour in as much of Sapkowskiâs character of Geralt into dialogue and behaviours. And then, of course, the editing process can alter the characterisation too. But for me, itâs finding that balance between Hissrichâs version of the story and bringing as much of Sapkowskiâs into that.\n\nESQ: The concept of destiny and fate makes recurring appearances like through the Law of Surprise and is even emphasised by Visenna (Geraltâs mother). Do you believe that itâll happen in real life too?\n\nCavill: Thereâs always the potential for it to happen. For that to be realised, one has to work towards it. It wonât happen if Iâm sitting on a sofa and not doing anything. But I am a bit of a romantic and I do like to believe in the idea of a state of destiny. I also think that it should be worked for as it wonât happen by itself.\n\nESQ: What did you learn from being Geralt after two seasons?\n\nCavill: For the first season, he didnât do much talking; he wasnât very vocal and verbal. Since this was the case, I thought, letâs try and make him not going to speak much [but] more of a watcher and listener instead. Thatâs my portrayal of his intellect and wisdom. Heâs between 90 [and] 100 years old after all, so heâs not going to be hyper like a young man and jump into a conversation unnecessarily.\n\nFor the second season, I wanted to portray that a little more. I pushed for sounding more intellectual and as someone whoâs actually got a plan and [an] opinion. Like a sense of wisdom. For me, Iâve been trying to convey that as much as I possibly can and create this paradigm character.\n\nESQ: Tell us about the dynamics of working with an expanded cast that was added for season two, particularly Geralt appearing with the witcher clan at his childhood home.\n\nCavill: I got some interactions with the witchers and others whom Iâve worked with previously. But there are a lot of new characters I would not be interacting with because the focus will also be on Cirilla and [sorcerer] Yenneferâs storyline too. With Geralt, it was about me trying to find those moments to assert the things that I loved in the book with the time that was allowed in Laurenâs version of the story. There are similarities to the book, but itâs loosely based on [Sapkowskiâs] Blood of Elves. So, thereâll be story points and events that can be even surprising for fans of the book.\n\nESQ: Youâve dealt with both magic CGI battles and hands-on combat on the show. Which do you prefer?\n\nCavill: I really enjoy doing the sword fights. That was a lot of fun for me. I think the magic aspect is fun too. But thereâs got to be a set of rules in place and it could be tricky to play around with magic. For now, I really love sword fights because of its wonderful storytelling potential. It could look absolutely fantastic if done right. Like with the Blaviken fight in season one that was arranged by stunt and fight coordinator Wolfgang Stegemann. This fantastic fight contains so much story although thereâs hardly any dialogue. So, I really love doing films where we get to do a different way of storytelling so people get absorbed in a way that is beyond dialogue.\n\nESQ: What are some of Geraltâs traits you identify with and why?\n\nCavill: One of Geraltâs traits that I identify with is that he always tries to do the right thing; his intentions are honest. Thatâs something Iâll definitely aim towards doing. But thankfully, I donât experience the same outcome as Geralt because he always ends up in trouble whenever he does it. I donât suffer from that same âcurseâ, fortunately."
