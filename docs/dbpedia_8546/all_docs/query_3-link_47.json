        "text": "US actor Robert Vaughn, star of The Man From U.N.C.L.E, has died of leukaemia at the age of 83, his manager has confirmed.\n\nVaughn played suave spy Napoleon Solo in the 1960s TV series and was also well known for portraying the skittish gunman Lee in the original The Magnificent Seven film.\n\nHe died after a brief battle with acute leukaemia, his spokesman confirmed.\n\nMatthew Sullivan, who represented him for 30 years, said: \"Mr Vaughn passed away with his family around him.\"\n\nThe actor is survived by wife Linda, son Cassidy and daughter Caitlin.\n\nVaughn was nominated for a best supporting actor Oscar and Golden Globe for his early role in The Young Philadelphians and in 2012 he became the first major American star to feature on British soap Coronation Street.\n\nHe played Milton, a wealthy American who met Sylvia Goodwin, played by Stephanie Cole, on a cruise.\n\nHustle\n\nHe became a familiar face on British television with his role in the BBC show Hustle, where he played conman Albert Stroller from 2004 to 2012.\n\nThe Man From U.N.C.L.E saw Vaughn's Solo paired with David McCallum's blond Russian Illya Kuryakin, in roles that were revived by Superman actor Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer for Guy Ritchie's big screen reboot in 2015.\n\nMr Sullivan said Vaughn was “the most wonderful human being”.\n\nHe added: “He had a blast doing Hustle for the BBC, he loved that show and him and Linda loved living in London, it was one of his greatest joys doing that show.”\n\nMr Sullivan added: “Even at 83, women would still come up to the table to talk to him.”\n\nHe said the star particularly enjoyed watching the reboot of The Man from U.N.C.L.E saying: \"He and Linda were living in Connecticut and the studio hired out an entire cinema for them to watch the movie.\n\n“He did enjoy it. He loved passing on what was next.”\n\nFellow spy\n\nSir Roger Moore, another actor best known for playing a spy, paid tribute, writing: \"Sorry to hear the news about Robert Vaughn.\"\n\nDirector Edgar Wright wrote on Twitter: \"RIP Napoleon Solo! The great Robert Vaughn was the coolest guy on TV when I was a kid. Superb in Bullitt, The Magnificent Seven & many more.\"\n\nStephen Fry added: \"Oh no. Robert Vaughn, such a fine actor, one of the best Columbo villains (no higher praise than that) & an utterly charming man, has died.\"\n\nGavin Free, who worked with him on Hustle, added: “Aw. RIP Robert Vaughn. I got to work with him on Hustle 5 years ago. He did his own slow mo stunts that day while in his late 70s.”\n\nCoronation Street senior writer Martin Sterling wrote: \"Sad to learn #RobertVaughn has died. I had the pleasure of meeting him while he was in Coronation Street and he was absolutely charming.\"\n\nVaughn, who was the last surviving member of The Magnificent Seven’s core cast, also had a starring role in Bullitt, again opposite Steve McQueen.\n\nHe carried on working well into his 80s, playing a dying father in Gold Star and starring opposite Matthew Broderick and Camilla Belle in The American Star, which were both released this year."
