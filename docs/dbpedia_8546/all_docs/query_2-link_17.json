If nothing else, hearing Murdock sing Sinatra is a very pleasant part of the episode. Probably about the only other part I really enjoy is when Murdock talks about being back in LA and later when BA tells Frankie he's getting nostalgic about being fugitives on the run. If only Stockwell really hadn't been recovered and they did have to go back to being fugitives on the run. Sadly, though, the team was successful (of course) at rescuing Stockwell and thus end up still under his control by the end of the episode. At least they got to do things \"their way\" in the episode rather than Stockwell's way.\n\nPost by Eclipse139 on\n\nJust rewatched this one. It was as odd as I remember. Basically trying to be an ep of The Man From Uncle, but with The A-Team. It didn't work as a concept, it felt like the team had just dropped into the wrong TV show!\n\nI remember enjoying The Man From Uncle back in the day and the novelty of seeing Robert Vaughn and David McCallum on screen together again was still fun - it would have been more fun if they'd been able to leave us with the possibility that they were playing the same characters, but of course it was obvious that they weren't so that opportunity was lost.\n\nI quite liked that the team realise they have to rescue Stockwell even though they hate him, or they'd lose their cover and his protection. It was interesting to see them consider their options.\n\nApart from that it's a really terrible episode!\n\nWeirdly, though, I'm not hating Frankie as much this time around. He's completely pointless as a character, other than to have a younger man in the team, but he's quite fun in a way.\n\nPost by HoudiniDerek on\n\nJust rewatched this one.

He's completely pointless as a character, other than to have a younger man in the team, but he's quite fun in a way.\n\nI'm thinking of adding MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. to my DVD collection. I have heard good things, but never seen it, so the whole storyline was lost on me.\n\nPost by Eclipse139 on\n\nPicking up my complete rewatch where I left off before Xmas means I rewatched this one again today. I think it improves with a second viewing - my biggest issue is too much Stockwell and not enough of the A Team. And he's not even a little bit grateful when they save him! Hannibal was very laid back throughout the whole ep which was nice to see, but you'd have thought he should not have been in such a good mood under the circumstances? Maybe he was just pleased to be back in control for a little while.\n\nA few different things struck me this time. Firstly, the name of the company the team were pretending to be employees of was 'Beller Air' - a reference to Bel Air, as in THE BATTLE OF BEL AIR, perhaps? Also, Frankie's cousin must've been shocked when Frankie just casually called and asked to borrow his mobile home/trailer, considering Frankie presumably disappeared off the face of the earth when he joined the team - I can't believe he's been able to have any contact with his family since it happened, or any opportunity to explain where he's been, or what's been going on.\n\nI thought it was a bit odd, when the baddies first burst into the hotel room, that it was Face and Murdock who had to fight them while BA didn't even try to help, he just sat and laughed at them! Before that, of course, it was even more odd that Face was apparently in bed with a random woman while BA sat in the next room just watching TV. Face definitely seemed to take things further (i.e. to bed!) with the random girls he dated in Season 5, compared to previous seasons. He was always a ladies man, but by S5 he has a habit of drifting into sleaze territory.\n\nSpeaking of Face, I thought the fact it was a novelty for him to be running a scam was quite sad. We said earlier in this thread that Murdock talked about how it was good to be back in LA and BA commented that he was nostalgic for being on the run, so all these things were quite poignant really. I wonder if the writers were having serious second thoughts about the altered premise of the show by this point?\n\nPost by amyk on\n\nA few different things struck me this time.

Hannibal portrays Mr. Beller, and he and Face are both pretending to be executives of Beller Air. The real Mr. Beller can't be reached - I think he went off fishing somewhere or something. Oh, wouldn't modern-day executives love to be \"unreachable\"?!\n\nSpeaking of Face, I thought the fact it was a novelty for him to be running a scam was quite sad.

I wonder if the writers were having serious second thoughts about the altered premise of the show by this point?\n\nI kind of wish they had Stockwell get killed off in this one and the team once again was just back on the run and part of the LA Underground! (Is that really terrible for me to wish a fictional character gets killed off?!?)"
