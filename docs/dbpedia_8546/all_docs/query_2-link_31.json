        "text": "And that was the last of them. 29 is a very strange number for a season of American TV, but that’s what The Man from U.N.C.L.E.‘s first year came up with and we’ve finally reached that point.\n\nI’ve been disappointed with the series, which has rarely lived up to my delighted memories, but I’m happy to say that the season went out on a high note, with a well-written, well-acted and almost wholly serious story, one that was dominated by its guest stars, Martin Balsam and Barbara Shelley, as two former agents re-uniting under the colours one final time. This gave the episode an elegant, elegiac overtone that, whilst completely uncharacteristic of the series, dealt with mixed emotions that left a tangible impression.\n\nThe episode opened with Ilya as a passenger on a plane, surreptitiously watching a mysterious passenger wearing a hat, moustache and dark glasses under dim light (dark glasses were in evidence throughout the episode with Ilya even commenting on their use under subdued lighting whilst in a Soho strip club that looked nothing like any Soho strip blub I’ve ever seen – on TV, I hasten to add!). When confronted by the pilot over a warning message that has been received, Monsieur Raymond, lifelong assassin, terrorist leader and master of disguise, shoots him with his camera, locks himself in the toilet and blows himself out of the plane with plastic explosive that he’s been using to keep his trousers up. Add to that a grenade disguised as an electric shaver and we look like we’re in for fun, not to mention a spiritual crossover with Danger Man.\n\nBut no. Raymond was due in London to meet with fellow terrorists to discuss a grand alliance to promote their aims in overthrowing Governments (later this will be portrayed as an ‘alliance with the left’, which is odd because that’s where most terrorists come from in the first place). We already know, from eavesdropping on Mr Zed (Ronald Long), that Raymond is against this so someone will have to impersonate him by turning up in London: it’s convenient that no-one knows Raymond’s true face.\n\nIn order to learn enough about Raymond to successfully do this, Mr Waverley leads Napoleon and Ilya to the home of retired U.N.C.L.E. Agent Albert Sully (Balsam), ex- of the Filing Section but, more pertinently of the OSS in WW2, where he had ample contact with the aforementioned Raymond. It’s implied that Sully was demoted to Filing because he was crap at Agenting, but the guy has the hankering to be back in the game. He won’t help tutor Napoleon on how to be Raymond, for one thing he’s too young. No, instead he’ll impersonate him himself. Caught over a barrel, Mr Waverley agrees.\n\nSully, wearing a false moustache and a hairpiece covering his high forehead, flies to London with our two top Agents keeping close watch on him. Napoleon surreptitiously attaches a homing pin to Sully’s trouser cuff, unaware that Ilya has already even more surreptitiously attached one to the man’s hatband, plus a microphone: one up to the Russian. This proves to be necessary as Sully gives them both the slip at the airport, having yet more surreptitiously than all stuffed Solo’s suitcase with bottles on liquor and dobbed him in at Customs.\n\nIs Sully a traitor? Is he playing a double-game? He heads straight for an unlikely pub where he puts on a deliberately comic cockney accent to order ‘half and half’ and ‘fish and chips’ which are delivered to him inside thirty seconds. There is a woman sat at a table, a middle-aged but still presentable woman, who has agreed to meet him there. She is Bryn Watson (Shelley), once an expert courier for the OSS, twenty years ago, and an old flame, now content in retirement, out of the game, a widow with two school-age children.\n\nBalsam and Shelley are superb in their contrasting roles. Together and alone they take over the episode, Sully eager to bring back the past, play the game once more, Bryn out of it and determined not to be sucked back in after so long. What their relationship was in the past is left to the audience’s imagination, quite briliantly so: Balsam and Shelley’s quiet enjoyment of each other’s company allows us to infer something that was once very strong and very secure, whether it be comradeship or romance.\n\nThis is where the shoe drops. Sully never met Raymond, never knew him, but Bryn did. He wants to pump her for every detail. This little bombshell upsets Napoleon, who is cleaerly aggrieved. Ilya just goes to the bar, orders and drains a pint of stout, without a Russian care in the world. As we knew shewould, Bryn joins the pack, to help keep Sully from instant exposure by feeding him info at every turn.\n\nThis is the second time we’ve been in the land of my birth in recent weeks and I’m bound to say that this time the programme does a better job of it. Admittedly, our Agents catch up with Sully by travelling in a New York taxicab, but they do manage to catch a proper British black cab when next they need transport, and the cab is driving on the left. There’s a real Policeman’s helmet on show, not to mention the ubiquitous red London bus (no doubt the same one from ‘The Gazebo in the Maze Affair’ two episodes back) and the show is actually populated with British actors with real British accents that are not comedy ones.\n\n‘Raymond’ is supposed to pick up his directions at Speakers Corner in Hyde Park. I have never been to Hyde’s Park but I nevertheless doubt the perfect authenticity of the scene. In the midst of his peroration, Mr Wye accuses ‘Raymond’ of going on to a certain Soho strip club. It gets a bit confusing here, as Wye is associated with Zed and so is Ecks, who’s supposed to kill ‘Raymond’ except that Napoleon and Ilya get to him first. They all run off to hop onto the bus, with its open platform at the rear. Wye catches the bus too and shoots Solo in the shoulder before the versatile Bryn smacks him sideways with her purse.\n\nThis surprised me, for the last episode, to take Robert Vaughn off the board about halfway through. This leaves David McCallum in charge en route to the strip club where a very attractive young lady does a hula dance whilst signalling an address to ‘Raymond’ using deaf-and-dumb hand signals that Bryn can read. Unfortunately, Sully then blows his cover by lighting up whereas Raymond is allergic to tobacco. They’ve already bluffed their way past the Baroness, an ex-lover of Raymond, with Bryn providing the cues and Sully improvising brilliantly. Now Ilya has to start a melee, claiming the Baroness is his wife, running off with her lover, punching the bodyguard onto a table of drunken sailors (whenever you want a melee, just add a table of drunken sailors), whilst the increasingly versatile Bryn – has she really been a housewife for twenty years? – rips the woman’s dress off (she wears a slip beneath it) and that’s that for her.\n\nSo despite Sully’s insistence that she stay in the cab with Ilya whilst he goes into the plush home of the meeting’s host, Mr Zed, Bryn insists on following and continually prompting him as to who it is he’s meeting (has she really been out of the game for twenty years?). Ilya spots that Zed has switched ‘Raymond’s blue badge for one stuffed with plastic explsive, but Sully’s going great guns by now and switches it back. Once Mr Wye spots Bryn however, the game is up. She welters him with her purseand a shooting match ensues, killing bodyguards galore through a locked door. Zed detonates the badge, except that it’s stuck behind his lapel, and Sully persuades the rest of the group that Zed was the traior. And he shuts down the alliance proposal.\n\nThe sting in the tale is that Sully then refuses to leave. As long as he can maintain his pose as Raymond, he can help direct the various groups into traps by U.N.C.L.E. and slowly reduce the menace. How long he will last is another matter. The question of whether he will last at all is not directly addressed.\n\nSo to the close. Napoleon is back, his left arm in an appropriate black sling. He and Ilya are flying back but first stop sat the pub to let Bryn, who has clearly been drinking more than she should at lunchtime, that their French colleagues report so far so good with ‘Raymond’. Shelley dismisses it: her pessimism is, we understand, well-justified. She anatomises Sully very succinctly as a man who cannot live without knowing that death is at his elbow, forwhom only risk enables him to live fully. She tells Messrs Solo and Kuryakin that they are that kind of man. She also challenges them to a game of darts but they’re smart enough not to play. As they shuffle out, Napoleon can only, weakly and ineffectually, deny her charge. We don’t believe him.\n\nA downbeat ending, played to the reality of the situation. When the screw turned, Sully and Bryn played to the height of their abilities, and frankly played a more real hand that the Men from U.N.C.L.E. It was that which made the episode, and both were exact and wonderful in their parts. For me, they outshone every other guest in the entire series.\n\nNext week we’ll have a change of series and of mood. The chances of getting later U.N.C.L.E. series to compare is still on the unlikely side of unlikely but who’s to say: I have Lottery tickets unchecked. It’s been a disappointment overall over twenty-nine weeks, but that’s the way it sometimes goes.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWith only two episodes left, I think that I am on safe ground in nominating this episode as the absolute worst of the first season. And I don’t think that I’m overly prejudiced by the story taking place in my own country, or rather that special version of England that exists only on American TV of a certain age that bears about as much resemblance to the land I live in as the surface of Neptune does to a bowl of Rice Crispies.\n\nIt’s absurdly easy to describe the plot. Seven years ago, former British Army General G Emory Partridge, played by George Sanders with a combination of condescending sang-froid and self-loathing that he is reduced to playing roles like this, had taken over and was running a small South American country until U.N.C.L.E., in the form of Napoleon Solo, overthrew him. Now he wants revenge.\n\nLeaving aside the unlikelihood of a Briton of Partridge’s generation and social level – the man is of the veddy highest class – having been christened Emory or, even less likely, retaining a first name reduced to an initial in the American manner, this is the closest we come to anything serious or realistic, if we exclude the fact that he’s waited seven years to do so. Still, they say that revenge is a dish best served cold, don’t they?\n\nThe open sets the scene, though not in a way that the scripter intended. Ilya in his sports car pulls up in the street outside Del Florio’s, though not in any manner that suggests he’s ever been introiduced to parking parallel to the curb. Hurriedly, he slides across to the pasenger seat and thrusts the door open, hitting the briefcase carried by a distinguished gentleman, who’s just passing, knocking it from his jand and spilling papers everywhere. Since Ilya’s legs are still under the driver’s wheel, he instantly understand that this is a contrived accident, that our favourite Russian is going to pocket one of the papers he hurriedly gathers and shoves back into the gentleman’s briefcase. Only he’s not. It’s a genuine accident, at least as far as Ilya is concerned. How Partridge has managed to to contrive it, except by gambling on Ilya acting like a complete dick, is impossible to see.\n\nCompletely unperturbed, Partridge brushes the incident off (you see, such class) and pleads a need to catch his bus. Ilya spots he’s left a book behind and goes chasing after the bus, jumping aboard to return the precious object, out of the goodness of his heart. He fails to spot, or at least attach any significance to the fact that the bus is a bright red London Transport double-decker mrked Eastsnout Express. Any possibility that this might be some sort of trap eludes him until he’s jabbed in the back of the neck with an umbrella tip and rendered unconscious. At which point, Partridge, eschewing any notions of cliche, instructs the bus driver using the words ‘Home, James’.\n\nInside U.N.C.L.E. headquarters, no-one seems in the least concerned that Ilya is an hour MIA. Mr Waverley simply assumes he’s lurking around the building somewhere, probably smoking a crafty Russian cigarette. That is until Partridge’s message is dropped off on Reception. For no apparent reason, it is a bird in a miniature artificial tree, playing a nonsensical recording. Despite the fact that the rest of the story will be completely free of turtle doves, French hens, calling birds and, thankfully, pipers piping, it is a partridge in a pear tree. The last hope that anything that will follow will make sense flies out the window.\n\nThe rest of the story takes place in England, in a place called Eastsnout. You may think me prejudiced but the very name offended me. We get Ilya being given a lengthy tour of Porlock Hall and its gardens, unbound and escorted only by a man in his Sixties and an unarmed butler and acting like escape is impossible. Perhaps he’s stunned into disbelief at what the writer has come up with, David McCallum being British after all. We’re talking the whole set-up, perfectly preserved Cromwellian manor house, unchanged since the Commonwealth (where they went around constructing manor houses every day of the week) except for the installation of electricity by the previous tenants that Partridge and his slightly dotty wife Edith (Jeanette Nolan) haven’t yet had time to rip out. Mrs Partridge is one of those fraying at the edges ladies who exist in a world of their own, always doting on handsome young men who can dance the rumba, preferably in military uniform. When you put it like that, no wonder Ilya can’t believe his eyes.\n\nThen there’s a maze. Of course there’s a maze, there’s always got to be a maze, and if you’ve surmised that it’s full of death-traps, to be seen at closer range in Act 4, take a tick on your homework. As assured to us by the episode title, there is a gazebo in the centre of the maze, giving access to dungeons beneath, equipped with all mod cons, such as a rack, an Iron Maiden, a bed of nails and of course a skeleton hanging from manacles on the wall. Ilya is manacled next to him. The chitchat is a bit one-sided.\n\nMeanwhile, back in New York, Mr Waverley has decided to follow this up, as opposed to, say, leaving Ilya in the lurch. It’s this kind of decision making that has got him to be U.N.C.L.E.’s Chief, folks. So Napoleon arrives in Eastsnout by train (steam, naturally, this is Britain in 1965). The locals are, as you would guess, sullen, taciturn and unhelpful, refusing to either taken him or give directions to Porlock Hall. Except for Partridge’s chauffeur, who tries the umbrella dodge again only to be beaten into unconsciousness by Napoleon, who steals the car and drives off in it, all under the nose of a station master (of a station that would have been one of the very first to have got the axe from Dr Beeching, earlier in the decade) whose on;ly response is a dismissive, “American tourists.”\n\nBecause he doesn’t know where the Hall is, Napoleon stops off at the Pub (he knew how to find that) where, oh surprise, no-one will even talk to him. The gamekeeper from the Hall is playing darts and regularly scoring triple bulls (one hundred and fifty!) with a dart-throwing action that can only be described as sidearm, which in real life wouldn’t send the dart high enough to hit within three feet of below the board.\n\nEnter the young woman. She is Peggy Durrance, played by Bonnie Franklin in what she thought was an English accent. Peggy is the glam for the episode though as glam goes she’s muted, what with her severely parted wig and low calf-length skirts that suggest we’re not missing anything. Peggy is the daughter of the late gamekeeper, who died as a result of a terrible accident (your imagination required here) and who, having nowhere to go and despite hating and fearing Partridge, stayed on at the hall as Companion to Edith (a usually unpaid position for spinsters combining the roles of chaperone and total dogsbody). Peggy will at least speak to Napoleon, even though her conversation is limited to the word ‘No,’ in response to his request to be directed to the Hall.\n\nNevertheless, and doubtless overwhelmed by his raw, sexual magnetism, she sneaks him in through security, shows him a secret passage to the dungeons that she knows abut but Partridge doesn’t (how? Don’t be silly). Napoleon followed her directions so faithfully he winds up first in Partridge’s study, then in the dungeon up against the wall, separated from Ilya only by the skeleton, and then on the rack, being tortured by Edith, who is more than she seems (she couldn’t possibly be less).\n\nYou see, what Partridge wants, to further progress his revenge on U.N.C.L.E., is for Napoleon to call Mr Waverley and have him come here, completely on his own. Yeah, sure, like that’s going to happy, El Supremo of U.N.C.L.E., head honcho, go to an operational scene dominated by a tricky enemy, withut bodyguards, security or even an elderly dachshund as back-up? Edith waves red hot poker not nearly near enough to the cute face of Peggy, Napoleon caves and Waverley agrees to be at Eastsnout Station in 24 hours, showing an appreciation of British Rail timetables that’s far faster than anything online.\n\nIt’s time to dispose of Napoleon, except that he grabs a broadsword from over the fireplace (the legendary one, used to kill the first Earl of Eastsnout, set up earlier by Sanders as the Gun in the First Act but here used as any old hunk of metal), fights off everyone, frees Ilya and Peggy, races through the maze evading the traps – taking time out to chide his Russian colleague for inattention by setting off the trap Ilya nearly set off and rather luckily failing to impale him on a spike – before arriving back at the gazebo (you see, what you do is to trail your hand along the left hand wall and yu will eventually get out) where Partridge is waiting with a shotgun to blast all three to smithereens.\n\nHow do our intrepid agents get out of this trap? Why, by Edith pushing open the trapdoor from below, even though she’s a woman in her late fifties at best and it’s got both a chair and George Sanders weighting it down, causing him to overbalance, the shotgun to miss everything and he to complain petulantly about her messing things up. Limp with relief, the audience applauds not having to watch any more of this outrageous tripe.\n\nBut that’s not all. The serious point, about how atrocious the story is, contemptuous of sanity, logic or anything to do with the way human beings behave, has been made simply by reciting the plot. I have barely had to exaggerate what happens in the slightest. I haven’t, however, yet mentioned a disturbing scene that introduced a weird psychosexuality to the plot, instantly forgotten, that had nothing to do wih Robert Vaughn. This occurred when young Peggy is found spying on the dungeon and gets chained to the wall. Suddenly, Partridge goes off on this bizarre rant at her, shouting “These wenches are all alike. … Don’t think I don’t know what you’ve been trying to do to me, flaunting yourself about the place, trying to catch my fancy.” It’s some kind of creepy fugue without the least support from anywhere in the rest of the episode, yet in a left-handed way it fits perfectly. There is nothing remotely sane about this evidence, as confirmed in the close when, Napoleon having forgotten to countermand Mr Waverley’s trip to England, wholly unprotected, his boss arrives on time, no-one to meet him and, after standing there for over an hour, borrows a bictcle, and bicycle clips, and turns up seeking an explanation that Ilya has already sensibly dobbed Napoleon in to deliver (serves you right for dropping Ilya in it in Paris, pal) whilst Ilya, blithely explaining that in the spy business you can’t trust anyone, drives off with Peggy who, in the space of twenty-four hours, has refreshed her wardrobe, learned to dress like a modern American girl, removed her wig and fluffed her hair up. It’s nuts, I tell you, completely nuts.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAs is abundantly clear by now, you just don’t know what to expect from an U.N.C.L.E. episode. This latest one needed a few more hours in the oven before being put on the table. It was, frankly, a bit meh.\n\nThe show succeeded in failing to hold my attention fairly early on. The angle is that THRUSH has been kidnapping scientists from different countries for quite some time, intending to build a spaceship with an atomic motor, to blackmail the world with (actually, they’d need to build a space station with which to do that but the writer has probably not read more than a handful of SF magazines for more than a veneer of colour to get that far).\n\nThe latest of these, an American scientist, who was 38 with the face of a 55 year old woman, has died on a plane from Boston to New York of a heart attack. Ilya who, for no disclosed reason, was following her with a homing device, steals practically everything but the body but, most importantly, the microfilm with secrets she was prepared to sell. Also, a ticket for the revivalist meeting that night hosted by Brother Love.\n\nNow the good brother is played by Eddie Albert, who I will always welcome thanks to his soon-to-start sitcom, Green Acres, in which he co-starred with Eva Gabor, but not here. Albert overplays manfully, even down to adopting a phoney Southern accent, but hypocritical Christian preachers are definitely not my bag, man, to drop into the argot of the time, which is where the episode left me. And mugging it up as he was, Albert just couldn’t get anywhere near the inanity/insanity of that type of character.\n\nEnter this week’s innocent. She is Pearl Rolfe, played brightly by Maggie Pierce, a sociology student from Hunter College researching phenomena of this kind, who’s sitting in the late scientist’s reseved seat for a better view. I liked Maggie Pierce, who brought a degree of fun to her role when even Robert Vaughn was to a large extent going through the motions, but the problem was that she was badly underwritten and given too little to do and was effectively useless to the story: if they’d built her part up a bit, or prefarably a lot more, this would have been a better episode.\n\nFor instance, Napoleon identifies her as being from Hunter College because she’s wearing black tights, a deductive leap that was lost on me. To prove his point, he pokes her leg, just below the knee. Given that he’d known her for no more than ninety seconds by that point, it might have built up Pearl’s character for her to react a little bit more realistically to this smooth creep fondling her leg as quickly as that…\n\nIncidentally, she, like Eddy Albert, would become a sitcom star that same year, playing Barbara Crabtree alongside Dick van Dyke’s younger brother Jerry in the justly forgotten My Mother the Car (don’t go there, just don’t go there) after which she has just one acting credit.\n\nAs it was, Pearl was pretty much outshone by the other two main female roles, those of minor recurring U.N.C.L.E. Agent Sarah Johnson (Leigh Chapman), the most competent and clearly efficient Agent in the episode and vampish society gossip colum,nist and Brother Love’s shag, Magda no-last-name (Tracey Roberts, who was 50 years old but didn’t look it). Brother Love, in case you hadn’t already guessed, was the THRUSH satrap – they hit the American audience in 1965 with the word ‘satrap’: was that even legal? – behind the project.\n\nSo: Solo gets captured trying to make sure Pearl is alright but cons Love into thinking he’s the scientist’s lab assistant and errand boy, Ilya gets run off the road by a grenade and drops out of the second half – and after he’d gone all beautifully proletarian at the sight of a society bluebloods’ garden party – and Solo saves the day by blowing up the helicopter taking Eddie Albert and the project notes and designs to a secret island that’s so secret no-one has any idea where it is, especially now Brother Love has discovered whether he is to live forever forever after.\n\nWe wind up with Pearl giving Napoleon an enthusiastic smooch at the airport before leaving him to go off with his true life partner, Ilya, who gets to crack a weak pun, but not the last word, which must be part of Robert Vaughn’s contract.\n\nLike I said, meh, but a bit more Maggie Pierce would have been more enlivening. There are only three more of these left.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThere were a great many reasons for regarded this next episode of The Msan from U.N.C.L.E. with exasperation, if not disdain, most of them to do with the plot, but on the strength of one single guest performance of great delight, I’m prepared to give it a free pass. Silly though it was in its combination of a serious, albeit standardised espionage plot with high and daffy comedy, it was much more in the mould of the U.N.C.L.E. I remember from those glorious We4dnesday nights in the Sixties and the Friday tea-times of the Nineties.\n\nThis was definitely an episode in which our redoubtable Section 2 pair of Napoleon Solo and Ilya Kuryakin were overshadowed by the two Guest Stars, both of whom I was, for once, very familiar with. The one was Cesar Romero, as Victor Gervaise, head of THRUSH’s French Division, here in New York to retrieve a list of his compromised top men. Amazing as it may seem, this was the first time I’d seen Romero’s face onscreen: until now I’ve only ever seen him as The Joker in Batman, behind white face-paint (including his moustache), green hair and extravagant red lipstick. Gervaise is all suavity and sardonicness, sliding through his every scene as smoothly as a surfer on a mill-pond.\n\nBut the other Guest Star bossed the show, overshadowing everyone else in a combination of proto-geek ditziness and a surprising level of guts and determination, not to mention looking good in her black page-boy hairstyle and supposdly unsexy black-rimmed glasses, for this was the wonderful Barbara Feldon, shortly to commence her career as Agent 99, partner to Don Adams in the hilarious Get Smart.\n\nThe story is that U.N.C.L.E. has obtained a list of the names and addresses of 12 top THRUSH agents in France, which Gervaise wants back to eliminate them, as opposed to having to eliminate the entire operation to be on the safe side. Ilya’s carrying the list but unfortunately THRUSH have found him (hardly surprising: all they had to do was look for the guy lurking and sneaking, hiding behind cars and nipping round corners). A new special courier, perhaps one who knows how to look inconspicuous, is needed to carry the microdot.\n\nCue Mandy Stevenson (Felton). For once, our Innocent of the Week is an U.N.C.L.E. Agent herself. But no ordinary Agent. Mandy is tall, slim, with long legs insufficiently displayed. She’s also a specialist Portuguese Translator, bored out of her skull translating Brazilian weather reports and constantly sneaking up on our man Solo to try to convince him to send her on a field mission. Solo just as constantly refuses, knowing Mandy isn’t the kind of characte who can do it. On the other hand, when Mr Waverley needs someone to visit his tobacconist and refill his old and valuable humidor with his special mix, Solo reinvents this as a vital mission, to be taken super-seriously using ‘Evasion Pattern 8’, hinting that the humidor is wired to explode if the wrong person opens it, and sends Mancy on her way, complete with spy-like trenchcoat and her contact lenses in.\n\nAnd of course, in a perfectly natural manner for such a serious, efficient spy organisation, a misapprehension ensues and Mandy gets the microdot.\n\nWhat folows is an incredibly daft chase as THRUSH agents by the dozen pursue Mandy, two of them disguised as Ice Cream men (from Hotsy Totsy Ice Creams – I ask you, who’s going to buy a cold concoction from someone advertising itself as Hotsy?). Napoleon and Ilya shoot up a quartet of them in a cinema shoeing a war film with no-one noticing. Mandy runs into Gervaise, who helps her replace her missing contact lenses in a manner that completely disregards hygene, unaware that she’s his quarry.\n\nBut our plucky girl Agent is taken after all and, despite Gervaise employing his Gallic charm in a manner that suggests he is genuinely attracted to our geeky Goddess (why not? I was), he starts trying to get out of her the information he wants. But there is much more to Mandy than has, deliberately, met the eye so far. Sure, she isn’t and never will make a field agent, though her mistakes wouldn’t look out of place against our two Good Guys, but there’s a determination not to bend, a refusal to be scared and a solid core of grit to the girl that may be partially built on an ignorance of what can really be done by way of interrogation, but which makes her all the more appealing.\n\nThe ending was pretty funny too. Gervaise’s American underling sets up a trap for the U.N.C.L.E. reinforcements that will blow them all, including Mr Waverley, to buggery. Solo, hand-cuffed and tied to an office chair, kicks himself across the room, knocking the underling half out of the window, grabs a gun and, with it behind his back whilst staring into a mirror, gets the drop on Gervaise. Gervaise decides to call his bluff and Solo shoots him through the shoulder: shocked at his success, Napoleon nevertheless claims the credit for his much-practiced accuracy…\n\nOh, but it was fun. In the hands of a lesser delight than Barbara Feldon, I expect it would have dissolved into the incoherent mess the story actually was and I’d have been writing frustrated and disdainful stuff, but Feldon was perfect, and I want a complete boxset of Get Smart, mow, this minute, to savour how good she was as Don Adams’ foil. Really, she was wasted on Robert Vaughn and David McCallum.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThis was a joke, right?\n\nIt’s not actually a real Man from U.N.C.L.E. episode, it’s a spoof, some sort of piss-take of the series that tried to show it up by combining a terrible plot lacking any kind of logic or credibility with bad acting, in which Robert Vaughn and David McCallum agreed to appear to send up their U.N.C.L.E. characters out of a generous spirit (or because the producers had some serious blackmail evidence on each of them). And the DVD makers agreed to include it on the box set, just to show that they could take a joke against themselves. That’s it, isn’t it? Because it’s the only explanation that makes any real world sense.\n\nI genuinely don’t know where to begin in addressing this episode. It’s set in Hong Kong revolved around an independent spy ring specialising in stealing secrets, mostly American ones, and selling them to suspicious parties. The ring is run by someone calling themselves Apricot, who manifests mostly as a stupid Samurai statue with light-up eyes giving inmstructions to chief underling Cleveland (Gavin McLeod, yes, him off The Love Boat but also, more reputably, The Mary Tyler Moore Show). Apricot is selling something incredibly valuable. No-one knows what it is, nor why it’s valuable, they just take her word that it is, the way super-senior espionage agents do, you know.\n\nActually, it’s a shilling, an American pine tree shilling, a rare and valuable coin though not valuable enough for all this fuss, but it’s only a facsimile, made from the indestructible alloy American uses for rocket nosecones (why, and so what?). As for Apricot, who’s very obviously a she despite all the mystery, her day job is as a sampan girl in the harbour, and the episode’s ending is that she had the missing coin all along, it having been given to her by the courier, Max Wenzel (Joe Perry), a slob.\n\nWhy has it been trusted to Max? Why does he hand this precious object to a sampan girl? How does he expect to get it back? This episode raises questions like this but offers no answer to any of them because it’s a mess.\n\nAnyway, Ilya, disguised as a barefoot rickshaw driver and Napoleon, disguised as Napoleon Solo, agent of U.N.C.L.E., are out to take down Apricot. For this they enlist the aid of a, for once, male innocent, one Bernie Oren, played by Guest Glenn Corbett, ex-Marine, eager to get involved because he’s fallen in instant lust with the other guest star, Karen Sharpe, playing Heavenly Curtelle.\n\nNow the only sane bit about Heavenly, whose name has been lifted from half a hundred cheap James Bond knock-offs, is that she does indeed inspire lust, only in prime-time TV 1965 it’s got to be love. She’s introduced wearing one of those tight Chinese silk dresses with extensive slits up the outside of the skirt section, causing her to show more length of leg than any other female guest star to date and in fact several of them put together. For the more fashion conscious, this type of dress is apparently called a cheongsam, and Heavenly loves it so much she doesn’t change out of it all episode, even after she dives into the harbour in it to rescue Bernie and Solo. I have no rooted objections to that.\n\nBut Heavenly is a baddy. Never mind that Heavenly is not a Chinese name or that the lady speaks with an indefinable accent which, by the end, is pure UK English, never mind that the actress is a Texan lady, is she a baddie or a goodie? She plays the baddie but in the end she’s revealed as a Lieutenant in the hogh Kong Special Services division, so it’s going to be perfectly alright for Bernie to lengthen the slits in her cheongsam until they meet at the neckline, but only after they’re legally married by the rites of the Episcopalian Church, she being from Hong Kong.\n\nIs there anything else? Apart from Cleveland and Apricot’s chief seven feet tall thug being called Merry and being played by Richard ‘Jaws’ Kiel? Well, unfortunately, yes. I thought we’d hit rock bottom with Police Sergeant Fauntleroy (oh dear god), who would need to spend a month’s no expenses paid holiday in the middle of the Sahara to be a drip, but that was before we hit a true nadir with the arrival of the new bidder for this fabulous whateveritis, a Mongolian Warlord named Toqtamish Kipchak.\n\nThis ridiculous and completely unrealistic caricature is the pits. Every TV set in mongolia must habve been switched off in an instant. What’s worse, apart from the fact he’s Ilya pretending again, is that his dialogue is being played through an obvious electronic filter which makes him sound as if he’s speaking from a cheap studio four and a half blocks away, and no-one reacts in the slightest. (It’s down to bloody awful overdubbing, David McCallum having had to speak through a prostethic mask which he takes great delight (and relief) in ripping off as soon as he’s exposed.)\n\nAnd the final scene had to be hurriedly re-written, and turned into something with far more heavy sexual overtones, when Glen Corbett, requitred to fall through a skylight, missed the padded landing, hurt his back and had to go into hospital: hence his double and Karen Sharpe disappear behind a bar with only her waving hand to show, suggesting she’s screwing the fuck out of him.\n\nAny more? This really is a shitshow and by itself makes a compelling case for not keeping the box set, in case you accidentally put it on again. I am led to believe that part of its tone was down to it being a pilot for a new series (surely a back-door pilot then) but I can find no confirmation of this and since the only new series could have been one featuring Bernie and Heavenly in Hong Kong, I don’t see the series potential in that, though if Ksaren Sharpe were to wear a cheongsam and dive fully-clad into the harbour every week…\n\nThe only consolation is that next week’s has got to be better.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI have mixed feelings about ‘The Brain-Killer Affair’, which is highly regarded among Man from U.N.C.L.E. fans, but which didn’t impress me to quite the same degree. The story was built upon the idea of Mr Waverley being poisoned by THRUSH in order to subject him to a brain operation, using a fantastic machine invented by Dr Agnes Dabree that will impair his mental functions, leading to him making stupid errors that will bring U.N.C.L.E. down from within.\n\nAn interesting idea, let down slightly by the ease with which Waverley, one of the most important figures in maintaining the security of the World, gets poisoned in a posh club, drinking cognac and playing chess, by a waiter in the pay of THRUSH. Admittedly, he’s got our man Solo sat less than twenty feet away, reading the Saturday Evening Post (a real copy, apparently) but this is security?\n\nAnd Waverley promptly gets rushed to the Hobart Clinic, which happens to be staffed by Drs Dabree and Elment, Nurse Flostone and all manner of big, hulking orderlies and pretty nurse/receptionists, all of whom are agents of THRUSH, not that U.N.C.L.E. knows anything of this. And though they flood the place with their own security, I would have thought that in a crisis situation like this, so big it has its own code (Situation 20A), I’d have thought that would mean more than two Agents, plus Ilya popping in and out.\n\nBut what interested me most was the number of connections I made from outside the episode, via the guest players.\n\nThe only one to make it into the credit sequence as a Guest Star was Dr Dabree, who was played by Elsa Lanchester, yes, the Elsa Lanchester, the Bride of Frankenstein herself. For a moment I was astonished, until I remembered that this episode was first broadcast in 1965, making it a matter of a mere thirty years since Lanchester’s classic starring role. In terms of an actress’s life, it’s nothing unusual, yet it also made me think of the distance from the early Frankenstein films with their simple yet Gothic horror, to the sophistication and slickness of 1965. Lanchester’s acting demonstrated that: she was all OTT melodrama, creepy and cracked, as if she had never left Frankenstein’s castle in the first place. Not very Sixties.\n\nThe spur towards solving the matter was Waverley’s last conscious words after being poisoned: three names, Farmington, Nikos Korzos and Nils Bergstrom, and what’s initially believed to be ‘Have dead’ but which is actually half-dead. Farmington is the career diplomat Waverley was playing chess with, who’s made a series of terrible blunders, Korzos is a shipping magnate who’s business has utterly collapsed due to a series of terrible blunders, leading to his committing suicide, and Bergstrom…\n\nBergstrom doesn’t fit the pattern. He’s a near catatonic of four years’ standing, who occasionally likes to bash simeone over the head with a sledgehammer, who’s being looked after by his younger sister Cecille, an attractive girl with shoulder-length black hair who supports them making $4 an hour refurbishing mannequins. I liked Cecille a great deal, even though she was played a bit too much as the sparky yet annoying kid sister who hasn’t grown up yet. Because I’m not used to seeing the lady with her hair down like that, it took me until the closer, when she’s got her hair up, dancing with Napoleon at a fancy restaurant, to recognise her as Yvonne Craig, she of Batgirl fame only a couple of years later.\n\nAnd then there was Mr Gabhail Samoy. Mr Samoy is another member of Section 1, based in U.N.C.L.E.’s Eastern Division, the leaders, directors, policy-makers, brought to New York to replace Waverley. He’s a philsophical Indian, turbaned and confined to a wheelchair, browned up. This time I needed the credits to recognise him as Abraham Sofaer, the Judge and Surgeon from one of my favourite ever films, A Matter of Life and Death.\n\nAnd that was not the end of it, though the fourth connection was one I did not know of until after. One of Waverley’s two protectors at the hospital, was a very tall, very solid black Agent named Jason. He was played by Roosevelt ‘Rosey’ Grice, football player turned actor and singer. He would be the man who wrestled the gun from the hand of Sirhan Sirhan in 1968, the assassin of Bobby Kennedy. Sobering thought. Thank God we cannot see what is to come to us.\n\nOddly enough, though this episode didn’t go out until very late in the series, according to imdb it was actually only the third to actually be filmed, and the second to feature Ilya, who’s in serious, steamy and sinister mode throughout, long before the series really worked out how to play him.\n\nThere are a lot of ins and outs before Waverley gets saved. Dr Dabree short-sightedly falls down an elevator shaft, Dr Elmont has his brain softened when Cecille, despite being bound and gagged and her blouse straining mightily to keep her intact, hops across the room and pushes the button with her cute nose, and the names and addresses spilt by Waverley under hypnotic duress turn out to be fakes he’s been pre-programmed to give out if ever this happens (damn clever these Red Chinese – I’m sorry, U.N.C.L.E.) so all’s well that ends well.\n\nExcept… Dr Dabree was not found at the bottom of her liftshaft, nor was the beauteous Nurse Flostone. No, she’s spirited the fanatical Doctor saway, having first splinted and bandaged all the broken bits. Lanchester is still in full flow, promising Flostone that she will seek revenge on Napoleon Solo for her, she will not rest…\n\nBut though she kept acting until 1980, by when she was in her late seventies, neither Elsa Lanchester nor Dr Dabree, nor Nurse Flostone, made good on that threat, as it was clearly decided that, THRUSH itself as an umbrella organisation excepted, the series would not deal in recurring villains. Pity.\n\nOverall, a good and solid episode. I wouldn’t call it a classic myself, but it did keep stupidity to a minimum, it kept its momentum up, it threw a lot at the wall, pretty much all of which stuck and I have never found it a burden to look at Yvonne Craig for forty-five minutes. I’d have preferred her to be in colour, though.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWhen you’re uncertain about a series you’re watching, and an episode entitled ‘The Bow-Wow Affair’ turns up in front of you, it takes a strong stomach to actually go and press play. Happily, I’m glad I did.\n\n‘The Bow-Wow Affair’ was a refreshing change of pace, being more or less a David McCallum solo, and featuring a lot more of Leo G. Carroll than we’re used to seeing, including an exclusively second roleto set up the story. There is only a nominal amount of Robert Vaughn, laid up with a sprained knee, not incurred in the course of a desperate mission but instead the charming notion that he got it tripping over the hitherto and thereafter never-mentioned U.N.C.L.E. cat.\n\nStill, as it gets him stuck with spending his time with one of headquarter’s legion of attractive women in severe and close-cut grey blouses, knee-length dark skirts and holstered guns in the smalls of their backs, we assume he got along fine. (Apparently, Vaughn was also studying for a degree at the same time he was filming U.N.C.L.E. and was worn down, hence his being given an easy week).\n\nThe plot is a non-security affair. A mysterious gypsy type named Andre Delgrovia (Paul Lambert), who likes to sneak around people’s gardens in a long black high-collared cloak, doing low-rent Dracula impersonations, is determined to take control of a company called Andram Consolidated (why? Because). To do this he is trying in a very unsubtle fashion to terrorise every holder of the stock into selling it to him at a fraction of its value, by threatening them with death. Death, or at least serious, life-thretening injury, by making their dogs tuen on them and bite them in the throat. What happens if a stockholder doesn’t own a dog? Every stockholder in Andram has to own a dog, its a tradition, or perhaps an old charter.\n\nU.N.C.L.E., or rather the temporarily quasi-freelancing Ilya, gets involved because the latest target is Quentin Lester Baldwin, cousin to Mr Waverley, and holder over his head of a slight indiscretion involving a young lady when Waverley was young, carefree and free-wheeling. Baldwin is, naturally, being played by Carroll as well, in a much more light-hearted, hail fellow well met manner than we’re useful. Ilya arrives at his mansion in time to be let in by his pretty, flirtatious blonde niece, Ursula Alice Baldwin (played rather delightfully by Susan Oliver – the Green Girl from Star Trek TOS) in the midst of a fortune telling being conducted by mysterious dark-haired gypsy henchwoman of the Dracula impersonator Delilah Dovro (Antoinette Bower, later to be seen in a well-padded out black swimsuit), which is rather a lack-of-fortune telling since she’s predicting death, here in this house, tonight. Which duly comes about thanks to Baldwin’s Great Dane.\n\nBut pretty fixated-on-Ilya Alice inherits the stocks and therefore the death threats, leading to a running, jumping and shooting episode of no great significance, a more than usual reliance on the facetiousness pedal and generally some good, dumb fun.\n\nThere is one great plothole – some say that Alice herself is a plothole though Susan Oliver is too pretty for me to subscribe to that theory – in that after Baldwin’s death, Ilya opens Channel D and requests all the information they’ve got on Delgrovia and Delilah Dovro. U.N.C.L.E. has Delgrovia’s name but it has nothing, not even a name, on Delilah.\n\nYet later in the episode, when Ilya and Alice visit an eccentric dog expert (Guido Panzini, played by Pat Harrington Jr, who regularly performed as the character inTV comedy sketches) the funny-foreign-accent Doctor has Delilah’s address as the owner of the two Doberman Pinschers who’ve lately been eyeing up the Russian and the prototype Manic Pixie Dream Girl’s throats.\n\nThat one’s obvious. In other respects, the episode blithely skates across the reality of whether a chihuahua could actually inflict wounds serious enough to warrant cosmetic surgey on its ageing but still game and flirtatious owner, and in addition to why Delgrovia wants to control Andram, who he is and where he goes when he’s not issuing crass and stupid threats (we never see him in front of a mirror so, hey, maybe the Dracula fixation isn’t just a cheap bit of imagery).\n\nSo, overall, on a critical level, this definitely deserves a Must Try Harder, but it gets a pass from me for putting Ilya up front, for Susan Oliver being a delight to see at all times, and for some snappy dialogue – everybody quotes Ilya’s opening line, in response to Solo asking if he is free: no man who has to work for a living is free. But I am available – plus a point for the invisible cat. Does every U.N.C.L.E. headquarters have one?\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI wasn’t prepared for an episode like this, not after last week’s schtumer. Not with a title like that, which sufggested some kind of absolute disaster. But this is The Man from U.N.C.L.E.‘s first season where the name of the game is inconsistency. On imdb, last week’s episode rates 7.3. Next week’s rates 7.1. This episode rates 8.9, and deservedly so.\n\nOne intriguing aspect of this story was that it was a forerunner of the Star Trek ‘bottle’ episodes (i.e., ship-in-a-bottle). Apart from an opening scene in Central Park, and another brief scene in the street outside, practically the entire episode takes place inside U.N.C.L.E.’s headquarters.\n\nIt starts with an attack. A mysterious, cheery, whistling, goofy-looking guy (Richard Haydn as Mr Hemingway), gets two kids to hold the wings of his remote controlled model plane until he has it take off. It’s targetted at U.N.C.L.E. headquarters, it beats all their security, it crashes on the roof. And doesn’t blow up. Instead, it carries a note which reads, “Boom. You’re dead”.\n\nThe whole organisation is rattled, and rightly so. There’s a secret conference of World Leaders in HQ that evening, one of the highest importance. Security is paramount. As well it should be. Agent Riley of the Bomb Detection department is delayed due to a Doctor’s appointment, with Dr Egret (unrecognisable as Lee Meriweather of the Batman movie). He’s perfectly healthy alright: he and she are THRUSH Agents working to the culmination of a long plot to utterly destroy U.N.C.L.E.’s credibility and effectiveness.\n\nAnd it’s ingenious. Having learned that the Conference room was being renovated, THRUSH has infiltrated the furniture: the entire tabletop is not wood or whatever they used for such things in 1965, but instad a half-inch layer of plsstic explosive, detonated by heat. It’s been standing there, harmless, unsuspected, for months. Riley will today replace the ashtrays (filthy habit) with special ashtrays, also made of a different type of plastic explosive. Once triggered by a lower heat, a stubbed out cigarette, within fifteen seconds this will trigger the tabletop to blow, kill everyone in the room, and take out the entire floor.\n\nSo now we have two threats, one deadly serious, the other more playful. The trickster Mr Hemingway’s next move is to smear mustard from a hotdog down the dress of a woman in the street outside Del Florio’s, hustle her into the cleaners, away from the fiance she’s marrying tomorrow, get her to stripdown to her shift (behave yourself, this is not that kind of programme though, no disrespect to Zohra Lampert as Kay Lorison, I’d rather it had been Lee Meriweather) and precipitate her into headquarters to scream in embarrassment in a way women no longer do in tv series.\n\nThis distracts Messrs Solo and Kuryakin, who need to take seriously the possibility that she is a threat with a good cover story rather than the slightly gawky, sadly dull shopgirl Kay really is, who’s marrying a sadly dull man. Kay thinks she’s fallen down the rabbit hole into a madhouse, and from her point of view she’s actually right, but what’s going on is serious. Deadly serious. Hemingway has already gone wandering freely, without a security badge, through headquarters and now the taps start pouring not merely water but guppies (note in basement: Yikes. You’re Poisoned).\n\nI should have guessed. Hemingway was too much the Trickster. Each of his assaults could have been deadly, but they weren’t. That’s because the man is a Professor of Logic, and Mr Waverley’s brother-in-law, asked by Waverley to stir up security on the day of the Meeting, have everyone on their toes and, incidentally, prove that U.N.C.L.E. security is high-tech and high-powered for the fantastic attacks and has completely – and plausibly – overlooked the mundane: it’s utilities.\n\nThere’s still Riley and the tabletop bomb to deal with. One of his team has suspected something and had to be killed (the application of Chekhov’s principle, the highly elaborate fountain pen that delivers a brain-crushing ultrasonic shock that is revealed in the First Act and duly goes off in the Third). Solo and Kuryakin play a game of nerves in the Conference Room and of course it is Kay who triggers things. Nervous, she decides to smoke. Tense, she stubs her cigarette out in an ashtray…\n\nRiley can’t take it, hurls it off the table top. He runs, with everyone in pursuit. Hemingway’s electronic scrambler, based on the same principles as a television remote as he carefully explains, traps him in an elevator where, confronted by Solo, his attempt to use the highly elaborate fountain pen that delivers a brain-crushing ultrasonic shock but ends up getting himself with it: the only unworthy moment of the episode since it’s such a cheap cliche, even 57 years ago.\n\nSo Kay can go back to her safe, secure, dull life and her safe, secure, dull fiance, about whom she’s having second thoughts. until she sees him scrapping with two New York cops, determined to find her. It’s been a far from safe, secure, dull day but she’ll never forget it, and Walter’s looking a lot more palatable than he was thirty seconds ago so it looks like that marriage will go ahead after all.\n\nOverall, this was a beautifully balanced episode, with an intricate plot that handled several different strands perfectly, and which was developed with an eye to a level of comedy that brushed against silliness without once detracting from the true danger. 8.9 at the least.\n\nAnd I am now trepidatious as to next week’s 7.1 rating…\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nOne way or another, ‘The Yellow Scarf Affair’ had to impress me this week. It was a test episode, a test of the first season. I’ve been teetering on the edge for some time, as these reviews have been indicating, and starting to lean to one side, and this episode was to stand for whewther or not I would keep the boxset when I reach the end or offer it up to the mercies of eBay. The test failed.\n\nThe episode started two strikes down. Firstly, there was no David McCallum, so no-one for Robert Vaughn to spark off. That role was given to guest star Linden Chiles, who played Solo’s rival in the pursuit of a seeming typewriter case that instead contained an experimental lie detector machine: this was a disaster. The other strike was that the episode was supposed to be set in India, which meant, with the notable exception of female guest star Kamala Devi as Dierdre Purbhani, a lot of caucasian actors browning up. This included Polynesian actress Neile Adams, the first wife of Steve McQueen, as the only other female role of significance.\n\nThat bit was awkward. The clothing, the mannerisms, the way of speaking, the obviously white features beneath the make-up: all of these combined to create an air of condescension. It felt completely inauthentic, as if the writers had decided not to bother with the hard work of showing its homegrown audience what India actually was, and just fed them the cliches they would expect to see.\n\nIn that context, the fact that the plot turned on a revival of the thuggee cult of Kali was much less offensive than it might otherwise have been to these Western eyes.\n\nLet me outline the story. Basically, U.N.C.L.E. has developed this infallible portable lie detector, which has been stolen by THRUSH but recovered by agent Duncan McAlister, who is killed on his flight thuggee style, by a strangling silk cloth, traditionally yellow. The plane crashes and everyone aboard it is killed. Solo is sent to investigate and retrieve the McGuffin-with-a-silly-name, posing as an Insurance Agent for a compsany that happens to have the initials U.N.C.L.E. Tom Simpson also claims to be an Insurance Agent interested in McAlistair: who he is and who he represents is never explained, which is sloppy. We’d normally assume he was THRUSH but he’s too big a clown to fit that bill.\n\nNow the plane has crashed, killing everyone aboard. All the bodies have been retrieved, except for four who have melted away. Despite the fact this is a plane crash, all the bodies are completely recognisable and all the luggage has been retrieved with no more than scuff marks on it.\n\nMaking further enquiries with an insultingly racist caricature of an Airline manager, Solo meets the beautiful Dierdre, a stewardess who is feeling guilty because, at the last minute, she was bumped from the fatal flight. She can remember all the passengers and, later on, will spot a woman she is certain got on the plain. This is Sita Chanda, played by Adams, who was a right little sexpot. She’s also wearing McAlistair’s family oversized ring, with an embossed green lion on it, so bloody big it must have rendered his left hand unusable (green lions don’t sound that bloody Scottish to me), which was supposedly lost in the crash.\n\nNeedless to say, Miss Chanda denies everything, even down to flying anyhere ever, but having been thus identified, she gets the yellow scarf treatment, lying half in, half out of her hotel bathroom so that we do not see any strangulation marks but can get a generous look at her bare legs.\n\nLet’s wrap this up. Deirdre happens to be the niece of an ex-Maharajah who prefers the days before Independence and the Republic, and who only happens to be the guy who’s revived the thuggee sect, initially to rake in the money but since then for the thrill of killing in the name of Kali. Solo’s for the scarf, and so too is Deirdre since she won’t join the cult (which, if I understand it correctly, was men only) , but he buys time by pointing out the typewriter case as immensely valuable. It’s got 10 pounds of gelignite stuffed into its lock for those who try opening it without the key, so Solo balances it on his palm, threatening to drop it and blow them all to buggery if he, Deirdre and Simpson, who’s just turned up, don’t walk out of there unmolested.\n\nWhich becomes a farce when the thuggee thugs pile in on them and Solo spends a lot of time whacking extras with this bloody delicate case until the Police turn up, firing blanks into the ceiling. How they got through the secret entrance is just one more loophole in a plot that holds together less well than crochet.\n\nFrankly, this was a real balance-toppler and, short of thirteen perfect, flawless episodes from here to the end of the season, this boxset is going on eBay as soon as I;ve watched episode 29. I watched it in a mood of exasperation which was brought on by the opening scene. This centred on McAlistair in the Delhi Airport departure lounge. He’s approached by a typical late middle-aged shapeless American housewife/tourist wh, after a couple of cryptic exchanges, does the exchange to get him the McGuffin. Who she is, who she’s working for, how she’s got the McGuffin from THRUSH, how on Earth someone like that can be an Agent of, well, anyone, is completely ignored. On the other hand, she’s played by Madge Blake, who is verysoon to be cast as Aunt Harriet in the Batman TV series, which is considerably more interesting than the rest of the episode put together: apparently, she’ll return in another 1965 episode.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIt’s now reached the point where, each week, I approach The Man from U.N.C.L.E. wondering which version of the series I’m about to get. ‘The Deadly Decoy Affair’, which marks the exact halfway point of thr first season, did not exactly start propitiously: the by now standard opening credits got as far as the bullets splintering the unbreakable glass behind which Napoleon is shielded and over which the episode title comes up, but this time, Robert Vaughn stepped and addressed the audience directly about how in this episode U.N.C.L.E. goes up against THRUSH, ‘that nasty international criminal organisation’, and invites us to see just how nasty they are this week. Cringe, cringe!\n\nI’m indebted to imdb for reasurance that this will never happen again, but it’s so appalling an introduction that the episode now has a thousand feet of climbing to do just to reach ground level. However, the story is a straight and serious one, before being given the U.N.C.L.E. treatment.\n\nU.N.C.L.E. has captured senior THRUSH official Egon Stryker (Ralph Taeger), third in their hierarchy. Mr Waverley is personally taking him to Washington, where he has a prior engagement with the CIA, but THRUSH want their man back. They have New York Headquarters surrounded, and their first attempt is only foiled by the fortuitous arrival of Solo and Kuryakin in the garage – they haven’t even ‘clocked on’ yet.\n\nWaverley plans to catch THRUSH out by a diversionary tactic that’s too simple for them to credit. He will travel under armed guard with a decoy, an agent made over to be identical to Stryker, even down to his heavy limp with his left foot. Solo and Kuryakin will deliver the real Stryker, travelling as unexceptional, ordinary people, under the radar.\n\nIt isn’t that sinple. THRUSH isn’t to be taken in by something like that. The recovery is being overseen by Mr Narum (Edward Mallory, very effective as a white-haired blind man behind great dark glasses, talking in a very sinister even tone). Narum suspects, and sees Solo and Kuryakin leave later with Stryker. Narum ‘sees’ through the deception and sends men after this group.\n\nThere’s an edgy banter among the three, especially between Solo and Stryker, who talks with a mixture of courtesy and contempts about U.N.C.L.E. and its efforts. Stryker’s thoroughly intriguing. He’s under guard by only two men, who are constantly being harrassed by a greater number of men, but at no time does he put up any realistic resistance, or attempt to escape. Ok, yes, he has a heavy limp, but he seems more preoccupied in honing his next sardonic line. I found myself unable to decide if he were supposed to be a captive or a defector. I had no inkling of the truth.\n\nBut the key to The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is, of course, that every week some innocent bystander, who could be you or me, gets swept into the story by one means or another. This has been held back into the Second Act, by which time the THRUSH pursuers have chased Solo and Co. into a veddy high class dressmakers. Solo decides, as a precaution, to have Ilya handcuff him to Stryker, with the key dropped down a floor grating. But when everyone emerges from hiding behind a rack of posh dresses, Stryker is handcuffed to a young woman named Fran Parsons (Joanna More, wife of Ryan O’Neil, mother to Tatum), who has just been trying on a very posh dress and fur coat in her lunch hour, and is denying any intention of stealing the dress.\n\nSo poor Fran has to go to Washington with the boys. The problem is that Miss More can’t quite manage the innocent, irreverent comedic chops needed to make the situation bounce along as a contrast to the sober chase story, which is compounded when the episode decides to leave Ilya behind on a train until the climax.\n\nAt this point, I’m going to cut to the chase, or rather overlook the rest of the chase, in which Solo is overpowered by a THRUSH agent disguised as a Police Officer, whilst the triumphant Stryker boasts of the homing device implanted in a gold tooth overlooked when Waverley had his strip-searched. Miss Parsons knows too much and will have to be killed, but pulls off a superb football tackle (their style) on Stryker when Solo needs him distracted.\n\nTo get past THRUSH’s blockade in Washington, Solo drugs him and has him rushed to the hospital by Ambulance. There, he’s given over into the care of an U.N.C.L.E. team posing as Doctors and Orderlies. Except that they are THRUSH. And the sting is that Waverley had the real Stryker all along. Solo and Kuryakin’s man is the decoy, U.N.C.L.E. agent Peter Westcot, concealed from them so that they would act completely seriously.\n\nI didn’t suspect it for a second, and my first thought was of some of the potential discrepancies, but there’s actually nothing in ‘Stryker’s actions that can’t be explained away perfectly reasonably, even down to the homing device (clearly removed from the real Stryker and implanted on Westcot as an ‘oversight’). All that is left is for Westcot to be saved from THRUSH, and then for Fran to decide which man she wants to have cocktails with later (the answer is both – but she’s drinking ginger ale!)\n\nSo, overall, a decent straight story with a well-concealed twist, thanks to Taegar’s excellent performance (I had forgotten that I used to watch him, in 1967, playing the title role in the short-lived Western series, Hondo). But the decision to sideline David McCallum for half the episode automatically triggered my reservations and, ultimately, Joanna Moore – who was actually deaf in one ear – could not play the part of the insufficiently daffy, insufficiently knowing Fran to the extent the part needed, flattening the comedic element.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
