        "text": "PASADENA, Calif. — A jet-lagged Robert Vaughn had only moments to decide how to describe the character he plays on the BBC series \"Hu$tle.\" A last-minute call, a trans-Atlantic flight and inquiries from the British press forced him to think on his feet.\n\n\"I said, 'Well, I haven't given a hell of a lot of thought to the character since I'm still jet-lagged,\"' he said with a laugh. \"'But suppose the character I played in 'The Man From U.N.C.L.E.' — Napoleon Solo — took his pension and, having spent his entire life around glamorous women and beautiful cars and lots of money and gambling casinos and so on, he found out he couldn't live on his government pension from his spy days.\n\n\"He decided, 'Well, I know what I can do. I can use those abilities as a wise con man.' I made that up as I was talking to them. And that's what's followed me ever since. It's now — Robert Vaughn in 'Hu$tle' (is) Napoleon Solo: The Later Years.\"'\n\nSitting down to chat with the Deseret Morning News recently, Vaughn looked far younger than his 74 years.\n\nAfter four years and 24 episodes of \"Hu$tle,\" he couldn't be more pleased that he agreed to be one of the stars of the British series about a group of con artists who pull off intricately plotted scams in each episode. Vaughn plays Albert Stroeller, the elder statesman of the group, who \"ropes in the mark.\"\n\nThey're sort of bad guys, but not really.\n\n\"The basic thing that we all agreed upon at the beginning of the first year is we don't take money from people who can't afford to lose it,\" said Vaughn. And the \"marks,\" he said, \"aren't terribly good\" people to begin with.\n\nVaughn is the only American in a cast that includes Mar Warren, Robert Glenister, Jaime Murray and Ashley Walters (who comes aboard in Season 4 to replace the departed Adrian Lester).\n\n\"They're all enormously talented — far more talented than I am,\" Vaughn said. \"They all do voices, they all sing, they all dance, they all do dialects, they paint. Every one of them is individually talented in addition to acting.\n\n\"And we, immediately, from Day 1, started liking each other and socializing, which you usually don't do in a television show. Usually, at the end of 12 or 14 hours, you're not interested in seeing the people that you're working with.\"\n\nIn the spring of 2003, Vaughn met with \"Hu$tle\" producers in London. \"We had a lovely, long, liquid lunch that lasted about three hours. And we all hugged and kissed and swore to each other that we'd be friends forever,\" he said, but then he heard nothing back from them. \"May went by and June went by, and by that time I'd forgotten about it, as I always do with things like this. I don't worry about them.\"\n\nThen he got a call at his home in Connecticut on the night of Aug. 14, 2003, telling him he had to get on the next plane to London and start shooting immediately. Which was a bit of a problem because much of the eastern United States was in the middle of a blackout that left more than 50 million people without power. \"I did indeed go the next night and started shooting the following morning,\" said Vaughn.\n\nHe was told there had been a \"big battle\" over whether to have an American or British actor play the role. \"But the BBC decided that you seem to be as close to a British person as anybody in America. That's why they finally said, 'Go with Robert Vaughn.\"'\n\nBorn into show business — his parents were both actors — Vaughn's long career includes movies ranging from \"The Magnificent Seven\" to \"Bullitt\" to \"The Young Philadelphians\" to \"Superman 3,\" as well as literally hundreds of TV roles (including the starring role in another British series, \"The Protectors\" from 1972-74). But he remains best known as \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\" (1964-68), playing secret agent Napoleon Solo, TV's answer to James Bond.\n\nAnd he's still recognized as Solo on both sides of the Atlantic. \"Although the show was very successful in America, it was twice as successful in England. And it's been playing (in repeats) almost constantly since the '60s,\" so his \"Hu$tle\" co-stars were exposed to it. \"They all grew up watching the show. They were all literally tiny children when the show was airing the first time.\" (Murray and Walters weren't even born until long after the show went off the air.)\n\nAnd what he told those British reporters four years ago turned out to be true. \"Basically, what I'm trying to do is do the character I did in 'U.N.C.L.E.\"' Vaughn said. \"I was doing doing this kind of thing ... in the '60s.\"\n\nOddly enough, shooting a TV series for the BBC brought Vaughn home again. The fourth season opens on Wednesday (9 p.m., AMC) with an episode filmed in Los Angeles — an episode that reunited him with a \"very old friend,\" Robert Wagner.\n\n\"We hadn't worked together since 'The Towering Inferno' 25 years ago. It was great. I haven't seen him in quite a while,\" Vaughn said. \"I met him before he married Natalie Wood the first time. And I also met her before he met me. So we go back a long way.\" (In the episode, Vaughn and the other con artists try to sell Wagner's character the Hollywood sign. Really.)\n\nThe episode found members of the \"Hu$tle\" cast shooting on Hollywood Boulevard, riding up and down the street in the back of a red Cadillac.\n\n\"And Robert's going, 'Oh, that's the Kodak Theater,\"' Murray said, mimicking an American accent, \"'That's where this happened and that happened and Marilyn Monroe this.\"'\n\n\"We were all like four little kids, including this one here,\" she said, gesturing to Vaughn. \"He was so proudly kind of showing it off, and his excitement was amazing.\"\n\nIt was sort of a homecoming for Vaughn, who came to Hollywood 5 1/2 decades ago at the age of 19. \"The first four years I was out here, I lived a block-and-a-half from Hollywood Boulevard on Cherokee,\" he said. \"That's where my star is, on that corner.\"\n\nHe has \"very fond memories\" of an era when the world-famous street \"was almost verging on a quaint, dusty road with a red streetcar that went back and forth.\"\n\n\"Hollywood Boulevard was literally my home life,\" Vaughn said. \"I was living in a one-room apartment with a Murphy bed that came out of the wall. I slept on the Murphy bed and my mother slept on the couch.\"\n\nThe area has gone through a renaissance in recent years and is now a tourist attraction again, but there was a time when crime was rampant. \"I took my daughter, who was about 12 at the time, to show her where my star was,\" Vaughn said. \"A guy came out of the corner (building) — he had a cleaver in his hand. Another guy came out after him with a gun. And this is all happening at 9 o'clock in the morning at the corner of Cherokee and Hollywood Boulevard,\" he said with a laugh.\n\nBut, he assured Murray — who recently took an apartment in the area — things have changed for the better. \"And my star — you can go down and see it,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm going to go down and polish it,\" she said with a laugh.\n\nIf you watch\n\nWhat: \"Hu$tle\"\n\nWhere: cable/satellite channel AMC (formerly American Movie Classics)\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 8 p.m. (repeats at various times)"
