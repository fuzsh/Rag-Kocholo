        "text": "This year's other reboot of a TV spy show from the '60s is Guy Ritchie's The Man From U.N.C.L.E. By 1965, Bondmania had secured its place in Pop Culture, thanks to the phenomenal success of Goldfinger in 1964 and the even bigger box-office hit Thunderball the following year, and we began to see a slew of espionage films and tv shows. Some of them were serious and solemn, like the bleak adaptation of John Le Carre's novel The Spy Who Came In From The Cold and Len Deighton's The Ipcress File, starring Michael Caine.\n\nHowever, most of this new wave of spy thrillers were more frivolous and tongue-in-cheek. There was the brief series of Matt Helm films starring Dean Martin, much to the horror of fans of Donald Hamilton's series of books which were written in a more serious vein. Gotta read a few one day. The Matt Helm movies played up on Martin's perpetually tipsy playboy image and were a far cry from the character of the books.\n\nThe other notable Bond parodies were the two Derek Flint films (Our Man Flint-1966, and In Like Flint-1967) which presented us with a virtual super-spy who spoke 45 languages, was proficient in numerous martial arts, and would 'sleep' by lying across two chairs and then taking a poison pill which would stop his heart. Next morning, his wristwatch would swivel out a tiny T-shaped mechanism which would massage the pulse on his wrist (he wears his watch on the inside of his wrist) and bring him back to life. These Flint films were clearly an attempt to out-do Bond, but they presented us with a character who was just too preposterous, despite the fact that he was played by James Coburn.\n\nTelevision was quick to get on board the spy wagon. There was the Robert Culp/Bill Cosby series I Spy, as well as a childhood favourite of mine, Get Smart. Although, these two shows were fairly light-hearted, especially the adventures of the bumbling CONTROL agent Maxwell Smart.\n\nAiming for something a little more Bond-like, aside from the series Mission:Impossible, there was also another spy show airing at the time that dealt with two operatives from rival agencies who teamed up to work for an agency called U.N.C.L.E. (United Network Command for Law and Enforcement). Admittedly, I haven't seen many episodes of the original series. I think it used to screen in the afternoons in the 1970s at 3:00pm. I can recall getting home from school and catching the last ten or fifteen minutes of a few.\n\nAnyway, I went along to see this new film version, not really knowing what to expect. I wasn't sure if they were aiming for something like a Bond film or whether it was going to be like an Austin Powers movie. Thankfully, it was nothing like an Austin Powers movie.\n\nIt's been over a month since I saw this film and much has been going on in my life since. I'm sure the details will be sketchy here. Also, I would need a second and/or third viewing to really make up my mind. However, I did like this film.\n\nSet in 1963, it concerns an American CIA agent named Napoleon Solo who helps a scientist's daughter escape from East Berlin. A Russian KGB agent named Illya Kuryakin is unsuccessful in stopping Solo from completing this mission. Solo is briefed by his superiors about the scientist, who has been kidnapped and is being forced to work on a nuclear device for a wealthy shipping magnate. Solo is then informed that he will be working in a CIA/KGB joint operation with Kuryakin.\n\nSo, the first half of this film sees these two butting heads with each other in a beautifully rendered world of 1960s jetsetting, Italian pop songs, sharp suits and (now) classic cars.\n\nI loved the overall mood of this film and Director Ritchie has always been adept at making films about the relationship between men, whether it's an ensemble piece like Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels (1998), Snatch (2000) and RocknRolla (2008), or something like the two Sherlock Holmes films starring Robert Downey jr. and Jude Law. In U.N.C.L.E., he gives his two leads enough scenes where they can spar against each other. Henry Cavill is great as Napoleon Solo. I had read another review...\n\n...where it was stated that Cavill's performance contained echoes of Robert Vaughn's original performance from the tv series and full credit to Cavill for adding this little touch to his take on the character.\n\nArmie Hammer does great as Soviet agent Kuryakin, even though he does a standard Russian 'eggsent'. Hammer plays the part with a straight-faced determination, creating a character who shows little emotion, but manages to convey feelings from time to time when his veneer shows a few cracks.\n\nThe cinematography by John Mathieson is sleek, creating a heightened world full of colour, light and shadow.\n\nOne thing I did notice was the lack of any huge action set-pieces. Whereas the recent Tom Cruise Mission:Impossible installment contained some big action scenes, this film opts for smaller scenes containing some tense moments, and it is in some ways more about the relationship between these two operatives.\n\nThe film had a purported production budget of 75 million and, to date, it has grossed only 100 million in world-wide box-office earnings. Sadly, this would mean that a sequel is unlikely, which is a shame since I think this film deserved a wider audience and it would be interesting to see where the characters would go in a follow-up film.\n\nOverall, I liked this film. It isn't a Bond movie, it isn't a Mission:Impossible, but it does show that there is room for something slightly different in a modern spy movie. Lord knows, I'd rather see another U.N.C.L.E. movie rather than a fourth Taken.\n\nAt any rate, who knows? Maybe Guy Ritchie will have enough clout to get a sequel in the works. Although, I think he'll be working on the next Sherlock Holmes film before he does anything else.\n\nIf you missed The Man From U.N.C.L.E at the cinemas, then try to catch it on DVD (do people still rent DVDs?) or whatever format is current for watching films.\n\nIt is definitely a sharp film in many ways.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nAnd thanks once again to wikipedia for helping me fill in the blanks regarding story elements, production dates, etc.\n\n- Friday 7:49pm AEST -\n\nBoxes as far as the eye can see. Every room has them. I forget what's even in half of them. Meanwhile, I don't know where half of my clothing is. Probably still packed away in some garment bag.\n\nI plan to make some bookshelves. Custom built to my own specifications to accommodate as many books as possible and go as high as I can make them without them toppling down. I'll have to bolt them into the wall to prevent that happening. The real learning curve for me will be using a router to cut dado grooves into the shelves in an effort to make them stronger than just using screws. I'm hoping to make the shelves as narrow as I can so that they don't bite into the room too much. I'll be using dressed pine that's 184mm wide, 19mm thick and 2400mm long. These shelves will be about seven feet tall, which is why they'll have to be bolted to the wall.\n\nAnd the best part? I've never used a router in my life. The carpenter's dictum; \"Measure twice, cut once\", will become a mantra for me.\n\nMonday\n\nI put on the Omega Seamaster Planet Ocean because I hadn't worn it in quite a while and also, I somehow lost track of the days last week. Last Thursday I couldn't, for the life of me, remember what had happened the day before.That has never happened to me before. So, for starters, I thought I'd wear a watch that had a date on it. Here it is with one of my old 1980s printings of a Robert Ludlum thriller. This may have been the first of his books that I ever read. I like Ludlum's books, but man, he loved using italics on almost every page!\n\nThursday\n\nThe plumber arrived at around 7:30am. These guys don't mess around. We had the shower-head replaced because we didn't like the 'fairy sprinkle' that the original shower head emitted. Later, I started putting the DVDs out onto their shelves. I think I'm going to need more shelves. Although, I do intend to sift through the collection and weed out some movies that are either obscure enough not to be missed and/or watched ever again (Drillbit Taylor) or too damn average to bother watching to begin with (one of those Ashley Judd 'woman-in-jepoardy' movies that she seemed to churn out in abundance back in the '90s). I was still wearing the Planet Ocean.\n\nToday\n\nOne last trip out to the old house to clear out any remaining items of ours. The garage still had tools and other sundry items that we had to take. I hired a small van for the heavy stuff. As it turned out, I will have to go back one more time to give the lawns one final mow.\n\nMeanwhile, our cat has been cooped up indoors since the fifteenth and it's beginning to get on her tail. When relocating a cat, you're meant to keep them indoors for at least two weeks. That's gonna drive us all crazy! Ah well, I suppose Wednesday will get here when it gets here. Then we can let her out and she can roam around.\n\nAnyway, I'm absolutely beat. I had a can of Red Bull this afternoon (second one I've ever had in my life) and I don't think it kicked in. Probably better that way. Still had the Planet Ocean on my wrist.\n\nMan, I'm tired. Anyway, thanks for reading and have a good weekend!\n\n- Friday, 3:33pm AEST -\n\nEverywhere I look, there is stuff all over the place. We have three more days left at this address before the removal van arrives, hopefully with two guys ready to do some heavy lifting, to move us to our new address. The internet/phone guy is booked to arrive on the same day to hook up comms. Next week will be busy indeed.\n\nCould not log on to the internet. A quick call to the phone company (via my mobile) and I was informed that our phone and internet had been disconnected due to the appointment next week to have phone and 'net connected at our new address. I reminded them that we are still living at our old address until next week. They apologised and got our internet back up and running pretty quickly. The landline would take another 24 hours to reconnect.\n\nI was still wearing the Omega Seamaster 300 from the weekend.\n\nAs I mentioned last week, our new modem hook-up will require us to leave it switched on 24/7 in order to keep the landline switched on. This friggin' Digital Age, man! Keeping us ever-more reliant on all this wireless crap. Yes, I know. Here I am, reaching out to people around the world via the web through my little ol' blog that, back in the old days of actual publishing, wouldn't stand a chance of being produced or read outside of my own home. I get it. I really do. I just don't like being forced to adapt to all of this new tech. Also, as I said last week, I'm not crazy about RF frequencies filtering throughout the house all the time. And now, I'm also beginning to wonder if any of my old rotary dial telephones will work on this exchange. There's a question for the technician when he arrives.\n\nWednesday\n\nI started thinking about this house that we've lived in for the last fifteen years. I remember what the real estate agent said to us after we bought the place; \"When you have kids, they'll be able to play in the park right across the road here. This fence will come down, the tip (junk-yard) will be moved much further along, and you'll have access to the park with its lake and marshlands.\"\n\nThe fence is still there. The tip has pretty much been shut down and the land where it stood has been laid with grass. Yes, it's all very green and rural-looking, but the fence is still up and there's no hint of a park, lake or marshland to be seen. Granted, we have gone to the original park that was meant to extend virtually to our front door. It's a ten minute walk from our house. However, the real estate guy's prediction hasn't come true yet. It might for the next owners of this house. Might.\n\nStill, I will miss the view, but I won't miss the dirt track out the front, or the hoons who insist on recreating scenes from The Fast And The Furious by tearing down this dirt road and slamming on the brakes at the corner while I stand on the front porch as a thick curtain of dust heads towards me. I won't miss the pot-holes on this dirt road that we need to drive on every day, thinking that the street is in a warzone that has been shelled, and I won't miss the young punks who aimlessly walk by, smoking cheap cigarettes and carrying a 2 litre bottle of Coca-Cola as they head down towards the bush track nearby on their way to get drunk (it can't just be Coke in that bottle) or smoke dope. They'll probably get their driver's licences in the next year or two, to become the next generation of reckless jerks on the dirt track out front.\n\nNope, we've well and truly done our time here. We need a change of scenery, despite how nice it can look on a sunny day here.\n\nI will, however, miss the venetian blinds. They've been good for my photography over the years. Yes, I suppose I could install some at the new house, but that kind of expense is not a priority. Not the end of the world. I can take a sheet of cardboard and cut some long, deep slits in it and position it out-of-frame to mimic the effect of venetian blinds. That might work. I guess I'll find out soon enough.\n\nLater in the day, I thought I'd give the dive watch a break, so out came the 36mm Omega Seamaster AquaTerra.\n\nThursday\n\nA Bond fan I met on the internet sent me a Kindle e-Book copy of the new Bond novel Trigger Mortis, by Anthony Horowitz. I have a signed hardback edition on the way from a bookseller in London, but I don't think it will arrive until mid-October, so I'm thrilled to have a digital copy to begin reading in the meantime.\n\nI'm only about a dozen pages in, so I won't say much more about it. I recall writing positively about the last OO7 adventure, Solo, by William Boyd, and I can remember feeling very let down by the time I got to the end of that book. It didn't capture the essence or feel of a Bond story. Let's face it, it would be nigh impossible to replicate Ian Fleming. Not because his plotting was brilliant, but because he wrote in a different time and with a different mind-set. A writer has to walk a very fine line in order to stick to Bond conventions without falling into pastiche.\n\nSo, I'll wait until I've finished the book and let it settle before I make any comment on it. Still, with Anthony Horowitz at the helm, I'd like to think that OO7 is in good hands this time around.\n\nOf course, in the lead-up to the release of SPECTRE, we got a few more poster artworks this week as the Bondwagon rolls on;\n\nIt was time to hit the gym. I haven't been for over two months. I grabbed the Everlast workout gloves (might as well look the part) and the circa 1993 modified Seiko 7002. Got to the gym, did a light, half-hour workout on the machines, and then got out of there. Once home, I mixed up some Sustagen in a glass of milk, got a handful of almonds and a tub of yellow-box honey yoghurt and had a second breakfast.\n\nAnd then, because I haven't worn a vintage piece in so long, I fished out the circa 1969 Omega Seamaster Chronometer;\n\nGee, my skin looks dry! I'd better moisturise. I'll leave you with one more poster for the new Bond flick, this one I think is of Bond in disguise during the Day of The Dead Festival in Mexico;\n\nThanks for reading, have a great weekend!"
