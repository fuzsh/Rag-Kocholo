Press enter to return or tab to continue.\n\nMedia captionA look back at the life of Robert Vaughn\n\nActor Robert Vaughn, best known as the secret agent Napoleon Solo in The Man from UNCLE, has died aged 83.\n\nVaughn was also famous for his role as Lee in the Magnificent Seven, and television roles in Hustle and Coronation Street.\n\nThe actor died after a battle with acute leukaemia, his manager, Matthew Sullivan, told the BBC.\n\nVaughn died in New York on Friday morning surrounded by his family, he said.\n\nThe suave, debonair and impeccably dressed star\n\nDavid McCallum, from the hit TV show NCIS, who as Illya Kuryakin starred alongside Vaughn in The Man From UNCLE, told TVLine.com he was \"utterly devastated\" by the news.\n\n\"Robert and I worked together for many years and losing him is like losing a part of me. My deepest sympathies go out to Linda and the Vaughn family,\" he said.\n\nVaughn, who was \"a few months shy of 84\" had been seeking treatment for his leukaemia, Mr Sullivan said.\n\n\"He was a great human being. I enjoyed every day of working with him,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nImage caption Vaughn was best known for The Man from UNCLE and as one of the original Magnificent Seven\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nImage caption Vaughn continued to work until shortly before his death\n\nVaughn had only recently finished two projects - an appearance on Law and Order: SVU, and a starring role in the upcoming film Gold Star, about a young woman caring for her dying father.\n\nFamous films Vaughn worked on included Bullitt and Towering Inferno, both with Steve McQueen, and he took the role of the villain in Superman III.\n\nHe was also well-known in Britain for his 1970s appearance as Harry Rule in the ITV series, The Protectors.\n\nThe plot featured three wealthy individuals getting together each week, usually in exotic locations, to solve crimes and protect the innocent.\n\nThough extremely popular, it was later described by Vaughn in his autobiography as \"tasteless junk\".\n\nImage caption 2004's Hustle revitalised his career\n\nDecades later, he would have another hit UK series with Hustle, a BBC series in which he played elderly con man Albert Stroller, responsible for setting up potential targets for a younger generation of grifters.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Linda and two children, Cassidy and Caitlin Vaughn.\n\nOn social media, fans paid tribute to his work.\n\n\"Robert Vaughn, such a fine actor, one of the best Columbo villains (no higher praise than that) and an utterly charming man,\" tweeted Stephen Fry.\n\nImage copyright Twitter / @AdrianLester\n\nImage caption Hustle co-star Adrian Lester tweeted a personal tribute\n\nActor Jon Donahue said: \"As an 80s kid, I grew up with Superman III... Robert Vaughn was a badass!\" referencing Vaughn's role as Superman's nemesis.\n\nGavin Free, creator of the YouTube series The Slow Mo Guys paid tribute to Vaughn's work ethic. \"I got to work with him on Hustle five years ago. He did his own slow mo stunts that day while in his late 70s,\" he wrote.\n\nFellow fictional secret agent, Sir Roger Moore, whose incarnation of James Bond came several years after The Man From UNCLE, said he was sorry to hear the news.\n\nSwami\n\nRobert Vaughn was reunited with David McCallum in a reunion movie and then again when Robert Vaughn was a regular on The A-Team and David McCallum guested.\n\nThe Man from U.N.C.L.E. was one of my early favourites on TV. In remembrance of Robert Vaughn I’m posting 2 fan-made videos with him from that series.\n\nThe first is a short trip down memory lane. It includes scenes from the reunion & from The A-Team.\n\nThis next is scenes only from The Dove Affair, from Season 1. It’s one of the most serious episodes of the series, and possibly the most Bond-like. The episode is entirely without Illya. Instead, Napoleon, on the run in the Balkans after stealing a dead man’s medal (the Order of the Dove), finds himself dogged by Satine – who wants to retrieve the medal for reasons of his own, at risk of being killed by Napoleon should the latter unmask his identity. Which Napoleon does. The question is, who will get the upper hand."
