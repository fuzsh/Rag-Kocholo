        "text": "IMPACT 23 Nonprofit Spotlight: Orange County United Way Purpose Moment Livi Kerszenbaum, MBA, Sr. Director, Corporate Social Responsibility at OC United Way, shared a personal story underscoring life's unpredictability. Facing sudden responsibility as her husband recovered from a motorcycle accident, Kerszenbaum emphasized the importance of support systems, savings, and access to assistance. Highlighting the 'OC Way' of community support, OC United Way focuses on three key initiatives: Financial Security, Student Success, and Ending Homelessness. These efforts impact over a million lives annually, addressing graduation rates, family stability, and homelessness. Kerszenbaum emphasized the human inclination to contribute socially, citing OC United Way's 211 program connecting residents to vital services. Engaging in community service, she noted, correlates with improved mental well-being and longer life expectancies. The presentation concluded with a call for audience participation in a purposeful moment—sending words of encouragement for struggling veterans. The cards collected would be distributed to local veterans facing homelessness. #IMPACT23 #IMA #internetmarketing #OCUW #OrangeCountyUnitedWay #Veterans #PurposeMoment #Ai\n\nHi Morgan No we are not Proud of Mayor Lucas. Repealing NEW ORDINANCE TO CODE BOOKS ORDINANCE NO. 230401 Amending Chapter 3, Code of Ordinances, by repealing Section 3-431, “Setting Goals for Individual Contracts” and enacting in lieu thereof a new section of like number and subject matter regulating the application of numeric MBE/WBE goals on certain projects leased for development or receiving economic development incentives or tax abatement. BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF KANSAS CITY: 2. Ignoring the letter from The Kcmo Fairness Board Chairman & Fairness Committee regarding Civil Rights violations ? Harrasment of minority contractors ? inadequate reporting from Kcmo CREO department ? No Disparity report for 9 years and more ? 2016 Disparity Report below: Department of I think 1.2 minority [participation] and 2.5 WBE [participation], when there was adequate availability of minority and women contractors to meet the City’s standard kind of goal of 15 [percent] and 7 [percent]. They’re diluting the opportunity for minority and women contractors when it comes through the statutory business development organizations, all of whom have different sets of rules..… There ought to be a uniform code that is incorporated in all the development agreements which people in our community never see.… There’s a disconnect. And I realize they’re trying to change some of that now but the insulting part of it was there was more money spent through statutory agencies last year for contracting activities than there were through City departments.… It’s obviously developer driven. By the time we see it the development agreement has already been executed. Caused lack of capital for Jackson County schools and libraries. Mayor Lucas and Insult to African Americans everywhere?\n\n3rd attempt to post. Though at DEA they are not so proud to highlight their shortcomings that they have no issue hiding from taxpayers. They removed my previous posts which simply expresses DEA's willingness to hide their incompetence and disabled comments on the appropriate post. If this firm put out the truth and numbers of how many things they had to redo on this Highway 20 Safety Upgrade between Corvallis and Albany OR taxpayers would have something to say about this firm’s laughable ranking. How about it DEA, put out an itemized list of everything that had to be done two or three times because it wasn’t done right in the first place and how much taxpayers money was wasted in the process. In my driveway alone they had to do multiple things more than once. No wonder ODOT never comes in on budget with incompetence like this! Taxpayers should not have to foot the bill for this! DEA was contracted for at least the Newberg-Dundee Bypass, the worst one, up 239% from original estimate. https://lnkd.in/epv6uESx\n\n2nd attempt to post.
