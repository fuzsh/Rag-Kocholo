        "text": "Jammu: In Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir, National Conference Vice President Omar Abdullah has dismissed the promises of a “New Jammu and Kashmir” as mere rhetoric, stating that the reality on the ground is far from the rosy picture painted by those in power in New Delhi.\n\nAccording to Kashmir Media Service, speaking at a public rally in Bani town, Kathua, Omar Abdullah highlighted the widening gap between the BJP-led Indian government’s claims and the lived experiences of the people in IIOJK. He said, “The reality on the ground paints a starkly different picture from the lofty promises made by those in power”.\n\nHe emphasized that nearly five years after the abrogation of Article 370, the territory has seen little to no tangible improvement. “We were told that Article 370 was an obstacle to the development of J&K. Yet, the promised progress is nowhere to be found. Instead, basic necessities like electricity and water are becoming increasingly scarce, while people are burdened with exorbitant tariffs,” he said.\n\nOmar Abdullah also challenged New Delhi’s narrative of improved security in IIOJK. Pointing to the alarming deterioration of the security situation, he said, “From Bani to Basohli, Doda to Kishtwar, Poonch to Rajouri, and Kathua to Samba, reports of encounters and the killing of soldiers have become distressingly common”. He added areas that were once free from pro-freedom activities are now witnessing its resurgence."
