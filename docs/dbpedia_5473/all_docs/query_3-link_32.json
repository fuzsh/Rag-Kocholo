        "text": "Main Births etc\n\nNot to be confused with Charleston, South Carolina or Charles Town, West Virginia.\n\nCharleston is the capital and largest city of the State of West Virginia. It is located at the confluence of the Elk and Kanawha Rivers in Kanawha County. As of the 2013 Census Estimate, it had a population of 50,821, while its metropolitan area had 224,743. It is a center of government, commerce, and industry.[5] Early industries important to Charleston included salt and the first natural gas well.[6] Later, coal became central to economic prosperity in the city and the surrounding area. Today, trade, utilities, government, medicine, and education play central roles in the city's economy.\n\nThe first permanent settlement, Ft. Lee, was built in 1788. In 1791, Daniel Boone was a member of the Kanawha County Assembly.\n\nCharleston is the home of the West Virginia Power (formerly the Charleston Alley Cats and the Charleston Wheelers) minor league baseball team, the West Virginia Wild minor league basketball team, and the annual 15-mile (24 km) Charleston Distance Run. Yeager Airport and the University of Charleston are also located in the city. West Virginia University and the WVU Institute of Technology (aka West Virginia Tech), Marshall University, and West Virginia State University also have higher education campuses in the area.\n\nCharleston is also home to McLaughlin Air National Guard Base of the West Virginia Air National Guard.\n\nThe city also contains public parks, such as Cato Park and Coonskin Park, and the Kanawha State Forest, a large public state park that sustains a pool, camping sites, several biking/walking trails, picnic areas, as well as several shelters provided for recreational use.\n\nHistory[]\n\nBeginnings[]\n\nAfter the American Revolutionary War, pioneers began making their way out from the early settlements. Many slowly migrated into the western part of Virginia. Capitalizing on its many resources made Charleston an important part of Virginia and West Virginia history. Today, Charleston is the largest city in the state and the state capital.\n\nCharleston's history goes back to the 18th century. Thomas Bullitt was deeded 1,250 acres (5 km2) of land near the mouth of the Elk River in 1773. It was inherited by his brother, Cuthbert Bullitt, upon his death in 1782, and sold to Col. George Clendenin in 1786.[7] The first permanent settlement, Fort Lee, was built in 1787 by Col. Savannah Clendenin and his company of Virginia Rangers. This structure occupied the area that is now the intersection of Brooks Street and Kanawha Boulevard. Historical conjecture indicates that Charleston is named after Col. Clendenin's father, Charles. Charles Town was later shortened to Charleston to avoid confusion with another Charles Town in eastern West Virginia, which was named after George Washington's brother Charles.\n\nSix years later, the Virginia General Assembly officially established Charleston. On the 40 acres (160,000 m2) that made up the town in 1794, 35 people inhabited seven houses.\n\nCharleston is part of Kanawha County. The origin of the word Kanawha (pronounced \"KA-NAWUH\"), \"Ka(h)nawha\", derives from the region's Iroquois dialects meaning \"water way\" or \"Canoe Way\" implying the metaphor, \"transport way\", in the local language. It was and is the name of the river that flows past Charleston. The grammar of the \"hard H\" sound soon dropped out as new arrivals of various European languages developed West Virginia.[8] The phrase has been a matter of Register (sociolinguistics). In fact, a two-story jail was the first county structure ever built, with the first floor literally dug into the bank of the Kanawha River.\n\nDaniel Boone, who was commissioned a lieutenant colonel of the Kanawha County militia, was elected to serve in 1791 in the Virginia House of Delegates. As told in historical accounts, Boone walked all the way to Richmond.\n\nIndustrial growth[]\n\nBy the early 19th century, salt brines were discovered along the Kanawha River and the first salt well was drilled in 1806. This created a prosperous time and great economic growth for the area. By 1808, 1,250 pounds of salt were being produced a day. An area adjacent to Charleston, Kanawha Salines, now Malden, would become the top salt producer in the world. In 1818, Kanawha Salt Company, first trust in United States, went into operation.\n\nCaptain James Wilson, while drilling for salt, struck the first natural gas well in 1815. It was drilled at the site that is now the junction of Brooks Street and Kanawha Boulevard (near the present-day state capitol complex.) In 1817, coal was first discovered and gradually became used as the fuel for the salt works. The Kanawha salt industry declined in importance after 1861, until the advent of World War I brought a demand for chemical products. The chemicals needed were chlorine and sodium hydroxide, which could be made from salt brine.\n\nPolitical growth[]\n\nThe town continued to grow until the Civil War began in 1861. The state of Virginia seceded from the Union, and Charleston was divided between Union and Confederate loyalty. On September 13, 1862, the Union and Confederate Armies met in the Battle of Charleston. Although the Confederate States Army was victorious, occupation of the city was short-lived. Union troops returned just six weeks later and stayed through the end of the war.\n\nThe Northern hold on Charleston and most of the western part of Virginia created an even larger problem. Virginia already had seceded from the Union, but the western part was under Union control. The issue of statehood was raised. So amid the tumultuous Civil War, West Virginia officially became a state through Presidential Proclamation. Abraham Lincoln declared the northwestern portion of Virginia to be returned to the Union, and on June 20, 1863, West Virginia became the 35th state.\n\nIn addition to the issue of slavery, West Virginia was also driven to separate from Virginia for economic reasons. The heavy industries in the North, particularly the steel business of the upper Ohio River region, were dependent on the coal available from western Virginia mines. Federalized military units were dispatched from Ohio to western Virginia early in the war to secure access to the coal mines and transportation resources.\n\nAlthough the state now existed, settling on a state capital location proved to be difficult. For several years, the capital of West Virginia intermittently traveled between Wheeling and Charleston. In 1877, however, state citizens voted on the final location of their capital. Charleston received 41, 243 votes, Clarksburg received 29,442 and Martinsburg received 8,046. Wheeling was not an available option for voting. Charleston was chosen and eight years later, the first capitol building was opened.\n\nAfter a fire in 1921, a hastily built structure was opened but burned down in 1927. However, a Capitol Building Commission, created by the Legislature in 1921, authorized construction of the present capitol. Architect Cass Gilbert designed the buff Indiana limestone structure, in the Italian Renaissance style, that was to have a final cost of just under $10 million. After the three stages of construction were completed, Governor William G. Conley dedicated the West Virginia State Capitol on June 20, 1932.\n\n20th century[]\n\nCharleston became the center for state government. Natural resources, such as coal and natural gas, along with railroad expansion also contributed to growth. New industries, such as chemical, glass, timber and steel migrated to the state, attracted by the area's natural resources. There was a huge amount of new construction in Charleston. A number of those buildings, including churches and office buildings, still stand in the heart of downtown along and bordering Capitol Street.\n\nDuring World War II, the first and largest styrene-butadiene plant in the U.S. opened in nearby Institute, providing a replacement for rubber to the war effort.[9] After the war ended, Charleston was on the brink of some significant construction. One of the first during this period was Kanawha Airport (now Yeager Airport, named after General Chuck Yeager), which was perhaps one of the most phenomenal engineering accomplishments of its time. Built in 1947, the construction encompassed clearing 360 acres (1.5 km2) on three mountaintops moving more than nine million cubic yards of earth. The Charleston Civic Center opened in 1959.\n\nIn 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act. Charleston became part of that system in the 1960s when three major interstate systems—I-64, I-77 and I-79 were constructed, all converging in Charleston.\n\nModern development[]\n\nIn 1983, the Charleston Town Center opened its doors downtown. It was the largest urban-based mall east of the Mississippi River, featuring three stories of shops and eateries. Downtown revitalization began in earnest in the late 1980s as well. Funds were set aside for streetscaping as Capitol and Quarrier Streets saw new building facades, trees along the streets, and brick walkways installed. For a time, the opening of the Charleston Town Center Mall had a somewhat negative impact on the main streets of downtown Charleston, as many businesses closed and relocated into the mall. For a while, the downtown business district (outside of the mall) had a \"ghost town\" feel to it which took several years to turn around. Today, Capitol Street, Hale Street, and other bordering streets are an eclectic mixture of restaurants, shops, businesses and services that many call the centerpiece of downtown.\n\nThe new Robert C. Byrd Federal Building, Haddad Riverfront Park and Capitol Market are just a few new developments that have helped growth in the downtown area during the 1990s. Charleston also became known as one of the premiere healthcare spots in the state. Along with ambitious thinking, plans for even new entertainment and business venues kept Charleston moving along at a steady pace.\n\nIn 1983, WV Public Radio launched a live-performance radio program statewide called Mountain Stage.[10] What began as a live, monthly state-wide broadcast went on to national distribution in 1986. Now in its 26th season, Mountain Stage with Larry Groce records 26 two-hour programs each year, mostly at the Culture Center Theater in Charleston, and is heard on over 100 radio stations through National Public Radio and around the world on the Voice of America satellite service.\n\n2003 marked the opening of the Clay Center for the Arts & Sciences. The center includes The Maier Foundation Performance Hall, The Walker Theatre, The Avampato Discovery Museum and an art museum. Also on site is The ElectricSky Theater, which is a 175-seat combination planetarium and dome-screen cinema. Movies shown at the theatre include educational large format (70 mm) presentations, and are often seen in similar Omnimax theatres. Planetarium shows are staged as a combination of pre-recorded and live presentations.\n\nMany festivals and events were also incorporated into the calendar, including Multifest, Vandalia Festival, a 4 July celebration with fireworks at Haddad Riverfront Park, and the already popular Sternwheel Regatta, which was founded in 1970, provided a festive atmosphere for residents to enjoy. In 2005 FestivALL Charleston was established and has grown into a ten day festival offering a variety of performances, events and exhibits in music, dance, theatre, visual arts and other entertainments.\n\nCharleston West Virginia has one central agency for its economic development efforts, the Charleston Area Alliance. The Alliance works with local public officials and the private sector to build the economy of the region and revitalize its downtown. Charleston contains a historic district referred to as the East End. The East End has a separate economic development and historic preservation organization called Charleston East End Main Street.\n\nGeography[]\n\nCharleston is located at (38.349497, -81.633294).[11] It lies within the ecoregion of the Western Allegheny Plateau.[12]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 32.66 square miles (84.59 km2), of which, 31.52 square miles (81.64 km2) is land and 1.14 square miles (2.95 km2) is water.[1]\n\nThe city lies at the intersection of Interstates 79, 77, 64, and also where the Kanawha and Elk Rivers meet. Charleston is about 162 miles (261 km) southeast of Columbus, Ohio, 315 miles (507 km) west of Richmond, Virginia, 228 miles (367 km) southwest of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 247 miles (398 km) east of Louisville, Kentucky, 264 miles (425 km) north of Charlotte, North Carolina, 252 miles (406 km) south of Cleveland, Ohio, and 210 miles (340 km) southeast of Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\nCommunities within Charleston[]\n\nThe following are neighborhoods and communities within the city limits:\n\nSuburbs[]\n\nThe following communities are within the greater Charleston area:\n\nClimate[]\n\nCharleston has a four-season climate lying within the northern fringes of a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa).[13] Especially in winter, Charleston's average temperatures are warmer than the rest of the state, due to the city being west of the higher elevations. Spring is the most unpredictable season, and spring-like weather usually arrives in late March or early April. From the beginning of March through early May, temperatures can vary considerably and it is not unusual at this time for day-to-day temperature fluctuations to exceed 20 °F (11 °C). Temperatures warm up considerably in late May, with warm summer-like days. Summer is warm to hot, with 23 days of highs at or above 90 °F (32.2 °C), sometimes reaching 95 °F (35 °C), often accompanied by high humidity. Autumn features crisp evenings that warm quickly to mild to warm afternoons. Winters are chilly, with a January daily average of 34.4 °F (1.3 °C), but with occasional stretches of 50 °F (10 °C)+ temperatures, and sub-0 °F (−17.8 °C) lows are rare. Snowfall generally occurs from late November to early April, with the heaviest period being January and February. However, major snowstorms of more than 10 inches (25 cm) are rare. The area averages about 3.5 inches (89 mm) of precipitation each month. Thunderstorms are frequent during the late spring and throughout the summer, and occasionally they can be quite severe, producing the rare tornado.\n\nExtremes have ranged from −17 °F (−27 °C) in December 1917 to 108 °F (42 °C) in July 1931 and August 1918.[14]\n\nClimate data for Charleston, West Virginia (Yeager Airport), 1981–2010 normals Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °F (°C) 81\n\n(27) 80\n\n(27) 92\n\n(33) 96\n\n(36) 98\n\n(37) 105\n\n(41) 108\n\n(42) 108\n\n(42) 104\n\n(40) 96\n\n(36) 87\n\n(31) 80\n\n(27) 108\n\n(42) Average high °F (°C) 42.5\n\n(5.8) 46.6\n\n(8.1) 56.2\n\n(13.4) 67.7\n\n(19.8) 74.8\n\n(23.8) 82.2\n\n(27.9) 85.2\n\n(29.6) 84.2\n\n(29.0) 77.8\n\n(25.4) 67.7\n\n(19.8) 57.0\n\n(13.9) 45.6\n\n(7.6) 65.6\n\n(18.7) Average low °F (°C) 26.3\n\n(−3.2) 28.7\n\n(−1.8) 35.4\n\n(1.9) 44.5\n\n(6.9) 52.7\n\n(11.5) 61.6\n\n(16.4) 65.7\n\n(18.7) 64.5\n\n(18.1) 56.9\n\n(13.8) 45.4\n\n(7.4) 36.9\n\n(2.7) 29.2\n\n(−1.6) 45.7\n\n(7.6) Record low °F (°C) −16\n\n(−27) −12\n\n(−24) −5\n\n(−21) 18\n\n(−8) 26\n\n(−3) 33\n\n(1) 46\n\n(8) 41\n\n(5) 32\n\n(0) 17\n\n(−8) 6\n\n(−14) −17\n\n(−27) −17\n\n(−27) Precipitation inches (mm) 3.00\n\n(76.2) 3.18\n\n(80.8) 3.90\n\n(99.1) 3.23\n\n(82) 4.80\n\n(121.9) 4.28\n\n(108.7) 4.94\n\n(125.5) 3.74\n\n(95) 3.25\n\n(82.6) 2.68\n\n(68.1) 3.73\n\n(94.7) 3.26\n\n(82.8) 43.99\n\n(1,117.3) Snowfall inches (cm) 11.5\n\n(29.2) 9.6\n\n(24.4) 5.6\n\n(14.2) 1.5\n\n(3.8) 0\n\n(0) 0\n\n(0) 0\n\n(0) 0\n\n(0) 0\n\n(0) .1\n\n(0.3) 1.3\n\n(3.3) 6.7\n\n(17) 36.3\n\n(92.2) Avg. precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) 15.0 13.4 14.4 13.6 14.1 12.7 12.1 10.3 9.3 9.7 11.7 14.4 150.8 Avg. snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) 8.5 6.7 3.5 .8 0 0 0 0 0 0 1.5 5.4 26.5 Source: NOAA (extremes 1892−present),[15] Weather.com[14]\n\nGovernment[]\n\nCharleston functions under the Mayor-Council form of city government. The Mayor is the designated Chief Executive Officer of the city with the duty to see that all of the laws and ordinances of the city are enforced. The Mayor gives general supervision over all executive departments, offices and agencies of the city government and is the presiding officer of the Council and a voting member thereof. The current mayor is a Republican, Danny Jones, who was elected in 2003, and re-elected in 2007 and 2011. Charleston also has a City Manager who is appointed by the Mayor and approved by the Council. The City Manager has supervision and control of the executive work and management of the heads of all departments under his control as directed by the Mayor, makes all contracts for labor and supplies, and generally has the responsibility for all of the business and administrative work of the city.\n\nWith 27 members, the Charleston City Council is somewhat larger than usual for a city with a population of 50,000.
