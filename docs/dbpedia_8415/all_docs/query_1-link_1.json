        "text": "American politician\n\nCruz Miguel Bustamante (born January 4, 1953) is an American politician. He previously served as the 45th Lieutenant Governor of California from 1999 to 2007, serving under governors Gray Davis and Arnold Schwarzenegger. A member of the Democratic Party, Bustamante also served in the California State Assembly and served as the Speaker from 1996 to 1998.\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nThe eldest of six children, Cruz Bustamante was born in Dinuba, California. His family later moved to San Joaquin, California. He attended and graduated from Tranquillity High School in the 1970s, where he excelled in both football and wrestling, and later attended Fresno City College and California State University, Fresno. Bustamante earned his Bachelor of Arts via distance learning from California State University, Fresno in 2003.[1][2]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nAs a resident of Fresno, Bustamante was elected to the California State Assembly in a special election in 1993, and became the Speaker of the Assembly in 1996.[2] He was elected lieutenant governor in 1998, the first Latino elected to statewide office in California in more than 120 years. He was also the highest-ranking elected Latino officeholder in the United States until Bill Richardson became governor of New Mexico in 2003.\n\n2003 recall election\n\n[edit]\n\nHe was the most prominent Democrat to run in the 2003 California recall election to remove Governor Gray Davis, and placed second to Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger, losing by 17 points. (see full election results).\n\nBustamante had an apparently icy relationship with Governor Davis, a fellow Democrat, during his tenure. They reportedly had not talked in months before the recall election approached. Bustamante's decision to run in the recall election was controversial, as many supporters of Governor Davis had urged prominent Democrats not to run, in an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of the event. During the recall election, Bustamante ran on a platform slogan of \"No on Recall, Yes on Bustamante,\"[3][4] indicating he opposed the recall.\n\n2006 insurance commissioner election\n\n[edit]\n\nBustamante was the Democratic nominee for California insurance commissioner in 2006. In his official candidate statement, he said \"I want to become an example to others to lead healthier lives by losing weight myself. Obesity in California costs $7.7 billion a year.\" Bustamante claimed to have shed 43 pounds, to a weight of 235 pounds, by means of diet and exercise.[5]\n\nHe easily won the June 6, 2006 Democratic primary, receiving 70.5% of the vote and defeating his challenger, John Kraft. Bustamante received 1,606,913 votes to 674,309 for Kraft. Many political analysts believed that Kraft, who ran a low-key campaign where he took no campaign contributions, received those votes as a protest for Bustamante's behavior during the 2003 recall election.[6] However, Kraft planned to actively campaign for Bustamante in the general election, and donated a significant portion of his fortune as an heir to Kraft Foods to Bustamante's campaign.[7]\n\nBustamante ran against Republican Steve Poizner in November. Bustamante announced that he would not be returning insurance industry contributions to his campaign, a position criticized by Poizner and campaign ethicists. Bustamante also failed to meet a deadline to submit a campaign statement to voters. According to the Field Poll, on November 3, 2006, Bustamante trailed Poizner by 9%.[8] and lost to Poizner by 12% in the general election.\n\nIt was speculated that Bustamante would run for the U.S. House of Representatives in California's 21st congressional district in 2012,[9] but ultimately he did not run.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nWith his wife Arcelia, Bustamante has three children.\n\nElectoral history\n\n[edit]\n\nPublic offices Office Type Location Elected Term began Term ended State Assemblyman Legislature Sacramento 1993 May 3, 1993 December 5, 1994 State Assemblyman Legislature Sacramento 1994 December 5, 1994 December 2, 1996 Speaker of the Assembly Legislature Sacramento 1996 December 2, 1996 December 7, 1998 Lieutenant Governor Executive Sacramento 1998 January 4, 1999 January 6, 2003 Lieutenant Governor Executive Sacramento 2002 January 6, 2003 January 8, 2007\n\nCalifornia State Assembly service Session Majority Governor Committees District 1993–1994 Democratic Pete Wilson 31 1995–1996 Republican Pete Wilson 31 1997–1998 Democratic Pete Wilson 31\n\nCalifornia Lieutenant Governor general election, 1998 Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 8,143,341 Majority 1,129,442 13.9 Democratic hold\n\nCalifornia Lieutenant Governor general election, 2002 Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 7,411,160 Majority 564,550 7.6 −6.3 Democratic hold Swing −6.3\n\nCalifornia recall election, 2003 Party Candidate Votes %\n\nCalifornia Insurance Commissioner primary election, 2006 Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 2,345,520 Majority 958,196 40.8\n\nCalifornia Insurance Commissioner general election, 2006 Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 8,329,397 Majority 1,029,450 12.3 Republican gain from Democratic\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of minority governors and lieutenant governors in the United States\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nCalifornia portal\n\nCalifornia June Primary Results\n\nCruz Bustamante on Manny Fernandez Internet Media Mogal\n\nAppearances on C-SPAN"
