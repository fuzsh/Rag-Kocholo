        "text": "GOV. ARNOLD Schwarzenegger’s choice of state Sen. Abel Maldonado to replace John Garamendi as lieutenant governor won’t please right-wing Republicans or liberal Democrats, which is one reason Maldonado is a good selection.\n\nThe Santa Maria Republican broke ranks with his party to provide a crucial vote last winter approving tax increases to help balance the state budget. The impasse over the budget necessitated some compromise on both spending and taxes.\n\nDemocrats reluctantly agreed to significant spending reductions, arguably not enough, but almost all Republicans opposed any tax increases.\n\nMaldonado, however, was willing to compromise and voted for tax increases after lawmakers agreed to place a constitutional amendment on the June 2010 ballot to create open primaries in state elections. The purpose is to give moderates of both parties a better chance of election, something that frightens Democratic and Republican party leaders.\n\nDemocratic leaders have said the governor should replace Garamendi with another Democrat. We wonder if they would expect a Democratic governor to appoint a Republican to replace a GOP statewide constitutional officeholder.\n\nHowever, some Democrats might wish to confirm Maldonado because it would give them a chance to replace a Republican in the state Senate.\n\nRepublican opposition to Maldonado’s appointment is senseless. He has generally voted with his party, but he’s also been willing to move to the center and make compromises. For example, he strongly supported Schwarzenegger’s minimum-wage increase in 2006, despite opposition from GOP leaders in the business and farming communities.\n\nTo his credit, Maldonado believed his constituents’ economic interests were more important than party dogma.\n\nIt also does no good for GOP long-term prospects to oppose a Republican who would become the only Latino in statewide office if he is confirmed.\n\nSchwarzenegger made the right move in selecting a moderate to fill the vacant lieutenant governor’s seat. If California had a fair-minded, nonideological Legislature, we believe Maldonado would be easily confirmed. Unfortunately, that is not the case, and Maldonado faces an uphill battle.\n\nUnder the state constitution, the Legislature has 90 days to act on Maldonado’s appointment. If either the Senate or Assembly rejects him on a majority vote, he will stay in the Senate. The two houses can approve Maldonado on a majority vote or fail to act within 90 days, in which case he would become lieutenant governor.\n\nWe urge legislators of both parties to confirm Maldonado, a moderate legislator who has demonstrated an ability to put pragmatism ahead of party ideology."
