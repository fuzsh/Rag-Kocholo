        "text": "SACRAMENTO — In an extraordinary legal power play, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger insisted that Sen. Abel Maldonado, R-Santa Maria, will be sworn in as lieutenant governor even after the Assembly failed to confirm him in a long, drawn-out vote Thursday.\n\nSchwarzenegger’s legal team said that Maldonado was effectively confirmed because the Legislature failed to put up a majority — 41 of 80 votes — to reject him.\n\nThe Assembly voted 37-35 to confirm Maldonado, with 28 yes votes coming from Republicans, eight from Democrats and one from the lone independent — four votes shy of the 41 needed for confirmation.\n\nThe administration said it plans to swear him in on Feb. 23, despite legal questions surrounding the confirmation vote and what would appear to be a certain legal showdown.\n\n“This is great news for California and it is time now to focus on creating jobs and solving the budget crisis,” Schwarzenegger said in a written statement.\n\nMaldonado was less than celebratory after the vote, saying only, “I feel honored and I feel great with the vote that I received,” before leaving through a side door of a news conference room and deferring to Dan Maguire, Schwarzenegger’s deputy legal affairs officer.\n\nDemocrats insisted the vote was a rejection of Maldonado, and that they would refuse to recognize him as lieutenant governor.\n\n“I want to be clear: this nomination failed confirmation,” said Assembly Speaker John Perez, D-Los Angeles. “Senator Maldonado failed to get a majority of the members of the Assembly to deem him worthy of their vote. The Governor’s assertions to the contrary show that, once again, he thinks he can impose his will on the Legislature.”\n\nThe administration said the state constitution says that if the Legislature fails to confirm or reject the nomination, the nominee takes office.\n\n“The constitution is clear,” Maguire said. “They have to reject. It’s a different word than fail. Rejection is an affirmative act, which the Legislature hasn’t taken.”\n\nDemocrats distributed a legal opinion from 1988 — surrounding the Legislature’s rejection of Dan Lungren for state treasurer — in which the legislative counsel said a vote for confirmation must reach the majority-vote threshold; and if it didn’t, it constituted a rejection.\n\nIt is unclear where the dispute is headed. Democrats said it is possible they would take legal action. They said they could also ask Secretary of State Debra Bowen to not certify him as an incumbent when Maldonado files an application to run in the June primary. And they could take up another vote to reject Maldonado. There were six Democrats who were either not present or didn’t vote.\n\nImmediately after the vote, Republican lawmakers appeared to accept the vote as a rejection, accusing Democrats of poisoning the atmosphere — an issue they appear poised to use as a campaign issue.\n\n“This is more than a lack of bipartisanship,” said Assemblyman Jim Nielsen, R-Redding. “It’s arrogance I’ve not seen emulated in a long time here. It’s a sorry way to begin the year. This heavy handedness is a signal to Republicans and the people ‘we don’t care about you, we’re going to do it our way. People are rightly angry at this institution.”\n\nThe nomination battle had been months in the making, and was a test of wills between Democrats who believed Maldonado should not be given a seat that would confer upon him incumbency status, and Republicans who claimed Democrats should not inject partisan politics in a confirmation battle.\n\nThe Senate had approved Maldonado’s nomination earlier in the day, throwing his fate into the hands of the more hostile Assembly chamber.\n\nThough Republicans had expressed resentment toward Maldonado for the vote he took last February for a $12.5 billion tax hike, they went to bat for him on the Assembly floor. Republicans cast the fight in terms of whether the Legislature could overcome its dysfunctional reputation.\n\n“We have an opportunity to demonstrate from time to time that we can make decisions in the best interests of the people,” said Assemblyman Nathan Fletcher, R-San Diego. “We can set aside petty differences, we can set aside politics and partisanship and show everyone that California has a government that can function.”\n\nBut Democrats said that Schwarzenegger had politicized the nomination when he chose Maldonado, who has made it clear he will run for lieutenant governor in the fall.\n\n“I’d have hoped the governor would have appointed someone not committed to running,” said Assemblyman Sandre Swanson, D-Oakland. “Someone that can concentrate on the business of the state and the crisis we face.”\n\nAssemblyman Charles Calderon, D-Los Angeles, called Maldonado’s appointment the result of “backroom politics where the power brokers gather behind closed doors and carve up the political goods.”\n\nMaldonado would get his “plum,” the advantage of incumbency going into the fall and Sen. Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento, would get the chance to pick up Maldonado’s seat to move closer to a two-thirds majority, Calderon said.\n\n“Does anyone believe this is the kind of bipartisanship people have asked us to engage in?” Calderon asked. “Once you strip the facade of nonpartisanship away, there’s no reason to confirm Mr. Maldonado.”\n\nAssemblyman Juan Arambula, a former Democrat who is now the only independent in the chamber, said he feared that a move to reject Maldonado could further corrode the already poisonous atmosphere at the Capitol.\n\n“If we reject Sen. Maldonado, we will be perceived as putting partisanship above what’s good for the state,” he said. “And the next time when we need somebody to cross that aisle, that chasm between the two political parties, that people won’t be willing to come forward and do what Sen. Maldonado has done.”\n\nA vote for Maldonado would only reward a dysfunctional system that requires a two-thirds super majority vote to get a budget or taxes done, said Assembly Majority Floor Leader Alberto Torrico, D-Fremont.\n\n“Today is the culmination of a broken political system that invests in too few people the power to dictate the terms of a budget,” Torrico said. “Today is the culmination of a vote that got us a budget but also that is being leveraged for personal gain. That’s what’s at stake. We cannot reward this system. We cannot reward this nomination.”\n\nReach Steven Harmon at 916-441-2101."
