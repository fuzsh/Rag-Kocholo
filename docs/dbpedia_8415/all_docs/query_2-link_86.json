        "text": "Republican Lt. Gov. Abel Maldonado was appointed to office earlier this year by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, giving him the advantage of incumbency against San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom as both vie to become the state”s stand-in governor.\n\nOur choice is Maldonado, and not just because he formerly represented parts of Santa Cruz County in the state Senate.\n\nWhile both men are probably seeing this office as a springboard to eventually becoming governor — Newsom dropped out of the Democratic primary last spring when it became apparent he wouldn”t be able to defeat Jerry Brown — Maldonado has a proven track record in state government that shows him capable of bipartisan leadership.\n\nHis successful championing of an open primary for the state, along with his willingness to buck his own party to vote for modest tax increases to balance last year”s state budget, were both principled stands that should serve him well if the polls hold up and Brown is elected governor.\n\nNewsom has been an effective mayor of San Francisco and has also shown an ability to take on more extreme members of his own political party. Doubtlessly, he has a bright political future. But it”s worth asking what kind of a commitment he would bring to an admittedly low-profile job such as lieutenant governor.\n\nMaldonado has already shown he”s adept at the job and should be elected to a full four-year term."
