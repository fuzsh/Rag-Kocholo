        "text": "SPENCER MICHELS:\n\nConsidered a crucial event in the campaign, the long-awaited debate was carried on more than 100 California TV and radio stations, according to the sponsor, the California Broadcasters Association. The group invited the five candidates it figured had a chance to win, based on recent polls. Although the questions were submitted to the candidates in advance, the follow-up questions and the discussion were not scripted, and everyone took advantage of that, turning the event into a theatrical free- for-all. Here's an exchange between independent Arianna Huffington, Democratic Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante, GOP State Senator Tom McClintock, and actor Arnold Schwarnegger, on how to enhance state revenues, a key topic in a state with a huge budget deficit.\n\nARIANNA HUFFINGTON:\n\nWell, the first thing I would do is close corporate tax loopholes. And what I find amazing is that Republicans really do not believe that morality applies to businesses. You know, morality for them is just sexual morality.\n\nARONLD SCHWARZENEGGER:\n\n…You personally… your personal income tax has the biggest loophole. I can drive my hummer through it. That's how big your loophole is. ( Laughter ) let me tell you something. I don't know what you're talking about.\n\nLT. GOV. CRUZ BUSTAMANTE:\n\nWe spent more then… as a government. As a government, we spent more than was coming in. There's no rocket science to this. We've done all the easy things, and now it's time to do the tough things.\n\nARONLD SCHWARZENEGGER:\n\nI don't understand the whole thing. So what you're saying is that… the politicians make a mistake; they keep spending and spending and spending, and then when they realize they made a mistake and spent money they don't even have, then they go out, they go tax, tax, tax. You guys have an addiction problem. You should go to an addiction place, because you cannot stop spending. (Applause )\n\nSPENCER MICHELS:\n\nGovernor Davis did not take part in the debate. With the election just 12 days away, the polls show Davis trailing, though not as much as earlier, on the question of whether he should be recalled. 53 percent of likely voters would remove him, while 42 percent intend to vote against the recall. Among candidates to replace Davis should he lose: Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante leads with 28 percent; Arnold Schwarzenegger has 26 percent; and State Senator Tom McClintock, 14, up 5 percent from a month ago. McClintock, regarded as the most conservative in the race, has continued to resist pressure to withdraw and leave the Republican field to Schwarzenegger.\n\nARONLD SCHWARZENEGGER:\n\nWe have the worst economic atmosphere, the worst business atmosphere in California. And what we see is that because of that, businesses are leaving the state and jobs are leaving the state.\n\nPETER CAMEJO:\n\nPeople are not leaving California; they're pouring in to California. We're having a jobless recovery. That is, the corporations are making more money than ever before, but not the people.\n\nSPENCER MICHELS:\n\nRepublican Congressman Darrel Issa, who financed the recall drive and then dropped out of the race for governor, fears a split republican vote would mean a victory by the Democrat Bustamante, whom he regards as too liberal.\n\nLT. GOV. CRUZ BUSTAMANTE:\n\nThe one thing you shouldn't do, Stan, just sort of in life is take it out on the kids. You know, I mean, it's not their fault that their parents are here. They're also the same people who work hard every single day. They pay their taxes. They stay out of trouble with the law. You know, for them not to be able to have a driver's license or to be able to put their kids into school, I think is just wrong.\n\nARONLD SCHWARZENEGGER:\n\nI'm very passionate about children's issues. I think we have to take care of our children, and we have to take care of our seniors. This is very important because they cannot fend for themselves.\n\nSTATE SEN. TOM McCLINTOCK:\n\nWe are talking about families that are in this country in violation of our nation's immigration laws. And I don't believe that we should be rewarding such behavior.\n\nSPENCER MICHELS:\n\nThe debate came just a day after the U.S. Court of appeals unanimously ruled to let the recall election be held on October 7, despite claims by the American civil liberties union that the use of outmoded punch cards in six counties would disenfranchise minority voters. The A.C.L.U. Decided not to appeal the ruling, and so the election and the debate rolled on. President bush and former Governor Pete Wilson became issues that Schwarzenegger had to deal with.\n\nARONLD SCHWARZENEGGER:\n\n…Then you have to tax, tax, tax. You know, and then all of a sudden, you say where are the jobs? Gone, gone, gone.\n\nARONLD SCHWARZENEGGER:\n\nI think they should continue with the services, if it's job training, or if it is drug rehabilitation programs, or the services they provide with police and fire department; all of those kinds of things that they should have their own way of funding those programs.\n\nARONLD SCHWARZENEGGER:\n\nLet me make one thing clear. Let me make one thing clear. On October 8, it's not going to be governor Wilson or Governor Bush or any of those kind of things, it's going to be Governor Arnold, okay? So let's make this clear.\n\nSPENCER MICHELS:\n\nBustamante received a setback this week, when a state judge ordered him to give back any money left from $4 million in campaign contributions from Indian tribes and labor unions. The lieutenant governor had used a finance loophole to gather and spend the money. Meanwhile, Governor Davis, fighting to keep his job, has appeared around the state with a series of high profile Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, former Vice President Al Gore, Jesse Jackson, and several presidential hopefuls.\n\nSPENCER MICHELS:\n\nAnd the governor has been playing this commercial depicting the recall as a circus, embarrassing to the state. News reports say that last night's debate did nothing to change that image, though pollsters say they expected the debate to be extremely influential. They say voters have shown a heightened interest in California politics because of the recall, the debate, and the star power of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who says that he will not take part in the remaining debates. A large turnout is expected October 7."
