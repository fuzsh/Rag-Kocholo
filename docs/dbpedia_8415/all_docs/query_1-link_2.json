        "text": "US: With polls suggesting that California's recall election had become a two-man race between Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lt Governor Cruz Bustamante, the film- star has begun taking shots at his Democratic rival.\n\nAppearing on radio talk shows one day after a Los Angeles Times poll showed him trailing Mr Bustamante by more than 10 points, Mr Schwarzenegger sought to link the career politician to Governor Gray Davis - the recall's target and one of the most unpopular statewide leaders in Californian history.\n\n\"People just have to understand that when you think of Gray Davis you have to think at the same time of Bustamante,\" Mr Schwarzenegger told a San Diego-based radio station. \"It's like one newspaper pointed out: 'Bustamante is Gray Davis with a receding hairline and a moustache'.\" The comments are the most direct criticisms Mr Schwarzenegger has lobbed so far in the campaign, and they suggest that he now considers Mr Bustamante - and not the embattled Davis - his major obstacle to the governor's mansion.\n\nMr Bustamante received his second key endorsement in a week on Monday when Democrats in the state senate backed his candidacy should the recall against Mr Davis succeed. California's Congressional Democrats had endorsed him last week.\n\nJust weeks ago Democrats shied away from backing any alternative candidates on the second part of the ballot, believing that such an effort would sap support for Mr Davis.\n\n\"Bustamante and Davis have been overspending, overtaxing, and over-regulating,\" said Mr Schwarzenegger on another radio show.\n\n\"They spent too much money and they go now and want to tax people to punish them for \\ mistakes.\" Mr Schwarzenegger, a moderate who is still courting the conservative wing of the Republican party, also invoked the name of former president Ronald Reagan, the actor who went on to become one of the most revered conservative politicians in state history.\n\n\"I will give power back to the people,\" he said. \"Remember what Ronald Reagan said: 'This is America, a shining city on the hill'.\" - (Reuters)"
