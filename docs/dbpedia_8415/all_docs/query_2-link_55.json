        "text": "SACRAMENTO - The state Senate on Thursday confirmed Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's pick for California lieutenant governor, as lawmakers cast the vote as a test of whether a Legislature that has fallen into public disfavor has any ability to compromise.\n\nSenators voted 26-7 in favor of Republican state Sen. Abel Maldonado of Santa Maria. His nomination initially failed to generate majority support in the Assembly, but the chamber then voted to reconsider the nomination later in the day.\n\nIf he eventually is confirmed, Maldonado, would fill the seat that has been vacant since Democrat John Garamendi won a congressional seat last November. The 42-year-old son of farmworkers would become the highest-ranking Hispanic in state government unless the Assembly rejects the nomination.\n\nSchwarzenegger's nomination of a Republican to fill an elected seat that had been held by a Democrat was just one flash point, with Democrats holding majorities in both houses. But several Republican lawmakers also voted against Maldonado, who last year sided with Democrats to raise taxes.\n\nMaldonado's ability to take a centrist course is one of the main reasons Schwarzenegger nominated him to fill the seat. It also was among the reasons several of his colleagues in the Senate urged his confirmation.\n\nMany of them noted the low esteem with which Californians hold the Legislature.\n\n\"We must take a vote that's not simply to confirm Abel Maldonado but one that confirms our values and commitments to work together, to be partisan. That's what the people want,\" said Sen. Gil Cedillo, a Los Angeles Democrat who is best known for promoting bills that would allow illegal immigrants to hold driver's licenses.\n\nSen. Bob Dutton, R-Rancho Cucamonga, who will soon become minority leader, also urged approval despite differing with Maldonado on his vote last year for temporary tax increases to help bridge the state's massive budget gap.\n\nHe and other lawmakers from both parties said the vote on Maldonado's confirmation was not a time to argue over policy or engage in election-year campaigning on behalf of others who plan to run for the seat.\n\nMaldonaldo also intends to seek the Republican nomination in the June primary.\n\n\"Put politics aside, let's get our job done, and let's fight it out in June and November,\" said Sen. Gloria Romero, D-Los Angeles, who voted for the confirmation.\n\nDespite the pleas for bipartisanship, Maldonado's fate in the 80-member Assembly seemed tied directly to political calculation. Some lawmakers said confirming Maldonado would give him an unfair advantage in this year's election. Many said it would be better to simply leave the post vacant until the voters have their say in November.\n\n\"The governor should send us a candidate who's only interest over the next 10 months is to serve the state and is not distracted by the politics of the ... season,\" said Sandre Swanson, D-Alameda.\n\nIn both chambers, Democrats have been concerned that Maldonado could drop his previous opposition to Schwarzenegger's proposal for offshore oil drilling. As lieutenant governor, he would sit on the State Lands Commission, which decides such issues.\n\nThe lieutenant governor also is the president of the Senate, casting a vote in the event of a tie. The post also has a seat on the University of California Board of Regents and the California State University Board of Trustees.\n\nThe most important role of the lieutenant governor is to fill in as the state's chief executive when the governor is out of state."
