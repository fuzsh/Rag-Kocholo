        "text": "The new numbers for Bustamante differ from others released lately. Surveys by the Public Policy Institute of California and Field Poll showed Bustamante and Schwarzenegger within five percentage points of each other.\n\nBehind Schwarzenegger in the Times poll were three other Republicans: state Senator Tom McClintock, with 12%; former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth, with 7%; and Bill Simon, with 6%.\n\nSimon, who won the Republican primary last year but lost to Davis by five percentage points in November, backed out of the race Saturday. He said his decision was based on his belief that there were “too many Republicans” in the race, and the poll results may bear that out.\n\nSix out of 10 Democrats said they had decided who to support in the recall, compared with 46% of Republicans.\n\nPolitical commentator Arianna Huffington, who is running a nonpartisan campaign, was named by 3% of respondents, and Green Party candidate Peter Camejo tied Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt with 1%.\n\nThe poll results also showed much could change before the October 7 special election. Among likely voters, 46% said they might change their mind about who to support.\n\nThe poll surveyed 1,351 people, identifying 801 likely voters, between August 16 and August 21. Its margin of error was plus or minus three percentage points."
