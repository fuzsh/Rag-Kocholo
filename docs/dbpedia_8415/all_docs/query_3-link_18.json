        "text": "Davis appears with Feinstein\n\nLOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante picked up a key endorsement from fellow Democrats Thursday in California's gubernatorial recall election.\n\nCalifornia's congressional delegation of 33 House Democrats endorsed Bustamante even as they stressed their opposition to the October 7 recall.\n\n\"We strongly oppose the recall, but if California voters make a different choice, then Lt. Gov. Bustamante is the appropriate person to assume the office,\" said a written statement released by Rep. Zoe Lofgren, chairwoman of the state's Democratic congressional delegation of 33 House Democrats.\n\nBustamante, the only top Democrat on the recall ballot, also gained the endorsement Thursday of the California Teachers Association.\n\nThe object of the recall effort, Gov. Gray Davis, said he understands \"the desire of some people who want to have a fallback position. I'm happy that Democrats are united against the recall.\"\n\nBut Davis, speaking after an event with the California Black Chamber of Commerce in Millbrae, said he is focused instead on \"getting people to understand that recalls will breed more recalls will breed more recalls, and all of a sudden there will be no time to do the job that people elected us to do.\"\n\nEarlier, Davis held a news conference with Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat and arguably the state's most popular politician.\n\nFeinstein has steadfastly refused to endorse any Democrat should the recall succeed and she has ruled herself out as a candidate.\n\nThursday she said she wouldn't even vote on the second part of the recall ballot -- who should replace Davis -- a stance that puts her at odds with the state's Democratic congressional delegation.\n\nFeinstein was highly critical of the leading Republican in the recall race -- actor Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nShe appeared with Davis in Los Angeles, where the two called on Congress to make permanent a ban on assault weapons. Feinstein made note of Schwarzenegger's often violent movies, such as the popular \"Terminator\" films.\n\nShe called him an \"intimidating figure\" in the movies and suggested his films weren't helpful to efforts to cut down on violence in the state.\n\n\"I don't consider these kinds of things terribly healthy for a society,\" she said.\n\nFor his part, Davis predicted he would prevail, and he played down suggestions that Bustamante's candidacy had hurt his effort to present Democratic unity and defeat the recall.\n\n\"It's quite possible that his entry will bring more people to the polls, who are inclined to vote no,\" Davis said.\n\nThe recall moved forward in the wake of a decision Wednesday by a federal judge Wednesday not to delay the recall, as sought by the American Civil Liberties Union.(Full story)\n\nAt a San Francisco news conference, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi spoke at length against the recall, only briefly mentioning the delegation's support for Bustamante, a delicate issue in light of Davis' sinking popularity.\n\n\"We have decided to as strongly and vocally and as forcefully as we can, to oppose the recall,\" Pelosi said.\n\n\"Recognizing that there is a part two on the ballot, which there shouldn't be, Bustamante is the legitimate successor to the governor, and so we urge a 'yes' vote on Bustamante.\"\n\nThe recall was triggered by voter anger over the state's economic and energy woes.\n\nA recent budget agreement between Democratic and Republican legislators in Sacramento eliminated a $38 billion deficit through cuts and borrowing, but it created an expected shortfall of at least $8 billion for the next fiscal year.\n\nA recent poll indicated that 58 percent of California voters would support ousting Davis in the recall. On the same ballot, 135 candidates -- ranging from Bustamante to former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth, pornography magnate Larry Flynt, Hollywood billboard pinup Angelyne and former child actor Gary Coleman -- are vying to replace him.\n\nAt her news conference, Pelosi said the recall against Davis runs counter to the original intent of California's recall law.\n\n\"Now, those with money think they could buy a boat, or they could buy a piece of jewelry or they could buy an election. And that's exactly what they have done,\" she said.\n\n\"Now, we're saying to politicians, 'You better worry every second, about every act of courage you may want to perform politically, because there's somebody with a few million dollars, and some time on his hands, that may want to put a recall on the ballot.\"\n\nWednesday, businessman Peter Ueberroth, a former baseball commissioner, formally kicked off his Republican campaign, offering an economic plan that focuses on tax amnesty, spending cuts and protecting a voter-imposed cap on property tax rates.(Full story)\n\nSchwarzenegger, the most prominent Republican vying to replace Davis, met Wednesday with his high-profile \"California Economic Recovery Council.\" The panel includes billionaire investor Warren Buffett, former Secretary of State George Shultz and Michael Boskin, former President Bush's top economic adviser.(Full story)\n\nFrom CNN Political Editor John Mercurio in Los Angeles and CNN.com Producer Sean Loughlin and Capitol Hill Producer Ted Barrett in Washington.\n\nClick Here to try 4 Free Trial Issues of Time!"
