        "text": "SACRAMENTO — Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has tapped a moderate Republi­can who represents parts of Silicon Valley to fill the lieu­tenant governor”s vacancy, a move that could ultimate­ly bring Democrats closer to a two-thirds majority in the Senate.\n\nThe Republican governor selected Sen. Abel Maldona­do, R-Santa Maria — whose district includes part of San­ta Cruz County — to succeed John Garamendi, who was elected to Congress earlier this month, announcing the choice in the taping of the Jay Leno show Monday.\n\nIt came in less dramat­ic fashion than his own announcement for gover­nor in 2003, but entertain­ing nonetheless. Leno asked if he was ready to make the decision. Schwarznegger said, “well, we can do it right here. … So, why not? We have already a tradition. I announced my candidacy right here on the show.”\n\nSchwar­zenegger called Maldo­nado a “ter­rific, loyal man” who”s “into bipar­tisanship and postpar­tisanship, so he can cross the aisle.”\n\nThe choice could set off an intriguing 90 days as the Democrat-controlled Legis­lature ponders whether to confirm him. They must confirm him by Feb. 21.\n\n“It”s a very difficult deci­sion,” said Steve Maviglio, former deputy chief of staff to ex-Speaker Fabian Nunez. “To turn down a moderate Latino would be politically vexing. And, it”s an enormous opportunity for Democrats. But there will be a lot of angst in the Senate caucus.” The governor”s move rewarded Maldonado for a number of decisive votes he has cast to gain passage of budgets and, in one case, tax increases. Having a moder­ate Latino provides a more diverse look to Republicans, one of Schwarzenegger”s goals before leaving office in little more than a year.\n\nAnd, it is perhaps the only Republican pick Schwar­zenegger could have made that stands a good chance of confirmation. It gives Dem­ocrats a chance to pick up a seat that leans Democrat­ic, which would give them 26 seats, one shy of a two­thirds majority required to pass budgets and taxes.\n\nA wrinkle, however, in those plans could come from within. Sen. Dean Flo­rez, D-Fresno, and Janice Hahn, a Los Angeles city councilwoman, both have plans to run for lieutenant governor. Florez expressed disappointment with the pick.\n\n“At minimum, since the lieutenant governor seat was held by a Democrat, appointing a Republican to the post only complicates and heightens the partisan divide,” Florez said in a pre­pared statement. “I don”t see the Senate confirming him.”"
