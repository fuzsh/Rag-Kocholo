        "text": "Updated with reactions.\n\nGov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s office announced yesterday that the big guy had tapped moderate Republican State Sen. Abel Maldonado of Santa Maria as California’s next lieutenant governor.\n\n“Sen. Maldonado has proven he has the strength and courage it takes to reach across the partisan divide and put the interests of Californians first and he is absolutely the most qualified person to take on the role of Lieutenant Governor,” the governor said in a statement. “Sen. Maldonado shares my commitment to creating a transparent, accountable government that works for the people. He will be a true partner in solving the critical issues facing our state and building a stronger future for California.”\n\nThe lieutenant governor’s office was open because the guy the voters put there, John Garamendi, recently was elected to Congress. The office is often called the lite governor in Sacramento because it has very few responsibilities. Basically, the lieutenant governor’s primary function is to serve as acting governor when the real governor is out of the state or otherwise unable to perform his duties, as when Arnold was under the knife a few years back for his skiing injury.\n\nAnyway, Maldonado is known for subscribing to a moderate brand of GOP politics, much like the governor himself, and for being nakedly ambitious.\n\nEarlier this year, he used his leverage as one of the few swing votes on the budget to extract a number of concessions from the entire State Legislature, including putting a measure on the ballot to legalize open primaries, which would help moderates like him.\n\nMaldonado’s move to lite governor’s office will free up an opening in his State Senate seat, which is very competitive. It’s conceivable that Democrats could win his seat. In fact, Democratic political strategist Steve Maviglio predicted on his Facebook page that “Maldo for Lt. Gov. means the (Senate) district will finally get the representation it deserves. (Former Assembly Democrat) John Laird for Senate!”\n\nMeanwhile, Maldonado, who has said he would run for statewide office in 2010, is now going to be campaigning as the state’s incumbent lieutenant governor, which will give him a leg up against his Democratic competitors.\n\n“I’m honored to take on the position of Lieutenant Governor and I look forward to working with the Governor to tackle important issues facing California and to ensure all Californians have the opportunity to realize their own American Dream,” Maldonado said in a statement.\n\nReaction to Maldonado’s appointment was mixed. Senate Republican Leader Dennis Hollingsworth of Murrieta, who was often at odds with the moderate senator, congratulated Maldonado, calling him “an effective leader for California” and “a valuable member of the Senate Republican Caucus.”\n\nOn the other hand, Randy Thomasson, president of the anti-gay marriage SaveCalifornia.com, said in a statement that “The only good thing about this is that, if confirmed, Abel Maldonado won’t get to vote against family values anytime soon because the Lt. Governor job has virtually no power.”\n\nMaldonado’s appointment raises the number of Republicans in statewide office from two to three (besides Arnold, the other statewide Republican in office is Insurance Commission Steve Poizner). However, Maldonado’s appointment is sure to anger some Republicans because of Maldonado’s moderate leanings.\n\nRepublican State Sen. Sam Aanestad of Grass Valley, who is a candidate for Lt. Governor next year and, wrote on his Facebook page that he “is looking forward to the Lt. Gov. Republican primary election next June. Prediction: the voters will like Sam, the experienced, conservative in the race.”\n\nIf anything, you can predict blood in that primary. Aanestad and Maldonado have a history of not getting along. They were so at odds at one point a couple of years ago that Maldonado requested that he change seats on the Senate floor to get away from Aanestad."
