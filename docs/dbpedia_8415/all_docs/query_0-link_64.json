        "text": "A political campaign, like an act of love or a basketball game or a night at the opera, has an arc that is shaped by the participants’ knowledge of how long it is going to last. As far as the California recall is concerned, last Monday’s decision by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, ordering the postponement of the whole thing from October 7th to God knows when, blew that knowledge straight to hell. The candidates were running flat out in a race that was supposed to be all homestretch. Each of the four major ones could see things going his way. The incumbent Governor, Gray Davis, was picking up speed. Bill Clinton was in the state, campaigning for him; Al Gore was on his way; one by one, starting with Howard Dean, the Democratic Presidential candidates were arriving to pledge fealty. The polls still showed a majority for yanking the Governor, but the gap was narrowing. So Davis was hopeful. In the other part of the election, which counts if Davis is recalled, the self-selected, not quite official Democratic candidate, Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante, was ahead of the pack. He was drawing thirty per cent in the polls, five points ahead of his nearest rival. So Bustamante was hopeful. That nearest rival, Arnold Schwarzenegger, was raising cash at a tremendous clip, attracting big crowds, consolidating the support of the state’s Republican establishment, and flooding the airwaves with thirty-second spots. His campaign was confident that the other important Republican in the race would eventually withdraw. So Schwarzenegger was hopeful. That other Republican, Tom McClintock, a state senator, owns the hearts of California’s movement conservatives, who for a decade have dominated the Party’s activist core and primary electorate. McClintock didn’t have much money, but he was gaining ground. In both of the state’s leading polls, the Field Poll and the Los Angeles Times Poll, he was up by half, to thirteen per cent and eighteen per cent, respectively. So McClintock was hopeful. The two visible candidates on the “progressive” left, the columnist Arianna Huffington and the Green Party’s Peter Camajo, were not hopeful—not about winning, anyway—but they seemed to be enjoying themselves. The media were having a ball; the voters, to all appearances, were engaged. Then, boom. Electio interrupta.\n\nWhat does it all mean, politically speaking? Who knows? If the ruling (in which the word “chad” appears eighteen times, and which makes sly use of the Supreme Court’s logic in Bush v. Gore) stands, it will supposedly help Davis, because there will be more time for him to make his case, which is more nuanced than the case for throwing him out, and hurt Schwarzenegger, because there will be more time for him to make a mistake, and maybe hurt Bustamante, too, because the more voters learn about him the less they seem to like him. But if the ruling stands and the recall is rescheduled for March 2nd, the date of the Presidential primary, that will supposedly help Bustamante as well as Davis, because the Democrats’ lively Presidential contest will draw their voters to the polls. But if the ruling is overturned by the United States Supreme Court, that will supposedly help the Democrats, too, because it will stoke their anger with memories of 2000. But if the ruling is overturned by the Ninth Circuit itself (a more likely outcome, according to some), it will help the Republicans, because they have already been energized by rage.\n\nNo matter whom any of this craziness is good for or bad for, the decision discombobulated everybody. No one had the slightest idea what to do. So everybody just kept running straight ahead at top speed, like Looney Tunes characters who’ve just gone off a cliff. Their feet are churning furiously, but the vertigo is something fierce. In such a situation, might it not be an advantage to be a master of special effects?\n\nOn October 8, 1993—a day short of exactly ten years before the originally scheduled date of California’s recall election—one of Sylvester Stallone’s better movies opened wide at area theatres. In “Demolition Man,” Stallone played a Los Angeles cop, cryogenically frozen around the turn of the century as punishment for a bum rap, who is thawed out in the year 2032 to give chase to his similarly thawed-out criminal nemesis. He teams up with Sandra Bullock, a new-style nicey-nice police officer. As she is showing him around the L.A. of the future—where everything is tidy, corporate, and bland—he does a double take when she mentions the “Schwarzenegger Presidential Library.” Decades before, Bullock explains perkily, Arnold Schwarzenegger became so popular that the American people waived the technicalities and made him their maximum leader.\n\nThis was satire, not prognostication. Either way, though, it appears, at the moment, to be right on schedule. The big technicality, of course, is a clause in Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution—the one that states, “No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President.” On July 10th, Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, quietly introduced what he hopes will become the twenty-eighth amendment:\n\nA person who is a citizen of the United States, who has been for 20 years a citizen of the United States, and who is otherwise eligible to the Office of President, is not ineligible to that Office by reason of not being a native born citizen of the United States.\n\nAs it happens, Arnold Schwarzenegger (who, according to the Deseret News, Hatch’s home-town paper, is both a “pal” and a “fund-raising helper” of the Senator’s) became a citizen of the United States precisely twenty years ago. Hatch is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, where constitutional amendments originate. His amendment stands a good chance of going to the states, thirty-eight of which would be needed for ratification. It would certainly pass in the states where Latino and other foreign-born citizens, now twelve million strong, are concentrated, and legislators elsewhere might support it as a gesture toward the “nation of immigrants” catechism of America’s civic religion. Even so, like any constitutional amendment, it’s a long shot. On the other hand, there are those who think that it doesn’t really matter—who think that Schwarzenegger, amendment or no amendment, will find a way. George Butler, the filmmaker-photographer who chronicled the big man’s rise to fame, told me recently with a chuckle, “If you think Arnold can be stopped by a few phrases on a piece of parchment, well, you just don’t know Arnold.”\n\nBut that’s getting ahead of the game. First, there is the little matter of naming rights to the Schwarzenegger Gubernatorial Library.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger was supposed to be the Grand Marshal of the Mexican Independence Day parade the other Sunday in East Los Angeles. “You are a huge icon for the Spanish community,” the Comité Mexicano Cívico Patriótico had said in its invitation to him, a month earlier. But then the California legislature passed a bill making undocumented aliens eligible for driver’s licenses, and Governor Davis signed it, and Schwarzenegger denounced it. So he was abruptly disinvited, not just from the Grand Marshalship but also from the parade itself, and was left to find something else to do.\n\nThe something else was a kids’ softball tournament under the aegis of an after-school program called the Inner-City Games Los Angeles. It was a campaign event that would have been inconceivable for any other candidate. For one thing, the Inner-City Games Los Angeles (Arnold Schwarzenegger, executive commissioner) has been funded by the Inner-City Games Foundation (Arnold Schwarzenegger, chairman), to which a major donor has been the Hummer division of General Motors (Arnold Schwarzenegger, “unofficial spokesman”). Even leaving that aside, no other candidate could command the attention of eight camera crews and a score or so representatives of the state, national, and international press for what was essentially an exercise in baby-kissing.\n\nThe boys and girls and parents and coaches were mostly Latino, but the event did not take place in anything recognizable as an inner city. Little Lake Park, in Santa Fe Springs, a light-industrial suburb half an hour east of Santa Monica, is a pleasant facility: twenty acres of well-manicured ballfields, edged by tall palms and a capacious grove of shade trees, which shelters a tidy cinder-block cube that serves as a V.F.W. post. It was a beautiful day: shocking-blue sky, light breeze, crystalline air. Shortly after noon, a small convoy of cars arrived, led by an enormous black S.U.V. (a G.M.C. Yukon this time, not a Hummer), and Schwarzenegger, obscured by a vibrating scrum of cameras, cops, and kids, dashed into the building.\n\nWhenever there was movement near the building’s door, the kids craned and jumped and whooped, and when at last the door swung open and the star emerged the screaming began. “Arnold! Arnold!” “I see him!” “Arnold!” “There he is!” Trailed by three unusually large security men wearing navy-blue blazers and corkscrew ear buds, Schwarzenegger emerged and headed for the rope line. He looked like—well, he stood out from his surroundings like no other political candidate I’ve ever seen. He fairly popped out. He looked like a vanilla sundae topped with raspberry sauce. His hair was a rich shade of red that is seldom encountered in nature, and never atop the head of a fifty-six-year-old man. The tan of his skin veered toward orange, and it was dark enough to show through his shirt, which was of the finest, whitest, thinnest cotton voile, delicately ribbed. The cuffs were rolled to mid-forearm, showing a huge Rolex studded with buttons. His trousers were soft and cream-colored. His sneakers were Nikes. His boxy head loomed. His grinning mouth was the shape of a reclining figure eight, fuller at the edges than at the center, like the mouth of a character in a Japanese anime.\n\nOn the platform, Schwarzenegger kept it nonpolitical. “This is a great celebration today because today we are not only here to celebrate sports events but today we are also here to celebrate our twelfth anniversary of the Inner-City Games Los Angeles,” he said, in the singsongy, Austrian-accented voice familiar to every moviegoer. “I remember when we started, twelve years ago. I was very fortunate that at that time I was with the President’s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, and I was travelling all over the country to all fifty states, promoting health and fitness for all our youngsters. And one day I was sitting in President Bush’s office. It was in 1990. And he said to me, ‘Arnold, while you are travelling around the states to all fifty states, make sure to get to as many inner-city schools as possible, because this is where the problems lie. We need to pay more attention to our kids in our inner cities.’ And I promised the President I would do that.”\n\nThe speech done, Schwarzenegger reached into a box of T-shirts and tossed them one by one into the crowd. Then he handshook his way along another line of kids and ducked back into the V.F.W. building, where the press was waiting for a promised “availability.”\n\nCalifornia’s recall mechanism was adopted in 1911, at the crest of the great middle-class reform movement known as Progressivism, which, the following year, produced the Presidential candidacies of both Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt. Progressivism found its purest expression in California, during the Governorship of Hiram Johnson, a maverick Republican. Under Johnson, California wrote into its constitution not only the recall, which allows voters to remove elected officials before their terms have expired, but also the initiative, which allows voters to pass laws, and the referendum, which allows them to repeal them. The initiative and the referendum have played an important part in California history, especially since 1978, when the passage of Proposition 13 rolled back and capped property taxes, commercial and residential alike, and began the long decline in California’s education system and public services. The recall has been much less used. Until this year, no attempt to recall a Governor, or any other statewide elected official, had ever succeeded in getting as far as the ballot.\n\nThe recall is radically democratic in spirit and radically faulty in design. Its ballot asks a two-part question. The first part calls for a simple yes or no answer: Do you want to remove the incumbent? The second part is multiple choice: If the current officeholder is removed (and regardless of whether you just voted to remove or retain him), which of the people on the following list do you prefer as his replacement? Getting on the ballot takes just sixty-five valid voter signatures and a check for thirty-five hundred dollars, making it a remarkably cheap advertising medium. (A half-page ad in the San Francisco Chronicle would cost ten times more.) The wonder is that only a hundred and thirty-five people bothered to buy themselves a spot.\n\nPart one of the ballot is determined by simple majority. Part two is determined by simple plurality—that is, the winning candidate is the one who gets more votes than any one of the others. In theory, then, if the recall passes by a hair and the vote for the replacement is distributed evenly enough, an incumbent with 49.9 per cent of the vote could be “defeated” by a challenger with less than one per cent. In practice, of course, that’s not quite how it’s going to work; a handful of the replacement candidates will tally most of the votes. Nevertheless, it is a near-certainty that, if the recall passes, the winner will be someone preferred by fewer voters than the number who will have expressed a preference for retaining the incumbent. There’s an old political saw that you can’t beat someone with no one. But one of the peculiarities of the California recall process is that the official who is being recalled cannot run to replace himself. So you can, precisely, beat someone with no one. Only then do the voters choose who the no one will be.\n\nSchwarzenegger started out expecting to win a sizable chunk of the Latino vote. His movies are famously popular with young Hispanic men. (Hasta la vista, baby.) Through his charitable work, he has cultivated an image as someone who cares about poor Latinos, and in his business and political activities he has certainly not neglected well-heeled ones. His own coming-to-America story is central to his appeal. But, like every other politician in California, he’s been whipsawed by the politics of immigration, which, besides being an actual substantive issue, is a sinkhole of emotion, prejudice, and demagoguery.\n\nAs the campaign intensified, the sinkhole reopened in the form of the bill in the California legislature to allow illegal aliens to obtain driver’s licenses, as had been the case before 1994. The bill passed on a party-line vote, and on September 5th Davis, who had vetoed a similar bill less than a year before, signed it. On balance, the new law is probably good public policy. There are reasonable arguments on both sides. The politics of it, though, are a straightforward matter of pandering to constituencies. Davis could not afford to anger the organized Latino community; Schwarzenegger could not afford to anger the organized conservative movement. It was a deal breaker for both groups. (The only candidate whose position on the new law was manifestly dictated by its merits was the moderate Republican technocrat Peter Ueberroth, the organizer of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. He came out for it. A few days later, he dropped out of the race.)\n\nSchwarzenegger was already in a bit of trouble with the state’s largest minority. His political mentor is Pete Wilson, Governor throughout most of the nineteen-nineties, who, in 1994, supported Proposition 187, a ballot initiative aimed at cutting off social benefits to undocumented aliens and barring their children from public schools. Prop 187 passed, and it left California Latinos—who usually make up around ten per cent of the electorate, a proportion that is bound to increase (they are a third of the population)—thoroughly alienated from the Republican Party. Wilson is today a co-chairman of Schwarzenegger’s campaign, and Schwarzenegger’s staff consists largely of former Wilson people. To their annoyance, their old boss went on television and pointed out to the world that Arnold had voted for Prop 187. Most of Prop 187 has been thrown out by the courts, and Schwarzenegger has made it clear that he has no desire to revive it. “I would never stand in the way of any child going to school,” he said last year. But the reminder hurt.\n\nInside the V.F.W. building, the crews set up their cameras. There was a podium, flanked by furled American and California flags, and a blue curtain to hide the cinder-block wall. The reporters all shouted their questions at once, like in a movie. Most of them touched on immigration and Latinos. The answers were a fair sample of Arnold off the cuff.\n\n“Everyone knows what I stand for,” Schwarzenegger said, to a question about the withdrawn invitation. “I want to reach out to Latinos, and not just because of the vote. It’s not all about votes. It’s like, you know, that I feel sad by this situation, that someone is trying to make me look like I am anti-Latino, when I’ve done four movies in Mexico. And every opportunity I get, when there is a unique kind of location or something, I say to the production people, ‘This is where we have to shoot—in Mexico.’ Like ‘Collateral Damage,’ ‘Conan the Destroyer,’ ‘Total Recall,’ ‘Predator’—all those movies were down there, because it’s a great place to shoot. Great workmanship down there. So it’s the wrong way of painting me, and it’s also wrong to say that because I want to reach out to the leaders and help them, especially those that come over here and English is their second language. That’s why I’m doing these after-school programs to build them up, so it’s kind of sad—not only because of the vote but just in general because that’s not me.”\n\nSchwarzenegger had had one good break that day: Davis had been stupid enough to joke to a supporter, in the presence of a reporter for the Sacramento Bee, that anyone who can’t pronounce California shouldn’t be Governor of it. Schwarzenegger waited patiently to be asked about this, and then he unleashed his sound bite for the evening news: “He doesn’t like the way I say the word ‘California’ because I say ‘Cal_ee_fornia’ rather than ‘Cal_uh_fornia.’ But there’s plenty of other words that he doesn’t like. He doesn’t like ‘lost jobs.’ He doesn’t like that word. He doesn’t like ‘blackouts.’ He doesn’t like ‘energy crisis.’ And he definitely doesn’t like ‘recall.’ ” (As was widely noted the next day, Schwarzenegger’s pronunciation is actually closer to the original Spanish than is Davis’s. Davis eventually issued an apology, though only after the state Senate voted, 19-2, to demand one.)\n\nPerhaps as a reminder that the occasion was a softball tournament, someone asked, “You go into politics, even though you’re a millionaire—why do you need all this?”\n\n“I feel in my gut that I want to make a difference,” Schwarzenegger said, with something like relief. “I feel I could not just continue worrying what will happen to my career, all my millions of dollars, that kind of thing, this beautiful life. There’s a time when you say, ‘Everything I’ve got—my whole career, everything—is because of California.’ I came here to the Mecca of bodybuilding, and I became a bodybuilding champion. I was here at the Mecca of entertainment, you know, even though everyone said, ‘With your accent and with your body and with this name, Schwarzenschnitzel or whatever it is, you know, you will never make it in the movie business.’ I became the highest entertainer—the highest-paid actor, period. And, also, I think that the businesses that I have created here, even my family, my four wonderful children and my wife—all here in California. So everything that I’ve got in life is from California, and therefore it is time to give back.”\n\n“Gotta go!” an aide shouted, but one last questioner persisted. “How do you equate your situation coming here with immigrants who are suffering trying to get here?”\n\n“When I came here, I made sixty dollars a week,” Schwarzenegger replied. “Sixty dollars a week—and I was going out and doing bricklaying jobs. So I grew up with my hands. I struggled. Many times I struggled. ‘Where’s my next food coming from? How can I afford the food supplements that I need to be a bodybuilding champion?’ Because, remember, bodybuilding was nowhere to be found as a sport then. It wasn’t even an officially recognized sport until 1971. So I started on the bottom and slowly worked my way up—with working, with saving money, with going out to strongman exhibitions and all that stuff, and posing exhibitions, doing seminars, and going to school, educating myself. I wasn’t even allowed to go to school full time. I took two classes here, two classes there, because I still had a visitor’s visa, and then I was applying for a working permit. When you apply for a working permit, you’re not allowed to have a student visa, and all these complications. I went through the entire thing that everyone else goes through—except I didn’t have anyone there lobbying for me or for Austrians. I struggled, and that’s why I can relate to the pain and all the hard work, the struggles that they’re going through. There’s no one that can relate to it better than me, because I have come through it.”\n\nThe Rosetta stone of Schwarzeneggerology is generally considered to be a collection of films and books produced by George Butler, usually in collaboration with the writer Charles Gaines: the 1974 book “Pumping Iron: The Art and Sport of Bodybuilding”; the groundbreaking documentary film that followed, in 1977; and two retrospective productions, the book “Arnold Schwarzenegger: A Portrait” (1990) and the twenty-fifth-anniversary film “Iron and Beyond/Raw Iron,” put together by the Cinemax cable network last year and containing outtakes from the original “Pumping Iron” film and documentary footage shot in the aftermath of its release. The collection focusses on a crucial period in Schwarzenegger’s young manhood: his rise from relative obscurity as a freak-show muscleman to the cusp of global fame, via the film itself and the brilliant promotional campaign that preceded and followed it, which included a wildly successful 1976 bodybuilding show at the Whitney Museum (“Articulate Muscle: The Body as Art”) and a deliberate, and also successful, effort to make Arnold briefly the toast of New York café society. “Pumping Iron,” released when Arnold was twenty-nine, is the first film whose credits carry the words “Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.” (In 1970, when he was twenty-three, he had had the title role in the legendarily ghastly “Hercules Goes Bananas”—but as “Arnold Strong,” a one-off name apparently adopted for comic contrast with that of his co-star, Arnold Stang, an actor well known at the time for playing four-eyed, squeaky-voiced pencil-necks.)\n\nAs “Pumping Iron” suggests, the resemblances between Schwarzenegger’s experience as an immigrant and the experience of a typical Mexican farmworker are approximate at best. When Schwarzenegger came to the United States, in 1968, his struggle was not very desperate. He was brought here by a muscle-magazine publisher. He had already won the titles of Junior Mr. Europe, Mr. Europe, Best Built Man in Europe, Mr. Universe (amateur), and Mr. Universe (professional). He did not require the services of an Austrian equivalent of La Raza or lulac in order to survive. He may not have always known where his next food was coming from, but he knew it was coming.\n\nIn the “Pumping Iron” series, which chronicles events leading up to and including the Mr. Olympia contest of 1975, there are intimations that Schwarzenegger’s ultimate goal, absurd as it would have seemed at the time, was power. “I was always dreaming about very powerful people—dictators and things like that,” he soliloquizes at one point in the original film. “I was just always impressed by people who could be remembered for hundreds of years or even, like Jesus, being for thousands of years remembered.” In “Raw Iron,” he recounts another dream: “Me being a king and standing on top of a mountain—and there was no room left for anybody else up there, O.K.? Just for me.” Later, a fellow-bodybuilder teases, “Arnold, when are you running for President?” He shoots back, “When Nixon gets impeached.” And in “A Portrait” Butler recounts a conversation he had in a taxi with the actress Candice Bergen a few months after the Whitney show. Bergen is insisting that bodybuilding, and Arnold, has peaked. “I disagree,” Butler replies. “It’s here to stay, and Arnold is going to be the Governor of California one day.” (Bergen, hooting with laughter, retorts, “And one day Ronald Reagan will be President.”)\n\nWhat comes through above all, however, is a sense of Schwarzenegger’s indomitable will. That will is manifested not only in his spooky ability to sculpt his own body and in his outlandish (at the time) vision of himself as a man of destiny but also in his total, and apparently effortless, psychological domination of his fellow-musclemen—the way he intimidates and tames them with his charm, his confidence, his humor, and his obviously superior intelligence. And this domination is not simply instinctual. It is strategic. Everything Arnold does to advance himself (which is to say, everything Arnold does) is carefully thought through by an analytical mind that always looks many steps ahead and is acute and coldly realistic about the strengths and weaknesses of everybody in the game, himself included. Megalomania usually leads to hubris, but not in Arnold’s case. Not so far.\n\nEven the fact that, “Arnold Strong” notwithstanding, he retained his name is a marker of his powerful will. By doing it his way, he made it thinkable for others with “funny” names to do it theirs: no Arnold Schwarzenegger, no Renée Zellweger. More important, Schwarzenegger has changed the way people look—in both senses. When “Pumping Iron” first came out, Schwarzenegger and his bodybuilder friends appeared not so much strong and healthy as grotesque and misshapen. Twenty-six years later, bodies like theirs no longer seem in the least monstrous, merely exaggerated. Schwarzenegger opened up our ideal image of the male body in his direction, as surely as the Beatles and their rock-and-roll colleagues opened up our ideas about the permissible range of men’s hair styles. Today, a pre-Arnold toga-and-sandals movie star like Victor Mature looks to our Arnold-conditioned eyes like someone in need of a workout. Free weights and weight machines are now part of the exercise regimen of tens of millions of people. People have become more relaxed and less fraught about the male body. Ideas of male beauty have broadened. There is room for the Charles Atlases, and also for the ninety-eight-pound weaklings. This is a kind of liberation, and it is partly Arnold’s doing."
