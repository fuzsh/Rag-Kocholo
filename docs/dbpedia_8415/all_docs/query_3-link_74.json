        "text": "A parolee sought for questioning in connection with a high-profile Salinas gang homicide has been found and detained.\n\nJoseph Cruz Bustamante, 26, was apprehended about 6p.m. Friday by members of the Monterey County Joint Gang Task Force in a SWAT-like operation.\n\nThough police have not released information about Bustamante”s arrest, Monterey County Jail booking records show he is being held in custody on a parole violation.\n\nSalinas police had been seeking Bustamante since July27, after Roy Simon Ramirez III, 28, was killed during a shooting in the 500 block of San Benito Street.\n\nBustamante was wanted prior to the shooting for allegedly violating his parole.\n\nAt the time, police said Bustamante was with Ramirez when both were attacked in what gang investigators describe as a targeted “hit” by Norteño gang members. A common-law brother-in-law of Ramirez was shot and killed the next day, the two attacks kicking off an 11-day spree of gang killings that increased the city”s annual homicide count by one-third.\n\nBustamante was officially sought as a witness in the Ramirez shooting. Officers released his photo to media outlets, saying his life was likely in danger because he was reportedly shot through the torso with a .40 caliber bullet during the attack.\n\nIt was unclear whether Bustamante had been treated for his wounds before his arrest Friday.\n\n“It would be nice if he told us. We don”t know the degree of the wound. He”s not going to tell us how he survived the shooting,” Cmdr. Bob Eggers said. Bustamante was a “person of interest” in the Ramirez homicide, Eggers said.\n\nHospitals and doctors are required to report treating shooting victims to police."
