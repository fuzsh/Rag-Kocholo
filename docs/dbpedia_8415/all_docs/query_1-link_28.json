        "text": "In their first meeting since the Oct. 7 recall election, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Gray Davis said they have started a “great relationship” and would work closely before Schwarzenegger becomes governor next month.\n\nTHE REPUBLICAN actor said there were no hard feelings between the two men over the election that ousted Davis.\n\n“He kept his promise,” Schwarzenegger said. “Every day we are working with his office, and they have been really fantastic to work with.”\n\nThe two met for 90 minutes and reviewed timetables for the new governor, including a budget proposal due in January.\n\nDavis said he told Schwarzenegger to “enjoy every moment. This is the best job you’ll ever have. Even on the bad days, enjoy it.”\n\nDavis said it was “not fun” to lose the recall election, but promised to “do my very best to help Gov.-elect Schwarzenegger be a success, because I love this state.”\n\nHe said that once he leaves office, he will try to champion some of the causes he supported in Sacramento, though he did not elaborate.\n\nSchwarzenegger also met with each of the statewide office holders — including recall opponent Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi and Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O’Connell.\n\nSchwarzenegger has said he plans to call a special legislative session to deal with workers’ compensation reform and repeal legislation recently signed by Davis to grant driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants.\n\nGaramendi said he suggested Schwarzenegger try to cut costs in California’s workers’ compensation system, but cautioned the incoming governor not to push for quick action from lawmakers on such a complex issue.\n\nO’Connell said Schwarzenegger committed to keeping the state education budget for 6.1 million public school children “as whole as possible.”\n\nNo date has been announced for Schwarzenegger to be sworn in, but he is expected to take office shortly after Nov. 15, the last day for the secretary of state to certify results of the recall election.\n\n© 2003 Associated Press.
