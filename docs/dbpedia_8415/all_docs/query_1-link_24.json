        "text": "Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger has been elected as governor of California, with the state's voters banishing the Democratic incumbent, Gray Davis, only 11 months into his second term of office.\n\nRepublican Mr Schwarzenegger, who has never previously run for political office, told cheering supporters that he would repay their faith in him after ousting Mr Davis.\n\n\"I will not fail you, I will not disappoint you, and I will not let you down,\" he said following the declaration of the result.\n\nHe made his victory speech in the same Los Angeles ballroom in which Ronald Reagan, who also served as governor of California, learned that he had become the US president in 1980.\n\nMr Davis became the first California governor to be removed from office in mid-term, and only the second in the nation's history to be recalled.\n\nWith more than half the votes counted, Mr Schwarzenegger had secured almost 50%. Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante was his closest rival, with a little more than 30%.\n\nThe film star pledged to be \"the governor of the people\", saying: \"I know that, together, we can make this the greatest state in the greatest country in the world. For people to win, politics, as usual, must lose.\n\n\"We have tough choices ahead. Shall we rebuild our state together, or shall we fight among ourselves? I will reach out to Republicans and Democrats and independents: to those who supported the recall, and to those who did not.\"\n\nRepublican activists sparked the recall vote amid growing concern over California's $8bn (Â£4.8bn) budget deficit, growing unemployment figures and struggling education system.\n\nIn conceding defeat, Mr Davis said that he \"accepted the voters' judgement\", adding: \"I'm calling on everyone to put the chaos and division of the recall behind us and do what's right for this great state of California.\n\n\"I told my mother and my wife before we came out here that this is a no-crying zone on this stage. We can cry later tonight.\"\n\nVoters at the polls faced two questions: whether they wanted to recall Mr Davis, and who they favoured among the candidates to replace him if he was removed.\n\nAustrian-born Mr Schwarzenegger, star of the Terminator films, told voters: \"Everything I have is because of California. I came here with absolutely nothing, and California has given me absolutely everything.\n\n\"And today California has given me the greatest gift of all: you have given me your trust by voting for me.\"\n\nMr Schwarzenegger, who is married to television journalist Maria Shriver, the niece of Senator Edward M Kennedy, will take office as soon as the results are certified, which will be no later than November 15.\n\nExit polls had shown that seven in 10 voters disapproved of how Mr Davis was doing his job, with the same number backing Mr Schwarzenegger to be his replacement.\n\nElection officials reported long queues and a shortage of parking spaces near polling stations as California's voters turned out in large numbers.\n\nIn the build-up to the election, Mr Schwarzenegger had faced allegations that he had sexually harassed women.\n\nThe Los Angeles times last week reported that at least six women had made allegations against him. He faced further pre-election scrutiny over claims that he had once praised Adolf Hitler.\n\nDespite high-profile backing for Mr Davis from senior Democrats including Bill Clinton and Al Gore, Mr Schwarzenegger secured a victory which has created headlines around the world.\n\nThe French interior minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, said: \"Someone who is a foreigner in his country, who has an unpronounceable name and can become governor of the biggest American state - that's not nothing.\"\n\nIn Styria, Mr Schwarzenegger's Austrian home province, governor Waltraud Klasnic said: \"He's one of us. Many people in the world - and in America - now know where Styria is.\""
