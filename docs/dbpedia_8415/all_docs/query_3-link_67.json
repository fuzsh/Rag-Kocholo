        "text": "(2 of 2)\n\nBustamante is known for his opposition to Proposition 187, a ballot measure introduced under Republican Governor Pete Wilson in 1994 that would have denied public services to illegal immigrants. Though approved by voters, it was struck down by the courts. When Davis became Governor, he toyed with a way of adopting a watered-down version of the initiative, and Bustamante couldn't stop himself from criticizing his boss publicly. The fallout? Bustamante's parking spaces outside the Governor's office were taken away.\n\nToday Bustamante dismisses the 1999 spat over parking spots as a \"petty thing.\" But he cannot hide the enmity between himself and Davis, who tried hard to keep any other Democrat from entering the race. \"I looked at the numbers, and it didn't look favorable for the Governor,\" Bustamante says. The recall \"is a wake-up call--it will put all [the candidates] back on the table and see what they have to say.\"\n\nWhat Bustamante has to say is politically simple. The threefold increase in the vehicle-license fee that Davis introduced should be repealed, he says--a smart move in an auto-reliant state, and one that will be hard for any other candidate to oppose.\n\nTo win, however, Bustamante needs the right kind of voters to turn out for him, especially the 32% of Californians who are Latino. Latinos are generally underrepresented at the polls. In last November's gubernatorial election, just 12% of voters were Latino. As the only major Latino candidate, Bustamante has a head start, but he is not guaranteed the loyalty of such voters. His origins in the conservative Central Valley place him to the right of many Latino Democrats. Apart from his opposition to Prop 187, \"he has not been a strong champion of Latino issues,\" says Luis Arteaga, executive director of the nonpartisan Latino Issues Forum in San Francisco.\n\nBustamante can't count on black voters either. Some will remember a speech in 2001 in which the candidate read out a list of black trade unions and accidentally used the word nigger instead of Negro in one of the names--he apologized profusely afterward. But the damage was done. Labor leaders, meanwhile, traditionally big donors to Democratic candidates, have so far held back their support; they resent Bustamante's fund-raising links with Indian casinos, which are typically nonunionized. Concedes Richard Ross, Bustamante's campaign manager: \"We are scrambling\" to raise money.\n\nThat could change now that the polls show Bustamante ahead. Several labor organizations have scheduled meetings over the next two weeks to reconsider their election strategy. \"People know it is a serious time,\" says Bustamante. Very serious indeed for the man who wants to win back his parking spaces in front of the Governor's office.\n\n--With reporting by Sean Scully/Los Angeles and Karen Tumulty/Washington"
