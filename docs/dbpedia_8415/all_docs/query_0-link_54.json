        "text": "An NBC poll published on Sunday gave the former bodybuilder 37% of the vote, compared to 29% for California’s Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante.\n\nCalifornia is the world’s sixth largest in economy, ahead of China – excluding Hong Kong.\n\nAbout 16% of respondents remain undecided two days before the recall vote scheduled for Tuesday, according to the survey of 1000 registered voters.\n\nSchwarzenegger’s support appeared to be holding, despite 11th hour allegations that he once expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler.\n\nFresh allegations\n\nThe actor also tried to parry fresh accusations that he groped and harassed women. The Los Angeles Times on Sunday reported the muscleman had touched four women in a sexual manner without their consent, bringing the total number of such revelations to 15.\n\nSchwarzenegger, a Republican, launched his own attack on incumbent Governor Gray Davis, accusing him of waging “puke politics”.\n\n“Many of those things are not true. Like, for instance, I despise anything and everything that Hitler stands for” Schwarzenegger said in a TV interview.\n\nAlso on Sunday, California Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein appeared in a TV commercial, describing the recall as unfair and questioning whether Schwarzenegger was fit to govern.\n\nClinton on side\n\nThe party has also enlisted former President Bill Clinton, former Vice President Al Gore, actor Martin Sheen and musical diva Barbara Streisand to tape phone messages for a massive anti-recall vote campaign aimed at wayward Democrats.\n\nThe allegations against Schwarzenegger “raise serious questions about whether he can govern California”, Davis told supporters on Sunday, Reuters reported.\n\nDuring Schwarzenegger’s four-day bus trip around the state, he was met by foes carrying signs reading “Arnold release the Hitler tapes,” a reference to out takes from the movie Pumping Iron in which he apparently expressed admiration for Hitler, and “Arnold, are your daughters pieces of meat?”"
