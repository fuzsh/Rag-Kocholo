        "text": "Political life is a roller coaster. One day you’re down, the next you’re picked to be lieutenant governor. Such is the world of Abel Maldonado.\n\nFortunately, the Central Coast farmer, whose state Senate district stretches from southeastern Santa Clara County to northern Santa Barbara County, comes from resilient stock. His appointment by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is likely to face rough going in the Legislature, but when the posturing is over, we hope he wins the two-thirds votes needed in each house for confirmation.\n\nMaldonado is a good choice. And it’s nice to see his bipartisanship in last winter’s budget debate rewarded, after his own Republican Party clobbered him for it.\n\nMaldonado crossed party lines to join in a budget compromise last February, finally agreeing to tax increases in return for some provisions he felt strongly about. He joined Mike Villines, then the Assembly Republican leader, and David Cogdill, the Senate’s GOP leader, in supporting the deal that Schwarzenegger had brokered with Democrats.\n\nAll were promptly vilified by their party, with Villines and Cogdill dumped from their leadership posts. It was a dark hour for the California Republican Party. The three had shown courage that should have been respected. It’s not surprising that Cogdill also was on the governor’s short list for lieutenant.\n\nMaldonado often has been a crossover vote. He leans right more than left but always has shown an independent streak – having a soft spot for animal rights, for example. His approach to politics is a throwback to earlier times, when compromise was part of effective governing, before dysfunction and paralysis gripped Sacramento.\n\nIndependence is no surprise, given his roots. His parents were farm workers from Mexico who eventually bought land and have played out the traditional immigrant success story in America, rising from poverty to prosperity through hard work. Though not so many end up seeing their son nominated to be lieutenant governor.\n\nSome Democrats on Tuesday spoke well of Maldonado but signaled they’d resist confirming him, citing the $2 million cost of a special election to fill his Senate seat. However, Schwarzenegger’s staff believes the election can be held with the June primary, minimizing any extra cost. The legal argument seems credible.\n\nWith that excuse off the table, rejecting Maldonado will be difficult. Democrats tired of gridlock in the Legislature should be applauding the advance of a Republican willing to compromise – something they do all the time.\n\nOne of the things Maldonado held out for in last February’s budget debate was a ballot initiative to allow for open primaries, a promising idea that’s seen as a way to help moderates’ chances in California elections. Today, primary voters tend toward the extreme of their parties, rejecting less partisan candidates who might have a better chance in the general election – and who might revive a culture of compromise in state government.\n\nThe governor’s choice of Maldonado represents progress for Californians who seek more moderate, independent-minded voices in leadership roles."
