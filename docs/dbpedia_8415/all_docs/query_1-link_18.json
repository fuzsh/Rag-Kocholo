        "text": "It was a joke on talk radio.\n\nLt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante served as acting governor for one hour Tuesday as Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger underwent surgery to repair a leg he broke in a skiing accident.\n\nTalk show hosts laughed at the notion of the termed-out Bustamante, who recently failed in his bid for insurance commissioner, running the state.\n\nBustamante, however, often has led the state in Schwarzenegger’s stead. During the three years of the Schwarzenegger administration, Bustamante has served as acting governor for all or part of 198 days.\n\nThat works out to Bustamante running the state one day every 5.5 days, Bustamante spokesman Stephen Green said.\n\nWith the exception of Tuesday, Bustamante has been in charge because Schwarzenegger was out of the state.\n\nIn December 2003, for example, Bustamante had to call a state of emergency after an earthquake when Schwarzenegger was out of California on a skiing trip, Green said.\n\n“The ‘action, action governor’ was out of action,” Green said, noting Schwarzenegger had just been elected governor in the recall election. One of Schwarzenegger’s main opponents in the 2003 recall, Bustamante, a Democrat and an ally of former Gov. Gray Davis’, often has been at odds with the Republican governor.\n\nDuring the five years of the Davis administration, Bustamante served as acting governor for all or part of 113 days.\n\nJulie Soderland, the governor’s spokeswoman, said Schwarzenegger has traveled out of state to promote California.\n\n“When he was elected, he promised he would travel the world to promote California,” she said, adding that the governor expects to do the same in his second term."
