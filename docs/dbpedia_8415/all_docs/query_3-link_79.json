        "text": "California Insurance Commissioner Candidate Cruz Bustamante, currently the Lieutenant Governor, will be speaking at the Latin American Agents Association (LAAA) meeting, slated for Thursday, April 6th at 7 p.m. Bustamante plans to outline his campaign platform, his perspective on the state of the insurance industry today and in the future.\n\n“We welcome this opportunity to hear what Lt. Governor Bustamante has to say about the condition of our industry, the business climate in California and what changes and improvements a Bustamante-led Department of Insurance would bring about for California’s insurance producers and carriers,” said LAAA CEO Andre Urena. “The top priority for the LAAA is providing our members with information that will have a direct impact on their businesses, and there is little doubt that the incoming Insurance Commissioner is in a position to do just that. Everyone is invited to come down and hear what a top contender for the post has to say.”\n\nThis event is the first of a series of meetings planned to help LAAA members and others to make an informed decision on whom to support for the political race for California’s Insurance Commissioner.\n\nThe meeting will be held at Steven’s Steakhouse, 5332 Stevens Place in Commerce, California. The cost for the meeting, including dinner, is $35 for non-members and company representatives. Cost for LAAA members is $30. To register, call the LAAA office at (626) 444-0999 or visit the LAAA website at www.latinagents.com."
