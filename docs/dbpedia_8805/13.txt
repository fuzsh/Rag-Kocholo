The 20 mark coin was a gold coin issued by the states of the German Empire from 1871 to 1915.

The coin was composed of .900 fine gold, weighed 7.965 grams, and measured 22.5 millimeters in diameter. All of the coins featured the Reichsadler of the German Empire on the reverse, accompanied by the state title of the Second Reich (DEUTSCHES REICH), the coin's value, and the year. Between 1871 and 1890, the Reichsadler featured was rather small and bore a large shield on its breast, but from 1891 on, the heraldic eagle was a bit larger and held a smaller shield. The obverse typically featured an effigy of the leader of the state that issued the coin. For example, a coin from the Kingdom of Prussia from 1907 would display an effigy of then-current King of Prussia, William II. Other times, the coat of arms of the state that issued the coin would be engraved on the obverse, as seen on the Bremen and Hamburg 20 mark coins.
