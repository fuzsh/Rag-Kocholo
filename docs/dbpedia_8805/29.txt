Saxon thaler

The Thaler was the currency of the Electorate and Kingdom of Saxony until 1857. Between 1754 and 1841, it was equal to three quarters of a Conventionsthaler and was subdivided into 24 Groschen, each of 12 Pfennig. In 1841, Saxony partially decimalized, dividing the Thaler (now equal to the Prussian Thaler) into 30 Neugroschen, each of 10 Pfennig. The Thaler was replaced by the Vereinsthaler at par.

The duchies of Saxe-Altenburg and Saxe-Coburg-Gotha also issued coinage according to the Saxon system, from 1841 and 1837, respectively.

Saxon vereinsthaler

The Vereinsthaler was the currency of Saxony between 1857 and 1873. It replaced the Thaler at par and was replaced by the Mark at a rate of 1 Vereinsthaler = 3 Mark. The Vereinsthaler was subdivided into 30 Neugroschen, each of 10 Pfennig.
