        "text": "Saxony is not Poland.\n\nI admire your ability to change your opinion. When I first time mention the forgery of Frederick the Great, your reaction was predictable-It was \"Polish propaganda\" for you. When you find out that it really happened, the explanation was \"Frederick action was fully justified because he needed money to wage his wars\" or samething like this .Very ethical explanation, I must say. Now it is another explanation, Saxony was at war with Prussia so Frederick was justified to forge Polish currency.\n\nForgery is a forgery and it is no ethical explanation for this. Quoting similar incident in history (rather rare occurence) is like justfying criminal act by saying that such criminal act happen samewhere before.\n\nEdward:\"Poland officially remained neutral, but it was a neutrality favoring the anti-Prussian coalition. Russian troops crossed the kingdom many times to attack Prussia, and Friedrich of Prussia retaliated in a very modern way.....Within a few years Poland's economy had been thoroughly wrecked.\"\n\nBeorna:\"This has nothing to do with retaliation. The Ephraimites were made to pay the costs of the war. This was an all-european phenomenon, not a special prussian one. .........The minting of wrong coins was succesful from 1756 to 1758, after that time nearly everybody knew about the minor value. So it seems to be a Polish myth, that it was Fredric's revange. \"\n\nSo it is a lie, that i did not knew and called it Polish propaganda. As everybody can see, did i call your information about a retaliation as myth.\n\nEdward:\"Could anybody give us another sample of country which the \"head of state\" organised massive monetary forgery and use it against another country?And please note: Poland was not at war with Prussia at that time.\n\nHitler and his cronies used mass counterfeit British pounds during WWII. Not surprised. Frederick \"the Great\" was a Hitler idol. \"\n\nBeorna:\"it was not used against Poland. Show me an order, where fredric said, ruin the neighbour country Poland. He did this to pay his army, in an war against France, Austria and Russia and the Reich. Such things happened already during the Tpper and See-Saw.Time during the 30y-war. There was another period before the end of 17th century. \"\n\nEdward:\"So forging foreign money is \"wrong Mint\" according to you. I admire your ability to twist historical facts.\"\n\nBeorna:\"of course it was by recent standards illegal, but a common practice. But as i mentioned, not only Saxon and Polish coins were reduced in value, even Prussian coins itself. \"\n\nI gave you in november 2010 the answer, that it was done by fredric, because he needed money. that is a fact. I did neither support it, nor justify or excuse it, I explained it. Something you are permanently unable to understand or willingly ignore. So the words you are laying in my mouth, that \"Frederick action was fully justified because he needed money to wage his wars\" is again a lie.\n\nI tried to show you the ethical standard of those days were different to our. i seems without success.\n\nYour saying \"Quoting similar incident in history (rather rare occurence) is like justfying criminal act by saying that such criminal act happen samewhere before.\" is again insulting and again a further personal attack against me.\n\nYou wrongly called me a liar, a forger, a Wehrmacht apologist, you put me in a right corner with skinheads, called me a lover boy and much more. I am really asking myself, whether this is a new policy here on the forum. Are some allowed to insult as much as they like?\n\nThe ethic of Enlightenment is no different that ethic of 21st century. What is not ethical today was not ethical 200 years ago. The true is that any absolute ruler was &#8220;unethical&#8221; by definition and by default Frederick was &#8220;unethical&#8221;. He was not a great personality of Enlightenment, in many cases he was in sharp contradiction to the Enlightenment values.\n\n&#8220; In his Critique of Practical Reason and other treatises Kant applied the idea of the inherently active and productive nature of the mind to the analysis of ethics. He argued for a position according to which valid ethical rules and standards cannot come from outside a person, but have to originate from a person's own active reason. A truly moral person, according to him, cannot passively accept the customs and values of any society, the rules and decrees of any established authority, or even the deeply felt impulses of his or her own non-rational intuitions or spontaneous reactions. Such passive acceptance of directives from outside one&#8217;s own reason would be a sign of immaturity and moral irresponsibility. A moral person has to determine rationally and for himself or herself what is right and wrong; an adult moral person has to be \"autonomous.\" Autonomy is the ability to live by one's own laws. It is the importance that Kant attributes to personal autonomy--to individual self-determination--that makes him a typical and leading Enlightenment thinker, and that finds expression in his definition of enlightenment as &#8220;the release from self-incurred tutelage.&#8221;\n\nI think that in post 14 Linschoten got it right; &#8220;\"He was a strange man, full of contradictions.&#8221;\n\nThe ethic of Enlightenment is no different that ethic of 21st century.

My point remains the same though: so... w-h-a-t? So you can 'not' find him great that doesn't take away the historical reason why he 'was' called the great.\n\nGV ,my argument is that he forged many to finance his war and ethical value of his conduct, not if he is Great or not so great.\n\nBy the way, your argument is based on incorrect historical facts.\n\nYour statement; Poland and Saxony lost, Prussia won. Is incorrect\n\nPoland was not in war with Prussia at that time, Saxony was. Poland and Saxony was at personal union but the Saxon Elector (and polish king) could not declare war without Polish Parliament consent. There was no such contest and Polish Army did not take part in hostilities. Poland was neutral, did trade with Prussia which will starve without supply of Polish produces. From the other hand, Russian army passed through Lithuania (Thus part of Polish-Lithuanian Com.) territory without consent of Poland.\n\nIf forgery of neutral country currency was so \"normal\" at that time, there will be no monetary system in Europe and whole economy will collapse. Such forgery was always a wicked act of aggression and was always condemned as a brutal and unethical act. If you think otherwise that is OK with me, you have the right to have your own opinion.\n\nSorry, I have to go to work. See you on another thread.."
