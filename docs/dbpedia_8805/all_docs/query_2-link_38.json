In publishing the third edition of the present book, which first appeared in 1905, the author has tried to comply with the general wish to avoid as much as possible the mere reproduction of the text of the ten lectures on which the early editions were originally based. Instead of this, the present edition marks the partial realization of the idea of the larger work which the author has constantly had in mind from the very beginning. The author has tried to fulfil the expectation and wishes of the critics (whose suggestions are always welcome) to the best of his ability and so far as the time at his disposal permitted. The present edition has been completely reshaped and considerably enlarged—as indicated in the title of the book—although the fundamental features of the work and the particular treatment of the concentration movement have been retained. For this purpose it became necessary in the first place to enlarge on the description of German economic development from 1848 to 1870, and from 1870 up to the present day, in so far as this development exercised a determining influence on the growth of German banking. In the second place an attempt has been made, as far as existing material permitted, to present in nearly every chapter the separate development of each great bank, without, however, obscuring the picture of the general development. XI National M onetary Commission I n a separate chapter a comprehensive view is given of t h e general management and development of t h e six great Berlin banks. Accordingly it also became necessary t o present a systematic description of t h e most important debit and credit transactions of t h e banks. This permitted t h e generally desired and fully justified examination of t h e question whether a n d to what extent t h e German great banks have actually fulfilled in t h e interests of t h e community t h e important and numerous tasks set forth in t h e introductory chapter. I n discussing t h e credit and debit business of t h e banks it became possible also to devote some space to t h e treatm e n t of questions of technical methods and business policy, which h a d been entirely kept out from t h e earlier editions. I t will be found t h a t t h e chapter (VIII) devoted t o t h e analysis and criticism of the reform proposals in t h e field of b a n k deposits, which were discussed quite fully even in t h e first edition, has been greatly enlarged, for t h e reason t h a t these proposals m a y be said to occupy at present t h e center of German banking discussion. A further reason was t h a t in t h e meantime t h e views of t h e various experts have been published, as presented before t h e Bank Inquiry Commission, of which t h e a u t h o r was a member. An analysis and appreciation of these views seemed therefore pertinent. Another subject which had to be passed over lightly in t h e former editions—though against t h e wishes of t h e author—viz, industrial concentration a n d t h e influence which t h e concentration of banking exercises on it, has now been treated in greater detail. However, for lack of XII P r e fa c e space this chapter even now is limited to a study of this movement in a few typical and specially important branches of industry. Suggestions as to form have also been adopted as far as possible. Much discursive matter, hitherto contained in t h e notes, has been incorporated in t h e text. On t h e other h a n d large statistical tables, which formerly were p a r t of t h e text, and t h u s broke u p t h e continuity of presentation, have been removed t o t h e end of t h e book in t h e form of appendices. A series of what I consider very important statistical appendices has been substituted for those printed in the earlier editions. For t h e preparation a n d checking of these tables I desire to express m y best t h a n k s to Dr. Berthold Breslauer, of Berlin, t h e editor of t h e statistical p a r t of t h e Bank Archiv. The tables showing t h e amount of listed securities issued b y t h e six great Berlin b a n k s — constituting Appendices V and VI—for t h e first time provide complete material based on official d a t a concerning this important subject. Appendix V I I I — t r e a t i n g of t h e course of t h e concentration movement in t h e case of t h e eight greatest Berlin banks—has been brought down to December 31, 1908. I t is hoped t h a t the book in its new shape will meet with t h e same friendly reception which has been accorded t o its earlier editions and t h a t it will be found a reliable reference work, equally free from fulsome commendation a n d from undue depreciation of t h e work of t h e German credit banks. R O M E , April, igog. xnr TRANSLATOR'S N O T E . Prof. Riesser's work, Die deutschen Grossbanken und ihre Konzentration, of which the present volume is a translation, gives the most recent and fullest account of the development, present organization, and practices of the more important German so-called credit banks, particularly the six largest banks, which, with the possible exception of one, may be said to have their central office in Berlin. The name credit bank, which has been retained in the translation, in no way characterizes the actual scope of activity of these banks, but is the term used in recent German banking literature to differentiate the commercial joint-stock and kindred banks without the note-issue privilege from other banks having a more restricted and special field of operations, such as the mortgage banks, the mutual or cooperative banks, the savings banks, etc. The book abounds in technical legal and banking terminology, for which no exact equivalents in English exist. In numerous cases no translation was attempted. In other cases where the terms occur frequently throughout the volume, a choice of an English equivalent, though more or less arbitrary, had to be made. This applies particularly to the term Depositen, the definition of which the author declares to be impracticable. (See p. 196 et seq.) In German bank statements different meanings are attached to the term by various institutions, the only common feature being that interest is allowed on these \"deposits.\" xy Translator's Note An i m p o r t a n t function of t h e German credit banks is the financing of corporations and t h e selling to t h e public of the newly created securities of these corporations. Throughout t h e volume this latter practice has been designated as t h e issuing activity of t h e credit banks. The success of these operations depends largely upon t h e \"issue credit'' of t h e bank—i. e., t h e confidence of t h e investing public in t h e soundness of t h e securities offered by t h e bank. I n several cases a literal translation of German technical terms seemed entirely proper, though such terms as pure and mixed works (p. 175), mine furnaces, furnace mines (p. 369), heavy industry, and t h e like, even with proper explanations in the text, m a y be regarded b y some as literary barbarisms. The proofs of t h e translation have been submitted t o t h e author, who made several changes in t h e t e x t which do not appear in t h e German original. The figures bearing upon American banking have been revised and brought u p to date. Thankful acknowledgment is due t o Dr. Robert Stein, of Washington, D. C , and Dr. H . G. Friedman, of New York City, for valuable help rendered to t h e translator. M O R R I S JACOBSON. WASHINGTON, D. C , August, XVI 1911. THE GERMAN GREAT BANKS AND THEIR CONCENTRATION. PART I. INTRODUCTION—THE TASKS OF BANKS IN ECONOMIC LIFE. (i) GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. Walther Lotz, in his excellent book on the methods of floating securities {Die Technik des Emissiongeschafts, 1890), makes the following statement (p. 60): \"One of the most prominent financiers in Berlin once remarked to me that his profession was not affected by the social question, which was usually regarded as the most important factor in economic development, and that the speculative banks adopted a neutral attitude toward it.\" To my mind this statement proves that the Berlin financier in question has strangely misconceived the position and duties of German banking within the realm of \"capitalistic economics.\" 1 To prove this in detail is neither the least nor the most unimportant aim of the present work. Within the range of capitalistic economics there is a whole series of important and special economic tasks devolving on banks and bankers. To begin with, the funds are capital in the popular sense of the word (that is, sums of money constituting com903 n ° — 1 1 2 1 National Monetary Commission ponent parts of wealth to be devoted to producing income)2 which accumulate in the safes of banks and bankers. It is the bankers' profession and duty not only to take care of the capital, but to turn it to good account, i. e., to make it productive, particularly by placing it at the disposal of others for industrial and other purposes.3 Banks have to receive the funds placed at their disposal for the purpose of investment and profitable utilisation, and to direct them into proper channels through the granting of credit. The bank enters into relations on the one hand with the capitalist who entrusts to it his available money for productive investment and thus becomes its creditor, and on the other hand, with entrepreneurs and others who receive money for their ventures, and thus become its debtors. The part which a bank plays in its relations between capitalists and persons engaged in various enterprises is similar and as important as that of the trader who acts as independent middleman between producer and consumer, and who participates in the increase of values by transporting goods with or without intermediate manufacture from districts where supply is plentiful to districts where demand is great. The so-called regular or current banking business is confined to the acceptance and granting of such or similar credit (so-called credit and debit transactions). It includes deposits, current accounts, bill, contango, lombard, and commission business. The tasks involve, as far as is practicable within such limits, the direct furtherance of the power of production of 2 The German Great Banks all industries, including (after what has been said above) commerce,4 and indirectly the furtherance of the purchasing power of all classes of the community.5 They necessitate endeavors for the investment of surplus capital in a suitable and economic manner, and its utilisation for credit transactions. In the next place, banks and bankers have to provide for a sound and constant regulation of the circulation of money and the adjustment of money settlements in so far as these functions do not fall within the province of special public banks. They also have to provide for a banking organisation of the whole commercial system of payment, and above all for an increase of those forms of settlement which tend to take the place of cash: in particular the employment of checks, transfers {giro), and bank clearing.6 Finally, they have to establish organic relations between the systems of credit and payment, by using their credit to convert the claims of their customers in the shape of bills, checks, money orders, etc., into current paper, and thus into ready money, using this latter for the purpose of meeting payment on matured obligations.7 The historical development of German banking, however, has considerably enlarged the scope of these duties. The transformation effected since the middle of the nineteenth century in the whole system of communications through the use of steam for ships and railways (see p. 34), and the revolution in many industrial branches, caused by the appearance of the steam engine, in conjunction with the creation of a large and unified German economic territory through the customs union of the Ger3 National Monetary Commission man States (Zollverein, 1833), paved the way for the expansion and world-wide aspirations of German industry, and thus gave the impulse to large-scale production in many branches of industry. Thus it became necessary that capital as well as credit should be devoted to the building of plants and works in sums and for periods hitherto seldom required, if production on a large scale was to be maintained and extended. This could only be made possible by the issue of shares or debentures. The joint stock company proving the most reliable ally of trade and industry, conducted on a large scale, it became necessary to transform private concerns into joint stock companies and to establish new industrial enterprises in the shape of stock companies, whenever it was desired to increase the credit of existing private concerns, to enlarge or diversify production, or to enable domestic industry to enter into competition with foreign producers. The general public in Germany, whose funds were meager compared to those of England, was neither able nor willing at this juncture to participate directly or permanently in such ventures as mentioned above. The private individual fought shy of investing his capital in enterprises, and, content with smaller interest, bought government securities.8 Adequate assistance for the demands of capital and credit could not be expected from the existing note-issuing banks, 9 whose increase had long been advocated in the interest of increased facilities of payment, as the extent of their activity was naturally limited by their special functions. In the same manner private bankers, who at 4 The German Great Banks that time were very powerful, at least in several centers (see below, p. 39), could supply only modest means for such purposes—means which could neither suffice, nor be tied up for any length of time. In addition to this, the organisation of the banking business at that period was in general neither prepared for, nor adapted to operations of such a comprehensive and difficult nature (see below, P- 40). For these reasons such new and enormous demands could be met only by the creation of special organs, namely joint stock banks, which were called into existence to satisfy these very requirements. In the natural course of things the banks gradually became the professional and expert intermediaries in meeting the new financial wants. This they were able to do only through continuous and systematic study of the money market, as well as of the markets for the newly created securities, especially among their own customers. Moreover, both the continuity of their existence and regard for their own issue credit (Emissionskredit), i. e., the permanent ability of maintaining among the German public a market for new securities issued under their auspices, insured a permanent interest on the part of these banks in the newly created undertakings as well as in the securities which they were instrumental in placing on the market. It is, therefore, too narrow a view, and consequently incorrect, to assume that (10) \" the assistance of the numerous private bankers, equally conspicuous for intelligence and wealth, would have amply sufficed for all the tasks described above,\" and that the German credit banks grew up solely, or almost exclusively, because the general public 5 National Monetary Commission 'rushed madly after the most speculative of securities/ and because of the endeavours made to cater as far as possible to this speculative craze for railway, mining, and foundry shares.\" It must, however, be acknowledged that these reasons did play a certain part in the matter, especially the desire of the smaller capitalists to participate indirectly in the industries promoted by the new banks by the speculative acquisition of shares in these banks (\"speculating on speculation\"). It has been said concerning Saxony, that although the number of private banks was large for the time in question, yet \" their powers were inadequate to satisfy the credit requirements.\" 11 There is ample testimony to prove that this w§,s not solely a local symptom, and a mere glance at the security issues made during that first period leaves the same impression. Moreover it is stated that it was just among private bankers of that period that \"the necessity for concentration of capital was felt the most, and that a remedy was being looked for.\"12 We know that the committees which in almost all German States were petitioning for concessions (in Prussia long in vain, as is well known) for the establishment of note issuing and credit banks, were composed for the most part of private bankers.13 Schaffle u goes even further in the following statement published in a monograph about 1856: \"When industrial development has reached the stage at which great industries are forced to acquire their capital largely through the gathering of small capitals, special economic organisations must develop on which special functions regarding the initiative in stock transactions 6 The German Great Banks devolve. Banks for the promotion of such enterprises meet this need. \" As long as these premises for the economic justification of speculative banks have not been scientifically refuted scientists should not allow themselves to be terrified by the mere catchword 'credit mobilier', like children by a bogy.\" In this manner then, according to historical development, the stock issuing, promotion, and conversion business in Germany became a regular banking business, i. e., a branch of the regular business of credit banks, which at the same time carried on the so-called current business. On the other hand, in view of the relatively small amount of the available funds for bank investment proper, no attempts were made to establish special deposit banks, as under the circumstances but little profit could be expected from them. Even those persons who on principle are opposed to the whole capitalistic and industrial development as it manifested itself in Germany during the last decades, and who have no sympathy for this expansion of the regular business of the German banks, but rather deplore and find fault with it, will not be able to alter this course as long as the reasons exist which have led up to this development. I am convinced that these reasons will continue to exist for some time to come, owing to Germany's rapidly increasing population, her moderate wealth (at least in comparison to other countries), also because of her international position in trade and industry, a position attained with difficulty, but which it will be even harder to maintain permanently. 7 National Monetary Commission It will be seen by the description of the historical development of the sphere of activity of the German banks, that a proper and socially sound administration and organisation of the different departments of banking (especially of the last-mentioned branches), is one of the most important social problems. Moreover as there are as many social problems as there are spheres of social activity, and the various branches of banking are of the utmost importance in the economic life of the nation, the banking problem is closely interwoven with the majority of the other social problems, a fact which is in absolute contradiction with the statement of the eminent financier quoted by lyOtz. 2—SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS. (a) T H E TASKS OF BANKS DURING NORMAL T I M E S . The proposition last enunciated must be proved in detail by a discussion of the main directions of banking activity. It certainly does not lie within the power of the individual or the legislator, or even of the administration of the largest bank, to arrange matters in such a manner that only the best sides of the capitalistic system may prevail in economic life. It is, however, the most urgent and eminent duty of banks and bankers to endeavor, at least within the scope of their activity, and as far as is within their powers, to effect this as far as practicable, and to see that the profit and loss account of capitalistic economics is closed with a balance in favour of economic progress. Above all, they must promote all the economic interests of the nation, i.e., the interests of all producing classes 8 The German Great Banks without distinction, in so far as the services and the credit required by them come within the sphere of banking activity, and do not conflict with the necessary premises of sound banking policy. These latter conditions are determinative of the kind and extent of support which the so-called ''credit banks\" are in a position to grant to agriculture. In the next place they have to keep the amount of credit to be granted within reasonable bounds, and to offer, as far as is within their power, the utmost opposition to an unsound demand for credit. The banks must therefore endeavor to obtain at all times a comprehensive and accurate insight into the general conditions of the branches of industry and trade chiefly dependent on them for support, in order to be able to discriminate between necessary requirements and false hankerings after expansion and aggrandizement. They should also be able to intervene, or at least restrain and check, in cases where the form and extent of the credit received cause the fear of unsound development. Their duties toward the investment-seeking public are those of the honest broker, who, by reason of his experience and expert knowledge, is able to draw attention to the advantages and dangers of investments, and particularly to explain in a purely objective manner the dangers connected with securities yielding excessive interest or dividends. As regards acceptances, they ought to place their services at their customers' disposal only for economically sound purposes. They should keep the brokerage, the contango and deposit business within normal limits, and, 9 National Monetary Commission as far as it is possible to divine the purposes aimed at, to operate in such a manner that these transactions may not become a cloak for reckless and unsound speculation. In the issue business they should take particular care not to burden the market by an overproduction of securities or by the promotion of shaky ventures, for thereby they might not only cause heavy loss to the purchasers of such securities, but also inflict lasting and severe injury on their own issue credit. More especially they should transform only such undertakings into joint stock companies as are naturally suited to that particular form of commercial organisation. Before deciding to promote or transform such undertakings, they vshould make very cautious estimates regarding the possible profits of these undertakings. In addition to this, they should investigate the financial position of the whole branch of industry, or business concerned, and, as far as possible, form an opinion as to its future prospects and risks. Finally, they should pursue not only a sound dividend policy, but also a proper economic policy; resisting the temptation of momentary profits, they should abstain from business that does not appear economically sound, or might be detrimental to the business interests of the nation. The problems which the German banks have to solve during ordinary times have become, step by step, more comprehensive, more difficult, and more important. The number of these tasks and the sphere of activity of the German banks have grown with the increasing size, consolidation, and power of the country. The banks, particularly the \" great banks, \" were called upon to lend 10 The German Great Banks intelligent support to the Reichsbank (founded in 1875-76) in its currency and discount policies, and in its endeavors to introduce and promote \"giro,\" clearing, and check transactions, though this support was not always forthcoming to the full extent. Another task which fell to their lot—and of which they can neither be said to have acquitted themselves quite satisfactorily—was to support the land policy of the government and municipalities by means of the mortgage banks and real-estate companies which they had established against purely speculative and other undertakings which made no allowance for public interests. In countless ways, especially by an active participation in the organisation of state and municipal credit, they were called upon to make possible the accomplishment of important state and administrative tasks, as well as to promote the growth of German towns and the development of German ports, railroads, and highways. They were called upon to organise German inland navigation, as well as to provide for the development of the German railway system, and for the industrial utilisation of electric light and electric power. They had to assist by counsel and deed the business man crossing the seas as pioneer of German trade. It became their function to support the industrial export policy of the nation when it came to be considered in Germany an economic necessity, and to promote the economic development of the colonies, as well as of German cable communications by a series of undertakings not promising immediate returns. They had to strengthen our financial, and with it our political, influence abroad; nor was this done without many a bitter experience. For in this field they met the 11 National Monetary Commission competition of the majority of the great powers in the underwriting of foreign loans, the promoting of foreign undertakings, and the opening of international business relations, with the disadvantage that their rivals had entered the field long before them. By assisting German navigation, and establishing German banks abroad, they imparted to the German name a renown previously undreamed of, thus extending by their activity the sphere of German business and political influence. Finally, by a cautious financial policy, they prepared our financial readiness for war, a\\id for the carrying on of war. How and to what extent German banks acquitted themselves of all these tasks will be set forth in the following pages. Difficult and numerous as are the problems of external policy, those of internal policy are no easier. Success in the latter field became conditioned upon the recognition of two principles as the basis of all business activity. Furthermore these principles had to be observed under all vicissitudes, in the hurry of everyday life, in the pursuit of business, and in the finding of ways and means for the carrying out of new and urgent tasks as they continually crop up. These two principles are: The principle of the distribution of risks, on the one hand, and the principle of the liquidity of assets on the other. Nearly all the mistakes made in German banking, and the reproaches leveled against it, can be traced back to the violation, or misconception, of these fundamental principles underlying every sound banking policy. The principle of the distribution of risks must be observed in almost 12 The German Great Banks all branches of banking activity; not only in the granting of short or long credit, but also in the promotion, conversion, emission, and syndicate business. It implies, among other matters, that no single branch of current business shall be exclusively fostered in an excessive and unsound manner at the expense of others; that the entire amount of blank credit, granted after the most careful scrutiny, shall not bear an unsound proportion to the total of secured credit; further, that credit granted to a single undertaking, or branch of industry, shall not be too high; that in case of underwriting and share issues provision shall be made for a fitting distribution of participations; for there is always the possibility of a sudden change in political and economic conditions, as well as of changes in the market which may affect particular cases. It therefore becomes necessary to bear in mind constantly the need of the diminution of risk, even in the most promising ventures and during the most favored state of the market. The securing and maintaining of the liquidity of the assets is another most essential task incumbent on a banker. Indeed, in view of the variety of claims made on the resources of bankers and banks, and of the multiplicity of aims pursued by them, it is one of the most difficult problems of banking policy. It is all the more difficult, since the establishment of the right proportion of the so-called quick assets to the liabilities, especially to the obligations falling due at any time, or within a certain period, does not always depend solely on the will and discernment of the Bank. Possibilities have constantly to be reckoned with; for instance, that the issue of new 13 National Monetary Commission shares required to restore the necessary liquidity of the bank's resources after a great increase of business is impossible during bad or critical times; that consequently its assets would be tied up just at the very moment when it might be called upon to relieve general embarrassment by proper intervention. It is, therefore, a matter of necessity to constantly control the liquidity of the resources by frequent general inventories (Generaldispositionen)—as is done, for instance, with the greatest care, and at short intervals by the German \"great banks\"—in addition to the daily cash inventories (Kassendisposition) ,15 further, to increase the amount of the quick assets by a proper composition of the security and bill holdings; to strengthen both the visible and invisible reserves; and to regulate with the greatest vigilance the extent of the obligations, as well as their proportion to the liquid resources. It may well be sa: 1 that, on the whole, the German banks, or at least the greater part of them, and more especially the \"great banks\" have accomplished and are accomplishing a gooH deal in this respect. In this way the objections which are continually urged against the inclusion of the deposit business in our banks' spheres of activity are most effectively refuted, or reduced to narrow limits. For there can hardly be any question of 'danger\" when the deposits, and the other obligations due at short notice are balanced by more than ample security in the shape of the quickest assets, and if, in addition, special caution is exercised in the selection of the securities owned by the bank, as was the case with the Deutsche Bank, which on the last day of its fiscal year (December 31, 14 The German Great Banks 190S) held among its assets some 40,900,000 marks of securities, acceptable for investment in trust funds. W e shall have to go into this question later on in a more detailed manner. 1 6 (b) THE TASKS OF BANKS DURING CRITICAL TIMES. If t h e sphere of activity of t h e banks, of which naturally only t h e most important features have been barely outlined, is exceedingly extensive even during normal times, necessitating great discernment, caution, knowledge, and experience, it follows t h a t t h e extent and difficulty of such tasks becomes considerably augmented during and after those economic crises which all countries experience periodically. There will probably never be a permanent cessation of crises, any more t h a n there will ever be permanent peace. However, just as it is t h e d u t y of diplomats and statesmen constantly to reduce t h e possibility and probability of wars b y t h e prudent removal, prevention, or mitigation of all disturbances of t h e political equilibrium, so it is t h e d u t y of t h e directors of t h e great banks to prevent in an ever-increasing degree t h e breaking out of crises, to guard against a disturbance of t h e economic equilibrium as much as can be done by external influence, and b y a cautious and preventive business policy in all t h e above-mentioned spheres of activity. This implies to a continuously increasing degree an accurate knowledge of t h e internal conditions of indust r y , commerce and the exchanges, also of t h e financial a n d commodity markets, and t h e general international situation. 15 National Monetary Commission This d u t y entails above all a keen perception of those symptoms which, like storm-petrels flying before t h e storm, act as signals to t h e experienced observer. Science, in modern times, with t h e aid of particularly delicate instruments, has been able t o record earthquakes, and with accurate knowledge of t h e factors determinative of a change of weather (as contained in t h e reports of meteorological stations) to predict storms and give timely warning to those concerned. Similarly, undeterred by t h e course of contemporary events, experienced observers, with t h e help of modern scientific resources, and knowledge gained from former crises, ought to be able to read disturbances of equilibrium as from an economic seismograph, and thus predict t h e approach of crises. The study of t h e history of crises 17 shows in t h e most striking manner t h a t , provided t h e same causes exist, t h e effects are as similar as if one crisis had \" c o p i e d \" its predecessor, as a schoolboy copies his neighbor's essay, or as a legislator frequently copies the draft of his fellow-legislator's bill. Crises m a y be defined as lengthy and serious disturbances of t h e bases of either t h e production, supply, or market systems, of t h e p a y m e n t and credit systems, or of t h e m u t u a l relations of these systems. F r o m t h e history of crises, 18 t h e knowledge of which I regard as indispensable to every director of a bank, it can be established with certainty t h a t almost without exception every crisis (stock exchange, credit, commercial, production crisis, etc.) is preceded b y a more or less rapid rise of the rates for short-time credit, i. e., of t h e discount rates. 16 The German Great Banks It will also be noticed that the cause of such a rise in the discount rate is almost invariably an increase in the demand for credit, a demand far exceeding the available resources, which, wherever a central state note bank exists, finds expression in a great increase in the demands made on its funds. The banks, by virtue of their accurate knowledge of stock exchange conditions, of market quotations, of \"reports\" and \"deports,\" and of the rates for daily and ultimo money, are best qualified to answer the question whether such an increase in the demand for credit is accompanied by a corresponding increase in stockexchange speculation. They are also able to draw fairly accurate conclusions, from the extent and kind of bill, acceptance and current account credit required by their customers, as well as from the volume of their report and collateral accounts, as to the existence, or the approach, of such excessive speculation as is likely to cause the outbreak of a crisis on the exchange. The greater their clientele the more reliable are such conclusions. The approach of an industrial or a commercial crisis can be perceived or inferred not only from general economic conditions, but also from a series of phenomena which take place in the field of bank transactions. The imminence of such crises can be inferred from the rapid growth of the claims made on the credit of the central note bank, and in view of the growing intimacy between industry and the banking world, from a series of occurrences that become reflected in the internal bank management, as well as in the impaired liquidity of the bank's assets and the decrease of available cash resources. 90311 °—ii 3 17 National Monetary Commission These symptoms need not manifest themselves in their entirety nor simultaneously. Some of these occurrences are: The increased credit demands, growing by leaps and bounds and becoming more striking each day, and the excessive, and finally complete withdrawals of existing cash deposits. Further, the displacement of short-term credit by long-term credit; the rapid rise in the number of bills due that have to be extended; the constantly increasing offer of securities of an inferior and unsound nature from a banking standpoint. Other signs (though they are at first not easily recognised as such) are the demand by manufacturers of bank credit, especially of acceptance credit, not intended for current operating expenses but for paying dividends, or for considerably augmenting fixed capital, i. e., extension of plant, new machines, premises, etc.19 Next, the continual demand for advances without any stated reasons, or for veiled purposes; the constantly growing delay in the receipt of payments due, and of the so-called ''specifications\" in industry (which only gradually become known to the bankers, and seldom to their full extent); the great and rapid changes, especially the sudden rise of prices of raw materials and manufactures; finally, a superabundance of promotions, conversions, and flotations, and the wholesale establishment of subsidiary, affiliated, and trust companies. Although Helfferich20 has proved (I venture to say with mathematical exactness), that in most cases (especially as regards the last German crisis) the amount of the gold production, gold imports and exports, never had the importance which Sombart ascribed to them; still, like the fluctuations of the rates of exchange and discount (bank 18 The German Great Banks and private discount), these factors should also be carefully watched. Finally, important aids have recently been made available which in a characteristic manner—though with some limitations—help to diagnose the approach of industrial or commercial crises. I have in mind the valuable reports first published in Germany by J. Jastrow, the editor of the Arbeitsmarkt and later continued in the Official Labor Gazette (Reichsarbeitsblatt). These reports give data regarding the labor market, especially the demand and supply at the public labor exchanges and the extent of unemployment. It was these reports I had in mind when I referred above to modern scientific auxiliaries.21 Laxity in the observation and appreciation of such causes, especially if produced by ignorance of former crises at home and abroad, is one of the gravest and most fatal mistakes of which bankers can be guilty. It is the less excusable the larger the power and the capital of the bank, the wider the field of economic observation and the greater the influence which may be exercised by means of a prudent business policy. A deficiency in this respect prevents the bank management from taking measures at the proper time, i. e., before the outbreak of the crisis, and thus if not preventing a crisis, at least mitigating its severity. The extent, nature, and opportuneness of such measures above all serve as a reliable gauge of the efficiency, prudence, and foresight of a bank management. For, during a crisis, it is difficult, often impossible, to pursue a restrictive business policy, to collect outstanding debts, to call in credits, to decline to discount bills and 19 National Monetary Commission acceptances; indeed such a policy is generally a serious mistake, likely to cause an increase of the extent and intensity of the crisis, for it may give rise to the disastrous notion that money and credit are not merely dear, but are not to be had at all.22 What is required is a preventive policy, a cautious intervention before the outbreak of the crisis. To do this it is necessary to give opportune warnings against drawing bills, increasing engagements, and credit; to make seasonable reference to the abovementioned indications of the probable approach of a crisis, while making provision at the same time for a slow and prudent though consistent increase in the liquidity of the bank's resources. Provided this is done, the bank can not only await quietly all dangers, but is also able to offer support and aid in the form of discreet help, or energetic and conspicuous intervention in order to prevent or at least lessen and mitigate the collapse of otherwise sound undertakings, temporary embarrassments of clients, and serious disturbances of the market. In this manner, the suddenness of the outbreak, as well as the extent, duration, and seriousness of a crisis are reduced. A further effect of such a policy is that the crisis is not followed by a period of lingering and latent depression, which is frequently worse than the crisis itself, and which renders recovery, i. e., return to normal conditions, much more difficult. It must be acknowledged, however, that for persons standing in the midst of business and practical life, and who are frequently confronted by occurrences of a contradictory nature, or difficult to fathom, it is far more difficult to perceive the approach of a crisis, than for critics, who ex post, or after the outbreak, can 20 The German Great Banks easily review circumstances and symptoms that have then become clear and connected. As a general rule, however, threatening signs such as are described above (p. 17) as almost regular harbingers of a crisis, ought to be correctly diagnosed whenever they occur not singly, but as connected or mutually complementary symptoms of a serious affection of the body economic. It is a nobile officium, especially of the great banks, to intervene after the outbreak of a crisis, not only where their own clients or interests are concerned, to lend their support, attempt reconstruction and thus to prevent or at least remedy a serious disturbance of the market by conspicuous and therefore especially efficacious action. It will always redound to the credit of the great Berlin banks and bankers that through their intervention immediately after the collapse of the Preussische HypothekenAktienbank, of the Deutsche Grundschuldbank and of the Pommersche Hypotheken-Aktienbank, they prevented (with almost immediate and favorable effect) the absolute demoralization of the entire mortgage bond market, and that through the reorganization of these concerns 23 they reduced to a minimum the losses sustained in wide circles on account of the securities issued by these establishments. 24 The same applies to their intervention during the catastrophe in Saxony. (c) T H E TASKS OF T H E BANKS I N TIME OF WAR AND I N PREPARING FOR WAR (FINANCIAL READINESS FOR WAR AND FINANCIAL CONDUCT OF W A R ) . 2 5 Banks have also to make timely provision (as far as possible) in times of peace for the eventuality of war. 21 National Monetary Commission The marshaling of financial forces must correspond to that of military forces, and just as military mobilisation is made possible by careful plans made in times of peace, so too the marshalling of financial forces should be facilitated by schemes likewise devised in times of peace. Weaknesses and gaps in the financial mobilisation may be paid for as dearly as mistakes in the tactical deploying of forces, for to both applies what I have said elsewhere, \" t h a t it is impossible without severe losses to evolve a battle formation in the face of the enemy.\" The most important preparation for financial mobilisation consists in fashioning the credit system in such an elastic manner that in case of war it can cope with the agitated and suddenly increasing calls for credit. To meet this contingency, reserves must be created in time of peace: reserves of considerable extent which can be realised rapidly, i. e., mobilised. These must include on the one hand a considerable amount of domestic firstclass securities, especially government and municipal bonds, which in war times can be pledged, if necessary or desired, at the \"war lombard offices\" (Kriegs-LombardKassen) ,26 On the other hand, they must include foreign Goldvaluten, i. e., bills and other claims receivable abroad in gold, and prime foreign gold securities negotiable on various foreign bourses, consequently possessing an international market.27 Through the realisation of these gold equivalents, and by calling in outstanding debts from abroad, i. e., by utilising these reserves (the value of which in such cases will be comprehended by the veriest layman), a panic will usually be averted. 22 The German Great Banks The enemy, however, may endeavor to aggravate a panic of this description by the sudden collection of outstanding claims, by an unlimited sale of our home securities, and by other attempts to deprive Germany of gold. Attempts may also be made to dislocate our capital, bill, and security markets, and to menace the basis of our system of credit and payments. Such a panic might easily occur during the first few days after the declaration of war if the impetuous demand for ready cash and cash reserves (Angstreserveri) 28 is not amply and immediately satisfied. The latter demand often leads to precipitate withdrawals of giro and current account balances and of deposits, to the recall of credit, and to the precipitate sales of merchandise and securities. Accordingly, the banks must endeavor to terminate such conditions as rapidly as possible, as well as to stem the feverish demand for, and the collection of ready money from all depositories, and places of hoarding and storing, so that normal conditions are reestablished, under which all the expedients and substitutes obviating the use of cash will once more assume their normal importance for circulating purposes. Above all, the business policy described above (p. 20) as indispensable during a crisis, must be pursued in times of tension and agitation, which generally precede a war long before its outbreak. Among others, restrictive measures, such as the withdrawal of credit, the refusal to accept bills, or to discount customers' bills, must be avoided. In the next place, interventions should be made in the market, and all means used for the gradual restoring of public confidence in the solid groundwork of our finance and 23 National Monetary Commission credit systems. It is such confidence which underlies not only the acceptance of all cash substitutes (Geldsurrogate), which abound to a far greater degree than ready money, but also the determination to fulfil all pending engagements, or at least to terminate them slowly and cautiously, as well as the resolution not to withdraw deposits, nor to flood the market with securities at extremely low rates, &c. The ''great banks\" should cooperate in all these directions, not only by word or through influencing their clients, but by their own example, especially by exercising the greatest reserve in withdrawing their credit balances from the Reichsbank, and in presenting bills for re-discounting. Besides this, they should aid those \"financial precautionary measures\" which come within their sphere of activity—i. e., those measures which may be undertaken after the declaration of war in order to ease the market and credit demand and to maintain our gold standard, and the circulation of our bank notes.29 In Germany, as I have endeavoured to prove elsewhere,30 these tasks would be facilitated to some extent during the critical weeks immediately following a declaration of war by the amount of bullion likely to be at our disposal, which includes the \"war treasure\" of 120,000,000 marks in the Julius tower 31 at Spandau (this latter, however, would not go far); and by the further fact that the expenses of mobilisation,32 as far as can be judged to-day, could be covered by the issue of bank notes.33 Another gratifying consequence would be that during this particularly critical time the Government would not have to apply to the Reichsbank with extensive demands for cash; and further, that in so far as the State did not prefer to meet 24 The German Great Banks its requirements by additional taxes,34 it could await a calmer and more favorable condition of the money market for contracting loans to defray the cost of war.35 The most important consequence of this fact is, that in negotiating such loans,36 the cooperation and good offices of the \" great banks \" and great banking establishments can be counted on to a far greater degree, and with much more certainty than if the negotiations took place during the days immediately following the declaration of war, when the resources of the banks would be taxed to an extraordinary extent. It is impossible for the Reichsbank in Germany to execute smoothly and successfully its numerous and difficult tasks in war time without the assistance of the great banks which form such an important factor in the whole economic organisation of the country. The latter, however, must prepare in times of peace in the manner described above, if they are to render effective support during war time. On the other hand, it would be preposterous to demand of them complete \" readiness for war,\" such as would exclude or paralyse the banks' capacities for doing their customary business.37 During the stages of deliberation by the administration of the imperial treasury and the Reichsbank concerning the adoption of the sometimes extremely complicated financial measures for the maintenance of the German currency and credit systems, as well as for affording relief to the market, and facilitating money and credit transactions during war times,38 the directors of the great banks and banking houses by reason of their practical experience, their intimate acquaintance with the situation and the receptive capacity of the money market, particularly 25 National Monetary Commission by reason of their exact knowledge of the requirements and capabilities of their clientele, should be amongst the first called upon to serve as a ''financial general-staff\" to the imperial treasury and the Reichsbank. The above presents a broad outline at least of the most essential of the many and gradually increasing duties performed with untiring perseverance by the German banks.39 In order to appreciate their achievements, it should be borne in mind that during the first period (i848-1870) their work and progress was greatly hampered by crises and European wars, by German political impotence and lack of unity, by our lack of capital, and the medley of German monetary and coinage conditions of those years. I shall now proceed to outline the growth of these duties during the two epochs of general economic development, and the development of the German banks (with particular reference to the great banks). These two clearly marked epochs extend from the middle of the nineteenth century to 1870, and from that year to the present day. As far as is possible without effacing or obscuring the picture of the general course of development of the German great banks, I shall endeavor to do what I omitted in former editions of this book, namely, to show in what manner, and with what success each individual great bank participated in the common work. Indeed, a thorough and proper appreciation of the course of development of each great bank will become possible only after detailed monograph studies of each of these shall have been published.40 The most important works of reference used in this book will be found in the appendix. 26 PART II. THE FIRST PERIOD (FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE X I X CENTURY TO THE YEAR 1870). CHAPTER I.—SKETCH OF THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN GERMANY AT THE TIME OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ODDEST EXISTING CREDIT BANKS. In 1848—the beginning of the period about to be discussed—about 200 years had passed since the end of the * Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). Even then, however, Germany, which in consequence of her geographical position from remote ages presented a favorite battlefield for the whole of Europe, had not yet completely recovered from the thorough spoliation and devastation she had undergone. A re-establishment of her completely ruined trade and of her shattered fortunes was impossible during the period from 1648 to 1815, owing to a series of European wars. These were in particular the campaigns of lyouis XIV, the Spanish War of Succession, the Seven Years' War, and the struggles against Napoleon. Those wars and campaigns were once more fought on German soil by powerful enemies, who like Louis XIV seized parts of the country (for instance, Strassburg, 1681), and devastated anew other parts, such as the Palatinate and other Rhenish countries. During the latter years of that period (18061815), the wars carried on with changing fortune against Napoleon I, which terminated with his dethronement and 27 National Monetary Commission banishment, prevented the beginning of recovery. It was only during the three decades of undisturbed peace (i815-1848), which preceded the economic epoch about to be described (1848-1870), that the German nation had time to recuperate and to engage in the first attempts to rehabilitate trade, industry, and agriculture. 1 Evidently, it is only possible to outline here the main points in the economic conditions of Germany brought about by this lengthy period of peace, and only in as far as they bear on the development and tasks of German banking. The population of Germany numbered at that time about 35,000,000, and was not more than that of France (34,500,000). Of capital there was but little; it was estimated that in Prussia there were 720 marks per head of the population, whereas the amount for England was 2,860 marks, according to an estimate made almost simultaneously (1845) .2 At that period England had almost completed her transition to a great industrial and manufacturing country, supplying more than half of the world's requirements. Her annual coal production at the beginning of the 19th century was about 10,000,000 tons, while that of Germany toward the end of the century was little more than 120,000,000 tons. In accordance with French example, serfdom, as well as the hereditary subjection of the peasants had ceased in the country during the first half of the 19th century, although its abolition was slow, especially in the east of Germany, where it had been firmly rooted for centuries. The abolition of hereditary subjection did away not only with the obligation to furnish hand and team for the benefit of the 28 The German Great Banks landlords, but—what proved of even greater and increasing importance—with the obligation on the part of the peasant to remain on the estate, or in the village belonging to the same. In German industry, despite modsBt attempts at reform undertaken by the legislation of the individual states, the system of guilds (Zunftwesen) was predominant. Only a few German States, e. g., Prussia (by the laws of 1810 and 1811) and Nassau, had abolished the obligation of craftsmen to join guilds, and to obtain certificates of ability (Befahigungsnachweis), and had introduced, on principle, freedom of trade, an action against which a vigorous protest was launched by the craftsmen's \" parliament \" sitting at Frankfort-on-the-Main from July 15 to August 18, 1848. Fairs continued to enjoy great importance in some towns even after 1850, at least for a number of special wares.3 Trade was confined mostly to local markets and fairs. Delivery trade by sample had, however, started on a small scale. But the conditions for economic reform in most of the German States had already been created by the establishment in 1834 of the German Zollverein. It may be justly said, that this great Prussian innovation, which transformed the participant German States into a unified economic area, dealt the death blow to the mediaeval economic system in Germany. It was only then that a uniform economic policy became possible in the participating States, a policy which soon asserted itself by its urgent demands for protection of new and growing industries against the overwhelming economic superiority of England. The average annual value of the imports into the territory included in the Zollverein for the period 184229 National Monetary Commission 1846 has been calculated by K. H. Rau (Grundsatze der Volkswirtschaftslehre, 8 ed., part 2, p. 318) at 210,303,000 thalers, or about 630,000,000 marks, while the exports have beeifc valued at 170,089,000 thalers, or about 510,000,000 marks, which amounts should be used only with reservation. During the last decade of that period the exports rose quite considerably. Industry was still mainly of the so-called domestic type, and principally carried on in the country. This applies particularly to the manufacture of textiles (spinning and weaving).4 In the country it was still customary to manufacture at home nearly all the personal requirements in the shape of clothing, linen, and other textile goods. Almost the whole of the German industry seemed to center at that time in the textile and mining industries, both of which were chiefly carried on in the country. 5 The number of workmen 6 employed in these industries exceeded by far the combined number of workmen employed in all other industries. The total number of workmen employed in the mining and smelting industries within the limits of the Zollverein (created on January 1, 1834) about the middle of the nineteenth century was 6o,8oo.7 In Prussia there were 48,659 workmen employed in the same industries (average of the years 1848-1857), as compared with 101,908 according to the trade census of 1895. In 1840 the number of steam-engines employed in the industrial area comprised in the German Zollverein was not quite 500, whereas there were over 5,000 steam-engines at work in England about 1810. According to the Prussian Statistical Annual (Preussisches Statistisches Jahrbuch),8 there were in 1852 only 2,124 steam-engines, developing 43>°5I horse-power, employed in the entire industry of Prussia, of which almost 30 The German Great Banks half (according to number and power) belonged to mines and foundries; machine factories occupied only the fourth place in the list. In the Kingdom of Saxony 9 the number of steamengines used for industrial and agricultural purposes amounted in 1846 to 197 only, with 2,446 horse-power. At the end of this period (1866), however, there were already about 92,000 motors (100,000 H. P.) in use in Germany, whereas in 1895 the total horse-power of all engines in use was 3,400,000, of which 2,000,000 horse-power was employed in industry. In 1840 the whole German freight traffic (with the exception of ocean, town, and rural traffic) was calculated at about 2,000,000,000 ton-kilometers, whereas in 1900 it was estimated at 40,000,000,000 ton-kilometers, or almost twentyfold.10 In i860 the whole of Germany's industrial output equalled only about half that of France; whereas to-day she ranks second to England in Europe, and takes third place in the world, only the United States and England outranking her. About the middle of the nineteenth century the proportion to the total population of industrial workmen u (including those engaged in flour mills and all home industries) amounted in Prussia to only 2.98 per cent. The enormous industrial growth that manifested itself shortly after the establishment of the ZoUverein and its economic measures was due not entirely to that organisation, but primarily to the construction of (private) railways, begun in 1835 with the line between Nuremberg and Furth. This led at the outset to an almost feverish activity in the mining, smelting, machine, and kindred industries. 31 National Monetary Commission As early as the middle of the last century there was quite a considerable demand for pig iron, chiefly by reason of the above-mentioned construction of railways. According to Oechelhauser12 over 17,500,000 quintals (Centner) of pig iron were used in railway construction from 1836 up to the beginning of our period (1850). The home consumption, however, was not met by the home production. England had obtained a great start in the manufacture of that material, 13 coke blast furnaces having been used as early as the eighteenth century in place of the expensive charcoal fuel almost universally in vogue in Germany during the middle of the nineteenth century. In the Siegerland not a single coke blast furnace existed at the beginning of the forties; the first coke blast furnace in the Ruhr district was erected in 1847; moreover, the existing blast furnaces were not very efficient.14 In 1847 the consumption of iron in the region comprised within the Zollverein amounted to 28 Zollpfund (=14 kilograms) per head of the mid-year population (Sering, loc. cit., p. 51), as compared with 309.8 pounds in 1899. The production of pig iron in 1850 was less than that of France, and even of Belgium; it amounted to 208,000,000 kilograms (1875, 2,029,000,000 kilograms). The output of coal amounted in 1850 to 5,800,000 tons, as against 109,220,000 tons in 1900.15 In the district of Siegen 38,880 tons of iron ore, valued at 124,974 thalers, were brought to the surface in 1850, as compared with 997,680 tons, valued at 11,857,779 marks, in 1900.16 In 1858 (according to Sering, loc. cit., p. 82) of the total number of blast furnaces in Prussia, 56.9 per cent 32 The German Great Banks (1,328,429 Zentners) used charcoal, 37.2 per cent (1,527,989 Zentners) coke, 5.9 per cent (243,516 Zentners) coke and charcoal. Mineral fuel (coal) was not used before 1844 except in Silesia, and even there only in small quantities. As a result the iron imports from Great Britain reached 52 and 55 per cent of the total German consumption up to the middle of the last century. This state of affairs underwent a change only with the rapid growth of the use of coal in Germany, and when the Zollverein abandoned its free-trade policy by the imposition in 1844 of a duty on iron, which till then had entered free. It is due to the energetic support of the German credit banks that before long the following prophecy, contained in the business report of 1856 of the A. Schaaffhausen'scher Bankverein (p. 53), was fulfilled to the letter: \"The iron and coal output of Westphalia, and the Rhineland, in the course of a few years, will not fall short of that of Belgium; in the more distant future it will compete successfully in the international market with that of England, provided one of the most important conditions for such competition—namely, the construction of cheap means of communication—receives proper attention.' ' The following figures, giving the proportion of persons engaged in industrial pursuits, as compared with the entire population, apply to Prussia for the middle of last century (1843) :17 Per cent. Agricultural population Industrial population Persons employed in commerce 903 I I ° — n 4 60. 84 to 61. 34 23. 37 o. 97 33 National Monetary Commission In 1846 there was only 1 person employed in trade and industry to every 12.2 inhabitants, though in 1850 the figures were already 1 to every 8.5 inhabitants. In 1849 only 28 per cent of the entire population 18 of Prussia lived in towns, and the population of Berlin did not exceed 331,894 19 (exclusive of soldiers) in 1840, and not quite 500,000 in 1858, and gave employment to only 3,000 workmen in 1840, a number which rose, however, to 10,242 in 1856.20 In 1849 there were only 15 towns in Prussia the population of which exceeded 3o,ooo.21 Excluding Berlin, the following now important industrial towrns had the greatest number of inhabitants: Aix-la-Chapelle (about) Klberfeld (about) Crefeld (about) Chemnitz and Diisseldorf each (about) Dortmund, Duisburg, Essen, and Solingen each (about) 2 2 46, 000 35, 000 30, 000 26, 000 7, 000 With the aid of foreign (English) capital, gas lighting was gradually adopted 28 after 1826 by the larger German towns (first of all by Hanover and Berlin); it was only after 1859 that petroleum became popular for lighting, especially among the middle classes. The construction of railways may be said to have started on a large scale only about the middle of the nineteenth century. From 1835 to 1842 only railways of short length and of merely local significance (between large towns) to a total length of 87 German miles had been constructed. These were the Nuremberg-Furth railway in 1835; the Berlin-Potsdam, and the BraunschweigWolfenbiittel railways in 1838; the Leipzig-Dresden line in 1839; the Leipzig-Magdeburg, the Munich-Augsburg, the Mannheim-Heidelberg, and the Frankfort-Mainz lines in 34 The German Great Banks 1840; and in 1841 the Berlin-Anhalt, the DtisseldorfElberfeld, and the Cologne-Elberfeld railways. Up to 1855, the date when the credit banks appeared on the scene, only 7,800 kilometers of railways had been built, which, spread over the twenty years from 1835, meant only 390 kilometers of new line annually. On the other hand, in 1865, ten years later, almost double the amount of railway mileage (13,900 kilometers) was finished, or 610 kilometers of new line per year, a performance in which the credit banks had taken an active share. In 1875, or ten years later, there were no less than 27,981 kilometers of railways in operation, again a twofold increase. This corresponds to the enormous increase of capital invested in German railway construction during that period. At the beginning of the fifties the amount of this capital was stated as 140,000,000 thalers, in addition to 206,000,000 thalers preference shares, or a total of 346,000,000 thalers (1,038,000,000 marks); somewhat over a billion marks.24 At the end of that period (1870) the invested capital amounted, according to Engel, to over 4,000,000,000 marks (4,072,167,621 marks), in which sum the preference shares are included. As far as the means of transit in Germany were concerned, so-called \" Chausseegeld,\" or road toll, had in many cases to be paid to the end of the sixties, as a contribution toward highway construction and maintenance. In Frankfort-on-the-Main, for instance, this toll was only abolished on May 18, 1866. The highways in Germany had in 1857 a length of only 30,000 kilometers as against 150,000 kilometers in 1900. 35 National Monetary Commission The inland toll-gates in the majority of German States, however, had already been abolished in 1834-35 by the foundation of the Zollverein. This proved a great boon in the economic field. Equally beneficial in the legal field proved the adoption in the fifties and sixties by the various German States of uniform commercial legislation in the shape of the Allgemeine Deutsche Wechselordnung and the Allgemeines Deutsches Handelsgesetzbuch. As far as means of transport were concerned, steamnavigation made a modest beginning on the Weser in 1817 and on the lower Rhine and Elbe in 1818. During the middle of the nineteenth century, however, steam-navigation made more rapid progress. At the end of the fifties Germany had no less than 17 different independent postal administrations in addition to the Prussian-Austrian Postverein.25 In 1867 theThurn and Taxis postal monopoly came to an end by transfer to Prussia. Up to 1844 fees for forwarding ordinary letters within the confines of Prussia went as high as 19 silbergroschen (1 silbergroschen = -^r thaler, or about 2]/2 cents). And it was considered great progress when an agreement was made in 1850 with Austria, whereby the cost of forwarding letters weighing less than 1 lot (lot = about half an ounce) to the farthest of the three zones, or over 20 German miles (1 German mile = 7,420 metres), was fixed at 3 silbergroschen, or 9 kreuzer. It was only as a result of this agreement that, at the beginning of 1850, stamps were introduced in Prussia. Up to that time the fee for conveying letters had to be paid in ready money at the 36 The German Great Banks post-office. Even during the forties the post-offices were only opened on certain days in the week. There were no postmen, not even in the towns, to say nothing of the country; so that letters had to be called for at the postoffice. Letter-boxes were introduced for general use only after 1850. The slow development of postal facilities is best illustrated by a statement of Karl Lamprecht (loc. cit., p. 143) that in Saxony, the \"land of the Leipsic fair,\" the postal regulations remained unchanged between 1713 and 1859. In Great Britain, on the other hand, uniform pennypostage had been introduced in 1840; uniform postage was introduced in Austria in 1861, and in the North German Federation only in 1868. The receipt of a letter, even as late as the middle of the last century, must have been regarded as quite an event, except by large mercantile firms, for there were only 1.5 letters per head of population in Prussia during 1842, and even in 1851, the beginning of the period under consideration, only about 3 letters annually. The telegraph system26 was first opened for public use in Prussia (Aix-la-Chapelle) in 1843, in Bavaria and Saxony in 1850, in Wurttemberg and Baden in 1851, in Hanover in 1852, and in Mecklenburg in 1854. \"The charges of telegraphing were high and ill-arranged. According to the zone tariff of 1858, which on the face of it had already been reduced, it cost 2 gulden 6 kreuzers to send 20 words from Frankfort-on-the-Main to Nuremberg, or almost as much as to Amsterdam or Como (2 gulden 48 kreuzers); the shortest telegram to Bochum cost 4 gulden 12 kreuzers, almost as much as to Tilsit or Orsova (4 37 National Monetary Commission gulden 54 kreuzers.)\" 27 In 1850 only 35,000 telegrams were sent in Prussia, as against 1,500,000 in 1865. Only 102 joint-stock companies of all kinds, with a total capital of 638,000,000 marks, or an annual average of less than 27,000,000 marks, were formed in Prussia between the years 1826 and 1850, that is in twenty-four years.28 On the other hand, during the following nineteen years, the period from 1851 to the first half of the year 1870, 295 joint-stock companies, or almost three times as many, with a total capital of about 2,405,000,000 marks,29 were formed in Prussia, making an annual average capital of over 124,000,000 marks, or more than four times as much as in the preceding period. Among the German exchanges at the beginning of this period, the one at Frankfort-on-the-Main was the most influential for state loans and similar securities, whereas the Berlin exchange took the lead in railway securities, the amount of which, however, was not yet great.30 Sixty-three securities were quoted on the Berlin Stock Exchange in 1850 as against 309 in 1870, and 1,872 in 1900. At Frankfort-on-the-Main the first special organs dealing with financial and commercial questions were published, viz: The Aktiondr, on January 1, 1854; the Frankfurter Geschaftsberichty on July 21, 1856 (which, on August 27, 1856, became the Frankfurter Zeitung und Handelsblatt). In the meantime, however (before the publication of the Frankfurter Geschaftsbericht), the Berliner Boersenzeitung, with the Thursday supplement, the Berliner BoersenCourier, was published on July 1, 1855, in Berlin. As far as the systems of coinage, money, and banks are concerned, the following details may be of interest: 38 The German Great Banks During the whole of the period under consideration, and to the final adoption of the common German coinage system in 1870, no less than 7 different kinds of coinage existed in the various German States, which, with the exception of that of Bremen, were all based on the silver standard. Between the South German gulden and the North German thaler standards a fixed ratio had been established at the general coinage conference in 1838 (Dresdner Convention), but solely for purposes of calculation,31 i. e., no State belonging to the convention was obliged to admit the circulation of the coins of any other State belonging to the convention. The variety of the systems of coinage and standards at home and abroad was doubtless one of the main reasons why bankers, who were called money changers at that time, in the centers of trade and traffic at least, formed a prosperous and well-filled profession. At the center of money changing for middle and south Germany, namely, the free town of Frankfort-on-the-Main, there were 109 private bankers in 1855, among a total of 1,131 firms; and toward the end of the period under discussion (1868-69), x 9 2 private bankers out of a total of 1,829 firms.32 These private bankers, who in numerous cases carried on simultaneously commission business or commission and forwarding business, formed a very respected class, especially at Frankfort-on-the-Main, a long time before the period in question, having identified themselves with the general existing commercial interests. A most striking proof of this is an occurrence which took place in 1810: \" B y the order of Napoleon (at the time of the Continental System) two French officials in Frankfort 39 National Monetary Commission confiscated 185 chests containing English goods, the property of Frankfort merchants, and burnt them in front of the gates of the town. Upon this the Frankfort bankers refused to continue the discounting of French bills, and caused thereby numerous failures in Strassburg, Nancy, Rheims, and other places.\" 33 Thereupon the Continental System was soon repealed in Frankfort-on-the-Main. What was true of Frankfort-on-the-Main, however, is not applicable to other towns and districts. In Stuttgart, for instance, there were in 1855 only 14 firms (including the Royal Court Bank) which claimed to belong to the banking and discounting profession, and only one each in Heilbronn and Ulm. \" These were, however, partly carried on in connection with other occupations, especially with the forwarding business.'' The modest position held by these firms appears best from the fact that in the industrial census taken in 1855 (no changes of importance took place between 1852 and 1855) 25 banking firms are mentioned employing only a total number of 68 assistants.34 In the whole Kingdom of Prussia (in the territory before 1866) the number of persons employed in the money and credit business during 1858 (after several years of economic prosperity), including principals and assistants, amounted only to about 1,800 (1,774), a n ( i these were distributed among 602 enterprises, so that there were 602 principals and 1,172 assistants, or about two assistants to each business. Of these 1,800 persons, 384 were employed in Berlin alone.85 At the beginning of the period under consideration modern methods of payment and credit had not yet devel40 The German Great Banks oped, and the giro and current-account business was \"almost unknown,\" with the exception of places like Hamburg, where special conditions prevailed. Even in a large commercial center such as Frankfort-on-the-Main, at the beginning of the fifties, numerous porters with small trucks laden with sacks and barrels of silver money could be seen moving about the streets \" a t any hour in the forenoon.\" 86 The discounting of bills was \"seldom practiced\" 37 in Germany, except in chief trade centers and exchange towns, and a systematic fostering of the deposit business was still less in evidence, either at the credit banks (p. 73) or at the note-issuing banks existing at the beginning of the period. The amount of deposits at the Prussian Bank, for instance, totaled only about 22,740,000 thalers (equal to 68,220,000 marks) 38 in 1850, in spite of the inflow of capital which had taken place in consequence of the discovery of gold mines in California (1848) and in Australia (1851), and the simultaneous discovery of new quicksilver mines in Mexico. In other banks of issue the deposits were for the most part much smaller.39 At the same time, however, powerful factors (mentioned above on p. 28) were making for progress. Above all, the era of peace that had prevailed in Germany for an unprecedented length of time (1815-1848) had caused a relatively large accumulation of capital, which was seeking profitable investment. As early as 1844 the first industrial exhibition in the 2ollverein area stimulated industry in numerous directions. The international exhibition in London in 1851, at which the latest industrial progress and inventions were shown, exerted a powerful influence on Germany. A 41 National Monetary Commission few years later (1856) a great revolution took place in the iron industry through the application of Bessemer's principle of turning pig iron into steel 40 without the aid of human power by inclosing the pig in pear-shaped chambers (converters) and by conducting heated air through it from powerful blast apparatuses—a process adapted in 1865 by Martin to ore containing small amounts of phosphorus and, in 1879, by Thomas and Gilchrist to ore rich in phosphorus. In the years 1834-1854 aniline colors were invented, and in 1868 alizarine colors. In 1840, Liebig published his manual on chemistry and its use in agriculture, which laid the foundation of modern agriculture. From 1831-1840 to 1871-1880 constant progress, with few interruptions, was experienced in agriculture. In the old Prussian provinces during this period, the price of rye rose 69 per cent, that of wheat 60 per cent, and of barley 90 per cent; the selling price of land not less than 200-300 per cent; the rents of the Prussian domains increased from 4,500,000 marks, or 13.9 marks per hectare (1 hectare = 2.471 acres), in 1849, to 10,200,000 marks, or 35.6 marks per hectare, or an increase of 156 per cent. These rises were frequently out of proportion with the increases in the prices of agricultural products and in the productiveness of the area used for agricultural purposes,41 As stated before, various industries, such as cotton spinning, at the beginning of this period introduced manufacturing on a large scale (production on a large scale had commenced in the mining industry many years before). The large industries were, however, unable to attain a 42 The German Great Banks dominant part in the whole of industry, in which home production still played a leading part. In the last decade of this period we can also perceive a tendency toward increasing the exports of industrial products the rapid development of which in the second period gradually caused a complete transformation in the character of the whole German economic organization. Hand in hand with the large increase of population, a serious transformation deeply affecting the whole of agriculture (which at this period was at the height of prosperity) had been gradually developing, which led to a considerable portion of the country's agricultural requirements being met by foreign imports; whereas at the beginning of this period, the exports of important German agricultural products, with the exception of rye, considerably exceeded the imports.42 (As early as i860, the imports of rye exceeded the exports by 259,000 tons.43) Industry, particularly the mining, machine construction, and metal industries, etc., received large orders owing to the rapid increase of railway construction, and was protected and strengthened, to some extent at least, through the measures taken by the Zollverein against foreign importations. The expansion of industry, however, and with it the growing transition to large-scale industry (Grossbetrieb), became an absolute necessity for the support and employment of the population, which showed its greatest increase at the beginning of this period, and continued to grow in later years. Between 1816-1845 the population had increased from 24,800,000 to 34,400,000 (by about 9,600,000 or 38.7 per cent), whereas between 1845-1875 it had increased only 43 National Monetary Commission by 8,300,000, or 24.1 per cent, and between 1865-1895 only 31.8 per cent. This growth, noticed in most of the German States up to the middle of the last century, was almost entirely in favor of the rural population, though we must not lose sight of the fact that a great many of the industrial concerns (as has been already mentioned), (p. 30) were situated in the country. L,oud complaints were heard almost everywhere at that time that \" there were too many people in the country/' and it was frequently stated with the greatest emphasis that the country was unable to support a population of that number, and ways and means should be devised to meet the new conditions.44 As a matter of fact the population of the agricultural districts (especially those east of the river Elbe) increased in the period 1816 to 1877 nearly 91 per cent, while that of the industrial western and southern parts of Germany increased only somewhat over 23 per cent, whereas between 1871 and 1900 the proportions were exactly the reverse (26 and 79 per cent).45 It was under such economic conditions that the first German credit banks were established. CHAPTER I I . — T H E GERMAN BANKS DURING THE FIRST PERIOD (1848-18 70). It is easy to realize at present the exceptionally strong influence exercised at the beginning of this period (about the fifties) by the very great and rapid development of the German railway system, above all on the mining and machine industries. In order to appreciate it, we need only recall the startling growth of the mining and machine 44 The German Great Banks industries, occasioned by the rapid development of the electrical industry during the second period, although quite different financial and banking conditions exist today. In both cases, however, the immediate consequences were serious crises (1857 and 1900), which were brought on, however, in part by other causes. The mining and smelting industries were the first to undergo this transformation of which we have been amazed witnesses.46 It is these industries which are mainly responsible for the spread of capitalism and the development of large-scale production, as well as the gradual and radical change in the general economic conditions of the country.47 The enormous demands of the newly constructed railways for iron, coal, sleepers, locomotives, cars, etc., could not be met even approximately by the means at the disposal of the industry of those days. New undertakings of all descriptions, and the enlargement of existing ones, were necessary. Figures and requirements, however, were calculated at ten times the right amounts, as is the wont of reckless persons in agitated times, in whose minds the prospective profits are sure to assume gigantic proportions. Thus, at the beginning of our epoch, following the new railway enterprises, there arose in rapid succession, and in strange medley, a large number of other new jointstock companies, especially in the fields of mining, smelting-machine construction, and banking. The list of German credit banks founded during the first eight years of this period (1848-1856), and which were mostly provided with share capital ample at least for the period in question, will be found in Appendix II at the 45 National Monetary Commission end of this book. Among them the following were prominent at that time, according to the amount of their capital: (i) 1848: The A, Schaaffhausen'scher Bankverein at Cologne, formed as the result of the reorganisation of the old banking firm of Abraham Schaaffhausen (which had been seriously affected by the troubles in 1848), with a capital of 5,187,000 thalers, or, in round numbers, 5,200,000 thalers = 15,600,000 marks, of which about 3,000,000 (3,199,800) thalers was immediately issued. (2) 1851: The Disconto-Gesellschaft in Berlin, which started however as a mere \"credit partnership\" (Kreditgesellschaft). In 1856 it was transformed into its present shape, namely, a joint stock company en commandite under the name of the Direction der Disconto Gesellschaft, with a capital of 10,000,000 thalers = 30,000,000 marks, which was issued in two instalments of 5,000,000 thalers each. (3) !853: The Bank filr Handel und Industrie, which took up its headquarters at Darmstadt because no concession could be obtained at that time for a joint-stock banking company, either in the free town of Frankfort-onthe-Main or in Prussia. The nominal capital amounted to 25,000,000 florins = 42,750,000 marks, of which, however, only 10,000,000 florins = 17,100,000 marks was issued at first; it was only in the year 1856, when the Disconto Gesellschaft was transformed, that the Darmstadter Bank assumed the size first contemplated. (4) 1856: The Mitteldeutsche Creditbank at Meiningen, with a capital of 8,000,000 thalers (24,000,000 marks), of which, however, 3,000,000 thalers (9,000,000 marks) remained in the portfolio of the bank; in reality, there46 The German Great Banks fore, the capital was made up of 5,000,000 thalers only, divided into 50,000 shares of 100 thalers each; moreover, of this amount 1,000,000 thalers were redeemed in 1859. (5) 1856: The Berliner Handelsgesellschaft with a share capital of 15,000,000 thalers (45,000,000 marks), of which only a small part was paid in at first, namely, 3,740,150 thalers; of this latter sum 800,000 thalers (4,000 shares of 200 thalers each) remained in possession of the company. In the four years (1853-1857) the paid-up share capitals of the railway companies newly formed in the various German States, which were almost exclusively in private hands (see p. 35), amounted to over 140,000,000 thalers, and that of the joint-stock banks (Bankaktiengesellschajten) to over 200,000,000 thalers (600,000,000 marks).
