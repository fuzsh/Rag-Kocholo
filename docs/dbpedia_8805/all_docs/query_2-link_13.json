        "text": "Reply of the Allied and Associated Powers to the Observations of the German Delegation on the Conditions of Peace\n\nintroduction. basis of the peace negotiations\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers are in complete accord with the German Delegation in their insistence that the basis for the negotiation [Page 936] of the Treaty of Peace is to be found in the correspondence which immediately preceded the signing of the Armistice on November 11, 1918. It was there agreed that the Treaty of Peace should be based upon the Fourteen Points of President Wilson’s address of January 8, 1918, as they were modified by the Allies’ memorandum included in the President’s note of November 5, 1918,7 and upon the principles of settlement enunciated by President Wilson in his later addresses, and particularly in his address of September 27, 1918.8 These are the principles upon which hostilities were abandoned in November 1918, these are the principles upon which the Allied and Associated Powers agreed that peace might be based, these are the principles which have guided them in the deliberations which have led to the formulation of the Conditions of Peace.\n\nIt is now contended by the German Delegation that the Conditions of Peace do not conform to these principles which had thus become binding upon the Allied and Associated Powers as well as upon the Germans themselves. In an attempt to prove a breach of this agreement the German Delegation have drawn quotations from a number of speeches, most of which were before the Address to Congress and many of which were uttered by Allied statesmen at a time when they were not at war with Germany, or had no responsibility for the conduct of public affairs. The Allied and Associated Powers consider it unnecessary, therefore, to oppose this list of detached quotations with others equally irrelevant to a discussion concerning the basis of the peace negotiations. In answer to the implication of these quotations, it is sufficient to refer to a note of the Allied Powers transmitted to the President of the United States on January 10, 1917,9 in response to an inquiry as to the conditions upon which they would be prepared to make peace:\n\nIn the same note, in addition to a reference to Poland, they declared the War Aims of the Allies to include:\n\nIt cannot be disputed that responsible statesmen, those qualified to express the will of the peoples of the Allied and Associated Powers, have never entertained or expressed a desire for any other peace than one which should undo the wrongs of 1914, vindicate justice and international right, and reconstruct the political foundations of Europe on lines which would give liberty to all its peoples, and therefore the prospect of a lasting peace.\n\nBut the German Delegation profess to find discrepancies between the agreed basis of peace and the draft of the Treaty. They discover a contradiction between the terms of the Treaty and a statement taken from an address delivered at Baltimore on April 6, 1918, by President Wilson:\n\nThis quotation does not stand alone. It should be read in conjunction with one of the cardinal principles of the Mount Vernon address of July 4, 1918,10 which demanded:\n\nNeither of these two principles of the agreed basis of peace has been lost sight of in the formulation of these Conditions.\n\nThe German Delegation see in the provisions with regard to territorial settlements a conflict between the terms of the Treaty and the following statement made by President Wilson on June 9 [7], 1918:11\n\nIn their communication they enumerate a number of territorial settlements and conclude that “their basis is indifferently, now the consideration of an unchangeable historical right, now the principle of ethnographical facts, now the consideration of economic interests. In every case the decision is against Germany.”\n\nIf in certain cases, not in all, the decision has in fact not been in favour of Germany, this is not the result of any purpose to act unjustly towards Germany. It is the inevitable result of the fact that an appreciable portion of the territory of the German Empire consisted of districts which had in the past been wrongfully appropriated by Prussia or by Germany. It is a chief duty of the Allied and Associated Powers to rectify these injustices in accordance with the explicit statement of President Wilson in his address to Congress of February 11, 1918:12\n\nThe German Delegation find a conflict between the terms of the Treaty which set forth the economic provisions and the third of President Wilson’s Fourteen Points:\n\nIn their application of this principle the German Delegation would neglect entirely the economic conditions which have resulted from the war, with their own country intact and in no wise suffering from the devastation brought upon the lands and homes of the Allied peoples. They nevertheless seek immediate admission to all of the trade arrangements which are to be provided for by the Conditions of Peace. This would have the effect of establishing an inequality of trade conditions which would continue in Europe for many years to come. Equality can only be established by arrangements which take into account the existing differences in economic strength and industrial integrity of the peoples of Europe. But the Conditions of Peace contain some provisions for the future which may outlast the transition [Page 939] period during which the economic balance is to be restored; and a reciprocity is foreseen after that period which is very clearly that equality of trade conditions for which President Wilson has stipulated.\n\nThe German Delegation profess to find in the terms of the Treaty a violation of the principle expressed by President Wilson before Congress on February 11, 1918:\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers emphatically reject the suggestion that there has been any “bartering about” of peoples and provinces. Every territorial settlement of the Treaty of Peace has been determined upon after most careful and laboured consideration of all the religious, racial and linguistic factors in each particular country. The legitimate hopes of peoples long under alien rule have been heard; and the decisions in each instance have been founded upon the principle explicitly enunciated in this same address; that\n\nFinally, the German Delegation take exception to the fact that Germany has not been invited to join in the formation of the League of Nations as an original member. President Wilson’s declarations, “however, envisaged no league of nations which would include Germany at the outset, and no statement of his can be adduced in support of this contention. Indeed, in his speech of September 27, 1918, he laid down with the greatest precision the conditions which must govern her admission:\n\nand further,\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers look forward to the time when the League of Nations established by this Treaty shall extend its membership to all peoples; but they cannot abandon any of the essential conditions of an enduring League.\n\n[Page 940]\n\npart i. the league of nations\n\nI\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers regard the Covenant of the League of Nations as the foundation of the Treaty of Peace. They have given careful consideration to all its terms and they are convinced that it introduces an element of progress into the relations of peoples which the future will develop and strengthen to the advantage of justice and of peace.\n\nThe text of the Treaty itself makes it clear that it has never been the intention of the Allied and Associated Powers that Germany or any other power should be indefinitely excluded from the League of Nations. Provisions have accordingly been laid down which apply generally to States not members of the League and which determine the conditions of their admission subsequent to its formation.\n\nAny State whose government shall have given clear proofs of its stability as well as of its intention to observe its international obligations—particularly those obligations which arise out of the Treaty of Peace—will find the Principal Allied and Associated Powers disposed to support its candidature for admission to the League.\n\nIn the case of Germany, it is hardly necessary to say that the record of the last five years is not of a character to justify an exception, at the present time, to the general rule to which reference has just been made. Her case demands a definite test. The length of this period will largely depend upon the acts of the German Government, and it is within the choice of that Government, by its attitude towards the Treaty of Peace, to shorten the period of delay which the League of Nations, without any intention of prolonging it unduly, shall consider it necessary to fix.\n\nProvided these necessary conditions are assured, they see no reason why Germany should not become a member of the League in the early future.\n\nII\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers do not consider that an addition to the Covenant in the sense of the German proposals regarding economic questions is necessary. They would point out that the Covenant already provides that “subject to and in accordance with the provisions of international conventions existing or hereafter to be agreed upon, the Members of the League … will make provision to secure and maintain freedom of communications and of transit, and equitable treatment for the commerce of all Members of the League.” So soon as Germany is admitted to the League, she will enjoy the benefits of these provisions. The establishment of general conventions with regard to transit questions is now being considered.\n\n[Page 941]\n\nIII\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers are prepared to accord guarantees, under the protection of the League of Nations, for the educational, religious and cultural rights of German minorities in territories transferred from the German Empire to the new states created by the Treaty. They take note of the statement of the German Delegates that Germany is determined to treat foreign minorities within her territory according to the same principles.\n\nIV\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers have already pointed out to the German Delegates that the Covenant of the League of Nations provides for “the reduction of national armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety and the enforcement by common action of international obligations.” They recognise that the acceptance by Germany of the terms laid down for her own disarmament will facilitate and hasten the accomplishment of a general reduction of armaments; and they intend to open negotiations immediately with a view to the eventual adoption of a scheme of such general reduction. It goes without saying that the realisation of this programme will depend in large part on the satisfactory carrying out by Germany of her own engagements.\n\nparts ii and iii. boundaries of germany and political clauses for europe\n\nSection I. Belgium\n\nThe territories of Eupen and Malmedy were separated from the neighbouring Belgian lands of Limburg, Liège, and Luxemburg in 1814–15, when they were assigned to Prussia for making up the number of people on the Left Bank of the Rhine taken over as an offset for certain renunciations in Saxony. No account was taken of the desires of the people, nor of geographical or linguistic frontiers. Nevertheless, this region has continued in close economic and social relations with the adjacent portions of Belgium, and in spite of a century of Prussification the Walloon speech has maintained itself among several thousand of its inhabitants. At the same time the territory has been made a basis for German militarism by the construction of the great camp of Elsenborn and various strategic railways directed against Belgium. The reasons seem sufficient to justify the union of the territory to Belgium, provided the petitions to this effect are sufficiently supported by the population of the district. The Treaty [Page 942] makes provision for consulting the population under the auspices of the League of Nations.\n\nWith regard to the neutralized territory of Moresnet the sovereignty of which has been in dispute since 1815, the Prussians make a claim for which there appears to be no justification of any kind. The Treaty settles this dispute in favour of Belgium, and at the same time awards to Belgium, in partial compensation for the destruction of Belgian forests, the adjacent domanial and communal woods in Prussian Moresnet.\n\nSection II. Luxemburg\n\nThe observations of the German Delegation as to Luxemburg do not require any answer, as the clauses of the Treaty are justified by two uncontrovertible facts: the violation of the neutrality of the Grand Duchy by Germany during the war, and the denunciation of the Customs Union on which Luxemburg herself has decided and which she has communicated to the Allied and Associated Powers since the armistice.\n\nSection IV. Territory of the Saar Basin\n\nThe territory of the Saar basin has already been the subject of an exchange of notes with the German Delegation.13 The new observations contained in the German communication seem to show a complete misapprehension of the spirit and purpose of this section of the Treaty.\n\nThe purpose and decision of the Allies have twice been stated, first in the text of the Treaty itself, in which (Articles 45 and 46) Germany is to accept the provisions in question “as compensation for the destruction of the coal-mines in the North of France and as part payment towards the total reparation due from Germany for the damage resulting from the war, and … in order to assure the rights and welfare of the population”; and secondly, in the note of May 24th, “the Allied and Associated Governments have chosen this particular form of reparation because it was felt that the destruction of the mines in the North of France was an act of such a nature that a definite and exemplary retribution should be exacted; this object would not be obtained by the mere supply of a specified or unspecified amount of coal. This scheme, therefore, in its general provisions, must be maintained, and on this, the Allied and Associated Powers are not prepared to agree to any alternative.”\n\nThe German Delegation, on the other hand, declares that “the German Government refuses to carry out any reparation which will have the character of a punishment”. The German idea of justice appears [Page 943] then to be one which excludes a conception which is essential to any just settlement and a necessary basis for subsequent reconciliation.\n\nIt has been the desire of the Allied and Associated Powers in determining upon the form of reparation to be imposed to choose one which, by its exceptional nature, will be for a limited period a definite and visible symbol. At the same time, they intended, by assuring themselves of the immediate possession of a security for reparation, to escape the risks to which the German memoir itself has drawn attention.\n\nOn the other hand they have exercised the greatest care in order to avoid inflicting on the inhabitants of the district itself any material or moral injury. In every point their interests have been most scrupulously guarded, and in fact their condition will be improved.\n\nThe frontiers of the district have been precisely determined so as to secure the least possible interference with the present administrative units or with the daily vocations of this complex population. It is expressly provided that the whole system of administration of criminal and civil law and of taxation shall be maintained. The inhabitants are to retain their local assemblies, their religious liberties, their schools and the use of their language. All existing guarantees in favour of the working population are maintained, and new rules be in accordance with the principles adopted by the League of Nations. It is true that the Governing Commission, with which the final control rests, will not be directly responsible to a Parliamentary Assembly, but it will be responsible to the League of Nations and not to the French Government. The arrangement made will afford an ample guarantee against the misuse of the power which is entrusted to it; but, in addition, the Governing Commission is required to take the advice of the elected representatives of the district before any change in the laws can be made or any new tax imposed. The whole revenue derived from taxation will be devoted to local purposes and for the first time since the forcible annexation of this district to Prussia and to Bavaria, the people will live under a Government resident on the spot which will have no occupation and no interest except their welfare. The Allied and Associated Powers have full confidence that the inhabitants of the district will have no reason to regard the new administration under which they will be placed as one more remote than was the administration which was conducted from Berlin and Munich.\n\nThe German Note constantly overlooks the fact that the whole arrangement is temporary, and that at the end of 15 years the inhabitants will have a full and free right to choose the sovereignty under which they are to live.\n\n[Page 944]\n\nSection V. Alsace-Lorraine\n\nThe clauses concerning Alsace and Lorraine are but the application of the 8th of the 14 Points which Germany, at the time of the Armistice, accepted as the basis of Peace: “The wrong done by Prussia to France in 1871, as regards Alsace and Lorraine, which has disturbed the peace of the world for nearly 50 years must be righted, in order that peace may again be assured in the interest of all”.\n\nFifty years ago, the injustice consisted in the annexation of a French country against the will of its inhabitants, as unanimously expressed at Bordeaux by their elected representatives, reiterated in the Reichstag in 1874 and many times since by the election of protesting deputies and finally confirmed during the war by the special measures which Germany had to take against Alsatians and Lorrainers, both civilians and soldiers.\n\nTo right a wrong is to replace things, so far as possible, in the state in which they were before being disturbed by the wrong. All the Clauses of the Treaty concerning Alsace and Lorraine have this object in view. They will not, however, suffice to wipe out the sufferings of two Provinces which, for nearly half a century, have been for the Germans merely a “military glacis” and, according to the expression of Herr von Kühlmann, a means of “cementing” the unity of the Empire.\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers could not therefore admit a plebiscite for these Provinces. Germany, having accepted the 8th Point and signed the Armistice which places Alsace and Lorraine in the position of evacuated territories, has no right to demand a plebiscite. The population of Alsace and Lorraine has never asked for it. On the contrary it protested for nearly 50 years, at the cost of its own tranquility and its own interests, against the abuse of strength of which it was the victim in 1871. Its will is not therefore in doubt, and the Allied and Associated Governments mean to ensure respect for it.\n\nThe arguments, based on history and language, once more brought forward by Germany, are formally contested by the Allied and Associated Powers and do not modify their point of view.\n\nThe legal objections derived from the “ante-dated cession” are also inadmissible. Germany recognised this when she signed the Armistice. Moreover Alsace and Lorraine, by throwing themselves into the arms of France, as into those of a long-lost mother, themselves fixed the date of their deliverance. A Treaty founded on the right of self-determination of peoples cannot but take note of a people’s will so solemnly proclaimed.\n\nIn all its Clauses, whether they concern nationality, debts or State property, the Treaty has no other object than to restore persons and [Page 945] things to the legal position in which they were in 1871. The obligation of repairing the injustice then committed admits of no other alternative, and Germany herself has accepted this obligation in subscribing to the 14 Points.\n\nIt should be added that it is easy to justify the exception made in favour of France to the general principle admitted in the Treaty, according to which the State receiving territory takes over part of the public debt of the ceding State and pays for the property of the said State in the ceded territory. In 1871, Germany, when she seized Alsace and Lorraine, refused to take over any part of the French debt; she paid nothing for any French State property, and Herr von Bismarck boasted of this in the Reichstag on May 25th, 1871. Today the Allied and Associated Powers mean France to recover Alsace and Lorraine under exactly the same conditions, and consequently that she should take over no part of the German debt nor pay for any State property. This solution is just, for if German State property includes railways, the French owners of which Germany compensated in 1871 by sums drawn from the war indemnity, and if these railways have been developed since 1871, Germany on the contrary not having, at that time, assumed liability either for that portion of the French debt which belonged to Alsace and Lorraine or for the State property, the loss (capital and interest) imposed on France under this head exceeds the sum to which Germany makes a claim.\n\nAs regards the local debt of Alsace and Lorraine and of the public institutions of the Provinces which existed before August the 1st, 1914, it has always been understood between the Allied and Associated Governments that France should accept liability for them.\n\nSection VI. Austria\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers take note of the declaration in which Germany declares that she “has never had and will never have the intention of changing by violence the frontier between Germany and Austria”.\n\nSection VII. Poland\n\nIn dealing with the problem of the Eastern frontiers of Germany, it is desirable to place oil record two cardinal principles.\n\nFirst, there is imposed upon the Allies a special obligation to use the victory which they have won in order to re-establish the Polish Nation in the independence of which it was unjustly deprived more than one hundred years ago. This act was one of the greatest wrongs of which history has record, a crime the memory and the result of which has for long poisoned the political life of a large portion of the continent of Europe. The seizure of the Western provinces of Poland [Page 946] was one of the essential steps by which the military power of Prussia was built up, the necessity of holding fast these provinces has perverted the whole political life, first of Prussia and then of Germany. To undo this wrong is the first duty of the Allies, as has been proclaimed by them throughout the war, even when to some it might have appeared that the prospect of ultimate success was most remote; now that the victory has been won, the aim can be achieved. The restoration has already been spontaneously agreed to by the Russian Government; its attainment is ensured by the collapse of the Central Powers.\n\nThe second principle, which has been proclaimed by the Allies and formally accepted by Germany, is that there shall be included in the restored Poland those districts which are now inhabited by an indisputably Polish population.\n\nThese are the principles which have guided the Allies in determining the Eastern frontiers of Germany, and the Conditions of Peace have been drawn up in strict accordance with them.\n\nposen and west prussia\n\nIn the Western portions of the former Kingdom of Poland which are now included in the Prussian Provinces of Posen and West Prussia, the application of the second principle only to a very small degree modifies that of the first. When the partition took place these portions of Poland were predominantly inhabited by Poles; except in some towns and districts to which German colonists had made their way, the country was completely Polish in speech and sentiment. Had the Allied and Associated Powers applied the strict law of historic retribution, they would have been justified in restoring to Poland these two provinces almost in their entirety. They have in fact not done so; they have deliberately waived the claim of historic right because they wished to avoid even the appearance of injustice, and they have left to Germany those districts on the West in which there is an undisputed German predominance in immediate contiguity to German territory.\n\nApart from these districts it is true that there are certain areas, often far removed from the German frontier, such as Bromberg, in which there is a majority of Germans. It would be impossible to draw a frontier in such a way that these areas should be left to Germany while the surrounding purely Polish areas were included in Poland. There must be some sacrifice on one side or the other. If this is once recognised, there can be no doubt as to who has the prior claim to consideration. Numerous as the Germans in these districts may be, the number of Poles concerned is greater; to have left these districts to Germany would be to sacrifice the majority to the minority. [Page 947] Moreover, it is necessary to recall the methods by which German preponderance in certain districts has been established. German settlers, German colonists, German residents have not come here merely in obedience to natural causes. Their presence is the direct result of the policy pursued by the Prussian Government, which has used all its immense resources to dispossess the original population and substitute for it one of German speech and German nationality. This process has been continued to the very eve of the war with exceptional harshness, and has called forth protests even in Germany itself. To recognise that such action should give a permanent title to the country would be to give an encouragement and premium to the grossest acts of injustice and opposition.\n\nIn order to eliminate any possible injustice the Allied and Associated Powers have caused the Western frontiers of Poland to be carefully reconsidered; as a result of this they have made certain modifications in detail with the object of bringing the frontier into closer harmony with the ethnographical division; the result of these changes will be on the whole to diminish the number of Germans who are included in Poland. In particular, the Allied and Associated Powers have determined to adhere strictly to the historical frontier between Pomerania and West Prussia, so that here no part of Germany outside the former Kingdom of Poland shall be assigned to Poland. It is not certain that these changes will be practical improvements; the closer adherence to the ethnic line may produce some local inconvenience.\n\nupper silesia\n\nA considerable portion of the German answer is devoted to the question of Upper Silesia. It is recognised that the problem here differs from that in Posen and West Prussia for the reason that Upper Silesia was not a part of the Polish territories when dismembered by the Partition. It may be said that Poland has no legal claim to the cession of Upper Silesia: it is emphatically not true that she has no claim which could be supported on the principles of President Wilson. In the district to be ceded, the majority of the population is indisputably Polish. Every German book of reference, every school-book, teaches the German child that the inhabitants are Polish in origin and in speech. The Allied and Associated Powers would have been acting in complete violation of the principles which the German Government itself professes to accept had they left unregarded the Polish claims to this district.\n\nHowever the German Government now contest these conclusions. They insist that separation from Germany is not in accordance with the wishes or the interests of the population. Under these circumstances the Allied and Associated Powers are willing to allow the [Page 948] question to be determined by those particularly concerned. They have therefore decided that this territory shall not be immediately ceded to Poland, but that arrangements shall be made to hold a plebiscite there.\n\nThey would gladly have avoided this, for the appeal must be postponed for some considerable time. It will involve the temporary occupation of the district by foreign troops. In order to secure the full impartiality of the vote, it will be necessary to establish a separate Commission to administer the territory during the intervening period.\n\nMoreover, in order to prevent Germany from being deprived arbitrarily of materials necessary for her industrial life, an additional Article has been included in the Treaty providing that mineral products, including coal, produced in any part of Upper Silesia that may be transferred, shall be available for purchase by Germany on the same terms as by the Poles themselves.\n\nIn order further to meet any criticism regarding the consequences of the transfer of territory to Poland, the Allied and Associated Powers have introduced a new provision, described below in the paragraphs on Property, Rights and Interests, the effect of which will be to give protection to Germans in any liquidation of their property.\n\nThe restoration of the Polish State is a great historical act which cannot be achieved without breaking many ties and causing temporary difficulty and distress to many individuals. But it has been the special concern of the Allied and Associated Powers to provide for the adequate protection of those Germans who will find themselves transferred to Poland, as well as of all other religious, racial or linguistic minorities. There is in the Treaty a clause by which there will be secured to them the enjoyment of religious liberty and also the right to use their own language and that of having their children educated in their own language. They will not be subjected to persecution similar to that which Poles had to endure from the Prussian State.\n\nSection IX. East Prussia\n\nThe German Government declares that it cannot accept a solution by which East Prussia shall be separated from the rest of Germany. It must, therefore, be recalled that East Prussia was in fact so separated for many hundreds of years, and that at no date until 1866 was it actually included in the political frontiers of Germany; it has always been recognised by German historians as being not an original German land, but a German colony. It is no doubt for the convenience of Germany that this country, which has been conquered and wrested from its original inhabitants by the German sword, should be in direct contact with the true Germany, but the convenience of [Page 949] Germany is no reason why the dismemberment and partition of another nation should be continued. Moreover, the interests which the Germans in East Prussia, who number less than two millions, have in establishing a land connection with Germany, is much less vital than the interest of the whole Polish nation in securing direct access to the sea.\n\nThe larger part of the trade of East Prussia with the rest of Germany is sea-borne; for the commercial life of the province it will matter little that West Prussia is restored to Poland, but for Poland immediate and unbroken communication with Danzig and the remainder of the coast by railways which are entirely under the control of the Polish State is essential. The inconvenience caused to East Prussia by the new frontiers is negligible compared to that which would be caused to Poland by any other arrangement.\n\nBut in addition the importance of the railway connection between East Prussia and Germany has been fully recognised in the Treaty, and Articles dealing with this have been inserted. They have now been carefully revised, and they provide the fullest security that there shall be no impediment placed in the way of communication across the intervening Polish territory.\n\nIt is difficult to understand the objections raised by the Germans to the plebiscite which is to be held in certain portions of East Prussia. According to all information, there is in the Allenstein district a considerable Polish majority. The German note states, on the other hand, that it is not inhabited by an incontestably Polish population and suggests that the Poles will not wish to be separated from Germany. It is precisely because there may be some doubt as to the political leanings of the inhabitants that the Allied and Associated Powers have determined to hold a plebiscite here. Where the affinities of the population are undoubted, there is no necessity for a plebiscite; where they are in doubt, there a plebiscite is enjoined. It is noted with surprise that the Germans at the very moment when they profess assent to the principle of self-determination, refuse to accept the most obvious means of applying it.\n\nSection X. Memel\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers reject the suggestion that the cession of the district of Memel conflicts with the principle of nationality. The district in question has always been Lithuanian; the majority of the population is Lithuanian in origin and in speech; and the fact that the city of Memel itself is in large part German is no justification for maintaining the district under German sovereignty, particularly in view of the fact that the port of Memel is the only sea outlet for Lithuania.\n\n[Page 950]\n\nIt has been decided that Memel and the adjoining district shall be transferred to the Allied and Associated Powers for the reason that the status of the Lithuanian territories is not yet established.\n\nSection XI. Danzig\n\nThe German note declares that the German Government “must reject the proposed rape of Danzig and must insist that Danzig and its environs be left to the German Empire”. The use of this language seems to show some want of appreciation of the true situation. The proposed settlement for Danzig has been drawn up with the most scrupulous care and will preserve the character which Danzig held during many centuries and, indeed, until forcibly and contrary to the will of the inhabitants it was annexed to the Prussian State. The population of Danzig is and has for long been predominantly German; just for this reason, it is not proposed to incorporate it in Poland. But Danzig, when a Hansa city, like many other Hansa cities, lay outside the political frontiers of Germany, and in union with Poland enjoyed a large measure of local independence and great commercial prosperity. It will now be replaced in a position similar to that which it held for so many centuries. The economic interests of Danzig and Poland are identical. For Danzig as the great port of the valley of the Vistula, the most intimate connection with Poland is essential. The annexation of West Prussia, including Danzig, to Germany, deprived Poland of that direct access to the sea which was hers by right. The Allied and Associated Powers propose that this direct access shall be restored. It is not enough that Poland should be allowed the use of German ports; the coast, short as it is, which is Polish must be restored to her. Poland claims, and justly claims, that the control and development of the port which is her sole opening to the sea shall be in her hands and that the communications between it and Poland shall not be subjected to any foreign control, so that in this, one of the most important aspects of national life, Poland should be put on an equality with the other States of Europe.\n\nSection XII. Schleswig\n\nSchleswig was taken from Denmark by Prussia in 1864 but by the Treaty of Prague in 186614 Prussia undertook that the northern districts should be ceded to Denmark if by a free vote the population expressed a wish to be united to Denmark. In spite of repeated demands on the part of the inhabitants, no measures have ever been taken by Prussia or the German Empire to carry out this promise, and the Government of Denmark and the people of Schleswig have now asked [Page 951] the Peace Conference to secure for them a plebiscite. This the present Treaty now guarantees. At the request of the Danish Government provisions have been drawn up for the evacuation of the territory as far as the Rider and the Schlei by the German troops and the higher Prussian officials, and for the temporary administration of the territory and the holding of the plebiscite by an impartial International Commission, on which Norway and Sweden will be represented as well as the Allied and Associated Powers. In consequence of a request made by the Danish Government it has been decided to alter the limits of the territory within which the plebiscite will be held in accordance with their wishes. On the basis of the plebiscite which will be held there, the international commission will propose a precise delimitation of the frontier between Germany and Denmark, a delimitation in which geographic and economic conditions will be taken into account.\n\nSection XIII. Heligoland\n\nAs regards Heligoland, while accepting the dismantling of the fortifications the German Delegates observe that—\n\nA Commission will be appointed by the Principal Allied and Associated Powers, after the signature of the Treaty, to supervise the destruction of the fortifications. This Commission will decide what portion of the works protecting the coast from sea erosion can be allowed to remain and what portion must be destroyed as a precaution against the refortification of the island.\n\nThe only harbours it is proposed to destroy are the naval harbours within the positions given in Article 115; the fishing harbour is not within this area, and the naval harbours are not used by fishing vessels. The Article must accordingly be accepted unconditionally.\n\nSection XIV. Russia\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers are of opinion that none of the reservations or the observations offered by the German Delegation as to Russia necessitate any change in the relevant articles of the Treaty.\n\npart iv. german rights and interests outside germany\n\nI\n\nIn requiring Germany to renounce all her rights and claims to her overseas possessions, the Allied and Associated Powers placed before every other consideration the interests of the native populations advocated [Page 952] by President Wilson in the fifth point of his Fourteen Points mentioned in his Address of the 8th January, 1918. Reference to the evidence from German sources previous to the war of an official as well as of a private character, and to the formal charges made in the Reichstag, especially by MM. Erzberger and Noske, will suffice to throw full light upon the German colonial administration, upon the cruel methods of repression, the arbitrary requisition, and the various forms of forced labour which resulted in the depopulation of vast expanses of territory in German East Africa and the Cameroons, not to mention the tragic fate of the Hereros in South West Africa, which is well known to all.\n\nGermany’s dereliction in the sphere of colonial civilisation has been revealed too completely to admit of the Allied and Associated Powers consenting to make a second experiment and of their assuming the responsibility of again abandoning thirteen or fourteen millions of natives to a fate from which the war has delivered them.\n\nMoreover, the Allied and Associated Powers felt themselves compelled to safeguard their own security and the Peace of the world against a military imperialism, which sought to establish bases whence it could pursue a policy of interference and intimidation against the other Powers.\n\nII\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers considered that the loss of her Colonies would not hinder Germany’s normal economic development.\n\nThe trade of the German Colonies has never represented more than a very small fraction of Germany’s total trade; in 1913 one-half of one per cent of her imports and one-half of one per cent of her exports. Of the total volume imported by Germany of such products as cotton, cocoa, rubber, palm kernels, tobacco, jute and copra, only 3 per cent came from her Colonies. It is obvious that the financial, commercial and industrial rehabilitation of Germany must depend on other factors.\n\nFor climatic reasons and other natural causes the German Colonies are incapable of accommodating more than a very small proportion of the excess German emigration. The small number of colonists resident there before the war is conclusive evidence in this respect.\n\nIII\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers have drawn up, in the matter of the cession of the German Colonies, the following methods of procedure, which are in conformity with the rules of International Law and Equity:\n\n(a)\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers are applying to the German [Page 953] Colonies the general principle in accordance with which the transfer of sovereignty involves the transfer under the same conditions to the State to which the surrender is made of the immovable and movable property of the ceding State.\n\nThey see no reason for consenting in the case of the Colonies to any departure from that principle which may have been admitted as an exceptional measure in the case of territory in Europe.\n\n(b)\n\nThey are of opinion that the Colonies should not bear any portion of the German debt, nor remain under any obligation to refund to Germany the expenses incurred by the Imperial administration of the Protectorate. In fact, they consider that it would be unjust to burden the natives with expenditure which appears to have been incurred in Germany’s own interest, and that it would be no less unjust to make this responsibility rest upon the Mandatory Powers, which, in so far as they may be appointed Trustees by the League of Nations, will derive no benefit from such Trusteeship.\n\nIV\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers considered that it would be necessary in the interest of the natives, as well as in that of general peace, to restrict the influence which Germany might seek to exert over her former Colonies and over the territories of the Allied and Associated Powers.\n\n(a)\n\nThey are obliged for the reasons of security already mentioned to reserve to themselves full liberty of action in determining the conditions on which Germans will be allowed to establish themselves in the territories of the former German Colonies. Moreover, the control to be exercised by the League of Nations will provide all the necessary guarantees.\n\n(b)\n\nThey require Germany to subscribe to the Conventions which they may conclude for the control of the traffic in Arms and Spirits and for the modification of the General Acts of Berlin15 and Brussels.16 They do not think that Germany has any ground to consider herself humiliated or injured because she is required to give her consent in advance to medsures accepted by all the great commercial Powers in regard to questions of such great importance to the welfare of the native populations and to the maintenance of civilisation and peace.\n\nV\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers consider that all the possessions and property of the German State in the territory of Kiaochow must [Page 954] be treated on the same footing as State property in all the other German overseas possessions, and be transferred without compensation. In this connection they recall the fact that Kiaochow, which was unjustly torn from China, has been used by Germany as a military base in pursuance of a policy which in its various manifestations has constituted a perpetual menace to the peace of the Far East. In these circumstances they see no reason why Germany should be compensated for the loss of works and establishments and in general for public property which in the hands of this Power have for the most part been used merely as a means of carrying out its policy of aggression.\n\nIn so far as concerns the railway and the mines that go with it, referred to in Article 156, para. 2, the Allied and Associated Powers hold that these should be considered as public property. They would, however, be prepared, in the event of Germany adducing proof to the contrary, to apply to such private rights as German nationals may be able to establish in the matter, the general principles laid down in the Conditions of Peace in respect of compensation of this character.\n\nVI\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers are anxious that no misunderstanding should exist with regard to the disposition of the property of German missions in territory belonging to them or of which the government is entrusted to them in accordance with the Treaty. They have, therefore, explicitly stated that the property of these missions will be handed over to boards of trustees appointed by or approved by the Governments and composed of persons holding the faith of the mission whose property is involved.\n\npart v. military, naval and air clauses\n\nSection I. Military Clauses\n\nI\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers wish to make it clear that their requirements in regard to German armaments were not made solely with the object of rendering it impossible for Germany to resume her policy of military aggression. They are also the first steps towards that general reduction and limitation of armaments which they seek to bring about as one of the most fruitful preventives of war, and which it will be one of the first duties of the League of Nations to promote.\n\n[Page 955]\n\nII\n\nThey must point out, however, that the colossal growth in armaments of the last few decades was forced upon the nations of Europe by Germany. As Germany increased her power, her neighbours had to follow suit unless they were to become impotent to resist German dictation or the German sword. It is therefore right, as it is necessary, that the process of limitation of armaments should begin with the nation which has been responsible for their expansion. It is not until the aggressor has led the way that the attacked can safely afford to follow suit.\n\nIII\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers cannot agree to any alteration in principle of the conditions laid down in Articles 159–180, 203–208 and 211–213 of the Treaty.\n\nGermany must consent unconditionally to disarm in advance of the Allied and Associated Powers; she must agree to immediate abolition of universal military service; a definite organisation and scale of armament must be enforced. It is essential that she should be subjected to special control as regards the reduction of her armies and armaments, the dismantling of her fortifications, and the reduction, conversion or destruction of her military establishments.\n\nIV\n\nWhilst the Allied and Associated Powers regard the strict maintenance of these principles as a sacred duty and refuse in any way to depart from them, they are nevertheless willing in the interests of general peace and the welfare of the German people to admit the following modifications of the Military Clauses, Articles 159–180 of the Treaty:\n\n(a)\n\nGermany will be allowed to reduce her Army more gradually than at present stipulated, i. e. to a maximum of 200,000 men within 3 months; at the end of that 3 months and every subsequent 3 months a Conference of Military experts of the Allied and Associated Powers shall fix the strength of the German Army for the coming three months, the object being to reduce the German Army to the 100,000 men stipulated in the Treaty as soon as possible, and in any case by the expiration of the Law of the Reichswehr, i. e. by 31st March 1920.\n\n(b)\n\nThe number of formations, officers or persons in the position of officers, and civilian personnel shall be in the same ratio to the total effectives laid down in (a) above as that laid down in the Treaty.\n\nSimilarly, the number of guns, machine guns, trench mortars, rifles, and the amount of ammunition and equipment shall bear the same [Page 956] ratio to the total amount allowed in (a) above as that laid down in the Treaty.\n\n(c)\n\nNo deviation from the organisation in Armament laid down in the present Treaty can be permitted until Germany is admitted to the League of Nations, which may then agree to such modifications as seem desirable.\n\n(d)\n\nAll the remaining German war material shall be handed over in the period fixed by the Treaty.\n\nThe periods laid down in the Treaty for the demolition of fortifications will be modified as follows:—\n\nV\n\nWith the amendments and modifications enumerated in paragraph IV above, the Military Clauses (Articles 159–180) and those affecting the carrying out of the terms therein laid down (Articles 203–208 and 211–213) are to be maintained.\n\nSection II. Naval Clauses\n\nThe conditions and proposals of the German Delegates relative to the Naval Clauses cannot be entertained. All these Articles have been carefully framed and must be accepted unconditionally. They are based on the desire for a general limitation of the armaments of all nations and at the same time leave to Germany the requisite naval force for self-protection and police duties.\n\nNo negotiations are necessary with regard to this portion of the Treaty, prior to its signature. All details can be settled by the Naval Commission to be appointed subsequently in accordance with Section IV of Part V.\n\nThere are no financial measures contemplated by the Allied and Associated Powers in connection with the surrender of any of the warships mentioned in the draft Treaty; they are required to be handed over unconditionally.\n\n[Page 957]\n\npart vi. prisoners of war\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers have nothing to add to their note of May 20, 1919 on this subject.17\n\npart vii\n\nI. The Responsibility of Germany for the War\n\nThe German Delegation have submitted a lengthy Memorandum in regard to the responsibility of Germany for the initiation of the war.18 The burden of the argument in this document is that at the very last moment of the crisis the German Government endeavoured to induce moderation on the part of an ally to whom she had previously given complete liberty of action, and that it was the mobilisation of the Russian army which finally made inevitable the outbreak of the general war.\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers, however, wish to make it clear that their view as to the responsibility for the war is not based merely upon an analysis of the events which took place in the last critical hours of the crisis which preceded the actual outbreak of hostilities. They note that the German memorandum is largely occupied with the discussion of one aspect of the European situation in the years preceding the outbreak of the war. The observations contained in it and the documents quoted will no doubt afford valuable material for the historian of the future but they cannot see that any new facts are brought to light or that any new interpretation is given of facts already known which would in the least modify the conclusions already arrived at. They are the more inclined to take this view as they observe that there are considerable discrepancies between the three versions of this document which they have received. There is nothing in it which shakes their conviction that the immediate cause of the war was the decision, deliberately taken by those responsible for German policy in Berlin and their confederates in Vienna and Budapest, to impose a solution of a European question upon the nations of Europe by threat of war and, if the other members of the concert refused this dictation, by war itself instantly declared.\n\nThe German memorandum indeed admits without reserve the accuracy of this view. The Serbian question was not, and never could have been, purely an Austro-Hungarian question. It affected Germany. It affected all the Great Powers. It was essentially a European question, for it involved the control of the Balkans, and therefore concerned the peace, not only of the Balkans, but of the whole of Europe. [Page 958] It was impossible to isolate it and the authors of the ultimatum of July 23 knew that it could not be isolated.\n\nIf, therefore, the German and Austro-Hungarian Governments had desired a pacific settlement, they would have consulted with the other Powers whose interests were vitally affected, and only taken action after making the utmost endeavour to arrive at an agreed solution. Yet the Memorandum of the German Delegation explicitly admits that the German Government authorised its ally to endeavour to solve the Austro-Serbian question on its own initiative and by war. “On the strength”, it says, “of statements received from the Cabinet in Vienna, the German Government considered an Austrian military expedition against Serbia essential for the preservation of peace. The German Government considered itself obliged to take the risk of Russian intervention with the resultant casus foederis. She gave her ally Austria a completely free hand as to the nature of the demands to be made by her on Serbia. When the ultimatum was followed by an answer which appeared to Germany herself sufficient to justify the abandonment of the expedition after all, she indicated this view to Vienna”.\n\nThe later action of the German Government was perfectly consistent with this initial policy. It supported the rejection, without consideration, of the extraordinary concessions made by Serbia in response to the insolent and intolerable demands of the Austro-Hungarian Government. It supported the mobilisation of the Austro-Hungarian army and the initiation of hostilities, and steadily rejected every proposal for conference, conciliation or mediation, though it knew that once mobilisation and military action were undertaken by any of the Great Powers it inevitably compelled a response from all the rest and so hourly reduced the chances of pacific settlement. Only at the eleventh hour, when all chance of avoiding war had practically vanished, did the German Government counsel moderation on her ally. Even on this single point in Germany’s favour, the Memorandum of the German Delegates is forced to admit a doubt. “The reason”, it says, “for the delay in the reply of the Cabinet at Vienna to this proposal is not known to us”, and then they go on to say in words which are underlined, “This is one of the most vital points which still require elucidation”. May it not be that, as was not uncommon with the German Foreign Office, unofficial communications or a previous understanding between those who had the real power, differed somewhat from the messages which travelled over the official wires.\n\nThe German Government would now throw the blame for the failure of the attempts to procure peace on the mobilisation of the Russian army. They ignore that this was the immediate and necessary consequence of the mobilisation of the Austrian army, and the declaration [Page 959] of war on Serbia, both authorised by Germany. These were the fatal acts by which the decision was taken out of the hands of the statesmen and control transferred to the military. It is on the German statesmen that equally rests the responsibility for the hasty declaration of war on Russia, when Austria herself was apparently hesitating, and for the declaration of war on France. So great was the haste of the German Government that when no plausible reason could be found, allegations were invented, the complete falsity of which has long ago been demonstrated. The German Delegation now admits that the German Government “did not take the trouble to verify” the reported facts which they published as justifying their declaration of war.\n\nAfter reading what the German Delegation has to say in self-defence, the Allied and Associated Powers are satisfied that the series of events which caused the outbreak of the war was deliberately plotted and executed by those who wielded the supreme power in Vienna, Budapest, and Berlin.\n\nThe history of the critical days of July 1914, however, is not the sole ground upon which the Allied and Associated Powers consider that the responsibility of Germany for the war must be tried. The outbreak of the war was no sudden decision taken in a difficult crisis. It was the logical outcome of the policy which had been pursued for decades by Germany under the inspiration of the Prussian system.\n\nThe whole history of Prussia has been one of domination, aggression and war. Hypnotised by the success with which Bismarck, following the tradition of Frederick the Great, robbed the neighbours of Prussia and forged the unity of Germany through blood and iron, the German people after 1871 submitted practically without reserve to the inspiration and the leadership of their Prussian rulers.\n\nThe Prussian spirit was not content that Germany should occupy a great and influential place in a Council of equal nations to which she was entitled, and which she had secured. It could be satisfied with nothing less than supreme and autocratic power. At a time, therefore, when the western nations were seriously endeavouring to limit armaments, to substitute friendship for rivalry in international affairs, and to lay the foundation of a new era in which all nations should cooperate in amity in the conduct of the world’s affairs, the rulers of Germany were restlessly sowing suspicion and hostility among all her neighbours, were conspiring with every element of unrest in every land, and were steadily increasing Germany’s armaments and consolidating her military and naval power. They mobilised all the resources at their command, the universities, the press, the pulpit, the whole machinery of governmental authority to indoctrinate their gospel of hatred and force, so that when the time came the German people might [Page 960] respond to their call. As a result in the later years of the 19th century, and during the 20th century, the whole policy of Germany was bent towards securing for herself a position from which she could dominate and dictate.\n\nIt is said that Germany developed her armaments in order to save herself from Russian aggression. Yet it is significant that no sooner was Russia defeated by Japan in the Far East and almost paralysed by the subsequent internal revolution than the German Government immediately redoubled its attempts to increase its armaments and to domineer over its neighbours under the threat of war. To them the collapse of Russia was not an occasion to try to reduce armaments and bring peace to the world in concert with the Western Powers. It was the opportunity to extend their own power. Further the whole point of German organisation was aggressive. Their scheme of railways, both east and west, their order of mobilisation, their long concocted plan to turn the flank of France by invading Belgium, the elaborate preparation and equipment, both within and beyond her borders, as revealed on the outbreak of the war,—all had aggression and not defence in view. The military doctrine that Germany could only be defended by springing first upon her neighbours was the excuse for demanding a military organisation and a strategic plan which, when the time came, would enable them to smash all resistance to the ground and leave Germany the undisputed master both in the East and the West.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this Memorandum to traverse the diplomatic history of the years preceding the war, or to show how it was that the peace-loving nations of Western Europe were gradually driven, under a series of crises provoked from Berlin, to come together in self-defence. Autocratic Germany, under the inspiration of her rulers, was bent on domination. The nations of Europe were determined to preserve their liberty. It was the fear of the rulers of Germany lest their plans for universal domination should be brought to naught by the rising tide of democracy, that drove them to endeavour to overcome all resistance at one stroke by plunging Europe in universal war. The view of the Allied and Associated Powers could not indeed be better expressed than in the words of the German Memorandum itself: “The real mistakes of German policy lay much further back. The German Chancellor who was in office in 1914 had taken over a political inheritance which either condemned as hopeless from the start his unreservedly honest attempt to relieve the tension of the internal situation, or else demanded therefor a degree of statesmanship, and above all a strength of decision, which on the one hand he did not sufficiently possess, and on the other, he could not make effective in the then existing conditions of German policy.”\n\n[Page 961]\n\nIn the view, therefore, of the Allied and Associated Powers Germany’s responsibility is far wider and far more terrible than that to which the Memorandum of the German Delegation would seek to confine it. Germany, under the inspiration of Prussia, has been the champion of force and violence, deception, intrigue and cruelty in the conduct of international affairs. Germany for decades has steadily pursued a policy of inspiring jealousies and hatred and of dividing nation from nation in order that she might gratify her own selfish passion for power. Germany has stood athwart the whole current of democratic progress and international friendships throughout the world. Germany has been the principal mainstay of autocracy in Europe. And in the end, seeing that she could attain her objects in no other way, she planned and started the war which caused the massacre and mutilation of millions and the ravaging of Europe from end to end.\n\nThe truth of the charges thus brought against them the German people have admitted by their own revolution. They have overturned their Government because they have discovered that it is the enemy of freedom, justice and equality at home. That same Government was no less the enemy of freedom, justice and equality abroad. It is useless to attempt to prove that it was less violent and arrogant and tyrannical in its foreign than it was in its internal policy, or that the responsibility for the terrible events of the last five years does not lie at its doors.\n\nII. Penalties\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers have given consideration to the observations of the German Delegation in regard to the trial of those chargeable with grave offences against international morality, the sanctity of treaties and the most essential rules of justice. They must repeat what they have said in the letter covering this Memorandum, that they regard this war as a crime deliberately plotted against the life and liberties of the peoples of Europe. It is a war which has brought death and mutilation to millions and has left all Europe in terrible suffering. Starvation, unemployment, disease stalk across that continent from end to end, and for decades its peoples will groan under the burdens and disorganisation the war has caused. They therefore regard the punishment of those responsible for bringing these calamities on the human race as essential on the score of justice.\n\nThey think it not less necessary as a deterrent to others who, at some later date, may be tempted to follow their example. The present Treaty is intended to mark a departure from the traditions and practices of earlier settlements which have been singularly inadequate in preventing the renewal of war. The Allied and Associated Powers [Page 962] indeed consider that the trial and punishment of those proved most responsible for the crimes and inhuman acts committed in connection with a war of aggression, is inseparable from the establishment of that reign of law among nations which it was the agreed object of the peace to set up.\n\nAs regards the German contention that a trial of the accused by tribunals appointed by the Allied and Associated Powers would be a one-sided and inequitable proceeding, the Allied and Associated Powers consider that it is impossible to entrust in any way the trial of those directly responsible for offences against humanity and international right to their accomplices in their crimes. Almost the whole world has banded itself together in order to bring to naught the German plan of conquest and dominion. The tribunals they will establish will therefore represent the deliberate judgment of the greater part of the civilised world. They cannot entertain the proposal to admit to the tribunal the representatives of countries which have taken no part in the war. The Allied and Associated Powers are prepared to stand by the verdict of history as to the impartiality and justice with which the accused will be tried.\n\nFinally, they wish to make it clear that the public arraignment under Article 227 framed against the German ex-Emperor has not a juridical character as regards its substance but only in its form. The ex-Emperor is arraigned as a matter of high international policy, as the minimum of what is demanded for a supreme offence against international morality, the sanctity of treaties and the essential rules of justice. The Allied and Associated Powers have desired that judicial forms, a judicial procedure and a regularly constituted tribunal should be set up in order to assure to the accused full rights and liberties in regard to his defence, and in order that the judgment should be of the most solemn judicial character.\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers add that they are prepared to submit a final list of those who must be handed over to justice within one month of the coming into force of the Treaty.\n\npart viii. reparation\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers, consistently with their policy already expressed, decline to enter into a discussion of the principles underlying the Reparation Clauses of the Conditions of Peace, which have been prepared with scrupulous regard for the correspondence leading up to the Armistice of November 11th, 1918, the final memorandum of which, dated 5th November, 1918, contains the following words:\n\nTo the extent that the German reply deals with practical phases of the execution of the principles enunciated in the Conditions of Peace, it appears to proceed on the basis of a complete misapprehension, which is the more difficult to understand as the inferences drawn and the statements made are wholly at variance with both the letter and the spirit of the Treaty Clauses. For purposes of clarification, however, and in order that there may be no possible ground for misunderstanding, the Allied and Associated Powers submit the following observations:\n\nThe vast extent and manifold character of the damage caused to the Allied and Associated Powers in consequence of the war has created a reparation problem of extraordinary magnitude and complexity, only to be solved by a continuing body, limited in personnel and invested with broad powers to deal with the problem in relation to the general economic situation.\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers, recognising this situation, themselves delegate power and authority to a Reparation Commission. This Reparation Commission is, however, instructed by the Treaty itself so to exercise and interpret its powers as to ensure, in the interest of all, an early and complete discharge by Germany of her reparation obligations. It is also instructed to take into account the true maintenance of the social, economic and financial structure of a Germany earnestly striving to exercise her full power to repair the loss and damage she has caused.\n\nThe provisions of Article 241, by which the German Government is to invest itself with such powers as may be needed to carry out its obligations, are not to be misconstrued as giving the Commission powers to dictate the domestic legislation of Germany. Nor does paragraph 12 (b) of Annex II give the Commission powers to prescribe or enforce taxes or to dictate the character of the German budget.\n\nIt is only to examine the latter for two specified purposes.\n\nThis is necessary in order that it may intelligently and constructively exercise the discretion accorded to it in Germany’s interest, particularly by Article 234, with regard to extending the date and modifying the form of payments. The provisions of Article 240 with regard to the supply of information are similar in character and purpose, and there should be little occasion for the exercise of these powers when once the amount of the liability of Germany is fixed, [Page 964] if Germany is in a position to, and does, comply with the schedule of payments which then will have been notified to her and with the specific provisions of the several Annexes relative to reparation in kind. It is further to be observed that the power of modification accorded by the said Article 236 [234] is expressly designed to permit of a modification in Germany’s interest of a schedule of payments which events may demonstrate to be beyond Germany’s reasonable capacity.\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers vigorously reject the suggestion that the Commission, in exercising the power conferred by Article 240 and by paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of Annex IV, might require the divulgence of trade secrets and similar confidential data.\n\nIn short the observations of the German Delegation present a view of this Commission so distorted and so inexact that it is difficult to believe that the clauses of the Treaty have been calmly or carefully examined. It is not an engine of oppression or a device for interfering with German sovereignty. It has no forces at its command; it has no executive powers within the territory of Germany; it cannot, as is suggested, direct or control the educational or other systems of the country. Its business is to fix what is to be paid; to satisfy itself that Germany can pay; and to report to the Powers, whose Delegation it is, in case Germany makes default. If Germany raises the money required in her own way, the Commission cannot order that it shall be raised in some other way; if Germany offers payment in kind, the Commission may accept such payment, but, except as specified in the Treaty itself, the Commission cannot require such a payment.\n\nThe German Observations appear to miss the point that the Commission is directed to study the German system of taxation for the protection of the German people no less than for the protection of their own. Such study is not inquisitorial, for the German system of taxation is not an object of curiosity to other Powers, nor is a knowledge of it an end in itself; but if any plea of inability which the German Government may advance is to be properly considered, such a study is necessary.\n\nThe Commission must test whether a sincere application is being given to the principle, accepted in the Observations, “that the German taxation system should impose in general on the taxpayer at least as great a burden as that prevailing in the most heavily burdened of the States represented on the Reparation Commission”. If the German resources are to be properly weighed, the first subject of inquiry will be the German fiscal burden.\n\nIt is understood that the action necessary to give effect to the provisions of Annex IV, relative to reparation in kind, will be taken by Germany on its own initiative, after receipt of notification from the Reparation Commission.\n\n[Page 965]\n\nThe provisions of the Treaty are in no wise incompatible with the creation by Germany of a Commission which will represent Germany in dealings with the Reparation Commission and which will constitute an instrumentality for such co-operation as may be necessary. The Treaty specifically and repeatedly provides opportunities for the German Government to present facts and arguments with respect to claims and modes of payment, within the limits of the principles and express provisions of the Treaty. This may be done through a commission and no reason is perceived why such a commission could not work in harmony with the Reparation Commission. Certainly this is greatly to be desired. The Allied and Associated Powers are therefore ready to agree to such a procedure as the following:\n\nImmediately after the Treaty is signed, Germany may present, and the Allied and Associated Powers will receive and examine, such evidence, estimates and arguments as she may think fit to present. Such documents need not be final but may be presented to the Commission subject to corrections and additions.\n\nAt any time within four months of the signature of the Treaty, Germany shall be at liberty to submit, and the Allied and Associated Powers will receive and consider, such proposals as Germany may choose to make. In particular, proposals will be received on the following subjects and for the following purposes. Germany may offer a lump sum in settlement of her whole liability, as defined in Article 232, or in settlement of her liability under any of the particular categories which have been decided upon and laid down. Germany may offer, either to carry out by her own means the restoration, and reconstruction, whether in part or in its entirety, of one of the devastated areas, or to repair under the same conditions certain classes [of] damage in particular regions or in all the regions which have suffered from the war. Germany may offer labour, materials or technical service for use in such work, even though she does not execute the work herself. She may suggest any practicable plan, category by category or for the reparations as a whole, which will tend to shorten the period of enquiry and to bring about a prompt and effectual conclusion.\n\nWithout making further specifications, it may be said in a word that Germany is at liberty to make any suggestion or offer of a practical and reasonable character for the purposes of simplifying the assessment of the damage, eliminating any question or questions from the scope of the detailed enquiry, promoting the performance of the work and accelerating the definition of the ultimate amount to be paid.\n\nThe necessary facilities for making reliable estimates of the offers to be presented by her will be afforded to Germany at reasonable times. Three conditions only are imposed upon the tender of these proposals. [Page 966] Firstly, the German authorities will be expected before making such proposals to confer with the representatives of the Powers directly concerned. Secondly, such offers must be unambiguous, and must be precise and clear. Thirdly, they must accept the categories and the reparation clauses as matters settled beyond discussion. The Allied and Associated Powers will not entertain arguments or appeals directed to any alteration.\n\nWithin two months thereafter, the Allied and Associated Powers will, so far as may be possible, return their answer to any proposals that may be made. It is impossible to declare in advance that they will be accepted, and, if accepted, they may be subjected to conditions which can be discussed and arranged. The Allied and Associated Powers, however, declare that such proposals will be seriously and fairly considered; no one could be better pleased than they if, in the result, a fair, a speedy and a practical settlement were arrived at. The questions are bare questions of fact, namely, the amount of the liabilities, and they are susceptible of being treated in this way. Beyond this, the Allied and Associated Powers cannot be asked to go.\n\nEven if no settlement were arrived at, it must be evident that the early production of the German evidence would greatly abbreviate the enquiry and accelerate the decisions. The German authorities have had long occupation of a large part of the damaged areas and have been over the ground, forwards and backwards, within the last twelve or fifteen months. The Allied and Associated Powers have as yet had no access to this mass of material.\n\nIt is obvious that, if the class of damages done in the devastated areas can be dealt with in this fashion, the liability under the other categories can be quickly established, for it depends on statistics and particulars of a far simpler character. By giving a satisfactory covenant themselves to execute the work of rebuilding, the Germans could at once dispose of the only difficult or long subject of inquiry.\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers have to remark that in the Observations submitted the German Delegation has made no definite offer at all but only vague expressions of willingness to do something undefined. A sum of 100,000,000,000 marks (gold) is indeed mentioned, and this is calculated to give the impression of an extensive offer, which upon examination it proves not to be. No interest is to be paid at all. It is evident that till 1927 there is no substantial payment but only the surrender of military material and the devolution upon other Powers of large portions of Germany’s own debt. Thereafter a series of undefined instalments is to be agreed, which are not to be completed for nearly half a century. The present value of this distant prospect is small, but it is all that Germany tenders to the victims of her aggression in satisfaction for their past sufferings and their permanent burdens.\n\n[Page 967]\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers will, however, make a declaration on another point, as follows: The resumption of German industry involves access by the German people to food supplies and by the German manufacturers to the necessary raw materials and provision for their transport to Germany from overseas. The resumption of German industry is an interest of the Allied and Associated Powers as well as an interest of Germany. They are fully alive to this fact and therefore declare that they will not withhold from Germany commercial facilities without which this resumption cannot take place, but that, subject to conditions and within limits, which cannot be laid down in advance, and subject also to the necessity for having due regard to the special economic situation created for Allied and Associated countries by German aggression and the war, they are prepared to afford to Germany facilities in these directions for the common good.\n\nMeanwhile, the draft Treaty must be accepted as definitive and must be signed. The Allied and Associated Powers cannot any longer delay to assure their security. Germany cannot afford to deny to her populations the peace which is offered to them. The Reparation Commission must be constituted and must commence its task. The only question open will be how best to execute the provisions of the Treaty.\n\nThe foregoing should suffice to demonstrate the reasonableness of the conditions under which Germany is to discharge her reparation obligations, and how utterly unfounded are the criticisms in the German reply. These are, indeed, explicable only on the theory that the German plenipotentiaries have read into the Conditions of Peace, in clear defiance of their express terms, an intention which is not there, but which it would be not unnatural to see displayed by victorious nations which have been the victims of cruelty and devastation on a vast and premeditated scale. The burdens of Germany undeniably are heavy, but they are imposed under conditions of justice by peoples whose social well-being and economic prosperity have been gravely impaired by wrongs which it is beyond the utmost power of Germany to repair.\n\npart ix. financial clauses\n\nBefore examining each of the articles on which the German Delegation has presented observations, the Allied and Associated Powers wish to recall the reply made by M. Clemenceau in their name on May 22,19 to a note from Count Brockdorff-Rantzau dated May 13,20 and especially Paragraph XIII of this letter:\n\nGermany must accept burdens and very heavy burdens being laid on her; financial obligations and guarantees taken by the Allied and Associated Powers to obtain the payment of their claims.\n\nGermany will be able to meet her financial obligations either by means of property and resources that she possesses within the Empire, or by means of property that she possesses abroad.\n\nWithin the Empire the Allied and Associated Powers have claimed a charge only on the property and resources of the Empire and the German states. Their right in this regard, resulting from the financial clauses, has been limited as far as possible, and an effort has been made to avoid giving it any vexatious character. Finally, all exceptions compatible with the rights of the Allied and Associated Powers have been granted, and these will permit the economic interests and credit of Germany to be protected as far as possible.\n\nOutside the Empire, the Allied and Associated Powers have abstained from claiming the transfer of German property and resources in neutral countries; they ask only the cession of property which is not indispensable to Germany’s existence and which can be given up without causing any profound disturbance in her internal life.\n\nIn a word, in view of the burdens that Germany must assume, the financial provisions adopted by the Allied and Associated Powers spare the essential interests of Germany as far as possible.\n\n1. The Allied and Associated Powers again assert their right to obtain the payment of reparations and other charges resulting from the Treaty, in priority to the settlement of all other debts of the Empire or of the German States.\n\nNevertheless, they consider it proper to provide, in certain special cases, for the granting of exceptions to the general principle thus laid down, and they are ready to insert at the beginning of Article 248 the following sentence:\n\nThis new stipulation will permit measures to be taken with a view to protecting Germany’s credit as far as possible.\n\n2. The provision prohibiting the export of gold is a guarantee for the Allied and Associated Powers; the latter have not, however, intended to use their right without reserve, and they have provided that [Page 969] Germany may export gold after receiving authorisation from the Reparation Commission.\n\nThe latter will therefore have power to grant to the Reichsbank, whenever it sees fit, “the right of export, when it is a question of guarantees that this bank has furnished and that it could not furnish by any other means”.\n\n3. The military occupation constitutes for the Allied and Associated Powers one of the essential guarantees which they require; there can therefore be no argument about it.\n\nThe cost of maintenance of armies of occupation has always been borne by the nation subject to the occupation; Germany applied this principle in 1871 when she imposed on France the cost of the German armies of occupation (Convention of Ferrières, March 11, 187121).\n\n4. No distinction can be made between the war material lost by the enemy in the course of military operations and the war material surrendered in execution of an armistice which terminates these operations. It is just therefore that the Reparation Commission shall not credit Germany with the value of material thus surrendered.\n\n5. The provision inserted in Paragraph 2, of Article 251, grants, in favour of the food supply of Germany, an exception to the order of priority established by Paragraph 1 of the same article.\n\nMoreover, it applies solely to the food supply effected through State organisations, since no charge has been established upon the property of German nationals.\n\nThis clause is established in favour of Germany, and if the Allied and Associated Powers have reserved a right of control over the German food supply effected through State organisations, it is because it appears impossible to consent to so important an exception to the principle laid down in Article 248, without reserving control.\n\n6. The partition of the pre-war debt of the German Empire and of the German States will be made in proportion to the contributory power of the various ceded territories. The determination of this contributory power is obviously very delicate, in view of the diversity of fiscal systems in the different German confederated states. Therefore it has not been thought desirable to settle this question at present, and it has been left to the Reparation Commission to estimate which of Germany’s revenues will make it possible to compare the resources of the ceded territories and those of the Empire.\n\nMoreover, the Allied and Associated Powers cannot consider the assigning of a part of Germany’s war debt to the liberated territories; such a division would in fact make the Powers receiving these territories support a part of Germany’s war debt, which is inadmissible.\n\n[Page 970]\n\n7. It cannot be contemplated that Poland should bear either directly or indirectly the burden of a debt contracted to extend Prussian influence at the expense of Polish rights and traditions.\n\n8. The German colonies, having deficits, cannot possibly assume a part of the German debt. It is to be noted moreover that a large part of the expenses incurred in the German Colonies was military and unproductive in character.\n\nIt would be unjust under these conditions to demand that the State made a mandatory by the League of Nations should assume a debt that the colony cannot support.\n\n9. The Allied and Associated Powers have a right, after the events that have happened since 1914, to demand that Germany be no longer intimately involved in their financial and economic life, nor in that of her former Allies, nor in that of Russia.\n\nMoreover, it seems almost certain that Germany, in order to meet the burden of reparations, will find herself obliged to alienate the greater part of the foreign securities held by her nationals. The protection of German holders, whose interests will by this fact be very much reduced, would no longer justify German participation in international organisations.\n\n10. The German Delegation has presented in Annex II of these remarks,22 as well as in a special note of May 29, 1919,23 a certain number of observations.\n\nThe first relate to the transfer of sums deposited in Germany in the name of the Ottoman Debt, of the Imperial Ottoman Government, or of the Austro-Hungarian Government.\n\nThe details furnished by the German Delegation on certain transfers effected in Germany necessitate two modifications of drafting, but the Allied and Associated Powers maintain the principles of the article in question.\n\nIn the first place, the Allied and Associated Powers have not lost sight of the fact that the obligation assumed by the German Government toward Turkey has for its counterpart the engagement of the Turkish Government to reimburse Germany later for the sums advanced by her. Article 259 must be compared with Article 261. The latter provides that the German credit shall be transferred to the Allied and Associated Powers.\n\nIn the second place, the Allied and Associated Powers have in their possession evidence showing under what conditions transfers of gold and silver were made in November, 1918, to the Turkish Ministry of Finance.\n\n[Page 971]\n\nIn the third place, they are of the opinion that if “no sum in gold or any pledge has been transferred to the German Government nor to the banks concerned, for the advances that Austria-Hungary has received through the medium of German banks”, the provision in paragraph 5 will be without effect, and consequently it cannot justify any protest on the part of the German Delegation.\n\nThe other observations relate to the renunciation by Germany of the Treaties of Bucarest24 and Brest-Litovsk.25\n\nThe German Delegation claims the annulment of the engagements incumbent on Germany by reason of these Treaties, as well as of the advantages stipulated in her favour.\n\nThese observations are not well founded.\n\nIn fact, Article 292, which the German Financial Delegation seems to have overlooked, abrogates purely and simply these Treaties, of which moreover the German Delegation declares (General Remarks, Part VII) that “there can be no further argument,” since “Germany has already renounced the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and the Peace of Bucarest was never ratified.”\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers have, moreover, searched in vain in the Peace of Bucarest for “engagements made by Germany.”\n\n11. The Allied and Associated Powers are of the opinion that the cession of the rights and interests of German nationals in every enterprise of public utility and in every concession in Russia and in the countries formerly allies of Germany is essential for the purpose of protection and reparation.\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers have been able, moreover, to appreciate, in the course of the war, what use Germany was capable of making of the control she possessed over her allies and over Russia, and they consider that they have the right to withdraw from Germany all devolution of public authority in these countries.\n\n12. The Allied and Associated Powers reserve the right to demand from Germany the transfer of all her credits on Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey.\n\nBut Article 243 provides that the amount of these credits shall be entered to Germany’s account under the category of reparations at such value as the Reparation Commission shall deem suitable.\n\n13. The obligation to pay in specie cannot be interpreted as an obligation to pay in actual gold.\n\nOn the other hand, the Allied and Associated Powers cannot admit that Germany should pay “in the currency of the country in which the injury has been committed”.\n\n[Page 972]\n\nThe countries which have suffered heavy damage must, to rebuild their ruins, have recourse to the aid of the Allied and Associated countries, and will have to incur heavy expenditures abroad; it would be inadmissible not to leave them the choice of claiming payment in the currency of which they may stand in need.\n\nMoreover, the bonds to be issued by Germany on account of the sums due for reparation must have a very wide market, and their interest must be payable in several currencies.\n\nFinally, whenever it is a question of defining an obligation to pay, it must be done in a fixed currency.\n\n14. In a note of May 29, 1919, the German Delegation has made certain observations relative to article 263.\n\nThe product of the sale of Sao Paolo Coffee at Trieste having been deposited in the Bleichröder Bank, the Allied and Associated Powers cannot accept the suggestion of the German Delegation that these sums should not be included in Article 263.\n\nAt the same time the Allied and Associated Powers recognise that the words “with interest at 5% from the day of deposit” should be changed as follows: “with interest at the rate or rates agreed upon.”\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers are willing, moreover, to omit the word “compulsory” from Article 263.\n\nThe German Government having refused to authorise the withdrawal of these sums and having agreed to return them “intact” at the end of the war, the Allied and Associated Powers must insist that the reimbursement be effected at the rates of exchange existing at the time that the deposits were made.\n\npart x. economic clauses\n\nI. Commercial Policy\n\nThe principles which the Allied and Associated Powers desire to bring into application when the world returns to normal conditions are those which President Wilson has enunciated on various occasions in his speeches and which are embodied in Article 23 (e) of the Covenant of the League of Nations.\n\nBut it is clear that the pronouncements of President Wilson relative to equality of trade conditions must be interpreted as relating to the permanent settlement of the world, and can only be regarded as applicable to a condition of things in which the League of Nations is fully constituted, and the world has returned to normal conditions of trade. In the meantime the establishment of a purely transitory regime necessarily differing from that contemplated in a final settlement is in no way in conflict with such ideas.\n\nDuring this period “the equitable treatment for the commerce of [Page 973] all members of the League” requires that Germany should temporarily be deprived of the right she claims to be treated on a footing of complete equality with other nations.\n\nThe illegal acts of the enemy have placed many of the Allied States in a position of economic inferiority to Germany, whose territory has not been ravaged, and whose plant is in a condition enabling manufactures and trade to be at once resumed after the war. For such countries, a certain freedom of action during the period of transition is vitally necessary, but it is also necessary that the Allied and Associted Powers should in the meantime be safeguarded from the effects of special preferences or discriminations granted by Germany to an Allied or Associated country or to any other country. Hence during the transitory period formal reciprocity is not practicable; and it is only equitable that the Allied and Associated Powers should have for such period greater freedom to regulate their commercial exchanges than is accorded to the authors of the aggression. If it were otherwise, Germany would reap the benefit of the criminal acts which she committed in the territories she occupied with the object of placing her adversaries in a condition of economic inferiority.\n\nIt is, therefore, a consideration for justice which has led the Allied and Associated Powers to impose on Germany, for a minimum period of five years, nonreciprocal conditions in the matter of commercial exchanges. Articles 264 to 267, 323 and 327, drawn up on this basis, are measures of reparation, the duration of which will be determined by the League of Nations.\n\nAfter the necessary period of transition is over, and when a reformed Germany is admitted to membership of the League of Nations, the Allied and Associated Powers will be able to co-operate with her in arriving at a more permanent arrangement for the establishment of an equitable treatment for the commerce of all nations.\n\nNo exception is taken by the German Delegation to the general principle that during a transition period special arrangements are necessary for the products of territories detached from Germany. In the absence of detailed criticism, it must be assumed that no serious objection is entertained to the provisions on this subject which are contained in the Treaty of Peace.\n\nThe necessity of meeting the special conditions of the period of transition has similarly inspired the provision ensuring the application during a period of three years to imports of certain products from Allied and Associated countries of the most favourable rates of the German tariff which were in force in 1914. In this matter certain products, the output of which, in countries bordering on Germany, was specially adjusted with reference to German needs, are temporarily assured of their former market.\n\n[Page 974]\n\nIn order to enable Germany to establish such customs tariffs as she may consider necessary, the Allied and Associated Powers have limited to six months the period for which she is obliged to maintain generally the most favourable rates of customs duty which were in force for imports into Germany on the 31st July, 1914. Such a period is absolutely necessary in order to avoid the economic disturbance which an immediate change of tariff conditions would cause.\n\nII. Treaties\n\nThe general principles which underlie Section II of Part X of the Conditions of Peace explain the terms thereof.\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers are certainly of the opinion that multilateral and bilateral treaties between peoples must exist in times of peace, so that the principles of international law may be enforced and normal international relations maintained. They have therefore aimed at reapplying all multilateral treaties which seemed to them to be compatible with the new conditions arising out of the war.\n\nAs regards bilateral treaties, they have reserved for each of the Allied and Associated Powers the right to decide the matter in conformity with the principles of the Treaty of Peace.\n\nBut they could not permit the continuance of all the treaties which Germany imposed on her allies, on her temporarily defeated adversaries, and even in certain cases on neutral countries, with a view to securing particularly favourable conditions and special advantages of all kinds the maintenance of which is incompatible with the re-establishment of the spirit of justice.\n\nThis principle necessarily involves the rejection of the theory put forward by Germany in Section VII (Treaties) of the Remarks on the Conditions of Peace, and obviates the necessity for any negotiations on the matter. A general indiscriminate reapplication after the conclusion of Peace of all multilateral and bilateral treaties, even for a short time, cannot be accepted, and it is only just that the Allied and Associated Powers should have reserved and should reserve in the future the right to indicate which of these treaties with Germany they intend to revive or to allow to be revived.\n\nThe above applies to the whole of the German remarks on Section II of Part X of the Conditions of Peace, but these remarks call for the following further observations:\n\n1. The German Delegation seem to consider:\n\n(a)\n\nThat, as a result of errors or omissions, the list of multilateral treaties embodied in Article 282 is incomplete.\n\n(b)\n\nThat the contents and meaning of Nos. 7, 17, 19, 20, and 21 of this Article are doubtful.\n\n(c)\n\nFurther, that difficulties may arise, as the result of the individual reserves of States, which may limit the application of certain revived multilateral treaties.\n\nIn reply to this, the Allied and Associated Powers would point out that:\n\n(a)\n\nThe German Government may, after the resumption of diplomatic relations with the Allied and Associated Powers, notify to them any subjects covered by non-revived conventions with regard to which they desire new treaties to be concluded or former agreements to be adapted.\n\n(b)\n\nThe contents and meaning of the treaties numbered 7, 17, 19, 20 and 21 in Article 282 are not open to any doubt. As regards No. 19 the list of Sanitary Conventions may be completed as follows:\n\n“Sanitary Conventions of the 3rd December, 1903,26 and the preceding ones signed on the 30th January, 1892,27 the 15th April, 1893,28 the 3rd April, 1894,29 and the 19th March, 1897.”30\n\n(c)\n\nSubject to any provisions to the contrary inserted in the Conditions of Peace, reserves which may have been made by the Powers signatory to the Treaty of Peace when they signed or adhered to the multilateral treaties revived by Section II of Part X of the Conditions of Peace, retain their value, such treaties reassuming their operation in the same conditions as before the war. If the conditions of their application are modified, a revision will automatically follow.\n\n2. The German Delegation states that the acceptance by Germany of Articles 283 and 284 is incompatible with the dignity of an independent people.\n\nThis opinion is based on a misunderstanding of the meaning and terms of Articles 283 and 284. Germany merely undertakes by Article 283 not to refuse her consent to the conclusion by the new States of the special arrangements referred to in the Postal and Telegraphic Unions. It is not stipulated that the text of these arrangements shall be dictated to her and that she must accept such text without discussion. This Article merely prevents a systematic refusal to the conclusion of such arrangements or insistence on requirements which make their conclusion impossible.\n\nArticle 284 leaves to Germany the option of participating in the drawing-up of the proposed new Radiotelegraphic Convention. There is nothing to prevent her exercising this option if she so desires.\n\nIt is impossible to regard it as an extreme hardship that in matters of this description affecting the peaceful intercourse of European [Page 976] nations Germany should be required to abstain from adopting an attitude which would obstruct international communications. The Allied and Associated Powers are, however, prepared to limit Germany’s obligation to be bound by a new Radiotelegraphic Convention to the case where such a Convention is concluded within five years.\n\n3. The German objections to Article 289 appear to arise out of a misunderstanding of its intention. Whilst the Allied and Associated Powers could not agree to the revival of bilateral treaties or of any clauses in bilateral treaties which are not in accordance "
