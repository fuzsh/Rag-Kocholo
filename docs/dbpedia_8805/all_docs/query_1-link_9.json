        "text": "Germany’s economy is a social market system that is highly advanced, boasting the largest economy in Europe and ranking as the fourth-largest in the world by nominal GDP and fifth by GDP (PPP). However, fluctuations in currency exchange rates can cause significant variations in Germany’s GDP when measured in dollars. According to the IMF, Germany contributed 28% of the euro area economy in 2017. Germany is a founding member of the European Union and the Eurozone.\n\nGermany has a diverse landscape that is rich in natural resources such as timber, lignite, potash, and salt, with minor sources of natural gas found in Lower Saxony. Prior to reunification, uranium mining took place in the Ore Mountains. Fossil fuels are the primary source of energy in Germany’s energy sector, with wind power being the second most prominent source, followed by solar, gas, biomass (wood and biofuels), nuclear power, and hydro. Germany was the first significant industrialised nation to adopt the renewable energy transition known as Energiewende, making it a global leader in wind turbine production.\n\nThe currency history of Germany is a fascinating one that has evolved through times of division, war, recession and hyperinflation. In the 19th century, the Vienna Monetary Treaty established a currency standard for use across German states. The German Empire introduced the Goldmark in 1871, and the Papiermark replaced it in 1914 due to high reparation costs after World War I. The Rentenmark was introduced in 1923 to provide stability and was replaced by the Reichsmark in 1924. During World War II, Germany established a fixed exchange rate between the Reichsmark and currencies of occupied and allied countries, and the Reichsmark became nearly worthless after massive inflation.\n\nAfter the war, Germany was divided into two states. West Germany replaced the Reichsmark with the Deutsche Mark and became the most prosperous economy in Europe. East Germany replaced the Reichsmark with the East German Mark, but it stagnated. In 1990, Germany was reunified, and the Deutsche Mark became the official currency of Germany until 2002, when the Euro became its legal tender together with other European countries under European Monetary Union.\n\nTipping culture in Germany is not as strong compared to other countries like Australia, and some Germans do not tip at all. Tips usually range from five to ten percent, with most Germans tipping for one-off services like food delivery, restaurant servers, hairdressers, and taxi drivers. Tipping amount varies depending on the type of service received, and for small or casual meals, rounding up the bill and adding a couple of euros is common. Here’s a guide to help you navigate tipping customs.\n\nRestaurants: If you are at a sit-down restaurant, it is generally expected to tip around 10%. If you are not satisfied with the service, it’s alright not to tip, but please inform your food server about the issue so they can help the restaurant improve for next time. However, remember that it is not common to tip at fast food restaurants or supermarkets in Germany.\n\nBars: When you have drinks at a bar, it’s fine not to leave a tip or just round up the bill to the next euro. For instance, if your drink costs 3.50 euros, inform your bartender to charge 4 euros.\n\nDrivers: If you use a taxi or Uber app, you can add a tip to your bill easily. On the other hand, if you’re paying cash, rounding up the bill and adding a couple of euros is common. For example, if your fare is 33.20 euros, you may pay 35 euros in total.\n\nHairdressers: If you’re happy with your haircut, a 5% tip is appreciated for your hairdresser. Some hairdressers have a piggy bank or box with their name where you can deposit your tip.\n\nMovers: Movers are tipped in Germany since they are considered one-time service providers. For a short move, the tip for every mover is around 5 euros per hour. On the other hand, for longer moves such as Hamburg to Munich, 10 to 20 euros per helper is appropriate. The exact amount should depend on your budget and how much the move physically challenges the helpers.\n\nDelivery Services: If you use food delivery services or have your groceries delivered, you can tip the delivery person between one to two euros.\n\nBudget\n\nIf you’re considering backpacking through this beautiful country, it’s recommended that you set aside at least 55 EUR per day to cover your expenses. This budget assumes that you’ll be staying in a hostel dorm, preparing your own meals, and exploring mostly free activities like hiking and walking tours. It’s also important to limit your drinking and use local transportation to get around. If you do plan on indulging in Germany’s renowned beer culture, be sure to add an additional 5-10 EUR to your daily budget.\n\nModerate\n\nFor a moderate mid-range budget of 135 EUR per day, you can make the most of your trip without breaking the bank. This budget will allow you to stay in a comfortable Airbnb room, enjoy a few meals out, take the occasional taxi, sample some of Germany’s famous beers, take the bus between cities, and explore more paid activities like visiting museums and castles.\n\nLuxury\n\nIf you’re looking to pamper yourself while travelling in Germany, setting aside a “luxury” budget of at least 245 EUR per day is a good starting point. This will allow you to indulge in high-end hotels, fine dining, and convenient transportation via taxis or trains. You’ll have the flexibility to book whatever activities and tours you desire without worrying about the cost. Literally, the sky’s the limit!"
