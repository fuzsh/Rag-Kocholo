        "text": "Holy Roman Empire, German Confederation, North German Confederation, and the German Empire Explained\n\nThe Constituent States of the German Empire\n\nGlossary of German Noble and Royal Titles\n\nThe German Empire existed from the unification of Germany in 1871 until the abdication of Emperor Wilhelm II in 1918 after World War I when all the constituent monarchies in the German Empire were abolished. The German Empire consisted of 26 states, most of them ruled by royal families. The King of Prussia was also the German Emperor (Kaiser) and the capital of the German Empire was Berlin. The member states retained their own governments but lost some aspects of sovereignty. For example, both postage stamps and currency were issued for the empire as a whole.\n\nThe constituent states of the German Empire included four kingdoms (Bavaria, Prussia, Saxony, Württemberg), six grand duchies (Baden, Hesse and by Rhine, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Oldenburg, Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach), five duchies (Anhalt, Brunswick, Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Saxe-Meiningen), seven principalities (Lippe, Reuss-Gera Junior Line, Reuss-Greiz Elder Line, Schaumburg-Lippe, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, Waldeck and Pyrmont) three free Hanseatic cities (Bremen, Hamburg, Lübeck), and one imperial territory (Bremen, Hamburg, Lübeck).\n\nGERMAN KINGDOMS\n\nKingdom of Bavaria Index\n\nKingdom of Hanover Index\n\nKingdom of Prussia Index\n\nKingdom of Saxony Index\n\nKingdom of Württemberg Index\n\nGERMAN GRAND DUCHIES\n\nGrand Duchy of Baden Index\n\nGrand Duchy of Hesse and by Rhine Index\n\nGrand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin Index\n\nGrand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz Index\n\nGrand Duchy of Oldenburg Index\n\nGrand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach Index\n\nGERMAN DUCHIES\n\nDuchy of Anhalt Index\n\nDuchy of Brunswick Index\n\nDuchy of Saxe-Altenburg Index\n\nDuchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld/Saxe-Coburg and Gotha Index\n\nDuchy of Saxe-Meiningen Index\n\nDuchy of Schleswig-Holstein Index\n\nGERMAN PRINCIPALITIES"
