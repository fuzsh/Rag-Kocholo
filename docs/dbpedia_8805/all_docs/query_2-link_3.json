        "text": "Having outlined the history of trade and its theoretical assumptions, the following chapter will be focusing on the development of German politics and economics. As pointed out by Kaltefleiter (1968), politics and economics have to be regarded as a unity since they overlap in many aspects (p. 14).\n\nAccording to the Oxford Learner’s Dictionary (2021a), economics is defined as “the study of how a society organizes its money, trade and industry”, whereas politics describes “the activities involved in getting and using power in public life and being able to influence decisions that affect a country or a society” (Oxford Learner’s Dictionary, 2021b). Kaltefleiter (1968) refers both terms to behaviours of certain groups – enterprises, consumers, investors and savers for economics; electors and elects for politics (pp. 13f.).\n\nBearing in mind that history is an ongoing process and previous events always influence the ones to come, it is still worthwhile getting a broader view on the German history. For this reason, although the conducted analysis in the next chapter will refer to recent years, the outline will not only focus on the 20th and 21st century but also include elements from the 19th century.\n\n3.1. The creation of the German state\n\nIn the 19th century, no German state as such existed but the region was split into territorial states and free cities. Each area operated in its own currency then and no freedom of movement or settlement was guaranteed. In order to improve trade between these areas, the German Customs Union (Deutscher Zollverein), a formal union of 33 German territorial states and four free cities was created (Wurm, 1975, p. 35; Hilt, 2020; Generalzolldirektion, 2022).\n\nGenerally, there was no common attitude towards the future economic constitution. The majority of Germans wanted the economy to be bound but the thought of an overall liberal market economy caused their discomfort. In the end, the German states agreed on a common Customs Policy and the expansion of the rail industry which promoted trade liberalisation (Scriba, 2014).\n\nAn important event was the liberation of peasants in the 1850s which integrated the agricultural sector into the liberal economic system which the manufacturing industry followed soon. As a consequence, crafts businesses were in oversupply causing wage and price dumping, which then led to an impoverishment\n\nof the working people. Liberalisation of the economic system would not solve the problem but a change of the production process was needed to improve quality and output (Wurm, 1975, p. 38ff.).\n\nAlthough agriculture played an important role nearly throughout the 19th century, a shift towards manufacturing could already been observed at the end of it (Mahlerwein, 2020). Additionally, this era was marked with the establishment of factories replacing traditional jobs. Even though this time was marked with uncertainty, the level of liberalism achieved within this economic system was comparable to the one established within the European Economic Community after the Second World War. The political borders were respected but, nonetheless, there were several agreements in place which made an exchange of goods, services, currencies, and even people across the borders of the German Federation possible (Wurm, 1975, pp. 54ff.).\n\nAt that time, Germany was already intensely trading with Britain and the United States. Its production progress caused an even bigger dependency on its trading partners who provided the required raw materials. Hence, the international gold crisis of 1857–1859 also affected the German economy (Boerse.de, 2022).\n\nIn the meantime, Germany extended its heavy industry and rail network, which positively influenced the coal industry (Hilt, 2020). In order to reduce imports of British coal, the delivery of which to certain German areas (especially those located in the north) was still much cheaper than the delivery of German coal, special carriage tariffs were applied (Brüggemeier, 2018; Wurm, 1975, pp. 56ff.). Apart from that, the improvement of the transport network contributed to the redistribution of mismatched goods by transferring them from areas with oversupply to those which were lacking the particular goods (Wurm, 1975, p. 70).\n\nOverall, German products suitable for exports were wheat, outputs of the textile industry, and above all coal, iron and ironware. With regard to the latter, the more Germany improved its quality, the more its exports grew. As a result, the income from coal was the main means of payments to settle all claims from imported goods (Wurm, 1975, p. 59).\n\nAnother pillar for Germany’s economic development was its dominating position in the chemical industry, especially in the area of paints and pharmaceuticals. From the 1860s, Germany was considered a leader in paint manufacturing, covering 85% of the world’s demand for paints, keeping this position until World War II (Wurm, 1975, p. 68).\n\nWhat still impeded the efficient exchange of goods within the German Customs Union was the existence of different currency areas. Since other countries\n\nsuch as Britain started using the gold currency, the government decided to follow suit, which however did not happen until 1873 (Wurm, 1975, pp. 73ff.; Wirtschaftslexikon24.com, 2017).\n\nAfter its victory in the Franco-Prussian War (1870/71), the German Empire (Deutsches Kaiserreich) was founded leading to the unity of the German states. Having lost the war, France had to transfer Alsace-Lorraine and pay off war reparations to Germany (Pfeil, 2021). As a consequence, Germany turned into a world monopoly of potash. The ongoing production of coal and iron was another pillar for Germany’s success becoming one of the leading industrial nations on the European continent (Wurm, 1975, p. 84).\n\nAt this time, the foundation for civil law and economic law, as we know them today, was laid. People made use of their freedom of movement and transport, which resulted in a lot of migration affecting Germany as well. The general population grew, which had a massive influence on the economic development (Wurm, 1975, pp. 85ff.).\n\nWithin 30 years between 1870 and 1900, the German economic output grew so much that Germany overtook France and the United Kingdom, becoming second worldwide. This progress was caused by its dominating position in production on domestic and foreign markets (Wurm, 1975, p. 102).\n\nThis period of wealth made businessmen look for investment means which eventually happened to be companies with capital stock. This time is primarily called as the years of the rapid industrial expansion (Gründerzeit). With the change of the stock exchange law in 1870, joint-stock companies were not overseen by the state anymore, leading to speculations. The first speculation bubble burst in the United States, leading to the stock market crash on the German market in 1873/74. However, this crisis did not last for long as Germany’s exports had been growing again since 1887 (Wurm, 1975, pp. 102f.; Draheim, 2005).\n\nDue to the growing population, Germany was not self-sufficient anymore despite improvements in its own harvest outputs. As a consequence, it became more and more dependent on food imports from Russia and Austria-Hungary (Wurm, 1975, pp. 111f.).\n\nThe turn of the 19th and 20th centuries is characterised by the era of colonialism, also referred to as imperialism. The leading industrial European countries, which Germany belonged to, focused on the delivery of manufactured goods, semi-finished products, services (such as overseas transport of raw materials) and capital to all continents using their outputs as a means of payments. In order to ensure the supply of raw materials, colonies, mainly in Africa, were acquired. The change in behaviour could also be observed in the German trade structure. In 1873, 38% of the goods exported by Germany were manufactured goods,\n\nwhereas 40 years later, in 1913, the share increased to 61%. Additionally, imports grew unproportionally compared to exports, causing a negative trade balance. At first, Germany was able to fill the gap, but the real consequences were yet to come (Wurm, 1975, pp. 112ff.; Laak, 2005).\n\nWith the outbreak of World War I, the demand for money increased. The only solution was to print money, which consequently caused inflation. Although many countries were affected by currency devaluation, Germany was one of the most affected ones. (Kaltefleiter, 1968, p. 74; Wurm, 1975, pp. 117ff.).\n\nAiming to be superior and ahead of the enemy, the German government employed the concept of planned economy and started centralising workforce, arms, munitions, and supplies. Raw materials, semi-finished products and machines were centrally confiscated and fixed prices were imposed. The centralised management also applied to food due to its growing demand and the inability to import it from abroad. In the end, ration cards were introduced in 1915 (Wurm, 1975, p. 181; Bruendel, 2004, pp. 39f.). Generally, the First World War is considered the first of the four periods of German economic instability in the 20th century (Leaman, 1988, p. 9)13 .\n\nThe final agreements on the war outcome were specified in the Treaty of Versailles which was signed in 1919. Germany was found guilty and had to give away strategically important regions such as the Saar area, Alsace-Lorraine, Upper Silesia and East Prussia. Their loss meant a deterioration of its influential position in the world economy and reduced its capabilities to produce goods for export. Along with the land and production loss, the huge amount of reparation bills had an extended impact on its economy (2021, Germany, p. 475; Wurm, 1975, pp. 189f.).\n\nIn addition to the Treaty of Versailles, Woodrow Wilson proposed in his Fourteen Points the setting up of the League of Nations which was “the first attempt to create an international organization that could bring countries together to discuss solutions to mutual problems” (Nyegray, 2021, p. 3). However, this approach did not last for long. According to Wurm (1975), the era after the First World War was characterised by the “economic egoism of the individual countries” combined with methods of “nationalist economic policy”14 (p. 186).\n\n13 Leaman (1988, p. 9.) classifies the following periods in Germany as economical instable – 1914–1918: First World War, 1919–1923: beginning of Weimar Republic, 1929–1934: Great Depression and 1940–1945: Second World War. 14 Own translation.\n\n3.2. The Weimar Republic and the Third Reich\n\nThe defeat in the First World War marks the end of both the German Empire and the gold currency, and also the start of the Weimar Republic proclaimed by Scheidemann in 1918 (Cope, 2020, p. 1043; Kaltefleiter, 1968, p. 24). However, the transition from the German Empire to the Weimar Republic caused a lot of social conflicts. Economic impoverishment and inflation have already been discussed. Another important issue was the rise and success of radical parties, such as the National Socialist German Workers’ Party (NSDAP15) and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD16) fighting with the existing democratic system (Kaltefleiter, 1968, pp. 23ff.).\n\nGenerally, there was a big discrepancy in people’s attitudes since a vast majority lost trust in the existing government (Kaltefleiter, 1968, p. 29). Accompanied by mental and physical exhaustion, the hopelessness was worsened by the harsh conditions imposed by the Allied powers whose claims exceeded by far what Germany was capable to pay off based on its economic performance. Wurm (1975) names this state a “paralysis” (p. 191) which did not come to an end until 1923. Supporters of the right-wing parties hoped they would improve the dramatic situation of Germany at that time (Wurm, 1975, p. 191).\n\nThe era following the post-war inflation is called the “Golden Twenties”, reflecting the short period of prosperity in the Weimar Republic before the Great Depression hit the world economy (Kaltefleiter, 1968, p. 22). The recovery of the German economy was possible due to the introduction of the Dawes Plan and a new currency, the Rentenmark. The Dawes Plan re-negotiated the conditions of repayments by Germany and ensured financial aid to Germany by the United States. The change of the currency re-gained people’s trust in the stability of its value and is often referred to as the “wonder of the Rentenmark”. Having the finances under control, the German economy could again flourish, reaching its 1913 level of income in 1928 (Wurm, 1975, pp. 195ff.; Gruber, 2000, p. 134; 2021, Germany, p. 475).\n\nThe years of wealth were disturbed by the Great Depression from 1929 to 1934. Falling stock prices at the New York Stock Exchange caused a worldwide crisis which was deepened by decreased demand and production capabilities. Germany faced another problem: Certain banks were granting loans without\n\n15 The abbreviation originates from its German name Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (own annotation). 16 The abbreviation originates from its German name Kommunistische Partei Deutschland (own annotation).\n\nsufficient security. When investors from abroad started to withdraw their money, these banks became illiquid and relied on the support of the state (Gruber, 2000, pp. 134ff.).\n\nAccording to Kaltefleiter (1968), the situation which emerged after the Great Depression is comparable to the one in 1923 after the fall of the German Empire, with a significant difference though: While the inflation of 1923 was overcome by the introduction of a democratic system which also ensured economic stability, a decade later the upcoming inflation had an opposite effect destroying all democratic achievements so far (p. 80).\n\nWith the financial support of leading business representatives and being generally supported by the middle class and right-wing traditionalists, Hitler finally managed to win the elections becoming Chancellor of the Reich in 1933. A year later, after the Reichstag had burned down, he announced the Third Reich and himself as its Chancellor (2021, Germany, p. 475). A further explanation for Hitler’s rise to power is provided by Leaman (1988), which is the result of the “process of desperate experimentation managed through the President, Von Hindenburg”17 (p. 15).\n\nBefore seizing power, Hitler promised the German people “work and bread”. Looking at the course of the following years, unemployment significantly decreased starting at 6.13 million in January 1933 and reaching 200,000 in 1938, which can be equated with full employment. This was achieved with the introduction of Hitler’s first four-year plan which created various areas where people found employment. Officially, this plan was to secure the well-being of the German people but, in reality, Hitler aimed to create a German state which was unconquerable in case another war broke out.\n\nA further step was the transition of all spheres of life under the process of Gleichschaltung18. Translated into English, this term means consolidation. This process aimed to re-organise existing associations or unions including the agricultural sector to make them perform in line with the goals set by the NSDAP (Schneider & Toyka-Seid, 2021). Everything from cultivation to delivery contingents to price settings was centrally managed but despite good harvest outputs Germany remained dependent on food imports (Wurm, 1975, pp. 247f.).\n\nIn 1936, Hitler announced his second four-year plan declaring that within these four years Germany would need to become completely self-sufficient in\n\n17 Paul von Hindenburg was the first President of the Weimar Republic and then of the Third Reich until 1934. 18 In English-speaking sources, the term Gleichschaltung is often referred to as “co-operation” (BBC, 2021).\n\nterms of any essential goods. Taking 1928, one year before the Great Depression, as a base year, Germany re-achieved its performance in 1933 (Wurm, 1975, pp. 249f.).\n\nFocusing on foreign trade at that time, all transactions outside Germany, be it purchase or sale, were totally controlled and subject to the state’s authorities. They checked whether sufficient foreign currency was available and whether this commodity matched the provided priority scale set topdown. Consequently, no real freedom of trade was granted anymore. (Wurm, 1975, pp. 250f.).\n\nThe attitude of the state can be summed up with the terms “import quota system” and “export promotions”. On the one hand, to reduce the use of required foreign currencies, goods were exchanged for others. On the other hand, to build up foreign cash reserves, Germany started selling its products far below the applicable market price, in some cases even below production costs so that it was able to pay for the required goods from imports. But despite the effort undertaken, the success was limited in time. Overall, Germany as a pioneer led to the end of worldwide free trade and competition being followed by the rest of the world (Wurm, 1975, pp. 251f.).\n\nGetting back to Germany’s economic situation at that time, on the outside though, by 1936, Germany achieved the conditions of the economic “magic square” which is composed of economic growth, low inflation, high employment and a healthy balance of payments reflecting “the image of economic equilibrium” (Leaman, 1988, p. 15). But, as stated by Leaman (1988), this “state form became rapidly dysfunctional” (p. 16).\n\nTwo years later, in 1938, the situation dramatically changed, leaving a huge debt in the country’s balance sheet. By then, nearly one fourth of the production volume was utilised in the armaments sector. The only way to maintain the high living standards of the people, which directly translated to the party’s popularity and its overall support, and to prevent any further indebtedness was annexation and war (Leaman, 1988, p. 15; Wurm, 1975, pp. 252, 261).\n\nCountries were annexed which provided profits in terms of gold and foreign currency inventories or food such as grain, meat and fat. (2021, Germany, p. 475; Wurm, 1975, p. 261). Although the first two years went well for Hitler, which also indicates how well he was prepared, his success at that time came little by little to its end. First of all, more and more money was needed to finance the war costs. In order to overcome this problem, money – which was in short supply but was needed – was printed. This action was only approved since Hitler was convinced that he would win the war and be able to impose the costs incurred upon the subjugated countries afterwards.\n\nThe final breakthrough of Germany’s losing position was the attack on the Soviet Union and the United States in 1941. In 1945, accompanied by Hitler’s suicide, the Second World War ended and thereby the era of the Third Reich (2021, Germany, p. 475; Wurm, 1975, pp. 262f.) with no German state left behind (Leaman, 1988, p. 17).\n\n3.3. Post-War Germany\n\nWith Germany’s surrender, the Berlin Declaration of 1945 constituted which parts of the former Third Reich, later named as zones of occupation, would be allocated to which Allied power. These Allied powers were represented by the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union. Further agreements on the land distribution were made during the Potsdam Conference in 1945 (2021, Germany, p. 475).\n\nWith Germany having been divided among them, each of these four powers was responsible for the whole administration within its own zone, which also included, among other things, trade and industrial production. Generally, the aim of the Allied powers was “to destroy the political and economic potential of the German state to wage war” (Leaman, 1988, p. 18).\n\nDuring the first four years under occupation, there was a low level of investments, which indicates that a capital market as such did not exist and there was still much uncertainty what to expect from the future (Leaman, 1988, p. 26). Focusing on the production of goods, the figures of 1947 show a level of less than one third in comparison with what it used to be in 1938, one year before the outbreak of the war. These huge deficiencies can be explained with the lack of raw materials, the damaged transport system, and the division of Germany into four occupation zones.\n\nDuring this time, especially the regions in the West suffered from enormous food shortages since, as a result of Germany losing the war, 30% of the former agricultural land had been taken away and another 40% of the production output was under the Soviet control. As a consequence, food was traded on the black market or purchased directly from farmers (Gruber, 2000, pp. 183f.). People living in the areas controlled by the United States and the United Kingdom were so much malnourished that both powers had to provide food from their own supplies (Leaman, 1988, p. 23). The winter of 1946/47, during which the living standards of the people deteriorated further, can be seen even more as the turning point when the first steps were taken to help Germany’s recovery (Gruber, 2000, p. 184).\n\nFurthermore, the United States being hardly affected by the war realised that punishing Germany would no longer be in their interest assuming the reduction in the world trade economy would harm them more (Leaman, 1988, p. 23). Additionally, Europe’s recovery would not be wise without the simultaneous recovery of Germany (Lange, 1990, p. 268).\n\nAs a result, the United States and the United Kingdom formed the Bizone in 1947, which a year later was joined by France. Some sources claim that the creation of the Bizone was “a formal step […] against the USSR” (Leaman, 1988, p. 35). Others emphasise that it was the Soviet Union which separated from the rest following its own way, not only withdrawing from the Allied Control Council but also blocking West Berlin which was part of the Western Allies (2021, Germany, p. 475). A division between West and East could no longer be prevented, which was officially confirmed with the creation of two German states in 1949 – the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic (GDR).\n\nBefore the creation of the West German state, which came into effect with the introduction of the Basic Law in May 1949, the United States feared a too strong, independent and unified Germany. On that occasion, they addressed the urgency of establishment of a West European federation which West Germany would be part of in order to prevent a historic recurrence (Leaman, 1988, p. 35).\n\nAnother significant event was the currency reform in 1948. Due to the extensive monetary circulation, which was a consequence of the currency devaluation caused by the actions undertaken by the Third Reich government, the currency then in force finally lost its exchange function being replaced by barter economy. However, currency stability is a precondition for a state to function properly not only for international trade but also to create people’s trust.\n\nFrom today’s perspective, this reform is mainly considered as one of the significant factors for the economic upturn, also referred to as the “economic miracle” (Gruber, 2000, p. 185; Wurm, 1975, p. 282; Lange, 1990, pp. 268f.). Leaman (1988), however, points out that the currency reform would not have been as successful if it had not coincided with a general cyclical upturn and the general availability of products which had previously been rationed (p. 34).\n\nAnother influencing factor which contributed to the economic miracle was the support of the United States organised through various aid programmes such as the Marshall Plan or the GARIOA (short for “Government Aid and Relief in Occupied Areas”) programme. Overall, they provided Germany with needed raw materials, food and foreign currency aiming to defeat the misery after the war as quickly as possible and enable the German economy to accelerate (Gruber, 2000, p. 186).\n\nAlthough, according to Leaman (1988), it is not possible to examine the causation between the introduction of the social market economy and Germany’s\n\nupturn (p. 35), the introduction of this new economic system must not be forgotten at this point. This shift aimed to get away from the measures which had been applied as a leftover from the war period, such as price controls and rationing. Instead, the changing was heading towards a world with competition again (Gruber, 2000, p. 186). The social market economy is based on the principle “freedom on the market” combined with social factors, i.e., humanity which implies individual freedom on the one hand, but on the other hand demands solidarity and helpfulness reflected by social justice and security (Lange, 1990, p. 270). This means that in contrast to a traditional free market economy, the state is still allowed to intervene into economic life (Thalheim, 1978, p. 13).\n\nThere is no homogeneous consensus as to how to divide the post-war economic development of West Germany into phases.\n\nGruber (2000) groups the years 1948–1966/67 into one cluster, calling it the “phase of ordoliberalism” whose primary aim was to rebuild the West German economy so that every citizen would be able to benefit from it by analogy to Erhard’s19 slogan “Prosperity for all”. However, this economic boom was terminated by the 1967 recession which marked a turning point at that time (p. 188).\n\nLanger (1990) has chosen a different classification and divides this period into three: 1) 1948–1958: economic recovery and implementation of the social market economy concept; 2) 1959–1973: full employment; 3) 1974–1990: structural transformation, split into a) 1974–1983: downturn – due to the oil crisis, high unemployment; b) 1984–1990: upturn – with high economic growth and export surplus but still high unemployment (pp. 271f.).\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, West Germany joined several organisations and was one of the founding members for some of them, which in turn strengthened the West German importance on the international market. These organisations are as follows and shall be partly discussed later: 1) North Atlantic Treaty Organization – NATO; 2) European Economic Community – EEC; 3) Organization for European Economic Co-operation – OEEC; 4) International Bank for Reconstruction and Development – IBRD / World Bank; 5) International Money Fund – IMF; 6) General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade – GATT; 7) European Coal and Steel Community – ECSC;\n\n19 Ludwig Erhard – Chancellor of West Germany.\n\n8) European Payments Union – EPU (Leaman, 1988, p. 82; Gruber, 2000, p. 189).\n\nWith the occupation of Germany in 1945, one of the main Allies’ aims was to demilitarise the German state. Ten years later, after Germany joined the NATO, plans changed. Triggered by the events of the development of Russia’s nuclear bomb, the Chinese Revolution and the outbreak of the Korean War, fear of the East, in particular communism, emerged. The Western Allies became more worried about the “Soviet imperialism” than about the “German militarism” (Leaman, 1988, p. 83).\n\nOn top of that, the German heavy industry being well-developed in the past appeared to be of “strategic importance to any West European Defence effort” (Leaman, 1988, p. 84). Furthermore, it was too expensive to maintain an army of occupation along with a standing army. Finally, there was also a psychological factor involved, which assumed that engaging West Germany in the plans of the Western alliance would be more beneficial than excluding it and risking a potential hostility towards the alliance.\n\nBeing a member of the NATO, West Germany was released from the occupation, gaining its status of a nation state (Leaman, 1988, p. 84). In 1974, Germany became the second country in terms of exports (Thalheim, 1978, p. 94), which only proves how quickly its economy had developed, bearing in mind that 25 years earlier it started from zero.\n\nIn parallel with the development of West Germany, the eastern part of Germany was kept under the Soviet control. Unlike in the West, the economic system in the German Democratic Republic remained a planned economy, or more precisely: “socialistic planned economy” as stated in its constitution. The Soviet Union introduced a two-year plan, first for the period of 1949/50, and afterwards a five-year plan for the period of 1951 to 1955 (Thalheim, 1978, pp. 9f.). In 1954, the Soviet Union renounced their reparation demands towards East Germany and granted its sovereignty (2021, Germany, p. 475).\n\nThe difference between the ruling systems of the Western Allies and the Soviet Union was that the Soviet Union acted to serve its own purposes and was less interested in the recovery of the East German economy: Most of the German industrial plants had to be dismantled. The production output of the remaining plants was taken for granted by the Soviet Union.\n\nIn other words, the German Democratic Republic was obliged to provide deliveries to the Soviet Union without receiving any compensation. Additionally, the Soviet Union acquired many industrial companies, which meant that they were then owned by the Soviet Union. Even the German workforce could not escape these moves and were transferred, having to serve where they were needed.\n\nThalheim (1978) uses the term “sovietisation” (p. 10) to describe the entire process. In this context, he also mentions the “socialistic property of production means” and the “central planning and controlling of economy” which had their immediate effect on the development of East Germany (Thalheim, 1978, pp. 9f.).\n\nHaving a look at the East German foreign trade, it is worth pointing out that the German Democratic Republic used to be the most important provider for the Soviet Union at that time, especially in the area of capital goods. This reflected the assumptions of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance which stated that most of the foreign trade was supposed to be transacted with the Soviet Union bloc. The German Democratic Republic being a member of this council from 1952 was not excluded from this approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the GDR also relied much on imports which exceeded its export capabilities, causing an imbalance of trade and finally leading to an ongoing indebtedness especially in relation to Western countries. In the Eastern bloc, the GDR was the second biggest exporter and the third biggest importer, in both cases after the Soviet Union itself (Thalheim, 1978, pp. 94ff.). It should not be to anyone’s surprise that the bad economic situation had a tangible impact on the quality of life, causing revolts against food shortages and collectivism in the 1950s (2021, Germany, p. 476).\n\n3.4. Divided Germany\n\nWith the creation of two separate German states, the question arises how the relationship was maintained between these two regions which previously used to be one. The answer to this question needs to include various spheres which can be split into people migration, trade, and policy, but at the same time need to be considered as an interaction.\n\nIn 1949, Konrad Adenauer was appointed Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany. Wanting to reunify Germany, he did not recognise the German Democratic Republic as a separate state. It was not until 1972 that a mutual agreement was eventually signed, recognising the existence of two separate states and expressing their will to co-operate with each other. On the other hand, in 1952, the Soviet Union put up a fence along the border between the two German states and another one around West Berlin in 1961, commonly known as the Berlin Wall. Within the first years of separation, from 1945 until 1961, the Federal Republic of Germany experienced a huge migration move from the German Democratic Republic (2021, Germany, p. 476).\n\nConsidering the actual exchange of goods, trade between these two regions, after they had been divided into separate states, never achieved its pre-Second World War level. First of all, the split demanded that both of them needed to build factories which had not been needed earlier since the goods manufactured used to be shipped from one area to another. A second, quite important factor was the attitude of the Soviet Union that trade within the bloc had the highest priority. As a consequence, most of the output produced by the German Democratic Republic was used by the Soviet Union itself and there was not much left for the East German state to export outside its group.\n\nBoth German states still relied on imports as they used to before. However, since the German Democratic Republic did not have many opportunities to earn on exports, this caused a certain imbalance of trade relations and in the next step – difficulties in payment settlements. By the end of the 1960s, the Federal Republic of Germany delivered more to the German Democratic Republic than it received from it. Apart from that, quality played an important role as well. For some reason, during the years of occupation, the German Democratic Republic ended up with quality standards lagging behind those of the West (Thalheim, 1978, pp. 101ff.).\n\nIt is worth mentioning the different treatment of the internal German trade by each country. The payment was handled by the relevant central banks of both states. This means that no cash payments were used in trade. In order to facilitate a transaction, a specific accounting unit (“Swing”) was created which equalled one Deutsche Mark, the currency in force in the Federal Republic. Additionally, an interest-free overdraft was introduced between these two countries, which in the end was mainly used by the German Democratic Republic.\n\nThe European Economic Community agreed that internal German trade would be custom-free and not considered foreign trade by the West German state. However, this rule only applied unilaterally. The trade statistics of the East German state presented the internal German trade separately (Thalheim, 1978, pp. 101ff.). According to Thalheim (1978), this also served propagandistic purposes (p. 103).\n\nBy the end of the 1980s, there were movements towards the unification of the two German states, which finally happened in 1990. The German Democratic Republic accepted the currency of the Federal Republic to be its official currency and also agreed to inherit the economic, monetary and social legislation (2021, Germany, p. 476). The unification caused challenges for the East German producers: They were not used to a market economic system, their production processes were outdated and at the same time they lost their permanent trading partners, the countries belonging to the Soviet bloc (Gruber, 2000, pp. 233f.).\n\n3.5. Federalism\n\nThe official name of the re-united Germany was taken over from the then West German state which was Federal Republic of Germany, translated from the German Bundesrepublik Deutschland. Germany is known for its federal structure. The main questions now are: What does federalism mean? What was the motivation for the creation of federal states? When did this happen? To what extent do they differ from the federal (country) level? What are their duties, responsibilities, but also what freedom of choice do they enjoy?\n\nAccording to Encyclopædia Britannica (2021b), federalism is a “mode of political organization that unites separate states or other polities within an overarching political system in a way that allows each to maintain its own integrity”.\n\nGermany has always been formed out of various ethnicities and thus, despite being and feeling German, its population additionally had a local affinity, i.e., they considered themselves e.g., as Bavarians, Saxons or Thuringians (Münch & Laufer, 1998, pp. 98f.). The post-war occupation and the split into zones was one of the milestones for the current federalism. Within their zones, the Allied Powers allowed for the creation of federal states, in German called Länder, which happened in 1945 to 1947. Table 3 shows as an overview which states were formed and which occupation zone they belonged to. Since Berlin was sliced into four occupation zones, it received a special status (Sturm, 2001, p. 22).\n\nIt is worth mentioning at this opportunity that the border demarcations set not always considered historical, cultural or economic background and therefore were perceived as “arbitrary” or even “original” whereas “original” in this context does not mean based on pre-existing circumstances but rather “inventive” or “novel” (Münch & Laufer, 1998, p. 79; Sturm, 2001, p. 22).\n\nTable 3. Federal states in occupation zones\n\nOccupation zone Federal states\n\nSoviet Union Saxony, Thuringia, Mecklenburg, Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt French Baden, Württemberg-Hohenzollern, Rhineland-Palatinate British North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg United States Bavaria, Hesse, Württemberg-Baden, Bremen\n\nSource: Author’s own elaboration based on: Sturm, R. (2001). Föderalismus in Deutschland. Opladen: Leske+ Budrich, p. 22.\n\nThe Office of Military Government, United States (OMGUS) started as the first institution with the creation of three states: Bavaria, Württemberg-Baden\n\nand Hesse. A further reason for the establishment of federal states was the fact that decisions on a global level, i.e., relating to the entire German state, required a lot more effort. Since Germany was occupied by four powers and to avoid problems with communication, it was easier to make decisions according to local needs and requirements (Leaman, 1988, pp. 33f.).\n\nIt needs to be emphasised that although there was consensus between the Allied powers about the creation of federal states, yet the biggest disagreement concerned the future system of the German state. The Soviet Union opted for a strict centralised state. The United Kingdom preferred a system similar to the Soviets but with decentralised and federal elements. The United States aimed to enlarge the federal concept creating an absolute federal state. France, contrary to the rest, wished to introduce a loose State Union (Sturm, 2001, pp. 22f.).\n\nEach of the Allies had its own motivation for a particular system. Looking at the existing political systems at that time, it does not take much effort to conclude that all of them, apart from France, preferred a German state system which was similar to their own. The Americans additionally wanted to prevent a dominant socialist change and tried to encourage self-interest, both private and public. France, however, was afraid of a too strong Germany and therefore supported a solution where relations between the federal states would not get too intense (Leaman, 1988, p. 37). Finally, in 1947, the attempt to achieve a common agreement between the four powers failed. The Soviet Union decided to follow its own goals, separating from the others and later dissolving the federal states under its occupation in 1952 (Sturm, 2001, pp. 23ff.).\n\nThe United Kingdom, the United States and France remained together and entrusted the definition of the federal system to the West German politicians. The leading question was the distribution of power between the federal level and the federal state level (Sturm, 2001, p. 24), and more precisely – whether to introduce a more centralised structure or a federal-based one with a strong focus on fiscal control. Since the relevant representatives of the parties were not able to come to an understanding, they sought a decision from the Allies who decided to establish a “highly decentralised government with a weak central state” (Leaman, 1988, p. 38).\n\nThe initial set up of the federal states slightly changed over the following years. This might constitute important information for later analysis. In 1952, the states Baden, Württemberg-Hohenzollern (both under French occupation) and Württemberg-Baden (under US occupation) merged into one state – Baden-Württemberg. Saarland joined Germany in 1957 since, according to the Saarland constitution, it was connected to France, at least from an economic perspective, politically there was no clear decision on its affiliation. A referendum decided on\n\nthe re-integration of this area into Germany. In the course of the introduction of democracy in the German Democratic Republic, the Ländereinführungsgesetz (state introduction law) re-introduced the federal states dissolved by the Soviet Union (Sturm, 2001, pp. 27f.). Table 4 shows an overview of the current federal states, its original occupation zone, and also when these states became part of the Federal Republic.\n\nName Year of entry Occupation zone\n\nBaden-Württemberg 1949 (1952) French / United States Bavaria 1949 United States Berlin Brandenburg Bremen 1949 (1990) French / United States / British / Soviet Union 1990 Soviet Union\n\n1949 United States\n\nHamburg Hesse 1949 1949 British United States\n\nMecklenburg-Vorpommern 1990 Lower Saxony 1949 Soviet Union British\n\nNorth Rhine-Westphalia 1949\n\nBritish Rhineland-Palatinate 1949 French Saarland 1957 (French)\n\nSaxony-Anhalt 1990\n\nSaxony Schleswig-Holstein\n\n1990 1949 Thuringia 1990 Soviet Union Soviet Union British Soviet Union\n\nSource: Author’s own elaboration based on: Sturm, R. (2001). Föderalismus in Deutschland. Opladen: Leske + Budrich, pp. 22, 28.\n\nThe German Unity not only has had an institutional impact on the German federalism but also has influenced the federal structures in a social and economic way. It was questioned whether the application of federalism in East Germany would guarantee a symmetric federalism, i.e., an equal treatment of the “new” federal states, especially since the prosperity gap between the West and the East was much higher than, for comparison, between the richest and the poorest West German federal state. The opinions are divided. Sturm (2001) states that the German federalism transformed into an asymmetric one after the unification (p. 32), whereas Alecke et al. (2010) summarise in their paper that since 1995\n\nno differences between the West and the East have been observed with regard to economic growth (p. 23).\n\nThe distribution of powers between the federal and federal state level is regulated in the German Grundgesetz (GG, in English: Basic Law). Article 30 GG implies that “Except as otherwise provided or permitted by this Basic Law, the exercise of state powers and the discharge of state functions is a matter for the Länder”. Furthermore, article 70(2) GG refers to the relevant competencies: “The division of authority between the Federation and the Länder shall be governed by the provisions of this Basic Law concerning exclusive and concurrent legislative powers”.\n\nArticles 71 to 74 GG specify under which circumstances and for which areas exclusive and concurrent legislative power are applicable. With reference to exclusive legislative power, federal states are allowed to amend legislation only when they are authorised to do so by the Basic Law (Art. 71 GG). Exclusive legislation among other things applies to “currency, money and coinage” (Art. 73(1), item 4 GG) as well as “the unity of the customs and trading area, treaties regarding commerce and navigation, the free movement of goods, and the exchange of goods and payments with foreign countries, including customs and border protection” (Art. 73(1), item 5 GG). The concurrent legislative power is applicable for “trades” (Art. 74(1), item 11 GG) if “the Federation has not exercised its legislative power by enacting a law” (Art. 72(1) GG).\n\nWhat is also of significant importance is the independent budgeting of each state and the Federation (Art. 109(1) GG). However, each party is responsible for ensuring the “economic equilibrium” (Art. 109(2) GG).\n\nMünch and Laufer (1988) summarise these circumstances in such a way that the distribution of powers cannot be assigned to one specific party. Furthermore, in some cases the federal level can make decisions on its own, in other cases cooperation between the federation and the federal states might be required. It does even happen that agreements are made between the federal states themselves, referred to as the “third level”. As a consequence, such a system is not very transparent in relation to responsibilities (pp. 140f.). Overall, the federal states are in charge of the law enforcement, which covers administration, rather than legislation (Münch & Laufer, 1988, p. 133).\n\n3.6. Summary\n\nThe difference between economics and politics is that economics deals with the organisation of a society whereas politics focuses on activities which affect the society’s decisions.\n\nBack in the 19th century, Germany was divided into territorial states and free cities with no common currency and no freedom to move or settle outside the respective territory. The first attempt to remove trade barriers was the creation of the Deutscher Zollverein, a customs union. The ongoing trade liberalisation was regarded with scepticism. At that time, the German economy underwent a complete transformation from agriculture towards the manufacturing industry: traditional jobs were replaced, factories created, and Germany was trading with Britain and the United States. The progress was possible due to the extension of the rail network and heavy industry, which allowed the distribution of coal where it was needed. Coal was the main means of settling payments for imported goods. The economic development was additionally supported by Germany’s dominating position in the chemical industry. To make internal German trade easier, the gold currency was introduced in the 1870s as the common currency.\n\nAfter winning the Franco-Prussian War (1870/71), the German states were united into the German Empire which received strategic regions and payments from France as war reparations. At that time the German Empire had the world monopoly in potash supply, which, along with the production of coal and iron, turned the country into one of the leading industrial nations.\n\nThe first stock market crash of 1873/74 in the United States also affected the German Empire but not for long. With its growing population, the German Empire stopped being self-sufficient, battling shortages of food for its own people and increasing its dependency on Russia and Austria-Hungary.\n\nThe era of colonialism/imperialism at the turn of the 19th and 20th century increased the German exports but the value of imports grew more quickly, leading to a negative balance of trade. The outbreak of World War I caused an even bigger demand for money, which meant that money press was used to counteract the currency devaluation all over the world.\n\nBy the end of World War I, the Treaty of Versailles declared Germany to be guilty and demanded that areas important for the country’s economic success were demarcated. Having lost the ability to produce goods for exports and in the face of the obligation to pay reparations for the war damages, the German economy suffered from recession. The end of World War I marks the end of the German Empire and the gold currency and the start of the Weimar Republic.\n\nAfter the downturn, there was a short period of prosperity, the “Golden Twenties”, before the Great Depression occurred in 1929. The German economy could recover due to the introduction of the Dawes Plan and the Rentenmark, the new German currency, which made the people trust in the stability of its value. However, as a result of the Great Depression, foreign money was\n\nwithdrawn from German banks which thus became illiquid as they had granted unsecured loans.\n\nDuring the 1920s, Hitler, supported and financed by leading businessmen, gained more and more influence, finally winning the elections in 1933. In 1934, he announced the Third Reich and himself its Chancellor. After the successful implementation of his first four-year plan as the number of unemployed people decreased, the second one was introduced to achieve a self-sufficient Third Reich. In the meantime, the process of “Gleichschaltung” came into effect. Foreign trade was completely regulated, promoting exports and only importing what was in accordance with set priorities and provided there was sufficient foreign currency available. To increase cash reserves, German products were sold below production costs.\n\nBy 1936, the Third Reich achieved the conditions of the economic “magic square” – economic growth, low inflation, high employment and a healthy balance of payments. Two years later, the Reich’s balance sheets were negative due to increased spending on armaments. To change this situation and to keep the people’s support, strategically interesting countries were annexed. The demand for more money was solved with money press which Hitler approved since he was sure that he would be able to impose these costs on the subdued countries. In 1945, Germany surrendered, and Hitler committed suicide.\n\nThe first four years after World War II were characterised by a low level of investments, lack of access to raw materials, a damaged transport system and a Germany split into four occupation zones which were administered by the four Allied powers – the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the USSR. The United States realised that a European recovery only made sense if Germany was not excluded. Following that, they first created the Bizone with the United Kingdom before France joined them in order to form a West German State – the Federal Republic of Germany. The USSR created its own German state – the German Democratic Republic.\n\nBefore the creation of the Federal Republic of Germany, the respective Allies carried out a currency reform; the Basic Law which is still valid today and the social market economy were introduced. West Germany enjoyed an “economic miracle” which made it possible for it to compete with the world again. In the 1950s and 1960s, West Germany entered several trade organisations some of which exist until today. West Germany was one of the founders in some of them. It also benefited from the growing fear that the Western powers felt towards the Eastern bloc.\n\nOn the contrary, the Eastern part of Germany under the Soviets control was being integrated into the socialistic planned economy. It was forced to provide\n\nits outputs to the Soviet Union as trade within the bloc had the highest priority. Thus, East Germany did not enjoy any right of self-determination\n\nWith the split of the German state, in both areas new factories were needed as there was no access to the ones from the other part. The respective central banks managed to service internal German trade, facilitating transactions with “Swings” and interest-free overdraft. Furthermore, it was agreed that trade between the German states should not be considered as foreign trade and should be custom-free. However, the traded volume never achieved the volume before the split, mainly due to East Germany’s obligation towards the USSR. Hence, the interest-free overdraft was generally used by the German Democratic Republic.\n\nAfter the re-unification, the German Democratic Republic accepted the currency of the Federal Republic of Germany and agreed to adopt the economic, monetary and social legislation. However, East German producers not only struggled to keep up with the West German standards because of outdated production processes but also lost their main trading partner.\n\nThe German state is characterised by federalism as indicated in its official name Federal Republic of Germany, which means that separate states are united but are granted autonomy to maintain their own integrity. This mode goes back to the time when Germany was divided into occupation zones. The Western Allied powers agreed on this concept for two reasons. Firstly, it was easier for them to maintain the required administration by making decisions based on local needs and requirement. Secondly, German people have always had a dual sense of belonging as the German state has been formed out of various ethnicities. However, the split was executed in an arbitrary way without considering the historical context.\n\nAfter the re-integration of East Germany into the Federal Republic of Germany, the question arose whether the East German states were treated equally, especially since the disproportions in wealth between the West and the East were visible.\n\nSwitching to the legal context, the distribution of power between the federal and federal state level is regulated in the German Grundgesetz (Basic Law). Matters regarding currency, trading areas, trade treaties, free movement of goods, and the exchange of goods including customs belong to the scope of the Federal Republic, however federal states have concurrent legislative power regarding trade. Furthermore, they are responsible for their own budgeting and need to take care of the “economic equilibrium”. Generally, the distribution of powers cannot be assigned to one specific party and depends on the case under consideration."
