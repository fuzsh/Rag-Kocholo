After receiving the unanimous approval of the Reparation Commission the reports of the experts were accepted by the German Government and favorably received by the Governments of the Allied Countries as offering a practical basis for a solution of the problem of reparations. In view of the importance of these reports, which are reprinted in full elsewhere in this issue, the present review summarizes the proposed program of action contained in the recommendations of the committee on budget and currency. Under its terms of reference this committee was to consider \"means of balancing the German budget and the measures to be taken to stabilize its currency.\" The essential features of the plan recommended by the committee are a schedule of reparation payments to be made by Germany directly out of taxation and through the imposition of a mortgage debt upon German railways and industry; the separation of collections in Germany, for which the German Government is to be held responsible, from the transfer of funds abroad, which is to be controlled by a committee representing the Allies whose function it will be to make the maximum transfers consistent with maintenance of exchange stability; the establishment of a new bank of issue to unify and stabilize German currency; and the flotation of a foreign loan intended to assist in the establishment of the No. 5 MAY, 1924 bank and in enabling Germany to meet her most urgent immediate obligations. The committee regards its proposal as one indivisible whole and considers it essential to its successful operation that the report be adopted in its entirety. It furthermore points out that while the plan does n o t \" attempt a solution of the whole reparation problem, it foreshadows a settlement extending in its application for a sufficient time to restore confidence, and at the same time is so framed as to facilitate a final and comprehensive agreement as to all the problems of reparation and connected questions as soon as circumstances make this possible.\" In considering the conditions essential to the restoration of Germany's credit and the establishment and maintenance of stability in bud<get and currency, the committee based its report on the assumption that the fiscal and economic unity of Germany will be restored. Furthermore, the committee recognizes that Germany's present financial conditions are such that reparation payments can be made from her ordinary budget revenues only after a period of recuperation. The report says: \"At the time of our investigation Germany was passing through an acute economic crisis, the direct result and the culminating point of a depreciation of the currency so catastrophic as practically to destroy the currency and reduce the budget to all but a shadow. The habit of saving has been destroyed and it will require time and the restoration of confidence to reestablish it. The existing wealth is maldistributed in an almost unparalleled degree. The cessation of depreciation, with the consequent removal of the premium on exports and the stabilization of prices at a level which is momentarily, at any rate, above that of the world level, has had 325 326 MAT, 1924 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN important reactions. Finally, the state of employment and the fiscal and economic machinery of Germany have been violently deranged by the events of 1923. A return to normal conditions in this respect can not be effected overnight.\" In its analysis of the problem of stabilization of the German currency and balancing the German budget, the committee distinguishes sharply between the two phases of the problem, the amount of revenue Germany can make available for the reparation account and the amount which can be transferred to foreign countries. Since the probable amount of the budget surplus and other collections on reparation account can be more definitely estimated than the amount which can be made available for payments abroad, the report presents a schedule of annual payments over a series of years, but does not undertake to estimate the amounts that can be converted into foreign currencies without causing instability of exchange. The limits within which pay. ments can be made abroad are defined as follows: \"The funds raised and transferred to the Allies on the reparation account can not in the long run exceed the sums which the balance of payments makes it possible to transfer without currency and budget instability ensuing.\" The entire plan rests upon this distinction between the collections in Germany on reparation account, which are measured by the German taxpayers' capacity to pay, and the transfer of funds to the Allies, the volume of which depends in the final analysis on Germany's balance of international payments. The committee, in view of its terms of reference, did not undertake to determine the total amount of reparation pay- ° f ments ' bufc w o r k e d o u t a P lan transition, with a gradual increase of payments to the fifth year, when the amount to be paid reaches a standard total. During the first two years no payments are to be made out of ordinary budget receipts; in the following years the payments from this source are increased so that in the standard year the budget furnishes one-half of the total payments. The plan further provides for a foreign loan and for the collection of interest upon a mortgage indebtedness to be placed on German railroads and industry. Essential deliveries in kind are to continue and their value is to be included each year in the total of payments prescribed by the plan. The amounts which it is estimated Germany will be in a position to pay during the periods of recuperation and transition and the standard amounts specified for subsequent years are given in the following schedule, which designates the several sources from which the funds are to be derived. Provision is made for modification of the amounts set forth in the schedule during the third and fourth years in accordance with the yield of certain controlled revenues and for additions to the standard payments to be determined by an index of prosperity.

The first during the two years of refour years of the operation of the plan are cuperation or so-called budget moratorium. regarded as a period of recuperation and I t is a requirement of the plan, however, that MAT, 192'4 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN for these two years, taken as a whole, ordinary revenues and expenditures shall balance. In the third year the budget is expected to contribute 110,000,000 gold marks, in the fourth year 500,000,000 marks, and in the fifth and subsequent years 1,250,000,000 marks, which constitutes one-half of the total standard payment. The contributions of the budget to reparation payments are to be secured by the control and supervision of revenues derived from taxes on tobacco, alcohol, sugar, and beer, and from customs receipts. During the transition period, the third and fourth years, provision is made for increases and decreases in payments within the limit of 250,000,000 marks, dependent upon the yield of these controlled revenues. It is estimated that these revenues will yield in the standard year over 2,000,000,000 marks, against which reparation payments will be a first charge. Any excess of yield over this charge will be available to the German Government for ordinary expenditures. Beyond indicating the total amounts to be paid from budget and the guarantees provided by the controlled revenues, the committee does not undertake to prescribe methods of raising revenue, but Germany is left free to devise such fiscal arrangements as seem best adapted to her conditions. The committee does, however, commend to the German Government certain methods of taxation which have been worked out by technical experts. A proposed foreign loan of 800,000,000 gold marks is to be the chief source of reparation payment during the first year. This loan is intended to \"serve the double purpose of assuring currency'stability and financing essential deliveries in kind during the preliminary period of economic rehabilitation.\" The relation of this loan to the proposed bank of issue and its use as a basis of currency stabilization is considered later in this review. Other proposed sources of payment are interest on railroad and industrial bonds, the sale of railway preference shares, and the transport tax. The committee places upon the German railroads a total valuation of 26,000000,000 gold marks, and against this total its 327 plan provides for the issue of 11,000,000,000 of mortgage bonds, 2,000,000,000 of preference shares, and 13,000,000,000 of common stock. The mortgage bonds, which shall be guaranteed by the German Government, are to be turned over to the Reparation Commission and are to bear in the standard year a rate of interest of 5 per cent and an amortization charge of 1 per cent. The income from these bonds, which increases during the first four years, is the principal source of payments during these years. Of the preference shares, one-fourth is to be turned over to the German Government and threefourths to a company which is to take over the operation of the railroads. This company is to be administered by a board of directors representing the Reparation Commission, the German Government, and the holders of the preference shares. From the sale of its preference shares the Government is to make reparation payments in the second year amounting to 500,000,000 marks, and in case the sale of these shares fails to yield this amount the deficit is to be made up by an internal loan. The common stock is to be issued to the German Government, which will have authority to hold the stock or to sell it, as it prefers. Through redemption of the bonds and the repurchase of the preference shares the plan provides a means for the German Government ultimately to regain control of the railroads. Upon German industry the plan places a mortgage amounting to 5,000,000,000 gold marks, to be represented by bonds, the burden to be distributed among individual concerns and guaranteed by the Government. The yield of these bonds in the standard year (5 per cent interest plus 1 per cent amortization) is to be a source of reparation payments beginning with the second year. The tax now levied on railroad transportation is retained and, beginning with the third year, is to be a direct source of reparation payments up to 290,000,000 marks. Total payments under the schedule, as shown in the table, are to increase from 1,000,000,000 gold marks in the first year to 2,500,000,000 gold marks in the standard year. 328 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN A guiding principle used by the committee in determining this schedule of annual payments Commensu- was that the German people rate taxation should bear a burden of taxation as heavy as that borne by the peoples of the allied countries—the principle of commensurate taxation. This principle, which is considered just in its application to Germany, is also deemed to be economically desirable, because it tends toward competitive equality in international trade between Germany and the Allies. The placing of a mortgage debt of 16,000,000,000 marks upon German railroads and industry is in recognition of the fact that all bonded indebtedness in Germany has been virtually extinguished through the fall of the mark. Railroads and industry, which through the depreciation of the German currency have been relieved of a large part of their burden of bonded indebtedness to investors, are to contribute under this plan to currency and fiscal restoration and to reparation payments through the assumption of a mortgage debt to the Separation Commission. Interest payments on this mortgage debt into reparation account will under the plan take the place of the annual interest charges which were borne by German enterprises in the years before inflation. No mortgage debt is placed upon agriculture, but it is recommended that the German Government, in case it deems it desirable, impose such a mortgage in favor of the regular budget. Certain obligations, it may be noted, have already been imposed upon agricultural land through the levy which guarantees the rentenmarks. Two considerations are indicated by the committee which might lead to a modification of the annual totals specified in the schedule— growth of industrial prosperity and changes in the value of gold. For the purpose of enabling the Allies to share in the growth of German industry and trade, an index of prosperity is proposed, which, after the first five years, may indicate variable additions to the standard payments on reparation account. Thus the payments, instead of being modified by changes in the value of exports alone as is contemplated MAT, 1924 under existing arrangements, will under the proposed plan increase in accordance with a composite index based upon statistics of railway traffic, population growth, total foreign trade, consumption of tobacco, sugar, beer, and alcohol, budget expenditures (excluding reparation payments), and per capita consumption of coal. There is no provision for decreasing the standard payments on the basis of the prosperity index, but in case it indicates a reduced capacity for payment in any year the amount of the deficiency is to be deducted from any future supplementary payment based on the index. A further modification is provided for on the basis of changes in the value of gold which, in case they exceed 10 per cent of its value in 1928, may result in future years in a corresponding increase or decrease of annual reparation payments. A more important factor in its possible effect upon total reparation payments is the provision which places a defiTransfer of nite limit upon the accumulafunds to Allies tion of reparation funds in Germany in excess of the amount that can be transferred abroad without resulting in undue fluctuation of exchanges. In case collections on reparation account are in excess of what Germany's balance of payments will make it possible to remit to the Allies, a limit is placed upon the accumulation of reparation funds in Germany. Up to 2,000,000,000 marks these funds, which are to be deposited in the new bank of issue, may be used in short-term credit operations in Germany. If the accumulation continues beyond this amount and up to 5,000,000,000 marks, the funds may be used by the Allies in Germany in the purchase of bonds and other forms of investment. When, however, the total amount of these funds reaches 5,000,000,000 marks provision is made for a decrease of payments out of the budget and the transport tax and for their discontinuance to the extent that transfers can not be effected. Even before the funds accumulated reach this total the payments may be modified if in the judgment of the transfer committee it appears that MAY, 1924 FEDERAL, RESERVE BULLETIN further accumulation is a menace to the fiscal or economic situation of Germany or to the creditor countries. In case the transfer committee discovers concerted financial maneuvers by the Government or by individuals to prevent the transfer, the transfer committee may undertake whatever measures are necessary to defeat these maneuvers and is authorized under these circumstances to accumulate funds beyond the limit of 5,000,000,000 marks. In discussing the relation between collection—that is, the German taxpayers' capacity to pay—and remittance abroad—-that is, Germany's capacity to pay the Allies—recognition is made in the report of the fact that the amount that can be paid abroad by means of an economic surplus in international trade is \"by comparison with the budget, incapable of close calculation, 'unmanageable', and too elastic. But limits set by economic balance, if impossible of exact determination, are real. For stability of a country's currency to be permanently maintained, not only must her budget be balanced but her earnings from abroad must be equal to the payments she must make abroad, including not only payments for goods she imports but sums paid in reparation. Nor can balance of the budget itself be permanently maintained except on the same conditions.\" Thus the amount which the exchange position makes it possible for the Allies to transfer not only limits the receipts to the Allies on reparation account but also ultimately places a limit upon the collections to be made in Germany. Faced with this limitation the committee does not undertake to make a definite estimate of the amount which can be transmitted, but makes the volume of transfers depend upon the actual exchange situation as it develops in experience. Reference has already been made to the proposed bank of issue, which is to serve as „ , ,. the depositary of reparation Bank of issue , n . , • vT lunds collected in Germany and is regarded by the committee as an essential agency for the creation of a unified and stable currency. Establishment of the Rentenbank, through which the recent stability of 329 German currency has been brought about, is viewed by the committee as not affording, in the absence of other measures, an adequate guaranty of permanent stabilization. Such stability the committee believes is essential to the maintenance of a balanced budget and the restoration of German credit. The committee provides safeguards that reparation payments will not lead to instability of exchange through the control it places in the hands of the transfer committee, and proposes to maintain the gold value of the domestic currency by means of the establishment of the new bank of issue and through the limitations placed upon its note-issuing power. The bank is to perform the usual functions of a central bank and may, in fact, be established through a reorganization of the Reiehsbank. The capital of the bank is to be 400,000,000 gold marks, of which one-fourth is to represent the fixed assets of the Reichsbank and the remainder is to be offered for sale in Germany and abroad. The bank is to have the exclusive right, with certain minor qualifications, to issue notes, and all other notes now in circulation are to be gradually withdrawn. Against these notes the bank is required to maintain a normal reserve of 33J per cent in gold and gold credits with foreign banks. The purpose is to keep the currency stable in relation to gold, stable foreign exchange, and as soon as conditions will permit to place it upon a convertible basis. Against its demand deposits the bank is to maintain a reserve of 12 per cent in gold, with certain further provisions regarding liquidity of assets. The bank is intended to be primarily a bankers' bank, though it may make loans directly to the public, with safeguards as to type and maturity of paper to be discounted. It is to be the fiscal agent of the German Government, but entirely free from governmental control, and its power to lend to the Government and to State enterprises is strictly limited. It is contemplated that the new bank of issue, which will either supersede the Reichsbank or be the outcome of a reorganization of that bank, will absorb the recently organized 330 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN gold discount bank (the so-called Schacht Bank). This latter bank is considered an interim arrangement expressly limited to providing the means of carrying on foreign trade and thus supplementing the Rentenbank, whose operations and currency issues are limited to domestic trade. According to the committee's plan, the Eentenbank is to be liquidated. With the passing of the Rentenbank and the absorption of the gold discount bank, the new bank of issue is intended through its operation at home and abroad to take over the functions which at present are performed by both of these institutions. Provision is made in the plan for machinery to administer the bank of issue and the railroads, and for the establishProposed ad- m e n t of a transfer committee. mimstrative ma- . , . . , chinery Administrative arrangements with reference to the bank proTide for an organization committee consisting of the president of the Reichsbank and one member of the committee of experts; and after its establishment a general board of 14 members, 7 elected by German stockholders and 7 foreign members, representing the United States, Great Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, to be appointed by the organization committee, and later self-perpetuating. This board is to elect the president of the bank, who must be approved by the president of the Reich, and for the first six months of the bank's operation is to be the president of the Reichsbank. The board is to have general supervision of the operations of the bank, and the actual administration is to be in charge of a managing board to consist of German nationals appointed by the president, subject to the approval of the general board and the president of the Reich. In addition the general board shall elect a banking commissioner to supervise the maintenance of reserves and the issue and redemption of notes. The railroads are to be operated by a board of 18 directors, 9 of whom are to be appointed by the trustee of the mortgage bonds and 9 by the German Government. After the sale of the preference shares the holders of these shares will elect four directors and the Government MAT, 1924 will appoint five. Of the directors appointed by the trustee, five may be of German nationality. The chairman of the board and the general manager shall be Germans. The foreign members of the board of directors will select the commissioner of railways who is to exercise active supervision over the operations of the roads, and in case the railways fail to yield net revenues sufficient to meet the required reparation payments, is to take over the functions of the general manager. The Reparation Commission will appoint a trustee of bonds and a commissioner of controlled revenues. The trustee will receive and hold the railway and industrial bonds and will have charge of the sale of these bonds and the collection of interest payments. The duty of the commissioner of controlled revenues will be to supervise the reparation payments out of budget, and in case of default to take complete charge of the controlled revenues. All operations in connection with the transfer of funds to the Allies and the investment in Germany of accumulated funds are to be in charge of a transfer committee appointed by the Reparation Commission. With this committee will rest the decision to suspend collections when the funds exceed the stated limit of 5,000,000,000 marks. This committee will include in its membership the agent for reparation payments, who is to be the principal representative of the Reparation Commission and is to coordinate the activities of all the agencies proposed by the plan. Funds arising from the proposed foreign loan of 800,000,000 gold marks, to which reference Foreign loan has been made in connection with the first year's reparation payments, will be deposited in the bank to the credit of the German Government and will constitute a contribution to its reserves and thus enlarge the basis of its currency issues. The loan will also help to overcome the acute shortage of liquid funds in Germany and will assist in meeting her immediate and more urgent obligations to the Allies, particularly in making payments in Germany for goods to be delivered on reparation account. In commenting upon the credit position of Germany in connection with the proposed for- MAY, 1924 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN eign loan and upon the use to be made of the funds thus raised, the report states that—• \"A considerable sum can certainly be raised upon the good security that the plan provides, with a clear prospect of improved international political position and of stability. \" The question is, therefore, whether the claims upon Germany can be so reduced by agreement among the allied creditors as to come within this potential credit. If they can, then obviously the greater the reduction the more moderate the sum to be .raised, and the greater the probability of Germany successfully raising a loan. If not, then the loan will not be forthcoming, stability can not be insured, and neither this plan nor any other can come into being. \" The successful launching of the scheme depends, therefore, upon three main factors: (1) Limitation of payments for all purposes to 1,000,000,000 gold marks, of which at least 800,000,000 must be spent in Germany for the first year, and thereafter to such sums as are available under the plan during the succeeding years; (2) cooperation between the Allies and Germany in securing political conditions which will incline the investors of the world favorably toward the German loan upon good security; (3) a loan of 800,000,000 gold marks, which will serve the double purpose of assuring currency stability and financing essential deliveries in kind during the preliminary period of economic rehabilitation.\" Flotation of this external loan will be one of the first practical steps in the carrying out of the plan, after the acceptance u enc s t a C \" r : of the report by, the, Governbihzation and , • .„ reparations ments concerned, and will test the acceptability to the investing public of the security offered by the plan. 331 Banking credits of a short-term character have already been granted by New York and London bankers in connection with the recent establishment of the gold discount bank in Germany. The establishment of foreign credits as a means of stabilizing currency in relation to gold was the plan followed by a number of other European countries during the past year, and the results of this method of currency stabilization were described in the previous issue of the FEDERAL EESERVE BULLETIN. In effect these plans establish a gold exchange standard and may be regarded as constituting an intermediate arrangement between depreciating paper money with wide fluctuations in exchange and currency stability on the gold standard. Currency reforms undertaken in Europe have been in the direction of reestablishing the connection between domestic currencies and gold by linking them to stable foreign exchanges. In those countries whose budgetary position was not immediately affected by the payment of reparations, this method of currency reform has resulted in a greater stability of exchange. In Germany the balancing of the budget and the stabilization of the currency is complicated by reparation obligations, but in its proposals the committee has considered currency stability as essential to the restoration of German credit and has made the maintenance of stability a limiting factor upon the payment of reparations.

Distribution, both at wholesale and retail, showed less than the usual seasonal increase and was smaller than a year ago. Production.—The Federal Reserve Board's index of production in basic industries, adjusted to allow for length of month and other seasonal variations, declined 3 per cent in March. Output was reduced by most industries, and the decreases were particularly large in mill consumption of cotton and production of bituminous coal and copper. Daily average production of steel ingots, however, was larger than in any previous month. The level of factory employment was unchanged, but some curtailment in working hours was evidenced by a decline of 1 per cent in average weekly earnings. Contract awards for new buildings in March reached the the highest total value on record, owing chiefly to a large increase in the New York district. Estimates by the Department of Agriculture on the basis of condition on April 1 indicate a reduction of 4 per cent in the yield of winter wheat and of 6 per cent in the production of rye as compared with the final harvests in 1923. Trade.—Shipments of commodities by railroads declined each week in March and car loadings were 4 per cent less than a year ago. Wholesale trade increased slightly during March, but was 8 per cent less than a year ago owing to decreases in sales of dry goods, shoes, and hardware. March sales of department stores were 8 per cent less than in March, 1923, and merchandise stocks at the end of the month were 8 per cent larger than a year ago. Sales of mail-order houses also showed less than the usual seasonal increase in March. Decrease in the volume of purchases at retail compared with last year is partly accounted for by the late Easter and the generally unfavorable weather conditions. Prices.—Wholesale prices, as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics index, decreased slightly more than 1 per cent in March and were 6 per cent lower than a year ago. Prices of farm products, foods, clothing, chemicals, and house furnishings declined, building materials remained unchanged, while fuel and metals were slightly higher than in February. During the first three weeks of April quotations on pig iron, lead, coal, silk, and sugar declined, while prices of wheat, corn, and cotton advanced.

March Latest figures Bank credit.—Volume of borrowing for commercial purposes at member banks in leading cities, after increasing during the early part of the year, remained constant at a high level between the middle of March and the middle of April. During the four-week period total loans of these banks were in larger volume than at any time in more than two years. Discounts and investments of the Federal reserve banks, which on April 2 were slightly above $1,000,000,000, declined by about $125,000,000 during the first three weeks in April to the lowest point for the year. This decline represents a reduction in discounts and in the holdings of acceptances, while the volume of Government securities increased somewhat. Money rates in the New York market during the first three weeks in April were at about the same level as in the latter part of March. Prime commercial paper was quoted at 4J per cent and 90-day bankers' acceptances at 4 per cent throughout the period. AGRICULTURE A decline in crop prices, a further slackening in marketing, and unsatisfactory weather in most sections for spring preparations were the outstanding factors influencing the agricultural situation in March. Contrary to the usual seasonal movement, crop prices declined in March and were 2 per cent lower than in February, but compared with March a year ago they were slightly higher. The total volume of agricultural products marketed in March was 15 per cent smaller than in February and, largely on account of the heavy decline in the movement of grain, distribution was smaller than a year ago. Receipts of livestock, animal products, and cotton, sales of tobacco, and shipments of fruits decreased, while shipments of vegetables showed the usual seasonal increase. Rains and cold weather seriously delayed farm operations in almost all districts, and spring preparations and plantings are reported to be from two to three weeks late in the Richmond and Atlanta districts and in parts of the St. Louis district. In the San Francisco district the rains were generally beneficial, and in the drought areas they afforded considerable relief and greatly improved the agricultural prospects. Early in April more favorable weather was reported from all districts, and farm work was progressing rapidly. While the low temperatures which prevailed in March retarded outdoor operations, they were favorable to the fruit crops. Buds were retarded and the potential damage from cold was lessened. The supply of farm labor on April 1 was practically the same as a year ago, bijt the demand was less than in the previous season and the supply was 92 per cent of the demand. Grain On April 1 the condition of winter wheat was 83 per cent of normal, compared with 75 per cent a year ago, but improvement was not reported for all districts. In the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis districts, where consideiable damage had been reported 334 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN from unsatisfactory weather during the winter months, the condition was decidedly below that of a year ago. The crop in the Kansas City, Dallas, and sections of the San Francisco districts was generally well protected during the winter, and the condition on April 1 showed great improvement over a year ago. Despite the better average condition of the crop, the acreage sown was smaller than in the previous season, and the yield is estimated at 549,415,000 bushels, a 4 per cent reduction from the final harvest in 1923. The average condition of the rye crop was higher than a year ago, but the estimated yield is 6 per cent smaller than the 1923 production, whicn is also due to a curtailment in acreage. Under favorable weather conditions during the closing weeks in March and early in April, spring wheat seedings progressed rapidly in all sections. Oat seeding was practically comleted as far north as Missouri by the end of the rst week in April and work was advancing satisfactorily in the areas of the Chicago and Minneapolis districts, although it was somewhat later than usual in some sections of these districts. Corn planting has been delayed in all districts, but the early seeded corn in the Gulf States is in good condition. The marketing of all grains declined in March and was 25 per cent smaller than in February. With the exception of corn, all grains were distributed in smaller volume than in March a year ago. While bad weather is reported to have retarded marketing at primary markets, receipts were probably affected by price declines in March, which were noted for all grains except barley. Exports of grain since the beginning of the crop year have been considerably less than in the preceding season, as shown in the table. E MAY, growing areas. The low temperatures lessened the potential damage by the boll weevils and the rainfall was sufficient to put the soil in good condition. Since the beginning of spring, however, the wet weather has continued in sections of the Richmond and Atlanta districts, and the season is from ten days to two weeks late. In sections of the St. Louis and Dallas districts conditions have been more favorable, and plantings are progressing rapidly, especially in Texas. Reports indicate that more fertilizers are being used than in 1923 and that a greater effort is being made to combat the weevils with poison and intensive cultivation. Marketing of the old crop showed a further seasonal decline in March. Sight receipts were 12 per cent less than in February and 19 per cent smaller than a year ago. Spinners' takings, on the other hand, which are usually smaller in March than in February, increased 10 per cent, but compared with March, 1923, they were 26 per cent smaller. Domestic consumption of cotton continued to decline in March from the corresponding month a year ago and the total consumption since the beginning of the crop year is nearly 9 per cent below that of the previous season. Exports, on the other hand, have continued in large volume and are 16 per cent greater than a year ago. At the end of December domestic consumption of cotton was 6 per cent smaller and exports were 15 per cent larger than in the previous season. Since that time the domestic consumption has been decreasing at a greater rate than in the autumn, but exports have been larger than a year ago. The following table shows the monthly consumption and exports of raw cotton and the percentage change from the corresponding periods a year earlier.

Activity in the manufactured-tobacco industry Was well maintained in March. Production of all products was seasonally larger than in February, but only small cigars and cigarettes were produced in larger volume than in March a year ago. The demand for cigars was better in April than in March, but not as good as a year ago. Prices are generally firm and stocks are moderate. Tobacco Fruit With the exception of slight damage by late freezes and frosts to the deciduous fruit crops in the southern portion of Arizona and to the peach crop hi sections of the Dallas, Kansas City, and St. Louis districts, weather conditions were generally satisfactory during March and the first weeks in April for the fruit-growing industry. In fact, the late spring in the eastern States delayed budding and thereby lessened the potential damage from cold and frost. Citrus groves in Florida and California continued in good condition. The total volume of fruit marketed in March was smaller than in February, but it was slightly larger than in March a year ago. Although the shipments of apples were seasonally smaller than in February, they were in considerably larger volume than last year. Coldstorage holdings of apples on March 1 amounted to 5,966,000 barrels, compared with 3,090,000 barrels at the same period a rear ago. Citrus fruit shipments from Florida or the season through March were larger than in 1923, but the movement from Cali- ? 40 20 20 19Z1 192A1923 1322 Monthly average prices, 1921-1924, of sheep, cattle, and hogs at principal markets, reduced to relatives with 1913 monthly average price as 100 decided improvement was evident in the Dallas district and the southern sections of the Kansas City and San Francisco districts. Ranges and stock in most of the principal States were in much better condition on April 1 than a year earlier and the outlook for both the cattle and sheep industry is better than it has been in recent years. The spring movement of livestock from the Dallas district to the long-grass areas farther north began early in April, but with the improvement of the ranges and better feed conditions in that district the transfer is expected to be light. In 336 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN some sections of Texas the ranges are understocked and rather than supply them at the present time there is a tendency among many cattlemen to increase cotton planting on them. In February the foot-and-mouth disease was detected in California and by late in March it had spread into a considerable area, and strenuous efforts are being made by the State of California and the Federal Government to combat the further spreading of the disease. All animals except calves were marketed in fewer numbers in March than in February, and for the first time since April, 1922, hog receipts were smaller than for the corresponding month in the previous year. This decrease in hog receipts was very significant and reflected the tendency of the producers to curtail the supplies. Since the beginning of the year livestock prices have been rising, and in March the highest levels were reached since November. Reduced marketing and a continuation of a fairly active demand in March were two of the principal factors affecting the industry. Compared with recent years the outstanding fact has been the increase in lamb prices. While cattle prices are still low, they have increased in recent months and are higher now than a year ago. The large supply of hogs has depressed prices, but producers have been compensated to some extent by increased production. Detailed changes in the prices of cattle, hogs, and sheep are shown in the chart. Dairy products A seasonal expansion in the production of butter and cheese began in March and the total output was greater than in March a year ago. Distribution, on the other hand, as indicated by receipts at five principal consuming centers, declined and was in smaller volume than last March. As a result of smaller receipts than in February, cold-storage holdings were reduced to the lowest levels since July, 1923. Although a decline in the stocks in March is a seasonal occurrence, it is significant that supplies were considerably heavier on April 1 than a year ago. Prices of butter have declined continuously since the beginning of the year, and quotations for 92 score creamery butter at New York reached a low point of 36.5 cents on April 18, as compared with 47.5 cents a month earlier. Receipts of milk in the New York market increased in March and amounted to 3,124,000 cans, an increase of 14 per cent over February and 8 per cent over March a year ago. The Department of Agriculture reports that the dairy industry has expanded to a point MAT, 1924 where gross domestic production exceeds gross domestic consumption, and evidences of a continuation in the expansion are reflected in the gradual increase in the number of dairy cattle, which totaled 24,765,000 head on January 1, 1924, the largest number in the history of the country. MINING Coal and coke Inactivity continued to prevail in coal markets during April, and production and prices of bituminous coal reached new low records. Mine operations were curtailed considerably throughout March and April, and in the week ending April 12 daily, average output was the smallest, with the exception of the period of the 1922 strike, since the low point of the depression in the spring of 1921. Estimated production for March totaled only 39,909,000 tons, the smallest figure recorded for that month in any year, excepting 1921 and 1919, since 1915. The Coal Age index of bituminous coal prices in the week of April 21 fell to $2.04, the lowest point reached since 1916. Despite these low prices, contracts which expired on April 1 have not yet been renewed to any appreciable extent. Several railroads have signed contracts, but industrial consumers are either using up their stocks or buying for immediate needs in the spot market. On April 1 producers announced reductions in anthracite prices of about 50 cents a ton on domestic sizes and 25 to 50 cents for steam sizes. Many retail dealers made further reductions. Customers who had kept out of the market in March awaiting this announcement have since made purchases. Demand consequently improved somewhat, but was reported to be under expectations considering that the lower prices were announced only for the month of April. Production is well maintained and many mines are producing at capacity. March output totaled 8,114,000 tons. This was larger than for any month since last October, but at a lower rate than during last spring. Production of both beehive and by-product coke in March totaled more than in any month since early last fall. More recently, however, the decreased demand from iron and steel sources has been reflected in output. Buying in April was comparatively light and the weekly production of beehive coke declined from 316,000 tons in the week ending March 22 to 266,000 tons three weeks later. Prices of coke were reduced considerably about the middle MAY, 1924 337 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN of April and a new minimum of $3.40 for comparison^: the production and consumption of petroleum is shown in the accompanying standard furnace coke was established. chart.

Silver production aggregated 5,727,000 ounces, the largest monthly output since the cessation of purchases under the Pittman Act in May, 1923. MANUFACTURING Food products An increase in the production of wheat flour and sugar and a decrease in the output of meat products were the principal factors which characterized the food-product industries in March. The production of wheat flour was 3 per cent greater than in February and with the exception of March, 1923, it was greater than in any March on record. The decline in the price of wheat during the month created a dull flour market, as buyers became more cautious than they had been earlier in the year. Following the price of wheat, flour quotations fluctuated widely during the month and reached a low point in the week ending March 28. During the first three weeks of April prices remained unchanged at about the same level as was evident in the middle of March. The new tariff on wheat and mill products went into effect on April 7, but it is too early to trace any influence which it has had on prices. Although the production of sugar in March showed a seasonal increase over the preceding month, it was smaller than in March, 1923. In spite of the smaller output in March than a year ago, the total volume produced since the beginning of the year has been greater than in the preceding season and stocks on hand are slightly larger than last year. The price of both raw and refined sugar declined almost continuously during the month, and on April 18 the price of raw sugar was 23 per cent and refined sugar 17 per cent below quotations a year ago. The production of meat products was smaller in March than in the preceding month or in March, 1923. While the decline from February was due in part to seasonal factors, the decrease from March a year ago was very significant in that it was the first month since April, 1922, that the volume of packing fell below the level of the corresponding month in the previous year. The decrease from the preceding year in the number of hogs slaughtered is further evidence that the enormously heavy marketing has passed its peak and the production of hogs is declining. Notwithstanding the slackening in the production of pork products, stocks increased further during MAT, 1924 the month, and on April 1 they were larger than in any April since 1920. This increase in stocks may be attributed in part to a decline in the volume of domestic sales and exports. Sales were also smaller than in March, 1923, and all pork products except hams and shoulders were exported in smaller volume than a year earlier. Textiles During March and April some improvement was noted in textile markets, but the volume of buying to date this year still falls far short of that for the same period last year. Orders continue to be largely restricted to current needs and prices are generally weak. Although this is ordinarily the season of high productive activity, operations in many lines have been curtailed and in others increases have not been as great as usual. A definite turn for the better was noted in cotton textile markets during the first week of April, following sharp declines during the last week of March in prices of both raw cotton and cotton goods to the lowest levels since last September. At that time percale prices were announced at 2 cents below previous quotations. Early in April, however, the price of raw cotton advanced, the market for cotton goods became more active, and for the first time in 13 weeks the Fairchild cotton-goods price index increased. Print-cloth sales in the Fall River market during that week totaled about 180,000 pieces, the largest figure recorded in several months. This increased activity, however, was short-lived as the market became irregular, and prices again fell. Mills in all sections of the country curtailed production during March and to a certain extent in April. Although a few mills increased operations at times during April, this appeared to be largely tentative or to supply some immediate demand. Mill consumption of cotton totaled 483,928 bales in March, as compared with 507,867 bales in February and 624,264 bales last March, the largest on record. Decreases occurred in practically every State. Active spindles and active spindle hours were fewer than in any month since July, 1922, and employment in cotton mills was smaller than at any time since the early fall of 1922. Cotton finishers reported March production, orders, and shipments to be less than those of February. In the woolen and worsted business, conditions remained without appreciable change during March and early April. Manufacturers generally refrained from purchasing raw wool, MAY, 1924 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN which is being reexported to foreign markets, where prices are higher, but after the middle of April some improvement in buying by large manufacturers was reported. The following table, giving imports and reexports for certain recent periods, shows how little wool came into this country and how much went out during the first quarter of this year as compared with the same period last year. Contracting in the west for the domestic clip has not been as active as it was last year, and prices this season have ranged somewhat lower. Prices in eastern markets have recently shown little change, being held down by inactive domestic demand and held iip by the higher prices prevailing abroad.

All manufacturers have opened their heavy-weight lines, but orders, although numerous, have been small and the total volume to date has fallen below that of last season. Clothing manufacturers, however, report that buying of recently opened fall lines of men's wear has been somewhat more favorable than was initial spring business. Late orders for spring goods also showed some increase, reflecting good business among retail clothiers. Prices on fall lines are at about the same level as those of last year. Despite the longer month, consumption of raw wool by manufacturers during March was slightly less than in February. The percentage of active hours increased in the case of cards and of woolen spindles, but active loom and worsted-spindle hours declined. Weakness still prevails in the demand for raw silk and silk goods. Prices of the former, which have fallen almost steadily since the earthquake last September, in April reached the lowest figure since the summer of 1921, the post-war low point. Owing to this decline and to poor demand, reductions have also been made in silk fabrics, ranging from 15 to 35 per cent since January 1. Although manufacturers have reduced operations considerably, 339 sales have fallen off still more, and stocks of goods are accumulating. Imports of raw silk, however, were reduced m March to the smallest figure since January, 1921, and warehouse stocks were cut down about 25 per cent. Deliveries to mills in March, although smaller than during the two preceding months and during the early months of last year, were nevertheless greater than during last fall. Statistics from mills in New Jersey show continued reductions in operations, and the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank reports that curtailment among Pennsylvania mills has increased. Orders for knit underwear during March, according to reports from 24 identical firms, were smaller than for any month in the last two years, and unfilled orders reached the lowest figure since September, 1922. Shipments and daily average production also declined. Prices are higher than a year ago and jobbers and retailers are generally purchasing only to fill immediate needs. Early in April prices were materially reduced on practical!}7 all lines of hosiery, one large manufacturer cutting quotations on a standard number from $13.85 to $12.60 a dozen. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank reports that these reductions have stimulated demand for full-fashioned silk hosiery for women and that novelties are in fair request, but other lines are inactive. Preliminary statistics show an increase in the production of full-fashioned hosiery in March as compared with February, but seamless output declined. On the other hand, orders for fullfashioned hose declined, whereas orders for seamless increased. Shipments were slightly larger. Iron and steel Decreased buying of iron and steel products, first noted during March, continued in April, prices were weak, and operations were curtailed. Production, however, continued unabated through March, and the daily average output of steel ingots for that month was the highest ever recorded. Shipments were reported to be somewhat larger than orders, and unfilled orders of the United States Steel Corporation fell off 130,094 tons to 4,782,807 tons. These orders have for some time been unusually small in relation to the large volume of output; evidently buyers have been purchasing large quantities of steel, but prompt shipments have removed the necessity of ordering far ahead of requirements. Operations during the third week in April were reported to be at about 80 340 FEDERAL BBSERVB BULLETIN per cent of capacity, as compared with an average of about 90 per cent in March. Eailroads continue to be active buyers. Orders for cars during the first three months of this year compare favorably with the large total for the same period of last year, as is shown by the chart on page 342. Reports indicate heavy buying in April also. Structural steel awards were estimated to total less in March than in February, but continued large, and a number of large contracts were let in April. The building industry is providing an active demand for many iron and steel products. Oil companies have also been purchasing more freely. Automobile manufacturers are generally marking time,\" awaiting the results of dealers' spring sales. Pig-iron demand has been rather dull, and the ore market is also quiet. Prices for Lake Superior ore have been established at 80 cents below last year's quotations and are the lowest since 1915. Iron Trade Review's composite iron and steel prices declined steadily during April and in the third week averaged $42.01, the lowest since February, 1923. Automobiles Automobile manufacturers continued operations throughout the winter at a high rate and stored cars in warehouses both at plants and with dealers that they might be prepared for spring sales. These large stocks, together with retardation of the selling season by unfavorable weather, made it unnecessary and in many cases undesirable for manufacturers to increase output as much in March as usual. In fact, many producers curtailed operations, and the increase in production from 366,683 passenger cars and trucks in February to 381,348 in March is accounted for by the larger number of working days in the later month. Since sufficient cars are on hand to care for any immediate rush of buying, future production is expected to be adjusted more closely to the volume of retail demand. Reports indicate a substantial increase in deliveries during the last 10 days of March and the first part of April. Deliveries to retailers by the largest producer in March totaled over 205,000 cars and trucks, of which a daily average of 10,800, were made in the last 10 days. These, together with data from other producers and statistics of railroad shipments, indicate that distribution of cars from factory to dealer during March and the first quarter of this year was greater than during the corresponding periods last year. On the other hand, reports MAY, 1924 from a number of dealers in the Middle West to the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank showed decreases as compared with March, 1923, of 1.5 per cent in sales by wholesalers, of 11 per cent in retail sales, and of 7 per cent in sales of used cars. Stocks of new cars at the end of the month were 66 per cent and of old cars 34 per cent larger than a year ago, and both were 5 per cent greater than at the end of February. Production of automobile tires and tubes during March was greater than in any month since last May. Shipments increased to a less extent, and stocks were enlarged during the month. Inventories of inner tubes were the largest since June of last year. Producers are prepared for an active season, but dealers' stocks are reported to be smaller than a year ago. Production of balloon tires is increasing, and they are being used to stimulate new business.

Manufacturers produced at an unusually high rate throughout the winter and are prepared to take care of a large demand. Production during the first 15 weeks of this year, according to statistics of the National Lumber Manufacturers' Association given in the table below, exceeded the high rate of output in the corresponding period of 1923 by about 8 per cent.

Statistics of contract awards and buildings permits, divided by classes of construction and geographical regions, are published on page 427. Shipments of building materials showed a seasonal increase during March, but continued to be smaller than current production, so that there was a further accumulation of stocks. Consumption of brick has been particularly large so far this year, due partly to changes in the fire laws of Chicago. The average price of building materials in March was the same as in February, but was 8 per cent lower than a year ago. TRANSPORTATION MAY, 1924 cent. The number of cars awaiting repairs was augmented by 3,966 during March. The accompanying chart shows in cumulative form the number of new freight cars ordered in the months of 1924 as compared with 1923. Orders placed in March were much smaller than in February or March, 1923, but the total orders for the first, quarter of 1924 were only slightly less than a year ago. Moreover, orders in the first three months of this year amounted to 60 per cent of the total orders for the year 1923. Net operating income of Class I carriers totaled $71,192,000 in February, the latest month for which information is available. This amounted to an annual rate of return of 6.28 per cent, according to the Bureau of Railway Economics, as compared with a 3.76 per cent rate of return in February, 1923. Southern railroads earned 7.6 per cent on their valuation as compared with 7.1 per cent for eastern railroads and 5 per cent for western railroads.

Shoe firms in both districts reported a substantial reduction in outstandings. Retail tirade 343 decreases ranging from 14 per cent in the Eichmond and Kansas City districts to 1 per cent in the San Francisco district. Reports from the Boston and New York districts indicate that sales of the shoe, women's and misses' ready-to-wear, men's and boys' wear, silk goods, fur, glove, and jewelry departments were substantially less than a year ago, whereas sales of furniture, cotton goods, and sporting goods showed some increase. Merchandise stocks at department stores increased somewhat more than usual during March and at the end of the month were 8 per cent larger than a year ago. The largest increases during the past month occurred in the Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, and Richmond districts. Statistics of wholesale and retail trade by lines and districts are published on pages 428 and 429. PRICES Sales of all reporting retail dealers, with the exception of cigar and candy chains, showed less than the usual seasonal increase in March. For the first time in almost two years a smaller volume of mail-order business was received than in the corresponding month of the immediately preceding year.

Outside employment in building construction and on farms has increased, but in many sections unfavorable weather during March prevented as great an increase as usual in these phases of activity. That the demand for labor did not show as great a growth during March as the supply is indicated by the decline in the board's index of the labor market from February to a point slightly below that reached last December. The greatest declines were noted in the States of New York, Illinois, and Wisconsin. Advances in the volume of factory employment in the iron and steel, building materials, and automobile industries were offset by recessions in textiles, food products, and railroad vehicles. Among the textiles, declines were noted in cotton goods, silk, and men's clothing, whereas increases occurred in knit goods and women's clothing, and the woolen and dyeing and finishing industries remained practically unchanged. Ice cream plants and bakeries reported increases in employment, but in meat packing and milling substantial declines took place. The cement, brick, and glass industries enlarged working forces considerably. In the paper and printing, leather and shoes, and lumber groups changes were slight. Pay rolls and per capita earnings averaged less in March thaa in February, indicating a reduction in working hours, as wage rates remained practically unchanged. Five thousand establishments reporting to the Bureau of Labor Statistics operated in March at an average of 94 per cent of full time and 82 per cent of full capacity, the former figure referring to hours and the latter to number employed. Activity was particularly great in the vehicles group, with operations at 97 per cent of full time and 89 per cent of capacity. COMMERCIAL FAILURES Commercial failures for the month of March are reported by R. G. Dun & Co. numbering 1,817 and involving liabilities amounting to $97,651,026. Both figures are higher than the corresponding totals for the same month last year and for February of this year; in fact, the liabilities exceed those of any previous month on record. The unusually heavy indebtedness for March this year is due largely to four manufacturing defaults, which alone account for about 60 per cent of the total sum reported. Of the three classifications of failures given, manufacturing, trading, and those among agents and brokers, only the trading class show a decrease in defaulted indebtedness from MAT, 1924 March, 1923, and all classes show an increase in the number of failures over the same period. Insolvencies for the first quarter of the year numbered 5,655 and involved liabilities amounting to $184,865,571. These totals compare with 5,316 failures, with a total indebtedness of $138,231,574 in the first quarter of 1923, and 5,218 failures, with a total indebtedness of $181,208,179 in the last quarter of that year. Comparing the first quarter of this year with the same quarter of last year, the number of failures increased in all of the three classes of commercial enterprise and the liabilities increased in all but the trading lines. Comparing the first quarter of this year with the previous quarter, the number of insolvencies increased among only the trading lines, and the liabilities in only the manufacturing class. Comparative data by districts for the month of March are given in the table below. In all except the St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco districts the number of insolvencies was larger in March this year than last. Com>aring the same months, the liabilities in deault were larger in the New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City districts. Due to a single failure, that of a chemical company in Virginia, with indebtedness amounting to $40,000,000, the liabilities for the Richmond district were the largest on record. f FAILURES DURING MARCH Number Liabilities District 1924 No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. 1—Boston _._ 2—New York 3—Philadelphia. _. 4—Cleveland 5—Richmond 6—Atlanta 7—Chicago 8—St. Louis 9—Minneapolis... 10—Kansas City.. 11—Dallas 12—San Francisco Total 363 83 144 105 128 251 100 77 113 74 216 1923 1924 143 $2,729,443 $2,996,492 8,883,184 316 26,870,199 73 1, 724, 650 10, 622,911 130 3,037,892 5,156, 589 100 42, 232,827 2, 847,909 117 5, 111, 223 2, 788,463 203 8, 298,645 5,360,490 107 1,313,655 1,508,844 76 1,415, 434 979, 270 97 1, 851,517 1,361,100 91 2,474, 504 950,677 229 2, 553,328 2,977, 218 1,817 97, 651, 026 48, 393,138 MONEY RATES Money rates in the New York market were stable during the first three weeks of April at somewhat lower levels than prevailed during the first three weeks of March, and weakened again during the last week of April. This is in contrast with the corresponding period of 1923, when rates were rising. The rate on prime commercial paper of 4 to 6 months' maturity, after a temporary recovery the last 345 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN , 1924 week in March from the decline of the tax period, fell again to 4J per cent, the lowest rate previous to that time since February, 1923. There was a good demand from the interior at this rate. The offering rate on 90-day bankers' acceptances also partly recovered its middle of March decline, but remained below the level prevailing during most of 1923 and 1924. The average yield on 4 to 6 months Government securities declined during the last week in April to the lowest rate since the low, in August, 1922. Government bond prices reflected the easier money rates, and the yield on Liberty bonds fell to the lowest rate since September, 1922.

Three-months bank bills fell to 3 per cent the third week in March for the first time since the advance in the bank rate last July, but were quoted at 3-^ the first week in April. Treasury bills were also allotted at the lowest average rate since June during the week ending March 21, 2.9 per cent, and at a somewhat higher rate afterwards. ACCEPTANCE MARKET During the period ending April 9 the acceptance market was under the influence of wide variations in money rates. The easing of the money market in the middle of March resulted in an active demand for acceptances, especially from city banks, which was temporarily in excess of the supply. But early in April the money market became firmer and the demand for bills slackened. Notwithstanding a slight increase in the supply of bills the active demand, together with the heavy maturities, resulted in a further reduction in dealers' portfolios, which reached the lowest point since October. Bills drawn to finance the exportation of cotton and the importation of sugar constituted the greater proportion of the total supply, but considerable amounts were issued against silk, wool, and provisions, and to furnish dollar exchange. Easier money rates in March were reflected immediately in lower acceptance quotations, but by the close of the period the rate had partly recovered. Rates ranged from 3 | to 4J per cent bid and 3f to 4 | per cent offered for maturities up to 90 days and from 4 to 4^ per cent bid and 31 to 4f per cent offered for maturities of more than three months. SAVINGS DEPOSITS Statistics of 912 banks distributed throughout the United States showed savings deposits amounting to $7,307,062,000 on April 1, 1924, as compared with $7,253,541,000 on March 1, 1924, and $6,740,410,000 on April 1, 1923. The increase for the month was 0.7 per cent and for the year 8.4 per cent. The only district in which a decrease occurred during March, 1924, was Kansas City, although the increases in the Philadelphia and St. Louis districts were very small. The New York, Richmond, Atlanta, and Minneapolis districts all showed increases of over 1 per cent over the March 1 figures. A comparison of savings deposits by Federal reserve districts on April 1, 1924, with deposits on March 1, 1924, and April 1, 1923, is shown in the following table. Figures for the Boston and New York districts are those of large mutual savings banks, but in all other districts reports of other banks are included to make the figures representative.

Net exports, accordingly, amounted to $19,000,000, somewhat less than two-thirds the value of net exports reported for February. Below is given a table showing the visible trade balance for the first three months of 1924 and of 1923. Totals for the three months of 1923 show an excess of imports for the three items, merchandise, gold, and silver, making a net unfavorable balance for the period of $84,000,000. For the three months of 1924, even allowing for the fact that gold exports have so declined as to be negligible, while gold imports have increased to double the amount shown for the earlier period, the balance has shifted to an excess of exports over imports amounting to $45,000,000. Net merchandise imports of $47,000,000 have shifted to net exports of $152,000,000, a gain in net merchandise exports of $199,000,000 over the 1923 period.

While no computation of this figure is attempted, the significant reduction of this otherwise unexplained debit remainder, from $488,000,000 in 1922 to $152,000,000 in 1923, suggests that it is being rapidly reduced either by the purchase of goods and services or through funding. The foreign investments of the United States during 1923 amounted to $410,000,000, of which part undoubtedly represented such fund- MAY, FEDERAL, RESERVE 1924 ing operations, rather than current extensions of credit. Against these foreign loans is set the considerable investment of foreigners in American securities, amounting to $394,000,000, and in American currency, amounting to $50,000,000. In other words, during 1923 America apparently borrowed more abroad than she lent. In part this was due to the high yield offered by American investments, but no doubt it was mostly traceable to the so-called \"flight of capital\" from the disturbed currency and economic conditions of Europe. Gold imports and exports, by principal countries, for March, 1924, and the nine months ending March, 1924 and 1923, are shown in the following table. A detailed table of the foreign trade in gold and silver for the same periods appears on page 453.

About 56 per cent of the gold imports for the month came from Great Britain, over 15 per cent came from Canada, about 10 per cent from France, about 7 per cent from Germany, and over 5 per cent from Argentina. Gold exports for the month continued in small volume and were directed largely to Mexico, Venezuela, and Canada. For the nine months ending March, net gold imports were $297,730,000, compared with $162,317,000 for the corresponding period in 1922-23 and $413,345,000 in 1921-22. Imports from Great Britain were 5*59,000,000 larger than in 1922-23, reflecting in part the larger output of the South African mines; gold imports from Germany, which were small in 1922-23, amounted to $25,544,000; gold imports from Argentina during the period totaled "
