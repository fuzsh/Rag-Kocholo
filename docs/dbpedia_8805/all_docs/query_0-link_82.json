This was necessary due to the 1920s German inflation which had reached its peak in 1923. The exchange rate between the old Papiermark and the Reichsmark was 1 ℛℳ = 1012 Papiermark (one \"trillion\" in US English, one \"billion\" in British English, German and other European languages, see long and short scales). To stabilize the economy and to smooth the transition, the Papiermark was not directly replaced by the Reichsmark, but by the Rentenmark, an interim currency backed by the Deutsche Rentenbank, owning industrial and agricultural real estate assets. The Reichsmark was put on the gold standard at the rate previously used by the Goldmark, with the U.S. dollar worth 4.2 ℛℳ.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Germany established fixed exchange rates between the Reichsmark and the currencies of the occupied and allied countries, often set so as to give the Germans economic benefits. The rates were as follows:\n\nCurrency Date set Value in ℛℳ Belgian franc May 1940 0.1 July 1940 0.08 Bohemian and Moravian koruna 1939 0.1 Bulgarian lev 1940 0.03 Danish krone 1940 1 French franc May 1940 0.05 Italian lira 1943 0.1 Luxembourg franc May 1940 0.25 July 1940 0.1 Dutch Guilder May 10, 1940 1.5 July 17, 1940 1.327 Norwegian krone 1940 0.6 ? 0.57 Polish złoty 1939 0.5 Pound sterling (Channel Islands) 1940 5 (initially) Independent State of Croatia kuna April 1941 0.05 Slovak koruna 1939 0.1 October 1, 1940 0.086 Ukrainian karbovanets 1942 0.1\n\nAfter the Second World War, the Reichsmark continued to circulate in Germany, with new banknotes printed in the U.S. and U.S.S.R. as well as coins. The Reichsmark was replaced in June 1948 by the Deutsche Mark in West Germany and later in the same year by the East German Mark (colloquially also \"Ostmark\", since 1968 officially \"Mark der DDR\") in East Germany.\n\nCoins\n\nIn 1924, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 50 Reichspfennig, and 1 and 3 Mark (not Reichsmark). The 1 and 2 Reichspfennig were struck in bronze, with the 5, 10 and 50 Reichspfennig in aluminium-bronze and the two highest denominations in .500 fine silver. In 1925, .500 fine silver 1 and 2 Reichsmark coins were introduced for circulation, along with the first commemorative 3 and 5 Reichsmark coins. In 1927, nickel 50 Reichspfennig coins were introduced along with regular-type 5 Reichsmark coins, followed by the 3 Reichsmark coin in 1931.\n\n4 Reichspfennig coins were issued in 1932 as part of a failed attempt by the Reichskanzler Heinrich Brüning to reduce prices through use of 4 Reichspfennig pieces instead of 5 Reichspfennig coins. Known as the Brüningtaler or Armer Heinrich (\"poor Heinrich\"), they were demonetized the following year. See Brüningtaler (German).\n\nThe quality of the Reichsmark coins decreased more and more towards the end of World War II and misprints happened more frequently. This led to an increase in counterfeiting of money.\n\nProduction of silver 1 Reichsmark coins ended in 1927. In 1933, nickel 1 Reichsmark coins were introduced, and new silver 2 and 5 Reichsmark coins were introduced which were smaller but struck in .625 and .900 fineness so as to maintain the amount of silver. Production of the 3 Reichsmark coin ceased altogether. In 1935, aluminium 50 Reichspfennig coins were introduced, initially for just the one year. The nickel coins continued to be produced up to 1939. From 1936 on, all coins except the 1 Reichsmark and the first version (1935–36) of the 5 Reichsmark coin (bearing the image of the late Reichspräsident Paul von Hindenburg) bore the Nazi insignia.\n\nDuring World War II, bronze and aluminium-bronze coins were replaced by zinc and aluminium, with the 2 Reichspfennig and the 1, 2 and 5 Reichsmark coins no longer issued. Aluminium 50 Reichspfennig coins were reintroduced to replace the nickel versions. This time around they had a longer run, being produced from 1939 - 1944. Lower denominations were produced in zinc from 1940 onwards. The last production of coins bearing the swastika was in 1944 (1, 5, 10 and 50 Reichspfennig) and 1945 (1 and 10 Reichspfennig only).\n\nAfter the war, the Allies issued coins in relatively small numbers between 1945 and 1948:\n\n1945-46: 1 and 10 Reichspfennig\n\n1947-48: 5 and 10 Reichspfennig\n\nThese coins were issued with designs very similar to those minted in 1944-45, with the exception that the swastika was removed from beneath the eagle on the reverse.\n\nBanknotes\n\nThe first Reichsmark banknotes were introduced by the Reichsbank and state banks such as those of Bavaria, Saxony and Baden. The first Reichsbank issue of 1924 came in denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100 and 1000 Reichsmark. This was followed by a second issue in the same denominations, dated between 1929 and 1936. A 20 Reichsmark note was introduced in 1939, using a design taken from an unissued Austrian 100 schilling banknote type. 5 Reichsmark notes were issued in 1942. Throughout this period, the Rentenbank also issued banknotes denominated in Rentenmark, mostly in low denominations.\n\nFollowing their occupation of Germany, the Allies issued banknotes dated 1944. These were printed in similar colours with different sizes for groups of denominations. Notes were issued for ½, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 1000 Mark (not Reichsmark). The issuer was the Alliierte Militärbehörde (\"Allied military authorities\") with In Umlauf gesetzt in Deutschland (\"in legal circulation in Germany\") printed on the obverse.\n\nIn 1947 Rhineland-Palatinate issued 5 and 10 Pfennig notes with Geldschein on them.\n\n20 RM, 1924\n\nOccupation Reichsmark\n\nCoins and banknotes for circulation in the occupied territories during the war were issued by the Reichskreditkassen. Holed, zinc coins in 5 and 10 Reichspfennig denominations were struck in 1940 and 1941. Banknotes were issued between 1939 and 1945 in denominations of 50 Reichspfennig, 1, 2, 5, 20 and 50 Reichsmark. These served as legal tender alongside the currency of the occupied countries.\n\n50 Rpf, 1938–1945\n\n1 RM, 1938–1945\n\n2 RM, 1938–1945\n\n5 RM, 1938–1945\n\n20 RM, 1938–1945\n\n50 RM, 1938–1945\n\nMilitary Reichsmark currency\n\nSpecial issues of Reichsmark currency were issued for use by the German Armed Forces from 1942-1944. The first issue was denominated in 1, 5, 10 and 50 Reichspfennig and 1 Reichsmark, but was valued at 1 military Reichspfennig = 10 German Reichspfennig. This series was unifaced. The second issue of 1, 5, 10 and 50 Reichsmark were equal in value to the German Reichsmark and was printed on both sides.\n\nThe 5 Mark note pictured, front and back, is allied military currency (\"AMC\") printed at Forbes Lithograph Manufacturing Company in Boston for occupied Germany. There have been different AMCs for all freed parts of europe[1].\n\nConcentration camp and POW Reichsmark currency\n\nVarious special issues of Reichsmark currency were issued for use in concentration and prisoner of war (POW) camps. None was legal tender in Germany itself.\n\nSee also\n\nReichsbank\n\nPfennig\n\n1921 in Germany\n\n1922 in Germany\n\nReferences\n\nMore info about German coins online\n\nWWII Era German Coins\n\nCollectable Third Reich Coins\n\nWeimar coins (Russian)\n\nThird Reich coins (Russian)\n\nThird Reich coins 1933-1935 (Russian)\n\nThird Reich coins 1936-1945 (Russian)"
