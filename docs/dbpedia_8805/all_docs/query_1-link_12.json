        "text": "Saxon duchies, several former states in the Thuringian region of east-central Germany, ruled by members of the Ernestine branch of the house of Wettin between 1485 and 1918; today their territory occupies Thuringia Land (state) and a small portion of northern Bavaria Land in Germany.\n\nThe house of Wettin had accumulated possessions in Thuringia from the middle decades of the 13th century onward. It received the Pleissnerland, centred at Altenburg, from the Holy Roman emperor Frederick II in 1243; won the landgraviate of Thuringia, with control over the Eisenach and Gotha areas, in 1264, after the war of 1256–63; obtained Neustadt by marriage to the heiress of Arnshaugk in 1300; acquired Coburg and Hildburghausen from the house of Henneberg, and Weimar from that of Orlamünde, between 1347 and 1374; and purchased Saalfeld from Schwarzburg in 1389 and Weida from the house of the Vögte (imperial advocates) in 1410–27. The accession of the Wettins to the electorate of Saxony in 1423 gave rise to the use of the prefix Saxe- (German: Sachsen-) for their dynastic ramifications in Thuringia.\n\nThe Ernestine duchies originated in 1485, when the electorate of Saxony was partitioned between Ernest and Albert, the sons of Elector Frederick II. The title of elector (i.e., a prince with the right to participate in choosing the Holy Roman emperor) was kept by Ernest, and by his son Frederick III the Wise (reigned 1486–1525), who was the protector of Martin Luther. The Ernestine line lost the electoral title and much of its territory in 1547 but retained Weimar (with Jena), Gotha, Eisenach, Saalfeld, and Coburg and later recovered Altenburg, Eisenberg (1554), and other lands (including Meiningen) in 1583. From then until the early 19th century, the Ernestine lands underwent successive divisions and regroupings. The most outstanding ruler of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach was Charles Augustus (duke from 1775 to 1828), patron of the great German writers Goethe, Herder, and Schiller, under whom Weimar was the intellectual heart of Germany. All the Ernestine duchies in 1807 adhered to the Confederation of the Rhine, organized by Napoleon, and in 1815 became sovereign members of the German Confederation.\n\nFrom 1826 there were four duchies: the grand duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (Sachsen-Weimar-Eisenach); the duchy of Saxe-Meiningen-Hildburghausen (Sachsen-Meiningen-Hildburghausen); the duchy of Saxe-Altenburg (Sachsen-Altenburg); and the duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha). The territories of the duchies were fragmented, and in the same area there were several exclaves of Prussian and other territories. Saxe-Meiningen-Hildburghausen sided with Austria in the Seven Weeks’ War (1866); the other duchies with victorious Prussia. All joined the North German Confederation (1867) and the German Empire in 1871. In the German revolution of 1918 all the Ernestine rulers abdicated, and in 1920 their former lands were merged in the new Thuringia, with the exception of Coburg, which joined Bavaria."
