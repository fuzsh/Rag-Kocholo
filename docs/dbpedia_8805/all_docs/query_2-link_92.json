        "text": "New Evidence\n\nOur literature search for evidence regarding feasibility/acceptance of teleradiology yielded a total of 52 articles from 25 countries between 2005 and 2015 inclusive. Of these, 35% were from the U.S. It may be appreciated that today's technology bears little or no resemblance to what was available during the formative stage in the 1950s and early 1960s. Today's technology not only enables rapid and reliable capture, transmission, storage, and retrieval of large data files within secure networks, but it has also opened new vistas for building networks and collaboration between radiologists, surgeons, and other professionals. The following review is organized by year, starting in 2005.\n\nSix studies investigated the feasibility/acceptance of teleradiology in the year 2005, three from the U.S. and one each from Switzerland, Ireland, and Germany. The first U.S. study was based on a 1999 national survey (n = 970 practices and a response rate of 77%) by the ACR.57 The purpose of the survey was to establish a general portrait of radiology practices in the U.S. In 1999, 71% of multiradiologist (or group) practices had invested in teleradiology systems and used them for only 5% of their studies. This compared with only 30% of solo practices having teleradiology, but using them for 14% of their studies. The vast majority or 92% of multiradiologist practices used teleradiology for on-call interpretation, 95% to interpret CT, 84% for sonography, 47% for NM, and 43% for conventional radiographs. The true significance of the findings from this survey was pointed out by the authors, namely that teleradiology has already become a fixture in most practices by 1999. Its widespread presence positioned teleradiology to become a key element of radiology practice nationwide.\n\nThe second report was concerned with purported problems in the general radiology reporting system, which is not designed to be optimally safe, timely, and patient centered. This was not an empirical study, but it is included here because it proposed new channels of communication between radiologists and patients, which would likely increase satisfaction and patient-centered care by treating patients as equal partners with referring physicians.58 This issue is now mostly resolved in health systems that established patient portals where patients can have access to their medical records, including diagnostic studies (virtually through the portal rather than requiring a CD to be burned during an in-person visit), as well as make appointments, order prescription refills, and communicate with their clinicians.\n\nThe third U.S. study examined the feasibility of wireless technology for enabling remote evaluation of renal colic (kidney stones) and renal trauma patients using CT.59 The technology consisted of a cellular phone with a wireless modem link to a personal digital assistant (PDA). Diagnostic interpretations of images from 11 patients were initially reviewed by a chief resident in urology and subsequently by a staff urologist at an academic medical center. The sample was too small to draw any definitive conclusions, and the technology had its limits, such as the inability to detect intra-abdominal sources of pain such as appendicitis, cholecystitis, ruptured aortic aneurysm, pancreatitis, or pelvic processes. Hence, the authors suggested that telemedicine should be viewed as an additional source of information, and it is still dependent on a well-trained physician's ability to evaluate the patient, order appropriate tests, and consult a specialist as needed.\n\nAn Internet-based survey (n = 102, response rate = 22.7%) gathered information regarding use patterns, technical characteristics, and anticipated future of teleradiology in Switzerland.60 All members of the Swiss Society of Radiology (n = 450) were contacted by e-mail and asked to complete the questionnaire online. Of those who responded, 41.2% were current users of teleradiology, 35.3% were planning to use it in the near future, and 14.5% had no plans to use it. Use was substantially higher in rural areas compared with urban areas (55% vs. 37%). Emergency service was the most common reason for using teleradiology, followed by expert consultation. CT was considered the most relevant type of imaging in teleradiology. The typical format for transmission was DICOM (66.7%), followed by bitmap/Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) (38.1%). Different views were expressed regarding the future of teleradiology. Some were concerned about regulations and the legal aspects of the practice, followed by security issues. Current users preferred a standard interface, but nonusers seemed to prefer a nationwide medical net.\n\nThe feasibility of multimedia messaging for the referral of musculoskeletal limb injuries was investigated in a survey (n = 46) of emergency physicians and trauma surgeons in Northern Ireland.61 The respondents were asked to evaluate the quality of multimedia consults. Image quality was deemed acceptable in all, but one referral. Physicians reported that the multimedia imaging resulted in improved patient management in 35 of the 46 referrals, and 8 of 46 resulted in changing patient management. The authors concluded that teleradiology has potential to facilitate the rapid cost-effective management of musculoskeletal limb injuries.\n\nA descriptive study by the German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) (500 participating centers) documented their experience with a central prospective radiation oncological review aimed at improving treatment quality.62 This involved a centralized review of all diagnostic imaging by expert radiation oncologists aimed at controlling the disease extension and to define the involved field treatment volume. This review process was used as a basis for determining the optimal extent of irradiation. The results of this group's experience were quite positive in terms of contributing to high [radiation therapy] RT quality for study patients.\n\nIn 2006, five studies/reports met the inclusion criteria for the feasibility/acceptance of teleradiology, two from the U.S. and one each from Canada, Greece, and Spain. All five were concerned with networks and the use of the Web for professional collaboration and/or clinical management.\n\nThe Canadian article focused on workflow within specially designed metropolitan networks, referred to as workflow-engaged networks (WENs).63 The unique nature of WENs is the ability to interconnect several hospitals within an urban region to facilitate the operations of a comprehensive diagnostic imaging service. They are modeled on workflow priorities. However, when poorly designed, other network designs may reduce efficiency and cause delays when providers try to retrieve medical cases. Overall, WENs improved network performance by guaranteeing that critical image transfers experience minimal delay, with potential cost savings for leased line services measured in millions of dollars per year.\n\nTwo relevant U.S. reports were published in 2006. The first was a description of a work in progress. It is included here because it demonstrated the benefits of establishing a database system within the World Wide Web, which allows rapid and flexible communication of time-sensitive report information and interpretation for more expeditious clinical decision-making in intensive care settings.64 The authors pointed out that such Web-based applications can extend the reach and efficiency of traditionally structured medical laboratories.\n\nThe second U.S. report described an intranet-based computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system in radiology for online ordering and scheduling at an academic medical center.65 Although it did not deal with images per se, this system featured online scheduling, patient reminders, preparation instructions, and driving directions. Comparative scores for imaging examinations were displayed, and physician performance was tracked. Senior clinicians counseled colleagues with low performance scores. The use of the CPOE increased substantially during 1 year (2004), accounting for 75% of all outpatient studies (n = 72,000). After installation, the use of the system increased steadily from 2001 to 2004. At the end of 3 years, it accounted for 75% of all outpatient studies. The highest numbers of low utility examinations were CT and MRI of the spine (which declined from 6% to 2%, especially among primary care physicians). The authors concluded that CPOE can be widely accepted by clinicians and can have an impact on ordering practices.\n\nThe feasibility of clinical collaboration over the Web during interventional radiology procedures (IRPs) was investigated in Greece.66 A hybrid Web-based IRP system was evaluated to ascertain its feasibility and effectiveness in terms of allowing subspecialists to support real-time mentoring, image manipulation, and education. Ten interventional radiologists, two vascular surgeons, and two medical physicists participated in 33 fully collaborative cases. In addition to mentoring clinicians during procedures, collaboration included open seminars and learner modules. The authors reported that the collaboration proved to be effective in enhancing outcomes especially in complex cases.\n\nA descriptive analysis of a 6-year experience with radiological clinical telesessions was conducted in Spain.67 The sessions consisted of clinical case presentations, discussions of clinical findings, differential diagnoses, and suggestions, ultimately leading to a definitive diagnosis. Initially, three groups of radiologists joined the cooperative working environment and shared their clinical experience over the Internet. Subsequently, two other groups joined the online cooperative. A total of 65 cases were reviewed. Of these, 55 were posted as cases of interest archive, thereby making them publicly available. A majority of the participants indicated a high degree of acceptance and no special difficulty in the use of the tools [was reported].\n\nThree reports on the feasibility of teleradiology were published in 2007, two from the U.S. and one jointly from Greece and Germany. The Greece–Germany report was based on a collaborative project in interventional radiological procedures between the two countries.68 A hybrid satellite–terrestrial network with multicasting (multiple video feeds) and wavelet capabilities was tested to determine its feasibility for international collaboration in IR. Eight interventional radiologists and one vascular surgeon participated in several clinical and educational sessions. The project demonstrated the feasibility of advanced collaboration among geographically dispersed international centers using this medium.\n\nFrom the U.S., the first report described the use of grid computing to support interactive professional collaboration and computer-assisted diagnostic detection (CAD) of lung nodules in thoracic CT.69 GridIMAGE was designed to (a) select images from several geographically dispersed DICOM servers, (b) send the images to a specified set of readers and CAD algorithms, and (c) compare interpretations from readers and the CAD. Using the National Cancer Institute (caGrid) infrastructure, the system allowed practitioners to obtain interpretations from one or more human readers or CAD algorithms. It also allowed cooperative imaging groups to perform systematic image interpretations.\n\nThe second report was focused on the implementation of an automated wireless network for the transmission of prehospital electrocardiograms (ECGs) as a means to reduce door-to-balloon times in acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs).70 STEMI is the most severe type of heart attack and constitutes a true medical emergency. The system consisted of Bluetooth devices, preprogrammed transmitting/receiving stations, dedicated e-mail servers, and smartphones. It connected emergency medical personnel and cardiologists to expedite triaging patients directly to the catheterization laboratory from the field when the patient arrives at the ED. This automated system resulted in the early evaluation and triage of patients with suspected STEMI and it reduced door-to-balloon times by more than 90 min. Although the study focused on ECGs, the implications for teleradiology include the pairing of these data with subsequent angiographic imaging data that can be reviewed by offsite cardiologists.\n\nThree reports were published in 2008 concerning the feasibility of using the Internet for image transmission and retrieval in collaborative multisite systems, including one from the U.S., an Israeli project, and one from France. The U.S. study evaluated the use of the Internet to retrieve and integrate pertinent images into a radiology Web site.71 Thumbnail images were linked to the full-size image at the original site to permit viewing full images. A review of 20 randomly selected hypertext documents (containing 72 images) revealed that 96% of the displayed images were relevant in terms of demonstrating the feasibility of multisite collaboration for image sharing (although more for research and education than clinical interpretation).\n\nThe Israel report focused on a unique problem in developing countries, namely the over 50% idle (non-use) or disrepair rate of sophisticated imaging equipment.72 It is estimated that some three-quarters of the world's population have no access to medical imaging. Hence, it was ironic that about one-half of the imaging equipment is not optimally used. This study investigated the feasibility of centralized medical imaging systems based on mobile phone technology as a replacement for conventional stand-alone imaging devices. The system consisted of (a) data acquisition devices at the remote sites with limited on-site controls and (b) advanced image reconstruction and hardware control at a central site. A limited simulation test of breast cancer detection demonstrated the feasibility of this modality of medical imaging as a solution for the chronic shortage of imaging infrastructure in many parts of the world.\n\nA French cross-sectional observational study (n = 21) investigated the role of retinal camera imaging as a substitute for in-person ophthalmologist examination of suspected abusive head injury among children.73 Children were examined by standard ophthalmoscopy and by photography using the RetCam-120 Digital Retinal Camera. The images were stored and subsequently read remotely by an ophthalmologist located in a different place. The children also had radiographic skeletal series that were available electronically to identify bone fractures and CT or MRI scans of the head to ascertain intracranial hemorrhages. In this sample, the vast majority of the children (85.7%) had cerebral bleeding, and 66.7% had retinal hemorrhaging. The digital camera enabled the detection of all as well as one false-positive case. The sensitivity and specificity of the camera were 100% and 85.7%, respectively.\n\nIn 2009, six reports met the inclusion criteria for feasibility studies, two from the U.S. and one each from Sweden, Croatia, Belgium, and Germany. Each study focused on a unique clinical area. Collectively, they represent a rich mixture of telemedicine applications incorporating radiographic images. We start with studies from European countries and conclude with those from the U.S.\n\nThe Swedish study assessed the use of telemedicine for sharing information in pediatric radiotherapy (RT).74 In 2003, survival rates of children with all forms of cancer were about 80%, which were attributed to surgery and chemotherapy, as well as RT. Typically, survivors have to cope with the effects of RT, which may include growth retardation for the rest of their lives. Hence, collaboration among radiation treatment specialists was expected to improve their respective knowledge and competence in treating children to maximize the benefits and minimize the side effects of this mode of therapy. After 1 year, the participant clinicians in the group indicated that the telemedicine conferences (which included remote viewing of radiographic and RT images) had a significant impact on their competence. While there was total agreement regarding these benefits, some clinicians complained about audio quality of the system, which was encountered in some instances. This problem was subsequently rectified by investing in dedicated systems and conference rooms.\n\nThe Croatian study reported on the use of telemedicine in neurosurgery.75 The system connected CT, MRI, and digital subtraction angiography—a type of fluoroscopy in IR used to visualize blood vessels in a bony or dense soft tissue area—scanners in 29 hospitals with a referral center in Zagreb. Patient information, including demographics, medical history, and images, was archived automatically in a central workstation and made accessible on demand. The files were made available to neurosurgical departments in seven cities in Croatia. This report focused on access issues, notably obviated travel, and carbon footprint. The authors reported during the first 7 years of the project, and 25,366 expert opinions were rendered. A total of 7103 (28%) expert opinions were provided to the distant regional hospitals. Of these, 53% were neurotrauma, 22% cardiovascular disease, 19% brain tumors, 4% lumbar disc disease, and 2% neurosurgical disorders. The most valuable results from teleradiology were the decisions about proper and effective patient treatment. In terms of access, the network saved more than 400,000 km of patient transportation.\n\nFrom Belgium, an observational study investigated the benefits and limits of an integrated 3D virtual approach to treatment planning for patients with a maxillofacial deformity (referred to as orthognathic surgery or corrective jaw or face surgery to realign the jaws and teeth to improve function and appearance).76 The authors described the workflow processes in 3D planning for orthognathic surgery, including image acquisition, image processing to create a 3D image of the patient's head, virtual diagnosis and virtual treatment planning, communication, splint manufacturing, transfer to the operating room, and virtual treatment outcome evaluation. The authors pointed out that substantial laboratory and clinical research has been done worldwide on 3D virtual treatment planning of orthognathic surgery. However, the paradigm shift still has yet to demonstrate improvement in quality of care, workflow efficiency, and cost reduction. Whereas quality improvement is certain, efficiency and cost reduction are yet to be proven, mostly because 3D software packages are still expensive.\n\nA somewhat similar application was reported in a technical note from a German project. It described an open platform for 3D cone beam reconstruction that can be applied in several clinical workflows.77 Cone beam refers to an imaging technique using CT X-rays emanating from divergent sources that combine to form the shape of a cone. It can be used in implants, orthodontics, and IR. The authors proposed a fast 3D cone beam reconstruction in an open platform for worldwide comparison in back projection performance using high resolution to assure image quality. The authors commented that an open platform gives fair chance to all participants and should enable robust evaluation of the software and hardware. However, it may be appreciated that this is a technical rather than a clinical issue.\n\nA report from the U.S. described a multilingual search engine (GoldMiner Global) to facilitate international (worldwide) access to an indexed collection of more than 200,000 radiological images.78 The program uses Unicode standard to allow accurate representation of characters and ideographs in any language that supports writing from left to right and from right to left directions. The translated medical subject heading (MeSH) terms can be used to search for and retrieve images of interest. Explanatory text, pull-down menu choices, and navigational guides are displayed in the selected language. This is more of a research and education-based tool, but as it incorporates virtual access to images, it falls under teleradiology.\n\nFinally, we include a special report on teledentistry aimed at improving access to care for underserved populations.79 Teledentistry uses electronic health records, telecommunications technology, digital imaging, and the Internet to provide teleconsultation with specialists, supervision of collaborative hygienists in remote areas, and education. Similar to other telemedicine applications, it can be delivered synchronously or asynchronously. However, teledentistry is a relatively new area of dentistry. With further advances in technology, it is expected to be more widely used to allow specialists to provide diagnosis and treatment recommendations for patients who would otherwise not have access to specialists in person. Similarly, through collaborative hygienists in remote areas, patients [would] have improved access to preventive dental care.\n\nIn 2010, three reports met the inclusion criteria, one each from Poland, Scotland, and India. The common theme revolves around the benefits of networking.\n\nThe Polish study assessed image quality, software stability, constant availability, data transmission speed, and quality of real-time synchronized viewing of the images during the tele-DICOM teleconsultation.80 Observational data were gathered from offline consultations of 918 patients who were referred for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The tele-DICOM software was tested against measurements from echocardiography. The tele-DICOM consultations resulted in a CABG decision in 87.8% of the cases. The remaining 12% were recommended for medical therapy or percutaneous angioplasty. Measurements performed in the ECHO-tele-DICOM module were accurate compared with those performed on a standard echo machine (r = 0.98). The study demonstrated that the tele-DICOM system is suited for professional use in the field of cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe Scottish study was a prospective evaluation (n = 143) of quality of service in referrals to neurosurgery using PACSs and remote viewing.81 The authors explained that low caseload could not support subregional neurosurgery units in Scotland. Hence, nearly all acute neurosurgery referrals were made by unspecialized providers. Many of these referrals will be for advice on management and not all will require interhospital patient transfer. During the 4-year period of the study, remote image viewing facilities were gradually changed to dedicated image links by remote PACSs. Subsequently, 88% of the referrals were made through the new system. A minority of referrals (12%) required images (on CD-ROMS) to be physically transferred by courier. This added an average delay of 5.8 h to decision-making. The authors expressed concern over the slow adoption of PACSs in neuroscience, which could jeopardize patient safety.\n\nAn observational study in India (n = 962) documented the effects of teleradiology on accessibility.82 A network link was established between a teleradiology provider in Bangalore, South India, and a hospital in Arunachal Pradesh in the northeast over 3,000 km away. The hospital at the remote site is a referral site for the entire state with a population of over one million, and it had only one CT scanner. This project demonstrated that remote implementation of teleradiology is possible in rural India.\n\nIn 2011, a total of five studies investigated the feasibility of specific clinical applications in teleradiology, two from the U.S. and one each from Germany, New Zealand, and South Korea.\n\nThe feasibility of telefluoroscopic evaluation of oropharyngeal dysphagia (swallowing difficulty) was evaluated in a prospective observational study of 32 patients in Arkansas.83 This medical condition can occur at any age and can result in respiratory complications, malnutrition, or death. In addition, it can limit social interactions and may lead to emotional distress. Patients with this problem participated in two separate fluoroscopic swallowing evaluations, one traditional and the other through a telemedicine system. The two sets were evaluated in terms of (1) severity of swallowing difficulty; (2) laryngeal penetration and aspiration; and (3) treatment recommendations. There was an overall agreement between the two modalities in severity ratings (κ = 0.64), penetration aspiration rate (difference of 1.1 points), and in treatment recommendations, ranging from 69% to 100%. Hence, the study demonstrated the feasibility and clinical utility of telefluoroscopy in evaluating swallowing difficulty.\n\nAnother U.S. study during 2011 investigated the utility of PACSs in terms of providing decision support from the perspective of radiology residents.84 Decision support systems (DSSs) can provide patient-specific information during image interpretation that can improve diagnostic accuracy, and for residents doing rural rotations, access to DSSs through teleradiology can be useful. However, most DSSs require radiologists to exit PACSs to use them, thereby deterring some of them from using DSSs altogether. Forty-eight radiology residents were assigned randomly to a control group, which had Web access to DSSs, whereas the experimental group had the same access plus a PACS-integrated portal. Halfway through the 10-month study, the two groups were switched. The outcome measure was the number of decision support sessions initiated by the resident radiologist. The experimental group had much higher use scores than the control group by a factor of 3. When integrated access was removed from the original experimental group, their use declined by 52%, and when the control group had integrated access, their use rose by 20%. The authors concluded that integrated access is critical at the time of initial deployment. However, the reasons for that phenomenon are not clear.\n\nFrom Germany, a retrospective analysis of clinical and imaging data was conducted pre- and postradioimmunotherapy for conventional lymphoma. The aim was to predict therapy response to radioimmunotherapy in a Web-based multicenter evaluation.85 A total of 159 lesions (16 patients) were measured using the digital images. Lesion volume, total, and maximum volume were predictors of response. The Web-based multicenter archiving system proved to be technically feasible, and the analysis of the data suggested that image collection was feasible and allowed for a central analysis.\n\nThe development and use of an online system to locate radiologists in New Zealand were described in a 2011 publication.86 Although not an image-based tool, this in-house system was designed to minimize the time spent looking for a radiologist from geographically separated radiology departments. The system allowed access to radiologists who are logged into the RIS. The information [name, contact information, and specialty] is displayed on a self-refreshing screen on the Intranet. Over a period of 1 month (April 2009), there were 2,798 hits on the locator page. Of these, 1,248 hits were made by radiologists and 1,550 by radiology administrative staff. Average time for reviewing the roster was 30 s, and a full review of the whole department was 195 s. Importantly, the use of this system realized savings of up to 16 h of radiologist reporting time per week.\n\nFrom South Korea, a study assessed the usefulness of a mobile teleradiology system using the JPEG2000 compression scheme for emergency care imaging.87 The feasibility of JPEG2000 compressed CT images transmitted over mobile networks was assessed in terms of image quality and transmission time. The system was able to query patient information and images instantly. Quality was judged as acceptable by the radiologists. As expected, higher compression levels provided quantitatively lower image quality, with ratios of up to 10:1 as clinically reasonable. The authors concluded that wireless transmission of JPEG2000 radiological images of emergency patients through mobile networks to remote specialists can help achieve proper first aid of emergency patients.\n\nThe feasibility of a multicenter Web-based system for predicting radioimmunotherapy response in patients with follicular lymphoma was assessed using a retrospective record review (n = 16 patients and 159 lesions).85 Every measurable lesion was analyzed in terms of standardized uptake value, volume, and response. Lesion volumes were predictors of response. The important conclusion from this study affirmed the technical feasibility of a Web-based multicenter archiving system for identifying predictive factors in this form of lymphoma. This preliminary analysis suggested that imaging data can predict the likelihood of response to radioimmunotherapy.\n\nA total of six feasibility studies were published in 2012, three from the U.S. and one each from Malawi, Korea, and United Kingdom, Serbia, Germany, and Ireland.\n\nThe first U.S. study evaluated the ability to diagnose acute appendicitis from abdominal CT using a mobile DICOM viewer.88 The study used 25 abdominal CT studies for patients presenting with abdominal pain. They were interpreted by five radiologists on an iPhone using a DICOM viewer. The radiologists located the appendix and ascertained its diameter, appendicolith (calcified deposit), stranding (tissue thickening) and fluid, abscess, and acute appendicitis. Readings from an iPhone were compared with a PACS workstation. Acute appendicitis was correctly diagnosed in 98% of the cases with no false positives. Eighty-eight percent of appendicoliths were correctly identified as well as all three abscesses. The authors concluded that handheld device review of CT scans has the potential to aid in appropriate and expeditious triage of patients with acute appendicitis, ultimately improving patient outcomes.\n\nAn interactive, computer-based pediatric atlas for chest radiograph interpretation was developed to help in understanding normal variants in interpreting pediatric chest radiographs.89 The atlas consisted of a review of 73 normal pediatric chest radiographs, 16 abnormal pediatric radiographs, and 4 normal adult radiographs. The images were originally DICOM formatted, then converted to JPEG format. The digital interactive format made it easy to manipulate the atlas and to compare cases, which is of benefit especially to general radiologists in remote settings with subspecialty training. The benefits of the atlas were demonstrated, and the authors concluded that improved interpretation of pediatric chest radiographs in the acute setting may be facilitated by a comprehensive, computer-based, pediatric chest atlas.\n\nThe third U.S. study in 2012 investigated the feasibility of a smartphone teleradiology application in a telestroke network.90 It was based on the premise that a mobile application on smartphones affords neurologists access to radiological images of patients with stroke from remote sites in the context of a telemedicine evaluation. The objective was to assess concordance between a vascular neurosurgeon in a hub center and independent adjudicators. Data were gathered on a sample of 53 patients presenting with stroke in remote sites who participated in a telemedicine consultation. Their CT scans were evaluated by a hub vascular neurologist, a spoke (remote site) radiologist, and blinded telestroke adjudicators. CT head interpretations by vascular neurologists were in agreement (measured by κ values) with spoke radiologists and independent adjudicators at 1.0 for intracranial hemorrhage, 1.0 for neoplasms, contraindications to thrombolysis, 0.92 and 0.85, early ischemic changes 0.62, and hyper dense artery sign 0.40. Thus, the authors concluded that CT head interpretations of telestroke network patients by vascular neurologists using ResolutionMD [their software package] on smartphones were in excellent agreement with interpretations by spoke radiologists using a PACS and those of independent stroke adjudicators using a desktop viewer.\n\nThe feasibility of using teleradiology in tuberculosis (TB) screening and case management was evaluated in Malawi in southeast Africa.91 The authors reported that Malawi has one of the highest rates of HIV infections (10.6%) in the world and a higher rate of TB (14.5%) in a southern district (Thyolo) with about 600,000 inhabitants, mostly poor migrant farmers. A total of 159 images from 158 patients were reviewed by teleradiology. Nearly one in four cases (n = 36) resulted in changed management; two were undiagnosed TB; and 16 corrected a misdiagnosis of TB (i.e., false positives). The corrected cases of misdiagnosis averted inappropriate treatment. The authors concluded that teleradiology can improve tuberculosis diagnosis and case management. This would be particularly important in a resource-poor setting.\n\nThe use of mobile technology for remote viewing of CT images was assessed in an observational study (n = 100) in Korea.92 The project used ultramobile PC (UMPC) for Web-based viewing of abdominal CT scans for remote interpretation of appendicitis compared with using an LCD-based DICOM viewer. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve values for the UPMC (Az = 0.959) and the LCD monitor (Az = 0.976) were both high and there were no significant differences between the two display systems for interpreting abdominal CTs. Web-based mobile teleradiology is feasible for reading abdominal CTs for diagnosing appendicitis and may be valuable in emergency teleconsultation.\n\nFinally, we diverge from our normal course, which is focused on feasibility/acceptance of teleradiology applications by including here a UK report on the quality of information available on the Internet search engines regarding IR, vascular surgery, and cardiology.93 The article was accepted in 2012 and published in 2013. The leading search engines were compared using the Linguistic Assistant for Domain Analysis (LIDA)—an online tool for assessing health-related Web sites for usability testing, specifically to ascertain whether the information on the Web site is accessible, usable, and reliable. The overall results suggested that the three Web sites (or search engines) were generally well designed and easy to use. However, the majority lacked currency and reliability. There was also a disparity in knowledge of IR, which was attributed to low traffic on the Web site.\n\nIn 2013, seven studies met the selection criteria for feasibility analysis, emanating from six countries, two from Korea and one each from China, Turkey, Greece, Angola, and Hungary. These studies investigated the feasibility of teleradiology for remote diagnosis in several clinical areas, appendicitis, brain hemorrhage, and shoulder injury. A common thread among them is the use of mobile technology.\n\nThe first of the two Korean studies investigated the feasibility of teleconsultations in patients with inconclusive diagnosis of appendicitis, using CT scans and smartphones.94 The article was accepted in 2013 and published in 2014. The teleconsultations were required when the on-call radiologists made inconclusive diagnoses. The sample consisted of 68 patients, 29 with confirmed appendicitis, and 25 were inconclusive. The smartphone readings were compared with preliminary reports by on-call radiologists and with the original final reports by in-house abdominal radiologists. Overall, the study results indicated that offsite smartphone readings did not differ significantly from that of the in-house preliminary report. However, the smartphone readings provided higher diagnostic confidence than the preliminary reports. This suggests that smartphone readings were made with more confidence, especially when the initial report of the on-call radiologist indicated an inconclusive diagnosis of appendicitis.\n\nThe second Korean study assessed the feasibility of iPad 2 for evaluating subtle brain hemorrhaging using CT under conventional lighting conditions, which were common in remote CT readings.95 A sample of 100 brain CT scans for head trauma or headache was selected: 50 had subtle signs of intracranial hemorrhaging, and 50 had no significant abnormality. Five emergency physicians reviewed the CT scans in two modalities, IPad and LCD monitor. High sensitivities and specificities were observed when the two modalities were compared (ROCs Az values were 0.935 and 0.900 for IPad and LCD, respectively). Clinicians were able to diagnose subtle brain hemorrhage under suboptimal viewing conditions.\n\nA Chinese study evaluated the feasibility of a robot-assisted vascular interventional surgery to enable surgeons to teleoperate a catheter in a safe mode (i.e., with reduced X-ray exposure).96 The remote-controlled vascular intervention robot (RVIR) was designed on the basis of a master–slave structure and addressed C-arm calibration, distortion connection, catheter localization, and 3D vascular reconstruction. The experiment demonstrated that RVIR was feasible, and its accuracy would satisfy the surgeon's requirements.\n\nA retrospective evaluation (n = 100) of the feasibility and accuracy of teleconsultations of coronary angiograms using smartphones was conducted in Turkey.97 Images of single-vessel disease were reevaluated by consultants outside the hospital in two display modes: iPhone 4 screen and workstation monitor, reporting on localization and severity of angiographic lesions. There was high agreement between the core laboratory monitor readings and the readings on the iPhone (κ = 0.80). Accordingly, the authors concluded that smartphones may serve as a supplementary teleconsultation tool in both elective and emergency situations.\n\nThe feasibility and reliability of integrated teleradiological and telepathological evaluation of liver grafts were conducted in Greece using 15 MRI image sets.98 The integrated analysis of both teleradiology and telepathology resulted in 100% specificity, 96.6% sensitivity, and 97.5% accuracy. The message from this simulation points to the feasibility and reliability of evaluating liver graft transplant when the two diagnostic methods are used.\n\nA large observational study (n = 20,564 X-ray images) was conducted in Angola (seventh largest country in Africa) to ascertain the feasibility and quality of digital X-rays in general as well as teleradiology.99 Teleradiology was used in 7.6% of all pediatric cases and provided an important contribution to case management. Overall, the implementation of a digital X-ray is feasible in low-resource settings with significant improvement in quality X-ray images.\n\nThe final feasibility study in 2013 comes from Hungary.100 This short communication described the results of screening a total of 102 applications (in English) for smartphones and tablets in terms of diagnostic reading, decision support, medical books, integrative encyclopedias, and journal reading programs. Based on this broad analysis, the authors concluded that smartphones and tables offer new opportunities for diagnostic imaging practitioners with excellent display for diagnostic reading, reference, learning, consultations, and for communication with patients.\n\nIn 2014, three studies met the selection criteria, one each from Switzerland, Germany, and France. These studies reported on similar themes as previous ones, namely multidisciplinary collaboration, networking, and mobile technology.\n\nFrom Switzerland, a study focused on multidisciplinary collaboration between radiology, surgery, RT, and pathology in head and neck tumor surgery.101 These fields were integrated by a common server, which provided remote access to the imaging data. Margins of resection and exact locations of biopsies were mapped intraoperatively. Pathologists provided numerical coordinates of the biopsies and traced each specimen to an anatomical field. RT was mapped according to this information. The model enabled the RT planning according to specific coordinates to minimize irradiation of adjacent structures. The navigation-assisted network described grants timely multidisciplinary feedback between all fields involved, attains meticulous pathological definition, and permits optimized coordinate-directed radiotherapy.\n\nA single-center experience of off-hour IR service was evaluated to assess feasibility, frequency of use, and associated labor costs in a German study.102 The analysis was based on retrospective screening of the IR database for procedures performed outside regular working hours and manually selected cases where the interventionist was called from home. Three on-call interventionists performed 92 procedures during off-hours in 1 year. These consisted of angiography and hemorrhage control (39%), acute limb ischemia (27%), percutaneous biliary drainage (11%), nonocclusive ischemia (8%), and other (15%). The labor costs per procedure were €459.9. Based on these data, the authors concluded that a formal interventional [off-hour] is practicable in a university setting and the total costs appear to be moderate.\n\nA nationwide cross-sectional survey (n = 131, response rate = 93.6%) of young radiation oncologists was conducted in France, April to June 2013.103 The purpose was to assess how young French radiation oncologists use mobile technology and social media in clinical practice. Ownership of these devices was high, 93% owned a smartphone and 33% tablets. Overall, 83% had a social network account. Most of the residents used smartphones in their work for a variety of tasks. However, the majority did not check the validity of the apps on a consistent basis. The use of social network had a limited impact on their relationship with patients. According to the authors, this study highlights the irruption [or burst] and the risks of new technologies in the clinical practice and raises the question of a possible regulation for their use in the hospital.\n\nThree studies met the selection criteria in 2015, all from the U.S. The first focused on the feasibility of the radiological image sharing network to obviate the need for physical media for patients and providers.104 The National Institutes of Health (NIH) challenged the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) to develop a transport method that could supersede the need for physical media (for patients and providers), replace point-to-point private networks among providers, and enable image exchange on an ad hoc basis between arbitrary health networks without long legal delays. This article constitutes a technical response to that challenge, incorporating the architecture for such a system.\n\nA study assessed the use of social media sites among private radiology groups (PRGs) and academic radiology departments (ARDs).105 The sample included the 50 largest PRGs (defined by the total number of full-time employee radiologists) and the 50 ARDs with the largest National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding in 2012. The use of each social media Web site, including Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, YouTube, and LinkedIn, was assessed during a 2-week period in September 2014. Measures of organizational activity and individual user activity were collected. Seventy-six percent of PRGs maintained more than one social media account compared with only 28% of ARDs who did. In terms of prevalence of social media among PRGs, Facebook was 66%, LinkedIn 56%, Twitter, 42%, YouTube 20%, Pinterest 4%, and Instagram 2%. The corresponding percentages among ARDs were 18%, 0%, 24%, 6%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. These findings indicate that the use of social media in health is emerging in the mainstream, especially among PRGs."
