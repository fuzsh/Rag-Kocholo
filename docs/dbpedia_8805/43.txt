The 2 mark coin was issued by the states of the German Empire from 1874 until 1914. It had a value equal to 2.00 gold mark.

The coin was composed of .900 fine silver, weighed 11.1111 grams, measured 28 millimeters in diameter, and 2 millimeters in thickness. Most examples of the coins featured the Reichsadler of the German Empire on the reverse, accompanied by the state title of the Second Reich (DEUTSCHES REICH), the coin's value, and the year of minting. The obverse typically featured the leader of the state it was minted for. For example, a coin from the Kingdom of Bavaria from 1888 would display an effigy of then-current Bavarian King, Otto I. Other times, the coat of arms of the state that issued the coin would be engraved on the coin's obverse, as seen on the Bremen and Hamburg 2 mark coins.
