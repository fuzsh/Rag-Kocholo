The 3 mark coin is a circulation and commemorative piece that was issued from 1908 to 1918 by eighteen of the twenty-five states of the German Empire: the Kingdoms of Bavaria, Prussia, Saxony, and Württemberg, the Grand Duchies of Baden, Hesse, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, the Duchies of Anhalt, Brunswick, and Saxe-Meiningen, the Principalities of Lippe, Reuss-Greiz, Schaumburg-Lippe, and Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, and the Free Hanseatic Cities of Hamburg and Lübeck. The only states that did not produce a coin of the denomination were the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, the Duchies of Saxe-Altenburg and Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the Principalities of Reuss-Gera, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, and Waldeck-Pyrmont, and the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen. All examples of the 3 mark piece had legal tender face values equivalent to 3.00 gold mark from 1908 to 1914, and 3.00 Papiermark from 1914 to demonetization in 1918. The mint at which an example was struck depends primarily on the location of the state that issued it.

All 3 mark coins of the German Empire have the same composition and measurements, being made of .900 fine silver and having masses of 16.67 grams, diameters of 33 millimeters, and thicknesses of 2.50 millimeters. The edge is generally engraved with the German motto "GOTT MIT UNS", and most examples tend to have medallic alignment (a few types use coin alignment instead). All are round in shape. The reverse design of all pieces is uniform, featuring in the center the Reichsadler of Kaiser William II (German: Wilhelm II; 1859–1941) – which consists of a large eagle with its wings outspread and its head facing left. On its breast is a small escutcheon bearing the coat of arms of Prussia, surrounded by the chain of the Order of the Black Eagle, an order of chivalry that has been awarded by Prussian monarchs since 1701. Surmounting the eagle is the German State Crown, a heraldic symbol of the German Empire. The state title of the Empire in its native German – "DEUTSCHES REICH" – is engraved clockwise along the upper periphery of the piece, commencing at the left rim and concluding at the coin's upper right boundary. It is followed by the date of minting, which is written downward along the right side of the coin. Printed counterclockwise along the bottom rim of the reverse is the value "DREI MARK" (English: "3 Mark"), which is separated from the state title and date by two five-pointed stars. The design on the obverse varies with the state that issued the coin and the year it was made. Generally, the current monarch of the issuing state is displayed in profile; for example, on a 1913 coin from the Kingdom of Saxony, a likeness of then current King Frederick Augustus III (1865–1932; reigned 1904–1918) is shown, accompanied by a caption and mint mark. Certain commemorative types also feature different illustrations, and the coins from the Free Hanseatic Cities, which were not ruled by monarchs, display their coats of arms on their reverses instead of a person.
