        "text": "The range of new opportunities available to Latin American film-makers since the late 1990s has enabled the renaissance, stabilization and flourishing of production in many countries of that region and advanced the worldwide recognition of their work. Film festivals, government departments and multimedia conglomerates across the world have become important sources of support for Latin American filmmakers. However, these opportunities, interventions and contributions have often entailed compromises in artistic, logistical or thematic terms which have led to new forms of hierarchy and power structures. Indeed, each one brings with it an increasingly complex scenario involving multiple partners with their own needs, requirements, commitments and mission statements. Some of these are linked to ideological agendas, while others are borne out of philanthropic motivations, and others still are part of broader cultural strategies at pan-regional level. There have been several excellent studies on the funding mechanisms supporting the development of film production in contemporary Latin America. Investigations have explored the impact that co-production and supranational funding initiatives have had on the film industries of Latin America in the twenty-first century and have started to address the relationship between films and their European audiences, encouraged by the profits generated by titles such as Amores perros (Alejandro González Iñárritu, 2001) and Y tu mamá también (Alfonso Cuarón, 2002). As yet, the specific role played by the Latin America-based producer figure in rooting out and exploiting such sources for national and regional cinema remains largely overlooked. This essay focuses on the role of the contemporary cinematic producer based in Latin America, especially those who have chosen to develop more socially committed films. I argue that their role has become more crucial than ever to the progress made by the film industries of the region within an economic, cultural and political landscape framed by neoliberal discourses and practices that have been dominant since the 1990s when, according to Nick Couldry, they tended to be imposed as a condition of multilateral external finance (2010, vi). The essay draws attention to what I term the ‘contemporary committed’ cinema producer as a highly collaborative and intermediary figure, fundamental to addressing and fixing issues of access, agency and diversity, as well as to navigating the increasingly complex terrain of private enterprise, competition and free market. xxx While the main case study of this essay focuses on the work and influence of Enid ‘Pinky’ Campos, producer of some of the most significant award-winning productions to have been made in Peru in recent years, it is important to take into account the work of Stefan Kaspar, the Swiss-born founding producer of the Peruvian film collective Grupo Chaski which was founded in 1982 during the period when the protectionist cinema legislation was bearing fruit. Kaspar had studied literature and communications in Berne and in 1978 he made his first trip to Peru to research the theme of internal migration. The Grupo Chaski was formed by Kaspar with fellow filmmakers Marita Barea, Fernando Barreto, Fernando Espinoza and Alejandro Legaspi, Susana Pastor and René Weber, and grew to over sixty members by the late 1980s. Their work, in documentary, fiction, feature and short form, contained clear traces of the militant, revolutionary socialist legacy of the broader New Latin American Cinema movement of the 1950s and 1960s; indeed, they shared with that movement “a commitment to making films with and for a marginalized community and a desire to alter mainstream commercial filmmaking practices” (McClennen 2008). Like the other groups within that movement based in Argentina, Brazil, and Cuba, they set out to distinguish their practices from the hierarchical structures that they perceived as common in Hollywood and in auteur cinema, and to approach projects in a much more collaborative, community-oriented way. Grupo Chaski worked within the context of a protectionist cinema policy that had been developed in the 1960s and was introduced in 1972 as part of the ambitions of the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces whose agenda was not concerned with maintaining the power and wealth of the economic elite, but with appealing more broadly to the masses in order to secure ongoing electoral support and control. While Chaski refused to depend on the Peruvian state for direct resources, the group did benefit from the infrastructure developments of the 1970s and the renewed appetite for local cinema. Kaspar’s own European connections were undoubtedly useful in terms of securing collaborations with media companies such as the German television channel ZDF. The group also received funding from international charitable and philanthropic agencies such as UNESCO. Two decades later, Campos’ position as intermediary between the increasingly neoliberal competitive funding environment and a new generation of filmmakers keen to make their mark on a global scale holds resonances with predecessors working under different circumstances while also providing a new model for understanding and appreciating the value of the producer in early twenty-first century Latin American cinema more generally. The films that Campos has produced include Paloma de papel (Fabrizio Aguilar, 2003), Días de Santiago (Josué Méndez, 2004), NN (Héctor Gálvez, 2014) and Climas (Enrica Pérez, 2014), as well as Madeinusa (2006), the first feature by acclaimed director Claudia Llosa who put her country on the cinematic map by winning the Golden Bear in Berlin in 2009 (with the film La teta asustada). All these titles have achieved success and praise from critics, audiences and investors from within and beyond national borders, and have been noted for their distinctive blend of globally recognizable themes and styles with local cultural references. Paloma de papel, Días de Santiago and Madeinusa are included in the library of films with socially engaging themes and subject matters that the Grupo Chaski has established as part of its more recent Microcine network project across Peru. As Miriam Ross has noted, with this initiative, Kaspar ensured that the Grupo Chaski continued to engage with ‘responsible cinema’ in Peru and in 2003 decided to take advantage of digital change in order to “bring about opportunities for improvement in the areas of Latin American cinema that have historically had the greatest weaknesses” (Ross 2008). The points of contact between Kaspar and Campos transcend their mutual interest in socially-engaged films in that the Microcine project, while being part of the work of a non-profit organization with no commercial aims, exists only due to the efforts of its founders to secure investment from highly competitive sources such as Rotterdam’s Film Festival’s Hubert Bals Fund. Kaspar, as a seasoned producer, was a highly skilled negotiator and networker who recognized the urgent need to focus on alternative forms of distribution, and brought these skills to bear for the benefit of all the Grupo Chaski projects."
