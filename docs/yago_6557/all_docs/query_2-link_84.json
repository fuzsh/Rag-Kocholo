        "text": "About the Documentary\n\nThe Devil’s Miner is the story of 14-year-old Basilio Vargas and his 12-year-old brother Bernardino, who work in the ancient Cerro Rico silver mines of Bolivia. It is believed that more than eight million workers have perished in the mines since the 16th century.\n\nRaised without a father and living in extreme poverty with their mother and 6-year-old sister on the slopes of the mine, the boys assume many adult responsibilities. It takes two months’ work just to afford the clothing and supplies vital to their education. Without an education, the brothers have no chance to escape their destiny in the silver mines.\n\nThe Vargas boys chew coca leaves to stave off hunger and keep their wits about them during their long hours in the mines, where they also present offerings to El Tío, the malevolent spirit that is believed to reside there. Each mine has its own statue of the horned demon who guards the mine’s riches. According to local legend the mines are the exclusive province of El Tío, the protector and destroyer of the miners. El Tío is a miner’s only hope of salvation in this heavily Catholic region, where the people believe that the spirit of God does not exist in the hellish underworld inside the mountain.\n\nFilmmakers Kief Davidson and Richard Ladkani spent months with the Vargas family, journeying down into the Cerro Rico mines with Basilio, Bernardino, and the adult villagers who risk their lives to make a meager living. The result is both harrowing and moving, a portrait of a world where children risk their lives daily in hopes of an eventual better life — if the quest doesn’t kill them first.\n\nThe Filmmakers\n\nKief Davidson\n\nKief Davidson is an award-winning feature film and documentary director born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. His most recent film, The Devil’s Miner, had its world premiere at the Rotterdam Film Festival in 2005 and won over a dozen awards including: Tribeca Film Festival, Hot Docs/Toronto film festival, Chicago International film festival. Most recently, he was nominated for a Director’s Guild Award – Best Documentary Director, as well as Best Documentary Director for the European film prize. In addition, he has directed and produced documentaries for The Discovery Channel, ABC News, PBS and A&E. He is currently directing a feature length documentary about Kassim Ouma, junior middle-weight boxing champion of the world who was a child soldier from Uganda.\n\nKief began his filmmaking career in 1993 as editor on the Academy Award-nominated documentary, Blood Ties: The Life and Work of Sally Mann. He is the recipient of two Emmy nominations for his work with National Geographic, and on the journalistic film What’s News?, he earned an International Monitor Award for Best Editing. Kief currently divides his time between Los Angeles and New York City.\n\nRichard Ladkani\n\nRichard Ladkani has worked as director and cameraman on documentaries ranging from wildlife (Encounters with the Great White Shark) to political films like Escape Over the Himalayas, a film about Tibetan refugee children, that won 15 international awards. He has also worked as a cinematographer on big-budget historical documentaries involving large-scale reenactments as well as character-driven personal stories shot on location in Uzbekistan, Vietnam and Mongolia.\n\nA 20-part series, Monasteries of the Danube River, earned him the Austrian cinematography award for best picture. Richard prefers to be the cinematographer on the films he directs as often as possible. The Devil’s Miner is his first feature length documentary as a director.\n\nLeonardo Heiblum & Andres Solis\n\nSince 1993, Leonardo Heiblum and Andres Solis have composed, recorded and produced music for projects encompassing feature films, documentaries, advertising, dance and theater. Their feature credits include Joshua Marston’s Maria Full of Grace, Salma Hayak’s The Maldinado Miracle and Eva Lopez’ De que Phe Lado Estas. Leonardo was also music supervisor for Julie Taymor’s Frida. Leonardo and Andres co-own Audioflot, a state-of-the-art recording studio in Mexico City.\n\nFull Credits"
