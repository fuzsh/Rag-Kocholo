This 17th Annual compendium of the creative, of craftsmanship and experience brings all kinds of skills into focus, throughout this land and abroad.

In putting your message across. For example. Meadowgold (division of Beatrice Foods, Inc.) used a Niles produced show at a January, 1967 national sales meeting (photo top right I to excite 1,.500 of its sales personnel about new and existing products and programs. The show was an intercoupling of skits, speeches and slides, all of which were Niles produced and directed. For IGA ( Independent Grocers Alliance ). Niles produced an actual book musical comedy show (photo top lefti, complete with original music to stimulate enthusiasm among .5.000 dealers, and to show them why it's profitable to bepart of the IGA team. The show played three days in October. 1966 at Chicago's Arie Crown Theatre. For General Electric. Niles produced a clever show (photo bottom right , with only three cast members, that played to its general purpose control salesmen at meetings in Chicago. Philadelphia, Atlanta. Dallas and San Francisco, in February, 1967. For these three shows and many others. Niles handled the writing, the costuming, the sets, the original music, the lighting, and all the other elements that go into a live business show. And that includes writing executive speeches and coaching the speakers. And, where called for, slides, filmstrips and motion pictures.

Moviematic sold the dealers. When Pillsbury* came out with a new powdered drink, they had to come up with a way to tell dealers about it. And what better way, they thought, than to show dealers the actual commercials that kids would see on network television? The kids, in turn, would do a \"selling job\" on Mom. So Pillsbury equipped their representatives with portable Kalart/Victor 16mm Moviematic Repeater Projectors, and dealers pre-viewed the commercials; in color, and with sound. How about what you're selling? Moviematic will help sell it better. Applications? Sales training programs, exhib- its, display use, at point-of-purchase sales . . . you name it.

An associate company in France. Kodak Pathe, will continue to manufacture and market magnetic tapes overseas. Magnetic striping of film by Kodak, well received since 1952, will not be atfeclcd. Much-needed manufacturing space that now be- comes available through the mag- netic tape shut-down will be uti- lized for film manufacturing. The phase-out will have no significant effect on Kodak's overall business since the volume of tape sales was considered relatively small. • * * * Film Producers Guild Appoints Buckland Smith to Head Interfiira /~ G.

It was the first of its kind ever ex- tended any individual or associa- tion by the FPA. The award will now become an annual event. The Mayor was cited, according to executive director Harold Klein, for creating a one-stop location shooting permit procedure which provides greater availability of city buildings, schools, parks, etc. and for the agreement reached with local craft organizations which per- mits production of complete fea- tures under West Coast contract provisions. * * * Meet the FPA's New President Thomas J.

PAUL, MINNESOTA 2269 FORD PARKWAY I PA ELECTS DUNFOKD: (CONTINUED FROM PAGE EIGHT) and the other a student at Cornell. Joe Dunford behevcs that the FPA will take more positive steps this year to serve the whole film industry, members and non-mem- bers alike. FPA's Exeeutive Sec- retary, Harold Klein, has recently been in Los Angeles talking to producers there about mutual problems, with the idea that many of the West Coast producers' in- terests are beginning to merge with those of their New York counter- parts. Many Interests Represented The FPA track record is ex- cellent, Dunford thinks, in rep- resenting the varied interests of so many producers, equipment sup- pliers and service houses of wide- ly differing size. There is a lot of ego in the film industry, he rec- ognizes — a constant splitting-up and re-grouping of talent — but FPA has managed very well to present a stable viewpoint, and to serve as a steadying influence on the entire industry. Dunford hopes the FPA will be able to carry the favorable climate brought about by Mayor Lind- say's proposals to create more fea- ture film production in New York into the industrial and TV com- mercial fields. While there will al- ways be a lot of hollering back and forth in relations between the pro- ducers and the craft unions, ac- tually, both sides are cooperating very well. • * * * Cinema Arts & Sciences Society Re-Elects Gindhart as President is The Society of Cinema Arts & Sciences, serving filmakers in the Delaware Valley area from head- quarters in Philadelphia, Pa., has re-elected Charles T.

There are some notable excep- tions. Because we pride ourselves on being good reporters, as well as industry standard-bearers, there is news in these pages of festival com- petition in Chicago and New York which we do not cover in these de- tailed listings. Data on another tra- ditional event, the San Francisco International Film Festival, was unavailable for coverage in these Awards' data pages because of in- complete dates. Sponsored by the Greater San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, we are sure that it will continue to include a \"Film as Communication\" section. Watch for news in future issues. CINE Serves Festivals Abroad As for the international festival scene. U. S. participation is largely served by the tireless efforts of a national co-ordinating group: the Council on International Nonthe- atrical Events. CINE jurors are now regionally screening films for 1967 festival competition around the world. We emphasize in these pages that honors received from such notable groups as the National Committee on Films for Safety, the Freedoms Foundation, Farm Film Foundation and such experienced user groups as those who judge films for the Columbus Film Festi- val, the Educational Film Library Association, the Industry Film 14 Producers and the National Visual Presentation Association, are most deserving of participation and of industry support. We Don't Play \"Awards\" Game This publication has never de- meaned its neutral position by be- coming a promotion-minded spon- sor of such film awards. Instead. we serve and are served by the groups mentioned, contributing funds and time to work for CINE and others. We admit to a few misgivings — among them antipathy toward film festivals primarily ori- ented to theatrical entertainment motion pictures which happen to \"\"include\" the factual film as a sideshow attraction. And we urge private sponsors of film awards programs to seek out group spon- sorship— to engage and announce the services of known judges be- fore seeking entries from the field. * * * i; Active participation in the Eu- ropean-sponsored International In- dustrial Film Festivals has proven to us that (a) the industrial film is a medium of itself, deserving of full and expert attention and ( b ) that such an event can attract hundreds of top-level sponsor executives and has repeatedly captured the atten- tion of press representatives from throughout the European continent and England to its annual events. PRINCIPAL Awards of the Free- doms Foundation 1 8th annual competition for \"outstanding achievement in bringing about a better understanding of the Ameri- can Way of Life\" were presented on February 22nd to the Flick- Reedy Corporation, of Bensenville, Illinois, and to Coronet Instruc- tional Films, of Chicago.

Two Worlds, which \"\"demonstrates the vigorous strug- gle between freedom and commu- nism, contrasting the ideals and results of these divergent philoso- phies.\" Coronet's honor medal, the principal motion picture award for 1966 productions, was based on its educational film.

Atlanta Chicago Cleveland New Orleans Washington. DC. 17th PRODUCTION REVIEW 19 NUMBER FIVE IN A SERIES WHAT PRICE 8MM ! For years, educators have been patiently waiting for our industry to develop a low-cost sound motion picture system tor use in the expanding audio-visual field. Prerequisites of such a system arc: A small, lightweight, and compara- tively inexpensive sound projector, so designed that any school child can operate it. It must require practically no maintenance. The picture must be bright, sharp, of good contrast and color. The sound must be distinct, intelligible and tree from distortion. (Any deficiency in pic- ture or sound would make our youngsters conscious of the medium and distract from the subject matter.) Print cost must be low. Prints must be packaged in inexpensive magazines to eliminate handling and threading. Magazines must be easy to catalog, file and shelve. Because of the print cost factor, attention focused on amateur 8mm silent film. One-half as wide as 16mm, and running at one-half the linear speed, everyone concluded that prints would sell at one-quarter the price of 16mm. Optical sound normally employed in motion pictures unfortunately could not be used on amateur 8mm film because there was insuffi- cient space to accommodate it, so a magnetic stripe vvas applied to the narrow edge of the film. The major objection to this 8mm format is that recording on pre- or post-striped material makes it too expensive. I once saw a bill from a lab for ten 8mm color positive magnetic sound prints in this format — 66 feet each at $.10 per foot. Each print cost $6.60. The same print in 16mm with optical sound track would amount to 132 feet at S.076, totaling $10.03. 8mm with magnetic sound does not meet our objective of one-quarter the 16mm price. It isn't even one-half! In addition to the S6.60 for the print, the magazine cost $11.20, mounting $.50, print waxing $2.00, totaling $20.30. Would you believe — 8mm at twice the price of 16mm ! Both magnetic sound and magazine costs put us out of the ballpark. Incidentally, about seven years ago, Eastman Kodak introduced a magnetic sound projector using this format, without magazine. It didn't sell because 8mm mag- netic sound was too expensive for the amateur, as well as the educa- tor. This format still has some limited use in sales presentations on portable projectors where price is not a major factor. A very clever engineer and pioneer in our industry had the idea that if the width of 8mm perforations were reduced there would be enough room to put an optical track on the sprocket side of the film. This pro- posal was made by John Maurer and called the \"M-8\" format. Maurer also suggested that new dimensions be adopted, increasing the picture area 20Vr over the old silent picture. To cut costs, multirank printing and processing seemed desirable — that is — two 8's side-by-side on 16mm, or four on 35mm. Maurer's reduction in perforation width in no way prevents printing and processing multirank prints on slightly modified 16 or 35/32 laboratory equipment. Another way of reducing cost would be to use a photocell that reads dye track in our 8mm projector. This will eliminate the very critical track application that often results in costly reprints. Incidentally, there are two types of processing machines. The more dependable in my opinion is the \"sprocket drive\" where the perfora- tions of the film are engaged on sprocket teeth to transport the film. The other type is friction or \"tendency drive\" where film is trans- ported on rollers by friction. I have often wondered if this machine was so named because of its \"tendency\" to scratch the base side of the film. Film with our Maurer format can be physically processed on the tendency machine without change, but slight modifications of the teeth on the sprocket machine might be necessary. After processing, o.ur multirank 8mm pictures would be inspected on high speed projectors, then slit into 8mm sections. Now the laboratory slit edge will be the projector guide edge, so any inaccuracy in slitting will cause weave and unsteadiness on the screen. This is one of the problems with the multirank technique. To cut cost, our inspection must be done before slitting, so weave unfortunately cannot be de- tected. Should 8mm release be printed by reduction or contact? Reduction printing is slower, more expensive — but better. Today's negative emul- sions are not good enough to make optimum 8mm contact prints. Ail 8mm prints have poor definition. It's only a matter of 'how poor' can you tolerate. The fact that you are buying 8mm, or considering it, indi- cates you are more price conscious than quality conscious. To achieve the lowest price, contact printing both picture and track is a must. The multirank 8mm printing negative used in contact printing is made by printing down one side of the film and up the other side. But how do we make a timing change when the scene to be corrected is never opposite the same scene in the other rows? So, we have to make our multirank negative with all rows of 8mm images going in the same direction. Final corrections can now be made in the release without re- making the expensive negative. This procedure also simplifies syncing track with picture. All these problems were being discussed in 1960 and '61. Unfortu- nately at the beginning, Maurer's optical sound left something to be desired quality-wise. In the Summer of 1961, I heard our own experi- mental direct positive 8mm optical sound and was impressed. 1 also heard our own 8mm contact print and was surprised how good it was. 1 knew then that our industry was on the right track and would soon have something to offer the educational market. Now, most of the problems were solved, and the rest would be ironed out with experience. So — the show is about to go on the road ! But wait ! Hold everything ! Another 8mm format was being discussed. It was designed to make the picture 50% larger than the old silent film, and because there was very little space, it was to have a magnetic track. This is called \"Super-8\". This film is also 8mm in width, but in order to make the picture larger, the perfs were made smaller and placed very close to the edge of the film. In addition, the distance be- tween the perforations was increased. This, of course, increased the length of the film by about lOVf, which automatically meant 10'.' increased costs. Because there will be no professional shooting in 8mm, how do we get the 8mm images on the multirank contact printing negative? Ob- viously, by optical reduction from 16mm. Therefore, it is desirable to have a simple ratio for both speed and picture dimensions between 16mm and 8mm film. The ratio of the total width of 16 to 8 is 2 to 1. The height and width of M-8 projected picture is 507f of 16mm di- mensions. Super-8 picture is approximately 559c of 16mm. Both 8mm formats have the same picture proportions, but Maurer's is a direct 2 to 1 reduction, while Super-8 is 1.818-h to 1. The speed of 16mni film is precisely 36 feet a minute. The ratio of 16mm speed to M-Ji speed is also an exact 2 to 1, or 18 feet a minute on the nose. Thi speed ratio of 16mm to Super-8 is a complex figure of 1.799640072 t' ■ 1. This results in an unorthodox speed of 20.004 feet a minute. It bi comes a little complicated! The location of the small sprocket hole is so close to the edge that there is great concern whether this film will actually wear well. As .* matter of fact, the engineers who designed the format must ha\\< recognized this weakness. Splices are always made at the frame lint and always involve the area around the perforation. The perf in thi^ Super-8 format, being so close to the edge, would be susceptible to serious damage by splicing. So the small perf was moved from ihv frame line to a new position on the edge of the film opposite the middle of the picture vertically. But why was the perf extended intu the printed picture area! All labs have experienced difficulty in print- ing film shot with certain cameras that have the picture aperture run- ning into the perforation. There is always the possibility of picking up 'flare' because the film base acts like a lucite rod and carries light to the edges of the perforation, causing a fogged area. 1 predict there will be problems with certain types of scenes when contact printed in Super-8. Why would magnetic sound ever be adopted in preference to optical on any 8mm format? (Incidentally, I just learned that a well known lab is putting optical sound on Super-8. This is a step in the right direc- tion.) Magnetic projectors cost less than optical, but the slight addi- tional cost for an optical system is well justified and does not upset our goal for an inexpensive projector. The magnetic balance stripe on the edge of the film offers protection to this fragile area and sup- posedly increases the life of the print. I disagree with the idea that we should use a more expensive pre-stripcd magnetic raw stock to cover up weaknesses in the film dimensions. Pre-striped magnetic material certainly costs more to manufacture, but many in the industry think it might be offered at the same price as unstriped raw stock. If the mar- gin of profit is large enough to absorb the additional expensive pre- stripping operation, then there certainly should be a reduction in the price of film stock that is not pre-striped. To avoid a separate magnetic recording operation, the natural ap- proach would be to record the sound at the same time the picture is printed. But this requires a complicated printer and extra cost. More Important, increased labor costs, because in addition to our printer operator, we probably will have to add a recording technician or two. Is 8mm magnetic track better quality than 8mm optical? No ! However, a poor 8mm magnetic track may be better than a poor 8mm optical track, but if they are both good, I doubt if you can tell the difference. Magnetic or optical sound tracks located on the sprocket edge of the film will not deliver optimum sound quality and are susceptible to Injury. Claims have been made that magnetic track is ideal for teaching be- cause it enables the student or teacher to change the track. It seems to mc this is one thing that no one should ever be able to do. Thou- sands of dollars were put into this track and if it doesn't fit the school program, why buy the film. If a school projector has provision for erasing and recording, I shudder to think what will be on some of the tracks in the high school grades — accidentally or otherwise. And what about the destructive child loose in the library with a magnet ! Now, if the industry accepts this super-duper 8 with the unorthodox perforations, pitch and speed — a lab must purchase a lot of new equipment. Printers, processing machines, splicers, inspection projec- tors, synchronizers, slitters, etc. An investment of at least a half million dollars. This doesn't help bring prices down. The small perfs used in Super-8, which do not fit existing sprocket machines, are very susceptible to damage. It is not recommended that these perls be used to transport the film in the printing and processing operations because any slight injury to the perfs would cause an un- steady picture. Consideration has been given by some labs to the idea of printing three 8mm images (instead of four) on 35mm film perfo- rated for Supcr-8, but with the edge of the film perforated with either standard 35 perfs or 16 perfs for the 35/32 machines. These perfs used for film transport will not be used in the final product. Our processed film will be slit into three useable 8mm sections, a total of 24mm. We throw away 11mm of finished film which represents almost one-half the amount we sell ! What a way to reduce price I One important fact that we haven't discussed is the distributor's cost problem. Everything else being equal, his overhead and administrative costs are the same to sell an 8mm print as a 16mm print. Rent, salaries, phone, advertising, promotion, won't change a bit. So will a distributor cut his price, unless he achieves tremendous volume? If release requirements ever reach the astronomical figures that are being bandied about, isn't it possible that the industry could sharpen its perKil and offer 16mm release prints at prices fairly competitive to byroi the over-priced 8mm. Why not lake a new look at the existing 16mm market. There has been nothing radically new in 16mm projector de- sign for years. Why don't we have an inexpensive, portable, magazine load 16mm projector with a photocell that reads dye track? Are the manufacturers so complacent they think there is no room for im- provement? Labs have recently received notice of a new special color stock with finer grain, greater definition, and better resolution that will be manu- factured for use in printing 8mm only. Is this an admission thatSuper-8, and perhaps all 8, needs improving? And why limit this improvement to 8? If the industry knows how to make a better film, make it avail- able for 16mm, 35mm and 70mm ! How was this Super-8 conceived? .My obser\\ation is: to pep up a stag- nant still camera market, a film manufacturer designed a small camera, extremely easy to operate, that loads instantly, with a simple maga- zine. The sales promotion was so successful the company now looked at the sluggish home movie market and decided to apply the same technique. 8mm movie cameras were being designed with the same features. Then the big decision — start from scratch. Forget the old equipment in the field and make a whole new line of equipment, cameras and projectors, based on a new film concept. So, Super-8 was born ! Now our merchandisers must have looked at the educational market, and thought — \"Why not kill two birds with one stone\" — apply the same Super-8 format to the educational market. Super-8 is by no means an accident. It is the result of a well-planned design and merchandising program for the home movie maker. 5uper-8 may be super' for the amateur, but dont-force-it-down-the-profes- sional's-throat. Incidentally, I differentiate between amateur and pro- fessional: the professional projects prints — the amateur projects his original. Since the Super-8 format was introduced, the industry has been mark- ing time — afraid to piake a decision which format to adopt — afraid to fight city hall — afraid to invest money in new equipment that may be junked tomorrow. Because of Super-8, aM 8mm has been standing still. To help the situation a film manufacturer is installing a model Super-8 release laboratory in the hope they can teach us 'how to do it.' On September 26, 1964, when the industry was trying to learn how to do it,' The Association of Cinema Laboratories met at the Commodore Hotel in New York to discuss 8mm problems. Representatives from all related fields were invited to this forum. This same film manufacturer received and accepted an invitation to participate, but no one showed up. However, two days later at the same hotel, at a meeting of the Laboratory Practice Committee of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, seven representatives of this film manufacturer were in attendance. A 16-page document covering all facets of the Supcr-8 system was submitted for consideration as proposed American Standards. A request was made (or early adoption even though \"the system had received no market place acceptance.\" Has too much water gone over the dam, or is there still lime to stop and take a final look before we leap? If we have passed the point of no return, why not accept the Maurer concept with an optical dye track as the most sensible, practical and economic solution. All labs can be in 8mm with a minimum of delay and expense. Prints with this format will come closest to our target of one-quarter the price of 16mm. You might conclude that I am opposed to all 8mm. Not entirely. I do not believe that any 8mm is Rood enough for class viewing. I do be- lieve that any 8mm is perfectly satisfactory for the single concept film for close-up viewing on small screens. If 8mm can be made and sold at greatly reduced prices, and we can open up a whole new market for the educators — I am for it! But if it fouls up a good 16mm market that already exists — with an inferior product — at vcr>' httle saving — I am against it! •-. 22 BUSINESS SCREEN • 1967 AWARDS COMPETITION FOR BUSINESS FILMS THE AMERICAN FILM FESTIVAL Sponsored by the Educational Film Library Association New York City May 10-13, 1967 ■^ The 1967 American Film Festival, spon- sored by the Educational Film Library Asso- ciation, representing school, university and public libraries, and film libraries throughout the U.S. will be held May 10-13 at the^Bilt- more Hotel, New York City.

That's why the Arriflex 15BL was designed from the start for heavy-duty location filming — with ruggedness and reliability built-in. Arriflex 16BL's sure reliability is centered on the famous Arri mirror- shutter/registration-movement — famous for proven performance in millions upon millions of film footage. Another major contributor to the 16BL's reputation for dependability is the Arri Quick-Change magazine system — the system that masters the toughest location assignments because its design makes no compromise with reliability. It places the entire film gate — rear pressure pad and all— protecti»ely in the camera head. There it serves to locate the film precisely and unfailingly in the focal plane — safe from bumps, nicks, scratches and deformation, Arriflex 16BL's has-what-it-takes features include an fps tachometer and digital footage counter for verified visual proof of camera speed and expended film footage— indications that can mean the difference between film in the \"can\" or film in the trash box. VlKoAMLIIT And it takes more than a \"Johnny-One-Note\" filming tool to assure the hardworking filmmaker of a full and profitable return on his investment. It takes a truly versatile camera to handle a broad scope of assignments. That's why the Arriflex 16BL was designed with its classical configuration — the right configuration for every filming technique— tradi- tional or verite.
