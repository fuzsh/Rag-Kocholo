        "text": "On 24 March 1976 a military junta deposed President María Estela Martínez de Perón and assumed power in Argentina. From the first days of the takeover, the authorities worked vigorously to restore what they defined as legitimate Argentine values. This article shows how the family became a focal point of the government's efforts because of its double function as an agent of and a target for renovation. A microcosm of the Argentine nation, the family was considered the basic building block of society, a guarantor of the civic well-being of the nation and, as such, an important ally of the authoritarian state in the fight to restore Argentina's ‘traditional’ values. The analysis focuses on the civic-military regime's efforts to fashion a family canon, which would become the only legitimate version of the Argentine family, and the broad repertoire of strategies used to impose it on the Argentine population.\n\n3 The number of people disappeared during El Proceso remains controversial and figures oscillate between 8,000 and 30,000 people. In 1984, President Alfonsín appointed a blue-ribbon commission to investigate the human-rights violations committed during the military regime. The Comisión Nacional sobre la Desaparición de Personas (National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons, CONADEP) reported 8,960 cases of missing individuals. Human-rights organisations in Argentina contested this figure and argued that the numbers reached 30,000 people. Scholars and human-rights organisations have written about the politics of counting and the difficulties involved in establishing a clear estimate on the numbers of people disappeared during Argentina's last military dictatorship. See, for example, Brysk, Alison, ‘The Politics of Measurement: The Contested Count of the Disappeared in Argentina’, Human Rights Quarterly, 16: 4 (1994), pp. 676–92CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n6 The role attributed to the family during El Proceso bears some similarities with Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy as both regimes exalted the role of the family in the construction of the new order. Families became targets of policies that intended to transform them into institutions that served the state and provided a tool for state intervention into the private sphere. Both regimes set themselves to expunge the elements that were perceived as legacies from the past while at the same time forging a new public-minded family that accepted its patriotic duty and the authority of the Nazi and fascist states. However, whereas in Argentina the authorities identified the family as an equal partner to restore the traditional order, Nazi and fascist policies subordinated the family to the state and transformed it into a vehicle of state policy. In contrast to Argentina, both regimes prioritised the reproductive rather than the educational role of the family. The promotion of large families in Germany and Italy became not only an instrument to increase the population but also an important eugenic tool. The strong linkage between the idea of family and the idea of race in both regimes represents an important difference with the Argentine case. See Victoria de Grazia, How Fascism Ruled Women: Italy, 1922–1945 (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1992); and Lisa Pine, Nazi Family Policy, 1933–1945 (London and New York: Bloomsbury Academic, 1997).\n\n8 A feature peculiar to many twentieth-century dictatorships was the concern with moulding the minds of the younger generations and their reliance on a number of different tools. Similar to Argentina, Germany and Italy were engaged in the project of creating a new man and sought to reform their respective educational systems for the political indoctrination of the youth. However, in Italy and Germany indoctrination was reinforced with mobilisation through youth movements. These state-sponsored organisations were seen as superior instruments to indoctrinate the youth in the values, beliefs and attitudes considered essential for the future existence of the nation. The educational system was not the only instrument used to infiltrate social spaces. As was the case in Argentina, Nazi Germany and fascist Italy relied on mass means of communication to extend their grip into the private sphere. Scholars have pointed out how Hitler and Mussolini used radio to disseminate their messages to the larger population through periodic broadcasts that reiterated the most important elements of Nazi and fascist ideology. For more on these topics, see Eden McLean, Mussolini's Children: Race and Elementary Education in Fascist Italy (Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press, 2018); Lisa Pine, Education in Nazi Germany (London and New York: Bloomsbury Academic: 2010); and Alessio Ponzio, Shaping the New Man: Youth Training Regimes in Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany (Wisconsin, WI: University of Wisconsin Press, 2015).\n\n17 Although the junta blamed the last Peronist government as the origin of the challenges to ‘traditional Argentine values’, Valeria Manzano's work has demonstrated that challenges to traditional social structures had started in the mid-1950s. The analysis places the youth as the most dynamic actor of the two decades that followed the Revolución Libertadora (1955). Their political radicalisation and cultural rebellion challenged authority and attempted to bring radical changes to Argentine society. Valeria Manzano, The Age of Youth in Argentina: Culture, Politics, and Sexuality from Perón to Videla (Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2014).\n\n20 The ‘war against subversion’, a priority in the military agenda, was understood as the eradication of a wide range of ‘internal enemies’ who threatened Argentine traditions and institutions. The military authorities defined ‘subversive’ in very broad terms as anybody who harboured ideas against the nation. The vagueness of the definition allowed the regime to persecute not only those who took up arms against the nation but also anybody who manifested any dissent. As Invernizzi and Gociol have pointedly argued, ‘everything that was Marxist was subversive, but not everything that was subversive was necessarily Marxist’. Invernizzi and Gociol, Un golpe a los libros, p. 50.\n\n40 The civics curriculum became a contested space in the Argentine educational system during the second half of the twentieth century. The programme was created in the late nineteenth century and was incorporated to the secondary-school curriculum as ‘Instrucción Cívica’. During the administration of Juan Domingo Perón it was renamed ‘Doctrina Nacional y Cultura Ciudadana’. The 1955 military coup changed the content and renamed the subject ‘Doctrina Nacional y Educación Democrática’. In 1973, the democratic government created a new subject and named it ‘Estudios de la Realidad Social Argentina (ERSA)’. For more on changes to the school curriculum, see Romero, La Argentina en la escuela.\n\n50 In his 1976 speech to commemorate Argentine independence, General Videla commented on the role of subversive ideologies in the promotion of what he defined as ‘anti-values’, such as betrayal, crime, cruelty and family disruption. Along the same lines, the brochure Marxismo y subversión identified the family as a ‘primordial target of “subversive” forces’ that penetrated the home and ‘derided fundamental [family] values such as honour, loyalty, love, heroism, and abnegation’. Educational authorities added their voices to the military anxieties over lost family values. In 1977, during the inauguration of the academic year, Minister Bruera expressed concern over the erosion of paternal authority and the disruption of family life, and stressed the need for the school system to remedy the situation. EMGE, Compendio de documentos, p. 54; EMGE, Marxismo y subversión, p. 19; and Ricardo Bruera, ‘Iniciación del curso lectivo 1977’.\n\n64 The regime relied on a number of agencies to control the media, such as the Secretaría de Información Pública [Secretariat of Public Information, SIP], the Secretaría de Prensa y Difusión [Secretariat of Press], the Secretaría de Comunicaciones [Federal Communication Commission, SECOM], the Agencia Nacional de Noticias [Federal News Bureau, TELAM], the Comité Federal de Radiodifusión [Federal Bureau of Radio Broadcasting, COMFER], the Dirección General de Radio y Televisión [General Bureau of Radio and Television], the Instituto Nacional de Cinematografía [National Institute of Cinematography, INC], the Ente de Calificación Cinematográfica [Classification and Rating Bureau], and the list goes on. The individuals in charge of these agencies were members of the armed forces and they were tasked with regulating content, preventing dissent and reinforcing the military cultural and social agendas.\n\n68 This was not the only piece in the magazine calling on the authorities to revise the curriculum. In 1978 Gente published a letter to the minister of education titled: ‘Dr. Catalán, this should worry you’. The letter expressed relief about the successful end of the war against ‘subversion’ but warned the educational authorities about the other war, the one waged at the ideological level. The author presented two history textbooks that ‘used language and presented ideas that were too similar to the ideologies of Marxist subversion’. To support the claim, the article quoted phrases that were considered as dangerous to students’ minds. For example, ‘Economic liberalism and the Industrial Revolution created a new social structure in which the worker became a slave who was expected to passively accept the situation’ or ‘The new urban proletariat, facing inequality and low salaries, can barely survive’. The author urged the authorities to act quickly to control and correct the situation. Varela Cid, Los sofistas, p. 76.\n\n82 The return to a democratic government opened a new chapter in family discourses and policies in Argentina. Since the 1980s, the government has introduced changes to family law that regulated the rights of minors, adoption, domestic violence and civil unions. A major change to marriage legislation took place in 1987 with the legalisation of divorce. Another major milestone in family policies was achieved in 2010 with the legalisation of same-sex marriage, making Argentina the first nation in Latin America to do so."
