        "text": "e was born in Buenos Aires, in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of San Telmo. The corners of the streets Bernardo de Irigoyen and Humberto Primero echoed the melodies of tangos that José whistled with great enthusiasm.\n\nThe boy had lost his family and he was adopted by a woman called Rosa, his adoptive mother. Doña Rosa erased the kid's resentment that could have arisen because of the fatality of having lost his parents and she offered him a happy childhood.\n\nAt age twelve our future star began to work in a factory for handbags production to help his humble family. Then he used to sit down in front of the houses to listen to Carlos Gardel's voice played by some victrola.\n\nHis fervent desire to sing drove him to visit taverns until his friend the actor Norberto Aroldi got for him an audition with maestro Mariano Mores in 1961. With an orchestra of forty musicians Mores approved of him and hired him. So his victories began with his present sobriquet: Néstor Fabián.\n\nOn August 30, 1961 he made his debut on television, in channel 7, at the program Luces de Buenos Aires. Néstor performed the bolero “La noche de mi amor” accompanied by Mariano Mores to great success and he achieved a first television hit in the program El show de Cap, where he would then sing as vocalist of the Mariano Mores orchestra.\n\nHe started in theater at important musicals such as: Buenos Aires de seda y percal and Buenas Noches, Buenos Aires which was premiered at the Teatro Astral, along with Mores himself, Virginia Luque and Susy Leiva.\n\nHe began to record discs in the Odeon company. They liked his voice as well as his style and the public began to love him. His first recording was “Tan solo un loco amor”, accompanied by Mariano Mores and his orchestra.\n\nSince 1964 his fame grew without stop, and television summoned him to make him a leading actor, so he joined the juvenile programs of the new Argentine wave, where the interpretations sung by his voice achieved a tough tone showcased in tango, plus his nice figure of Buenos Aires man.\n\nNéstor split with the Mores's company to join the songs of the so-called new Argentine wave. The officials of channel 9, headed by Alejandro Romay, summoned the young singer to join the program Sábados Continuados, emceed by Antonio Carrizo.\n\nIn January 1964, the popular female singer Violeta Rivas needed a gallant actor for a summer television soap opera and Romay hired Néstor for his first role on television, in a hit entitled Todo es Amor.\n\nIn March 1967 Néstor Fabián married Violeta Rivas. Their marriage meant a true social event where the popularity exploded in the fervent public.\n\nThe arrival of their daughter Analía completed the family happiness. Néstor traveled to different venues in our country and to several places of the world. Success never abandoned him and he recorded a wide repertoire of tangos with the most important orchestras. He was awarded and was starred in musical comedies and in special shows for television.\n\nA record of his which sold most was “Charade”, a waltz composed by Henry Mancini which was an Oscar-nominated theme song of an Amercian movie and which Néstor made a popular hit in Argentina.\n\nSoon he ventured into movies and was starred on several films: Buenas noches, Buenos Aires (1964), produced and directed by Hugo del Carril, with Mariano Mores, Violeta Rivas, Virginia Luque, Julio Sosa, Susy Leiva, Anibal Troilo, Chico Novarro and other greats of our music.\n\nViaje de una noche de verano (1965), directed by René Mujica, among other directors and a cast headed by: Tato Bores, Ramona Galarza, Chico Novarro and Luis Sandrini among others.\n\nLos muchachos de antes no usaban gomina (1969), directed by Enrique Carreras, with Rodolfo Bebán, Beba Bidart, Susana Campos, Osvaldo Miranda, Carlos Estrada, Nora Cárpena, Sabina Olmos and others. Néstor sings the tango “Tiempos viejos” in an important part of the movie.\n\nViva la vida (1969), directed by Enrique Carreras, with Palito Ortega, Violeta Rivas, Tita Merello, Hugo del Carril, Mercedes Carreras, Juan Carlos Dual and other famous ones.\n\nPasión dominguera (1970), directed by Emilio Ariño, with Jorge Porcel, Luis Tasca, Perla Caron, Fidel Pintos.\n\nBalada para un mochilero (1971), directed by Carlos Rinaldi, with: José Marrone, Mariángeles, Arnaldo André and Los Iracundos, among others.\n\nNéstor sang the main songs of famous TV soap operas written by Abel Santa Cruz like Me llaman gorrión, featuring Beatriz Taibo and Malevo with Rodolfo Bebán and Gabriela Gili. Later he was summoned to sing the title song of the soap opera Tengo calle.\n\nIn the seventies he was exclusive artist of the Microfón record company.\n\nIn 1974 he appeared in Russia to great success accompanied by Atilio Stampone.\n\nIn 1988 he was specially invited to sing in Granada, Spain, next to the orchestra of Osvaldo Requena. From there he went to Portugal to appear in Lisbon, Portugal.\n\nToday he continues delighting a public of all ages, leaving an indelible echo in each scenario, where he sings like nobody else does tangos such as: “El último round”, “Tinta roja”, “Cordón”, “El último café”, “Contame una historia”, “Los mareados”, “Sur”.\n\nFabián says he is a fan of motorcycles, tango music and the soccer team Boca Juniors.\n\nNéstor Fabián, maybe, is one of most loved persons by his partners and friends for his loyalty and his human quality. Simplicity and generosity are for him a way of life."
