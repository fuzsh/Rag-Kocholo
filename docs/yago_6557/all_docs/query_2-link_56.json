In this regard, the research on creating a surface which destroys or inhibits the adherence of microbial/viral entities has gained renewed interest. Although many research reports are available on the antibacterial materials or coatings, there is a relatively small amount of data available on the use of antiviral materials. However, with more research geared toward this area, new information is being added to the literature every day. The combination of antibacterial and antiviral chemical entities represents a potentially path-breaking intervention to mitigate the spread of disease-causing agents. In this review, we have surveyed antibacterial and antiviral materials of various classes such as small-molecule organics, synthetic and biodegradable polymers, silver, TiO2, and copper-derived chemicals. The surface protection mechanisms of the materials against the pathogen colonies are discussed in detail, which highlights the key differences that could determine the parameters that would govern the future development of advanced antibacterial and antiviral materials and surfaces.\n\nKeywords: antibacterial, antiviral, COVID-19, polymers, nanomaterials\n\nIntroduction\n\nNanotechnology plays a vital role in treating an expected and unexpected infectious diseases that are caused by bacteria and viruses.1 In general, antimicrobial agents are chemical substances that are either bioactive polymer/synthesized polymer in combination with or without nanoparticles (NPs). In particular, antibacterial properties of NPs are widely proven and show a significant response even at lower concentrations due to their high surface to volume ratio.2 Their function is mainly to act as an antimicrobial agent to inhibit the growth or kill the pathogenic microbes, namely, bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Recently, many organic compounds including polymers/biopolymers have shown potential as antibacterial and antiviral agents to tackle the infections caused by harmful bacteria and viruses.2−4 Hybrid antimicrobial coating materials comprising copper, silver, and zinc cations have also shown great virucidal effects in controlling the severe viruses such as influenza H1N1, HIV-1, dengue type 2 viruses, and human herpesvirus 1. This excellent virucidal effects of these NPs make them excellent virucides to be applied in common surfaces toward tackling infection spread and disastrous levels of disease in the populace.5,6\n\nThe recent worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in more than 20 million people being afflicted with the disease and the virus is widely referred to as COVID-19.7,8 This disease initially causes severe respiratory complications and can become life-threatening by disrupting the function of key organs. In 2003 and 2012, similar viral infections took hold among the human population which were named as a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), respectively.9 Another deadly virus disease caused by Influenza A viruses claimed many people’s lives and created a pandemic.10 However, COVID-19 is considered to be more dangerous than other infections caused by coronaviruses because it is more contagious compared to other pathogens.9 The knowledge about the mode of spreading of SARS-CoV-2 has been evolving since this disease was discovered, primarily because this virus is new to the human population and has spread fast. The action of this virus is complicated as it has undergone multiple mutations during all clinical trial efforts; hence, no medicine has yet been found to cure the diseases caused by this virus, despite worldwide trials.11 Therefore, until suitable vaccines or therapies are available, preventative measures are of prime importance to curtail the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Toward this, a deeper understanding is necessary to safeguard everyone from the possible virus spread or infections which are believed to be mainly transmitted by touching contaminated surfaces and by being in the vicinity of exhaled droplets.12−14\n\nDirect human to human transmission of the virus can be avoided by following physical distancing norms, wearing masks, and maintaining hygiene practices.15 However, the other possible route for COVID-19 transmission is indirect contact, which is the biggest threat as it uses inanimate objects as pathogen reservoir/carrier to propagate the infection.16−21 Common infected surfaces that could cause virus transmission are telephones, lift buttons, light and/fan switches, handrails, taps, and benches.22 Once the virus is attached on hands, it gets transferred to eyes, nose, mouth as the virus is capable of living in air and on surfaces from hours to few days.23 Significant literature data is available about the indirect transmission caused by human coronaviruses, namely, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2,24 through aerosol media and from various surfaces,25 i.e., cardboard, stainless steel, copper, plastic, and other healthcare-related materials available in hospital environments.23 The lifetime of the coronavirus on stainless steel, plastic, aerosols, cardboard, and copper was found to be 72, 72, 3, 24, and 4 h, respectively.25 In addition to this, there is a great concern for fungal infections, particularly hospital-acquired infections.26 This type of healthcare-associated infections (HIAs) causes significant morbidity and mortality which brings additional enormous associated costs.22 Also, the most susceptible people for HIAs are the immunocompromised patients, notably those suffering from AIDS.27,28 Similar to bacteria, adherence of fungi to biotic and abiotic surfaces poses a challenge in the removal of the biofilm communities,29 which further intensifies the severity of microbial infections. For example, one of the most common pathogen species called Candida causes hospital-acquired bloodstream infections in the United States, with around 400 000 cases a year worldwide, which are often associated with implanted medical devices.27,30,31 Globally, the reported deaths due to antimicrobial-resistant infections is nearly 700 000 per year.22 If new antibiotics are not developed to mitigate the rise of antimicrobial resistance, then by 2050, the world economy has to spend US$100 trillion on such infections and related issues which are predicted to affect the lives of more than 10 million people per year.22\n\nGoogle Scholar data estimates that among the coronavirus related publications as of April 20, 2020, nearly 39 100 were published from the time of outbreak (January 2020).32 Few reports and review papers summarized the clinical characteristics, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and COVID-19 management.33,34 One of the modes of virus spread or any microbial community spread in healthcare environments is mainly through infections due to frequent touching of infected places, namely, doorknobs, switches, personal protective equipment, and wooden or plastic surfaces.35 Hence, there is a need for techniques to prevent these surfaces from harboring microbes which can be through the use of antimicrobial/antiviral coatings. As prevention is a fundamental concept to combat or reduce the infections due to infected surfaces, there is an increasing need for identifying materials which possess antimicrobial/antiviral functionalities to minimize the spread of infections. Recent reports have summarized the design of engineered surfaces by forming self-assembled monolayers for the detection and prevention against SARS-COV-2.36,37 Advanced development in the area of nanobiotechnology has led to the development of a variety of materials that have potential as antibacterial agents and biomedical catalysts.38−40 Nanotechnology advancements have enabled researchers to control the physicochemical characteristics of metallic nanomaterials to develop suitable nontoxic antimicrobial drugs, which shows high potentiality in the medicine field.41−43 In the ongoing pandemic, antimicrobial metal NPs could be one of the effective solutions to address this issue. These NPs are active antibacterial agents due to their large active surface area which allows them to easily penetrate biofilms. Even before the pharmaceutical antibiotic revolution, some metals such as silver (Ag) and copper (Cu) were employed as antimicrobial agents. The progress in this field is continuous, and a new class of “nanometallo-antibiotics” has emerged which involves studying various NPs for their antimicrobial properties.44−46 Beginning in the 19th century with the discovery of a direct correlation between the evolution of disease and pathogens, medical research has witnessed a paradigm shift on the focus of the development of metal-based antimicrobial agents. Furthermore, this resulted in several scientific types of research to study the antimicrobial effect of metallic copper and its compounds, which unlike silver is due to a faster and higher microbicidal efficacy shown by copper against pathogens in the ambient environment. Due to its biocompatible nature, TiO2 is one of the most commonly used semiconductors for antimicrobial applications in contemporary literature. Therefore, few selective metallic or oxide NPs (copper, silver, and titanium dioxide (TiO2)) which are superior and cost-effective in providing the antimicrobial properties through functional coatings are currently focused in this review. Detailed attention is paid to some of the important synthetic, natural, and biodegradable antimicrobial polymers which possess demonstrated functional characteristics as well as display rapid inactivation of a broad spectrum of microorganisms.47\n\nNovelty\n\nKeeping an eye on the current pandemic situation and its timely need to protect the surfaces which are unavoidable from day-to-day touch, we propose to bring out all the very basic information on antiviral and antimicrobial coatings and their applications. This review also highlights the perspectives of antimicrobial treatments mainly related to biomaterial surfaces or coatings. Furthermore, the estimated antimicrobial coatings market potential by 2021 would be US$4.19 billion with an additional compound annual growth rate of 12.1% considering it from the years 2016–2021.48 Hence, the purpose of this review is to concisely present the application of important metal NPs and polymer-based materials on the contribution of antimicrobial coating formulations. Review articles related to functional characteristics and importance of antimicrobial coatings for preventing possible microbial colonization growth or spreads on vulnerable surface touches are rarely reported. The Web of Science data on antimicrobial materials for microbial repellent coatings and its potential applications are presented in .\n\nRecently, efforts are focused toward the development of smart and antimicrobial surface creations against the microbial related infections.48−52 The conceptual diagram on the emerging pathogens (bacteria, virus, and fungi) and surfaces which are prone to microbial contamination such as those in hospitals and their relative mechanisms are presented in a,b. The antimicrobial coating on various substrates depicting the microbe–substrate interactions is shown in c.\n\nSynthetic Antimicrobial Polymers\n\nAs the demand for antimicrobial materials with superior disinfection properties is on the rise, the development of novel and human-friendly microbe-resistant polymer or polymer nanocomposites materials to fight against the microbial contaminations are of contemporary interest. While biomaterials are being employed for various applications, one of the adverse effects reported is the origination of bacterial adhesion with further biofilm formation on the biomaterial surfaces that can cause severe infections. Globally, the estimated biomaterial-related infections are mainly (64%) in the form of hospital-acquired infections compared to other types of infections.49 To control this, there are two types of defense mechanisms created through antimicrobial coatings. In general, the antibiofilm mechanism which accounts for the surface protection is created based on antifouling or antimicrobial coatings. Antimicrobial polymers offer promising and enhanced efficacy among the available antimicrobial agents with the potential to minimize the healthcare and environmental related problems.53−59\n\nAntifouling coatings prevent biofilm accumulation occurrence on surfaces through repelling or controlling the microbial biofilm architecture of surfaces.55 In contrast, antimicrobial coatings work solely based on bacteriostatic or bactericidal activity.55 The former is based on the mechanism of steric repulsion or nanoscale-based topographies, and the latter follows the mechanism of contact killing or by releasing the antimicrobial compounds or inorganic metal ions that causes cell death. On the basis of the antimicrobial activity and its related mechanism, the polymers are categorized as passive (repelling) or active (killing) materials.56 The “repelling”-based mechanism is mainly from hydrophilic/hydrophobic and electrostatic repulsions and the low surface energy of the matrix. The “killing”-based mechanism is based on electrostatic and biocidal interactions. The logic of choosing materials to design antimicrobial surfaces and their engineering perspectives are thoroughly discussed in the latest review.60 Discussions are made based on the past applications which made potential impacts on the antimicrobial surfaces for various applications.\n\nGreater attention has been paid to the biocidal polymers because of their inherent properties such as nonvolatility, chemical stability, environmental friendliness, and durability, which make them advantageous over other polymers as antimicrobial materials.55 The biocidal polymers are mostly polycationic thereby binding to the protein’s membrane of the microbial cells effectively. Many cationic polymers have emerged as successful candidates in the recent past as antimicrobial substances. The majority are nonbiobiodegradable, thereby studies into their potential side effects to humans are necessary for ensuring the medical safety.61 Biocidal polymers which are surface-active are generally described as surface-bound polymers, and the polymer which releases the biocidal substances in solution are called solution-bound polymer.56\n\nThe characteristics of antimicrobial polymers, methods for their synthesis, factors which affect their antimicrobial activities, and their major fields of application are extensively covered in the literature.4,62 The toxicity of the conventional antimicrobial agents can be minimized by accompanying them with green antimicrobial polymers with the help of reducing agents thereby increasing their antimicrobial efficiency and selectivity.62 Few polymers such as chitosan, quaternary-nitrogen-group-containing compounds, poly-ε-lysine (ε-PL), halamines, triclosan, and polybiguanides show an inherent capacity to display antimicrobial activity.53,63−65 Additionally, they act as a backbone to incorporate small biocides and antibiotics.53,66 Polyacrylate-based antimicrobial polymers, namely, polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS) and 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate/acrylic acid, and an amphiphilic polymer, poly[(aminoethyl methacrylate)-co-(butyl methacrylate)] (PAMBM), have already been evaluated for medical coatings.67,68 The functional characteristics of quaternary ammonium salt siloxane copolymers and N-halamine siloxane have been studied for their use in biocidal coatings. The copolymer coating consisting of quaternary ammonium salt siloxane and N-halamine on cotton swatches exhibits biocidal efficacy against microbial colonies such as Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli).69 Also, N-halamine-incorporated nonwoven fabrics have been used as antimicrobial materials against avian influenza virus and airborne bacteria,70,71 and their action on the inactivation of the contaminated aerosol is shown in a. These N-halamine materials possess superior antimicrobial properties against the wide spectrum of microorganisms such as yeasts, fungi, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and viruses.71 They have received significant attention during the past decade as antimicrobial materials due to their efficacy.65,72 The contact and release killing mechanisms of N-halamine-incorporated electrospun PMMA fibers loaded with 1,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin (DCDMH) and 1,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin (DBDMH), have been established based on the studies conducted against the bacteria’s E. coli and S. aureus.(66) Their action against the bacterial strains and the mechanisms involved in fighting against the harmful bacteria are shown in b. Enzyme-embedded antimicrobial substances based on polycaprolactone (PCL) polymers with antibiotic gentamicin sulfate (GS) coimpregnation coatings have exhibited very good antibacterial properties. The test was conducted on three test isolates: E. coli, S. aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). On the basis of the in vitro release studies, it was concluded that the PCL-GS polymeric materials can be effectively tunable as self-degrading antimicrobial biomaterial coating on catheters.73\n\nSuccessful immobilization of Cys-linked SHAP1 peptide-based polymers (antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)) on the surfaces of a vinyl-functionalized glass slide and nonconventional latex gloves have been performed with the help of iCVD technology. A flow cytometry method was used to determine the antimicrobial efficacy of the coating developed. The immobilized antimicrobial peptides showed high antimicrobial activity, >96% against two typical pathogenic bacteria. The overall scheme for polymer coating and AMP immobilization on the surface of the substrate and the antimicrobial mechanism is described as shown in c. On the basis of the various antimicrobial studies, it was concluded that the coating technique employed can be effectively developed further for various types of equipment and medical devices.48 Polydopamine-based antimicrobial coatings have also gained significant attention in the past decade due to their flexibility for functionalizing all types of materials and universal biocompatibility;74−78 however, the drawback is their instability in an alkaline environment.79 Hence, with the right combination of functionalization or cross-linking with different materials, it is possible to attain the stability over the polydopamine coatings for various microbial environments.75,80\n\nConducting polymers such as polyaniline and polypyrrole have already proven their microbial resistance properties in many fields such as antifouling or antimicrobial coatings,81−86 biomedical,79,87−95 and food packaging.96−101 Due to their superior properties against controlling the microbial colonization of various surfaces and the development of resistant microbe strains, they have been recently explored for disinfectant applications as well.94 These polymers possess unique properties such as ease of synthesis on a large scale, excellent environmental stability, a tunable backbone (−NH2) for tailoring as antibacterial materials, flexibility for functionalization, and doping.102\n\nReady to eat food packaging is contaminated with numerous viruses due to lack of proper antiviral packaging material. The viral pathogens transmitted from contaminated food packaging surfaces causes viral foodborne outbreaks.103 There are a few commercial polymers already in use for the food packaging applications Novaron, Zeomic, AgIon, and Cleanaid.104 Only limited information is available on the application of antimicrobial materials in the control of human enteric viruses as far as active packaging and food-contact surfaces with virucidal activity are concerned. For designing materials with antiviral properties, several factors need to be considered. Foremost is the intended application where the material is going to be used, as synthetic and biobased plastics like polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) or polypropylene (PP) would be used in the case of the food-contact surface or food-packaging material applications. Furthermore, biopolymers such as proteins (zein and soy protein), lipids (beeswax), and polysaccharides (chitosan, starch, cellulose) are chosen for the coating of edible food products as they satisfy the safety criteria of having “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS) status.103 The challenges posed on testing the materials for antiviral properties due to the higher rate of infection and transmission limits studies on the evaluation of antiviral materials. Hence the materials that have passed the antibacterial tests are considered for antiviral applications as well as with the further important testing measures. In general, the antiviral polymers are defined by comparing the virucidal activities of materials with and without viral loads for the intended applications with specific experimental conditions such as contact time and temperature. A promising strategy toward broad-spectrum antivirals is mainly to block or suppress the first step in the viral life cycle which is the entry of the virus and its traveling to the target cell.105 Many synthetic polymers have been tested as antiviral drugs against viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), influenza, herpes simplex viruses (HSV) types 1 and 2, varicella-zoster, papilloma, hepatitis B and C, and respiratory syncytial viruses, and the challenges have also been documented. Hence, with the limited trials and testing, it is always challenging to come out with functionally enhanced antiviral coatings for surface treatment with different emerging and re-emerging viruses contaminations.105,106 Antimicrobial polymers with nanosized materials have been employed as antiviral coatings or sprays for controlling viral load on contaminated surfaces.107\n\nPyridinium-type polyvinylpyrrolidones with different counteranions were developed, and their antiviral activity was tested against influenza virus through a plaque assay technique. Studies reported that the polycations showed antiviral activity of 95.6% of virucidal efficiency. Antibacterial efficiency of the same material was tested against E. coli bacterial activity. It was concluded that the pyridinium-type polyvinylpyrrolidones play a dual role as both antibacterial and antiviral activities against a broad-spectrum of pathogens.108\n\nA novel continuously active antimicrobial coating exhibited the ability to reduce the hospital-aquired infections (HAIs) in hospitals. The modified coating demonstrated greater residual efficacy against viruses. On the basis of the evaluation of the antimicrobial polymer coatings, it was found that the coated surfaces effectively acted against human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E. The virus concentration was reduced by greater than 90% in 10 min, and after 2 h of contact, it was reduced by greater than 99.9%. The same coating formulation in suspension showed an effectiveness greater than 99.99% against HCoV 229E in 10 min of contact. The outcome of this study yields an opportunity toward controlling the COVID-19 transmission from contaminated fomites.109 However, more studies are needed to further evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed antiviral coating.\n\nHAIs pose a greater threat and potential risk to patients, and one of the methods to reduce this risk is to use antimicrobial coatings or spray which can decontaminate the surfaces contaminated with pathogens, mainly bacteria/viruses.110−114 In some cases, even after proper care is taken, recontamination is unavoidable due to the persistence of the pathogens.115 Antimicrobial coating or spray can be of immediate relief against pathogens spread mainly from the HAIs. One such antimicrobial spray used a quaternary-ammonium-based polymer, which acts as a barrier for bacterial survival on surfaces for up to 15 weeks through surface bonding.116 The bed frames, medical equipment, mattresses, walls, furniture, ceilings, doors, windows, curtains, and hallways can be cleaned using the same polymer coatings once the hospital room is cleaned.112 It was discussed that the active ingredient present in the antimicrobial polymer reduces both bacteria and fungus or the microbial burdens. Although it does not kill spores, its influence on both surface charge and hydrophobicity enhances adhesion to surfaces which limits the spores being aerosolized or transferred to other surfaces.112,117\n\nAntimicrobial Polymeric Coatings on Fabrics\n\nRecently, cotton fabrics have been coated with different types of polymers or polymeric nanocomposites materials to achieve a permanent antimicrobial characteristic without compromising their physicochemical and mechanical properties.85,118−125 Here, we present one of the examples from ref (85). The antibacterial and polymeric monomers from alkyl-dimethyl tertiary amines based monomers (ADTA-X) were prepared via a quaternization reaction by reacting them with 3-chloropropene. The antibacterial polymeric emulsions concerning different alkyl chain lengths were prepared through a seed emulsion polymerization route, and the as-prepared emulsions were spray-coated on the thoroughly cleaned cotton fabric, as shown in a. Different characterizations were employed to understand the antibacterial and antiadhesion properties against two different bacteria, namely, S. aureus and E. coli. The durability of cotton fabric with antibacterial polymeric coatings was also presented. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies of polymer-coated fabric confirm the reduction of bacterial adhesion compared to that of pristine fabric. It was stated that the polymers with the fluorine component helped the coated fabrics to attain greater antibacterial activity. Bacterial adhesion on a surface is generally very difficult to assess as it is a complex process which is governed by many factors such as (a) bacterial cell surface properties, (b) the aqueous or liquid environment, and (c) material surface properties. On the basis of that fact, the role of the fluorine component on increasing the rate of bacterial antiadhesion on the fabrics was tested using a water contact angle (WCA) test. The results show the trend of the increased rate of bacterial antiadhesion of the antibacterial fabric with increased hydrophobicity. Also, less adherence of bacteria was noticed on the coated fabrics. Hence, it confirms the role of the fluorine component in increasing the hydrophobicity of the antibacterial polymers, as shown in b. The mechanism behind the antiadhesion properties of the fluorine-incorporated or grafted polymer was discussed. The hydrophobic segments of the fluorine component facilitated the in-depth penetration of the hydrophobic segments present in the polymer chain into the lipid domains of the membrane which lead to the membranolysis and cell death. Thus, bacterial colonization was prevented, resulting in enhanced antibacterial capability. The dose of the fluorine component determines the rate of hydrophobicity of the antibacterial polymers. The schematics representation of antiadhesion properties of the pristine and antibacterial-coated cotton fabric is shown in c.\n\nAlthough few studies reported that hydrophilic surfaces prevented the bacterial adhesion compared to hydrophobic surfaces,126,127 most authors advocated for the hydrophobic surfaces for antiadhesion of bacteria, especially with regard to in vitro environments.128 As it has been proven that antibacterial fabrics help in inhibiting or destroy the bacteria and microbe’s growth, deeper attention needs to be paid for developing antimicrobial fabrics, thereby reducing transmission of infectious diseases in hospital-related environments. As 3D printing technologies are gaining significant attention in the biomedical forum,129 it would be interesting to adopt 3D printing technology in designing mask, personal protective equipment, and gloves. The polymer-nanocomposites-based membranes, based on a bioinspired design, can be printed as filter material to control the microbial burdens infusion. The design concept for preparing a protective mask with a 3D-printed bioinspired polymeric filter for controlling the microbial burden is illustrated in d.\n\nSuperhydrophobic Coatings\n\nThe interest in superhydrophobic coatings expressing antimicrobial activity has gained momentum in the recent past. The term superhydrophobicity is coined based on the lessons taught by nature, i.e., the “lotus leaf” effect, which attracts a plethora of unique opportunities and functional applications in the field of microbial-repellent coatings, specifically in the medical field. This superhydrophobicity concept depicts the self-cleaning of surfaces and repelling of any microbial adhesion, thereby preventing surface contamination. So, the creation of superhydrophobic surfaces impacts its widespread use as easy-to-clean surfaces with the autocleaning effect. Fine-tuning the surfaces plays a major role in providing advantageous functions to this surface. There are two features of the surface as measured by the contact angle (θ), such as hydrophobic and hydrophilic characteristics, which define the surface properties. According to Young’s equation, in general, the ideal wetting property of a smooth surface is defined based on the contact angle: If the contact angle is 0°, then the wetting of the surface is complete, whereas a contact angle of 180° indicates the nonwettability of the surface as the droplets stand on the surface itself. Similarly, the surface is hydrophilic if the contact angle is less than 90°, and it is hydrophobic if the contact angle is greater than 90°. The surface with a contact angle higher than 150° termed as superhydrophobic surface. The major factors which influence the surface wetting properties are its roughness and chemical composition. To mimic the lotus leaf surface with hierarchical micro-/nanostructures plus a waxy hydrophilic film, it is necessary to fine-tune the surface contact angle to higher than 119°, where higher surface roughness plays a major role. The mimicked heterogeneous wetting (Cassie–Baxter model) property of the surface helps in the reduction of adhesion force between the water droplet and surface. Thereby, dirt or any microbial adhesion on the surface is completely cleaned and taken away by rolling off of water droplets with a slight tilt of the surface. This was the motivation behind the development of bioinspired superhydrophobic materials for antimicrobial coating.55 The successful repulsion and removal of microbial colonies, such as E. coli, Streptococcus mutans, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus or any Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria, from different superhydrophobic surfaces have been carried out,130−138 which shows the importance of superhydrophobic surfaces or coatings for antimicrobial repellence.\n\nSmart Antifilms\n\nRecently, a new generation of antibacterial strategies is developed to overcome the shortcomings of conventional antimicrobial methods.49,139,140 They are originally conceptualized as surfaces with smart antibacterial and antibiofilm characteristics as they release drugs on-demand with respect to environmental signaling or triggering by external stimuli, thereby preventing biofilm formation or total damage of the matured film, respectively. The external stimuli mentioned here for creating smart surfaces are mainly electricity, temperature, light, magnetism, and induced redox changes. Hence, the antifilm is a growth-restricted biofilm (or) otherwise dissolved completely into the solution as biofilm formation is terminated.49\n\nAlthough many polymers are used for synthesizing and creating antimicrobial coatings for various applications, ensuring biodegradability and biocompatibility are the major criteria, particularly when used for biomedical applications. Furthermore, the innate cytotoxicity of synthetic polymers is a major drawback for their application in medical devices, despite their proven efficiency against microorganisms.48 Hence, the need of the hour, antimicrobial application, relies totally on the development of biopolymers and biodegradable polymers. Detailed discussions on the progress of biopolymers and biodegradable polymers in antimicrobial applications are given in the following section.\n\nAntimicrobial Biopolymers\n\nWith advancements in technologies, plastic-based products are becoming a prime source of pollution. The rising demand and consumption of conventional plastics have created great concern for humans, animals, and the environment. These are prime sources of environmental pollution. The global primary plastic production reached 407 million tonnes in 2015, with a waste generation of 302 million tonnes. Plastic waste handling involves three primary techniques, namely, landfills, incineration, and recycling. However, the recycling, incineration, and discard percentages were low, i.e., 20, 25, and 55%, respectively, in 2015. Thus, plastic waste recycling requires serious attention toward a sustainable future.53,141,142\n\nThus, there is an urgent need to look for biodegradable and renewable sources of polymers.143 One of the main biodegradable polymers is cellulose, having the inherent advantages of hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low cost. Their biomedical applications arise from an important feature of hydrophilicity, owing to the hydroxyl, aldehyde, and carboxyl groups, and making a facile preparation of hydrogels.144,145 Cellulose also offers a sustainable means for superhydrophobic coatings having several functionalities. The overall advantages are the excellent durability, simplicity, environmentally friendly, and ease of scale-up.146,147\n\nWhy are Natural Products Needed?\n\nAlthough various synthetic materials have been developed for microbe-repellent surfaces, natural and renewable-source-based antimicrobial surfaces are urgently needed for controlled microbial growth and reduced activity. Recently, the focus has shifted from synthetic polymers to biodegradable polymer surfaces because of degradation in the presence of moisture and temperature without emission of any toxic byproducts. The key challenges are good mechanical strength, chemically inert, environmentally friendly, biocompatible, thermally stable, low cost, and abundantly available.148 The potential candidates are polysaccharides, e.g., starch, cellulose, agar, and chitosan, and proteins, e.g., casein.149−151 The following section will critically review the newly developed natural microbial repellent surfaces.\n\nNatural-Product-Based Antimicrobial Materials\n\nDifferent biobased antimicrobial surfaces can be broadly divided into two main categories, viz., polysaccharides and proteins.152 The next subsections will cover the mechanistic details of their antimicrobial performance.\n\nChitosan\n\nChitosan, a biopolymer discovered by Henri Braconnot in 1811 upon deacetylation of chitin, a natural and most abundantly available polysaccharide after cellulose. Later, Charles Rouget extensively worked on chitosan until 1859, and the name was coined by Felix Hoppe-Seyler in 1894. Chitin and chitosan are found in fungi cell walls, insects, mushrooms, and the exoskeleton of crustaceans. The research on different applications of chitosan started in late 1970, and later was applied in the pharmaceuticals area in the early 1990s, followed by extensive research in the therapeutic system. Chitosan finds applications in various fields such as agriculture, textiles, pharmacy, food industry, and cosmetology.153,154 A linear and semicrystalline polysaccharide is formed through β-(1 → 4) glycosidic bonding between glucosamine and the N-acetyl glucosamine units in chitosan.155 Chemically, chitin and chitosan have different fractions of monomeric units. In chitin, the N-acetyl glucosamine groups are >50%, and the degree of acetylation (DA) refers to the number of acetamido groups. Chitosan has >50% glucosamine units, and the degree of deacetylation (DDA) is the number of glucosamine units. The DA and DDA are related as DA = 1 – DDA.156,157 a shows the chemical structure of chitin and chitosan.\n\nProperties of Chitosan\n\nThe following properties of the chitosan makes it a versatile source for various applications.153,158,159\n\nSolubility at Different pHs\n\nChitosan belongs to the family of amino polysaccharides. Its solubility is mainly controlled by the presence of amino groups ( b). At low pH, the protonation of amino groups makes the overall structure as a polycationic species. Below pH 6.0, chitosan acts as a strong base with a pKa = 6.3. The active amino groups with cationic character help in attaching new groups under mild reaction conditions and also make it water-soluble. At higher pH (>6), its cationic character is transformed to anionic via deprotonation of amino groups, and chitosan becomes insoluble. Thus, the pKa value of chitosan is used to tune its solubility and hence the degree of N-acetylation. The other advantages of chitosan are improved paste fluidity, anticoagulant behavior, and a high water-reducing ratio.\n\nDifferent Molecular Weights (Mw)\n\nThe molecular weight (Mw) can be easily tuned with the degree of acetylation. For example, a change in the degree of acetylation from 30 to 95% causes variation in Mw from 300 to over 1000 kDa, respectively.\n\nHydrogen Bonding\n\nThe different functional groups in the polymeric chain help in forming intermolecular hydrogen bonds. This particularly helps in providing hydrophilicity to the chitosan molecules and making them vulnerable to hydrolyzation and hence degradation. This also tailors the swelling property via absorbing water and makes them act as plasticizers.160\n\nBiological Properties\n\nThe antimicrobial activity, bioadhesivity, biodegradability, adsorbable capability, bioactivity, hypolipidemic activity, and nontoxic nature makes chitosan interesting.161−166 Among these different properties, the aspects of the antimicrobial activity of chitosan are discussed in detail, owing to the focus of the present review.\n\nAntimicrobial Activity\n\nAlthough the exact mechanism is not known, there are various proposed mechanisms in the literature. The polycationic character of chitosan present in fungi, viruses, and bacteria (Gram-positive and Gram-negative) is responsible for their intrinsic antimicrobial activity. In general, when polycationic chitosan electrostatically interacts with anionic cell wall components such as lipopolysaccharides and proteins of the microbial surface, the changes in the permeability barrier results into the leakage of intracellular components such as lactate dehydrogenase, nucleic acid, and glucose followed by the gradual shrinkage of the cell membrane. Furthermore, it prevents the uptake of nutrients inside the cell, attaches to DNA, and inhibits the synthesis of RNA and protein, which results in microorganism death.159,163,167−170\n\nResearchers have used chitosan in different ways for antimicrobial activity. An important point worth mentioning is that the antimicrobial activity is feasible only in an acidic medium. At higher pH (>6.5), chitosan is usually insoluble. Thus, chitosan derivatives having solubility in the both acidic and basic medium are good candidates for antimicrobial activities. The ideal antimicrobial surface prevents adhesion and growth and has the potential to kill the microbes as well.171\n\nThe following section briefly outlines various chitosan-based antimicrobial applications. Although chitosan is mainly used in antimicrobial activity, the other applications of modified chitosan are bone regeneration, drug delivery, gene carrier, hemocompatibility, nanocarrier, and endothelial progenitor cell platform.172 Researchers have used different ways to use chitosan for antimicrobial activity. Table 1 summarizes the antimicrobial properties of different chitosan-based surfaces.\n\nTable 1\n\nmaterialbest nanomaterialscontrol surfacevariantbmethod (s)contact angle (deg)rms roughness (nm)best suited for microorganismantimicrobial activity/percentage/inhibition zone (mm)refCS/guar gum/Roselle calyx extractzinc oxideNANANAbacterial and fungal speciesNA(173)CSPVA* or HEC* or HPMC or MCNANANAS. mutansNA(174)PVA/GA/CSBPEO* or GEONANANAB. cereus, S. aureus, E. coli, S. typhimuriumNA(183)CS/PPEMOENANANAB. cereusNA(186)wool/CSAg* or Cu or ZnNANANAS. aureus, E. coli∼100%(204)BCChI or ChMNANANAS. aureus > P. aeruginosa > C. albicans(188)CS/PVALAENANANAC. jejuni2 (LRV)(189)Nylon-6 coreCS shellNANANAS. aureus, P. aeruginosaNA(190)CSCA or PCNANANAP. aeruginosa, S. aureusNA(171)corn starch/CSturmericNANANAS. aureusNA(195)PVAchitosan/PHMG*Kirby–Bauer (disk diffusion) method, and dilution and pour plate culture methodγs (mJ m–2): PVA = 39.10 ± 1.12, PVA/CS = 37.07 ± 0.32, PVA/PHMG = 41.05 ± 0.3510.6 ± 2.4S. aureus, E. coli≥5.6 (S. aureus), ≥6.0 (E. coli)(180)ammonium chitosans (CS612)/sodium alginate (SA)multilayer structure (5.5 bilayers)colony forming unit (CFU) determination and MTT assaypristine PMMA: 100.56 ± 3.37257C. albicans99.82 ± 0.17%(193)5.5 bilayers: ∼65CS (core)OEO (shell)NANANAA. alternata0.005% (MIC)(198)CS/PCLOEOcolony counting method112.07 ± 2.112.89 ± 4.67 nmS. aureus, L. monocytogenes, S. enteritidis, E. coli52.72 ± 1.01% (S. aureus), 41.06 ± 3.12% (L. monocytogenes), 49.37 ± 1.78% (S. enteritidis), 40.47 ± 3.36% (E. coli)(201)CS–gelatinessential oils (cinnamon, pink clove, nutmeg, citronella, and thyme)disk diffusion assayNANAC. jejuni, E. coli, L. monocytogenes, S. typhimurium11.33 ± 0.94 mm(182)CScapsaicin blendsdisc diffusion test91.02° ± 1.84NAE. aerogenes15.44 ± 0.31 nm(202)CSvanillindisc diffusion testNA8.58E. coli, S. aureuslog CFU = 4 mL–1(203)\n\nEl-Sayed et al. prepared chitosan/guar gum/Roselle calyx extract/zinc oxide (CS/GG/RE-ZnO) bio-nanocomposites and studied the antimicrobial activity on Ras cheese substrate for food packaging applications. Different Re-ZnO contents of 1, 3, and 5 wt % was added to CS/CG blends. The results showed that 3 wt % Re-ZnO exhibited the best performance against bacterial and fungal species especially E. coli, Listeria monoytogenes, and Aspergillus terries, which was attributed to the combined antibacterial properties of RE and ZnO extract. Also, Re-ZnO helps in forming a barrier against water vapor permeability.173 Abouhussein et al. explored different cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC)-chitosan-based blends comprising of methylcellulose (MC), hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) or poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) for the treatment of buccal mucosa for oral-based diseases.174 Similar to that of chitosan, cetylpyridinium chloride drug is also cationic and has antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, e.g., S. mutans, at lower concentrations and against Gram-negative bacteria at higher concentration.175 Here, the polycationic nature of chitosan results in strong electrostatic interaction and attaches to the negatively charged mucosal surface and is responsible for mucoadhesion. The −OH and −NH2 groups of chitosan promote hydrogen bonding.176,177 The results showed that the blends with PVA and HEC have more adhesion than that of the other blends due to more extensive hydrogen bonding.\n\nIn chitosan-based composites, usually an environmentally friendly polymer such as PVA is also used as an additive to improve the interfacial strength and mechanical properties including tensile strength, elongation, and flexibility.49,178,179 The most important properties of PVA is hydrophilicity due to the enormous hydroxyl groups in the main chain along with biocompatibility, biodegradability, good chemical resistance, high crystallinity, and film-forming properties makes it a suitable candidate to use as an additive for biological applications.180,181\n\nEssential oils are a complex mixture of low molecular weight compounds extracted from nature and plants and are generally used as food additives because of their advantage of inherent antimicrobial activity. This property is due to the different functional groups such as mono- and sesquiterpenes and phenolic compounds which interact with bacterial membrane components such as polysaccharides, fatty acids, and phospholipids. Various researchers have used essential oil derivatives for antimicrobial applications.182\n\nThe antimicrobial activity of PVA, gum arabic (GA), and CS-based biocomposites with the addition of black pepper essential oil (BPEO) or ginger essential oil (GEO) was tested on four different bacterial species (E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus cereus, S. aureus) by Amalraj et al.183 Although the PVA/GA/CS composite film exhibits good intermolecular interaction, the purpose of the essential oils is to tailor the surface properties, along with increased flexibility which is due to the interruption of the polymeric network in the film. However, the drawback is the reduced tensile strength.184,185 The PVA/GA/CS composite film is a compatible system with a compact and smooth microstructure along with few cavities on the surface. The addition of BPEO to PVA/GA/CS increased the roughness and the number of cavities with BPEO trapped inside them. The advantage is that the hydrophobicity of BPEO did not induce cracks in the system and make the overall microstructure more compatible. However, GEO leads to a rougher, coarser, and irregular surface, which is attributed to the migration of oil toward the film surface followed by its volatilization and evaporation of water. Furthermore, the BPEO-PVA/GA/CS composites exhibited excellent inhibition zones (16.82 ± 1.27–20.43 ± 2.04 mm) compared to those of GEO-PVA/GA/CS (14.59 ± 1.14–17.83 ± 1.77 mm) and PVA/GA/CS (4.14 ± 1.20–6.32 ± 1.23 mm). This is due to the continuous availability of the essential oils via sustained release on the surface and attack of the cytoplasmic membrane.\n\nIn another study, Olewnik-Kruszkowska varied the poly(hexamethylene guanidine) (PHMG) content in PVA–chitosan and PVA polymeric films.180 The surface energies of the film decreased with the addition of chitosan in PVA. While PVA has a surface energy of 39.10 ± 1.12 mJ m–2, it decreased to 37.07 ± 0.32 mJ m–2 with the presence of chitosan which is due to the diversion of the polar groups of the chain inside of the film. However, the PHMG attachment further increases the surface energy to 41.05 ± 0.35 and 38.90 ± 0.21 mJ m–2 for PVA–PHMG-1 wt % and PVA–chitosan–PHMG-1 wt %, respectively, suggesting that PHMG adds hydrophilicity in the modified composites. The antimicrobial properties were tested by two methods, viz., the Kirby–Bauer (disk diffusion) method and the dilution and pour plate culture method. PVA–PHMG exhibited the best antimicrobial activity, while PVA–chitosan–PHMG showed lower activity, due to the formation of a dense network between PVA and chitosan which blocks PHMG movement toward the outer layers. Thus, the antimicrobial activity was optimal for PVA–PHMG (S. aureus ≥ 5.6; E. coli ≥ 6.0) and reduced in the case of PVA–chitosan–PHMG (S. aureus ≥ 2.0; E. coli ≥ 1.6).\n\nPirsa et al. prepared an antibacterial/biodegradable film consisting of CS/pomegranate peel extract (PPE) and Melissa officinalis essential oil (MOE) and studied the detection of cream cheese spoilage.186 Both MOE and PPE exhibit antimicrobial activities. The antioxidant and antimicrobial activity in PPE is due to the presence of flavonoids, azelaic acid, anthocyanidins, flavonones, anthocyanins, and aesthetic flavones. The surface properties were studied using the response surface method (RSM). The moisture content decreases with PPE addition, due to the hydrophobic nature of the PPE and bond formation with the chitosan hydroxyl groups thereby limiting water availability. In contrast, the 0.3–0.5% w/v content of MOE caused an increase in moisture content due to the increase in oil content in the composite. The thickness increases with the amount of uniform and homogeneous distribution of MOE and PPE at higher contents. The water vapor permeability increases with MOE content due to the formation of a porous network with cavities on the film. Also, the pure chitosan films are homogeneous and intact, while the PPE0.03%/MOE0.5% film has irregularities associated with cavities created by MOE and surface compression reduced by the essential oil. Furthermore, the antimicrobial study was carried out on three different composites, namely, pure CS film, CS/PPE0.03%/MOE0.0%, and CS/PPE0.03%/MOE0.5% on E. coli and B. cereus. The higher antimicrobial activity of CS/PPE0.03%/MOE0.5% is due to the presence of a large number of phenolic groups, viz., monoterpenes, glycosides, and flavonoids, and was more active for B. cereus than E. coli.\n\nSadeghi-Kiakhani loaded chitosan derivatives of Ag, Zn, and Cu NPs on wool yarn and studied the antimicrobial performance on S. aureus and E. coli. The antimicrobial activity arises from the electrostatic interaction between the positively and negatively charged amino groups and cell membranes, respectively, so the as-synthesized composites restrict the nutrient uptake and growth of the cells. The combined effect of metal NPs and chitosan induces the antimicrobial activity.187 It was found that chitosan-Ag exhibited best antimicrobial performance of ∼100% for E. coli and S. aureus, respectively, and retained ∼95.60 and 92.57% performance after 10 washing cycles.\n\nCabañas-Romero et al. have compared the microbial activities of two different chitosan-based nanocomposites, namely, BC–ChI (bacterial cellulose (BC) paper sheets immersed in chitosan solution) and BC–ChM (BC pulp and chitosan were mixed followed by paper sheets production).188 BC is an interweaved nanofiber network and randomly distributed. Chitosan was a uniformly distributed, homogeneous surface that had improved bonding between chitosan and BC and smaller pores in BC–ChI than that of BC–ChM. The antimicrobial activity of BC–Ch was tested on the bacteria S. aureus and P. aeruginosa and the yeast Candida albicans. Chitosan’s sensitivity against different microbes follows the order: S. aureus > P. aeruginosa > C. albicans. Furthermore, BC–ChM has a greater inhibitory rate (83, 75 and 38% for S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans) and better prevented microbial growth compared to BC–ChI (65, 55, and 88% for S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans) because of the less compact surface of BC–ChM and its greater contact surface area. However, the antimicrobial effectiveness is similar for both types of composites and helps in inhibiting the microbial growth and biocidal activity.\n\nPulvirenti and co-workers studied the role of ethyl lauroyl arginate (LAE) (1–10% w/v) in CS-PVA blend films on microbial inhibition on the four major food bacterial pathogens including E. coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and S. typhimurium.(189) The AFM showed that LAE addition adversely affected the film roughness. Starting with a pure CS and PVA blend, the film is relatively homogeneous without the presence of pores or cavities. The film roughness abruptly increased in 5 and 10% LAE, showing the strong interaction between LAE and CS-PVA blends. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity was analyzed by disk diffusion assay. The LAE is usually more effective against C. jejuni, resulting in the halo size becoming 3- to 5-fold wider. However, the results of 5 and 10% LAE were similar for all the bacteria. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity was also evaluated in a liquid medium which increases with the increase in LAE content, and the maximum reduction value of 2 was obtained at 10% LAE-CS-PVA for C. jejuni.\n\nHaghighi et al. comprehensively studied and compared the antimicrobial performance of five different essential oils including cinnamon, pink clove, nutmeg, citronella, and thyme essential oils in chitosan–gelatin blend films.182 Gelatin is a hydrophilic protein with good compatibility and affinity for chitosan to form a blend. Furthermore, the oil droplets remain embedded on the surface of the films on drying. However, cinnamon and nutmeg films show pores on their surfaces which is associated with the fast drying of oils due to their high volatility. The control chitosan–gelatin film did not show any antimicrobial activity. This is due to the unavailability of chitosan caused by the lack of diffusion, while gelatin did now show this behavior. However, different essential oils show antimicrobial behavior. It can be seen that thyme essential oil is most effective for the antimicrobial performance of 31.67 ± 1.71%, which is due to it having the highest water solubility, compared to that of 23.61 ± 0.58% for the control chitosan–gelatin surface and the range of 20.36 ± 1.09% to 30.24 ± 0.75% for nutmeg and cinnamon based blends, respectively.\n\nKeirouz et al. used Nylon-6/chitosan core/shell electrospun nanostructures for antimicrobial surfaces.190 The advantage of using these core/shell nanofillers is the dual antimicrobial action governed by the polyamide-6/poly(hexamethylene biguanide) hydrochloride (PHMB) and 5-chloro-8-quinolinol (5CLO8Q) release from the Nylon-6 and chitosan shell, respectively. It was found that the core/shell type of morphology is most effective in decimating the growth of live bacteria.\n\nMartins et al. fabricated layer-by-layer films using iota-carrageenan (CA) or pectin (PC) on chitosan, termed as polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs), to test the bactericidal activities against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus.171 The number of layers with chitosan-terminated ends were between 5 and 15. The WCA of CA-chitosan was 25 ± 0.2° which was low compared to that of PC-chitosan having a value of 51 ± 0.2°. Thus, CA enhanced the wettability of the overall film. The improved wettability is also desired to develop antiadhesive surfaces for the microbes.191 Both the surfaces showed bactericidal effects against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus at low pH (5.0).\n\nLópez et al. prepared a chitosan and hyaluronic acid (HA) based thin polymer multilayer film on titanium substrates to release a β-amino acid based peptidomimetic of antimicrobial peptide.192 The antimicrobial testing was carried out against S. aureus in 96-well plates given by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. It was found that the release of β-peptide continued for 28 days, while the film selectively inhibited the formation of S. aureusin vitro for nearly 24 days and retained the viability of MC3T3-E1 osteogenic mammalian cells. In a similar multilayered type coating, Jung et al. selected ammonium chitosans (CS612) as the positive and outermost layer and sodium alginate (SA) as the negative layer to use for a C. albicans fungal-repellent surface on a PMMA disc.193 The advantage of using CS612 is its long alkyl chain thereby making it highly durable. However, the SA layer helped to reduce the contact angle to ∼60° (5.5 bilayers) as compared to 100.56 ± 3.37° (pristine PMMA). The roughness of 5.5 bilayers (257 nm) was lower than that of pristine PMMA disc (336 nm). While PMMA did not show antifungal properties, the multilayered CS612/SA killed 99.82 ± 0.17% of Candida in 4 h. However, if SA was replaced as the top layer, then the antifungal property is also observed but not as efficient as that of CS612. Furthermore, in vitro cytotoxicity test (ISO 10993–5 and 10993–12) showed that cell viability is not affected by varying temperatures. The MTT assay (direct contact method) indicated that pure PMMA has a low cell survival level, while CS612 on the top layer is most suited for a good cell proliferation rate as compared to SA on the top layer. This shows that positively charged CS612 has more cell adhesion tendency and lead to improved performance.194\n\nSchaefer et al. used turmeric as an additive in cornstarch and chitosan based blends.195 The curcumin found in the turmeric has a good wound healing property and excellent antimicrobial activity against bacteria.196,197 However, it was observed that all chitosan-containing formulations such as chitosan, chitosan–starch, chitosan–turmeric, and chitosan–starch–turmeric show antimicrobial activity against S. aureus. Some authors also found that very low content of turmeric is not effective for antimicrobial activity because of its hydrophobic nature and is much less stable in an aqueous environment. However, the higher turmeric content can be further studied to investigate the behavior. Thus, the main ingredient was chitosan for antimicrobial activity. Cao et al. prepared easily penetrable CS encapsulated with poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (CS-PMPC) nanocapsules for antimicrobials. Two different molar ratios of N-(3-aminopropyl) methacrylamid (APM)/MPC of 4:1 and 1:1 were also compared, named as P(MPC1-co-APM4)-CS and P(MPC1-co-APM1)-CS, respectively. The reason for replacing a few contents of PMC with APM was to improve the electrostatic attraction by increasing the positive charges on the surface.\n\nYilmaz et al. used the electrospraying method to design chitosan NPs (CNPs) loaded with Origanum vulgare L. essential oil (OEO) as shown in .198 The OEO/CH proportions were 0:1 (S0), 0.0625:1 (S1), 0.125:1 (S2), 0.25:1 (S3), and 0.5:1 (S4) mL/g and the average size of the NPs was between 290 and 483 nm. The increase in OEO concentration adds more positive charges on the surface of the NPs as evident from zeta potential values which increase from +25.2 ± 3.13 (So) to +47.7 ± 1.05 (S4) mV. The study was carried out to test against Alternaria alternata. The antimicrobial activity was tested by calculating the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) which was smallest for S4 having a value of 0.005%, compared to 0.02% for S0. A higher OEO concentration disrupts the cell walls lipids and leads to transudation of the lipids and cell death.199 Also, the terpenes can damage the mitochondrial membrane to kill the microbes.200 Thus, OEO helps in antimicrobial activity.\n\nIn a similar study, CS, OEO, and poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) were electrospun to develop antimicrobial fibrous mats.201 The average diameter was in the range of 332.4 ± 138.7 (CS/PCL) to 206.5 ± 96.90 (CS/OEO(5%)/PCL). The advantage of adding OEO is the smooth surface because the liquid state of the oil decreases the viscosity of the electrospinning solution. It is also clear from the decrease in roughness from 84.56 ± 3.75 nm to 62.89 ± 4.67 nm for CS/PCL and CS/OEO(5%)/PCL, respectively. However, the wettability was not affected significantly by varying the OEO concentration and slightly decreases from the control surface (117.65 ± 0.35°) to 112.07 ± 2.11° for 5% OEO content. The antimicrobial test was carried out via the colony counting method after 3 and 6 h. The results indicate that the antimicrobial efficiency after 6 h was not efficient owing to the high reproductivity of bacteria and that the inhibition efficiency decreased with time. So, CS/OEO/PCL is not much more efficient than the NPs discussed earlier.\n\nIn another study, chitosan with three different concentrations of capsaicin blend was used to test against various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.202 The anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, anticancer, antiobesity, and analgesic properties of capsaicin make it a likely candidate for antimicrobial activity. Three different concentrations of capsaicin, viz., 0.3, 0.6, and 1.2 mg, and 200 mg of chitosan were used to prepare the blend and are abbreviated as CCF-0.3, CCF-0.6, and CCF-1.2, respectively. The contact angles show an increase in hydrophobicity with the addition of capsaicin, and the values were 81.11° ± 1.31 (chitosan), 85.08° ± 4.70 (CCF-0.3), 87.57° ± 2.46 (CCF-0.6), and 91.02° ± 1.84 (CCF-1.2), suggesting the hydrophobic nature of capsaicin and homogeneous mixture blends. The film surface becomes rough at a very high concentration of capsaicin (CCF-1.2), and below this concentration, the overall film was more homogeneous and smoother. Furthermore, the increase in capsaicin concentration to CCF-1.2 led to maximum antimicrobial performance and the maximum zone of inhibition as compared to those of CCF-0.3 and CCF-0.6. For example, the maximum inhibition zone of 13.19 ± 0.87 mm was obtained for Proteus mirabilis while CCF-0.3 and CCF-0.6 exhibited values of 4.85 ± 0.42 and 9.26 ± 0.68 mm, respectively. This is attributed to the interaction between capsaicin’s phytochemicals and cell walls of bacteria causing lysis of the bacterial cell wall. The antimicrobial activity of the blended surface showed better performance against Gram-negative bacteria than against Gram-positive bacteria. The lipid–lipid interaction caused the disruption of the peptidoglycan structure in Gram-negative bacteria. With regard to Gram-negative bacteria, Enterobacter aerogenes was most sensitive, while Proteus vulgaris shows remarkable resistance against antimicrobial agents due to the ability to elongate themselves and secrete a polysaccharide on contact with the blend surface. In contrast, Gram-positive bacteria such as S. aureus and S. mutans show similar antimicrobial behavior, and the maximum resistance was exhibited by Bacillus thuringiensis because of endospores.\n\nBuslovich et al. coated chitosan with vanillin, a volatile, naturally occurring antimicrobial agent, using a concentration of 3.7 μmol/g and ultrasonic irradiation.203 The film roughness increased to 8.58 nm in chitosan–vanillin, while pristine chitosan exhibits a roughness of 5.73 nm. The effect of roughness also seen in the antimicrobial activity as studied by counting the CFU against two bacteria Gram-negative E. coli and Gram-positive S. aureus bacteria. However, the vanillin did not affect the antimicrobial performance, and the decrease from log CFU of 10 mL–1 in pure vanillin to ∼4 mL–1 was attributed to the presence of chitosan. The chitosan–vanillin blend was beneficial against the yeast and mold in preserving the food quality.\n\nBiodegradable Antimicrobial Materials\n\nAlthough various conventional chemical-based antimicrobial agents have been developed, there is a need to develop natural and biodegradable biocides with improved antimicrobial performance. The aim should also be to protect unwanted microorganisms and kill only the targeted pathogens. Thus, the present section deals with biodegradable-based antimicrobial agents.\n\nApart from synthetic polymers, biodegradable polymers have also been researched to harness antimicrobial activity. These materials can be regenerated by the enzymatic action on the microbes or living species. The advantage of natural and biodegradable-based products is their environmental friendliness.205,206 The raw component is mainly biomass. Different biomass-based derived polymers such as proteins and polysaccharides and synthetic polymers like polylactic acid (PLA), PVA, ethylene–vinyl alcohol (EVOH) and polycaprolactones (PCL). The other examples are genetically modified bacterial cellulose or PHAs.207−211 The researchers have explored different ways to utilize biodegradable polymers-based antimicrobial activity as mentioned below.\n\nRomano et al. designed poly(ε-caprolactone) nanocapsule suspensions (NCs) containing OEO and Thymus capitatus (thyme) essential oils to act against E. coli and Kokuria rhizophila.(212) The thyme-based capsules show good potential in treating microbes having a MIC value of 0.3 mg mL–1 for both microorganisms while OEO-based antimicrobial agents show MICs of 0.6 and 0.5 mg mL–1 against E. coli and K. rhizophila, respectively. The reason for the high activity of thyme-based NCs is due to the high content of carvacrol (73%) which disrupts the cell membrane.\n\nIn another study, Musiol et al. have used biodegradable polymer nanocomposites for S. aureus degradation. Poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate)] was used as a polymer matrix, while different contents of wood flour and nisin were used to provide biodegradation. The bacteriocin nisin was also incorporated in PLA and PLA/polyethylene glycol (PLA/PEG) blends to test Micrococcus luteus by Holcapkova et al.213 The effect of temperature on the antimicrobial activity was also studied. The results showed that nisin/PLA retained antimicrobial activity up to 70%, while PEG adversely degraded the nisin above 120 °C.\n\nLignin, the second most abundant biopolymer after cellulose, is a renewable material and exhibits antimicrobial properties. In a work performed by Domínguez-Robles et al., the lignin was added with biocompatible/biodegradable poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) to form biocomposites against S. aureus.(214) The contact angles of the composites were similar to that of the pure PBS having a value of ∼75°. However, the biocomposites show ∼90% reduction in the adherence capacity concerning control PBS. Furthermore, İnal and Mülazımoğlu used different ratios of poly([2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl] trimethylammonium chloride) (PMETAC) with gelatin nanofibers to act against S. aureus, E. coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii. The MIC with of gelatin nanofibers with 80 wt % PETAC was 109.15 ± 10.76 μg mL–1, while it was 193.57 ± 20.59 μg mL–1 for E. coli.\n\nFood additives such as pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) peel powder have also been incorporating in gelatin for improved antimicrobial performance.215 The antimicrobial activity of pomegranate is associated with the presence of high levels of ellagitannins.216 The sensitivity of the tested microbes of 5% (w/w based on gelatin weight) follows the order: S. aureus (7.00 ± 0.71 mm) > L. monocytogenes (5.13 ± 0.25 mm) > E. coli (4.13 ± 0.25 mm). In a similar study, passion fruit byproduct extracts were used to produce poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) with different ratios of different PLGA lactide to glycolide of 50:50 and 65:35. E. coli and Listeria innocua were tested, and the results showed that different ratios have different antimicrobial performance with seed and cake extracts. In summary, the PLGA 65:35 particles were effective against L. innocua and exhibited MIC values of 373 and 188 μg mL–1 for the seed and cake extracts, respectively.\n\nFurthermore, the biodegradable guanidinium-functionalized polycarbonates were designed for in vivo antimicrobial activity against A. baumannii, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa.(217) At the optimum degree of polymerization (DP) = 20, different hydrophobic spacer groups such as alkyl (ethyl, propyl, butyl, and pentyl) and aromatic (cyclohexyl, phenyl, and benzyl) groups were examined and the improved hydrophobicity of the spacer groups from alkyl to aromatic results in an increase in the hemolysis.\n\nHassan et al. fabricated the cellulose nanowhiskers Ag NPs (CCNWs-AgNPs) with nanocomposited chitosan and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) using a freeze-drying method for bone tissue engineering applications. Different types of characterization studies have been explored to prove the enhanced scaffold porosity, mechanical strength, and swelling properties with enhanced resistance on enzymatic degradation and toxicity analysis of the as-prepared scaffolds. The excellent antimicrobial activity and improved cell growth was witnessed for the CCNWs-AgNPs incorporated CMC scaffolds, which gained significant attention for bone tissue engineering applications.211\n\nA BC biocomposite gel-film with Bacillus subtilis cells was tested for biomedical applications. A high antagonistic activity was evidenced for the B. subtilis (BS) immobilized cells against causative agents responsible for wound infections such as S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa. On the basis of the mechanisms explored, this work claims that the BC/BS biomaterial would be a universal wound coating as well as a sanitary hygienic product. Also, it was reported that the antibacterial activity was enhanced mainly due to the lytic enzymes action actively lysing cells of bacteria (Gram-positive and Gram-negative).218\n\nState-of-the-art progress in cellulose-based hydrogels for advanced biomedical applications was presented by Fu et al. The topics covered in the review were synthesis methods, characterization methods based on physicochemical and mechanical properties, and emerging biomedical applications of cellulose-based hydrogels such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, bioimaging, wound dressing, and wearable sensors. The current challenges and future prospects on the biomedical applications of cellulose-based hydrogels were discussed at length. It was concluded that other than biomedical applications there are few more emerging fields which can utilize the great potential of cellulose hydrogels, particularly in agriculture and chemical fertilizers applications.219\n\nOne of the reviews on cellulose based superhydrophobic coatings was summarized 40 different approaches adopted to fabricate superhydrophobic coating. Detailed attention was paid to explaining the antiwetting properties of cellulose-based coatings along with the other functional properties such as transparency, gas permeability, anti-bio-fouling, self-healing properties, UV shielding, packaging, and photoactivity. The range of applications of cellulose, including self-cleaning and breathable clothing, water and stain repellence, filters for oil/water separation, cost-effective and biodegradable lab-on-a-chip devices, have gained considerable attention in the real world as the products are made from renewable sources with minimal material consumption.220 The nanocellulose-based antimicrobial materials applications such as drug carriers, wound dressings, and packaging materials were reviewed extensively by Li et al.39 The challenges of industrial production of nanocellulose-based antimicrobial materials were also discussed. The promising future of BC was reviewed based on wound dressing applications by Portela et al.221 This review summarized the physicochemical properties, mechanical properties, cell adhesion, biocompatibility, and nontoxicity properties of BC in tissue engineering applications, especially for wound-healing applications. It was concluded that BC can be a great alternate biopolymer to petroleum-based ones as it shows excellent biocompatibility, flexibility for molding while being used for 3D bioprinting, nontoxicity, native purity, environmental friendliness, and recyclability.\n\nThus, biodegradable polymers are also becoming an attractive alternative for antimicrobial performance owing to their low cost, renewability, and environmental friendliness. Table 2 compares different biodegradable-based antimicrobial agents.\n\nTable 2\n\nmaterialcontrol surfacevariantamethod (s)contact angle (deg)rms roughness (nm)best suited for microorganismantimicrobial activity/percentage/inhibition zone (mm)refmarbleNCs containing O. vulgare and T. capitatus EOsagar discs contact testNANAE. coli, K. rhizophila0.3 mg mL–1(212)P(3HB-co-4HB)P(3HB-co-4HB)/WF/nisindisc diffusion assayNANAS. aureus3.5 ± 1 mm(222)PBSligninagar discs contact test∼75NAS. aureus90% reduction(214)gelatinPMETACbroth microdilution procedureNANAS. aureus109.15 ± 10.76 μg mL–1(223)gelatinpomegranate (Punica granatum L.) peel powderdisk diffusion methodNANAS. aureus7.00 ± 0.71 mm(215)PLA and PLA/PEG blendsnisinagar diffusion methodNANAM. luteus∼100% (PLA/nisin)(213)polycarbonatesguanidiniumagar diffusion methodNANAS. aureus3.9 μg mL–1(217)free extractPLGA 50:50 and 65:35 particlesmicrodilution methodNANAL. innocua188 μg mL–1(224)\n\nProtein-Based Antimicrobial Surfaces\n\nProteins are the building blocks of biological structures and tissues and regulate physiological processes and somatic functions.225 Peptides offer several advantages such as biocompatibility, nontoxicity, self-assembly and ecofriendliness, and recently “peptoids” have been reported with excellent antimicrobial properties.226−228 In the last 50 years, the advancements in antibiotic drugs were also accompanied by an increase in the cases of antimicrobial resistance. Thus, there is a constant need for new antibiotics including AMPs-based antibiotics which are also a part of multicellular organisms. More than 750 AMPs have been discovered in different living animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, and viruses.229,230\n\nBrogden has classified AMPs into five subgroups based on the amino acid composition and structure as follows:231\n\n(i) anionic peptides\n\nsmall peptides having molecular weights in the range of 721.6–823.8 Da\n\nresponsive to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria\n\nactive in the presence of zinc cofactor\n\nexamples: Maximin H5, dermcidin, glutamic and aspartic acids\n\n(ii) linear cationic α-helical peptides\n\ncontain ∼290 cationic peptides\n\nrelatively short repeating units of amino acids (<40), associated with a kink in the middle and lack cysteine residues\n\ndisordered in aqueous solution and partially or completely convert to α-helix in the presence of phospholipid vesicles, trifluoroethanol, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), micelles and liposomes\n\nexamples: cecropins, magainin, pleurocidin, seminalplasmin\n\n(iii) cationic peptides enriched for specific amino acids\n\ncontain ∼44 cationic peptides\n\nlack of cysteine residues and are linear and sometimes form extended coils\n\nrich in certain amino acids such as prophenin (proline: 57% and phenylalanine:19%) and indolicidin (tryptophan residues)\n\nexamples: proline, arginine, glycine, tryptophan, histidine\n\n(iv) anionic and cationic peptides that contain cysteine and form disulfide bonds\n\ncomprised of ∼380 members\n\nexamples: peptides containing 1–3 disulfide bonds (brevinins, protegrin, and α-, β-, or θ-defensins) as well as drosomycin\n\n(v) anionic and cationic peptide fragments of larger proteins\n\nalso exhibit antimicrobial activity\n\nexamples: lactoferricin, casocidin I\n\nThe antimicrobial activities of peptides depend on their structure such as size, sequence, conformation, charge, hydrophobicity, and amphipathicity. Although peptide-mediated antimicrobial activity can be very rapid, such that it cannot be characterized by various available techniques or can happen in 15–90 min, the exact mechanism is still not clear. However, the specific steps of the overall process can be summarized by three proposed mechanisms as follows.231−234\n\nBarrel-Stave Model\n\nThis model is named based on the resultant “barrel and stave” type structure obtained upon the interaction between peptides and cell membrane. The peptide helices arrange in the form of the bundle, and the central lumen structure is similar to a barrel with helical peptides forming a stave-type architecture. The alamethicin response with a membrane follows this model. The hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions of the helical peptides align with the lipid region of the bilayer and interior region of the pores, respectively.\n\nCarpet Model\n\nIn this model, the peptides accumulate and are arranged parallel or in-plane to the surface of the membrane in a carpetlike manner. The electrostatic interaction between peptides and membranes is responsible for this arrangement. After the threshold concentration, the formation of transient toroidal holes takes place which allows the passage for upcoming peptides into the membrane. At high peptide concentration, the peptides disrupt the bilayer and form micelles. Ovispirin shows this type of antimicrobial activity.\n\nToroidal-Pore Model\n\nIn this model, the antimicrobial peptide helices form a toroidal-pore-type of morphology by insertion and bending the lipid monolayers. The structure extends leaflets of the membrane from top to bottom in a continuous manner. The polar groups of peptide and lipids associate each other during the toroidal pore formation. Various peptides such as magainins, protegrins, and melittin exhibit this type of activity.\n\nPeptides have also been explored as antifouling coatings to minimize the nonspecific adsorption of microbes. Sakala and Reches have classified peptides into different parts and thoroughly discussed their significance for the antimicrobial activity.235 The main classifications include self-assembled peptides, PEGylated peptides, zwitterionic peptide-based self-assembled monolayers, peptidomimetic coatings, and AMPs grafted on surfaces. The most used peptides are self-assembled. The advantage of these peptides is the formation of a well-ordered structure from simple building blocks, dipeptides, or amino acids, consisting of 10–50 amino acids.236 The self-assembled supramolecular structures are associated with the various types of noncovalent interactions including electrostatic force, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interaction, and π–π stacking interaction.237,238 The various aspects and applications of proteins based antimicrobial performance are detailed below and summarized in Table 3.\n\nTable 3\n\nmaterialcontrol surfacevariantmethod (s)contact angle (deg)rms roughness (nm)best suited for microorganismantimicrobial activity/percentage/inhibition zone (mm)refstainless steelDopa-conjugated peptide amphiphile and REDV-conjugated peptide amphiphilecounting the number of live cells using fluorescence microscope images<10168.5 ± 16.1HUVEC, A7r5 and A10 cells70% viability for A7r5(239)PDMSHEG/tripeptide (Arg–Gly–Asp)/cell-adhesive peptidecounting the number of live cells using fluorescence microscope imagesNANAS. aureus5.15 ± 1.21 × 103(243)PMOXA and PDMS polymeric micelleKYE28static biofilm formation assay78NAE. coli∼80 (CFU)(244)GG8FF8MTT assayNANAE. coli∼100%(242)natural hairpin AMP PG-1cCF10microtiter dilution methodNANAE. faecalis4 μM(245)LK13 peptide and tobramycinCS-PEG-LK13agar plate counting methodNANAP. aeruginosa8 μg mL–1(247)polymyxindarobactinmicro broth dilutionNANAE. coli, K. pneumoniae2 μg mL–1(246)colistinZY4tube microdilution assayNANAP. aeruginosa, A. baumanniiP. aeruginosa (2.0–4.5 μg/mL) and A. baumannii (4.6–9.4 μg/mL)(248)Ce6-SiNPsGP-Ce6-SiNPsagar plate experimentsNANA∼98 and ∼96% against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa∼98% S. aureus(249)PVA-co-PEBDCA-RNMagar plate counting methodNANAE. coli>99.9999%(250)\n\nCeylan et al. investigated the fabrication and application in antifouling surfaces using dopamine and REDV providing adhesion to the surface and selective growth of endothelial cells on the stainless-steel surface.239 The two phenylalanine residues modified with fluorine directed self-assembling and form π–π stacking. The improved hydrophobicity prevents the adhesion of bacteria. Furthermore, the cell viability was also measured for three cell lines, namely, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), A7r5 rat aortic smooth muscle cells, and A10 rat aortic smooth muscle cells. HUVEC showed maximum relative cell adhesion of ∼8 than that of stainless steel having a value of 1. However, A7r5 and A10 cells exhibited similar relative cell adhesion of ∼1. The A7r5 and A10 cell viability showed maximum decrease to ∼70%, while it remains similar for HUVEC (∼100%).\n\nThe self-assembling peptide-based hydrogels also attract sufficient attention,240 and Schnaider et al. showed potent application by selecting organic (nanofibrillar silk microgels)/inorganic (Ag) hybrids toward antimicrobial activity both in vivo and in vitro against E. coli.241 The mechanism follows the two-step form of bacterial adherence and consequent eradication. The 75% of the bacteria were eliminated using the specifically designed hydrogels.\n\nIn another work, Zhang and co-workers developed a novel cationic octapeptide, termed FF8 or KRRFFRRK, which is constituted of arginine, lysine, and phenylalanine.242 It undergoes self-assembly at a higher pH (>9.4) into amyloid-like fibers. Thus, it acts by self-assembling into nanofibers upon the contact with negatively charged lipid membrane, similar to the “carpet model”. The antimicrobial activity of the resultant structure was tested with E. coli and S. aureus, and the results exhibit a stronger inhibitory effect for E. coli. The weaker inhibitory effect of S. aureus was associated with its thick cell walls which limited the interaction between FF8 and the cell membrane. Furthermore, the viability tests showed that E. coli was completely killed in 30 min, showing good antimicrobial activity.\n\nIn another study, Li et al. designed a trilayered architecture: a top layer, cell-adhesive peptide; middle layer, infectious-environment-responsive peptide; and bottom layer: antifouling hexaethylene glycol (HEG).243 The bottom layer acts as a surface resistant to microbial adhesion and can bind to surfaces such as silicon, PDMS, and glass via silane chemistry. The reason for HEG’s effectiveness is attributed to its repulsive elastic force to the upcoming macromolecules toward it due to compression. The middle layer interacts with two bacterial enzymes, namely, gelatinase (G) and coagulase (C). The top layer is a peptide Arg–Gly–Asp (RGD) that promotes cell adhesion. The antibiofilm activity showed that the surfaces incubated with positive bacteria are relatively clean and that biofilm formation takes place with Gram-negative bacterial strains. Thus, the HEG layer is more responsive for Gram-positive bacteria, leading to improved antimicrobial activity.\n\nAMPs have gained much attention due to their efficient antimicrobial activities. The electrostatic interaction between the positively charged amino acid and negatively charged lipid bilayers leads to cell damage and killing of microbes.\n\nRigo et al. used an active and a passive approach with and without, respectively, attaching AMP KYE28 (KYEITTIHNLFRKLTRLFRRNFYTLR) on a poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) (PMOXA) and poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) polymeric micelle.244 KYE28 is found in human heparin cofactor II and shows bactericidal action against the cell membrane. The WCA also increased to 78° with KYE28 addition as compared to 63° for micelle-immobilized surfaces. The increased hydrophobicity was due to the amphiphilic nature of the peptide. The antimicrobial activity was checked by immersing different substrates in an E. coli inoculum (5 × 104 CFU mL–1). The KYE28-based substrates successfully reduced the bacterial adhesion and were more efficient than micelle-immobilized surfaces. This also resulted in bacterial survival of only 16%, while micelle-based surfaces show 43% survival. Thus, the combined effects of active and passive defense mechanisms leads to improved antimicrobial performance.\n\nXu et al. constructed different AMPs targeted at Enterococcus faecalis with a targeting domain of enterococcal pheromone cCF10, and target specificity was improved by the optimized active center of the AMP.245 The specially designed films were tested on Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus 1005, E. faecalis 25922, and S. epidermidis 7913) and Gram-negative bacteria (S. typhimurium 29213, S. pullorum 43300, and E. coli 12228). Site-specificity was achieved by tuning the electrostatic interactions between the AMPs and microbes. A weaker interaction is supposed to prevent the entrance of molecules into the microbial membrane and made the antimicrobial inactive. The net charges on the peptides were tuned to +6 (cCF10-C6), +4 (cCF10-C4), and +3 (cCF10-C3). It was shown that bacterial growth is unaffected by cCF10. C6 and C6-cCF10 exhibited similar activity, and cCF10-C6 showed 4-fold higher bactericidal activity for E. faecalis. Thus, cCF10 provided selectivity for the antimicrobial activity against E. faecalis. Furthermore, cCF10-C4 lead to reduced activity toward all the untargeted bacteria except for E. faecalis. The further decrease in the charge of cCF10-C3 and random peptide severely affected the activity for all the bacteria. Thus, a suitable pheromone–receptor interaction helps in selectively acting on specific microbes.\n\nIn another interesting study, Imai et al. reported a new antibiotic, darobactin, to selectively kill in vitro and in animal infections associated with Gram-negative pathogens.246 Darobactin is a heptapeptide having an amino acid sequence of W1–N2–W3–S4–K5–S6–F7. The MIC value of 2 μg mL–1 was obtained against E. coli and K. pneumoniae.\n\nApart from different bacteria, WHO also listed P. aeruginosa as a critical pathogen in 2017. The biofilms are 100–1000 times more tolerable toward antibiotics than that of bacteria associated with the surrounding extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). This helps in restricting the antibacterial agents from deep penetration in a biofilm. Furthermore, biofilms have two important characteristics, namely, water-filled channels for nutrient/waste transportation having sizes ranging up to micrometers and EPS which makes the biofilm highly charged and helps in adsorbing ionic constituents. The EPS is usually composed of polysaccharides, lipids, proteins, and extracellular DNA.\n\nFrom the viewpoint of biofilm characteristics, Ju et al. prepared a CS−PEG−peptide conjugate (CS-PEG-LK13, where LK13 refers to the sequence LKLLKKLLKKLKK) to study antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa biofilms, and the mechanism is as shown in .247 In a, in an aqueous environment CS-PEGLK13 self-assembled into neutrally charged nanospheres of size 100 nm with LK13 and PEG in the core and on the surface, respectively, and was capable of traveling in a water-filled channel. However, it disassembles upon contact with the bacterial membrane, and the exposed cationic and hydrophobic domains of α-helical LK13 peptide disrupt the cell membrane ( b). The as-prepared assembly was tested on two Gram-negative bacteria (P. aeruginosa: ATCC 15442 and E. coli: ATCC 25922) and one Gram-positive bacterium (S. aureus: ATCC 6538). The MIC values follows the order: P. aeruginosa (8 μg peptide/mL) < E. coli (16 μg peptide/mL) < S. aureus (64 μg peptide/mL). The higher value for S. aureus is due to the absence of an outer membrane, and CS-PEG-LK13 continued to remain in the self-assembled structure. Also, when the concentration was enhanced to 16 times the MIC, an antibacterial efficiency of 97.95% was achieved, while a control surface of LK13 peptide and the antibiotic tobramycin exhibited efficiencies of 41.58 and 45.50%, respectively.\n\nPrevious reports also suggest that cyclization positively impacts antimicrobial activity and selectivity. Mwangi et al. designed a cyclic peptide ZY4 (VCKRWKKWKRKWKKWCV-NH2) which forms a stable disulfide bridge and acts in vitro and in vivo against P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii, and the MIC values were in the ranges of 2.0–4.5 and 4.6–9.4 μg mL–1, respectively.248 The advantage of using ZY4 is that it comprised only 17 amino acids, and its smaller size also lead to a lower cost than that of large amino acids based peptides.\n\nTang et al. devoted their study to simultaneous imaging and treating the bacterial infections to carefully investigate the antimicrobial phenomenon.249 The specially designed GP-Ce6-SiNPs nanoagents (where GP: glucose polymer, Ce6: chlorin e6, and SiNPs: silicon NPs) as shown in . SiNPs and Ce6 provide fluorescence benefits, and GP works as the major microbial carbon source. Gram-positive bacteria such as S. aureus and M. luteus and Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli and P. aeruginosa were tested. The antibacterial efficiencies were ∼98 and ∼96% against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, respectively, and the improved results were due to the photodynamic effect of Ce6.\n\nIn an important study, Sun and co-workers developed robust daylight-driven rechargeable antibacterial (>99.9999%) and antiviral (>99.999%) nanofibrous membranes (RNMs).250 The specifically designed membranes were able to produce and store biocidal reactive oxygen species (ROS) in daylight and release them in dim or dark conditions. The mechanism is illustrated in a. The pathogens attack the surface of the membrane in the presence of light irradiation via various ROS such as hydroxyl radicals (•OH), superoxide (•O2–), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). These subsequently rupture the DNA, RNA, and bacterial membrane parts leading to bacterial death and virus inactivation.\n\nThe results were also applied for bioprotective PPE application as shown in b–g.250 The BDCA-RNM (BD: 4-benzoyl benzoic acid, CA: chlorogenic acid, which both act as photobiocides) were fabricated on masks and protective suits followed by injection of 1 × 106 CFU of aerosols containing E. coli (diameter = 1–5 μm) which is also similar to that obtained from human sneezing or coughing. The results were compared at three locations, namely, a control area, a BDCA-RNM area, and a covered area. It can be observed from d,g that the designed antimicrobial membranes provide robust protection against the pathogens. The control area suffered from bacterial growth and proliferation associated with the nonbiological function of traditional nonwoven materials.\n\nLázár et al. studied the effect of cross-resistance or collateral sensitivity monitored by decreased and increased sensitivity, respectively, on peptides due to the small-molecule antibiotics.251 On the basis of the study of 60 E. coli strains toward 24 antimicrobial peptides, it has been concluded that cross-resistance is relatively rare, and a high frequency of collateral sensitivity is achieved.\n\nGao et al. prepared 3,6-O-sulfated chitosan (36S) to act against high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection via Western blot assay.252 These chitosan derivatives exhibit good selectivity and may directly or indirectly inhibit virus infection. In other words, it may directly bind to HPV or indirectly interfere with the host PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. In another study, Khalil et al. formulated γ-poly gamma-glutamic acid (PGA)–chitosan NPs to encapsulate adenovirus through ionic interaction.253 The size and zeta potential of the NPs were 485.8 ± 2.3 nm and −23.7 ± 1.4 mV, respectively. The encapsulation efficiency was ∼92%. The cytotoxicity results showed a decrease to ∼75% at 5 mg mL–1, while the lowest concentration of 0.156 mg mL–1 showed no cytotoxicity.\n\nYu et al. developed a guanidinothiosialoside-albumin conjugate mimicking mucin to act against influenza infection.15 The improved virus capture and trapping was associated with the glycoconjugate bonds. More specifically, the neuraminidase present on the surface of influenza virus strongly bonded to the neomucin and was responsible for the antiviral activity. The virus cell viability was reduced to ∼50% at 105 nM conjugates, suggesting that mucin-based nanostructures have the potential to provide antiviral activity. Recently, Palmeira et al. identified GRP78 inhibitors to interfere with and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.254 The results indicated that the GRP78 gene expression was increased in SARS-CoV-2 (+) versus SARS-CoV-2 (−) samples. The associated mechanism is the reduced activity of ATPase on binding with the GRP78 nucleotide. Also, the epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) present in green tea catechin showed antiviral activity for porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) as reported by Li et al.14 The interaction between EGCG and PCV2 leads to the interference between the capsid-heparan sulfate. The EC50 (effective concentration at 50% of the maximal effect) was also calculated to be 37.79 ± 1.64 μM. The observed efficacy was no more potent than that of the conventional antivirals; however, the identification of the amino acid could lead to the further development of effective antivirus drugs. Kirsch et al. tried to understand the role of latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) against Kaposi’s sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV).255 The protein’s ability to bind the viral genome and the host nucleosomes helped in its attachment. Thus, restricting the LANA–DNA interaction was responsible for the reduction of the host’s viral DNA. The cytotoxicity study was also carried out on HEK293 and HepG2 cells and achieved maximum activities of 7 ± 6 and 20 ± 9%, respectively, at 100 μM. Apart from viruses, da Silva studied antifungal and antiprotozoal activity using rhamnolipids-based amino acids.256 It was deduced that the cationic rhamnolipids showed activity against Candida species, while cationic as well as anionic rhamnolipids were potent against protozoal Acanthamoeba castellanii at a concentration of 4 mg L–1. Long et al. explored the activity of a garlic oil nanoemulsion against Penicillium italicum for antifungal action.257 They used an ultrasonication technique to synthesize the nanoemulsion with the size and concentration of 52.27 nm and 5.5%, respectively. This resulted in the destruction of the lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins of the microbe with an improved MIC of 0.01265% for the garlic oil nanoemulsion, compared to that of 3.7% for garlic oil alone.\n\nAntibacterial and Antiviral Properties of Nanomaterials\n\nIn the following sections, the role of emerging nanomaterials such as TiO2, silver, and copper for the antibacterial and antiviral applications are discussed in detail.\n\nTiO2-Based Antimicrobial Materials\n\nDevelopment in the area of nanobiotechnology has resulted in a variety of materials that have potential applications as antibacterial materials.38 TiO2 is one of the most commonly used semiconductors for antimicrobial applications in contemporary literature.258−260 The unique property of TiO2 is useful for disinfection microorganisms including bacteria, fungi, and virus.261−263 Biosynthesized TiO2 NPs were found to be most effective compared to a chemical process for antimicrobial applications due to low cost, nontoxicity, and high stability.264 Recently, coatings of semiconductor-based photocatalysts like TiO2 over surfaces were studied as antibacterial surfaces and evaluated for the decomposition of various microorganism like bacteria, fungi, and virus.265,266 The decomposition microorganisms principally is due to the light-harvesting ability of TiO2.261 Efficacy of TiO2 as an antimicrobial agent depends on several parameters: (i) the size and shape of the TiO2 nanocrystal, (ii) the stability of the TiO2 nanocrystals (iii) the extent of electron–hole separation, (iv) reduced charge carrier recombination, and (v) the extended absorption in the visible region. Crystallite phase-dependent TiO2 film was investigated for deactivation of microorganisms (Streptococcus sanguinis, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Fusobacterium nucleatum) by Pantaroto et al. under UV light exposure.267 Anatase, rutile, and a mixture of anatase and rutile films were obtained using a radio frequency magnetron-sputtering technique. Antibacterial activity was investigated for a period of 16.5 h with a period of 1 h of UV-A light irradiation on the TiO2 surface. The greatest antibacterial activity was obtained with the mixture film (anatase and rutile), followed by anatase and rutile films, respectively.\n\nThe excellent photocatalytic activity of the mixture is probably due to the Type II band gap alignment which significantly reduces electron and hole pair separation. As a result, excess production of ROS on the TiO2 surface inactivates the microorganism. Enhancement of the antimicrobial activity against E. coli and S. aureus was reported by Al-Jawad et al. upon Fe doping within TiO2 films under UV light exposure.268 Deposition of TiO2 film over glass slide was carried out via a spin coating method using titanium tetra isopropoxide as the titanium precursor. The crystallite size of TiO2 film was found to be 19–26 nm; 3, 4, 5, and 6 vol % Fe doping was achieved within the film using ferric nitrate as the Fe precursor. The presence of Fe within the TiO2 lattice improved absorption of radiant energy, which significantly enhances ROS at the film surface leads to the decomposition of bacterial protein and DNA under UV illumination. The optimum activity was observed for 6% Fe-TiO2 films against S. aureus (97%) and E. coli (100%) using 1 h of UV light exposure. Au-capped anatase TiO2 (average size 12–18 nm) was found to be good antimicrobial coating material in comparison to its counterpart under UV LED irradiation.269 Here, both TiO2 and Au/TiO2 sprayed on a glass slide and improvement in antibacterial activity (as tested against Bacillus megaterium and E. coli) was observed. Au-coated TiO2 was found to be an efficient antimicrobial agent for the sterilization of E. coli. Here, the presence of Au over a TiO2 surface facilitates charge carrier separation and ROS production, which is responsible for pronounced antimicrobial activity. Wunderlich et al. reported TiO2-coated surfaces for antimicrobial application under UV-A light exposure.270 They deposited a titanium dioxide layer over a glass slide using 8 vol % tetraisopropylorthotitanat (TPOT, C12H28O4Ti) as the Ti precursor via a sol–gel method. Different strains (Aspergillus niger, Bacillus atrophaeus, Kocuria rhizophila) were identified to monitor antimicrobial activity on the TiO2-coated surface. An inactivation of about 3.4 log10 was reported using titanium dioxide after 4 h of UV-A illumination for K. rhizophila. Several parameters (relative humidity, inoculation density, and radiation intensity) were investigated on the antimicrobial efficiency. The highest inactivation (5.2 log10) observed (85% relative humidity) confirms the role of relative humidity directly upon the antimicrobial activity of titanium dioxide. Improvement in photocatalytic is observed at higher inocu"
