        "text": "Concentrations in weight percent (5- 25 wt %) of TiO2 films used to optimize the film formation. The TiO2 films on glass substrates successfully obtained by spin-coating process using TiO2 nanopowder as precursor. Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) equipped with Electron Diffraction X-ray (EDX) and X-ray Diffractometer (XRD) techniques used to characterize the films. The result of electron transport material (TiO2) showed that film prepared from 15 wt % of TiO2 solution and annealed at 450 has highest transmittance at visible light region with indirect optical band gap of 3.24 eV which corresponds to wavelength of 382 nm whereas 20 wt % has indirect band gap of 2.99 nm equivalent to 414.7 nm . The chemical analysis from Electron Diffraction Spectroscopy (EDS) of the material shows titanium and oxygen present at L and K-shells, respectively. The sample crystallized with preferred orientation at (101) from XRD analysis.\n\nTitanium dioxide thin films have been deposited onto glass substrate by spray pyrolysis technique at different substrate temperature(Ts =300 0 C to 400 0 C) and annealed at 500 0 C for 1hr.The annealed films were characterised by x-ray diffraction,scanning electron microscopy and uv-vis spectroscopy in order to identify their structure,phase,morphology compositionand optical properties respectively.The XRD profiles showed that films were polycrystalline,anatase type and oriented predominantly to the (101) plane.The optical properties of the films were studied using uv-vis spectrophotometer and from that energy band gap were evaluated.\n\nTitanium dioxide (TiO2) thin films were prepared by ion-assisted electron-beam deposition on glass at room temperature and were annealed by rapid thermal annealing in O2 and N2 gas flow. TiO2 thin films annealed in N2 gas flow are (110) rutile phase and (101) anatase phase, but in O2 gas flow are (110) rutile phase. The optical band gaps of the TiO2 thin films are increased to 3.281 eV with annealing treatment of 300 ~ 500 °C in O2 gas flow and to 3.271 eV in N2 gas flow. However, the band gap begins to decrease to 3.277 eV at the annealing temperature of 600 °C in O2 gas flow and to 3.257 eV in N2 gas flow, respectively.\n\nPulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) technique was performed to deposit the pure Titanium oxide (TiO2) nanoparticles on the glass substrate of temp. (100 - 400°C), using the doubled frequency of Nd: YAG laser wavelength of 532nm at (10) Hz rate, 10 nanosecond duration pulses and a constant laser energy 800 mJ. The optical measurements obtained by UV-Vis transmittance on deposited TiO2 films indicate the highest transparency in the visible wavelength region with an average transmittance of 80%. Estimated the relationship between the refractive index of TiO2 thin films with substrate temperature was n = 2.49 at 400 oC. Moreover, the calculated empirical relation between the energy gap and refractive index have similar to the work results.\n\nAbstract: Titanium oxide (TiO2) thin films have been deposited on to glass substrate by spray pyrolysis deposition technique (SPDT). The surface morphological, structural, electrical and optical properties of the asdeposited TiO2 thin films have been investigated as a function of substrate temperature (Ts). The scanning electron micrographs of as-deposited films showed uniform surface of TiO2 thin films. Elemental analysis clearly showed that the grains were typically comprised of both Ti and O in the thin films. Strong diffraction peaks (101) and (200) at 25° and 48° respectively indicating TiO2 in the anatase phase .The peaks were found to shift slightly from their standard positions at higher Ts, and there was some deviation in the lattice parameters. The crystallite size is found to be around 13 nm. The optical transmission of the thin films was found to increase from 73 to 89 % and the band gap energy shifts from 3.64 to 3.40 eV with increase of Ts. The room temperature dc electrical resistivity varies from 42 to 27 ohm.cm for the thin films grown at different Ts.\n\nIn this investigation, TiO2 thin films were synthesized by vacuum evaporation technique on glass substrates at room temperature. The films were then annealed at 200 and 250ºC in air for a period of 1 hour. The optical characterizations of the as deposited and annealed films were carried out using UVVIS transmittance spectroscopy in the wavelength range 300 900 nm in order to calculate the optical constants such as refractive index, extinction coefficient, real and imaginary parts of dielectric constant. Results illustrate that refractive index, extinction coefficient, both the real and imaginary parts of dielectric constant and the optical conductivity of the films are increasing with increasing annealing temperature, on the other hand, the value of the skin depth is found to be decreases as the annealing temperature increased to 250ºC, so the skin depth is a transmittance related. 2014 Trade Science Inc. - INDIA\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the annealing temperature on the structural and optical properties of TiO2 thin films, deposited by chemical bath deposition method (CBD) onto glass substrates. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments show that the well-known anatase phase was observed for some annealing temperature. The best conditions of crystallization were found upon annealing at temperatures higher than 400 °C in the air. The surface morphology of the deposited films characterized by the Field-Emission Gun Scanning Electron Microscope (FEGSEM) consists of granular texture with a clear identified grain at the surface. The size of the grains is more than 100 nm and increases with annealing temperature. The UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy shows that our films exhibit a high value of optical transmission which is around 80%. The indirect band gap of the deposited films was found to range between 3.17 and 3.44 eV depending on the annealing temperature. The Urbach ene..."
