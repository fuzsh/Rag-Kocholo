It aims to explore the emergence and consequences of concepts used to deﬁne ‘‘Latin America’’ while at the same time exploring the broad interplay of political, economic, and cultural practices that have shaped Latin American worlds. Latin America, at the crossroads of competing imperial designs and local responses, has been construed as a geocultural and geopolitical entity since the nineteenth century. This series provides a starting point to redeﬁne Latin America as a conﬁguration of political, linguistic, cultural, and economic intersections that demands a continuous reappraisal of the role of the Americas in history, and of the ongoing process of globalization and the relocation of people and cultures that have characterized Latin America’s experience. Latin America Otherwise: Languages, Empires, Nations is a forum that confronts established geocultural constructions, rethinks area studies and disciplinary boundaries, assesses convictions of the academy and of public policy, and correspondingly demands that the practices through which we produce knowledge and understanding about and from Latin America be subject to rigorous and critical scrutiny. Jessaca B. Leinaweaver’s study analyzes children’s mobility, from fostering to adoption to commercial tra≈c, in Ayacucho, Peru. Worldwide, children’s mobility is clearly a√ected by the desires and needs produced by capitalist economies and by increasing disparities between rich and poor at\n\nviii\n\na\n\nABOUT THE SERIES\n\nboth local and international levels. Children’s mobility in Peru is also intimately connected to European and North American desires for children that reproduce relations of benevolence and paternalism. In Peru today, children’s movements are grounded in traditional and historic communal practices of the Ayllu, but they also interact with the moral codes that structure Euro-American families. This ethnography situates the choices made by Andean families within a broader framework of structural, cultural, and demographic transformations, and documents the social creativity involved, on the part of both kin and state representatives, when arranging the care of children whose social networks have been attenuated under the pressures of poverty and social inequality. The Circulation of Children: Kinship, Adoption, and Morality in Andean Peru should be read not only by anthropologists interested in kinship in the Andes but also by scholars and students interested in globalization and in the continuing commodiﬁcation of human lives. It will also be useful for those concerned with ethics, human rights, and the human consequences of an economic philosophy that preaches development and progress as the ultimate horizon of human happiness.\n\na\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nIt’s become commonplace to say, under this heading, how many people have contributed to improving this work and how impossible it is to give each one the sincere thanks they are due. I cannot improve upon this frequently printed sentiment; this is a book that would not have seen the light of day without cooperation, support, encouragement, and constructive criticism from countless individuals. I name some of you here, and to those who I have not named because of space or conﬁdentiality restrictions, I want you to know that I am immeasurably appreciative, and hopefully not too ingrata. Errors or infelicities in this text are all my own, and are stubbornly present despite conscientious suggestions for improvement from one or more listed below. I am grateful to everyone who has read some or all of this work, in one form or another, and shared their comments with me. This book began life as a dissertation for the Department of Anthropology at the University of Michigan (Leinaweaver 2005b), an intellectual environment which I prized for the support among graduate students, the generosity of faculty, and the interdisciplinary cross-pollination that characterized my years there. Powerful examples of these qualities can be found in the Adoption, Infertility, and Gender reading group at the University of Michigan’s Institute for Research on Women and Gender, whose members I sincerely thank for a spirited discussion of my arguments and material in 2006, and the Univer-\n\nx\n\na\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nsity of Michigan’s Círculo Micaela Bastidas Phuyuqhawa, a node of Andeanist collegiality where I ﬁrst presented some of this material. Gratitude of the most sincere sort goes to my dissertation committee members, each of whom contributed their own wisdom and style to this project. Bruce Mannheim’s deep love and respect for Peru and its people is contagious, and I have long appreciated his support. Gillian Feeley-Harnik gave me extremely close readings of several chapters and drafts, and her warm enthusiasm has been irreplaceable. Marcia Inhorn’s thoughtful comments helped me to pinpoint my own contributions to broader conversations on infertility, gender, and love. Sabine MacCormack has constantly been insightful, discerning, and supportive. Nicole Berry was a careful, demanding, and extremely productive writing partner during the dissertation stage and beyond. Jeanine Anderson, Erdmute Alber, Megan Callaghan, Janet Finn, Sallie Han, and Krista Van Vleet also made perceptive and helpful suggestions on some of this material in various forms. Mary Weismantel deserves especial gratitude for pushing me to rethink and rewrite so thoroughly, and I hope I have done her comments justice. Two other anonymous reviewers for Duke University Press provided immeasurably helpful and detailed comments, and I thank them for their thoughtful suggestions. Thanks to Irene Silverblatt for taking a look at this work, and to Valerie Millholland and her sta√ at Duke for their outstanding competence. The research on which this book is based would have been impossible without a good deal of ﬁnancial support. The University of Michigan (in particular the Rackham Graduate School, the Department of Anthropology, and the International Institute) supported research trips in June–August 2000 and July 2004. Twenty-two months of dissertation ﬁeldwork (September 2001–July 2003) were generously supported by the following institutions: the Fulbright U.S. Student Program, the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research (Individual Research Grant No. 6805), the National Science Foundation (Dissertation Improvement Grant 0109060), and the Jacob K. Javits Fellowship Program at the U.S. Department of Education. My most recent visit to Peru, June–July 2006, was supported by the University Research Grants Program at the University of Manitoba, and I also thank the Centre on Aging for awarding me a course release at a critical time, along with my dean and department head at Manitoba who allowed\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\na\n\nxi\n\nme to arrange my courses so that I had a semester free to revise this book. Thanks also to the O≈ce of the Dean at the University of Manitoba for ﬁnancial support for this publication. My gratitude and warm appreciation go to all those in Peru who collaborated with my research. I am thankful to the adoptive families who allowed me to accompany them in their Peruvian journeys, to several contacts in then-promudeh, now-mimdes, and especially to my dear friend Maria Luisa Bustamante and her hardworking sta√ at Ayacucho’s adoption o≈ce. I also gratefully recognize the assistance of the directorship and employees of several orphanages and children’s homes in Ayacucho, and of Nelly Alanya, a social worker at Ayacucho’s family court. I very much appreciate the help of the dedicated and inexhaustible Sandra Soria at Lima’s anti-child-tra≈cking ngo, who shared with me her vast ﬁles and introduced me to José Alvarado at mimdes. Professors and sta√ at the San Cristobal of Huamanga National University (unsch) assisted in various ways, as did the anthropologist Juan Ossio Acuña, who helped me to a≈liate with the Pontiﬁcal Catholic University of Peru (pucp) in Lima. Most of all, I thank my dear compadres, ahijados, and amigos queridos from Socos, Ayacucho, and Lima, who welcomed me into their lives, and whom I cannot name because of my commitment of conﬁdentiality. ¡Viva el Perú! My own interests and abilities have been shaped ﬁrst and foremost by my family, whom I thank warmly and collectively for supporting and caring about me and my scholarly e√orts. I am certain that my desire to learn more about adoption as a cross-culturally strong and meaningful way to create family ties grows directly out of being a part of three generations of adoptive families. For teaching me about the importance of adoption and acceptance in North American family life, I am grateful to Emma, Elwood, Mabel, Richard, Edna, Sam, Arlene, Bob, Connie, Je√, Ellie, Joanna, Alexa, and Marisa. Finally, my partner Joshua Tucker is all over these pages—I thank him for his critical eye as a reader and colleague, and count myself ridiculously lucky to have him in my life.\n\na\n\nA Note on Translation\n\nThis work is ﬁltered through three languages: the English of this writing, the Spanish of the majority of interviews, interactions, and texts I analyzed, and the Quechua—Peru’s most-spoken indigenous language—that the majority of my interlocutors use daily. The rural migrants to Ayacucho with whom I spoke are generally bilingual in Spanish and Quechua. I can operate in either language. My Quechua is passable (although my tentative statements were always revised, in complimentary fashion, in hilarious retellings); I studied Quechua for three consecutive years at the University of Michigan and took intensive Quechua in Cuzco in 1999. In Spanish, though, I am essentially ﬂuent. My father, a theater professor, brought his wife and daughters along on his 1987 Fulbright to Costa Rica. I’ve spoken Spanish ever since, with reinforcement in high school courses, an undergraduate major, and an undergraduate semester abroad in Spain. I tried to let informants choose what language they wished to speak in. The preference to speak in Spanish likely reﬂected both my own language abilities, and the historical and social meanings of speaking one language over another, which I address in the introduction. Though I rarely held conversations of any substantial length in Quechua, my familiarity with the language meant I could better understand the sometimes accented and idiomatic Spanish spoken by my migrant interlocutors. It also meant I was attuned to the multiplicities of meaning that bilinguals bring to the key\n\nxiv\n\na\n\nA N O T E O N T R A N S L AT I O N\n\nwords under discussion (for instance, the importing of the Spanish familia or ‘‘family’’ into Quechua as phamillay). Most importantly, my knowledge of and obvious appreciation for Quechua helped me to achieve a good rapport with my subjects. All translations in the text, whether from Spanish-language books or from interviews, are my own, unless otherwise noted. I include in footnotes the Spanish originals of passages used from recorded interviews. If a quoted passage is not footnoted with the Spanish original, this indicates it was reconstructed from memories of conversations and from jotted notes; in these passages, I include only (and only occasionally) translations of key words because the original reconstruction may not be precisely accurate.\n\nIntroduction: MOVING CHILDREN IN AYACUCHO\n\na\n\n‘‘This child is abandoned,’’ argues a legal document ﬁled in Ayacucho’s family court at the beginning of the twenty-ﬁrst century. Its ﬁler, a lawyer for the Peruvian state’s adoption o≈ce, took pains to spell out the details of the abandonment. The ‘‘progenitrix’’ has mental problems, he argues, and cannot responsibly care for her o√spring, so the child has been placed in an orphanage (and note, por favor, the woman has other institutionalized children too). The lawyer clariﬁes: a woman in her sixties, living in an adobe house, has been caring both for the mother and the child and promises to continue to do so once the child is a little bit older. Her nephew, the woman claims, is the child’s father. But, writes the lawyer, nowhere is this paternity recorded, so this elderly woman is outside the equation—and certainly not a legitimate caretaker. Furthermore, neither her age nor the condition of her home is appropriate for her to care for this minor. And the progenitrix is at risk of irresponsibly procreating other children, putting this little girl in danger. Finally, it’s clear that the mother intends to leave the child with the sixty-year-old, evidencing a ‘‘lack of care about her upbringing and future education that proves the progenitrix’s lack of moral and mental qualities.’’∞ These are the reasons, concludes the lawyer, for which the toddler—now nearly two years old—should be legally declared ‘‘abandoned’’ and therefore be made available for adoption.≤ In the year’s worth of adoption ﬁles I read while doing ﬁeldwork in\n\n≤\n\na\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAyacucho, I found many documents like this one. Abandonment proceedings like this little girl’s produce children who are legally adoptable, delighting the hundreds of waiting families eager to embrace their future children. But the lawyer’s language oversimpliﬁes the complex and intricate details of the little girl’s ‘‘abandonment,’’ disregarding the many reasons that such legal interventions are possible, and for whom they might be desirable. Two themes have motivated my interpretation of ﬁles like this little girl’s. First, adoptions need to be understood in the context of the global political economy. In political terms, international adoptions move children from Third World sites of tragedy—of war, civil unrest, or disease—to First World parents in an unbalanced exchange (Briggs n.d.; see also Kapstein 2003). In economic terms, adoptions often resemble a shifting of the resource that is children from poor people, or poor countries, to wealthy ones. This is an imbalance that does not go unnoticed by young Peruvians like my teenaged goddaughter Olivia, who remarked, ‘‘Here, in Peru, almost no one adopts because they have their own children. Instead, they give in adoption to others.’’ Just as important, and perhaps more unsettling, is that adoptions are produced—as is clear from the ﬁle described above—against another set of relationships that an adoption lawyer must conscientiously deﬁne as inadequate. But those relationships—in this case, ties of a√ection, residence, responsibility, and kinship between the little girl, her ‘‘progenitrix,’’ and her purported paternal great-aunt—are socially legitimate, and many impoverished Peruvians rely on such connections both for sheer survival and as they strive for social and economic mobility. In other words, the clarity envisioned in this lawyer’s well-meaning but life-changing statement does not map neatly onto the complex and creative world of kinship and childhood that I found in Ayacucho. I’ll return to the little girl’s abandonment narrative at the end of these pages and revisit it in light of this social world.\n\nCHILD CIRCULATION: AN AHISTORY\n\nReading between the lines of the abandonment ﬁle described above, it’s clear that a child has been multiply relocated. She was ﬁrst cared for by her paternal great-aunt and was then placed in an orphanage, in what was probably meant to be a short-term arrangement, before ﬁnally leaving\n\nM O V I N G C H I L D R E N I N AYA C U C H O\n\na\n\n≥\n\nPeru via international adoption. The mobility of the young—their placement into the homes of relatives, state institutions, and adoptive families— grounds important social relationships between and among individuals, their communities, and the Peruvian state. The little girl’s ﬁrst relocation—her reception by her purported father’s aunt—exempliﬁes a kinship practice that has been labeled ‘‘child circulation’’ by anthropologists working on similar kinds of relationships (Fonseca 1986: 15). In child circulation, as a child physically moves into a new home, material, moral, and relational responsibilities are also transformed. Young people accompany (acompañar)—or are taken in by (recoger or acoger)≥ — their elders. Their transfer also provides children with access to instruction, education, shelter, or a√ection. The hallmark of child circulation is coresidence, a physical closeness coupled with sharing the daily tasks of the home: cooking, sweeping, combing hair. In this book, I focus on child circulation as an active process leading to the formation, and transformation, of relatedness and sociality. The importance of child circulation to building up social worlds in the Andes should be better understood before it serves as the foundation for declaring a child ‘‘abandoned.’’ Moving a child from one house to another is described throughout the Andean region with emphasis on the active ‘‘social work’’ done in or by the transfer.∂ For example, the Aymara term for transferred children focuses on the process of raising them: wila wawat uywasta (‘‘raised since birth’’) (Arnold 2002: 100). The Quichua term used by the Napo Runa in lowland Ecuador is apasha iñachina (‘‘to take and rear’’) (Uzendoski 2005). Urban indigenous people in Ecuador use the Spanish terms prestar or mandar, borrow/loan or send respectively, to refer to a similar practice of transferring children that bridges the rural-urban divide and is linked to begging (Swanson 2007). Adoption o≈cials occasionally called such uno≈cial child-raising prohijamiento, or making-into-one’s-child. The practice I am calling ‘‘child circulation’’ is explicitly contrasted with adopción, a legal, documented procedure. In my ﬁeld sites, however, the moment of moving to another household was usually described in a straightforward fashion, often with the phrase ‘‘went to live with,’’ fui a vivir con, so ‘‘child circulation’’ is a concept that I have imposed—for analytic and comparative reasons—on the various local terms and interpretations for children’s mobility.\n\n∂\n\na\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nChild circulation in Peru is also ‘‘a black statistic,’’ or a complete unknown in terms of numbers, as a highly placed o≈cial in Peru’s Ministry of Women and Human Development (Ministerio de la Mujer y del Desarrollo Humano, or mimdes) remarked to me. Our conversation was structured around the o≈cial’s primary concern, the far more sinister modality of child tra≈cking, of removing children from their natal homes for destinations unknown. But even for the more morally ambiguous or socially creative movements that I am calling child circulation, there are no reliable statistics indicating its frequency across Peru. I can say that I chose to study it because of the frequency with which I was o√ered babies on one of my ﬁrst trips to the region, and also that I found near-ubiquitous conﬁrmation of the practice in Andean ethnographies (e.g., Isbell 1978; Ossio 1992; Van Vleet 2008).∑ Although child circulation is neither labeled with a discrete term nor quantiﬁable with censuses or surveys or other instruments of population control, it is nonetheless a widely observable and understandable practice. Producing children as mobile beings whose movements between households can achieve a number of important ends, child circulation is a deliberate method of strengthening social ties, building an a√ective network that will remain key as a child matures into a world of poverty and distinction, and redistributing both the pleasures and constraints of parenting and being a child. Given the importance of family connections and the felt urgency of educating one’s children among rural-to-urban migrants, there is an unassailable cultural logic to this practice.∏ ‘‘Cultural logic’’ here implies that child circulation be seen as part of what Andeanists have held up as lo andino, practices of regional longstanding that, while always adapting to the historical moment, share some common ethic (Gelles 2000: 12).π I suspect that child circulation has been part of the fabric of Andean lives, both pastoral and agricultural, both rural and urban, for centuries. The notion of the ayllu, the Andean family-based community that has largely faded from scholarly attention (Weismantel 2006), is one basis for imagining a large, ﬂexible network within which children move. Child circulation within the ayllu would be invisible; it is only when communitarian groups begin to falter, fractured through their entrance into the political economy of the colony, the republic, or the contemporary neoliberal state, that such practices become marked. But\n\nM O V I N G C H I L D R E N I N AYA C U C H O\n\na\n\n∑\n\nthey are largely undocumented and can be di≈cult to extract from the historical record. The historical evidence that can be marshaled is spotty. Frank Salomon surmises that native political subunits in the north Andes, under Inca rule, ‘‘were linked by a web of nonhierarchical, symmetrical alliances in which such human transactions as exogamy and child loan paved the way for material transactions and, conceivably, military alliance’’ (1986: 137). The sixteenth-century chronicler Juan de Betanzos wrote that among the Inca, inopportunely born or abandoned children were reimagined as çapçi churikuna or ‘‘sons of the community,’’ raised by women whose children had died and trained to work in the community’s coca ﬁelds (1996 [1551]: 102–3). The historian James Lockhart indicates that during the early colonial period, Spanish women living in Peru were expected to raise mestizo ‘‘orphans’’ whose Spanish fathers, concerned with their own lineages and responsibility to kin, did not want them raised by their Indian mothers (see also Burns 1999: 16). Such children, called criadas or ‘‘raised,’’ were often treated a√ectionately and well, but many were viewed as servants (Lockhart 1968: 185).∫ In eighteenth-century Peru, elite children born under socially disapproved circumstances were similarly labeled ‘‘orphan’’ or ‘‘abandoned’’ as a strategy to avoid public shame, then were integrated into the family (Twinam 1999). Nara Milanich’s impressive archival work locates child circulation in late-nineteenth-century Chile, where elite orphans were raised by relatives, but ‘‘poor children were often nursed, reared, apprenticed, and ‘rented’ for service in the households of others’’ (2004: 313; see also Milanich 2002).Ω No archival smoking gun documents the longevity of child circulation in the Ayacucho region or in Peru more broadly, however, and it remains open for empirical veriﬁcation.\n\nTHE TRAFFIC IN CHILDREN: COMPADRAZGO AS SOCIAL ANALOGY\n\nAn analogous social form found throughout Latin America and Europe, rooted in both precolonial and Catholic morality, is that of compadrazgo, or coparenting.∞≠ Compadrazgo was historically described as ‘‘ﬁctive,’’ rhetorically distinct from ‘‘real’’ kin, but is now understood as a highly signiﬁcant and very real way of growing and fortifying one’s kindred. In compadrazgo,\n\n∏\n\na\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1. Simple diagram of compadrazgo.\n\ntwo families—two houses—are linked through a public commitment and a kind of unbalanced reciprocity. For an illustration, consider the ﬁctional family diagrammed in ﬁgure 1.∞∞ When Ana and Basilio become godparents ( padrino/madrina) to Carlos (their godchild, or ahijado/ahijada), represented by the unidirectional arrow in the diagram, they also become coparents (compadre/comadre) with Carlos’s parents, Domitila and Eduardo, represented by the bidirectional arrow. Certainly, Ana and Basilio should spiritually parent Carlos and provide him with occasional gifts, but the most important ties created in this process are those between the compadres, the adults involved. In an essay entitled ‘‘The Tra≈c in Women,’’ Gayle Rubin, following Lévi-Strauss, brilliantly argued that men who exchange women in marriage are at base creating relationships between the distinct groups of men (1975: 174).∞≤ In compadrazgo, the conduit between two groups—the ‘‘tra≈c’’—is in children.∞≥ In the diagram (ﬁgure 1), Ana, Basilio, Domitila, and Eduardo have entered into kinship with one another. The forms of address they use with each other will change, and so will the material implications of their relationship. An advantage of invoking compadrazgo as a tool for alliance building, over the marriages Rubin and Lévi-Strauss describe, is that compadrazgo is a nonexclusive relationship. Women (except in cases of polygamy) only enter one marriage at a time, limiting marriage as a tool for alliance. Compadrazgo relationships, on the other hand, can be formed on more than one ritual occasion. For example, in Ayacucho, the same couple may baptize a child, cut her hair for the ﬁrst time, sponsor her ﬁrst communion, and stand beside her at her marriage, strengthening their relationship\n\nM O V I N G C H I L D R E N I N AYA C U C H O\n\na\n\nπ\n\nthrough each event. Alternatively, people may choose di√erent godparents for each occasion, broadening their web of relationships. In either case, a kinsperson’s compadres may also be treated as kin (Delgado Sumar 1994), so the tie is not limited to the two adult couples and child. As is typical for foreigners in the region, my partner and I were frequently called upon to become godparents—for ﬁrst communions, middleschool graduations, and other such events—so we became incorporated into these kinship networks as well. On one such occasion, we agreed to baptize two little Ayacuchanas who lived in Lima. Their parents were kin to our compadres in Ayacucho, so it would have been di≈cult to say no—but upon agreeing, our Ayacuchana comadre laughed that we had gotten ourselves into a mess, because the girls are terrors!∞∂ At ﬁrst it was di≈cult for us to grasp why we would be asked to be godparents by near-strangers, since my understanding of compadrazgo emphasized periodic visits and continuing social relations, something that would be hard to engage in across the miles. But we eventually came to realize that to ‘‘take advantage’’ of a foreigner in this way was part of the normal course of godparenting and was not immoral—for who could criticize parents for wanting their child to be connected to a godparent in a foreign land? For the Ayacuchanos we knew, acquiring a foreign godparent actualized the sharp class di√erentials between them and us—but this was a perfectly appropriate strategy. The anthropologists Sidney Mintz and Eric Wolf divided compadrazgo into the horizontal (or between relative equals— e.g., asking a neighbor or cousin to sponsor your marriage) and the vertical (across classes—e.g., the extremely common requests for teachers in small towns to become their pupils’ godparent) (1950). In vertical compadrazgo, the child being godparented facilitates social relationships between adults that would otherwise be impossible (compare Schildkrout 1978). The relationships we entered into would be locally interpreted as uncomplicatedly vertical, owing to our privileged status as foreigners. Although we were often anxious about how little we felt we could provide our growing collection of godchildren, we received a great deal from our various compadres, from irreplaceable local connections to plate after plate of lovingly prepared, steaming food. I saw both vertical and horizontal compadrazgo in Ayacucho, and child circulations could also go either way. Note, though, that compadrazgo (like\n\n∫\n\na\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nchild circulation) is never vertical in the ‘‘other direction’’—the padrinos are always of an equal or higher social status than their new compadres. If they are of a higher social status, the child or parents may perform speciﬁc chores or labors for the padrinos, and the padrinos may give ﬁnancial assistance and social guidance to their ahijado’s family. (These are ‘‘shoulds’’— certainly, not all compadrazgos continue to be meaningful relationships.) But most of all, as Blanca, a teacher with four godchildren herself, informed me, ‘‘I have more family, the family grows, it gets bigger, I now have someone who says to me ‘Comadre, this, that, and the other.’ ’’ For Blanca and the other Ayacuchanos I knew, compadrazgo is a key producer of social life. In a similar way, the ﬂuid movement of a child from one house to another enacts a social relationship between those houses. The movement is not typically memorialized as is compadrazgo, via a church or civil ceremony,∞∑ but the transfer of a child—a socio-geographical transfer rather than an entirely spiritual one—is deeply meaningful nonetheless. Unlike the relations of adoption—where children must be legally severed from their natal families before their incorporation into a new and approved family can take place, in what the sociologist Sara Dorow calls a ‘‘ ‘serial monogamy’ of national/familial kinship’’ (2006: 209)—in child circulation, two families are brought into, or articulated more deeply into, kinship with one another.\n\nTHE ANTHROPOLOGY OF RELATEDNESS\n\nOver the history of anthropology, ‘‘kinship’’ has been a central trope, one of our most valued tools for discerning how small-scale societies are organized. Early anthropologists drew careful lines demarcating biologically determined genealogical kinship (‘‘blood’’) from other kinds of relatedness, which are variously classiﬁed as ‘‘ﬁctive’’ or ‘‘ritual’’ kinships. Similar to early attempts to theoretically distinguish gender (or the cultural di√erences between masculine and feminine) from sex (or the biological di√erences between males and females), kinship studies were grounded in the belief that blood ties are objective di√erence, and social ties are layered, as culture, on top of this biological and factual basis. In the 1970s, anthropologists began to reconnect the parts of culture that these theoretical distinc-\n\nM O V I N G C H I L D R E N I N AYA C U C H O\n\na\n\nΩ\n\ntions had wrenched apart (Carsten 2000: 2), even as the anthropologist David Schneider informed the ﬁeld that ‘‘kinship,’’ far from an objective tool, was in fact nothing but Euro-American ideas about family, blood, sex, and biology dressed up as theory (1984: 154).∞∏ Only in the 1990s did anthropology return to questions of relatedness, or the network of relationships individuals draw on in the course of their daily lives, couched now in terms of choice, reproduction, and political economy. Now we’re interested in how people conceive of their relatedness to one another, what that relatedness is made to do, and how it is embedded in global ideologies of reproduction (Ginsburg and Rapp 1995). There is a tension between kinship as simultaneously ‘‘a theoretical concept and a social category’’ (Franklin and McKinnon 2001: 1), which is a source for creativity in theorizing relatedness. ‘‘Andean kinship’’ is a further narrowing of the category, already done skillfully in two key edited volumes (Bolton and Mayer 1977; Arnold 1997). By drawing attention to the speciﬁcities of Andean kinship, I hold ‘‘kinship’’ in play as both a locally meaningful notion and an analytical category. ‘‘Kinship’’ here means Ayacuchanos’ sense of relatedness as simultaneously given and created, as both unconditional and fallible, and as thoroughly moral. For anthropologists, this book will contribute, above all, to kinship literature. It outlines a sense of becoming kin, over time, that involves the kindling and reinforcing of some interpersonal relationships, and the lessening or divesting of others. The analysis shifts between individuals’ emotions and families’ goals to the involvement of the state and international bodies, most poignantly portrayed in the adoption stories reconstructed here. Adoption is a family-formation method that is familiar to many North American readers.∞π As I write this introduction, celebrity adoptions are splashed across the covers of the magazines at the supermarket checkout. The dramatic stories of the rich and famous—and overwhelmingly white— descending upon countries devastated by war, disease, and poverty underscore, like nothing else, the tight ﬁt between adoption and the political economy. Yet adoption may also be familiar to readers from the lives of their own families or friends. Adoption, both transnational and domestic, is a method for creating the most intimate forms of relatedness, yet it is one that is explicitly framed and structured by global relationships, in particular the political and economic relations between countries and regions.\n\n∞≠\n\na\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nI began this introduction with the legally enshrined narrative of a little girl’s abandonment, and though these archival details are all that are available to us, the ﬁles show that she would go on to be adopted by a couple who waited for her for many months and who welcomed her into their lives with joyful tears. Adoptions from Peru bring children to developed countries in North America and Europe and are carried out with reference both to domestic law and international treaties and conventions. Despite, or perhaps because of, the dynamics of this one-way ﬂow of children, debate over international adoption engages both supporters, who argue that such adoptions help institutionalized and endangered children, and opponents, who interpret the relations produced in terms of colonialism, genocide, and exploitation (Freundlich 2000: 94). The ﬁndings of my ethnographic research in Peru complicate this dichotomy: through an examination of child circulation, the local meanings of institutionalization and the pointed critique of inequalities in adoption are grounded in a sense of this ‘‘sending country’s’’ own historic tensions and debates.\n\nSTRUCTURAL AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE: HISTORIES OF RACE AND CLASS\n\nAbove all, these are debates about the future of Peru. The following chapter goes into more detail on the historic divisions in the country, tensions that can be traced at least back to the Spanish conquest of Peru in the sixteenth century, a colonial period marked by a contest over the cultural legitimacy of Andean beliefs and practices. The struggles that ensued would, under a di√erent form, continue into the early part of the twentieth century in more scientiﬁc, even eugenic guises (Stepan 1991). From extirpation to stirpiculture, the history of Peru can be read as layer upon layer of overt and covert oppression of indigenous people. It’s di≈cult to deﬁne indigeneity in Peru, however, for two principal reasons. First, race and class closely intersect: ‘‘Indians’’ are poor. They have been poor ever since they were colonized by the Spanish, forced to labor on the colonists’ vast land holdings even as they found their own ﬁelds ever shrinking and more marginalized. In 1969 President Velasco o≈cially transformed indios, Indians, into campesinos, peasants—e√ectively sealing the link between indigeneity and mode of production (García 2005: 74). This\n\nM O V I N G C H I L D R E N I N AYA C U C H O\n\na\n\n∞∞\n\nstrategy was meant to counteract historical racism; framing them as a class would call attention to the structural inequalities—Indians’ position visà-vis the land and the national economy—that produced their poverty. Instead, the result was that prejudices and ethnic markers previously related to Indians were transferred to peasants, so that campesino became (and remains) a coded term for an indigenous person. While the state engages in some o≈cial promotion of indigenous cultures (for instance, maintaining traditional dance performances as part of the public school curriculum),∞∫ both urban mestizos and upwardly mobile indigenous youth eschew the campesino/indio subject position. Because it is a position so closely associated with poverty, talk about money and social class often implicates race without discussing it. Following the link between indigeneity and mode of production formalized by Velasco and still retaining an important discursive role for the Peruvians I knew, in these pages I will refer to my interlocutors sometimes as indigenous and sometimes as working class or peasants. More often, however—and still following this deeply ingrained link—I refer to them as poor. Although race is muted, rarely addressed head-on, in the area where I worked, poverty is on everyone’s mind. Although I will go on to interpret child circulation relative both to poverty and to racial mobility, it is worth noting that the Ayacuchanos I spoke with linked it most directly to poverty. In this interpretation, child circulation is partly an e√ort to build the layers of kinship and connectedness necessary to endure the challenges and tensions of growing up poor and indigenous in Peru. Kinship in Ayacucho, for poor and indigenous people immersed in isolation, indi√erence, and the violence of the civil war, was and is in no small part about surviving (Medick and Sabean 1984: 13). A second reason indigeneity is a slippery category is that race and class markers—the visual, auditory, and communicative cues Peruvians use to situate others within everyday hierarchies—are locally deﬁned, relational, evaluated contextually, and changeable over time (Orlove 1998: 202; Romero 2001: 29–30). Phenotypical markers—particular facial features, hair texture, and skin color—are part of this complex, although they cannot easily be read. For example, members of the urban mestizo elite in Ayacucho (huamanguinos) may appear based solely on phenotypical cues to be indigenous, yet are not locally evaluated as such. Within Peru, their perceived\n\n∞≤\n\na\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nindigenous features only take precedence over other class markers in the context of relatively white Lima. By contrast, my interlocutors in Ayacucho were primarily rural-to-urban migrants, although in general they migrated from towns rather than rural villages. Most of them would have been evaluated as campesinos by urban mestizos (though would not have deﬁned themselves in this way), because they bore various locally understood markers of indigeneity. Geographical origin isn’t the only determinative feature here: clothing, language, food, the identiﬁcation of kin, and a host of other criteria are evaluated by interlocutors to determine the social position of another. And in the pages that follow, I will occasionally refer to some of these markers in an e√ort to situate readers in the position of locals evaluating the ethnic position of the person described. Huamanguinos hold all the cards when at home in Ayacucho and are particularly skilled at reading race and class of those around them. One huamanguina friend told me in a conﬁdential manner about how when people come from the chacra, ‘‘which is what we call places like Socos,’’ patience is essential in the face of their ignorance. Her new maid, from the countryside, had—the huamanguina said with kind understanding— urinated into the drain hole in the middle of the bathroom ﬂoor, rather than in the toilet. She had had to clean the ﬂoor together with the maid, instructing her in the ways of middle-class hygiene and actually sitting on the toilet to demonstrate: ‘‘When you are done, call me, and I’ll show you how to make it all disappear’’ (on the interrelations of disgust and ‘‘moral hygienics’’ of the Indian in the city, see Weismantel 2001: 45 passim). Only a few months later, when I met the huamanguina in the marketplace, she told me that the ‘‘chica’’ was no longer with them—slowly folding her ﬁngers into a ﬁst in the signal connotative of thievery and accompanying it with a menacing frown. Such are the subtle violences done in the name of distinction. In a system of vertical compadrazgo such as that described above, the new social relations created are unidirectional rather than reciprocal. So for instance, a resident of a small rural village might turn to a rural-to-urban migrant in his quest for a well-positioned godparent for his child. However, that migrant would be more likely to look to one of her children’s teachers, or a muddling anthropologist—that is, someone she has evaluated as hierarchically superior on the complex race-class continuum. Yet, once again,\n\nM O V I N G C H I L D R E N I N AYA C U C H O\n\na\n\n∞≥\n\nthe ethnic markers taken into consideration when selecting a compadre are not verbalized; these important decisions are never expressed in overt race or class terms. Preferences in compadrazgo or in child circulation are framed as opportunities for the child—a chance to become educated—in an association, between education and class, well documented elsewhere in the Andes (and one which will be taken up in chapters 1 and 5). And in this sense, race is mutable: becoming educated is a chance to divest oneself of some of the features that others could use to ascribe indigeneity. Because these evaluations of race are made reﬂexively, quickly, without verbalization of the process, race is di≈cult to talk about and tricky to deﬁne. There are times when race does appear discursively, however— during rare moments of reﬂection, when intellectuals use the terms in selfidentiﬁcation, or, most frequently, in the context of criticizing others. The president of Peru during my ﬁeldwork was Alejandro Toledo Manrique, a man with perceived indigenous features and a storied childhood as a shoeshine boy who had risen to success via a Stanford advanced degree and a stint at the World Bank. Yet not long after his election victory had been hailed as a key symbolic marker in the incorporation of indigenous people into Peruvian mainstream society, his approval rates bottomed out and citizens disparaged him as an incompetent Indian or cholo.∞Ω In other words, my description of race and class as ‘‘relational,’’ above, is materialized when a relationship like that between the people and their president is expressed, negatively, in racial terms. Pejorative references to race do many things, but one of their most insidious e√ects is the concretization of the idea that opportunity and success are linked to not being indigenous. The other side of this coin is that social mobility≤≠ partly depends upon sloughing o√ the ethnic markers described above, the markers that others can use to place someone as Indian. María Elena García has argued that shedding the Quechua language is seen in this way, which is one reason that rural parents reject bilingual education programs that are intended to empower (García 2005). During my time in Ayacucho, I learned that child circulation often engages ideas about social mobility. When a child relocates to a more centrally located home where porcelain toilets are used and only Spanish is spoken, she has made a contextual move toward securing opportunity and, necessarily, divesting herself of certain claims to indigeneity.\n\nMap 1. Peru. Cartography by Douglas Fast, University of Manitoba, 2007.\n\nM O V I N G C H I L D R E N I N AYA C U C H O\n\na\n\n∞∑\n\nA NOTE ON METHODS\n\nI ﬁrst ﬂew into Ayacucho’s small airport on a preliminary ﬁeld trip in the summer of 2000. Generous funding meant I could live for nearly two years in Peru, from September 2001 to July 2003, with follow-up visits in the summers of 2004 and 2006. Though I spent some time visiting small towns, and a few months in Lima, the city of Ayacucho is my ethnographic home away from home. It boasts a famously beautiful colonial center, more than thirty-three churches admired by all during Holy Week, a friendly small-town feel, and an ever-expanding edge of outlying neighborhoods. Ayacucho is large—125,000 and growing—and is connected to other cities and towns near and far by a complex network of buses, an increasing number of paved roads, and the wires linking Telefónica’s green-and-blue boxed phones and dozens of Internet cafés. I spent most of my time in Ayacucho, but I also accompanied friends back to their villages and to Lima (see maps 1 and 2) and met their family members and village-mates who had remained behind or migrated ahead. I use these spatial metaphors intentionally—migration is concretely visualized as an evolutionary trajectory out of one’s village and into the most advanced land of opportunity available, whether it be the city of Ayacucho, Peru’s capital, or some faraway land. The rural-to-increasingly-urban migrants I spoke with were a ‘‘population’’ in social scientiﬁc terms, not because they all came from the same town or moved to the same city, but because they shared a relationship to jam-packed minivans rattling down dirt roads, and to hasty changes from urban jeans-jacket to old sweater suitable for rural tasks and back again. My ﬁeldwork methods closely mirrored local methods of communication and interaction, a happy coincidence that made the research a pleasure to carry out and, more importantly, meant that I was able to access everyday kinship practices in a locally understandable and ‘‘natural’’ fashion. For example, I met ‘‘subjects’’ through what network scholars call ‘‘snowball sampling’’ and what my interlocutors saw as introducing one friend to another. And the ethnographic method par excellence, participant-observation (analytically, watching while doing—sharing activities, but taking mental notes at the same time), was extremely e√ective for informally attending to the quiet realities of family making. Out of these\n\n∞∏\n\na\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMap 2. Ayacucho and its environs. Cartography by Douglas Fast, University of Manitoba, 2007.\n\ninitial and long-term ruminations, I eventually produced interviews and surveys, seeking individuals’ interpretations of their life courses to back up my own impressions. Recorded interviews usually took place at my apartment, but everyday conversations might happen anywhere, from sunny rural cornﬁelds to the roof of an unﬁnished brick house in a Lima shantytown, while my interlocutor ground bright red peppers or insisted I eat cold corn kernels with white cheese or shooed a guinea pig away from my feet. As other ethnographers have pointed out, the Andean region is very much divided by gender, and it was simpler (and made more sense to my informants) for me to speak primarily to women. The vast majority of my interlocutors were also young: with some exceptions, they were almost all in their early teens to their mid-twenties, by which point some had had children of their own. Meanwhile, twenty-ﬁve when I came to Peru and\n\nM O V I N G C H I L D R E N I N AYA C U C H O\n\na\n\n∞π\n\ntwenty-seven when I left, I was of an age that, had I been a rural migrant to Ayacucho, I might well have had children already. My childlessness was particularly inexplicable to many acquaintances because, in Ayacucho, I lived with my partner, an ethnomusicologist researching local music. For many Andeans, childlessness sparks pity; as a foreigner, my childlessness was somehow less painful for others, since I was already recognized as anomalous. A serious explanation for my childlessness—a desire to get established and become ﬁnancially secure ﬁrst—resonated strongly with many of the young women I spoke with, who also hoped to ﬁnish their studies before reproducing. But with older interlocutors I adopted a more humorous tack. After the ﬁrst few interrogations, I quickly learned to present my body in agricultural and pastoral terms. ‘‘My ‘ﬁeld’ is no good,’’ I would say, ‘‘my guinea pigs don’t reproduce, my cow doesn’t give milk.’’ And out of a blend of pity and longing, I received my share of o√ers—some joking, some seemingly serious—of other peoples’ children. I ended up accepting exactly nine of these o√ers—not, of course, of children to take home as my own, but of godchildren. My ﬁeldworking relationship with almost everyone who graces these pages was one of friendship. Throughout, I often refer to my interlocutors as friends. Some were close conﬁdants with whom I shared laughter, tears, and dozens if not hundreds of plates of food. Some became relatives through compadrazgo. I still e-mail, telephone, send money, and visit, and I miss them all. Anxious about misrepresenting them or compromising them, I have used pseudonyms for everyone except institutional representatives. More seasoned anthropologists of the Andes have set a powerful example by rejecting the protective use of pseudonyms as patronizing—for example, Linda Seligmann’s writings on Peruvian market women express her deep desire to make readers understand that her interlocutors are real and ‘‘we live in the same world’’ (2004: 11). Although I, too, share this tendency, my reluctance to expose my friends to any sort of harm outweighs it.\n\nORGANIZATION OF THE BOOK\n\nThe book can be read in two halves, each composing one broad stroke explaining the phenomenon of child circulation in the Ayacucho region. The ﬁrst part is made up of chapters 1–3; it inserts child circulation into\n\n∞∫\n\na\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ndi√erent globalized histories, from a Peruvian history of racial conﬂict and violence in chapter 1 to an international story about children’s rights, adoption, and orphans in chapters 2 and 3. In chapter 1, I sketch out the ‘‘ethnographic setting,’’ the place under study, beginning with a wide-angle lens for a tour through Peruvian history, and narrowing to explain Ayacucho, both region and city, and how it evokes painful memories and stories of discrimination. In foregrounding the adoption process in chapter 2, I want to engage readers who are familiar with adoption from their own lives, friends, or common knowledge. Chapter 2 takes up not only the adoption process, and the complicated ways that parent and child are mutually produced for one another, but also some of the critiques—such as that of a Peruvian anti-child-tra≈cking ngo, itself also supported by funding and theory from the developed world. Coupled with the third chapter’s description of the workings of local orphanages, chapter 2 shows how familiar understandings of how families are formed in the First World leave many angles of children’s stories unconsidered. Finally, the idea of ‘‘orphan’’— wakcha, an Andeanist keyword—is, in chapter 3, shown to be a complicated placeholder that traces a long history and a social deﬁnition of solitude. The orphanages in Ayacucho demonstrate that ‘‘orphans,’’ just as in many parts of the world today, rarely have deceased parents but instead are the products of poverty, bureaucracy, and a decathecting of social relations. The second half of the book consists of chapters 4–6, which hold ﬁnegrained ethnography, detailed descriptions, and interpretations of the individual histories that intersect with the global narratives described in the book’s ﬁrst part. Each chapter takes up a keyword or two, a concept which I retain in the original Spanish and which I use to explore di√erent angles on child circulation. Thus, in chapter 4, I approach child circulation from the receiving adult’s point of view, showing how companionship (compañía) wards o√ a deeply feared solitude. I also address some of the tensions produced as relationships of child circulation begin: the economics of it, and the slowness of getting accustomed (acostumbrando) to a new life and a new positionality. The kinwork described in chapter 4 can be read against the prospective adopters’ narratives of their desire for children, recounted in chapter 2, as well as against the unidirectionality of the orphanage, which in chapter 3 is described as nonreciprocal and therefore almost amoral. Next is chapter 5, which deals with the notion of superarse, a self-overcoming that\n\nM O V I N G C H I L D R E N I N AYA C U C H O\n\na\n\n∞Ω\n\nshould be read in conjunction with a sense of the poverty and structural violence described in chapter 1, and the race relations sketched out above. It is a theme that animates young people’s (and their natal families’) narrations of their own circulation. Finally, chapter 6 considers Ayacuchanos’ interpretations of identity and belonging, pertenecer, based on paired assessments of documentation (or knowledge) and emotion. Tugging at themes already introduced in the explanation of abandonment proceedings in chapter 2, this chapter explores how Ayacuchanos know who they are, and where they ﬁt into di√erent social fabrics. The book concludes with a short essay—chapter 7—that weaves together these disparate threads: violence and postwar poverty (chapter 1); the system of adoptions and orphanages and the specters of child tra≈c and labor (chapters 2 and 3); and Ayacuchano practices of child circulation, expressed through local theories about the production of relatedness, selfimprovement, and their articulations with the Peruvian state (chapters 4, 5, and 6). I tell two parallel stories throughout the book and return to them both in the conclusion. One is about child circulation as a meaningful social practice for the poor and indigenous both in Ayacucho and more widely in the Andes. Children’s mobility is a strategy, though one not without its tensions and ambivalences, and the transfer of children achieves real and important social ends for everyone concerned. The other story is about the ways in which the state, ngos, and the international arena critique and intervene in the practices I am calling ‘‘child circulation.’’ In the ﬁrst story, child circulation is a way for receiving households to recruit labor, for sending households to negotiate the economic pressures of childrearing, and for young people to contribute to family goals and to mediate, forging dense and valued connections, between social groups. Child circulations occur within and help to shape the Peruvian political economy: bu√eted by violence, aggressively globalizing, criss-crossed by migrants, overlaid with a wash of social connections meant to be drawn on in both good times and bad. The stories of individual children and their movements trace the broader history of the recent civil war, the interpersonal a√ections that tug at young people as they undertake new lives, the tensions of parental expectations, and the larger narratives of socioeconomic, racial, and geographic progress.\n\n≤≠\n\na\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nRunning parallel to this ethnography is a second story, one in which the Peruvian state ignores, tolerates, or condemns child circulation. The history of race and class relations in the Andes, recounted above, makes the state’s underlying motivation very clear. Child circulation is a practice endemic to Andean households—in this, it is one of the markers signaling ‘‘poor Indians.’’ This is true even though child circulation binds together the rural indigenous poor and their urban kin or social patrons, and even though (or especially because) child circulation is perceived as a strategy to emerge out of the Indianness of poverty. In other words, child circulation is associated with the kind of people that the state has routinely mocked, despised, or slaughtered, most appallingly in its response to the Shining Path uprising. The kinship I take up in this book has been irrevocably colored by the material presented in the following chapter: Ayacucho’s colonialist history, its economic isolation, and most recently its central role in the devastating civil war.\n\nOne. AYACUCHO: HISTORIES OF VIOLENCE AND ETHNOGRAPHY\n\na\n\nLupe came over to my house for her interview with her husband and young son in tow. I served them the strange kinds of foods I liked to eat on a daily basis and they liked to sample out of morbid curiosity—this lunch included bruschetta and potato soup with dumplings. Afterward, we parked her husband in front of the vcr with a video I’d made of a ﬁesta in Lupe’s father’s hometown, and she brought her little son into the kitchen with me. He got on her lap and promptly fell asleep, as I switched on the recorder and Lupe began to tell me her life story. She described the di√erent relatives she’d lived with after her mother died when she was only a toddler: how she had felt in each home, the relationships and events that she remembered. One typical reminiscence went like this: My aunt . . . hadn’t yet ﬁnished high school, so she began to study high school, but at night, at nighttime. Sometimes I went with her, and sometimes I stayed alone in the house. During those times I cried—well, I was alone in the house, and it was dark, you know? It was scary, those were scary times, it was the time of danger, there were blackouts, there was no electricity, all that, and I stayed there crying by myself, I locked myself in my room and cried there, alone, missing my mother.∞\n\n≤≤\n\na\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nOther people whose stories I recorded mentioned this ‘‘time of danger,’’ the tiempo de peligro, in a similar way: a backdrop to a story, a few words to evoke a past time, a hastily sketched reminder—Lupe’s ‘‘all that’’—of a shared historical period. By the time I ﬁrst traveled to Ayacucho in 1999, the blackouts and fear Lupe speaks of here had largely come to an end. And so I experienced my interlocutors’ memories of Ayacucho’s recent history only inasmuch as they wanted to share.≤ Though many people shared stories and testimonies with me almost urgently, others declined politely, and still others criticized the whole process of remembering and discussing it at all (Theidon 2004). And now, sorting through my jotted impressions, notes, and transcripts, I am reluctant to leave anything out, worried that to do so will be to diminish my friends’ su√ering and struggles. Sure that I won’t be able to do their experiences justice, I can at least begin at the beginning.\n\nA BRIEF HISTORY OF VIOLENCE\n\n‘‘When exactly did Peru screw itself ?’’ a character asks in the Peruvian author and presidential also-ran Mario Vargas Llosa’s well-known book Conversation in the Cathedral (1975 [1969]: 3). Many have tried to compose a satisfactory answer, beginning with Vargas Llosa, who has another character conclude, ‘‘This country got o√ to a bad start and it’s going to end up bad’’ (140). The claim refers to the deﬁning event in Peruvian history: an unequal meeting of indigenous South Americans and conquering Spanish. In public school, my friends learned that Peru once comprised all of Inca territory, and that every country carved from it was a robbery. Think how di√erent Peru would be if the Spanish hadn’t come, I was told: ‘‘much richer, and much bigger!’’ Thus Peru’s poverty is historicized and politicized, imported back into a past everyone can share. As Vargas Llosa suggests, the violence of that original encounter has also colored subsequent Peruvian history, which is marked by a series of bloody conﬂicts periodizing class and ethnic tensions. The Taki Unquy (singing sickness) movement, which began in 1560, revived pre-Inca gods and promoted pan-Andean solidarity in a critique of Spanish colonialism (Salomon 1999: 33). But in a recurring theme of Peruvian history, continuing ethnic fragmentation eventually defeated the movement, aided here by Viceroy Toledo’s ‘‘reductions’’ of the natives via consolidation into Spanish-style\n\nAYA C U C H O\n\na\n\n≤≥\n\nvillages (Stern 1982). José Gabriel Condorcanqui ‘‘Tupac Amaru’’ ’s 1781 rebellion against oppressive Spanish rule also failed due to in-group tensions (Walker 1999) but did nothing to allay elite fears about Indian uprisings. Unruly natives had to be kept down, and racism became one of the cornerstones of nationalism and of postcolonial governmentality. Peru attained what Peter Klarén refers to as a ‘‘reluctant independence’’ (2000: 99) in 1824. The internal conﬂicts that characterized failed rebellions during the colonial period were reproduced in the 1824 Battle of Ayacucho, where Peru’s future citizens contested its independence on a plain outside the city of Huamanga (Walker 1999: 85, 107). In honor of this event, Ayacucho gained its postindependence moniker, shedding the colonial name Huamanga. (Today, locals use both city names interchangeably, as well as Ayacucho to refer to the department and Huamanga for the province. As I mentioned in the previous chapter, elite families of long standing in Ayacucho are still called huamanguinos.) Centralism prevailed over other possibilities (Walker 1999: 86–88, 106–8; Mendez G. 1993), producing a Peru where Indians continued to be separated from white elites. Relations of inequality were foregrounded once more in Peru’s cataclysmic participation in the War of the Paciﬁc (1879–83), which continues to resonate in the Peruvian national imaginary. The Peruvian upper classes ultimately sided with Chile precisely because they feared the loss of their property, to mobilized peasant masses, more than they feared the loss of national territory to Chile.≥ Throughout this history a particular formulation of ‘‘the Peruvian nation’’ emerged, based in Lima: an exclusively criollo nation which monopolizes commerce and politics, even as it attempts to maintain indigenous peoples as a distinct and separate class. Whether Indians are portrayed as passive victims of state violence or as dangerous threats to the established order, they are painted as ‘‘a world apart, excluded from the nation, beyond the frontiers of the civilized’’ (Flores Galindo 1988: 301). This pervasive racism has excluded Indians from attaining full citizenship and inhibited the articulation of alternate senses of ‘‘Peruvian-ness.’’ The reiﬁed and incommensurable Indian/elite ethnic division, sharply drawn in early nation-building projects, continues to persist through discourses of geography (highlands/coast—see map 1), language (Quechua/ Spanish), and culture (tradition/modernity, or Andean/criollo). This divi-\n\n≤∂\n\na\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nsion is patently false on some levels—witness the ethnic, linguistic, and cultural heterogeneity reﬂected in the internal conﬂicts that tore apart resistance movements in the colonial period—but so much is rooted in it that it carries the weight of reality. Enrique Mayer (1992; see also de la Cadena 2000: 314) has pointed out that the homogenized and undi√erentiated image of Indians is so di≈cult to contest because it is so widely accepted by opposing sectors of society, from the elite intellectual Mario Vargas Llosa (1983) to leftist revolutionaries of the Shining Path (Seligmann 1995: 9). The poverty of Andean Peru and the appalling levels of discrimination against indigenous Andeans are not recent phenomena; nor is it particularly surprising that this intense inequality bubbles over into horriﬁc and periodic violence.\n\nRINCÓN DE LOS MUERTOS: AYACUCHO IN THE PERUVIAN IMAGINARY\n\nEvery time I returned to Ayacucho, whether from a short visit to Lima or a longer stay with family in the United States, my bags were bursting with delicacies and amenities unavailable in the highlands. On the nine-hour bus trip, usually endured overnight, this was not usually an issue, but on the small planes that traversed the Andes a few days a week, extra fees were often required to compensate for the weight of my culinary indulgences. So I was especially glad to meet Rubén as we both waited in line at Lima’s airport to check in for a ﬂight to Ayacucho, when he kindly o√ered to share his weight limit with me. Rubén introduced himself as an employee of the Ministry of the Interior in Lima, carrying only a small bag as he was coming for a day-long meeting. On the plane, as we ﬂew over thirsty brown ﬁelds, he asked about my research. When I described my questions about child circulation practices and kinship strategies, he shook his head critically, arguing that my ethnographic contribution would be severely skewed—artiﬁcially misrepresenting the child circulation practices both quantitatively and qualitatively— simply because of my choice to work in the Ayacucho region. Rubén was referring to two decades of Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso) insurrection, violent military reprisals, and human rights abuses that\n\nAYA C U C H O\n\na\n\n≤∑\n\nrocked Peru from the poorest highland communities to wealthy Lima suburbs. This period of danger and fear is what many Peruvians think of when Ayacucho is mentioned. The region’s name is often translated from the Quechua as rincón de los muertos or corner of the dead (aya means corpse, kuchu is corner): a true descriptor during the 1980s and into the 1990s as Ayacucho came to signify terrorism, violence, and death. A character in the Peruvian author Santiago Roncagliolo’s novel Abril rojo remarks of Ayacucho—remembering the warlike Chancas, the indigenous rebellions, the independence won on its soil and the still-fresh pain of Shining Path—‘‘This place is condemned to be forever soaked in blood and ﬁre’’ (2006: 245).∂ The Shining Path movement began in Ayacucho. It was born and raised inside Huamanga’s Marxist-identiﬁed public university, and led by the Maoist philosophy professor Abimael Guzmán,∑ who held a great deal of power within the university itself (Degregori 1997: 42, 48). Politically engaged students soon ventured into the countryside as teachers to convert rural youth to the revolution’s aims.∏ Shining Path announced itself during the night of May 17, 1980. Disdainful of the newly recovered electoral system and of the state itself, armed insurgents burned the ballot boxes in Chuschi, a small town in central Ayacucho, and in so doing declared war upon a nation that barely noticed this ﬁrst foray. The movement grew rapidly, but although the war would spread throughout the country, the Ayacucho region bore the brunt of it. Seventy thousand Peruvians were killed or forcibly disappeared during the twenty years of violent political conﬂict between counterinsurgency forces and Shining Path, and a full one-third of them were from the department of Ayacucho (CVR 2003: Annex 2, 19).π The poor and indigenous su√ered disproportionately; 75 percent of victims spoke Quechua as their ﬁrst language (CVR 2003: 13). The e√ects on the poor are painfully ironic, given that Shining Path ostensibly intended to alleviate a sharply unequal distribution of wealth (Degregori 1997: 34). Instead, the war exacerbated poverty in a region that has long been one of the poorest areas of the country. One important e√ect of the violence was to increase migration out of the area (Skar 1994: 86); over 150,000 people in the Ayacucho region were displaced, moving from countryside to city, or from Ayacucho to Lima\n\n≤∏\n\na\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n(Revollar Añaños 2001: 18). Many thousands of children were orphaned during those years.∫ The worst of the violence came to a close in the mid-1990s, after Alberto Fujimori was elected president and imposed a draconian series of policies diminishing civil rights. Guzmán was captured on Fujimori’s watch, and the movement lost much of its inﬂuence. The e√ects of the violence— displacement, devastating loss, poverty—still linger throughout Peru and beyond, and strains of Shining Path are still present in Ayacucho’s jungles today, having allied with the drug trade. Enrique Mayer, in contrast to Vargas Llosa’s stark statement, states, ‘‘I do not think that it is necessary to go back hundreds of years to ﬁnd out when Peru screwed itself . . . Peru’s inability to understand the Sendero Luminoso uprising and its inability to deal with Sendero Luminoso in realistic terms are at the heart’’ of the persistence of Peru’s problems (1992: 207). That is, the Peruvian state, centered in coastal o≈ces and ministries,Ω continues, to a large degree, to maintain a willful ignorance of Andean society as indigenous and irrelevant. And when a place like Ayacucho does come to the attention of the Limeño elite, it is often disparaged as backward and bloodsoaked. One young woman with whom I spoke remembers, as a child, hearing then-president Alán Garcia say on television that the best way to ﬁght terrorism would be to blow up Ayacucho. In his critique, I understood Rubén to mean that the massive killings and migrations of the 1980s and early 1990s would have left thousands of Ayacuchano children orphaned, and families less able to pull together and care for them. Thus, by the ideals of objectivity and proper sampling strategies, both of which tend to be foregrounded in much of Peruvian social science, my research design was inherently ﬂawed. Certainly, he was correct that the violence of the last two decades of the twentieth century a√ected the ways in which the kinship strategies under study could be used. But the history recounted here suggests that this was not the ﬁrst time or place that child circulation practices have been adjusted to Peruvian sociopolitical realities. I chose to work in Ayacucho because I thought that a study of the interaction of historical and political processes with practices of kinship and social relations was essential for understanding the broad and overarching e√ects the war had on Peruvian lives.∞≠\n\nAYA C U C H O\n\na\n\n≤π\n\nSOCOS, PROVINCE OF HUAMANGA, DEPARTMENT OF AYACUCHO\n\nThe horrors of the civil war devastated families and entire communities, and though several years have passed the memories persist in stories that are told and retold by survivors and their interlocutors. I especially saw this process of blending, shifting, altering stories in the community of Socos, less than one hour outside the city of Ayacucho. Unlike many communities in Ayacucho, Socos was never eradicated, so it never had to go through the politicized process of repopulation and return. But like many other towns in the region, it is a community marked by the experience of a massacre. While doing preliminary ﬁeldwork in Ayacucho in 2000, I met Madre Covadonga, a Spanish nun who has spent the better part of her life in Peru, and whose compassion during the violence is the stu√ of local legend. I asked her about whether orphans were taken in by others during the violence, and she replied with the inspiring description of Socos, a community that had refused to parcel out its orphans and instead chose to raise them in the community. The story of the events that turned many Soqueños into orphans was ﬁctionalized by the ﬁlmmaker Francisco Lombardi in his Boca del Lobo (1990), and it is also recounted in the documentary State of Fear, accompanied by the photographer Vera Lentz’s images of the aftermath (Onís 2005). The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Comisión de la Verdad y Reconciliación [CVR]) paid a visit to Socos in 2003 (see ﬁgure 2), and its ﬁndings, based on interviews with the victims’ families, are recounted in the ﬁnal report (CVR 2003, vol. 7, 2.1: 53–63). In the years to come I would hear this story several times, both from adult community members and from their children who were too young to remember. It came up on one occasion in March 2003, when after a delicious lunch of semolina soup, puca picante (potatoes in a peanut-beet sauce), and mote (boiled corn kernels), conversation turned from upcoming travels to the war in Iraq. My college-aged friend Sarita commented that she wouldn’t have believed people could kill other people until she saw it for herself, ‘‘en Sendero, en terrorismo.’’ Turning to her mother, who was clearing the table wearing a comfortable green skirt and plastic ﬂip-ﬂops, she invited her, being antigua, to tell the stories. Her mother obliged, taking\n\n≤∫\n\na\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n2. Truth Commission worker with victims’ families at massacre site, 2002.\n\na seat at the wooden table and recounting a story that by then I’d heard a few times over. Love was in the air in a purportedly ‘‘red’’ neighborhood in Socos. A man and woman had run o√ together, and her parents wanted him to make things o≈cial. This meant a yaykupakuy ceremony, which would culminate in the young man traveling to her house and publicly asking her parents for her hand, in the traditional way. In November of 1983, the groom asked permission at the police post to hold this wedding-related event one night, and the whole neighborhood turned out to celebrate. Late that night, after most people had gone home, the police suddenly arrived, wearing masks. Perhaps they had originally forbidden the party as too dangerous, or perhaps the drunken partygoers began to criticize them in Quechua (a language they did not understand) for abusive police behavior typical of the era. The police forced the attendees to walk down into a crevasse by a stream (ﬁgure 2), perhaps ten or ﬁfteen minutes away from the center of town, and shot them—old people and babies alike, entire families. Community members might not have ever known what happened to their relatives, except for the seemingly miraculous survival of one old woman, who is no longer living today. She fell into a hole and wasn’t shot;\n\nAYA C U C H O\n\na\n\n≤Ω\n\nhours later she dared to come back to town and denounce the police. What happened next varies depending on who is telling the story. Some say that police, disguised as Shining Path, took part in further killings—of insistent relatives demanding to know the fate of their loved ones, or of possible witnesses—‘‘so that they could erase what they had done.’’ Others mention the arrival of a kind of Truth Commission, to whom no one spoke out of fear of police reprisal. Not until the early 1990s, after nearly ten years of police abuse, would the community create a ronda or self-defense committee. In the meantime, those who could moved or sent their children to Ayacucho, fearing death. Community members also took in the numerous orphaned children, who are all now grown: in a small agricultural community where children represent current and future laborers, the possibility of losing them to orphanages or adoptions went unconsidered. But for every uplifting outcome like that which occurred in the community of Socos, there were also many instances of children being scattered to the winds.\n\nIN MEMORY: JOSEFA\n\nIn the stories I heard, memories are inscribed on the landscape. A town plaza became the setting of the torture and killing of teachers and town authorities, whose wakes townspeople did not attend out of fear of reprisal. A path between ﬁelds became the site of an accidental meeting with a terrorist column, which, uninterested, marched on by. Animal corrals or caves became hiding places where parents stashed their children when escaping from insurgents or military. Houses or entire towns became just memories, as people were uprooted from homes and families, having to leave suddenly in the middle of the night or after a threat. And some people’s memories of home are colored by the recollection of clinging ine√ectively to a mother’s skirts when soldiers arrived, so that no one would take her away. Flora, a slim and well-dressed secretary in her late twenties, became one of my closest friends during my time in Peru. I read her story before she told it to me; she had been encouraged by her employer to submit a typed testimonial in memorandum form to the Truth Commission. Later, I would interview both Flora and her younger sister, the protagonists\n\n≥≠\n\na\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nof this narrative. Finally, bits of the story came up in conversations, as Flora and her siblings would refer back to the events of this day to explain parts of their personality, reasons for decisions made later in life, and feelings toward members of their extended family who didn’t behave as they should have. Flora was ten years old on the summer night in 1984 when a soldier came to her house, a cozy set of adobe rooms in another ‘‘red’’ town less than a day’s journey from the city of Huamanga. Her mother, Josefa, was a widow whose husband had died of alcohol poisoning a year before, leaving her with four small children: Flora and her sister Tania, aged ten and seven, and their two little brothers, aged ﬁve and three. Josefa was known throughout the small district capital as an excellent cook, and in previous months she had cooked for both insurgents and military personnel. The soldier politely asked her to come and cook for the captain’s birthday, but when she turned distractedly to look for her apron, he told her she wouldn’t need it. She disappeared into the night, and did not return to her adobe house. Flora, Josefa’s eldest daughter, went to the barracks to ask after her mother. There, she was told that Josefa was in jail. Though this concerned them, the children were mainly relieved to hear she wasn’t dead. But the next day, townspeople observed the soldiers digging a hole inside the barracks. When Josefa’s children asked about it, they were told it was for a bathroom. Their dog, who loved Josefa dearly, lingered by the barracks until the soldiers shot him dead. Flora cried bitterly over her dog’s corpse, but soon after this, when they were ﬁnally told that their mother had been killed, she found herself unable to cry. The soldiers refused to let the children see Josefa’s body, saying it would traumatize them, so an aunt went to identify her instead. On her return, their aunt reported that sixteen people had been tortured and killed that night, and that pieces of Josefa’s skin had been removed in the torture. The aftermath of this devastating story, with whom the children stayed and what happened to them upon their orphaning, told much about how painstakingly constructed social networks became more fragile in wartime. Their mother’s compadres, who had promised to care for her children if anything were to happen to her, now refused. Four days after Josefa’s murder was revealed, the children’s grandmother came to care for them for a time, but she was too elderly to bear this responsibility for long and so she\n\nAYA C U C H O\n\na\n\n≥∞\n\neventually dispersed them among their older half-siblings. Each of the four has his or her own tale of the di≈cult days that lasted until the orphanage opened and they became part of its ﬁrst cohort. Josefa’s four children are kind, generous, happy people today, but they have had to pass through di≈cult times in their struggles to stay together as a group. Periodically, fear, worry, or grief caused them and several others of my friends to weep openly. Tales of anorexia, abuse, and ongoing fear were couched in relation to these traumatic experiences and memories. The word trauma was adopted in the postwar vocabulary as a previously unavailable way to index such events without even having to give details, and people who have lived through these years often frame themselves as traumatized. The fear, trauma, and su√ering caused by the internal warfare were ever-present in Ayacucho’s landscape and the memories and conversations of people I met.\n\nAYACUCHO AS ANTHROPOLOGICAL SITE\n\nUnhappy histories like these have become the source material for an inﬂux of foreign scholars like myself, each investigating various angles of Ayacuchano postwar existence. During the war, however, much of Peru was considered too dangerous for foreigners to conduct ﬁeldwork. Fortunately, Peruvian scholars (e.g., Degregori [1997]; del Pino H. [1998]) and journalists (e.g., Gorriti [1999/1990]) produced a strong body of literature denominated ‘‘Senderology’’ at this time, presenting their perspectives on the violence. As Steve Stern has written, the sheer impact of Sendero forced scholars of the Andes to rethink their teleological historical approaches in an atmosphere of constant surprise and wonder (1998). The disarray of the Ayacucho region also became symbolic of a disconnect between foreign social science and Andean realities. Holding up Billie Jean Isbell’s ethnography of Chuschi (1978) as an example of work framed around an American anthropological paradigm of social maintenance, the anthropologist Orin Starn argued that ‘‘residues of paternalism and hierarchy persist in Andeanist discourse’’ (1992: 156). Starn’s critical portrayal emerged from the general crisis of representation in anthropology and called for depictions of Andeans to become more complicated and sensitive to change. More recent scholarship takes a more measured position, such as\n\n≥≤\n\na\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nPaul Gelles’s political assertion that relegating romanticizable parts of Andean culture to the margins is indefensible (2000: 12). Prior to the violence, the Ayacuchano setting was never an especially prominent scholarly topic, by comparison with the Inca capital of Cuzco, which occupies much of Peru’s intellectual landscape. The colonial-era e√orts of Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala, the indigenous artist and chronicler who called the region home, and the lyrical folkloric/ethnographic/ novelistic/memoiristic work of the twentieth-century writer José María Arguedas are two notable sources of information about Ayacucho. But between them, there was little scholarly attention to this isolated and famously mestizo city, or its indigenous countryside. As Arguedas wrote in one ethnographic essay, Ayacucho is a very di√erent site from those cities that produced the Peruvian indigenismo movement of the early twentieth century: huamangino architecture and dress ‘‘transmits the living sensation of how the Hispanic stamped its seal on Indian culture . . . with a capacity to convert that was much greater than in other highland cities of Peru’’ (1981 [1975]: 157).∞∞ If readers familiar with race relations elsewhere in the Andes ﬁnd my portrayal of them in Ayacucho unfamiliar, it is likely because this city is deﬁned both by its residents and by outsiders as peculiarly ‘‘Hispanic.’’ It was not until the much-heralded 1959 reopening of Ayacucho’s Universidad Nacional San Cristóbal de Huamanga (unsch), which had closed during the War of the Paciﬁc (1879–83), that social scientists, both local and foreign, would return to the region in force. By the 1970s, foreign graduate students like Billie Jean Isbell, John Earls, and David Scott Palmer worked alongside local scholars like Ulpiano Quispe and Salvador Palomino in the Ayacucho region. This expansive ethnological moment coincided with the Velasco land reform and e√orts to integrate indigenous communities in Peru, events which created a demand for anthropological work on indigenous peoples (Salomon 1982). A central aim of Andean studies during the 1970s was to locate similarities throughout the region and elucidate a sort of Andean culture complex, lo andino, including traits shared with their Inca and pre-Inca ancestors, focusing mainly on ecology and social organization. Scholars at Ayacucho’s university also met this demand, with more overtly politically engaged and critical work (see especially Díaz Martínez 1969) rooted in the structural, socioeconomic inequalities they saw on an every-\n\nAYA C U C H O\n\na\n\n≥≥\n\nday basis (Orlove response in Osterling and Martinez 1983: 353). Several of these Ayacuchano researchers would go on to play key roles in Sendero, which was ﬁnding its feet during this period.\n\nCOMING TO TERMS\n\nIn postviolence Ayacucho, the work of local social scientists can still be categorized broadly as either problem-focused (emphasizing the developmental and applied aspects, a choice which reﬂects both the kind of work available for anthropologists in Peru, as well as the kind of projects that can be funded locally) or community-based (as are many of the anthropology theses that come out of the university). Arce Castro’s work on youth gangs (n.d.: 68–71, which lists eighty-three gangs in the city) exempliﬁes the problem-focused ethnography. Though the gang activity seemed minimal to me (in comparison with that present in North American cities), Ayacuchanos perceived it as a real threat, and many of them connected it directly to the years of violence, convinced that gang members were orphaned by the war.∞≤ But the researcher Cordula Strocka has conducted ﬁeld research with youth gangs in Ayacucho and found no direct connection between violent family disruption and gang membership—the links between the war and contemporary gangs are indirect ones, in that the violence exacerbated poverty and ﬁlled the city with migrants, increasing unemployment and, she argues, blocking a transition to adult status that is possible mainly through wage labor (2006). Research on gangs and other perceived echoes of the war is one way in which Ayacuchanos are coming to terms with their recent and tragic past. During the period of my ﬁeldwork, at the turn of the twenty-ﬁrst century, I witnessed several other ways that Peruvians are coming to terms with the years of violence. This happens poignantly through artistic expressions of every stripe, from the provocative wood-and-plaster retablos that chart the events of the violence (Toledo Brückmann 2003), to the sometimes daring lyrics of Ayacuchano protest music (Tucker 2005; Ritter 2002), to the stunning photography exhibited in Lima’s Riva Agüero house in 2004 (Forero 2004), to the cinematic e√orts of the local ﬁlmmaker Palito Ortega Matute (2006, 2000, 1997) and his peers. But the most notable project of coming to terms is that carried out by\n\n≥∂\n\na\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nthe Truth Commission, established in 2001 during the transition presidency of Valentín Paniagua. The Commission takes an almost postmodern approach, seeking the moral or practical truth about the events of 1980–2000, situated in science, narrative, and intentionality (CVR 2003: 32). Between 2001 and 2003, a period coinciding with my ﬁeldwork, the Commission held public audiences, collected the testimonies of survivors, and raised awareness through educating students in the classroom. It also sponsored public events, such as a free Concert for Memory, featuring performers whose works chronicle the social upheaval of those years, and an open-air allegorical performance by the Lima-based theatrical troupe Yuyachkani, both of which I saw in Ayacucho’s central plaza. The ﬁndings of the Commission are brought to life in the stunning documentary State of Fear (Onís 2005). Olivia was one of the high school seniors whose homeroom had been instructed by representatives of the Truth Commission in the tragic history of the violence. Her quick, blurry summation gives a sense of the gap between the Truth Commission’s best intentions and the way they are received by Ayacuchanos: There was this guy, Abimael Guzman. I think Abimael Guzman was a student or teacher at the university here. Abimael Guzman wanted to change the government of Peru to a communist one, because there was a dictatorship. So they talked to the peasants and got them to help ﬁght for this. But then things went bad and they started killing people who didn’t agree with them. They killed everyone in Chuschi because they wouldn’t tell the soldiers about Shining Path. Or maybe that was the soldiers who did that. And in Uchurraccay∞≥ they killed eight journalists who had gone to report on something. Shining Path killed them because they didn’t want people to know about what was going on.\n\nThis level of uncertainty about the events reﬂects a broader sense of ambiguity and confusion. In the photographer Vera Lentz’s words, ‘‘everything was unknown, there was no information . . . people did not always tell you what they were thinking because they were also scared’’ (Onís 2005). The state was initially reluctant to disseminate reports about the conﬂict, and many treated what little information they had with both skepticism and hope, sharing what they knew and imagining what they did not. Paradoxically, this heightened state of disinformation actually allowed Peruvians a\n\nAYA C U C H O\n\na\n\n≥∑\n\nbroader range of options in choosing how to deal with fear and threats. Information that countered the logic of any one decision could be strategically disregarded in the face of uncertainty and deliberate obfuscation of events. Given the vexed relationship to ‘‘information’’ during those years, Ayacuchanos’ responses to the Truth Commission’s anti-forgetting crusade are noteworthy. Several people adamantly defended their right to forget and to silence the events that had happened.∞∂ I often found this di≈cult to understand, having brought with me to Peru the perspective that attitudes toward the recent conﬂict were borne of the centuries of oppression and disenfranchisement of the indigenous, and that addressing this openly might lead to positive changes on a national level. But there is both a shame felt by those who were victims, who may choose to forget or elide their past as a conscious strategy for recovering—as well as a parallel embarrassment felt by those who did not overly su√er. The middle-class Ayacuchanos who were discriminated against in Lima, assumed to be terrorists, and prevented from traveling would prefer to forget the embarrassment of rural indiscretions like war; and it is this forgetting that the Truth Commission situates as especially problematic. Nonetheless, during the period of my ﬁeldwork there was a growing tension between the Truth Commission’s insistence that Peruvians not only remember but reveal, and survivors’ desires to forget or to remember only on their own terms. When its regional o≈ce opened in Ayacucho, expectations were high; many gave testimony imagining that it would open the door to individual reparations. As it became clear that material beneﬁt would not accrue out of the structured remembering, the initial sense of hope felt by people in the area was quickly doused, and many who had lived through those di≈cult years declined to give testimony, saying that the wounds have healed and should not be reopened.∞∑ Palito Ortega’s newest ﬁlm, El Rincón de los Inocentes (Corner of the Innocent, playing on the translation of Ayacucho’s name), tells yet another story of the violence— but caps it o√ with a cynical twist, the appearance of the ‘‘Truth Delegation,’’ which turns out to be sloppy, uncaring, and self-interested (2005). The city of Ayacucho today is a bustling regional capital of over 100,000 souls—though it remains oppressed by poverty, infrastructural problems, political crises, and social issues. By the time I arrived in Ayacucho, memo-\n\n≥∏\n\na\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nries of the worst of the violence were nearly a decade old. People didn’t focus on the war above all else in conversations: it wasn’t the primary referent for most people I talked to, and many almost implied that times were harder now. The violence, in retrospect, was one crisis of many, and although it was devastating it paled against the constant of the struggle against poverty, discrimination, and disenfranchisement. Despite the recountings above, then, this is not a book about the violence. It’s about how, in the context of the lines that are sometimes violently drawn between political power and indigenous oppression, families hope for a better future for their children. In the following chapter, I analyze the process of legal adoption as one careful and highly regulated way in which claims about a ‘‘better future’’ are enacted.\n\nTwo. INTERNATIONAL ADOPTION: THE GLOBALIZATION OF KINSHIP\n\na\n\nIn 2001, a couple arrived in Ayacucho from Europe to meet their new son. A taxi loaded to the gills with the couple, the man who represented their adoption agency in Peru, Ayacucho’s adoption o≈ce social worker, and an eager anthropologist made its way to Huanta, a small city about an hour away from Ayacucho, where one of the region’s children’s homes—named after Pope John Paul II—sits just blocks from the central plaza (see map 2). I tried to imagine what it was like for these new parents, seeing the road to Huanta for the ﬁrst time. I noticed how dry the hills were, whites and browns and yellows, with a ﬂash of green from each cactus or eucalyptus, and the bright yellow of the iconic broomﬂower. I took in the sight of animals young and old with fresh ribbons in their ears following the recent herranza ceremony. I saw the taxi driver driving on the wrong side of the road to avoid the potholes; and as we got to the police post on the road, the driver slung a fake seatbelt over his chest, announcing to me as I awkwardly straddled the gearshift, ‘‘Lady, I’ve been driving without one of these for forty years.’’ As we barreled along, the social worker leaned back to advise the couple’s representative to reserve a daytime return bus trip to Lima rather than overnight: that way they could see the scenery, and oh yes, plus it’s safer. There had been another robbery—highwaymen stopping an inter-\n\n≥∫\n\na\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\ndepartmental bus and robbing its passengers—early this morning, and she was worried about them returning to Lima by night. In Huanta, our group disembarked at the convent’s unlabeled door, paying the taxi driver the established fare of S/.5 each—about $1.50 at the time. One of the nuns opened the door and welcomed us inside. She showed the couple to the bedroom of their small suite, which was furnished with a double bed, a large crib, and a private bathroom: the nuns o√er reasonably priced room and board to the couples who come to Huanta to adopt their children. The couple put down their bags and the husband pulled out his video camera; I o√ered to run it so that he would be free to meet his new son. And so I saw the rest of the encounter through a black-and-white viewﬁnder, cinematically following the couple’s half-block walk to the orphanage, down the narrow stairs, across an open patio, and into the room where the young boy was presented to his new parents. His mother instantly started to cry, and the couple took turns holding him. For me, this whole experience was a cross between awkward and fascinating. I’d been introduced to the couple only moments before the trip by the adoption o≈ce social worker, who informed them I would be accompanying them on this major life event. Despite the presence of other nuns, another child, the social worker, and the representative, I felt that I didn’t belong there observing this private and personal moment. Oddly, it reminded me of when I worked as a medical translator one summer and had to tell a woman that the baby she was carrying had died: like I ought not to have been there. At the time, I thought I was seeing the couple and their new son traverse that terrain from stranger to relative in a matter of moments. Reﬂecting now, it’s clear that the couple already felt like parents during much of their long wait. Later, one of the nuns commented that the boy had been told for days prior to the arrival of the couple, ‘‘Your parents are coming for you!’’—so he, too, was beginning to be constituted as the child of those parents before they would even meet. After the emotional ﬁrst meeting, several of us took photos, and the mother asked how to correctly pronounce the boy’s name. As we all headed back to the convent, she told the social worker that he would keep the ﬁrst name he had been given. I remarked to their agency’s representative what a wonderful experience it had been to witness this, to see ﬁrsthand the joy on the couple’s faces. He and the social worker both replied, stating their\n\nI N T E R N AT I O N A L A D O P T I O N\n\na\n\n≥Ω\n\nfrustration that local foes of adoption do not see this and think that people just want to adopt to get laborers or organs. Back in the living room of the couple’s suite at the convent, we sat around and admired the child as he played with some of the toys the couple had brought from Europe. Eventually the boy fell asleep in his crib, and as his mother admired him, he shifted position so that his hands were behind his head, and she said with amazement, ‘‘That’s how my husband sleeps!’’ Later, she told us that some time ago they had taken in a sickly stray kitten that has since grown quite large and healthy, with good food and care. ‘‘You adopted her,’’ said the social worker, and I don’t think anyone missed the deliberately drawn parallel. Of course, a great deal had to happen before this couple could come to meet their child. The following sections trace the steps that may already be familiar to readers through personal experience or media representations. On one side of the equation, the couple had to go through a lengthy process designed to determine whether they would be appropriate parents. On the other side, the child had to be made available for adoption, which— whether he was orphaned, abandoned at birth, or removed from his home as a protective measure—would have involved a legal process extending over several months. And all of this—the detailed analysis of the parents, the legal production of a child for adoption, and the process through which they were matched together and ﬁnally legally made a family—is governed by national law and international conventions binding together Peru, the European country that the new family calls home, and the larger sphere of legal adoptions and children’s rights. Adoption is not the only arena where the state and international standards intervene in kinship-making practices. It is merely one of the most obvious ones.∞\n\nJUMPING THROUGH HOOPS: HOW ADULTS BECOME POTENTIAL PARENTS\n\nThe ﬁles prepared by potential adoptive parents,≤ both international and domestic,≥ are a deliberate statement about their suitability as parents. When read against the narratives of child abandonment they’re paired with, they support the construction of birth parents as unsuitable at the same time as they naturalize, or at least justify, adoptive parenthood. Hope-\n\n∂≠\n\na\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nful adopters perform their appropriateness as future parents through the detailed documentation of their moral uprightness and through narratives of desire. Parental worth is demonstrated as pre-adopters (the term given them by the adoption o≈ce) collect together all the required documents. They prove their identity through photocopies of passports and birth certiﬁcates. Letters of recommendation from friends and colleagues, coupled with clean police and judicial records, demonstrate their moral solvency. The pre-adopters document their own economic solvency through records of employment, pay stubs, or property tax receipts. They will include certiﬁcates of physical and mental health, produced by medical professionals. A written application includes a recounting of their respective educational histories (at least one parent is required to have completed a high school education). The adoption o≈ce evaluates the suitability of their home via a collection of photographs, which must include ‘‘the room of our future son and/or daughter.’’ The breadth of these documentary requirements is frequently frustrating to pre-adopters, who often see themselves as naturally worthy of receiving children (see Fonseca 2002b).∂ ‘‘There are no unplanned adoptions,’’ adoptive couples like to say. Such a sentiment is echoed in one social worker’s report on a couple that stated ‘‘I think that this case merits giving the opportunity to people who truly deserve to be parents’’ (emphasis mine).
