        "meta_description": "In the aftermaths of the internal armed conflict in Peru (1980-2000), a group of film enthusiasts from the Andean highland town of Ayacucho began using cameras to tell their stories of violence in the region. According to scholarly analyses, these films reflect a collective trauma resulting from prolonged experiences of political violence and abandonment from the state. However, little attention has been given to the filmmakers’ creative practice and its impact on their community. To address this gap, this article takes a multimodal approach to ethnographically explore the circumstances and conditions in which these films are made. It argues that cinema-making in the Andes is a social intervention that resists contemporary memory regimes by forming a community of storytellers who reimagine the past to create alternative futures.",

        "text": "1Introduction: Film as Practice\n\n‘You foolish academics!\n\nStop analysing and come to see what we do and listen to what we say.\n\nYou'll find that we don't make films to reinvent the past.\n\nInstead, we build community to create better futures through art – our art.’\n\nLalo Parra, filmmaker and art teacher from Ayacucho, interview 2017\n\n2In 2017, I returned to Ayacucho to conduct an ethnographic study concerned with the memories of the Peruvian internal armed conflict (1980-2000) and an emerging scene of horror filmmakers, which, at this point, had been studied by social scientists for more than a decade (e.g., Cabrera 2007; Cabrejo 2010; Cano López 2010; Del Pino 2014; Bustamante and Luna Victoria 2017a/b; Ulfe 2020). Critics coined the terms acción y violencia social (action and social violence) or realismo social (social realism) to describe the style and genre of these movies made by predominantly self-taught filmmakers whose stories were characterised by an ‘emphasis on the description or denunciation of violence inflicted on individuals or communities in specific historical circumstances’ (Bustamante and Luna Victoria 2017a: 68). Earlier films narrate the filmmakers’ personal experiences during the internal armed conflict, which, as many of them explained, was a response to official memory narratives from which Ayacuchans had felt excluded. Over the years, the filmmakers expanded their repertoire to include horror movies inspired by popular folk and cautionary tales about foreign or spiritual threats against the community. Scholarly works analysing these films argued that the horrors depicted in the movies and the stories of horror experienced in the region from pre-colonial times until today were a way of processing collective experiences of violence and seeking justice through the means of storytelling. I was intrigued by how violent horror and action dramas featuring resurrected Incas or brain-eating Alpacas could be doing justice to a community that had been affected by political violence and armed conflict over centuries.\n\n3What I found was a vibrant community of film enthusiasts held together by a shared passion for storytelling. In the 90s, ‘cinema was the newest thing, and we wanted to be part of that future’ (Interview Morales 2016), I was told by Carlitos, the cameraman who had worked on many of the films made. Cinema, it appeared, was not merely a storytelling device but a powerful technology through which an exciting future was within reach. Hence, understanding their artistic practice solely as a way of working through histories of violence or contesting dominant memory narratives seemed inconclusive. There was something else happening that I felt compelled to explore by engaging with the ways cinema was being made and viewed here. This article responds to concerns raised by filmmaker and art teacher Lalo Parra during one of our conversations, not to think about cinema from Ayacucho merely in terms of plots and storylines but to consider how storytelling as a creative practice embodies imagined futures, not just by reframing or fictionalising shared experiences but by creating a community of storytellers.\n\n4Trained as a visual anthropologist and filmmaker, I approached the art and craft of cinema-making through ethnographic filmmaking. Understanding the moving image to ‘make itself sensuously and sensibly manifest as the expression of experience by experience’ (Sobchack 1992: 3), I sought to connect with my research partners through ‘crafting together’ and putting our filmmaking practice, both theirs and ours, at the centre of my enquiry – a phenomenology of the filmmaking experience of sorts. Using a camera to observe the processes involved in cinema-making meant attending to the diverse possibilities of understanding human experience through the practice of making things, whilst also considering its limitations as a knowledge-making practice (Westmoreland 2022: 174).\n\n6\n\n7The story of this film piece took shape on production sets, roaming the streets of Huamanga (Ayacucho City) in search of actors and props or testing equipment in people’s homes and garages. Past, present and future – common notions of Western temporality – locate the passing of time in a matter-of-fact manner. And yet, in understanding this film material anew, it becomes apparent that the experience of time is never predetermined or already established, not even in storylines, film scripts or time frames. Instead, pasts, presents and futures arise as ephemeral constellations in situated practices, such as figuring out how to prepare a skull to feature in a horror scene, building a rig to create new camera angles or imagining one’s character’s state of mind when facing the Spanish invaders. Conceptualisations of time often fail to consider people’s experience of time, its situatedness: for how we live through time is entangled with everyday life and its concerns, like production costs, work commitments and family obligations. Experiencing time is relational as it matters how people understand themselves and relate to others. Whether they are churchgoers, victim-survivors, Quechua speakers, well-off, queer or “man enough”, with a view on practice, one cannot but take notice of the plurality of frameworks that are at play in people’s lives.\n\n8And yet, experience as narrated through our camera lens and editing can only offer a partial view of people and the sensory, affective, material and symbolic worlds they must navigate. Framed and arranged into a story with a beginning, middle and end, a narrative can evoke worlds of inequality and their transformative potentials (Biehl and Locke 2017: 3), but more than anything, it is indicative of the relationship between the narrator and who is narrated. No one speaks from nowhere according to philosopher Hans Gadamer. He argued that telling stories about others requires considering one’s own positioning, not as an ethical but fundamentally epistemological stance (Gadamer 1992: 302). To understand what we know, we need to consider how we know, ‘not as a way of being but a way of becoming something else – learning from experience’ (Laplante, Scobie and Grandsman 2020: 8).\n\n9Filmmaking embodies this proposition perhaps more than any other modality since filming can literally only occur from a particular point of view (Lawrence and Dietrich 2024). Here, my view was construed by an intellectual ambition to come close to the processes of crafting and engaging with the experiences of making films and telling stories that the established analytical frameworks had evaded, at least according to my protagonists. Yet, I was one of those scholars, here to examine a social world through their experience of it. They did not send me away, not because I made a commitment to think with them. There was a curiosity that worked in my favour. My family was from the North of Peru, I said, but the sound of my European accent placed me in unknown territory. I arrived with a cameraman from Mexico and an English sound recordist. What is your story, they asked me over and over again, but the story they imagined of me was bigger than what I could deliver. “Who knows,” they may have thought, “there may be more to her.” So we were allowed to stay, record and reflect on our craft. As a filmmaker, I was conscious of the work involved in the process of making a film. What I found in Ayacucho was an almost reckless readiness to plunge into the arduous labour of being creative without any funding, public (or private) support systems or promise of financial returns. These projects existed not because but despite the country's cultural politics that had ignored filmmaking in Ayacucho since its beginnings. This community of filmmakers, including directors, writers, actors, prop artists, etc., was formed on the basis of voluntary work, individual passions and ambitions, costly sacrifices and stubborn visions of owning a collective past. The other side of the coin was a systemic lack of resources and training, which were patched up by resourceful improvisation, often insufficient to make up for what was missing.\n\n10With the production of La Maldicion del Inca (The curse of the Inca) passing its 10th year, this film may never see the light of day as one film. Yet, the many occasions on which the crew came together to watch individual scenes on a bedsheet screen made me wonder whether it mattered. “It matters”, according to Martin, who carried the bulk of production costs so far. “I would, of course, like to share our film with an audience so I can be remembered as the filmmaker who told our stories” (Interview Ccorahua 2018), he added. Martin’s words suggest that he has a future of memory in mind. According to memory scholar Elizabeth Jelin (2021), it is an imagined future that motivates people to become the tellers of their own histories. In this sense, reducing cinema from Ayacucho to re-writes of violent pasts misconstrues their practice. Instead, their filmmaking re-entangles past, present, and imagined futures in the process of choosing one’s own becoming. In other words, cinema from Ayacucho is not memory; it is memory-making.\n\nA Short History of Claiming Futures\n\n11The production of the first Ayacuchan films took place in 1992, shortly after the defeat of the self-declared Partido Comunista del Perú, Sendero Luminoso (Degregori 2010), internationally known as Shining Path, one of two deadly insurgent organisations that had declared war against the Peruvian state in the early 1980s. Despite the ongoing dictatorship of Alberto Fujimori, the absence of bombs, dead bodies and curfews was enough to get young men and women back out onto the streets and begin re-imagining the world with the newly accessible video technology (Interview Parra 2016). According to Lucho Berrocal, ‘the handheld camera was like a window to the future and we all wanted a glimpse’ (Interview Berrocal 2018). Movies like Lágrimas de Fuego (1996) and Dios tarda pero no olvida (1997) were low-budget action dramas based on the filmmakers’ own lived experiences during the Peruvian internal armed conflict and its immediate aftermaths.\n\nhttps://www.filmaffinity.com/​us/​film937190.html\n\nhttps://www.filmaffinity.com/​us/​film987055.html, (accessed January 23, 2024)\n\n‘You have to imagine that we saw what the police and military were doing on the streets and the endless rumours of people being tortured in the cartels and prisons and of their bodies being burned or thrown into rivers. All along, we were afraid of Shining Path, too, who did horrible things if you didn’t give them food or shelter or worse if you opposed them. The streets were full of horror stories, and there was no state to help us.’ (Interview Ccorahua 2018)\n\nLagrimas de Fuego\n\n14With an estimated 69,280 people killed (CVR 2003, Annex 2: 1), Ayacucho was the region most severely devastated by both insurgent and state violence, claiming almost a third of the total casualties, predominantly from Quechua-speaking communities. Shortly after the collapse of Fujimori’s regime, which marked the end of the conflict, an interim government assigned a Truth Commission to investigate the extent of the horrors experienced during the two decades of violence. The commission’s final report revealed fatal errors in military intelligence and intervention, next to widespread human rights violations inflicted on mainly indigenous populations. It concluded that racism, negligence and abuse of power were the presumable causes for the disproportionate and systematic use of violence on all sides, particularly in Ayacucho where the threat of Shining Path against the local population was imminent (CVR 2004). On the other hand, there were animosities and stigmatisations from within and between victimised communities where neighbours had turned into enemies (Theidon 2014, Robin 2021). After the conflict, these communities were left to rebuild a social fabric torn to pieces. In many respects, these findings acknowledged the experiences of the young Ayacuchan cinema-makers. And yet, little of this research became known to the filmmakers since dissemination was feeble (Ulfe and Sobogal 2021), and subsequent government institutions showed little interest in circulating reports that pointed at unstable democratic institutions and deep-seated societal divisions.\n\n15When anthropologist Ponciano del Pino asked the film director Palito Ortega what he wanted his films to achieve, the latter answered, ‘(…) My movies are meant to serve as documents, so people can say, “this is how the violence really was for us here”’ (Ortega Matute in Del Pino 2014: 154). By fictionalising real stories and showing how the violence inflicted by both state forces and Shining Path affected people, he sought to give evidence of a silenced truth about the conflict for the generations to come. This claim to victimhood is sustained by a narrative in which both insurgents and state forces were the alien other that entered his community and spoiled a harmonious life. Ortega’s stories, however, not only speak of victimhood but also of the Peruvian state’s moral obligation to acknowledge people from Ayacucho as Peruvian citizens drawing on long histories of racialised discrimination against Peru’s Indigenous and Quechua-speaking communities.\n\nBecoming Community: Ayacuchan, Andean, or Peruvian Cinema?\n\n20Anthropologist Alfred Gell argued that an art object can actively shape interactions or initiate ‘causal sequences’ (Gell 1998: 16) between its makers, users, patrons, audiences and, indeed, itself; that is, it can exert agency. For producers of movies and producers of memory, this agency not only articulates a desire for empowerment but also empowers by actively contributing to the imagination of a collective future. This imagination also expresses a desire for the cultural valorisation of their craft within Peruvian society and its creative industry, which filmmakers from Ayacucho and their audiences have experienced as discriminatory and condescending. Indeed, despite the provincials’ keen interest for locally produced films that manifests in packed movie theatres, public funding to support educational training and access to production and distribution networks still needs to be improved (Bustamante and Luna Victoria 2017b: 211).\n\n21Despite the limitations, there is an appreciation for beautiful images and narrative styles. With the movies of Jean-Claude Van Damme or Steven Seagal often mentioned as early inspiration, films from Ayacucho show a preference for fast pans, zooming-in or moving around central characters as well as eccentric costumes. This global flow and appropriation of styles that have shaped Ayacucho’s cultural productions is a testament to the region’s connectedness and constant transformation (Weismantel 2001: xxi). With filmmakers owning their cinema and creating an aesthetic that is situated as well as (globally) connected, space becomes another dimension that does not exist as ‘here’ or ‘there’ but as a constellation that creates something new.\n\n22However, operating in a limited commercial context highly dependent on a local market, stakeholders recoup only a small portion of their privately invested money through public screenings. Some even make losses due to piracy, digital viewing platforms and lack of infrastructure for screenings. This adds to the difficult commercialisation of their work, a problem that many Peruvian filmmakers have voiced (Bustamante and Luna Victoria 2017a: 52). Filmmakers themselves agree that there is a need for more resources to raise production quality. Under these circumstances, trades like directing, recording, acting, costumes etc. cannot be turned into occupations but have to remain “passions”. Also attributed to the absence of institutional and societal support is the absence of female creators amongst the mostly cis-hetero male directors and producers. ‘What you see is that women are more sensible – they look after their families but making films here is not a responsible thing. It’s the opposite, really’ (Interview Parra 2016). In other words, in Ayacucho irresponsibility is a privilege that only man can afford, which is one other tangent of the imbalances and inequalities traversing the country as well as the film industry."
