        "text": "Post Date: October 02, 2023\n\nThe National Academy of Public Administration today announced that 60 leaders in the field of public administration have been selected for the 2023 Class of Academy Fellows.\n\n“We are pleased to announce the 2023 class of distinguished Academy Fellows – it is our largest Fellows class to date, and all are nationally recognized and respected for their expertise in the field of public administration,” said Terry Gerton, President and CEO of the Academy. “We welcome these outstanding new Fellows and invite them to help us advance the Academy vision - a just, fair, and inclusive government that strengthens communities and protects democracy.”\n\nInduction of the new Fellows will occur during the annual Academy Fall Meeting, which will take place in-person November 1-3 at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Washington, D.C., with a focus on “Grand Challenges in Public Administration.”\n\nSelection of the Academy’s new Fellows follows a rigorous review of the individual’s contributions to the field of public administration and policy. A Fellows Nominating Committee, selected by the Academy’s Board Chair, makes its recommendations to the full Fellowship, which then votes on those individuals nominated to be a Fellow. The Committee was co-chaired by Academy Fellows Margie Graves and Richard Callahan.\n\nThe 2023 class joins nearly 1,000 Academy Fellows – including former cabinet officers, members of Congress, governors, mayors and state legislators, as well as prominent scholars, business executives, nonprofit leaders, and public administrators.
