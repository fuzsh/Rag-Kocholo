I personally found it to be quite good at explain what steps led to certain developments in the American political system. The neutral viewpoint of the book was largely refreshing rather than having bias towards either party that in my view poisons many core lessons when one wants to learn of politics. It was pure fact and causality (A+B=C), no agendas or propaganda to glorify or vilify either democrats or republicans.\n\nThat being said, if you're looking for a book that teaches you about the current political system down to the nuts and bolts, you'll probably be disappointed. Where it shines in history, it lacks in instruction. You get the why, but not the how. This was my biggest gripe about the book.\n\nBut that aside, the reader was well spoken and like I said earlier the history was very enlightening. I'd recommend it, so long as you temper your expectations a little."
