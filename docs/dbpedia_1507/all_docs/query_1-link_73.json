August, 2003.\n\nDisplay Abstract Display Keywords\n\nDetermined to read the Book of Mormon in purely naturalistic nineteenth century terms, rather than as an ancient text, recent criticisms of that volume of scripture are offended by some descriptions of Lamanites in the text. This is particularly true when the Nephites describe the Lamanites in pejorative terms, such as blood-thirsty, idolatrous, ferocious, idle, lazy, and filthy. The question is whether these terms can be considered “racist,” and whether supposed “racist” attitudes of the Nephites are evidence against the authenticity of the Book of Mormon.\n\nKeywords: Curse; Lamanite; Nephite; Racism; Skin Color\n\nTopics: Book of Mormon Scriptures > Ether\n\nID = [32386] Status = Type = talk Date = 2003-08-01 Collections: bmc-archive,bom,fair-conference Size: 24105 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:48:49\n\nYoung, Margaret Blair. “Black Latter-day Saints: A Faith-FULL History.” Paper presented at the 2003 FairMormon Conference Conference.

August, 2012.\n\nDisplay Abstract Display Keywords\n\nWe Latter-day Saints are temple-centered people. So were the Nephites. But what do we know about their temple worship, how it worked and what it was for? How was it even possible for the Nephites to observe the Mosaic rituals without the Levitical priesthood, the Aaronite high priest, and the Ark of the Covenant? And given that our temple worship today isn’t about animal sacrifice, what, if anything, does their temple worship have to do with ours? Critics, and even friendlier outside observers like Harold Bloom, have sometimes come away from reading the Book of Mormon—in Bloom’s case not reading it very much—but they’ve sometimes come away thinking that there isn’t much “Mormon-ism” in the book. Let’s see whether our exploration of temple themes in the Nephite narratives contradicts this or bears it out.\n\nKeywords: Aminadi (Ancestor of Amulek); Ark of Cumorah; Ark of the Covenant; Book of Lehi; Early Church History; High Priest; Hill Cumorah; Interpreters; Law of Moses; Liahona; Lost 116 Pages; Mosiah the Elder; Sword of Laban; Temple\n\nTopics: Book of Mormon Scriptures > Mosiah\n\nBook of Mormon Scriptures > Ether\n\nID = [32499] Status = Type = talk Date = 2012-08-01 Collections: bmc-archive,bom,fair-conference Size: 22636 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:48:49\n\nWixam, Hartt. “Perception and Reality: Then and Now.” Paper presented at the 2012 FairMormon Conference Conference.
