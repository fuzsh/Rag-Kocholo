        "text": "One of the most attractive and endearing aspects of Greenville’s downtown is the look and feel of its Main Street. In the wake of Mayor Max Heller’s campaign to transform it into a more European aesthetic with its tree canopy, wide sidewalks and fewer lanes for cars, visitors and locals alike have flocked to enjoy its charm. The continued presence of many of the city’s old buildings provide a key component to the experience that so many enjoy. A mix of new and old gives a character that welcomes people of different generations. A photographic journey down Main Street gives us a glimpse of the evolution and heritage of the heart of our city.\n\nA view from the 1890s shows us when North Main was still a dirt road and not yet commercialized. The home on the left is near the corner where North Street intersects with Main. The photo is pointing south from somewhere near where the NoMa plaza is now located. Transportation was still dominated by horses and carriages. Main Street was notoriously muddy after a good rainstorm, making everyday business a much slower process. Photo courtesy of the Greenville County Historical Society.\n\nThe stately, three-story Queen Anne Victorian home of Mills Hoke was located on the east side of North Main. It was one of many big homes lining the North Main block between North and College in the late 1800s. A two-story porch fronted the left side of the house with a conical turret behind it. Just to the left of the house (here seen with a wagon on it) was Oak Street (no longer here). In the foreground, placed in the middle of Main Street, is the old Confederate monument. It became a traffic hazard after cars became popular and was moved to the entrance outside of Springwood cemetery. Photo courtesy of the Greenville County Historical Society, Oscar Landing Collection.\n\nThe 1960s brought significant changes to the look of North Main. Here we see the Downtowner Motor Inn on the left side of the photo, which replaced the elegant Ottaray Hotel and was built by Daniel Construction Co. (whose headquarters was across the street). Oak Street borders the motor inn on the right side with Phoenix Furniture on the opposite corner (now approximately where Roost Restaurant is located) and Ivey’s department store on the far right. Photo courtesy of the City of Greenville, City Archives.\n\nBeginning on the corner of West North Street (left foreground), North Main Street was a prestigious residential neighborhood filled with large Victorian homes for the Smiths, Sloanes, Coxes, and many other families. The tree canopy that graces the sidewalks along Main Street in this postcard would soon be torn down with the block’s commercialization in the 1910s-20s, only to return with plantings during the 1970s under Mayor Max Heller. In the distance can be seen the Confederate monument in the middle of Main Street. Photo courtesy of the Greenville County Library System, South Carolina Room Archives.\n\nThis wonderful view of the block between Coffee and North streets shows a dirt road with trolley tracks running down the middle of the road. While the first few corner buildings on the far left are no longer here, all of the early 19th century buildings on the right (west) side remain today except the second (red brick) building. J.A. Bull’s grocery store on the corner was a very popular and successful business of that era with several locations around town. Photo courtesy of the Greenville County Library System, South Carolina Room Archives.\n\nIn September, 1924, Greenville was among many cities that celebrated the first National Defense Day with a parade. In the middle of this photo is a theater with a “Sinners in Heaven” banner. The Garing Theatre is, perhaps, the least widely known about of the great old theaters that used to entertain Greenvillians. It wasn’t the earliest, but it was a very popular venue for a decade. It was at 115 N. Main — in the location at the far right of the current Mast General Store. Athol John (AJ) Garing played with John Philip Sousa’s band before coming to Greenville and making a name for himself by conducting many events at the Grand Opera House. It opened on April 19, 1915, and became known as one of the beautiful theaters in the Carolinas. It sat 450 people, was well ventilated, and had an expensive pipe organ. Tragically, the projection room had a fire on Aug. 4, 1925, and there was too much damage to open as a theater again. Within a few years, Meyers-Arnold department store, which had already occupied 111-113 N. Main, took over the former Garing space and enlarged their store. Today many Greenvillians enjoy this space when they shop at Mast General Store. Top photo courtesy of the Greenville County Historical Society; bottom photo courtesy of the author, John Nolan.\n\nDuring the 1960s, a number of older buildings were covered in metal façades to bring them into the modern era. Here we see the 1905 Bank of Commerce building at the corner of East Coffee and North Main clad in turquoise with shops like Dick Carnes and Sparr filling up the first-story storefronts. As dated as that look was, it helped preserve the buildings underneath, so when the façade was removed in the mid-1980s, the charming bank building was again revealed. Across the street we see Walgreens drug store (now Trio restaurant) and the 17-story SCN building (now where Wells Fargo is located). Photo courtesy of the City of Greenville, City Archives.\n\nOne of Greenville’s earliest photographic views of Main Street here shows a view looking south from the Coffee Street intersection. On the far right is Finlay Bros. Grocers, which was founded in 1881 by James and Alexander Finlay. The grocery store occupied a handsome, 26-by-80 foot, three-story brick building and carried such products as molasses, sugars, syrups, canned goods, table delicacies, teas, coffees, pickles, foreign and domestic fruits, and fresh, local farm produce. None of the buildings on the right side of the photo between Coffee and Washington streets remain today. Top photo courtesy of the Greenville County Library System, South Carolina Room Archives; bottom photo courtesy of the author, John Nolan.\n\nThis view may look like you’re on Greenville’s Main Street in 1895, but Main Street is actually the cross street in the middle of the photo. Here we are viewing Washington Street from approximately where Brown Street intersects and looking west. On the left (where Sticky Fingers is now located) is the Windsor Hotel, a building that began as the Planter’s Hotel in 1823 but was later expanded and became a dormitory for the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Only in its later years did the building became home to the Wilson Hotel. Only one of the four large buildings at the intersection remain. The 1880s three-story building on the upper left corner still remains as a one-story building housing Sushi Murasaki and The Orient Restaurants. Top photo courtesy of the Greenville County Library System, South Carolina Room Archives; bottom photo courtesy of the author, John Nolan.\n\nFor many who grew up in the 1950s-60s in Greenville, this photo encapsulates the nostalgia and feel that represents for them the best of times in our city. The textile industry was still woven throughout the community, the Woodside/SCN building was a proud economic and skyline feature, department stores like Kress, JC Penney, and Woolworth’s brought families downtown for special weekly outings, and prominent Christmas decorations reflected the spirit of faith and community. Most of the buildings on the left (west) side of the street between McBee and Washington remain today while none of the ones on the right (east) side are still here. Photo courtesy of the Greenville County Historical Society.\n\nTurning again to Greenville’s dirt Main Street in the late 1800s, the photo is taken from the balcony of the old courthouse looking north toward the length of the western side. The Mansion House hotel on the far left had graced Court Square since 1824 and was a major factor in attracting summer visitors from the Lowcountry. Carpenter Bros. drug store was still in its original location on the west side of Court Square. The next building was Wilkins, Poe & Co. Hardware store followed by John T. Woodside’s grocery store, the National Bank of Greenville, McAlister & Beattie dry goods, and FF Spencer shoe store. Top photo courtesy of the Greenville County Library System, South Carolina Room Archives; bottom photo courtesy of the author, John Nolan.\n\nAfter a decade of low occupancy rates and foot traffic, this early 1980s photo shows Main Street’s new look with a planting of young trees, two lanes, wide sidewalks, diagonal parking, planters, and decorative crosswalks. This key part of Greenville’s early revitalization was put in motion by Mayor Max Heller, who hired one of America’s best urban planners, Lawrence Halprin, to reconceive the downtown look. The Poinsett Hotel is seen on the left. Rexall drug store occupies the space where Nose Dive Gastropub is located now, while the three-story white Belk’s department store building sits where the Poinsett Plaza is now. Photo courtesy of the City of Greenville, City Archives.\n\nCourt Square’s original log courthouse from 1797 was replaced by this beautiful brick-and-stone building in 1823 designed by Robert Mills — a renowned early American architect who also designed the Washington Monument and Treasury buildings in Washington D.C., and many civic and church buildings in Charleston, as well as numerous other courthouses throughout South Carolina. Prior to the Civil War, the loggia’s balcony was used to auction slaves for area planters and businessmen. Before permanent churches were built in the city, both traveling and local ministers like William Bullein Johnson preached at the courthouse. Politicians such as John C. Calhoun would speak from the balcony to inform and persuade locals about issues such as nullification. In its later years, the courthouse became home to the Greenville Chamber of Commerce. Skyscrapers became the new rage in the early 1900s and any city in America wanted one to become modern. The old courthouse was torn down and the new Chamber of Commerce “skyscraper” opened in 1925. In this period of huge city growth and expansion, Greenville lost its most architecturally important building in its history. Top photo courtesy of the Greenville County Historical Society; bottom photo courtesy of the author, John Nolan.\n\nThe 1856 brick building on the southeast corner of court square is the oldest commercial building downtown and the second oldest overall behind Christ Church Episcopal. John Grady and Robert Goodlett partnered to create Grady & Goodlett Dry Goods and built this building opposite of John Grady’s old store (southwest corner). After Goodlett dropped out of the partnership, Grady ran the store until 1869 when he took on partners John Ferguson and Jacob Miller. Ferguson & Miller Grocery continued in the space in the last few decades of the 1800s. The photo above shows when it was Pool & Bagwell Grocers in the early 1900s, later to be followed by Jones Furniture Co. and the Cancellation Shoe Mart. Soby’s New South Cuisine took it over in 1997 and now celebrates its 25th anniversary. Top photo courtesy of the Greenville County Historical Society; bottom photo courtesy of the author, John Nolan.\n\nGreenville’s 1892 Post Office at the corner of West Broad and South Main was a beautiful example of Romanesque Revival architecture and had an iconic five-story tower at its corner entryway. The city later bought the building and re-opened it as City Hall in 1938. The building would remain an integral part of Main Street’s landscape until 1970s sensibilities deemed it outdated and too expensive to maintain and expand. The Masonic Temple office building behind the post office would become the site of the new (and current) city hall in 1973 when the Romanesque building was sadly torn down. None of the buildings in this postcard remain today except the Carolina Supply brick building on West Court Street in the upper left. Photo courtesy of the author, John Nolan.\n\nThe entrance to Main Street’s bridge is in the foreground of this photo looking north to court square and beyond. The buildings on the far left are still here today and were recently announced as part of a new music performing-recording space as part of the Peace Center’s $36 million AMP project. Dominating the skyline is the 37-foot-by-30-foot Greenville News-Piedmont two-sided clock that could be seen for many blocks away. The News’ building was built in 1913-14 and the clock installed in 1947. It was a landmark for the city until the building and clock were taken down in 1968 for a new Greenville News office building (now where the AC Marriott hotel stands). Photo courtesy of the Greenville County Historical Society.\n\nThis view is looking southwest from the Main Street bridge with a hill leading up to McBee Terrace where a female Presbyterian school, Chicora College, was built in 1893. It included a girl’s dorm, administration building, classroom building and a central octagonal auditorium large enough to seat 1,200 people. The front of the school faced the river and had a large grassy slope leading down to the banks. Low enrollment plagued Chicora throughout its early years. After the first decade of the new century, enrollment had increased but competition from Greenville Female College and financial woes caused the all-female school to fall short of the trustees’ initial expectations. They decided to move the college in 1915 and took over their recently closed sister institution, (Presbyterian) College for Women in Columbia. Chicora later merged with Queens College and continues today as Queens University of Charlotte. The important investment of the Riverplace development, which began construction in 2005, was a major piece in the revitalization of both the West End and the Riverwalk areas. Top photo courtesy of the Greenville County Library System, South Carolina Room Archives; bottom photo courtesy of the author, John Nolan.\n\nLooking southeast over the Main Street bridge in this circa-1912 photo we can see the industrial character of what the Reedy River had become. Downtown’s first textile mills are in view, each located on one of the Reedy’s falls. Sampson & Hall Mill was built on the lower falls in 1874 with the Camperdown Mill soon appearing on the upper falls in 1876. Each of these relied on the Reedy’s water power to drive the looms and machinery inside. Ruins of each of these mills remain on the sites and can still put us in touch with the origins of the city’s early textile industry. While the lamp posts on today’s bridge are not original, they are very similar to the lamps that were there over 100 years ago.

Notice the blue (swimming pool) on the far right in the path of what is now the Swamp Rabbit Trail. Further down Main Street the Harper Bros. building’s 1910 façade was covered with a 1970’s blank sheathing. The former Bell Tower Mall/ Greenville County Offices is visible in the upper left and is now being transformed into a new $1 billion mixed-use development.

The first permanent structure was the Touchstone house, which still remains (most recently Mary’s Restaurant). The second building on the curve came in 1911 when Geer Drug Co. purchased the property and built a four-story brick building for nearly $20,000 to serve as a wholesale drug-distribution center. However, Geer Drug stayed in the building for less than two years before Thompson’s T-Model Ford Agency moved into all four floors. Thompson’s Ford occupied the building until 1924, and a few years later Piedmont Battery opened its doors there for a brief period before Davis Used Cars did business until 1940. Dan Tassey’s auto trimming business moved in for the next decade until Harper Brothers Office Supply bought the building. Harper Bros. moved out in 1988 due to the proliferation of specialty office supply chains like Office Max and Office Depot. Today Foxcroft Wine Co. & Restaurant successfully occupies the street level floor.

In the 1870s, the young Dr. Thomas T. Earle built the triangular drugstore there after returning to Greenville after graduating from Columbian Medical College in Washington, D.C. It was among the early commercial ventures in the West End. In 1890, the American Bank (pictured here) took over Earle’s drugstore site. The bank was a two-story Victorian brick structure with a decorative porch facing the muddy streets at its apex. The bank’s presence was strengthened when it had its outdated building remodeled in 1920 in the regal Beaux-Arts style. In 1980 the Legal Services Agency renovated the building and its signage remains across the front today.
