        "text": "Daniel Pick is a training analyst in the British Psychoanalytical Society and an emeritus professor at Birkbeck, University of London, where he taught and conducted research in the Department of History, Classics and Archaeology until 2022.\n\nHis writing on history, politics, and culture has been influenced by the theories of Klein and Freud, and he returns again and again to their work – among that of other psychoanalysts, particularly Wilfred Bion – to investigate and illuminate mass phenomena. He is interested in the role of myths and fantasies in culture and political life. He has for many years examined psychoanalysis through a historian’s lens, seeking to place key ideas in context, while, equally, studying history from a psychoanalytic perspective. He has paid particular attention in his research to the interactions between individuals and groups, struggles for and against freedom of mind, and the many expressions of anxiety in culture and society. In a 2010 paper, ‘Psychoanalysis, History and National Culture’, he grappled with the reasons behind the striking neglect of psychoanalytic theory by the majority of British historians across the twentieth century. His recent work has explored the dynamics of influence, hidden persuasion, and the history of brainwashing.\n\nPsychoanalysis and history\n\nWhile an undergraduate and doctoral student at Cambridge, studying English then history, Pick became absorbed by psychoanalytic ideas, which at the time were playing an increasingly important role in literary criticism, film theory, and philosophy. As both psychoanalyst and historian, Pick has remained preoccupied by the question of how the past bears upon and is reconfigured in the present. Several of his essays and books in cultural history, such as Svengali’s Web: The Alien Enchanter in Modern Culture, and Rome or Death: The Obsessions of General Garibaldi, explore psychoanalytic concepts and consider their relevance in historical enquiry. Pick demonstrates how, in psychoanalysis as in history, one must remain curious about the larger frameworks within which we operate, and the terms under which narratives are produced and reproduced.\n\nHe has a long-standing interest in how the language of psychiatry and psychoanalysis can shape the ways people understand themselves and their histories, as he showed in his first book, Faces of Degeneration: A European Disorder, c. 1848-1914. A co-written article with the historian Catherine Hall in History Workshop Journal (Autumn 2017) discussed the uses of the psychoanalytic ideas of ‘denial’ in historical accounts of individuals, institutions, and collective processes. Hall and Pick considered how different defences may operate – involving denial, disavowal, splitting, and negation – and reflected upon how these ideas can deepen our understanding of individual and group behaviour. They focused on various case studies where states of actively ‘not-knowing’ can be identified.\n\nMedia, broadcasting, and popular writing\n\nPick has also worked in radio, presenting programmes for the BBC on subjects such as Freud for our times, psychological profiling, and the psychological roots of violent extremism. In 2017 he presented ‘The Unconscious Life of Bombs’ on BBC Radio 4, which revolved in part around the Klein archives in London. He acted as a historical consultant on various programmes, including In Search of Ourselves (2014), a Radio 4 series exploring ideas of the mind, identity, and therapy. For seven years he led a Wellcome Trust-funded research project, ‘Hidden Persuaders: Brainwashing, Culture, Clinical Knowledge and the Cold War Human Sciences, c. 1950-1990’, which led to numerous outputs, including films, publications, interviews, and podcasts, and his 2022 book, Brainwashed: A New History of Thought Control. In Brainwashed he examines fears and fantasies about mind control in the twentieth century.\n\nHis Psychoanalysis: A Very Short Introduction is a brief yet engaging account of the ‘talking cure’ and its rich history, offering a glimpse into its many developments and controversies, as well as its conceptual diversity. One of its central concerns is to convey the consequences of Freud’s innovation of the psychoanalytic consulting room and the boundaried time and space of the session. This book, aimed at non-specialist readers, makes a case for the clinical usefulness of psychoanalysis and the potent ways in which it can enable us to think about our minds and the minds of others.\n\nBuilding on his Wellcome project, Pick gave the Psychoanalytic Center of California’s Annual Melanie Klein Lecture in 2019 on the subject of ‘Hidden Persuasion’, in which he drew on texts by Freud, Klein, and Bion, among other analysts who have thought deeply about the mind, freedom, and ‘thought control’. In 2023 he was a recipient of the Sigourney Award.\n\nClinical work\n\nIn his twenties, alongside his doctoral research, Pick spent time as an adult education tutor in the prison system. That experience raised new questions for him about our unconscious attitudes to crime, punishment, and the role of the superego. Subsequently, he gained clinical experience in hospitals, psychiatric wards, and a student counselling service. He embarked on a psychodynamic psychotherapy course at the Tavistock and, later, held a sessional post in the adult psychotherapy department, alongside his private practice. He qualified as a psychoanalyst in 2000 and became a fellow of the British Psychoanalytical Society a few years later.\n\nFor Pick, the experience of being in the analytic session is by turns challenging, surprising, and moving. He has written about how, as an analyst, being thrown back on states of uncertainty is both inevitable and integral to clinical work, as is the continual questioning of what is happening in the here and now, both in one’s own mind and in that of the patient. He sees it as the analyst’s work to help patients find expression for inchoate feelings, to bear and give thought to what may seem unthinkable, and to find a language through which to examine and, sometimes, rework the stories we tell ourselves – all in order to enable change.\n\nEleanor Sawbridge Burton, 2024\n\nKey publications\n\n2022.
