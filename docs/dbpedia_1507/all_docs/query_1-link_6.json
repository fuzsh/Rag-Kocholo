        "text": "The following is a listing of former Secretaries of Commerce:\n\nFirst Secretary of Commerce\n\nThe first Secretary of Commerce, William C. Redfield, was an iron and steel executive and author of a book, The New Industrial Day. The first Secretary of Commerce and Labor was George B. Cortelyou.\n\nLength of Service\n\nThe longest-serving Secretary of Commerce was Herbert C. Hoover, a mining engineer who directed projects in Australia and for the Chinese before his public service career, which culminated in his election as President of the United States. Hoover served almost seven and one-half years. The Department of Commerce headquarters building is named in his honor.\n\nBoth William C. Redfield and Malcolm Baldrige served for more than six years.\n\nEight Secretaries served less than a year.\n\nTwo Secretaries died while in office: Malcolm Baldrige and Ronald H. Brown.\n\nWomen Secretaries\n\nJuanita Kreps, the first woman and the only economist to serve as Secretary, was vice president of Duke University and a labor demographics specialist.\n\nBarbara Franklin was the second woman to serve as Secretary. She was among the first women to graduate from Harvard Business School and served in the administrations of four U.S. presidents. In 1971, she directed the first White House program to recruit women for high-level government jobs.\n\nPenny Pritzker was the third woman to serve as Secretary. Before Secretary Pritzker’s term in government service, she helped found multiple businesses including PSP Capital and the Pritzker Realty Group.\n\nAfrican-American Secretary\n\nRonald Brown was the first African American to serve as Secretary. A lawyer, a negotiator, a pragmatic bridge builder and a past Chairperson of the Democratic National Committee, Brown, unlike many of his predecessors, did not come out of the business community directly.\n\nBrown died in a plane crash while on a trade mission to Croatia and Bosnia on April 3, 1996.\n\nAsian-American Secretaries\n\nNorman Mineta was the first Asian-American Secretary (July 21, 2000-Jan. 19, 2001). Secretary Gary Locke later followed as the second. He resigned August 1, 2011, when he was sworn in as U.S. Ambassador to the People's Republic of China.\n\nOther Offices Held\n\nHenry Wallace served as Vice President of the United States before his appointment as Secretary of Commerce. Three secretaries served in the U.S. Congress. Sinclair Weeks served in the U.S. Senate, and Joshua Alexander served seven terms and Rogers C. B. Morton four terms in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nFour others held top state offices. Luther Hodges was elected governor and lieutenant governor of North Carolina. Charles Sawyer was lieutenant governor of Ohio and Elliot Richardson served as lieutenant governor of Massachusetts. Gary Locke was a two-term governor of the state of Washington, 1997-2005.\n\nRichardson, an attorney, was Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, Secretary of Defense, Attorney General and a U.S. Ambassador before becoming Secretary of Commerce.\n\nW. Averell Harriman and Mickey Kantor also held diplomatic posts before becoming Secretaries of Commerce. Harriman served as U.S. Ambassador to the U.S.S.R. and to Great Britain. Kantor served as the U.S. Trade Representative.\n\nDaniel Roper's 50-year career of government service included positions with the U.S. Tariff Commission, and as Commissioner of Internal Revenue. He also worked for the Census Bureau, which was part of the Department of Commerce when he became Secretary.\n\nYoungest and Oldest Appointees\n\nThe youngest person to be named Secretary was 38-year-old Alexander Trowbridge, an oil company executive who joined the Department as an assistant secretary.\n\nThe oldest to be appointed was Philip Klutznick, 79, who had over 55 years of investment banking and private equity experience.\n\nEducation\n\nMost Secretaries were college graduates, many with degrees from Ivy League universities; but Jesse Jones, the Secretary who directed the Commerce Department's responses to war needs between 1940-1945, received his formal education at a rural schoolhouse in Kentucky.\n\nSecretaries of Commerce and the Years They Served\n\nWilbur L.
