        "text": "VP: The Merciful is a beautifully written, thoughtful, serious novel—though not one without humor—that I think prompts the reader to contemplate larger philosophical questions. I hope our exchange here can get to some of those frankly deep ideas that give this work such depth and beauty.\n\nBut first, can you offer a brief summary of The Merciful? What would you most like people to know about it?\n\nJS: I would describe the book as a morality play about the hit-and-run killing of a bicyclist in Lowcountry South Carolina. The novel is narrated by a writer in Virginia who learns his old college friend is the alleged culprit, and the story is the narrator’s investigation of the crime and the subsequent trial. Like the film Rashomon, it shows multiple angles on the story to try to show a more comprehensive truth.\n\nVP: As you suggest, the novel is told through multiple perspectives of characters who are connected to the terrible accident in which a car hits a young woman biking alone at night on a dark road. We hear from the accused, the prosecuting attorney, the attorney for the defense, the boyfriend of the girl who was killed, and others. All of these different characters live in and around the town of Overlook, South Carolina. The town itself becomes a character of sorts. Can you talk about Overlook and the people who live there? I felt you were making a critique of this type of Southern leisure town that in fact has a darker side to it.\n\nJS: I modeled Overlook on some of the coastal towns near Hilton Head Island, which have seen an incredible amount of growth and change over the past 10 years or so. Until recently, the Lowcountry was quite a poor region in general, but wealthy outsiders have transformed towns like Overlook into something new. I’m fond of the William Gibson quote, “The future is already here. It’s just not evenly distributed.” Likewise, old and new coexist in the South Carolina Lowcountry: gated communities and Publix on one street, trailer parks and Walmart on the next street. So, in the novel, you have the victim, Samantha, from one of the well-to-do neighborhoods and a freshman in college, while her high school boyfriend, Charlie, has a single mom and is selling used cars. Daniel is the Midwesterner living in the simulacrum of the South, whereas the narrator grew up amid the last vestiges of the real thing.\n\nThe writer George Singleton once referred to the “New New South.” The New South refers to the industrial, post-Reconstruction South, and the “New New South” is an odd blend of old Southern culture with a national, homogenized way of being—Starbucks and high-speed internet. In the emerging culture, the “South” feels like it has been commodified. I think we’ve generally lost a sense of authentic local culture and community in America, and in the absence of the thing itself, we’ve packaged it up and offered it for sale. Call it the Pottery Barn aesthetic: craftsman chic, reclaimed barn wood on the wall, a hipster restaurant selling grandma’s biscuits for $5 apiece. I don’t know if I’m critiquing this cultural shift, exactly, but I do think I’m more conscious of it than your average person living in it.\n\nVP: Of all the characters you could have chosen to narrate your story, you pick one who is only tangentially connected to the accident. He is the former college roommate of the accused man, Daniel Hayward. Jay doesn’t live in Overlook and hasn’t seen Daniel in years. And yet, when he hears of the terrible accident that his old friend might have caused, he becomes intrigued by not only by what happened that night on the dark road, but the experience that would necessarily change his friend’s life forever. Jay is drawn to the disaster. Can you talk about how and why you chose Jay as your narrator?\n\nJS: I originally started with the prosecutor, Claire, and her section was in this omniscient voice. It was the first time I’d ever really tried writing in that mode, and I was interested in the idea of voice. One nice thing about writing in omniscience is the narrative can have a little personality. When I got stuck at the end of her section, I started thinking about voice, and about the fiction of fiction—who was the narrator? Where did the voice come from? An omniscient narrator is supposed to be all knowing, but in reality it’s limited by the knowledge and worldview of an invisible, unacknowledged author.\n\nI don’t really know why, but somewhere along the way I decided to give you a peek behind the curtain, and I started over in the first person voice to introduce the narrator. Why was he writing this story? What were the stakes? That helped me get unstuck. I imagine it’s a bit like how an actor feels putting on a character’s mask—the narrator gave me a personality so that it wasn’t me writing about the prosecutor and then the defense attorney. It was this narrator, Jay, making it up.\n\nThat helped me move through the book, character to character, until the end. When I looked up I realized I’d written a book about storytelling in some ways, a book about how narratives are crafted—the narrative in the news about the hit and run, the narrative about the defense attorney’s video scandal, the narrative of the car salesman and his Ponzi scheme, the narrative about brain emulations and whether the world is a simulated reality. It seemed fitting that these crafted narratives would be framed by a meta-narrator, so I kept him.\n\nVP: As I read it, Jay is the Nick Carraway of this story, while poor Daniel Hayward is an unsuccessful Gatsby. Daniel has been raised to think he will be great someday, and even convinces his wife, Francine, of this. Although he marries the woman of his dreams and is able to buy a big, showy house, he’s stagnating in life. Did you think of Daniel in relation to Gatsby? They’re both failed American heroes, after all, and both have distinctly vague morals.\n\nJS: Yes, I think that’s a great observation. It’s been a while since I read The Great Gatsby, but if I’m remembering correctly, it seems like Gatsby’s striving is related to class. Daisy and her crowd are in a posh, upper crust social circle, whereas Gatsby has to do the work to buy his way into their society. That’s an American ideal, that allegedly we are not born in a fixed class system and you can work your way into whoever you want to be, but of course it’s not so simple.\n\nDaniel is born with plenty of advantages, but he’s come to the Lowcountry from Ohio. I suspect everywhere in the South is changing into this generalized American “New New South,” but he went to college in Charleston in the early 2000s, and at that time the Old South class structure still had a grip on the city. It didn’t matter that he was the son of an executive; he was from Ohio and therefore there was a social ceiling. The town of Overlook, a couple hours south, is more New New South, so he can work his way right to the top of the heap, like a Jay Gatsby.\n\nVP: Daniel says he doesn’t remember hitting Samantha on her bike with his car. He’s tipsy and says he stopped and got out and looked around but didn’t see anything. Each of the characters weighs this explanation of the events in their minds—thinking about how they, too, have made mistakes that they haven’t fully taken responsibility for. I think the implication is that many of us are pretty loose with our sense of moral responsibility. We routinely let ourselves off the hook. We forgive ourselves for the places where we cut corners, or say white lies, or cheat in some way. A reader can’t help but ask themselves when reading The Merciful if they, too, are guilty? And if so, of what exactly? Is the biggest moral failing depicted here our own lack of self-awareness?\n\nJS: The title comes from the Beatitudes—“Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.” I certainly wouldn’t call the novel Christian fiction, but I do think a Christian morality and worldview underpins the story. The merciful extend mercy because they understand we are all sinners in need of redemption (“He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her”). I think you’re right that the moral failing throughout is a lack of self-awareness, but I also think it’s a lack of awareness of how narratives shape life, sometimes in dishonest ways. We live in a world where events happen, and then the media decides what is “news,” and then tells us what to think about it. Is it a moral failing to buy into a narrative thrust on you? That’s arguably what Jesus is for. He’s the guy that tells you you’re a hypocritical sinner, and once this truth is revealed to you, you’re on your way to salvation.\n\nVP: One of the sections in the novel is titled “Cancel Culture.” In it, the defense lawyer, Henry Somerville, is caught on video doing something that others might object to. The video is shared widely online and he becomes a pariah of sorts, or at least is suddenly considered suspect by people who don’t actually know him. How does this thread in the novel fit into the main story of Daniel’s unwillingness to accept culpability? Who is the guilty party in this moment?\n\nJS: The defense attorney Henry is at a park one day playing with his dog in a fountain. Somebody films him and uploads an edited clip online that makes it look like he’s abusing the dog, and the clip gets retweeted and goes viral with a hashtag #DogJustice, and it wrecks Henry’s life. I wrote this section when online social justice was just beginning to emerge (before #metoo), but it’s always made me uncomfortable for the way people are put on a trial of public opinion without all the facts, context and analysis you would get in a court hearing.\n\nMy view is that the truth is usually much messier than any of us would like, because it doesn’t fit into a neat narrative. My thesis around writing is that “all stories are lies.” By definition, a story requires a frame, and when you put a frame around an incident, you also create a point of view. That point of view may give you one truth, but it is not usually the whole truth. In the case of Henry and the dog, it’s an outright lie.\n\nI see this incident with the hashtag as a microcosm of the whole novel—or, more precisely, the novel is the opposite of Henry’s viral video. Daniel gets his day in court, and the reader gets to see several angles on the story, including the narrator who is framing the story. The narrator brings his own biases and baggage into the story, as do I as the author, so I don’t think you can ever really get to a complete and objective truth. But, what I hope I’ve done is peel away the onion so you can get a glimpse of how messy reality is, and maybe how we can never really understand it.\n\nVP: Sadly, marriages don’t fare very well in this novel. Daniel’s marriage to Francine is immediately torn asunder when she learns of the accident. The narrator, Jay, also has a loveless and dwindling marriage. The defense lawyer, Henry Somerville, also has a failed marriage. The ailment that causes these marriages to fall apart relates to the characters’ expectations for happiness. They’re restless and have been raised to want more and think they deserve more, perhaps in unreasonable ways. Can you say more about this particular brand of American unhappiness?\n\nJS: Like we discussed with the Gatsby comparison, many of these characters are caught in an American striving, which is a material striving, and the risk is that you become like a dog chasing a car. There’s always another project, another job, another home renovation. It’s when you stop moving that trouble can come in, because then you have to face the reality of your life: the doors that have closed, the opportunities wasted, the roads not taken.\n\nI don’t think it’s coincidence that the story of The Great Gatsby occurs when Gatsby is on the cusp of achieving exactly what he wants. In a different version of the story Daisy might have run away with him, and they would have been miserable together, like a dog that caught the car but didn’t know what to do with it. Similarly, Daniel in my story is at a point in his life where he has this bombshell wife, a high paying job, and a fancy house, and then he goes and sabotages his life.\n\nLikewise, the news that his friend has been arrested of a hit and run pulls the narrator out of his own striving. He looks up from his own life and realizes “there by the grace of God go I.” His friend’s fate jolts him out of his own mindless striving, and I actually think the narrator and his marriage will be fine, now that he’s had this moment of awareness of life.\n\nVP: On a different note, I’d love to know what prompted you to write this novel?\n\nJS: I don’t know if I had any intention in mind, but I can say it’s the book I’m most passionate about because I feel like I was able to show something important about the world. I think one of the biggest dangers of our age, which 2020 has laid bare for us, is our tendency to simplify life into a clean narrative. Language creates narrative, and a narrative can both reveal and obscure. Our soundbite-driven media has taken away our ability to understand this basic reality, which feels to me like it has taken away some of our free will. How can you choose freely if you don’t have all the facts? What I hope this novel does is show how you can interrogate the story behind the story to arrive at a more complete understanding of reality. I believe such an interrogation is a way to reveal not only the truth of any given situation, but a deeper truth about ourselves—and by extension, the interrogation might make us more merciful.\n\nVP: You have two young daughters and work from home (as do we all these days), so of course, I also wonder how and when you managed to write The Merciful? Also, in the last few years you’ve started your own publishing house. An incredible thing to take on while also working full time, parenting, and writing substantial literary works. I’m not sure how you do it. What prompted you to start Haywire Books? And how’s it going these days at the press?\n\nJS: That’s a long story, which I put in a memoir and craft book, So You Want to Be a Novelist (published in October). The short version is that my first novel, The Whiskey Baron, came out with Hub City Press, which is a great press but until recently has only published first novels. Unless you are uncommonly successful, once your debut novel is published you become what’s called a midlist writer—a modest selling novelist without a significant platform—and there aren’t many slots in publishing available for novelists in that position. I know a lot of good writers who are stuck without a publisher, so I started Haywire Books with this idea that I could publish midlist literary fiction writers as a kind of bridge in their career.\n\nIn general, I tend to find debut novels dull and predictable. Having written several novels now, I understand the mindset of what it is like to write a novel, and the wrong turns early career novelists tend to make. I’ve made all those wrong turns myself! Again, this is a generalization, but by the time a novelist has written a few books, they’ve used up all the predictable material. If you can keep your career alive to book three or four, that’s when things start to get interesting. Our publishing industry tends to be star- or debut-driven, so there aren’t many channels for novelists to publish book two, book three, book four. That’s why I started Haywire Books, to provide a channel.\n\nNow, unfortunately, the pandemic killed my business plan. I wrote my model around touring with independent booksellers, particularly in the South, and online events don’t seem to be creating the same sales pop. I’m in a bit of a holding pattern, with the press and my own writing, to see what future there is for literary publishing.\n\nVP: I wish you the best of luck, because you’re a brilliant writer and, as Steve Yarbrough wrote, The Merciful is “a magnificent novel.”\n\nThe five stories in The Beauty of Their Youth are told in different voices, settings, and times. Each is unique and handled with great subtly and originality. I was curious to ask Joyce about her fine collection.\n\nVP: I know that writing is an organic process and our creations can bubble up from many sources, but I wonder how the territory of these stories came to you? And, perhaps more importantly, how you choose the angle from which to tell them?\n\nJH: I would say that three of the five stories came, first of all, from an engagement with—and curiosity about—certain places. In “Everglades City” and in the title story, “The Beauty of Their Youth,” these are places I experienced as a visitor, a tourist—and that’s the case for the stories’ central characters as well. Both of these stories are about an outsider’s view of a place (or places), and also, to some degree, that outsider’s inability to fully grasp and understand the place she’s found herself in. Certainly that’s true for Inge, the young German woman at the center of “Everglades City.” In “The Beauty of Their Youth,” on revisiting Rome and several sites in Greece thirty years after being in there as a college student, the central character, Fran, realizes how limited her understanding of these places—and certain of their inhabitants—was as a younger woman. The other two stories—“A Better Law of Gravity” and “Benedicta, or A Guide to the Artist’s Resume”—began in playfulness, in an effort to play with form, and with certain expectations about short stories and their characters.\n\nIn terms of choosing the angle from which to tell each of these stories, I believe I was always looking for the perspective of a character who seems particularly bewildered—or maybe, by the story’s end, amazed.\n\nVP: Memory plays an important role in these stories. It transports your characters from the present to the past by creating a swirl of time that releases them from a restrictive, linear understanding. Can you talk about how you wanted time and memory to unfold in these stories? What does the past tend to mean for your characters?\n\nJH: I’ve often said that as a writer, I seem to be cursed with an inability to tell a story in a straightforward, linear way. (Another way of saying this, I suppose, is that I’m not enamored of traditional plotting in the writing of fiction.) Maybe this is connected to my own tendency to dip in and out of memories—even very brief, fleeting ones—as I go through each day; this has intensified as I’ve grown older. These memories sometimes originate in a wistful longing for the past, a kind of nostalgia, but often they don’t; the best ones are just images, honestly—the feeling of wind blowing in my face on a rapid downhill ride on my bike as a child, moments of visual or aural wonder during my travels as a younger women. That sort of thing. I like drawing on those moments in imagining and creating characters, and then I guess I like giving my characters a similar sort of delight—or sometimes longing, or even deep sadness—in experiencing these arresting memories that seem to come from nowhere. And so those characters’ experience of time becomes like mine: caught in the inevitable rush forward, grateful for the pauses when memories glimmer in our consciousness.\n\nVP: In the title story, a mother and her college-age daughter return to Greece and Italy where the mother had travelled when she was her daughter’s age. The daughter has an understanding that as American tourists they’re on the outside of the worlds they visit, but the mother only more slowly comes to understand this as the truth of her past is revealed. In another story, a German tourist veers away from her travel plans to live in the Everglades with a man she’s just met. Again, she’s an outsider looking into another country that only slowly reveals itself and changes her. Can you share your thoughts about the territories of culture and time that start out opaque in your stories but become less so as the stories unfold?\n\nJH: This is such an interesting question; I love the idea of “territories of culture and time that start out opaque . . . but become less so.” Partly I think this is simply a function of growing older, and recognizing one’s youthful naivete (as for Fran in “The Beauty of Their Youth”). But it’s also acknowledging the ways in which one’s desires can muddle one’s thinking about and perception of the world; that’s the case for Inge in “Everglades City,” but also, I’d say, for other characters in the collection—FJ in “A Better Law of Gravity,” Joan in “Polymorphous,” the Painter Van Lloyd in “Benedicta.” I’m glad to realize as I write this answer that not all of my characters who recognize this about themselves are middle-aged women like me!\n\nVP: Your story Benedicta is told through an unusual and inventive structure of an artist’s resume. I’m curious how you landed on that as a way to show not just the career of the artist, but the arc of his life, especially in relation to other historical artists.\n\nHappiness is in. Advice on how to achieve it fills volumes on bookstore shelves. Some of these books rely on scientific research. Others refer to the wisdom of the ages and sacred texts. They urge us to pursue ambitious life goals. Or jump off the hamster wheel and ditch our career goals entirely and relish simple pleasures instead: eating well, breathing deeply, meditation and exercise. Hunker down at home with those we love, or embark on daring adventures to distant shores. Face our fears. Do our bucket lists. Ditch all lists. Give up. Give in. Give back. Don’t give a fuck. Or fuck a lot. All in the pursuit of happiness.\n\nThe titles alone promise verifiably achievable outcomes: The Happiness Curve. The Happiness Project. The Happiness Hypothesis. 10% Happier. While others offer a looser, more free-form approach: Stumbling on Happiness. The Art of Happiness. Authentic Happiness. Each promises something hopeful, lasting and, most of all, real.\n\nAnd yet, in my way of thinking, happiness can best be found outside the realm of reality. Let me explain. Over the course of more decades than I’d like to admit, I have reliably found happiness through reading and writing fiction. I’m convinced that happiness is unconsciously absorbed into the bloodstream through words—words that transport us into the imagined hearts and minds of others. Fiction offers a window into the human soul and psyche. If done well, the inner lives of characters remind us of what it means to be human.\n\nWhat we read doesn’t necessarily need to be happy. The literature I was raised on reveled in quite the opposite. Madame Bovary is a tragedy. Anna Karenina, a disastrous tale. In Chekov, you can search a long time for a happy ending because the characters are so flawed. They are vain and puffed up with self-importance, blind to their own follies, crippled by unrequited love, and often just plain silly. In other words, they are human.\n\nReading about such weak and lovelorn characters has helped me all my life to stay alert to my own flaws. The more current characters in A Little Life swim in their own unhappiness, while in The Sympathizer the protagonist remains stoical in the face of his life’s conundrums. Great literature of every era explores human imperfection and sorrow, helping us to recognize that our own lives are more balanced by comparison.\n\nAny reader would understand the recent scientific study that proved that empathy is increased by reading fiction. That seems like a no-brainer to the bookish set. It went without saying that reading made our lives richer; our ability to love deeper; our understanding of the human condition more profound. It feels silly articulating what my parent’s generation and all the generations before took for granted. But in today’s climate, while so many other voices are screaming for attention, it’s worth remembering that reading a good work of fiction is not only not a waste of time, but a deeply human activity. One that, through the decades, has helped us to know who we are.\n\nAs a writer, penning fiction has also helped me to know myself and, therefore, as the philosophers opined, to know happiness. The stories in my collection, Shelf Life of Happiness, are about characters of widely different ages and genders, told in voices quite unlike my own. They aren’t autobiographical, but like many fiction writers, I transform what I have experienced into imagined truth. This process of unconsciously inventing from life has helped me “process” painful moments. When something is bothering me, I make up stories to tame it and ultimately let it go.\n\nAt a rocky moment in my marriage, I traveled to Rome with my husband and two children and walked on the literally rocky terrain of the Forum, teetering on the edge of marital discord and even rupture. Not long after our return, I sat at my desk and in my story, Crying in Italian, I created an unhinged wife and mother who wanders off from her family and is seduced by the sight of young lovers in the Roman ruins. She longs to be free of the constraints of her life—jettisoning her husband and children for what she imagines is a more passionate existence. She literally stumbles and, without giving away the ending, finds herself on the precipice. The writing of that story helped me with my footing in my marriage and my life back home. It didn’t solve my problems, but by imagining a woman who risks all, I didn’t have to. And dear reader, I’m happily married to this day.\n\nWriting my long story Her Mother’s Garden, which was also inspired by real events, helped me through the loss of my parents. Some years ago, they sold the house where I had grown up and it was subsequently torn down. But worse, the stunning garden my mother had cultivated for over forty years was bulldozed. Rhododendrons heavy with magenta blooms, pink climbing roses crowning an arbor, royal blue iris standing at attention beside a shaded pool where golden carp circled at dusk were all relegated to memory. Then came the illnesses, the falls, the strokes, and finally, death, first my father and then my mother. Like other members of my family, I tried my best to process this period of sorrow. But only by writing a story about a daughter’s attachment to her mother’s garden, and the sad experience of watching her parents age and her childhood recede, was I able to move forward.\n\nWriting this story hollowed me out and left me feeling spent, but the surprising end helped me to stand again on my own two feet. After many drafts, I came to realize that the daughter needed something specific to happen to make her understand she must leave the haunted landscape of her childhood. Nudged off the garden path, she finally steps outside the cloistered loveliness of her mother’s garden—as did I.\n\nAfter finishing that story, I felt quite different, not only about my past, but my future. I hope readers will feel similarly when they read it. A good work of fiction should leave us better prepared for what we face off the page—not in a prescriptive way, but by enlarging our human understanding. The tales we read, and those we write, should be rich with a dark, nourishing soil—to continue the garden metaphor—that allows us to thrive and grow upward into sunlight.\n\nAccording to Professor Laurie Santos in her PSYC 157: Psychology and the Good Life—the most popular class in the history of Yale University—genetics shape roughly 50 percent of our chances for happiness, while ten percent is dictated by circumstances beyond our control. But the final 40 percent is determined by our thoughts and attitudes. Novels and stories that infuse themselves into our consciousness and reshape how we see the world can tip that crucial 40 percent towards happiness.\n\nThough, in the end, perhaps simple happiness is one of the least rewards of reading and writing fiction. A deeper, more profound understanding of life through literature can outweigh all of this year’s self-help bestsellers promising easy rewards. For as we go in search of greater meaning in life, we can do no better than to open a good book of fiction and let ourselves remember who we are at our most complex and real.\n\nVP: In This Ground is set in a graveyard and tells the story of a former indie-rocker who takes a job as a gravedigger in the cemetery where a former fellow band member is buried. What led you to choose such an unusual setting for a novel and profession for a protagonist?\n\nBC: Cemeteries have fascinated me since I was a kid. Back then, a friend and I would wander the graveyard near our homes, reading the names on the stones out loud, and making up stories about the lives we imagined these people to have led.\n\nThe idea of cemeteries containing countless stories lingered at the back of my mind for a long time, surfacing a few years ago as an idea for a story collection or novel, one that would bring together the tales of people who are buried in a particular cemetery or who have some other business there.\n\nIn my early days of working on the manuscript that became In This Ground, I had the idea of a gravedigger, Ben, being the central character. To me, Ben felt like the perfect connection between the living and dead within the world of the cemetery where he works. He tries to do his best by those buried there, by their friends and loved ones, and by members of the larger community.\n\nAt the same time, Ben is dealing with struggles of his own, the most daunting of which is his guilt over the death of the former bandmate who’s buried where he works.\n\nVP: What kind of research did you do for this novel? Any haunting graveyard experiences you’d like to share?\n\nBC: I ended up researching several topics for the novel—among them, the day-to-day responsibilities of gravediggers and other cemetery workers; green burials, which the central character, Ben, hopes to offer; and the challenges of keeping a non-profit cemetery financially and infrastructurally viable.\n\nThe most fun I had during the research process was shadowing a gravedigger, Bobby Burke, for a day. Although I personally haven’t had any haunting or strange cemetery experiences, Bobby definitely has. Especially at night, his cemetery has been the site of everything from drug deals to voodoo rituals. The paraphernalia of these rituals—headless chickens, rum bottles, burned-out candles, etc.—are left for grounds workers to clean up in the morning.\n\nI also had a lot of fun researching the controversy surrounding the exhumation of a renowned nineteenth-century vagrant, a.k.a. Leatherman, in Ossining, New York. This dispute ended up inspiring a plot strand in the novel.\n\nTo give you some background, in 2010, the Ossining Historical Society, which maintains the cemetery where Leatherman was buried, announced plans to move his grave, which was believed to be dangerously close to a busy highway. The Historical Society also wanted to have Leatherman’s remains scientifically investigated to determine, among other things, his national origins.\n\nBut the plans to exhume Leatherman and examine his remains ran into huge opposition from those who believed that these actions would constitute serious violations of his privacy and dignity. The opponents’ arguments really fascinated me, and I loved how they got at the notion that entitlement to privacy—and to respect for one’s personal space—doesn’t necessary expire upon death.\n\nI put Ben at the center of a similar controversy, because it really tests his beliefs about what it means to be doing his best by both the living and the dead: what he sees as his most important mission at the cemetery.\n\nVP: Your previous novel, Marion Hatleyis an historical novel set in small town Pennsylvania in 1931. Did that story require a lot of research as well? How different was it for you to write about a time period outside your experience and a story set in the present?\n\nBC: Yes, that novel also required a good deal of research. Because the title character, a seamstress, creates an innovative corset over the course of the novel, I had to investigate the status of foundation garments—and what might be considered innovations in them—at the time of the novel.\n\nAlso, because another central character experiences flashbacks to his experiences in World War I, I spent a lot of time reading about the experiences of veterans of that war.\n\nFor me, one of the challenges of writing a novel set in 1931 was making sure that characters’ language and mannerisms were appropriate for the time. That meant staying on the lookout for anachronisms of every kind. But the greatest challenge I faced writing Marion Hatleyalso applied to In This Ground: trying to tell a compelling story while doing justice to characters’ interior lives and struggles.\n\nVP: What types of novels do you tend to like to read? Does it matter if they are historical or contemporary? I’m just curious what feeds your own writing.\n\nBC: This ties right into my previous point in that I’m most taken with novels and story collections that, while telling a great story, take a deep dive into characters’ interior lives. (To my mind, the master of this kind of deep dive is Alice Munro.) It doesn’t matter to me whether a work is historical or contemporary.\n\nVP: Tell us how you started Small Press Picks, your much-respected blog that reviews books from independent presses. How does it enlighten you as a writer, not to mention as a reader?\n\nBC: Small Press Picks grew out of a few different concerns I had back in 2013, when I founded the site—and those concerns remain today. Mainly, it’s gotten harder and harder for most fiction writers to get reviews, but it’s especially challenging for those whose works are published by indie presses (as I can attest myself). At the same time, indie presses are putting out loads of compelling, thought-provoking literature, and they’re willing to take chances on new voices and on stories and subjects that diverge from the mainstream.\n\nThrough Small Press Picks, I’m trying to play a very small part in supporting those efforts and to draw some much-deserved attention to indie presses and their authors.\n\nEverything I read for Small Press Picks enlightens me in some way as a writer. For example, although my narrative style tends to be more conventional than experimental, I think some of the more experimental books I’ve read for SPP have pushed me toward testing new approaches to time sequence, point of view, and other aspects of the craft.\n\nVP: What else would you like us to know about In This Ground? I’m excited to read it and I want others to be psyched, too!\n\nBC: I can’t think of any other big points to make. But if anyone would like more details about In This Ground,my writing challenges and adventures, or my other books, they can visit my website: https://www.bethcastrodale.com/.\n\nFinally, thanks so much for your kind words about In This Ground, Virginia. And thanks for taking the time to interview me!\n\nAbout Beth:\n\nBeth Castrodale has worked as a newspaper reporter and book editor. Her novel Marion Hatley (Garland Press, 2017) was a finalist for a Nilsen Prize for a First Novel from Southeast Missouri State University Press, and an excerpt from her latest novel, In This Ground, was a shortlist finalist for a William Faulkner – William Wisdom Creative Writing Award. (In This Ground will be published by Garland Press in September 2018.) Beth recommends literary fiction on her website SmallPressPicks.com, and she has published stories in such journals as Printer’s Devil Review, The Writing Disorder, and Mulberry Fork Review.\n\nOrder In This Ground at: http://garlandpress.com/store/#!/In-This-Ground/p/105597774/category=0\n\nI’m not sure what helpful advice I have, ultimately, beyond keep at it. Identify the people who believe in your writing and don’t dismiss their kindnesses. Stay part of the writing community; don’t run away in shame or terror. Start new projects: I worked on my literary blog; I started an online journal for previously published work (Redux); I started a neighborhood prompt writing group. Change up your writing—your style, your content; push some boundaries and go for broke. Read excellent books.\n\nOr not. Do none of those things.\n\nI wish there was a clear path through those tough times. I only know what I did, and I’m not sure if what I did was helpful or was just what I did. “Write” is, I think, the answer to any question I face, so in retrospect, I’m most proud of myself for continuing to write.\n\nVP: The impetus to write the stories in This Angel on My Chest seems particularly personal. All stories are somewhat autobiographical, if not in subject matter, than in feeling or thought. But your stories cut close to the bone of your own experience. Can you describe how you came to write them, or what the process of writing them meant to you?\n\nLP: I didn’t really think I would write overtly about Robb’s death; I had written one story shortly after he died (“Ten Things”), and I had written about the grieving process in my novel A Year and a Day, which is set in Iowa and is about a 15-year-old girl whose mother committed suicide and the year that follows that tragedy. So I pretty much thought I was done…until a breakfast conversation at VCCA (where you and I met!!). I was chatting with a poet who was teaching a class about the literature of subcultures, and I thought it would be an interesting writing assignment to try writing about a subculture. In my studio, I scribbled out some ideas and once I saw “young widow support group,” I knew that would be hard for me to write about, and that I must. That story became “The Circle,” and as I was working at it while on the residency, I started keeping a long list of other memories and incidents from that time in my life that I wanted to write about. At the heart of each story was “one true and hard thing” from my experience, so yes, this is a highly personal book.\n\nVP: Writing seems to have been a part of your recovery from loss. And winning the award for this third book must have felt like a great affirmation of your efforts as a writer, but also as a confirmation that when we write from the heart we’re more apt to deeply connect with readers. Your book certainly does that, and has been successful as a result. Does success change how you think about your work? Was there freedom in writing those stories when you weren’t sure they would be widely read? Have your ambitions changed over this period—can you take a breather now, or do you feel more pressure to capitalize on your recent success?\n\nLP: I mostly wrote this book in secret, which I think was immensely freeing. My long-time writing group was dissolving, so they read only a couple of the stories. I felt that what I was trying to do—link a collection of stories through incident, with each story about a young husband who has died—was kind of an insane project. Who would do this? How could I make such a book work? Because it was such an unconventional approach, I didn’t want to hear voices in my head asking why I was doing this or how it wouldn’t work—or offering their solutions. I guess I sensed that the only way to figure out the puzzle of the book was to write it. That was scary, though, because for much of the time I had no idea what I was doing.\n\nIt’s hard for me to speak of “success.” To my mind, the book was a success without the external validation: it was the book I wanted to read after Robb died. Obviously, no book is perfect, but I found my way through the writing and emerged with the book I would have wanted to read after Robb died. But…I loved winning that big prize!\n\nI’m just thinking now that the content of the book is very personal, as I noted, but also because the press takes the book as the judge has selected it, there’s no further editing. So the book is also personal in that it truly is a book written by ME, with very little outside input.\n\nI’m not sure I would ever take a breather as a writer—there’s always another story to explore. And in our secret hearts, don’t we all dream of a shelf of books with our name on the spines? In the beginning, when I was growing up, I couldn’t imagine anything more remarkable than having a book I’d written in a library.\n\nVP: How has being a teacher of writing helped you with your own writing? You have many dedicated students whose work you’ve helped shape. What does it feel like for you when they succeed?\n\nLP: What I love most about teaching is being surrounded by smart people who want to talk about writing. My favorite kind of class is the kind where there are lots of questions, especially the sort of questions that make me think hard and run off to go research the answer for them. I love when I feel challenged by a class that wants to know more and to understand the craft more deeply. (I’m a member of the core fiction faculty at the Converse low-residency MFA program and I teach fiction in the MA in writing program at Johns Hopkins University.)\n\nVP: What are you working on now? And any other advice for aspiring writers?\n\nLP: I have a new novel that I need to re-re-revise for my agent; it’s set in 1980s Chicago, about a complicated female friendship between two college girls. And beyond that, there’s another novel dancing in my head, and I hope to get to that one this fall, when I’ll be in Scotland at a writing residency. (I can hardly believe that’s for real!!)\n\nI love to give advice and could offer aspiring writers a million thoughts. But I’ll keep it simple here and quote one of my favorite writers and writing teachers, Richard Bausch: Write until something surprises you. That’s when you know it’s good.\n\nAfter the great success of his debut novel, Fobbit, I wanted to check in with David Abrams to see what he's working on next. I've come to rely on his daily book blog, The Quivering Pen, and when he stopped posting earlier this year so he could focus on his own writing, I grew curious. David is such a vital and generous presence in the literary community, I was intrigued to learn how he manages to do it all--pen books and oversee an important and much-read blog. Here is his answer to the time management conundrum that all writers face: I'm a people pleaser.\n\nBefore you go saying, \"Hey, that's great!\" let me stop you by saying, People Pleasing has ruined my soul. Oh sure, it's all well and good on the surface: putting others first, altruism, the wisdom of New Testament Bible verses, etc., etc. But all that Others First philosophy means I put my own needs in second, third, or last place. I spend so much time thinking-slash-worrying about what others think and feel and need that it leaves precious little \"Me Time.\" (To my dear wife who might be reading this: please note that I will ALWAYS put you first--just wanted to clear the air on that.) Whenever I am reading another author's manuscript for a blurb, championing a new writer's novel on Twitter, or spending hours writing a Quivering Pen blog post about literary trends, it means I'm not working on my own writing. Don't get me wrong: I blurb/Tweet/blog because I want to and because I feel passionate about what I'm reading. But the truth is, no original words of mine are being written during this time.\n\nSo, when you ask how I prioritize my work, my response will probably be: \"as an afterthought.\" Occasionally, I'll go through bouts of creativity where I'll shake off this malignant thinking and get down to work on the manuscript waiting, dusty, in the bowels of my hard drive. The truth is, those one-off periods of inspiration need to be the rule not the exception. I'm trying to get better. I really am.\n\nI thought I was halfway to the cure at the beginning of this year when I nailed up the shutters on my blog, The Quivering Pen, saying that I needed to Blog Less, Write More. So long, and thanks for all the fish.\n\nThat golden period lasted for about four months. I tinkered around on the novel--long overdue to my editor--which I've been trying to write for two years, and I started three short stories, which remain in tattered fragments on my computer. I did a lot of staring out of my office window and distracted myself by reading books by Michael Chabon, John Kennedy Toole, and Emily St. John Mandel which I'd been putting off for far too long. I drank multiple cups of coffee, I stared out the window, I tinkered.\n\nThen I snuck back to the blog like an adulterous husband drunk-dialing his mistress in the middle of the night.\n\nMy problem is that in addition to being a People Pleaser, I'm also a card-carrying member of the Procrastinator's Club and am professor emeritus at the College of Spread-Too-Thin. I take on too much and end up doing none of it to perfection.\n\nI suspect I'm not alone at these clubs (I see several of you nodding your head in sympathetic recognition). It's comforting to be in a society of many, I suppose--but warning lights are flashing red right now: comfort leads to complacency, complacency is the first rest stop on the highway to hell.\n\nI'm sorry, but I must leave you now. I must get to work--the selfish, ego-driven work of writing my own damn words. How to get there? I don't know, really. The creative life comes with no owners manual, no instructions to insert Tab A into Slot B. Giving up the blog, saying \"no\" to blurb requests, taking a Twitter vacation--those aren't the remedies (I've already tried all of those things). Sleeping less and rising earlier in the morning? Maybe, but I'm already throwing off the covers at 4:30; don't know if I can crack open my eyelids any earlier than that. Making the novel-in-progress the first thing I turn to in the morning? That's a start. Better time management? Of course.\n\nIf I'm honest with myself, if I look the mirror man in the eye, I'd have to say that the best first step is moving past the fear: the fear of failure, the fear of letting others down, the fear of wasting time at the keyboard. Instead, what I really need to be afraid of is failing to please myself. That's it.
