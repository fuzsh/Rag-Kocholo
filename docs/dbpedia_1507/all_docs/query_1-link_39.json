        "text": "Political Nature of Public Health Law and Policy\n\nAlthough public health law and policy are not identical, they are linked at a deep level. Gostin defines the former as\n\nthe study of the legal powers and duties of the state, in collaboration with its partners … to ensure the conditions for people to be healthy … and of the limitations on the power of the state to constrain for the common good the autonomy, privacy, liberty, proprietary, and other legally protected interests of individuals.5(p4)\n\nThis definition captures one element common to both broad and narrow models of public health: its identification of state actors as primary agents of public health law. Such actors operate through all 3 branches of government, and each level is politicized. Thus, Eleanor Kinney observes that\n\nin any matter in which the government takes the lead, politics are implicated, thus inevitably introducing considerations other than pure science into the resolution of questions of scientific policy.12(p212)\n\nYet, however important cases and statutes are, the significance of the regulatory apparatus for public health law cannot be overstated. Edward Richards even goes so far as to argue that public health law literally is administrative law.13 Organizations that constitute the modern administrative state include formal regulatory bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration and state boards of health, but they also include so-called quasilegal bodies, which are often private actors that have a significant influence on public health law and policy (e.g., the Joint Commission).\n\nIf legal and quasilegal bodies charged with regulating public health law and policy are significant if not exclusive sources of such law and policy, some important implications follow for evaluating the concern over the politicization of public health. This is because it is indisputable that regulatory regimes are deeply and fundamentally enmeshed with political processes, concerns, and pathways.14–16 As Kenneth Meier observes,\n\n[r]egulatory policy is a result of complex interaction of industry, consumers, regulators, political elites, and the environment in which they operate.17(pxv)\n\nGiven this interaction, suggesting that any corpus of regulatory law or policy is apolitical defies credulity.\n\nIf American regulatory processes are fundamentally political in nature, the semantics of the claim that public health policy ought not be politicized are puzzling. How can an ineliminably political process avoid politicization? As Leigh Turner explains in the context of science policy,\n\n[i]n democratic social orders, the formation of science policy is an ethical and political process … . Policy formation … include[s] contestable judgments, the search for credibility and legitimation, the marshalling and critique of evidence, and often rhetorical appeals to the public good.18(p35–36)\n\nEmpirical confirmation of Turner's account is evident in the history of public health in the Western world (especially in Great Britain and the United States), which demonstrates a tight connection between public health and politics throughout the 19th century.\n\nThe History of Politics in Public Health Policy\n\nIn the 19th century, as in the 20th century and now, larger political disputes shaped the policies and priorities of public health movements. In Great Britain, whereas figures like Engels and Scottish public health reformer W. P. Alison urged collective social action to ameliorate the devastating social and economic conditions of the 19th-century urban poor, the Chadwickians narrowed the scope of the public health platform considerably by focusing simply on the poisons thought to inhabit filth (for which sanitation was the obvious policy remedy). As Christopher Hamlin has shown, Edwin Chadwick was primarily motivated by a desire to preserve existing social and class hierarchies in the form of the 1834 New Poor Law, not to overturn them or flatten the social gradient of health.19 Similarly, Simon Szreter has demonstrated that in the mid- to late-Victorian era, when free market ideals and classical economic liberalism dominated civic discourse, the political climate precluded any intensive efforts on the part of the central government to invest extensive capital in sanitary and public health improvements.20 That is, relative to other priorities the British polity simply did not value public health interventions enough to take collective action, and Szreter emphasizes that the lack of action was for want of neither sufficient understanding of the causes of disease nor technical capacity to intervene.20\n\nNot coincidentally, Szreter argues, during the several decades in the mid-19th century when organized and collective public health interventions were politically untenable, demographic historians have documented shocking mortality rates in British cities concomitant with the disruptions posed by urbanization and industrialization.20 Szreter explains that subsequent demographic changes in the increasing numbers of working urban poor combined with enfranchisement led to the rise of local government structures whose augmented political power was fundamental to the public health improvements of the ensuing decades.20 The key point is that the British polity's earlier eschewal of intensive public health policy reforms and interventions was every bit as political and value driven as were the subsequent and intensive local and municipal public health efforts.\n\nPolitics and political concerns therefore deeply shaped and influenced the course of public health policy in 19th-century Britain, and there is no reason specific to the history of public health in the United States to think that it escapes the tight linkage between political variables and public health policies and priorities. The same class-based and moralist dynamic that animated leading figures in the British public health movement is evident in American reformers. John Duffy observes that for Lemuel Shattuck\n\nand most of his contemporaries, the basic problem with the poor lay… in their lack of moral fiber; hence a function of government was to teach them the laws of nature and to raise their moral level.21(p99)\n\nShattuck's focus on the dearth of moral fiber among the indigent was one reason his ideas were readily accepted by US physicians, who had “never doubted” its lack.21 Similarly, although second-generation American public health advocates perceived germs as a common enemy that social groups and classes ought to unite against, public health programs were saturated with ethnic, racial, and class prejudices.22–24 Although this saturation shows that political underpinnings of public health policies are not necessarily just, it also demonstrates the irreducibly political nature, for better or sometimes for worse, of those policies and priorities.\n\nBut the political nature of public health policy goes well beyond class and ideological influences to the very understandings of disease itself.16 For example, Margaret Humphreys documents how 19th-century communities in the American South often preferred the miasmatic theory to the contagionist model of disease because the latter account would imply the corresponding policy of quarantine, which had significant political and commercial consequences.25 Charles Rosenberg observes the same phenomenon as to cholera epidemics in both America and Europe during the 19th century.26,27 Thus, political economies strongly influenced both the causal attribution of disease and the attendant policies enacted to prevent and curb epidemics when they occurred. The point is that political entanglements colored the acquisition and interpretation of scientific facts at a deep level, as well as their translation into public health policy.\n\nIn addition, priority setting in public health research is also political and politicized. David Oshinsky's history of polio in 20th-century America explores the political pressures that resulted in enormous national expenditures on polio research.28 As terrible an illness as polio is, it is telling that according to Oshinsky, in 1954 the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis raised $66.4 million to support polio research, which had a prevalence of 100 000 cases. By contrast, combining the amounts raised by the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the National Association for Mental Health, and the Arthritis Foundation yields a sum of $37.3 million, although the combined prevalence of cancer, cardiovascular disease, mental illness, and arthritis in 1954 was almost 32 million cases.28 Of course, the enormous gap between allocation of research dollars and disease burden is as much a problem now as then,29 but Oshinsky's point is precisely that powerful political factors—including the immense political shadow of Franklin Roosevelt himself—drove the intense national interest in funding and researching polio although a variety of other chronic illnesses was undoubtedly more prevalent and more incident across the whole population (and, hence, arguably of higher priority).\n\nHistorical analysis of changing models of public health also shows the significance of politics and political concerns to public health law and policy. One reason the survey of this connection by Fairchild et al. is so important is that it shows how the 20th- and 21st-century decisions to avoid the kinds of interventionalist approaches that in large part characterized 19th-century public health activities is itself political in nature.2 These decisions were and remain driven by a host of diverse political concerns of exactly the kind that Turner notes is a feature of pluralistic, democratic societies.2,18 As Fairchild et al. suggest, individualist models tend to dominate American practices of public health, health education, and health promotion.2 Such models are discursive products of the highly individualist political culture in the United States,30–32 just as more collectivist models of public health practice and policy in, for example, Sweden and Japan are inextricably tied to the peculiar culture, values, and history of the respective polities in those nations. Thus, the argument that public health practices should avoid calls for broad-based social reform because such activities run the risk of politicization is, ironically, a political argument to the core."
