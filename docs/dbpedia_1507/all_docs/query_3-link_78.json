        "text": "Austin Alvis is the President & Chief Development Officer of NewQuest, responsible for leading strategic initiatives and day-to-day management of NewQuest’s development, construction, and asset management activities. Austin joined NewQuest in 2015 and was previously Vice President of Brokerage and a Development Partner with NewQuest, where he was responsible for procurement and oversight of development projects in the Texas market. Prior to NewQuest, Austin began his career at BOK Financial (Bank of Texas), underwriting commercial lending relationships in Houston.\n\nAustin is an active member of the International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC), the Advisory Board of the Houston Region Business Coalition (HRBC), and the Board of Directors of the Fort Bend Economic Development Council.\n\nAustin earned a B.A. in Economics from Southwestern University and an M.B.A. from Rice University.\n\nSteven D. Alvis is the co-founder and managing partner of NewQuest. He took a leave of absence from Texas A&M Veterinary School and started Quest Properties in 1985 as the savings and loan crisis began. Alvis sold REO portfolios for failed savings and loans and accumulated approximately 40 shopping centers in Texas.\n\nLater, Alvis utilized his real estate experience to begin building retail developments, including the first 24 Hour Fitness in the market as well as Cinemark’s first all-stadium seating theater in 1993. NewQuest still represents Cinemark today, more than thirty years later.\n\nIn 2001, Alvis combined talents with Jay Sears, forming NewQuest Properties, to develop grocery-anchored and power centers. NewQuest Properties soon became Albertson’s largest developer, and as Kroger acquired Albertson’s locations, NewQuest Properties became Kroger’s single largest developer in Texas. Still today, NewQuest develops Kroger anchored centers in Texas and Louisiana, along with other well-known anchor tenants such as Target, Walmart, HEB, Dick’s Sporting Goods, EoS Fitness, TopGolf, and more than 80 national, regional, and local tenants throughout Texas and the Southwest. Having developed over $4.5 billion in shopping centers, NewQuest is the largest privately-held shopping center developer in Texas.\n\nAlvis received his bachelor’s degree from Texas A&M University. He is currently a member of the Young President’s Organization (YPO - GOLD), the Chief Executives Organization (CEO), and the International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC.) He was appointed by Lt. Governor Dan Patrick in 2018 to the Texas Facilities Commission, and later by Governor Greg Abbott to Chairman of the TFC. In March 2023, Governor Abbott appointed Alvis to the Texas Transportation Commission.\n\nAlvis is an active owner and developer of The Clubs at Houston Oaks. He and his wife Marci have two sons, Austin and Andrew. Austin joined NewQuest in 2015 after receiving his MBA from Rice University, and now serves as NewQuest’s President. Andrew is a graduate of LSU, joined NewQuest in 2017, and now serves as Senior Vice President for the company. Alvis and his family spend some of their spare time skiing in Colorado and at their cattle ranch in Las Vegas, New Mexico.\n\nAs co-founder and Managing Partner of NewQuest, Jay K. Sears focuses on growing the NewQuest platform through new development, acquisitions, and strategic opportunities, alongside managing key client relationships. A 40+ year veteran of the commercial real estate industry, Sears has actively been involved in the building of over 130 retail projects throughout Texas and the Southwest.\n\nIn 1996, Sears founded Sears Realty Company, a commercial brokerage and development firm that developed, managed, and leased numerous grocery-anchored shopping centers throughout the greater Houston area. Sears Realty was formed in response to the site selection and development needs of Sears’s grocery and retail clients, brokering or developing numerous transactions involving Albertsons, HEB, Kroger, Walgreens, Petco, Rice Epicurean Markets, 24 Hour Fitness, among many others. The company flourished and in 2001, Sears merged with Quest Properties, forming NewQuest Properties. Today, NewQuest is the largest privately-held shopping center developer in Texas, having developed over $4.5 billion in retail and shopping center projects.\n\nSears received a B.B.A. from Baylor University in 1982. He is a member of the International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC), a member of the Urban Land Institute, and a member of the Rice Design Alliance. Aside from real estate, Sears has spent many years working on micro-finance, community development and water wells in Africa through Opportunity International and Living Water. Currently, Sears is focused locally and principally on education by providing scholarships to under-served students at Liberty High School and Eight Million Stories, in addition to supporting local organizations AVDA, Brighter Bites, Toys Fore Kids, TEAM Catapult, and The Forensic Center of Excellence (TXFNE). Sears enjoys traveling extensively and is a bit of a fitness nut, competing in Masters Track & Field.\n\nDean Lane joined NewQuest as a Partner in 2003. He plays a critical role on NewQuest’s development team, working on the design, tenant-mix, and construction of over 75 projects. With a portfolio comprising more than five million square feet of gross leasable area over the last several years, his major projects include town centers such as Sherman, Cy-Fair, Brazos, Victory Lakes, Hutto, Creekside, Stone Hill, Stone Park, Pflugerville, and Aliana.\n\nThe primary focus of Dean’s career has been on retail tenant representation, representing companies such as Kohl’s, Oshman’s/Sports Authority, Eye Masters, Ross Dress For Less, Sears Specialty Group, PETSMART, Petco, J.C. Penney, Ulta Cosmetics, CompUSA, Toys R Us, Golf Galaxy, Robins Bros. and The Gap Concepts. During his tenure at Dick’s Sporting Goods, he was named “Master Broker” for his successful track record managing several of the company’s major city markets including Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana.\n\nDuring his career, Dean has completed numerous lease transactions for his clients, ranging from 5,000 – 150,000 square feet. One of Dean’s largest transactions completed in recent years was the 138-acre tract of land sale to CBL REIT for the 800,000-square-foot Pearland Town Center Mall that opened in 2008. Previously a Vice President and Partner of Boyd Page & Associates from 1991 – 2003, Dean’s career started in the real estate industry with CB Commercial Real Estate Group in 1984. He is a member of the International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC) and a graduate of Texas A&M University. In his spare time, Dean is with his wife Regina and their two daughters, Halle and Jesse, and volunteers for the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.\n\nKyle brings 20 years of legal real estate knowledge and experience to NewQuest. As a partner, he is responsible for coordinating legal affairs, and participates in all aspects of new projects including land acquisition, creating structure of ownership/development entities, solving development issues, negotiating tenant leases, and negotiating construction and permanent financing for projects.\n\nPrior to NewQuest, Kyle joined Quest Properties in 2001 as Senior Partner focusing on all legal aspects of the firm’s real estate transactions. Before joining Quest Properties, Kyle spent nine years at the Houston law firm of Nathan, Sommers, Lippman, Jacobs & Gorman as a Partner, and prior to that, he worked in the Houston office of the Dallas-based law firm of Winstead, Sechrest & Minick under the same title.\n\nKyle received his Bachelor of Business Administration degree from Southern Methodist University in 1977, specializing in Real Estate Finance, and received his J.D. degree from the University of Texas Law School in 1980.\n\nAs a former practicing lawyer, Kyle is a member of the American Bar Association, the State Bar of Texas, and the Houston Bar Association. In addition, he is an active member of the International Council of Shopping Centers, as well as past President and member of the Board of Directors for Lakeside Country Club."
