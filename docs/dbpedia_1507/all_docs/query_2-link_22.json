        "text": "Wells v. Roper\n\nNo. 103\n\nArgued January 2, 1918\n\nDecided March 18, 1918\n\n246 U.S. 335\n\nSyllabus\n\nThe First Assistant Postmaster General, in accordance with a decision of the Postmaster General, undertook to terminate an existing contract for automobile mail service at Washington, D.C., to make place for a similar service to be conducted by the Department under a special appropriation, his action being based upon the supposed authority of the contract itself and being purely official, discretionary, and within the scope of his duties. Held that a suit to restrain him from annulling the contract and from interfering with its further performance was in effect a suit against the United States, and was therefore properly dismissed.\n\n44 App.D.C. 276 affirmed.\n\nThe case is stated in the opinion."
