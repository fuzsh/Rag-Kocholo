        "text": "[Enclosure]\n\nThe Director of the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce (Dye) to the Secretary of Commerce (Roper)\n\nMemorandum\n\nThe American Foreign Insurance Association, which is composed of American insurance companies engaged in the insurance business in foreign countries, has been perturbed by a bill introduced in the Brazilian Congress which would nationalize insurance in that country and establish a Reinsurance Institute.\n\nThere is inclosed copy of a letter dated March 30, 1937,53 addressed to the Association by its representative in Brazil together with a report of the Brazilian Committee on Constitution and Justice indicating the present status of this proposed legislation.\n\nSometime ago the inclosed brief was prepared by the Brazilian representative of the American Foreign Insurance Association. A copy of it is inclosed.53 It is so comprehensive that no comment need be made.\n\nAs of December 31, 1922, assets of foreign insurance companies in Brazil were Rs. 25.164:354$000. On December 31, 1934, the latest available figures obtainable, assets of these companies increased to Rs. 109.086:119$000, of which Rs. 40.247:649$000 were invested in bonds of the external debt.\n\nThese data indicate that the increase in assets in the country increased by some Rs. 84.000:000$000 during the 12 year period. The increase in holding of external bonds amounted to Rs. 26.000:000$000 leaving a balance of Rs. 58.000:000$000 in additional assets as against a profit of approximately Rs. 44.000:000$000. The American Foreign Insurance Association contends, therefore, that there was no export of premiums on profits which was not more than compensated by the entry of new capital. The operations of the foreign insurance companies did not result in the withdrawal of funds from Brazil but on the contrary brought approximately Rs. 14.000:000$000 into the country.\n\nThe principal reason advanced for the proposed legislation is that it would end the “export of gold” from the country as indicated in the statement that there is need “to regulate the insurance business between this and foreign countries by maintaining a system of mutual advantage and reducing to a minimum the remittance of exchange.”\n\nThe data furnished by the Association definitely establishes that the argument that the proposed legislation is needed to prevent withdrawals from Brazil is without merit since over the 12 year period the [Page 365] net effect has been to increase the assets of the foreign companies within the country.\n\nIt is a fair question to raise in view of this, whether the present legislative proposal is not confiscatory in purpose rather than designed to bring about the progressive nationalization of insurance companies as contemplated by the framers of the new Brazilian Constitution. It is also perhaps fair to state confiscation of foreign interests in the insurance business under the guise of nationalization may be only a prelude to similar action in other industries.\n\nAnother interesting point made by the Association is that about one-third of the present market value of shares of national companies is held by foreigners; several national companies are entirely owned by foreigners; and Brazilian capital would not be able to absorb at fair prices the foreign held shares in such national companies. In addition, additional capital would have to be found to replace that of the foreign companies. It would therefore be necessary to reduce the sale price of such foreign held shares before Brazilian capital could take them over.\n\nThe American Foreign Insurance Association has learned that several foreign governments, notably, Great Britain, France and Germany have been making representations in behalf of their respective companies and as no action has been taken by our government to protect our insurance interests, has requested that our Ambassador to Brazil be instructed to intervene."
