        "meta_description": "Ben Griffin provides a nuanced analysis of the conceptual foundations of the idea of ‘masculinity in crisis’. Despite all the ‘crisis talk’, male power and gender inequalities have proven remarkably resilient. Crisis talk reflected the ‘unsettling of a broader set of power relations … the gender order rather than one of its parts’. Such talk could be underpinned by the disruption of those processes through which men and masculinities are made – shifts in those ‘institutional practices, rewards, and sanctions’ through which masculinities were produced, for example – or by challenges to some men’s social or political position. These struggles between different models of manliness were routine rather than symptoms of crisis. From this perspective, the ‘communication communities’ within which competing ideas of masculinity acquired purchase – the workplace, association, or region – appear equally important. Over the past century, the growing need to move between these communities has made it harder for men to negotiate competing demands on their sense of selfhood. There were material constraints on the masculinities individuals could plausibly claim, which could be accentuated through unemployment. In this context, crisis could never be more than localised.",

        "text": "Masculinity, commentators frequently tell us, is in crisis; and diagnoses of this crisis have become a commonplace of journalistic, political, and academic debate.1 Historians have learned to be sceptical of such claims, for the simple reason that masculinity appears always to have been in crisis, no matter which period in the past has been under investigation. Early research on the history of masculinity identified crises of masculinity at the end of the nineteenth century, during the First World War, and during the interwar period, while sociological studies of Britain since 1945 have likewise identified multiple instances of manhood in crisis.2 Faced with this picture of men ‘interminably in crisis’, the very notion of crisis seems superfluous: masculinity appears always and everywhere to have been uneasy and uncertain.3 Moreover, given how resilient male social and political dominance has been, talk of masculinity in crisis seems preposterously overstated. Now that historians have largely abandoned the concept, however, it might be worth pausing to reflect on why diagnoses of crisis have haunted the history of masculinity. What might this indicate about the subject that historians are trying to describe and the intellectual apparatuses that have been brought to bear on the study of the past? Why, in short, has it been so easy for historians of any period to claim that masculinity is in crisis?\n\nCrisis rhetoric usually involves a synecdoche: to say that there is a crisis of masculinity is usually to make a claim about an unsettling of a broader set of power relations within which masculinity is situated – a crisis of the gender order rather than one of its parts. This rhetoric also treats ‘masculinity’ as a synonym for the position of men within that structure, thereby failing to acknowledge either that there are multiple masculinities in any society, or that gender refers to the cultural interpretation of sexual difference rather than ‘men’. John Tosh has identified three separate anxieties about social change underpinning much of the talk about crisis: a concern that men are losing power and status relative to women, fears about the effects of changes in the labour market, and changes in sexual politics – most importantly gay liberation; others would add changes in the family, like increasing numbers of divorces and single-parent families. The effects of these changes are then registered in distressing statistics about male mental health, educational attainment, and incarceration.4 This chapter will not engage with these transformations; instead, it will argue that there is another set of structural changes capable of generating crisis talk that has been neglected in the current literature – changes in the relationships of power that exist between masculinities. Understanding these dynamics will allow us to understand why it has proved so easy to argue that masculinity was in crisis, when in practice the gender order has proved remarkably resilient.5\n\nThe creation of power relations between masculinities can be understood as a four-fold operation.6 First, there is the process of cultural contestation whereby some models of masculinity are privileged over others. Second, the techniques, mechanisms, or opportunities that allow men to identify themselves with those models are not available to all men equally. Third, there is the process by which the performance of a particular masculinity is accorded recognition by others. Fourth, individuals recognised as performing particular masculinities are positioned in relation to sets of institutional practices, rewards, and sanctions. The argument of this chapter is that disruption to any one of these operations might generate a diagnosis that masculinity was in crisis, without that disruption necessarily impacting on any of the other three or prompting a wider reconfiguration of the gender order. In other words, diagnoses of crisis might be lumping together different kinds of phenomena: teasing these apart allows us to see different kinds of change shaping the history of masculinities in modern Britain.\n\nContesting cultural stereotypes\n\nFollowing the pioneering work of R. W. Connell, gender historians are now familiar with the idea that there are hierarchies between masculinities, with some achieving a normative or ‘hegemonic’ status, while others are subordinated, marginalised, or moved into positions of either complicity or resistance relative to the normative model.7 These hierarchies are constructed by shifting sets of cultural norms relating to (among other things) sexuality and intimacy, physique and bodily capacity, and emotional control. These qualities are articulated through repertoires of cultural models that constitute recognised ways of being a man.8 One of the most important in modern British history has been the figure of the ‘gentleman’ – a model of masculinity characterised not just by a class position, but by distinctive aesthetics, dispositions, and deportment.9 Twentieth-century Britain has seen the rise and fall of many such models. These include: teddy boys, yuppies,10 respectable artisans/tradesmen,11 the family man, the working-class ‘good husband’,12 the masher,13 the swell, the spiv,14 the businessman, the manager,15 the organisation man,16 the clerk, Rastafarians, punks,17 goths, mods, rockers, hippies, new romantics, skinheads, rude boys, bikers, farmers, hard men,18 new men, the ‘honest poor’;19 in universities, the reading man, the aesthete, the athlete and the sporting man;20 leather boys, queans,21 bears,22 and clones;23 ‘scuttlers’,24 ‘corner lads’,25 chavs, tramps, intellectuals, young fogeys, football hooligans, hipsters, dandies, ‘new lads’,26 dirty old men in long macs, the white van man, the soldier,27 the flyer,28 the non-conformist preacher, the heroic missionary, the trendy vicar, and the jet-setting international playboy. Each of these types offered a model for how to be a man, but they must be studied as cultural models, not as descriptions of actual men. This is because individual men could perform more than one of these models over the course of the life cycle, or even over the course of a single day: the good husband and the football hooligan, the businessman and the biker, could be descriptions of the same man.29\n\nThe meanings of these various models, the status accorded to them, and their popularity all changed over time, although few have been subjected to the same kind of historical attention as the eighteenth-century macaroni or ‘polite’ gentleman.30 The first operation of power to discuss, then, concerns the cultural contests that created hierarchies between models of masculinity. This kind of cultural politics can be seen in Josiah Wedgewood’s 1927 suggestion that American films provided good role models for men:\n\nWe have a large historical literature on contests of this kind. For example, the literature on the rise, fall, and re-emergence of domestic ideals of middle-class masculinity in the century before the Second World War, or Linsey Robb’s study of how hierarchies between types of masculinity were reconfigured during the Second World War.32 The emergence of new models could at all times prove disorienting for men, but it is important not to misidentify the routine process of cultural contestation as symptoms of a crisis. When, in 1931, S. F. Hatton complained about young men ‘who are more given to the softer delights of the cinema and the dance hall, than the more vigorous and manly sporting instincts of boxing, football, and such-like pastimes’, this was simply the ordinary work of the gender order, not a symptom of a deeper dislocation.33\n\nBut within what kind of social formation does a particular cultural model of masculinity attain normative status? Rather than attempt to generalise about ‘Britain’ as a whole, a more useful approach is to use Simon Szreter’s concept of ‘communication communities’.34 These are social formations characterised by people who share sets of norms because they participate in the same networks, institutions, and practices that generate those norms. For example, in the nineteenth century, middle-class men in different parts of the country belonged to the same communication community because they went to the same sorts of schools and read the same newspapers, whereas working-class communication communities tended to be more localised, with dialect literature and local schools, street corners, and workplaces producing regionally diverse community norms. It was in these communication communities that boys learned what it meant to be men. As a result, we can see how, well into the twentieth century, different communication communities demonstrated substantial variation in their beliefs and practices regarding sex, intimacy, and child-rearing.35 As Helen Smith argues, ‘[a]cceptable behaviour could be defined street by street, never mind county by county, and this reflected what locals in an area valued’.36 Other communities were less geographically bounded, as we can see from the distinctive cultures into which men were socialised when they joined the medical or legal professions, or the Brigade of Guards.37 The cultural politics that established hierarchies between models and norms of masculinity were carried out within these communication communities. This work was done in large part by what we might call ‘authorising institutions’, such as the Church, schools, the press, the medical profession, or governing bodies within professions.\n\nSeen from this perspective, the history of modern Britain becomes a history of multiple social formations existing side by side with one another (and sometimes overlapping or nested inside one another), each with its own authorising institutions. Thus, Lucy Delap’s study of Anglican masculinities has found that ‘In determining which models were adopted by individuals … contests over hierarchies and authority within particular parishes or church institutions seem more influential than broader social changes such as war and economic depression.’38 An implication of this analysis is that the masculine qualities prized in one communication community might be valued differently in another, and consequently the hierarchies between various masculinities might differ. In the 1950s, for example, Michael Young and Peter Willmott found that manual workers in East London differed sharply from ‘experts’ in the social status that they accorded to different occupations, a substantial proportion regarding non-manual commercial or clerical occupations as of lower status than agricultural or dock labour.39 Since men might belong to multiple communication communities simultaneously, individuals might have to negotiate potentially conflicting identities, loyalties, and values. For example, Michael Roper’s study of British business management since 1945 describes the culture clash that occurred between middle-class managers and men on the shop floor. One senior manager felt that ‘if you weren’t running around hitting bits of iron with hammers or wielding a spanner, then you weren’t a man’.40 Similarly, Robb has identified tensions during the Second World War between the ‘hard man’ masculinity valued by NCOs (Non-Commissioned Officers) from working-class communities and the ‘seemingly effete notion of manly duty espoused by many conscientious objectors’ from different backgrounds.41 It seems a plausible hypothesis that certain features of Britain’s modernity – increases in geographical and absolute social mobility, changing occupational structures, the growth of leisure, and the dislocations of war – meant that men needed to navigate between multiple communication communities more frequently than before. One might therefore suggest that modernity required more complex gender performances.\n\nWith this in mind, we can identify a number of possible changes in this cultural politics that might be taken to constitute a crisis of masculinity. The first of these would be a sudden shift in the relative positions of different models of masculinity. Modern British history has seen no change as dramatic as the sudden privileging of Western modes of dress and behaviour among social elites in Japan after the Meiji restoration, or the attacks on clerical masculinities that followed the French Revolution. Certainly, particular cultural models have suddenly lost prestige: the figure of the ‘country gentleman’ was far less central to political culture in the twentieth century than it had been in the nineteenth. Similarly, some have suggested that the shift away from militaristic models of masculinity after the First World War constituted a ‘crisis of masculinity’.42 While such changes may have been disorienting, they scarcely seem to constitute a crisis, for two reasons. First, when certain models of masculinity declined in popularity or status, other forms embodying desirable traits were usually available.43 So, for example, Adrian Bingham has shown how, after 1918, sporting heroes provided new models of masculinity that embodied those qualities of courage, endurance, and physical strength that had previously been modelled by military heroes.44 Secondly, and most importantly, since the relative hierarchies between masculinities were specific to particular communication communities, change in the cultural organisation of masculinities within one community would not necessarily be replicated in others. To put it another way: the rise of the yuppie in the 1980s might have displaced the figure of the urbane city gent, but this shift had little impact outside the communication community within which it was located.45 Disruption within a single communication community, in other words, would not necessarily lead to a more general crisis. For this reason, sweeping arguments about challenges to ‘hegemonic masculinity’ in Britain are rarely sustainable.\n\nA different form of crisis might conceivably involve a radical restructuring of communication communities, in such a way that men originally socialised in one community might find themselves unexpectedly located in another with different norms, values, and expectations. One can see how this might have followed the development of more numerous national communication communities which overlaid older ones, as a result of compulsory schooling from 1880 and the development of mass media technologies. Laura King, for example, has argued that in the twentieth century the expansion of the press led to the emergence of a more homogeneous national culture which supplanted the regionally diverse cultures of parenting described by Siân Pooley.46 It seems safer to say that new national communities did not displace existing localised cultures as much as provide a mutual frame of reference for actors who participated in both.47 Current anxieties about the impact of social media are another example of this kind of change.\n\nMore important for our purposes was the post-war transformation of the authorising institutions within communication communities. The declining authority of the churches, and the growing authority of the medical profession, for example, are two of the most important stories in modern gender history.48 They accompanied a fundamental reconceptualisation of the role of the state in authorising or censuring gender performances: a change often described as the move to a ‘permissive society’. ‘Permissiveness’ was a response to the fracturing of a Victorian moral consensus that had endured well into the twentieth century (and it is worth remembering that the last generation to have left school before Queen Victoria died were still only in their fifties in the 1940s). By the 1930s the confident certainties that had characterised the public doctrines of the Victorian generation were giving way to a rather uneasy ethical pluralism in which there was much less agreement about what constituted a good life.49 Now that public moralists no longer spoke with one voice, the state was prompted to distinguish more sharply between ‘public’ morality that legitimately remained within its purview, and ‘private’ matters that did not. The Wolfenden Report of 1957 set out this new vision when it proclaimed that ‘It is not, in our view, the function of the law to intervene in the private lives of citizens, or to seek to enforce any particular pattern of behaviour.’50 In other words, the state began to limit its role in the cultural battles to authorise or to proscribe certain forms of masculinity. At the same time, however, new institutions were emerging which claimed authority to pass judgement on what was really ‘masculine’ behaviour. Increasingly, judges, doctors, teachers, clergymen, and politicians had to compete with advertisers, sociologists, psychologists, charities, consumer groups, social workers, relationship counsellors, newspaper agony aunts, moral entrepreneurs, pop groups, filmmakers, celebrities, lifestyle magazines, stylists, social media ‘influencers’, and the full panoply of ‘experts’.\n\nThese changes created the conditions which made possible the rapid expansion of the available repertoire of cultural models of masculinity. It is striking how many of the cultural stereotypes listed at the start of this section developed in the post-war years, driven by affluence, technological change, and especially by new kinds of advertising and marketing firms eager to promote new cultural stereotypes for young men.51 The multiplication of authorising institutions and the breakdown of older public doctrines not only promoted the multiplication of cultural models, it also made it harder to establish hierarchies between them, because competing models aspiring to normative status could claim support from rival institutions. In this discursive landscape, men who pushed prams could claim authority for their gender performances as easily as their opponents.52 Likewise, although their parents may not have approved, mods, rockers, punks, and goths could all find magazines, films, and commentators to validate their choices in a way that has no nineteenth-century equivalent. For this reason, some of the anxieties identified as symptoms of a contemporary crisis of masculinity might be better described in terms of a crisis of institutional authority. Anxious masculinities have been the product not simply of the profusion of cultural models of masculinity, but an inability to establish some preferred models or characteristics as more legitimate than others.\n\nA further dimension of this change has been the growing influence of women in authorising institutions – notably the judiciary, parliament, the clergy, the medical profession, and the press – which had for years resisted their admission.53 The expanding number of authorising institutions further amplified women’s voices in contests over masculine norms. Not the least significant feminist achievement has been the creation by women of new forums that have allowed women to participate in these contests, from the feminist periodicals of the 1970s to the Everyday Sexism Project website and the use of social media in the #MeToo movement. As a result, the term ‘toxic masculinity’ has entered common parlance; this is an important intervention in the cultural contests over norms of male behaviour.\n\nFor this reason, contemporary ‘men’s rights’ activists are keen to blame their perceived ills on authorising institutions that they believe have been ‘corrupted’ by feminism, such as universities and the family law division of the High Court.54 The fact that, in 2013, the organiser of a petition asking that more women’s faces appear on banknotes received threats of murder and rape is a further symptom of this. The absurd headline on the front page of the Sun in 1998, which asked ‘Are we being run by a gay mafia?’, likewise indicates concerns about the composition of authorising institutions.55 This presents a different kind of ‘crisis’ sensibility than those encountered earlier in the century, when the principal anxieties were the product of men increasingly needing to navigate between communities with different gender norms, or by changes in the status accorded to particular masculinities within any given community.\n\nPerforming masculinities\n\nStudying this cultural politics, however, tells us nothing about how these masculinities were performed by flesh and blood individuals. This requires us to consider the historically specific opportunities, mechanisms, or techniques that enabled men to identify themselves with particular types of masculinity. For example, to pass as a ‘gentleman’ required a man to wear the right clothes, adopt the correct body language, and display appropriate manners.56 The same is true of those who wished to identify as skinheads, bikers, or businessmen. These qualities could be learned or acquired: How to Shine in Society (1860) reassured its readers that the culture and refinement expected of gentlemen ‘are within the reach of every man who chooses to make the necessary effort to acquire them’.57 In the 1930s, the magazine Men Only played a similar role, advising its readers on how to perform desirable masculinities.58 But access to the necessary mechanisms, techniques, and opportunities were not available to all.59 Different levels of material and cultural capital, and different bodily capacities, meant that some men were better placed to associate themselves with normative masculinities than others. Not everyone could afford the clothes or education required to perform certain forms of masculinity; fathers unable to support their families’ financial needs were unable to lay claim to the prestige attached to the male breadwinner; and physical frailty, deafness, or failing eyesight placed limits on the repertoire of masculinities that a man could perform. In short, an individual’s ability to undertake a particular gender performance required access not only to the relevant script, but also access to the correct costume and props, and the requisite bodily capacities.60\n\nAttending to this point allows us to bridge the gap between cultural and social history. For example, since courage was valued as a desirable quality in men, we can ask what means were available to men to establish that they were brave. Young men could join street gangs ‘to prove themselves through displays of aggression and fighting prowess’.61 Labourers could take unnecessary risks at the workplace.62 During wartime a different set of opportunities became available, and Roper has identified ‘a belief among the post-war generation [of] men that they were superior men’ by virtue of their military experience.63 But later generations had to find different ways of identifying themselves with ‘heroic’ forms of masculinity, which might explain the curious increase in macho and militaristic language in political discourse in the late 1960s and 1970s.64 One might similarly chart the ways in which the history of mass consumerism affected men’s ability to perform certain masculinities. Interwar retailers, for example, marketed affordable menswear by targeting the consumer who wanted to be a gentleman ‘but who had previously been excluded from his wardrobe’.65\n\nAn implication of the argument so far is that it would have been advantageous for men to have the capacity to perform multiple masculinities: this was an adaptive capacity that facilitated social mobility. The early generations of Labour MPs were persistently handicapped by the limited repertoire of masculinities available for them to perform. It was not easy for working-class men to perform the gentlemanly masculinities valued in the House of Commons, and some of the characteristics that working-class men usually exhibited to prove their ‘manliness’ – like manual skill, the ability to provide financially for a family, physical toughness, or negotiating skill – could not easily be demonstrated on the floor of the House. It is no surprise that so many trade unionist MPs found the Commons intimidating: it was by no means clear how they could be a man in that space.66 Movement within communication communities was as important as movement between them, and in particular the need to perform multiple masculinities over the course of the life cycle deserves more attention than it has received. Youth culture tends to be studied in isolation, which leaves unexplored the question of how teenage punks became middle-aged estate agents. If we accept the hypothesis that modernity required men to be able to move between communication communities more frequently than before, then this would presumably have intensified the political struggles over the allocation of the mechanisms, techniques, and opportunities needed to perform masculinities.\n\nHow might this help us to refine the notion of a crisis of masculinity? Seen in these terms, a crisis of masculinity might occur when a group of men face a sudden loss of access to the mechanisms that allow them to identify themselves as particular kinds of men. Mass disablement after the First World War would clearly count as a crisis in these terms.67 A second example would be the onset of mass unemployment. Consider the speech that the Labour MP James O’Grady made in 1911.\n\nThere is a lot of evidence that during the mass unemployment of the 1920s and 1980s, men experienced unemployment as emasculating.69 That is because regular work and the role of breadwinner were considered essential for men if they were to access the most prestigious forms of masculinity in working-class communities.70 An economic crisis was also experienced, in part, as a crisis of gender identity. This kind of sudden change must be distinguished from the more routine deprivations of class.71 The inequitable distribution of resources means that the usual condition of the lower middle and working classes has been precarious access to the means that would enable them to perform masculinities that they considered desirable.72 As Leonore Davidoff and Catherine Hall put it, ‘consciousness of class always takes a gendered form’.73 This can also be seen in the anxiety that some middle-class men experienced in the 1940s and 1950s as a result of rationing, which meant that they were unable to access the clothes, food, and petrol that they used to perform their preferred masculinities.74 Crises of this kind may be quite rare. Few cultural models are reliant on just one technique or mechanism to enable their performance, so that men might lose one but retain access to others. And men have been very creative in finding substitutes: unemployed men in the 1930s, for example, preserved their self-respect by maintaining their status in the home, or by promoting new cultural models of ‘honest poverty’.75\n\nThis does not mean that men have greeted such moments with equanimity. We can interpret many moments of conflict in modern gender politics as moments of anxiety that men might be about to lose access to mechanisms or techniques that have been important to their gender performances. Access to education and to professional qualifications has been particularly fought over.76 The University of Cambridge, for example, refused to grant women degrees until 1948, precisely because its members valued an all-male environment as a forum in which distinctive styles of elite masculinity could be cultivated. In 1897, one student objected to admitting women on the grounds that ‘Cambridge exists not for mere erudition, but for the education of the male youth of England – education of body, mind, feelings; and its object is to make a man a finished gentleman.’77 Feelings ran so high that votes on whether to admit women were accompanied by less than gentlemanly rioting.78 Studying at Cambridge was a way of claiming gentlemanliness, but if women could study there too then that undermined one’s ability to claim gentlemanliness by virtue of having studied there. As an article from Men Only in 1935 put it, women’s presence in the professions and seats of learning was ‘merely an emasculating one’.79 For working-class men during the First World War, opposition to women workers doing the same jobs as male workers was a symptom of similar anxieties. Alternatively, worries might be generated at moments when new groups of men gained access to mechanisms, techniques, or opportunities that had previously been restricted. This lay at the root of concerns that all of those who had received commissions during the First World War ought to be treated as gentlemen after demobilisation, even though, as one public school-educated observer remarked, ‘Many of them came from the lower middle-class and had no manners, including table manners, of any kind.’80 It is easy to see how the men involved in these battles over who had access to the means of performing masculinity may have perceived a crisis, even if in retrospect the diagnosis seems overstated.\n\nAudience recognition\n\nEven if an individual has access to the necessary scripts, props, and costumes required to perform a particular kind of masculinity, that does not mean that the performance will necessarily be recognised as authentic by those viewing it. Men who joined the Volunteers in the second half of the nineteenth century, or the Home Guard in the 1940s, may have hoped that this was a way to perform prestigious military masculinities that demonstrated bravery, physical strength, and self-control, but in fact they were repeatedly mocked by onlookers for ‘playing at soldiers’.81 What is at stake here is not whether some models of masculinity are valued above others, but whether an individual is performing that model correctly. Women have been particularly important as judges of male gender performances. In South Wales in the 1930s, for example, ‘strike-breakers and those in the “scab” unions were derided by women for not being real men’; while in the First World War women took it upon themselves to hand out white feathers to men they deemed to be shirking their gendered responsibilities by refusing to fight.82 This ability to validate particular gender performances by conferring or withholding recognition should be understood as a third kind of power-creating hierarchies between men.\n\nIn this sense communication communities also function as sites of interpretation. Unless a man’s performance can be identified as one of an acknowledged repertoire of masculinities then his social status will remain uncertain at best. At this stage, considerations of ethnicity frequently become important. Communities have often refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of performances of high-status masculinities by immigrant or non-white men. Those same men might enjoy high status within another communication community. This kind of power is particularly pressing for trans politics: an individual who is biologically female, and identifies with a particular masculinity, might find that their gender performance is not recognised as legitimate by the audiences that individual encounters.83\n\nThis provides a model for a third type of crisis of masculinity: a moment when communities suddenly refuse to recognise as legitimate the gender performances of large numbers of men. That moment when large numbers of men were suddenly deemed physically substandard as they volunteered to fight in the Second Boer War might offer an example; another might be sudden changes in attitudes towards promiscuity during the AIDS crisis. In modern British history it is feminism that has created the most acute male anxieties about the legitimacy of their gender performances. Feminist campaigns against domestic abuse or sexual incontinence in the late nineteenth century were rarely interested in challenging hierarchies between types of masculinity; instead, activists tended to accuse men of failing to live up to the role of the loving, self-controlled breadwinner.84 More recently, anxieties about ‘political correctness’ – a term which refers to informal policing of public address in the pursuit of respectful treatment of minority groups and women – reflect concerns that familiar forms of male performance are being actively repudiated by women. This of course runs in tandem with women’s participation in contests over cultural norms described above. Thus, a study of online reactions to a feminist campaign in 2013 urging retailers to stop selling ‘lads’ mags’ found that men responded by depicting men and masculinity variously as ‘under threat’, ‘attacked’, ‘victimised’, or ‘demonised’ so that ‘men are not allowed to be men’.85 The hostility to women passing judgement on men is dramatised by the term adopted by some radicalised misogynists online – ‘incel’ – which is a portmanteau term meaning ‘involuntary celibate’.86 Their diagnosis of a crisis of masculinity, although nonsensical in many respects, draws attention to the fact that successful performances of gender depend on an audience’s power to confer or withhold recognition of that performance’s legitimacy.\n\nInstitutional rewards and sanctions\n\nThe last of our four operations of power describes the processes whereby individuals are positioned in relation to sets of institutional practices, rewards, and sanctions once their gender performances have been recognised as either legitimate or illegitimate. Men who were acknowledged to be good husbands and providers, for example, were said to be more likely to rise up the ranks of trade unions in the mid-twentieth century.87 Alternatively, men who are not recognised as good providers for their families can become targeted by agents of the state including social workers and the Child Support Agency. Perhaps the best example of the state rewarding or penalising masculinities can be seen in how it enfranchised some men but not others.88 The electoral reforms of the late nineteenth century deliberately set out to enfranchise fathers of families with a settled residence who were economically independent: recipients of poor relief and men without a settled residence of their own were ineligible to vote, and during the First World War conscientious objectors were also stripped of the franchise. State-sponsored rewards and sanctions multiplied in the late nineteenth century as new forms of liberal social science encouraged politicians to believe that the morals of the poor could be reformed by legislation – prompting new restrictions on leisure practices, alcohol consumption, and domestic violence as well as increases to women’s rights.89 This liberal optimism may later have waned, but identifying and regulating ‘problematic’ masculinities has remained central to the activities of the modern state.\n\nBut were there any changes in the distribution of institutional rewards such as might constitute a crisis of masculinity? The Terror during the French Revolution and the histories of modern dictatorships might furnish examples, but modern British history furnishes nothing comparable. The closest contender is possibly the flurry of measures passed by the Whig governments of the 1830s, which destabilised traditional patterns of political, social, and religious authority, placed new restrictions on female and child labour, and which (in the form of new police forces, attacks on trade unions, and the New Poor Law) threatened multiple aspects of working-class masculinity.90 Twentieth-century reforms have been far less sweeping in their effects, although often consequential for particular communities (particularly in relation to interwar unemployment). The decriminalisation of male homosexuality in 1967 (in England and Wales), 1980 (in Scotland), and 1982 (in Northern Ireland), and the introduction of gay marriage in 2013, stand out as important moments, but they cannot be said to have precipitated a crisis in any but the cultural sense.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo why has it been so easy for historians and commentators to identify ‘crises of masculinity’? The argument of this chapter has been that, in addition to changing relations between men and women, and changes in the structures of the family and labour market, relations of power between masculinities have also been in flux. I have identified four different kinds of power relations, each of which might be disrupted or reconfigured in such a way that produced perceptions of crisis.\n\nThis is not to say that those perceptions have been accurate: change has been easier to find than crisis. This is what one would expect, given the turn against ‘crisis talk’ amongst historians. But one advantage of distinguishing between the various kinds of power relationships described above is that it helps us to understand why change has not amounted to crisis. In the first place, I have argued that the cultural processes that give meaning to gender operate in discrete communication communities, each with their own structures and hierarchies. As such, crises of cultural authority or of recognition are likely to be localised within communities, and rarely capable of disrupting the broader gender order. This remains true despite the spread of mass communications. Secondly, it will be apparent that change in one of our four operations of power will not necessarily lead to change in any of the others. This offers a way of explaining why, despite repeated observations that masculinity was changing or in crisis, patterns of sexual inequality have proved so durable.\n\nWhat this study of crisis leads us to, then, is a clearer sense of what kinds of change have been important to the history of masculinity, and this provides an agenda for future research. Accounts of cultural change, sensitive to the variety of communication communities, need to attend to the expansion of the available repertoire of masculinities, their changing meanings, and the ways in which their status was contested by an expanding range of institutions claiming authority to determine appropriate norms. We also need a deeper understanding of how men performed multiple masculinities, and how the resources needed to perform particular masculinities were distributed inequitably: that takes us to the heart not only of histories of class, but also disability and ageing. We need a better appreciation of the conditions in which audiences refused to acknowledge gender performances as legitimate: that will provide a clearer understanding of phenomena like racism. And finally, a deeper understanding of patterns of institutional rewards and sanctions will allow us to see how organisations, businesses, and the state have contributed to those inequalities between men that are part of the warp and weft of the gender order. What kinds of periodisation might this produce? Caught between visions of masculinity perpetually in crisis and the blunt reality of persistent sexual inequality, we need an approach that allows us to reconcile the two – one that can explain how shifting power relationships between men have contributed to the broader gender order. Disaggregating the forms of power that exist between men, and tracing their distinct trajectories, will allow us to explain why masculinities always appear to have been troubled and uncertain, without losing our ability to make meaningful generalisations about change over time."
