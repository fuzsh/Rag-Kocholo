        "text": "This is a select bibliography of publications that use data from the Roper Center. Some cite information on overall responses obtained from iPoll; some are based on individual-level analyses of datasets held by the Roper Center, and others use our Presidential approval series or other indexes constructed from Roper Center data.\n\nThis bibliography is limited to research articles, and does not include opinion pieces, news stories, or articles in popular magazines. It also does not include publications that use only the General Social Survey (although some use the GSS in addition to other Roper Center data); a bibliography of publications using the GSS can be found on the GSS Data and Information Retrieval System (GSSDIRS) site. At this time, the bibliography does not include books.
