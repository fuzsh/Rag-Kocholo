        "text": "1821: \"The proposed academy was intended primarily to train young ministers, preparing some to enter the Washington institution where they could complete a thorough theological education, and giving to others who could not go on to Washington the most necessary elements in a theological education.\" (52)m\n\n1824: \"The sum of $25.00 was reported as having been collected for the new institution of learning, the first money raised for it (1824).\" (54)m\n\n1825:\"The committee appointed to select a site reported the advantages and disadvantages of several sites which had been proposed, among them Greenville and Pendleton. After discussion it was decided unanimously ‘that the institution contemplated by the convention be located in the immediate vicinity of Edgefield Court House.’\" (57)m\n\n\"The 'objects and purposes' of the convention as stated in the Act (of incorporation) were 'to erect and establish an academical and theological seminary for the education of youth, generally, and of indigent pious young men, particularly, who may be designed for the gospel ministry . . . .'\" (58)m\n\nThe Convention appointed a Board of Agents (functioning like a Board of Trustees) to take immediate steps for the erection of buildings and to obtain a principal. They were also responsible for establishing rules concerning the course of studies and the conduct of students. Board of Agents members were Basil Manly, Abner Blocker, Joseph B. Cook, Charles D. Mallary, Jesse Hartwell, Timothy Dargan, Matthew Mims, and John Landrum. (13)d\n\n1826: \"They (the convention) accepted from the trustees of the Village Academy (of Edgefield) the property of that institution and from Eldred Simkins, Sr., some land surrounding the academy property . . . . they bought as a home for the principal the house and lot of Basil Manly . . . . they fixed the salary of the future principal as ‘the entire profits of the school-five hundred dollars in addition to it, and the use of a house and lot free of expense.'\" (59)m\n\n1826: \"At a meeting of the Board [of Agents} held September 18, 1826, Rev. Joseph Andrews Warne was unanimously elected principal . . . . Mr. Warne accepted and appeared at the convention where he was cordially received.\" (60)m\n\n\"Thomas Gillison, Esq., recently deceased, had left a legacy of $5000 to the convention, ‘to be applied to educational purposes,’ the first legacy of any size to be left to the convention. The convention . . . . at once took steps to build up a permanent fund the interest of which could be used to support the objects fostered by the convention. This action was the beginning of a century of effort to endow the institution.\" (60-61)m\n\n\"The rules provide that the institution ‘shall be under the general direction of the state convention of the Baptist denomination in South Carolina; who alone shall have power to alter or amend these rules.\" (61)m\n\nJune 15, 1827: \"The Board is highly gratified with the examination of the students of the Furman Academy, which they attended this day . . . .\" scbc\n\n1828: \"Principal Warne, whose health was poor, does not seem to have been very well suited to the position. He tendered his resignation at the meeting of the board in June 1828, after only one year and a half of service . . . . the board proceeded to elect as principal, W.T. Brantly, then editor of the Columbian Star of Philadelphia. The Edgefield church offered him its pastorate to supplement his salary. When he declined both positions, the executive committee put the institution in charge of Reverend W.D. Cowdry.\" (65)m\n\n1829: \"In January, 1829, the beneficiaries, of whom there were three, were placed under the care and tuition of Rev. Jesse Hartwell at his residence in High Hills ‘with a view in the future to establish the institution in more strict accordance, with the original design of making the theological department most prominent.’\" (66)m\n\n1829-1830: \"It was never expected that this would be its permanent site (High Hills). [Jesse Hartwell] took the students into his own home for a time, later building simple rough huts for them at his own expense . . . . The Furman library was turned over to him and carried back to the High Hills when it had been brought to Edgefield. Two ministerial students who were beneficiaries of the convention went with him, and two more joined him during the first year . . . . The new term January, 1830, began with eight students and four more had entered by April, ten of whom boarded with the principal.\" (67)m\n\n1830: \"Principal Hartwell was giving all this instruction, besides attending to the duties of administration, managing the erection of buildings and boarding most of the students in his own home. This work he was doing on a salary of $400 a year.\" (69)m\n\n1830: \"The scholarship plan of support seemed so promising that the board immediately after adjournment of the convention elected Rev. Samuel Furman, junior professor . . . . He was the son of Dr. Richard Furman . . . . He remained professor for four years, enjoying the profound respect and ardent affection of his students several of whom became men of influence and distinction. Samuel Furman was the third professor in the history of the institution.\" (71)m\n\n1832: \"The library has been somewhat enlarged. It is now composed of 916 volumes. The room in which it is placed contains also the libraries of the Professor’s, consisting of about 300 volumes each. The whole number of books to which the members of the Institution have free access is therefore about 1500.\" scbc\n\n\"[Students enrolled are] Isaac Nicholes, Samuel Worthington, James Griffith, Robert Nappier, James M. Chiles, Henry D. Mahoney, Robert McNab, Wm. G. Collins, Wm. H. Brisbane, John M. Barnes, James C. Furman, Wm. F. Missildine, and Thos. Adams.\" scbc\n\n1833: \"That the name of our Institution be changed to The Furman Theological Institution.\" scbc\n\n\"Several Students form the Institution also attended on the deliberations, and occasionally assisted in the devotional exercises of the meeting, viz: R. Furman, Duncan, Hard, Chambliss, Dargan, Graham, J.M. Breaker, who is about to enter as a Student.\" scbc\n\n1834: \"[New students included] C. M. Breaker, Wm. H. M'Intosh, and W. Loyd.\" scbc\n\n\"The subscriptions on scholarships were not being paid, and in consequence the salaries of the professors, small as they were, were steadily falling behind, and by the end of 1834 they were nearly a year in arrears. The financial burdens were evidently being carried almost exclusively by Hartwell and Furman, the two men upon whom rested also the duties of administration and instruction. As a climax to the situation Principal Hartwell in July submitted to the board his resignation to take effect in six months, and in December Professor Furman likewise tendered his resignation to the convention for immediate acceptance.\" (72-73)m\n\n\"They so amended the constitution as to create a separate board of trustees elected by the convention at the end of every fourth year who should own, control and manage the school.\" (74)m\n\n\"The board immediately elected as principal, William Hooper, a distinguished scholar and professor in the North Carolina College, but he declined and when no other satisfactory man could be found the school was closed at the end of 1834.\" (75)m\n\n1835: \"In general the lower part of the state, where the culture of the denomination was chiefly found, supported the plan of providing a separate theological institution of high grade by cooperation with other states in supporting and controlling it. . .fitting the instruction to the needs of young ministers of all degrees of culture but admitting none but ministers and rejecting manual labor. On the other hand the upper part of the state was inclining to lay chief emphasis on manual labor and academic work and go forward alone.\" (77)m\n\n\"The hour of the second removal was at hand. The land at the High Hills was not fertile and fertile soil was necessary to the success of the manual labor experiment.\" (80)m\n\nThe control of the school was changed from a Board of Agents to a Board of Trustees elected every four years. On the board were James C. Furman, Josiah B. Furman, Charles M. Furman, Jonathan Davis, Abraham D. Jones, Iverson L. Brooks, John B. O'Neall, John K. McIver, M.T. Mendenhall, William B. Johnson, Basil Manly, Henry Bailey, Amaziah Rice, Richard Fuller, Nathan L. Griffin, John W. Lewis, Nicholas W. Hodges, Darling Peoples, Samson H. Butler, Alexander J. Lawton, Jennings O'Bannon, John O. Balfour, Zebulon Rudulph, Sr., James Mobley, Joseph Grisham, and Thomas Blackwood. (29)d\n\n1836: \"The school located at High Hills had been closed since the end of 1834. The convention owned there a school building, some thirty acres of land, a small library and some furniture and equipment. They decided to sell the land and building, purchase much more extensive lands near Fairfield Church three miles southwest of Winnsboro, erect buildings for two institutions, an English and classical academy and a theological institution, to be separate institutions but under the same board and the same general management, to be supported in large part by farming operations to be carried on by school boys who were required to labor 2 ½ hours a day and spend the rest of their time in study.\" (81)m\n\n\"W.E. Bailey had been appointed principal of the English and classical school, but no professors had been found for the theological department, nor had anything been done on the buildings of this department.\" (83)m\n\n1837: \"The board also elected two professors – Rev. Dr. Hooper, of North Carolina College, as senior professor on a salary of $1500 and a house, and James C. Furman, pastor at Welch Neck, as junior professor on a salary of $1200 and a house. . .Mr. Furman declined.\" (85)m\n\n\"It was determined to open the theological department on January 1, 1838, and the Rev. J.S. Maginnis was elected professor to give half his time to the theological department and half to the other.\" (86)m\n\n1838: \"Principal Bailey and Professor Maginnis resigned . . . . N.W. Hodges was elected its (classical department) principal, a last desperate effort to save this feature of the institution.\" (86)m\n\n1839: \"In December Dr. Hooper presented his resignation [from the theological seminary] . . . . and J.L. Reynolds was elected his successor as senior professor.\" (87)m\n\n1840: \"In December [the convention] voted unanimously to sell the buildings of the English school and half the land, pay off the debt which now amounted to about $9000 and return the remainder if any to the donors.\" (88)m\n\n\"In the year 1840 Doctor Hooper was succeeded in the presidency by Dr. J.L. Reynolds, and in the course of four years he was in turn succeeded by Dr. J.C. Furman.\" (21)b10\n\n1841: \"Mr. Bayfield Whilden, having completed his studies in the partial course, has been honorably dismissed.\" scbc\n\n1841-1842: \"Rev. J. Chaplin, a young man from the north . . . . resigned alleging mistreatment by the senior professor . . . . The next year (1842) Reynolds was the sole professor, but on December 12, 1842, Rev. James S. Mims was elected junior professor contrary to the wishes of Mr. Reynolds who wanted a different man.\" (90)m\n\n1843: \"That the amount of board be eighty-five dollars ($85,) for the scholastic year.\" (scbc)\n\n1844: \"Reynolds resigned in December, 1844 as the result of friction with the faculty, the board, and his subordinates. It was later stated that he desired re-election, but James C. Furman was on December 9, 1844, elected senior professor in his stead.\" (91)m\n\n1845: \"The agitation over the question of slavery gradually intensified till the board of the Triennial Convention announced that they would refuse to appoint a slave-holder as a missionary should one apply for appointment. This statement precipitated the withdrawal of Southern Baptists from co-operation with the Triennial Convention and the organization of the Southern Baptist Convention at Augusta in May, 1845. Dr. Furman was present and took part in that convention.\" (93-94)m\n\n1845-49: \"Dr. Furman proposed that Furman Theological Institution should be made the proposed general institution . . . . Rev. J.L. Reynolds attacked Professor Furman as incompetent and Professor Mims as a heretic . . . . Probably due to this controversy Professor Mims tendered his resignation December, 1849, but the board declined to accept it and induced him withdraw it and remain with the institution.\" (94)m\n\n1846: \"In May, 1846, the faculty was enlarged by the addition of the third member, Rev. Peter C. Edwards.\" (92)m\n\n1847: \"That a committee be appointed to consult and inquire, with reference to practicability of removing the Institution to Columbia.\" scbc\n\n1848: \"Whereas the Rev. J.L. Reynolds has addressed to this body a communication, protesting against doctrine, taught by the Professor of Systematic Theology in the Furman Theological Institution as heterodox, and requesting, if the Professor be sustained in the teaching of such doctrine, that the bond, which he, Mr. Reynolds, has given to the Treasurer of the Convention for the support of Professors, be returned to him.\" scbc\n\n1849: \"The doors of Furman were again opened to young men of good character who had no intention of studying for the ministry. Those doors were never again closed against young laymen\" (98-99)m\n\n\"Apparently the consideration which had led to the location of the institution in Fairfield District in 1836 was the feeling that this situation would be favorable for the manual labor experiment. When that failed in 1840 there was nothing in the needs of the institution which favored that particular site. It was far out in the country on a farm, remote from centers of population and the highways of travel. It was certainly not a suitable location for a theological seminary, for the young preachers needed contact with people.\" (96)m\n\n1850: \"James Furman recommended the purchase of 25 acres on a scenic hill south of town. The land, which we know today as University Ridge, off Church Street, was purchased from Vardry McBee for $150 an acre.\" if9-01\n\n\"Greenville, Anderson, Greenwood and possibly others were bidding for the institution; Dr. Furman, as chairman of the committee on location, had made an extensive tour of the upper part of the state in search of a site. It was generally agreed that the institution should be removed to this section because of the more salubrious climate, the larger proportion of white people, the cheaper living conditions, the denser Baptist population and the great number of streams providing water power for future manufacturing developments.\" (99)m\n\n\"Greenville was, in 1850, a mountain town of some 1750 inhabitants, while the Greenville District had a population of 20,000, mostly white.\" (103)m\n\n1851: \"Arrangements were made for the transfer of the Furman Theological Institution to Greenville and for the sale of the lands, buildings and equipment at Winnsboro . . . . The transfer was soon made, and the Theological Institution began its work in Greenville the first Monday in February, 1851.\" (102-103)m\n\n\"The land of the campus was purchased from Vardry McBee, the deed conveying the land to the State Convention being dated June 18, 1851, the sum paid was $3750.\" (104)m\n\n\"Professor Mims gave his time to theology, while Professor Edwards devoted himself largely to preparatory work in what was known as ‘The Furman University High School.’ Dr. Furman was giving his time to raising money.\" (104)m\n\n\"The first faculty of Furman University was actually completed in the fall of 1851 by the addition of a fourth professor, Charles Hallette Judson. As a matter of fact he was employed before the other three professors were legally transferred to the University and was therefore the very first professor engaged by the University. . .He was employed as Professor of Mathematics and Mechanical Philosophy, and was expected to lecture in the schools of Natural Philosophy and Descriptive Astronomy, and Chemistry and Natural History.\" (107-108)m\n\n\"It was thought by the convention that operations should be started with the erection of a building for the preparatory department. . .In consultation with Mr. [Ed C.] Jones [of Charleston] it was determined to adopt the Italian style of architecture for the preparatory building. . .The preparatory building was to carry a tower sixty or seventy feet high ‘on the left corner in front,’ and was to accommodate one hundred students . . . . but the board decided against the committee and the preparatory building was never erected.\" (110-111)m\n\n1852: \"Mr. Jones really determined the. . .style of architecture adopted for the main university building. . .Work was begun on the main building before August, 1852. . .the building seems to have been finished in 1854.\" (111)m\n\n\"The ‘Plan of Organization of Furman University’ was drawn up by the faculty. . .in August, 1852. It was consciously based upon the plans of the University of Virginia and Brown University. It provided for three departments – an academical, a collegiate and a theological department. These departments were to have separate and distinct faculties as far as possible, but one administrative force. . .The original plan contemplated a law school.\" (112)m\n\n\"The first session 68 students were enrolled.\" (115)m\n\n1853: \"In 1853 the board created the office of president and elected Dr. Basil Manly, Sr., the president of the University of Alabama, to fill this position. Upon his declining, the office remained vacant until Dr. Furman, who had in the meantime continued to be the chairman of the faculty, was elected to fill the position in 1859.\" (115)m\n\n\"While the students enjoyed large freedom in the choice and pursuit of their studies, there was strict supervision of their moral life. They were expected to behave as gentlemen at all places and on all occasions, and strict attention to their studies was a condition of their remaining in the university,\" . . . . \"99 students enrolled.\" (115)m\n\n1854: \"there were 206 [students enrolled].\" (115)m\n\n\"The convention met in Greenville in 1854 . . . establishing the ‘Greenville Baptist Female College [GFBC],’ on Tuesday, June 25, 1854.\" (119-120)m . . . . \"Offers were made to the convention by Anderson and Greenville. The offer of the latter city was the gift of the buildings and grounds of the Greenville Academies, and $20,000 in money.\" (120)m\n\n1855: \"when the first class was graduated from the collegiate department, 228 had matriculated . . . . This year 1855 marked the high point in attendance for half a century. The intense political excitement, threatening national disruption and civil war, was already well above the horizon and was having its deadening effects.\" (115-116)m\n\n\"Professor J.S. Mims died June 14, 1855, at the age of 38; lamented by all who knew him . . . . He was succeeded in the chair of theology by James Petigru Boyce of Charleston, elected July 23, 1855.\" (116)m\n\n\"Its [GFBC] first president, Rev. H.A. Duncan, was unanimously elected on Monday, July 23, 1855.\" (121)m\n\n1856: \"Appointed . . . . a committee to obtain a lot not exceeding half an acre for the burial purposes of Furman University.\" scbc\n\n\"Appointed Mr. T.E. Hart Adjunct Professor of Mathematics.\" scbc\n\n1857: \"In the catalogue of 1857 it is noted that there are two literary societies, ‘The Adelphian’ and ‘The Philosophian,’ that they have their own halls and libraries.\" (117)m\n\n1858: \"It [Southern Baptist Theological Seminary] took from Furman, James P. Boyce, the professor of theology and the financial genius of Southern Baptists; in addition all of Furman’s endowment fund raised for theological education, amounting to $26,000, and Furman’s theological library; it diverted the unbroken stream of Furman’s history since 1827, which had been theological education . . . . When the transfer was completed Furman was left with an endowment of only $33,613, was stripped of the appeal which had made it popular through the years, and was overshadowed by the greater institution which had risen out of its bosom and was standing at its doors. It is not strange that the next quarter of a century was a difficult road for Furman.\" (126)m\n\n1859: \"There was a general feeling in 1859 that the institution was in a healthy condition from an educational standpoint, but had been badly served financially . . . . The board now began to sell some of its land to meet their obligations, a mistake of the first magnitude, and solemnly vowed never again to use any of the permanent funds to meet current obligations.\" (127)m\n\n1860: \"The committee . . . . recommending that the Degree of Master of Arts and the Degree of Bachelor of Arts be conferred on the young gentlemen whose names have been proposed worthy to receive the honors of the University.\" scbc\n\n1861: \"The session closed without commencement exercise, but the degrees were conferred. It was the purpose of both faculty and trustees to resume work at the regular time in August, but no students came for four years and he college was not opened again till war was over . . . . Of the 155 who made up the last student body before the war, about one-third were killed, wounded, captured or died of disease.\" (128-129)m\n\n\"With the announcement of the necessity of defense of the State in the face of secession (1861), two hundred and sixty Furman students went forth for their beloved Southland, to battle for her traditions and their heritage.\" (17)b20\n\n1862: \"Respectfully suggest that they (Professors Furman and Judson) be regularly employed in this Institution (GWC) so long as the suspension of Furman University continues. They think the interests of the Female College might be materially advanced, for the time, by placing Professor Furman at its head and Professor Judson in charge of some one or more of its departments.\" scbc\n\n1863: \"In 1863 the first week witnessed the death of the fearless J.C. Sparks, one of Gen. Lee’s scouts. He fell at Catlett’s Station, and enjoyed the honor of being singled out of the Army of Northern Virginia and complimented by Gen. Lee for gallantry.\" (108)C\n\n1864: \"In 1864 the brave young Randolph Bacon laid down his life at Charleston, Va.

Hart, Chemistry and Natural Philosophy; John B. Patrick, English Language . . . . The student response was immediate and gratifying, the enrollment the first year being 140.\" (130)m\n\n\"Charges were made per school or department taken – one school $20, two schools $36, three schools $42, four schools $48.\" (131)m\n\n1867: \"The years 1866 and 1867 were made more distressing by the general failure of crops and visitations, especially of the caterpillar . . . . Only twenty-seven students were enrolled in February, 1868, and no commencement was held.\" (131-132)m\n\n\"Dr. Edwards had died suddenly May 5, 1867, and his place had not been permanently filled . . . . After a tour through the state in the late summer in search of funds Professor Lanneau resigned to accept a position in William Jewell College.\" (133)m\n\n1868: \"The funds of the University having shared in the common fate which has overtaken the material interests of the State, it was impracticable to resume the work of instructing without making the Faculty dependent for their support to a large extent upon the income from tuition. This necessitated an increased charge for tuition, and this increased charge operated unfavorably upon the attendance of pupils, when the losses of the war had to be added, the diminution of the mean of our people produced by the unfavorable seasons, and the devastations of the caterpillar with which we have been visited.\" scbc\n\n\"only 27 students were attending.\" (4)Br\n\n1869: \"Professor Judson returned to his chair of Mathematics and Mechanical Philosophy . . . . Sixty-nine students were matriculated in the year 1869.\" (133)m\n\n1870: \"That if there were no Baptist College in the State, it would now be our duty to commence efforts with a view to establish one, and that the foundation already laid by the energy and sacrifices of our fathers, not only affords opportunity, but imposes the obligations to rise up and build . . . . That it is indispensable to the success of the University, that an endowment of $100,000 be added to its funds, and that we will commence at once the effort to secure it.\" scbc\n\nThe college [GFC] closed for a few years as a result of “out-of-date scientific apparatus, no library, and one full-time faculty member”, but “re-opened in September 1870 with a part time faculty” (65-66)JTB\n\n1871: \"The student body numbered 50.\" (4)Br\n\n1872: \"[T]here were forty-five students, twenty of them professing Christians, nine preparing for the ministry.\" (137)m\n\n1873: \"That year saw 53 men in Fuman.\" (4)Br\n\n1874: \". . . . the next year (1874) 54 [enrolled].\" (4)Br\n\n1875: \"In November, 1875, the treasurer was able to report that $220,175 had been raised in bonds, of which he regarded $190,175 as certainly good.

The period of free tuition began, according to promise, in the college on January 1, 1876.\" (137)\n\n1876: \"The bond endowment of two hundred thousand was now complete, and the institution was to try to run on the income of this endowment, collecting only small incidental fees from the students. But the endowment campaign was hardly completed before difficulties began to accumulate. Five years had passed since some of the bonds had been taken, and the selfishness of human nature was beginning to assert itself. Many donors declined to pay either interest or principal on the ground that times were hard, as they undoubtedly were.\" (138)m\n\n\"Valedictorian Pauline Mendenhall reads her graduation essay at the Commencement ceremonies of the Female College, the first time a woman student has spoken in public in Greenville.\" (6)JTB\n\n1877: \"Cash collections from the churches were the only means by which the institution was kept going. All the bright promise of endowment was gone.\" (138)m\n\n1878: \"In 1878 the Convention, on the suggestion of the Board, reduced the number of Trustees to thirteen. It also changed the method of selecting them, giving the president of the Convention the power to name a committee to nominate trustees, subject, of course, to the approval of the body.\" (90)d\n\n\"The 'Baptist' was dropped from the name of the college, leaving the Greenville Female College. (67)JTB\n\nMary Judson “became ‘Lady Principal’ (the equivalent of dean of the college), the position that she was to hold until well after the turn of the century” (71)JTB\n\nAt Greenville Female College Mary Judson began a literary society at Townes’s suggestion. “The Judson Society was Greenville’s first organization for women.” (81)JTB\n\n1879: \"When some trustees insisted that the institution must be closed or the number of the faculty reduced, Professor Judson tendered his resignation . . . . In the midst of the discussion something was said which seemed to Dr. Furman to reflect on his work as president and he tendered his resignation as president and professor. The resignations of these honored brethren were immediately accepted.
