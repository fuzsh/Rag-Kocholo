        "text": "🎉Thrilled to Share Our Journey at Weihack 5.0!🚀 I’m excited to announce that alongside my brilliant team member, Anshika Arora, we participated in the renowned hackathon, Weihack 5.0, a 36-hours long women centric hackathon conducted by BVPIEEE, which witnessed participation from over 1800 teams nationwide. It was a rollercoaster of coding, collaboration, and creativity, and I’m proud to say that our team, Encoders, made it to the top 50!🏆 It was my first hackathon, and the experience was exhilarating. The event was a melting pot of ideas, where we not only honed our technical skills but also learned the importance of teamwork and perseverance. Our project aimed to create a safer world for women, travelers, and students by developing a website that predicts high-risk areas and suggests the safest travel times, while also providing historical crime data to inform users of potential dangers. The challenge was immense, but so was our passion for making a difference. Though we didn’t clinch the top spot, the hackathon was a win for us in so many other ways. We got to learn about the power of data analytics in real-world applications and the impact of technology on social issues. We experienced the excitement of turning a concept into a tangible product. We are not stopping here, the journey continues. We are dedicated to enhancing our project, refining its features, and improving its effectiveness. Stay tuned as we’ll be sharing the final version of our project soon. #Weihack5 #Hackathon #WomenSafety #DataAnalytics #Teamwork #Innovation\n\n📣 We’ve recently started interviewing past winners, runner-ups, and participants about their #GovHack #hackathon experiences. Over the coming weeks, we’ll be sharing these inspiring stories, so stay tuned! 🎶 To kick things off, we had the privilege of speaking with Esther Anderson, the winner of #GovHack 2018. Esther’s story is quite unique: She initially mentored at a Regional hackathon in Mandurah, WA, but ended up participating herself. Now, we can reasonably easily scale hackathons out into the country. However due to lower overall population numbers, it can be challenging to ensure higher show up rates. Undeterred, Esther decided to seize the opportunity and contribute to the hackathon. Her team developed an innovative app called SeeCHANGE, designed to make regional towns more appealing to potential residents. SeeCHANGE functions like a wizard: users input their requirements—such as job availability, local amenities, and proximity to schools—and receive a recommendation with a percentage score indicating how well different towns match their criteria. For example, it considers proximity to suitable local hospitals for those with health conditions. Team Hack aPeel created this app because they hadn't seen a comprehensive solution for relocating to country areas. To make it work, SeeCHANGE utilised a wide range of government #opendata sets. Team Hack aPeel came up with this idea, because they hadn't seen an app that acted like a one-stop-shop for sea changes. To achieve this SeeCHANGE pulled in a whole host of government #opendata sets. End of story? Not quite! Team Hack aPeel scored big: they won both the Regional WA and National awards in their category. This is a testament to how flexibility, creativity, and determination can lead a small regional team to national success!
