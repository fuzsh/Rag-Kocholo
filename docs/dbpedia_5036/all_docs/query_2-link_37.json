        "text": "Guest Feature | Lotfi Wada\n\nGoal in collaboration with African Football HQ , are delighted to present the latest instalment of our series celebrating the greatest club sides in the history of the continent’s game.\n\nFourth place in our rankings are Esperance's magnificent generation of 1994-98, the first side to win an unprecedented Grand Slam.\n\nFollow the team at African Football HQ for some of the finest news and stats related to the continental game.\n\nWhen Esperance entered the 1994 African Cup of Champions Clubs, they had recently been crowned Arab champions, had recruited Zambia hitman Kenneth Malitoli, and believed they were firmly on their way to the holiest grail in the continental game.\n\nHowever, the quarter-finals, they came up against1 988 finalists Iwuanyanwu Nationale—now known as Heartland FC—a much tougher test than EF Ouagadougou, who Esperance had thrashed 8-2 in the First Round.\n\nThe first leg proved to be a straightforward affair at El Menzah as Esperance cruised past their guests and took a 3-0 advantage in their luggage before travelling to Nigeria.\n\nFacing an Iwuanyanwu team marred by the Oriental Airlines drama and struggling to combat a very electric atmosphere, Esperance passed their first test of the competition and then dispatched MC Oran in the semi-final to set up a final showdown with reigning champions SC Zamalek and their constellation of stars.\n\nFollowing a nervy goalless draw in Cairo, everything was to play for in El Menzah, and the stadium was already full two hours before kickoff.\n\nEsperance took a deserved lead in the 16th minute when unlikely hero Hedi Berrikhissa connected with a corner, and their lead was doubled from the spot in the second half by Ali Ben Neji after Abdelkader Belhassen had been tripped in Zamalek’s box.\n\nIn the 62nd minute, Berrikhissa added a third with a memorable finish, and Effat Nssar’s late goal for the Egyptian giants was little more than a consolation.\n\nEsperance had won their first African crown, and their glorious era had begun.\n\nThey duly dismantled DC Motema Pembe on the Mediterranean coast to win the Caf Super Cup in 1995, and then defeated Thai Farmers Bank to clinch the Afro-Asian Cup.\n\nIn 1997, the club were hit by tragedy when left-back Berrikhissa—the hero of 1994—died of a heart attack during a friendly against Olympique Lyonnais, and his passing cast a shadow over their African Cup Winner’s Cup campaign.\n\nThey entered the competition with the will to honour the memory of their late hero, and became the first African club to win the final of all Caf competitions.\n\nAngolans Petro Atletico stood in their way, and after a 1-0 defeat in the first leg at Estadio Citadela, Esperance had it all to do.\n\nOnly a win would do in front of their own fans.\n\nEsperance were dangerous almost whenever they had the ball, but were denied by the Angolan block on countless occasions.\n\nTheir best chances came through set pieces, as both Zied Tlemcani and a young Khaled Badra finally broke down the yellow & blue wall.\n\nEsperance's fourth African title in four years was secured, and they wrapped the trophy in Berrikhissa’s famous Number Five jersey as they lifted the trophy into the sky to honour his memory.\n\nEntering the 1998 African Cup Winners as Tunisian league runners-up, the Mkackhas’ aim was the trophy…the only one missing from their cabinet…nothing less would do.\n\nPowered by experienced players like Chokri El Ouaer, Tarek Thabet, Ayadi Hamrouni and budding talents like Radhi Jaidi and Sofiane Melliti, Esperance had a bumpy road to the final, where they eventually met another Angolan powerhouse—Primeiro de Agosto.\n\nThey were caught cold in the opening seconds of the first leg by Teka, but answered through Jaidi, before taking a two-goal advantage via the Black Pearl Hamrouni and Lotfi Laaroussi.\n\nThe Blood & Gold landed in the military airport of Luanda with an encouraging but fragile two-goal lead.\n\nDays after their reported recovery session on their hotel roof, the Mkachkha entered the Citadela for the second leg, where 60,000 fans—and an unknown number of paratroopers—were waiting for them.\n\nIn an electric atmosphere, Primeiro Agosto controversially took the lead courtesy of Makaya Nzilulu (who later joined Esperance), with Ayadi Hamrouni failing to level on the day with a remarkable miss moments later.\n\nEsperance appeared to be on the ropes after coming out after the break, when Hassan Gabsi was dismissed.\n\nPlaying with a man down, Esperance had no choice but to defend their fragile lead, although their strategy looked not to have paid off when they conceded a dubious penalty after the ball rebounded of Jaidi’s back.\n\nEl Ouaer proved himself to be the man for the big occasion with a fine save to keep the Tunisians’ heads above water, and his stop also prompted the visitors to swell in confidence.\n\nMelliti’s late deflection gave Esperance a 1-1 draw on the day, and a 4-2 aggregate triumph.\n\n\"Dear Esperance fans, we've finally won all the African trophies possible\" said an emotional el Ouaer in a post match interview.\n\nEsperance had achieved an unprecedented Grand Slam (Champions League, CAF Cup, Afro-Asian Super Cup, African Cup Winners Cup, CAF Super Cup) in just five years; a memorable feat which prompted magazine Jeune Afrique to dub the side ‘The Ogre of Africa’."
