        "text": "The purpose of this study was to determine the syntactic ability and the form of syntactic errors at the writing of deaf students at the senior high school level of Public Special School (SLBN) 1 Sumbawa. Participants in this study were five students consisting of 1 of the10th grade, 3 of the 11th students, and 1 of the 12th grade. The research was qualitative, while the data were collected using written tests. For the data analysis, the researchers used the theory of Chaer about syntactic functions and devices. The results of the study show that the forms of errors in the student&#39;s writing consist of errors on the use of subjects, predicates, objects, and adverbs. Other forms of errors lie in the order of words, word forms, and use of conjunction. Another finding is that some students were able to compile sentences based on S + Adv + P, while the other students were only able to compile sentences with the S + Adj pattern. Based on these findings, it is expected that parents or ...\n\nIn school, deaf and hard of hearing students (d/hh) are often exposed to American Sign Language (ASL) while also developing literacy skills in English. ASL does not have a written form, but is a fully accessible language to the d/hh through which it is possible to mediate understanding, draw on prior experiences, and engage critical thinking and reasoning (Allington & Johnston, 2002; Vygotsky, 1987; Wertsch, 1991). This study investigates the impact of Strategic and Interactive Writing Instruction (SIWI) on the development of signed expressive language (ASL) and written English. Our analysis demonstrates that a focus on ASL did not detract from students' writing growth in English. Instead, a focus on building ASL and written English proficiency simultaneously resulted in significant gains in both language and writing. Students who are deaf and hard of hearing (d/hh) have historically experienced significant difficulty developing literacy skills past elementary grade levels (Musselman One of the sources of challenge for d/hh students is that they are often learning to read and write in English while simultaneously developing a language 1 for communicative purposes (Clark, Gilbert, & Anderson, 2011). English is not easily acquired by d/hh students (Jackendoff, 1994), and while sign language is fully accessible to d/hh for acquisition, it is not often readily available in home environments. As such, many d/hh are language deprived due to inaccessible or impoverished language environments (Kuntz,1998). Without the use of complex language as a tool to mediate understanding of events, draw on prior experiences, and engage students in critical thinking and reasoning (Vygotsky, 1989; Wertsch, 1991), learning is severely impacted. We view development of expressive language as a necessary prerequisite to literacy achievement, and that persistent language deprivation among d/hh students is the greatest contributor to literacy struggle. Strategic and Interactive Writing Instruction (SIWI) is an instructional approach that has been linked with improvements in word-, sentence-, and discourse-level English writing\n\nDeaf educational methods have been the subject of controversy among advocates of the oralist and the bilingual approaches for centuries. Over the past decades, the bilingual-bicultural method has proved its effectiveness in facilitating formal school learning and downscaling a higher rate of illiteracy compared to the hearing population. The bilingual-bicultural model in Western countries is designed and implemented in predominantly monolingual contexts or multilingual contexts with a dominant majority language. It aims at providing deaf learners with a simultaneous dual access to the deaf and hearing cultures through sign language and the written form of the majority spoken language. The objective of this dual access is to create a balanced form of bilingualism which will reinforce literacy development. In the Western context, the relative proximity of the written and spoken forms of the majority language allows the written form to function as a means of access to the socio-cultura..."
