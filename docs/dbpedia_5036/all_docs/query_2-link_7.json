        "text": "I always thought Carthaginians were Phoenicians.\n\nOver time they culturally started to acquire their own specificities and when it comes to its population carthaginians were obviously not simply phoenicians living in North Africa but they assimilated many north africans and of course people from their former colonies in Europe. Also their military conquests were done thanks to soldiers from the west mediterranean basin mostly north african and iberian soldiers.\n\nThe close relations maintained between the Punic and Numidian spheres are illustrated finally by the many testimonies of interbreeding: the matrimonial relations between the Punic and Numidian aristocracy were frequent, just like the mixed marriages between people - genealogies indicated on Neopunic inscriptions present names of Libyan and Punic origin which mix. One sees it, the bonds between Carthage and its hinterland were important. How can one still doubt this when one considers the power reached by the African metropolis in the western Mediterranean? Could it have maintained its hegemony and confronted the great powers of the time without being able to have the human and economic resources of North Africa, as well as a large territorial base? It is a fact that most of the Punic troops were composed of African elements, whether Libyan or Numidian, or that African populations colonized territories directly controlled by Carthage in the Mediterranean islands or in Iberia.\n\nKhaled Melliti, Carthage, histoire d'une métropole méditerranéenne, 2016, p. 74-75\n\nThis period of colonial expansion had a marked influence on the race. It was not possible to organize all these new foundations with only Phoenician elements. These only provided the framework of these colonies, the mass was borrowed from the local Libyan population led by Libyan-Phoenician half-breeds. The ancient authors left us information not doubtful on this form of colonization. Diodorus says thus, that Theuna in Sicily was founded by Carthage, which sent there some of the citizens of the city and those of the Libyans who wanted to benefit from the occasion (XIII LXIX.8). Cicero, in his speech Pro Scauro (XIX, 42) mentions the same procedures of emigration.\n\nFor punico-numidian couples, the testimonies are not lacking. According to Stéphane Gsell, \"the Carthaginians did not have the prejudice of blood. These mixed marriages must have been especially frequent between Carthaginians and Libyans or Numidians.\n\nM. Fantar, A propos de la présence des Grecs A Carthage, p. 12\n\nCertain ritual practices observable in the burials on the other hand, refer to the Libyan contribution, which had every chance of being an important component and even probably a large majority of the population of Carthage pat the beginning of the seventh century, i.e. three or four generations after the foundation of the city, if we stick to the traditional date. Thus the ritual of applying a thick layer of bright red blush, made of cinnabar, to the face of the dead, which was then deposited on the bones of the face after the flesh had dissipated (S. Lancel, 1979, pp. 256-258). [This practice is not Phoenician, but indigenous and much more attested in the provincial \"Libyan\" environment (in the Cape Bon and in the Sahel and even further away, in Tipasa, in Algeria) than in Carthage itself.\n\nSerge Lancel, Carthage, p. 76 (ebook)\n\nThe 'Phoenicians' is simply the Greek term for the Canaanites. The Carthaginians continued to view themselves as Canaanites - that is what they called themselves - right down to the end of their existence.\n\nCarthaginians formed there own identity in the same sense that the Eastern Romans formed their own 'Byzantine' identity, but they were still Romans and we should identify them as such. Same goes with the Carthaginians still being Phoenicians/Canaanites even if they came to have a distinct identity.\n\nIt isn't as simple as that, many modern north africans identify as arabs yet it doesn't mean they are saudis living in North Africa and what's even more surprising is that even non-punic groups likes the libyans or moors were thought to have come from Canaan :\n\nMore generally, the insistence placed in these genealogical or mythical constructions on the link between Canaanites and Africans could find its origin, as many scholars have argued over the last century, in an early confusion, from the Hellenistic period, between Punic and African, insofar as the original land of the former, Phoenicia, was sometimes also defined as a part of the land of Canaan. Lacking original information, and unable to accept (with a few exceptions such as Flavius Josephus) the materials bequeathed by Greek tradition, Jewish commentators, eager to offer a complete and up-to-date explanatory system of the diversity of human populations, would thus have first made the ancient Berbers cousins of the Phoenicians, and then would have attributed to them as their original home this land of Canaan whose ancient inhabitants had met a mysterious fate after Joshua.\n\nMythes d’origine des Berbères (Antiquité et Moyen Âge)\n\nS’il est probable que les Berbères ont eu dans l’Antiquité des mythes expliquant l’origine de leurs différents groupements, ceux-ci, faute de textes conservés, restent inconnus. En revanche, eux-mê...\n\nSo you should not underestimate the process of assimilation ; the fact is that local populations whether european or african participated in the elaboration of this civilization and that they identify as x or y isn't going to change that."
