        "text": "MakerLab is a Tunisian tech startup specialized in developing customized embedded systems and mechatronics projects to industrials.\n\nIn MakerLab, we believe in the Open Source Hardware philosophy and we want to spread the tech knowledge we gain, with the community so everyone performs itself and benefits from others experiences. And this is why, we made from our little space in Sousse, a TechSpace, open for everyone who wants to work on real projects, finding all what a Maker needs to create his own tech project.\n\nIn our TechSpace, many projects were developed and created, even if it is by our staff or by students from different universities across the country, starting from Drones, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, arriving to Robotic Arms and CNC Machines.\n\nMoreover, this 5 Axis CNC Machine, is our first Open Source Hardware Project we made, and which we are so happy sharing it with the community. You can find more details on our TechSpace in our:\n\nLien Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/tunmakerlab/ Lien siteweb : https://makerlab.tn/\n\nThis 5 axis CNC machine, is part of a big project made by our partners Open Lab Hamburg from the Helmut Schmidt University in Germany, for the benefit and with the collaboration of FABLAB ENIT (National School of Engineering of Tunis), and sponsored by the BMBF.\n\nMachine Building Workshop\n\nThis project consists of organizing a one-week workshop for building machines, and we, MakerLab’s staff, are happy and glad to be part of this first of its kind project in our beloved country, Tunisia.\n\nBeing always updated to the latest OSHW projects in the community, we found that there is many 3 Axis CNC machines, 3D Printers and Laser Cutter with a very good documentation, but not enough OSHW 5 Axis CNC machines and not at all for the Head/Head type.\n\nCARVER X5 Machine\n\nSo we thought we could create the first OSHW, Head/Head, double swivel head form, 5 Axis CNC Machine. We tried our best to make it both robust and easily replicable machine. Constructed mainly from Heavy Aluminum Extrusion profiles, and thick aluminum milled parts, HGR25 Linear guides, using NEMA23 Stepper motors, and Rack and pinion for transmission, Carver X5 is capable of milling materials like wood, plastics and composite materials.\n\nDimensions 5xm600 : 650 x 670 x 480mm\n\nWorking volume 5xm600 : 990 x 780 x 1000mm\n\nMax travel speed XYZ : 15000mm/min (X,Y); 3000-6000mm/min (Z)\n\nMax travel speed BC : 20rpm(C) 20rpm(B)\n\nMotors used : NEMA 23 ( X / Y / Z / B / C)\n\nLinear guides : HIWIN High accuracy Rails and Blocks\n\nStructure material : Anodized Aluminum\n\nProtection : 5mm Acrylic enclosure\n\nPower requirements : 1200W, 220V, 60hz, 13A\n\nWeight : 85kg\n\nComputer interface : USB\n\nComputer requirements : Windows operating system with Mach3\n\nController : MACH3 (to be purchased separately from an official vendor)\n\nSoftware : supports any CAD/CAM software\n\nCNC machines are commonly known that they are nothing more than automated robots, their famous type, is a 3 axis CNC machines, which are considered as 3P robots (robot with 3 Prismatic Joints linked with 4 Links).\n\nBut in 5 axis CNC machines we talk about 3P2R robots, because they are composed of 3 Prismatic Joints succeeded with 2 Revolute Joints, and linked with 6 Links.\n\nCARVER X5 Design\n\nOur Joints are named (X, Y, Z, C & B)\n\nThe Links are named : Frame, Y2X Bridge, X2Z, Z Axis, Swivel Head and the Spindle.\n\nDesigned to be easily made, assembled and disassembled, we choose the aluminum profile to be the main structure composition. As it's important that the structure be stiff and robust, we wanted to work with 45 series aluminum profiles.\n\nMachine Frame\n\nThe machine frame contains the rails and transmission rack of the Y-axis that will carry the other entire axis, this is why we worked with the 45x90 aluminum profiles in the top stage. The frame carries the mechanical stops; they include a screw to adjust the limit position.\n\nThe Y2X Bridge is the second link in our 5-axis CNC machine, it links the Y and X joints.\n\nY2X Bridge\n\nConstructed from two perpendicular 45x90 aluminum profile and two 15mm aluminum plate flanks on which will be installed the Y-axis sliding blocks.\n\nX2Z, as its name indicates, do the function of the joint between the two prismatic axis, X and Z. X2Z is an assembly that plays a big role in our 5 Axis CNC Machine, because it assures both, the linear guiding of X axis, Z axis and their transmission organs.\n\nX2Z\n\nBuilt totally from thick aluminum plates, X2Z contains the sliding blocks of X-axis installed on its back, and those of the Z-axis, installed between the two X2Z flank plates. On the X2Z assembly, get installed the X Motor Module and the Z-axis ball bearing Nut.\n\nThe Z-axis, slides on the 2 blocks installed on the X2Z Flank plates. The motor module installed on its top assures its motion. The Z motor transmit rotation to the ball screw that moves the Z-axis up and down.\n\nZ Axis\n\nIn its bottom is installed the swivel head that rotates the end effector around 2 axis.\n\nThe swivel head is composed from the last two revolute joints, C & B. What is special about this assembly, is the fact that it should be the more compact possible. So the two motors, their transmission system and even the limit switches and connectors should all be enclosed in this assembly, and this was the hardest task that we encountered in the whole machine design. While designing the Swivel Head, there was 2 big challenges, the choice of transmission system and minimizing joints offset relatively to each other.\n\nSwivel Head\n\nThere is challenge because C and B axis will handle big effort while milling, and if mounted directly on the motor shaft or even through a reversible transmission system, this may cause a loss in steps when encountering big efforts. This obliged as to work with worm gear, which is an irreversible transmission system.\n\nFor the spindle motor, we did our best to find small and powerful, and not too expensive ones in the market, but we found none. The main specification needed is a small size, but the most of powerful spindles are so big that you cannot integrate in the swivel head. This is why we designed and fabricated our own spindle composed of a 540W Brushless motor, a bearing housing and an ER11 chuck.\n\nSpindle Motor\n\nThe spindle motor is capable of a max velocity of 20000 RPM at 24V, and has enough torque for milling wood and plastics.\n\nMachine movement along X, Y and Z Axis is assured by 4 motor modules. Containing pulley and belt transmission system between the motor shaft and the shaft.\n\nX/Y Axis Motor Module\n\nZ Axis Motor Module\n\n## 4. Electronic enclosure\n\nInstalled in an industrial plastic enclosure (400x500x240), the electronics of the CARVER X5 is composed of a set of drivers for each motor including the spindle driver, a USB interface control board, a sensor interface board and two 12v 42A DC Power Supply.\n\n​\n\n▪ THE PoKeys57CNC control board PoKeys57CNC USB and Ethernet CNC controller is a blend between general purpose PoKeys device and motor controller. The device is targeted primarily for controlling up to 8 STEP/DIR signal driven motors (stepper motors, servo drives, etc.) in various applications with the addition of powerful PoKeys device features.\n\nDownload PoKeys57CNC datasheet here.\n\n▪ Drivers TB6600 Stepper Motor Driver is an easy-to-use stepper motor driver, which could control a two-phase stepping motor. It is compatible with Arduino and other microcontrollers that can output a 5V digital pulse signal. TB6600 stepper motor driver has a wide range power input, 9~42VDC power supply. And it is able to output 4A peak current, which is enough for the most of stepper motors. The stepper driver supports speed and direction control. You can set its micro step and output current with 6 DIP switch.\n\nDownload TB6600 datasheet here.\n\n▪ The sensor cables gatherer board The need for the sensor cable gatherer board has emerged due to the multiplicity of sensors. And to minimize the number of cables passing through the cables carrier, first, we managed to gather them in a 15 cores VGA cable, then we choose to use 2 DB9 ports and cables, one for Limites (+), and the other for Limites (-).\n\nThis board provides the current and voltage needed to all the 10 sensors used in the machine and the toggle switch, and is installed on the Y2X Bridge in between the two cables carrier.\n\n(Board KiCAD)\n\n▪ The sensors interface board This board will play the role of the interface between sensors signals coming from the first board and the pokeys57cnc board through a little circuit of signal adaptation.\n\nInductive proximity switches works with 12V power supply, and returns a 12V digital signal, but the pokeys57cnc can only handle 5V digital signal in limit switches inputs.\n\nThis is why we used a circuit based on a 470 ohm resistor for current limiting and a 5.1V zener diode to let only the needed 5V pass to the control board for each signal.\n\n▪ Spindle motor Driver As we created our own spindle based on brushless DC Motor, we used its recommended Electronic Speed Controller as a driver. A 60A ESC is responsible of driving the motor at 20 000 RPM at 24V. Product page Link.\n\nOne main task we did is the wiring, and it is so important. We used RGB 4 wire Cables for the stepper motors, they are thick enough to carry the needed current. The end stop switches cables were long enough to reach the first interface board installed on the bridge assembly. We gathered all sensors signals in two RS232 cables to facilitate connection. Of course all these cables needed a way to be placed in, so we used 57x25 industrial cable carrier to arrange all wires to the electronic enclosure.\n\nFusion 360 combines industrial and mechanical design, simulation, collaboration, and machining in an integrated concept-to-production toolset. Fusion 360 is the first 3D CAD, CAM, and CAE tool of its kind. It connects your entire product development process in a single cloud-based platform that work both on PC and MAC.\n\nDownload Link.\n\nPoKeys software setup package contains PoKeys configuration tool (also used for firmware updating), USB drivers, manuals, PoBlocks tool, Mach3 plugin etc. After installation, run the PoKeys application to update the firmware of PoKeys devices.\n\nConfiguration explanation video Link.\n\nDownload Link.\n\nMach3 turns a typical computer into a CNC machine controller.

Actually, we are manufacturing the double swivel head and the spindle system. We moved the X,Y,& Z Axis with the Pokeys57 and Mach3, and we are working on the CARVER X5 post processor for FUSION 360. We will update regularly this project in every progress we make, and we hope that this will be helpful for the whole OpenSourceHardWare Community !! Don't forget to interact with us, send your notes or eventually you amelioration ideas !!\n\nEverything has to end, and so did the Open Source 5 Axis CNC Building Workshop! This workshop passed in an amazing way, and was a great success for all of MakerLab's team! The knowledge of one month of machine design, followed by two months of fabrication and assembly, shared with amazing people from all over Tunisia, gathered in FabLab ENIT seeking one unique goal: Learn how to construct Machines! And today, this same knowledge is being shared with the whole DIY & Open Source Hardware community.\n\nThis project was launched by Open Lab Hamburg from Helmut Schmidt University, sponsored by BMBF, which we thank a lot for their confidence and the opportunity they gave to us as a startup. This Workshop was hosted by FabLab ENIT, and was successful thanks to the devotion of the participants who are from now on \"Machines Makers\".\n\nWe would like to thank all the FabLab ENIT Team, 4C Center, ENIT administrative staff for their collaboration.
