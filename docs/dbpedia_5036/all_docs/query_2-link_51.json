Leave your e-mail address\n\nGROUP A\n\n[ the teams ] [ week 1 ] [ week 2 ] [ week 3 ] [ week 4 ] [ week 5 ] [ week 6 ]\n\nBefore week 1: team previews A difficulty of the portraits and for the teams\n\nIn some countries the competitions are played over the year (January to December) and in others like the West European football calender (July to June). So some teams, who just finished their championships and start into a new one, might have changed faces and form. This is the case for Espérance Tunis, Mamelodi Sundowns, Lobi Stars, and Al Ahly. The latter two have just finished their championships last week so they might have no form problems. Apart from the fact that they do not seem to have a real break at all.\n\nEspérance Tunis (Tunis, Tunisia)\n\nEspérance have been last years finalist and only beaten on a penalty shoot-out. They are favorites to win the group with their blend of the Tunisian player elite and some African stars like Julius Aghahowa from Nigeria or Makaya Nsilulu from the DR Congo. They have just defended their Tunisian title and will return to Champions League next year. But if reports are correct they will be without their star defender Khaled Badra who is said to have left for Turkey. Aghahowa seems in a bad shape as he has been sent home by Nigerian national team coach Bonfrere for overweight. So attack might rely on the strong midfield with Nsilulu, Gabsi, Kanzari, Azaiez, and Chihi, and youngster Ali Zitouni in attack. Last year in group matches they were a class of their own, like a hot knife cutting through butter, only to be denied the triumph by the concrete wall of Raja Casablanca in the final. This year they might face more difficulties.\n\nThe face of the squad has changed a lot: a new coach and several new players including Brazilians Reinaldo and Adailton (not to be confused with the same name striker who rerecntly played at Italy and once was a highlight at the under20 World Cup 1997)\n\nofficial information by cafonline:\n\nE.S.T.

Here this could be numbers 1 to 25. For the second half of the year, which is the group phase and in many countries as well the beginning of a new season, new players can be added. Those might be #26 to #30 here (El Ouaer was in negotiations for a new contract when the players for the first half became registered and did not play in the qualification phase). This also means that not all players listed here are still with the club. For example Khaled Badra has left Espérance. And it also means shirt number distribution can have changed.\n\nMamelodi Sundowns (Pretoria, South Africa)\n\nOnly once a South African team has made an impact in the few years since the country overcame Apartheid and was allowed to take part in the African competitions: The Orlando Pitrates won the then African Cup Of Champions 1995 in a lucky 2nd leg match at ASEC Abidjan. Since then most teams have been disappointing and the Mamelodi Sundowns themselves have had some difficulties in reaching the group stage. But they could be a strong contender: they have just defended their South African champions title and have hired star coach Clemens Westerhof to extend their impact on the African scene.\n\nofficial information by cafonline:\n\nSUNDOWNS (South Africa)\n\nADDRESS: 133 Presmall Bld., Johannesburg\n\nTel: 27/11/3374150\n\nFax: 27/11/3332182\n\nSTADIUM: Loftus stadium (55 000)\n\nCLUB PRESIDENT: A.

Those might be #26 to #27 here (guessed). This also means that not all players listed are necessarily still with the club. And it also means shirt number distribution can have changed.\n\nAfrica Sports (Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire)\n\nIt is from Côte d'Ivoire where the arguably two strongest West African club enterprises come: The two Abidjan clubs ASEC and Africa Sports. They dominate the home scene completely and are attractive for regional talent as a stepping stone for a big European career. Last year Africa Sports have replaced ASEC as champions, who had made a couragous shift to their youth talents to rebuild their team. But Africa Sports have talent themselves like the conspicious Fadel Keita and they have won the African Cup Of Cup Winners 1999. Africa Sports have a prominent local coach in Yeo Martial, who coached the national team to African Cup Of Nations victory in 1992 and have hired Nigerian veteran striker Rashidi Yekini to back up Keita earlier this year.\n\nofficial information by cafonline:\n\nAFRICA SPORTS (Côte D'Ivoire)\n\nFounded 1948\n\nTel: 225/21250388\n\nFax: 225/212561\n\nCLUBPRESIDENT: Dore Lansine\n\nSTADIUM: Stade Houphout Boigny (40 000)\n\nChampion of the National League 14 times: 1967, 68, 71, 77, 78, 82, 83, 85, ,86, 87, 88, 89, 96, 99\n\nChampion of the National Cup 11 times: 1961, 64, 77, 78, 79, 81, 82, 85, 86, 93, 98\n\n*missing information here: Africa Sports are also winners of African International cup competitions like the African Cup Of Cup Winners 1999 (completed list will follow)\n\nList of players for the 2000 CAF Champions League*\n\n1 Tizie Jean Jacques, 07.09.72\n\n2 Kamara Ibrahima, 17.05.66\n\n3 Mariko Seydou, 26.04.77\n\n4 Timite Moussa, 02.04.75\n\n5 Diomande Ibrahima, 28.10.69\n\n6 N'Keoua Jean-Sylvestre, .12.69\n\n7 Kone Clofie Adama 03.11.67\n\n8 Babou Eric, 07.01.73\n\n9 Gatto Gae Jacob, 06.07.76\n\n10 Komara Yacouba ,08.01.71\n\n11 Gondo Houede Elie, 05.05.77\n\n12 Alhassane Issoufou, 01.01.81\n\n13 Keita Amadou Fadel, 31.12.76\n\n14 Keita Abdul Kader, 06.08.81\n\n15 Kone Brahima, 26.07.69\n\n16 Zeze Tape Eustache, 20.11.75\n\n17 Toura Aboubacar, 27.01.68\n\n18 Doumbia Moussa, 01.01.79\n\n19 Diomande Lacina ,24.06.69\n\n20 Dao Lassina, 06.02.71\n\n21 Traore Yahaya, 15.02.77\n\n22 Kone Lacina, 25.08.82\n\n23 Loue Gnoleba Edgard, 27.12.82\n\n24 Tetiali Daleba Vincent, 05.01.80\n\n25 Dadie Hyacinthe Pacome, 01.02.74\n\n26 Seri Ambroise, 07.02.74\n\n27 Djohore Kouassike Simplice, 03.04.73\n\n28 Rasheed Yekini\n\n29 Oulay Guy Arsene\n\n30 Agassa Kossi\n\nSable de Batié (Bafoussam, Cameroon)\n\nSable de Batié are clearly the outsiders of the group. They are a very young club from Bafoussam in the North East of Cameroon and so they are a no-name in African competitions. The Cameroon club scene, once among the top of the continent has lost its impact on the African competitions. While talents are produced on and on but emmigrating, no club has emerged recently to challenge for the African title. It is conspicious how champions change every year and the clubs can not stabilize success. The team is mainly feared for the point that they are completely unknown to the others.

After 80 minutes Isaac Shai scored the second goal for a valuable win for the South Africans whose most conspicious player in the last minutes was the tricky Bapela.\n\nEsperance Tunis - Sable de Batié 4:0\n\n> detailed match report on extra page\n\nweek2 Aug 4-6, 2000 Sable de Batié - Sundowns 1:2\n\nThe match had to be postponed one day and moved to Douala because of heavy rain.
