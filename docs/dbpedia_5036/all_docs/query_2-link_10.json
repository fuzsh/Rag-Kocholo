        "text": "2The topic of centralization and attempted decentralization in Egypt was one of the key points in current President Abdel Fatah el-Sissi’s 2014 campaign. In 2011, former Prime Minister (PM) Essam Sharaf, who presided during the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces’ (SCAF) rule, cancelled the 2008 decision for the formation of the Helwan and 6th of October governorates. The current president put forward a plan to change the surface area occupied by several governorates and to create three new governorates, increasing the national total to 30. The development and mobilization of these changes in 2014 – a period still marked by contention within the country–are important in understanding the problems and prospects of Egypt’s territorial decisions related to political centralization and decentralization.\n\nIndependence of Egypt and Key Political Actors\n\n10At the same time, the MB sees itself as the most active, organized and oldest social movement in the country; within its internal discourse, members claim a special connection with the people. The use of religion as a political tool gives the MB a common language, when addressing society as a whole, under the umbrella of the al-da’wa (religious call) of the people. However, the main goal behind their use of religion is the development of an internal discourse that supports the group’s political aspirations, as noted by scholars such as Brynjar Lia and Tariq al-Bishri (al-Bishri 2002 and Lia 2015). The framework of Gramsci’s notion of common sense is very relevant here, because of the availability of religion and its convenience to organizations like the MB who use it as a ready-made common sense (Gramsci 1988).\n\n11Nevertheless, in relation to the 2011 uprising, it is questionable whether the army or MB had a special connection with the people as claimed. A detachment from the people grew more evident as events continued to unravel following 2011. As political – and economic – elite both the army and MB positioned themselves as superior to the people. This is evident in many recent and historical examples of confrontation between these political actors and the people as a politicized mass.\n\nAnatomy of a Political Territorial Distribution\n\n12The MB and the army have had a rocky relationship since 2011 due to the political rivalry that began between them as contingent political actors. Partisans of both actors repeated symbols, slogans and discourse that deepened the wound in this political relationship and increased the power struggle. This section is an attempt to briefly revisit the relationship between the army and MB during the 20th century while reflecting upon this relationship’s effect on their territorial distribution. Using a bottom-up approach to the analysis of the inherit centralization of these political actors, the findings are reminiscent of the transition from colonialism to independence.\n\nThe MB: decentralized or centralized?\n\n16The outlined structure of the MB should not be taken for granted when examining its effects on the diffusion of its historical, political and socio-religious discourse. Al-Bishri describes the MB’s use of religion as an attempt to monopolize religion in the social and political spheres (al-Bishri 2002), which could be analytically traced back to the lack of connection and shared common sense with people outside of religious discourse. The MB has historical lineage in each governorate, and stories about the first members in each governorate and their connections with the founder el-Banna remain important (al-Bishri 2002). However, these links are also the outcome of repression by the army during the late 1950s up until the 1970s. With the lack of infrastructure during this period –still largely the case outside of the key governorates – Aswan was considered an exile. The MB, unlike the army, had the ability to be physically and socially present in all governorates. The MB’s presence near the borders with the Palestinian territories, Sinai, and the surrounding areas during the years following the Camp David accord, served to enforce the Sadat-Mubarak regimes and the MB’s political power.\n\n17Another aspect that supports the MB’s territorial distribution and centralized internal governance is their interpretation and use of the concept of obedience (or ‘ta’a). This concept is the backbone of the organization’s hierarchical structure and is diffused from the lower, student ranks to the highest. The MB leaders claim that obedience of the members is a “must” in order to maintain unity. This explains how MB leaders and members are mobilized or demobilized according to the Bureau’s orders including those in Greater Cairo, in other governorates, or those coming to demonstrate in Greater Cairo. While this instills rigid internal boundaries between leaders and members, it also gives flexibility for the MB Bureau (or the internal leaders) and its presence as a political actor. The MB was able to officially decide not to participate in the general strike of 2008 or 2011, and did not mobilize its members. But at the same time it used its autonomous members’ participation to demonstrate its strength from the beginning and enforce its recurrent rhetoric of clandestine presence (Vannetzel 2016).\n\nThe Army and its Centralization\n\n19The army today follows the same organizational structure as determined by Nasser in 1967, with the exception of el-Sissi’s recent addition of the Quick Intervention Forces in 2014. The army, however, remains a distant political actor compared to the MB. The army is socially feared and shut off from the public. The famous motto “the army is for the army” remains salient.\n\n20Conscriptions to the army are not divided by governorate, so the army does not have a physical manifestation or representative in each of the 27 governorates ( in the process of becoming 30 governorates in 2014). Therefore, the army is not visible across the territory, nor in all governorates. Conscripts are referred to collective offices that gather candidates from several governorates at a time. The army’s presence is heavier in certain governorates like Cairo, Alexandria, Ismailia, Suez and Port Said, among which the first, second and third Field Armies are divided.\n\n22The army as a political actor is highly centralized in the governorates mentioned above. In governorates where the MB has a strong presence, a governor with a military background is usually appointed (Springborg 1989). The physical presence of the army today in some areas like Sinai changed the status of the army in the area as a political actor and security apparatus.\n\nThe Current State of Centralization\n\n26A second outcome of centralization is the continued effects on the court systems and judicial structure in Egypt. Nathan Brown explains the centralization of the court structure in his book, which he notes to have increased during the period from 1937-71 under Nasser’s governance (Brown 1997). This is not to say that there have been no changes on the court and judicial system since then but rather to highlight the dependence on a Cairo-based bureaucracy that paralyzes any attempts at decentralization.\n\n27Last, but not least, is the unimportance given to the people in general as political actors in their different roles and respective communities. The strikes by the textile and weaving workers in Helwan, part of Greater Cairo – which also includes Giza – can be cited as a key example (Beinin 2014). The strikes started much earlier than 2011 – 2008 witnessed the most increase in strikes – but were left isolated until 2011. Similarly, the voices of organizations like the Egyptian Federation of Independent Trade Unions (EFITU) remain unheard despite their continuous struggle to gain political significance and empowerment (Beinin 2014 and Regeni 2016). Further, the recent upheaval in Aswan (and surrounding Nubian villages) provides another example of a community deprived of an arena to voice their demands for keeping their land and language in the face of the new government’s reforms. This can also be said to be true for the sectarian crisis that has been taking place in Upper and Lower Egyptian governorates for decades, which sometimes manifests itself in Greater Cairo; but remains neglected by the government and judicial system.\n\nConclusion\n\n28The centralization of the Egyptian political system, actors, and state system is the main topic explored throughout this paper. The connection that exists between the political actors and the people is always put to the test when it is in key governorates and Greater Cairo. Egypt as a territory is yet to be consolidated in terms of effective governance and being encompassed by the state apparatus. Many places remain out of reach for the state, the coercive apparatus, and state bureaucracy, which further validates the centralization of most political actors and their main spheres of influence. The centralization of the army and MB is both a reason and consequence of the centralized state and political field in Egypt. The centralized governance and political-economic strategies from Nasser until Mubarak resulted in dependency on non-state actors for the fulfillment of many of the government’s tasks, ranging from health care to education.\n\n29El-Sissi’s plan for decentralization confirms that political actors identify with the problems that have developed because of increased state centralization and influence of political actors. The key conclusions here begin with the inability of the army and MB to generate involvement from the people and have representation throughout the territory. The army’s superiority to the people in its discourse and actions remains an obstacle to its involvement in the political field. The army is a state apparatus that requires centralized decision-making and makes a civilianization of the army in power a step towards decentralization.\n\n30On the other hand, the MB, as a political actor in opposition, does not gain much power or representation of the people’s interests in various contexts through its territorial dispersal. Delegation of power to local MB representatives was not part of the MB’s internal discourse or hierarchy. Still, the MB’s status today as a terrorist group and its removal from the political field, allows room for other movements and opposition groups to provide a local alternative.\n\n31The effects of the long centralization processes in Egypt led to the centralization of different aspects of the people’s everyday lives. This includes the media, infrastructure, administrative procedures, economic opportunities, judicial system, etc . Egypt’s territorial cohesion rests on the shoulders of the current hegemonic political actors and that of the opposition to include the voices of locals from Sinai to Nubia. This is possible maintaining that policies move towards the creation of state representative bodies and delegation of governance to these local state representatives."
