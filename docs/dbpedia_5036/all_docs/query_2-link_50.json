These troops (already partly familiar with foreign warfare through their previous employment as xenoi in Sicily and Greece), now increasingly employed new types of weapon, such as the oval thureos, the cut-and-thrust straight sword, and bronze Montefortino type helmets. These were used in a more sophisticated tactical framework of traditional, fourth-century vintage tactics (already based in a type of dualpurpose ‘line’ infantry with light infantry capabilities) but within the structure of a Hellenistic-type army in which those thureophoroi could be most useful in combination with other troop types. Although Hannibal’s army was not strictly\n\na Hellenistic one, we will show that the implication of Iberia, velis nolis, in the ‘World Wars’ of the late 3rd century BC and later in the Roman Civil Wars, introduced military developments of ultimately Hellenistic origin.\n\nHowever, these oval shields, bronze Montefortino helmets, and straight swords never completely displaced the traditional weaponry based on the round shield, leather helmet and curved falcata, except probably in those units serving under Carthaginian standards on a more or less permanent basis. During this period Iberians were increasingly being used (as allies, subjects or mercenaries) by the Carthaginians and later by the Romans as either line (dual-purpose) or light infantry, and as cavalry, but also fought each other, or on their own against both Carthaginians and Romans.\n\nThe use of elephants for military purposes was, for centuries, one of the most important military arms of the armies in the Antiquity.

But there was more to the Second Punic War; over the course of a war that lasted sixteen years, hundreds of thousands of men were deployed and killed, hundreds of men were appointed to positions of command and roughly fifty significant battle or military actions were fought. For a long period, Rome seemed helpless; Hannibal scored victory after victory over an apparently incompetent Roman military. But who was to blame for these defeats, and the subsequent turn around that saw Rome rise from the brink of defeat in 215BC to complete victory in 202BC? This paper will endeavour to answer that question.\n\nRESUMEN: La campaña militar que llevó a cabo Aníbal en su segundo año de mandato en tierras hispanas ha sido objeto de múltiples debates en la historiografía.

Eso a pesar de las escasas fuentes que nos hablan de la misma y lo reducido de estas.

Several reasons have been mentioned to explain this expedition, from the purely political to the economic ones. In this intervention a revision of these causes will be made in order to draw an alternative hypothesis about this expedition.\n\nKEYWORDS: Hannibal, Vaccaei, military campaigns\n\nTrough the analysis of the documentary sources, as well as of the most significant bibliography, we studied the origin and the first known events of the army of Carthage in the century VI b.

C. We studied the initial formation of Carthaginian Army, undoubtedly from an urban militia, as well as the events in Sicily and Sardinia, this was narrated mainly by Trogus Pompey-Justin, and the naval battle of Alalie, which was mentioned by Herodotus.\n\nThe final battle of the First Punic War between Rome and Carthage, the battle of the Egadi Islands, took place in 241 B.C.

Finds of multiple bronze warship rams, helmets, and amphoras, destined for a Carthaginian garrison on Sicily, confirm the naval battle's general precise location, the resulting landscape of battle debris, the dimensions of rams and warships in the 3rd c. B.C., and hypotheses for fleet construction and composition during the First Punic War. Subsequent publications will provide more detailed discussions of ram manufacture and their morphology, as well as the inscriptions present on the rams.\n\nThis work analyzes the Carthaginian military presence between the Ebro river and the Pyrenees in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula during the Second Punic War.

In first place, references to written sources and archaeological evidence are studied. Secondly, the mentions of the ancient sources concerning the disposition and structure of the Carthaginian military camps are analyzed. Finally, we present the movables related to those encampments; mainly coins, weaponry and pottery.\n\nResum Es presenten els resultats d’un projecte de recerca arqueológica que pretén identificar, a partir de la localització de les restes de materials mobles (armament, monedes...), el pas de l’exèrcit cartaginès per les terres de... more\n\nResum\n\nEs presenten els resultats d’un projecte de recerca arqueológica que pretén identificar, a partir de la localització de les restes de materials mobles (armament, monedes...), el pas de l’exèrcit cartaginès per les terres de l’interior de l’actual Catalunya, especialment a través del curs inferior del riu Ebre.* El descobriment de determinades concentracions d’aquests materials permet defensar la presència de les tropes d’Anníbal Barca en aquest territori i l’establiment de campaments de campanya púnics, probablement ocupats per mercenaris o aliats indígenes.\n\nResumen\n\nSe presentan los resultados de un proyecto de investigación arqueológica que pretende identificar, a partir de la localización de los restos de materiales muebles (armamento, monedas...), el paso del ejército cartaginés por las tierras delinterior de la actual Cataluña, especialmente a través del curso inferior del río Ebro.

The discovery of concentrations of these materials makes it possible to argue for the presence of Hannibal Barca’s troops in this area and the establishment of Punic military camps, probably occupied by mercenaries or indigenous allies.\n\nAbstract.

A methodological strategy has been developed through the integration of the data provided by classical sources and those background of archaeological research related to the environment of the oppidum of Raia di San Basile (Muro Lucano, Basilicata, Italy), place in which the historiography locates unanimously the ancient Numistro. It has been developed a sampling system designed to locate the remains of the battle based on our previous experience through the project 'Baecula', looking for a methodological comparison between the two cases of study.\n\nSince 2002, our team at the University of... more\n\nSince 2002, our team at the University of Jaén&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s Research Institute for Iberian Archaeology has been undertaking an archaeological research project focusing on the analysis of the site of a conflict that can indisputably be dated to the final phase of the Second Punic War. Based on the topography, descriptions in the ancient sources, and archaeological data, we present the hypothesis that the site we have located corresponds to that of the battle of Baecula. In that confrontation in 208 B.C., Scipio the Younger faced Hasdrubal Barca. It was a momentous battle, at least in terms of its subsequent outcome, given that it could be considered the event that triggered Hasdrubal&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s withdrawal to Italy. Our research project has yielded information which we believe to be paradigmatic in two respects. First, we have been able to ascertain the size of the area over which an armed confrontation of this type would have taken place, thanks to the identification of determining elements such as the different camps set up for the battle and their sizes. It covers the area where the armies clashed, where they were positioned and deployed, their movements on the battlefield, and so forth. Second, thanks to intensive sampling, we have recovered a corpus of finds that may be used in the future as a reference for the allocation of other sites to the period of the Second Punic War."
