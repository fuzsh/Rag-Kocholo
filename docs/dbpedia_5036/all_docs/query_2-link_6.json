PLEASE READ THIS. There's a walk-in interview drive going on where you're supposed to, by default, give a test beforehand. This is what the test looks like (For a fresher Brand Strategist)---> https://lnkd.in/dR9qfUxG | https://lnkd.in/dWjwDCst 10-11 sets of copy + 1 campaign. In my honest opinion, this is pure exploitation, or rather, a genius way to generate a content bank of ideas for free. Young hungry talent willing to do anything... Why not exploit them? What the actual f**k Schbang ? A friend of mine was applying and this came to my notice. Now i personally believe there should be tests, but this is not the way. A set of emailers, a set of ads, 1 small campaign, that's fine. But this is just horrible. I have personally given worse tests and not even gotten a callback... and i moved on happily without any payment just because i was desperate. I really hope people trying at Schbang take a thoughtful decision. Just wanted to bring this into the light. Cheers! UPDATE (5/12/23): The no. of questions have been reduced. Thanks to the quick action by Harshil Karia New Link: https://lnkd.in/dj6WJKzh\n\nMy client made over $6,000 on one product last year... with a feature I built into their website. Here's how we worked together to get that result: First, we had an in-depth discussion about the biggest issues they were having with their business website. Which were: - A lack of customization options for their products. - Possible monetary losses. - Frustrations from her customers and clients. We also talked about what she felt it could do for her business in the long run. After reviewing options and implementations, I got to work. - I added 8 different customization options (including text box) - Made Afterpay available for customer convenience. - Gave the client video tutorials for managing the product after handoff. The biggest takeaway here was having an impactful discussion about the current state of the business and where it could be. This and understanding the issue to deliver a solution that impacts their business to this very day. (Over a year and a half active) What's your biggest win with helping your customers or clients succeed? P.S. Even though the client has a new web design, the feature I implemented is still in tact! https://lnkd.in/dUfn7den\n\nI am thrilled to reveal The Three Dubs’ (3dubs) 😎 official website. I won't go on blabbering 🤐 about what we used and how we did it - there will be separate article for it 😝. So, here’s the link, go check it out- 3dubs.in However, before you go, here are few “tips” and interesting facts. 1. The website has over 4,000 to 20,000 unique variations! Yes, 4,000 to 20,000 (based on what you are counting). And all of it is hand coded, no videos or GIFs. Don't believe me? Just inspect the page! 2. Before I explain that preposterous statement, use of desktop / laptop is recommended. The site supports mobile, but most feature are accessible only through a large screen with trackpad / mouse. 3. So, the promised explanation - every time you open the site in new session (new tab), you’ll get new experience. Since every new session gets assigned unique configuration of pages and components, every session is unique to that user. 4. Ok, I’ll admit the 20,000 number does sound huge, but in reality, you’ll mostly encounter 7-12 unique configurations. The number gets that big simply because factorial in permutations and combinations increases exponentially. And that number included every minute change. 5. Also, everything you see on website was coded. Every single animation was generated using code in one way or another. No videos, I promise. 😇 6. Make sure to click on everything visible on page (other than links). You might just find something interesting. 7. Above all, have fun! I hope you find this little endeavor interesting. If you have any questions or suggestions, do reach out. I am always eager to talk! 😁 And if you are interested in the source code, I’ll clean up the code a bit more before sharing the repo link, probably along with a little article explaining some of the more “grotesque” sections 😅 . I am looking forward to your feedback. Jayvardhan Patil, DevsTomorrow. p.s. - Grateful to my fellow Dubs - Aryan singh and Kunal Sharma, for their unwavering support."
