        "text": "Results\n\nA total of 1932 patients were included accounting for 39,966 months of treatment (Supplementary Figure S1). Some patients may have received >1 type of treatment.\n\nThe relatively low median age of this cohort (49.4 years, interquartile range 39.0–57.6) reflects the preferential referral of mobile, independent patients to these modalities. Patients on naAPD were older and more often female (Supplementary Table S1). The frequency of comorbidities may vary between groups.\n\nThe median monthly cost for one patient was €6154 (interquartile range €5088–€7566) and varied from €5700 for naAPD to €7903 for dhHD ( ). Analysis by cost subcategories shows that the highest cost (56%) was due to dialysis fees (Supplementary Table S2). Hospitalization was the second leading cost (12%).\n\nTable 1\n\nMonthly\n\ncost (€)Nocturnal extended HDHD in self-care unitNonassisted APDDaily home HDMedianq1q3Medianq1q3Medianq1q3Medianq1q3Total580148597193602050556981570148726922790368948975Dialysisa302428043231293328262995324631373395573152836237Various compensatory allowance449.8114.8954.3740373.11007603.4182.21022657.92681014Hospitalization352.499.7776.2299.5107.9733.1560.5262.91137441.5186.2826.7Drugs218123.4367.5301.3173.5411228.4134.1379.9311.1168.6518Technical medical acts36.7157528.411.859.3251.8233.9283.346.615.695.7Transport810.1202.81449810466132765.120.616382.123.2192.5Laboratory135.9107.1179.6142.5116.4169.580.447.8116.67730.6121.8Imaging4726.178.945.627.365.839.520.669.449.223.885.8Equipment23.78.17728.311.168.736.713.184.63313.185.7Medical remuneration51.32615737.527.154.932.519.348.829.618.642.6Paramedical remuneration4.61.118.74.71.714.818.6681.54.61.416.7Other392.58.71401586.69.61417336.29.5134630.34.7922.1\n\nThe costs of the different subcategories varied between dialysis modalities ( ). Dialysis costs were similar for scHD, naAPD, and neHD and were about twice as high for dhHD. Expenses for transport and laboratory tests were lower for patients at home, but cost for hospitalization was higher. Expenses for drugs were lowest for neHD and naAPD patients. Technical medical acts and paramedical remuneration costs (outside dialysis session) were highest for naAPD. Medical remuneration was highest for neHD and was lower for dhHD.\n\nDuring the periods considered, the hospitalization rate was 33 per 100 months at risk, distributed as follows: 14 for hospital stays and 19 for day hospitalization. Day hospitalization was more frequent for patients with home treatment ( ).\n\nTable 2\n\nIndicatorsNocturnal extended HDDaily home HDNonassisted APDHD in self-care unitNumber of months at risk6000812222,5213323Median duration of a hospital stay (IQR), d3 (1–5)3 (1–6)3 (2–7)2 (1–5)Number of hospital stays for 100 mo at riskTotal8.08.211.29.5Nephrological or urological domain0.71.12.60.8Other3.23.44.83.4Cancer0.20.10.20.5Cardiovascular domain0.71.11.50.9Peritonitis0.00.01.20.0Vascular access0.70.50.41.0Infection0.40.50.60.5Number of day hospitalizations for 100 mo at riskTotal5.911.827.35.5Nephrological or urological domaina0.50.913.90.3Other2.62.85.52.0Nontumoral chemotherapy1.54.83.50.2Cancer0.92.42.41.4Cardiovascular domain0.20.20.20.9Peritonitis0.00.00.60.0Vascular access0.20.40.60.4Infection0.10.00.10.1Anemia0.00.20.40.3Total cost in euros for 1 mo at riskbTotal310420690363Nephrological or urological domaina396019344.5Other138177225144Nontumoral chemotherapy2120223Cancer18224530Cardiovascular domain46668676Peritonitis00700Vascular access26221632Infection23503032Anemia0222\n\nVarious compensatory allowances were paid to 49% of the patients. Those treated by naPD received disability benefits most frequently, and approximately 30% of all groups had patients receiving an allowance because of inability to work (Supplementary Table S3).\n\nDiscussion\n\nPayment for dialysis fees accounts for 56% of the amount spent, followed by hospitalizations (12%), drugs (6%), transport (4%), and direct compensatory allowances to patients (5%). The total cost is strongly influenced by the number of sessions. Transport, which increases the cost of facility-based care, is partially balanced by the payment of third-party compensatory allowances to patients on home dialysis.\n\nWithout difficult-to-implement randomized trials, it is complex if even possible to conclude that one technique or another yields superior clinical benefits. Although there are no binding recommendations, in the absence of significant comorbidities, younger patients are encouraged to use techniques that allow daytime activities or self-care techniques that can be performed either at home or in scHD.4 Many studies associate home dialysis with a better quality of life because of the flexibility it offers to patients. It can nonetheless have negative effects counterbalancing the flexibility because of the additional workload and time burden for patients and families. Other forms of dialysis that may be as suitable have not been evaluated or promoted. They may be suitable for some of the patients who make a reasoned choice not to opt for a home technique for psychological or practical reasons such as the desire not to bring the disease home, the risk of isolation, or the unsuitability of the home.\n\nIn France, over the past decade, response to the high cost of dialysis has included an incentive policy aimed at lowering the price for facility-based HD sessions and increasing the weekly flat rate of reimbursement for peritoneal dialysis as well as expanding home dialysis (Supplementary Table S4). The number of sessions determines the cost of HD; the costs of scHD and neHD are close because the session fee does not take the duration into account. The development of cyclers that allow shorter and more frequent sessions has raised the cost of home HD, which had long been called the least expensive technique, to be very close to that of facility-based HD.5,6 In another study, home nocturnal HD had a lower cost relative to conventional in-center HD.7\n\nThe cost of hospitalizations appeared higher for facility-based HD than for home techniques. Previous studies have shown similar hospitalization rates for dhHD and standard HD but divergent causes, with more infectious causes for the former and more cardiovascular causes for the latter.\n\nOnly home dialysis patients receive third-party allowances, which provide a median monthly income of €282 for PD patients and €569 for dhHD patients. Compensatory allowances for either sick or treatment leave or for disability are approximately €800 per month. They are paid to approximately 30% of the patients in group and might be considered equivalent to the loss of professional income attributable to the ESKD. It should be noted that neHD and naAPD both take place entirely at night, so that dialysis does not disrupt any daytime activities, including work. Further analyses are planned to detail the level of reintegration of patients and in particular the share of full employment in each treatment class. Job quality should also be measured in all its dimensions.8\n\nThe strength of this study is its data source: the linkage of 2 national databases. This enabled a comprehensive assessment of different cost categories and subcategories among 4 groups of patients, which were never previously compared. Nonetheless, our study has some limitations. First, it only compares payments and not real costs. This is particularly problematic for neHD, which is paid at the same level as standard day treatment of 4 hours. Second, a cost-benefit analysis would be more relevant to estimate the best strategy, that is, the one producing the best effects (quality of life, social integration) at the lowest cost. Third, we cannot exclude some errors because of indirect linkage. Finally, our study did not include indirect costs linked to the environmental impact of the different treatment strategies, including but not limited to waste disposal, energy use, and water resource depletion, which could be higher for more intensive strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, our study shows that different strategies of care can be proposed to French dialysis patients. Some underused techniques, such as nocturnal extended facility-based HD, might usefully be promoted because they do not involve any excess cost, at least in comparison to dhHD. Real cost analyses are however needed because some reimbursements are not adapted and deserve to be revised upward."
