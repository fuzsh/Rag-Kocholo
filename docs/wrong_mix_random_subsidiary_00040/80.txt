These critics are thinkin’ twice — and don’t think it’s all right that Bob Dylan is the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature.

Many in the literary world were stunned Thursday when the legendary folk artist captured the world-famous award.

“Upside: does this mean we get to have a serious conversation about Dylan as appropriator and boundaries btw that and plagiarism?” novelist Hari Kunzru griped on Twitter.

“Is any previous Nobel laureate known to have incorporated so many other people’s words, unattributed, into his work?” he continued.

Book blogger Meytal Radzinski said Dylan’s win also reflected the lack of gender balance among Nobel winners.

“Again: I don’t especially care about Bob Dylan specifically winning the Nobel. I care that zero women won in any category this year,” Radzinski tweeted.

And Big Apple scribe Gary Shteyngart deadpanned: “I totally get the Nobel committee. Reading books is hard.”

One bitter critic across the pond said the times they are a-changin’ with Dylan’s win — but not in a good way.

“I will be called a fogey, a snob, elitist etc. On this point, I don’t care! The culture is demonstrably poorer than it was a few decades ago and this has an impact upon politics,” Telegraph columnist Tim Stanley said in a piece titled “A world that gives Bob Dylan a Nobel Prize is a world that nominates Trump for president.”

“With each year, standards seem to slip and what was once considered absurd seems quite normal. And what is excellent is sadly forgotten. Where that all ends, I don’t know. Perhaps a Nobel Prize in 2025 being awarded to Donald Trump for lyrical tweeting.”

But Dylan did have some well-known folks celebrating his big win.
