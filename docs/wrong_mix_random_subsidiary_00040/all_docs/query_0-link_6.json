        "text": "1928-2014\n\nWho Was Maya Angelou?\n\nA multitalented writer and performer, Maya Angelou is best known for her work as an author and poet. Her 1969 memoir, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, made literary history as the first nonfiction bestseller by a Black woman. Some of her famous poems include “Phenomenal Woman,” “Still I Rise,” and “On the Pulse of Morning,” which she recited at President Bill Clinton’s inauguration in 1993 and which earned her a Grammy Award. Angelou also enjoyed a career as a Tony- and Emmy-nominated actor and singer in plays, musicals, and onscreen. She became the first Black woman to have a screenplay produced with the 1972 movie Georgia, Georgia. In her work as a civil rights activist, she collaborated with Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, among others. The Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient died in May 2014 at age 86.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nFULL NAME: Marguerite Ann Johnson\n\nBORN: April 4, 1928\n\nDIED: May 28, 2014\n\nBIRTHPLACE: St. Louis, Missouri\n\nSPOUSES: Tosh Angelos (c. 1949-1952), Vusumzi Make (c. 1961), and Paul Du Feu (c. 1973-1981)\n\nCHILD: Guy Johnson\n\nASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Aries\n\nEarly Life\n\nMaya Angelou was born Marguerite Ann Johnson on April 4, 1928, in St. Louis.\n\nShe had a difficult childhood. Her parents split up when she was very young, and she and her older brother, Bailey, were sent to live with their paternal grandmother, Anne Henderson, in Stamps, Arkansas. Bailey gave Marguerite the nickname “Maya,” which she would adopt as her preferred name later in life.\n\nAs an African American, Angelou experienced firsthand racial prejudices and discrimination in Arkansas. She also suffered violence at home when she was around the age of 7. During a visit with her mother, Maya was raped by her mother’s boyfriend. As vengeance for the sexual assault, her uncles killed the boyfriend.\n\nYoung Maya was so traumatized by the experience that she stopped talking. She returned to Arkansas and spent about five years as a virtual mute.\n\nA short-lived high school relationship resulted in Maya becoming pregnant. She was 16 years old whens he delivered her son, Guy Johnson, in 1944. After giving birth, she worked a number of jobs to support herself and her child.\n\nAround this time, Maya moved to San Francisco and won a scholarship to study dance and acting at the California Labor School. She also became the first Black female cable car conductor, a job she held only briefly, in San Francisco.\n\nLife as an Performer and Activist\n\nMaya Angelou was nominated for an Emmy Award for her performance in the TV miniseries Roots, based on Alex Haley’s best-selling novel.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the world began to know Maya Angelou, her professional name adapted from her first husband’s last name, when her career as an actor and singer took off. She landed a role in a touring production of Porgy and Bess, later appearing in the off-Broadway production Calypso Heat Wave (1957) and releasing her first album, Miss Calypso (1957).\n\nA member of the Harlem Writers Guild and a civil rights activist, Angelou organized and starred in the musical revue Cabaret for Freedom as a benefit for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which Martin Luther King Jr. helped found before becoming its first president. Angelou also served as the SCLC’s northern coordinator and became a close to King.\n\nIn 1961, Angelou appeared in an off-Broadway production of Jean Genet’s The Blacks with James Earl Jones, Lou Gossett Jr., and Cicely Tyson. Afterward, the performer retreated from the theater scene for much of the 1960s. She lived abroad, first in Egypt and then in Ghana, and worked as an editor and a freelance writer. Angelou also held a position at the University of Ghana for a time.\n\nIn Ghana, she also joined a community of “Revolutionist Returnees” exploring pan-Africanism and became close with activist and Black nationalist leader Malcolm X. In 1964, upon returning to the United States, Angelou helped Malcolm X set up the Organization of Afro-American Unity, which disbanded after his assassination the following year.\n\nBack in the United States, Angelou earned a Tony Award nomination for her role in the play Look Away (1973) and an Emmy Award nomination for her work on the television miniseries Roots (1977), among other honors.\n\nPoems\n\nJust Give Me a Cool Drink of Water ’fore I Diiie\n\nAngelou published several collections of poetry, but her most famous was 1971’s collection , which was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize.\n\nOther famous collections of Angelou’s poetry include:\n\n(1975), which includes Angelou’s poem “Alone,”\n\n(1978), which features the beloved poem “Phenomenal Woman,”\n\n(1983),\n\n(1990), featuring the poem “Human Family,” and\n\n(1997).\n\nApple famously used a video of Angelou reading her poem “Human Family” in an advertisement at the 2016 Olympics.\n\n“On the Pulse of Morning”\n\nMaya Angelou reads “On the Pulse of Morning” at the 1993 inauguration ceremony for President Bill Clinton.\n\nOne of her most famous works, Angelou wrote the poem “On the Pulse of Morning” for President Bill Clinton’s inaugural ceremony in January 1993. Her recitation at the ceremony marked the first inaugural poem reading since 1961, when Robert Frost delivered “The Gift Outright” at John F. Kennedy’s inauguration. Angelou went on to win a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for the audio version of “On the Pulse of Morning.”\n\nOther well-known poems by Angelou include “His Day Is Done,” a 1962 tribute poem Angelou wrote for Nelson Mandela as he made his secret journey from Africa to London, and “Amazing Peace,” which she wrote in 2005 for the White House tree-lighting ceremony.\n\nBooks\n\nIn addition to her books of poetry, Angelou also wrote several memoirs and even cookbooks. She won two NAACP Image Awards in the Outstanding Literary Work (Nonfiction) category for her 2005 cookbook and 2008’s Letter to My Daughter.\n\nI Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\n\nAngelou’s friend and fellow writer James Baldwin urged her to write about her life experiences. The resulting work was the enormously successful 1969 memoir about her childhood and young adult years, .\n\nThe poignant story made literary history as the first nonfiction bestseller by a Black woman. The book, which made Angelou an international star, continues to be regarded as her most popular autobiographical work.\n\nIn 1995, Angelou was lauded for remaining on The New York Times’ paperback nonfiction bestseller list for two years, the longest-running record in the chart’s history at the time.\n\nGather Together in My Name\n\nAngelou’s follow-up to I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, this 1974 memoir covers her life as an unemployed teenage mother in California, when she turned to narcotics and prostitution.\n\nSingin’ and Swingin’ and Gettin’ Merry Like Christmas\n\nAngelou wrote this autobiography, published in 1976, about her early career as a singer and actor.\n\nThe Heart of a Woman\n\nAngelou crafted this 1981 memoir about leaving California with her son for New York, where she took part in the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nAll God’s Children Need Traveling Shoes\n\nA lyrical exploration about what it means to be an African American in Africa, this autobiographical book was published in 1986 and covers the years Angelou spent living in Ghana.\n\nWouldn’t Take Nothing for My Journey Now\n\nThis inspirational essay collection from 1994 features Angelou’s insights about spirituality and living well.\n\nA Song Flung Up to Heaven\n\nAnother autobiographical work, A Song Flung Up to Heaven (2002) explores Angelou’s return from Africa to the United States and her ensuing struggle to cope with the devastating assassinations of two human rights leaders with whom she worked: Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nKing was killed on Angelou’s 40th birthday, leading the author to stop celebrating her birthday for years afterward. She also sent flowers to King’s widow, Coretta Scott King, for more than 30 years, until Coretta’s death in 2006.\n\nA Song Flung Up to Heaven ends as Angelou begins work on I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.\n\nLetter to My Daughter\n\nDedicated to a daughter Angelou never had, this 2008 book of essays features Angelou’s advice for young women about living a life of meaning.\n\nMom & Me & Mom\n\nIn this 2013 memoir, Angelou discusses her complicated relationship with her mother who abandoned her during childhood.\n\nCookbooks\n\nInterested in health, Angelou’s published cookbooks include Hallelujah! The Welcome Table: A Lifetime of Memories With Recipes (2005) and Great Food, All Day Long (2010).\n\nMovie Career\n\nAfter publishing I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Angelou broke new ground artistically, educationally, and socially by writing the movie Georgia, Georgia (1972). The drama made her the first African American woman to have a screenplay produced.\n\nIn 1998, seeking new creative challenges, Angelou made her directorial debut with Down in the Delta, starring Alfre Woodard. Her work on the film was recognized with the Chicago International Film Festival’s 1998 Audience Choice Award and a nod from the Acapulco Black Film Festival in 1999.\n\nBeginning in 1982, Angelou also returned to teaching at Wake Forest University in North Carolina. Over the years, she led a number of humanities courses, including “Race, Politics and Literature,” “African Culture and Impact on U.S.,” and “Race in the Southern Experience.” In 2011, Barack Obama awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nSon and Husbands\n\nMaya Angelou speaks with her son, Guy Johnson, in 2005.\n\nIn 1944, Angelou gave birth to her son, Clyde Johnson, when she was 16 years old. Johnson followed in his mother’s footsteps to eventually become a poet known as Guy Johnson. He died in February 2022.\n\nAngelou was often tight-lipped about her personal life, and details of her marriages and relationships have been inconsistent—even based on her own accounts. She is believed to have been married at least three times.\n\nAccording to the National Women’s History Museum, Angelou wed Tosh Angelos, an electrician in the U.S. Navy, in 1949. She adopted a version of his surname and kept it through the rest of her life, despite the couple’s divorce in 1952.\n\nIn late 1960, Angelou met Vusumzi Make, a South African freedom fighter. The couple married in 1961, according to Stanford University’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute. They moved to Cairo with her son in 1962, but the marriage dissolved soon after.\n\nThen in 1973, Angelou married carpenter Paul du Feu and lived with him in Berkeley, California, until their divorce in 1981.\n\nDeath\n\nAfter experiencing health issues for a number of years, Angelou died on May 28, 2014, at her home in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. She was 86 years old. A specific cause of death wasn’t given, but Angelou’s literary agent, Helen Brann, said that she had been “frail” and suffering from heart problems.\n\nThe news of her passing spread quickly with many people taking to social media to mourn and remember Angelou.

Blige and politician Cory Booker were among those who tweeted their favorite quotes by her in tribute.\n\nThen-President Barack Obama also issued a statement about Angelou, calling her “a brilliant writer, a fierce friend, and a truly phenomenal woman.” Angelou “had the ability to remind us that we are all God’s children; that we all have something to offer,” he wrote.\n\nA memorial service for Angelou was held on June 7, 2014, at Wake Forest University, where she taught for about three decades. Among the attendees were her close friend Oprah Winfrey, former President Bill Clinton, then-First Lady Michelle Obama, and actor Cicely Tyson. BeBe Winans and Lee Ann Womack gave musical performances.\n\nLegacy: Maya Angelou Quarter and More\n\nIn November 2020, the San Francisco Arts Commission unanimously approved the recommendation for a sculpture honoring Angelou “in recognition of her many accomplishments, including breaking the color and gender barriers by becoming San Francisco’s first African-American female streetcar conductor, an award-winning author and poet, a Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient and a civil rights leader.”\n\nThe monument is in development by artist Lava Thomas and scheduled to be installed in fall 2024 outside the main branch of the San Francisco Library. The design is a book featuring Angelou’s likeness on one side and the title of her famous poem “Still I Rise” at the base.\n\nAn image of the Maya Angelou quarter, which was first distributed in 2022 as part of the American Women Quarters Program\n\nMeanwhile, Angelou has become one of the historical figures featured on U.S. money. It was announced in May 2021 that she would be one of the first women commemorated with a new series of quarters from the U.S. Mint. The first shipments of the coin were made in January 2022.\n\nThe obverse, or heads, side of the coin depicts former President George Washington, with the reverse side showing Angelou with her arms uplifted. The bird in flight and rising sun behind her likeness are images inspired by her poetry and symbolic of the way she lived, according to the U.S. Mint.\n\nThe American Women Quarters Program has honored nine other women from 2022 through 2023, including astronaut Sally Ride, former Cherokee Nation chief Wilma Mankiller, former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and aviator Bessie Coleman. It is scheduled to continue through 2025.\n\nQuotes\n\nCourage is the most important of all virtues, because without courage, you cannot practice any of the other virtues consistently.\n\nI have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver.\n\nThe caged bird sings with a fearful trill / of things unknown but longed for still / and his tune is heard on the distant hill / for the caged birds sings of freedom.\n\nIf you don’t like something, change it. If you can’t change it, change your attitude.\n\nWe may encounter many defeats, but we must not be defeated.\n\nI’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.\n\nWords mean more than what is set down on paper. It takes the human voice to infuse them with deeper meaning.\n\nHow important it is for us to recognize and celebrate our heroes and she-roes!\n\nTo grow up is to stop putting blame on parents.\n\nWe are only as blind as we want to be.\n\nThe intensity with which young people live demands that they “black out” as often as possible.\n\nHome is a refuge, not only from my worries, my terrible concerns. I like beautiful things around me. I like to be beautiful because it delights my eyes and my soul is lifted up.\n\nYou may not control the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.\n\nWhen people show you who they are, believe them the first time.\n\nLet gratitude be the pillow upon which you kneel to say your nightly prayer. And let faith be the bridge you build to overcome evil and welcome good.\n\nIf you get, give. If you learn, teach.\n\nIn the flush of love’s light, we dare to be brave, and suddenly we see that love costs all we are and will ever be. Yet, it is only love which sets us free.\n\nI believe that each of us comes from the creator trailing wisps of glory."
