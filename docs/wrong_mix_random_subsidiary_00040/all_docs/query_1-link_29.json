        "text": "Love the content in general. However the app is problematic: recurrent problem over several iOS and different iPhones, I have to delete the app every month for my account to recognize my subscription. âRestore subscriptionâ never works. Otherwise love the content and will keep the subscription despite the monthly hassle!\n\nUpdate:\n\nLooks like above issue was fixed. Also, the app stays at the exact page where I left it when I come back to the app after closing it (used to take me to the home page). 5 stars!\n\nThanks\n\nIt is very difficult to manage or synch up ones subscriptions with this app. Throughout the year I am inundated with offers for new subscriptions from Scientific American, The main magazine, Physics, Mind, combination bundles, etc... Managing the that is a nightmare. If I want to add I need to go to the website and it is not reflected in the app. If I had an earlier subscription to one mag it does not reflect in the app and I cant get to it without a laborious process of linking accounts. Is there anyone I can talk too?? Forget get it! Send off an email and get a response next day... the start over again. When I am able to get things working within two months something breaks and the app refuses to download,, again!! The app looks good and when it works it is great.. but the only thing it is really good at is trying to charge me full price for each issue of a magazine. You are more trouble than you are worth. I am letting my subscriptions lapse. If I can see your magazine through some bundling service like Apple, that will be the way it goes... At least their service doesnât break every two months and is designed to be easy to manage!!\n\nPS. I cant even post this without giving the app a stupid nickname!!!\n\nBelow is a review I wrote about 2 years ago. I still have problems with the app not retaining my subscription information.\n\n-â\n\nSeems like both the website and the iPad app have had problems for a couple of years that have not been addressed. I got an e-mail verifying my renewal today that contained a link to my subscription. Using that link, I got a page that said, \"We have moved,\" and gave another link to get to the magazine. Since SciAm just sent me that link, why haven't they updated it to take me to the address that they've move to? Additionally, on the iPad app, I have to re-registered my subscription if I have accessed it for a few weeks. After I do that, I have access to the digital issues, but I don't understand why I have to keep re-registering. This annoying problem has been true for previous versions of the iPad app. Despite these problems, I think the SciAm content is great and it has kept me as a long-term subscriber."
