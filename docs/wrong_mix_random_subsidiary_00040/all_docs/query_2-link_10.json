        "text": "I'm all about actually purposeful buys, at truly solid discounts.\n\nI hate spending money. This may seem strange, since I work on as shopping writer, but it makes sense to me: I like finding cost-effective products that will actually make a difference in my and readers’ lives, distinct from shopping just to shop.\n\nBecause I dread parting with my money (I have a savings account to build!), I plan to utilize Prime Day to snag items I’ve been wanting for a while, for less — and to stock up on items I regularly use, for cheaper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy criteria? Items that I’ll actually get a lot of use out of, and which are actually a solid deal.\n\nI must admit, I had a lot of fun hunting around. Here are the picks I’m looking at for Prime Day, below.\n\nHuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page.
