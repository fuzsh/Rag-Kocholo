        "text": "Apple Strikes Deal With Taboola to Sell Ads for Apple News\n\nSara Fischer, reporting this week for Axios:\n\nAd tech giant Taboola has struck a deal with Apple to power native advertising within the Apple News and Apple Stocks apps, Taboola founder and CEO Adam Singolda told Axios. The deal provides new validation for Taboola’s business, which has ballooned to over $1.4 billion in annual revenue as of 2023. [...]\n\nAs an authorized advertising reseller for Apple News and Apple Stocks, Taboola will power native advertising placements within those two apps in every market available. [...]\n\nMost people know Taboola as the company responsible for placing chumbox ads at the bottom of many news stories online.\n\nEric Seufert, on Threads:\n\nRegarding Taboola’s partnership with Apple: I’ve seen people claim that this is somehow hypocritical from a privacy perspective, assuming that Taboola’s somewhat obnoxious, clickbait-style ads must invasively target user profiles and browsing histories.\n\nThey don’t. They are targeted entirely contextually. That’s the point.\n\nWant brash, garish advertising plastered all over the web? Reject ads personalization. Want relevant, informed advertising? Embrace ads personalization.\n\nIf you told me that the ads in Apple News have been sold by Taboola for the last few years, I’d have said, “Oh, that makes sense.” Because the ads in Apple News — at least the ones I see1 — already look like chumbox Taboola ads. Even worse, they’re incredibly repetitious.\n\nHere’s an example. Today a friend sent me a link to an article at Rolling Stone. The article was behind a paywall on their website, so I used the Share sheet to open the article in Apple News. (Rolling Stone is one of many publications included with a News+ subscription, which I get through the Apple One bundle. This is pretty much the only reason I use Apple News — for reading stories that are paywalled on the web.) I made screen recordings showing me scrolling through the entire article, twice. I got different ads each time, but on both page loads there was at least one ad shown four times, and at least one other ad shown twice. That’s a lot of ads, and a lot of repetition.\n\nAnd, by sheer coincidence, on the web Rolling Stone is a Taboola partner. Here’s a screenshot of the box of “suggested stories” chum that Taboola offered. It’s pretty much exactly the sort of stuff I see in the ads on Apple News.\n\nSo while I don’t think it’s good news that Apple is partnering with Taboola, I don’t expect it to make any discernible difference in the ad quality or frequency. Maybe it will improve the variety? ★\n\nThe AT&T Data Breach Shows Why RCS Can’t Be Trusted and the Downside of Apple Adding Support for It in iOS 18\n\nHere’s a hot take: last week’s news of a massive AT&T breach revealing the phone call and text messaging records of all AT&T customers for six months in 2022 exemplifies why RCS is a terrible protocol that ought not exist, and why it’s a mistake that Apple is adding support for it to iOS 18 this year.\n\nThe pro-RCS argument is that it improves upon SMS by adding support for much larger image and video attachments, as well as niceties like typing indicators. It really is just like SMS but better, which makes it seem, on the surface, like a no-brainer that all cell phone platforms should support it. In this view, the only reason for Apple’s yearslong refusal to support RCS was to maintain a maximum feature gap between iMessage (which, famously, is exclusive to Apple’s devices) and carrier-based messaging. In day-to-day use people can’t see that iMessage is fully end-to-end encrypted, but everyone can plainly see that images and videos sent over SMS/MMS look like shit. So it looks like nothing but pure spite that Apple refused, for years, to support RCS.\n\nBut the argument against RCS is strong and simple: it doesn’t support end-to-end encryption. The only new messaging platforms that should gain any traction are those that not only support E2EE, but that require it. Messaging and audio/video calls should only work through E2EE. That’s true for iMessage and FaceTime.\n\nSMS and traditional telephone voice calls lack any encryption at all, but they’re firmly established. Just like email. But anything new should only be supported if it’s fundamentally based on E2EE. The RCS spec offers no message encryption at all. Google has implemented its own encryption for RCS, but, that’s a proprietary implementation that only works for messages sent between users who are all using Google’s own Messages app. From Google’s “Messages End-to-End Encryption Overview”:\n\nIn order to store and exchange user public keys like identity keys and prekeys, we need to have a central key server. Unlike the RCS messaging servers, the key server is currently only hosted by Google.\n\nPerhaps, someday, the RCS spec will support an open standard for E2EE. I’m not holding my breath for that. For one thing, industry consortiums tend not to produce good solutions to hard problems, and an open standard for E2EE messaging is a very hard problem. Maybe impossible. Someone has to handle key exchange and management, but who would that be in an open standard? Then there’s the politics: law enforcement agencies the world over will pressure carriers against that. As I reported back in February, the primary reason Apple changed course on supporting RCS is that it’s mandated in China. The Chinese government surely loves RCS because it isn’t encrypted.\n\nThat’s not unique to China or other authoritarian dictatorships. Even in the West, law enforcement and spy agencies love the fact that telephone voice calls and cellular text messages are unencrypted. We don’t know how much they record and keep, but it’s a known fact that the NSA has black boxes installed at the carriers’ call centers, and the safest bet is that they record and store all of it. But even if you trust law enforcement agencies to handle this sensitive data securely, it’s clear, from this latest data breach alone, that the carriers themselves cannot be trusted. They’re inept. They always have been inept. And my money says they always will be.\n\nBut even if, somehow, a future version of the RCS spec supports E2EE, what about older devices that only support today’s non-encrypted version of RCS? Even if RCS eventually supports E2EE — which, again, I doubt — such support will surely be optional, not mandatory, because RCS has already shipped and is in widespread use on Android without encryption. That’s why messaging platforms should be built around E2EE from the start. It’s difficult to mandate E2EE on a platform that already supports unencrypted messaging. RCS should have been exclusively E2EE; instead, the standard offers no encryption at all.\n\nCarrier-based messaging was best left as a legacy protocol. SMS wasn’t dying, but it was slowly fading away, and should have been left for things like automated “your table is ready” notifications from restaurants. RCS is just going to give carrier-based messaging new legs that it shouldn’t have gotten.\n\nAnother thing that sucks about carrier-based messaging is that it requires a device with an active SIM card from a carrier. Yes, you can send and receive SMS from a Mac or iPad with Text Message Forwarding, but you need the iPhone to do the forwarding. If you power down (or worse, lose) your iPhone, your Mac and iPad will no longer be able to send or receive SMS messages — and I presume that will be true for RCS as well. Whereas with modern messaging platforms like iMessage, Signal, and WhatsApp, devices like PCs and tablets can serve as clients without a phone.1\n\nThere is, admittedly, a good argument in favor of RCS. Basically, that phone carrier messaging is now and always will be a universally accessible form of communication. Effectively, everyone who is online has a cell phone, and those phones can all send and receive SMS. Because carrier-based messaging isn’t going away, this argument goes, it ought to be made as good as possible, and RCS — despite its deficiencies — is clearly better than SMS. Therefore RCS ought to be supported by all mobile devices, including iOS. Here’s Andy Ihnatko, in a discussion with me on Threads back in November:\n\nCarrier-based messaging on a pre-installed messaging app might seem irrelevant to many of us. But it serves and suffices. And the process of discovery, selection, and installation of a different service — and getting your entire social circle on board with it — is deathly for so many people.\n\n“If I know their phone number, I can send them a message or a photo” is a world-beater of a feature for the average user. This is why such apps should be as muscular as feasibly possible.\n\nIhnatko is right, but only if you believe that carrier-based messaging should remain the baseline. I do not. And it’s also a U.S.-centric viewpoint. In most countries around the world, platforms like WhatsApp, Line, and Facebook Messenger serve that role, as the baseline “everyone has it” messaging platform — and those countries are better for it. I prefer iMessage, personally, for multiple reasons, but iMessage is fundamentally limited from serving that “everyone has it” baseline role by Apple’s decision not to ship an Android client. Eddy Cue doesn’t lose many arguments but he lost that one. All of the effort spent pushing Apple to support RCS would have been better spent pushing Apple to ship iMessage for Android. And without a supported iMessage client for Android, that role ought to go to WhatsApp, not RCS. WhatsApp is free, secure, and works equally well on all phones.\n\nMeta knows this, and clearly smells the opportunity. Does Apple? ★\n\nIt’s the Guns, It’s the Guns, It’s the Guns\n\nJosh Marshall, writing at Talking Points Memo:\n\nPolitical violence and especially electoral violence strike at the heart of the open, free and democratic choice-making upon which our civic democratic system and the legitimacy of its choices are based. We must condemn it in every instance as well as expressing our personal sympathy for its victims. We do so not to box check some vague concept of civility or comity but because it strikes at the taproot of civil peace. It is equally not a license to squelch political speech or in this case threaten or intimidate those calling attention to the real and profound dangers of Donald Trump returning to the White House. We are already seeing this attempt in the making.\n\nPolitical violence is abhorrent, and as Marshall aptly notes, strikes at the heart of the very concept of democracy. Words cannot express strongly enough the feelings that an event like yesterday’s evokes, no matter which side of the political spectrum we’re on. We call many things “unacceptable” but an assassination attempt is more than that. It’s sick, and, correctly, makes us feel sick. It’s like how our bodies revolt when we consume poison. An assassination attempt is poison to the body politic.\n\nBut only one of the candidates in this election has ever incited political violence. That candidate is Donald Trump, particularly and especially on January 6, 2021. Only one candidate has ever mocked and cracked jokes about a near-miss assassination attempt against one of his political adversaries. That candidate is Donald Trump, who (along with his son) has repeatedly mocked Nancy Pelosi’s husband Paul after an unhinged lunatic, asking “Where is Nancy?”, broke into their home and bashed Paul Pelosi’s head with a hammer, fracturing his skull to an extent that required surgery.\n\nDonald Trump wasn’t an inch away from assassination because of Democratic rhetoric against his threat to democracy. He is a threat to democracy. He threatened democracy on national television. He has repeated, literally hundreds of times over the last three and a half years, that the fairest election this nation has ever held was “rigged” because he lost. Ask him today and he’ll say the same. Give Trump credit: he fully admits that the only election results he will accept are results that declare him the winner. But that, quite literally, is a threat to our democracy. He tried to remain in office after losing, by almost the exact same Electoral College margin he declared “a massive landslide victory” when he won in 2016, by overthrowing the duly elected government of the United States. Ask him today if he should still be in the White House.\n\nDo not accept, not even at this fraught moment, the claims of anyone blaming yesterday on Democrats describing Trump as a threat to democracy. Saying so is not even on the spectrum of hyperbole. We saw what we saw after the 2020 election, and especially on January 6.\n\nDo not fret, either, that yesterday’s event somehow cedes the election to Trump, on the grounds that he survived and projected strength. The side that wants a strongman was already voting for him. They’re the same people who claimed, wrongly, that being convicted of 34 felonies somehow helped him electorally. This is, no question, an indelible image and a photo for the ages. But Teddy Roosevelt was shot campaigning in 1912 — and unlike Trump took the stage to deliver his speech after taking the bullet — and lost the election by 347 Electoral College votes (an actual landslide) to Woodrow Wilson. Running for president for the third time in 1972, virulently racist Alabama governor George Wallace was shot, leaving him paralyzed. Wallace lost the primary. Gerald Ford survived not just one but two shooting attempts within 17 days in 1975. Ford wore a bulletproof trench coat in public for the remainder of his term. He lost the 1976 election to Jimmy Carter. (It was quite close.)\n\nThe truth is that our nation, great though it is in so many ways, has a horrific history of political violence and a seemingly innate obsession with firearms. Four presidents have been assassinated in office — Lincoln in 1865, Garfield in 1881, McKinley in 1901, and Kennedy in 1963 — all by gunshots. Three more — Roosevelt, Reagan (who nearly died), and now Trump — have been wounded by gunshots. And there have been numerous other failed attempts, including a nut who fired shots into the White House during Barack Obama’s first term in 2011.\n\nAlso, yesterday’s events will be old news by election day. There are 113 days until November 5. It’s been 129 days since Joe Biden’s strong State of the Union speech. Does that State of the Union feel recent to you today? That’s how old yesterday’s shooting will feel when we vote.\n\nSo here is what the Democrats should do. Tomorrow morning Chuck Schumer should put on the floor of the Senate a law mandating strict background checks for all gun purchases. Perhaps tie it to a reinstitution of the 1994 assault weapons ban that Republicans allowed to expire in 2004. Give it a name like the “Anti Political and School Violence Act”. Make Republicans shoot it down. Make them say, as Trump himself did after a school shooting massacre in Iowa this year, that we “have to get over it, we have to move forward.” It’s not just an outrage when your right-wing authoritarian hero gets his ear nicked by an assassin’s bullet. It’s an outrage when anyone is shot by a nut with a gun.\n\nMake them say it. See how that flies. ★"
