Had he been a theorist, he most certainly would have rejected the Newtonian concept of the economy as a machine tending always toward equilibrium between supply and demand. Jobs did not strive to discover or conform to universal laws of economics. He understood that economics is not a natural science of scarcity founded on unconscious mechanisms but rather a conscious human science of unlimited creative potential based on human choice. He did not commodify products to meet available demand or attempt to set prices at the equilibrium point. He invented new products to create new types of demand that never existed before and frequently sold them for prices far higher than experts predicted the market would bear. First to market a keyboard, microprocessor, display and operating system as an integrated personal computer ready to use out of the box, Apple's early models became the best-selling computers in America until behemoth IBM entered the fray with their MS-Dos based PC. Refusing to be brushed aside by his giant nemesis, Jobs then launched the user-friendly Macintosh as the first commercially successful PC with a graphic user interface, mouse, scalable fonts and networking - which became and continues to be the global industry standard.\n\nJobs' single most striking personal endowment was intense, focused, overflowing human energy. Like other great entrepreneurs and high achievers in other fields, he exuded intense energy. He recruited bright, talented high energy people. He built a high energy company where people were motivated by a missionary zeal. Creative human energy rather than money or technology was the real fuel for his accomplishments. In whatever Jobs did, he focused and directed that energy with laser-like precision into a force to reckon with. Organization is the means for channeling human energy into productive work. But too often, the corporations of his time had become top heavy, bureaucratic and unresponsive to opportunity. Jobs helped fashion the prototype of a new kind of organization which gave unprecedented freedom for individual initiative and creativity. Apple was among the first to institute informal dress codes, flexible working hours and a flat organization where the best and brightest could rise quickly. The intensity of Apple and its young leader attracted top talent. It also attracted a younger generation of customers inspired by the individualistic values of the 1960s. To own an Apple product became a symbol of human supremacy over the machine.\n\nJobs' view of the marketplace was as unconventional as his view of capital. As he believed in the unlimited capacity for enhancing the productivity of resources, he also believed in the unlimited capacity for market expansion. He perceived the market as an ascending hierarchy of human aspirations and expectations which are perpetually rising. He understood that basic material needs may be limited, but human needs also encompass social and psychological dimensions which are inherently unlimited. He recognized the importance of a product's physical and technical specifications, but gave equal or greater value to its social and psychological attributes. He was a visionary and revolutionary at heart inspired to change the world for the better rather than merely satisfy its minimum needs. His mission was to convert impersonal machines that threatened to subordinate or replace human labor and dehumanize people into user friendly personal tools to empower the individual and liberate people from the specter of mechanization. His strategy was not to fill market needs but energize markets so that they continuously expand. He emphasized the subtle aura surrounding his products and took great efforts to \"impute\" value by the way products were packaged, presented and marketed. Apple's Superbowl ad of 1984 announcing the launch of the Macintosh was heralded as the greatest commercial of all time.\n\nJobs conceived and developed a seamlessly integrated delivery system for digital music consisting of the iMac computing platform, the iPod portable player and the iTunes online store. In order to make the player as small and simple as possible, he shifted most functions to the computer, which served as the link to the iTunes store. At a time when Apple was an insignificant player in the American computer industry, Jobs succeeded in persuading major music publishers to allow Apple to sell individual songs for 99 cents each, giving it a virtual monopoly over legal online music sales. Apple literally stole the market from Sony, which had the huge competitive advantage of being both a much larger consumer electronics company and a major music publisher. Bill Gates later expressed his utter astonishment at Jobs' accomplishment, acknowledged Microsoft's error, and was determined to recoup lost ground by launching his own system. Neither Sony nor Microsoft could successfully compete with the simple, elegant Apple interface and finally gave up trying. Their failure appears quite astonishing in view of their much larger technological and financial resources. Apple's success is explained by the fact that unlike its competitors, its strategy reflected a perfect balance between technological sophistication, engineering excellence, ease of use, quality of consumer experience and access to market. In 2012 Apple sold its 25 billionth song.\n\nHe was born the illegitimate child of a Lebanese man and an American woman who put their child up for adoption at birth, because their parents would not permit their marriage. Steve grew up in a working class American family. His adopted father was a high school drop-out who developed into a skilled mechanic with a pride in craftsmanship. Steve was denied the benefits of education, money and social connections. Nor was he endowed with any obvious social abilities. The sense of having been rejected by his biological parents may account for Steve's apparent indifference to what others thought of him. He seemed free from the normal social conditioning that inhibits unconventional thought and action. He never hesitated to disagree with his peers, aggressively confront people in positions of authority, or dare to attempt what others thought impossible. As a youth he called up the president of Hewlett Packard to ask for free spare parts for an experimental product. He countermanded the advice of the Apple board and spent his own money funding the original Mac Superbowl ad. He challenged the CEO of Corning Glass to make an unbreakable surface for the first touch screen iPod, after being told that what he asked for was technically impossible, thereby successfully ushering in a whole new generation of touch screen consumer electronic products.\n\nMany who conceded Steve's lack of technical expertise regard him instead as a marketing genius. Steve's flair for dramatic product launches and his success is attracting free media coverage are legendary. But he certainly was not known as a marketer in the traditional sense. He placed no faith in market research or consumer feedback. Of far greater significance was his ability to perceive opportunity where others saw nothing at all. He had the remarkable capacity to sense what would please consumers.\n\nSecond is the postulate that social behavior, like physical phenomenon, can be explained by mechanical principles that ignore the central significance of conscious awareness and human choice. Jobs' work provides incontestable evidence of the central role of human aspirations, perceptions, beliefs, values, attitudes and choice in economic development. The future of Pixar could never have been predicted by examining its financial statements or market research reports in 1988. It resided in the imagination of a Pixar employee named John Lassiter who conceived of a short film called Tin Toy and in the faith of the entrepreneur who risked his money on a long shot because he believed in the value in Lassiter's creative inspiration.\n\n“In the early days of its development, economics was concerned with the problem of scarcity, earning it the title of the dismal science. Today, there is no longer any necessity for scarcity.”\n\nIt is ironic that the principles by which Steve Jobs created so much wealth designing and selling computers should be so resistant to analysis by econometric computer modeling. But this deficiency - if it is a deficiency - is more than compensated by the fact that a study of Jobs' work brings into sharp relief fundamental premises of real world economics that are normally obscured or abolished by abstract theory and mathematical models.\n\nThis analysis certainly does not purport to provide a full picture of the science of economy, let alone society, but rather to highlight some of the most blatant deficiencies in current conception. Steve was a pragmatist, not a theorist. His concern was the operation of the private sector economy, not management of the economy as a whole. Study of his actions provides little insight into the catalytic role of money in society, the essential contribution of financial markets to the real economy, the insidious impact of speculation, the necessity of government regulation to maintain open markets, the rightful function of central banks and deficit spending, the responsibility of government for promoting full employment, equitable distribution, the welfare of all citizens and protecting the rights of future generations by a judicious and sustainable use of ecological resources. But it does provide essential insights into the vital core of economic theory.\n\nWhat then is the essence of Jobs' theory of economy? Economy is a human science concerned with the study of how conscious human beings and social groups apply and direct their energy, knowledge, skills and organizational capabilities to generate wealth, promote human welfare and enhance the well-being of all. In the early days of its development, economics was concerned with the problem of scarcity, earning it the title of the dismal science. Today there is no longer any necessity for scarcity. Society possesses all the necessary knowledge, technology, organizational capabilities and financial resources to eradicate poverty and economic insecurity in a flash. Today there is urgent need for a theoretical formulation that ensures to all economic security, welfare and an equitable share in the earth's and humanity's collective resources. A study of Steve Jobs' contribution to economy confirms our collective capacity to achieve these goals now.\n\nAuthor Contact Information\n\nEmail: garryj29@gmail.com\n\n* Based on a presentation at the World Academy's session on 'Individuality and Human Capital' at the 14th International Conference on Sustainable Development & Eco-innovation, Krakow, Poland on Sept. 6, 2012."
