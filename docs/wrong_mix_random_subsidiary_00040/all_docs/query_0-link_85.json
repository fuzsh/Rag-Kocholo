Patients who have already started hydroxychloroquine but who have not yet finished their course in the trial may complete their course or stop at the discretion of the supervising physician.\n\nThis decision applies only to the conduct of the Solidarity trial and does not apply to the use or evaluation of hydroxychloroquine in pre or post-exposure prophylaxis in patients exposed to COVID-19.\n\nKey materials:\n\nWHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 17 June 2020\n\nSolidarity trial webpage\n\nAfrica records over 200 000 COVID-19 cases\n\n11 June 2020\n\nThe pandemic is accelerating in Africa – it took 98 days to reach 100 000 cases and only 18 days to move to 200 000 cases.\n\nTen out of 54 countries are currently driving the rise in numbers, accounting for nearly 80% of all the cases. More than 70% of the deaths are taking place in only five countries: Algeria, Egypt, Nigeria, South Africa and Sudan.\n\nWHO and other partners have supported governments with scaling up health workforce and laboratory capacities and to set up points-of-entry screening at airports and border crossings. These public health and social measures have been effective in slowing the spread of COVID-19 in Africa.\n\nKey materials:\n\nNews release\n\nHydroxychloroquine arm of Solidarity Trial resumes\n\n3 June 2020\n\nHaving met on 23 May 2020, the Executive Group of the Solidarity Trial decided to implement a temporary pause of the hydroxychloroquine arm of the trial, because of concerns raised about the safety of the drug. This decision was taken as a precaution while the safety data were reviewed by the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee of the Solidarity Trial.\n\nOn 3 June 2020, on the basis of the available mortality data, the members of the committee have recommended that there are no reasons to modify the trial protocol.\n\nThe Executive Group received this recommendation and endorsed the continuation of all arms of the Solidarity Trial, including hydroxychloroquine.\n\nThe Data Safety and Monitoring Committee will continue to closely monitor the safety of all therapeutics being tested in the Solidarity Trial.\n\nKey materials\n\nWHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 3 June 2020\n\nSolidarity Trial webpage\n\n155-country survey shows severe disruption to services for noncommunicable diseases\n\n1 June 2020\n\nWHO has released a May 2020 survey, which charts the impact of COVID-19 on prevention and treatment services for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), since the pandemic began.\n\nMore than half (53%) of the countries surveyed have partially or completely disrupted services for hypertension treatment; 49% for treatment for diabetes and diabetes-related complications; 42% for cancer treatment, and 31% for cardiovascular emergencies.\n\nRehabilitation services have been disrupted in almost two-thirds (63%) of countries, even though rehabilitation is key to a healthy recovery following severe illness from COVID-19.\n\nIn the majority (94%) of countries responding, ministry of health staff working in the area of NCDs were partially or fully reassigned to support COVID-19.\n\nAmong the countries reporting service disruptions, globally 58% of countries are now using telemedicine (advice by telephone or online means) to replace in-person consultations; in low-income countries this figure is 42%.\n\nKey materials:\n\nNews release\n\nRapid assessment of service delivery for NCDs during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nWHO and Costa Rica launch landmark COVID-19 Technology Access Pool\n\n29 May 2020\n\nOver thirty countries and multiple international partners and institutions have signed up to support the COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP) an initiative aimed at making vaccines, tests, treatments and other health technologies to fight COVID-19 accessible to all.\n\nC-TAP will be voluntary and based on social solidarity. It will provide a one-stop shop for scientific knowledge, data and intellectual property to be shared equitably by the global community.\n\nWHO, Costa Rica and all the co-sponsor countries have also issued a “Solidarity Call to Action” asking relevant stakeholders to join and support the initiative, with recommended actions for key groups, such as governments, research and development funders, researchers, industry and civil society.\n\nThe Director-General and Costa Rica's President also co-authored an op-ed calling for a collective and collaborative response to the coronavirus.\n\nKey materials:\n\nNews release\n\nSolidarity Call to Action\n\nCOVID-19 technology access pool\n\nOp-ed: Globalizing the Fight Against the Pandemic\n\nUpdate on hydroxychloroquine and the Solidarity Trial\n\n27 May 2020\n\nThe Executive Group of the Solidarity Trial, representing 10 of the participating countries, met on 23 May 2020 and agreed to review a comprehensive analysis and critical appraisal of all evidence available globally, in light of publications of non-randomised observational evidence on the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine.\n\nThe review will consider data collected so far in the Solidarity Trial and in particular robust randomised available data, to adequately evaluate the potential benefits and harms from hydroxychloroquine.\n\nDeciding to err towards a conservative approach, the Executive Group has implemented a temporary pause of the hydroxychloroquine arm within the Solidarity Trial while the safety data is reviewed by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee.\n\nThe other arms of the trial are continuing. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are accepted as generally safe for use in patients with autoimmune diseases or malaria.\n\nKey materials:\n\nSolidarity Trial webpage\n\nWHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 25 May 2020\n\nWHO, Gavi and UNICEF warn that disruption to routine vaccination leaves at least 80 million children at risk\n\n22 May 2020\n\nCOVID 19 is disrupting life-saving immunization services around the world, putting millions of children – in rich and poor countries alike – at risk of diseases like diphtheria, measles and polio.\n\nProvision of routine immunization services is substantially hindered in at least 68 countries and is likely to affect approximately 80 million children under the age of 1 living in these countries.\n\nSince March 2020, routine childhood immunization services have been disrupted on a global scale that may be unprecedented since the inception of expanded programs on immunization (EPI) in the 1970s.\n\nThe reasons for disrupted services vary. Some parents are reluctant to leave home because of restrictions on movement, lack of information or because they fear infection with the COVID-19 virus. And many health workers are unavailable because of restrictions on travel, or redeployment to COVID response duties, as well as a lack of protective equipment. Transport delays of vaccines are also exacerbating the situation.\n\nDespite the challenges, several countries are making special efforts to continue immunization. Uganda is ensuring that immunization services continue along with other essential health services, even funding transportation to ensure outreach activities. And in Lao PDR, despite a national lockdown imposed in March, routine immunization in fixed sites continued with physical distancing measures in place.\n\nKey materials\n\nFramework for decision-making: implementation of mass vaccination campaigns in the context of COVID-19\n\nWHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 22 May 2020\n\nNews release\n\nWHO supports Smithsonian Science Education Center with launch of COVID-19 Guide for Youth\n\n21 May 2020\n\nIn collaboration with WHO and the InterAcademy Partnership (IAP), the Smithsonian Science Education Center has developed a new rapid-response guide for youth ages 8–17.\n\n“COVID-19! How can I protect myself and others\" is based on the UN Sustainable Development Goals and aims to help young people understand the science and social science of COVID-19.\n\nIntegrating inquiry-based science education with social and emotional learning and civic engagement, it looks to help them take actions to keep themselves, their families and communities safe.\n\nThe Smithsonian Science Education Center will disseminate the information to youth worldwide in collaboration with WHO, IAP, educators, and museum and research center networks. The guide is free and will be available to youth in more than 15 languages, particularly African and Asian languages.\n\nKey materials\n\nGuide: COVID-19! How Can I Protect Myself and Others?\n\nNews release\n\nUN launches 'Verified' initiative\n\n21 May 2020\n\nVerified is a UN initiative to encourage us all to check the advice we share, as the world can only contain the coronavirus if every person has access to accurate, reliable information.\n\nBy promoting and sharing Verified content – marked by a double tick – everyday people can play a crucial role by giving reliable information about COVID-19 to their friends, families and social networks, with the goal of saving lives and countering misinformation.\n\nOrganisations, businesses, civil society and media platforms can partner with Verified to spread information that helps protect people, communities and forges connections across the planet.\n\nVerified’s team of communicators, creatives and researchers produce content based on the latest information and guidance from the UN, WHO and other UN agencies. The team works with leading experts on misinformation, First Draft.\n\nKey materials\n\n'Verified' initiative webpage\n\nWHO releases package on rapid mortality surveillance with partners\n\n21 May 2020\n\nCompared with only using COVID-19 confirmed deaths as a measure of impact, rapid mortality surveillance generates daily or weekly counts of mortality data by age, sex, date of death, place of death and place of usual residence.\n\nThis surveillance provides a more complete picture of impact, particularly for deaths that may be indirectly related to COVID-19. It also addresses the indirect impact caused by disruptions in healthcare access and supply chains.\n\nWhen policy-makers can compare estimated weekly number of excess deaths related to COVID-19 compared with pre-pandemic levels, they have a powerful tool to inform their national response and recovery planning.\n\nKey materials:\n\nRevealing the toll of COVID-19: Technical package for rapid mortality surveillance and epidemic response\n\nDay 2 of 73rd World Health Assembly\n\n19 May 2020\n\nAt today’s meeting of the 73rd World Health Assembly —its first-ever to be held virtually—delegates adopted a landmark resolution to bring the world together to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe resolution, co-sponsored by more than 130 countries, was adopted by consensus.\n\nIt calls for the intensification of efforts to control the pandemic, and for equitable access to and fair distribution of all essential health technologies and products to combat the virus. It also calls for an independent and comprehensive evaluation of the global response, including, but not limited to, WHO’s performance.\n\nAs WHO convened ministers of health from almost every country in the world, the consistent message throughout the two-day meeting—including from the 14 heads of state participating in the opening and closing sessions —was that global unity is the most powerful tool to combat the outbreak. The resolution is a concrete manifestation of this call, and a roadmap for controlling the outbreak.\n\nIn his closing remarks to the Assembly, the DIrector-General outlined how WHO is fighting COVID-19 with every tool at its disposal.\n\nAs with the opening, leaders from around the world spoke during the closing of the Assembly.\n\nNew Executive Board members were elected:\n\nThe World Health Assembly will reconvene later in the year.\n\nKey materials:\n\nPress release\n\nWHO Director-General's closing remarks at the World Health Assembly\n\nWorld Health Assembly page with video recordings\n\nMain documents for WHA\n\nWHA Journal\n\nResolution on COVID-19 response\n\nDay 1 of 73rd World Health Assembly\n\n18 May 2020\n\nThe first-ever virtual World Health Assembly kicked off at noon on 18 May with the 'WHO: A global response to a global pandemic' video, shown in 6 languages.\n\nIn his remarks to the Assembly, the Director-General paid tribute to nurses, midwives and all health workers, who have been on the frontlines saving lives. He ended with a call for solidarity.\n\nLeaders from around the world spoke during the opening of the Assembly.\n\nThe Assembly also elected a President and five Vice-Presidents:\n\nKey materials:\n\nWorld Health Assembly page with livestream\n\nWHO Director-General's opening remarks at the World Health Assembly\n\nMain documents for WHA\n\nWHA Journal\n\n'WHO: A global response to a global pandemic' video in: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish\n\nIndependent Oversight and Advisory Committee releases interim report on COVID-19 response\n\n18 May 2020\n\nThe Independent Oversight and Advisory Committee (IOAC) provides regular reporting on WHO’s emergencies programme. It was set up at the same time as the programme.\n\nThe IOAC interim report notes that WHO responded more quickly than in previous emergencies and “demonstrated leadership and has made important progress in its COVID-19 response.” The report also provides recommendations for WHO and Member States on how to improve the COVID-19 response.\n\nWHO welcomes the committee’s report, which is part of existing mechanisms to review WHO’s work and ensure a constant feedback loop to improve performance.\n\nKey materials:\n\nIOAC's interim report\n\nWHO teams up with the International Olympic Committee to improve health through sport\n\n16 May 2020\n\nWHO signed an agreement with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to work together to promote health through sport and physical activity. This collaboration is timely because the current COVID-19 pandemic is particularly affecting people with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). The agreement has a special focus on preventing NCDs through sport.\n\nOther areas of collaboration include working with host countries to ensure the health of athletes, supporters and workers at the games as well as addressing NCD risk factors, including water quality and air pollution. The two institutions will also work to ensure that the games leave a healthy legacy in host countries through enhanced awareness of the value of sport and physical activity.\n\nThe two organizations also intend to work together promote grassroots and community sports programmes that have a further reach within the general public, particularly among girls, older people and people living with disability who may find it harder to keep active and healthy.\n\nSpecial World Health Assembly talk with Professor Devi Sridhar\n\n16 May 2020\n\nProfessor Devi Sridhar, Chair of Global Public Health at the University of Edinburgh, helped preview the first-ever virtual World Health Assembly (WHA).\n\nShe presented WHA as an opportunity for countries to report on progress and what they need in the response to COVID-19. Describing science as the \"true exit strategy\", Professor Sridar also sees WHA as a chance to further develop the research and development roadmap focused on the coronavirus.\n\nProfessor Sridhar outlined how WHO was created to respond to events like the COVID-19 pandemic, as a normative and technical agency that supports member states. She also explained the International Health Regulations, Emergency Committee and significance of declaring a Public Health Emergency of International Concern – among many other topics.\n\nKey materials\n\nVideo recording: Special talk about WHA73 with Devi Sridhar\n\nWHO and Costa Rica preview technology pooling initiative\n\n15 May 2020\n\nPresidents Carlos Alvarado Quesada of Costa Rica and Sebastián Piñera of Chile joined WHO's Director-General to announce progress on a technology platform that aims to lift access barriers to effective vaccines, medicines and other health products against COVID-19.\n\nThe platform will pool data, knowledge and intellectual property for existing or new COVID-19 health products to deliver ‘global public goods’ for all people and all countries. Through the open sharing of science and data, numerous companies will be able to access the information they need to produce the technologies, thereby scaling up availability worldwide, lowering costs and increasing access.\n\nWHO scientific brief on multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and adolescents with COVID-19\n\n15 May 2020\n\nRelatively few cases of infants confirmed to have COVID-19 have been reported; those who are infected have experienced mild illness.\n\nRecently, however, reports from Europe and North America have described clusters of children and adolescents requiring admission to intensive care units with a multisystem inflammatory condition with some features similar to those of Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome.\n\nIt is essential to characterize this syndrome and its risk factors, to understand causality, and describe treatment interventions. It is not yet clear the full spectrum of disease, and whether the geographical distribution in Europe and North America reflects a true pattern, or if the condition has simply not been recognized elsewhere.\n\nThere is therefore an urgent need for collection of standardized data describing clinical presentations, severity, outcomes, and epidemiology. WHO has developed a preliminary case definition and case report form for multisystem inflammatory disorder in children and adolescents. The case definition will be revised as more data become available.\n\nIn addition to more detail on the above, the Scientific Brief also includes information on the preliminary case definition and Global COVID-19 Clinical Data Platform.\n\nKey materials\n\nScientific Brief: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and adolescents with COVID-19\n\nWHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 15 May 2020\n\nWHO Gender and COVID-19 Advocacy Brief\n\n14 May 2020\n\nThe pandemic is impacting women and men differently.\n\nFrom risk of exposure and biological susceptibility to infection to the social and economic implications, individuals’ experiences are likely to vary according to their biological and gender characteristics and their interaction with other social determinants.\n\nCOVID-19 strategic plans must be grounded in strong gender analysis and ensure meaningful participation of women and girls in decision-making and implementation.\n\nWHO calls on its Member States and all global actors to guide investments in quality and gender-sensitive research on the adverse health, social and economic impacts of COVID-19.\n\nCountries are advised to incorporate a focus on gender into their COVID-19 responses in order to ensure that public health policies and measures to curb the pandemic account for gender and how it interacts with other inequalities.\n\nKey materials\n\nAdvocacy brief: Gender and COVID-19\n\nWHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 15 May 2020\n\nVideo recording of 15 May media briefing\n\nUN Policy Brief on COVID-19 and the need for action on mental health\n\n13 May 2020\n\nAn increase in symptoms of depression and anxiety are already being reported in a number of countries in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. A study in Ethiopia in April 2020 reported a 3-fold increase in the prevalence of symptoms of depression compared to estimates from before the epidemic.\n\nFrontline health-care workers, women, children, adolescents, older persons and people with pre-existing mental health conditions are all at particular risk. A rise in alcohol consumption is another area of concern for mental health experts.\n\nThe increase in people in need of mental health or psychosocial support has been compounded by the interruption to mental health services in many countries.\n\nIn concrete terms, it is critical that people living with mental health conditions have continued access to treatment. Many countries have changed their approach to the provision of this support in ways that are showing signs of success.\n\nSupport for community actions that strengthen social cohesion and reduce loneliness, particularly for the most vulnerable, must also continue.\n\nKey materials:\n\nUN Policy Brief on COVID-19 and the need for action on mental health\n\nNews release: Substantial investment needed to avert mental health crisis\n\nWHO web page: Mental health and COVID-19\n\nWHO statement on tobacco use and COVID-19\n\n11 May 2020\n\nCOVID-19 is an infectious disease that primarily affects the lungs. Smoking impairs lung function making it harder for the body to fight off coronaviruses and other diseases. Tobacco is also a major risk factor for noncommunicable diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory disease and diabetes which put people with these conditions at higher risk for developing severe illness when affected by COVID-19.\n\nWHO is constantly evaluating new research, including research that examines the link between tobacco use, nicotine use, and COVID-19. A review of studies by public health experts convened by WHO on 29 April 2020 found that smokers are more likely to develop severe disease with COVID-19, compared to non-smokers.\n\nWHO urges researchers, scientists and the media to be cautious about amplifying unproven claims that tobacco or nicotine could reduce the risk of COVID-19. There is currently insufficient information to confirm any link between tobacco or nicotine in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.\n\nKey materials:\n\nWHO statement: Tobacco use and COVID-19\n\nWHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 11 May 2020\n\nCOVID-19-related service disruptions could cause hundreds of thousands of extra deaths from HIV\n\n11 May 2020\n\nNew modelling on HIV convened by the World Health Organization and UNAIDS highlights the importance of taking immediate steps to minimise interruptions in health services and supplies of antiretroviral drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe worst case scenario considered by the modelling group was a 6-month disruption of antiretroviral therapy. The group suggested that this could lead to more than 500 000 extra deaths from AIDS-related illnesses, including from tuberculosis, in sub-Saharan Africa over the next year.\n\nAt a media briefing today the WHO Director-General said that the modelling should be a “wake-up call,” and that despite attention being focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, we must still ensure that global supplies of tests and treatments for both HIV and TB reach the countries and communities that need them most.\n\nKey materials\n\nJoint news release with UNAIDS\n\nJewell B, Mudimu E, Stover J, et al for the HIV Modelling consortium, Potential effects of disruption to HIV programmes in sub-Saharan Africa caused by COVID-19: results from multiple models.

It emphasises the need to adapt and reinforce existing national systems where appropriate and to scale-up surveillance capacities as needed.\n\nGenerally speaking, digital technologies for rapid reporting, data management, and analysis will be helpful. Robust comprehensive surveillance should be maintained even in areas where there are few or no cases; it is critical that new cases and clusters are detected rapidly and before widespread disease transmission occurs. Ongoing surveillance is also important to understand longer-term trends in the disease and the evolution of the virus.\n\nSurveillance can be community-based and take place at the primary care level. Existing sentinel surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI) or acute respiratory infection (ARI) is useful to monitor COVID-19 transmission trends. There should also be enhanced surveillance for residential facilities and vulnerable groups.\n\nKey materials:\n\nSurveillance strategies for COVID-19 human infection\n\nOperational considerations for COVID-19 surveillance using GISRS: interim guidance\n\nCritical preparedness, readiness and response actions for COVID-19\n\nNew guidance on contact tracing\n\n10 May 2020\n\nContact tracing is the process of identifying, assessing, and managing people who have been exposed to a disease to prevent onward transmission. When systematically applied, contact tracing will break the chains of transmission of COVID-19 and is an essential public health tool for controlling the virus.\n\nContact tracing for COVID-19 requires identifying people who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and following them up daily for 14 days from the last point of exposure.\n\nThis document provides guidance on how to establish contact tracing capacity for the control of COVID-19, covering issues such as the ideal profile of a contact tracer and what to do if a contact cannot be reached.\n\nCritical elements of the implementation of contact tracing are community engagement and public support; careful planning and consideration of local contexts, communities, and cultures; a workforce of trained contact tracers and supervisors; logistics support to contact tracing teams; and a system to collate, compile, and analyse data in real-time.\n\nKey materials:\n\nContact tracing in the context of COVID-19\n\nConsiderations in the investigation of cases and clusters of COVID-19\n\nConsiderations for public health and social measures in the workplace\n\n10 May 2020\n\nNew guidance from WHO outlines measures to protect against COVID-19 in workplaces.\n\nIt covers carrying out a workplace risk assessment and outlines measures for all workplaces in the areas of hand and respiratory hygiene; physical distancing; reduction and management of work-related travel; regular environmental cleaning and disinfection; risk communication, training and education; and management of people with COVID-19 or their contacts.

With COVID-19, WHO is working to drive forward the ‘Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator’, which aims to ensure that new health technologies will be developed, manufactured and distributed equitably.\n\nDr Tedros noted that humanity’s victory over smallpox is a reminder of what is possible when nations come together to fight a common health threat: \"The decisive factor in the victory over smallpox was global solidarity. At the height of the Cold War, the Soviet Union and the United States of America joined forces to conquer a common enemy. They recognized that viruses do not respect nations or ideologies.”\n\nKey materials\n\nUN issues $6.7 billion appeal to protect millions in fragile countries\n\n7 May 2020\n\nAn update to the UN’s Global Humanitarian Response Plan was launched today by the Executive Director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, Dr Mike Ryan; UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, Mark Lowcock; President and CEO of Oxfam America, Abby Maxman; UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi; and Executive Director of the World Food Programme, David Beasley.\n\nDr Ryan emphasized that helping the most vulnerable to confront COVID-19 is not just a moral imperative, it is in enlightened self interest: \"It is not only the right thing to do, it is the smart thing to do.

Testing, isolating and treating people with COVID-19 and tracing their contacts is also challenging in places with weaker health systems.\n\nPublic health and social measures in these settings must be balanced against other risks, such as lack of income, limited access to basic services, food insecurity, and lack of a social safety net. Measures also need to be pragmatic and leverage the strengths of local structures and systems, notably through social mobilization and strong community engagement.\n\nThis interim guidance outlines how to adapt COVID-19 prevention and response measures for use in low capacity and humanitarian settings.\n\nKey materials:\n\nInterim guidance on public health and social measures for COVID-19 preparedness and response in low capacity and humanitarian settings\n\nWHO marks the International Day of the Midwife and Hand Hygiene Day\n\n5 May 2020\n\nHand Hygiene Day mobilizes people around the world to increase adherence to hand hygiene in health care facilities. This year, the campaign theme, “Save Lives: Clean your hands”, is aligned with the Year of the Nurse and the Midwife and highlights the critical role of nurses and midwives in infection prevention, protecting health care workers and patients.\n\nInternational Day of the Midwife paid tribute to midwives for continuing to show resilience and provide life-saving services to pregnant women, ensuring healthy outcomes for women and their babies – all amidst the COVID 19 pandemic.\n\nChief Nursing Officer Elizabeth Iro took part in the #SafeHands challenge and also visited Geneva University Hospital (HUG) to show WHO's support for nurses and midwives and help promote the message of cleaning hands to save lives.\n\nIn an online feature story, WHO told the story of Sania, a midwife in a governmental hospital in Islamabad, Pakistan, who reassured Razia, a 25-year-old woman expecting her second child, about how she could take COVID-19 precautions to feel more confident after a complicated first birth.

To minimise the risk of a resurgence when lifting \"lockdowns\", countries should use six criteria.\n\nThey should assess whether transmission is controlled; health system capacities are in place; outbreak risks in special settings like nursing homes are minimised; preventive measures are enacted in places that are essential for people to go to; importation risks can be managed and communities are fully educated, engaged and empowered to adjust to the “new norm”.\n\nKey materials:\n\nInterim guidance: Considerations in adjusting public health and social measures\n\nA relentless commitment to science, solutions and solidarity\n\n15 April 2020\n\nSpeaking at the COVID-19 media briefing, WHO's Director-General stressed that our \"commitment to public health, science and to serving all the people of the world without fear or favour remains absolute.\"\n\n\"The United States of America has been a longstanding and generous friend to WHO, and we hope it will continue to be so.\n\nWe regret the decision of the President of the United States to order a halt in funding to the World Health Organization.\n\nWith support from the people and government of the United States, WHO works to improve the health of many of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people.\n\nIn due course, WHO’s performance in tackling this pandemic will be reviewed by WHO’s Member States and the independent bodies that are in place to ensure transparency and accountability. This is part of the usual process put in place by our Member States.\n\nNo doubt, areas for improvement will be identified and there will be lessons for all of us to learn.\n\nBut for now, our focus – my focus – is on stopping this virus and saving lives.\n\nWHO is grateful to the many nations, organizations and individuals who have expressed their support and commitment to WHO in recent days, including their financial commitment.\n\nWe welcome this demonstration of global solidarity, because solidarity is the rule of the game to defeat COVID-19.\n\nWHO is getting on with the job.\"\n\nKey materials:\n\nWHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 15 April 2020\n\nMeasles and Rubella Initiative responds to COVID-19\n\n14 April 2020\n\nAs COVID-19 continues to spread globally, over 117 million children in 37 countries may miss out on receiving life-saving measles vaccines.\n\nThe Measles & Rubella Initiative (M&RI) strongly agrees with the recommendation in WHO guidelines that governments temporarily pause preventive immunization campaigns where there is no active outbreak of a vaccine-preventable disease. However, the M&RI also urges countries to continue routine immunization services, while ensuring the safety of communities and health workers.\n\nWHO asks governments to undertake a careful risk-benefit analysis when deciding whether to delay vaccination campaigns in response to outbreaks, with the possibility of postponement where risks of COVID-19 transmission are deemed unacceptably high.\n\nThe Measles & Rubella Initiative (M&RI) is a global partnership, founded by the American Red Cross, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Protection, UNICEF, the United Nations Foundation and WHO.\n\nKey materials:\n\nStatement by the Measles & Rubella Initiative: WHO, American Red Cross, U.S. CDC, UNICEF and UN Foundation\n\nMajor relief airlift will bring vital medical supplies to all African nations\n\n14 April 2020\n\nToday the first United Nations “Solidarity Flight” departed from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

However, a number of medicines have been suggested as potential investigational therapies, many of which are now being or will soon be studied in clinical trials, including the SOLIDARITY trial co-sponsored by WHO and participating countries.\n\nIn many countries, doctors are giving COVID-19 patients medicines that have not been approved for this disease. The use of licensed medicines for indications that have not been approved by a national medicines regulatory authority is considered “off-label” use. The prescription of medicines for off-label use by doctors may be subject to national laws and regulations. All health care workers should be aware of and comply with the laws and regulations governing their practice. Further, such prescribing should be done on a case-by-case basis. Unnecessary stockpiling and the creation of shortages of approved medicines that are required to treat other diseases should be avoided.\n\nIt can be ethically appropriate to offer individual patients experimental interventions on an emergency basis outside clinical trials, provided that no proven effective treatment exists; it is not possible to initiate clinical studies immediately; the patient or his or her legal representative has given informed consent; and the emergency use of the intervention is monitored, and the results are documented and shared in a timely manner with the wider medical and scientific community.[1]\n\nThe decision to offer a patient an unproven or experimental treatment is between the doctor and the patient but must comply with national law. Where it is possible and feasible for the treatment to be given as part of a clinical trial, this should be done unless the patient declines to participate in the trial.\n\nIf it is not possible to give the treatment as part of a clinical trial, appropriate records of the use of the medicine must be kept, in compliance with national law, and outcomes for patients should be monitored and recorded.\n\nIf early results from an unproven or experimental treatment are promising, the treatment should be studied in the context of a formal clinical trial to establish its safety, efficacy, risks, and benefits.\n\nWHO and FIFA team up on campaign to kick out coronavirus\n\n23 March 2020\n\nWHO and FIFA launched the “Pass the message to kick out coronavirus” campaign, led by world-renowned footballers.

It is a word that, if misused, can cause unreasonable fear, or unjustified acceptance that the fight is over, leading to unnecessary suffering and death.\n\nDescribing the situation as a pandemic does not change WHO’s assessment of the threat posed by this virus. It doesn’t change what WHO is doing, and it doesn’t change what countries should do.\n\nWe have never before seen a pandemic sparked by a coronavirus. This is the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus.\n\nAnd we have never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled, at the same time.\"\n\n“The rule of the game is: never give up.”\n\n9 March 2020\n\n“We are not at the mercy of this virus,” said the WHO Director-General at the 9 March media briefing.\n\nAll countries must aim to stop transmission and prevent the spread of COVID-19, whether they face no cases, sporadic cases, clusters or community transmission.\n\n“Let hope be the antidote to fear.\n\nLet solidarity be the antidote to blame.\n\nLet our shared humanity be the antidote to our shared threat\"\n\nKey materials:\n\nWHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 9 March 2020\n\nPeriscope recording of the press conference\n\nMarking 100 000 cases\n\n7 March 2020\n\nMarking this sombre moment, WHO reminded all countries and communities that the spread of this virus can be significantly slowed or even reversed through the implementation of robust containment and control activities.\n\nEvery effort to contain the virus and slow the spread saves lives. These efforts give health systems and all of society much needed time to prepare, and researchers more time to identify effective treatments and develop vaccines.\n\nAllowing uncontrolled spread should not be a choice of any government, as it will harm not only the citizens of that country but affect other countries as well.\n\nWe must stop, contain, control, delay and reduce the impact of this virus at every opportunity. Every person has the capacity to contribute, to protect themselves, to protect others, whether in the home, the community, the healthcare system, the workplace or the transport system.\n\nKey materials\n\nStatement on cases of COVID-19 surpassing 100 000\n\nSituation dashboard\n\nLaunch of Be Ready campaign\n\n5 March 2020\n\nWHO launches a new social media campaign called Be Ready for COVID-19, which urges people to be safe, smart and kind.\n\n'Be Ready' was launched because everyone can prepare for COVID-19, including individuals, governments and businesses.\n\nWe're calling on people to Be Safe by remembering tried & tested public health measures, like regular hand washing & staying at least 1 metre (3 feet) from anyone coughing or sneezing. These ordinary measures are extraordinarily effective at fighting COVID-19.\n\nWe're asking people to Be Smart about COVID-19 by rejecting rumours & taking care to only share information from trusted sources. Everyone should keep informed about what is happening in their area and follow the recommendations of local authorities.\n\nWe're reminding people to Be Kind through addressing stigma and looking out for one another - especially the most vulnerable and those in isolation. Compassion can combat #COVID19.\n\nBelow is a tweet from footballer Paul Pogba getting involved with the campaign.\n\nKey materials:\n\nWHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 5 March 2020\n\nMission of WHO experts arrive in Iran\n\n2 March 2020\n\nLanding in Tehran, the experts aim to identify transmission dynamics and at-risk populations, as well as provide guidance on strengthening and scaling up the response and readiness efforts.\n\nThe mission arrived along with a shipment containing medical supplies and protective equipment to support over 15,000 health care workers and enough laboratory kits to test and diagnose nearly 100,000 people.\n\nThe mission will build on the COVID-19 preparedness and response work already underway by WHO's country office in the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nKey materials:\n\nEMRO news release\n\nDo your part to stop stigma and combat COVID-19\n\n25 February 2020\n\nThe WHO Director-General has repeatedly called for \"solidarity, not stigma\" to address COVID-19.\n\nWHO has worked with UNICEF and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies on a guide to preventing and addressing the social stigma associated with the disease.\n\nIt's vital to fight stigma because it can drive people to hide the illness, not seek health care immediately and discourage them from adopting healthy behaviours.\n\nThis guide includes some tips and messages, as well as dos and don'ts on language when talking about COVID-19.\n\nKey materials:\n\nGuide to preventing and addressing social stigma\n\nWHO-China joint mission shares findings and recommendations\n\n25 February 2020\n\nThe team of 25 international and Chinese experts travelled to several different provinces, with a small group going to Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.\n\nAmong the team's findings was that the epidemic peaked and plateaued between the 23rd of January and the 2nd of February, and has been declining steadily since then. The team also estimates that the measures taken in China have averted a significant number of cases.\n\nIn a press conference in Geneva on Tuesday 25 February, Dr Bruce Aylward, the mission's lead, reported back on what China has done, its impact and implications.\n\nKey materials:\n\nPeriscope recording of Dr Aylward’s press briefing\n\nWHO Director-General's opening remarks at the mission briefing on COVID-19 - 26 February 2020\n\nReport of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\n\nUN Secretary-General visits WHO\n\n24 February 2020\n\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres met with the WHO Director-General and other WHO leaders, receiving a briefing on COVID-19, Ebola and polio. He expressed great admiration for health workers, including in China, who are working tirelessly to save lives. The UN Secretary-General also stressed that there is no space for stigma and discrimination and said we must be guided by science and human rights-based interventions.\n\nWHO and China leaders meet in Beijing to discuss coronavirus outbreak\n\n28 January 2020\n\nWHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus met with China's President Xi Jinping in Beijing about the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nDr Tedros was joined by WHO Regional Director Dr Takeshi Kasai and Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme Dr Mike Ryan, and also met State Councilor and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi and Minister of Health Ma Xiaowei.\n\nThe discussions focused on continued collaboration on containment measures in Wuhan, public health measures in other cities and provinces, conducting further studies on the severity and transmissibility of the virus, continuing to share data, and for China to share biological material with WHO. These measures will advance scientific understanding of the virus and contribute to the development of medical countermeasures such as vaccines and treatments.\n\nThe two sides agreed that WHO would send international experts to visit China as soon as possible to work with Chinese counterparts on increasing understanding of the outbreak to guide global response efforts.\n\nKey materials:\n\nNews release\n\nWHO makes field visit to Wuhan, China\n\n21 January 2020\n\nThe delegation observed and discussed active surveillance processes, temperature screening at Wuhan Tianhe airport, laboratory facilities, infection prevention and control measures at Zhongnan hospital and its associated fever clinics, and the deployment of a test kit to detect the virus.\n\nThe delegation also discussed public communication efforts and China's plan to expand the case definition for the novel coronavirus, which will build a clearer picture of the spectrum of severity of the virus.\n\nAt the end of the visit, the Chinese Government released the primers and probes used in the test kit for the novel coronavirus to help other countries detect it. Chinese experts also shared a range of protocols that will be used in developing international guidelines, including case definitions, clinical management protocols and infection control.\n\nKey materials:\n\nStatement"
