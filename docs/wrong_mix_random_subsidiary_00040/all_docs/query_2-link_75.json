        "text": "Enrollment in Zelle® with a U.S. checking or savings account is required to use the service. Chase customers must use an eligible Chase consumer or business checking account, which may have its own account fees. Consult your account agreement. To send money to or receive money from a small business, both parties must be enrolled with Zelle® directly through their financial institution’s online or mobile app experience. Funds are typically made available in minutes when the recipient’s email address or U.S. mobile number is already enrolled with Zelle® (go to enroll.zellepay.com to view participating banks). Select transactions could take up to 3 business days. Enroll on the Chase Mobile® app or Chase Online℠. Limitations may apply. Message and data rates may apply.\n\nZelle® is intended for payments to recipients you know and trust and is not intended for the purchase of goods from retailers, online marketplaces or through social media posts. Neither Zelle® nor Chase provide protection if you make a purchase of goods using Zelle® and then do not receive them or receive them damaged or not as described or expected. In case of errors or questions about your electronic funds transfers, including information on reimbursement for fraudulent Zelle® payments, see your account agreement. Neither Chase nor Zelle® offers reimbursement for authorized payments you make using Zelle®, except for a limited reimbursement program that applies for certain imposter scams where you sent money with Zelle®. This reimbursement program is not required by law and may be modified or discontinued at any time.\n\nZelle and the Zelle related marks are wholly owned by Early Warning Services, LLC and are used herein under license.\n\nThis score planner resource does not guarantee you will reach your credit score goal even if you complete the recommended actions, as there are other factors that may impact your VantageScore. This resource should be used for educational purposes only. There are various types of credit scores that lenders can access to make a lending decision. The credit score you receive is based on the VantageScore® 3.0 model and may not be the credit score model used by your lender or by Chase."
