        "text": "Louise Glück\n\nPoetry\n\nEnglish\n\nSwedish\n\nTHE RED POPPY\n\nThe great thing\n\nis not having\n\na mind. Feelings:\n\noh, I have those; they\n\ngovern me. I have\n\na lord in heaven\n\ncalled the sun, and open\n\nfor him, showing him\n\nthe fire of my own heart, fire\n\nlike his presence.\n\nWhat could such glory be\n\nif not a heart? Oh my brothers and sisters,\n\nwere you like me once, long ago,\n\nbefore you were human? Did you\n\npermit yourselves\n\nto open once, who would never\n\nopen again? Because in truth\n\nI am speaking now\n\nthe way you do. I speak\n\nbecause I am shattered.\n\n‘The Red Poppy’ from THE WILD IRIS by Louise Glück\n\nCopyright © 1992, Louise Glück. All rights reserved.\n\nNOSTOS\n\nThere was an apple tree in the yard—\n\nthis would have been\n\nforty years ago—behind,\n\nonly meadow. Drifts\n\nof crocus in the damp grass.\n\nI stood at that window:\n\nlate April. Spring\n\nflowers in the neighbor’s yard.\n\nHow many times, really, did the tree\n\nflower on my birthday,\n\nthe exact day, not\n\nbefore, not after? Substitution\n\nof the immutable\n\nfor the shifting, the evolving.\n\nSubstitution of the image\n\nfor relentless earth. What\n\ndo I know of this place,\n\nthe role of the tree for decades\n\ntaken by a bonsai, voices\n\nrising from the tennis courts—\n\nFields. Smell of the tall grass, new cut.\n\nAs one expects of a lyric poet.\n\nWe look at the world once, in childhood.\n\nThe rest is memory.\n\n‘Nostos’ from MEADOWLANDS by Louise Glück\n\nCopyright © 1996, Louise Glück. All rights reserved.\n\nTELESCOPE\n\nThere is a moment after you move your eye away\n\nwhen you forget where you are\n\nbecause you’ve been living, it seems,\n\nsomewhere else, in the silence of the night sky.\n\nYou’ve stopped being here in the world.\n\nYou’re in a different place,\n\na place where human life has no meaning.\n\nYou’re not a creature in a body.\n\nYou exist as the stars exist,\n\nparticipating in their stillness, their immensity.\n\nThen you’re in the world again.\n\nAt night, on a cold hill,\n\ntaking the telescope apart.\n\nYou realize afterward\n\nnot that the image is false\n\nbut the relation is false.\n\nYou see again how far away\n\neach thing is from every other thing.\n\n‘Telescope’ from AVERNO by Louise Glück\n\nCopyright © 2006, Louise Glück. All rights reserved.\n\nCROSSROADS\n\nMy body, now that we will not be traveling together much longer\n\nI begin to feel a new tenderness toward you, very raw and unfamiliar,\n\nlike what I remember of love when I was young—\n\nlove that was so often foolish in its objectives\n\nbut never in its choices, its intensities.\n\nToo much demanded in advance, too much that could not be promised—\n\nMy soul has been so fearful, so violent:\n\nforgive its brutality.\n\nAs though it were that soul, my hand moves over you cautiously,\n\nnot wishing to give offense\n\nbut eager, finally, to achieve expression as substance:\n\nit is not the earth I will miss,\n\nit is you I will miss.\n\n‘Crossroads’ from A VILLAGE LIFE by Louise Glück\n\nCopyright © 2009, Louise Glück. All rights reserved.\n\nABORIGINAL LANDSCAPE\n\nYou’re stepping on your father, my mother said,\n\nand indeed I was standing exactly in the center\n\nof a bed of grass, mown so neatly it could have been\n\nmy father’s grave, although there was no stone saying so.\n\nYou’re stepping on your father, she repeated,\n\nlouder this time, which began to be strange to me,\n\nsince she was dead herself; even the doctor had admitted it.\n\nI moved slightly to the side, to where\n\nmy father ended and my mother began.\n\nThe cemetery was silent. Wind blew through the trees;\n\nI could hear, very faintly, sounds of weeping several rows away,\n\nand beyond that, a dog wailing.\n\nAt length these sounds abated. It crossed my mind\n\nI had no memory of being driven here,\n\nto what now seemed a cemetery, though it could have been\n\na cemetery in my mind only; perhaps it was a park, or if not a park,\n\na garden or bower, perfumed, I now realized, with the scent of roses—\n\ndouceur de vivre filling the air, the sweetness of living,\n\nas the saying goes. At some point,\n\nit occurred to me I was alone.\n\nWhere had the others gone,\n\nmy cousins and sister, Caitlin and Abigail?\n\nBy now the light was fading. Where was the car\n\nwaiting to take us home?\n\nI then began seeking for some alternative. I felt\n\nan impatience growing in me, approaching, I would say, anxiety.\n\nFinally, in the distance, I made out a small train,\n\nstopped, it seemed, behind some foliage, the conductor\n\nlingering against a doorframe, smoking a cigarette.\n\nDo not forget me, I cried, running now\n\nover many plots, many mothers and fathers—\n\nDo not forget me, I cried, when at last I reached him.\n\nMadam, he said, pointing to the tracks,\n\nsurely you realize this is the end, the tracks do not go farther.\n\nHis words were harsh, and yet his eyes were kind;\n\nthis encouraged me to press my case harder.\n\nBut they go back, I said, and I remarked\n\ntheir sturdiness, as though they had many such returns ahead of them.\n\nYou know, he said, our work is difficult: we confront\n\nmuch sorrow and disappointment.\n\nHe gazed at me with increasing frankness.\n\nI was like you once, he added, in love with turbulence.\n\nNow I spoke as to an old friend:\n\nWhat of you, I said, since he was free to leave,\n\nhave you no wish to go home,\n\nto see the city again?\n\nThis is my home, he said.\n\nThe city—the city is where I disappear.\n\n‘Aboriginal Landscape’ from FAITHFUL AND VIRTUOUS NIGHT by Louise Glück\n\nCopyright © 2014, Louise Glück. All rights reserved.\n\nA FORESHORTENED JOURNEY\n\nI found the stairs somewhat more difficult than I had expected and so I sat down, so to speak, in the middle of the journey. Because there was a large window opposite the railing, I was able to entertain myself with the little dramas and comedies of the street outside, though no one I knew passed by, no one, certainly, who could have assisted me. Nor were the stairs themselves in use, as far as I could see. You must get up, my lad, I told myself. Since this seemed suddenly impossible, I did the next best thing: I prepared to sleep, my head and arms on the stair above, my body crouched below. Sometime after this, a little girl appeared at the top of the staircase, holding the hand of an elderly woman. Grandmother, cried the little girl, there is a dead man on the staircase! We must let him sleep, said the grandmother. We must walk quietly by. He is at that point in life at which neither returning to the beginning nor advancing to the end seems bearable; therefore, he has decided to stop, here, in the midst of things, though this makes him an obstacle to others, such as ourselves. But we must not give up hope; in my own life, she continued, there was such a time, though that was long ago. And here, she let her granddaughter walk in front of her so they could pass me without disturbing me.\n\nI would have liked to hear the whole of her story, since she seemed, as she passed by, a vigorous woman, ready to take pleasure in life, and at the same time forthright, without illusions. But soon their voices faded into whispers, or they were far away. Will we see him when we return, the child murmured. He will be long gone by then, said her grandmother, he will have finished climbing up or down, as the case may be. Then I will say goodbye now, said the little girl. And she knelt below me, chanting a prayer I recognized as the Hebrew prayer for the dead. Sir, she whispered, my grandmother tells me you are not dead, but I thought perhaps this would soothe you in your terrors, and I will not be here to sing it at the right time.\n\nWhen you hear this again, she said, perhaps the words will be less intimidating, if you remember how you first heard them, in the voice of a little girl.\n\n‘A Foreshortened Journey’ from FAITHFUL AND VIRTUOUS NIGHT by Louise Glück\n\nCopyright © 2014, Louise Glück. All rights reserved.\n\nSONG\n\nLeo Cruz makes the most beautiful white bowls;\n\nI think I must get some to you\n\nbut how is the question\n\nin these times\n\nHe is teaching me\n\nthe names of the desert grasses;\n\nI have a book\n\nsince to see the grasses is impossible\n\nLeo thinks the things man makes\n\nare more beautiful\n\nthan what exists in nature\n\nand I say no.\n\nAnd Leo says\n\nwait and see.\n\nWe make plans\n\nto walk the trails together.\n\nWhen, I ask him,\n\nwhen? Never again:\n\nthat is what we do not say.\n\nHe is teaching me\n\nto live in imagination:\n\na cold wind\n\nblows as I cross the desert;\n\nI can see his house in the distance;\n\nsmoke is coming from the chimney\n\nThat is the kiln, I think;\n\nonly Leo makes porcelain in the desert\n\nAh, he says, you are dreaming again\n\nAnd I say then I’m glad I dream\n\nthe fire is still alive\n\n‘Song’ from WINTER RECIPES FROM THE COLLECTIVE by Louise Glück\n\nCopyright © 2021, Louise Glück.
