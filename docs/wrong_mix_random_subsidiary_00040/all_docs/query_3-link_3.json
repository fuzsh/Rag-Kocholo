He is also a senior partner at Kleiner Perkins and a member of Apple Inc.’s board of directors.\n\nGore was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1976, 1978, 1980, and 1982 and to the U.S. Senate in 1984 and 1990. He was inaugurated as the 45th Vice President of the United States on January 20, 1993, and served 8 years.\n\nHe is the author of the #1 New York Times best-sellers ‘An Inconvenient Truth’ and ‘The Assault on Reason’, and the best-sellers ‘Earth in the Balance’, ‘Our Choice: A Plan To Solve the Climate Crisis’, ‘The Future: Six Drivers of Global Change’, and most recently, the New York Times best-seller ‘An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power’.\n\nHe is the subject of the documentary movie ‘An Inconvenient Truth’, which won two Oscars in 2006—and a second documentary in 2017, ‘An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power’. In 2007, Gore was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, along with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, for “informing the world of the dangers posed by climate change.”"
