        "text": "Why Do Your Eyeglasses Cost $1,000?\n\nA single company, EssilorLuxottica, owns so much of the eyewear industry that it’s hard to escape their gravitational pull — or their “obscene” markups. Should regulators do something? Can Warby Parker steal market share? And how did Ray-Bans become a luxury brand? (Part one of a two-part series.)\n\nPeople Aren’t Dumb. The World Is Hard. (Update)\n\nYou wouldn’t think you could win a Nobel Prize for showing that humans tend to make irrational decisions. But that’s what Richard Thaler has done. In an interview from 2018, the founder of behavioral economics describes his unlikely route to success; his reputation for being lazy; and his efforts to fix the world — one nudge at a time.\n\nFarewell to a Generational Talent\n\nDaniel Kahneman left his mark on academia (and the real world) in countless ways. A group of his friends and colleagues recently gathered in Chicago to reflect on this legacy — and we were there, with microphones.\n\nWhy Don’t We Have Better Candidates for President?\n\nAmerican politics is trapped in a duopoly, with two all-powerful parties colluding to stifle competition.

A runaway hit like Stereophonic — which just won five Tony Awards — will create a few big winners. But even the stars of the show will have to go elsewhere to make real money. (Part two of a two-part series.)\n\nThe Fascinatingly Mundane Secrets of the World’s Most Exclusive Nightclub\n\nThe Berlin dance mecca Berghain is known for its eight-hour line and inscrutable door policy. PJ Vogt, host of the podcast Search Engine, joins us to crack the code. It has to do with Cold War rivalries, German tax law, and one very talented bouncer.\n\nWalking Can Be Hazardous to Your Health\n\nStephen Dubner talks with the transportation scholar Kelcie Ralph about why so many pedestrians are killed on America’s roads.\n\nTo get Plus episodes, become a member at Apple Podcasts or at freakonomics.com/plus.\n\nHow to Make the Coolest Show on Broadway\n\nHit by Covid, runaway costs, and a zillion streams of competition, serious theater is in serious trouble.

(Part one of a two-part series.)\n\nKevin Kelly Has Some Advice for You\n\nRevisiting an episode about parenting, travel, luck, and why we should all spend more time on YouTube.\n\nTo get Plus episodes, become a member at Apple Podcasts or at freakonomics.com/plus.\n\nSigns of Progress, One Year at a Time\n\nEvery December, a British man named Tom Whitwell publishes a list of 52 things he’s learned that year. These fascinating facts reveal the spectrum of human behavior, from fraud and hypocrisy to Whitwell’s steadfast belief in progress. Should we also believe?\n\nThe Opioid Tragedy — How We Got Here\n\nAn update of our 2020 series, in which we spoke with physicians, researchers, and addicts about the root causes of the crisis — and the tension between abstinence and harm reduction.\n\nCan $55 Billion End the Opioid Epidemic?\n\nThanks to legal settlements with drug makers and distributors, states have plenty of money to boost prevention and treatment. Will it work? (Part two of a two-part series.)\n\nThinking Differently About Opioid Addiction\n\nStephen Dubner talks with addiction doctor Stephen Loyd about Loyd’s own experience with addiction, and how we should approach recovery in the U.S.\n\nTo get Plus episodes, become a member at Apple Podcasts or at freakonomics.com/plus.\n\nWhy Has the Opioid Crisis Lasted So Long?\n\nMost epidemics flare up, do their damage, and fade away. This one has been raging for almost 30 years. To find out why, it’s time to ask some uncomfortable questions. (Part one of a two-part series.)\n\nCar Colors & Storage Units\n\nPresenting two stories from The Economics of Everyday Things: Why does it seem like every car is black, white, or gray these days? And: How self-storage took over America.\n\nWhat Does Glenn Loury Think About Reparations?\n\nStephen Dubner talked to the economist and social critic in 2020 about whether Black Americans should receive government payments for the lasting damages of slavery.\n\nTo get Plus episodes, become a member at Apple Podcasts or at freakonomics.com/plus.\n\nConfessions of a Black Conservative\n\nThe economist and social critic Glenn Loury has led a remarkably turbulent life, both professionally and personally.

In this episode of the Freakonomics Radio Book Club, the historian Richard Cockett explores all those ideas — and how the arrival of fascism can ruin in a few years what took generations to build.\n\nWhy Is 23andMe Going Under? (Update)\n\nFive years ago, we published an episode about the boom in home DNA testing kits, focusing on the high-flying firm 23andMe and its C.E.O. Anne Wojcicki. Their flight has been extremely bumpy since then. This update includes an additional interview with the Wall Street Journal reporter who has been investigating the firm’s collapse.\n\nCanada’s Basic Income Experiment\n\nLong before the world knew what a “universal basic income” was, Canada experimented with giving poor households extra money.
