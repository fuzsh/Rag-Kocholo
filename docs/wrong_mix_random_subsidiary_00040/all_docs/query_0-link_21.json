She played Julia Baker, a nurse struggling to raise a young son by herself after her husband was killed in the Vietnam war.\n\nThe show, which ran for three seasons and earned her a Golden Globe Award, was a breakthrough for African-American women who were only beginning to make inroads on the small screen at the time.\n\nCulture stars we lost in 2019\n\nShow all 91\n\nCarroll’s success in Julia set her up for another title role in the 1974 movie, Claudine, for which she received an Oscar nomination. Playing opposite James Earl Jones, she played a single mother again, this time living in Harlem with six children and on public relief.\n\nShe went on to play numerous roles, mostly in television shows and made-for-TV movies, until just a few years ago. Notably, she portrayed Dominique Deveraux​ in Dynasty in the Eighties.\n\nCarol Diahann Johnson was born in the Bronx borough of New York City on 17 July, 1935, the daughter of a subway conductor, and began singing with her Harlem church choir at age six, according to IMDB.com.\n\nIn 1954, she landed her first singing role on Broadway in the musical House of Flowers, before going on to play Clara in Otto Preminger’s big screen version of Porgy and Bess in 1959.\n\nWatch Apple TV+ free for 7 days\n\nNew subscribers only. £8.99/mo. after free trial.

An icon. One of the all-time greats. She blazed trails through dense forests and elegantly left diamonds along the path for the rest of us to follow. Extraordinary life. Thank you, Ms Carroll.”\n\nActor Gabrielle Union tweeted: “She is, was, and forever will be AN ICON!! Simply everything, EVERYTHING!”\n\nEmpire co-creator Lee Daniels shared his own homage, writing: “I’m at an utter loss of words right now. The impact you have had on me, Hollywood, America, the World is telling that God exists. I love you.”\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
