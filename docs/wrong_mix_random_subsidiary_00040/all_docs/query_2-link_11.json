        "text": "If you’ve been looking to add one of Apple’s high-quality products to your tech collection, you’re in luck. Prime Day Apple deals include tons of discounted AirPods, Apple Watches, iPads and more. We’ve picked out the best items here—ones that can level up your workouts, self-care practice, and day-to-day life. Apple gadgets are highly sought-after—and rarely available on sale—so don’t sleep on these Prime Day discounts while you can get ‘em.\n\nThe top Apple Prime Day Deals\n\nAirPods Pro Wireless Earbuds (3rd Generation)—originally $169, now $140\n\nAirPods Max Wireless Over-Ear Headphones—originally $549, now $450\n\nApple Watch Series 9 Smartwatch—originally $429, now $329\n\nIn this article\n\nShop Apple audio products\n\nShop Apple Watches\n\nShop iPads\n\nShop Macbooks\n\nShop Apple accessories\n\nWith up to 30 hours (!) of battery life, these sweat- and water-resistant earbuds will have no problem powering you through a marathon, long bike ride, or epic hike. “I was never able to use wireless headphones when working out before I tried these AirPods—everything would fall out of my ear when I was running, so I was literally using $10 wired earbuds that would short-circuit with sweat every few months,\" says SELF's fitness director. “I’ve had my AirPods since 2020 and they’ve never fallen out on a run once. When I'm pounding the pavement, I wear just one bud so I can stay alert to sounds on the road, and it still provides great sound.”\n\nIf you prefer over-the-ear-style headphones, consider snatching up a pair of these uber-comfortable wireless ones that can play for 20 hours on one charge. Active noise cancellation can help you zone in on your own hype tracks at the gym or tune into your work no matter what kind of chaos is happening around you.\n\nYou can snag the latest Apple Watch for nearly 25% off on Amazon right now. Besides being more durable than past models and being able to track all kinds of workouts from HIIT to swimming, the Series 9 has tons of other cool features: You can use it to take an ECG reading anytime, get notifications if you have an irregular heart rhythm, track your sleep, menstrual cycle, and temperature, and take notes on your mental health to help you identify patterns.\n\nThese extra health and safety features makes the Apple Watch a great gift for parents or grandparents, says one SELF editor. “I gave them to my parents this past Christmas and they were super into them, especially the health-tracking and fall-detection features,” she says. “And I knew they would never buy such a big-ticket item for themselves, so it felt perfect for gifting!”\n\nImagine your next vacay with one of these little guys—you can catch up on your favorite shows in the airport and on the plane, tuck it in your bag to read on the beach, whip it out to stream workouts in your Airbnb, and set it up in the kitchen so your favorite YouTuber can guide you through a fun new recipe.\n\nFor those who need a little more screen space, the classic iPad is on sale for nearly 25% off right now. With a 10.2-inch retina display, this gadget is perfect for playing video games, getting a truly immersive experience while you stream, and working on the go.\n\nIt also makes for a great workout buddy: “I use my iPad to do Peloton walk and run workouts, which is way more cost effective than buying the Peloton treadmill!” says one SELF editor. “So long as the treadmill has a little tray, I can prop my iPad up and it basically works the same as having a fancier workout machine—and the bonus is that i can take it with me anywhere.”\n\nTurn your iPad into a note-taking device with the Pencil Pro, or settle in for some chill creative time by switching on airplane mode and drawing digitally. When you're ready, you can easily share your art with friends or on your socials.\n\nA fresh laptop is a gamechanger, and if you're in the market for one, now’s the time to make a purchase. The Macbook Air, which features a 13.6-inch display, 256 GBs of storage, a 1080p camera, 18 hours of battery life, and a MagSafe charging port, and weighs only 2.7 pounds, is available for 20% right now.\n\nYou deserve to be comfy while you work, and a good mouse can help provide a more ergonomic setup. This wireless one works with both iPads and Macbooks, and can last for weeks without charging.\n\nNever lose your luggage or keys again with these trackers—they even have built-in speakers that you can ping when you know something’s lost nearby. You can stick them on a pet’s collar or your bike for added peace of mind and security when you’re exploring outside, too.\n\nShop more Amazon Prime Day deals:"
