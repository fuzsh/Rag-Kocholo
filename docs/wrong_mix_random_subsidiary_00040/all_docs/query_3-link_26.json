        "text": "Whenever we open a new window on the universe we discover something new.\n\nWhether it's figuring out how to see to greater distances like with telescopes, or down to smaller size-scales like with microscopes, or perhaps expanding our vision to new wavelengths of light or via exotic means such as in neutrinos or gravitational waves.\n\nWell, the 2023 Nobel prize in physics has been awarded to three physicists for opening just such a new window—but it's not a window to a new size scale or a new mode of seeing—-it’s for a new window in time.\n\nIt’s for attosecond physics—the billionth of a billionth of a second that represents the timescale of the insides of atoms.\n\nThis year’s Nobel in physics is for a microscope in time Every 230 million years the solar system completes one orbit around the Milky Way.\n\nEvery 243 years Venus passes between the Sun and the Earth.\n\nEvery year monarch butterflies migrate between the United States and Mexico.\n\nEvery 3 seconds a Kinesin protein travels down one of your cytoskeletal filaments.\n\nAs we look to smaller and smaller scales, we find faster and faster processes.\n\nMakes intuitive sense—big things surely have a hard time moving faster than their constituents.\n\nThe trend continues to the smallest scales—the motion of individual atoms during chemical reactions, or of individual electrons moving in atoms.\n\nThe timescale of their motion is not measured in microseconds nor nanoseconds, they're measured in attoseconds.\n\nAnd this is a very small amount of time indeed.\n\nThere are as many attoseconds in a second as there are seconds in the entire history of the universe.\n\nProbably there are some things to be discovered buried in that universe of phenomena that play out in every single second.\n\nAnd this is why the Swedish Academy of Sciences made a very reasonable choice in awarding Anne L'Hullier, Pierre Agostini and Ferenc Krausz the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physics for bringing into existence the field of attosecond physics.\n\nBefore we get to how our newly minted laureates managed this, let’s talk about why it was so difficult in the first place.\n\nThink about what it takes to observe something.\n\nObserving means watching things bounce off other things, whether it’s light bouncing off an apple into our eyes or electrons bouncing off a tardigrade into our electron microscope.\n\nThe smaller the object you want to observe, the smaller the particle you need to fling at it.\n\nFor example, you could get a rough idea of my shape by hurling beach balls at me and seeing how they scattered.\n\nBut you’d get a better picture pelting me with ping pong balls.\n\nOr even better, photons.\n\nResolving small distances requires scattering many particles with small spatial separation, into a well-defined spatial location.\n\nResolving very small times requires scattering many particles with small separations in time and well-defined temporal locations.\n\nImagine you want to take a video of a fast process—say, a hovering hummingbird.\n\nIf your camera aperture stays open too long you’ll only capture a blur over the span of the wings’ motion.\n\nThe aperture opening needs to have a well-defined temporal location—in other words, it needs to be quick.\n\nBut quick exposures aren’t going to give you a very good movie of the humminbird if they aren’t separated by less than a wing beat.\n\nThen you’ll only get a random seeming collection of stills.\n\nYou need short temporal separation to get a meaningful sequence.\n\nSo how do you get tight temporal location and short temporal separation down to the attometer?\n\nLet’s start by thinking about the temporal location of a photon.\n\nThat’s limited by its period—you can’t clock a photon to any time smaller than a single up-down cycle of its electromagnetic wave Light with a period of attoseconds is in the X-ray part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nWe routinely use X-rays in imaging, so we should be fine there, right?\n\nNot quite.\n\nA typical laser fires one photon every few femtoseconds - that’s 1000 times longer than an attosecond.\n\nSo even if you make a movie of attosecond motion with a conventional laser, the abysmal frame rate would turn the motion into a hopeless blur.\n\nIt is possible to build extremely fast lasers—for example, Free-Electron lasers… But they require an electron accelerator to work, and they are honestly too powerful and way too dangerous to give to the average physicist to play around with, and besides, blasting your sample with an X-ray laser of the power required would be like taking an x-ray using a nuclear explosion, it's just not practical.\n\nEnter our first Nobel laureate.\n\nBack in the 1980s Anne L’Huillier and her colleagues were playing around with irradiating Argon gas with infrared lasers.\n\nThey observed something pretty weird.\n\nNormally, when you irradiate a gas you’ll get different types of light out.\n\nThat includes some of the light you put in, some light corresponding to the electron transitions of the atom, as well as some random thermal light from the jiggling of the atoms.\n\nBut L’Huillier’s team noticed that the outgoing beam consisted of the original in-going frequency plus some higher frequencies that didn’t correspond to any known process.\n\nSo where did these other frequencies come from?\n\nIt’s pretty cool actually.\n\nAs a laser pulse passes by a gas atom, it can nudge the electromagnetic field holding the electrons in place in such a way that electron escapes by quantum tunneling.\n\nThe electron can then be pulled straight back to its atom and will release the energy it gained in a single photon, think of it like a stretching a spring and letting it go.\n\nThat one photon will have a higher energy than each of the many photons that made up the laser pulse.\n\nIn fact it’ll have a frequency that’s some integer multiple of the laser photons, and a cool detail is that it'll be an odd multiple, for complex reasons regarding symmetry This process is called high harmonic generation, and it basically adds overtones to the laser beam.\n\nPlay a note on any musical instrument and you’ll get the fundamental frequency plus higher frequency overtones.\n\nThe fundamental corresponds to the longest wavelength standing wave that can fit along the resonating string or air column, while the overtones correspond to all shorter wavelength standing waves that also fit.\n\nThe balance of the strength of the overtones determines the precise character of the sound of an instrument—its timbre.\n\nSo, the timbre of the laser was altered by the argon cloud.\n\nThat’s a cute effect, but we’re not quite at Nobel-level science just yet.\n\nTo get to attosecond physics, we need one more analogy with acoustics.\n\nListen to this.\n\nIt’s a very low G note.\n\nAnd this is a very low A.\n\nIndividually there’s nothing unusual, but if we play them together we hear a sort of \"wawawa\".\n\nThis is known as a \"beat\" in acoustics, and it’s due to the fact that the sine waves of the G and the A line up perfectly at certain points, making them louder with constructive interference, while they’re perfectly out of alignment elsewhere, and so cancel out with destructive interference.\n\nFor a pair of waves the beats are quite spread out, with a lower frequency than both of its parents.\n\nBut if you add more and more waves, it’s possible to narrow the width of the beats so you end up with sharp pulses and very little in between.\n\nFor that you need a large number of frequencies of similar intensity—for example, the rich spectrum of overtones produced in Anne L’Huillier’s experiment.\n\nIn fact, it proved possible to get pulses that were mere hundreds of attoseconds in their temporal width.\n\nOur new attosecond-resolved pulses weren’t ready for application just yet.\n\nThe potential value is that they would allow us to measure attosecond-scale events.\n\nBut if the pulses themselves are attosecond-scale events, how can we calibrate them to start with?\n\nIt's like trying to measure your height with a series of rules whose individual length you don’t know.\n\nAnd here we get to our second Nobel Laureate, Pierre Agostini.\n\nAgostini was able to calibrate the pulse train by again using constructive and destructive interference—this time in reference to the ingoing laser beam.\n\nHe did this by deflecting part of the beam and adding a delay to it before recombining it with the now-frequency-multiplied beam.\n\nIn this way he could measure the width of the pulses—clocking them at 250 attoseconds.\n\nHe also found that the pulses were what we call phase locked, which means the beats were nice and consistent and just what we needed for attosecond measurements.\n\nThese pulse trains provided pulses with attosecond temporal locality and separation, just as we required.\n\nBut for some applications it would be preferable to have single, isolated attosecond pulses.\n\nAnd that effort is thanks to our third Laureate, Ferenc Krausz.\n\nI won’t go into the gory details, but for your viewing pleasure here’s their Rube-Goldberg experimental setup.\n\nWith intricate phase and amplitude manipulation, they were able to create isolated pulses of 650 attoseconds, whose width was known to 150 attosecond precision.\n\nOK, attosecond resolution achieved.\n\nSo what can we do with it?\n\nAs Krausz himself states in an interview, they invented this technology because looking at Nature in a new way is wonderful, literally, it fills you with wonder.\n\nBut we did just give ourselves a new superpower, so it’d be a shame not to use it.\n\nThe first application of attosecond pulses was to look at electron motion in atoms and molecules.\n\nElectrons travel the breadth of their orbitals in a handful of attoseconds, or rather the fuzzy quantum clouds that define the electron in an atom change on that timescale.\n\nBy hitting these clouds with attosecond pulses we can study the shapes and dynamics of these electrons.\n\nAttosecond pulses can also be used to manipulate electrons on tiny timescales, which has a number of powerful applications.\n\nOne effort that Ferenc Krausz’s team is working on at the Max Planck institute for Quantum Optics is in molecular fingerprinting, in which attosecond pulses are frequency-tuned to cause vibrations in specific molecules.\n\nIn this way the detailed molecular composition of a sample can potentially be cataloged.\n\nThe Krausz team are using this to develop molecular fingerprinting devices for medical diagnosis.\n\nAnother very exciting possibility is the creation of ultrafast electronics.\n\nIf we have two metal plates with opposite electric charge and we shoot an isolated attosecond pulse at one of the plates it can be absorbed by an electron, which hops to the second plate.\n\nThis is the photoelectric effect, and we’ve known about it for 120 years.\n\nBut in the configuration I described it’s also a transistor, a key component in most of our technology.\n\nRegular transistors control the flow of electricity between two charged plates by changing the charge in a third plate, but this new type of transistor controls the flow using light itself, which can in principle be much, much faster—especially if the pulse width is measured in attoseconds.\n\nKrausz claims that it may be possible to increase the power of computers by a factor of 100,000 this way.\n\nThat sounds … optimistic.\n\nBut even if we get a fraction of that it’s an incredible achievement, and may save Moore's law for a few more decades.\n\nThose are just a couple of applications in medicine and electronics, but as we look at the universe with this new tool we are bound to find new applications and to make new discoveries.\n\nAfter all, every time we open a new window to the universe new mysteries are revealed—whether that window is to the largest, the smallest, and now the fastest phenomena in Space Time"
