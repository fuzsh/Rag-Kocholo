        "text": "Published\n\n14 March 2018\n\nWorld renowned physicist Stephen Hawking has died at the age of 76.\n\nHe died peacefully at his home in Cambridge in the early hours of Wednesday, his family said.\n\nThe British scientist was famed for his work with black holes and relativity, and wrote several popular science books including A Brief History of Time.\n\nAt the age of 22 Prof Hawking was given only a few years to live after being diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease.\n\nObituary: Stephen Hawking\n\nA life in pictures\n\nReaction to his death - latest updates\n\nThe illness left him in a wheelchair and largely unable to speak except through a voice synthesiser.\n\nIn a statement his children, Lucy, Robert and Tim, said: \"We are deeply saddened that our beloved father passed away today.\n\n\"He was a great scientist and an extraordinary man whose work and legacy will live on for many years.\"\n\nThey praised his \"courage and persistence\" and said his \"brilliance and humour\" inspired people across the world.\n\n\"He once said, 'It would not be much of a universe if it wasn't home to the people you love.' We will miss him forever.\"\n\nA book of condolence has been opened at Gonville and Caius College in Cambridge, where Prof Hawking was a fellow.\n\nProf Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology as a union of relativity and quantum mechanics.\n\nHe also discovered that black holes leak energy and fade to nothing - a phenomenon that would later become known as Hawking radiation.\n\nStephen Hawking in quotes\n\nThe discoveries that made Stephen Hawking famous\n\nTributes flood in for Stephen Hawking\n\nScience community mourns Stephen Hawking\n\nChina's love for the late Stephen Hawking\n\nA brief history of Stephen Hawking's cameos\n\nThrough his work with mathematician Sir Roger Penrose he demonstrated that Einstein's general theory of relativity implies space and time would have a beginning in the Big Bang and an end in black holes.\n\nThe scientist gained popularity outside the academic world and appeared in several TV shows including The Simpsons, Red Dwarf and The Big Bang Theory.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

Inside that shell, inside that body that was paralysed, was someone who was full of vigour, full of passion for life.\"\n\nHawking's discoveries\n\nWith the Oxford mathematician Roger Penrose, he showed that if there was a Big Bang, it must have started from an infinitely small point - a singularity\n\nBlack holes radiate energy known as Hawking radiation, while gradually losing mass. This is due to quantum effects near the edge of the black hole, a region called the event horizon\n\nHe predicted the existence of mini-black holes at the time of the Big Bang. These black holes would have shed mass until they vanished, potentially ending their lives in an explosion that would release vast amounts of energy\n\nIn the 1970s, Hawking considered whether the particles and light that enter a black hole were ultimately destroyed if the black hole evaporated. Hawking initially thought that this \"information\" was lost from the Universe. But the US physicist Leonard Susskind disagreed. These ideas became known as the information paradox. In 2004, Hawking conceded that the information must be conserved\n\nBritish astronaut Tim Peake said Prof Hawking \"inspired generations to look beyond our own blue planet and expand our understanding of the universe\".\n\nGian Giudice, head of theoretical physics at the European nuclear research laboratory CERN, said Prof Hawking had a \"great impact\" on the centre's research, adding: \"A giant of our field has left us, but his immortal contributions will remain forever.\"\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

But now, 50 years later, I can be quietly satisfied with my life.\"\n\nSpeaking to the BBC in 2002, his mother, Isobelle, described him as a \"very normal young man\".\n\nShe said: \"He liked parties. He liked pretty girls - only pretty ones. He liked adventure and he did, to some extent, like work.\""
