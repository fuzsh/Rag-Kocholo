        "text": "Although vampires are rarely encountered in Russian folklore, the image of the vampire has still become a popular one in Russian culture. This popularity has been particularly evident in the post-Soviet era, where vampires have been Russified not through folklore but by connecting them to Russian history and politics. The chapter presents an overview of what folklore does exist, then analyzes three works of nineteenth-century literature which originated the Russian depiction of the vampire. From there, the chapter turns to a close look at vampire media of the past 30 years, including several films of the 1990s, two novel series by Sergei Lukyanenko and Victor Pelevin, and three television shows from the early 2020s."
