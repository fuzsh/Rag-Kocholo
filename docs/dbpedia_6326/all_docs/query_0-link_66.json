        "text": "Fall 2024\n\nTolstoy’s War and Peace Part I and Durova’s The Cavalry Maiden\n\nThis online course is the first of two on Tolstoy’s War and Peace. The second course (covering Part II, Books 3 and 4) is planned for the winter/spring session of 2025. We will have a rare chance to spend the fall reading slowly and closely the first part (Books 1 and 2) of Leo Tolstoy’s War and Peace (1865–69), supplemented by Nadezhda Durova’s memoirs The Cavalry Maiden: Journals of a Russian Officer in the Napoleonic Wars (1836–39).\n\nWe will focus on close textual analysis of War and Peace and The Cavalry Maiden over a period of nine (9) meetings, supplemented by biographical, historical, and critical information related to the writings and that I will introduce at each meeting. During our meetings, several short episodes (not longer than 10 minutes each) will be shown from the Russian film War and Peace, a detailed adaptation of the novel directed by Sergei Bondarchuk (Mosfilm, 1968), War & Peace directed by Tom Harper (British 2016 TV series), and The Hussar Ballad directed by Eldar Ryazanov (1962).\n\nAlthough War and Peace tells the story of Russia’s military struggles with Napoleon between 1805 and 1812, it is also a story about many other things: friendship, love, violence, and death; parents and children, imperialism, nationalism, and strategy, and the search for one’s place in the world. In War and Peace Tolstoy’s purpose is to examine the lives not just of one group of people or separate characters, but of the whole nation within a period of 20 years. Following the main characters of the novel, we will explore the issues that interested Tolstoy: how to live and how to govern; what is the nature of life and death; what is courage; what the Russian nation is and how the people who are part of it are connected to each other; who should direct and rule the nation and to what extent it is necessary in the first place; and what are the forces that move history and what is the role of a single person in history.\n\nParticipants will learn about the Napoleonic wars of 1805 – 1813 and the historical situation in Europe and Russia of that period. In our discussions we will focus on the way Tolstoy shows us the deep internal spiritual evolution of his main characters. Our discussions will include a close look at the simplicity and lucidity of Tolstoy’s writing. One of the devices he uses is the repetition of some details that characterize a particular person the best. Tolstoy is a master of contrasts: we will compare not just War and Peace episodes, but formal life in St. Petersburg versus the more relaxed lifestyle in Moscow, as well the use of Russian and French language by the Russian nobility.\n\nWe will discuss the place of War and Peace in Tolstoy’s life and career, the book’s afterlife in film adaptations, and the complications of reading it in a new era of Russian expansionism and war. I will draw upon my Russian background to provide a unique perspective and the opportunity to appreciate some of the pleasures of the original Russian version of War and Peace that are inevitably lost in any translation. We will look closely, for example, at the semantics of the Russian and English words for “war” and “peace” to discover that they may have different meanings and connotations.\n\nDuring our last two meetings, we will examine The Cavalry Maiden: Journals of a Russian Officer in the Napoleonic Wars, the celebrated memoirs of Nadezhda Durova, a female cavalry officer who served in the Russian army disguised as a man during the Napoleonic wars. Since their publication in 1836, the memoirs became popular with Russian readers. The 1962 Soviet musical The Hussar Ballad transformed Durova’s military adventures into a cross-dressing love story. However, only recently the ambiguous gender identity of Nadezhda Durova, who considered her male identity to be her true self, became a subject to new studies of gender roles, masculinity, femininity, and sexuality.\n\nNote: I will provide all required reading materials that are not part of the text list, along with supplemental handouts for the participants through the Canvas LMS classroom specially developed for the course. Access to all the handouts and a wealth of optional readings and online resources (maps, illustrations, historical writings, Tolstoy’s drafts and letters, and literary criticism) are easy to navigate even for those with very limited computer skills.\n\nLeo Tolstoy’s War and Peace Part I and Durova’s The Cavalry Maiden\n\nCourse Outline.

ISBN-13: 978-0253205490\n\nSummer 2024\n\nDostoevsky’s Short Fiction and Film Adaptations\n\nThe purpose of the proposed course is to help participants who do not or who do have previous exposure to the Russian literature and Fyodor Dostoevsky’s fiction to understand and to enjoy his short fiction, including The Village of Stepanchikovo and Its Inhabitants (1859), The Double (1846), White Nights (1848), A Disgraceful Affair (1862), Notes from the Underground (1864), The Eternal Husband (1870), Bobok (1873), A Gentle Creature (1876), and The Dream of a Ridiculous Man (1877).\n\nThe course will emphasize group discussion. We will focus on close textual analysis of Dostoevsky’s fiction over a period of seven (7) sessions, supplemented by biographical, historical, and critical information related to Dostoevsky and his fiction introduced at each meeting and on the Canvas LMS classroom specially developed for the course. In addition, we will discuss some of the most successful and unusual film adaptations of Dostoevsky’s fiction: Partner (1968) directed by Bernardo Bertolucci (based on The Double), The Double (2013) directed by Richard Ayoade, Le notti bianche (White Nights) (1957) directed by Luchino Visconti, Notes from Underground (1998) directed by Gary Walkow, A Gentle Woman (1969) directed by Robert Bresson, and the animation The Dream of a Ridiculous Man directed by Alexander Petrov (1992).\n\nDostoevsky’s fiction captures the fluidity and instability of existence as experienced by most in any age. At the proposed course, we will address important questions: Why do we still read Dostoevsky and why should we continue to read him if his novels are so ambiguous? What is the nature of Dostoevsky’s art and how did it evolve from his early fiction to his mature works of the 1860s and 1870s?\n\nWe will follow the development of Dostoevsky’s literary method through his mastery of the psychology of human nature. The course will start with The Village of Stepanchikovo and Its Inhabitants, one of Dostoevsky’s most striking, accomplished, and highly entertaining short novels. Dostoevsky is often underappreciated as a writer of comedy, and this novel, written in a spirit of fun, has been largely overlooked. However, it is one of the best introductions to Dostoevsky. Combining humor, dynamic pace, and suspense, the novel is dominated by a pretentious and despotic pseudo-intellectual charlatan Foma Opiskin, one of the best villains in the Russian literature.\n\nThe confusion of experience and hallucination in the narrative of The Double, Dostoevsky’s second novel, will show us how Dostoevsky analyzes the inner complexity of even the most socially insignificant individuals who fail to escape the imaginary, using the device of polyphony, or multitude of voices.\n\nNotes from the Underground sums up many of the ideas and images that evolved during the previous two decades. Its antihero, as Dostoevsky calls him, reflects on the relationship between free will and determinism, irrationalism and materialism, and the idea that human imperfection is a law of nature and the cause of human suffering. Notes from the Underground is often seen as Dostoevsky’s major philosophical achievement and a prelude to his longer novels, but we will see that the novel includes several superb anecdotes.\n\nWe will follow Dostoevsky’s gift for satire and comedy revealed in A Disgraceful Affair and Bobok. White Nights, The Eternal Husband, A Gentle Creature, and The Dream of a Ridiculous Man richly illustrate Dostoevsky’s shifting attitude towards love, depicted with uncanny subtlety. The writer sees sexual love interwoven with a power situation in which one partner seeks to gain superiority over the other.\n\nDostoevsky’s short fiction attracted some of the best film directors, who benefited from the complexity of possible readings and created new versions of the stories. Literary adaptations make efforts to restructure the main concepts of the novels and interpret them at the same time. Cinema keeps turning to literature, and, in this course, we will explore a variety of successful adaptations of Dostoevsky’s works, which don’t try to produce “faithful” copies, but develop the elements of thought that resonate with our modern concerns. The adaptations work when the filmmakers, such as Bernardo Bertolucci, Richard Ayoade, Luchino Visconti, Gary Walkow, Robert Bresson, and Alexander Petrov, develop the creative dialogue with Dostoevsky, often radically departing from Dostoevsky’s form, content, and style, focusing instead on the individual details, gestures, and ideas and generating entirely new works of art.\n\nI will draw upon my Russian background to provide participants with a unique chance to appreciate some of the pleasures of the original Russian version of the Dostoevsky works that are inevitably lost in any translation. We will look closely, for example, at the translation of the title Notes from the Underground to discover that the Russian is closer to “Diary from Under the Floor,” which gives the reader a better characterization of Dostoevsky’s main character called “a mousey man” and “mouseman” by Vladimir Nabokov.\n\nDostoevsky’s Short Fiction\n\nCourse Outline – 7 sessions, online on Saturdays from 10:00 am to noon, starting June 15 and ending August 3, 2024\n\nSession 1 June 15, 2024\n\nReading Assignment: The Village of Stepanchikovo and Its Inhabitants, pp. 3 – 196\n\nSession 2 June 22, 2024\n\nReading Assignment: The Double, pp. 3 – 144\n\nSession 3 June 29, 2024\n\nReading Assignment: White Nights, pp. 145 – 201\n\nSession 4 July 13, 2024\n\nReading Assignment: A Disgraceful Affair, pp. 203 – 259 and Bobok (will be available on Canvas)\n\nSession 5 July 20, 2024\n\nReading Assignment: Notes from the Underground, Part I, pp. 261 – 377\n\nSession 6 July 27, 2024\n\nReading Assignment: The Eternal Husband, pp. 521 – 665\n\nSession 7 August 3, 2024\n\nReading Assignment: A Gentle Creature, pp. 667 – 714 and The Dream of a Ridiculous Man (will be available on Canvas)\n\nNOTE: I will provide all optional reading materials and supplementing handouts for the participants through the Canvas LMS classroom specially developed for the course. Access to all the handouts and a wealth of optional readings, visual art, and online resources will be easy to navigate even for those with very limited computer skills.\n\nText List\n\nRequired:\n\nThe Village of Stepanchikovo and Its Inhabitants by Fyodor Dostoevsky, translated by Roger Cockrell\n\n‎Alma Classics, 2024\n\nISBN-13:‎ 978-1847499080\n\nGreat Short Works of Fyodor Dostoevsky\n\nPerennial Classics, New York, 2004\n\nISBN-13: 978-0060726461\n\nPAST SEMINARS\n\nWinter and Spring 2024\n\nThe North Caucasus through Literature: from Leo Tolstoy to Alisa Ganieva\n\nThis course will introduce readers to the North Caucasus, particularly Chechnya and Dagestan, through some of the most celebrated short stories and novellas of all time by Leo Tolstoy (1828 – 1910); poems by Ramsul Gamzatov (1923 – 2003), a Dagestani popular poet; and short stories and a novel, Bride & Groom (2015), by Alisa Ganieva (b. 1985), a Dagestani writer and activist. The course will include both presentations and group discussion. We will focus on close textual analysis of the readings over a period of seven sessions, supplemented by biographical, historical, geographic, ethnographic, and critical information related to the North Caucasus, the authors, and their works.\n\nThe aggressive conquest of the Caucasus by the Russian Empire, which lasted for several decades of the 19th century, coincided with the rise of Russian romanticism, a cultural phenomenon which focused on the Russian perceptions of the Caucasus as the Orient. While most Russian romantic writers, including Alexander Pushkin (1799 – 1837) and Mikhail Lermontov (1814 – 1841), endorsed Russian imperialism in certain ways while taking issues with it in others, Leo Tolstoy was the first who denounced the subjugation of the Muslim peoples in the Caucasus as vile oppression. We will examine the development of Tolstoy as a writer and a thinker, starting with his earliest fiction written in 1850s, “The Raid” (1852) and “The Wood-Felling” (1855), both based on military actions against the Chechen mountain tribesmen, and his short novel The Cossacks (1852 – 1862), which addresses the problem of the literary romantic Caucasus versus the empirical Caucasus, and explores the failed cross-cultural communication between the Russians, the Cossacks, and the Caucasians. About fifty years later, Tolstoy returned to his experiences in the Caucasus in one of his last and most admired works, the epically tranquil novella Hadji Murad (1904), to this day a highly, insightful introduction to the backgrounds of today’s problems in the North Caucasus. Together we will examine how Tolstoy challenges Russia’s reigning myth about the Caucasian conquest as a civilizing mission.\n\nAlthough there is no such thing as a typical Tolstoy story, his short works share traits, such as Tolstoy’s superb realization and his ever-restless philosophical inquiry, a combination that produced fiction of an intensity that surprises even after repeated readings. Tolstoy’s work eschews intentional ambiguities and withheld information. The development of Tolstoy’s story is comparable to the peeling the layers off an onion, where the onion is the world and the leaves are the deceptions of civilization. We will discuss how, in “The Strider,” one of the most striking stories in Russian literature, Tolstoy uses the technique of de-familiarization or estrangement by adopting the perspective of a horse to expose some of the irrationality of human conventions. In Hadji Murad, one of his last and finest tales, Tolstoy demonstrates what he called the “peepshow” method. This is essentially the method, on a meticulous and miniature scale, that makes War and Peace a vast scenic panorama. Hadji Murad is a superbly objective tale that has something in common both with Shakespeare’s plays of power and fate and with Conrad’s corrosively perceptive depiction of colonialism in Heart of Darkness. For all the majestic clarity and calm with which the story unfolds, this tale is one of the most ferocious denunciations in all literature of the realities and necessities of power and war.\n\nDuring the second half of the course, we will explore the North Caucasus of the 20th and the 21st centuries. Our main focus will be on Dagestan, a crossroads of multiple civilizations. Whereas most former Soviet republics were ethnolinguistically defined territories, Dagestan successfully resisted such engineering thanks to the diversity of its cultures, ethnicities, languages, and religions. Dagestani writers, who challenge the hegemony of the writers of Russian descent, alter the way the Caucasus has been represented.\n\nWe will analyze popular poems by Ramsul Gamzatov, written in the Avar language (the Avars being one of the largest groups in Dagestan), following the tradition of folk songs. Alisa Ganieva, also an Avar and the first novelist from Dagestan translated into English, writes in Russian, moving between different locations, cultures, and languages in her work. Ganieva presents the Caucasus as an insider, focusing on a Dagestani society that is more nuanced than Russian stereotypes suggest: her Dagestan is a place where tradition vies with modernization, corruption and violence are widespread, and post-Soviet institutions reanimate religious fundamentalism. At the same time, Ganieva’s Bride & Groom is witty and much more than the simple love story its title suggests.\n\nI will draw upon my Russian background to provide participants with a unique chance to appreciate some of the pleasures of the original Russian versions of the stories and novellas and the Avar poems that are inevitably lost in any translation. Among the most distinctive components of Tolstoy’s, Gamzatov’s, and Ganieva’s stylistics that we will examine are the representation of space and time, the use of language, the techniques of narration, the use of physical details, and the modes of characterization.\n\nSpring 2024\n\nMalevich’s Black Square: Negation of Art or A New Icon?\n\nThis spring we will focus on Polish-Ukrainian artist Kazemir Malevich (1879 – 1935), one of the most radical and influential figures in modern art, through the prism of his groundbreaking painting and an icon of modernity, The Black Square. We will examine different ways to interpret The Black Square and crack its enigmas. Today, the life of The Black Square continues and takes new meanings, shaping and transforming the world in unexpected ways. We will focus on close visual and textual analysis of Malevich’s art and writings over a period of three (3) sessions, supplemented by contextual background and critical information related to The Black Square, Malevich, and other Modernist and contemporary artists that I will present at each meeting.\n\nThe beginning of the 20th century brought a period of radical change in artistic culture. Kazemir Malevich’s life and career were marked by the upheavals that affected millions of people: the First World War, the October Revolution, the Civil War (in Russia), and Stalin’s industrial revolution and collectivization. Just like Pablo Picasso’s Demoiselles d’Avignon of 1907 and Marcel Duchamp’s Fountain of 1917, Malevich created his own revolution in art when he displayed The Black Square at The Last Futurist Exhibition 0,10 in St. Petersburg in 1915, unveiling Suprematism and separating what had come before from what was to follow.\n\n“The square is not an image, just as a switch or socket is not yet an electric current,” wrote Malevich. No other work of art exposed the radical character of experimentation more than The Black Square: a monochrome geometric form on a monochrome background, black on white, placed in a corner, traditionally a sacred place in an Orthodox home, above all other paintings, taking the role of an icon of negation. The Black Square announced a new, uncompromisingly modern age.\n\nDuring the course, we will explore multiple ways to understand various meanings of this innovative and somewhat disturbing image. Particular attention will be given to traditional icons and their influence on Malevich and the Russian avant-garde.\n\nWe will also examine the birth of new Suprematist forms and theories that embodied a new utopian vision of Russia by Malevich and his students, as well as other artists’ responses to and participation in the political, social, scientific, and cultural experimentation of their time. How do artists respond to and shape historical events? How do utopian ideas and dreams transform into reality? Although we will move in a rough chronological progression, we will jump ahead or look back when needed, focusing on leaps, bounds, and reversals of the era and the life of The Black Square.\n\nDespite all that it negated, The Black Square opened as many new doors as it closed, taking a crucial conceptual step towards our understanding of the limitless potential of non-figurative art and creating a new language of shapes and colors, which we will examine during our last class. Like all true icons, The Black Square became an image that transcended its own time and became part of our everyday life.\n\nFall 2023\n\n“New Soviet Women:” History, Art, Fiction, and Film (1917-1940)\n\nThis multi-disciplinary course will examine early 20th century Soviet feminism and gender policies, as well as the political, economic, social, and cultural implications of gender stereotypes, against the real-life experiences and changing roles of Soviet women from the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 up to WWII. We will examine ten propaganda models of “new Soviet woman,” constructed by the Soviet authorities, to determine how they influenced social change and affected the lives of women not only in the capitals (Moscow and Leningrad), but throughout the Soviet Union, including the frontiers of the Far East and the recently colonized Central Asia, the villages of Buryatia, Tatarstan, and the Urals, and the new factory towns in Siberia.\n\nThe Russian revolution led to devastated civil war and famines; horrors of collectivization and industrialization; the creation of an unprecedentedly repressive police state and a Gulag system. It also produced an eruption of social experimentation in the name of class, gender, and ethnic egalitarianism; an explosion of a huge-scale production; a cultural revolution; and practices of euphoric collectivism and altruistic self-sacrifice unknown in capitalist cultures. Soviet women went through a wide range of experiences in the revolution and two first decades of the Soviet power, and the lives of all of them were deeply affected by the upheavals of the times. The course will illuminate a variety of meanings Soviet women attached to gender and problems they experienced connected to it.\n\nIntercultural understanding and a pedagogy of compassion will guide the teaching of this course. Examining the lives of Soviet women of various social, geographical, ethnic backgrounds, occupations, political and religious convictions through art, individual stories, film, and fiction against the state-determined roles of Soviet women will require participants to debunk stereotypes, reassess new challenging evidence through the filter of their experiences, reflect on the value of new knowledge in their own lives, and develop and enhance their sense of compassion for diverse and multicultural world.\n\nNatalia Danko (1892-1942). Discussing Stalin’s Constitution at an Uzbek Collective Farm, 1937. Self-portrait. At Work, 1920s. Porcelain. State Porcelain Factory @ The Russian Museum, St. Petersburg.\n\nThe seminar will include both presentations and group discussion over a period of 10 sessions, supplemented by biographical, historical, visual, and critical information introduced at each meeting. Drawing upon my Russian background, I hope to provide everyone with a unique chance to appreciate some of the pleasures of the original Russian versions of our reading narratives that are inevitably lost in any translation. I will also collect and translate articles, posters, subtitles, and visual media to lead to a better understanding of women’s experiences in the Soviet Union.\n\nEach session will correspond to one of the main and officially prioritized roles of Soviet women, which we will explore through life stories, art, fiction, and film to separate myth from reality: 1) Woman as Gendered Allegory of Revolution; 2) Brave Daughter of the Civil War: Red Army Soldier, Commissar, Pilot; 3) Woman as a Worker and a Peasant; 4) “Vostochnitsa” (Easterner): Colonial Dimension of Soviet Feminism; 5) “Dalnevostochnitsa” (Far Eastener): Building Socialism on the Frontiers; 6) Woman as an Athlete and Heroine; 7) “Engineers’ Wives” of the second half of the 1930s; 8) Woman as Mother and Consumer: Totalitarian Body; 9) “Former Women” and Gulag Women; 10) Women Artists: Self-Description.\n\nWe will use the following tools to analyze the above generalized women’s models through diverse case studies:\n\nFiction: We will read and discuss Zuleikha by Guzel Yakhina (translated by Lisa C. Hayden), a novel about a peasant woman from a small village in Tatarstan, exiled in Siberia in 1930, as well as short stories by Alexei Tolstoy and Alexandra Kollontai.\n\nVisual Art: Instead of focusing on well-known avant-garde artists and famous Bolshevik mass-produced posters, the course will challenge our assumptions about Soviet art and revolution by combining known and unknown artists and various mediums, including posters, photomontage, and graphic work in women’s magazines, and photography, advertisements, and fine art from small watercolors to monumental panels, sculpture, and porcelain.\n\nPersonal Stories: We will be exploring literary memoirs, oral interviews, personal files, public speeches, letters, newspaper and magazine articles, and documentaries. Special attention will be given to articles in women’s magazines. The autobiographies and interviews with Soviet women will be taken from two books: In the Shadow of Revolution: Life Stories of Russian Women from 1917 to the Second World War and A Revolution of Their Own: Voices of Women in Soviet History. (See the text list below for more information.)\n\nFilm: Episodes from the following films will be available on Canvas: Bed and Sofa (1927) dir. by Abram Room; Man with a Movie Camera dir. by Dziga Vertov; Three Songs about Lenin (1934) dir. by Dziga Vertov; Three Heroines (1938) by Dziga Vertov; and A Girl with a Temper (1939) dir. by Konstantin Yudin.\n\nCovers of Working Woman magazine, 1923 and 1927.\n\n&nbsp:\n\nSummer 2023\n\nFocus on Ukraine: Understanding Ukraine through Contemporary Literature\n\nAndrey Kurkov, one of the Ukrainian writers we will be reading in this course, wrote before the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022: “In 1991, the Soviet Union was divided into 15 separate ‘streets.’ However, since 1991 the USSR and Ukraine have not been identical for me, neither do they mean the same or even similar things to me. The USSR means a deceased state, while Ukraine means a vibrant state. It is alive and entirely different from the Soviet Union.”\n\nThis summer, we will be reading about Ukraine as part of the Soviet Union and as an independent state. We will ask questions about Ukraine’s multifaceted Soviet and post-Soviet identity. Ukraine was the country most touched by Soviet and Nazi terror: what can we learn about this experience from Ukraine? What does it mean to be Jewish in Ukraine? What is the history of Russian-Ukrainian conflicts and wars? Why did Russia invade Ukraine, and what does it mean now to witness the impact of a tragic and conflicted history that continues to this day? How do you continue living during the ongoing war and in the rootlessness of exile? Is the post-colonial, multilingual Ukrainian nation a holdover from the past, or does it hold promise for the future?\n\nParticipants will be introduced to contemporary Ukrainian authors writing in Russian who testify to the diverse and multicultural identity of Ukraine – from the polyphony of Ukrainian and Jewish voices in the post-war Soviet Ukraine of the 1950s of Margarita Khemlin’s (1960-2015) The Investigator to the contemporary Ukraine’s grey zone between loyalist and separatist forces of Andrey Kurkov’s (b. 1961) Grey Bees and the ironic and lyrical world of the displaced women from Eastern Ukraine of Yevgenia Belorusets’s (b. 1980) collection of stories Lucky Breaks.\n\nWe will focus on close textual analysis of Ukrainian literature and arts over a period of 6 meetings, supplemented by biographical, historical, and critical information that I will present at the beginning of each meeting.\n\nOn one level, Khemlin’s The Investigator seems to be a murder mystery, full of turns and twists set in Chernigov at the time of Stalin’s death. However, the narrative is a polyphonic, multi-layered story that blends the personal and the public, the Jewish and the non-Jewish, the world of WWII and the post-war reality, the individual and the universal. In an interview, Khemlin said that “It’s possible to win the war, but nobody knows how to live after that.” The war and its horrors keep coming back, revealing the tensions between the Jewish community and Soviet Ukraine.\n\nThe armed conflict in Ukraine first started in the beginning of 2014, when Russia invaded and annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea and initiated the ongoing armed conflict in Donbass. Both Andrey Kurkov’s Grey Bees and Yevgenia Belorusets’s Lucky Breaks take the readers to Donbass, Crimea, and Kyiv. We will explore how Kurkov tackles the ongoing war with absurdist humor and deep, gentle sympathy for those caught in between, who wrestle with the shadows of the past and complex ethical questions. Lucky Breaks doesn’t describe combat operations. Instead, Belorusets combines fictional and real stories of women, and documentary photography and writing to highlight the effect of military conflict on civilians, especially on women refugees.\n\nDuring the last class, we will discuss the situation in Ukraine after February 24, 2022, when Russia launched a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine, plunging the entire country into war and sending shock-waves across the world. The discussion will be centered on excerpts from the 2022 diaries of the invasion by Andrey Kurkov and Yevgenia Belorusets, contemporary, anti-war visual arts, and other important documentary accounts and films.\n\nI hope to draw upon my Russian background to provide the participants with a unique chance to appreciate some of the pleasures of the original Russian versions of our reading narratives that are inevitably lost in any translation. I will be collecting, translating, and sharing articles, memes, cartoons, art, and social media, which will provide a better understanding of contemporary Ukraine. I look forward to and encourage lively discussions.\n\nReading List and Handouts: I will provide all required reading materials that are not part of the text list, plus supplemental handouts, through the Canvas LMS classroom specially developed for this seminar. Access to all the handouts and a wealth of optional readings and online resources are easy to navigate even for those with very limited computer skills.\n\nWinter-Spring 2023\n\nFocus on Ukraine: Gogol’s Ukrainian Tales, Babel’s Odessa Stories, and Bulgakov’s White Guard\n\nSix months after the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in February, 2022, the Ukrainian Education Ministry announced that the Russian language courses had been removed from Ukraine’s school curriculum, along with works by Russian and Belarusian writers. The foreign literature courses have retained books by authors “who wrote in Russian, but whose life and work were closely connected to Ukraine,” including such writers as Nikolai Gogol (Mykola Hohol in Ukrainian; 1809-1852), Isaac Babel (1894-1940), and Mikhail Bulgakov (1891-1940).\n\nUkrainian authors writing in Russian testify to the diverse and multicultural identity of Ukraine – from the brilliant imagination and grotesque exuberance of Nikolai Gogol’s Ukrainian Tales and Taras Bulba to Isaac Babel’s polyphonic, romantic, and violent world of Jews and gentiles in Odessa Stories to the psychological humanity and people’s resilience of Mikhail Bulgakov’s The White Guard. We will try to answer why Gogol, Babel, and Bulgakov, who were born in Ukraine and wrote about it, are now considered foreign authors. Reading about Ukraine’s past, we will ask other questions about Ukraine’s multifaceted identity: Who are Ukrainians? Why does Russia trace its origins to a place that is the capital of Ukraine, another country? Who are Cossacks? How did Ukraine survive during the chaos of the Civil War that followed WW1 and the Russian Revolution? What is the history of Russian-Ukrainian conflicts and wars? What does it mean to be Jewish in Ukraine? Was Isaac Babel a Soviet, Ukrainian, Russian, or Jewish writer? What is the national identity of Gogol and Bulgakov?\n\nWe will focus on close textual analysis of Ukrainian literature over a period of nine (9) meetings, supplemented by biographical, historical, and critical information related to the writings that I will introduce at each meeting. During the sessions, several short episodes (not longer than 10 – 15 minutes each) will be shown from the films Evenings on a Farm near Dikanka (Russia, 1961), Viy (Russia, 1967 and 2014), Benya Krik directed by Vladimir Vilner (screenplay by Isaac Babel) in 1926, and from documentaries.\n\nWe will read and discuss Gogol, Babel, and Bulgakov, while simultaneously examining the history and culture of Ukraine from the rise and fall of Kyivan Rus, the Polish and Lithuanian rule, the Cossack Era, the impact of Russian and Austrian Imperial rule on Ukraine, the Pale of Settlement, the growth of national consciousness in the 19th century, the first World War, the Civil War that followed, and the quest for Ukrainian independence.\n\nNikolai Gogol is one of the most gifted and enigmatic great writers, who at various times has been read as a Ukrainian and a Russian, realist, a symbolist, a fantasist, a comedian, a satirist, and a tragedian. The force and originality of his imagination influenced many generations of writers. We will read Gogol’s short tales from his two early collections of Ukrainian tales Evenings on a Farm near Dikanka (Parts I and II) and Mirgorod (“Viy”, “Old World Landowners”, and “The Story of How Ivan Ivanovich Quarreled with Ivan Nikifirovich”) and Taras Bulba. We will also examine how Gogol blends history, Gothic elements, and Ukrainian folklore and traditions to create an unique image of Ukraine, which dominated during the 19th century, and how his influential but elusive fiction led to a broad range of re-workings and re-imaginings in fiction, film, and visual arts. We will pay a special attention to Taras Bulba, a controversial epic tale and Gogol’s only experiment in historical fiction, which narrates the story of Cossacks and their struggle for preserving their independence, shifting the patriotic burden from Ukrainian to proto-Russian.\n\nIsaac Babel achieved a wide-ranging reputation as a grand master of the short story. Odessa Stories are united by the protagonists, the narrator, and of course the setting – Odessa – the southern commercial port on the Black Sea and the most cosmopolitan city in the Russian empire. The stories present a larger than life, subtly humorous, fable-like picture of the city’s Jewish underworld. We will compare Babel’s film script called Benya Krik, based on the story cycle, with the stories. In Odessa Stories, the action takes place in 1905 – 1907, and the king of the Odessa gangsters reigns supreme, while the film includes the 1917 Revolution and the Civil War.\n\nWe will finish with Mikhail Bulgakov’s first novel White Guard (1925), which plunges its readers into the chaos of Civil War in 1918 and 1919 in Kyiv. Bulgakov shows events as seen through the eyes of the Russian intellectuals, Ukrainians, and Jews, and contrasts the cruelty and violence of the time with individual acts of humanity and the values of civilization, culture, and family.\n\nI will draw upon my Russian background and knowledge of Ukrainian history and culture to provide participants with a unique chance to appreciate some of the pleasures of the original Russian versions of the works by Gogol, Babel, and Bulgakov that are inevitably lost in any translation. We will take a close look at the use of language, which shifts constantly back and forth between Russian, Ukrainian, and Yiddish, the techniques of narration, and the modes of characterization.\n\nFall 2022\n\nFrom Russian Folk Epics and Holy Fools to Putin’s Propaganda\n\nTaking an analytical approach, we will examine the interaction between the oral tradition of Russian folk epics and written lives of saints and ancient Slavic pagan and more recent Eastern Orthodox Church worldviews, culminating in the study of Eugene Vodolazkin’s contemporary novel Laurus (2012), about a 15th century Russian holy fool, and the examination of how Russian folk epics have been used with a propagandist aim of justifying current Russian state policies. The seminar will emphasize a short lecture followed by group discussion. We will focus on close textual analysis of Russian folk epics, lives of saints, several twentieth century literary narratives written in the folk epic tradition, and Vodolazkin’s Laurus over a period of eight (8) sessions, supplemented by historical and critical information introduced by at each meeting. During the sessions, several short episodes (not longer than 10 – 15 minutes each) will be shown from Russian movies, short animations based on folk epics, and propaganda clips.\n\nRussian medieval narratives, both ecclesiastic and folk, often accommodate miracles and the supernatural. The medieval genres did not know the distinction between fiction and non-fiction, only between entertainment (profane stories) and edification (sacred stories). During the course, we will explore how the revelatory, didactic, transfigurative saint’s life is not all that distinct from the folk epic, bylina, where the epic hero, bogatyr, is part warrior, part saint, part superman, and, at some moments, a fool. A bylina was chanted rhythmically, which is reflected in its formulaic structure, and governed not by plot suspense but by descriptive detail and texture. A bylina cycle was organized around a historic city, Kyiv or Novgorod. Like the world’s famous heroic epics (Beowulf or The Iliad), bylinas contribute to a sense of national identity by anchoring the adventures of national heroes in a geographical and historical reality. However, bylinas create an imaginary, golden-age medieval past in which epic heroes are always able to defeat evil dragons or the adversaries of a later day (the Mongols).\n\nWe will discuss how, in times of the cultural unrest, adaptations of canonical tales help a society to redefine and reinvent itself. Soviet Russia elaborated a very special relationship to fantasy and wonderland, characterized by the slogan: “We were born to make fairy tales come true!” During Stalin’s time, the bogatyrs were artificially transplanted into a new Soviet folklore called novinas (new folk epics), fighting against tsars Alexander III, Nicholas II, and the White army during the Russian civil war. We will turn to the tales, films, and animations of folk epics of Soviet and post-Soviet Russia to understand the changes in national identity, cultural values, and what it means to be Russian.\n\nA sacred realm requires saints and ethical teaching. Hagiography flatters the local culture but also de-historicizes the saints, presenting them in direct line with early Christian martyrs. For this reason, similar to the folk epics, it is difficult and sometimes impossible to disentangle historical reality from the idealized spiritual portrait. Holy fools, or fools for Christ, who lived outside institutions and were persecuted as freaks, are widely attested in Russian religious and literary narratives. Holy fools acted the fools to challenge received norms and earthly authority models. Eugene Vodolazkin adapted this idiom and the tropes of medieval chronicle and hagiographic writing in his novel Laurus. His account of the 15th century healer, selflessly devoted to others, presents a rich cast of characters and the world of medieval Russia.\n\nThroughout the course, we will examine how the folk epics and holy fools are exploited as propaganda tools in Putin’s Russia to justify exaggerated nationalism, exceptionality of Russian historical development, and explain the war against Ukraine. Putin’s propaganda campaign promotes an invented version of Russia’s history, not all that different from what we see in the magical world of Russian folk epics and holy fools. Putin is presented as a guarantor of stability (as opposed to the chaos of the 1990s) and a bogatyr, capable of restoring Russia as a nation-state and making Russian citizens aware of their mission in the world to defeat the Western way of development and “liberate” those former Soviet neighbors who submitted to the West.\n\nReading List and Handouts: I will provide all reading materials which are not part of the required text list, along with supplemental handouts, through the Canvas LMS classroom specially developed for the seminar. Access to all the handouts and a wealth of optional readings and online resources is easy to navigate even for those with very limited computer skills.\n\nSummer 2022\n\nMikhail Vrubel: Fusion of Art and Literature\n\nMikhail Vrubel (1856-1910), a genius of fin-de-siècle Russian art, interweaves beauty and treachery, capturing disorientation and the threatening nature of the modern world in the manner of the Symbolist and Art Nouveau artists. Our seminar will follow the structure of the recent Vrubel retrospective at the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow as a network of evolving interlinked motifs to showcase the development of his stunning crystalline technique and his inspiration in folk tradition and literature. Works by Lermontov, Pushkin, Gogol, and Blok will be discussed alongside Vrubel’s art.\n\nMikhail Vrubel’s career both coincided with and further propelled Symbolism, a new and all-encompassing philosophical and aesthetic movement, along with its stylistic offshoot, Art Nouveau or style moderne, which was intertwined in Russia with a national revival movement. During this course, over a period of 5 meetings, we will engage in exploration of Vrubel’s art during the Silver Age of Russian culture (1890-1914), which brought a burst of creativity in visual, literary, and performing arts. Vrubel’s art draws on literature and folk tradition, uniting fragmented myths and archetypal themes into a coherent vision. We will examine Vrubel’s work alongside the Russian folk epics and the tales of Nikolai Gogol and Alexander Pushkin, “The Demon” by Mikhail Lermontov, and poems by Alexander Blok and Valery Bryusov. The seminar will include both presentations and group discussions. Our discussions will be supplemented by historical, visual, and critical information introduced at each meeting.\n\nMikhail Vrubel is a unique figure in the history of Russian art. Despite his academic training, he rejected pure figuration and didactic narrative painting, creating his own vocabulary, while experimenting with the fragmentation of volumes into faceted planes. Largely misunderstood and unappreciated during his time by a public more comfortable with Realistic paintings, it was he, rather than any other artist of this period, who is now considered the first Russian Modernist and who had a decisive influence on the direction art would take in the next generation of Russian artists, including Vasily Kandinsky and Kazemir Malevich. Naum Gabo, a sculptor and key figure in Russia’s post-revolution avant-garde, wrote in 1959 about Vrubel, regretting that the Western world is unaware of Vrubel: “His genius is responsible for molding the visual consciousness of our generation, which came after him… Vrubel freed the arts of painting and sculpture from the academic schemata. He revived the concept in visual art that the fundamental visual elements are of decisive importance in the creation of a pictorial or plastic image; and, in that respect, his influence on us was as decisive as Cezanne’s… Even Cubism was not entirely a surprise to us.”\n\nVrubel has been often compared to van Gogh and Gustav Klimt: the painted texture, colors, and the form of his brushwork were self-sufficient for him; his paintings seem to breathe and live on their own. Vrubel, like so many of his international contemporaries, sought to dissolve the material world into fluid flights of imagination and invention, operating on the very edge of reality. Vrubel had a passion for line and color: for an almost geometrical pictorial arrangement in which his crystalline, fractured brushstrokes transform pigment into patches of color that float in a dense sea of paint. Similar to European Art Nouveau practitioners, Vrubel moved interchangeably between the “high art” of painting and figurative sculpture and “low art,” collaborating on theater and costume design, interior decoration, architecture, and experimental majolica, and fulfilling commissions for large mural panels, fireplaces, and smaller objects, blurring the boundaries between different categories of art.\n\nThe seminar will be structured not chronologically; insead it will reflect the concept of design thinking. Vrubel continued to explore a particular idea for as long as he needed, sometimes even throughout his life, no matter what the terms of the commission were, or what media was used, creating cycles or series of works. Defining the recurring motifs of Vrubel’s oeuvre will help the seminar participants discover the connections with the works of Russian literature and folk tradition, which indicate the origin and direction of Vrubel’s creative impulses. For example, we will consider the three major paintings of the Demon, “Demon Seated” (1890), “Demon Flying” (1899), and “Demon Downcast” (1902), together with Vrubel’s illustrations for Mikhail Lermontov’s poem “The Demon” (1890-1891) and a plaster sculpture “Demon’s Head” (1894). Although Vrubel’s Demon series reveals different manifestations of the image and different ways of seeing it, all Demons are simultaneously inextricably connected and in conflict with one another, creating a music suite or a single work. Similarly, Vrubel’s painting “Parting of the Sea King and Princess Volkhova” (1898) coils and turns into the decorative ceramic platter “Sadko” (1899). In turn, a few years later, Vrubel returns to the music of the sea, the oval composition, and metallic, iridescent colors in “The Pearl” series (1904) in drawing, charcoal, watercolor, and pastel.\n\nI was fortunate to spend December of 2021 in Russia, attending a major exhibition of Mikhail Vrubel at the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow (November 2021 – March 2022), which featured over 300 works from 14 Russian and foreign museums and 8 private collections. I interviewed the curator of the exhibition, Irina Shumanova, and will share her insights, impressions, and photographs she took, as well as excerpts from research articles in the extensive exhibition catalogue. I will draw upon my Russian background to provide a unique opportunity to appreciate some of the pleasures of the original Russian versions of poems and tales we will be reading that are inevitably lost in any translation.\n\nWinter/Spring 2022\n\nPolemics on Nihilism: Dostoevsky’s The Devils and J. M. Coetzee’s The Master of Petersburg\n\nFor our first seminar of 2022, we will read and discuss The Devils (1872) in conjunction with J. M. Coetzee’s novel The Master of Petersburg (1994), which is strongly based on “At Tikhon’s,” a chapter written by Dostoevsky for The Devils but suppressed by his editor Katkov. The seminar will emphasize group discussion. We will focus on close textual analysis of Dostoevsky’s The Devils and J. M. Coetzee’s The Master of Petersburg over a period of 9 sessions, supplemented by biographical, historical, and critical information related to the novels that I will present at each meeting.\n\nDostoevsky’s fiction captures the fluidity and instability of existence as experienced by most in any age. We will address these important questions during our discussions: Why do we still read Dostoevsky and why should we continue to read him if The Devils is so ambiguous? Is The Devils only a pamphlet against Russian radicals and terrorists? How do we link J. M. Coetzee’s postmodernist The Master of Petersburg to Dostoevsky’s most political and philosophically and narratively sophisticated novels?\n\nThe Devils is one of Dostoevsky’s four major novels and the most openly political of his works. Although it is sometimes regarded as Dostoevsky’s ill-tempered departure into political satire, we will discover that in fact it was a natural and significant stage in the organic process of his spiritual, ideological, and artistic evolution. Ivan Turgenev was the first writer to use the term “nihilism” in his novel Fathers and Sons (1862), where he offered a penetrating portrait of the new generation of the radicals of 1860s. After we learn more about the revolutionary movement in Russia from 1840s to 1870s, we will be able to discern Dostoevsky’s biting indictment of socialism and the revolutionary movement as a manifestation of the moral cynicism of secular culture. Dostoevsky combined the real-life Nechaev case of 1869-1870, the student uprisings, terrorist attacks, and his own beliefs in order to create the central plot of The Devils. We will also explore the tricky literary structure of The Devils, which veers back and forth from first to third person. One of the most fascinating devices that Dostoevsky employs is the use of the chronicler instead of the narrator, who is both a character in the novel and a special version of an authorial mode and whose trustworthiness is compromised by his closeness to the action and his intellectual limitations.\n\nWe will return to Dostoevsky and Nechaev, who are the main characters in J. M. Coetzee’s novel of ideas The Master of Petersburg. J. M. Coetzee is not only a Nobel Prize winner in literature, but a literary scholar who wrote extensively on Dostoevsky. In this complex fiction, he draws on the life of Dostoevsky, the history of Russia, and the death of his own son at 23. Exploring Dostoevsky’s identity as a writer and the sinister atmosphere in Petersburg in 1870s, J. M. Coetzee links language and power, producing a dense and courageous meditation on authority and rebellion, art and imagination.\n\nDrawing upon my Russian background, I hope to provide a unique perspective on some of the pleasures of the original Russian version of The Devils that are inevitably lost in any translation. We will look closely, for example, at the translation of the title of the novel, which is known by several names, including The Possessed and The Demons. I will introduce Dostoevsky’s notebooks for The Devils, which will provide a coherent account of the novel’s complex evolution. I conducted an in-depth, month-long, on-site study of Dostoevsky in Petersburg, Russia, in summer 2007, the high points of which I will present to the seminar participants during the discussions.\n\nFall 2021\n\nMikhail Bulgakov: Early Satire and The Master and Margarita\n\nMikhail Bulgakov (1891 – 1940) is a master of Soviet literature whose unique inventiveness and bold imagination were to influence profoundly the subsequent development of ‘magic realism’ in the West. We will focus on close textual analysis of Bulgakov’s satirical sketches, The Fatal Eggs, Heart of a Dog, and The Master and Margarita, supplemented by biographical, historical, and critical information related to the writings that I will present at each session. During the sessions, several short episodes (not longer than 10 – 15 minutes each) will be shown from the movies The Master and Margarita (Russia, 1994 and 2005) and The Heart of a Dog (Russia, 1988).\n\nMikhail Bulgakov is now widely acknowledged as a giant of the 20th century Russian literature, ranking with Pasternak, Solzhenitsyn, Mandelstam, Akhmatova, and Brodsky. His story, though, is particularly unusual, for he was scarcely published at all in his own lifetime, in Russia or in the West, and his plays reached the stage only with great difficulty. We will explore the Moscow period of Bulgakov’s life when most of his masterpieces were written, including two of his satirical novellas from the 1920s The Fatal Eggs and Heart of a Dog. Both of them are hilarious and brilliantly inventive and at the same time serve as biting political allegories and science fiction. We will explore their ferocious satire, which is as timely as when they were first written.\n\nBulgakov’s masterpiece, The Master and Margarita, was written in the 1930s in complete secrecy. Finally published in 1967, it took the Russian public by storm and has since become a world-wide bestseller, literary classic, and a cult novel. The novel is an extraordinary blend of comic satire, set in the Moscow of the 1930s, demonic pranks, and a profound investigation of the nature of good and evil through an intense retelling of the encounter between Christ and Pontius Pilate. The puzzling plot includes an elegant Devil who is working for the forces of the good; a love story; and an account of the artistic integrity of its writer-hero, the Master. Together we will address important questions: Why do we read Bulgakov and what makes his satire so unsettling even nowadays? How should we understand and interpret the Satanic Woland? To what extent is Bulgakov’s fiction political? What is the nature of his art, and how does it influence other writers?\n\nI will draw upon my Russian background to provide participants with a unique chance to appreciate some of the pleasures of the original Russian versions of the works of Bulgakov that are inevitably lost in any translation. Among the most distinctive components of Bulgakov’s art that we will examine are the representation of space and time, the use of language, the techniques of narration, and the modes of characterization. The seminar leader will introduce the participants to some of Bulgakov’s letters and diaries that provide a context for his literary career during one of the most turbulent periods in Russian history.\n\nNOTE: Supplemental handouts will be provided through a Canvas LMS online classroom specially developed and moderated for the seminar. Access to all the handouts and a wealth of optional and supplementary readings, an extensive bibliography, visual guides, and online resources are easy to navigate even for those with very limited computer skills. The online classroom specially built for the seminar will remain open for 12 months after the end of the seminar.\n\nSummer 2021\n\nThe Fiction of Pushkin and Lermontov\n\nAlexander Pushkin (1799 – 1837) and Mikhail Lermontov (1814 – 1841), are primarily famous for their poetry but their fiction was to have a tremendous impact on the subsequent development of the Russian novel. We will focus on close textual analysis of Pushkin’s and Lermontov’s fiction over a period of six (6) meetings, supplemented by biographical, historical, and critical information related to the writings presented at each meeting. The seminar will include both presentations and group discussion. During the sessions, several short episodes (not longer than 10 – 15 minutes each) will be shown from the movies The Blizzard (Russia, 1964), The Undertaker (Russia, 1972) and The Queen of Spades (a number of adaptations) and A Hero of Our Time (Russia, 1965 and 2007).\n\nAlexander Pushkin, the greatest poet in Russia, did not turn to prose until the end of the 1820s, but the fiction he wrote in the last decade of his life created a national literature and laid the foundation on which that national literature would be built further. The simplicity and natural straightforward grace of his prose perfectly expressed the Russian mood and succeeded in setting the tone for future generations of Russian writers. We will read Pushkin’s short masterpieces, written between 1827 and 1836, The Moor of Peter the Great, Egyptian Nights, The Tales of Belkin, The Captain’s Daughter, and The Queen of Spades and will address important questions: Why do we read Pushkin? Does Pushkin’s prose stem out of poetry? What is the nature of his art and how does it influence other writers? We will compare The Queen of Spades with Henry James’s short novella The Aspern Papers (1888) and examine the dense intertextual relations between these ambiguous masterpieces.\n\nMikhail Lermontov’s poetry, written just after the failure of the Decembrist revolt of 1825, displays a more explicit indignation and a heavier despair than Pushkin expressed. His work of profoundest effect was, however, a prose novel A Hero of Our Time (1840), which is one of the great landmarks of Russian nineteenth-century prose. It set the aesthetic, psychological, and sociological precedent on which subsequent writers of the Russian psychological realism, such as Turgenev, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and Chekhov, would draw. A Hero of Our Time has a unique and complex structure which has defied imitation. We will explore this novel, skillfully wrought out of five interlinking stories that are held together by a bitter, reflective hero, Pechorin, who is at odds with society, and by an ingeniously contrived and enigmatic narrator who tours the Caucasus during the 1830s.\n\nWe will see that the achievements of Pushkin and Lermontov are more than national: the universality of their vision, the ability to transmute what they saw and understood into language of utmost purity have created for them a permanent place in world literature. I hope to provide participants with a unique chance to appreciate some of the pleasures of the original Russian versions of the works of Pushkin and Lermontov that are inevitably lost in any translation by reading a few of the most famous poems by Pushkin and Lermontov in Russian. We will read and compare several translations of these poems as well as to listen to them as songs, with music by Tchaikovsky, Rakhmaninov, and Glinka. During each session, I will integrate the lesser-known tradition of Russian painting by presenting works by Orest Kiprensky, Vasily Tropinin, Karl Briullov, and Alexander Ivanov with the fiction of Pushkin and Lermontov, highlighting both the common ground and the autonomy of the sister arts.\n\nWinter/Spring 2021\n\nRussian Avant-Garde and More: Art and Literature 1910-1932\n\nI invite you to join us online starting in February, 2021, as we examine the major art and literature movements of the time of the Russian avant-garde and the Russian revolution from 1910 to 1932 through the lens of Neo-Primitivism, Cubo-Futurism, Suprematism, Constructivism, Zorved, Unovis, Masters of Analytical Art, OST, Formalism, OBERIU and other groups, as well as the poetry, short stories, tales, and novels by Evgeny Zamyatin, Alexander Blok, Anna Akhmatova, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Osip Mandelstam, Valery Bryusov, Andrey Platonov, and Mikhail Bulgakov. We will focus on close visual analysis of the works by Kazemir Malevich, Alexandra Exter, Marc Chagall, Vasily Kandinsky, Natalia Goncharova, Mikhail Larionov, Pavel Filonov, Vladimir Tatlin, Alexander Rodchenko, Varvara Stepanova, Lyubov Popova, and many other artists, interplayed against the textual analysis of a variety of literary works and two short novels: Evgeny Zamyatin’s We and Andrey Platonov’s The Foundation Pit.\n\nThe beginning of the 20th century brought a period of radical change in literary and artistic culture in Russia. Though dominated by efforts to break with the past and to experiment, many continuities were inescapable. During our discussions, we will try to integrate the different strands of Russian culture often seen as separate, and contrast pre- and post-Soviet art and literature as much as show the similarities between them. The 1910s through the 1920s was a period of tremendous literary diversity despite the gradually increasing attempts of the Communist party – up to about 1932-1934 – to assert control over literature and cinema, while some hope remained that artists and writers might continue to retain a certain freedom. We will observe how in each case, matters of style went hand in hand with the attempts to change the world.\n\nWe will also examine the birth of new forms and poetics that embodied a new Utopian vision of Russia; artists’ responses to and participation in the political, social, scientific, and cultural experimentation of their time; and the survival of creative expression in the midst of unimaginable hardships. How do artists respond to and shape historical events? How did writers in the early 20th Russia transmute fear, anxiety, alienation, violence, and chaos into art? How do Utopian ideas and dreams transform into reality? Though we will move in a rough chronological progression, we will jump ahead or look back when needed, focusing on leaps, bounds, and reversals of the era.\n\nZamyatin’s We (1921) is the first modernist novel in Russia, which could be published in the Soviet Union only in 1988 for the first time. It is set in a future society run on mathematical principles where reason and logic are dominant. Before composing his dystopia, Zamyatin wrote that “life in big cities is like that in factories: it de-individualizes, makes people somehow all the same, machine-like.” We will examine how Zamyatin shows that the powerful machine fantasy which was seizing the revolutionary writers turned human beings into digits.\n\nAndrey Platonov’s The Foundation Pit (1930), first published only in 1994, is set during the rapid industrialization and collectivization and is a kind of hell, or abyss, where both language and labor lost meaning, where nearly every character is alienated against his or her own self, and the acts of violence are seen as the most normal thing in the world. Both novels correlate with the major artists and art movements of their time: Vasily Kandinsky, Kozma Petrov-Vodkin, Olga Rozanova, Kazemir Malevich, and Pavel Filonov.\n\nI will draw on my Russian background to provide participants with a unique chance to appreciate some of the pleasures of the original Russian works that are inevitably lost in any translation. We will look closely, for example, at the semantics of the Russian and Soviet neologisms and abbreviations used so freely in the 1910s-1930s to discover that they may have different meanings and connotations.\n\nI will provide all supplemental handouts for the participants through a Canvas LMS classroom specially developed and moderated for the seminar. I will make access to all the handouts and a wealth of optional and supplementary readings, extensive bibliography, visual guides, and online resources easy to navigate even for those with very limited computer skills. The online classroom specially built for the seminar will remain open for 12 months after the end of the seminar.\n\nFall 2020\n\nFrom Russian Realism to Symbolism: Painting and Literature (1860s – 1910s)\n\nI invite you to join us this fall as we delve into Russian history, thought, and culture in the 1860s – 1910s through the comparative analysis of the representative works from Russian literary and painterly canons. The seminar will emphasize short lectures and group discussions. We will focus on close textual and visual analysis of paintings and stories over a period of seven (7) meetings, supplemented by biographical, historical, cultural, and critical information introduced by the seminar leader at each meeting.\n\nIn 1919 Virginia Woolf wrote that “if the Russians are mentioned one runs the risk of feeling that to write of any fiction save theirs is a waste of time.” While Russian realist novels and short fiction by Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and Chekhov has found a lasting place in the Western cultural canon, by contrast, the 19th century Russian visual arts have not enjoyed the same fate. The painting of Russian realism and symbolism either remains unknown or is looked at with indifference or contempt as being excessively literal and narrative. The situation is quite different in Russia: this spring, the latest large-scale blockbuster exhibition of Ilya Repin (1844–1930) – perhaps Russia’s most popular painter – attracted people from all over Russia and abroad, despite long lines and expensive tickets. Almost half a million people visited the exhibition of Valentin Serov (1865-1911), one of the finest 19th century portrait painters, in 2015-2016, and 600,000 people visited the exhibition of Ivan Aivazovsky (1817-1900), one of the greatest masters of marine arts, in 2016.\n\nBy closely reading and looking at the classics of Russian realism and symbolism, we will explore the emergence and development of the Russian tradition of realism and symbolism in the sister arts, which succeeded in retaining their independence, while remaining close and influencing each other. The Russian realist tradition spans over half a century from the projects of the Natural school in the 1840s to the mature masterpieces of Turgenev, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and the painters of the Wanderers (Peredvizhniki).\n\nRussian realism was always aware of the need to master and match the achievements of Western Europe and then to offer its own original contribution. Realist painting in Russia had even greater obstacles to overcome, including the persistent logocentrism of Russian culture, a tendency of emphasizing reading over looking and word over image that can be traced back to Russian Orthodox iconography. While writers and artists in Russia turned to realism somewhat later, it is in Russia that realism reaches its ultimate potential.\n\nDuring the seminar, we will pay particular attention to questions of genre and medium, the relationship between artists and writers (Tolstoy and Repin; Chekhov and Levitan) and their respective works, audience, readers, and critics, and the development of cultural movements, institutions, and traditions, such as journals, circles, groups, collectors, and museums. We will take up two of the most important emblems of realism – the window and the road. We will start with the Wanderers, the movement born of protest in 1863, focusing on Ivan Kramskoy (1837-1887), Ivan Aivazovsky, Vasily Surikov (1848-1916), Ivan Shishkin (1832-1898), Valentin Serov, and Arkhip Kuindzhi (1842-1910). Looking at a variety of paintings by Repin and reading Tolstoy’s stories will help us understand the highest achievements and limits and limitations of realism.\n\nNext, we will focus on the work of Chekhov and Bunin and will turn to Symbolism and its body of ideas: the denial of the world of appearances, the transcending of established social and moral codes, and the emphasis on the inner spiritual world. We will explore the burst of creativity in visual, literary, and performing arts in fin de siècle Petersburg against the background of social unrest, decadence, and political upheaval, through the stunningly original art of Mikhail Vrubel (1856-1910). Two artistic colonies at Abramtsevo and Talashkino played a major role in the development of Russian modernism and Art Nouveau style based on a creative reworking and synthesis of decorative approach drawn from folk art and early Russian art. Victor Vasnetsov (1848-1926) was an artist whose art engaged with many themes from Russian history, legends and fairy tales. The artist Elena Polenova (1850-1898) became the artistic director of the carpentry workshop at Abramtsevo, in addition to being a painter and book illustrator.\n\nI will draw upon my Russian background to provide the participants with a unique chance to appreciate some of the pleasures of the original Russian versions of the stories that are inevitably lost in any translation. For example, we will examine the term “Wanderers” (Peredvizhniki is Russian from the verb “to travel, move about”) as misleading with its connotation of aimlessness. I will also help everyone to navigate a wealth of Internet resources on Russian realist and symbolist painting and artists, as well as museums and exhibitions.\n\nNOTE: I will provide all supplementing handouts for the participants through a Canvas LMS classroom specially developed and moderated for the seminar. Access to all the handouts and a wealth of optional and supplementary readings, extensive bibliography, visual guides, and online resources are easy to navigate even for those with very limited computer skills. The online classroom specially built for the seminar will remain open for 6 months after it ends.\n\nSummer 2020\n\nSt. Petersburg in the Russian Silver Age\n\nPlease join us online this summer as we engage in exploring the burst of creativity in visual, literary, and performing arts in fin de siècle St. Petersburg (1890-1914) against a background of social unrest, decadence, and political upheaval.\n\nBuilt at the edge of an enormous empire by Peter the Great at the start of the 18th century, Petersburg was designed to display the emperor’s power to his subjects and to the world. Called “The Venice of the North,” its straight, wide streets, reflecting in the canals, are lined with beautiful pastel-colored palaces, built by nobles whom Peter forced to move there. However, St. Petersburg was never only a physical city. From the moment it was founded, this city was always a “cultural phenomenon,” a “metaphysical space,” a “myth,” and a “text.” Even the most abstract representations of the city were shaped out of its streets, buildings, people, wind, and fog.\n\nPushkin, Gogol, and Dostoevsky were the first to create a world-famous literary tradition, the “Petersburg myth,” which in the Silver Age was further developed by Andrei Bely, Zinaida Gippius, Dmitry Merezhkovsky, Alexander Blok, Fyodor Sologub, Nadezhda Teffi, Anna Akhmatova, Nikolai Gumilyov, Osip Mandelstam, and Vladimir Mayakovsky in literature; Sergei Diaghilev, Anna Pavlova, Vatslav Nijinsky, and Mikhail Fokine in ballet; Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Prokofiev, and Alexander Scriabin in music; Alexander Benois, Leon Bakst, Konstantin Somov, Vasily Kandinsky, Elena Guro, Mikhail Vrubel, Kazimir Malevich, Anna Ostroumova-Lebedeva, and Mstislav Dobuzhinsky in art. We will examine the picture of Russian culture in this period, showing how closely related the arts became around the 1900s. Several major poets were musicians and composers; others were painters, important literary critics, religious thinkers, or philosophers.\n\nSt. Petersburg at the turn of the 19th century was the empire’s political capital and its most populous and developed city. Approached from diverse perspectives (as a myth, text, historical urban metropolis, a metaphor for Russia, an imperial city, the epitome of state bureaucracy, a ‘window onto Europe,’ and the cultural capital), St. Petersburg will also be contrasted to Moscow to examine the fundamental duality that forms the Russian national identity. Imperial Russia’s final decades were a time of possibility and crisis marked by desperate search for the meaning of the present and a sense of the future. Russia’s fin de siècle was more pessimistic and more decadent than in the west: Russians worried that modern progress was only an illusion and a myth, and talked of catastrophic disintegration, decline, sickness, disenchantment, and uncertainty.\n\nI will draw upon my Russian background to provide participants with a unique chance to appreciate some of the pleasures of the original Russian versions of Silver Age poems that are inevitably lost in any translation. I will read some of the most famous poems in Russian, and the participants will have a chance to read and compare several translations of the same poems as well as to listen to them as songs. Translating poetry is never a simple thing, and Russian and English poetry offer a special case for the study of translation because of the difference in historical development and prosodic structures.\n\nThe seminar participants will be guided through the superb website “Mapping Petersburg,” which explores the everyday life and the material, political, and literary culture of St. Petersburg at the beginning of the twentieth century. The website was created under the guidance of Professor Olga Matich, University of California at Berkeley.\n\nNOTE: Supplemental documents specially developed for the seminar will be made available to all participants through the Canvas LMS classroom.\n\nSpring 2020\n\nRussian Realist Painting and Literature (1840s – 1890s)\n\nImportant, please read: The Newberry will be closing its doors to the public on March 13, 2020. My seminar, Russian Realist Painting and Literature (1840s – 1890s), has been cancelled as of March 13.\n\nThe Newberry is offering refunds on a prorated basis for the cancelled sessions. Refunds will be processed the week of March 23, 2020.\n\nThe Russian Realism Canvas classroom will remain open to all of you who registered for the class until I have a chance to teach the seminar again. The Newberry has offered the opportunity to hold the seminar again in a future term. Thank you for your patience and I hope to see you in the near future.\n\nJulia Denne\n\nIn 1919 Virginia Woolf wrote that “if the Russians are mentioned one runs the risk of feeling that to write of any fiction save theirs is a waste of time.” While Russian realist novels and short fiction by Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and Turgenev has found a lasting place in the Western cultural canon, by contrast, the 19th century Russian visual arts have not enjoyed the same fate. The painting of Russian realism either remains unknown or is looked at with indifference or contempt, as being excessively literal and narrative. The situation is quite different in Russia: in spring of 2019, the latest large-scale, blockbuster exhibition of Ilya Repin (1844–1930), perhaps Russia’s most popular painter, spanned three floors in the largest exhibition halls of the Tretyakov Gallery, and attracted people from all over Russia and abroad, despite long lines and expensive tickets. The exhibition continues through the beginning of March of 2020 at The State Russian Museum in St. Petersburg, and travels to Helsinki and Paris next, showing the new interest in the riches of the Russian realist tradition. Almost half a million people visited the exhibition of Valentin Serov (1865-1911), one of the finest 19th century portrait painters, in 2015-2016, and 600,000 people visited the exhibition of Ivan Aivazovsky (1817-1900), one of the greatest masters of marine arts, in 2016.\n\nThe Russian realist tradition spans over half a century from the projects of the Natural school in the 1840s to the mature masterpieces of Turgenev, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and the painters of the Wanderers (Peredvizhniki). By closely reading and looking at the classics of Russian realism, we will explore the emergence and development of the Russian tradition of realism in the sister arts, which succeeded in retaining their independence, while remaining close and influencing each other. Russian realism was always aware of the need to master and match the achievements of Western Europe and then to offer its own original contribution. Realist painting in Russia had even greater obstacles to overcome, including the persistent logocentrism of Russian culture, a tendency of privileging reading over looking and word over image that can be traced back to Russian Orthodox iconography. While writers and artists in Russia turned to realism somewhat later, it is in Russia that realism reaches its ultimate potential.\n\nDuring the seminar, we will pay particular attention to questions of genre and medium, the relationship between artists and writers (Tolstoy and Repin; Turgenev and Perov) and their respective works, audience, readers, and critics, and the development of cultural movements, institutions, and traditions, such as journals, circles, groups, collectors, and museums. We will take up two of the most important emblems of realism – the window and the road. Peeking through the windows allows artists and writers of the Natural school to access the previously invisible poor corners of the city, especially in the urban sketches of The Physiology of Petersburg (1845) and the genre paintings of Pavel Fedotov (1815-1852). We will move to the complexity of the road to compare Ivan Turgenev’s A Sportsman’s Sketches (1852) and Vasily Perov’s (1834-1882) critically acclaimed paintings. We will next explore the Wanderers, the movement born of protest in 1863, focusing on Ivan Kramskoy (1837-1887), Ivan Aivazovsky, Vasily Surikov (1848-1916), Ivan Shishkin (1832-1898), Valentin Serov, and Arkhip Kuindzhi (1842-1910). Looking at a variety of paintings by Repin and reading Tolstoy’s stories will help us understand the highest achievements and limits and limitations of realism.\n\nI will draw upon my Russian background to share some of the pleasures of the original Russian versions of the stories that are inevitably lost in any translation. For example, we will examine the term “Wanderers” (Peredvizhniki is Russian from the verb “to travel, move about”) as misleading with its connotation of aimlessness. I will also help everyone navigate a wealth of internet resources on Russian realist painting in general, specific painters, and museums and exhibitions.\n\nNOTE: I will provide all readings and supplemental handouts through a Canvas LMS classroom specially developed and moderated for the seminar. Access to all the handouts and a wealth of optional readings, extensive bibliography, visual guides, and online resources is easy to navigate even for those with very limited computer skills. The online classroom specially built for the seminar will remain open for 6 months after it ends.\n\nFall 2019\n\nThe Twelve Chairs and The Little Golden Calf by Ilf and Petrov as a Panorama of Soviet Life in the 1920s\n\nIlya Ilf (1897-1937) and Evgeny Petrov (1903-1942) are the best-loved humorists in the history of Russian literature. Vladimir Nabokov, a great aesthete who held a disdainful opinion of his “brothers of the pen,” especially those in the Soviet Union, called Ilf and Petrov “joint authors of genius” and included them among “such marvelous humorists as Gogol, Dostoevsky, and Chekhov.” An ethnic Russian writer (Petrov) and an ethnic Jewish writer (Ilf) worked together successfully for many years, and one early pseudonym they used was “Tolstoevsky.” They created the most charming Soviet trickster of all, Ostap Bender, the protagonist of The Twelve Chairs (1928) and The Little Golden Calf (journal publication 1931; amended book edition 1934), which became instant classics and an inexhaustible source of witticisms. Both novels were an instant and universal hit, and enjoy immense popularity to this day: since 2000, more than a dozen reprints have been run in the millions, and Dictionary of Modern Quotations contains 171 phrases from the two novels.\n\nDuring the seminar we will observe how both novels create a grotesque panorama of the everyday Soviet world. The novels will help us uncover the comical disjunction and contradictions between personal and social identity, between face and mask. The interplay between the characters’ social roles and identity takes place against the backdrop of the official spectacle of socialism, NEP (the New Economic Policy), and the unofficial economy of non-monetary exchange, social networking, and doublespeak. We will read the novels as a chronicle of the romantic events of those years (polar expeditions, the cultivation of the desert, the Turkish-Siberian Railroad, the first Five-Year Plan, and the construction of a new everyday life) and as one of the most vivid satires on the current state of affairs (the end of NEP, communal apartments, mass purges of the Soviet civil service, “former people,” con artists, bureaucrats, and hacks). We will compile the assortment of “typical” attributes to allow us to recognize both the era as a whole and the specific years in which the novels take place.\n\nWe will examine the character of Ostap Bender, a charming individualist, a con artist, an imposter, and a picaresque trickster, who fills the novels with his own alternative and unorthodox ideology, appearing as the sole free character in the entire Soviet universe. His juggling of masks, his disdain for all things Soviet (“Building socialism bores me”), and his refusal to engage with the collective utopia testify to his artistic and intellectual superiority. Bender has an ability to assume a variety of roles with aplomb and get himself out of trouble by improvising, but above all, his great talent is to “speak Bolshevik” with total assurance and linguistic fluency to convince gullible provincials or to feign the role of a Soviet official. During the seminar, we will examine several real-life con-men as social commentators of the Soviet society in the 1920. We will also explore how millions of people after the Bolshevik revolution had to reinvent their identities, which strongly focused on their social class.\n\nI will make an in-depth presentation about Ilf and Petrov’s two-month long car journey through Depression-era America in 1935. The satirists recorded their impressions with humorous essays and Ilf’s Leica camera; later on, they published the book Single-Storied America filled with wry observations, biting opinions, and telling photographs. The seminar participants will read excerpts from the travelogue, which produces a nuanced picture of 1930s America, becoming an essential document within the tradition of foreigners documenting their travels through America.\n\nDrawing upon my Russian background, I hope to provide an appreciation of some of the pleasures of the original Russian versions of the novels that are inevitably lost in any translation. Ilf and Petrov’s duo has no equal in Russian literature of the 20th century in terms of the influence on everyday speech. Individual phrases, expressions, and rejoinders became the cultural treasures and classic quotes such as “Maybe I should also give you the key to the room where I keep my money?” as a cliché rebuke for unreasonable requests, or “Going abroad is the myth of life after death. Whoever ends up on the other side never comes back.” Translation matters, and we will read several episodes in two or more different translations. Ilf and Petrov’s magnificent humor and original wit shine through every phrase, and we will examine how different translators reproduce the funniness and the social milieu of the novels.\n\nThe seminar will emphasize group discussion. We will focus on close textual analysis of two novels over a period of 9 meetings, supplemented by biographical, historical, cultural, and critical information related to the novels and introduced by the seminar leader at each meeting. During the sessions, several short episodes (not longer than 10 – 15 minutes each) will be shown from Russian movies based on the novels or connected to the novels.\n\nNOTE: I will provide all supplemental handouts for the participants through a Canvas LMS classroom specially developed and moderated for the seminar. You will have access to all the handouts and a wealth of optional and supplementary readings, extensive bibliography, visual guides, and online resources that are easy to navigate (even for those with very limited computer skills!) The online classroom specially built for the seminar will remain open for 6 months after it ends.\n\nSummer 2019\n\nGogol’s Comedies: The Gamblers, Marriage, and The Government Inspector\n\nThis summer at the Newberry we will read and discuss three comedies of Nikolai Gogol (1809 – 1852), The Gamblers, Marriage, and The Government Inspector. Gogol is a supreme playwright whose comedies – the funniest in the Russian language – were to have a tremendous impact on the subsequent development of Russian theater. One of the most gifted and enigmatic great writers, at various times he has been read as a realist, a symbolist, a fantasist, a comedian, a satirist, and a tragedian. The force and originality of his imagination influenced many generations of writers. The universality of his vision and his ability to depict a society dominated by petty bureaucracy and base corruption and transmute what he saw and understood into language of the utmost originality, combining the fantastic, the satiric, the realistic, and the grotesque with the romantic and the tragic, have created for him a permanent place in world literature.\n\nGogol’s three completed plays are as important as his novel and short stories and are as carefully crafted. Vladimir Nabokov regards The Government Inspector as the greatest play in the Russian language: “Gogol’s play is poetry in action, and by poetry, I mean the mysteries of the irrational as perceived through rational words.” We will examine the Russian theater traditions before Gogol: the theater was neoclassical in manner, aristocratic in temper, and pedagogical in purpose. Gogol was an adventurous innovator: he purged his comedies of the customary love story. The Gamblers has no love scenes at all, and in Marriage and The Government Inspector the lovers fail to get together. Gogol’s greatest innovation for his time was to write a comedy where all characters are ridiculous, resulting in a comic universe with no stable center of conventional dichotomy of virtue and vice, reasonableness and unreasonableness.\n\nDuring the seminar, we will explore the history of productions of Gogol’s plays in Russia, especially The Government Inspector, Gogol’s masterpiece and the central focus of our study. The productions range from realistic to impressionistic to symbolist to futurist. Watching episodes from different productions, we will be able to experience two Gogols: the realist ethnographer and the fantastic, grotesque poet.\n\nThe seminar will include both presentations by the leader and group discussion. We will focus on close textual analysis of Gogol’s plays over a period of four meetings, supplemented by biographical, historical, and critical information related to the writings at each meeting. I will draw upon my Russian background to provide participants with a unique chance to appreciate some of the pleasures of the original Russian versions of Gogol’s comedies that are inevitably lost in translation, including the meaning of the characters’ names. Translation matters, and we will read several scenes in two or more different translations. Gogol’s magnificent humor and bizarre and original wit shine through every phrase, and we will examine how different translators reproduce the funniness of the plays.\n\nSpring 2019\n\nGogol’s Dead Souls\n\nAt the Newberry this spring, I look forward to five sessions of lively discussion as we read and analyze Dead Souls (1842), Gogol’s unfinished, comic masterpiece about a con man and his adventures in provincial Russia. The novel had a tremendous impact on the subsequent development of Russian literature, and during the seminar, we will explore different readings of it: as social commentary on a society founded on serfdom; as a brilliant phantasmagoria; a verbal performance; and as a surrealistic fantasy that anticipated 20th century experimental prose. At each meeting I will present biographical, historical, and critical information related to the novel and our author, and short episodes (not longer than 10 – 15 minutes each) will be shown from the Russian film adaptation of Dead Souls (Shveitser, 1984) with English subtitles.\n\nNikolai Gogol (1809 – 1852) is one of the most gifted and enigmatic great writers, who at various times has been read as a realist, a symbolist, a fantasist, a comedian, a satirist, and a tragedian. From the very beginning, the title Dead Souls has been a stumbling block and a touchstone: on the one hand, before 1861 serfs were sometimes referred to as “souls”, especially when being counted for tax purposes. On the other hand, the first censor had a point when he reacted violently to the mocking challenge of Gogol’s title: “No, this I will never permit: the soul is immortal; there can’t be such a thing as a dead soul, the author is taking a stand against immortality!”\n\nAt the center of Dead Souls, the shrewd scoundrel Chichikov sets out on a journey to buy dead serfs, or souls, so that he can present them as living serfs as collateral against a bank loan, settle in a far province, and establish himself as a respectable country gentleman. The novel is organized and dominated by the road. It begins with an arrival and ends with a departure; its concluding lines are a panegyric to a road. We will see that the road in Dead Souls involves all the varieties of space: from boundlessness to fragmentation to domesticity, providing several layers of the narrative.\n\nWe will examine the creative process of Gogol’s work on Dead Souls. The world that unfolds before us looks on first encounter to be solid and stable. Yet it is both familiar and strange, and Gogol often seeks to destabilize it. We will explore the ways in which disruption and disorder become the source of a peculiar vitality of Dead Souls. The plot is generated by the chance disruptions of Chichikov’s plan, who is most free when he is mobile and changeable. What time of the year it could be when the peasant men sit in sheepskin coats and comment on a snowstorm, while peasant women are up to their knees in the pond?\n\nTogether we will address important questions: How should we understand and interpret Dead Souls? Why did Gogol consider Dead Souls a poem? Is it a parable? What is the nature of Gogol’s artistry, and how does it influence other writers? Is the novel totally irrational or deeply moralistic? Is it a merciless and hilarious satire of Russian society, or criticism of serfdom? Is it an indirect exploration of religious ideas? Or is Dead Souls primarily a verbal innovation and a joke? Why was Gogol unable to complete Part II, on which he had worked for a decade?\n\nSpecial attention will be drawn to the importance of the visual arts in Gogol’s Dead Souls. Gogol thinks in images, and Dead Souls attracted the attention of various artists, including Marc Chagall. We will explore Chagall’s distorted, diagonal scenes with his characteristic top angle view, which evokes a sense of movement and instability, against Gogol’s elusive verbal artistry.\n\nTranslation matters, and we will read several episodes in two or more different translations. Gogol’s magnificent humor and bizarre and original wit shine through every phrase, and we will examine how different translators reproduce the funniness of the book.\n\nNOTE: I will provide all supplemental handouts for the participants through the Canvas LMS classroom, specially developed and moderated for this seminar. Access to all the handouts and a wealth of optional readings and online resources should be easy to navigate even for those with very limited computer skills, and help with using the online classroom will be provided for everyone who requests it.\n\nFall 2018\n\nGogol’s Tales: Icons, Demons, Noses, and Overcoats\n\nThis fall at the Newberry, I hope you will join us to read and discuss the fiction of Nikolai Gogol (1809 – 1852), a supreme master whose fiction was to have a tremendous impact on the subsequent development of Russian literature. We will focus on close textual analysis of Gogol’s Ukrainian and Petersburg tales over a period of nine meetings, supplemented by biographical, historical, and critical information related to the writings. During the sessions, several short episodes (not longer than 10 – 15 minutes each) will be shown from the movies Evenings on a Farm near Dikanka (Russia, 1961), Viy (Russia, 1967 and 2014), and The Overcoat (Russia, 1926, 1959, and parts of Yuri Norshteyn’s unfinished, animated version begun in 1981).\n\nNikolai Gogol is one of the most gifted and enigmatic great writers, who at various times has been read as a realist, a symbolist, a fantasist, a comedian, a satirist, and a tragedian. The force and originality of his imagination influenced many generations of writers. As Dostoevsky is purported to have said, “We have all come out from under Gogol’s Overcoat.” Kafka drew from Gogol’s story The Nose to produce his own Metamorphosis. Andrei Bely called Gogol “the verbal musician, chanting out and drumming out his rhythms.”\n\nWe will begin with short tales from Gogol’s two early collections of Ukrainian tales Evenings on a Farm near Dikanka (Parts I and II) and Mirgorod (“Viy”, “Old World Landowners”, and “The Story of How Ivan Ivanovich Quarreled with Ivan Nikifirovich”). We will continue with his Petersburg masterpieces “Nevsky Prospect”, “The Diary of a Madman”, “The Nose”, “The Portrait”, and “The Overcoat”. Together we will address important questions: Why do we read Gogol? How should we understand and interpret his fiction? What is the nature of his art, and how does it influence other writers? Are Gogol’s tales totally irrational or deeply moralistic?\n\nWe will see that the achievements of Gogol are more than national. The universality of his vision and his ability to depict a society dominated by petty bureaucracy and base corruption and to transmute what he saw and understood into language of the utmost originality combining the fantastic, the satiric, the realistic, and the grotesque with the romantic and the tragic, have created for him a permanent place in world literature.\n\nDrawing upon my Russian background, I hope to give participants an appreciation of some of the pleasures of the original Russian versions of the works of Gogol that are inevitably lost in any translation. Among the most distinctive components of Gogol’s art, we will take a close look at the representation of space and time, the use of language, the techniques of narration, and the modes of characterization.\n\nSpecial attention will be given to the importance of the visual arts in Gogol’s Ukrainian and Petersburg tales. Gogol thinks in images and incorporates Orthodox iconography, revealing its hostility to the literary narrative and the demonic dynamism of the 19th century Ukraine and St. Petersburg. The theme of material animation, where noses and overcoats take on flesh and stroll through the pages of literary Petersburg, will be examined as a marked and well-developed element of Gogol’s narratives and of a larger set of Petersburg texts. We will also examine how Gogol’s influential but elusive fiction led to a broad range of re-workings and re-imaginings in fiction, film, and visual arts.\n\nSummer 2018\n\nSt. Petersburg through Pushkin’s The Bronze Horseman and The Queen of Spades\n\nIn June 2018 at the Newberry we will focus on the interrelation between St. Petersburg and two great works by Alexander Pushkin: the long poem “The Bronze Horseman” and the short novel “The Queen of Spades.” Alexander Pushkin (1799 – 1837) is the most famous Russian poet, and his fiction has had a tremendous impact on the subsequent development of the Russian novel. We will engage in close textual analysis of the two works while exploring the history and geography of Pushkin’s St. Petersburg from the time it was founded in 1703 through the 1830s. Our discussions will be supplemented by biographical, historical, and critical information related to the texts that I will introduce at each meeting. During the sessions, several short episodes (not longer than 10 – 15 minutes each) will be shown from a variety of film adaptations of “The Queen of Spades” and “The Bronze Horseman”. The seminar will include presentations and group discussion during four, two-hour sessions with the opportunity for additional online discussion.\n\nThe course will explore the literary and cultural history of St. Petersburg and its mythology and urban geography as represented in Pushkin’s texts. Participants will be introduced to the concept of the ‘city-text’ and the basics of urban semiotics. Approached from diverse perspectives – as myth; text; historical urban metropolis; a metaphor for Russia; an imperial city; the epitome of state bureaucracy; a ‘window onto Europe;’ and the cultural capital – St. Petersburg will also be contrasted to Moscow to examine the fundamental duality that forms the Russian national identity. Native views on St. Petersburg will be juxtaposed with the foreign perception.\n\nBuilt at the edge of an enormous empire by Peter the Great at the start of the 18th century, Petersburg was designed to display the emperor’s power to his subjects and to the world. Called “The Venice of the North,” its straight, wide streets, reflecting in the canals, are lined with beautiful pastel-colored palaces built by nobles whom Peter forced to move there. Alexander Pushkin was the first Russian writer to create a world-famous literary tradition, the “Petersburg myth,” which was further developed by Gogol, Dostoevsky, Bely, Akhmatova, and Brodsky.\n\nAlexander Pushkin, the greatest poet in Russia and creator of the modern Russian language and literary tradition, spent most of his life in St. Petersburg, which becomes a literary character in his poetry and fiction. The simplicity and natural straightforward grace of Pushkin’s poetry and prose perfectly expresses the Russian mood and succeeds in setting the tone for future generations of Russian writers. As we read Pushkin’s two masterpieces we will address important questions: Why do we read Pushkin? Does Pushkin’s prose stem out of poetry? What is the nature of his art and how does it influence other writers? How did Pushkin’s vision of St. Petersburg influence future generations of writers and inhabitants?\n\n“The Bronze Horseman” describes the building of St. Petersburg in 1703 and the sad fate of one of its poorest citizens, Yevgeny, whose dreams of domestic happiness are shattered by the real-life flood of 1824. Yevgeny’s tragedy is set in a broad context, conveying the political need for a ruler to build such a city and the indomitable power of nature. A triumph of detached narration, “The Queen of Spades” stands at the peak of Pushkin’s achievement as a prose writer. Pushkin presents St. Petersburg as an irrational agent that drives the main character Hermann to madness, as it also does Yevgeny in “The Bronze Horseman”. Pushkin’s vision of St. Petersburg as expressed in these two gems reflects the dynamic and ambiguous image of the city as a cultural space in which various cultural imprints co-exist, with the classical solemn image still very much evolving.\n\nDrawing upon my Russian background, I hope to provide participants with a unique chance to appreciate some of the pleasures of the original Russian versions of Pushkin’s works that are inevitably lost in translation. I will read some of Pushkin’s most famous poems in Russian, and the participants will have a chance to read and compare several translations of these poems as well as to listen to them as songs, with music by Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, and Glinka.\n\nSpring 2018\n\nThe Comedy and Tragedy in Chekhov’s Stories\n\nThis seminar continues a series of two seminars on Chekhov’s short stories at the Newberry from the summer of 2017. (Please join us for part two whether or not you came for part one!) We will read more short stories by Anton Chekhov (1860 – 1904), a master whose technical innovations in short fiction were to profoundly influence the subsequent development of Western literature. We will focus on close textual analysis of Chekhov’s short stories over a period of six meetings, supplemented by biographical, historical, and critical information related to the writings.
