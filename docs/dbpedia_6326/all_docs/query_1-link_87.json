        "text": "In Fear: A Movie Review\n\nMazeophobia, even if you don’t know what it is, you probably have experienced it at least once in your life. It is the fear of getting lost. It is that ominous fluttery feeling in our chests when we realize we’ve taken a wrong turn or ended up in a place we didn’t mean to be. I experienced those feelings of unease and barely held back panic after getting lost driving home from a concert. It was late at night, and I took a wrong turn and ended up on this road that ran through the marshes of coastal Massachusetts. It felt like the longest 15 minutes of my life as I drove through pitch blackness with nothing around me but wetlands. The film In Fear masterfully taps into these emotions.\n\nThe 2013 film, directed by Jeremy Lovering, stars Iain De Caestecker, Alice Englert, and Allen Leech. De Caestecker and Englert portray a couple driving to a motel in the Irish countryside. Although they follow the signs, they can’t find the place; instead, they encounter dead ends or wrong turns that take them in circles. Their situation dissolves into terror when a man in a white mask appears to be stalking the car. More situations arise that only ramp up the unease and tension the couple experiences, but I’ll leave you to discover those for yourself.\n\nOne aspect of the film that stood out is how the car plays multiple roles. Lovering’s direction finds ways to make the car’s interior feel like both a refuge and a trap at various points in the film. In the early part of the movie, the vehicle is driving through narrow roads where the dense forest seems to creep into the space in a gradually suffocating way. During these scenes, the car feels like a safe place. However, after the introduction of Allen Leech’s character, the mood shifts to entrapment for the couple.\n\nOne thing that makes a good movie for me is if I think about it a day or two after watching it. And I have to say, this one stayed with me for a while because of its tense ending. So, if you are bored one day and looking to feel anxious and unsettled, check this movie out. In the end, it will take your breath away.\n\nBad Music for Bad People\n\nLong-time members of the populace here might be surprised to learn that your humble correspondent’s taste in music is not confined to classical and opera. In fact, that frenetic reaction to the horrors of disco that popped up in the late 1970s known as Punk had some considerable appeal to me, at least for a short time. Not nearly all of it; do keep Sturgeon’s Law in mind. But the ten percent that was good was frequently very good.\n\nNot that I found myself anywhere near the nexus of this new music, living as I did in the cultural armpit of all the known universes, a thousand miles away from CBGB and the other venues in New York where this genre thrived. Sure, there were a few punk garage bands around my hometown, but Music City still mainly meant country, so, nope. No Punk for Me! Not live, anyhow, and what recordings trickled down to Tennessee were pretty much blanderized. Ergo, I was not exposed to the topic of today’s little lesson in all things horrific until fairly recently.\n\nOh, well.\n\nErick Lee Purkhiser was born in Toledo, Ohio, in 1946. He grew up blessed with an older brother who introduced him to horror movies and rockabilly, indoctrinating him into the twin cultures he would base his career on. After leaving home for Sacramento in 1972, he picked up a red headed hitchhiker named Kristy Wallace. They wound up getting married and starting a band they called The Cramps.\n\nHe took on the persona of Lux Interior, a name he cadged from a car ad, and she became Poison Ivy Rorschach. They recruited other aspiring musicians to go to New York, where they built a following in the clubs, refined their skills, and upgraded the membership as the opportunities afforded. They even toured the U.K. with The Police.\n\nStill, the 70s were almost over before their sound was put to vinyl, by which time I’d about had it with the comparatively tepid musical fare on the radio and crawled back towards the music of my past. If their records made it down south of the Mason-Dixon Line, I didn’t hear them, at least until many years later.\n\nBut, oh, what a wonderful thing the internet is, for now all of history and culture is at our fingertips, as Youtube has a fair amount of their music. And what wonderful stuff it is! It also carries a pretty good documentary that I heartily recommend. To quote Joe Bob Briggs, “Check it out!”\n\nThey called their peculiar sub-genre psychobilly, a word they took from a Johnny Cash song, a mix of fuzzy-guitared rockabilly and the psychotronic sensibility of the old horror flicks Lux grew up watching. Their albums had names like Creature from the Black Leather Lagoon, How to Make a Monster, Dance of the Cannibals of Sex, and yes, Bad Music for Bad People. The songs were called things like “Human Fly”, “Two Headed Sex Change”, “Eyeball in My Martini”, and “Don’t Eat Stuff Off the Sidewalk”. Makes you want to dust off the old turntable and haunt your local Goodwill for the vintage vinyl, doesn’t it? Or drop some serious coin at Amazon. Whatever. Seek and find, and you’ll thank me the longest day of your life.\n\nWhile you get all that underway, you might want to check out the fourth episode of the Netflix series, Wednesday, starring Jenna Ortega as Wednesday Addams. She goes to the prom and does a rather idiosyncratic dance to the Cramps song “Goo Goo Muck”. Crank that one up to eleven, clear the living room floor and boogie till you puke. It’ll cure what ails ya.\n\nAlas, Lux Interior passed away in 2009 from an aortic dissection, three years after The Cramps gave their last live performance. Poison Ivy lives, as far as I know in retirement, in California. Sic Transit Gloria Mundi.\n\nNext time we collectively pull up a semi-circle of virtual tombstones to discuss the history of our favorite genre, I’ll follow up on a hint I dropped a few posts back and tackle the tormented tale of one of the greatest, and most tragically maltreated by the passage of the subsequent decades old time radio programs, I Love a Mystery. Jack, Doc and Reggie will lead us through realms of adventure, wonder, and fear, or would if more of the episodes had survived the ravages of time. We only have a few complete serialized adventures, a handful of tantalizing pieces of others, and three feature films available for the consumption of modern audiences, but what residual horrors do lie within those remnants I shall reveal in one short fortnight. Until then, I bid you, my dear devotees of derangement, to be afraid…\n\nBe very afraid.\n\nM-G-M Horror Films 1930-1934\n\nWe cycle back again to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the studio with “more stars than there are in the heavens”. The Great Depression was a year old, but you’d never know it in Hollywood. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act hadn’t yet made things so much worse yet. We start 1930 with an Ub Iwerks cartoon. “Who?” you ask. Well, pull up a gravestone and I’ll tell you.\n\nUbbe Ert Iwerks (1901-1971) was the first employee Walt Disney ever hired, and the man who more than anyone, even ol’ Walt, determined what Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters looked like. He animated practically all the Disney cartoons until branching out on his own in 1930 and winding up at M-G-M, at which time he created, among others, Flip the Frog, the star of our first picture.\n\nIn The Cuckoo Murder Case, Flip gets the call when the cuckoo clock’s resident bird gets harvested by the Grim Reaper. Things go about as you’d expect. As in, wacky and chaotic.\n\nMoving on to short subjects we have The Laurel–Hardy Murder Case. At Ollie’s urging, the lads crash the reading of Stan’s uncle’s will in the requisite Old Dark House. Mayhem ensues, of course, as that was Laurel & Hardy’s stock in trade.\n\nAnd now for our feature presentation…\n\nThe Unholy Three was Lon Chaney’s only sound picture, the remake of the 1925 silent film in which he led a gang of crooks while in drag as the owner of a pet shop who cases prospective victims’ homes while delivering fur babies. It breaks one’s heart to see what might have been had he not died so young. Harry Earle returns as Professor Echo’s miniature henchman, while Ivan Linow replaces Victor McLaughlin as his strongman.\n\nThe only entry for 1931 is The Phantom of Paris, an adaptation of a Gaston Leroux novel, Chéri-Bibi et Cécily. John Gilbert is an escape artist convicted of a murder he didn’t commit. How will he get out of this mess? Will the lovely Leila Hyams slip him a hacksaw baked into a cake? Stay tuned!\n\nThe big year for this span of time at M-G-M is 1932, beginning with Freaks. Directed by Tod Browning, who used actual carnival sideshow performers as the title characters. Having spent most of my adult life working on behalf of or directly with folks with disabilities, I kind of struggle to address the overall theme of this movie in any constructive way. It’s an amazing, if disconcerting, film. I will say it features the above-mentioned Harry Earle as the victim of a gold-digger. His friends correct the situation in a markedly brutal fashion when she attempts to accelerate her inheritance of his not inconsiderable worldly goods.\n\nKongo has Walter Huston in the remake of the silent West of Zanzibar, but with more drugs and debauchery than Lon Chaney brought with him to the African jungle. Future Mrs. Tarzan and Mexican Spitfire Lupe Velez co-stars.\n\nFlip the Frog is back in Spooks, taking refuge from a storm in a house inhabited by a variety of skeletal spectres of multiple species.\n\nWarner Oland had made a series of films at Paramount as Sax Rohmer’s yellow-menace supervillain, Fu Manchu, before switching over completely to the equally non-Scandinavian detective, Charlie Chan. In The Mask of Fu Manchu, Boris Karloff takes over the part, with the scrumptious Myrna Loy as his daughter Fah Lo See and future Durango Kid Charles Starrett as the hero out to prevent Fu from finding the tomb of Genghis Khan, which is intended to spark a bloody uprising against all Western interlopers in Asia. Being a big fan of everyone’s right to self-determination, and at the remove of over ninety years, I don’t necessarily disagree with his intentions but I’m not crazy about his methods.\n\nThe final year under consideration in this edition is 1934, which comes complete with a new president in the White House, a New Deal for America, and a new Laurel & Hardy film, The Live Ghost. The lads are hired to shanghai sailors onto a haunted ship, only to be hoisted on their own petards. Finding themselves involuntarily recruited along with their victims, they proceed to wreak their usual brand of havoc on sea as they have so many times on land. The captain ought to have known better.\n\nLooking ahead, I see that our next discussion will have a musical bent, and do I ever mean bent. It’s all about a married couple who spent more than thirty years playing what they called psychobilly music. A definite and no doubt unexpected guilty pleasure for this old classical music buff. Be back here in two weeks for a look at and listen to… The Cramps. Until then, I insist that you will ever and always be afraid…\n\nBe very afraid.\n\nTahoe Joe 2: The Sierra Nevada Bigfoot Conspiracy\n\nReview By PS King\n\nWritten by Dillon Brown and directed by Brown and Michael Rock, Tahoe Joe 2: The\n\nSierra Nevada Bigfoot Conspiracy is an admirable microbudget flick with a lot of heart and a\n\ngood helping of creativity.\n\nA found footage film currently available on the POV Horror app, Tahoe Joe 2 picks up\n\nwhere the last film left off. During their first adventure, Brown and Rock, who play fictionalized\n\nversions of themselves, had a violent run-in with the legendary sasquatch Tahoe Joe. Since\n\nthen, they turned their footage into a documentary (the first Tahoe Joe film), and it went viral. It\n\neven inspired a social media challenge where people film themselves looking for the beast.\n\nWhen a group of three young women take the challenge and only two return, Michael takes it\n\nupon himself to go back into Tahoe Joe’s woods so that he can try to find the missing woman.\n\nBrown and Rock are quite natural actors, which helps greatly with the immersion. Found\n\nfootage flicks live and die based on the performances because they demand a raw realism in\n\nfront of an unforgiving camera. You can tell these two guys are comfortable with each other\n\nbecause their on-screen chemistry is top-notch.\n\nThe supporting actors are believable for the most part, though a few look uncomfortable\n\nin front of the camera. According to Brown, the duo favors casting veterans and first responders\n\nto hiring professional actors, and this is definitely admirable. In fact, it makes the performances\n\nthat much more interesting because, besides being a little stiff, the acting is as good or better\n\nthan many microbudget films employing trained actors.\n\nTahoe Joe 2 is a completely different experience than the original. Which is to say\n\nBrown and Rock have solved the problem of what to do when your first film reveals that bigfoot\n\nexists. You might think the mystery is over, but the direction in which these two men take the\n\nfilm in is quite unexpected. In fact, the film becomes a sort of action / horror hybrid at points. It\n\nwas nice to be taken into such unexpected territory.\n\nBrown and Rock take care not to show off too much of the costume. I’m not sure that\n\nyou can make a very convincing bigfoot costume on any budget, but with a microbudget you\n\nhave to be extra careful about these things. Still, there are points where the camera lingers a\n\nlittle too long. A couple seconds shaved here and there might have done wonders for the\n\nsuspension of disbelief. But, again, we are talking about a microbudget flick, so in many ways\n\nit’s the effort that counts.\n\nThe movie is a lot of fun. It takes itself just seriously enough that you can buy the\n\npremise while admitting to yourself that any movie about bigfoot is going to be at least a little\n\nabsurd. Brown and Rock have put a lot of love and care into their movie. If you go into the thing\n\nwith an open mind, you’re almost certain to have a good time.\n\nPat King has had short stories, essays, and a novel published in various places online and in print. As P.S. King, he’s had two short film scripts produced. He’s also directed a handful of short documentaries and experimental films. Pat writes or has written film reviews and interviews for Dread Central, Brainwavestalk.com, The Daily Grindhouse, CC2Konline.com, TheRetroSet.com, Battleroyalewithcheese.com and Mugwumpcorporation.com. He is a former film section editor at Cultured Vultures.\n\nA Sketchy Character, Indeed\n\nSure enough, all I have to do to ensure that I will change my mind about a topic is to state positively that I will cover something specific in my next epistle, only to be distracted by some shiny object and hence led astray down a whole ‘nother rabbit hole. So it is this time, when the promise of an examination of a particular artist’s pre- and post-Marvel career has been derailed. For the nonce, at any rate.\n\nThe populace may recall that a couple of episodes back, I expounded upon the all-too-brief history of Skywald Publications. One of its founders, Israel Waldman, I identified as a rather sketchy character who issued unauthorized reprints of other publishers’ comics. As it turns out, I just couldn’t leave that subject alone; ergo, today’s missive.\n\nFaithful followers of this blog may recall that some time ago I expounded upon the deleterious effect upon the comic book industry of Dr. Fredric’s Wertham’s scurrilous diatribe against the genre in the form of his book, Seduction of the Innocent, and how its publication resulted in the demise of a vast swath of smaller publishers. Waldman discovered that the letterpress plates used to reproduce the product of those fatally injured houses had been left with the printer, Eastern Color Printing, after the companies went belly up. He arranged to take those plates off the printer’s hands, acquired new advertisers and cover art, and republished the contents of those orphaned issues in new forms under the banner of I.W. Publications, packaged three to a bag for a quarter, and intended to be distributed through grocery and discount stores.\n\nI.W. produced a wide variety of genres in 1958, including horror. There were three issues of Eerie; eight of Strange Mysteries; and a reprint of Avon’s 1951 one-shot Dr. Fu Manchu, drawn by the great Wally Wood. The 1958 issues had the I.W. colophon on the upper left corner of the covers. On the upper right was the logo, “A Top-Quality Comic”. They were priced at ten cents, which was the norm at the time.\n\nThe company went on hiatus for five years, re-emerging in 1963 with the usual twelve cent cover price, again in three-for-a-quarter bags. Waldman put out a trio of issues of The Spirit in this round, using the character created in 1941 by Will Eisner and originally disseminated in 16-page Sunday newspaper comics supplements. His adventures were reprinted by Quality Comics, which also published Plastic Man, who also got the three-issue treatment from I.W. The Spirit was a semi-sort-of-kinda-peripherally-supernatural hero whose exploits ought to be examined at length in this space one of these days. We’ll see.\n\nThe horror titles included three issues of Mystery Tales, four of Eerie Tales and seven of Fantastic Adventures, all drawn from the previous fright-filled output of Avon, Novelty, Star, and other deceased publishers. This time the cover displayed the “Super Comics Seal of Quality” instead of the previous tags.\n\nI.W. lasted another year, disappearing in 1964, but the issues lingered in the bargain bins of comic book stores through the end of the century, and likely beyond. Collecting the company’s output has always been somewhat problematic, as Waldman declined to date the issues, or even maintain a rational and predictable numbering system. First issues were often labeled as Number 9, and Waldman seemed to have an aversion to the numbers 13 and 14. No title went above the issue numbered 18. In this way, there were virtually no problems with the comics being returned for being out of date, as was the case for most of the other publishers.\n\nFortunately, we have the Grand Comics Database to provide information on the 118 titles put out by I.W. As well, 267 of the 332 separate issues are available for downloading at Comic Book +. Virtually all of the horror issues are there. I hope you’ll check out a few of them. They’re fun, even if their provenance is a little iffy.\n\nWhatever it was that happened to Israel Waldman after his two documented excursions into comics publishing, I have been unable to determine. If more information is forthcoming in the future, I shall endeavor to enlighten the populace upon such intelligence as I can locate. Until such time as that comes to fruition, he remains a man of mystery. Which is rather apropos, don’t you think?\n\nWhen next we meet here in this space, we’ll be looking over the horror movies produced by M-G-M in the years 1930 and 1931. Please do be present and on time. I’d hate to have to leave on that journey without you. Until then, I bid you to never forget, my minions of the mystic and the monstrous, to be afraid…\n\nBe very afraid.\n\nPRC Horror Movies 1940-1945\n\nEdgar G. Ulmer made one of the greatest of the classic horror films of the 1930s, The Black Cat, co-starring Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi for the first of the several movies they made together. It was, in fact, Universal’s top money-maker of the year. Ulmer’s future at Universal seemed assured, until he went and had an affair with the wife of studio chief Carl Laemmle’s nephew, Max Alexander.\n\nOops.\n\nBlack-balled from the major studios for his indiscretion, Ulmer and his inamorata, Shirley, who soon became his wife, bounced around the fringes of Hollywood making ethnic films, mostly Yiddish, and whatever else they could find to keep body and soul together. They eventually fetched up at the lowest of the low, the farthest slot down Gower Street in what was even then called Poverty Row – PRC.\n\nProducers Releasing Corporation only existed from 1939 to 1947. In that short span of time, the company churned out scads of truly forgettable Grade Z western, mystery and adventure pictures, almost none of which cost more than $100,000 to make. The few for which they are remembered today include some fair-to-middlin’ horror movies, along with a handful of pretty good films that Ulmer directed for them, including one bona fide classic of the film noir genre, Detour.\n\nBy 1940, Bela Lugosi’s career had already begun its downward slide. A year after he had a small role as the Russian commissar who sent Greta Garbo to America in M-G-M’s classic comedy Ninotchka, he wound up at PRC. In the much less prestigious movie The Devil Bat, Bela plays the disgruntled ex-employee of a chemical company who gets revenge by training a giant bat to attack whoever is wearing his new aftershave. Bottles of which get sent out to his former bosses.\n\nSecond-tier horror icon George Zucco made several pictures for PRC in this period. In 1942’s The Mad Monster, co-starring future three-time Frankenstein’s Monster Glenn Strange, Zucco is a mad scientist who gets revenge by turning his handy-man into a werewolf. He played twins in 1943’s Dead Men Walk, one sort of good-ish and one pretty awful. The better brother kills the badder brother for being such a no-goodnik. Naughty sibling rises from his grave to drain the living of their blood.\n\nPRC did occasionally make a little side money distributing films made by other companies, such as the 1943 English horror picture The Night Has Eyes, released in America as Terror House. James Mason stalks a couple of school teachers around the requisite old dark house.\n\nJames Dunn was about as memorable as a newlywed sleuth in 1943’s The Ghost and the Guest as you’d think. He and his new missus find themselves checking out a supposedly haunted house that turns out to be inhabited by crooks rather than spooks. The much more memorable J. Carroll Naish headlined The Monster Maker in 1944, in which he devised a formula to induce acromegaly, that bone disease that made Rondo Hatton such an impressive movie villain. Naish infests Ralph Morgan and sends him out to perform anti-social activities in hope of getting the antidote. That’s not nice.\n\nThe high-point of this period is the surprisingly good Bluebeard. John Carradine is the crazed puppeteer who has a hard time resisting the temptation to wring the necks of various pretty mademoiselles in 19th Century Paris. Directed by – you guessed it – Edgar G. Ulmer, it brings style and class to the otherwise style-deficient and de classe studio.\n\nUlmer struck again in 1945 with Strange Illusion, in which a young man has strange, ominous dreams about his widowed mother’s new beau. Star Jimmy Lydon had been playing a second-banana Archie Andrews type character named Henry Aldrich, so this was a real departure for him. As was the case with Bluebeard, Ulmer brought some unexpected craftsmanship to a project that didn’t really deserve it, but his talent made a silk purse out of the proverbial sow’s ear.\n\nZucco returned that year as a widower who invites those he believes to be responsible for his wife’s murder to his own personal old dark house, which he has booby-trapped in myriad ways. One of the doomed guests is played by Lionel Atwill, who had managed to appear in every one of Universal’s Frankenstein pictures from Son of Frankenstein in 1939 to House of Dracula in 1945. He passed away not long after that last film. Perhaps too much Frankenstein is not good for one’s health.\n\nSo, what did the co-creator of Spider-Man and Doctor Strange do before, and after, his tenure drawing those two characters for Marvel? Be back here in two weeks for ‘Ditko at Charlton’ to find out! Until then, as always I bid you, my magnificent mavens of menace, to be afraid…\n\nBe very afraid.\n\nA solid cast and a surprisingly emotional climax elevate Savage above most of the Bigfoot films flooding movie-streaming services like Tubi. Savage may not make the list of all-time classic Bigfoot films, but I enjoyed it.\n\nOriginally released in 2011 by Fearmakers Studios and directed by Jordan Blum, Savage stars veteran actors Tony Becker (Tour of Duty), Martin Kove (The Karate Kid, Cobra Kai), and Lisa Wilcox (A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master). In November 2023, BayView Entertainment released Savage on digital platforms such as Vudu, Tubi, Hoopla, Flix Fling, and Amazon Prime Video.\n\nSubtitled The Bigfoot Legend…Lives, Savage opens during a forest fire blazing through Bear Valley National Park and forcing animals from their natural habitats. One of those animals is an angry Bigfoot that kills two firefighters and a sheriff’s deputy in a couple of tense opening sequences.\n\nThe film then introduces the main characters, including Owen (Becker), a park ranger with a pregnant wife who’s tasked with investigating a missing firefighter crew.\n\nThere’s also Jack (Kove), an unscrupulous hunter who’s guiding a young scientist named Dale eager to study Bigfoot. Jack is a grizzled local looking for revenge because of a past encounter with Bigfoot that ended in tragedy. Dale is played by Shane Callahan (Under the Dome).\n\n“They ain’t like us,” Jack tells Dale. “Ain’t got no morals or ethics. They’re savage. That’s what makes them dangerous.”\n\nThe other main characters are a former marine and his abused wife Gabrielle. Both are on the lam and trying to hide out in the forest.\n\nThere’s more. Amid all the chaos caused by the fire is a mayor pushing a controversial vacation development called Hunter’s Heaven adjacent to the forest, which is Bigfoot’s home.\n\nThe first half of Savage takes its time introducing all the players along with their motivations. When Bigfoot finally appears, I was more than ready to see it. Arriving in full force at the 44-minute mark, Bigfoot makes the moment count as it attacks the marine and chases his wife.\n\nThe chase scene is by far the best sequence in the movie as we see Bigfoot’s athleticism in all of its glory. The creature (Jack Harrison) runs low and fast, drops down on all fours for added speed, and climbs trees like a monkey on caffeine.\n\nThe scene is also where we see the abused wife Gabrielle show off her skills as a survivor, snatching up a shotgun like a pro before making a stand. One of the highlights of the film is the performance by Anna Enger Ritch (The Haunting of Hill House) as Gabrielle. At first, she plays her with meek vulnerability, but it quickly transforms into gritty determination when her life is threatened.\n\nJack and Dale eventually meet Gabrielle in the forest, but Owen catches up to them and takes Gabrielle into custody as a wanted fugitive. However, Bigfoot returns with a vengeance and soon all the main characters face the creature, some not living to tell the tale. I did get a bit emotional for a moment when an unexpected sacrifice is made during the climactic scene.\n\nWhile Savage never quite rises above its B-movie creature-feature pedigree, it displays more than enough heart and features one of the more realistic Bigfoots I’ve seen to make it a worthy entry into the canon of cryptid films.\n\nNEXT UP: Chapter Seventy-Four: Devils Desk. I review the 2022 novel by Mark Tufo.\n\nThe Moor\n\nReview by PS King\n\nYorkshire, 1996. Claire and Danny are children stealing sweets from a corner shop. While Claire is out of the shop, a stranger nabs Danny. Twenty-five years later, Danny’s father Bill (David Edward-Robertson) is still obsessed with finding his son, whose body he’s convinced is buried on the nearby moor, along with several other children that went missing around the same time. Claire (Sophia La Porta) has a podcast and Bill wants her to come out to the moor with him and report on his findings, which she’s reluctant to do. Finally, she decides to accompany him. With the help of a slightly psychic man and his very psychic daughter, they go further and further into a strange labyrinth of supernatural horror.\n\nDirector Chris Cronin is a master of mood. Though the plot is relatively simple, atmosphere and psychology are the main focus here. The Moor has a meditative pace that makes the psychological unraveling of the characters slow and impactful. The movie starts with no supernatural elements, but by the time we reach the last thirty minutes, it’s a full-on supernatural horror. The Moor is a two-hour film, and it takes a while for the traditional horror elements to kick in, but that doesn’t really matter. The point is to explore the moor with the characters. You can feel the expansiveness, the desolation, the undercurrent of violence in the place with every step that they take into its dangerous terrain.\n\nPoint of view is very important here, and that’s why there’s multiple types of cameras used. At various times we switch from a traditional cinematic POV and watch documentary interviews that Claire has shot. At others we cut to footage from a body cam that Claire wears during her trips to the Moor, which gives the movie a found footage feel at times. This is used most effectively at the end, when the found footage POV is the most visceral.\n\nThe Moor explores the idea of possession in a variety of interesting ways. Bill is possessed. Perhaps in a supernatural way, perhaps not. But his obsession with finding his son possesses him until it completely takes over as his psyche becomes increasingly unwound. In contrast to Bill’s possession, though, there is another character who is definitely supernaturally possessed, and we eventually learn which of these possessions is more dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, the movie asks whether a piece of land can be possessed. There’s an unspoken terror that surrounds the characters, even when there’s no supernatural stuff happening. And Claire definitely has some connection to the land that’s psychically not quite normal. At one point Claire asks, “How can a place want anything?” and this is the question we’re supposed to ask as an audience. How can a place be a thing that actively desires something? And why children? The mythology that Thomas and Cronin establish around the moor is fascinating, and well thought out.\n\nThe movie eases us into the supernatural elements and therefore eases us into the horror genre. But the last thirty minutes are quite chilling. The final moments actually frightened me a bit, and I’m a jaded film journalist who has seen just about everything the horror genre has on offer.\n\nThe Moor is a moving tale of obsession and possession. It’s a welcome new folk horror that’s well worth the small amount of patience it requires of its audience.\n\nPat King has had short stories, essays, and a novel published in various places online and in print. As P.S. King, he’s had two short film scripts produced. He’s also directed a handful of short documentaries and experimental films. Pat writes or has written film reviews and interviews for Dread Central, Brainwavestalk.com, The Daily Grindhouse, CC2Konline.com, TheRetroSet.com, Battleroyalewithcheese.com and Mugwumpcorporation.com. He is a former film section editor at Cultured Vultures.\n\nAs I related last year, Republic Pictures was primarily founded to make serials and westerns. Sixty-six chapterplays were made by the studio, from Darkest Africa in 1936 to 1955’s King of the Carnival. I’ve seen better than half of them, and a lot of the westerns, and they’re consistently enjoyable. Not at all deep, but lots of fun, with vim and vigor and plenty of action and suspense.\n\nI wish I could say the same of the studio’s horror output.\n\nBy the way, I won’t be covering any of the serials in this missive. As noted previously, a few do have genre-adjacent aspects, but horror was never really the point.\n\nReleased in the first year of Republic’s existence, 1935’s The Crime of Dr. Crespi starred Erich von Stroheim and Dwight Frye, both of whom should have known better. Loosely based on “The Premature Burial” by Edgar Allan Poe, it does not redound to the credit of anyone involved. My recommendation is to skip ahead a few decades and instead enjoy the 1962 Roger Corman film starring Ray Milland. You’ll thank me the longest day of your life.\n\nApparently having learned their lesson, Republic waited nine years to produce the infinitely better 1944 offering, The Lady and the Monster, also starring Erich von Stroheim, albeit in much improved form, and Richard Arlen, whose horror film pedigree includes The Island of Lost Souls from 1932. Alas, it is saddled with the presence of the unfortunate Vera Hruba Ralston, generally considered the worst actress ever imported to the United States from Czechoslovakia. Despite her desperate but doomed attempt to impersonate a thespian, this adaptation of Curt Siodmak’s 1942 novel, Donovan’s Brain, is the best I’ve seen. Future first lady Nancy Davis Reagan is not much better than poor Vera Hruba in the 1953 version, but that one isn’t totally without merit. It’s just not as good, in my humble opinion, as the first adaptation of the tale of the preserved brain of a wealthy and power-hungry man who exerts undue influence upon the mad scientist who put it into a jar and hooked it up to a variety of electronic doohickeys. A third version, made in Germany in 1962 under the title of The Brain, introduces an element of revenge not in the original story. As Dr. Samuel Johnson once said of a play he was being paid to review, it’s worth seeing but not worth going to see.\n\nArlen returned in the next year’s The Phantom Speaks, in which an executed killer’s spirit possesses his doctor. I’m beginning to detect a trend, here. The medico, against his will, proceeds to eliminate anyone and everyone who assisted in sending the murderer to the electric chair. It does not end well for him, which is really too bad. But there it is.\n\nRepublic had two more offerings in 1945. The Vampire’s Ghost was loosely based on “The Vampyre” by John Polidori, about which more later on in the upcoming podcast season. Relocated from England and Greece to somewhere in Africa, John Abbott stars as a nightclub owner whose clientele and employees occasionally suffer from terminal exsanguination.\n\nFinally, The Woman Who Came Back foreshadows the 1962 cult classic Carnival of Souls in that the heroine is the only survivor of a bus crash, in this case as it is returning her to her hometown. She is the last descendant of an ancestor who had burned accused witches back in the bad old days, something that never actually occurred in America. An old woman claiming to be the revenant of one of his victims haunts the young lady, who apparently never herself personally burned anyone at the stake, but the nature of vengeance is not often to be reasonable. A curse involving the possession of the nearest available female by the spirit of the witch’s apparition frightens the local populace into attacking the poor girl before the truth is finally revealed.\n\nWhat was this obsession with possession out there in Studio City? One does wonder.\n\nRepublic only produced a handful of other horror films over the next dozen years or so, which we’ll take a look at next time the studio’s slot on the lazy susan of horror topics comes around. No diamonds, in the rough or otherwise, but there are a couple of semi-precious stones in the mix.\n\nStay tuned!\n\nWhen next we descend together into the catacombs below for another tale from the history of the horrific, we’ll hear a yarn about the biggest hit ever on the Billboard charts that was about vampirism. Something few listeners even suspected for several decades. Come along for that little trip into the realm of moldy oldies, won’t you? Until then, I bid you, effendis of eeriness, to be afraid…\n\nBe very afraid.\n\nIn Memoriam\n\nIt’s been a good while since I’ve done one of these. I had intended to only offer a single obituary on a single subject, but since my last missive to the populace, that mean ol’ Grim Reaper has managed to absquatulate with a couple more of the significant contributors to Our Genre. Ergo, this tripart offering. I hope y’all approve.\n\nIn a letter to Robert Hooke in 1675, Sir Isaac Newton wrote, “If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.” And so it is with David J. Skal of Ohio.\n\nI can’t swear to it, but I believe I first became aware of him from a documentary included in one of the Universal Monster DVDs, those sets with all the Frankenstein or Mummy or Dracula pictures from the 1930s and 1940s that Walmart drags out of the back room every year in the weeks leading up to Halloween. The insights and information he presented in his calm, measured tones and sardonically dry wit were never to be taken as mere trivia.\n\nIt was only later that I learned Skal had written numerous essays and reviews for The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, The New York Review of Science Fiction, and other magazines, as well as no fewer than seven scholarly works on a variety of monstrous topics, beginning with Hollywood Gothic: The Tangled Web of Dracula from Novel to Stage to Screen in 1990. He also penned a biography of Bram Stoker, in addition to three novels and a batch of short stories, and edited an anthology of vampire tales. A full list is available on his page at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database.\n\nI have since then tracked down and devoured a fair amount of his oeuvre, which has on more than one occasion provided various tidbits and factoids which I have included in my endeavors on your behalf. Don’t thank me. Thank him.\n\nIn fact, it was, in large part, his yeoman labors in articulating the history of Our Genre that inspired me to take on the mantle of your very own personal historian of horror. Whether that redounds to his credit or to his blame I leave to others to decide, but in my estimation, Skal was one of the giants, and therefore he deserves respect, regardless.\n\nOn January 1, 2024, the car in which he and his partner, Robert Postawko, were riding was struck by another vehicle. Postawko lingered for several weeks before succumbing to his injuries. David J. Skal died at the scene at the much too young age of 71.\n\nThanks for letting me stand on your shoulders, Mr. Skal.\n\nIf I recall correctly, the first book published by Arkham House that I ever acquired, from the long-gone and much-lamented Davis-Kidd Booksellers in Nashville, was the short story collection The Caller of the Black by the prolific author, Brian Lumley. Born in County Durham, England in 1937, he spent some years as a military policeman before retiring from the British Army to become a full-time writer. He was known for his many Cthulhu Mythos stories, a fair number of which featured his own character Titus Crow. He also scribed a handful of tales set in Lovecraft’s Dreamlands. Lumley’s heroes were more likely to fight back against the eldritch horrors they faced than the standard mythos characters, who typically resorted to fainting as their default reaction.\n\nLumley began his long-running Necroscope series in 1986, featuring Harry Keogh, who had the unique ability to hold friendly chats with deceased persons. Harry and others spent eighteen novels contending against a strain of vampire Lumley called Wamphyri.\n\nLumley received Lifetime Achievement Awards from both the Horror Writers Association and the World Fantasy Convention. He died on the second of January, at 86.\n\nArgentine artist Jose Delbo drew myriad comic books during his more than sixty year career, which began in his native land when he was only sixteen and continued well into the 21st Century. After fleeing the political unrest in Argentina, he fetched up in the United States and began producing stories included in Gold Key’s horror titles The Twilight Zone, Ripley’s Believe it or Not! and Boris Karloff Tales of Mystery; Charlton’s Ghostly Tales and The Many Ghosts of Dr. Graves; and The Spectre, House of Secrets, House of Mystery and The Witching Hour for DC. The Grand Comics Database lists nearly a thousand credited pieces for him. He passed away on the fifth of February of this year. He was 90. Not a bad run.\n\nNext time, we’ll take a look at the first decade of horror output from Republic Pictures, a name you might recognize from my Rampaging Robots column of last year. Until then, I bid you to be afraid…\n\nBe very afraid.\n\nThe Anti-Marvel\n\nPulp magazine publisher Martin Goodman graduated to comic books in 1939. He sold off the company that had grown up to be Marvel Comics in 1968, and retired four years later. In 1974, apparently missing his old job, he founded Seaboard Periodicals, with the intent of setting it up as a serious competitor to his old operation, as well as to DC Comics and magazine format publishers like Warren. He called his new venture Atlas Comics, which was Marvel’s name in the 1950s. He hired Larry Lieber, brother of Marvel editor-in-chief Stan Lee and both writer and artist for that publisher, to edit his new black-and-white line. Goodman’s notion was to give Lieber a chance to shine out from under the overwhelming personality and presence of his brother. He hired former Warren workhorse Jeff Rovin to edit the color comics, in each case switching his new editors from the field in which they had demonstrated some proficiency into areas of profound inexperience. That ought to have been an indicator that all was not going to go well. And it didn’t.\n\nNot that the new set of Atlas Comics was below industry standards. On the contrary, Goodman paid top rates and attracted top talent. The problem is he had bottom distribution and sales, and was soon hemorrhaging cash. The line folded in less than a year, with no more than four issues of any title seeing print.\n\nIn that short span, however, Atlas put out some pretty good scary stuff. In addition to the usual costumed character titles, war comics, westerns, sword-&-sorcery tales and the like, the color line featured several supernatural or semi-monstrous super-heroes (The Grim Ghost, Morlock, The Brute, Demon Hunter, Frank Thorne’s “Son of Dracula” in Fright, Pat Boyette’s “Tarantula” in Weird Suspense), an anthology title (Tales of Evil), and the science-fictiony Planet of Vampires, with some very nice Pat Broderick interior art and the legendary Neal Adams gracing the cover of the second of the three issues.\n\nThere was also a pair of black-and-white magazines, each running two issues – a Vampirella rip-off called Devilina, and an anthology title, Weird Tales of the Macabre. Both featured some exceptional artwork, and were of comparable quality with their peers on the newsstands – when they could get access to said venues. Which was, as I stated above, problematic. I found the color titles regularly, but never got my hands on the black-and-white magazines. There are scans online, but to this day I’ve never seen a physical copy of either.\n\nRovin’s tenure was brief. Lieber took over as editor of the entire line before the end, but that end came all too soon. None of the scary titles went past three issues, only a few of the others going the full four. The first titles showed up in February of 1975, the final ones in September, freeing me to spend what cash I scrounged from odd jobs and turning coke bottles in for a few pennies apiece on Marvel and DC comic books, Doc Savage and Conan paperbacks, and the occasional pack of bubblegum cards. My copies vanished in the Great Comic Book Sell-Off of 1989, along with a full box of the original 1950s Atlas Comics I’d begun accumulating once I got steady work in real jobs, a fairly impressive batch of ECs, about a quarter of the run of Hillman’s Airboy (featuring the Heap – remember him?), a near complete run of Batman back to 1958, and at least one comic book from every year beginning in 1937.\n\nAll of which goes to demonstrate that nothing lasts forever. Certainly not the little publisher that couldn’t, Atlas/Seaboard. And that’s too bad. It was a worthy if misguided effort.\n\nMartin Goodman passed away in 1992 at the age of 84. In 2010, his grandson Jason attempted to revive the Atlas line with minimal success. The Grim Ghost was one of the revived characters, the only one from the scary titles. He appeared in the three issues of Atlas United and seven under his own banner, but that was over in little more than a year.\n\nLarry Lieber is now 92, and long retired. Jeff Rovin is still kicking around the genre. In 1998 he published a very enjoyable sort-of-sequel to Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein called Return of the Wolf Man. A second pastiche of the old Universal monsters was proposed that would feature the Bride of Frankenstein, but that apparently never materialized.\n\nOh, well.\n\nNext time, I will expound upon the life and career of the late and lamented David J. Skal, whose passing I am noting in my last missive to the populace. He was one of the giants upon whose shoulders your Historian of Horror has stood. Until then, I bid you to be afraid…\n\nBe very afraid.\n\nMiddle Aged Crazy\n\nMedieval Horror is the theme this month, and boy-oh-boy have I got a movie for you! It’s one I watched a dozen times in my mis-spent youth, a tale of dashing knights and lovely maidens, with a dragon and an ogre and a hag and an evil magician, replete with special effects of surpassing cheesiness and dialogue more than corny enough to satisfy the most discriminating devotee of early 1960s B-Movies…\n\nThe Magic Sword!\n\nDirected by the legendary Bert I. Gordon and released in January of 1962 by United Artists, it wasn’t the first sword-&-sorcery film — that would be Fritz Lang’s 1924 two-parter, Die Niebelungen — but it’s the first live-action American film with armored knights, an ogre, sorcerers both good and bad, and a dragon. And, yes, even a magic sword!\n\nAn aspiring knight named George (Gary Lockwood, the first astronaut for whom HAL wouldn’t open the pod bay doors in 2001: A Space Odyssey), son of a ditsy sorceress named Sybil (Estelle Winwood) falls in love remotely with Princess Helene (Anne Helm). Her Royal Highness has in turn caught the nefarious attentions of Sir Branton (Liam Sullivan), who conspires with evil sorcerer Lodac (former Sherlock Holmes and horror movie regular Basil Rathbone) to convince the king to give Helene to him as his bride so he can take over the kingdom. George tricks his mother into revealing her stash of magical goodies, including sword and shield and six miniature knights from various countries that become full-sized warriors upon command. George leads his tiny army into combat against Branton and Lodac, gradually losing them to the various dangers along the way.\n\nAfter George slays an ogre with his magic sword, the French knight stops to dally with a pretty young thang played by Maila Nurmi. Remember I mentioned her last time? She was one of the first television horror hosts in the mid-1950s under the moniker of Vampira. Maila also appeared as the undead wife of Bela Lugosi’s character in Plan 9 from Outer Space. In The Magic Sword, she turns into a hag while giving Sir Dennis a nearly fatal hickey. Rude.\n\nGeorge runs out of assistant knights about the time Lodac strips his magical items of their power. Inconveniently, this is just as he finds himself obliged to rescue Helene from Lodac’s pet fire-breathing dragon. Sybil reverses Lodac’s spell just in time, before turning in a panther and putting the bite on the villain. George is finally knighted, his companions are revived, he marries the princess and all’s well that ends well. As it should be.\n\nA few months later, the similarly themed Jack the Giant Killer was released, also by United Artists, based on a Cornish fairy tale. It starred Seventh Voyage of Sinbad alumni Kerwin Matthews and Torin Thatcher as the hero and villain, respectively. Featuring stop-motion animation by a very young Jim Danforth, this is a darker, more monster-filled picture than The Magic Sword. Not sure it’s any better, but it ain’t bad.\n\nThere was an earlier movie also called The Magic Sword — at least that’s the title in English. In Serbian, it was called Čudotvorni mač and was a 1950 Yugoslavian production based on Serbian folktales. Armored knights, an evil wizard, a magic sword — familiar territory, indeed.\n\nAll three movies, by the way, are on YouTube.\n\nIf you recall my column on horror in comic strips from way back in March of 2021, you might remember that I mentioned Prince Valiant, Hal Foster’s classic Arthurian Era saga of knights and vikings and the occasional dragon. There have been two live-action film adaptations of Val’s adventures, the first in 1954 starring Robert Wagner, Janet Leigh and James Mason, with no supernatural elements that I recall, and one from 1997 with a fairly significant cast including Janna Lumley as sorceress Morgana la Fey. Neither one is on YouTube, as far as I can tell.\n\nI do want to give a hearty Dark Ages shout out to the 1967 Russian film, Viy. A young seminarian on his way home for the holidays wanders into the domain of the title character, a deceased witch, whose wake he is forced to preside over. A darn fine movie, and one you can find on YouTube.\n\nI’d like to request, if I may, a brief moment of silence, please, in memory of the preeminent horror historian of our time, a man in whose shadow I shall always remain. David J. Skal passed away January 1, 2024 at 71. More on him later.\n\nIn our next action-packed episode, we delve into the Sour Grapes Archive to examine a short-lived comics publisher created to outshine one of the Big Two. If only. Join me then, won’t you?\n\nUntil that time, kindly do remember to be afraid…\n\nBe very afraid.\n\nThe 1976 film Creature from Black Lake is one of the most honest-to-goodness Bigfoot movies ever made. No frills or special effects, the movie drops a pair of University of Chicago students into the humid atmosphere of a Louisiana swamp town to prove the existence of a creature that reportedly killed a man. Add a top-notch cast of veteran character actors to the mix, and the film becomes one of the all-time classic Bigfoot flicks.\n\nThe college students are typical guys who are initially as excited about the prospect of meeting Cajun girls as they are about finding Bigfoot. Once in town, they meet a community of folks reticent about discussing the creature and even receive a warning from the sheriff. But one resident offers to share the story of his Bigfoot encounter for a ride home, and the students know they are on the right track.\n\nAbout an hour into the movie, the story picks up steam when the students follow Joe Canton to his home. Canton (played by incomparable character actor Jack Elam) witnessed the creature snatch his friend from their boat and tells the guys his story about finding large footprints and following them deep into the wilderness. At the end of the trail, he discovered an area where large boars were killed and partially eaten.\n\nCanton tells the guys where to go to find the spot, and the creature wastes no time in punishing the trespassers. On the first night, the college students sense Bigfoot circling their camp, which sets up a suspenseful climax in the final twenty minutes.\n\nDespite its low budget and production value, Creature from Black Lake is one of the best Bigfoot films I’ve watched. Elam plays the cantankerous drunk Joe Canton with a wild-eyed recklessness. Yet when sharing his Bigfoot encounter with the students, he sobers up and delivers his tale with the intensity of Quint’s USS Indianapolis story from Jaws. Another scene stealer is character actor Dub Taylor who plays Grandpaw Bridges.\n\nElam started acting in the 1940s and performed in tons of Westerns, including the iconic Once Upon a Time in the West. Taylor, who began acting in the 1930s, also played in lots of Westerns, including The Wild Bunch. Getting to watch these two amazing character actors in the same movie is a gift. I only wish they had a scene together.\n\nYou also have the sheriff played by Bill Thurman, another veteran character actor who played the sheriff in ‘Gator Bait. Dennis Fimple and John David Carson are solid in their roles as the ambitiously naïve college students. Fimple is an experienced character actor who appeared in King Kong the same year as Creature from Black Lake. The boyishly handsome Carson acted in numerous TV series in the ‘70s and ‘80s, including Barnaby Jones, Charlie’s Angels, and Falcon Crest.\n\nThe film’s writer/producer Jim McCullough Jr. obviously knew the Bigfoot legend and really nails the lingering fear that the creature engenders in eyewitnesses even decades after an encounter. The direction by Joy N. Houck Jr. is smart enough to keep the focus on the human characters, maintaining the mystery with only flashes of Bigfoot in shadow and silhouettes.\n\nCreature from Black Lake scores a middling 5.0 rating (out of 10) on the IMDb movie database and review site. As a Bigfoot enthusiast who’s watched more movies and documentaries about the cryptid than I care to admit, I’d bump up the rating to 7.5 and put Creature from Black Lake in my Top 10 Bigfoot films. Why? Because it stays true to the subject matter and delivers on the atmospherics. The opening scene is a classic to me as it instantly transports you into a Louisiana swamp with an eerie soundtrack of creature sounds and distorted synthesizer. And I absolutely love the final heartwarming moment between the two college students. Plus, the movie poster is one of the best pieces of Bigfoot art ever. Ultimately, I simply like the fact that the film doesn’t try to be anything more than a straightforward Bigfoot story.

I interview the podcast host Bob Doll.\n\nThe 2019 documentary Paranormal Bigfoot is 90 minutes of talking heads discussing the possibility of Sasquatch as more than a relic hominid or primate. Despite its static format, the film offers interesting theories from quantum physics to a biblical chapter in Genesis to explain why there may be more to Bigfoot than originally thought.\n\nParanormal Bigfoot is available to watch free on the ad-supported streaming service Tubi.\n\nDirected and produced by Bill and Amy Lancaster, Paranormal Bigfoot features a who’s who of researchers and investigators in the Sasquatch community, including Stan Gordon, Ron Morehead, and Bob Gimlin. Most have opened their minds to the prospect of Bigfoot as an interdimensional being or a creature with powers to manipulate the mind and electromagnetic fields.\n\nOf course, any evidence is anecdotal at best, but the researchers and investigators share some intriguing stories that illustrate why the paranormal segment of the Sasquatch community is growing.\n\nThey address why Sasquatch is so elusive. Gordon says a credible witness watched a Bigfoot disappear in front of her and noted other cases of tracks mysteriously ending even in the middle of the snow. Researcher Arla Cailleach Collett says as a 6-year-old she watched one of the creatures fade away. The most amazing story is relayed by David Bakara of the Expedition: Bigfoot Museum. He says an older man from Georgia recounted an incident in the 1970s. He and four other friends were sitting in a van when suddenly he heard screaming. He looked in the back seat and saw an 8-foot hairy creature sitting where one of his friends had been. He reached to flip on his light and turned back to the creature, but his friend was back in the seat, and the creature was gone. All four in the van plainly saw the creature in the back seat.\n\nMorehead, who’s known for recording the Sierra Sounds in the 1970s, says a retired Navy cryptologist established the vocalizations revealed a complex language. Morehead also talked about the relationship of quantum physics to Sasquatch and wrote a book in 2017 titled The Quantum Bigfoot.\n\nThe interviewees discuss the presence of orbs and lights during Sasquatch encounters. Collett mentions orbs could be an energy form of travel. Gordon noted several strange cases in the 1970s where UFO accounts coincided with Bigfoot sightings. Morehead said he watched a tube of light that looked like a light saber float by him in 2016. It was preceded by wood knocks.\n\nSome believe Sasquatch can communicate telepathically. Gordon offered the most interesting story regarding mindspeak. He recounted an interview with a person who said Sasquatch telepathically indicated that there would be a UFO incident over Homer City, Pennsylvania, near a power plant. ‘The next morning several residents reported “very strange loud sounds like something very low maneuvering over the area.” Authorities responded and did not find any evidence, but the newspaper reported the incident.\n\nChristopher Noël sees a similarity between Sasquatch and autistic savants, including telepathic abilities. He wrote books titled The Sasquatch Savant Theory and Sasquatch and Autism: Twelve Parallels. He also thinks Bigfoot can manipulate electromagnetic fields to conceal itself, which he says is possible because scientists have already created what is essentially an invisibility cloak a la Harry Potter. He also talks about “electric people” whose high energy levels can affect electronics.\n\nMorehead, Gordon, and Noël all described instances where the presence of Sasquatch drained batteries, caused camera malfunctions, and in one case caused a vehicle to lose power.\n\nThere is a brief discussion of how animals react in the presence of Bigfoot. They reportedly go silent when the creatures are nearby.\n\nOne of the more interesting discussions revolves around Genesis 6:4 and the topic of the Nephilim, or giants, who are the offspring of fallen angels and human women. The idea that Bigfoot is the offspring of such a union could be one reason why the creature is attributed paranormal powers.\n\nTony Merkel of The Confessionals Podcast says the Bible only offers a brief mention of the Nephilim but noted there were possibly up to 36 different tribes of giants. He used Goliath as an example of a giant in the Bible.\n\nUltimately, the key question is asked in the film: What is Bigfoot? The answers are as varied as the paranormal theories.\n\nGimlin of the famed Patterson-Gimlin film of 1967 says Bigfoot is more human-like than animal-like because he says they exchange gifts. Gimlin who calls them People of the Forest recounted an instance where he left food, and the creature left a small toy vehicle in its place.\n\nBakara is not so sure Bigfoot is a branch of the homo genus. He believes Sasquatch is a super predator which there are not any fossil or skeleton records. He wonders why we have fossils from about 6,000 ancient humans scattered throughout our museums, but none of a super predator who lives on six continents.\n\nProfessor Darby Orcutt of North Carolina State University says the fossil records overall are sparser than people realize. He mentions the Neanderthals who inhabited Europe for 300,000 years, but we only have fossils of 300 individuals over that span.\n\nNoël thinks Bigfoot may be a hybrid of the human female and an undiscovered male species – and the male does not have to be a giant. He pointed to the liger (a lion-tiger hybrid) which is larger than both of its parents. He also cited a genetic study in 2012 of 109 organic cryptid samples that in some instances revealed the female mitochondrial DNA is human, but the nuclear DNA, which is derived from both parents, is not easily interpreted.\n\nGordon thinks Bigfoot is likely more than just a primate as increasing data suggests the creature is interdimensional.\n\nAuthor and researcher Russell Acord is probably the most skeptical of the interviewees, saying he believes Bigfoot is possible, but it would take a Class A sighting for him to say the creature exists.\n\nAll in all, Paranormal Bigfoot is an outstanding conversation starter for Sasquatch enthusiasts. Whether you think the theories are just wild conjecture or provide legitimate food for thought, Bakara sums up the mystery of Bigfoot best.\n\n“There are gigantic secrets in this universe we’re not even aware of.”\n\nNEXT UP: Chapter Sixty-Six: Creature from Black Lake. I review the classic 1976 film directed by Joy N. Houck Jr.\n\n“For thousands of years throughout the world, many cultures have told the same story. A story of remarkable resemblance about relic hominids or wildmen living in the forest. This is the story of those who say that they have had experiences with wildmen and the evidence they have collected from these encounters.”\n\nFresh off watching Darcy Weir’s outstanding 2016 documentary The Unwonted Sasquatch, I dove into his follow-up, 2020’s Sasquatch Among Wildmen. Once again Weir delivers a compelling combination of eyewitness accounts, news reports, and videos of purported wildmen, and it’s all tempered with a healthy dose of skepticism. Sasquatch Among Wildmen is available to watch free on ad-supported streaming service Tubi.\n\nThis time Weir investigates the Bigfoot legend more on a global scale as we learn about the various types of Sasquatch like the Russian Alma, the Chinese Yeren, and the Middle Eastern Dev before returning to the North American variety.\n\nIdaho State University professor Jeff Meldrum is back, this time with more detailed explanations of cryptid footprint casts from around the world. Meldrum even mentions one of the oldest known wildman myths in literature, a figure called Enkidu from the Epic of Gilgamesh 4,000 years ago.\n\nHowever, Sasquatch Among Wildmen really shines with its analysis of videos from Russia, China, Iraq, and Poland.\n\nThere’s an extensive look at a Yeti sighting in Russia, where a figure is seen leaping and running away. We even get a frame-by-frame breakdown of the video.\n\nFrom China, there are credible eyewitness interviews plus a trail cam shot of a possible Yeren, where mitochondrial DNA tests on hair samples from the scene did not match any known animal. Chinese authorities even ordered official expeditions for the Yeren in 1961 and 1977. Neither search found any evidence, although the 1961 team concluded that locals had mistaken gibbons for the Yeren.\n\nIntriguing videos of possible Devs in Iraq and Poland are also shown, including a creepy image of a creature reflecting eyeshine.\n\nThe documentary finishes with North American sightings, highlighting the Tim Wells video shot in Idaho and the Josh Highcliff video shot in Mississippi.\n\nThere are interviews with members of Olympic Project, including co-founder Derek Randles who shares his Bigfoot encounter. Olympic Project is a research organization primarily trying to capture a clear image of Bigfoot through its Game Cam Field Study.\n\nOlympic Project core member Shane Corson discusses the discovery of Sasquatch nesting grounds, where researchers extracted core samples from the middle of the nests. However, testing did not result in any unusual DNA findings.\n\nWeir ends his documentary by featuring Olympic Project core member David Ellis, who shares samples of possible Bigfoot audio recordings along with analysis of each one.\n\nWhile Weir’s The Unwonted Sasquatch tried to make the case that the scientific community should take Bigfoot more seriously, Sasquatch Among Wildmen is more like a supporting document to the argument. However, it pulls back from making any declarations, and I like that it remains skeptical.\n\nUltimately, the documentaries are solid companions that effectively illustrate how eyewitness accounts, footprint evidence, hair samples, indigenous history, modern video, and the amateur research communities all work together to foster the tantalizing possibility that Bigfoot could exist today.\n\nNEXT UP: Chapter Sixty-Four: Natural Death. I review the 2021 short story by T.H. Millhouse.\n\nThe Unwonted Sasquatch: The Director’s Cut is one of the best Bigfoot documentaries I’ve watched. Originally released as The Unwonted Sasquatch in 2016, director Darcy Weir’s film is packed with archival footage, interviews, news accounts, photographs, and videos. The 75-minute film questions the lack of interest by the mainstream scientific community on the topic while addressing major hoaxes of the phenomenon.\n\nThe documentary is available to watch free on ad-supported streaming services Amazon Prime Freevee and Tubi. Click HERE to watch the trailer on YouTube.\n\nThe film opens with a news report from Alert Bay on Cormorant Island in Vancouver, Canada, regarding strange howls, screams, and possible sightings. The inclusion of unexplained events like the one in Alert Bay is the strength of the video. I’ve watched too many Bigfoot documentaries, particularly the more recent ones, that basically chronicle people on camping trips who don’t find anything of major interest to show. The Unwonted Sasquatch is a nice change of pace.\n\nWeir’s documentary is more of a highlight reel of Bigfoot history and news accounts combined with extensive interviews of respected researchers explaining the phenomenon. The director’s motivation is to explore the topic’s scientific legitimacy. So, while no new evidence is brought to the table, the film is still a fast-paced and interesting dive into the subject matter.\n\nAnd the documentary is detailed. For example, Idaho State University professor Jeff Meldrum delivers a 10-minute uninterrupted lecture on the head-to-toe anatomy of the Sasquatch. Researchers, including Meldrum, even break down the technical aspects of the “midtarsal break” in Bigfoot casts of its feet.\n\nOther interesting discussions include an analysis of the cast of Cripplefoot, a famous footprint found in Bossburg, Washington, in 1969, that researchers agreed would be difficult to hoax.\n\nResearcher Bill Miller talks about Gigantopithecus’ jawbone and teeth evidence discovered in China and other countries. Gigantopithecus is, of course, the extinct genus of ape that some believe still exists and could be the ancestor of modern-day Bigfoot.\n\nMiller talks about DNA tests on purported Bigfoot hair samples determined to be “unclassified primate.” Miller hopes that modern science can eventually extract DNA from the Gigantopithecus teeth found in Asia and compare it to the hair samples.\n\nThere’s even a reference to literature showing the Army Corps of Engineers’ flora and fauna description of Sasquatch’s existence in the Washington Environmental Atlas of 1975.\n\nHoaxes are confronted, including the controversial Patterson-Gimlin film of 1967 when two men videotaped an alleged Bigfoot, nicknamed Patty, walking in Bluff Creek, California. The focus of the discussion is on the angle of Patty’s gait and her heel’s vertical position as she walks, which is very different from humans.\n\nMiller delves deeper into the story of the Patterson-Gimlin film, providing more context to the episode. The film shows more of the famous clip than just Patty walking and turning her head.\n\nThe documentary addresses other big hoaxes, including the admission by Bob Heironimus that he is the man wearing the Patty suit designed by a man named Phillip Morris. The other major hoax mentioned is the Ray Wallace family’s assertion they used wooden feet to stamp fake prints throughout northern California, which ultimately resulted in the media using the name Bigfoot for the first time in 1958.\n\n“If Sasquatch does not exist then all of the footprint evidence out there has been hoaxed,” Meldrum says, a bit skeptically.\n\nMiller mentions the “eyeshine” of Bigfoot described by many witnesses, a characteristic that would be difficult to hoax.\n\n“I put on a monkey suit … my eyes are still human,” Miller says. “They don’t glow. The Sasquatch … the light hits its eyes, they glow like a coyote or a bear.”\n\nThroughout The Unwonted Sasquatch, we get interesting stories and footage, including the compelling 1994 Paul Freeman video, an eerie police radio recording of a possible Bigfoot vocalization, and a living witness interview from the 1941 Ruby Creek encounter. A new one for me was Miller’s account about an 1882 train incident that ended with the capture and loss of a possible Bigfoot body.\n\nWhether the documentary makes the case that Sasquatch should be taken more seriously by the scientific community is debatable. With so much fake evidence and so many theories – some outlandish – invading the Internet jungle, Sasquatch research remains on the fringe of hard science.\n\nFootage from a town hall meeting illustrates the issues with Bigfoot research.\n\n“The biggest obstacle to the continung research in this field is the community itself,” says one researcher. “They’re their own worst enemy. More than anything, the whole field resembles more like an asylum that’s being taken over by the inmates.”\n\nStill, educated men of science believe, including noted Washington State anthropology professor Grover Krantz, who died in 2002.\n\n“I’m satisfied that this Bigfoot thing exists,” he says. “Trying to make the case for it on the present evidence is largely futile. Almost any scientist will tell you in no uncertain terms that you will prove the existence of the Bigfoot or Sasquatch by bringing in a body or a substantial piece of one. No other evidence is proof.”\n\nNEXT UP: Chapter Sixty-Three: Sasquatch Among Wildmen. I review the 2020 documentary directed by Darcy Weir.\n\nMore of a documentary and tour of Bigfoot historical sites than a true Sasquatch hunt, Knievel’s Quest: Bigfoot features researchers explaining the basics of Sasquatch lore to one of the greatest motorcycle daredevils of all time, Robbie Knievel.\n\nKnievel, the son of legendary daredevil Evel Knievel, was most known for jumping across a 220-foot Grand Canyon chasm in 1999. Here, he’s an older man in his late 50s – a body battered by epic motorcycle crashes – who simply wants to see a Bigfoot. Knievel died in January.\n\n“I’m definitely going to see one, have a beer with them, maybe a Twinkie, just so I can say I did,” Knievel says from the driver’s seat of a luxury bus.\n\nUnfortunately, seeing one is not that easy, and not much effort is expended by the crew in trying to find a Bigfoot. There’s only a brief one-night campout shown, and that doesn’t occur until 75 minutes into the 90-minute runtime. Knievel was not a serious Sasquatch seeker, but he felt a nostalgic curiosity for the creature.\n\nWhile we definitely don’t see a Sasquatch, we do get an interesting tour of the Bigfoot community around Bluff Creek, California, where the infamous Patterson-Gimlin film of 1967 was shot. That minute-long clip allegedly shows a female Bigfoot, nicknamed Patty, walking along the creek and into the woods. It’s either the greatest footage of a real Sasquatch or the greatest Bigfoot hoax.\n\nKnievel’s Quest follows the daredevil to Bigfoot Motel, Bigfoot Books, and the Willow Creek China Flat Museum & Bigfoot Collection. Along the way, we spend time with some dedicated Bigfoot researchers like Steven Streufert of Bigfoot Books and James “Bobo” Fay of Finding Bigfoot fame. These men talk about the history of the Bluff Creek location. Fay’s tour of the museum gives Knievel a look at a variety of footprint casts and hair samples.\n\nThe documentary also shows interviews with witnesses, including a believable retired park ranger. The ranger says he saw a reddish-brown, human-sized juvenile Bigfoot for five to six seconds from 60 feet away. Fay shares his multiple sighting stories and shows Knievel the rugged terrain that Patterson and Gimlin would have had to navigate to shoot their film. Many claim that clip shows a man in a costume, not Bigfoot.\n\n“You’re telling me that two broke cowboys from Yakima, Washington, drove all the way down here,” Fay says. “They went 25 miles up this rugged canyon to fake a monkey suit? It doesn’t make any sense.”\n\nFinally, Fay takes Knievel to a secret location where they camp overnight with members of the Bluff Creek Project. They use branches to simulate tree knocks and perform vocalizations. It’s short and sweet and nothing happens.\n\nThe most interesting segment of Knievel’s Quest is about the Bluff Creek Project. For more than a decade, the group has used trail cameras to record animal activity. One of the most remarkable successes of the trail camera survey is capturing footage of the once-thought extinct Humboldt marten, a member of the weasel family.\n\n“We’ve got just about every animal that’s known in this area on these cameras,” says Bluff Creek Project researcher Rowdy Kelley. “We’ve even gotten a Humboldt marten. These things were thought extinct at one time. We’ve got hundreds of videos now of this breeding pair. So, in that sense, one day there might be a chance that a Bigfoot will walk in front of our cameras. This is what stimulates us to keep this going, because if we can get a Humboldt marten … maybe we’ll find a Bigfoot one day. That’s why we have these cameras running 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.”\n\nReleased in 2020, Knievel’s Quest: Bigfoot is available to watch for free on ad-supported streaming services Tubi and YouTube.\n\nNEXT UP: Chapter Sixty-One: I interview the Midwest’s first all-female Bigfoot expedition team, SHE-Squatchers.\n\nTHE BIGFOOT FILES\n\nReview by Staff Writer Megan Starrak\n\n“The devil made me do it.” Wrongdoers have used this reason for doing terrible things for centuries. But in 1981, it was used as a legal defense in Connecticut. Arne Cheyenne Johnson was accused of stabbing his landlord, Alan Bono, to death. He claimed the devil possessed him at the time. This sensational story is at the heart of The Conjuring 3: The Devil Made Me Do It.\n\nThe film opens with Ed and Lorraine Warren, played for a third time by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, attending the exorcism of a young boy named David Glatzel. During the height of the exorcism, which included back-breaking contortions on the part of David, a literal shower of blood, and the demon trying to stop Ed’s heart, Arne tells the demon to take him. The demon obliges him, and young David is seemingly released. Viewers never see David at the film’s end, so we are left assuming the child is okay. Then, for a time, the film follows Arne, who is now possessed by the demon. He hallucinates, sees a creepy woman, and hears voices. He ultimately kills his landlord, which is what happened in real life.\n\nThen the movie takes a careening left away from the real story. The rest of the movie focuses on a curse placed on the Glatzel family, by a former member of the Disciples of the Ram, a Satanic cult. The curse involves the discovery of a creepy skull that is found under Glatzel’s home. The effort to break the curse, and save Arne who is under its influence, leads Ed and Lorraine on a side quest in Danvers, Massachusetts, to help solve a murder and missing person’s case. Ultimately, this other story weighs down what could be a terrifying movie about a young boy being possessed and what happened in the aftermath.\n\nThe Conjuring movies are based on the case files of Ed and Lorraine Warren, so how much of the third film is accurate? Unlike the first two films, which had more of a foundation in the truth of their stories, the third movie might not have much truth at all. It’s all based on whose story you believe. David Glatzel’s brother Carl, who was left out of the film, went public some years ago, claiming the possession of David was a hoax. Lorraine Warren responded to those claims by saying she had proof that several priests had been in the home performing an exorcism on David. Whatever happened, the Glatzel family is said to have been torn apart by the events.\n\nSo, if David Glatzel’s possession was just a hoax, where does that leave Arne Cheyenne Johnson? His defense lawyers placed the blame on the murder of his landlord squarely on the shoulders of demon possession. Now, I know demon possession as a defense is farfetched. It’s no wonder Johnson’s case is the only one on record to use it. There were indications that Johnson and those close to him knew it wasn’t true. The police officers who arrested Johnson claimed the murder followed a drunken fight between the two men over Johnson’s fiancé Debbie Glatzel, David’s sister. And Debbie was heard exclaiming that that’s just how Arne was when he had been drinking.\n\nThe two key figures, Glatzel and Johnson, have lived quietly since the incident. But for the rest of the world, questions about what happened in 1981 continue to swirl. Fans of the film series have now turned their attention to the 2024 release of The Conjuring: Last Rites. I, for one, am curious to see what this one will be about, and I will be looking into how much is based on stories from the Warrens’ case files.\n\nThe 2019 horror film Hoax is an exercise in tonal shifts. It starts briefly as a raunchy campfire slasher, quickly morphs into a Bigfoot creature feature, and ends with a darkly deranged Texas Chainsaw Massacre vibe.\n\nCollege student/mountain climber Alex Barnes opens the movie, standing around a campfire with five other college students, saying, “I don’t want to scare anyone, but I’m going to give it to you straight about Bigfoot.”\n\nNice start, but Bigfoot is the one giving it to them as the creature attacks the camp in a bloody rampage. Bodies are found, but one camper, the aforementioned Alex, is missing. She was the only camper not interested in sex, so there’s a chance she’ll survive if you know the rules of horror movies. Thanks, Scream.\n\nNext, we meet a TV producer named Paxton, who’s desperate to revive his career. He uses mysterious drone footage found at the campsite to successfully lobby for a reality show to find proof of Bigfoot.\n\nThe producer gathers his team together, and the group of eight is dropped off by helicopter deep in the Colorado wilderness near the scene of what the media is calling the mountaineering massacre. Among the group of eight are a cryptozoologist, a prima donna journalist, a primate specialist, a security guard, and the father of missing camper Alex.\n\nThe cryptozoologist sets up trail cams, inserts tracking devices in bait, uses pheromones to attract Bigfoot, and blasts animal vocalizations into the forest. After the first night, a team member disappears, leaving only a blurry camera shot and a trail of blood that leads to a cave filled with bones.\n\nThe action gets hairier over the next two nights as the team endures more attacks by Bigfoot. Trail cams are ripped down, and an 18-inch footprint is left behind. The team’s production tent is trashed, and the satellite phone goes missing. It’s all typical creature-feature fare until the frantic climax when survivors spy a cabin in the woods, and we get that second tonal shift I mentioned earlier. All I can say is hold on to your skin, folks.\n\nWith an IMDb rating of only 3.8 (out of 10), Hoax is not well reviewed, but I enjoyed it. The movie is better than most of the low-budget viewing options for us Bigfoot enthusiasts.\n\nI thought director Matt Allen effectively incorporated all the Bigfoot tropes, including thermal imaging cameras, to maintain suspense throughout the film. I loved the truly devastating shot of how Alex’s fate is revealed. And kudos to Allen for the most original use of soul duo Robert & Johnny’s 1958 song “We Belong Together” in a horror scene. Also, the opening credits sequence is superb.\n\nAmong the highlights of the acting were Cheryl Texiera, who plays feisty primate specialist Dr. Ellen Freese, and a brief appearance by legendary horror queen Adrienne Barbeau (The Fog). Incidentally, Barbeau was in another Sasquatch movie the year before titled Big Legend (which I reviewed here). And it’s always fun to see Brian Thompson’s scowl on the screen. He plays a no-nonsense security expert, but I remember him best as the alien bounty hunter in The X-Files.\n\nHoax is available to watch free on the ad-supported streaming service Tubi.\n\nNEXT UP: Chapter Sixty: Knievel’s Quest: Bigfoot. I review the 2020 documentary directed by Warren Croyle and Rick Wallen.\n\nTHE BIGFOOT FILES\n\nReview By Megan Starrak\n\nIn 2016, The Conjuring 2 was released, following the first film’s success. In this second installment, Ed and Lorraine Warren, played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, travel to London to investigate a haunted house. The movie contains a multi-faceted story about a haunted family, a demonic nun, and Lorraine’s terrifying premonition during a previous investigation. Like the first movie, though, how much of it was based on fact, and how much was the creation of the writers?\n\nThe film is based on the Enfield Haunting, which occurred between 1977 and 1978. Single mother Peggy Hodgson and her children Margaret, Janet, Johnny, and Billy were the family involved. The movie plays out real-life events in the scene where Peggy enters her daughters’ room, and a dresser moves on its own. In an interview, Peggy said, “I pushed it back twice, and a third time I couldn’t move it.” But more activity occurred in the Hodgson home than dressers moving on their own. First, witnesses saw objects move, and then there were the voices that could be heard in various rooms. Throughout the events, Janet seemed to be the focus of the haunting. At times she spoke with the voice of an old man, as seen in the movie, and witnesses recounted seeing her levitated off the floor. However, even with witnesses talking about the unexplainable things they had seen, there were questions about the whole thing being a hoax.\n\nThe movie touches upon this uncertainty. Some felt that Janet was making the old man’s voice herself. But the most compelling evidence came from Janet, who confessed that she and her siblings faked paranormal events, but only “two percent” of the time. The movie addresses this controversy but, in the end, lands fully on the side of it being an actual haunting.\n\nAlthough I enjoyed the movie and have seen it several times, I feel it was two movies trying to be one. The Enfield Haunting case is terrifying on its own, and I think there was more than enough material for the writers to build a more solid story. It was the addition of the nun Valak that felt forced. Even though I find the nun terrifying in her own right, she felt clunkily placed within the confines of this film. And the connection at the end seemed awkwardly forced. But the cast, led by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, was terrific, especially Madison Wolfe’s powerhouse performance as Janet.\n\nUltimately, The Conjuring captures the raw terror the Hodgson family felt while living in the house. From the appearances of The Crooked Man with his little song that invades your head for days to the sight of Janet tangled up within the walls of the house, the movie has frights aplenty. But in the end, it sacrifices the story’s truth for a happy Hollywood ending.\n\nSome will say that this article is just an excuse to gush over a film which vanished under the radar and should be far more widely seen and appreciated by the film-watching populous. I would argue that they’re absolutely right, in every way. It’s gory, got lashings of black comedy, but also contains much more poignancy and pathos than it might appear on first appearance. Prevenge is an overlooked gem.\n\nConceived by British independent cinema stalwart Alice Lowe (of Sightseers fame, she’s also Timothy Dalton’s bubble-gum-blowing employee in Hot Fuzz, the one Olivia Colman whacks with a Wet Floor sign near the end), whilst she was several months pregnant, the film follows Ruth, a pregnant mother who’s recently lost her husband on the same day she discovered she was pregnant. Now, obeying her unborn child’s psychopathic, profanity-ridden wishes, she goes out on a killing spree across the city to take revenge on those she feels responsible for her husband’s death.\n\nWhat makes Prevenge such a work of genius (despite being conceived of and shot in the space of only several months, whilst Lowe, who wrote, directed, and starred was pregnant), is the multiple generic layers that create it.\n\nOn the one hand, it’s very much a slasher film. It’s got the synth score reminiscent of Giallo films, the kind of thing you might expect from Goblin or Fabio Frizzi. There’s enough gore to satisfy, with blood and brains and bodies splattered around the screen to keep the bloodhounds happy. Tension-filled scenes permeate from the opening kill to a seedy flat with DJ Dan, and the score helps to give it the kind of grimy, underground, 42nd Street feel that films of the 70s and 80s had in abundance. In that way, it’s a delight for horror fans because there is a dreamy reminiscence about it.\n\nThere are also lashings of biting black comedy pervading throughout. This is prevalent not just from the unborn baby calling the couple in the hotel room next door, “‘selfish b*stards’” with their lively nighttime activities, and calling an insurance woman a ‘“merciless, frigid b*tch,”’ which are, obviously, immensely funny spoken by the high-pitched voice of a baby. It’s also there in the quiet moments, and through the wonderful dialogue Lowe has written for Alice. The interplay between herself and the midwife, with Lowe’s absolute deadpan delivery, makes for some of the best cringe-comedy found in a horror film. And when Lowe manages to break out lines such as ‘“I am a working mother”’ to a woman she’s got a knife-point, and responding to claims the baby can’t hear her with ‘“She’s very articulate,”’ you know there’s a genius behind the lens with an ear for finding humour in evil.\n\nAnd yet, what makes Prevenge so great is that, behind it all, it is a kind of Shakespearean tragedy. It is a character study of a woman struggling with grief, the loneliness of being abandoned to make her own way in the world at the time when she needs it most. She’s constantly got a photograph of Matt, her husband. When she’s dancing with DJ Dan at the pub, she’s got tears streaming down her face behind his back. When she’s with the midwife, she says to her that ‘“I would swap her to have him back.”’ Partially this wish for the swap is so she wouldn’t have to follow the baby’s instructions and kill people, but mostly because what should be joyful, the discovery of being pregnant has been soured and darkened by tragedy. The baby is the antithesis of her husband, everything she despises, brought together in one entity and tethered to her. The grief, embodied by the baby, controls her. Indeed, she describes it as a ‘“hostile takeover.”’\n\nPrevenge is therefore not, at its heart, about an evil baby, though it is of course about an evil baby. It is not about the terrors of motherhood, though it is of course about the terrors of motherhood. It is, at its heart, about how we rationalise grief and anger and rage at the world. It is about where we place our darkness, how we come to terms with loss, and how, if leaving it unchecked, it can overwhelm us. Whether one chooses to view the film as supernatural or not, Prevenge is an incredible film because it isn’t about being a comedy horror film. It’s not about the guts or the blood. It’s about learning how to deal with grief. With sorrow. Learning how to let go. In many ways, the horror genre, with such a close connection to death, does this better than any other genre, and Prevenge is a remarkable demonstration of such power.\n\n-Article by Kieran Judge\n\n-Twitter/Instagram/Blog/etc: kjudgemental\n\nThe 2022 film A Flash of Beauty: Bigfoot Revealed is one of the best documentaries about Sasquatch I’ve watched. Yes, it features the obligatory eyewitness accounts and the usual experts, but the film is elevated by director Brett Eichenberger’s thoughtful approach to the subject matter.\n\nEichenberger, along with co-writers Brian Landon and Jill Remensnyder, manages to keep the feature-length documentary compelling throughout its 90-minute runtime with quality interviews intercut with lingering overhead shots of the forest, always reminding us how vast the wilderness truly is.\n\n“Less than 30 percent of North America has been actually walked by man,” says Faaruwq Muhammad, a computer scientist/data analyst. “What is in those areas?”\n\nA Flash of Beauty delves deeper into the Wild Man stories of the indigenous people than most Sasquatch docs and features more than two dozen wide-ranging interviews. Eichenberger leaves no stone unturned as he interviews several credible researchers and experiencers (including one who claims Bigfoot grabbed his head through a tent). He also interviews the creator of the Bigfoot Mapping Project; a crypto linguist; a wildlife biologist; a clinical psychologist; and a certified hypnotherapist.\n\nUnfortunately, the film doesn’t feature much footage of Bigfoot that we haven’t seen before. Of course, the Patterson-Gimlin film’s most famous shot of a female Sasquatch is shown. There’s a night video of a Sasquatch sitting in briars in southern Missouri as well as a 1988 photo from Washington. A plumber shares a blurry trail cam photo and a picture of what looks like a chimpanzee lounging in a tree. We hear the eerie Sierra Sounds again as Ron Morehead talks about the purported Bigfoot vocalizations that he recorded in 1971. And there are photos of nests and tree structures in the forests that some researchers attribute to Bigfoot.\n\nWithout any exciting video or photographic footage to view, A Flash of Beauty focuses on the stories of Bigfoot. And there’s plenty to tell.\n\nI thought the 19th-century historical accounts by artist Paul Kane and missionary Elkanah Walker from their interactions with Native Americans were fascinating.\n\nHowever, the most captivating interview is with “Kyle,” a former U.S. Army intelligence officer. Kyle said he knew at least four Bigfoot bodies were transported to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for autopsies.\n\n“I do know that the U.S. government has knowledge of the Sasquatch,” says Kyle, speaking on condition of anonymity. “I do know for a fact that the 2nd Ranger (Battalion) have on many occasions had to take out a few Sasquatch for public safety. I personally didn’t go out in the field with them, but I saw the after-action review reports.”\n\nAnother highlight is the interview clips with Peter Byrne, a legendary Bigfoot researcher who spent three years in the Himalayas looking for the Yeti.\n\nThe film’s strength is the director’s ability to effectively convey the sincerity of his interview subjects in expressing how Bigfoot affects their lives. If the documentary’s goal is to justify why people should continue pursuing the elusive Sasquatch, it succeeds.\n\nBigfoot researcher Sonya Zohar summed it up best.\n\n“We have a being … in the biological record that is a ten-feet-tall upright walking ape,” says Zohar, referring to Gigantopithecus. “We have thousands of track casts that Dr. Jeffrey Meldrum collects. We have numerous reports from all kinds of people over many years in the United States as well as a complete cultural record of all indigenous cultures.”\n\nA Flash of Beauty: Bigfoot Revealed is available to watch free on the ad-supported streaming service Tubi.\n\nNEXT UP: Chapter Fifty-Nine: Hoax. I review the 2019 horror film directed by Matt Allen.\n\nTHE BIGFOOT FILES\n\nby Megan Starrak\n\nIn 2013, the motion picture The Conjuring, directed by James Wan and starring Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson, hit theaters, and the world of horror was changed forever. Based on a paranormal case that Ed and Lorraine Warren investigated, the movie told the story of a house in Rhode Island and the Perron family. But what percentage of the film happened, and what was fiction?\n\nIn 1971, the Perron family consisting of parents Roger and Carolyn and their five daughters Andrea, Christine, Nancy, Cynthia, and April, moved into an old farmhouse in Harrisville, Rhode Island. The 3000 square foot 14-room house was built around 1736 and has been known by several names, including the Old Arnold Estate and Old Brook Farm. In a 2021 interview, Andrea Perron told how she and her sisters saw the spirit of a man in the dining room the day the family moved in. Other terrifying events occurred, including beds levitating and the family hearing voices and other strange sounds.\n\nThe Perrons endured the events of the house for ten years. It was a difficult time because of the paranormal events. What made it worse was that Roger Perron said he didn’t believe anything was happening. Only years later, he confessed that he had seen and heard things and felt unable to protect his family. In the same interview, Andrea recounts how her mother went from being young and beautiful to tired looking, frail, and thin. Her mother’s voice also changed, and she started dressing differently. Finally, sometime during their final autumn in the house, Carolyn told her husband that she would not survive another winter there.\n\nHowever, regarding The Conjuring, Andrea states that only 5% is actual truth, and the rest is pure fiction. The fiction begins with naming Bathsheba Sherman as the spirit who wreaked havoc on the family. The real Bathsheba Sherman lived about a mile from the farmhouse, and there’s no evidence that she ever lived in the Conjuring House. Andrea does not believe Bathsheba was the spirit tormenting the family. She thinks it was the spirit of Mrs. John Arnold, one of the original homeowners. Andrea feels like Mrs. Arnold felt threatened by Carolyn Perron for some reason and turned her wrath against her.\n\nAndrea Perron credits the writers of The Conjuring with creating a third story outside the ones regarding Bathsheba Sherman and Mrs. John Arnold. The movie combined the stories of the two women. The most apparent evidence of this melding is the scene where Lorraine, played by Vera Farmiga, sees a body hanging from a tree, and the audience is led to believe it is Bathsheba. However, historically, Mrs. John Arnold hung herself in the barn in 1797 at 93, whereas Bathsheba Sherman died at home following a stroke in 1885.\n\nAnother fabrication in the movie is that the Warrens helped the Perrons. It was, in fact, the opposite. Famous paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren unexpectedly showed up at the Perron house. They had been contacted by people outside the family who knew about the strange activity. During their work, the Warrens performed a séance in the house against the wishes of Roger Perron. During the séance, Carolyn’s chair was said to have risen off the floor and flown into the next room. Andrea Perron remembers believing that her mother had been killed because her head hit the floor so hard. Roger Perron threw the Warrens out of the house, and they never returned. Decades later, Andrea saw Lorraine, and during that encounter, Lorraine admitted that she and Ed had been in over their heads and mistakes had been made.\n\nThe Perron’s time at the farmhouse in Rhode Island spanned a decade, and the horror they experienced there changed their lives forever. But like other infamously haunted locations, the popularity of The Conjuring House has only grown since the movie’s release. When the house was sold in 2022, the final selling price was 27% over the asking price. The latest owner is still offering tours and investigations of the house to people hoping to encounter its ghostly occupants, who seem content to call the property home forever.\n\nDevil on the Mountain gets its name from the best dialogue in the movie.\n\n“My old man told me one thing that sure turned out to be true. No matter how hard you try, no matter how high you get in this life, there’s always going to be a devil on the mountain waiting to knock you back into your socks.”\n\nThe devil in this situation is Bigfoot.\n\nDevil on the Mountain is a low-budget creature feature with enough heart to elevate it to one of the better Bigfoot movies I’ve seen. The film is available to watch free on the ad-supported streaming service Tubi. It was also released in 2006 as Sasquatch Mountain on the TV channel then known as Sci Fi.\n\nProduced by Curb Entertainment in association with Grizzly Peak Films, Devil on the Mountain is directed by Steven R. Monroe, who helmed the outstanding 2010 remake of I Spit on Your Grave. With a 3.8 rating on IMDb and a 17% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, Devil on the Mountain is not a well-reviewed movie, but I enjoyed it.\n\nThe plot is basically the sheriff and his deputies chasing a band of bank robbers with a hostage into the woods where Bigfoot lives. Unfortunately, Bigfoot doesn’t care what side of the law you’re on, which forces the two groups to work together for survival.\n\nThe cast is filled with familiar faces, including veteran actors Lance Henriksen (Aliens) and Rance Howard (Ron Howard’s father). At one point, Henriksen calls the leader of the bank robbers Pumpkinhead, and that alone made it worth watching the 88-minute film for me. Henriksen, of course, starred in the 1988 cult classic Pumpkinhead.\n\nScream queen and former Yellow Power Ranger Cerina Vincent (Cabin Fever) plays a woman on the run from a bad relationship, and Craig Wasson (A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors) leads the bank robbers.\n\nThe movie opens with a tragic hit-and-run accident shot in found-footage style that shows us our first glimpse of Bigfoot. Flash forward 12 years later and we’re quickly introduced to the cast of characters: Sheriff Zeff and his deputies, the bank robbers, and out-of-towner Erin.\n\nThe bank robbers steal the money, but the getaway ends with a deputy shot. While speeding away from town, the criminals get into an automobile accident with Erin, who’s packed and leaving behind an abusive relationship.\n\nNow on foot, the bank robbers decide to take Erin hostage and escape into the woods. Meanwhile, the sheriff, his deputies, and a crusty old tracker named Eli give chase. Twenty-five minutes into the movie, Bigfoot appears for his first attack.\n\nEventually, everyone ends up at an old lodge, trying to survive the creature’s attacks. Kudos to costume designer Wade Rikert as he created one of the better versions of Bigfoot on film. Most of the movie only shows glimpses of Bigfoot with quick edits, but at the end, we see Sasquatch in all his glory, and the creature’s impressive.\n\nThe acting is solid with scenes between Henriksen and his daughter ringing true. Wasson as the leader of the bank robbers gets to dig deep about his daddy issues. I personally liked the old-timers getting a chance to play heroes and delivering for the most part.\n\nThe climactic scene with Bigfoot hit me more emotionally than I expected, and the film wraps up a couple of other loose ends after the climax with good-hearted resolutions. In fact, I found the last shot of the movie to be a near-perfect symbol for how humans are more alike even when they think they’re so different.\n\nNEXT UP: Chapter Fifty-Eight: A Flash of Beauty: Bigfoot Revealed. I review the 2022 documentary directed by Brett Eichenberger.\n\nTHE BIGFOOT FILES\n\nConsidering multiple Oscar-winning director Francis Ford Coppola got his first proper directing credit with Dementia 13, a Psycho knock-off produced by Roger Corman with left-over money from another shoot, one would think that this is the place to go. However, it turns out that if you really want to see how to get inside the head of a murderer, all you have to do is go to one of the most famous scenes in cinema, Michael’s first hit in The Godfather\n\n.To recap for those who have forgotten, or haven’t seen it, let me set the stage. Michael Corleone, son of the eponymous ‘Godfather’ Vito Corleone, head of the Corleone mob family, is set to make his first hit. Taken to a restaurant, frisked all over, he eventually leaves to go to the bathroom, where he receives a gun hidden in the toilet cistern tank. Then armed, he goes back to eat. The pressure mounts and mounts, and when he can take it no longer, he shoots his target and leaves.\n\nWhen planning how to shoot the film, Coppola and sound design technician Walter Murch (who wo"
