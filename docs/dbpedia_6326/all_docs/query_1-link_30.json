        "text": "Russia’s excess death toll since the start of the coronavirus pandemic climbed to 723,000 even before the latest and most deadly wave of the virus took hold across the country, analysis of official government data shows.\n\nThe Rosstat government statistics office said Friday that 201,945 people died from all causes during the month of September — 45% more than during the same month of 2019.\n\nIt was the seventh time since the start of the pandemic when the number of monthly fatalities in Russia surpassed 200,000 — a level not seen on a single occasion during the previous 12 years.\n\nThe figures take Russia’s excess death toll between the start of the pandemic and the end of September 2021, the most recent available data, to 723,350, according to The Moscow Times’ analysis of official statistics.\n\nNew infections and hospitalizations have since surged as the coronavirus spread aggressively through a largely unvaccinated population in October. President Vladimir Putin has imposed a week-long national public holiday in a bid to stem the spread of the virus and relieve pressure on the country’s healthcare system. Some regions, including the capital Moscow and second city of St. Petersburg, have imposed partial lockdowns, closing all non-essential businesses.\n\nRussian officials have been accused of drastically downplaying the human toll of the coronavirus.\n\nAccording to the government’s pandemic task force, which publishes daily statistics on the number of new infections and deaths over the previous 24-hour period, the number of Covid-19 fatalities during the same period was 206,000.\n\nA broader measure, published monthly by Rosstat, says 351,000 people died as a result of the coronavirus, with the virus present in another 111,000 deaths, but not deemed the main cause of death — a counting methodology which runs counter to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.\n\nDemographers and statisticians say excess deaths — a measure which compares total fatalities from all causes with a pre-pandemic baseline — is the gold standard to measure how many lives have likely been lost to the pandemic.\n\nRussia has one of the world’s highest excess deaths tallies, both on an absolute basis and after adjusting for population. Some independent demographers and statisticians, including Dmitry Kobak of Tubingen University in Germany and former Rosstat demographer Alexei Raksha, say the figure of 723,350 is likely an underestimate of the number who have succumbed to the disease in Russia.\n\nSince Russia’s mortality rate has been significantly declining in recent years, this trend would have been expected to continue without the pandemic, they state, meaning fewer deaths from other causes are likely to have occurred.\n\nKobak and Israeli statistician Ariel Karlinsky estimate Russia has the world’s highest excess death toll overall, and third highest on a per-capita basis after Peru and Bulgaria.\n\nOverall, Russia has recorded 26% more fatalities since the start of the pandemic than during the same months of 2019.\n\nJust a third of Russians are fully vaccinated, according to an official government tally, despite vaccines having been widely available for free since the start of the year. Independent polls show around half of the population do not intend to receive a vaccine.\n\nRussia has been using its own Sputnik V vaccine along with a handful of other domestically-produced jabs to inoculate its population. None have yet been approved by the WHO or other landmark medical regulators, such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA).\n\nA Message from The Moscow Times:\n\nDear readers,\n\nWe are facing unprecedented challenges. Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has designated The Moscow Times as an \"undesirable\" organization, criminalizing our work and putting our staff at risk of prosecution. This follows our earlier unjust labeling as a \"foreign agent.\"\n\nThese actions are direct attempts to silence independent journalism in Russia. The authorities claim our work \"discredits the decisions of the Russian leadership.\" We see things differently: we strive to provide accurate, unbiased reporting on Russia.\n\nWe, the journalists of The Moscow Times, refuse to be silenced. But to continue our work, we need your help.\n\nYour support, no matter how small, makes a world of difference. If you can, please support us monthly starting from just $2. It's quick to set up, and every contribution makes a significant impact.\n\nBy supporting The Moscow Times, you're defending open, independent journalism in the face of repression. Thank you for standing with us.\n\nOnce\n\nMonthly\n\nAnnual\n\nContinue\n\nNot ready to support today?\n\nRemind me later.\n\n×\n\nRemind me next month\n\nRemind me\n\nThank you! Your reminder is set.\n\nWe will send you one reminder email a month from now. For details on the personal data we collect and how it is used, please see our Privacy Policy."
