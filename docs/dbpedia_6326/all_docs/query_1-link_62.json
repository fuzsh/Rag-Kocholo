        "text": "Online Orson Welles course: The Other Side of the Shadow (Returning September 1, 2024)\n\nTHE OTHER SIDE OF THE SHADOW:\n\nA NEW LOOK AT ORSON WELLES\n\nA 12-WEEK ONLINE FILM STUDIES COURSE\n\n(Autumn, 2024)\n\nPRESENTED BY MATTHEW ASPREY GEAR\n\nThis original 12-week online film studies course, delivered via the Google Meet platform, is designed for new and old Orson Welles fans. We’re going to have a lot of fun as we dive deeply into the work of one of the 20th century’s greatest filmmakers.\n\nThe lectures cover the key Welles masterpieces — Citizen Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons, Touch of Evil, and Chimes at Midnight — but will also explore some of the lesser-known films and TV programs, including many works that have appeared posthumously (and many unproduced screenplays that have never been published). I’m also eager to share the discoveries I’ve made in the Orson Welles archives in Turin, Munich, Michigan, and Indiana while researching my book At the End of the Street in the Shadow: Orson Welles and the City (Columbia University Press, 2016) and other publications.\n\nEach week I’ll give an original fifty-minute lecture presentation on a set film and topic and then lead an in-depth group discussion. All students will have a chance to contribute. The only weekly homework will be to watch a film (or two) in preparation for the session. There will be no final exam or essay. This course is designed for enjoyment and discovery. All are welcome.\n\nThe group will be limited to a maximum of 12 participants.\n\nWeekly session: Sundays at 9am PT/12pm ET [North America] (which is 5pm UK time/6pm CET).\n\nPrice per student: US$160 (or £125). Please email me at matthewaspreygear@gmail.com to book your place in the course.\n\nLECTURE PLAN\n\nSeptember 1\n\nLecture 1: Introduction – The Myths and the Man\n\nMovie: MAGICIAN: THE ASTONISHING LIFE AND WORK OF ORSON WELLES (documentary, 2014)\n\nA: WELLES’S STYLE AND METHODS\n\nSeptember 8\n\nLecture 2: Orson and Film Noir\n\nMovie: THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI (1947)\n\nSeptember 15\n\nLecture 3: Inventing Independent Film\n\nMovies: FILMING OTHELLO (1978); ORSON WELLES: ONE-MAN BAND (documentary, 1995)\n\n* ONE WEEK BREAK *\n\nSeptember 29\n\nLecture 4: The Essay Film\n\nMovie: F FOR FAKE (1973); IT’S ALL TRUE: BASED ON AN UNFINISHED FILM BY ORSON WELLES (documentary, 1993)\n\nOctober 6\n\nLecture 5: Return to Hollywood\n\nMovie: THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIND (1970-76/2018)\n\nB: WELLES’S WORLD\n\nOctober 13\n\nLecture 6: Orson’s 19th Century: Dinesen, Conrad, Melville, and Stevenson\n\nMovie: THE IMMORTAL STORY (1968); Screenplay reading: THE DREAMERS (c. 1979)\n\nOctober 20\n\nLecture 7: Orson Across Europe\n\nMovie: MR.

I can only recommend it!”\n\n– Matthijs Wouter Knol, CEO and Director, European Film Academy\n\n“Matthew is an excellent researcher and lecturer. He put Welles and his films into a fascinating historical context that has greatly enhanced my viewing experience.”\n\n– Charles\n\n“The class was a wonderful opportunity to learn more about the lesser known details of Welles’s career and to discourse over his films with like-minded enthusiasts!”\n\n– Tyler, Chicago\n\n“Matthew is very generous in sharing the fruits of the deep archival research he has done on Orson Welles. His expertise about his subject is plain to see and his thorough command of knowledge about Welles reaches well beyond the man’s work as a filmmaker to the many other media he worked in (theatre, television, radio, etc.). Matthew’s lectures are deeply informative and visually interesting. He is particularly good at drawing hidden thematic and historical connections between seemingly disparate projects in Welles’s work, helping to reveal the kernels of new ways to think about Welles as an artist. He is a great facilitator of the conversation portion of the class, helping to keep the conversation lively and guiding us toward stimulating subjects.”\n\n– Jesse\n\n“Matthew Asprey Gear’s 12-week course was an opportunity to have an expert guide lead me through both familiar and obscure corners of Welles’s work. The format was an inviting way for both Welles neophytes and old Wellesians to join in a learning community and explore the unendingly fascinating films and life of a great artist.”\n\n– Josh, Texas\n\n“It’s Terrific! Matthew Asprey Gear brings a wealth of Orson Welles research from firsthand sources and illuminates even the most ardent Welles fans. Come for the informative deep-dive lectures and stay for the lively discussions about Welles’ s many noses, wigs, cheap sets, and bad accents — and of course, the undeniable genius present in most of his films.”\n\n– Christian, Fort Lauderdale\n\n“I highly recommend Matthew’s online Orson Welles course, for both beginners and seasoned Wellesians. The course brings new perspectives and insights to Welles’ extraordinary career.”\n\n– Ronan, Galway\n\n“There was a sense of discovery even for someone who’s been interested in Orson Welles for more than a decade. A carefully planned structure made the course very intriguing.”\n\n–Petri, Finland\n\n“If you are an old Welles fan it is certainly a great opportunity to review and discuss his work and expand your knowledge on unrealized projects, screenplays, literary influences and the diverse facets of his life and work. If you are new to Orson Welles… lucky you! You will be in the right place to have a great overview of his extraordinary work that is certainly not limited to Citizen Kane. In both cases, fun and enjoyment are guaranteed!”\n\n– Elliot, Switzerland\n\n“It was like knocking at the door where Orson is sleeping and wake him up with sweets and going down in the garden with the dog for a walk each Monday. Sometimes we talk sometimes we just walk, and it’s great the same.”\n\n– Emiliano, Rome\n\n“Incomplete projects and hired-gun work in Welles’ filmography have usually worked against his reputation. But Welles scholars and aficionados, Matthew Asprey Gear among them, find in those inexhaustible plans, projects, and versions-of-projects, an artistic strength. If the truism is true that artworks are never completed, only abandoned, then Welles more than most artists gives us a rare chance to engage living projects as something more than a passive viewer. At least this is true of “The Magnificent Ambersons” or “Mr. Arkadin” or “Other Side of the Wind” – and of course Welles has just as many “traditionally completed” films as “Kane”, “Chimes at Midnight”, “The Trial”, etc. (Somewhere in between lay “F For Fake”, a finished film definitively about incompletion and fragmented points of view!) In any case, Matthew Asprey Gear’s class offers a robust survey of the completed and the uncompleted in Welles’ oeuvre, using the former to better understand the latter; and offering details from the archives at Michigan and Indiana and Munich one normally wouldn’t be able to come by (for instance, the weekly “unproduced screenplay of the week” feature). Highly recommended!”\n\n– Marc, San Francisco\n\nOnline course: Phases of Science Fiction Cinema (Starting August 18)\n\nIn this original 12–week online film studies course, to be delivered via the Google Meet platform, we’ll study the history of a genre through 20 features and 3 shorts. We’ll discuss globe–spanning science fiction films from the USA, UK, the former Czechoslovakia, Germany, France, the former USSR, Rwanda, and Japan.\n\nClasses are limited to a maximum of 12 students. Each week I’ll give an original lecture presentation and then lead an in–depth group discussion. All participants will have a chance to contribute. The only weekly homework will be to watch a film (or two) in your own time. There will be no final exam or essay.

The selection includes works by directors such as Jean Cocteau, Luis Buñuel, Ingmar Bergman, Georges Méliès, Kenji Mizoguchi, Hayao Miyazaki, Maya Deren, Jean Rollin, Georges Franju, Jacques Rivette, Mario Bava, and David Lynch.\n\nThe class is limited to a maximum of 12 students. Each week I’ll give an original lecture presentation and then lead an in-depth group discussion. All participants will have a chance to contribute. The only weekly homework will be to watch a film (or two) in your own time and sometimes read a short piece. There will be no final exam or essay. This course is designed for exploration and discovery.\n\nWeekly session: Saturdays at 12pm PT/3pm ET (North America)\n\n(8pm UK time/9pm CET)\n\nPrice per student: US$160.

We’ll also study the careers of legendary directors such as John Ford, Clint Eastwood, Sergio Leone, Sam Peckinpah, Anthony Mann, and Budd Boetticher.
