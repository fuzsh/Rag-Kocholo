        "text": "Exploring five monstrous archetypes – beast, witch, ghost, vampire and zombie – our season of horror films will be in cinemas across the UK, at BFI Southbank, BFI IMAX, on Blu-ray and on BFI Player.\n\n21 September 2022\n\nIn Dreams Are Monsters is a major BFI UK-wide film and events season celebrating the horror genre on screen, taking place from 1 October to 31 December in cinemas nationwide, at BFI Southbank (from 17 October to 31 December), BFI IMAX, on BFI Player and with a tie-in major BFI Blu-ray release. It is supported by National Lottery, BFI Film Audience Network and the ICO.\n\nIn Dreams Are Monsters coincides with two big screen horror re-releases, both of which will be screening at BFI Southbank. It’s the 40th anniversary of Tobe Hooper’s all-time horror classic Poltergeist (1982) and the 20th anniversary of Alejandro Amenábar’s double BAFTA nominated The Others (2002), which features a chilling performance from Nicole Kidman.\n\nGet the latest from the BFI\n\nSign up for BFI news, features, videos and podcasts.\n\nEmail\n\nIn Dreams Are Monsters is a fresh, inventive and inclusive take on the horror genre tracing how the imagery of nightmare has been created through film, and how stories of monsters have always been political. Through five mythical horror archetypes – the beast, ghost, vampire, witch and zombie – In Dreams Are Monsters explores how these monstrous bodies have been represented on screen over the last hundred years and how they have been reclaimed by new voices in horror filmmaking.\n\nEach archetype doesn’t so much inform a subgenre as it does a taste for horror; whether it be the creatures that lurk in the shadows, or those that come from within, the beasts of cinema are our darkest fears made flesh. The witch threatens the patriarchy with her alternative, gendered power: her magic and sexuality destabilise the masculinist social order. The ghost embodies the silenced classes: a domestic sign of broader, social horrors taking place. Vampires, the most seductive of monster archetypes, blur the lines between horror, action, eroticism and romance, while the zombie is the most overtly politicised of all cinematic monsters, a rotting blank canvas for social commentary.\n\nIn Dreams Are Monsters promises something for everyone, the horror aficionado as well as the horror novice: tales of blood and seduction; of glorious, excessive gore; of teenagers turned monstrous and of the dead risen and angry.\n\nIn Dreams Are Monsters represents a genuinely inclusive and diverse range of voices, with highlights from the BFI Southbank programme including a Halloween double bill celebrating the work of queer writer/director Clive Barker. A 35th anniversary screening of his deliciously debauched directorial debut Hellraiser (1987) introduced by actors Nicholas Vince and Simon Bamford with BFI governor and curator of The Clive Barker Archive, Phil Stokes, will play alongside director’s cut of Barker’s singular second feature as director, Nightbreed (1990). A screening of Let the Right One In (2008) will be preceded by a discussion on trans representation within the genre in partnership with Trans on Screen, and a selection of Queer Horror and Experimental Magic Films, drawn from the BFI National Archive, will screen as part of BFI Southbank’s Experimenta strand.\n\nThere is also a triple bill of landmark Black vampire horror classics – a 50th anniversary screening of William Crain’s Blacula (1972), Bill Gunn’s Ganja & Hess (1973) and James Bond III’s Def by Temptation (1990), plus screenings of Bernard Rose’s original Candyman (1992), Jordan Peele’s modern alternative zombie film Us (2019). A rare screening of legendary Black horror filmmaker Richard C Kahn’s Son of Ingagi (1940) will be followed by a panel discussion on the history of Black horror, as well as from the wider African diaspora the world premiere of Clarence A. Peters’ thrilling new Nigerian drama series Inside Life, which is screening as part of film festival Film Africa 2022, and Mati Diop’s multi award-winning beguiling and haunting love story Atlantics (2019), merging contemporary issues of global inequality and the refugee crisis with themes of spiritual possession.\n\nThe BFI Southbank programme includes well-loved classic monsters such as Frankenstein (1931), Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954) in 3D, David Cronenberg’s vision of The Fly (1986), A Nightmare on Elm Street’s (1984) iconic vengeful villain Freddy Krueger, Ringu’s (1998) vengeful spirit as well as George A. Romero’s beloved zombie hordes Day of the Dead (1985). Lesser-seen gems include the nightmarish imagery of Russian witch horror Viy (1967), Mexican folk horror La llorona (1960), Japanese zombies running amok in One Cut of the Dead (2017), ghostly home invasion horror The Entity (1982) and Bruce McDonald’s fun take on the zombie trope Pontypool (2008). The season also includes remarkable debuts such as Babak Anvari’s supernatural Iran-Iraq war horror Under the Shadow (2016), Guillermo del Toro’s Cronos (1993), Agnieszka Smoczynska’s Polish mermaid horror The Lure (2015) and Liam Gavin’s Welsh spine chilling occult horror A Dark Song (2016).\n\nSpecial guests from the world of film and television will take part in events throughout the season. Guests confirmed for BFI Southbank so far, with more to be announced, include:\n\nOscar-winning director Danny Boyle will be on-stage for a Q&A following a special 20th anniversary screening of 28 Days Later (2002) with extra special guests to be announced.\n\nDirector Lesley Manning and writer Stephen Volk will join the BFI Southbank audience for an on-stage Q&A following the immersive 30th anniversary screening of Ghostwatch (1992) presented by Celluloid Screams and Live Cinema UK.\n\nAward-winning director and cinematographer Clarence A. Peters will be on-stage to present the world premiere of his thrilling new drama television drama series Inside Life (2022) as part of Film Africa 2022.\n\nAcclaimed author, critic, film programmer, podcaster, publisher and producer Kier-La Janisse, whose influential book House of Psychotic Women was published ten years ago, completes her UK-wide in-conversation tour presented by Matchbox Cine at BFI Southbank, followed by a screening of Andrzej Zulawski’s Possession (1981). The UK tour begins at the Weird Weekend festival at Centre for Contemporary Arts, Glasgow, and continue with events in Edinburgh, Nottingham, Sheffield, Manchester and Cardiff.\n\nThe programme also includes an In Dreams Are Monsters edition of Mark Kermode Live In 3D and BFI Southbank regular Adam Buxton will be infecting his live blend of music videos and comedy in a BUG: Video Nasties horror special. There will be a surprise film night with live commentary from horror podcasts Evolution of Horror, Brain Rot and The Final Girls, and the impact and popularity of horror video games will be celebrated with a day of cosplay, gaming and prizes hosted by GamePad.\n\nThe BFI IMAX cinema will be transformed into a spooky summer camp for an all-night sleepover in December. Before enjoying a marathon of cabin-themed slasher films on the biggest screen in Britain, audiences will be able to explore an interactive in venue summer camp. F.W. Murnau’s iconic take on Dracula, Nosferatu (1922), plays on the big screen in its centenary year with an introduction from the BFI’s silent film curator Bryony Dixon, along with a centenary screening of Benjamin Christensen’s legendary witches brew Häxan (1922) with live accompaniment. Further contextual events involve discussions around representations of Disability in horror, the “ghost in the machine” of television and modern technology, and a debate over the erotic allure of the monster.\n\nThe season will also feature a UK-wide programme of over 35 special events and screenings supported in partnership with the BFI Film Audience Network (BFI FAN) including these four special commissions by leading regional horror festivals and the ICO tour:\n\nMayhem Film Festival (Nottingham, 13 to 16 October) is presenting a “Night of the Cat” double bill exploring the mythology of the Bakeneko (monster-cat) which begins with Kaneto Shindo’s Kuroneko (1968) with live score from Nottingham-based artist Yumah and concludes with a 30th anniversary screening of Stephen King’s Sleepwalkers (1992).\n\nAbertoir (Aberystwyth, 15 to 20 and 25 to 27 November) is presenting a nationwide event celebrating the blaxploitation horror genre in partnership with the Bristol Black Horror Club.
