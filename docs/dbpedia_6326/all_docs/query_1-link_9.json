        "text": "The aim of the article is to give an overview of recent tendencies in contemporary Russian films by three widely recognized directors (Andrei Zvyagintsev, Vera Storozheva, Pavel Lungin) in the context of the representation of the problem of fear and safety. The films under discussion in this article are Storozheva’s Travelling with Pets (2007), Lungin’s Taxi Blues (1990) and Zvyagintsev’s Elena (2011). The main theme is discussed from the perspective of the individual character reflecting upon his or her own life as well as from the angle of the representation of the collective memory of the Russian nation. The main methodological tool is Mikhail Epstein’s concept of transculture. Epstein’s theory is associated with the logic of an open and universal continuum, the process of transcendence into “no-culture”, i.e. the development of the cultural unit that overcomes the borders of traditional cultures (ethnic, national, racial, religious, gender, sexual and professional etc.). It can be achieved by finding the way of liberation from ‘the prison of language’ and gradual learning about the inborn culture in order to reach an appropriate distance to penetrate it, truly understand and finally abandon. Epstein’s theory is based on the rejection of both ‘leveling globalism’ and ‘isolating pluralism’. Taking into account Epstein’s findings this article suggests that Zvyagintsev’s leitmotiv is an apocalyptic vision of the world devoid of moral values, which can be linked to the breakdown of the family unit and the loss of both cultural and historical continuum. Lungin turns attention to the areas of tradition and orthodox religion, whereas Storozheva is known for her visualizations of women fighting for their independence, which constitutes the foundation of their inner freedom and safety. In all the films fear remains the core emotion which accompanies the protagonists. Lungin’s creation of Shlykov’s Kaukiainen, K., Kurikka, K., Mäkelä, H., Nykänen, E., Nyqvist, S., Raipola, J., Riippa, A. & Samola, H. (eds) 522 character proves that fear and striving for psychological stability can remain pre-intentional and non-conscious although they strongly influence the protagonists’ actions and decisions. Lungin is interested in the mechanisms linking fear and other emotions such as melancholy and anger, trying to make the recipients aware that the liberating power of imagination and music, which is shown as the universal language, can be experienced only after understanding the need of cultural and historical transformation. Similar issues constitute also the core problem of Zvyagintsev’s film; Elena demonstrates fear and egoism as the elementary instinct and drive of people’s decisions in the societies, which have lost their moral directions. Consequently, Zvyagintsev’s narrative requires the ethical engagement of the audience, which stays in contrast to Storozheva’s work showing the protagonist who found the way to suppress and overcome the sources of social or personal limitations. As a result, Natalia’s approach to life could be seen as the manifestation of liberation and the attempt of at least partial realization of Epstein’s concept of transculture.\n\nAny approach to the past tailors our perception of the present, which is in turn inevitably elusive and unstable. The present is a site of contestation between memory and history, as well as a site for recounting the distant past by reflecting it through the prism of the present. The transition from the Soviet Union to independent states in 1991 triggered tensions within these newly created nation-states, with the collective and individual past being given a range of new interpretations. The connection between memory and identity obtained a renewed force. Russian ideologists have often considered Ukraine as an inalienable part of Russia; the disintegration of the Soviet Union implied only a formal separation in a common Russian worldview. Meanwhile, the new national policy of Ukraine was frequently oriented towards independence and closer cooperation with the European Union. Contrasting memories about the past contributed to the tension between the two Slavic peoples, which, paradox...\n\nThis edited collection is the first book to draw together a range of theoretical and critical approaches relating to the filmed human bodies of Eastern European and Russian cinema. While much research has been conducted within film studies into the representation of the body in Western European (and ‘world’) cinemas, much less attention has been paid to the bodies and sensations of Eastern European film. The collection examines representations of the body in Eastern European and Russian cinema (including the cinema of Poland, Hungary, former Czechoslovakia, and former Yugoslavia) after the Second World War, drawing on the history of the region and Western and Eastern scholarship on the body. It focuses on three areas: the traumatized body, the body as a site of erotic pleasure and the relationship between the body and history. It demonstrates how bodily discourses, oscillating between complicity and subversion, shaped individuals and societies during the period of state socialism an..."
