        "text": "Guest \"Star Turn\" Column\n\nby LARRY BLAMIRE\n\nOn impulse, I just revisited the short-lived western series THE DAKOTAS for the first time since Warner Archive released it in 2015. For a show that I regard so highly, I sure took the long way getting back to it. Perhaps it’s that frustration of something so exceptional having so brief a life. I wanted to see if I felt as strongly about it as I did back then, when I brazenly declared it My Single Favorite Western Series Of All Time.\n\nSurprisingly, I’d written/posted almost nothing about it. I guess I was looking for a way to put into words exactly why I love the dang thing so much. Was I honestly placing it above such cherished titles as GUNSMOKE, CIMARRON STRIP, HAVE GUN WILL TRAVEL, THE RIFLEMAN, THE WESTERNER, even my more obscure favorites like OUTLAWS (1960) and THE OUTCASTS (1968)? Or was this just a kneejerk call, fresh off the viewing? You know, your “favorite of the moment.” What was it about this show?\n\nThe fact that it was released on DVD at all is a miracle. It has no movie star lead, no Warners breakout player like James Garner or Clint Walker. Didn’t even last a full season (brutally yanked after 20 episodes). For the show’s small but passionate fanbase, the Warner Archive release is something to be grateful for, as I try to remind myself.\n\nI’d love to chat with William T. Orr, the legendary honcho who carved out classic Warners TV, but he’s no longer with us. I can’t help but think this was something special for the executive producer who liked to draw from literary sources (never more apparent than here).\n\nTHE DAKOTAS is unlike any other classic television western. It’s hard to imagine ABC/Warners replacing the ailing CHEYENNE mid-season with something so dark, so complex, so challenging. This, just over the crest of a massive TV oater wave that included Warners’ own stable of one-hours, CHEYENNE, MAVERICK, SUGARFOOT and BRONCO.\n\nWas Orr reaching for something more adult? Something closer to gutsy cerebral powerhouses like NAKED CITY or THE DEFENDERS? As odd as it may sound, THE DAKOTAS bears more kin to those contemporary dramas than to its fellow westerns. Its moody heightened realism feels genuine in the way that ROUTE 66 and MR. NOVAK feel genuine; profound affecting stories told with literate elevated dialogue that lifts the proceedings onto a larger stage. These are far from action-packed. Violence is sparse, usually sudden, always impactful. So impactful that public outcry got it cancelled in the space of a single week, to be swallowed up in obscurity just as quickly.\n\nTHE DAKOTAS is set, as one might guess, in the Dakota Territories and concerns four United States marshals tasked with policing a vast region that’s presented as harsh and unforgiving. Unlike other TV lawmen, Marshal Frank Ragan (Larry Ward) and deputy-marshals J.D. Smith (Jack Elam), Del Stark (Chad Everett) and Vance Porter (Michael Greene) have no home base, no Dodge City or Tombstone. They show up where needed, usually right in the middle of a powderkeg with a fast fuse. Episodes have tantalizing place-name titles, like “Trouble at French Creek,” “Crisis at High Banjo” and “Requiem at Dancer’s Hill.” Almost all of the shows feature all four protagonists, with focus slightly shifting among them. One of the show’s strengths is the notion of team effort, but a team that seldom sees eye-to-eye; these boys are human and flawed—often a source of intense conflict. An early episode has an argument between Ragan and Smith that goes on and on, growing surprisingly heated, and as I listened I realized neither of them was right. And both of them were.\n\nThis is something important at the heart of THE DAKOTAS. Black hats and white hats are not so easily identified. Things are generally gray. Moral ambiguity is the lifeblood, complexity the color, trickling right down to every supporting character. Every one of them has life, history. If Shakespeare wrote a western show this would be it. Its dialogue is terse yet poetic; everyday speech elevated to grand scale. Maybe that was too much for some viewers. Me? My ears get a contact high. There are a dozen quotable lines per show.\n\nTHE DAKOTAS was not a spinoff of CHEYENNE, but its pilot, “A Man Called Ragan,” was dropped into the latter’s schedule as a test run. In that first episode, adapted from a novel by Harry Whittington, Ragan wears an eyepatch (eliminated in the series). While it does act as an origin story, it doesn’t feel like one, as the characters (none of whom are acquainted) are entirely immersed in the central conflict. The town Ragan enters is dusty and perpetually windy, with a grim mood you can cut with a knife (I mean, the first person we see is Lee Van Cleef for gosh sakes). Director of photography Bert Glennon shoots it like a movie, with beautiful sharp black shadows (impressively, this movie look prevailed throughout the series, with Glennon and later Harold Stine). “A Man Called Ragan” is a powerful introduction, preparing us for the dramatic labyrinths to come.\n\nWhen THE DAKOTAS abruptly ended in May 1963 it was in response to a scene in “Sanctuary at Crystal Springs” where Smith and Stark rush into a church and gun down two killers, with a minister shot in the process. While that’s been cited as the trigger, it should also be noted that the series struggled in a virtually impossible time slot (7:30, Monday night) against some beloved hits. I also wouldn’t be surprised if budgets were a factor, given the detailed sets and art direction (incredibly, every town they go to looks different), name guest stars, large supporting casts and abundance of extras (all these towns are peopled!). What I cannot agree with, however, is the notion advanced by some that the lead actor was not compelling enough. That could not be farther from the truth.\n\nTHE DAKOTAS star Larry Ward.\n\nLarry Ward (1915-1985) was a writer (he cowrote “The Little Man Who Was There” episode of ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS) and playwright (produced in New York and London) who had also acted in a 50s soap, as well as on stage. As the story goes, he was discussing a script with producer Jules Schermer who thought him just right for a role in the Warner Brothers series “Lawman.” This led to him winning the lead in THE DAKOTAS.\n\nIt may be that some find his Marshal Frank Ragan a bit too brittle, somewhat lacking in charm. That’s exactly what I love about his performance. His Ragan is a relentless professional hard-ass, a rigid taskmaster who expects too much of everybody, including himself. He lives for the law. Until it doesn’t suit him. Then he hammers it into his own image. Thus, he’s at once more rigid than Marshal Matt Dillon, yet more likely to take liberties. This gives Ragan a tough unpredictability, darker than his contemporaries. Larry Ward bites off dialogue like pieces of metal; steely conviction backed by superior intelligence. And boy is he given some choice cuts. When someone tells Ragan he can’t stop a whole town, he promises, “I’ll stop the first six.”\n\nOn occasions when his character makes a late entrance there’s an expectation, a kind of “Uh-oh, what’ll Frank do?” that is really kind of infectious, like a predatory fish dropped into an unruly aquarium. One episode has Ragan and Smith appear out of the night in black rain slickers, accompanied by thunder and lightning; two avenging angels come to right things. Which leads us to someone even darker than Ragan.\n\nJack Elam as J.D. Smith.\n\nJ.D. Smith is the show’s dark prince, the devil on Marshal Ragan’s shoulder. I believe Jack Elam’s portrayal to be television’s first antihero. I’ve said it before, but had this series lasted two or three seasons Elam may have been the next western bad guy character actor breakout star, in the manner of James Coburn, Warren Oates and Lee Van Cleef. If you haven’t seen Jack Elam charismatically handling a complex series lead like it’s no big deal, then you are in for a treat.\n\nJ.D.'s introduction in the show's pilot episode.\n\nIn the pilot, J.D. Smith is a veteran gun-for-hire with a formidable reputation. His entrance is electrifying. Just as his name is spoken, CUT TO hawk screeching in foreground and J.D. appearing on horseback over background ridge. If the bird had a walkie it couldn’t have been better timed. His transformation to lawman is subtle and believable. Partly, I suppose, because he never really turns, not completely. That conflict lingers within this errant preacher’s son to become the source of some of the series’ best tension. And grim humor, sardonically delivered as only Elam can. It’s a great character, brilliantly portrayed. His interplay with Ward is some of the finest on television.\n\nChad Everett as Del Stark.\n\nIn some ways Chad Everett’s Del Stark is the angel opposite Smith’s devil. But, sophisticated series that it is, such is overly simplistic. This was a breakout role for Everett, who comes off impressively and earnestly as a struggling young idealist who’s his own worst enemy. As Smith amusingly put it, “That’s the trouble with arguing with Del. Even when he’s wrong he’s right.” Everett’s work here is untarnished and impressive.\n\nMichael Greene's Vance Porter.\n\nFinally, Michael Greene’s Vance Porter acts as a kind of laid-back buffer, the most generally easygoing of the four. But, on a show where nothing is simple, he’s also an impulsive bull in a china shop, a 6’ 5” volcano all too quick to rush in, and failed former sheriff just back from the bottle. Greene (until recently, the last cast member still with us) gave Porter a distinctly engaging quality that makes him a nice contrast to the others.\n\nJeanne Cooper, flintier than Miss Kitty, in the series pilot.\n\nI can only imagine that guest stars were drawn to this choice material. They certainly made the most of it. Mercedes McCambridge, Telly Savalas, Everett Sloane, George Macready, David Brian…. Hands down, the best performance I’ve ever seen from Ed Nelson. One of the best I’ve seen from Beverly Garland. Same with Royal Dano. And Corey Allen. And Audrey Dalton. And Strother Martin. Affecting turns by Diane Brewster and Sue Randall. Welcome familiar faces, Colleen Gray, DeForest Kelley, Andrew Duggan, Richard Loo, Whit Bissell, Jeanne Cooper, Elisha Cook, Jr. and so on.\n\nClaude Akins, Richard Loo, and Beverly Garland guest.\n\nThe show’s vigorous, ridiculously catchy theme music was composed by William Lava. Action scenes are staged with imagination and propulsive energy. Direction is uniformly sparkling: Richard Sarafian, Robert Totten, Charles Rondeau, quite a few from Stuart Heisler. Same with the writers: Cy Chermak, E.M. Parsons, Peter Germano, Dean Riesner to name a few. Speaking of writing….\n\nDiane Brewster guests.\n\nOne of the interesting things about the structure is that every episode begins in the middle. It’s a brilliant device. All that history—the events leading up to the current situation—that’s already happened. So, when the marshals ride in, the cauldron’s starting to boil. All parts are in motion. Familiar TV western tropes—powerful rancher gripping town in fear, lawman past his prime, range war—are deftly twisted into fresh new shapes and, suddenly, it’s hard to know what to expect. I watched these just six years ago and there were still moments that hit like a punch in the gut. Which leads us back to that fateful next-to-last episode “Sanctuary at Crystal Springs,” the one that ended it all.\n\nHad the viewers outraged at violence on their television screens taken the time to watch it all the way through, perhaps they would have understood that the subsequent moral (and spiritual) struggle was riding on the very scene they objected to. It was the whole point. In a way, THE DAKOTAS depended on the intelligence of its audience. It respected them and never condescended. Maybe folks missed it. Maybe they didn’t want to see it. Thus, the ax.\n\nWhat we’re left with is twenty pieces of gold; twenty examples of the TV western at its finest. Not a dud in the bunch, all very good to great, with several outright masterpieces. “Sanctuary at Crystal Springs” is one of the finest hours of any genre, from any period, with an unflinching script by Cy Chermak, inspired direction by Richard Sarafian (VANISHING POINT, MAN IN THE WILDERNESS) and intense performances by James Anderson and Les Tremayne, as well as, of course, the regulars, particularly Elam and Everett.\n\nThere was supposedly one more episode completed, “Black Gold,” but unfortunately it did not show up in the Warner Archive release, and no credits exist online. If it’s around, if it does turn up, I’d jump at the chance to buy it as a standalone. Unlikely. But a fellow can hope. (c) 2021 by Larry Blamire.

So the list is not definitive but it does acknowledge each commentary I have done. There are murmurs and rumors that Commentary #112 may be released through Arrow after all, but when is not yet known.\n\nAdditionally, I also wrote a substantial essay, \"Aleksandr Ptushko: Honest Tales of Bygone Days\" for the booklet included in Eureka's new \"Masters of Cinema\" release of the 1967 Soviet horror film, VIY. I'm particularly proud of this, the most substantial piece of writing I've ever done on Ptushko and possibly the most comprehensive to appear in English since Alan Upchurch's coverage of Russkaya Fantastyka for VIDEO WATCHDOG #s 8 and 9.\n\nI'm presently writing an essay for Eureka's forthcoming release of Robert Weine's silent classic THE HANDS OF ORLAC (1920), for which I'm delving into the highly rewarding writings of the unjustly neglected French author Maurice Renard. When I finish that, I'm looking ahead to many months worth of work on various assignments, including three major films (somewhat intimidating assignments), a few horror and fantasy classics you've probably already acquired but should buy once again, and then some single episodes of two very important scary television series close to your heart.\n\n(c) 2021 by Tim Lucas.

That's right: Joseph W. Sarno, who revolutionized the Adults Only movie market by taking it above and beyond nudist colony romps and adolescent daydreams about X-ray vision, was born 100 years ago today, on March 15, 1921. In another month or so, it will be 11 years since his passing on April 26, 2010.\n\nAs you may have heard, I’m dedicating all of my free time to preparing a book about Joe's mind-boggling filmography, which includes such titles as SIN IN THE SUBURBS (1964), MOONLIGHTING WIVES (1965), INGA (1967), YOUNG PLAYTHINGS (1971) and ABIGAIL LESLIE'S BACK IN TOWN (1974). The IMDb credits him with 125 films in all, but I will only covering in detail the software side of his career, the movies he was proud to sign with his own name - some 56 titles, which is far more than most directors get to make in a career. The others will be covered in thumbnail form, but even his hardcore work generated a few gems and those will be given special focus. While reviewing one of my Sarno commentaries, CineSavant Glenn Erickson mentioned my book-in-progress and wrote, \"if the information he’s compiled for this commentary is what can be expected, it might be a major work.\" This is very much my goal.\n\nAt the moment, I am slightly more than 600 pages into my manuscript. I imagine there’s still at least another 400 pages still to write, so we’re probably talking about something in the neighborhood of another Bava book. There's no contract yet but it looks like the book will be published by Strange Attractor - the UK company behind Stephen Thrower’s beautiful books devoted to Jess Franco. They have expressed strong interest, and we've got a verbal agreement, so the end product should be attractive and pleasant to handle.\n\nIn my view, Sarno wasn’t just America’s greatest and most prolific avatar of erotic cinema; he was also our first and perhaps only genuine dramatist of human sexuality - not in terms of explicitness (that didn’t really interest him, and it doesn’t interest me) but in terms of how all human life is affected by the mysterious forces of sexual orientation, sexual will, and sexual need. His best films depict how people, as individuals or in groups, communicate and express themselves sexually, how such expression can be either fulfilling or self-deluding and destructive, and how the complex nature of sex can impact private homes, apartment buildings, neighborhoods, businesses, cities, society as a whole. This is an entire side of human nature than most other drama - especially American drama - ignores.\n\nI’m blessed and fortunate to have the support of Joe’s wife, muse, assistant and occasional actress Peggy Steffans (“Cleo Nova”) - whom I’ve known by phone for many years; she is supplying me with information, stories, and materials - and his good friend Michael Raso, who is actively working with Film Movement to locate and restore Joe’s films and make them more commercially available. I knew Joe himself by phone for several years and hope that, wherever he is, he knows he’s still a hot topic of conversation and very much still alive and appreciated in the pages I’ve been piling up.\n\nSo... Happy Birthday, Joe - and here’s to your next 100!\n\n(c) 2021 by Tim Lucas.

The writer in question was Bill Stratton, a veteran TV scribe whose credits included 16 episodes of the original HAWAII FIVE-0, CANNON, and THE BLUE KNIGHT, whose only prior Western credit was the 1986 TV-movie THE LAST DAYS OF FRANK AND JESSE JAMES. Stratton was also the first writer for the movie series who wasn't building his story around flashbacks from an older GUNSMOKE episode; the story it tells is all-new - and, while that's welcome, the deep traction of the previous three films, the feeling of rounding up the old gang to prove they still have it, is generally missing. The film opens with the wedding of Matt Dillon's long-lost daughter Beth (returning Amy Stoch, now Stoch-Poynton) to Josh Reardon (Christopher Bradley) - who somewhat resembles but is not the soldier with whom she was shown to have some chemistry in the previous outing. Of course, weddings and engagements are omens of bad luck in GUNSMOKE lore, and that hasn't changed; as soon as the knot is tied, three deputies arrive from New Mexico to take the Father of the Bride into custody, as he has been n falsely identified as the outlaw responsible for shooting to death a wealthy mining executive while in the act of a recent robbery. Matt still respects the law, so he goes along peaceably, expecting to clear up a simple case of mistaken identity; but things change by the time he reaches New Mexico, where he's found to have a $5,000 price on his head, wanted dead or alive. Once Matt breaks away to clear his name, it becomes the story of enemies and friends met along the way to vindication, and how hard it sometimes is to tell the difference. The primary guest stars are James Brolin as John Parsley, an amiable whiskey priest struggling to find his own way back to being a good man, and Ali MacGraw as \"Uncle Jane\" Merkel, a widowed tradeswoman whom Parsley loves but on whom he's always been too shy and self-deprecating to stake a claim. The decision to move away from nostalgia towards creating something altogether new is commendable but this also results in the absence of the usual Western guest star veterans, which was an important part of the series' - and this series - overall alchemy. Even so, Arness remains rock-solid, the action scenes are well-handled, and the movie remains above average. If the Brolin-MacGraw romance is a little wobbly as it moves forward, its symmetry of its culmination is still moving. Not great, but still worthwhile.\n\nGUNSMOKE: ONE MAN'S JUSTICE (1994) - James Arness's swan song in the Matt Dillon role - again directed by Jerry Jameson, and this time written by husband-and-wife team Harry and Renée Longstreet - seems to have learned from the previous outing that some form of sentiment, if not nostalgia, was necessary to the overall recipe of these films. ONE MAN'S JUSTICE achieves this not by accessing old footage as hazy memories, but rather by involving a young character who reminds the aging Matt of himself at a decisive fork in his own life, as well as by studying his ongoing relationship with the U.S. Marshal badge he no longer wears. Here, Matt has settled down as a cattle rancher but he is drawn back into active duty when an orphaned 15 year-old boy of his acquaintance sets off in pursuit of the outlaws who murdered his mother during a brutal stagecoach robbery. As Matt expresses to his daughter, his ongoing belief in the law makes it necessary for him to try to involve himself, to intercede, to prevent the boy from becoming a murderer or from getting murdered in the process. The film allows for more bonding and business with Dillon's daughter and son-in-law (who offer active counterpoint to the main narrative and take part in a tense shoot-out/punch-out sequence) - it's probably Stoch's best showing as an actress in these films. Also along for the ride is Bruce Boxleitner (who played Arness' nephew on HOW THE WEST WAS WON), as Davis Healy, an innocent-seeming traveling salesman who becomes more complex when he proves himself to be surprisingly adept on the draw. The welcome reunion of Arness and Boxleitner strikes a nicely complex chord and Matt is really dragged through the wringer in his doggedness - at 71, he's still taking some hard rides (not to mention new bullets) for a selfless cause. Don't expect a triumphal climax or any acknowledgement of the long history that goes with this character; it's not about providing an ending to that story, or even this series of films. It's a last mission, one last ride, before the happy retirement Matt was entitled to - no more, no less. Truth be told, as endings go, it's a good deal more satisfying than GUNSMOKE's final broadcast episode.\n\n(c) 2021 by Tim Lucas.

(1952) was filmed by Henri-Georges Clouzot as LES DIABOLIQUES/DIABOLIQUE, 1955), starring Simone Signoret, Pierre Meurisse, and Vera Clouzot. It was said that the novel was a deliberate attempt by the two writers to create something that would entice Alfred Hitchcock to acquire the screen rights - quite brazenly too, as the novel itself makes a tantalizing passing reference to a fishing lure known as the Hitchcock. Hitchcock didn't have a chance to fall into the trap set for him, but of course, he was Johnny-On-The-Spot when the team returned in 1954 with the novel D'ENTRE LES MORTS, which the Master of Suspense would famously bring to the screen as VERTIGO (1958), presently considered the greatest film of all time in the latest SIGHT & SOUND critics' poll. I like VERTIGO very much, but I would personally consider LES DIABOLIQUES the greater film.\n\nD'ENTRE LES MORTS was translated into English, first appearing as THE LIVING AND THE DEAD, then reissued as VERTIGO at the time of the film's release. In recent years, after long unavailability, it has reappeared in paperback as THE LIVING AND THE DEAD. Long-term readers of VIDEO WATCHDOG may remember that I wrote a two-page article for our 40th issue titled \"VERTIGO Before Hitchcock\" [pp. 70-71], in which I described how very different yet fundamentally similar were the novel and film - an aspect I had not previously seen covered to any degree by known Hitchcock references.\n\nIt took me long enough to do it, but my recent renewed interest in Boileau-Narcejac and Clouzot's film led me to finally getting around to reading CELLE QUI N'ETAIT PLUS..., which first appeared in the UK as THE WOMAN WHO WAS, then was retitled THE WOMAN WHO WAS NO MORE for America, and also surfaced in Australia as THE FIENDS (my favorite of the titles and the closest to LES DIABOLIQUES). Both books were translated by the same author (Geoffrey Salisbury) and they are exquisitely crafted.\n\nWe all remember the basic plot of DIABOLIQUE, right? At a French elementary school, the headmaster's wife and mistress (one of the schoolteachers) conspire to murder the man they have in common, who is a sadistic brute who makes both their lives miserable. The wife is so abused that she's a nervous wreck suffering from heart problems. Together, with the mistress taking the lead, the two women knock the man unconscious, drown him in a bathtub and conceal the body in a swimming pool that has been covered up for the season. In time, the wife begins to see evidence that the husband is not so dead after all. In the end, it turns out that the husband and mistress have faked the murder to frighten the wife to death from cardiac arrest, so they take over the school (which she owns) and collect the insurance. In reading the novel, I was surprised to find out that Boileau-Narcejac's story was, once again, quite different to the film despite also being very similar.\n\nThe current edition.\n\nThe novel is about the husband, Fernand Ravinel, a man in early middle-age who went to law school but somehow never did anything with his education; his lack of ambition instead led him into the career of least resistance, as a salesman of sporting accessories who travels out of town by car for week-long periods, during which his young wife Mireille is left alone at home. It is Ravinel's father, a gloomy figure that haunts his imagination whom he blames for the defeatist disposition he's inherited, who was a school master. As the book opens, Ravinel is already preparing to murder Mireille with his mistress Lucienne, who is a doctor. A brief mention is made of Ravinel having a weak heart, but there is no pay-off to the detail. The murder itself takes place in the second chapter. It is as it occurs in the film, but the victim in the wife, whose body is left in the tub for two days, weighed down by two heavy iron dogs used as fireplace sentries, before her body is wrapped in a ground-sheet and carried off to be submerged in the shallows outside what Ravinel calls his lavoir - meaning the shed where he cleans up after gardening, but in French lavoir also has the relevant double meaning \"to see her,\" which is important because - shortly after the body's disposal - Ravinel begins to see Mireille and discovers that the body has disappeared from where they left it. He never sees her, but others do - like her brother, who recalls that Mireille, since she was a child, always had a kink of wandering off, disappearing for days at a time. Ravinel then begins to receive letters and notes from the dead woman, and the novel meticulously charts his psychological disintegration as he veers from rationality to believing that Mireille is a ghost and that he can see her because this haunting is part of a preparatory pas de deux that will culminate in their embrace and his own death.\n\nHas the novel ever been filmed in this way? I am aware of several filmings of the novel - supposedly of the novel - including John Badham's REFLECTIONS OF MURDER, a 1974 TV movie starring Tuesday Weld and Joan Hackett; Pierre Koralnik's \"Les Demoniaques,\" a 1969 episode of the French omnibus series LA GRAND COLLECTION; Mimi Leder's HOUSE OF SECRETS (1993), another TV movie, this one with Melissa Gilbert and Bruce Boxleitner; and of course Jeremiah Chechik's feature-length remake DIABOLIQUE (1996) with Sharon Stone and Isabelle Adjani. They all credit Boileau-Narcejac yet they adhere to the script for the Clouzot film, which was the invention of Clouzot, Jérôme Géronomi, René Masson and Frédéric Grendel - now mostly forgotten by the original film's many tributes.\n\nSimone Signoret and Paul Meurisse in the classic Clouzot film LES DIABOLIQUES.\n\nIt was astounding for me to discover that the novel is so radically different to the film. Boileau-Narcejac became famous for their association with DIABOLIQUE; they must have felt like imposters when people praised them for it! And yet THE WOMAN WHO WAS NO MORE or THE FIENDS or whatever you want to call it is a superb novel. I would have to say the film is the greater creation and I understand why Clouzot probably considered the original story unfilmable as-is. So much of the novel is internalized - as my Australian paperback copy says, it's \"a novel in the Simenon tradition, with all the eerie fantasy of a story by Edgar Allan Poe.\" It is set almost entirely inside the head of the husband (the character whom we learn least about in the film versions) and focuses mostly on the tightening vice of his ongoing internal monologue; that is aside from brief transcribed dialogues with other fleeting characters - the mistress of course, neighbors, postmen, bartenders, policemen, and the intriguing and humorous bit part of Desiré Martin, a seedy private detective formerly of the Surété (hinting at some past catastrophic failure or transgression), who tries to undertake an investigation of the missing wife. Perhaps most surprising is the book's final chapter, which gives us our first look at the relationship between Mirielle and Lucienne. Even if you've seen the film, it withholds its most unnerving surprise for the closing sentence of the book.\n\nThe novel has several engrossing sequences that have never been filmed, particularly a lengthy sequence set in a dense fog where Ravinel believes himself on the trail of his wife's ghost while at the same time being pursued by a shadowy man in squeaky shoes. Though it changes a great deal of its original story (even the names of the various characters - they could have kept at least those remnants!), the film is nevertheless an inspired analogy of how the novel goes to work on the reader; Clouzot and his team of writers found ingenious ways of externalizing its internalized landscape and ratcheting up the suspense with a subtle but meaningful alteration of the central criminal diagram, relocating its remote house settings to a public school full of children, and moving away from its looming phantasms toward the greater horror of a logical explanation.\n\n(c) 2021 by Tim Lucas.
