        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger vs Jackie Chan? Not a battle I thought I’d wanted, but now that it exits I could not be happier!\n\nPlot: The English traveller Jonathan Green receives from Peter the Great an order to map the Russian Far East. He sets out for a long journey full of incredible adventures that will eventually lead him to China. The cartographer will unexpectedly face a lot of breathtaking discoveries, encounter bizarre creatures, meet with Chinese Princesses, and confront deadly martial arts masters, and even the king of all dragons, the Dragon King. What could be more dangerous than meeting eye-to-eye with Viy, except doing it again? What would be stronger this time, a staunch asceticism of the scientist or the old black magic that has seized power of Eastern lands?\n\nSo back in 2014 a Russian film called Viy was released that was loosely based on Nikolai Gogol’s classic 1835 horror novella of the same name. And by loosely I mean they’ve basically changed the entire story (and not in a good way) and made an over-the-top computer special effects-heavy mess of a film. So now we have a sequel in the shape of The Mystery of Dragon’s Seal, or The Mystery of the Iron Mask…or Viy 2….or Journey to China….basically, this film for some reason has various titles so it is hard to pin-point which one is the main one. Seriously, check on Wikipedia, IMDb or the movie’s marketing, this film has multiple titles. Why? Well, to be honest “why?” is a question one can ask a lot when it comes to this movie. Why was this sequel made in the first place? And for some reason with this sequel Russia has teamed up with China to both co-finance and produce it, and the result is very strange to say the least.\n\nIf I had one word to describe this film it would be random. Don’t worry, you don’t need to watch the 2014 Viy film to understand what is going on here, as it is a standalone story, though I wouldn’t say this movie even has much of a story. More like a series of vignettes and random events and side-plots that are meshed together to fill up the 2 hour run-time, and it’s ridiculous, over-the-top, and, as I mentioned earlier, very random. None of it really makes sense, and it takes inspiration and steals ideas from other material like it’s nothing. There’s the whole ordeal with the man in the iron mask, which, for those of you who know your history, was originally the mysterious prisoner who was held in various French prisons in the latter half of the 17th century rumoured to be the older, illegitimate brother of Louis XIV. Well in this movie the man in the iron mask is the Russian Tsar Peter the Great who’s imprisoned in the Tower of London by Arnold Schwarzenegger. That’s right. it’s that kind of movie! And as a whole the movie definitely has a big Pirates of the Caribbean vibe to the whole thing, as well as merging various Chinese fantasy flicks together into one. The result is quite messy and though I enjoyed certain scenes and characters, there were many times where I felt flat-out bored.\n\nFrom a technical stand-point this movie does also disappoint, and though I am aware that this thing doesn’t have a Hollywood budget, the abundant use of green screen here is uncanny, and the entire thing looks so fake. Also, whoever did the sound editing and mixing really needs to reconsider their career path, as the sound mixing between camera shots and scene transitions was extremely uneven. That being said on the other hand there were some really nicely looking sets and costume designs, and the dragon that appears at the end of the movie, though nothing spectacular, still had a nice design to him. At least he looked more interesting that the very uninspiring Smaug from The Hobbit films.\n\nThe parts of the film that do really leave an impression are the participation of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jackie Chan. These two are absolute scene-stealers, and you can tell that they were having just as much fun on set as we are watching them. And as I mentioned earlier, seeing a battle between the terminator himself and the dude from Shanghai Noon was not something I thought I wanted to see, but boy was I game for it when it happened on screen. It is a shame that both of these actors are in the movie for about 20 minutes in total (even though the marketing makes them look like the leads), but the time they are on screen does indeed elevate the film to another level. The sadly recently deceased Rutger Hauer also makes a fleeting cameo alongside Charles Dance, but none of the cast members really leave as big of an impression as Arnie and Jackie. Also, the main lead played by Jason Flemyng came across very flat and dull. All in all, Journey to China (or whatever it is called) is a disappointing mess that is only worth seeing for the pairing of Schwarzenegger and Chan, or for people who want to see a mindless popcorn flick with some enjoyment value and that happen to understand either Russian or Chinese. Actually, that reminds me, the dubbing for this film is atrocious. With the entire cast originating from various countries, the movie dubs everyone according to the movie’s distribution location, and that comes as a big distraction. Then again, I feel like the film’s producers are very aware that they were making a trashy stupid movie in the first place, so there is only so much valid critique I can give to this thing. At the end of the day it’s all done just for fun.\n\nOverall score: 4/10\n\nThe Terminator franchise consists of movies that I grew up on. And obviously the first two Terminator films are ultimate classics. The third and fourth installments of this franchise were just awful, especially the fourth movie (Terminator: Salvation), I mean, what was that all about! So yeah, since the weren’t really good Terminator movies coming out since the second one, I didn’t really care about the new movies for the franchise, so that was why Terminator: Genisys, the new fifth installment of the franchise, was not on my list of most anticipated movies of 2015. Since I didn’t really care much about it. However, a few months ago I watched a trailer for this film, and I noticed how this movie tried to focus a lot on the original two Terminator films, which straight away got me interested. However, whilst I am on the topic of the movie’s trailer, DON’T WATCH IT! DO NOT WATCH THE TERMINATOR: GENISYS TRAILER! As there are major spoilers in there which might actually ruin the movie experience for some of you. Anyways, now that I have seen the movie, let’s review it…\n\nPlot: John Connor sends Kyle Reese back in time to protect Sarah Connor, but when he arrives in 1984, nothing is as he expected it to be.\n\nSo yeah, this movie completely messes up the timeline of the first Terminator movie. Since the movie starts pretty much exactly like the first Terminator movie, where the bad Terminator is sent back in time to kill Sarah Connor, the mother of John Connor, who is the leader of the resistance against Skynet, the evil corporation who want to make mankind extinct using terminators and take over the world. And then John Connor sends one of his main friends Kyle Reese back in time to stop the evil Terminator and save his mother. So yeah, this is exactly how the original Terminator movie begins. However, when Kyle Reese arrives in 1984, things are much more different to what they were in the original Terminator movie. Firstly, Sarah Connor is straight up a bad-ass, unlike in the first Terminator movie where she was this weak, un-protected waitress. Secondly, we have Arnold Schwarzenegger appearing as an old Terminator, who was originally sent to the time when Sarah Connor was a child, and then looked after her and trained her to become strong. So Arnold kind of stands as a father-figure to Sarah Connor, similarly to the Terminator 2 movie, where Arnold played the father-figure terminator and looked after the young John Connor. So now, we have an epic battle scene between the old Arnold terminator against the original young Arnold terminator, and I loved the CGI that the movie used to show the original young Arnold from the first movie. That was some of the best CGI I seen in the whole movie to be fair. Also, Kyle Reese runs into a T-1000 terminator model (who we all know from the Terminator 2 movie) who also for some reason is in that time hunting down Sarah Connor, and so he has to fight him too. Alright, I am not going to say anything else about the plot anymore. All I am going to say is that the plot line gets even more complicated and convoluted after that. Which is one of the problems that I had with this film. The story-line is unnecessarily complicated, and it seems like the writers themselves didn’t really know at the time where they wanted to take this story, and so they were making things up as they were going along.\n\nThe acting i this film sadly is just not good. It just isn’t. All cast members just had dull and bland facial expressions, and I didn’t feel any emotions from any of the characters, which was just disappointing. However, there was one cast member that was actually really really good. And that is Arnold Schwarzenegger who does a perfect job as the old Terminator, and in fact has some great comedic timing, cracks amazing one-liners, does a pretty good job at being a powerful character etc. In other words, I personally think that Arnold was the best part of this film. Without him, this movie would have just been a pile of garbage. Which is why Terminator: Salvation was such a bad movie, since Schwarzenegger was not in that film. And the Terminator movies just don’t work without Arnold, as it just kind of is his iconic role. As for the rest of the cast, they were all dull as I already mentioned before. So I am not going to go into detail on them. Although, J.K. Simmons is in this movie and added some great comic relief, however his character could have been so much more, but he was extremely under-used. Talking about actors that were under-used, Matt Smith, who many of you might know as Doctor Who, was so wasted in this film. He only appears for a maximum of 5 minutes. I mean, when the writers had such a great actor on their hands, and that was all that they gave him, that just cries out disappointment. I understand that they are probably keeping Matt Smith to be used as a main villain in future unnecessary Terminator sequel, but still. Why have him in the movie for 5 minutes? And on that account, why did Matt Smith himself agree to be in this movie for only 5 minutes? What got him interested? Probably the massive Hollywood paycheck.\n\nThe CGI in this movie was okay-ish. The scene I mentioned about before with young Arnold fighting old Arnold was done perfectly, and the graphics used there were made to look really realistic. However for the rest of the film, the CGI looked really fake, and was also really repetitive, and it kind for reminded me of the CGI effects that television shows use, which is not a good thing. The Terminator films, especially the first two, were groundbreaking in terms of the CGI and technology that was used, however in Terminator: Genisys, there was not really any groundbreaking effects.\n\nIn the end, I would say that Terminator: Genisys should be looked at as a simple summer-blockbuster-popcorn flick, that you can enjoy once, and then forget about. Because I do admit that I was entertained whilst watching the movie, and that is good enough for me. However it is not a deserving sequel for the Terminator franchise, but I admit that it is the most decent Terminator sequel that we got since the first two movies. This movie is nowhere as bad as Terminator 3 and Terminator: Salvation. Those two films need to be washed away from our memories forever and ever and ever and ever and you get the point. Terminator: Genisys on the other hand, as I already said, is a decent summer movie that can be enjoyed in the cinema. But I have to warn you that unlike Jurassic World, where you didn’t really need to have seen the original Jurassic Park movies to understand what was going, in the case of Terminator: Genisys, you wouldn’t have a clue what was going on if you haven’t seen the previous Terminator movies. So don’t watch this film if you haven’t seen the originals, since then you would most likely hate it. Also, I still want to point out that I don’t understand why in this movie’s title, ‘genesis’ is spelled as ‘genisYs’. Where did the ‘y’ come from? So weird… Anyways, I will finish my review here, or I feel that soon my review will become as convoluted as the movie itself!\n\nOverall score: 6/10\n\n“I promised your mother that I would protect you.”\n\nWow, now this was a depressing movie. It literally was a whole big sequence of depression thrown at me, and I was not expecting it! But, at the same time I have to say that this film was really good! Finally, it’s been a while since I seen a good film in 2015!\n\nPlot: A teenage girl in the Midwest becomes infected by an outbreak of a disease that slowly turns the infected into cannibalistic zombies. During her transformation, her loving father stays by her side.\n\nAnd I know what you all are about to say “oh no, this is yet just another zombie movie, boring!!” however, I’m glad to tell you that there’s more to this film than you would think. The fact is, that although this is a zombie movie, there are only like 3 zombies that appear in the entire film. This movie isn’t meant to be one of those crazy action zombie shooter films; this movie actually focuses more on the people, and the emotional sides of losing someone who is close to you. It shown this family, more precisely a father and his daughter, and the daughter has been infected by this zombie infection. And so the father now has to see how his daughter is going through this infection and slowly fading away, and everyone knows that she will soon die, and so does he, and this is where the movie makes a great job at making us, the audience, feel sorry for both the father and daughter, since the film shows how hard it is for the father to lose someone as close as his daughter. In other words, this is an extremely sad and emotional story, and, as I mentioned before, really depressing. But I have to admit that this worked well with the overall tone of the film.\n\nThe cinematography in this film is interesting as well, since the whole film is presented in this dark filter, which the sky always in grey clouds, all the character wearing dull clothes and generally the whole setting of the film is shown in this dark tone, which I think worked well, since it made the idea of darkness be presented to us physically and mentally. The music in this film also worked greatly with the overall tone of the film.\n\nI also have to mention about the great performances in this film. Firstly, Abigail Breslin as the infected daughter, who really did a great job and making us, the audience, feel sorry for her and sympathize with her character. Joely Richardson as the step mother also did a great job showing how her character tried to help the daughter in any way possible, but at the same time showing how difficult it is to cope with the fact that someone who is part of you family is slowly dying right in front of your eyes. And finally, how surprised I was with Arnold Schwarzenegger’s performance in this film as the father. Before, I thought that Arnold couldn’t act at all. Alright, I did find him entertaining to watch in the Terminator films, but in the end I have to admit that it wasn’t really professional good acting. However, in this film Arnold actually showed that he could be a good actor. I mean, he physically cried in one of the scenes in the film! His performance in this film was by far the one that stood out most to me, as he really was able to show how his character of the father really loves his daughter, and how seeing her slowly dying really is breaking his heart from the inside.\n\nI have to admit that at times the film was quite slow paced, but for the great story, tone, music, cinematography and performances (especially Arnold Schwarznegger) is what sold me this movie. This film is great! I’m actually so happy. I was really losing it with 2015, as there are so many bad and disappointing films coming out this year, and now this film comes out which is surprisingly good. I’m emphasizing ‘surprising’, since I never expected this film to be great. But it was. It was really good. I really recommend this film to everyone. Even for people out there who hate zombie films, don’t fear, as the zombie elemnt in this film is minimal. The movie mainly focuses on family relationships and the emotional sides. Please see this film, as I want people to know how good it is!\n\nOverall score: 9/10 GREAT FILM!!\n\nIs it time for the Terminator franchise to be terminated for good? Well…\n\nPlot: Sarah Connor and a hybrid cyborg human must protect a young girl from a newly modified liquid Terminator from the future.\n\nWith James Cameron returning to the franchise (now as a producer), Terminator: Dark Fate sets out to forget all about the badly made sequels and instead be a straight continuation from Terminator 2: Judgement Day. With director Tim Miller of Deadpool also on board, one could hope this is indeed is an improvement for the series. Having now watched I can say - meh! It’s pretty harmless for what it is, however it does not reinvent the franchise in any way and does not stand out particularly from the likes of Terminator 3 or Genisys. Not going to talk about Salvation. Salvation sucks. So Salvation can take a hike. Anyway, Dark Fate is just yet another Terminator flick where basically the exactly same thing happens once again with hardly any surprises or nuance.\n\nHowever one thing Dark Fate does achieve is emphasising how pointless the franchise has become. Without spoiling, the film’s opening scene in a nutshell destroys any kind of progress that has been achieved narratively in Terminator 2: Judgement Day and then the rest of the movie goes on to prove that there can be no definitive ending to this series as it is rehash of the same thing whilst being hidden under a new shell. The same thing will happen over and over again, and once again our fellow heroes will have to save the day. Basically like any Marvel movie, however here it’s the more obvious and lacks any kind of originality by this point. All these Terminator movies have their good moments, however as a whole I do think this franchise should be stopped. But that can only happen if these movies stop making money. As otherwise they have a concept that can redone endlessly.\n\nThe cast are all okay and do fine work with what they are given. Linda Hamilton feels like she never left the franchise returning as the ever badass Sarah Connor, and she, alongside the other leading women of this movie prove how strong and cool females can be on-screen. This includes Blade Runner 2049′s Mackenzie Davis, who, though not very likeable in character, gets some of the best action scenes. Natalia Reyes is sweet, however she doesn’t get much to do here, however through her (alongside certain other cast members) and the story the movie actually does a great job at representing Mexico with all respect. Gabriel Luna as the evil Terminator is, well, evil. And then there’s Arnold Schwarzenegger who’s as great as ever in his signature role, and even gets to flex some of his comedic chops.\n\nTerminator: Dark Fate adds no new flavours to the franchise, however has some enjoyment value and the very game cast hold this thing together, with Hamilton, Davis and Schwarzenegger being the stand-outs. Tim Miller disappoints a little with the directing, as his filming of the action sequences is too messy and all over the place as well as the over-reliance of bad CGI comes as a distraction. I say wait for this to come out on digital and then give it a watch. Or don’t. You won’t lose out on anything.\n\nOverall score: 5/10\n\nWhat’s not to like here? There’s comedy, fun characters, cool animation, action packed kung-fu scenes and most importantly…PANDAS! You gotta love them adorable pandas. Even a fighting murdering panda (like in this movie) still doesn’t take away from it’s adorableness. Go pandas!!\n\nPlot: Continuing his “legendary adventures of awesomeness”, Po must face two hugely epic, but different threats: one supernatural and the other a little closer to his home.\n\nSo, the ‘Kung Fu Panda’ franchise has now officially become a trilogy. Congratulations DreamWorks! You’ve done it! Just like you’ve done it to most of your other franchises such as ‘Madagascar’. So it’s actually not really that special. Anyways, I like the first ‘Kung Fu Panda’ movie, I thought it had an interesting premise and overall just a light-hearted and enjoyable family film. The second one on the other hand I hated. I’m aware of the fact that many people love ‘Kung Fu Panda 2′, but I’m not one of them, so deal with it. I just thought that it didn’t have enough style to it, and I sort of found it a bit boring. As for this new third installment, I did enjoy it for what it was. Obviously it was just another studio cash grab (and I don’t blame them, it’s a profitable franchise), however it was a studio cash grab film that was done well. The comedic moments hit when they had to, the plot-line, even though it was just a rehash of the previous films’ stories, was fun too, and the animation is top-notch.\n\nMost of the voice actors return with Jack Black returning as the lovable panda Po, and he is as great as always. Jack Black’s voice is just simply perfect for the kind of character that Po is, which is this cheesy but at the same time awkward figure. Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, David Cross and Seth Rogen all return as Po’s side-kicks, however their roles in this movie are probably even smaller that in the first two films, with Angelina Jolie’s Tigress getting the most screen-time. We then have newcomers Bryan Cranston as Po’s father and J.K. Simmons as the villain Kai, both of whom make a great addition to the cast. Bryan Cranston just has that perfect soothing elderly voice that just fits a character of a father, whilst J.K. Simmons just has that tension filled powerful deep voice that, just like in 2014′s film ‘Whiplash’, added so much to his character. Oh, and Dustin Hoffman also returns as Master Shifu, but you already knew that, since he is in both of the previous films, so what’s the point of me reminding you guys about things you already know. Oh, you want me to say if his voice acting was good or not. Well, it’s exactly the same as the last two times, its good. Now lay off, okay, jeez!\n\nI also found it very entertaining that as part of the soundtrack they used an orchestrated version of Imagine Dragons’ song ‘I’m So Sorry’ everytime the main villain made an appearance, which was very distracting since in my head I was just singing the lyrics over and over so now I have the song stuck in my head again. Thanks for that ‘Kung Fu Panda 3′!\n\nOverall ‘Kung Fu Panda 3′ is a nice addition to the franchise, light-hearted and fun, very similar to the first two so nothing special, and it’s a great film for the whole family to enjoy. And for you, parents, it’s a great way to keep your kids busy whilst you two have some private time, if you know what I mean. And by private time I mean playing with jigsaw puzzles or reading a book. Wow, what were you thinking of, you dirty minded people?\n\nOverall score: 7/10\n\nThat is actually a good question. Why is the name Lloyd not pronounced as L-loyd. There must be a reason for the two L’s at the beginning, there just must be!\n\nPlot: Shunned by everyone for being the son of an evil warlord, a teenager seeks to defeat him with the help of his fellow ninjas.\n\nThese LEGO movies have all been fairly enjoyable, with the first ‘The Lego Movie’ being a surprise that wasn’t just a cash grab on a famous toy property, ‘The Lego Batman Movie’ which had Batman in it (so I was kind of sold on that anyway), and now we have ‘The Lego Ninjago Movie’ which is starting to show traces of the LEGO movie franchise to fall into the pool of repetition and thus making me lose interest in the franchise. Yes, Phil Lord and Chris Miller are coming back for ‘The Lego Movie 2′ which is good, since they tend to be a strong duo of directors when it comes to sequels (just look at ‘22 Jump Street’), and so I’m partially interested in that film, but besides that I think they should stop making these Lego movies before it becomes to much. That’s not to say that ‘The Lego Ninjago Movie’ is bad, it just doesn’t do anything new or special. The main difference from the previous two Lego movies is that this one is probably the most kid oriented with more simpler jokes and less humour for adults to understand, that being said I still enjoyed this film very much. The trade mark sarcastic over-the-top LEGO movie humour is here, the colourful characters are present, the top notch animation that looks like stop-motion still looks as cool as ever and works really well in creating this massive city of Ninjago…it just all doesn’t have much else to it. It’s a good way to spend 1 and a half hours with your child.\n\nThe voice cast all do a great job, with stand-outs Justin Theroux as the film’s villain Garmadon and Jackie Chan as the mentor of the ninjas Master Wu both being the main two sources of the film’s humour. Jackie Chan also gets to be in a couple of live-action scenes in this film which were a nice callback to the first film of the franchise. And also how can I not mention the adorable live-action cat that goes around destroying the buildings of the city of Ninjago. Yes, I know its causing destruction and killing LEGO figures left and right, but it purrs so adorably as it does so that you cannot help but find it cute.\n\nNone of the music here gets as catchy as “Everything is Awesome”, so don’t expect anything like that. As I said, its a fairly enjoyable film which I had a good time with but it won’t be one that I’ll remember.\n\nOverall score: 6/10\n\nTOP MOVIE: “How bad does it look, out of 10?” “Err…like 7 point arm ripper off?”\n\nWhy would they release this only a month after Across the Spider-Verse?? It’s as if they WANT to live in the shadows!\n\nPlot: After years of being sheltered from the human world, the Turtle brothers set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers. Their new friend, April O'Neil, helps them take on a mysterious crime syndicate, but they soon get in over their heads when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles of course are close to the hearts of many people’s childhoods, however I do not share that element of nostalgia. I am aware of the turtles and their pizza obsession, and I have unfortunately seen both of the Michael Bay produced ones, but nonetheless I walked into Mutant Mayhem with a very open mind. I am a fan of Seth Rogen and have also been enjoying this new style of animation that spawned from 2018′s Into the Spider-Verse, that steps away from the Disney/Pixar dominated oversaturated 3D computer animation and instead incorporates 2D and various interesting art styles from watercolours to comic-book sketches. Again, Spider-Verse started this and is still probably the most well executed one, however I personally also believe Klaus and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish have managed to take this new artwork animation style and make it their own. Mutant Mayhem again looks very good visually, and even though this one doesn’t really add much more to this animation style that Spider-Verse already did, there were still some creative choices made, like in many shots parts of the character drawings and the background sketches looking unfinished, as if a kid drew them, which I found to be a nice touch, especially with the movie’s youthful nature. But yes, the artwork is very close to Spider-Verse, and that is not the only comparison. Strangely enough the energetic music score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross hits near all the same notes and drum beats of Daniel Pemberton’s excellent Across the Spider-Verse soundtrack. Both are very similar, and again reiterated that TMNT: Mutant Mayhem gladly embraces that it exists solely due to the trend that Spider-Verse started.\n\nWhat really works for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is that it actually accepts the fact that its titular turtles are teenagers. Voiced entirely by a youthful cast, the four central turtles have amazing banter and share that coming-of-age feel, making their friendship believable and entertaining to watch. At times it feels like you’re just hanging out with a bunch of friends who are being goofs. The supporting cast all do their part and are evidently having fun themselves. Ice Cube makes for a formidable villain who at first comes off really cool and charming, but then turns into an intimidating presence that manages to proudly proclaim rap lyrics. Jackie Chan is an inspired casting choice, as he brings an endearing warmth as the overprotective father-figure to the turtles, and his vocal performance felt genuine. There’s many famous actors that provide vocal additions to the shedload of characters in this movie, but I’d say Paul Rudd stood out the most as a crazy skater-bro who was foolishly funny.\n\nJeff Rowe (known for The Mitchells vs. The Machines) balances the themes of coming-of-age and acceptance really well with the fast-paced action-packed energy of Seth Rogen’s and Evan Goldberg’s script, and there’s plenty of laughs and colourful set pieces to keep kids entertained at the cinema this month. This is definitely a more younger audience aimed affair, but I enjoyed it nonetheless and at the very least is the best version of TMNT I have seen so far. Naturally my main comparisons are those Michael Bay movies and, well, that’s not a very high bar. But don’t worry, Mutant Mayhem provides plenty of entertainment value, popping imagery and mountains of ninja skills. And pizza, of course.\n\nOverall score: 7/10\n\nUmmm, okay, what??\n\nPlot: Five sisters in 19th century England must cope with the pressures to marry while protecting themselves from a growing population of zombies.\n\nYes, that’s right, ‘Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter’ was not a one off thing. Now we have Jane Austen’s classic being converted into a zombie film. Going to be honest, I hated the idea of this film, and so I went into the movie with low expectations. I just generally thought that the idea of mixing the ‘Pride and Prejudice’ within a zombie apocalypse was disrespectful to the original source material. Call me old fashioned, but I love the classics of literature, and although ‘Pride and Prejudice’ wouldn’t be my first pick when it comes to classic reading, I still think that all classic books should be treated with respect, and if there is a movie adaptation of any kind for them, then they should purely try to stay loyal to the original story, and not just go crazy by adding random changes to it like for example in this case adding zombies. Because then the question rises: why? Why add zombies to ‘Pride and Prejudice’? Does it makes sense? No. So why do such a thing in the first place, I just can’t get it. I mean, I understand why a film studio would want to make a period piece based around a zombie apocalypse, it’s a fun premise, but why mix it with a classic. Literally, if this film didn’t have the name Pride and Prejudice stamped within the title, thus not stating that it is connected in any way to the book, then I wouldn’t mind. It would have just been another simple zombie flick. But no, the studio was like “This is Pride and Prejudice b*tches! Now with zombies! Hell yeah!” And so now we’re stuck with this film.\n\nSpeaking honestly though, I did enjoy this film more than I thought I would. The costumes and set pieces looked gorgeous, and fit perfectly to that time period. And the cast performances were good too. Everyone seemed like they were fully on board with this idea, and so all there performances felt more real, which of course benefited the movie overall. Lily James shows once again that she has star-power, since she makes a great job at leading this movie. And generally it’s always nice to see Lily James on-screen, you know. She’s just, you know, nice to look at. What I’m trying to say is, errmmm, she is very attractive. Oh gosh, I think I might have a celebrity crush. Damn! Oh well, never mind that, on-wards with the review. Sam Riley also does a good job as the love interest for Lily James’ character, however he had a very weird deep voice that he was doing throughout the film which just sort of made his character feel a bit off. ‘Game of Thrones’ stars Charles Dance and Lena Headey make appearances too, however I have to say that they were quite under-used. However, the scene-stealer was Matt Smith (Doctor Who fans applaud) who added the comic relief into the movie, and some of the lines he said were making the whole cinema theatre laugh.\n\nThe zombie special effects were okay. I mean, they weren’t ‘The Walking Dead’ style good, but they were passable. Overall there is definitely enjoyment to be found within this film. They are surprising bits of blood and gore, and then there are the light hearted humouristic moments. Generally speaking, this simply is a dumb flick which people who are fans of this genre will definitely enjoy. However this isn’t a movie that will become a classic, unlike the source material it is based off, and most likely after a months people would have forgotten all about it. But still an enjoyable one-time watch.\n\nOverall score: 6/10\n\nLadies, get your handkerchiefs ready, as this is a tear-jerker. Gentlemen, for you I just simply feel sorry as I’m pretty sure that the only reason you ended up seeing this film was because your girlfriends made you go with them.\n\nPlot: A girl in a small town forms an unlikely bond with a recently-paralyzed man she’s taking care of.\n\nI don’t really see what all this rave is about over Emilia Clarke. Many of my friends and people that I know have stated that she is one of the most beautiful actresses working today. I mean, I do agree that she is somewhat attractive, but not on the top of the list or anything. But anyway, this is in some ways Clarke’s first shot at being a lead movie star, and she does a decent job. You can see that she is actually making an effort in her performance by attempting to be a character that is completely different to her normal self. And I respect her for that. However she isn’t the only ‘Game of Thrones’ star in this movie. Sam Claflin plays the disabled man that Clarke’s character has to look after, and Charles Dance also makes an appearance as his father. Generally, all performances in this film are quite good, however at the same time after seeing this movie I wouldn’t say that any of these characters are really memorable,\n\nThe movie itself though is just simply okay. The story is fine, even though it is quite cliched and generic in it’s themes, and the movie overall is quite watchable. I mean, if you are one of those people who went crazy over ‘The Fault in Our Stars’ movie you will most likely enjoy this film. Though I don’t think that this one will make you cry much, as there weren’t really any particular heartbreaking moments. There were a couple of sad scenes, with one kind-of strong emotional punch to the end of the film, but overall nothing too bad. However then again I am a heartless person who never cries over movies or in fact cries at all. I can proudly say that I haven’t cried for over 10 years now! But enough about me, back to this film. It’s something that is best enjoyed when it pops up on cable or something, but nothing much else really. As I said, it’s an okay film that some might very well enjoy watching.\n\nOverall score: 6/10\n\nWhenever there is a movie coming out about Russia in cinema, I am usually quite keen on going to see it. Last year’s movie ‘Black Sea’ had many Russian characters in it which was why I found the movie interesting, and now this movie Child 44, which is set in Russia during Joseph Stalin’s Soviet Union. So let’s talk about this movie…\n\nPlot: A disgraced member of the military police investigates a series of nasty child murders during the Stalin-era Soviet Union.\n\nChild 44 is based on the bestseller book by Tom Rob Smith of the same name, and I myself never actually read the book, so I walked into this movie not really knowing much about it. I did see the trailer for it beforehand, so I did know that this movie would focus on this serial killer child murderer in Soviet Russia, and the main character Tom Hardy would, like Sherlock Holmes, try to find out who the murderer is. It’s true, the movie is about that. Well, it’s more like 20-30% of this movie is about the serial killer.\n\nThe rest of the movie actually focuses on the time period itself, and how it was in Soviet Union during Joseph Stalin’s reign in the 1950. And I value Daniel Espinosa, the director, for undertaking such a difficult and challenging topic, and I think he did a good job. Though, I noticed that he developed the story concentrating the attention of the audience exclusively on the negative sides of Stalin’s regime, and by doing so creates a misleading and distort reality, however based on real aspects of the life of that time. For example, though correctly noted in Child 44 that civil crime was not advertised in mass-media and was actually treated by Soviet officials as “a capitalistic disease” as quoted in the film, the attempt to create an impression that it was forbidden to know about the possibility of murders in the Soviet Union sounds a bit ridiculous in view of the fact of the existence of the official crime detection services (e.g. the famous Moscow Criminal Police in Petrovka 38, glorified in many Soviet Russian films) which was no secret to the Soviet population.\n\nOne should stress the political aspect of this movie as shown in this particular time as it contributes to anti-Russian information and economy campaign (such as the current sanctions) lead by some countries.\n\nThe casting in this film was interesting. Whoever was able to put together such a big list of stars together in one film, I praise them. Tom Hardy stars as the main character Leo Demidov, and you could see during the film that he is giving this character his all, and by the end I really believed his character and felt for him. The only problem I had with Tom Hardy was the fact that he doesn’t look Russian. He just doesn’t. But because of his good attempt of portraying this character, I guess I will let him off. Dracula is in this film too. Can you believe it?? Well, not quite, not Dracula himself. Just Gary Oldman who starred as Dracula in the movie ‘Bram Stoker’s Dracula’. Yeah, him, well he is in this movie as General Mikhail Nesterov, and he plays the part well, but he just isn’t in the movie that much. He appears in total in the film for about 10-15 minutes, taking into account that this movie is over 2 hours. So I felt like Gary Oldman was under-used in this film, but during the time he was on-screen, he did his job well. Paddy Considine wasn’t bad as the villain, however I cannot say much about his character, since there wasn’t really much development to his character. Noomi Rapace as Tom Hardy’s character’s wife was okay. That’s all I can. She was okay. She didn’t add much to her character, but she didn’t portray the character badly either. She was kind of just there. Charles Dance is in this film as Major Grachev, who appears in one of the best scenes of the film where he has an extremely well scripted dialogue scene between him and Tom Hardy at the end of the film, which I’m not going to spoil. So casting wise, this movie is perfect.\n\nThe cinematography in the film is praise worthy too. The movie looks quite dark, which fits perfect to the overall theme.\n\nIn conclusion, this is an interesting film, maybe a bit too ambitious at times, and I feel happy about seeing the film. It’s a movie that I feel that I kind of had to see. And yes, I did enjoy watching the film, so that’s always good. Oh, and by the way, I almost forgot to mention. This movie makes an extremely big mistake, That mistake being really bad Russian accents. Many characters in this film are made to speak in Russian accents, so as to make the film’s setting feel more like it is in Russia. But I think it’s just pointless. If a movie is in English, then just keep it that way. Because in Russia Russian people don’t walk around speaking in English with Russian accents. So unless you don’t have all the characters in the film speak in the full Russian language, then just keep it in English. Having them speak in Russian accents does not add realism to the film. Just thought that I’d point that out.\n\nOverall score: 5/10"
