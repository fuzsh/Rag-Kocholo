        "text": "Most James Bond films feature unique bad guys, one-off allies and love interests who are never mentioned again. However, there have also been some characters who crop in more than one movie. Just for fun, here’s a complete list – ranked by the number of times they appear…\n\n* Cinema-released films only, so the list does not feature the TV adaptation of Casino Royale from 1954 or the James Bond Jnr cartoon series.\n\n* The two movies that sit outside the main Eon Productions continuity – Casino Royale (1967) and Never Say Never Again (1983) – are included.\n\n* This blog post was compiled before the release of 2021’s No Time to Die so only pre-announced characters from that film make the cut.\n\n=15. Sylvia Trench\n\nAppears in two films: Dr No (1962) & From Russia With Love (1963)\n\nPlayed by: Eunice Gayson\n\nIt seems odd now, but the James Bond film series began with 007 gaining and maintaining a regular girlfriend. In Dr No, he meets the sexy and confident Sylvia at Le Cercle casino in London over the most famous game of baccarat in cinema history. ‘I admire your luck, Mr..?’ she says after he wins. ‘Bond,’ he replies in sultry close-up. ‘James Bond.’ It seems the producers’ original idea was to have Sylvia appear in every film, the running joke being that James always gets called away on a mission just as things are developing romantically. But the idea was dropped after her second appearance, sharing a riverside picnic with 007 in From Russia With Love.\n\n=15. Sheriff JW Pepper\n\nAppears in two films: Live and Let Die (1973) & The Man With the Golden Gun (1974)\n\nPlayed by: Clifton James\n\nOne of the most openly comedic characters in any of the Bond films, the cantankerous and tobacco-chewing Pepper is a local cop with the Louisiana State Police. He first encounters 007 when the latter is being pursued by bad guys through the bayous and causing a lot of collateral damage. The following year, the pair bump into each other again – in Bangkok. Pepper is on holiday with his wife and gets inadvertently involved in an epic car chase.\n\nCasting note: Clifton James later played a character in Superman II who was suspiciously similar to Pepper.\n\n=15. Jaws\n\nAppears in two films: The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) & Moonraker (1979)\n\nPlayed by: Richard Kiel\n\nA literally towering henchman-for-hire who works for the villains of two successive Bond films. The second most famous Jaws of 1970s cinema is a 7’2″ brute with metal teeth who can lift cars, cut metal cables by biting into them and survive parachute-less falls from aeroplanes. Actor Richard Kiel gives him an air of childlike naivety to go with the super-strength.\n\n=15. Smithers\n\nAppears in two films: For Your Eyes Only (1981) & Octopussy (1983)\n\nPlayed by: Jeremy Bulloch.\n\nThe gadget-master Q got an assistant in the early 1980s, played by the actor who was concurrently appearing as Boba Fett, the most badass bounty hunter in a galaxy far, far away. Smithers was usually seen testing out some ingenious but oddly specific gizmo (‘We need a fake plaster-cast arm that will suddenly strike the person standing directly next to you!”) but only made two appearances.\n\nCasting note: Jeremy Bulloch had played a different role in The Spy Who Loved Me.\n\n=15. Jack Wade\n\nAppears in two films: GoldenEye (1995) & Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)\n\nPlayed by: Joe Don Baker\n\nWhen James Bond was recast with Pierce Brosnan in 1995, the character gained a new American ally – the ramshackle and sarcastic CIA operative Jack Wade. The pair first work together in St Petersburg, where ‘Jimbo’ (as Wade calls Bond) has to contend with Wade’s old, unreliable, remodelled Fiat 600. In the next film, Wade provides the equipment for 007 to skydive into the South China Sea.\n\nCasting note: Joe Don Baker had previously been one of the villains in The Living Daylights. He’d also played a character not entirely unlike Wade in the 80s TV series Edge of Darkness, which had been directed by Martin Campbell, who then cast him in GoldenEye.\n\n=15. Valentin Zukovsky\n\nAppears in two films: GoldenEye (1995) & The World in Not Enough (1999)\n\nPlayed by: Robbie Coltrane\n\nA Russian gangster with a KGB past, Zukovsky acts as an uneasy ally of Bond in two 90s films. We first meet him in St Petersburg when 007 shows up at his nightclub wanting information on a local crime syndicate. The two men have met before: Zukovsky still has a limp from a gunshot wound inflicted by Bond. A few years later, Bond encounters him in Azerbaijan – Zokovsky is now a casino owner and caviar trader. Played by an actor with great comic timing, he never feels like a total villain.\n\n=15. Dr Madeleine Swann\n\nAppears in two films: Spectre (2015) & No Time to Die (2021)\n\nPlayed by: Léa Seydoux\n\nThere have been dozens of love interests for Bond over the years. Most are brief dalliances but two or three women affect him more deeply. Madeleine is one of the latter category. She’s the daughter of a recurring bad guy (who we’ll mention below) and a psychiatrist working at a swanky private clinic high up the Alps. Perhaps the snowbound setting triggers something subliminal in Daniel Craig’s 007 – a previous incarnation of the character fell in love with his wife in similar surroundings – because the pair are soon flirting like mad as they try to escape the bad guys. Their emotional connection is so rich, in fact, that Madeleine is still a big part of the storytelling in 2021’s No Time to Die…\n\n=10. Rene Mathis\n\nAppears in three films: Casino Royale (1967), Casino Royale (2006) & Quantum of Solace (2008)\n\nPlayed by: Duncan Macrae (1967), Giancarlo Giannini (above, 2006 & 2008)\n\nThe first instance on this list of a character who’s clearly not the same iteration in every appearance – for a start, he’s in two different adaptations of Casino Royale. After a comical policeman version featured in a 1960s spoof film, Rene joined the main series in 2006. Now, as in Ian Fleming’s source novel, he’s an MI6 contact who aids Bond while the latter attempts to win a high-stakes card game. Suspicions that Mathis is a traitor lead to him being tortured, but nevertheless he’s back in the following movie to again act as back-up to Bond.\n\n=10. The double-take tourist\n\nAppears in three films: The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), Moonraker (1979) & For Your Eyes Only (1981)\n\nPlayed by: Victor Tourjansky\n\nFor three consecutive Bond movies, viewers were treated to a running joke: once per film, the same man happened to be on the spot to see James Bond doing something outlandish. The part was played by an assistant director who was working on the Italian location shoot for The Spy Who Loved Me. He was asked to improvise something funny as he watched Bond drive his Lotus Esprit S1-cum-submarine out of the Mediterranean, so he got hold of a wine bottle and played a funny double take. Over the next two films, the gag was then repeated – the same man, always with alcohol in hand – as 007 drives a land-based gondola in Venice and chases a bad guy down a mountain in the Alps.\n\n=10. Rublevitch\n\nAppears in three films: The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), For Your Eyes Only (1981) & Octopussy (1983)\n\nPlayed by: Eva Rueber-Staier\n\nIn the late 70s and 80s, the Bond series built up a Cold War cast of regular characters to populate political scenes set in Whitehall and Moscow. We’ll come to the KGB’s head honcho in due course, but here is his loyal secretary. Played by a former Miss World, she was shameless eye candy – and there was often more than a hint of hanky-panky between her and her boss. You could argue that Rublevitch (sometimes spelt Rubelvitch) should actually be credited with four films in this list because Virginia Hey played a very similar character in The Living Daylights (1987). Hey’s ‘Rubavitch’ seems to have been a late replacement for Rublevitch after her boss was rewritten as a different man.\n\n=10. Charles Robinson\n\nAppears in three films: Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), The World in Not Enough (1999) & Die Another Day (2002)\n\nPlayed by: Colin Salmon\n\nCreated when actor Michael Kitchen wasn’t available to reprise his civil servant Tanner in Pierce Brosnan’s second adventure, Charles Robinson then stuck around for two further films. He acts as aide-de-camp to MI6 boss M and briefs Bond on his missions. He even gets to leave the stuffy confines of Whitehall and head out into the field – Azerbaijan in The World is Not Enough, the Korean DMZ in Die Another Day.\n\nCasting note: Colin Salmon was sometimes mooted as a potential 007 himself, and even did several screentests.\n\n=10. Mr White\n\nAppears in three films: Casino Royale (2006), Quantum of Solace (2008) & Spectre (2015)\n\nPlayed by: Jesper Christensen\n\nA shadowy figure in the reboot-tastic Casino Royale, Mr White then returns in two further Daniel Craig films – he essentially has one big scene in each. The character works as a fixer for the crime syndicate Quantum, which is part of a larger network of villainy called SPECTRE, and at first enjoys taunting Bond and his boss M over how little they know about the organisation. A few years later, however, we meet him again and he’s now a broken man, stripped of his power and estranged from his daughter Madeleine.\n\n=8. General Gogol\n\nAppears in six films: The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), Moonraker (1979), For Your Eyes Only (1981), Octopussy (1983), A View to a Kill (1985) & The Living Daylights (1987)\n\nPlayed by: Walter Gotell\n\nIn 1977, the main Bond series introduced two recurring bureaucrats who could represent the political muscle of the UK and the Soviet Union – and both men then appeared in every film for 10 years. The silky, smirky General Gogol was the acceptable face of the KGB – a man who may well plot and scheme behind closed doors, but who could share chummy chats with his colleagues in other countries. (Despite these films being made during the Cold War, the British and the Russians were often allies in a fight against a third-party bad guy.) As we mentioned above, Gogol was also enjoying an unprofessional relationship with his sexy secretary.\n\nCasting note: Fourteen years before being cast as Gogol, actor Walter Gotell had played a different character in From Russia With Love (1963).\n\n=8. Sir Frederick Gray MP\n\nAppears in six films: The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), Moonraker (1979), For Your Eyes Only (1981), Octopussy (1983), A View to a Kill (1985) & The Living Daylights (1987)\n\nPlayed by: Geoffrey Keen\n\nThe second of the two regular politicos introduced in The Spy Who Loved Me was the head of the UK’s Ministry of Defence, who’s often seen in M’s office pointing out what the Prime Minister expects of MI6. He and Bond perhaps have a long-standing friendship, as 007 calls him Freddie occasionally. Sir Frederick held his post for at least 10 years, whereas in the real world we saw five different Secretaries of State for Defence in that time: Labour’s Fred Mulley and the Conservatives Francis Pym, John Nott, Michael Heseltine and George Younger.\n\n7. Bill Tanner\n\nAppears in eight films: The Man With the Golden Gun (1974), For Your Eyes Only (1981), GoldenEye (1995), The World is Not Enough (1999), Quantum of Solace (2008), Skyfall (2012), Spectre (2015) & No Time to Die (2021)\n\nPlayed by: Michael Goodliffe (1974), James Villiers (1981), Michael Kitchen (1995 & 1999) & Rory Kinnear (above, with Daniel Craig as Bond; 2008-2021)\n\nTanner is a recurring presence in Ian Fleming’s source novels, acting as MI6’s chief of staff and as a pal of 007’s. But whereas his colleagues M and Miss Moneypenny have had prominent, near-permanent roles in the film series, Tanner has only cropped up sporadically. After one appearance in the 1970s and another in the 1980s (where he’s only referred to as Chief of Staff), he made more of an impression in the 1990s thanks to watchable performance from Michael Kitchen. This Tanner disapproved of his new boss – a female M – and was caught out making jokes about her. After the franchise was rebooted, the deadpan Rory Kinnear took over the role and, after the release of No Time to Die, will have played Tanner as often as everyone else put together.\n\n6. Ernst Stavro Blofeld\n\nAppears in nine films: From Russia With Love (1963), Thunderball (1965), You Only Live Twice (1967), On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1969), Diamonds Are Forever (1971), For Your Eyes Only (1981), Never Say Never Again (1983), Spectre (2015) & No Time to Die (2021)\n\nPlayed by: Anthony Dawson & Eric Pohlmann (1963 & 1965), Donald Pleasence (above; 1967), Telly Savalas (1969), Charles Gray (1971), John Hollis & Robert Rietti (1981), Max von Sydow (1983) & Christoph Waltz (2015 & 2021)\n\nThe most recurring villain in the Bond films is the head of an international network of well-funded criminals called SPECTRE (Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion). Initially, the powerful and terror-inducing Blofeld is shot obscurely: we don’t see his face, with Eric Pohlmann’s silky voice carrying the danger. He’s also often seen stroking his white cat. Then in his third appearance, his scarred visage is revealed – and he’s been recast with Donald Pleasence. That was the first of three consecutive movies with Blofeld as the bad guy – and three different actors played the part. Pleasance was followed by the similarly bald Telly Savalas and the distinctly hair-blessed Charles Gray. In the background of all this, however, were legal issues: Ian Fleming had co-created Blofeld with a writer called Kevin McClory, who asserted that he part-owned the character. So Blofeld then disappeared from the films – aside from a satirical cameo in 1981 and a full-blown appearance in 1983 (in a film produced by McClory). It was only after the rights issues were resolved that the character began making appearances again, with Christoph Waltz taking over the role in 2015. Before his true identity is revealed, this current iteration of Blofeld goes under the name of Franz Oberhauser… and, spoiler alert, we learn that he was James Bond’s childhood foster brother.\n\nCasting note: Two Blofeld actors had previously played other characters in Bond movies: Anthony Dawson was a villain in Dr No and Charles Gray was MI6’s ‘man in Japan’ in You Only Live Twice.\n\n5. Felix Leiter\n\nAppears in 11 films: Dr No (1962), Goldfinger (1964), Thunderball (1965), Diamonds Are Forever (1971), Live and Let Die (1973), Never Say Never Again (1983), The Living Daylights (1987), Licence to Kill (1989), Casino Royale (2006), Quantum of Solace (2008) & No Time to Die (2021)\n\nPlayed by: Jack Lord (1962), Cec Linder (1964), Rik Van Nutter (1965), Norman Burton (1971), David Hedison (above, with Roger Moore as Bond; 1973 & 1989), Bernie Casey (1983), John Terry (1987) & Jeffrey Wright (2006, 2008 & 2021)\n\nGiven that he’s been played by eight different actors – six only appearing once – it’s impressive that CIA agent Felix Leiter is still so memorable. A fixture in Ian Fleming’s novel series, Leiter was also a regular in the early days of the film series, featuring in five of the first eight movies. He’s Bond’s contact in the American intelligence community, and the two men quickly develop a trust, a good working relationship and an easy friendship. Felix’s appearances can sometimes be brief, but the one big exception is Licence to Kill in which the character marries (James is the best man) then goes through hell at the hands of a drugs baron. Before then he tended to be an upbeat, optimistic soul, but the rebooted iteration played by Jeffrey Wright since 2006 has added a world-weary edge to the character.\n\n4. Q\n\nAppears in 23 films: All except Dr No (1962), Live and Let Die (1973), Casino Royale (2006) & Quantum of Solace (2008)\n\nPlayed by: Desmond Llewelyn (above, with Timothy Dalton as Bond; 1963-1971 & 1974-1999), Geoffrey Bayldon (1967), Alex McGowen (1983), John Cleese (1999 & 2002) & Ben Whishaw (2012-2021)\n\nWe know for certain that not every ‘Q’ – code for quartermaster – is meant to be the same man. Not only was the part recast with a significantly younger actor in 2012, but 1999’s The World is Not Enough actually features two Qs: the longest-running version played by Desmond Llewelyn and his new assistant, jokingly referred to as R, who takes over the top job in the following movie. But an MI6 gadget-master who supplies Bond with his equipment has been a near-constant presence in the Eon Productions film series, as well as featuring in both of the ‘unofficial’ films. In his second appearance in Goldfinger, Llewelyn found the grumpy-but-avuncular persona that then became a vital part of the format; as Q shows off the latest gizmos to Bond, he grows more and more exasperated with 007’s slack attitude and sarcasm, but there’s also affection between the two men. Llewelyn’s iteration of the character is called Major Boothroyd while Never Say Never Again‘s equivalent is called Algernon. (Note: We’re choosing not to count a similar character in Dr No who was credited as Armourer.)\n\n3. Miss Moneypenny\n\nAppears in 25 films: All except Casino Royale (2006) & Quantum of Solace (2008)\n\nPlayed by: Lois Maxwell (above, with Sean Connery as Bond; 1962-1985), Barbara Bouchet (1967), Pamela Salem (1983), Caroline Bliss (1987 & 1989), Samantha Bond (1995-2002) & Naomie Harris (2012-2021)\n\nIn the 1960s, 70s and 80s, MI6 secretary Miss Moneypenny appeared in every James Bond film and was both an able assistant to big cheese M and a doting admirer of 007. Each film would contain a scene or two of Moneypenny and Bond engaging in some unprofessional yet harmless workplace flirting, with her hoping for some action and him teasing but never committing. (Given how many other women he beds in those decades – around 40 – it seems especially cruel that he doesn’t even take Moneypenny out for a steak dinner.) In 1995, however, the part was rethought for a less-sexist age: Samantha Bond took over and gave the character a confident, brassy reboot. The next iteration, played by Naomie Harris since 2012, goes even further: Moneypenny starts out as a field agent. This current version is also the first to be given an on-screen first name, Eve. (An earlier series of spin-off novels, The Moneypenny Diaries, had called her Jane).\n\n2. M\n\nAppears in 26 films: All but For Your Eyes Only (1981)\n\nPlayed by: Bernard Lee (1962-1979), John Huston (1967), David Niven (1967), Robert Brown (1983-1989), Edward Fox (1983), Judi Dench (above; 1995-2015) & Ralph Fiennes (2012-2021)\n\nBond creator Ian Fleming had worked for British intelligence before decamping to Jamaica to write his definitive spy novels, so he based James Bond’s Whitehall boss on a number of real-life people. (The codename ‘M’ is a variant of the ‘C’ used by the real heads of MI6 ever since its first director, Sir Mansfield George Smith-Cumming, began signing memos that way.) The character has only ever missed one film and that was because original actor Bernard Lee died soon before the filming of For Your Eyes Only and M’s part in the story was given to another character. For nearly 60 years, M has been Bond’s boss, the executive who issues his orders and sets his missions. At times there’s frustration with 007’s unconventional tactics and louche humour, but also a deep respect between the two colleagues. In the 1990s, the role was recast with Judi Dench – a bold move inspired by Stella Rimington running MI6 in the real world – which allowed the series to address its latent sexist attitudes. Dench even continued in the role after the franchise was rebooted in 2006. More recently, the position has been held by Ralph Fiennes’ Gareth Mallory, a former soldier turned politican who actually appeared alongside Dench’s M in Skyfall.\n\nCasting note: Robert Brown, who played M for four movies in the 1980s, had previously appeared in The Spy Who Loved Me as Admiral Hargreaves, a Royal Navy flag officer. A cute theory has it that his M *is* Admiral Hargreaves after a promotion to the head of MI6.\n\n1. Commander James Bond 007\n\nAppears in all 27 films\n\nPlayed by: Sean Connery (1962-1967, 1971 & 1983), David Niven (1967), George Lazenby (1969), Roger Moore (1973-1985), Timothy Dalton (1987 & 1989), Pierce Brosnan (1995-2002) & Daniel Craig (2006-2021)\n\nSecret agent James Bond is not a pure hero. He can be cruel and capricious and he’s a killer. He often treats women appallingly and displays a staggering privilege that would be objectionable in a real person. But 007 is also an incredibly capable and committed spy, travelling the world to defeat enemy agents and terrorists, risking all for Queen and country… and at the same time enjoying the finer things in life (the best drinks, the best clothes, the best hotels, the best cars, and especially the best women). He’s been played by actors from Scotland, England, Australia, Wales and Ireland, who were born in 1910, 1927, 1930, 1939, 1946, 1953 and 1968. In some stories he’s a rough-and-tumble rookie; in others he’s a middle-aged veteran. He’s been both stoic and sassy, patrician and playful, hard-edged and humorous.

No Time to Die, due for release in April 2021, may well be Craig’s swansong after a record-breaking 15 years in the role. Whoever comes next will have a rich legacy to live up to…"
