        "text": "Mobile Food Pantries are like farmers’ markets on wheels, delivering a variety of fresh fruits, vegetables, dairy products and baked goods to people in need of emergency food at no cost.\n\nThis schedule is provided as a courtesy. It is not guaranteed to be error free, and may be updated or changed at any time, so use it at your own risk. If you spot an error in one of the listings, please let us know.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all Mobile Pantries are scheduled in Eastern Standard Time.\n\nYou can also find this information—and many other food resources—in map form on our Resource Map. If you have questions about a specific Mobile Pantry, please contact the host agency.\n\nMany Mobile Food Pantry sites will allow you to pick up food as a proxy (stand-in) for another household that cannot physically attend. You will need to be prepared to provide the name, address and household size of any other family you are picking up for. Most Mobile Pantry sites have a limit on how many households you can pick up for and should tell you that limit if you ask."
