Van Raalte Press, 2020\n\nSix thematic chapters cover the growth of music and the Music Department at Hope College from 1862, when the college opened its doors to a handful of students, through 2015, when the Department of Music comprised thirteen full-time and twenty-eight part-time faculty.\n\nBuy Making Music\n\nHis Faithfulness Continues\n\nRobert P. Swierenga. His Faithfulness Continues: A History of Timothy Christian Schools of Chicagoland. Van Raalte Press, 2020\n\nThis is the remarkable story of the growth of a struggling, unaccredited school with one teacher and thirty-four students in 1911 to a fully accredited school of ninety full-time teachers and a student body of 1,091 in 2018, with buildings valued at $25 million and an annual operating budget of $12 million.\n\nBuy His Faithfulness Continues\n\nSharing Pasts\n\nSharing Pasts: Dutch Americans through Four Centuries. Van Raalte Press, 2017\n\nThroughout their now four-centuries-long presence in America, Dutch Americans upheld a staunch commitment to education and inquiry that led to their establishing many grammar schools, academies, day schools, colleges, universities and seminaries. Such places of learning and their graduates, especially those at the post-secondary level, created fertile ground for Dutch Americans to also enquire after their own history in their new home and the part it played in the larger American story. Beginning in the nineteenth century and finding its stride in the twentieth century, Dutch American history carved out its place and identity alongside other American ethnic histories. With only some one-and-a-half percent of the nation’s population, the volume and breadth of the body of work in Dutch American history and culture is quite remarkable.\n\nTopics of these twelve papers fall under five headings: “Immigration, Wilderness and Cultural Persistence,” which examines several hitherto unexplored aspects of the Dutch American experience; “Dutch American Culture Moving West” considers the geographic expansion of Dutch culture after the English took over New Netherland; in “Dutch and Indians under English Colonial Rule,” we see how the unique and important relations with the Indians, gained by the early Dutch around Albany and other settlers in parts of New England, proved to be vital for later generations; two very different papers are grouped under the heading “American Influence on Dutch Communities and Church”; and “Rekindling Affection for the Netherlands” examines a time when Dutch culture in America threatened to become forgotten.\n\nBuy Sharing Pasts\n\nThe Shafer Anthem\n\n“I Will Lift Up Mine Eyes (Psalm 121),” 2017\n\nHope College's Sesquicentennial Celebration featured “I Will Lift Up Mine Eyes (Psalm 121),” composed for Hope by highly respected choral conductor Robert Shafer through a commission from Dr. Thelma (Tommye) Leenhouts, a 1966 Hope graduate. Written for choir and organ, it was performed by the college’s Chapel Choir in the Concert Hall of the Jack H. Miller Center for Musical Arts on Saturday, April 30, 2016.\n\nShafer’s career as a choral conductor, composer, educator and church musician in the Washington, D.C., area spans nearly 50 years. He has been artistic director of the City Choir of Washington since its launch in 2007, and was previously music director of the Washington Chorus for more than 35 years. Among other acclaim, he won the Best Choral Performance Grammy in 2000 for a live concert recording of Benjamin Britten’s War Requiem.\n\nHope College at 150\n\nHope College at 150: Anchored in Faith, Engaging the World, 2019\n\nWinner of the 2019 Historical Society of Michigan State History Award\n\nJacob E.

Holland, MI: Van Raalte Press, 2016.\n\nIn October 1944, as war raged across the globe, Ed and Ruth Luidens set sail with unbounded optimism from Philadelphia to a life as missionaries in the Middle East. After three grueling months of stop-and-start trekking, the young couple arrived in Basrah, Iraq, to begin two years of intensive Arabic language training. They were immediately thrust into a world rent by the ravages of colonialism, by massive ethnic and religious migration, and by lingering battlefield hostility. Throughout this experience they wrote vivid descriptions to their parents, letters which form the basis of Seeds of Hope, Seeds of Hate.\n\nThe letters reveal that Ruth was introduced to the private domain of Iraqi women, Moslem and Christian alike. In the harems, sanctuaries for wives and children, she learned of women’s hopes and fears, of their growing restiveness with a hide-bound structure which closeted many of them while their husbands met the world outside. At the same time, Ed encountered the men in the public arena, discovering their growing nationalism, their frustration with centuries of imperial domination and manipulation, and their hopes for a better future for their fellow citizens. This volume sets the stage for the story of their decades of work among Arab folk from Bahrain to Beirut, a story which is still to come.\n\nPaperback: 107 of pages\n\nBuy Seeds of Hope, Seeds of Hate\n\nHope Beyond Borders\n\nStephen I. Hemenway. Hope Beyond Borders: The Life and Letters of Paul Fried. Holland, MI: Van Raalte Press, 2014.\n\nPaul Fried occasionally spoke of a desire to write an autobiographical memoir or a novel based on his wartime experiences, but he never completed this task. Indeed, he seldom even spoke about the many traumatic events that peppered his life from 1919 to 1945.\n\nAfter examining Fried’s extensive autobiographical notes, carbon copies of at least 10,000 personal letters that he wrote and preserved, and other personal papers, Hemenway has produced a fully researched biography of one of Hope College’s most endearing and brilliant professors. This book is at once a serious treatment of discrimination and persecution, refugee status, unsuccessful efforts to save family members and WWII exploits, and a humorous look at Paul’s passion for automobiles, food and travel as told by Paul with insight and wry humor.\n\nPaperback: 454 pages\n\nBuy Hope Beyond Borders\n\nEnduring Legacy\n\nJacob E. Nyenhuis and George Harinck, eds. The Enduring Legacy of Albertus C. Van Raalte as Leader and Liaison. Holland, MI: Van Raalte Press; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2014.\n\nThe celebration of the bicentennial of the birth of Albertus C. Van Raalte in October 2011 provided a distinct opportunity to evaluate the legacy of one of the best known Dutch immigrants of the 19th century. By focusing exclusively on him and his leadership, rather than on the community that he founded, we are able better to understand his character, his challenges and his contributions.\n\nThese essays were all presented at the international conference held in Holland, Michigan, and Ommen, Overijssel, the Netherlands, with the conference theme of “Albertus C. Van Raalte: Leader and Liaison.” They are here presented in three broad categories which serve as the organizing principle for this book: biographical essays, thematic essays and reception studies.\n\nHardcover: 517 pages\n\nBuy The Enduring Legacy of Albertus C.

Holland, MI: Van Raalte Press; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2014.\n\nWinner of the 2014 Historical Society of Michigan State History Award\n\nThe first-ever, comprehensive history of Holland and the surrounding regions recounts the remarkable transformation of this area from its humble origins as a Dutch immigrant colony and college town into one of the most significant and prosperous communities on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan. By dint of hard work, thrift and sharing, the enterprising residents developed thriving industries in leather, fine furniture and food processing and in the 20th century, shipbuilding, automotive parts and office furniture.\n\nThe All-American City, with a high rate of homeownership and rated second nationally on the Happiness Index, is rich in churches, public and Christian schools, social services, and cultural and leisure opportunities. The town-gown relationship is strong, and the senior citizens center is unparalleled nationally. Eighth Street — Holland’s “Main Street” — is alive with shops and eateries. With this publication, Holland is that rare city with a comprehensive account of its history from Indian habitat to dynamic and thriving city. Nearly 900 photographs, documents, maps and charts illuminate the text and make this monumental work a “big splash” in a small city.\n\nHardcover: 2,618 pages\n\nDutch Americans and War\n\nRobert P.

Holland, MI: Van Raalte Press, 2014.\n\nPapers from the Nineteenth Biennial Conference of the Association for the Advancement of Dutch American Studies (AADAS), Pella, Iowa, June 2013.\n\nSince the mid-nineteenth century, the successful prosecution of American wars involved the entire population. Wars had become total, including immigrant groups, like the Dutch, who were caught up in conflicts before they had mastered the language of the land or before they had even become citizens. Wars actually hastened assimilation as immigrants stood shoulder to shoulder with Americans of all nationalities in fighting the nation’s wars and defending the home front by their labor and sacrifice.\n\nThis volume recounts Dutch American responses from the Civil War to the Vietnam War, both as citizens and soldiers.\n\nPaperback: 400 pages\n\nDiverse Destinies\n\nNella Kennedy, Mary Risseeuw, and Robert P.

Early scholarship often betrayed the anti-Catholic bias of Protestant researchers, and the settlements in Wisconsin were clearly more isolated from each other than those in Iowa and Michigan, which allowed them to develop patterns unlike those elsewhere. The papers from this conference begin to explore the heretofore largely untapped history of Dutch kolonies in Wisconsin and the East.\n\nPaperback: 278 pages\n\nBuy Diverse Destinies\n\nAcross Borders\n\nJacob E.

Holland, MI: Van Raalte Press, 2010.\n\nPapers from the Seventeenth Biennial Conference of the Association for the Advancement of Dutch American Studies (AADAS), Ancaster, Ontario, Canada, June 2009.\n\nThe theme “across borders” was chosen for this conference in part to reflect the literal passage across borders, which this meeting in Canada entailed for AADAS members from the United States. Yet “across borders” also embodied more figurative meanings, such as comparisons between generations, as well as the search for identity which meant replicating or replacing previous ideas and practices in a new setting or because of different circumstances. Separation also featured prominently in the theme of Christian institutions: churches, labor unions and other groups. The ringing attention to religion found in previous AADAS conferences resonated even deeper in this case. In other ways, the conference echoed and amplified topics from the past.\n\nPaperback: 269 pages\n\nBuy Across Borders\n\nDutch-American Arts and Letters\n\nRobert P. Swierenga, Jacob E.

This conference was devoted to the exploration of the arts in the formation of a Dutch American subculture.\n\nThe result of “this colorful palette of essays” (as Hans Krabbendam says in his introduction to the book) shows that “Although developing the arts was not a priority of the pioneers, they did develop, thanks to a well-developed network of communication” and were important in the “process of selecting and preserving elements of the past for future use in shaping cultural and ethnic identities on both sides of the Atlantic.”\n\nPaperback: 234 pages\n\nBuy Dutch-American Arts and Letters\n\nEnvisioning Hope College\n\nElton J.

Holland, MI: Van Raalte Press; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2011.\n\nThese 94 letters of Albertus C. Van Raalte, founder of the city of Holland, Michigan, to Philip Phelps Jr., who became the first president of Hope College, are significant for two reasons in particular. First, of all the publications about Van Raalte — beginning in 1893 with the first of five biographies — none reveals fully who the man really was, since Van Raalte’s words are rarely quoted. In these letters, Van Raalte’s voice is unscripted and clear. The reader can learn much about his character and personality from what he wrote to Phelps, his coworker and friend.\n\nSecond, these letters are deeply personal because they were written to his close friend and confidant. The extant letters of Van Raalte number in the hundreds, but few of his correspondents were as trusted as Phelps. Van Raalte’s dominant personality, as well as his drive to develop the Holland colony that he founded in 1847, left little room for the development of close friendships. Phelps was part of Van Raalte’s inner circle, and due to their kinship and the common cause of Christian higher education, Van Raalte opened his mind and heart to an extent that he rarely did with others. These letters therefore reveal more of his personality and inner feelings than any other of his extensive body of writings.\n\nHardcover: 520 pages\n\nBuy Envisioning Hope College\n\nAlbertus and Christina\n\nElton J.

Van Raalte, and his wife Christina de Moen. Drawing on previously compiled genealogical information, archival records, and family letters and photographs, the authors worked diligently to “set the record straight” and provide a document future historians and genealogists can build on.

It is usually not a compliment when Protestants call each other Pope; this word has been a weapon in ecclesiastical battles. Is it true that Van Raalte acted as Pope of the Classis of Holland?

Included are photographs of the bronze-casting process, the installation of the sculpture and Centennial Park. Appendices include a biography of Van Raalte, the ship’s passenger list for the Southerner on which Van Raalte and his followers sailed in September 1846 from Rotterdam to New York, and a history of Centennial Park, including the names of all area members of the armed services who died in wartime from the Civil War to the Vietnam War.\n\nHardcover: 122 pages\n\nBuy A Dream Fulfilled\n\nOld Wing Mission\n\nRobert P.

Old Wing Mission: Cultural Interchange as Chronicled by George and Arvilla Smith in Their Work with Chief Wakazoo’s Ottawa Band on the West Michigan Frontier. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans/Reformed Church Press, 2008.\n\nThe story of the Ottawa Indians in West Michigan is told here primarily through the diaries and memoirs of George and Arvilla Smith, a Protestant missionary and his wife, who lived and raised their family among the Ottawa Indians. Memoranda and letters are also included, giving a fuller picture of the trials of frontier missionaries. The book begins with an introductory chapter on the history of Old Wing Mission.\n\nThe Smiths established their mission near modern-day Holland, Michigan, in the 1830s; their outpost was called the Old Wing Mission. The Smiths provided worship services, education for the children, and, in addition, communicated with the federal government on behalf of the Ottawa Indians. The diary and memorandum of George Smith cover the period 1838–49; Arvilla’s diary begins and ends earlier, 1832–45. Also included in the book are Arvilla Smith’s memoirs, published in the Grand Traverse Herald, Traverse City, Michigan, in 1892; an essay on the “Life and Work of the Late Rev. George N. Smith: A Pioneer Missionary,” by Etta Smith Wilson, his daughter; and relevant correspondence in the records of the Michigan Superintendent of Indian Affairs, 1839–50.\n\nHardcover: 684 pages\n\nBuy Old Wing Mission\n\nAunt Tena\n\nJacob E.

Grand Rapids: Eerdmans/Reformed Church Press, 2009.\n\nFocusing on her service in remote Lupwe, Nigeria, through the Christian Reformed Church from 1937 to 1954, this volume provides insight into the foreign-mission experience of long-time medical missionary and nurse Tena A. Huizenga. It tells the story primarily through her correspondence with family and friends, her journals and her published articles, and includes chapters by historian Harry Boonstra which provide biographical and historical context concerning Huizenga and her service as well as the Christian Reformed Church’s support of missions in Nigeria.\n\n“This intensely human volume guides us through 17 memorable years of Nigerian mission history,” said Eugene Rubingh, former executive secretary of Christian Reformed World Missions. “Drawn from Tena Huizenga’s own letters, the events are sketched through the lens of joy and tears, of small victories and unimaginable obstacles.

This book is not a biography of Scholte, although it does contain biographical material. By making available information about events in the Netherlands between 1815 and 1847, this book enables American readers to come to a better understanding not only of the contribution of Scholte but also of several issues that led to controversy among the leaders in the Secession. More detailed knowledge of those issues can also help Reformed denominations in America and Canada move beyond 19th- and early-20th-century polemical writings about the Secession of 1834 that still hamper moving forward in cooperation today.\n\nPaperback: 270 pages\n\nBuy Hendrik P.

For decades, this diary of Jacob Van Hinte, author of the monumental Netherlanders in America, has been hidden in the archives of the Van Hinte family. Until now, it has been available only in Dutch.\n\nVan Hinte’s diary is quite compressed, yet it is rich in insights and detail. We travel with him in our imagination from Rotterdam by ship to America, in and across America by all the means of transport available in 1921 — steamboat, taxi cab, ferry boat, street car, subway, train, interurban railway, automobile and paddle boat.

It explores the reasons that prompted Dutch religious separatists to emigrate to the United States, founding settlements like Holland and takes a close look at major events in their history such as the Holland Classis joining the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church in the United States, the 1857 secession that produced the Christian Reformed Church and the Masonic controversy that led to more division in 1882. Although the book deals with the division and strife within the Dutch Reformed Church, it grew out of a spirit of reconciliation and an ardent desire for unity.\n\nPaperback: 150 pages\n\nBuy Family Quarrels\n\nFaith, Family, and Fortune\n\nPeter Ester.

Several of these companies have turned into megabusinesses. Dutch American entrepreneurs have done well and have left their mark on the West Michigan economy. But most of these Dutch American entrepreneurs are committed Protestants, active members of Reformed churches and firm believers in Calvinist doctrines. Somehow Calvinism and entrepreneurship go well together and, in combination, prosper in the American cultural context. To clarify this relationship is one of the main goals of this study.\n\nPaperback: 111 pages\n\nBuy Faith, Family, and Fortune\n\nA Goodly Heritage\n\nJacob E. Nyenhuis, ed.

Bruins, who is retired from the Hope College faculty (1966–92), where he was the Evert C. and Hattie E. Blekkink Professor of Religion, chairperson of the department and dean for Arts and Humanities; he also is retired from directing the Van Raalte Institute (1994–2002). This festschrift was presented to Dr. Bruins in honor of his 80th birthday.\n\nThe 15 essays in the volume fall into three categories, all reflecting different aspects of Bruins’s career. The first 10 concern church history and theology, the next two focus on different aspects of the life of Rev. A. C. Van Raalte, and the final three deal with local history. The topics range from religious conflict in the 19th century to the Civil War, to Hope College history, to the effort to create the Joint Archives of Holland, to recent ideological conflict in the field of Reformation history, to contemporary issues in the Reformed Church of America.\n\nHardcover: 412 pages\n\nBuy A Goodly Heritage\n\nTools for Understanding\n\nJames Hart Brumm, ed. Tools for Understanding: Essays in Honor of Donald J. Bruggink. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans/Reformed Church Press, 2009.\n\nThis book is a collection of 12 essays in honor of Donald J. Bruggink to celebrate the occasion of his 80th birthday and to mark the publication of the 60th volume of the Historical Series of the Reformed Church in America, of which Bruggink serves as the general editor.\n\n“History as a tool for understanding” was a favorite phrase used by Bruggink when he was teaching classes in historical theology at Western Theological Seminary in Holland, Michigan. That phrase is a reminder that history helps us understand the church, our churches and the scriptures. In this volume, the essays are tools for understanding four areas of Bruggink’s life and ministry: Western Seminary, where he spent significant time for half of his life; the study of history, a passion of his since Central College days; theological education, the primary vocation for most of his ministry; and the nature of God and the Church. Architecture of worship spaces, a primary interest of Bruggink, is integral to an essay in the final section.\n\nHardcover: 352 pages\n\nBuy Tools for Understanding\n\nHistoric Dutch Sites\n\nRobert P. Swierenga, author; Jacob E. Nyenhuis, ed; Mark Cook, maps; Historic Dutch Sites In The Holland/Zeeland Area, Van Raalte Press, 2015\n\nThis guide is a revision and expansion by Robert P. Swierenga of one by Henry Ippel, which was published in 1996 by the Dutch American Historical Commission (DAHC).\n\nThis new version of Dutch Sites has 18 additional sites, many new photographs and some excellent detailed maps by Mark Cook. One of the most significant changes is the addition of colored maps as a centerfold and as a separate enlargement that has been tucked into every guide. A special feature of this guide is the addition of the Elfstedenfietstocht (Eleven-City Bicycle Tour), which is modeled after the Elfstedentocht (Eleven-City Tour), which consists of a skating tour to eleven cities in the northern provinces of the Netherlands held whenever the canals are frozen solid. The route for the bicycle tour was developed by an ad hoc committee of Greg Holcombe, chair; Henk Aay; George Heerema; and Jacob E. Nyenhuis.\n\nBuy Historic Dutch Sites"
