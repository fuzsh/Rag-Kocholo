Series III (“Correspondence between HIAS and HICEM Offices”) contains several files with correspondence relevant to our guide, namely correspondence between Max Gottschalk and other individuals. See file III-3 (i.a. concerning Emile Kowarski, former director of the Brussels Refugee Committee; 1941), III-24 (between Gottschalk and Max Warburg, i.a. concerning internees in Belgium; 1940-1941), III-25 (correspondence from Gottschalk; 1941), III-31 (idem, including an article on HIAS by Gottschalk; 1944) and III-33 (correspondence between Ilja Dijour and Gottschalk; 1945).
