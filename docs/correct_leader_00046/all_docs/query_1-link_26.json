        "text": "I don’t know about you, but I have the feeling I blinked twice and we are six months into 2024. This post marks the beginning of June, month 8 in Saudi Arabia. Time flies when you are having fun! I look back on a month filled with friends, work, and exploring Riyadh. Whilst normally I focus most on work -and trust me that has been the majority of my hours this last month, I thought it would be fun to spice it up this month and share some other insights. I had one of my closest friends visiting me and at the beginning of the month and we explored new areas, souks, restaurants, malls and museums in the city. The days were so packed that we didn’t even go out of Riyadh. One ‘first’ for me too was a visit to the abaya mall. Yes, you read that correctly. A shopping mall only for abaya’s. It was a wonderful experience to see and learn the diversity in styles, colours and prints. Some women have informed me that by the kind of abaya people wear you can tell where they are from in the Kingdom or region and or how strict they are in their religion. I notice that wearing them generates more respect in your professional life although it is not mandatory to do so. And I’ve learned that there are hardly any fitting rooms in shops in Riyadh, luckily you can fit abaya’s over your normal clothes. One of the other things that keeps surprising me is the traffic here. Especially visitors need a moment to get adjusted. The roads are (overly) crowded, the driving is very chaotic and non-anticipatory. There are endless u-turns, the concept of lanes is non-existent– drivers just create the amount of lanes as required by the volume of traffic -and unexpected speedbumps. So you need to pay attention and bring your A-game. Every time I’ve made it through another ‘do my breaks work well enough to avoid a crash’ I’m glad to see my car is still in one piece, as am I. Also I couldn’t imagine not driving here, as the city is build around cars. There is hardly any public transport and with the rising heat I start to understand why people go from airco to airco. Speaking of rising temperatures… The temperature is reaching mid 40s and you start to feel it in your lungs and your eyes. The best quote last week was ‘this is just the appetizer’ so I’m bracing myself for what is to come. I wish you all a lovely beginning of the summer period, I will keep you posted on our adventures here. Some personal pictures to illustrate: 1. Abaya fitting 2. Dinner in a traditional Saudi restaurant 3. Roshn Front, a popular area for Saudis to go out in the evening (north Riyadh) #Riyadh #summer #heat #adventures #werkeninhetbuitenland #woneninhetbuitenland #monthlyupdates #Saudi #traffic #touristinyourowncity\n\nThe past month has flown by, and this is already month 7 now! It has been an eventful month, I’ve travelled to Bahrain, Oman, had family over, experienced my first ‘Eid’ vacation here, visited my European friends and family and partially closed out my project and had my first team days in full composition. It was good to finally see my friends and family again but landing in Riyadh (see picture) made me feel like I arrived home – in a vibrant and buzzing environment. As this is a professional forum let me focus on the work-aspect. As you know I have, together with others, been working on a project that created a new operating model for ACWA Power. Changes (and ideas behind it), starting at the top, need to be cascaded down. For the last month so called ‘change management’ has been crucial. What do new ideas actually mean in practice? And what adjustments need to be made in communication, ways of working and systems for example? A working group consisting of colleagues ranging from HR to Digital has worked tirelessly to make sure this was all put in place and with only a few very specific open ends we decided to close out the project this week. Impressed to see what the team has pulled off in such a short timeframe. Of course this doesn’t mean the work is done, we are now diving into detailed design, (strategic) workforce planning and other topics. At the end of April we had our first team days, completely staffed up, focused on upskilling. The topic of Organizational Design and Effectiveness (also known as OD OE) is rather new in the region so luckily we managed to get support from Q5 (Consultants) for two days to train the team on organizational design methodology. It is a course at high speed for the team but they are up for the challenge! In case you don’t follow me on Instagram (@dutchielivingabroad) please allow me to share three pictures here. One of an outfit that gives me the most compliments here in Saudi (I think due to the similarity of their outfits) and a picture of life here. This is Roshn Front, close to home and the office and filled with little restaurants and cafés. And of course, the view over Riyadh when arriving by plane. See you next month! #acwapower #renewables #q5 #energy #transformation #organizationaldesign #effectiveness #OD #OE #work #riyadh #middleeast #saudi\n\nI’m writing this whilst listening to the Mattheus Passion from Bach (as today marks Easter Monday) knowing that next week Eid al-Fitr is celebrated (the end of the Ramadan). I think it is safe to say this has been the most remarkable Ramadan you can encounter whilst living in the country that holds the origin of the Islam. I’ve missed all iftars (the meal where they break their fast at the end of the day) and my main engagements have been offline (whilst recovering from my ski injury). But no complaining, recovery is on track! I hear the streets are buzzing at night, and I’ve noticed that hospital and dentist appointments are possible at unreasonable hours (according to Dutch standards). They easily schedule you past midnight – just to give you an idea. One of the things I’ve noticed is that the working hours change drastically during Ramadan: 10AM-4PM (compared to 8AM-5PM). At the beginning of the month, I noticed people had to get adjusted to fasting– indicating to me that some meetings could better take place post iftar. I’ve also heard that things don’t slow down as much during Ramadan as they used to do. And I’m thankful for that as this month also marked the official growth of my own team with two new team members joining. We are ready to keep contributing to Acwa Power with some more female power 😉 As promised last month I would also share some of my latest insights. Via my Dutch contacts I’ve landed in the Sulaiman Al Habib Hospital. It was my first time (!) encountering male and female waiting rooms. However, the main thing that will stick with me is how digitally advanced things are over here and how you – as a patient- have access to all your own data. And by all data I mean ALL data (scans, results, notes from the doctor - you get my point). Primary care isn’t thriving here yet – so you can make your own appointments via the app, coupled to your insurance, with the specialist you want to see and go straight to the hospital. They check all that is needed straight away (in my case for example blood tests and bone density tests) and you fly through the hospital. Your get a text notification if there is an update in your app (payment, insurance or record wise), and the speed at which it all happens is an example for elsewhere. You are in full control of your own data and nothing happens without your consent. And yes – this post also marks six months stay in Saudi Arabia. And with pleasant 30 degrees outside on April 1st, we’ve encountered some severe rain- and hailstorms last month. People tell me this marks the change in season and whilst I’m enjoying the weather now I can’t deny to be a bit daunted for the hot summer yet to come. Do you want to know more about day to day life?

I arrived back in Riyadh this week with a bit of a plot twist, during a week of skiing in Europe I broke my lower back. Not too thrilled about mandatory bed rest, but I will now experience a side of Saudi that I’m actually fascinated by. Did you know international medical teams travel to Saudi to learn and see why things work so smoothly in their healthcare system here? So, stay tuned for some insights on that in the next update. I was not anticipating my update to be about me personally. I wanted to share that ACWA Power announced a new operating model that we, as a team, together with consultants (The Little Group and Q5), have been working on since I joined. We are setting the organization up for growth, less silos and more cross collaboration. On February 15th our CEO announced the new Management Committee composition and addressed the company on the rationale behind the proposed evolution of our company. Acwa Power has four core geographies (KSA, Central Asia, China and Middle East Africa, Southeast Asia) that will support the Business Units (Development, Construction, Operations) to deliver. This is all supported by so called functions (think HR, legal, finance). Change doesn’t only affect the top layer though, it is a challenging project that can only be delivered when the whole team, the whole organization joins in. Ensuring the right assessments are done, the right data is gathered, strict planning executed, and implementation prioritized. I can go into way more details but for the broad audience here I’ll keep it at a high level. It means that even though I’m on bed rest, I can’t completely let go as we want to make sure the implementation is done as good as we can. And simultaneously we have already started new projects to help progress Acwa Power into the best organization it can be. For the people that are less interested in the work update: from my window I see the sun shining here in Riyadh and it feels like we are leaving winter behind and heading straight into summer (29 C today)! Until next month! #dontforgettofollowmyadventures #instagram #dutchielivingabroad #saudi #europe #middleeast #skiinjury #adventure #neveradullmoment #workingabroad #werkeninhetbuitenland #HR #organizationaldesign #energy #power #vision #future #healthcare 📷 by Omaro Productions (clearly not taken this week 😉)\n\nFeb 1st, four months already today! As my brother, Jeroen van Zeeland, said to me this week ‘Elies, this definitely means that the honeymoon is over’, and that is correct. Sometimes I still need to let it sink in that I live in Riyadh – it feels crazy, exciting, and so normal at the same time. There are things I can’t get used to: these tremendously big supermarkets, I just miss my ‘own’ little Albert Heijn. But the friendliness of people and the weather – oh my, I love it. Last week I had a good insight in how ‘we’ in the Western world perceive report on what is happening in the Middle East. My friends started drip feeding me messages that said “there would be an liquor store in Riyadh in the Diplomatic Quarter”. And although I appreciate the jokiness of that (you know I love a good glass of wine) – there is a fundamental mismatch in what ‘we’ in the Western world see of the developments versus what is happening on the ground. I’m aware of geopolitical challenges and I’m appreciative that I will be careful to mingle publicly in that. I hope you allow me to focus on my work and personal life here, for now. As you know I work for ACWA Power, a company leading the energy transition worldwide, present in over 12 countries. A company that has grown so rapidly that the functions (HR, IT, Finance, Legal etc) are sometimes still catching up with the core business. A company where there is more work to do than sometimes fits in 24 hours (hello personal challenge). A company that changes the future of our energy supply, project by project, country by country. I am highly motivated to contribute to the energy transition and so make the world a better place. I believe I can really make a difference in this company by sharing my expertise. There are more moments and insights to share than will fit in one post. But let me highlight two more personal ones. I really notice that I’ve become more accepted. People that I engage with start to open up, about their lives in their late thirties without a husband, or a husband that is proposed to them overnight. They are curious what my thoughts are, and I try to balance personal views with cultural sensitivity and appreciation. One that still wanders I my mind was during my first business lunch. A few women mentioned that it is so unsafe in Europe these days. I thought I overheard wrongly and asked, ‘sorry what?!’, and they said ‘Yes, Paris, London these days are very unsafe, you can’t just leave your phone on the table and look the other way’. And I laughed, as they were completely right. Whilst here you can leave your phone or your whole bag, go to the bathroom and you will come back with everything untouched. Of course, repercussions are different here, but daily life so far hasn’t felt safer anywhere else.

I cannot believe I’m already flying back to Europe for Christmas in less than a month. This week it was announced that Riyadh will host the World Expo in 2030 and although it didn’t give all residents a day off like the authorities directed when winning the world cup, the spirit is extremely high in the country. With heads of state visiting Riyadh constantly Saudi is more center of the world than one might think. I feel that working in this country and in this region is opening my eyes. I start to see the differences culturally, how we work, how we act and how we engage. And how only working in Europe so far has shaped my behaviour and my thinking. Being here and observing without judgement whilst keeping my learner mindset will teach me so much – I’m convinced about that. I bought myself a yearly subscription to The Economist and listen to that now as a weekly podcast. I notice a shift in my interest from Britain and the European Union to the Middle-East. The Economist dedicated an entire edition to it last week – where they mainly focus on the UAE, in light of the current COP28, but also on the role of Saudi in the region. Worth your time. I would recommend everyone to look across their known borders, both physically and emotionally. It will open your eyes to what is happening in the world and what dynamics are not on our radar but might influence our future more than you think. #future #growth #energytransition #opportunities #Europe #SaudiArabia #MiddleEast #COP28 #Dubai #UAE 📷 by Omaro Productions\n\nLast month I shared that I’ve moved to Saudi Arabia to work for ACWA Power. Today marks exactly one month in Riyadh. The beginning of that new journey is now my life. I’ve been immersed in a country filled with hospitality, friendliness and people with an open mind. Yes, really! I’ve moved to a country focused on growth, transition and a government that captures that in Vision 2030 which fills their inhabitants with pride. I see and experience all that on a daily basis. ACWA Power has tremendous growth ambitions, supported by big investors. The company isn’t aiming to double but to triple in size in the next few years. As executive director organizational effectiveness I have the opportunity to shape, develop and grow that department. To help build the future of ACWA Power. To build the energy of the future. Back in Europe I’ve heard that ‘investors are maybe not so interested in renewables’ but come and take a look here! This month was also marked by administrative challenges. What is an ‘iqama’, why do I need it and how do I use it, what apps do I need to have and use (and how do I pronounce the names correctly), how to understand package deliveries and so the list goes on. I can assure you it was sometimes challenging but also made for a good laugh and I enjoyed little ‘victories’ when I made some progress. As I’m getting a lot of questions about living and working here, I decided to capture and share all my daily adventures, insights and surprises via Dutchie Living Abroad. DLA is for now only available via Instagram – if you are curious about a country that was secluded for so long and is now only one click away on your social media timeline, follow me there. I’ve been asked if it isn’t daunting, living here. At times? For sure. But if you ask me if I’m excited about this adventure? All the time! #werkeninhetbuitenland #saudiarabia #nederland #dutch #dutchielivingabroad #movingabroad #work #travel #future #renewableenergy #renewables #growth #transformation #organizationaldesign #organizationaldevelopment #organizationaleffectiveness"
