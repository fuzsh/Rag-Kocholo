        "text": "Some people make watches; others watch time. The Dekkers did both.\n\nCornelius Dekker was a watchmaker. He opened a jewelry store in The Netherlands in 1850. In 1876, his son — Dirk Henry Dekker — immigrated to Zeeland and opened a grocery store in front of his house at 37 E. Main Ave. — the present day home of the Dekker Huis Museum.\n\nMore History: John Roost and his love of business, politics\n\nMore History: Van Raalte's son was a patriot, farmer and merchant\n\nMore History: The legacy of Anthony and Henry DeKruif\n\nAt Dirk’s urging, Cornelius immigrated to Zeeland in 1882. In 1892, Cornelius and another son, Denghus, built a house and store directly across the street from Dirk Henry’s store where North Street Christian Reformed Church is today.\n\nIn 1915, Dirk's son, Henry, opened a jewelry store at 37 E. Main Ave. In 1922, his son — Randall Dekker — was born in the house behind the store. In 1929, Henry contracted with the Moeke Lumber Company to build him a one-story shop at 124 E. Main Ave.\n\nIn 1946, Henry hired Gerrit Van Kampen, then 23 years old and a World War II veteran. Gerrit, initially a tool and die-maker, had lost a foot and part of his leg to gangrene after being hit by shrapnel from an exploding mortar shell.\n\nBecause he had difficulty standing for long periods of time, he had to find a job in which he could sit. So, he attended Pine Lake Vocational School in Plainwell — a school founded and financed in 1944 by the W.W. Kellogg Foundation — to study repairing, which led to his application with Henry Dekker.\n\nRandall Dekker bought the jewelry store from his father in 1950 — but Randall was more a lawyer than a jeweler. While Van Kampen ran the jewelry and watch-repairing business out of the front of the store, Randall, a graduate of Hope College and De Paul Law School, used the back of the store for his law practice.\n\nFrom that office, he helped First Michigan Bank launch its trust department and served as Zeeland’s city attorney. In 1958, Randall started working at Zeeland State Bank. In 1959, he moved his office out of the jewelry store.\n\nBy then, Randall had become known as Zeeland’s resident historian and storyteller. His favorite stories were about people who owned and operated small businesses. He was also known for his morning and afternoon coffee breaks at the “back table” at Bosch’s Restaurant, located at 120 E. Main Ave. — where he got information for some of his stories.\n\nEventually those stories were recorded by his assistant at the bank, Sandy Grysen, and later published in a booklet called \"Main Street Memoir.\"\n\nIn 1973, Randall became president of First Michigan Bank, which had become a holding company for several regional banks, including the Zeeland State Bank. In 1974, he sold the jewelry business to Van Kampen.\n\nSubscribe: Learn more about our latest subscription offers!\n\nVan Kampen's son, Gary, started helping out his dad at the jewelry store in 1978 after he had been laid off from a construction job. Gary remembers his father’s routine.\n\n“Dad would take an hour for lunch,” he said. “He liked to play pool, so he’d hurry over to Bosch’s Restaurant. They could see him coming so they put on a ‘Gerrit Burger.’ He’d quickly eat it and walk over to Toby Buikema's place [131 E. Main Ave.] to shoot pool.”\n\nAt that time, Dekker’s Jewelry had four employees. Van Kampen and one other employee fixed watches, Kay Vander Hulst watched the sales floor and Gary did whatever else had to be done.\n\nRandall retired from First Michigan Bank in 1987. Gary bought the jewelry business from his father in 1988.\n\nRandall Dekker died in 2003. Notably, his funeral procession drove down Main Avenue. Gerrit Van Kampen passed away in 2010.\n\nInformation from this story comes from an interview with Gary Van Kampen in 2005 and the “back table” at Frank’s Restaurant, Randall Dekker’s \"Main Street Memoir,\" and the obituary of Gerrit Van Kampen."
