        "text": "The National Congress had decided that Belgium should be a monarchy, but finding a king proved difficult. In the end, Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, who was related to the British royal family and who became engaged to the daughter of the French king, was acceptable to both Britain and France. On July 21, 1831, Leopold ascended the throne, promising to support the liberal constitution, which gave the greater part of the governing power to a parliament elected by property owners. Some days later, the Dutch army invaded Belgium. The Belgians, who had no regular army, were defeated, but the London Conference agreed to intervention by the French army, which forced the Dutch to withdraw. The conference then decided to divide the provinces of Limburg and Luxembourg, assigning part to Belgium and part to the Netherlands. William I refused to accept this settlement. The Belgians, therefore, continued to occupy Dutch Limburg and Luxembourg until William finally relented in 1838. The eastern half of Luxembourg became the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, while the western half became a Belgian province. In 1839 the Dutch government officially recognized Belgium in its borders of 1838.\n\nIn the short run, the revolution had a detrimental effect on the economy. Separation from the north resulted in the sudden loss of the large Dutch market, including the colonies. The Schelde River remained closed until 1839. The Belgian government addressed the crisis by launching a vigorous policy of internal investment. In 1835 it inaugurated a railroad line between Brussels and Malines, the first to operate on the continent. The Antwerp-Cologne line, completed in 1843, opened great prospects for the Belgo-German transit trade. In 1844 a favourable trade agreement between Belgium and the German Zollverein (“Customs Union”) completed this strategy.\n\nPrivate participation in the development program was encouraged. In the case of railroads, for example, the government restricted itself to the construction of main lines as an incentive for private enterprise to provide the secondary network. The modernization of the infrastructure, in turn, created a climate conducive to industrial investment. Belgian banks played a decisive role in the response, in particular the Société Générale, founded in 1822 by King William I, and the Banque de Belgique, founded in 1835 by Belgian liberals. Both companies provided extensive financing for the new mechanized sectors, especially those of the Walloon heavy industry. Converting these enterprises into limited companies, the banks sold shares to the public while holding enough shares in their own or their subsidiaries’ portfolios to retain control. Through this and other measures, including extension of long- and short-term credit to developing companies and the establishment of savings banks to augment resources, the Brussels banks created a new type of financial organization, the industrial banking system, which would soon be imitated by the French, the Germans, and later the English-speaking world.\n\nWhile the Walloon industrial economy expanded rapidly with the infusion of capital, the mechanized textile industry in Flanders remained less dynamic. The Brussels banks exhibited little interest in this industry in the region because it was splintered over many small family enterprises. Moreover, the Ghent cotton industry faced the formidable competition of the British, and Flemish woolen producers had lost the advantage to those of Verviers and northern France. The mechanized linen mills fared better but precipitated, along with their British counterparts, a disastrous decline in the traditional linen industry based on cottage spinning and weaving throughout rural Flanders. The crisis reached a climax with the famine of 1844–46, when poor grain harvests coincided with a potato blight. The deep impoverishment of the Flemish countryside retarded the full modernization of the region until the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nLiberal dominance\n\nAfter 1839, the Unionist coalition that had consolidated the revolution showed signs of falling apart. The progressives, especially, were unhappy with the growing influence of the Roman Catholic Church and with the government, which increasingly enacted the personal policy of the monarch. In 1846 middle-class anticlericals laid the foundation for a national liberal party independent of the Unionist movement, aiming in particular at the curtailment of the church’s growing social position. Later, a Roman Catholic conservative party took shape in opposition. Thus, one of the ideological polarities of modern Belgian politics was born.\n\nThe first Liberal government came to power in 1847 and withstood the revolutionary shock wave that rocked Europe the following year (see Revolutions of 1848). Electoral reforms, hastened by international circumstances, secured the long-standing political dominance of the Liberal urban bourgeoisie.\n\nThe Liberal governments broadened the free-trade policy in order to promote industrialization and commercial expansion and lifted a number of fiscal hindrances on internal trade. The great Liberal reformer Walthère Frère-Orban took special measures to reinforce Belgium’s economic infrastructure: in 1850 he founded a central issuing bank (the National Bank of Belgium), in 1860 a public cooperative bank for municipal finances (the Communal Credit), and five years later a public savings bank (the General Savings Bank). By 1863 the prosperity of the country permitted redemption of the Netherlands’ right to levy charges on ships entering the Schelde estuary, a right enacted in 1839. The port of Antwerp was the great beneficiary, able to compete strongly with Rotterdam (Netherlands) and Hamburg. Favourable trade agreements with France, Britain, and the Netherlands further stimulated the Belgian export and transit trade. The importation of grain was also fully liberalized, without noticeable objection from the agrarian pressure groups, as the prices of grain, rent, and land remained quite high until the 1870s.\n\nOn the political scene, the growing social influence of the church became a matter of passionate public debate. As the controversy mounted, the respective attitudes became more and more radicalized. Among the Liberals, anticlericalism frequently evolved into antireligiosity; among the Catholics, the defense of the church increasingly became a means to acquire political power. The Liberals, controlling the government, managed to curtail the church’s influence in such crucial domains as public charity and public education. The church successively lost its influence in the state secondary schools and in the state universities. When the Liberal government eliminated religious education from public primary schools, the so-called School War erupted. This conflict strengthened the Catholics in their distrust of the state and prompted the development of a state-independent Catholic school network, which met with great success. The School War precipitated a conservative landslide in the elections of 1884, which gave the Catholics a majority in both chambers of the parliament.\n\nPeriod of Catholic government\n\nAside from the education controversy, the biggest factor in the Liberals’ defeat was probably their advocacy of free trade, which was favoured by manufacturers but exposed farmers to ruinous foreign competition. In the early 1880s, when the Belgian market was flooded with American grain, the Catholic Party became the champion of the rural classes by promising to protect agriculture. It also espoused the cause of the nascent Flemish movement that sought to expand opportunities for Flemish-speaking Belgians in a country until then dominated by a French-speaking upper bourgeoisie.\n\nThe last years of the 19th century and the first of the 20th were years of social tension. In 1886 there was a disturbance among workers in Liège, followed by unrest in other industrial areas. The Catholic government of Auguste-Marie-François Beernaert suppressed this movement harshly, but, beginning in 1889, a series of laws were passed regulating workers’ housing, limiting labour by women and children, and providing workmen’s compensation. Because of the system of electoral property qualifications, the working class did not have the right to vote until after the legislature revised the constitution in 1890; in 1893 universal suffrage was adopted for men age 25 and over. Though the effect of this law was weakened by giving a plural vote to electors fulfilling certain conditions of income, age, and education and to heads of families, it resulted in the election of the first Socialist deputies to the legislature. The Equality Law of 1898 made Flemish an official language, on a par with French. Social legislation benefited from the improving economic climate of the 1890s. The Flemish provinces were now fully engaged in the Industrial Revolution, the mechanization process having penetrated into the textile industries of the small towns and villages.\n\nBelgian industry, dominated by powerful financial groups, began to assume worldwide importance and was active in Asia and Latin America, as well as in Europe. In Africa, King Leopold II acquired the Congo Free State as a personal possession in 1885. While employing brutal methods to suppress rebellion, Leopold’s regime forced the Congolese to work in mines and to gather rubber, palm oil, and ivory for export. The completion in 1898 of the Matadi-Léopoldville (now Kinshasa) railroad, which facilitated access to the interior of the Congo River basin, prompted Belgian banks to push for annexation by the Belgian government. Mounting international indignation over Leopold’s harsh rule of the Congo Free State eventually forced the king to hand over his control to the Belgian parliament in 1908.\n\nThe rivalry between France and Germany in the period 1870–1914 constituted a continuous danger to neutral Belgium. King Leopold II and his successor, King Albert I, sought vigorously to strengthen the Belgian armed forces but met resistance from the Belgian Catholic Party governments, which reflected the antimilitaristic sentiments of their grassroots constituency. In 1909 the army recruitment system, which until then had favoured the wealthy by allowing them to hire substitutes for military service, was finally reformed."
