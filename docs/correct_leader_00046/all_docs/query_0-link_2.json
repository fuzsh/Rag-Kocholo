Ockrent3 informs Embassy that Belgian Embassy Paris has been advised Norwegian Ministry at Hague has made personal and confidential démarche to Stikker4 in name of Scandinavian countries asking Stikker to be candidate for contemplated new position in OEEC. The Norwegian démarche was made on ground that it was common opinion Scandinavian countries this position should be given to personality with active Ministerial rank. The Norwegian démarche is known to certain delegations in Paris.\n\nOckrent added he was conveying this information through me to Harriman with consent of Van Zeeland.5\n\nOckrent gave his personal comment on above as follows:\n\n(1) It is not necessary to create special position if contemplated post is to be given to Minister. It would be sufficient for Minister to be President or Vice President.\n\n(2) This démarche seemed to Ockrent to have for its final objective candidacy of Lange6 adding it is evident that Stikker who has already indicated agreement to designation of Spaak7 would not “give effect” to démarche of which he is object.\n\nOckrent said Van Zeeland was transmitting copies of Spaak’s letter of December 308 to Cripps,9 Schuman,10 Stikker and Pella11 in reply to their request that Van Zeeland take up question with Spaak on terms last proposed. Van Zeeland is also sending copies of Spaak’s letter for information to Lange, Castro Fernandez,12 omitting Greek representative owing to latter’s absence from meeting.13\n\n[Here follows the remainder of this telegram further describing the distribution of Spaak’s letter and summarizing Ockrent’s personal views on the Portuguese, Scandinavian, and British opposition to Spaak as a candidate for the proposed new post in the OEEC.]\n\nSent Paris 1; repeated Department 10."
