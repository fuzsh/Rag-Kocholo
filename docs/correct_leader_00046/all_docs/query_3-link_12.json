        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nON MAY 10, 1940, the Germans invaded Belgium. At the end of fifteen days, when defeat appeared certain, the Belgian government fled into exile so that it might carry on the war from France and later from England. Contrary to the pleadings and advice of his ministers, the Belgian king, Leopold III, chose to stay in Belgium and share the fate of his army and his subjects. Three days later, on May 28, Leopold, acting in his capacity as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, capitulated to the enemy and was taken prisoner. He remained a captive until May, 1945. The separation of King and Cabinet on May 25, 1940, marked the beginning of what the Belgians call the royal question, which came to an end on August 1, 1950, when Leopold III abdicated in favor of his son, Prince Baudouin.\n\nEssentially the royal question is the final episode in a long-developing dispute over conflicting interpretations of monarchical power under the Constitution. The Constitution divides power generously between the king and Parliament; yet as Belgian political life evolved from 1830 until 1940, particularly with the growth of political parties and responsible party government, power came to lie increasingly in Parliament. Belgium’s first two monarchs, Leopold I and Leopold II, resisted this evolution and used their full constitutional power. The third king, Albert, who reigned from 1909 until 1934, either because of his personality or because he understood the political changes taking place, acquiesced in the pre-eminence of the legislature. He ruled, however, during a period of relative stability and died before the events of the second half of the 1930’s could test his continued forbearance. He was succeeded by his son, thirty-three-year-old Leopold III. The mid-1930’s were an inauspicious time to come to the throne. Emile Cammaerts wrote that one could rummage in vain through history to find a young constitutional monarch confronted with more pressing and anxious problems from the very first days of his reign. The world depression and the economic policies of France and Germany threatened Belgium with financial ruin. The military strength of Nazi Germany was growing to frightening proportions while Belgium’s historic allies, England and France, did nothing to stop it.\n\nIn Belgium, the parliamentary process was unable to handle the crisis situations. Fascist parties in both Flanders and Wallonia menaced national stability, while divisions within the major parties hampered the normal parliamentary process. Cabinets followed one another with dramatic regularity, and King Leopold was forced to act in order to maintain governmental continuity. As a consequence, he was compelled to make decisions that identified him with specific policies. In 1935, attempting to rescue Belgium from economic collapse, Leopold called Paul Van Zeeland from outside Parliament to head a tripartite national government.1 Van Zeeland, identified with Leopold, was granted extraordinary power in economic affairs. In 1936, after Hitler had marched into the Rhineland, it was Leopold who called for a new Belgian foreign policy. He made his proposal privately at a meeting of the Council of Ministers, but the members of the Cabinet requested that the proposal be made public. The King agreed, and the Government assumed responsibility, but Leopold and neutrality became synonymous. The Belgians thus identified their sovereign personally with the two most important events of the immediate prewar years, a situation which went counter to the then current concept of the position of a constitutional monarch. More significantly, Leopold identified himself with these policies and what he considered to be the “greater good of Belgium.”\n\nWhat took place during the brief fighting war, May 10 to 28, 1940, was the last of the series of events which had started in 1935 and 1936. On May 25, 1940, when his ministers advised Leopold to leave Belgium and accompany them into exile, the King had other ideas regarding what he thought would be best for the nation. He chose to stay behind to share the fate of his troops and his people. This decision and the events that resulted from it during the occupation make up the royal question, a constitutional issue containing this paradox: before the war, the Constitution was vague enough to permit a variety of discrepant interpretations regarding the limits of monarchical power. Convention was eroding the personal prerogatives of the sovereign so that constitutionally he had authority that was no longer recognized by current usage. Yet events compelled Leopold to act with full power contrary to evolving custom, and this brought into the open the discrepancy between what Leopold considered to lie within his constitutional authority and the evolving “rules of the game.” The separation on May 25, 1940, was the final dramatization of this discrepancy.\n\nAfter the war, both the Government which had been in exile and King Leopold sought from the Belgian people vindication of their respective decisions. The ministers believed that they had been right to continue the war from beyond the borders of Belgium; the King believed that he had been right to surrender his troops in order to prevent their annihilation by what appeared to be an invincible enemy. Ratification of these decisions and their consequences carried with it, however, endorsement of a particular interpretation of monarchical authority under the Constitution. Can the king make and execute a decision contrary to the advice of responsible ministers? To answer the question affirmatively would vindicate the King. To answer the question negatively would vindicate the Government and relegate the King and his successors to a position of authority comparable to that of other modern constitutional monarchs. The future relationship between Belgian sovereigns and their ministers—in fact, the future of the constitutional monarchy in Belgium, depended upon the outcome of the dispute.\n\nThe royal question was more than this, however. No such technical, constitutional issue could have captured and sustained the interest of the people; yet the royal question was the most personal and the most violent public issue ever to occur in Belgian history because it touched the weakest element in Belgian society, its unity. There are two ethnic groups within Belgium, the Flemish and the Walloon. During the years of the debate over the royal question, the Flemish (Flemish-speaking) provinces of the kingdom contained 50.19 per cent of the population (4,272,000), while the Walloon (French-speaking) areas had 34.54 per cent (2,912,000). The Brussels metropolitan region (l’agglomération bruxelloise) held the remainder (1,298,000), containing both Flemings and Walloons. But because French is the principal spoken language of Brussels, the region has a predominantly Walloon appearance. In recent years the French-speaking elements of the Brussels area have grown rapidly as Flemish families moving into the “big city” change their daily spoken language to French, thereby adding to the number of French-speaking people in the region.\n\nThese groups differ not only in language but also in culture and outlook; one might even say they differ in religion. The majority of Belgians is considered to be Catholic, but the Flemings are devout, loyal, and conservative, while the Walloons are often lukewarm and anticlerical, influenced strongly by the intellectual currents coming from France. The Flemings and the Walloons exist in the artificial entity called Belgium, a political unit created by international design in 1815, and they react centrifugally in relation to national unity. These efferent forces have shaped the country’s history and have caused serious strain on national cohesion even in times of peace; in times of war the forces react even more violently. The clash is acute owing primarily to the extraordinary attachment of Wallonia to France. The pro-German sympathy of Flanders is much less intense in comparison and often appears to be a reaction against Walloon attraction to France rather than a deep-seated emotion in itself. The Walloon is passionately devoted to France and is often prouder of his adopted French culture than of his Belgian birth. During wartime this devotion was magnified, and the average Walloon thought that anyone who was not pro-French was automatically pro-German.\n\nThe behavior of King Leopold III during the German occupation could not be called pro-French or even pro-Allied. As a result of his policy, Leopold brought down upon himself the animosity and eventually the hatred not only of the Walloons but also of most of the citizens of Brussels. Those who would not venture to say that Leopold had collaborated were convinced that he had believed that the Germans would be victorious and had courted their favor, behavior which Leopold’s enemies considered only slightly less repugnant than collaboration. More dispassionate observers think that King Leopold neither collaborated nor believed in a German victory, but he did not discount the possibility. If the Germans should be victorious Leopold hoped to gain the maximum advantage for Belgium, and his behavior during the occupation was designed to accommodate himself to this eventuality. One can imagine that Leopold reasoned like this: the Belgian government fights with the Allies while the King is a prisoner of the Germans. He will do nothing to aid the aggressor, but he will do nothing to offend him. Irrespective of who is the victor, that victor will have a Belgian friend, or, in the case of Leopold, if not a friend, at least not an avowed enemy. This was the policy of attentisme, “wait and see,” “wait and profit.”\n\nWhether it was called collaboration, attentisme, or what Victor Larock described as “supple accommodation,” the Walloons and the people of Brussels considered Leopold’s behavior to be immoral, and after the war they sought through political action to repudiate him. At this point, the two elements of the royal question, i.e., the constitutional and the political, or what the average Belgian would call moral, merged and found their spokesman in the Socialist party. The Socialists in Belgium have been historically opposed to a strong monarchy. In theory, Socialists are republican, but because the monarchy is considered to be essential to Belgian national existence, the Belgian Socialists have always tolerated the monarchy, while at the same time they have fought for the reduction of monarchical power. Therefore, in the constitutional dispute between the King and the Government, the Socialists supported the Government against the King, and because the Socialists are predominantly Walloon, their political or moral opposition to Leopold III strengthened and became a part of the constitutional dispute.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to show the monarchy as it existed before the royal question (1935–1940); to present the events that made up the question itself (1940–1944); to describe the battle between the King and the Government as each sought to win the approval of the people (1945–1947); to reveal the solution of the royal question (1949–1950); and finally to speculate on the nature of the monarchy after 1950, on the significance of the ten-year affair on the future relationship between Belgian sovereigns and their governments, and on the relevance of the Belgian experience for an understanding of the role of a constitutional monarch in modern, democratic society."
