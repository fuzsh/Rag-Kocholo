        "text": "In 1966 the Portuguese postal service issued a special set of three stamps. The stamps were dedicated to the sixth international congress of the Comité international de défense de la civilisation chrétienne (CIDCC: International Committee for the Defence of Christian Culture) which was held in Lisbon at the end of March. What lay hidden behind the event could not be seen by looking at the stamps with their symbolic Christian images. It was in fact the conference of an international anti-communist propaganda agency with sections in numerous countries of Western Europe, as well as in the United States and Latin America. In terms of its political influence and financial resources, the CIDCC was one of the most significant attempts to amalgamate anti-communist forces in Western Europe in the period after the war. The Comité, which characterized itself as a kind of “Christian Kominform”,1 was different from other similar organizations, not because of the nature of its operations but on account of the religious and moral motivation behind its activities. Its members represented a Christian-conservative worldview and maintained close links with the Catholic Church. Their disapproval of communism was primarily based on their atheist doctrine, and the way in which the Comité behaved toward the institutions and dignitaries of the church.2"
