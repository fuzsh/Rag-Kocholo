Education benefits, such as the Post-9/11 GI Bill®, help Veterans pay for college, graduate school, and training programs. While there are many educational institutions that provide great opportunities as the next step for Veterans after their military service, there are also institutions that use misleading practices to target Veterans and their dependents.\n\nWhat you can do to help VA protect your benefits:\n\nChoose GI Bill® Approved Schools. Use the WEAMS Institution Search Tool to find GI Bill approved schools.\n\nUsing the GI Bill® Comparison Tool. Compare the benefits they’ll receive at different schools. If you have a concern or complaint regarding any school or training center, you may also use the GI Bill® Feedback Tool to make VA aware of an issue.\n\nLearn about the Principles of Excellence Program. This program requires schools that receive federal funding through programs such as the GI Bill® to follow certain guidelines.\n\nFind schools that take part in the Yellow Ribbon Program. This program can help Veterans pay for school costs not covered by the Post-9/11 GI Bill®.\n\nWhat Can You Do If You Suspect Fraud?\n\nTo report suspected fraud, please contact the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) at VAOIG Hotline.\n\nYou may also file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission by visiting reportfraud.ftc.gov.\n\nIf you miss a VA benefits payment, identify a discrepancy in payments, or find suspicious activity with your direct deposit account, contact the VA immediately at 1-800-827-1000.\n\nFOR VETERANS AND QUALIFIED BENEFICIARIES\n\nSubmitting your application online is the preferred method to apply for VA education benefits.\n\nSubmit your online application here https://www.va.gov/education/how-to-apply/.\n\nYou will be asked to provide the applicant’s basic information along with your, or your sponsor’s, military service information and direct deposit banking/routing information.\n\nIt takes approximately 30 days for the VA to review your application and issue a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) letter.\n\nCOE letters are physically mailed to the address you listed on your application.\n\nIf you have trouble with the online application, contact the GI Bill® Help Line:1-888-GIBill1 (1-888-442-4551).\n\nProcess to submit a paper application:\n\nYou may elect to submit a paper application by calling 1-888-442-4551 (Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. ET) and request an application be sent to you.\n\nOnce filled it out, you will be required mail it to the VA regional claims processing office that’s in the same location as your school.\n\nGet a list of regional claims processing offices.\n\nThe GI Bill® can be used in support of OJT (On-the-Job Training) and Apprenticeships, provided the training program is approved by the State Approving Agency. This is industry-based training in which a Veteran or eligible beneficiary earns a regular wage while training for a designated skill or trade and also receives tax-free GI Bill® benefits. OJT’s and Apprenticeships offer a variety of training experiences, and a majority of trades are approvable providing that the establishment can satisfy the approval criteria.\n\nAn OJT program is acceptable in length when it is at least six months, but not more than two years of full-time training per 38 CFR 21.4262(c)(3).\n\nAn APP is a program that ranges from two years to five years, or 2,000 to 10,000 hours in length and requires related training from an institution.\n\nUse the GI Bill® Comparison Tool to compare facilities and which GI Bill® chapter works best for you.\n\nEMPLOYERS\n\nOrganizations that hire veterans have higher retention rates because veterans:\n\npossess proven leadership skills\n\nhave a strong work ethic\n\npossess an ability to work well under pressure\n\nBeing a veteran-ready organization requires employers to meet standards of excellence in recruitment, hiring, and retention of America’s military veterans. To learn more about the U.S. Department of Labor’s HIRE Vets Medallion Award, see the Hire Veterans | Apprenticeship.gov webpage.\n\nIHL (Institute of Higher Learning): Universities, colleges, community colleges, technical and/or business schools, offering instruction at the post-secondary level, which leads to an associate (or higher) degree. To be eligible for approval, the institution must be empowered by the appropriate state education authority (under state law) or accredited by a recognized accrediting agency to grant such degrees. This designation also includes hospitals that offer educational programs at the post-secondary level.\n\nNCD (Non-College Degree programs): This category includes certificate programs, which do not lead to a standard college degree (program or course completion that is acknowledged by certificate or diploma). NCD programs are normally offered at community colleges, cosmetology institutions, business institutions, hospitals, trade, vocational, or career schools.\n\nHigh Schools are also able to apply with the Idaho SAA to have their program approved under Title 38 USC §3675 as an NCD. If your dependent is eligible for Survivors & Dependent Education Assistance (aka – DEA or Chapter 35), those students may qualify to receive up to five extra months of benefits in addition to the 36 months while enrolled an approved high school.\n\nUse the GI Bill® Comparison Tool to compare facilities and which GI Bill® chapter works best for you."
