As a contribution to overcoming global challenges such as climate change, food security, biodiversity conservation and resource scarcity, we develop and design crop systems, integrated in their landscape contexts, that combine food security with sustainability.\n\nThe province of Antwerp is an intermediate policy level between the Flemish and the municipal level. Tasks that require a regional approach are the core business of the province. The provinces is responsible for territorial matters: the sustainable preservation of the environment, economy, tourism, agriculture, heritage, mobility, an spatial planning. The province uses an area-oriented approach to solve problems and exploit opportunities at a regional level together with various stakeholders.\n\nThe National Trust is Europe’s largest heritage & conservation NGO. It perpetually owns over 250,000Ha of land in England, Wales and Northern Ireland of heritage merit. Of this, over 220,000 ha is agricultural land. About 80% of the Trust’s agricultural land is managed by over 1,700 tenant farmers and approximately 40,000Ha is managed in-hand. This means that the National Trust is also one of the largest farmers in the UK.\n\nThe institute has expertise in the area of ecology and evolutionary biology, physical geography and environmental chemistry. Research at IBED aims to unravel how ecosystems function in all their complexity, and how they change due to natural processes and human activities. The Department of Evolutionary and Population Biology (EPB) focusses on population and evolutionary dynamics of species interactions, which are important for the development of successful biological control programs.\n\nAC3A is an interregional organization supporting farmers and agricultural businesses to face current challenges (environment, productivity, policy). Its activities involve setting up local development initiatives, trainings, new processes from research. Core issues are relations among the farming sector and regional authorities, circular economy, territorial anticipation, and social acceptance. AC3A works with research, policy makers, entrepreneurs (including farmers) from various sectors.\n\nBoerennatuur Vlaanderen is a network organization of groups of farmers working agro-environmental measures within an economic farm business. Activities of Boerennatuur Vlaanderen focus on advising farmers on biodiversity, landscape, soil and water management, facilitating collaboration and networking with other actors, development of innovative projects and policy advise. In het board of Boerennatuur Vlaanderen farmer groups, Flemish farmer unions Boerenbond & ABS and agricultural and nature administrations are represented.\n\nThe Soil Association works with thousands of farmers to promote agroecological systems, with an emphasis on FAB. This includes knowledge exchange, support for farmer-led innovation through the Innovative Farmers network, certifying organic farms through our certification business, and developing the market for their produce by promoting sustainable public procurement in thousands of schools and public institutions. We campaign for policy measures to enable farming systems to adopt FAB practices.\n\nINNOVATIESTEUNPUNT (ISP) is the Innovation Support Centre for Agricultural and Rural Development, operating in Flanders, the Dutch speaking northern part of Belgium.

We have 500 staff across 4 sites in the UK. We have a large research portfolio covering key research areas: Biodiversity, Soils & Land Use, Water, Pollution, Atmospheric Chemistry & Effects and Hydro-climate Risks.\n\nThe LTA is a public agricultural school responsible for training in natural sciences and agronomics. In order to become conscious young farmers the LTA educates its Students in autonomous and sustainable agriculture. The school is tightly bound to applied research institutes and professional agricultural enterprises. The LTA enhances knowledge transfer by its in-depth experience gained in the management of pilot farm networks.\n\nBiobest is a global leading company supplying biological pollination and crop protection solutions. Its R&D team consists of 30 researchers, focusing on the development of new products and strategies to make existing products more efficient.
