        "text": "July 11, 2024\n\nI‚Äôm just slapping my head so hard! Why the hell did I wait too long to jump into this MARVELOUS JOURNEY! I‚Äôm telling you my friends: this is the BEST ABBY JIMENEZ BOOK! Absolutely her best work!\n\nI cried and laughed so much and sometimes I did it at the same time! The book brings out so many different you buried inside and help you set them free!\n\nA workaholic, responsible ER doctor‚Äôs path crosses accidentally with a small town mayor: when her car stuck in a ditch: blame it on mischievous raccoon!\n\nAlexis: coming her ultra wealthy family who are world-renowned surgeons, differentiating her path by becoming an ER doctor. At age 37, she suffered enough from emotional, verbal, physical abuse of her ex and her own family.\n\nBy a car accident, she finds herself in a small town Wakanda forever ( okay, I wrote it to check if you are still reading me!) correct name is : Wakan.\n\nDaniel: who saves Alexis from ditch, caring sweetheart and definitely dreamy book boyfriend! Yeap, he‚Äôs younger than her, mayor of town, efficient carpenter, running her grandparents‚Äô B&B. The guy checks all the boxes! I don‚Äôt know how Abby Jimenez creates the best hero characters in her books. Each one of them are exceptional. And luckily this time Alexis is also easy to roof for with her resilience, honesty, genuineness.\n\nAs long as Alexis spends her time in that small town, taking a break for her responsibilities, extra busy schedule, burdens from past, she realizes she can find the happiness at a place with a man she never imagined before.\n\nI have to admit some parts of the book truly hurt me: reading about traumatic experience Alexis has been through was really painful. I got so sad, angry, heartbroken. The angsty part was truly realistic, hard to digest!\n\nBut like a sun coming out of the clouds: the sweet and promising love story of the book warmed my heart!\n\nI love this book so much! I am absolutely giving my five small town, amazingly adorable hero, second chances, emotional stars!\n\nSpecial thanks to NetGalley and Forever ( Grand Central Publishing) for sharing this amazing digital reviewer copy with me in exchange my honest opinions.\n\nmedium.com\n\ninstagram\n\nfacebook\n\ntwitter\n\nMay 18, 2023\n\ndnf @ 59%\n\ni really tried to finish this book, like it had so much potential to be good bc the ratings are so high but i felt it was about to put me back into a slump bc of how boring it was and the fmc was unbearable!! she treats daniel like a child bc he is 28?? um, he literally knows more than you do so pipe down, he‚Äôs not that young. and also, how does she have a medical degree but is so helpless with life - she didn‚Äôt even know what a fkn broom was!! the mmc literally had to show her how to clean and cook like BFFR RN- she didn‚Äôt know what a breaker was, couldn‚Äôt make her own coffee and doesn‚Äôt know how to peel potatoes.. but calls her friends privileged?? YOU GREW UP WEALTHY LITERALLY STFU!! LIKE GIRLLL YOURE ALMOST 38 AND CANT DO DAY TO DAY NECESSITIES AND CANT EVEN STAND UP FOR YOURSELF TO YOUR SHITTY TOXIC PARENTS AND EX BF - alexis, i hope you go broke and i‚Äôm stealing daniel from you bc you don‚Äôt deserve him you ungrateful witch üò≠ but honestly, i feel like i read a completely different book to everyone else lmaoo.\n\n‚Äî ok but mostly, i hated how they got together so early on in the book, like they have sex in chapter 4.. they‚Äôve probably known each other for like an hour at this point and she was going on how she won‚Äôt sleep w him bc she doesn‚Äôt do ONS but then BOOM, she has sex w him like girl bffr pls you‚Äôre draining me üòê the insta-lust/love threw me off, it leaves no room for the characters to grow and it just leaves the story to DRAG ON AND ON!! ppl say there was a lot of tension and chemistry between them, WHERE??? i felt nothing, it was so forced!! there‚Äôs no pining, longing or realisation that they‚Äôre falling for each other. this is why i stick with slow burns!!\n\nand don‚Äôt get me started about the ring light and the dick pic chapter situation.. like who gives a fuck about the angles and lighting ITS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT ANY BETTER!! AND WHY WAS HIS GIRL COUSIN GIVING HIM ADVICE ON HOW TO TAKE A FKN DICK PIC ü´•\n\nalso, i predicted the ending from the start and i had to check; shocker, i was right.\n\nMay 28, 2024\n\nI loveddd this book!!! My first ever Abby Jiminez book and I'm excited I now have a new author to read! I loved that the conflict in this book is so realistic. I had no idea how they were going to resolve it which had me on the edge of my seat and made it that much more heartbreaking.\n\nI also loved all of the small-town characters. One of my favorite things about small-town romances is the found family feel which this book has.\n\nAlso, how could you not falling love with a man who has a pajama-wearing baby goatü•π\n\nApril 28, 2022\n\nthis book is a shot of happiness and fairy tales and joy <3\n\nFebruary 21, 2024\n\nHere I am smiling and giggling... am I enjoying a romance book??\n\nJune 9, 2022\n\ngonna blame the PMS for the high rating. that and the golden retriever boyfriend hero ‚úåüèª\n\nWant to read\n\nFebruary 14, 2022\n\nEditing to add that you can pre-order it here (and please do. There's a paper shortage and pre-orders are strongly recommended)\n\nhttps://www.read-forever.com/titles/a...\n\nAs you know my books, while romcoms, also deal with serious real life issues. Please see below for a list of content warnings.\n\nThe following trigger warnings for Part of Your World may contain spoilers!\n\nCW: Emotional abuse by side character, on page gaslighting by side character and on page physical abuse of a secondary character. Main character is an ER doctor and there are brief mentions of fatal accidents of minors, though we don't see these on the page.\n\nApril 13, 2024\n\nI absolutely loved this story - relatable in so many ways. I laughed, I teared up & I found myself nodding my head to so many familiar things. Love!\n\nApril 19, 2022\n\nNow THIS is the rom-com world I‚Äôve been waiting for! Hallelujah!\n\nAfter a series of cynical (and not very fun) reads, what a pleasure it was to spend time with the wholehearted characters Abby Jimenez brought to life in Part of Your World. Just as I was starting to wonder if I‚Äôd outgrown the romantic comedy genre, her fourth book (but first for me) helped me realize there‚Äôs still some rom and a whole lot of com out there to be enjoyed.\n\nPart of Your World takes the opposites attract trope and gives it a good shake-up by (gasp!) making the woman almost 10 years older than the man. That‚Äôs right folks, she‚Äôs 37 and he‚Äôs 28. She‚Äôs an ER doctor at a prestigious hospital in Minneapolis, and he‚Äôs a carpenter/mayor/B&B manager at a small town called Schitt‚Äôs Creek, whoops, I mean Wakan (the Dakota word for ‚Äúmagic‚Äù). He wears denim, she wears Dolce & Gabbana. She comes from a family that puts the ‚Äúgreed‚Äù in well-pedigreed, and he comes from a self-centered teen mom. Opposites, to be sure.\n\nOne thing they have in common though is obligation, and it‚Äôs those obligations that become the obstacle to their happily ever after. As they wrestle with them (and each other, ifyaknowwhatimsayin), readers are treated to many humorous lines and scenes, a baby goat in pajamas, and a pig named Kevin Bacon.\n\nJimenez has sprinkled a little pixie dust over the story by integrating subtle nods to various fairy tales and Disney movies. Be on the lookout for Cinderella scenes and Little Mermaid moments. Also be prepared for the underlying serious theme of domestic abuse - both emotional and physical. A few of the beauties in this book have dealt with some beasts.\n\nPart of Your World might have been slightly more successful for me if it had been a tad less spicy in the s-e-x department, but that‚Äôs a personal preference and at least none of the C-words I hate so much were used. There are a few f-bombs, but that‚Äôs a-OK in my book. Or should I say world? ;)\n\n4.5 stars\n\nMy heartfelt thanks to the author and Estelle at Forever for the gifted copy to review. Now available!!\n\nBlog: https://www.confettibookshelf.com/\n\nApril 12, 2023\n\n5 stars. Heck, 6 stars. I have found a new all-time favourite!\n\n‚ÄúI wondered distantly if we‚Äôd known each other in a former life and we‚Äôd found each other again. If that was why he felt so familiar‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôm not really going to tell you what this book is about. The blurb will do that for you. But I‚Äôm going to try to tell you how it made me feel, try, since I think that‚Äôs the most interesting part when it comes to book reviews. To review the impact a fictional story left you with. Real-human-feelings type of impact for a fictional world.\n\nI think this book just became the blueprint for what all romances should read like, should feel like. It read like an absolute dream for me and I don‚Äôt know how I am supposed to move on from this story, knowing that this realm exists that I can never be a part of? I don‚Äôt want to move on. üò©\n\n‚ÄúBut grace costs you nothing.‚Äù\n\nFrom the town, to the main characters, to the side characters, I loved every part of it. I was rooting so hard for Alexis and Daniel, it‚Äôs not even funny. They‚Äôre not even real, but they might as well have been.\n\nThat speech that Alexis gave towards the end? I can‚Äôt tell you how proud I felt. I don‚Äôt even know whether she recognised her worth by the end, but I sure as fuck did. The woman is incredible! ü•π\n\nAnd Daniel? Don‚Äôt get me fuckin‚Äô started. üò≠ Abby Jimenez had no right to create this type of hero. None at all. Cinnamon roll to the core. He was someone that was just so good and honourable. Real life men, real life people could never. They‚Äôd fail in comparison to him.\n\nThese two characters who are seemingly worlds apart, fit and made sense like you wouldn‚Äôt believe and I loved following them on their individual journey as well as the one they had together.\n\nI‚Äôm just blown away, tbh. I‚Äôm finding words difficult, simply because it wouldn‚Äôt do this book justice.\n\nSo, to end it, my favourite aspect to this book (alongside everything else I‚Äôve already mentioned) boils down to this: I feel like it emphasised that found families can sometimes trump the ones you are born into.\n\n*Trigger warnings for emotional/narcissistic abuse from an ex and her parents.\n\nThere‚Äôs also a side character who‚Äôs experiencing domestic abuse*\n\nFebruary 28, 2024\n\n4.5 Stars ‚òÜ\n\n\"Grace costs you nothing.\"\n\nThis did start off as insta-love, but don't let that deter you because I'm not a fan of it and ended up enjoying this. The story progresses into more, even touching on some heavy real-life topics. This is my first Abby Jimenez book, and she portrayed emotional and mental abuse well, showing the realness of dealing with it.\n\nPart of Your World is the first book in the POYW series. It is a small town, age gap(she's older 37 and he's 28), opposites attract romance with tension, witty banter, laugh out loud moments and scenes of abuse that had me feeling angry and shedding tears.\n\nAlexis was on her way home late one night from an out of town funeral when she swereved to miss a raccoon and put her car in a ditch. While she was waiting for the towns tow truck, Daniel stopped to help pull her out. She goes to the only open place in Wakan the towns bar and runs into him there. Deciding to help him win a bet with his friends as a way to thank him.\n\nDaniel Grant is thoughtful, generous, and selfless, and I swear he is the sweetest. This man has the biggest heart and will do anything to help those who need it. He had me swooning for him so hard with all the gestures that he did for Alexis. He has his struggles, though, and it mad me so mad to watch him go through them. We see him suffer with financial struggles, but he tries not to show that he is struggling to save one of the things that means the most to him. Guys, he takes care of a baby goat that wears pajamas for a friend, sigh.\n\n‚ÄúI like to read. It‚Äôs the only way I get to live somewhere that isn‚Äôt Wakan. I read three, four books a week. A lot of audiobooks. That way I can work and read at the same time.‚Äù\n\nAlexis Montgomery is smart, sophisticated, and grew up being privileged. She went through both mental and emotional abuse with her ex and didn't realize that she deserved better until she met Daniel. My favorite part of Alexis was watching her grow and realize that her own family had also been abusive while growing up. Always doing the things that were expected of her by her parents and doing what truly made her happy but to please them. She started to see it all so clear once she was treated the way that she deserves by Daniel. My heart broke for her so many times, but in the end, she broke away from it and did the things that fit her life for her and not for anyone else.\n\n\"Nobody can save you until you‚Äôre ready to save yourself.‚Äù\n\nDaniel and Alexis are the complete oppostie of each other. She is an er doctor at a prestigious hospital, and he is the mayor of the town who runs a B&B and is a carpenter. When they are together, though, the sparks fly. They fit so well together and really do compliment each other in ways that no one has before. Their love for each other and the trials that they went through together felt so real.\n\n‚ÄúHave you ever seen anything so perfectly beautiful?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou.‚Äù\n\nI fell in love with the found family in this. It's the way the people of Wakan all look out for one another and are a big family. Some of my favorites were Doug and Brian as they brought humor with them that had me laughing out loud so much. I adored Liz and felt so bad for everything that she was enduring. Bri was the only friend that Alexis could count on, and that was true to her.\n\nThis took me through so many emotions that I wasn't expecting. The ending was a bit predictable, but I still loved it and was happy with the outcome. The only question I'm asking myself is, \"What took me so long to read this?\" I'm excited to read the next book and see Bri get her happy ending.\n\nFavorite quotes and moments\n\n\"Sometimes what you have to give is enough. Even if it‚Äôs a rock instead of a diamond.‚Äù\n\n\"Love follows you. It goes where you go. It doesn‚Äôt know about social divides or distance or common sense. It doesn‚Äôt even stop when the person you love dies. It does what it wants.\"\n\n\"There‚Äôs something more final than forever. It‚Äôs never. Never is infinite.\"\n\n\"Sometimes family isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôre born into. Sometimes family is found.\"\n\n~~~~~~\n\nPre-review: I've seen so many good things about this! Plus, I'm hoping for some cute and cozy vibes ü•∞\n\nMay 4, 2024\n\nThis was fine. It was definitely cheesier than Yours Truly. I mostly just read it because I wanted to know the backstory of all the characters before I read Just For The Summer.\n\nApril 30, 2022\n\nthe crazy high average rating is definitely what drew me to this book. my experiences with AJs novels have been so-so, but a book that currently has a 4.62 rating has to be better than just mediocre, right?\n\nand luckily this is!\n\nthe relationship between alexis and daniel is super sweet. yes, it starts off with a massive case of insta-lust, but i think the story progresses in a really nice way that shows how genuine feelings develop between the two of them. it feels real. dont get me wrong, the story is super predictable, but its honest, so i liked that.\n\nmy only complaint would be the balance between the fun, cute, and lightheartedness of a rom-com and the serious, heavy topics of real life. i think romance books incorporating more of the serious topics of relationships is a good thing, but sometimes i pick up a romance to escape real life, and i thought this story had a bit too much seriousness and prevented that escapism at times.\n\nbut honestly, it wasnt a deal breaker. i had fun and thought this was an improvement from my previous experiences with AJs books!\n\n‚Ü† 3.5 stars\n\nMay 6, 2022\n\n‚ÄúGrace costs you nothing.‚Äù\n\nHey, so this was definitely giving a bit of ‚Äúinsta love,‚Äù but it‚Äôs okay because there was so much more to this book than just the romance.\n\nAlexis Montgomery comes from a long line of world-renowned surgeons. She and her twin brother are expected to carry on this legacy, except maybe they don‚Äôt want to do it exactly in the way their family members did. As she was headed somewhere, because I really don‚Äôt remember where she was going, her car ended up having a problem. Luckily for her, Daniel shows up and helps her. Daniel comes from a local town, where he rents out a family house to visitors. They probably didn‚Äôt expect to see each other again, but as fate would have it, they see each other again, and ‚Äúthings‚Äù happen. How does their relationship develop from there?\n\nI thought this one was really amazing. I wholeheartedly could not put it down and finished it on the same day I started. Let‚Äôs start with the romance. Alexis and Daniel were really really really cute. Like I said from the beginning, it was definitely giving insta love but they still developed their relationship over the course of the book. Alexis and Daniel live different lives in regards to money, so it was really nice to see how they learned from each other through tasks and conversations.\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let them decide the life you‚Äôre going to live.‚Äù\n\nA huge part of this book was abuse, both physical and emotional. Jimenez does a great job of highlighting how emotional abuse is just as powerful as physical abuse. I want to especially give a high five for revealing that these kinds of abuse can be among family members. My heart hurt for Alexis so much throughout the book. Except for her twin brother, best friend, and Daniel, I literally hated everyone she was surrounded with. How could someone survive with that much toxic energy? It was very realistic to portray this struggle that she had and how she slowly overcame them one at a time. How does she do this?\n\nOf course, Daniel also has his own individual struggles, not abuse, but more on the financial side. I was scared that we weren‚Äôt going to see any struggles on Daniel‚Äôs side, but we did, even though it felt at times that Alexis' problems were shown more. Daniel is pretty much another illustration of fictional men being amazing. I could smell husband material from the first lines about him. He‚Äôs 10 years younger than Alexis, and she made this a pretty big deal. I thought we are in a time when age isn‚Äôt a huge deal, but apparently, not everyone thinks this way.\n\nOverall, there were some funny lines here and there, and the pacing was great. It wasn‚Äôt really smutty though, which I was kinda surprised by. I‚Äôm also surprised that I‚Äôm surprised since it‚Äôs not like the rest of her books were that smutty. I believe Jimenez has written four books so far, all of which I‚Äôve read. Her characters have so much chemistry. It is something she has definitely mastered. I personally think this is her best one yet!!\n\nApril 1, 2024\n\n‚Äî 4.5 stars ‚òÖ\n\n‚ÄúSometimes family isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôre born into. Sometimes family is found.‚Äù\n\nI was truly captivated by this Part of Your World from very first chapter. Abby Jimenez, what did you put in this book? This is my first book by AJ and I am obsessed with her writing and the characters. I am not a fan of insta-love but Abby has a true talent of writing insta-love stories because it was just so perfectly written. This book is a mixture of hilarious, tender and heart-warming moments. There were moments where I was sobbing but then the next moment I was giggling and smiling because Alexis and Daniel were so precious. This is also the best reverse age-gap book ever written.\n\nThis book is like the biggest warm hug‚Äî like those comfort cardigans you love to wear on your good and bad days. AJ beautifully blended the heavy issues and emotional moments with refreshing and swoon-worthy romance. Abby tackled heavy subjects like emotional and mental abuse, domestic abuse and manipulation in a realistic way and showed us how people deal with their situations differently.\n\n‚ÄúLove follows you. It goes where you go. It doesn‚Äôt know about social divides or distance or common sense. It doesn‚Äôt even stop when the person you love dies. It does what it wants.‚Äù\n\nThe small town moments and the found family trope was so precious in this book. I loved the way they all were there for each other and how they all were just a big found family. Daniel's friendship with his Doug and Brian and how Alexis was welcomed and loved by his people. Everything was so sweet and tender. There were a lot of nuanced things in this book like the concept of Wakan being a magical town and how it will keep what it wants was kinda cute, it added the modern fairy-tale vibes to Daniel and Alexis's story.\n\n‚û∏ Daniel Grant\n\nThe man of my dreams. He's just so perfect that no words will ever be enough to describe him and how much I love him. He's so down to earth, appreciates the privileges in his life, has the biggest heart ever, always helping his people, and there is nothing complex about him at all. You read about him and you'll see exactly what he shows you and says to you. He's good, kind, thoughtful, charming, selfless, knows how to love and take care of a woman without even asking for anything in return. I mean he spent two hours down by a river to find a perfect heart shaped rock for his girl, he adopted a war trained dog, he takes care of a baby goat in pyjamas. Aside from this, he also has his own struggles ‚Äî financially and he tried his best to save his legacy but he also tried not to show his struggles to anyone because he's the one Wakan people depends on. He never pressured Alexis for anything just only ever wanted her time and I did not liked how he was treated by her in this book. Also, did I tell you HE READS AND COOKS!\n\n‚ÄúEven though I didn‚Äôt fit into her life, she fit into mine.‚Äù\n\n‚û∏ Alexis Montgomery\n\nThe woman who belonged to a complete different world than Daniel's and who's rejected the idea of dating until she met the one. She's intelligent, kind-hearted, has lived a very luxurious and extravagant life. My heart broke for her so many times and all the emotional and mental abuse she went through for years by the people who loved her only to criticise her for her own choices. I liked her character development and how she came out of her toxic relationships with her father and her ex and how it made her realise that she was never the problem. Daniel helped her see love and life from a different and clear perspective which helped her understand her true potential and how there's so much to life than just carrying on a 125 years old legacy. Alexis is great and I love her but what I didn't liked about her was how she treated Daniel. There were so many things she could've done differently and that would've made things easy for their already complicated relationship.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs amazing how someone can touch you, even if you only know them for a moment in time. How they can change you, alter you indelibly.‚Äù\n\n‚ï∞‚îà‚û§ Daniel and Alexis\n\nDo I mind that they fell for each other way too soon? Absolutely not because when you know you know. They did started of as friends with benefits but I loved the way they slowly started to get to know each other. They are perfect for each other but their different worlds and lifestyles are not perfect for their reunion. Daniel is the best in their relationship who was ready to give up his town, his legacy, his family just to make a future with her in her city because she means more to him than his 125 years legacy in Wakan. He's truly a gem. Daniel gave Alexis everything she never properly had in her life. She needed love, care and someone who can make her his first priority, someone who won't emotionally abuse her, someone who can accept her as she is and Daniel is that person to her.\n\n‚ÄúHow do you do that?‚Äù she breathed.\n\n‚ÄúDo what?‚Äù I asked, my voice husky.\n\n‚ÄúKnow how to touch me.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI pay attention to you,‚Äù I said, kissing her collarbone gently. ‚ÄúHow you feel matters to me.‚Äù\n\nI loved the way he made her feel normal, gave her the normal life she never had, told her all the little and handy things she thought she could never learn, how he always gave her the time and space and his love. He accepted her even without knowing about her extravagant lifestyle and her 125 years legacy. I understand Alexis choice and why she felt she could only protect Daniel by not including him in her luxurious and sophisticated life and she did her best but she also betrayed him so many times by not trying to include him in her life because he only ever wanted her. Daniel deserves so much better and someone who is proud of who he is and I think Alexis could've done better by his side.\n\n‚ÄúHave you ever seen anything so perfectly beautiful?‚Äù I breathed. I turned to Daniel. But he wasn‚Äôt watching the petals anymore. He was looking at me.\n\n‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶‚Äù he said quietly, holding my eyes. ‚ÄúYou.‚Äù\n\nThe ending was dreamy and no I am not kidding. The third-act breakup was not needed but it was reasonable and it broke my heart because Daniel did not deserved to be treated like someone who's not good enough for the world Montgomery's lives in. He was ready to give up his everything for Alexis and still it would never be enough for her father. Alexis's father is the worst and he should be in jail for the way he emotionally abused his kids and his wife for years. What I liked was how Alexis accepted Daniel in her life and how she didn't give a shit about anyone's reaction and just waited for Daniel to come and walk in her life with his head held high. The epilogue was the cutest ever!\n\nI highly and wholeheartedly recommend this book to every hopelessly romantic out there üíå\n\n‚ÄúKiss me, Daniel Grant.‚Äù\n\nHe looked scandalized. ‚ÄúRight here? In front of everyone?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúRight here. In front of everyone.‚Äù\n\nApril 30, 2024\n\n‚äπ÷¥÷∂÷∏ ìÇÉ‚ãÜ ‚àû / 5 ‚ãÜìÇÉ÷¥÷∂÷∏ ‚äπ\n\nüíê‚ÄúLove follows you. It goes where you go.

She wanted an out, but she felt that she couldn‚Äôt disappoint her family more than they already were. She needed to feel accepted by her family, friends, coworkers, and everyone in general. Maybe she didn't know how to do basic stuff like cooking, cleaning, etc., but we must keep in mind that she was literally conditioned by her parents since she was a child to fulfill the expectations of her family and to have everything handed on a silver platter. But she was raised like that. That was her world- she didn‚Äôt know anything better. She was taught that all she had to do was to study, get a job with a high position in the medical field, surround herself with influential people, and marry someone \"worthy\" whom her parents accepted. She didn‚Äôt have the mindset to see something else outside this world until she ended her abusive relationship, went to therapy, started to set boundaries for her parents and order her priorities, and when she met Daniel. Then, she started her journey of self-discovery,\n\nself-awareness, and personal growth. I was so proud of her and her character development.\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π‚ÄúDaniel empowered me, instead of stripping me.

He has: the most charming and selfless personality, tattoos, dimples, and the cutest dog and a baby goat (it‚Äôs his friend‚Äôs, but he helps him a lot taking care of it).\n\nü§ç‚ÄúNothing could convince me this woman wasn't made for me to love. I think my soul recognized hers the second I laid eyes on her. Our bodies knew it the very first night.\n\nThe power she had over me terrified me. But it also gave me clarity.\n\nThere is a peace in knowing the one thing you can't live without. It simplifies all things. There was her, and then there was everything and everyone else. And only she really mattered.‚Äùü§ç\n\nSince I first read about this man, he captivated me. There‚Äôs just something about him that always had me smiling, melting, and kicking my feet. Was it his charisma or how he took care of Alexis? Was it how humble he was or how openly he was to love Alexis despite their differences and the odds of not being able to fit in each other‚Äôs life? He is the sweetest person ever. He made Alexis feel safe, beautiful, powerful, heard, seen, helpful, worthy, and happy. Daniel helped her heal from her past relationship which was mentally abusive. He helped her raise her self-esteem, and always encouraged and supported her. Since the beginning, all he wanted was to worship her and make her feel comfortable. Daniel made her his priority and was willing to give up everything just to be with her. Andd he didn‚Äôt doubt that not even once.\n\nüõêüò≠‚ÄúI'd give up my life here to be where she was if she'd have me. I'd give up my house and this town and all the people in it. If she was at the hospital eighty hours a week, I could be there when she left and be there when she came home. Make her breakfast, take her lunch, take her dinner. I could pick up the slack. She wouldn't have to do anything, it could be all me this time -I'd go to her.

She was always there for Alexis when she needed her the most, and she helped keep her grounded. She was so helpful for Alexis to recognize her true feelings and take those brave steps to organize her priorities and follow her dreams, not her parents.

They had me laughing so hard and melting, and they were the sweetest and the most supportive people ever.\n\n‚ù• My thoughts üí≠ Àñ‚Å∫. ‡º∂ ‚ãÜÀô‚äπ\n\n‚û¥ every single chapter was magicalü¶ã‚ú® this book hooked me from the very beginning which normally is very hard for me to achieve. Part of Your World is my new favorite romance booküíú I felt a rollercoaster of emotions and enjoyed every single word of this book.\n\n‚û¥ I hated so much Alexis' parents. I could say so many things about them, but I would never end. Her father was a narcissist who only cared about prestige and was mentally abusive to her. Her mother never stood up for Alexis or her twin. They mistreated her and didn‚Äôt care for her well-being or happiness. She deserved so much better, but I‚Äôm so glad she found her own family in Wakan, Daniel, Bri, and her twin.\n\n‚û¥ the third act breakup broke MY HEART. I felt like I was the one who was drowning instead of them. THAT is how empathetic I was toward this book.\n\n‚û¥ when Daniel thought Alexis was embarrassed of him? SO HEARTBREAKINGüíî he just wanted to be supportive, love her, and just be there for her. He was willing to give up EVERYTHING- his house, work, town, and follow her to another city just to be with her. Thissss manüò≠üíó\n\n‚û¥ this was an insta love, and you know what? I didn‚Äôt mind that one bit because I truly felt all the chemistry since the beginning. They were so opposites, and they lived in very different worlds. Even though, Alexis and Daniel had a beautiful, comfortable, and palpable connection since the moment they met and as they got to know each other and formed a relationship. They had insecurities, fears, wounds, and all the odds were against them. But they found a way to mix their worlds and be together despite the obstacles. They helped each other bring out the best of them and be the best versions of themselves. They became each other's priority and were willing to give up everything to be together. They just wanted to live their lives doing what they wanted and loving each other. And they achieved it. No matter how many differences they had, that didn't stop them from following their hearts and fighting against the odds to be together. I'm the happiest with their happy endingüíñ\n\n‚ù• Other quotes just because I love them ‚ú®\n\nI didn't like that others had to take care of me. I wanted to know how to take care of myself. I wanted to pull my weight and learn to be self-reliant so that when I did depend on someone, it was by choice and not necessity. And it was Daniel who was teaching me how.\n\n‚ÄúI see you. I would save you if you were drowning.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI pay attention to you. How you feel matters to me.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGrace costs you nothing.‚Äù\n\nHe was in a black tux. One hand on the railing, and every woman in the room looking at him- but he was looking at me.\n\n‚ÄúHave you ever seen anything so perfectly beautiful?‚Äù I breathed.\n\nI turned to Daniel. But he wasn‚Äôt watching the petals anymore. He was looking at me. ‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶‚Äù he said quietly, holding my eyes. ‚ÄúYou.‚Äù\n\nHe pulled out something and put it in my palm. It was a rock‚Ä¶\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs shaped like a heart,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTook me two hours to find it.‚Äù\n\nIt wasn't flashy. It cost him nothing but his time- but that was the gift. Daniel didn't have time. That was his most valuable commodity right now, and he'd given it to find me this?\n\nShe said she didn't see a future with us. That our lives didn't fit. I knew there were things I could never give her. At best, I had about as much to offer as my damn dog, companionship, and entertainment‚Ä¶But I could love her better than anyone ever could for the rest of her life. That, I knew. And if there was even a fraction of a chance that might be enough, I was going to take it.\n\nAnyways, I will forever recommend this book to absolutely everyone.

This book...GAH. I laughed, I cried, I swooned. I don't know how Abby Jimenez does it, but I am awed by her talent. Full review to come closer to release date.\n\nApril 19, 2022\n\nIt‚Äôs no secret that Abby Jimenez writes some of my favorite Romance books‚Ä¶.\n\nAlthough I only read a few a year, you can BET that one of them will always be whatever Abby has published! I am always so excited when I see that she has a new book available to request.\n\nSure, this genre has a formula that leads to happily ever after-but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs easy to write.\n\nIn romance you MUST like the characters, you MUST enjoy their dialogue, and you MUST feel the chemistry!! üî•\n\nIn addition, you absolutely MUST feel the angst! Theirs and yours-as you become worried that one of the leads will let the other get away, causing you to scream at that character to ‚Äúgo get your person‚Äù!\n\nNOW!!\n\nAll the boxes are checked here!\n\nAnd, once again, Abby Jimenez adds an ‚Äúextra layer‚Äù to her stories by weaving another important topic into a sub-plot-this time, ‚Äúdomestic violence-both verbal and physical abuse‚Äú, providing resources after the epilogue.\n\nThis story introduces us Alexis Montgomery, who has been tapped to carry on her family legacy of world-renowned surgeons. (Think Meredith Grey of Grey‚Äôs Anatomy) She and her brother, Derek, have been groomed since childhood to be the next generation to lead their prestigious hospital into the next century and then Derek bails out.\n\nNot their first choice, but nonetheless, now their only choice, their parents want Alexis to marry the right man-Neil-the head of surgery-have the right friends-the horrible Jessica and Gabby, and fulfill her destiny-Despite the fact that she has she realized that she doesn‚Äôt want any of these things.\n\nLate one night, she is driving home from an out of town funeral, and she has to swerve to avoid hitting a raccoon-ending up in a ditch. Daniel Grant, a very tattooed, blue color, (and younger) man, offers to tow her out, and afterward she runs into him again at a nearby bar -which is the only place in town that is open this late with available food and rest rooms.\n\nShe decides to help him win a bet against his friends as a way to ‚Äúthank him‚Äù for his assistance.\n\nDespite the fact that their lives are as different as night and day, their sizzling chemistry is undeniable, and will make Alexis question if money does buy happiness and if if she has the courage to live life on her own terms.\n\nAs she tries to reconcile how she feels, we hear from both Alexis and Daniel, in alternating chapters, and I enjoyed hearing from them both equally.\n\nThankfully, Alexis has one true friend in her corner, Bri, and we should ALL have a friend like her-a friend who will tell you what you NEED to hear, and CHEER YOU ON, as you go for what will make you happy!\n\nIf you have enjoyed this author‚Äôs past work-you will enjoy this book too!\n\nAVAILABLE NOW!!\n\nOne last thing‚ÄîI was excited to learn that in 2023, it will be Bri‚Äôs turn in the spotlight and it will be her chance to find happiness! ‚ù§Ô∏è My calendar is already marked!!\n\nThank You to Forever for my gifted copy! It was my pleasure to offer a candid review!\n\nApril 21, 2023\n\nI‚Äôll not go into the plot, and will keep this review short and sweet. It‚Äôs no secret I‚Äôm a curmudgeon (lol) and my eyes tend to roll a lot.\n\nBut every now and then I need a rom-com (as long as it‚Äôs heavy on the com).\n\nDid I have to set aside believability? Of course. Did I care? Of course not.\n\nThis was a delightful rom-com with compelling characters and a conclusion that wasn‚Äôt entirely predictable, but yet, perfect. I loved these characters. And, there‚Äôs the adorable dog!\n\nAfter more than a few disappointing reads, this was a delight start to finish. Funny and sweet, I highly recommended for fans of the genre.\n\nYet, there is substance, but the author dealt with it with sensitivity. It‚Äôs nice to be reminded of the best of humanity.\n\nThe narrators, Julia Whelan, and Zacchary Webber were perfect for their roles.\n\nJune 3, 2022\n\nPart of Your World is out of this world!üòçüí•‚ÄºÔ∏è\n\nIt's easily my favorite rom-com so far this year. I wish I had more stars to give!\n\nIn the middle of nowhere between Cedar Rapids and Minneapolis, Alexis avoids a raccoon on the road and ends up in a ditch. Luckily, a handsome Daniel drove by and helps tow her Mercedes out.\n\nThis isn't instant love, but close. Their encounter on the road sets off an unlikely romance between two people who are polar opposites, but their chemistry is off the charts! I soo love them together.\n\nDaniel Grant is a carpenter, and mayor, and runs a B & B in the tiny town of Wakan, MN.\n\nDr. Alexis Montgomery is an ER doctor from the big city.\n\nI love their flirty connection, witty banter, and laugh-out-loud humor. I love the animals, Daniel's circle of friends, and dialogues with some risqu√©. ü§≠There's a scene that I listened to THREE times because it was immensely hilarious. On a slightly serious part, there's an underlying emotional abuse message in the story.\n\nPart of Your World hits all the right notes and gives me huge satisfaction~adding to my favorite shelf (the first rom-com!).

I don‚Äôt usually love a romance, but I just loved this book :) 10/10!\n\nJune 6, 2022\n\n5 stars\n\nAbby Jimenez never disappoints. I‚Äôve read every book she‚Äôs written and I‚Äôve loved them all. Part of Your World is one of her best. I loved so much about this story and these characters. I mean, Daniel! Could she have written a more perfect hero? I think not.\n\nAlexis is not having a good day when she swerves to miss an animal and ends up in a ditch. Two hours away from home. She‚Äôs waiting for a tow when a young guy in a truck pulls up to assist her. His name is Daniel and he‚Äôs about ten years younger than her. He‚Äôs kind, refreshing, and all kinds of wonderful. Once they spend a night together, they can‚Äôt stay away from each other.\n\nTalk about totally different worlds though. The life Alexis leads as a thirty seven year old successful ER physician compared to Daniel‚Äôs small town life of running his family‚Äôs business and doing some carpenter/mayor work on the side couldn‚Äôt be less alike but that doesn‚Äôt seem to matter. These two are compatible in all the ways that count and Alexis has never been treated so well in her entire life.\n\nOf course I loved the romance of this story. It was so lovely and the banter was great. I laughed more than once. There is also some emotion, a bit of angst, and it touches on some sensitive subject matter Abuse- physical and mental/emotional. We‚Äôve already established that Daniel was perfect and Alexis was great as well- her growth was a joy to watch. I loved so many of the side characters and I especially loved the small town Daniel was from. It felt truly magical. Almost like it was it‚Äôs own character. It had a great ‚Äòfound family‚Äô aspect as well.\n\nBecause sometimes family isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôre born into. Sometimes family is found.\n\nPart of Your World gave me that same THIS IS GOING TO BE A FAVORITE feel as ‚ÄòThe Friend-Zone‚Äù did and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs going to be on my favorites list in 2022. This one is a must read romance I highly recommend![\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>\n\nJanuary 7, 2024\n\nI started this at about 8:18pm. I finished at 1:40am. Can‚Äôt tell you the last time I read a book in one sitting\n\nMay 13, 2024\n\n4.5 ‚≠êÔ∏è My first Abby Jimenez book, and tbh I thought I wasn‚Äôt going to like bc I‚Äôm not usually into romance with little to no spice, but I ate my words for fast with this one. I don‚Äôt even know what it was about this book that drew me in from page one, the writing, the characters, literally everything was PERFECT, page one. LOOOOOVED IT SO SO MUCH AND CANNOT WAIT TO START YOURS TRULY\n\nFebruary 10, 2024\n\nI FOUND MY FIRST 5 STAR BOOK OF 2024! This was such an emotional roller coaster. CW: emotional/mental abuse by partner and parents, parental abandonment, domestic violence\n\nPart of Your World is not the book I was expecting. To be honest, I didn't think I was going to like it solely because of Alexis; however, as I worked through the novel more, I realized how much I connected to not only the story, but also the characters. While this is a journey of their romance, I definitely think it does a great job of handling the complications related to toxic partners as well as toxic parents.\n\nWhat Worked: EVERYTHING! It's rare for me to think that all elements of book work together to create the perfect story, but Abby Jimenez did a great job not only developing the romance between Alexis and Daniel, but also these conversations related to the importance of found family. I will admit that Alexis isn't easy to deal with in the beginning. She's hesitant about starting a new relationship because of her separation from her current partner, but there were moments where she's not that great towards Daniel. It took a while for me to understand her as a character, but I appreciated the manner in Jimenez takes her time developing her and allowing her story to come full circle. Her behavior is a direct result of the emotional abuse she experiences at the hands of her parents. It forces her to make decisions with them in mind at all times even though she's an adult. It's a toxic cycle that she's been forced to accept and normalize, and it greatly impacts how she views the relationship between herself and Daniel. On the other hand, Daniel is the perfect character, a cinnamon roll that has a heart of gold. Raised by his grandparents and his small-town community, Daniel understands the importance of found family and assists Alexis in understanding how to make decisions for her own happiness and not that of others. There are brief discussions related to domestic violence and its impact on a side character. While I've seen some reviews that feel as though this element was simply thrown into the story, I think it also helps Alexis come to terms with the abuse that she faces at the hands of her own ex and parents. I thought the medical back drop of this was great and really helped support the idea that money and prestige doesn't always equate to complete happiness. This was well written and paced. I ADORED the side characters from Daniel's hometown as well as Alexis' best friend. They help these two continue to find each other and the love their share time after time.\n\nOverall, this was a wonderful, amazing, and emotional read. I haven't cried this much reading a book in a while. I don't know if any of Jimenez's other works will have the same impact, but I'm excited to explore more of her backlist.\n\nApril 9, 2024\n\n4.25 ‚≠êÔ∏è i didn‚Äôt expect to love this as much as I did??? it was so much deeper than I thought it would be but yet so fun & cute & fluffy. it gave me fairy tale vibes!!!! I chuckled & I teared up.. all the emotions were felt by me. Alexis was so strong and amazing. now listen‚Ä¶ she annoyed me sometimes but I still loved her ü§≠ AND DANIEL, mr. mf perfect wow??\n\nAll of the side characters were also incredible & added so much to this book. Doug & Liz & Bryan!!! loved them so much. But the real star for me was ‚ú®Bree‚ú® I need a book for her immediately, I require it.\n\n‚Äúsometimes family isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôre born into, sometimes family is found. and I found mine in him.‚Äù"
