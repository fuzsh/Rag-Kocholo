        "text": "Wow, what an experience\n\nThis series is magnanimous, with a scope I have never encountered before. I mean, this series truly is one of the most brilliant pieces of sci-fi I have ever had the pleasure of reading. I have a handful of favorites and this series just made it onto that shelf. I most definitely will read the entire series again, and until I do, I am sure I will never forget this experience and it will live with me for forever-more. I have thoroughly enjoyed stories that allow the audience to co-create the world along with the author (think, the Never Ending Story), and this book is the godfather and granddaddy of that style. I intend to think deeply upon the narrative, and I look forward to co-creating within the gaps so that I could circle back and find more deeper and meaningful experiences on the second run through.\n\nBeautiful coda to a master piece\n\nThe book of the new sun marked my introduction to the writing of Gene Wolfe whose work I have become obsessed with since. I'm openly admitting to my bias here. Though I felt this one differed from the books of the tetralogy in overall tone and pacing, there are some very interesting loose ends tied up in interesting ways I had not imagined. So much so that I will need to read this one a second time to truly appreciate. Davis' narration is beyond great as always. For hardcore Wolfe fans I'd say it's a must read. For fans of the book of the new sun left wanting more, I recommend this but not without saying to expect something a bit different.\n\nTime shifting hassle for a new sun\n\nThe Urth of the New Sun is Gene Wolfe's fifth book in The Book of New Sun series. Severian has risen to be the Autarch but must travel to another planet to earn a new sun. During the voyage people try to kill him. When he reaches Yesod he must undergo a test where he meets dead people. His arrival back on Urth has now sent him back in time to the first Autarch who also tries to kill him, but travels to the future where his wife is now playing Autarch. A flood wipes out everything and he then travels way into the past and is worshiped a god but is killed when he tries to leave. He wakes to learn that he was killed long ago and has been a wandering ghost. He again travels far into the future well after the flood and the arrival of the new sun and is shown a resting place with other gods.\n\nWolfe plays fat and loose with time throughout. At the same time, everyone seems to want Severian dead, but for no reason. In addition, there is never any clear explanation for the trials he must endure to get a new sun.\n\nThe narration is well done with good character distinction and smooth pacing."
