        "text": "Some benefits only require you to show a valid Pass to receive the discount. Others can only be accessed by providing your Pass cover number.\n\nYou’ll find specific instructions for each benefit in the Pass Benefits Portal.\n\nIn the unfortunate scenario that your device gets lost, damaged, or broken with your Pass on it, you can opt to move your Pass to another device.\n\nOpen the app on your new device and go to My Pass to add your Pass using your last name and Pass number from the order confirmation email. When asked, tap 'Move Pass' and follow the steps to have your Pass moved to the new device.\n\nRemember, if you don’t have a device available to add your Pass to, you won’t be able to travel since you won’t be able to show your ticket. You run the risk of being fined or asked to leave the train. Unfortunately, we can’t reimburse any fines you may incur or tickets you had to purchase.\n\nYour mobile Pass is periodically checked against our system to ensure its validity and prevent fraud, which means that you need to be online at least once every 3 days.\n\nWe’ll send you a notification 24 hours before your 3 days are up so you can find an internet connection. If you are on a train, there may be on-board Wi-Fi that you can use (note: the Wi-Fi signal must be at least 3 bars or higher). The app does not update in the background, so you’ll need to open the app when you find a connection so we can check your Pass. This won’t affect any of your saved trips or journeys in the app.\n\nIf you haven’t been online in more than 3 days, your mobile Pass will be considered inactive, and you will not be able to use your Pass until you connect to the internet and open the app. This won’t affect any of your saved trips or journeys in the app.\n\nNo, it’s not possible to add more days or countries to your Pass. However, if the Pass is unused, you can opt for an exchange.\n\nIf, during your travels, you decide you would like to extend your trip, you can buy another Pass and add it to your app.\n\nA Child Pass needs to be activated in the same way as a regular Pass and can be on a separate device. The Child Pass should always have its own trip and tickets for inspection on the train.\n\nPlease be aware that a Child Pass and an Adult Pass should have the same country of residence, otherwise they cannot be added to the same device.\n\nNo, you don’t need an internet connection to show your ticket. You only need to be online when you add your journeys to your Pass to create your ticket. Once your ticket is created, you can always show it, even when you’re offline.\n\nHowever, it's important to have regular access to a stable internet connection to keep your Pass active. If you haven’t been online in more than 3 days, your mobile Pass will be considered inactive, and you will not be able to use your Pass until you connect to the internet and open the app.\n\nIf you have already activated your Pass, you can see the validity period in My Pass. Tap on your Pass and check the dates mentioned under 'Validity period'.\n\nIf you haven't activated your Pass, you won't see a validity period. Instead, you will see by which date you can activate your Pass for travel.\n\nYou need to connect a trip to your Pass so that we can check that your Pass is valid for all of the journeys you want to make. Once you connect a trip to your Pass, you can add your journeys to your Pass as you travel and ensure that you have a valid Pass every step of the way.\n\nYou can activate your Pass any time up until your first travel day. You’ll need to fill in the number of the passport or ID you’re travelling with and select the start date of your trip to activate your Pass.\n\nTo board your first train, your Pass needs to be activated. The ticket needs to be created and activated in My Pass before boarding the train.\n\nRemember that you can activate your Pass for travel any time within 11 months of purchase. If you’re not sure when you bought your Pass, you can check your order confirmation email. Note: Passes purchased during a promotion may have a different activation period.\n\nYou can remove your Pass from your device before and after its validity period. Once your Pass is activated and within its validity period, it can’t be deleted or removed. You can check the validity period of your Pass if you have activated it in the 'My Pass' view of the Rail Planner App.\n\nTo remove your Pass, go to the 'My Pass' view in the Rail Planner App, select the Pass that you want to remove, and tap on the 'Remove' button. The remove button will only appear if a Pass is currently invalid and/or not activated.\n\nIf your validity period is yet to start, you can always remove your Pass from your device and add it again later or add it to another device. Please note that if you remove your expired Pass, you cannot add it again later.\n\nIf the details on your mobile Pass are incorrect or outdated and you can’t change it yourself, please get in touch with Eurail customer service. We will be able to change the information for you.\n\nWe can help with:\n\nAdjusting your name (in case of typos, or name changes due to marriage and other legal name changes)\n\nAdjusting your ID/passport information (in case of typos or ID/passport renewal)\n\nAdjusting your date of birth\n\nPlease note that you need to contact customer service before you activate your Pass to change your country of residence.\n\nWe ask for your passport or ID number for safety and verification that the Pass you are travelling with is actually yours. You may be asked to show your passport or ID card when your Pass is being checked by ticket inspectors, so the number on your Pass should match the number on the passport or ID you are carrying.\n\nThe ticket is the part of your Pass that the ticket inspectors will check. In most countries, the ticket inspector will visually check the details on your ticket, including the journey information you added, while in some other countries, the ticket inspector will scan the barcode and visually check the journey information.\n\nYou need a separate ticket for each travel day. You can create your tickets in advance or on the same day you’re travelling, but you need to have a valid ticket to show before boarding a train, bus, or ferry. Creating your ticket on the train, bus, or ferry isn’t allowed and may lead to a fine.\n\nTicket inspectors are currently able to scan the barcode in these countries:\n\nAustria\n\nCzech Republic\n\nDenmark\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nHungary\n\nPoland\n\nRomania\n\nSlovakia\n\nSwitzerland\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nTurkey\n\nIn countries not mentioned above, ticket inspectors will check your ticket visually.\n\nYou can also use the barcode on your ticket to open platform gates in some countries. At present, platform gates can be opened with the barcode in France (TER gates only), Italy, and the Netherlands.\n\nTo get a ticket, you need to add your journeys to your Pass from My Trip. You will then find your tickets in My Pass. Choose the Pass you're travelling with, then tap on a travel day and tap 'Show ticket'. Your ticket contains a barcode, your Pass details, and your journey information for that day.\n\nIf you have a Continuous Pass, select your Pass and simply tap 'Show ticket' to see the current ticket information. You can see the ticket information for a different day by tapping the desired date at the top of the screen in the ticket view.\n\nYour ticket is valid for the whole travel day and can be shown as often as you need. Make sure you add all your journeys to your Pass during your trip, as they need to be visible on your ticket for it to be valid.\n\nNote that each travel day has a separate ticket, so if you're continuing your journey the following day, you'll need to create and show a different ticket during inspection. An exception to this rule applies when you're travelling on a night train. See FAQ 'How do I use the ticket with the night train rule?' to learn more.\n\nIn most countries the ticket inspector will visually check the details on your ticket, including the journey information you added, so make sure to add the right journeys. In some countries the ticket inspector will scan the barcode and visually check the journey information. The ticket inspector may also ask to see your passport or ID card to verify that the Pass is yours.\n\nTicket inspectors are currently able to scan the barcode in these countries:\n\nAustria\n\nCzech Republic\n\nDenmark\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nHungary\n\nPoland\n\nRomania\n\nSlovakia\n\nSwitzerland\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nTurkey\n\nIn countries not mentioned above, ticket inspectors will check your ticket visually.\n\nAdding a journey to your Pass means the journey will appear on your ticket for that travel day. You need to add all your journeys to your Pass as you travel, so you have a valid ticket for every journey.\n\nThe ticket inspector will check the journey details on your ticket, so make sure you add the right journey to your Pass before you board the train.\n\nYou might not find every journey in our timetables, as not all trains in Europe are part of our timetable database. If you can't find your journey, first make sure you've written the station name in the local language.\n\nIf you still can't find your journey, you'll see an option to add a journey manually. There, you'll be able to enter the missing journey details and save this journey to your trip.\n\nMake sure you use correct full station names and train times, as these details will be checked by the ticket inspector. If you're not sure about the details, you can check them at the station. If a train is delayed, please enter the originally scheduled departure time.\n\nYou can use the barcode on your ticket to open platform gates in France (TER gates only), Italy, and the Netherlands. Simply hold it against the scanner to open the platform gates.\n\nIf this is not possible or the platform gates do not open, please speak to a member of staff at the station. They will be able to open the platform gates for you.\n\nIf there is no ‘Show ticket’ button in My Pass, go to My Trip and check if you have added your planned journey to your Pass. Tap the toggle bar on the right to add a journey to your Pass.\n\nIf you're still not sure how to add a journey, follow the steps on creating a ticket explained in our user guide for mobile Pass, which you can find in the Help Centre of the More section of the app.\n\nNo, adding a journey to your Pass is not a reservation. If reservations are required on your journey, you will need to book and pay for a seat reservation separately. For trains that require reservations, the ticket inspector will ask to see your seat reservation along with your ticket in the app.\n\nIf seat reservations aren’t required, you can choose any free seat on board (except in 1st class if you have a 2nd class Pass). Adding a journey to your Pass doesn’t mean you have an allocated seat.\n\nThere is a small possibility of receiving a fine despite having a valid mobile Pass. In the unfortunate event that this does occur, we ask that you note down all details from the specific journey and train, make screenshots of your ticket, fine, and reservation (if applicable), and get in touch with our Customer Service team as soon as possible. They will be able to assist you further.\n\nYou can reach our Customer Service in the Help Centre of the More section of the app. Scroll down to Support, tap Contact Us > Planning & travel issues > Travel issues > Problem with ticket inspection and fill in the form.\n\nUnfortunately our reservations system is not linked to the Rail Planner app, which is why your booked reservations can not be shown with your ticket in the app.\n\nYou can check and download your confirmed reservations in your Eurail account, in the reservations overview. Paper ticket reservations will be sent to you by physical mail.\n\nHow do I show my reservation tickets on the train?\n\nWe recommend you to always print your reservation e-tickets to avoid any inconveniences. Paper ticket reservations need to be brought with you on your Interrail trip, so you can show them on the train.\n\nIt’s possible that railway carriers allow your reservation e-ticket to be scanned from a mobile device, however, we cannot guarantee this will be the case in all countries. Please check your reservation confirmation e-mail or the terms and conditions of the ticket for specific instructions or conditions of use.\n\nYou can cancel your travel day any time before the start of that day (00:00 CET). Go to My Pass, choose the travel day you want to cancel and tap ‘Cancel travel day’.\n\nOnce a travel day has started, it’s no longer possible to cancel it. You cannot cancel a travel day that is in the past.\n\nPlease note that some European countries do not observe Central European Time (CET). This means there can be a difference in the start and end time of a travel day when compared to your local time while travelling.\n\nYou can change your start date any time before the start of that day (00:00 CET). Go to My Pass, tap the three dots on the top right, and tap ‘Deactivate Pass’. You can then choose a new start date by following the steps to activate your Pass.\n\nYou can’t change your start date if the day has started or if it’s in the past.\n\nPlease note that some European countries don’t observe Central European Time (CET). This means there can be a time difference in a day’s start and end compared to your local time while travelling.\n\nIf you are unable to use a travel day but you still have travel days left, your Pass may have expired. You can see your Pass’s validity period in the top section of your Pass. Once your Pass expires, it is no longer valid for travel, even if you did not use all of your travel days.\n\nIf you're travelling on a night train that arrives after midnight, you only need to use a travel day for the day of departure. The app will automatically only use one of your travel days when you add this journey to your Pass. Keep in mind that the arrival day of the night train needs to fall within the validity of your Pass.\n\nIf you change onto another train and keep travelling after your night train arrives, you will need to use another travel day. The app will automatically ask you to use another travel day when you add this journey to your Pass.\n\nEach Pass needs its own trip, so if you've got a few Passes on your device, you’ll need a separate trip for each Pass.\n\nIf you've already created a trip, you can duplicate it to connect a copy of that trip to another Pass.\n\nIt's easy to add journeys from the planner to multiple trips at once, and you can name each trip something different to keep track of all your journeys."
