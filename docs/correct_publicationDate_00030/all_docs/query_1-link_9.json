        "text": "What is an article?\n\nArticles (\"a,\" \"an,\" and \"the\") are determiners or noun markers that function to specify if the noun is general or specific in its reference. Often the article chosen depends on if the writer and the reader understand the reference of the noun.\n\nThe articles \"a\" and \"an\" are indefinite articles. They are used with a singular countable noun when the noun referred to is nonspecific or generic.\n\nThe article \"the\" is a definite article. It is used to show specific reference and can be used with both singular and plural nouns and with both countable and uncountable nouns.\n\nMany languages do not use articles (\"a,\" \"an,\" and \"the\"), or if they do exist, the way they are used may be different than in English. Multilingual writers often find article usage to be one of the most difficult concepts to learn. Although there are some rules about article usage to help, there are also quite a few exceptions. Therefore, learning to use articles accurately takes a long time. To master article usage, it is necessary to do a great deal of reading, notice how articles are used in published texts, and take notes that can apply back to your own writing.\n\nTo get started, please read this blog post on The Argument for Articles.\n\nA few important definitions to keep in mind:\n\nCountable noun: The noun has both a singular and plural form. The plural is usually formed by adding an \"–s\" or an \"–es\" to the end of it.\n\none horse, two horses\n\none chair, two chairs\n\none match, two matches\n\nCountable nouns may also have irregular plural forms. Many of these forms come from earlier forms of English.\n\none child, two children\n\none mouse, two mice\n\nUncountable noun: The noun refers to something that cannot be counted. It does not have a plural form.\n\nInformation\n\nGrammar\n\nProper noun: The name of a person, place, or organization and is spelled with capital letters.\n\nTim Smith\n\nMcDonalds\n\nPlease see this webpage for more about countable and uncountable nouns.\n\nWhen to Use \"A\" or \"An\"\n\n\"A\" and \"an\" are used with singular countable nouns when the noun is nonspecific or generic.\n\nI do not own a car.\n\nIn this sentence, \"car\" is a singular countable noun that is not specific. It could be any car.\n\nShe would like to go to a university that specializes in teaching.\n\n\"University\" is a singular countable noun. Although it begins with a vowel, the first sound of the word is /j/ or “y.” Thus, \"a\" instead of \"an\" is used. In this sentence, it is also generic (it could be any university with this specialization, not a specific one).\n\nI would like to eat an apple.\n\nIn this sentence, \"apple\" is a singular countable noun that is not specific. It could be any apple.\n\n\"A\" is used when the noun that follows begins with a consonant sound.\n\na book\n\na pen\n\na uniform (Note that \"uniform\" starts with a vowel, but the first sound is /j/ or a “y” sound. Therefore \"a\" instead of \"an\" is used here.)\n\n\"An\" is used when the noun that follows begins with a vowel sound.\n\nan elephant\n\nan American\n\nan MBA (Note that \"MBA\" starts with a consonant, but the first sound is /Ɛ/ or a short “e” sound. Therefore, \"an\" instead of \"a\" is used here.)\n\nSometimes \"a\" or \"an\" can be used for first mention (the first time the noun is mentioned). Then, in subsequent sentences, the article \"the\" is used instead.\n\nHe would like to live in a large house. The house should have at least three bedrooms and two bathrooms.\n\nIn the first sentence (first mention), \"a\" is used because it is referring to a nonspecified house. In the second sentence, \"the\" is used because now the house has been specified.\n\nWhen to Use \"The\"\n\n\"The\" is used with both singular and plural nouns and with both countable and uncountable nouns when the noun is specific.\n\nThe book that I read last night was great.\n\nIn this sentence, \"book\" is a singular, countable noun. It is also specific because of the phrase “that I read last night.” The writer and reader (or speaker and listener) know which book is being referred to.\n\nThe books assigned for this class are very useful.\n\nIn this sentence, \"books\" is a plural, countable noun. It is also specific because of the phrase “for this class.” The writer and reader (or speaker and listener) know which books are being referred to.\n\nThe advice you gave me was very helpful.\n\nIn this sentence, \"advice\" is an uncountable noun. However, it is specific because of the phrase “you gave me.” It is clear which piece of advice was helpful.\n\nHere are some more specific rules:\n\n\"The\" is used in the following categories of proper nouns:\n\nMuseums and art galleries: the Walker Art Center, the Minneapolis Institute of Art\n\nBuildings: the Empire State Building, the Willis Tower\n\nSeas and oceans: the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean\n\nRivers: the Mississippi, the Nile\n\nDeserts: the Sahara Desert, the Sonora Desert\n\nPeriods and events in history: the Dark Ages, the Civil War\n\nBridges: the London Bridge, the Mackinac Bridge\n\nParts of a country: the South, the Upper Midwest\n\nIn general, use \"the\" with plural proper nouns.\n\nthe Great Lakes\n\nthe French\n\nthe Rockies (as in the Rocky Mountains)\n\n\"The\" is often used with proper nouns that include an “of” phrase.\n\nthe United States of America\n\nthe University of Minnesota\n\nthe International Swimming Hall of Fame\n\nUse \"the\" when the noun being referred to is unique because of our understanding of the world.\n\nThe Earth moves around the sun.\n\nWolves howl at the moon.\n\nUse \"the\" when a noun can be made specific from a previous mention in the text. This is also known as second or subsequent mention.\n\nMy son bought a cat. I am looking after the cat while he is on vacation.\n\nI read a good book. The book was about how to use articles correctly in English.\n\n\"The\" is used with superlative adjectives, which are necessarily unique (the first, the second, the biggest, the smallest, the next, the only, etc.).\n\nIt was the first study to address the issue.\n\nShe was the weakest participant.\n\nHe was the only person to drop out of the study.\n\nBiber et al. (1999) found that \"the\" is about twice as common as \"a\" or \"an\" in academic writing. This may be because writers at this level often focus on overall ideas and categories (generic reference, usually no article) and on specific references (definite reference, the article \"the\").\n\nBiber, D., Johansson, S., Leech, G., Conrad, S., & Finegan, E. (1999). Longman grammar of written and spoken English. Pearson.\n\nWriters sometimes struggle with the choice to include an article or to leave it out altogether. Keep in mind that if the noun is singular, countable, and nonspecific or generic (e.g., book, author), the articles \"a\" and \"an\" may be used. However, if the noun is countable and plural (e.g.., \"research studies\") or uncountable (e.g., \"information\") and it is being used in a nonspecific or generic way, no article is used.\n\nHere are some more specifics:\n\nNo article is used when a plural countable noun is generic or nonspecific.\n\nI bought new pens and pencils at the store. (general, not specific ones)\n\nCats have big eyes that can see in the dark. (cats in general, all of them)\n\nBabies cry a lot. (babies in general, all of them)\n\nNo article is used when a noncount noun is generic or nonspecific.\n\nI bought milk and rice at the store. (generic reference)\n\nWe were assigned homework in this class. (generic reference)\n\nThere has been previous research on the topic. (generic reference)"
