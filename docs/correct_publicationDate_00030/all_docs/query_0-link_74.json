        "text": "Matt Keely's guide to reading the New Sun tetrology seems relevant here...\n\nUnfortunately, for many readers The Book of the New Sun's reputation for quality is matched only by its alleged difficulty and inaccessibility.\n\nI think that it's difficult in only the most enjoyable ways, and far more accessible than commonly admitted, but for those who remain wary, I offer seven brief pieces of advice for reading The Book of the New Sun.\n\nSet aside the dictionary\n\nReading with a dictionary on hand is among the healthiest habits a reader can develop, but it's a terrible idea for The Book of the New Sun. It's not that Wolfe strews neologisms over the page—every word in the book appears in a dictionary—or that he mangles their use. Rather, most of the potentially-unfamiliar words are extremely rare, and chosen to be evocative, rather than specific. In the brief appendix to the first volume, The Shadow of the Torturer, Wolfe introduces himself as the translator of a book that has somehow made its way to him from Severian's \"posthistoric\" era:\n\nIn many instances I have been forced to replace yet undiscovered concepts by their closest twentieth-century equivalents. Such words as peltast, androgyn, and exultant are substitutions of this kind, and are intended to be suggestive rather than definitive.\n\nRe-readers who want to take a closer look at the New Sun's use of old words should look into Michael Andre-Driussi's Lexicon Urthus, which provides both the standard definitions of all Severian's words and Andre-Driussi's comments about what the word choices imply about Urth and its inhabitants.\n\nWithhold judgment\n\nThe torturers, members of the grandiosely named Order of the Seekers for Truth and Penitence, disguise themselves with masks while performing their grisly duties, but disguise and imposture are everywhere in The Book of the New Sun, as they are in so much of Gene Wolfe's writing. Masks, literal, or metaphorical (or both), are forever being doffed or donned. We're rarely allowed to rest in our interpretations. To take just one vague example, early on in The Claw of the Conciliator, Severian is made to participate in a Black Mass of sorts. I still shudder when I return to those scenes. It's a horrifying, degrading, and macabre scene, perhaps Wolfe's most nightmarish, yet the results of the perverse ceremony prove to be beautiful.\n\nMind the gaps\n\nSeverian is an unreliable narrator for several reasons, but not much of a liar. He self-justifies and misinterprets, but rarely lies outright. Pay attention to his sins of omission: the white space between chapters and the gap between one book's end and another's beginning are rarely insignificant.\n\nConnect the dots\n\nThere are several mysteries I didn't even notice, much less solve, on my first reading of The Book of the New Sun, but other secrets will reveal themselves to any attentive and open-minded reader. Take, for example, some of the mysteries surrounding Severian's lover Dorcas, a major figure throughout the series. There's a very surprising revelation about her in The Citadel of the Autarch, provided you've picked up a few scattered clues throughout the preceding books. Of course, these connections are easier to spot if you…\n\n…Read quickly (but not too quickly)\n\nLike The Lord of the Rings, The Book of the New Sun was published before the great age of doorstop fantasy, and so the individual volumes are relatively thin. Tolkien insisted that The Lord of the Rings, three-volume format aside, was really a single long novel, and there's much to be said for taking a similar approach to The Book of the New Sun. Wolfe's narrator claims to possess a perfect memory; if you're less fortunate, don't linger too long between volumes: they're short, and a small detail in one book frequently presages a large revelation in a later one.\n\nAnd if you like it, read on\n\nGene Wolfe finished The Book of the New Sun with one of his \"slingshot endings\": The New Sun imminent, but not yet dawned. David Hartwell convinced Wolfe there was material for a fifth book; for his pains he received the book's dedication. The Urth of the New Sun is sometimes overlooked, which is a shame: it's one of Wolfe's best books, and while Severian remains its narrator, he writes from a different point in his eventful life and about a very different setting.\n\nSome years later, Wolfe published The Book of the Long Sun and The Book of the Short Sun. Though I won't name names here, the history of science fiction sequel series is a long and frequently depressing tale of authors cashing in and tuning out; I've never heard this complaint about Wolfe's other Sun titles. The plots of Long Sun and Short Sun books are only tangentially connected to their predecessor, and their styles are very different, but they explore many of the same themes of memory, identity, and belief. I'm a New Sun partisan myself, but I'm sympathetic to those readers who prefer the Long/Short sequence.\n\nFinally, have fun\n\nThere's a besetting sin of Wolfe acolytes, especially those looking to make new converts, and I have long been guilty of it—we fail to convey how truly enjoyable these books really are. Yes, Wolfe is one of the genre's best stylists; yes, his narrators are unreliable; yes, he can be challenging; and yes, his books often demand rereading. These statements are all true, but they have the cumulative effect of making the books sound more admirable than enjoyable. Let's dispense with the notion that The Book of the New Sun is good for you, but not fun. There are monsters, aliens, and robots. There are named swords and mysterious artifacts. There are duels and pitched battles and, in the end, the fate of the world is at stake. Enjoy the adventure.\n\nI'm surprised to see only one mention of Numenera. Cook is explicit about it being an inspiration, and you can really tell. I think it falls well short of capturing what makes the original books so great. The shortfall should serve as instructive for any who tread the same path.\n\nBut that's to be expected, isn't it? How could one possibly replicate the mood of the books? To me the idea of adventuring in New Sun is a tempting idea but ultimately futile. Yes, the world-building is excellent, but it's so strongly tied to all of the other elements of New Sun's greatness. Good luck with that!\n\nI can say that New Sun has influenced content I've come up with for gaming many times, but you know what they say: you never go Full Wolfe.\n\nI do, however, own GURPs: New Sun.\n\nWhat? Where? I have to read this if only to appreciate all those great setting details.\n\nI do like the genre, however. I would probably class it as 'sword and planet'.\n\nThat just doesn't feel right to me, somehow.\n\nI've got Chronicles of Future Earth, which is strongly inspired by New Sun. It was released as an supplement for BRP, but I don't think it is available at the moment\n\nNow that's interesting.\n\nHowever, Severian is an unreliable narrator and may or may not be telling the truth at all times.\n\nThere's something...wrong...with Severian. Beyond the obvious stuff. Sometimes his affect reminds me a lot of Meursault in Camus' The Stranger. Weirdly detached. Yes, I know there are some good reasons for this.\n\nI think that it's difficult in only the most enjoyable ways, and far more accessible than commonly admitted...\n\nThe thing about New Sun is that it's inscrutability really is a feature. Confusion is part of the intended effect. People are used to thinking that they're not getting it if they are thoroughly disoriented by a book. But part of the joy of New Sun is diving into the confusion and letting the alien diction and setting wash over you. It's only when you get to the end that it becomes clear that you were being bamboozled the whole time - there were very good reasons certain things made no sense, and there's no way they could have made sense when you read them.\n\nOf course, there's all the other stuff that still doesn't make sense when you're done. But it's not actually necessary to solve all of Wolfe's mysteries and indirections.\n\nReading with a dictionary on hand is among the healthiest habits a reader can develop, but it's a terrible idea for The Book of the New Sun. It's not that Wolfe strews neologisms over the page—every word in the book appears in a dictionary—or that he mangles their use. Rather, most of the potentially-unfamiliar words are extremely rare, and chosen to be evocative, rather than specific.\n\nThis is all part of the disorientation. Reminiscent of A Clockwork Orange but far more parsimonious. The words as so evocative that I didn't realize immediately that some of them were unfamiliar to me or mangled and repurposed (like \"fuligin\").\n\n[ . . . ]\n\n(1) Can you tell me a little about the book? Is it scifi (as it sounds) or fantasy? (I can look it up on Wikipedia but I'd rather get a first-hand view.)\n\nIt's set in a 'dying earth' type setting way way in the future and it has the feel of a fantasy novel but no actual magic - although many things are described by the narrator as if they were magic. The unreliable narrator is a key part of the story - the book is very much taken from the protagonist's point of view.\n\n(2) Briefly, what makes the book so awesome?\n\nDepth, obliquely referred meaning and more depth. It's very complex and subtle - even richer than Dune or Lord of the Rings. The first person view is very atmospheric.\n\nI won't go into spoilers but it's very much an all-time great. I suggest you read it once or twice, get one of the guides and then read it again. It can stand multiple re-readings and unless you have superhuman reading comprehension you will need to read it multiple times to really understand it. I've been re-reading it every decade or so since the 1980s and I still wouldn't claim to fully understand all the nuances.\n\nDefinitely worth reading.\n\n[ . . . ]\n\nI'm not sure I have the time at the moment to describe properly what makes it so awesome, so I'll get back to you on that.\n\nWell, with the 'rona you could make it a project for the lockdown.\n\nSeriously 'rona? What is this - 1973?"
