        "text": "So, I finally finished The Citadel of the Autarch, the 4th book in Gene Wolfe’s The Book of the New Sun. The days after I finished felt like going through tangential stages of grief. First, I was mad “that’s how it ends!? I’ve got to read the entire damn thing all over again from start to finish now!”. Then I was confused, by a whole tone of WTFery at the end, then I was curious and got some helpful spoilers online. Then I experienced acceptance that Gene Wolfe is, as always, a brilliant mastermind of storytelling. Even better – these aren’t the stages of grief, but the stages of awakening.\n\nAs I’ve done in previous entries in this little series of blog posts, we’ll start with new words\n\nBacele Graisle Orphicheide Orpiment\n\nI didn’t take much notes while reading this fourth book, but I’m laughing at something I wrote down on my scribble sheet – “I know it is gross and taboo, but I’m surprised Severian doesn’t get more people’s memories the way he got Thecla’s (although he hadn’t planned to get hers). It seems a simple way to learn about a person’s world. Wait a minute. . . is this narrator just someone who got Severian’s memories?”\n\nOnce I’d finished the book, my comment became hilarious. And only half right.\n\nSome other notes I wrote down –\n\nLove hearing Thecla’s voice, in first person. When Severian gets tired, it seems easier for her to come to the surface.\n\nThe Ascian in the field hospital, is he satirical? I love the stories that were told in the field hospital. Once it’s the Ascian’s turn, Severian learns how language, story, and communication actually work.\n\nThe Anchorite’s house!!! The top layers are in the future, that is SO cool!\n\nOne of the very last scenes, where they go back to the Inn near the Sanguinary Fields, and talk with the guy there. Oh, that made me cry!\n\nLike i said, it’s been two weeks, and I should have written this blog post when the end of the book was fresh in my mind, as everything is a little fuzzy now. Although now I better understand why everyone says you need to read this series multiple times to get all the pieces. It’s a little like walking through where Rudesind is cleaning the paintings – only a few paintings are perfectly clean at the same time, so if you want to see them all, you better walk through the galleries every few weeks, because each time, you’ll see something different. Everytime you read this series, I imagine you’ll catch more and different things, everytime you read it you get more of a foundation for the next time.\n\nWarning: major spoilers ahead. If you haven’t read this series, stop reading now. Not only will this spoil the series for you, but our of context it makes zero sense.\n\nBut back to my silly note about why doesn’t Severian get more people’s memories the way he got Thecla’s. So, of course he DOES get someone else’s memories in a similar fashion, and that is how the end of the book happens. So, why doesn’t EVERYONE do this? Weren’t there other people at the supper party who partook? Aren’t other people walking around with Thecla’s memories?\n\nSeverian likes to brag that he remembers everything perfectly. He’s also walking around with two sets of memories in his head. I’ll bet he remembers his time with Thecla differently than she remembers it, but both memories are valid, they are just from different points of view.\n\nAnd now that he has the Autarch’s memories, he can remember all sorts of things, but from other points of view. AND, since I’m pretty sure he has lived his life over and over and over again (wow, Groundhog Day?), all those memories are equally valid, if somewhat different. So, saying “I crossed the river that day” and “I didn’t cross the river that day” could both be perfectly correct, even though they aren’t the same.\n\nAgain, why doesn’t everyone gain memories and knowledge this way? If this was a straight up science fiction book, the characters would be downloading knowledge into their brain instead of consuming it through a taboo rite akin to cannibalism, and readers wouldn’t blink an eye. “Downloading” knowledge and memories right from someone’s brain seems a pretty brilliant way to share knowledge. Wait, unless you didn’t want people to have the knowledge? Would it have been a wonderful thing or a terrible thing if an autach died in front of an audience, and had everyone in the room partake of the ceremony? Would everyone who partook, then be an Autarch? And we can’t all be rulers, can we?\n\nAnd if someone really had knowledge you wanted (Baldanders! I want to know what he knows!) could you just kill that person, take the drug, and then eat their brain? How would you protect yourself from that fate? How would you protect what is in your mind?\n\nAs you can see, I have more questions now than when I started. I guess that’s how I know I’ve read a Gene Wolfe? Something else that happens to me when I read a Gene Wolfe is that I often feel like I want to read the book again immediately, but read it backwards, to see if it is the same story, or the mirror image of a completely different once."
