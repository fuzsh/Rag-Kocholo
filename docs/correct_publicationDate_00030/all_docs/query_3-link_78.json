You can go to Home > Address Book, choose the problematic address book, click File > Properties, check the value under \"the current server is\". If it points to a local path located at âC:\\Users*username*\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Outlook\\Offline Address Books\\â, then it's an offline address book:\n\nSupposing your issue is with the offline address book and it works fine when checking the global address list in OWA, please run the command below to force update the OAB:\n\nGet-OfflineAddressBook | Update-OfflineAddressBook\n\nThen open Outlook, go to Send/Receive > Send/Receive Groups > Download address book and check the result:\n\nIf an Answer is helpful, please click \"Accept Answer\" and upvote it.\n\nNote: Please follow the steps in our documentation to enable e-mail notifications if you want to receive the related email notification for this thread."
