        "text": "So, I recently finished reading The Book Of The New Sun for the first\n\ntime. Thoughts and notes...\n\nDid anyone else read this line as a tribute to Jack Vance: \"But in time\n\nI tired of those puerile ideas, and began in their place to think of\n\nsocieties and ways of thought wholly different from our own ... worlds\n\nwhere there was no currency but honor, so that everyone worked in order\n\nthat he might be entitled to associate himself with some man or woman who\n\nhad saved the community ...\" (Sword & Citadel, p. 71 Orb edition)\n\nMy favorite quote: \"There is no limit to stupidity. Space itself is\n\nsaid to be bounded by its own curvature, but stupidity continues beyond\n\ninfinity.\" (Sword & Citadel, p. 327 Orb edition)\n\nAnd now for the reason this post is so damn long. :) Early on in the\n\nbook, I found myself writing down all the words I didn't know and looking\n\nthem up at the end of each chapter. I figured doing my note-taking on\n\ncomputer would allow me to share the results. So here is a first pass at\n\na Wolfe lexicon. (I know of Wolfe's essay in Castle Of Days, which only\n\ncovers the vocabulary in the first book, and of Lexicon Urthus, which\n\ncosts $40 -- I figured there might be a niche for a free compendium\n\ncovering all four books, albeit shallowly.) Definitions are synopses and\n\nparaphrases of entries from Webster's New Universal Unabridged\n\nDictionary. This will be up at my web page soon:\n\nhttp://www.ils.nwu.edu/~davies/\n\nFor a number of words, I found something close in spelling, which may or\n\nmay not be right in terms of meaning -- I was just writing down spellings,\n\nnot contexts, so I can't go back and check. I'm also not 100% confident\n\nin my spellings in my notes, so I'm worried that some of the things I\n\ncouldn't find definitions for aren't really in the book as I've\n\ntranscribed them. This is really a first draft. In order to get this\n\nreally polished, I'd need someone to give it a spin. If you decide to\n\nreread The Book and want to be a Glossary Beta Tester, let me know. :)\n\nSuggestions and comments would be appreciated. I'd love to fill in gaps,\n\nidentify cases where I've got the wrong word or the wrong definition of\n\nthe right word. And I'm already convinced that organizing this by book\n\nstinks.\n\nLater in the series, I started noticing the patterns of South American and\n\nprehistoric animals, Greek government and military organization, etc. and\n\nstarted writing down words that fit the pattern even if I knew them,\n\nlooking toward a potential bestiary or some such. I also wrote down words\n\nthat were too cool to not include, even if I knew them.\n\nDespite Wolfe's claims, I'm almost convinced he made up the following --\n\ncan anybody give a source for these:\n\navern - the deadly plant used as a weapon\n\nnotule - the black clothlike creatures\n\nalzabo - the red beast that ingests memory\n\nAnd I've numbered all of his synonyms for prostitute -- there are enough\n\nof them that it got amusing, not to mention hard to keep track... :)\n\nTHE BOOK OF THE NEW SUN VOCABULARY\n\nSHADOW\n\nagouti -
