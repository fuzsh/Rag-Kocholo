        "text": "Step into the torturer’s shadow.\n\nGene Wolfe’s The Book of the New Sun is an epic tale of science fiction masquerading as medieval fantasy. It spans four books: The Shadow of the Torturer, The Claw of the Conciliator, The Sword of the Lictor, and The Citadel of the Autarch. Less well known outside of the science fiction and fantasy community, The Book of the New Sun has a fervent following within it. Little surprise, then, that The Folio Society’s 2019 four-volume limited edition offering was snapped-up in no time and now commands vertigo-inducing price premiums on the secondary market. For those of us who wished to dip a toe in the water rather than dive in headfirst, The Folio Society issued a standard edition two years later. It’s this standard edition I’ll be looking at here.\n\nExterior production\n\nThe limited edition’s four cloth-bound books have been compressed into two quarter-cloth volumes with printed paper sides. Each volume is chunky (a bit over 500 pages), but manageable for laptop reading. Fortunately, we don’t miss out on any of the limited edition’s cover art because the designs from each of the LE’s volumes are printed on the front and back boards of the standard edition’s two.\n\nThose images are by the illustrator, Sam Weber, and comprise bold graphic designs in primary colours. They’re striking and a little bit unsettling, which makes them a good thematic match for the books. The spines of both volumes are black cloth blocked in red with the author’s name, abbreviated titles, and the Folio Society colophon. The top edge of the text block is stained black to match. The volumes come together in a black slipcase with a silver foil design that borrows iconography from the book.\n\nA Folio Society Devotees post by wongie provides a helpful side-by-side comparison of the limited and standard editions. At first glance, the standard edition has the advantage of more vibrant reproduction of the cover designs. But we shouldn’t jump to a quick judgement. Another thread reveals numerous posters bemoaning quality control issues that seem to have afflicted the standard edition. Reported issues include marks or blemishing of the covers, cut marks in the staining of the page edges, and inconsistent printing. My personal experience of the book has mostly been problem free, but that might make me one of the lucky ones. The one problem I did observe is that the staining to the top edge has been applied a bit unevenly has occasionally bled down to form a bit of a ragged edge on the page surface. Even putting those issues aside, this feels like a fairly standard Folio Society offering and the £125 price seems perhaps a little high, even for two volumes.\n\nInterior presentation and design\n\nInside we find the text is printed on Yu Long Pure paper. This is a smooth stock whose brilliant white might be a bit overpowering for some. But it has good opacity and presents the text clearly. The text is set in Jenson with Priori Serif display. Red drop capitals open of each chapter and were individually drawn by Sam Weber to incorporate design elements from the story. That’s a nice typographical touch and it’s good to see the two-colour printing has surviving the leap from the limited edition. Sam Weber has also provided a generous 20 illustrations: eight in colour and twelve black and white. They are painted in a realist style that will be familiar to anyone who has seen another Weber-illustrated Folio edition (Dune, Fahrenheit 451), and have a dark, foreboding quality that suits the story well. Similar to other books illustrated by Weber, there’s a particular focus on images of characters and my personal preference would have been to have at least one or two wider vistas to help with world-building. But there can be no doubting that the quality of the illustrations make them a real highlight of the edition. Neil Gaiman has provided an introduction that should prepare readers well to appreciate the novels to follow.\n\nAssessing the story (spoiler free)\n\nThe Book of the New Sun is ostensibly a medieval fantasy tale filled with swords, citadels, and arcane guilds. But there are occasional hints that this “medieval” world in fact exists in a distant and decayed future. Indeed, the novels are full of latent themes, misdirection, and concealed hints that, to an attentive reader, peel back multiple layers of depth and hidden meaning. I think this is one of the main factors that animates the books’ loyal following: you can spend years in Internet forums discussing theories and arguing over interpretations and the books should be felicitous to repeat readings. This is one of three big strengths of the work in my view. The other two are the quality of writing (literary, in a genre that’s usually anything but), and the quality of world building (dark, gritty, and intensely original). All of the ingredients are therefore in place for a captivating science-fiction epic whose appeal reaches beyond the narrow confines of the genre.\n\nAll that said, I became disenchanted with The Book of the New Sun in its latter half, owing to a meandering, and ultimately directionless plot. The initial setup seemingly paves the way for an epic adventure, but there’s a lack of long-term motivation or goals for the protagonist that leaves him still wandering aimlessly around the world 400 pages after his apparent destination is reached. It’s hard to avoid the feeling that, by that point, Wolfe was making it up as he went along. This issue is compounded by the observation that most of the supporting cast we meet along the way play little role beyond facilitating another digression with no ultimate purpose. This was frustrating to me because it seems like a straightforward reformulation of the plot would give it a satisfying narrative structure without having to sacrifice any of those ingredients that mark the books’ potential. For this reason, I’d struggle to recommend The Book of the New Sun to all but a particular kind of reader, who probably know about it already. ■\n\nWhere to buy\n\nAt the time of writing, the standard edition can be bought direct from the Folio Society.\n\nYou can also search for this edition on eBay US*, eBay UK*, AbeBooks US*, or AbeBooks UK*.\n\n* denotes an affiliate link."
