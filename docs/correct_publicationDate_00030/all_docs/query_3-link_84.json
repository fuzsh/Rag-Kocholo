        "text": "What is a prairie?\n\nPrairies are ecosystems that grow where the climate dictates limited rainfall, hot summers and cold winters. Plants growing in prairies are typically non-woody, or herbaceous plants. Trees are rare in a prairie and are confined to wet areas or along rivers or streams.\n\nPrairies are dominated by grasses and usually benefit from periodic fires.\n\nPrairie soils are rich in organic matter from the decomposition of plant material, especially the fibrous roots of grasses produced in previous growing seasons.\n\nA native plant is one that was growing naturally in a specific area before white or European settlement.\n\nA wildflower, also called a forb, is a native plant that is not a grass and grows without human care.\n\nNon-native plants are sometimes called \"exotics\" or “introduced”, whether they were introduced hundreds of years ago by settlers and travelers, or recently purchased from a mail order nursery catalog.\n\nResidential prairie or prairie garden\n\nA residential prairie or prairie garden is a smaller site, typically 1/4 acre or larger, which has been planted with native grasses, sedges and wildflowers.\n\nIt reflects the original grassland vegetation dominant in the Midwest prior to European settlement.\n\nIt is a low-maintenance landscape that encourages a diversity of plant and animal species.\n\nThe importance of prairies\n\nPrairies provide a place for many diverse plants that support a wide range of birds, butterflies and other native wildlife. Without suitable prairie habitat, many birds, insects and butterflies are reduced in number and are in danger of becoming threatened and extinct.\n\nHomeowners can plant prairie gardens in an urban or suburban area that can be part of a larger ecosystem that will provide suitable habitat for many native plants, insects and birds.\n\nOver the years, a prairie may take less time and money to maintain than a conventional lawn, with reduced use of irrigation, pesticides, fertilizers and mowing.\n\nPlanting a residential or prairie garden\n\nSelect a site with the following specifications:\n\nFull sun with few trees.\n\nOn the east, west or south side of buildings.\n\nDoes not contain weedy vegetation such as quackgrass, Canada thistle, reed canary grass.\n\nSeek professional help for preparing such a site.\n\nTo avoid fire danger:\n\nLocate the prairie at least 30 feet from buildings.\n\nSeparate the prairie from buildings with an area of gravel, concrete, turfgrass or irrigated plantings.\n\nPrune live and dead branches of nearby trees at least ten feet above the ground.\n\nSite design\n\nCheck with your local city government about local weed ordinances before developing a prairie. You may need to apply for variances.\n\nSome prairies look more natural than other landscapes. Discuss the prairie with neighbors to let them know about the changes you are making and that the site is being maintained.\n\nConsider using mowed edges, signs, bird houses and edging fences near your prairie to show the area is meant to be there.\n\nSoil analysis\n\nPrairie plants are adapted to specific soil types and moisture levels. Understand the drainage and sun and shade exposure of your site when selecting plants for your location.\n\nDetermine whether you have sandy, clay or loamy soil.\n\nHave your soil tested at the University of Minnesota Soil Testing Lab to determine the soil pH and organic matter.\n\nDetermine the soil moisture of your site.\n\nDry - draining readily with no standing water.\n\nMesic - medium moisture with some puddles after rain.\n\nWet - wet soil throughout the season with standing water in spring and fall.\n\nStanding water or water that does not drain from a 1-foot-deep hole within 24 hours are indicators of wet and poorly drained soils.\n\nRemove all existing plants to reduce plant competition. New prairie seedlings are not able to establish if they are competing with existing vegetation. Weeds and turfgrasses must be removed. Seed must have good contact with soil for germination.\n\nThree methods to establish a prairie in an existing lawn or area of other vegetation:\n\nThe most common method of establishment uses a nonselective herbicide containing the active ingredient glyphosate to kill all existing vegetation. Follow directions carefully and wear protective gear.\n\nWait 1 to 2 weeks after applying glyphosate. When existing vegetation has died, the soil should be tilled to a depth of 12 inches or more with a rototiller, harrow or disc to incorporate dead material.\n\nIf a seed drill or slit seeder will be used in planting, tilling may be eliminated and the now dead vegetation mowed to a 1- to 2-inch stubble.\n\nAfter tilling, the site should be raked, either by hand or with a power rake.\n\nCAUTION: Mention of a pesticide or use of a pesticide label is for educational purposes only. Always follow the pesticide label directions attached to the pesticide container you are using. Remember, the label is the law.\n\nPut a dark plastic sheet, tarp or pieces of plywood over the grass for at least two months before you begin planting.\n\nAll plants will be killed and can be removed. It may be difficult to remove tough perennial weeds like thistles and quackgrass.\n\nOnce the vegetation is dead, till the area thoroughly.\n\nThis method works best when begun in the summer or fall to prepare for a spring planting.\n\nTurn the soil and cultivate the area every few weeks for a complete growing season.\n\nTurning the soil brings weed seeds to the surface, and cultivating kills the seeds that have germinated since the soil was last turned.\n\nTill to a depth of 12 inches or more and rake the area to create a uniform fine seedbed.\n\nSelect plants that will grow well in the sun, shade, soil type and moisture of your particular site.\n\nPrairies consist of 80 percent grasses and sedges and 20 percent wildflowers or forbs. Include a mixture of warm-season and cool-season grasses.\n\nWarm-season grasses predominate in prairies. They are slow to grow in the spring but tolerate summer heat and drought and flower in the late summer and fall.\n\nCool-season grasses grow in early spring and fall but are often dormant in summer.\n\nGrasses provide physical support, weed competition, protection for wildflowers and a source of food and shelter for birds during the winter.\n\nA \"nurse grass\" that germinates quickly may be planted to minimize weed competition during establishment.\n\nWildflowers should be selected based on soil moisture and available sunlight and should include a variety of bloom times to support native insects and butterflies.\n\nSeeds vs. plants\n\nYou can start a prairie from seeds or plants. Plants can be used for small areas, however larger areas will require seed for establishment.\n\nStarting from seed is more economical, but can take two to five years for the plants to reach full size.\n\nPlants are more expensive, but establish quickly and may flower the first year. Plants can be planted anytime from spring through fall.\n\nSome species are available only as live plants.\n\nPrairie seed companies create seed mixes appropriate to your site conditions.\n\nConsult with local seed dealers to determine the correct mixtures and amounts.\n\nBe sure that any seeds you purchase are packaged for the year that you will sow them and list current germination and pure live seed percentages.\n\n\"Seed-in-a-can\" wildflower mixes are not recommended as they often contain annual plants and a mixture of seed for all soil types.\n\nGroup several plants of the same species together to make a showy display and to increase pollination and seed set.\n\nCommon prairie wildflowers\n\nName Flower color Flowering date Height Big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) Bronze with bluish stems Aug. - Sept 3-8' Butterfly weed (Asclepias tuberosa) Orange-red July - Aug. 1-2' Blue false indigo (Baptisia australis) Blue June - July 2-5' Purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea) Purple June - Sept. 2-4' Oxeye (Helianthus helianthoides) Yellow July-Sept. 3-4’ Meadow blazing star (Liatris pycnostachya) Purple Aug. - Sept. 2-4' Hoary puccoon (Lithospermum canescens) Orange May - June 1-2' Wild lupine (Lupinus perennis) Blue May - June 1-2' Large-flowered beardtongue (Penstemon grandiflorus) Pink/purple May - June 2-3' Prairie phlox (Phlox pilosa) Pink/purple May - July 1-3' Grey-headed coneflower (Ratibida pinnata) Yellow July - Sept. 3-6' Black-eyed Susan (Rudbeckia hirta) Yellow July - Aug. 2-3' Little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) White with bluish foliage Aug. - Sept. 2-4' Cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum) Yellow Aug.-Oct. 3-7’\n\nCommon prairie grasses\n\nName Flower color Flowering date Height Sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula) Orange-purple July - Sept. 1-3' Blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) Tan with green stems July-Sept. 18-30” Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis) Tan with green stems June-Sept. 3-4” Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) Red, purple and tan flowers July-Sept. 3-6’ Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans) Golden-brown Aug. - Sept. 3-6'\n\nPlanting grasses\n\nThe best time to sow seed is in the spring between May 15 and June 20. Seed may also be sown in fall, between mid-October and freezing.\n\nEven seed distribution and good seed-to-soil contact are essential.\n\nSeed may be broadcast by hand:\n\nMix seed with slightly damp sawdust or peat moss as a carrier.\n\nUse one bushel of carrier per 1000 sq. ft. of area.\n\nDistribute seed in a broad arc to spread evenly.\n\nA spreader may be used:\n\nMix seed with clean sand or vermiculite.\n\nMake passes in two different directions.\n\nFor larger areas, mechanical planters can be used, including:\n\nTye drill, Truax drill, Rangeland drill.\n\nBrillion seeder.\n\nAfter sowing, roll seed to improve soil-to-seed contact. Be sure to roll when soil is dry.\n\nPlanting wildflowers\n\nWildflowers may be sown with grasses or planted one to two years after grasses have been sown.\n\nWildflowers are generally sown from seed on larger sites, as this is most economical. Plants will take two to five years to establish and bloom.\n\nWildflower seedlings may be planted also. Transplants are more expensive, but establish and bloom quickly.\n\nWildflowers may be clustered near paths and residences for best color in these areas.\n\nSeeding rates\n\nSeeding rate varies by species and seed quality.\n\nA general rule of thumb is 30 seeds per square foot.\n\nGrasses may be sown as low as 20 seeds per square foot.\n\nForbs or wildflowers as high as 60 seeds per square foot.\n\nConsult information on the label for each type of seed you are planting.\n\nHand sowing for small sites may require more seed.\n\nGet more specific instructions on seeding rates from the information provided when buying seeds.\n\nWatering after seeding improves germination, but is not essential unless no rainfall occurs for several weeks.\n\nCover with a thin mulch of clean, weed-free straw to prevent drying, reduce exposure to wind and animals and to prevent erosion on slopes.\n\nPrairies usually do not need herbicides, fungicides, insecticides or fertilizers.\n\nWeed control in the first two years of a prairie is essential.\n\nHand weeding, burning and mowing are the most effective ways to control weeds.\n\nRemove woody plants, such as tree seedlings.\n\nAny weeds that are allowed to go to seed will mean more work in the future.\n\nRemove weed seed-heads in the first few years to eliminate future problems.\n\nFirst year management:\n\nControl weeds by mowing regularly in the first year to a height of 4 to 6 inches. Mowing at this height will reduce weed competition without harming new prairie grasses and wildflowers.\n\nDo not allow weeds to go to flower and seed. Ideally all weeds can be mowed or removed to grow no taller than 8 to 12 inches.\n\nDon’t pull weeds by hand as this disturbs new prairie plants and may introduce additional weed seeds.\n\nAt the beginning of the second season, evaluate how many weeds are present. It may be necessary to mow the prairie to 4 to 6 inches the second and third year to keep weeds under control.\n\nThe goal is to minimize weed and seed set while allowing prairie plants to grow.\n\nPrairie grasses develop roots the first few years and grow slowly above ground.\n\nBy the third year, the plants develop more growth above ground.\n\nLong-term management:\n\nAfter the prairie has been established for at least three years, you can maintain the prairie with controlled burns.\n\nControlled burns are recommended for larger sites, which are often done on a rotation basis, with 1/3 of the plot mowed annually.\n\nBurning in April or early May is best for native plants.\n\nCheck with your local fire department and the Department of Natural Resources to get information and required permits.\n\nOn smaller sites, mowing is an alternative to controlled burning.\n\nMow once a year after prairie seeds have fallen, usually in early spring.\n\nRemove clippings to expose crowns of plants.\n\nFor additional help in establishing and maintaining your prairie, consult private restoration or landscaping companies and the Department of Natural Resources.\n\nAuthors: Mary Meyer, Extension horticulturist and Julie Weisenhorn, Extension educator\n\nReviewed in 2024"
