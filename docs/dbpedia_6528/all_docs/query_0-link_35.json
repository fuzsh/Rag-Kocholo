        "meta_description": "This paper focuses on privately issued currencies by women in mid-17th century London. These currencies appeared across England as part of a large wave of minting which began during the English Civil War as a result of severe shortages of low value coinage (‘small change’), used for purposes of petty trade. In London alone over 4200 tradesmen and businesses issued tokens, only around 140 of these issuers were women. The tokens are a rare visual and material source on the daily life of working women and their self-representation. By contextualizing the issuers’ occupations and token designs within the history of women’s legal status, this paper will demonstrate that token issuers were likely not under the status of married women. The paper examines who these women issuers were, their occupations, and the legal status that enabled them to become independent active agents within the new commercial sphere of tokens. The paper will demonstrate that the artifact of tokens issued by women is extraordinary within the phenomenon, though the line of work these women did was not unique in the period. The ability of women to represent themselves on a token was likely a direct result of their legal status and the commercial rights it entailed.",

        "text": "The trades of the women token issuers in the mid-17th century seem at a first glance eclectic. It includes for example, one potter, three coffee shop owners, one weaver, two meal shop owners and one shoemaker. The largest group of women token issuers that can clearly be identified are tavern and ale house keepers that consist of around 20 token issuers.\n\nDefining the trades of the women token issuers was based on two parameters: inscriptions and iconography. When a profession is inscribed on the token it is taken as a clear indication of trade. Arms of a London livery company is taken to represent membership in the given company. Membership is important to understand women’s economic lives, but it does not necessarily indicate a particular trade. It was necessary to be a member of a livery company to trade in London, but sometimes people practiced different unrelated trades from the company to which they belonged (Erickson, 2011).Footnote 4 In the cases of coffee shops, ale houses, and taverns trade was determined when the iconography and inscriptions match the format of the majority of such token types. Out of the 140 women issuers, 85 have no clear indicator of trade, though the majority do have a lone symbol inscribed, some of which are associated with particular trades. For example, Margret Randell and Sherly Bladworth both issued their tokens with a sugar loaf (which was how sugar was sold at the time). This was usually attributed to grocers, but there were also taverns with this name. For this reason, lone symbols were not used as a clear indicator of trade. Table 1 details the trade of women issuers and membership in livery companies.\n\nWhat women did for a living in early modern England has been the subject of historiographic debate. Alice Clark’s seminal book on the topic “Working Life of Women in the Seventeenth Century” (1919) revealed many aspects of women’s work previously unknown. Her main claim is that women mainly worked within their husbands’ businesses, as their opportunities for other forms of employment declined in the 17th century. This claim has been widely disputed. Research since the 1980s revealed a much more nuanced picture in which most women were working, often for wages outside of the family business and in separate professions as compared to their husbands. Types of work in which women partook were frequently gendered and casual, their work being valued different than men’s, leading to lower pay and exclusion from high paying employment. Yet despite these limitations women were actively involved in many economic sectors, including skilled trades, retail, provision trades, etc. (Crawford and Gowing, 2000, p. 73; Earle, 1989; Humphries and Weisdorf, 2015). In order to understand how female token issuers fit into these historiographic findings it is important to look at women’s work in the period through the lens of social class and marital status.\n\nToken issuers’, both women and men, came from a commercial class which was relatively wealthy, though not the wealthiest members of society. Issuing tokens did not demand a significant amount of capital, but it was not something any tradesmen could afford (Burnett, 2019; Muldrew, 1998, p. 54). Many women who issued tokens would have needed to both own property and control their earnings to carry out their trade. These women would have needed to order regular supplies. For example, grocers in London typically carried a variety of high-end goods and often were significant importers as well, thus, operating also as large-scale wholesalers (Stobart, 2013). If Mary Child and Ann Clark, two token issuers who likely belonged to the grocers’ livery company, had a small-scale grocer operation they would have needed to do business with other traders. Moreover, token issuers would have operated from set locations—shops or drinking establishments. Tokens are designed to identify the issuer based on their particular location, hence the mention of a particular street and the iconography that often correlated with the sign outside of the establishment. So token issuers’ either owned a shop or paid rent, meaning that these women would have needed a license to trade. In London this would have entailed membership in a livery company, as will be explained below. This means that many of these women would be considered mistresses, the equivalent of masters at the time. They had capital, may have employed other men and women, or trained them as apprentices (Erickson, 2014). All this points to women who were of higher status than most women working in London.\n\nThe majority of women worked for wages and were not members of livery companies. Women were hired as teachers and servants, two of the commonest jobs of working women in London. Servants were often single women and worked in these capacities until they married or took on another waged labor job (Crawford and Gowing, 2000, p. 71; Earle, 1989; Willen, 1988). Often women worked in the expanding informal economy for wages. London’s informal economy had expanded rapidly in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, as the population drastically grew in London and its suburbs. The growth in commercial activity meant that civic authorities and livery company officials had less ability to enforce labor standards and market regulations, particularly true during the years of the civil war. Women could be found selling a variety of goods as petty retailers, traveling vendors, selling food in markets, unlicensed alewives, pawnbrokers, and also working in shops (Earle, 1989; Korda, 2011, pp. 5–24; Mendelson and Crawford, 1998, pp. 314–344; Reinke-Williams, 2014, pp. 103–126). In addition, women dominated certain aspects of wage-earning textile work and clothing production across England, one of the most important industries in the early modern period (Clark, 2013, pp. 93–98, 144–150). One sphere of highly gendered work was women hired by the authorities in London for unskilled short term commitment jobs in the poor relief system in the 17th century as hospital keepers, matrons, nurses, wet-nurses, housekeepers, and as teachers of poor children. This was still official employment by local authorities, meaning that women served a public function. In cities, poor widows performed most of the common difficult low paying jobs. There were a disproportionate number of women amongst the poor, widows, and orphans making up the bulk of names on charity lists in the 17th and 18th centuries (Mendelson and Crawford, 1998, p. 179; Tilly and Scott, 1987, pp. 51–52; Willen, 1988, pp. 559–567).\n\nAccess of women to capital to set up and run a business, for the professional training needed and membership in livery companies, was necessary to carry out their trade and was not only a matter of class. All forms of women’s employment in the period were entangled with women’s marital status, which is crucial for understanding the differences among the various depictions that these token issuers selected to appear on their tokens.\n\nAmy Erickson (1993) demonstrated how employment of women was affected by their status as single, married, or widowed. This defined whether they could legally control their earnings. Under common law a married woman fell under the category ‘feme covert’ and as such lost almost all the private rights she had before marriage. This was based on the common law doctrine known as coverture which deemed husband and wife as one entity before the law. Women were not their own legal entity, as they were under marital authority and as such were under the same legal category as wards, lunatics, criminals, and idiots. They could not own property or enter binding contracts, making it impossible to run a business on their own accord. In contrast, single adult women were considered ‘feme sole’ enjoying most legal rights held by men, including owning property and inheriting many forms of property. Widowed women reverted back to a ‘feme sole’ upon the death of their husbands, regaining legal rights and liabilities lost when married, in many instances inheriting and administrating their husbands’ property, business, and estate.\n\nA third case scenario occurred when wives were recognized as a ‘feme sole’ for the purpose of carrying out their own trade, in which case they were allowed to own property and their husbands were not responsible for their debts. This was dependent on their husbands’ consent and contingent to local customary law. There are documented cases of married women in London being recognized as ‘feme sole’ for the purposes of trade, though it was not common (Erickson, 1993; Gowing, 2014, p. 42).\n\nThe number of women who were not married—widows, single women before marriage, and women who never married (known as ‘spinsters’)—was significant in the 17th century. It has been assessed that in the 1690s around half of all adult women across England were single at any given moment. In London this figure was likely higher (Froide, 2002). More particularly, it has been assessed that between 20% and 30% of adult women in England never married (Froide, 2005, pp. 2–3; Weir, 1984; Wrigley and Schofield, 1981, pp. 255–265). Which meant that they could be ‘feme soles’ for their entire life, owning property and working for wages belonging legally to themselves.\n\nFirstborn sons inherited real property (mainly land and real estate); the remainder of the inheritance was divided amongst the rest of the children (male or female). For some women this could mean significant capital (Erickson, 1993, pp. 61–78). Evidence for women with means can be found in women investors from the 1680s onwards. Thanks to their legal freedoms spinsters and widows were significant investors in the new financial mechanisms that began to appear in the early years of the financial revolution, though married women also found ways to invest in these financial mechanisms, despite their limitations. These new forms of investment had particular importance for widows and spinsters in preparation for retirement and increased their capital. Women investors played an important role in the financial revolution overall (Froide, 2017, pp. 1–29).\n\nWomen’s marital status also affected the type of membership they could have in a London livery company, which as explained above was a condition to trade in London. The London livery companies were weakening in the 17th century, their ability to govern trade during the civil war was damaged and they did not manage to regain their hold even after 1660. Yet they still were the main avenue for an individual to officially enter many high-status trades and crafts and operate in them independently, once freedom had been obtained. They controlled apprentices, the right to trade within London and were a source of political and social power (Berlin, 2008; Glass, 1969; Jenner, 2002, pp. 163–170). Women could be found as full members of livery companies under their own names; some examples include 20 women who were admitted into the freedom of The Carpenters Livery Company in the last two decades of the 17th century. Two late established companies, the Scriveners’ Company, founded in 1617, and the Company of Wheelwrights, founded in 1670, admitted women from the beginning (Laurence, 2013, pp. 127–128; Smith, 2015, p. 17). But their access to membership in the livery companies was not equal to men’s as they could not take part in the governance of the companies and were excluded from the political rights of male members in the City of London. Research has shown a nuanced picture of women’s involvement and opportunities within the companies, given these restrictions.\n\nThere were four ways to become members in the companies: apprenticeship, patrimony, marriage, and redemption (meaning purchase, an option available under very particular circumstances) (Erickson, 2011, p. 152). Formal apprenticeship was the standard means of training for a craft. In many cases only those who completed their apprenticeships, thereby gaining freedom from their company, could work in a particular trade. This could potentially lead to obtaining freedom within the company. Female apprentices were young single women who were bound to either a master or mistress who was a member of a livery company in order to obtain a trade. Female apprentices were predominantly from the middling, genteel, and artisanal classes, with access to the capital required to embark on apprenticeships and to set up in trade. These women used apprenticeships as a way to access a variety of trades including luxury trades, often related to textile, through a variety of companies (Birt, 2021; Gowing, 2016; on 18th century see Erickson, 2011; Collins, 2013). There were also female (and male) pauper apprentices; these were young girls whose apprenticeships were organized by parish overseers (Willen, 1988, pp. 565–566).\n\nBetween 1600 and 1800, only 1–2% of those apprenticed to any of the London livery companies were girls, but proportions varied enormously. Some trades had no girls while 44% of pin makers apprentices were girls (Craig, 2015, p. 19; Erickson, 2008, p. 287). However, Gowing (2016) demonstrated that a closer look at these figures shows that from the 1650s, the years tokens were being issued, there was a rise in the numbers of women apprenticing overall in the more elite trades. This could be due to familial disruption and dislocations due to the civil war that opened up new opportunities for women. Though percentages of female apprentices did not change significantly, absolute numbers show a shift in livery companies’ willingness to accept women. For example, 43 women were apprenticed in the 1650s to cloth workers, drapers, goldsmiths, mercers, and tallow chandlers. In the previous decade there were only four (Gowing, 2016, p. 453). Birt (2021), in her examination of the Merchant Taylors’ company between 1658 and 1688, has shown that women were apprenticing in the tailoring trades which researchers had previously thought were inaccessible to them in the period. Sixty-seven percent of female apprentices in the company were apprenticed to tailors, seamstresses, milliners, and coat makers. Thus, Elizabeth Mayne, who’s token is displayed above, was not extraordinary in her affiliation with the Merchant Taylors’ company. Though we don’t know how she gained her membership, Birt’s research makes it clear that women were involved in this company in multiple ways. Women were apprenticed in the 16th and 17th centuries in many other trades as well, such as carpenter, draper, mercer, capper, weaver, plumber, cordwainer, silversmith, baker, fringe-maker, sieve maker, housepainter, and pipe maker (Mendelson and Crawford, 1998, pp. 328–329).\n\nApprenticeship did not mean full membership in the companies for women or men. Only one in 10 women who apprenticed in the late 17th century completed their service and became free of their company, which enabled them to trade freely in London under their own name as long as they were single. Women who did complete apprenticeships sometimes did go on to train apprentices of their own (Gowing, 2016, p. 454). But even if a woman did not obtain freedom, she would have obtained skills to work for others.\n\nMost women who were actively involved in livery companies were, therefore, not apprenticed but became members through patrimony or marriage. Tracing what these married women did for work under the membership of the companies, in particular joint work within a family business, can be difficult as the nature of their membership meant that it was under their husbands’ names, making them hard to detect (Birt, 2021, p. 157; Erickson, 2008, p. 272). One indication of the type of involvement of women within family businesses comes indirectly from widows, who were the majority of women admitted as full members in the majority of livery companies. Widows of members could in many cases retain their husbands’ rights within the companies, continue his business, and gain access to benefits reserved for members, such as loans. Like all other women they could not participate in the governance of the companies or obtain wider civic rights. While some trades, like printing, allowed women to continue membership upon remarriage to a man of another occupation; other trades, like weaving, did not allow continuing membership upon remarriage. In some cases, upon remarriage the new husband became the master and craftsman (Bellavitis, 2018, p. 212; Gowing, 2014, p. 42; Tilly and Scott, 1987, pp. 51–52; Wayne, 2020, pp. 6–7). The number of widows fully operating as masters of trade was small. Yet, there are many examples of women who were masters of trade in the 17th century, sometimes running a business for several decades. It is likely that widows having taken up their husbands’ trades worked in the craft with their husband prior to their death, Widows are sometimes recorded taking female and male apprentices in their husbands’ old trade, which points to them working with their husband in that trade prior to their death. But these accounted for 2% of apprentices overall in the 17th century (Birt, 2021, pp. 148–160; Gowing, 2016, p. 453, 460; Mendelson and Crawford, 1998, pp. 327–330).\n\nBeyond just the ability to become members there is evidence that widows were part of livery culture. Wives of members and widows were routinely among the guests at company feasts in the 16th–18th centuries, though they were seated at side tables, and portraits of women as well as men hung in the livery halls (Smith, 2015, pp. 17–26).\n\nWomen could also become members of the livery companies while married under their husband’s name. Here too, evidence for their activity can be found in records of women who trained apprentices under the names of their husbands, though the cases that appear in the archive are likely a significant underrepresentation. Women married to members of a livery company could enroll apprentices as the wife of a freeman (Erickson, 2011). There is evidence of married women in London who apprenticed girls in seamstry and millinery under their husband’s name in a wide range of livery companies. Millinery was an important trade without a corresponding livery company, so anyone who practiced it was necessarily a member of another company (Gowing, 2016, p. 452).\n\nWhat characterized these married women’s work? Many married couples did work together in family businesses, in partnership, though not in legal equality. But this was not necessarily the case. Data on what married women did for work in London has not been compiled for the mid-17th century, but has been compiled for the late 17th and 18th centuries. Peter Earle (1989) studied occupations of married women between 1695–1725 based on records from the London church court. These women were from a variety of socio-economic statuses. He found that 60% of married women in his church court sample claimed that they financially maintained themselves partially or entirely. A third of the women claimed that they maintained themselves solely by their own labor. Earle found that around 75% of the married women could be found in what could be understood as typically female lines of work, in that they were related to work that women did in the home. These women could be found working for wages in professions related to clothing production and mending, selling food and victualing, nursing, etc. Close to 20% of the women were working in other professions, such as shop keeping and forms of service unrelated to what women did within the home. Earle estimated that only 10% of wives worked in the same trade as their husband, most of these were in the sectors of food and drink production, and sales.\n\nAmy Erickson (2008), expanded on Earl’s research by looking into sources that represent married women of a higher socio-economic status in the 18th century. These sources expose that almost all London wives worked. In the lower socio-economic levels, husbands and wives did not often share a line of work. In the middling levels, including wives of craft masters and professional men, up to half the couples worked in the same trade and women participated in jobs that demanded professional skill. It was more common amongst couples to work together in the textile and retail trades.\n\nIt is possible to hypothesize, based on what is known about married women’s work in early modern London, that many women who appear as a single initial on tokens were jointly working with their husband in his business or shop, which was legally under the husband’s name. There are several reasons to think this might be the case. First, based on the finding of Earle and Erickson we know that wives and husbands were working together in large numbers in particular in entrepreneurial businesses related to food and drinks and in textile and retail; these are all spheres highly represented by token issuers in London. Thus, there were definitely wives working with men who were token issuers. This was one of the realities in the marital economies in which husbands and wives shared all aspects of their economic life, often running the business from their homes (Erickson, 2008, p. 273). Yet, only one token in London mentions the full name of both a husband and wife: Will and Elizabeth North who were members of the Blacksmith livery company. The fact that there is only one such example shows that it was not an acceptable convention to mention wives by a full name. Second, the triad in which the initial of these women’s names appear, as explained above, was used as a common form signifying a couples’ ownership over property. The visual signification of property highlights the marriage by putting the wife’s initial next to her husband’s. The triad could be found on property that was relevant to the family as a unit, both husband and wife, such as silverware, furniture, wine bottles and even sometimes engraved on the exteriors of homes (Jefferies and Major, 2015; Watkins, 1958). It has been suggested that marriage in early modern England was viewed as an economic partnership founded on the bases of merging assets (Erickson, 2005). In that sense it is possible to view the triad as a symbol of that economic partnership. As shown above, almost 65% of the triads on tokens were accompanied with a full name of a male issuer, meaning these tokens were not issued by the couple together. But if these tokens were issued by men who worked with their wives, then it could provide a case study that will enable a better estimate of the number of married women working in the mid-17th century in trades under the licensing of livery companies. This would be an indication that about half of such shops, taverns, coffee shops, etc. were run by couples. More research into the history of the triad is necessary in order to conclude its social and legal meanings.\n\nWomen who fully identified themselves on the tokens as the issuers and owners of their businesses were likely working independently, unlike the women above. If they were working with their husband, it would be his name on the tokens and they might have appeared as a lone initial. Moreover, this indicates that these women were operating independently financially as proprietors of their own businesses and were likely single, widowed, or married women legally recognized as ‘feme sole’ for the purpose of trade.\n\nThe tokens themselves contain two elements that support this claim. The first are women issuers who have been identified as widows. Mary Woodfall herself was identified through research as a widow (Berry, 1978, p. 50), while two additional London tokens explicitly mention that the issuers were widows on the token itself. The first had her name inscribed simply as “Widow Thvrriton” and the second as “Widdow Matthew” adding only the initial of her first name “K”. This is also supported by women issuers outside of London, where 4 women identify as widows on the tokens (Dickinson, 2004).\n\nThe second indication of women issuers as legally independent are the initials that appear on many of the women issuers’ tokens. It is not possible to quantify how many women issuers chose to put their initials alone on the tokens, as this does not appear in the Dickinson catalog which mentions only triad initials. In addition to the tokens discussed above, with initials of the first and last name of women issuers without a mention of a husband’s initial, there are many other examples of digitized tokens in museum collections in which women’s initials appear alone on tokens that they themselves issued. This is a major difference between men’s and women’s tokens. While it does not necessarily prove these women were widowed or single, it is a clear indication that these women were involved in their trade or ran their business independently. There is the possibility that these were married women who were practicing a different trade from their husbands, as Earle and Erickson figures suggest happened often in the period. Yet, these women came from trades in which there were a higher percentage of married couples working together, but there is no element indicating marriage.\n\nThese female issuers were extraordinary compared to how other women are represented in the types of tokens they produced and how they used the medium of the token to represent themselves and their businesses. Their tokens are extraordinary in comparison to men’s not because of their style, in that sense they were quiet ordinary, but simply because of their gender. When looking at the actual work these female issuers were doing, they were not very different as compared with many other women who worked in the period and who traded under their husbands’ company memberships. In that sense both the female token issuers and the women working jointly with their husband token issuers under coverture were working on the high end of their trades, doing work that demanded skill, running shops and businesses from fixed locations, training apprentices, etc. This signifies that the women who were token issuers were ordinary in terms of the types of skills, resources, training, and social status of other women working under coverture. Many women took part in these commercial spheres dominated by the artisan and growing middle class (Birt, 2021; Collins, 2013; Erickson, 2011, 2018; Gowing, 2016; Hunt, 1996; Lemire, 1997; Phillips, 2006). What, probably, differentiated them was their ownership of their enterprises and independent memberships in the London companies.\n\nFor example, among women token issuers there were a variety of trades related to textiles, which is unsurprising given what it is known about women who apprenticed in these trades and who trained apprentices under their husbands’ names. These issuers include one shoemaker; one semster, meaning a sempster, a male or female seamstress; one weaver; three milliners, who were high-end fashionable dressmakers and dealers (Erickson, 2011); and one slop seller, who sold ready-made garments, particularly to the army or navy (Lemire, 1997, pp. 9–42). These were luxury tailoring trades. It makes sense that these women represented themselves with inscriptions and not with the arms of the livery companies they belonged to. Most of the trades above were not represented officially by a company. The three issuers’ who were milliners, Ann Kanes, Margeret Brookes, and Sarah Willcockes, are a prime example.\n\nWomen who worked in drinking establishments, known as the victualing trades, such as coffee shops and taverns, can be understood to be part of the growing number of women in the service industries described above, whether married, single, or widowed. The large number of women who were tavern and ale house keepers can be explained by the overall significance of these sectors within the tokens at large, as this sector represents a large number of tokens in London amongst male issuers as well. The three women who issued coffee house tokens are an interesting case study. Here too marital or legal status was likely to play a role. Historian Brian Cowan notes that coffee house keepers were likely the heads of households from the middling sort of society and included men, widows, and occasionally unmarried women. The costs of running a coffee house were more expensive than most victualers due to higher rent and cost of supplies. Though the returns of these establishments seem to be lower than the average in the sector (Cowan, 2008, pp. 80, 161–162). These three women were taking part in an emerging costly sector that was financially risky. But married women were also running coffee shops together with their husbands, as Earle identified in his survey (1989). Here too these issuers were different from other women in their legal ownership of their coffee shops and taverns, but not unique in the actual work that was being done. Other token issuers in the food related businesses and services include two women issuers who were keepers of meal shops and one token issuer who is represented on her token as a cheese monger."
