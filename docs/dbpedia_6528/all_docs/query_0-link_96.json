        "text": "Women in Islam versus Women in the Judeo-Christianity: The Myth & The Reality By Dr. Sherif Abdel Azeem. This essay by Sherif Abdel Azeem is a great work done by the author who realized through his research that Islam is free of all the fabrications that they claim to affect the position of women in Islam. He gave us a comparison of the position of women in Islam, Christianity & Judaism based on the Qur'an, Bible & Talmud respectively. The author said ‘’ Islam is believed to be the symbol of the subordination of women par excellence…………………. Do Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have the same conception of women? Are they different in their conceptions? Do Judaism and Christianity, truly, offer women a better treatment than Islam does? What is the Truth? It is not easy to search for and find answers to these difficult questions. The first difficulty is that one has to be fair and objective or, at least, do one's utmost to be so. This is what Islam teaches. The Quran has instructed Muslims to say the truth even if those who are very close to them do not like it: \"Whenever you speak, speak justly, even if a near relative is concerned\" (6:152) \"O you who believe stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even as against yourselves, or your parents or your kin, and whether it be (against) rich or poor\" (4:135). The other great difficulty is the overwhelming breadth of the subject. Therefore, during the last few years, I have spent many hours reading the Bible, The Encyclopaedia of Religion, and the Encyclopaedia Judaica searching for answers. I have also read several books discussing the position of women in different religions written by scholars, apologists, and critics. The material presented in the following chapters represents the important findings of this humble research. ..... END QUOTE [Women In Islam versus Judeo-Christianity: The Myth & The Reality By Dr. Sherif Abdel Azeem, Introduction, page 1-4] In Islam, Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said: \"The best believers are the best in conduct, and the best of you are those who are best to their wives.\" When Muhammad (pbuh) first became the prophet of Islam, the Pagans of Arabia had inherited a similar disregard for woman as had been passed down among their Jewish and Christian neighbors. So disgraceful was it considered among them to be blessed with a female child that they would go so far as to bury this baby alive in order to avoid the disgrace associated with female children. Through the teachings of Islam, Muhammad (pbuh) put a swift and resounding end to this evil practice. Not only did he severely discourage and condemn this act but he also used to teach them to respect and cherish their daughters and mothers as partners and sources of salvation for the men of their family: AbuSa'id al-Khudri narrated: \"The Prophet (pbuh) said: If anyone cares for three daughters, disciplines them, marries them, and does good by them, he will enter Paradise.\" (Narrated by Abu-Dawood) Abdullah the son of Abbas narrated: \"The Prophet (pbuh) said: If anyone has a female child, and does not bury her alive, or slight her, or prefer his male children over her, Allah will bring him into Paradise.\" (Narrated by Abu-Dawood) Muhammad (pbuh) is also sited in \"Sahih Muslim\" as saying: \"Whoever maintains two girls till they attain maturity, he and I will come on the Day of Resurrection like this; and he joined his fingers\". Husbands are commanded to treat their wives with kindness and respect. In Quran 4:19 we read \"..But consort with them in kindness, for if you hate them it may happen that you hate a thing wherein Allah has placed much good.\" The prophet told us that man’s treatment of his wife is a measure of the perfection of his faith: Abu Hurayra narrated that the Prophet said: “The most perfect of the believers in their belief are those with the best manners, and the best of you are those who are best with their wives.” [Riyadh as-Salihin, Chapter 34, Nr. 278, and see also: Ibn-Hanbal, No. 7396] Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah's Apostle (May peace be upon him) as saying: \"He who believes in Allah and the Hereafter, if he witnesses any matter he should talk in good terms about it or keep quiet. Act kindly towards woman, for woman is created from a rib, and the most crooked part of the rib is its top. If you attempt to straighten it, you will break it, and if you leave it, its crookedness will remain there. So act kindly towards women. (Translation of Sahih Muslim, The Book of Marriage (Kitab Al-Nikah), Book 008, Number 3468)\" Aisha reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “The best of you are the best to their families, and I am the best to my family. ….” (Sunan At-Tirmidhi 3895). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined kind treatment and honouring of one’s wife, and he described the best of people as those who are best to their wives. He said: “The best of you are those who are the best to their wives, and I am the best of you to my wives.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3895; Ibn Maajah, 1977; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. In fact the prophet described how Man should take care of his wife, the prophet used the phrase ''glass vessels'' in a hadith Narrated Anas bin Malik: ''The Prophet was on a journey and a slave named Anjasha was chanting (singing) for the camels to let them go fast (while driving). The Prophet said, \"O Anjasha, drive slowly (the camels) with the ''glass vessels!\" Abu Qilaba said, \"By the glass vessels' he meant the women (riding the camels).\"[Bukhari Volume 8, Book 73, Number 229]. See how kind and merciful our beloved prophet is towards women and humanity at large. He forbade the camel driver to slow down, so that it may not harm women. He described how we should treat them with care. He even used the phrase ''glass vessel''!!! You know how careful you will be when you are carrying glassy materials. The prophet told us that it is charity to feed your wife with your hand! The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) spoke beautiful word concerning kind treatment of one’s wife, stating that when the husband feeds his wife and puts a morsel of food in her mouth, he earns the reward of doing an act of charity. He said, “You never spend anything but you will be rewarded for it, even the morsel of food that you lift to your wife’s mouth.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6352; Muslim, 1628 On the other hand, In Christianity Women are considered as the Devil's gateway: Eve bit the apple and the world's been in trouble ever since. We read in the Bible : (1 Timothy 2:11-14) \"Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. For Adam was first formed, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.\" 1 Corinthians 14:34 \"Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law. And if they will learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.\" After reading this book you will realize the fact the Bible teaches us that: 1) Women should learn in silence and subjugation. 2) Women should not teach. 3) Women should not have authority over men but should remain silent. 4) Adam and Eve were not equal in sin. Adam was not deceived but Eve was. 5) Women are commanded to be under obedience to men. God ordained that men shall for all time rule over women. 6) Women must keep silent in Churches. It is shameful for them to open their mouths therein. If they have a question they should ask their husbands before going to church and then their husbands will ask for them in the church. 7) A woman should neither pray nor profess with her head uncovered. 8) If a woman prays with her head uncovered then she might as well shave her head. 9) Man was created in the image and glory of God, and Woman was created in the glory of Man, thus Man must have power over her. 10) Any woman who delivers a male baby shall be unclean for one week. But any woman who delivers a female baby shall be unclean for TWO weeks. Thus, females make their mothers DOUBLY unclean as compared to males. 11) While it is possible to find one upright man in every thousand, it is impossible to find even one single upright woman in every thousand 12) Woman is a snare, her heart is a trap, and her hands are chains. The man who pleases God will escape her, but she will ensnare the sinner. 13) If a woman had her period and touches a chair or a bed or anything else then that item immediately becomes unclean. Anyone who then touches those things shall also become unclean. They must then bathe themselves and wash their clothes because they have touched an item that a menstruous woman has touched."
