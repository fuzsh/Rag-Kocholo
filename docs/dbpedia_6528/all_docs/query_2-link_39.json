        "text": "“And therefore I am come amongst you at this time, not as for my recreation or sport, but being resolved, in the midst and heat of the battle, to live or die amongst you all; to lay down, for my God, and for my kingdom, and for my people, my honour and my blood, even the dust. I know I have but the body of a weak and feeble woman; but I have the heart of a king, and of a king of England, too.”\n\n― Queen Elizabeth I\n\n“I grieve and dare not show my discontent,\n\nI love and yet am forced to seem to hate,\n\nI do, yet dare not say I ever meant,\n\nI seem stark mute but inwardly do prate.\n\nI am and not, I freeze and yet am burned,\n\nSince from myself another self I turned.\n\nMy care is like my shadow in the sun,\n\nFollows me flying, flies when I pursue it,\n\nStands and lies by me, doth what I have done.”\n\n― Elizabeth I, Her Life in Letters\n\n“As for my own part I care not for death, for all men are mortal; and though I be a woman yet I have as good a courage answerable to my place as ever my father had. I am your anointed Queen. I will never be by violence constrained to do anything. I thank God I am indeed endowed with such qualities that if I were turned out of the realm in my petticoat I were able to live in any place in Christendom.”\n\n― Elizabeth I, Collected Works\n\n“(Response to King Erik XIV of Sweden's proposal of marriage:)\n\n\"[W]hile we perceive ... the zeal and love of your mind towards us is not diminished, yet in part we are grieved that we cannot gratify your Serene Highness with the same kind of affection. And that indeed does not happen because we doubt in any way of your love and honour, but, as often we have testified both in words and writing, that we have never yet conceived a feeling of that kind of affection towards anyone.\n\nWe therefore beg your Serene Highness again and again that you be pleased to set a limit to your love, that it advance not beyond the laws of friendship for the present nor disregard them in the future. ...\n\nWe certainly think that if God ever direct our hearts to consideration of marriage we shall never accept or choose any absent husband how powerful and wealthy a Prince soever. But that we are not to give you an answer until we have seen your person is so far from the thing itself that we never even considered such a thing. I have always given both to your brother ... and also to your ambassador likewise the same answer with scarcely any variation of the words, that we do not conceive in our heart to take a husband but highly commend this single life, and hope that your Serene Highness will no longer spend time in waiting for us.”\n\n― Elizabeth I, Collected Works"
