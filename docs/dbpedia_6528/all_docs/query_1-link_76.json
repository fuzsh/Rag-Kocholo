        "text": "Elizabeth was an intelligent, educated woman, especially for her time and gender. She learned to speak Latin, French, German, Hebrew, Greek, English, and Spanish. She also studied a variety of subjects that proved useful during her reign such as arithmetic, philosophy, theology, and rhetoric.\n\nShe was extremely witty and clever but Elizabeth was also famous for her temper, something she inherited from both her father and her mother, Anne Boleyn. She was a master at the art of appearing regal and stately to the public and her advisors."
