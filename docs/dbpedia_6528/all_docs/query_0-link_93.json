        "text": "In 1557, when the future Elizabeth I was just twenty-four, the Venetian ambassador Giovanni Michiel observed that she was ‘tall and well-formed, with a good skin […] and above all, a beautiful hand with which she makes display’. Like her late mother Anne Boleyn, Elizabeth could boast of long, slender fingers that she could showcase to foreign ambassadors, or dress in spectacular jewels and luxurious gloves.\n\nNearly until the end of her life and reign, Elizabeth’s hands remained a subject of great admiration. In an era where jewelry could symbolise both authority and prestige, Elizabeth understood the power of accessories, often used to enhance her favored attributes. She strategically used gloves to convey royal favour, allowing trusted courtiers to kiss her hand, and wore rings with special connections to her reign and, on occasion, her mother.\n\nA surviving glove from Elizabeth’s 1559 coronation not only provides us a glimpse into the opulence of her attire but also reveals the length and elegance of her hands — significantly longer than those worn by either Queen Victoria or Elizabeth II at their coronations. As queen, Elizabeth’s hand gained an air of mystique through the ‘royal touch,’ the practice of touching subjects afflicted by scrofula and healing them, a symbolic ritual that demonstrated her legitimacy as monarch.\n\nWe are delighted to be joined by Corina Apostu, an Elizabethan historian with an MA in Medieval and Early Modern Studies from the University of Kent, to discuss Elizabeth’s hands as both an aesthetic and political symbol.\n\nTo start, could you provide an introduction about yourself? What fascinated you about Elizabethan history that led you to pursue it in your Masters?\n\nHello! Thank you so much for having me! Whenever anyone asks me when I first became interested in Elizabeth I, I always say that I pretty much owe my entire academic career to Cate Blanchett. Because when I was a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed seventeen-year old, we were tasked to watch Elizabeth: The Golden Age in my high school World History class back in Canada. Our assignment was to focus on the Tilbury speech scene in particular. We watched the on-screen depiction and then were given copies of the historical speech and were asked to write a short essay on why we thought the director/scriptwriter made changes. I don’t remember what I wrote but I do remember staring, gobsmacked, as Cate Blanchett dominated the screen as Elizabeth, mounted on a horse, clad in armour and with red hair flying in the wind as she declared her commitment to protecting England. That day, I ran home and Googled all I possibly could on this remarkable woman. After that, my passion for Elizabethan England kicked off like a snowball rolling down a hill as I started reading more and more, becoming utterly fascinated with this queen and the society she lived in, one which stood on so many precipices with or without them knowing. Years later, I now have a much more critical opinion on The Golden Age but nevertheless, that movie still holds a special place in my heart for sparking my love for Elizabethan history. Any mental image I conjure up of Elizabeth I still looks somewhat like Cate!\n\nAfter this epiphany of sorts, I became determined to study history at university. Funnily enough though, I actually did a double major in History and Medieval Studies while at the University of Toronto, rather than Renaissance Studies. I felt like the Middle Ages were underexplored in my general education (we skipped the era entirely in school because we spent too much time on Ancient Rome and Greece and then had to fast-forward to the Renaissance to stay on track with the curriculum schedule – I’m still bitter about that!) and I wanted to achieve a better understanding of the era. I have no regrets about doing this because it gave me a very solid foundation I otherwise wouldn’t have, but I still found myself gravitating back towards the Renaissance and Elizabeth’s reign in particular. By the time I finished my Bachelors Degree in 2018, I had a year’s experience in London under my belt, a dogged determination to get back to the UK and to specialise my studies to the Tudor era for my Masters. One of my professors in Toronto at the time suggested the Medieval and Early Modern Studies programme at the University of Kent as she had once worked there and had only positive things to say about it. So, I threw caution to the wind, put all my eggs in one basket and applied. Luckily I was accepted and the rest – as they say – is history!\n\nElizabeth seemed particularly focused on her hands. Was this fixation, as some historians suggest, purely rooted in vanity?\n\nElizabeth’s vanity has become something of legend and at face-value, the fixation on her hands seems part of this, but as with everything when it comes to Elizabeth, the answer is not so simple. Firstly, this wasn’t a matter of Elizabeth being delusional – we have multiple sources mentioning the beauty or appearance of her hands all the way from her youth to nearly the end of her life. In 1557, when Elizabeth was about 24, the Venetian ambassador Giovanni Michiele said when describing her, “she has fine eyes and above all a beautiful hand of which she makes a display.” Then, all the way in 1598, when Elizabeth was 65, the German visitor Paul Hentzner noted that, “her hands were small, her fingers long.” Clearly it was an attribute of hers that was unique enough to cause notice. Elizabeth knew how to work with her best features so naturally, she made sure her hands were frequently in evidence and she must have taken very good care of them.\n\nCertainly she would have enjoyed the compliments but beautiful hands were often tied with youth – a young monarch was a healthy monarch and a healthy monarch was a strong monarch. As the years progressed and it became clear that Elizabeth would not marry or have children, anxiety over the succession and the peace of England after her death mounted. Upholding the idea of Elizabeth having almost unnatural youth and vigour would serve to quell some of the unease. Furthermore, the part of a monarch’s body that was touched by others the most on a regular basis was the hand. Subjects were expected to kiss the monarch’s hand when it was presented to them either when greeted or dismissed and thus the act of extending a hand visually strengthened bonds of fealty and/or favour. Hentzner helpfully gives an example of this too: “While we were there, W. Slawata, a Bohemian baron, had letters to present to her; and she, after pulling off her glove, gave him her right hand to kiss.” By removing her glove and offering her bare hand to kiss, she was showing marked favour and it sent a strong message to the court. Small wonder then, that Elizabeth emphasised the visibility of her hands.\n\nAs an aside, I do find it a bit funny that posterity judges Elizabeth so harshly for being “vain” coming from a society as image-obsessed as our own. We barely have a leg to stand on. There’s plenty of valid things to criticise Elizabeth for (and her self-absorption did occasionally stray into pettiness), but taking a liking to her own appearance should hardly be one of them. Especially as, as I’ve mentioned, much of it was tied to politics rather than mere frivolity.\n\nWhat might have typically graced Elizabeth’s hands? Was she fond of jewellery?\n\nInterestingly, if you take a look at Elizabeth’s portraits through the ages, she actually has less and less on her hands as she grew older! In her earlier portraits, her hands are adored with typical Tudor-Era rings. Gold bands with precious or semi-precious stones inset within. You can see an example in the famous William Scrots painting when Elizabeth is about thirteen years old. In this portrait, she has multiple rings on, and this is the same in many of the earliest paintings of her reign as well. But as her reign progresses her hands start to be depicted with fewer rings or more often than not, completely bare.\n\nThese portraits give the impression that what is on her hands is less important than what her hands are holding: a flower, a bible, a fan, the sieve, the rainbow, the globe. If this was a conscious choice on Elizabeth’s part, perhaps she wanted to emphasise both the natural beauty of her hands as well as the power they were capable of bestowing – both literally and figuratively when it came to the Royal Touch, but we’ll get to that in a bit. An important caveat here to add is that most of Elizabeth’s portraits were not commissioned by the Queen herself but rather by her closest courtiers. She would have had to approve of them, naturally, and later they had to work off an accepted pattern but there is still a degree of external projection upon Elizabeth’s image here. And though her hands may appear plainly adorned in portraits, in person she appeared to still wear rings when it suited her. The hand she gave to the aforementioned Bohemian baron to kiss was noted as being, “sparkling with rings and jewels.”\n\nElizabeth enjoyed wearing other forms of jewellery as well, including necklaces, bracelets, earrings, pendants, brooches and hair jewels. She wore these both for beauty’s sake and for the messages they could send across to the court and country without her having to open her mouth. She was particularly fond of pearls – both for their value as a status symbol (as they would have been extraordinarily expensive) and also for the fact that they were commonly associated with purity and chastity. Jewellry was also a common gift for courtiers to bestow upon their Queen when seeking her favour. She seemed to much prefer gifts of jewellery over impersonal purses of gold. Some could be quite extraordinary – Robert Dudley once gifted her what might have been one of the world’s first wristwatches! Moreover, the same Hentzner who commented on Elizabeth’s fingers in her sixties also noted that “she had in her ears two pearls, with very rich drops” as well as “a necklace of exceeding fine jewels.” If in Elizabeth’s youth, pre-queenship, she shirked ostentatious ornamentation to make a political and religious statement, she had done a complete volte-face on the matter once she became queen.\n\nFor further reading on jewellery available to English Queens, how it helped to shape their identities and in what context they were worn and used, I’d recommend Nicola Tallis’ latest book All the Queen’s Jewels. Her book doesn’t go as far as Elizabeth’s reign but it’s a wonderful overview of the topic regardless. For something more specific to Elizabeth, I can’t recommend Janet Arnold’s Queen Elizabeth’s Wardrobe Unlock’d enough! It covers both Elizabeth’s jewellery and her extensive clothing, examining symbolism, political contexts and challenging popular myths.\n\nOn the topic of jewellery, can you talk to us a bit about the famous ‘Chequers Rings’? Is the legend true that they were prised from her fingers at her death?\n\nThe Chequers Ring is one of my favourite pieces of jewellery ever. It’s a mother of pearl locket ring that belonged to Elizabeth with the initials ER set onto it with jewels, surrounded by gold and rubies, but its true treasure lies within. When opened, it reveals two impossibly small portraits. One is quite clearly of Elizabeth herself but the other is of a woman in a much earlier style of dress, complete with French hood. It is very likely that this might be a portrait of her mother, Anne Boleyn, however the paucity of provenance documentation makes it impossible to firmly confirm this. We can, though, make an educated guess.\n\nWe can safely infer that the ring did indeed belong to Elizabeth as James I gave it to the Earl of Home from whom’s family, centuries later Lord Arthur Lee would acquire it and keep it in his country house of Chequers. The only way James would have something like this would be upon inheriting Elizabeth’s personal jewellery collection when he became king. Though the ring does not appear to show up in Elizabeth’s inventories, it is so small it would only reasonably fit someone with very slender fingers – like Elizabeth (I’ve seen the ring in person at an exhibition in the British Library once, it is breath-takingly small). Due to the intensely personal nature of the ring, perhaps it is not shocking that Elizabeth did not want it showing up on the official inventory, much to the frustration of historians.\n\nI personally have never been convinced by the theories that the woman in the French hood is anyone other than Anne. The suggestion that the woman is Elizabeth when young is probably the weakest theory, in my opinion. Elizabeth was never one to relish being reminded of the passage of time and many of her earlier portraits were destroyed once she and her government started to tighten control on her image. Then there’s the suggestion that the woman might be Catherine Parr, Elizabeth’s last step-mother to whom she was closest. The argument for Catherine is threefold: that she and Elizabeth were close and Elizabeth wanted to remember her, that the phoenix on the back of the ring was a nod to the Seymours who Catherine married into and that the portrait resembles some of Catherine’s existing ones.\n\nIt’s true, Elizabeth and Catherine were exceptionally close but this is ignoring the highly disturbing event Elizabeth endured in Catherine’s care which was her harassment by Thomas Seymour, Catherine’s husband. This strained their relationship and Elizabeth was sent away soon before Catherine entered confinement for her pregnancy. Catherine and Elizabeth kept in touch and perhaps would have reconciled if it weren’t for Catherine’s tragic death soon after childbirth. Afterwards, Elizabeth was dragged into danger by Thomas’ political intrigues and his ambition to marry her. After he lost his head and the dust settled, Elizabeth never appears to honour or even mention Catherine from then on out (aside from favouring her brother, William Parr). It seems to me that Catherine was too painful a memory to think of anymore, no matter their prior closeness.\n\nThen there’s the phoenix on the back of the ring; the Seymours often used a phoenix in their family symbolism and this has been used to suggest that the ring was a gift to Elizabeth from Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, perhaps trying to get back in her good books after he angered her by marrying Katherine Grey without permission. As far as I know, there is no evidence to support this besides speculation and phoenix imagery was not exclusive to the Seymours. Elizabeth herself used it extensively, both in portraits and in jewellery, as a symbol of rebirth, resilience and glory arising from the ashes. Not to mention, on multiple occasions the Seymours ruined – or nearly ruined – Elizabeth’s life. I sincerely doubt she would ever want to wear jewellery privately celebrating them.\n\nAs for the woman in the portrait looking like Catherine Parr, this is entirely subjective. I do agree that it bears a marked resemblance to this portrait of Catherine but it could just as easily be based off this portrait of Anne. There is the fact that the woman in the ring portrait appears to have the same light-coloured hair as Elizabeth and this is arguably the biggest difficulty in associating this portrait with Anne who was said to have dark hair. However, apparently upon close inspection of the ring, there may be evidence of darker enamel on the woman’s hair that has since faded or chipped off with time which may account for that. Alternatively, whoever made the ring may have just simply assumed that the Queen’s mother had the same hair as her if they had never seen Anne Boleyn in person or a portrait of her (which were not terribly common, thanks to Henry VIII). For me personally, Anne seems the most likely candidate for the identity of the ring portrait. If you would like to read some more on both sides of the argument, Tracy Borman has examined the possibility of the woman in the ring being Anne in her book Elizabeth & Anne: The Mother and Daughter Who Changed History whereas Susan E. James has written extensively on Catherine Parr and argues for it being her. Read both sides and form your own opinion!\n\nApparently, the ring has also been tentatively dated to around 1572-1575 which strengthens the possibility of the portrait being Anne since, coincidentally, 1575 is the same year that Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, threw his grand, three-week entertainment event at Kenilworth Castle for Elizabeth’s visit. The festivities positively dripped with matrimonial allegory – either this was Leicester’s final attempt at getting her to marry him or he was trying to convince her to let him marry someone else. Either way, this would be the perfect setting for Leicester to give a ring this intensely meaningful to his Queen. This was explored in the notes of Mary Hill Cole’s essay, “Maternal Memory: Elizabeth Tudor’s Anne Boleyn.” Leicester had a unique intimacy with Elizabeth and would have undoubtedly known what the memory of her mother meant to her. He certainly had the money for it and he was no stranger to giving Elizabeth gifts that required an artisan with an extraordinary amount of talent to work on such a small item with such detail – remember the wristwatch? Imagine how tiny that working clock must have been! Ultimately, this requires just as much speculation as the idea of Hertford gifting the ring to Elizabeth (since, again, the ring does not show up in any inventories and not all household accounts are extant), but, in my opinion, the puzzle pieces fit a bit better with Leicester.\n\nFinally, there seem to be a few different stories about which ring was allegedly taken off of Elizabeth’s finger to be delivered to James and the manner in which it was removed. In her biography of the Queen, Alison Weir describes it as a mere “sapphire ring” but does not provide a direct source to support this. Only since its rediscovery in 2002 has the Chequers’ Ring been posited as the removed ring as it was apparently gifted to the Earl of Home by James I soon after his accession. It is through the Home family that Lord Arthur Lee received the ring in the 19th century where he henceforth kept it at his country house of Chequers. The legend also differs, depending on who is telling it, as to whether the ring was removed easily or had to be sawn off because Elizabeth’s fingers had swollen. Nevertheless, there does not seem to be a clear or reliable source for this story at all. It is far more likely that the ring came into James’ possession by normal right of inheritance to the monarch’s jewels and he and his Queen Consort dispersed them widely.\n\nGiven her pride in her hands, did Elizabeth partake in the tradition of the ‘Royal Touch’? What would that have entailed for a 16th century female monarch?\n\nShe did indeed! There was a lot of mystique and a sense of almost godly power associated with the bare touch of a monarch’s hand. They were God’s anointed, therefore they had the power to cure illnesses that other mere mortals could not. Specifically, the Royal Touch was used to cure the King’s Evil otherwise known as scrofula or struma. The monarch would pray intensely beforehand for God to grant them the power to cure this disease and then go amongst the afflicted and touch their sores, swellings or just the person in general to command them to be healed. It was a very spiritual interaction between monarch and subject and one of the few times when the common person could ever expect to be physically touched by their sovereign – the other time being Maundy Thursday in which the monarch would wash the feet of a number of poor people to emulate Jesus Christ.\n\nFor her part, Elizabeth took her role as bestower of the Royal Touch incredibly seriously. Historically, Elizabeth has been known more for her pragmatism than her piety but we should not fall into the trap of believing that she was one particularly rigorous discussion away from being an atheist. Elizabeth was deeply religious but she considered her personal faith to be a private matter between her and God rather than something she would wear on her sleeve. Nevertheless, when she took part in religious services she deemed spiritually important, she put her heart and soul into it. Her chaplain William Tooker once described the process of Elizabeth preparing and dispensing the Royal Touch:\n\n“How often have I seen her most serene Majesty, prostrate on her knees, body and soul rapt in prayer … how often have I seen her with her exquisite hands, whiter than whitest snow, boldly and without disgust, pressing their sores and ulcers, and handling them to health … how often have I seen her worn with fatigue, as when in one single day, she healed eight and thirty persons of the struma” – source retrieved from Carole Levin, “Would I Could Give You Help and Succour”: Elizabeth I and the Politics of Touch\n\nHere as well we have another person emphasising the appearance of her hands, further linking their beauty to the strength and potency of her divine ability to heal. Naturally, this show of supposedly miraculous healing by the Queen was great for her PR as well but Carole Levin further shows in her thesis that Elizabeth did not only touch because it was politically useful for her image; when Elizabeth felt that it would be spiritually unsafe for her to use her healing touch (for example while menstruating which was still considered an ‘unclean’ time of a woman’s life), she refused to do so, telling her subjects, “Would that I could give you help and succour. God, God is the best and greatest physician of all-you must pray to him.” This, in essence, is the main difference between the way a female sovereign would touch the diseased versus a male one. Kings could touch in fixed seasons whereas Queens had to work around their bodily cycle – and Elizabeth’s menstrual cycle in particular was said to be irregular.\n\nElizabeth wore a pair of gloves at her coronation that have miraculously survived to the present day. Where are they now, and what can they tell us about the Virgin Queen?\n\nI’m actually not sure where the glove is currently held. The last time it was on display was in 2019 for a year-long exhibition at the Fashion Museum in Bath. Obviously, the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic caused nation-wide lockdowns in the United Kingdom almost immediately after this exhibition would have ended so I’m not sure if the Fashion Museum kept the glove in their collection or if it was sent elsewhere. I suppose one would have to contact them directly to ask about it! May have to put that on my to-do list.\n\nIn terms of what Elizabeth’s gloves say about her and her imagery, I would say they are a quite straightforward article of clothing. Gloves were an expected part of a monarch’s coronation outfit. Their sumptuous materials and painstaking design are an obvious nod to Elizabeth’s wealth and status and the small pearls that were sewn into the embroidery likely were meant to convey purity and chastity, as mentioned above. The embroidery itself appears to take the form of flowers and fruits, although the shape of them almost calls to mind the orb and sceptre that she would hold when being crowned.\n\nAt the beginning of her reign, Elizabeth was still working out what her image would be. The consistent symbolism and imagery associated with The Virgin Queen would not be perfected until decades later, long after her last marriage prospect was laid to rest. Until then, she had to appear strong, decisive but also fertile and marriageable, despite the fact that she had no inclination to actually go through with a marriage. When the question of who to marry reached crisis point in the 1560s, the symbolism became more overt. The Hampden Portrait is a good example of this.\n\nIn this portrait, Elizabeth appears in a rich, crimson gown. Red was associated with love and passion and the rose pinned to her shoulder was also another common love motif. She also holds a carnation in her right hand, commonly associated with marriage. Behind her grows a diverse array of ripe fruit, hinting towards her fertility. This sort of portrait may have been used to send to potential suitors overseas to entice them into a marriage negotiation. Notice also that except for one plain ring on her pinky, her hands are unadorned! More emphasis is placed on what she’s holding – the carnation in one hand and a glove in the other. If my interpretation of the design on Elizabeth’s coronation gloves is correct then they too share the fruits and flowers motif, thereby tying into the early Elizabethan focus on marital diplomacy rather than the semi-divine Virgin Queen of later decades.\n\nFinally, can you tell us a bit about how they differ from the gloves worn by her namesake, Elizabeth II, at her coronation? The difference in finger length is astonishing!\n\nWell, as you say, the most obvious difference at first glance is the finger length! If anyone thought contemporaries remarking on the elegant length of Elizabeth’s fingers were just exaggerating or flattering, they need only look at the gloves to be proven wrong. Granted, the seams of the fingers go down further on the hand than where the natural connection to the palm is (some modern gloves do this too), giving the impression that they were even longer than they actually were. But even taking that into account, it is clear that Elizabeth I’s fingers were very long and also very narrow. As with all the British monarchs, her gloves would have been custom made to fit her measurements exactly. To economise, her coronation dress was the same one that her sister Mary I wore for her own ceremony, just tailored to fit Elizabeth’s body, but there’s a good chance the gloves were new.\n\nAs for differences between the coronation gloves of the two Queen Elizabeths, I think what’s actually more remarkable is how similar they are! The only real difference, aside from finger length, is that Elizabeth II has her regnal monogram on her glove and Elizabeth I doesn’t. Other than that, the embroidered decoration is in the exact same area with a similar (though not identical) design. Elizabeth I also has fringed edges whereas Elizabeth II’s edges are woven tight to the fabric. Though faded now, the embroidery on Elizabeth I’s gloves were likely to have been just as bright gold as Elizabeth II’s when they were first created. Despite this, the parallel is striking, even more so when you compare them to a replica of Queen Victoria’s coronation gloves which look rather different. One wonders if, perhaps, Queen Elizabeth II wished to harken back to her royal namesake, to usher in the second Elizabethan Age. Consistency of imagery and royal grandeur has always been important for the British Monarchy.\n\nMy sincere thanks to Corina Apostu for her comprehensive, thought-provoking answers!\n\nYou can find Corina on Twitter and her own blog, Exploring Elizabethan History!"
