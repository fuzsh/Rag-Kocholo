        "text": "[[p. 12]] [1642] My wife now growing bigge & ill, my mother [in law] came from Olny to us upon a Tuesday […] April : 12 : after sermon, having waited upon God in his house, my wife called her women and God was mercifull to mee in my house, giving her a safe deliverance, & a daughter which on Thursday April : 14 was baptized by the name of Mary, Mr Rich : Harlakenden, Mr John Litle, Mrs Mary Mildmay & my wives mother being witnesses. I entertayned my neighbors all about; it cost me 6l. & 13s. 4d. at least : they showed much love to mee from all parts : God blessed my wife to bee a nurse [Was able to breastfeed the baby], and our child thrived, and was even then a pleasant comfort to us : God wash it from its corruption & sanctify it and make it his owne […]\n\n[[p. 65]] [May 5 1649] My deare wife had beene very ill for 3 weekes, now towards night paynes [pains] came fast on her and shee was delivered before nine of the clocke of her 5t [fifth] child, and third sonne, God giving us another sonne in stead of my deare Ralph whom he tooke away ; my wife was alone a great while with our good freinds Mrs Mary, and her mother ; some few women were with her, but the midwife not, but when God commands deliverance yr [there] is nothing hinders it.\n\n[[p. 144]] [Nov 26 1664] On Thursday morning about seven of the clocke or before, my deare wife after many sad pains, and sadder feares, in respect of the unkindlines of her labor, was yett through Gods mercy, delivered of her 10th child, sixt daughter, and or [our] now seventh child and 5t daughter living, for wrh [which] mercy my soule blesseth him.\n\nMr. Francis Watkins was married after the wars in England. He was heir to his father’s lands, and also to his art of good husbandry, in which his care, diligence, and skill, was not exceeded by any in this county. He marled [fertilised] several pieces, and got abundance of corn. He purchased lands in Tylley Park, and certainly, if he had lived, he had been an exceeding rich man. His wife was provident and sparing, even to a fault; and, therefore, he could not keep so good a house as his father did, which was no small trouble to him. He died and left five small children behind him; viz three sons and two daughters. His widow afterwards married with Mr. Charles Dimock, a younger brother of that ancient family, of the Dimocks of Willeton. He had no knowledge in husbandry, and his whole delight was in drinking; not as some drunkards plead, for company’s sake, but for the sake of drink. He lived but few years with her before he died. She had no child by him, and she got nothing, but rather lost by this marriage. She married a third husband, his name was John Cotton, an ancient bachelor. He was son and heir of Richard Cotton, of Haston. She got well by this marriage, which was helpful to her children. She had no child by him, and he died before her. She was much to be commended for giving her children good education, and put every one of them in a good condition to live. Mary, the youngest daughter, was married to Mr. Roe, of Preece. He was a fair and good-humoured man. He died and left her a widow, and now she is married again, but I know not what his name is. Elizabeth, the eldest, was married to John Joyce, who lives at the lodge in Kenwicke Park. John, the youngest son, was set apprentice to a grocer or merchant in Bristol, and was set up but broke; and, [[p. 53]] after receiving a small supply from his mother, he set up at Wolverhampton, and there married, and after grew melancholy and died. Francis the second son, was a grocer in Shrewsbury, and was set up in a good condition. He married a daughter of Mr. Collins Woolrich, an apothecary, and one of the senior aldermen of Shrewsbury, and had a good fortune with her; but he (trusting out goods too rashly) broke. William, the eldest son, was put a covenanted servant unto Mr. John Edwards, one of the ablest attorneys at law in this county. At expiration of his term, he married Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Mr. John Edwards.\n\nThis Mr. William Watkins is now (1701) owner of this farm, and very happy in that it hath pleased God to give him such skill, care, and industry in good husbandry as his grandfather and father had, for he is not inferior to either of them therein. He is also happy in a prudent, provident and discreet wife who is every way suitable for such a husband. They live very lovingly together, very loving to their neighbours, and very well beloved by their neighbours, and they are both happy in that it hath pleased God in token of his love to them, and their mutual love one to another to bless them with many comely and witty children."
