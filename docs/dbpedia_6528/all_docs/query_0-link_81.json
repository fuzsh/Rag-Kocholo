        "text": "Today I want to bring you A Lady in London’s list of famous British women throughout history. From great British women to inspiring women, my list spans both time and topic. I hope it gives you a better understanding of how certain females have impacted the UK over the centuries, as well as an appreciation for their achievements.\n\nFamous British Women\n\nFrom long-reigning monarchs to members of parliament, women have contributed to Britain’s history in significant ways. Their impact has been wide-ranging, and they’ve made waves in the realms of science, literature, art, politics, and more.\n\nSome have enjoyed enduring popularity throughout the centuries, while others have gained notoriety among the ranks of famous British women. Whatever their lasting legacy, these individuals have made their mark.\n\n1. Queen Elizabeth I (1533 to 1603)\n\nI’ll start my list of famous British women with Queen Elizabeth I. Not only was she one of England’s most notable female monarchs, but also one of its greatest rulers.\n\nThe daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, Queen Elizabeth I reinstated Protestantism in England, defeated the Spanish Armada in 1588, and forged a strong nation that persists today.\n\n2. Dido Elizabeth Belle (1761 to 1804)\n\nNext on my list of famous British women is Dido Elizabeth Belle, a British heiress and member of the Lindsay family.\n\nThe daughter of Maria Belle, an African slave in the British West Indies, and Sir John Lindsay, a British naval officer, she was raised in England by her father’s relatives.\n\nDido lived in Kenwood House, a stately home in London’s Hampstead, and was an amanuensis for her great-uncle, Lord Mansfield. She later married and had children.\n\nDido has been the subject of a number of books, movies, and theater productions, including the 2013 feature film, Belle, starring Gugu Mbatha-Raw.\n\n3. Jane Austen (1775 to 1817)\n\nNo list of famous British women would be complete without Jane Austen. She’s one of the greatest English novelists of all time, after all.\n\nAusten is best known for her six major novels, including Pride and Prejudice. Her interpretation and critique of the British landed gentry in the late 18th and early 19th centuries were done with humor, wit, and satire.\n\nBorn in Steventon, Austen lived everywhere from Bath to Hampshire before being laid to rest in Winchester Cathedral. Her house in Chawton is now a museum, and it’s one of the best Jane Austen locations in England.\n\n4. Mary Seacole (1805 to 1881)\n\nNext on my list of famous British women is Mary Seacole. A Jamaican-born nurse and entrepreneur, she cared for the sick throughout the world. From Panama to The Bahamas, she gained a wealth of experience in medical care throughout her career.\n\nLater Seacole set up the British Hotel, which sold food, supplies, and medicines to the troops during the Crimean War. She tended to the battlefield wounded there as well. There’s now a statue of her at St Thomas’ Hospital in London.\n\n5. Ada Lovelace (1815 to 1852)\n\nAda Lovelace is the next famous British woman on my list. She was a 19th-century English mathematician and writer.\n\nLovelace was known for her work on Charles Babbage’s proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, for which she created a program. Lovelace has been referred to as the first computer programmer.\n\nThere’s a blue plaque dedicated to Ada Lovelace at her former residence at 12 St James’s Square in London.\n\n6. Queen Victoria (1819 to 1901)\n\nQueen Victoria is next on my list of famous British women. One of the longest-reigning monarchs in British history, she was also one of its most powerful.\n\nHer government’s imperialist policies established Britain as the world’s most powerful nation, and she became a symbol of the empire.\n\nWhile her imperial policies are now regarded by many as controversial, Victoria is commemorated in everything from a sponge cake to a London Underground line.\n\n7. Florence Nightingale (1820 to 1910)\n\nFlorence Nightingale was one of the most famous British women in the medical field. She was a prominent English social reformer and statistician who’s best remembered for being the founder of modern nursing.\n\nNightingale’s work as a nurse manager and trainer during the Crimean War brought her fame. She pioneered the concept of hygiene and sanitation in hospitals, wrote 150 works on health-related topics, and created an early version of the pie chart.\n\nThe Florence Nightingale Museum in St Thomas’ Hospital is one of the best small museums in London. It’s a great place to learn about her life, work, and legacy.\n\n8. Millicent Garrett Fawcett (1847 to 1929)\n\nNext on my list of famous British women is Millicent Garrett Fawcett. An English politician, feminist, and writer, she campaigned for women’s suffrage and helped earn women the right to vote.\n\nFrom 1897 to 1919, she was president of the National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies, the UK’s biggest women’s rights association. There’s now a statue of her in Parliament Square in London.\n\nMillicent Garrett Fawcett was also a founder of Newnham College in Cambridge, one of the first university colleges for women in England.\n\n9. Nancy Astor (1879 to 1964)\n\nNext on my list of famous British women is Nancy Astor. An American-born British politician, she was the first woman to be seated as a Member of Parliament.\n\nAstor served from 1919 to 1945, campaigning for women’s rights and other causes. She also ran a hospital for soldiers during World War I and World War II.\n\nThere’s a blue plaque dedicated to her at 4 St James’s Square in London.\n\n10. Agatha Christie (1890 to 1976)\n\nThe best-selling novelist of all time, Agatha Christie deserves a place on my list of famous British women. Outsold only by the Bible and Shakespeare, Christie is one of the most legendary writers in the Western world.\n\nDuring the course of her career, Agatha Christie penned 66 detective novels and 14 collections of short stories. She also created legendary characters like Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple.\n\nThere’s a blue plaque dedicated to Christie at 58 Sheffield Terrace in Holland Park, London. She lived there from 1934 to 1941.\n\n11. Rosalind Franklin (1920 to 1958)\n\nNext on my list of famous British women is Rosalind Franklin. She was an English chemist and X-ray crystallographer. Franklin’s work was pivotal to the comprehension of the molecular structures of DNA, RNA, viruses, coal, and graphite.\n\nRosalind Franklin discovered the density of DNA and confirmed the helical conformation of the molecule. Her work paved the way for that of James Watson and Francis Crick.\n\nThere’s a blue plaque dedicated to her at Donovan Court, 107 Drayton Gardens in Chelsea, London.\n\n12. Margaret Thatcher (1925 to 2013)\n\nNext on my list of famous British women is Margaret Thatcher. A controversial figure, she was the first female Prime Minister in the UK and the longest-serving British prime minister in the 20th century.\n\nKnown as the “Iron Lady”, Thatcher’s political legacy is best remembered for her efforts to privatize large parts of the British economy.\n\n13. Queen Elizabeth II (1926 to 2022)\n\nNo list of famous British women would be complete without a mention of Queen Elizabeth II. The longest-reigning monarch in British history, she was also one of the most beloved figures in the United Kingdom.\n\nAcceding to the crown at the age of 25, Queen Elizabeth’s reign endured everything from global conflicts to domestic economic crises. She proved popular throughout.\n\n14. Julie Andrews (1935 to present)\n\nIt was hard to choose just one actress for my list of famous British women. With such a depth of talent, I could write a whole list on that subject alone. But given I was named after Julie Andrews, I couldn’t help choosing her.\n\nBest known for musicals like My Fair Lady and films like Mary Poppins and The Sound of Music, her career has spanned decades.\n\nIn more recent years her popularity has endured with movies like The Princess Diaries and TV shows like Bridgerton.\n\nAndrews has won an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award, two Primetime Emmy Awards, three Grammy Awards, and six Golden Globe Awards.\n\n15. Princess Diana (1961 to 1997)\n\nDiana, Princess of Wales is next on my list of famous British women. Nicknamed “The People’s Princess”, she was the first wife of Charles, Prince of Wales, and the mother of Prince William and Prince Harry.\n\nBorn in 1961, she was the first Englishwoman in 300 years to marry an heir to the throne. She was actively involved in official duties of the Royal Family and was particularly known for her charity work.\n\nPrincess Diana died in a tragic car crash in 1997, but her memory has lived on in the hearts of both the British public and the wider world.\n\n16. Zadie Smith (1975 to present)\n\nNext on my list of famous British women is Zadie Smith. An English novelist, essayist, and short-story writer, she came to fame in 2000 when her debut novel, White Teeth, was published.\n\nSmith is equally well-known for her treatment of race, religion, and culture, and for her character development and humor.\n\nA tenured Creative Writing professor at New York University, she’s won numerous awards for her writing and continues to publish acclaimed works today.\n\n17. Caroline Criado-Perez (1984 to present)\n\nThe youngest person on my list of famous British women is Caroline Criado-Perez. A Brazilian-born British feminist author, journalist, activist, and campaigner, she’s best known for her efforts to promote women’s rights and equality.\n\nCriado-Perez was responsible for the campaign to oppose the removal of a female face (besides Queen Elizabeth II’s) on the British currency, and to get a statue of a woman installed in Parliament Square. She succeeded in both.\n\nHer book Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men has been a bestseller, and she continues to be a leading figure in the feminist movement.\n\nFamous British Women\n\nI hope you’ve enjoyed reading this list of famous British women, and that you’ve found inspiration in it.
