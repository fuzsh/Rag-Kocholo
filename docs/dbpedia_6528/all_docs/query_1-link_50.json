        "text": "Elizabeth I’s Early Years and Siblings\n\nElizabeth I was born at Greenwich Palace on 7 September 1533 to King Henry VIII and his second wife, Anne Boleyn. She got her name from her grandmothers, Elizabeth of York and Elizabeth Howard.\n\nSince Henry divorced his first wife, Katherine of Aragon, Elizabeth’s half-sister Mary became illegitimate. As a result, Elizabeth became heir presumptive at birth, which meant she would inherit the throne unless an heir apparent were born. The heir apparent was usually a boy who was first in the line to the throne and could not be replaced unless he died.\n\nHeir presumptive\n\nAn heir (someone legally entitled to inherit a position, in this case, the throne) whose right could be defeated\n\nHeir apparent\n\nAn heir whose right the birth of another heir could not defeat\n\nElizabeth did not remain heir for long. On 19 May 1536, Anne Boleyn was beheaded, and Elizabeth became illegitimate with the end of her marriage to Henry VIII. In 1537, her half-brother Edward was born to Henry VIII’s third wife, Jane Seymour, and he became heir apparent.\n\nElizabeth’s education\n\nElizabeth received a good education in English, Latin, Italian, French, Greek and music. When her formal education ended in 1550, Elizabeth was considered one of the best-educated women of her generation.\n\nDid you know?\n\nElizabeth translated many works from Latin and Greek into English throughout her life.\n\nElizabeth I Portraits\n\nLet us take a look at some of the portraits of Elizabeth I\n\nWhen Henry VIII died in 1547, Edward VI became King at the age of nine. What happened to Elizabeth at this point?\n\nShe lived with her stepmother Katherine Parr, who married Thomas Seymour.\n\nSeymour acted flirtatiously with Princess Elizabeth, who was fourteen at the time, and this inappropriate behaviour eventually led to Elizabeth being sent away.\n\nThomas Seymour was incredibly jealous of his brother Edward, who was made King Edward VI’s Lord Protector.\n\nHe was arrested for treason and accused of plotting to marry Elizabeth to rule the kingdom after the death of Katherine Parr. Elizabeth was cleared of all charges, but Thomas Seymour was not so lucky and was beheaded.\n\nLord Protector\n\nThe person who ruled on behalf of a monarch when they were unable, in this case, due to age\n\nDid you know?\n\nThomas and Edward Seymour were the brothers of Jane Seymour, Henry VIII’s third wife.\n\nEdward VI died in 1553, aged 15 and named his cousin Lady Jane Grey as his successor. She only ruled as Queen for nine days before she gave up the throne to Mary I. Mary and Elizabeth were close for a time, but this changed as Mary was a devout Catholic and Elizabeth a Protestant.\n\nWyatt’s Rebellion\n\nWyatt’s Rebellion was a popular uprising in 1544, arising from concern over Queen Mary I’s decision to marry Philip of Spain, a foreigner.\n\nThe rebels wanted to dethrone Mary and replace her with Elizabeth. Although Thomas Wyatt proclaimed her innocence when he was captured, Elizabeth was imprisoned, and Mary placed her under house arrest.\n\nMary I died on 17 November 1558, and Elizabeth became Queen at age 25.\n\nElizabeth’s reign was eventful and saw a lot of change in England. She tackled the issue of religion, oversaw an era of global exploration and trade, and faced threats from Mary Queen of Scots and the Spanish Armada.\n\nUpon becoming Queen, Elizabeth immediately began to form her government. She reduced the size of the Privy Council considerably, partly to get rid of the Catholic members and partly to make it more efficient.\n\nPrivy Council\n\nA body of advisors to the monarch\n\nElizabeth I and the marriage question\n\nElizabeth I never married or had any children, hence her nickname ‘The Virgin Queen’. It is a mystery why she never got married as she had plenty of suitors, but one theory is that she wanted to protect England’s security. She wanted to stay independent of any foreign influence by marrying a foreign prince.\n\nQueen Elizabeth I and Religion\n\nEver since Elizabeth’s father, Henry VIII had left the Catholic Church in 1534 and founded the Church of England, religion began to cause many problems in England with a divide between Catholics and protestants. The religious policies of her siblings had intensified this turmoil, especially as Mary I reversed the country’s religious policy, prosecuting protestants and reviving Catholicism.\n\nElizabeth aimed to end this religious upheaval through what is known as the Elizabethan Religious Settlement – a collective name for the policies she passed on the issue of religion. Let’s look at some of the critical elements of the Religious Settlement below.\n\nThe 1559 Act of Supremacy made Elizabeth Supreme Governor of the Church of England – those who worked in the church had to take an oath of supremacy. It prohibited any foreign leadership of the church, and not recognising Elizabeth as Supreme Governor was treason.\n\nThe 1559 Act of Uniformity laid the foundations of Elizabethan church services. Everyone was expected to attend Anglican services once a week or be fined one shilling, equivalent to three days of wages.\n\nThe Act of Uniformity restored Edward VI’s 1552 Book of Common Prayer but with a few revisions to appease Catholics, such as removing a prayer against the Pope.\n\nThe 1559 Royal Injunctions Act reinforced the Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity, banning ‘superstition’ from religious services and requiring clergymen to report recusants – those who refused to attend church services.\n\nThe Thirty-Nine Articles of 1563, finalised in 1571, laid down the doctrines of the Church of England. They were quite ambiguous to allow for people of different Christian faiths but were against many aspects of Catholicism.\n\nNotably, Elizabeth became Supreme Governor of the Church rather than Supreme Head of the Church, which is the title Henry VIII had held. Reasons for this difference in the title include the fact that Elizabeth was a woman so people felt she could not be the ‘head’ of the church. It also reflects the idea that the head of the church should be Jesus rather than the monarch.\n\nSo, was the Religious Settlement a success?\n\nSuccessesFailuresMost of the clergymen took the Oath of Supremacy. Out of around 9000 priests, only about 250 refused. Those that refused lost their jobs, meaning they provided less significant opposition to Elizabeth.In 1570, the Pope excommunicated Elizabeth, which meant she was completely expelled from the Catholic Church. Her people were no longer required to be loyal to her, which could have led to a major Catholic uprising in England. After this point, Elizabeth did face more Catholic plots, but many Catholics were happy to continue practising their religion in private.Some elements of Catholicism were allowed, such as limited church decoration, choral music, and colourful robes. A Latin edition of the prayer book was also printed as well as the English version, as Catholic services had traditionally been in Latin.Elizabeth I did face Catholic plots during her reign, which aimed to remove her from the throne and replace her with the Catholic Mary Queen of Scots. We will look more in detail at this in the next section.Elizabeth I was fairly tolerant of Catholicism, as shown in the ambiguity of her religious settlement. As long as people seemed to be obeying the settlement, she was happy to turn a blind eye as she disliked extremism.Although Elizabeth was fairly tolerant, she still executed Catholics during her reign in response to the attempted uprisings she faced.\n\nQueen Elizabeth I and Foreign Policy\n\nThe Elizabethan era saw a shift in the way England interacted with the world concerning trade and exploration.\n\nTrade in the Elizabethan Era\n\nUntil the 15th century, luxury goods such as spices and silk were transported from China to England via land routes. Things changed when long(er) sea journeys became possible in the 15th century. Elizabethan adventurers changed English trade enormously as they discovered sea routes that opened up new markets.\n\nThus, four new trading companies emerged:\n\nYear foundedCompany nameTrading1555The Muscovy CompanyTraded furs and timber with Russia1581The Eastland CompanyTrade timber, tar and canvas with the Baltic1581The Levant CompanyTraded dyes, dried fruit, wine, and silk with the Eastern Mediterranean1600The East India CompanyTraded silk, cotton, spices, and tea with India and the Far East\n\nGlobal Exploration in the Elizabethan Era\n\nThe Elizabethan era was a time of global exploration for many countries. The Spanish and Portuguese empires were the first to colonise the New World of the Americas, followed by the Dutch, French, and English. The English had their sights set on North America, where no Europeans had yet colonised.\n\nLet’s have a look at the progress made under Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nThe lost colony of Roanoke\n\nElizabeth I granted Sir Walter Raleigh the right to explore the New World. He led two expeditions and then sent a team to colonise Roanoke Island in present-day North Carolina in 1585. The colonisation failed, but another attempt was made in 1587. The governor of this new colony John White returned to England to stock up on supplies and report on the colony’s progress but upon his return, the entire colony had vanished, which is why it is known as the lost colony of Roanoke.\n\nThe failure of the Roanoke Colony in the area that Raleigh named Virginia after Elizabeth (the Virgin Queen) ended colonisation attempts for nearly two decades. The colony pathed the way for future colonisation after Elizabeth’s death when the Virginia Colony flourished.\n\nSir Francis Drake\n\nSir Francis Drake was an English explorer, sea captain, privateer, slave trader, naval officer, and politician during Elizabethan times.\n\nPrivateer\n\nA private person or ship engaging in maritime warfare under a commission of war; often referred to as pirates.\n\nFrancis Drake’s key achievements included:\n\nDiscovery of the Straits of Magellan, a sea route at the tip of South America connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans\n\nDiscovery of Tierra del Fuego, islands south of the Magellan Strait\n\nDiscovery of America’s north coast; Drake sailed further than any other European before him and landed in what is now San Francisco, naming it Nova Albion (New England).\n\nHe was the first person to sail around the globe.\n\nQueen Elizabeth I and the Spanish Armada\n\nThe greatest threat during Elizabeth I’s reign was Spain.\n\nSir Francis Drake had undertaken major voyages against Spanish ports in the Caribbean in 1585 and 1586, and he made a successful raid on Cádiz (southwestern Spain) in 1587. With his raid on Cádiz, he destroyed a Spanish fleet of warships that were to attack England.\n\nNevertheless, on 12 July 1588, the Spanish Armada set sail from the Netherlands to England’s southeast coast with a great fleet of ships. Sir Francis Drake was second-in-command to Admiral Charles Howard, who commanded the English fleet against the Spanish.\n\nDue to a combination of miscalculation, misfortune, bad weather, and an attack of English fire ships, on 29 July 1588, the Spanish Armada was defeated, and with it, the threat of Spain to England.\n\nBefore the English attack on the Spanish Armada, Elizabeth gave an impressive speech at Tilbury in 1588. A famous quote from this speech read:\n\nI know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and a king of England too, and think foul scorn that... any prince of Europe should dare to invade the borders of my reals. … I myself will be your general, judge, and rewarder of every one of your virtues in the field.\n\nQueen Elizabeth I’s Death and Succession\n\nElizabeth died at Richmond Palace on 24 March 1603. Her health declined in autumn 1602 when a series of friends’ deaths plunged her into a deep depression. She died without having any children, ending the 118 year Tudor reign.\n\nMany believe that Elizabeth’s cosmetic concoction, which gave her the infamous pale appearance, was made from a mixture of lead and vinegar that may have affected her health. However, the cause of death is still unknown and highly disputed.\n\nSo, who would succeed Elizabeth given she had no children? The government, directed by Robert Cecil, the son of Elizabeth’s senior adviser William Cecil, placed James Stuart, the son of Mary, Queen of Scots, on the throne. James Stuart was already James VI King of Scotland, and on 24 March 1603, he also became James I, King of England and Ireland.\n\nElizabeth I’s Legacy and Accomplishments\n\nThe Elizabethan Era is called the ‘Golden Age’, represented by the English Renaissance with poetry, literature, and music.\n\nElizabeth thoroughly established the Church of England with the Religious Settlement, which helped shape today’s national identity.\n\nMany voyages and discoveries took place in the Elizabethan era.\n\nSeveral trading companies, such as the East India Company, were established.\n\nUnder Elizabeth’s rule, England defeated the Spanish Armada.\n\nIn 1586–87, Queen Elizabeth I paid Sir Francis Walsingham to set up England’s first counterintelligence network and a school to teach cypher-breaking and forgery, which was the forerunner of today’s intelligence services.\n\nIn 1601, the Elizabethan Poor Law was introduced, requiring every parish to care for the ‘lame, impotent, old, and blind’. This law evolved and the modern welfare state of the 20th century replaced it.\n\nThe image of Elizabeth’s reign is one of triumph and success, hence why she was often called ‘Gloriana’ or ‘Good Queen Bess’."
