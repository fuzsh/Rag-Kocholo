The 16th century in Britain saw economic expansion that led to social, political, and cultural transformations. This was the Elizabethan Era, a golden age under Queen Elizabeth I from 1558-1603. It was a time of growth in English literature, theatre, and exploration abroad. The Elizabethan Age was unique because it was a brief period of internal peace between religious conflicts that engulfed the 17th century. Elizabeth I restored Protestantism in England and imposed the Act of Supremacy, removing many Catholic clergy. She also held Mary Queen of Scots prisoner for 19 years to prevent her from challenging Elizabeth's rule.",
