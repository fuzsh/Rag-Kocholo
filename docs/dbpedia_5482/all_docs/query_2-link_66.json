        "text": "SRO CROWD WITNESS JEREMY MCDERMOTT SCORE LATE MODEL VICTORY AT RIVERHEAD RACEWAY SATURDAY\n\nBy Bob Finan\n\nAugust 25th, 2024\n\nOn a picture-perfect evening, a standing room only crowd packed Riverhead Raceway for the final School Bus Demolition Derby of 2024. Prior to the mayhem, the Advance Auto Parts Weekly Series was in action with Jeremy McDermott of Riverhead capturing the headline 40-lap Late Model feature event for his third win of the season.\n\nGerard Giordano and Brandon Turbush brought the Late Model field to green with Giordano, former New England Truck Series champion showing the way early. Turbush was passed on the second circuit by Chris McGuire who chased leader Giordano until the 7th lap when he was passed by Jeremy McDermott. The Giordano-McDermott storyline has varied during the spring and summer and another chapter was about to be entered. After settling in behind Giordano, McDermott paced himself looking for the right moment to make his move. On lap 25 exiting the fourth turn McDermott slipped underneath Giordano, the two traded some paint and by the time they reached the first turn to start lap 26, McDermott was the new leader. One lap after surrendering the lead to McDermott, Giordano was passed for second by \"Radiant\" Ray Minieri, who spent the rest of the race chasing McDermott.\n\nWhen the checker flag waved on the final Miller Lite Triple Crown Series of 2024 Jeremy McDermott was basking in the limelight with his Eastport Feeds team on his 33rd career win. The team dodged a bullet in qualifying when Jeremy spun the car in turn four taking contact from Brian Doyle who had nowhere to go. \"I don't know what happened in the heat, it just broke loose and went around\" McDermott recalled. \"My team got it right for the feature, we were free off, but we had a good battle with Giordano for the win\".\n\nWith his runner-up finish in the 1683 Bar & Grill machine in the 40-lapper, Ray Minieri of Bay Shore secured the 2024 Miller Lite Triple Crown Series title, \"we wrecked pretty bad at Wall last Saturday, I spent one entire day just welding her back into shape\" Ray noted post-race. Kevin Metzger of Massapequa was third in the Complete Well & Pump Toyota. Brian Doyle of Medford, thrashed on his car after the heat race crash to salvage the night with a fourth, while Chris McGuire of Miller Place was fifth.\n\nSimply stated Scott Pedersen of Shirley is dominating the 2024 TK Figure Eights at Riverhead Raceway. The former three-time champion won the 20-lap Miller Lite Triple Crown Series 20-lap event to securing the MLTCS title, it was Scott's fifth win in eight races this year. Pedersen and Bryan Quilliam brought the grid to green with Scott breaking out front. Quilliam was quickly passed on the first lap by Allan Pedersen who immediately glued himself to his uncle's bumper. For the entire 20-laps the Pedersen family sat at the front of the field with Scott in the Bobby's One Stop Custom Exhaust & Auto Camaro notching his 16th career victory. Allan Pedersen of Center Moriches settled for second in the Top Notch Performance Chevy, Ryan Warren of Ridge in his self-funded entry scored a podium finish in third.\n\nCody Triola of Bay Shore actually won the 30-lap Blunderbust feature event, second of their three race Miller Lite Triple Crown Series in his heat race. Starting deep in his qualifier, Triola, a former two-time champion moved towards the front earning passing point that put him on the pole for the feature. Cody, not one to look a gift horse in the mouth took full advantage leading green to checker for his third win of the season. Eddie Diaz chased Triola for 25 laps of the contest before he veered onto the Figure Eight course with mechanical failure while the field started the 26th lap. Just moments later, Ron Langdon making his first start of 2024 blew up in the Tom Puccia entry drawing a caution. The extra distance race featured the choose cone and Triola took the bottom, as did new second place runner Tom Pickerell, Joe Densieski who was third took the outside of the front row. On the restart Triola kept the Cesspool Pros machine out front driving off to his 13th career win in the process. Over the final three cycles the battle was for second with Joe Densieski of Riverhead making the wise choice at the cone to earn runner-up money in the Hydro Action Caprice. Championship leader Tom Pickerell of Huntington was third in the Encore Rentals Chevy.\n\nThe third and final Miller Lite Triple Crown Series race for the Super Pro Trucks, a 30-lap affair fell to Jack Handley Jr. of Medford who scored his fourth win in six races contested to date. Mark Stewart, third on the all-time SPT win list with 25 raced his way to the early lead over Erin Solomito at the throw of the green. While Stewart pulled away as the laps clicked off, Solomito had her hands full racing for second with the likes of Lou Maestri, Jack Handley Jr. and Sean Glennon. on lap 16 entering the third turn Handley muscled his way under Solomito for second but if he ere to catch Stewart he'd need a caution. Low and behold on lap 19 a single truck spin drew that caution Handley so desired. At the choose cone Stewart picked the inside, Handley wasted no time jumping to his outside. When the race resumed Handley in the East Side Building Toyota was able to ride the outside lane by Stewart for the lead. Two laps later Sean Glennon slipped under Stewart for second on lap 23. Once out-front Handley would have to survive two additional late race cautions and subsequent restarts to score his 24th career win putting him just one shy of Stewart for third. Sean Glennon of Northport with another solid effort was second in the Glennon Construction mount, Mark Stewart of Riverhead settled for third in the East Side Building machine.\n\nNot to be outdone by his older brother, \"Mad\" Max Handley of Medford won his fourth Street Stock event of 2024 in a 20-lap affair. Jack Handley Jr., making a one-off start in the Brian Brown Chevy broke to the early lead over Tom Sullivan. However, Sullivan would get too close to Jack on lap 2 sending the leader into a spin cycle and himself to the rear for his role. When the race went back to green Gerard Lawrence was the new early leader over Charles Sudano. Sudano was replaced in second on lap 7 by Jarrod Hayes who just two laps later jumped to the outside of Lawrence to take the lead on lap 10 during a restart. With Hayes leading and Lawrence second, Max Handley closed in to make a three-car fight. On lap 13 as the trio exited the fourth turn Handley dove to the inside, catching both Hayes and Lawrence off-guard. Max, in the Rosenberg & Gluck Personal Injury Law sponsored racer made the move stick to take the lead and his 5th career victory. Jarrod Hayes of Calverton, fresh off a Lake George vacation was runner-up in the North Fork Sanitation Chevy, Gerard Lawrence of Miller Place was third in the EP Milling & Sweeping Chevy.\n\nGreg Harris of Riverhead put his SGS Stone Works Chevy into the lead on lap 2 and never looked back claiming his second 30-lap 8-Cylinder Enduro win of 2024. Kevin Feeney of East Quogue in his sponsor wanted entry was second, Pat Collins of Southampton third in the PC Truck & Equipment machine.\n\nIn the wild School Bus Demolition Derby popular Johnny Vullo of Bay Shore won his second consecutive event in the same bus he won in, much to his own surprise.\n\nLate Models: 1.

With a short, simple Facebook posting published April 3rd. Anderson gave the first indication writing, \"plenty of race car equipment for sale, also tools, air & electric\" Just days later Wayne Anderson confirmed after 58-years in the racing game he was indeed liquidating his race shop inventory, preparing to retire. With Anderson's retirement, plus Kyle Soper having no current racing plans, the 2023 Riverhead Raceway NASCAR Modified title fight will be wide open starting opening night Saturday May 6th.\n\n\"Kyle indicated he wanted to pare back to a part-time schedule for 2023\" Anderson revealed, \"I understand, he just got engaged, is flourishing in his business career and wants to focus his energy there, but I wanted to continue full time\". Right after celebrating their fourth Riverhead Raceway Advance Auto Parts Weekly Series Riverhead Raceway and New York State championship in early January it was clear the tandem, who won 25 features together including the Baldwin, Evans & Jarzombek 77, Islip 300 and Miller Lite NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour event last summer were not going their separate ways. It was at this point Wayne, 76 had to make some hard decisions, \"we thought about putting another driver in the Anderson Motorsports/Eastport Feeds #15, but at this stage of the game my family, friends and sponsors and I figured this was good a time as any to call it a day\".\n\nWayne praised the effort Kyle Soper and his family brought to his team, \"Kyle, his father Tom and the entire Soper family are first class\" Wayne noted, \"what a magical racing carpet ride we rode together\" Indeed the Anderson/Soper combination that came together midway through the 2017 enjoyed instant success winning the 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2022 track championships while combining for 25 victories.\n\nFor his part Kyle Soper reflected on his time at Anderson Motorsports, \"I am greatful for Wayne and Joette Anderson, Doug and Maura Corwin of Eastport Feeds, they let me achieve things most people only dream about\". Kyle, 27 furthered, \"yeah, I wasn't too interested in full time anymore, work is really busy and real life for me is starting. I don't have any plans to race as of now in 2023, but honestly have not looked either\". Soper's NASCAR Modified has won 29 NASCAR Modified events (4 with family team) ranking him 11th on the all-time win list.\n\nThe word iconic might not do justice to the accomplishments of Wayne Anderson during his illustrious career that began with winning the 1965 Rookie of the Year at Islip Speedway, racing alongside his famed father Axel. All told won 32 features driving at Riverhead, earning him five track championships along the way in 1982,'87,'88,'90 & '91. The 32 wins ties him with Bill Park for 6th on the all-time win list. As much success as Wayne, who was inducted into the Suffolk County Sports Hall of Fame in 2006 enjoyed as a driver, his statistics as an owner at Riverhead are as impressive. Wayne enjoyed an additional five championships as an owner for Shawn Solomito in 2016 along with the four Kyle Soper earned in 2018, '19, '21 & '22. Four drivers would combine to give Wayne 45 victories at the wheel of the Eastport Feeds Chevy led by Soper's 25 wins. Timmy Solomito won 10 times, while brother Shawn added 8 wins while Donny Lia and the late Ted Christopher winning once.\n\nIn addition to his Riverhead Raceway exploits Wayne Anderson won the 1994 NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour championship and was a two-time track champion at both Islip Speedway and New Egypt Speedway.\n\nLooking back at all he accomplished Wayne was quick to share the credit, \"I was blessed during my career with some great marketing partners along the way. Sayville Ford, Insula-Dome Skylights and Eastport Feeds paved the way for those wins, championships and all the accolades\". Wayne also thanked his family, \"my wife Joette, daughter Melissa sacrificed so much for me so we could do what we did, it was a heck of a ride\".\n\nRiverhead GM John Ellwood has announced that the prominent first pit stall along the fence at Riverhead Raceway, occupied for so many seasons by the #15 will be titled The Wayne Anderson Championship Pit Stall, awarded annually to the championship team from the previous season. With Wayne Anderson and Kyle Soper not returning that stall will go to 2022 runner-up John Beatty Jr. and his car owner Mark Mina of MSM Elite Motorsports. There will be more tributes during the 2023 season that Ellwood and staff will announce at a later date.\n\nWith the vacating of the NASCAR Modified championship by the Anderson/Soper combination the race for the 2023 title is expected to be wide open starting with the Saturday May 6th opening night 50-lap feature event. The NASCAR Modified are joined on opening night by the Late Models, Eagle Auto Mall Crate Modifieds, Figure Eights, Blunderbusts, Super Pro Trucks and INEX Legend Race Cars.\n\nThe complete 2023 schedule of events can be viewed at www.riverheadraceway.com, e-mails reach the track at [email protected] while out phone number remains 631-842-RACE.\n\nTom Rogers Jr. Wires Riverhead Raceway Modifieds for 62nd Career Win, One Away from Tying Charlie Jarzombek All Time\n\nBy Bob Finan\n\nMay 27th, 2023\n\nTom Rogers Jr. of Riverhead made a triumphant return to Riverhead Raceway victory lane Saturday when he topped a caution free 50-lap NASCAR Modified feature. The win was the 62nd of Tom's NASCAR Modified career leaving him just one shy of \"Charging\" Charlie Jarzombek's all-time mark of 63. What maybe more concerning for Tom's competition came in a quick comment the five-time champion made post-race, \"we made an adjustment, it's good, but we can make it better\".\n\nArmed with a pole starting berth Tom Rogers Jr. and his cousin Chris brought the field to green to start what turned out to be a fast paced 50-laps. Despite being related the Rogers boys went after each other pretty good early on with Tom holding the advantage. As the contest progressed dirt racing ace and inaugural Islip 300 winner Dillon Steuer was making his way towards the front with the likes of JR Bertuccio and Dylan Slepian. After making his way to second Steuer was then tasked with trying to erase the lead Tom Rogers Jr. was able to build, no easy task in a race with no interruptions. With 10 or so laps to go Steuer filled the mirror of leader Rogers but as mentioned on the Flo Racing stream, catching Tom would be one thing, passing him quite another.\n\nWhen the race concluded Tom Rogers Jr., who in the closing laps found another gear was back in the winner's circle in the Stakey's Pumpkin Farm Chevy of Denise & Ken Darch. \"Great to be back here\" Tom boasted looking down at the checker flag. \"Can't say enough about everyone who stuck by me, wasn't sure we'd get here again or how many more I have left, who knows one or two more of these, we'll see\". Tom won the first of his 62 NASCAR Modified features on May 8th, 2004.\n\nDillon Steuer of Bohemia who sandwiched in his Riverhead visit in the midst of a dirt racing weekend at Bridgeport, NJ. Accord, NY and Lebanon Valley, NY finished runner-up in the Ken Matlach Motorsports Chevy. JR Bertuccio of Centereach had a good Gershow Recycling car early and claimed third at the finish. Dylan Slepian of Dix Hills and John Beatty Jr. of Merrick were fourth and fifth.\n\nWhile the Modifieds went non-stop, the 25 lap Eagle Auto Mall Crate Modified feature resembled Memorial Day holiday traffic on the LIE. When the dust settled Kyle Ellwood of Riverhead earned his second career feature event win in the Kelco Construction Chevy. At the throw of the green pole sitter Kyle Ellwood showed the way but numerous caution flags would slow the event. On lap 11, the \"big one\" happened off turn two when Stephen Coleman went around towards the front of the field collecting and ending the night for himself, Chase Grennan, Sean Glennon, Dennis Krupski and Chevy Rommeney. While green Ellwood driving the Rat Pack Racing owned entry had things under control at the front for the win. Max Handley of Medford in the Hydro Action machine was runner-up with defending champion Owen Grennan of Glen Cove third in the Eastport Feeds Chevy.\n\nThe Late Models ran the first of their 3 race Miller Lite Triple Crown Series events, a scheduled 40-lap affair that was cut to 27-laps due to time constraints. No matter 27, 35 or 40-laps, opening night winner Jeremy McDermott of Riverhead took the lead at the drop of the green and never looked back. When the race got underway McDermott, steering the Eastport Feeds entry moved out front with Artie Pedersen III tucking into second. With multiple double file restarts during the course of the shortened race, a cone race due to the extra distance McDermott would choose the bottom as did challenger Pedersen, leaving the top open with Jimmy Rennick Jr. gladly moving to the outside pole. When the green reappeared McDermott and Pedersen remained one-two, while Rennick was in a tussle with the likes of Chris McGuire and defending champion Shawn Patrick for third. After a two-car incident on lap 27, the field was placed in the proper running order and the race deemed official with Jeremy McDermott the winner. Artie Pedersen III of Center Moriches was runner-up in the Shelby's Kitchen entry while Jimmy Rennick Jr. of Howard Beach played the choose cone to his advantage for third in the Metropolitan Recycling Chevy.\n\nThe INEX Legend Race Cars also kicked off their Miller Lite Triple Crown Series with a 30-lap tilt, a race like others that saw numerous cautions. However, in the case of the Legends, the many restarts provided plenty of excitement between three main players, Richie Davidowitz, Jeff Farruggia Jr. and Joey Braun. Every restart the trio of talented drivers went toe-to-toe jockeying for position, racing cleanly with little to no contact. Late in the contest Braun and Farruggia got after each other for second and at times that allowed leader Davidowitz slight breathing room. When all was aid and done Richie Davidowitz scored his third win in a row in 2023, 28th of his career in the Hampton Fleet Service mount. Joey Braun of Manorville with a late race pass finished second in the Uncle Carmine's Hot Peppers entry while Jeff Farruggia of Riverhead continues to impress with a third in the AJ'S Painting machine.\n\nSaturday in the 15-lap Bock Auto Bandolero Bandit feature, Reid Halpin of Wading River came full circle in his very young racing career scoring his first career win. In the summer of 2021, Reid visiting the Waterford Speedbowl on a Wednesday night was involved in a hard impact crash. On Saturday Reid, steering the MSM Elite Motorsports/East-West Management racer put that all behind him. Emmett Grattan broke to the early lead but was the victim of a no contact spin moving Reid Halpin to the lead. Once in the lead Halpin was able to get away from the field for a spell. However, as the laps clicked off Mason Goodale, in just his second start was on the move, but there would be no keeping Reid Halpin from victory lane and a jubilant celebration. Mason Goodale of Riverhead was runner-up in the Riverhead Building Supply racer while Emmett Grattan of Southold recovered from his early race spin for third in the Southold PBA machine.\n\nIn the Bock Auto Bandolero Outlaw 15-lap feature Will Sipala of Manorville made a bold and daring move at the start of the race to come to the race lead. Like Halpin before him in the Bandits, Sipala drove to a comfortable lead and hoped for no caution flags. No were waved and it seemed Will had scored his first career win. Unfortunately, in post-race tech Will's entry did not pass muster and the win would not stand. That turn of events moved the 860 Motorsports Northeast machine of 2022 Bandits champion Ben Morabito of Miller Place into victory lane for the second time in as many races this year. Gavin Romano of Riverhead was second in the Mil-Aero Solutions racer while Cillian Tennant of Riverhead was third in the Miller & Caggiano Attorney At Law entry.\n\nThe race of the night hands down was contested in the 40-lap Truck Enduro where Mariah Lawrence of Southampton, 2021 champion of the division thwarted off the late race challenges of Phil LaManna of Smithtown and Bobby Pease of Medford. Lawrence, wheeling her sponsor wanted General Lee saw a comfortable lead evaporate in the final 10-lap segment of the contest with LaManna and Pease hunting her down. Over the final five circuits lapped traffic was thick but Mariah was equal to the task scoring her first win of 2023. LaManna in the EP Milling & Sweeping Chevy was second with Pease in the Fit Spot Gym third.\n\nJack Handley Jr. Doubles Down at Riverhead Raceway Saturday, Winning Mod and Truck Features\n\nBy Bob Finan\n\nMay 13th, 2023\n\nOver a racing career a driver will have certain nights standout in their memory over time. For rising driving talent Jack Handley Jr of Medford, Saturday May 13th, 2023 will be a night he soon won't forget after winning the 50-lap NASCAR Modified feature just an hour or so after winning his second straight Super Pro Truck event of the young Advance Auto Parts Weekly Series season.\n\nFor a better part of the NASCAR Modified feature it appeared as though Justin Brown of Manorville who is running for Sunoco Rookie of the Year honors on the Whelen Modified Tour was going to steer his family car to victory lane. Brown started the race on the pole by virtue of accumulating passing points in his heat race broke out to the lead in a race that nearly went to the halfway mark without interruption. However the caution flags did start to wave just prior to the midway point leading up to numerous double file restarts. The real fireworks were yet to come in the second half. On lap 33 Brown and Michael Rutkoski were pitted side by side for a restart and when the green waved contact ensued with Rutkoski getting two heels off the ground with a they race quickly going back under caution. Rutkoski would continue at the rear after drawing the yellow, Brown was asked to join Rutkoski by race control. Feeling he was not in the wrong, Brown parked his car for the balance.\n\nThat moved John Beatty Jr. and Dave Brigati to the front row to resume the race. When the green lights came back on Beatty didn't fire off the way he normally does and Brigati was quick to take advantage and the race lead. However on lap 42 as he exited turn two his car began to slow and he pulled to the infield with a broken rear end assembly. That moved second generation driver Matt Brode to the race lead with Jack Handley Jr. now second with just eight laps left in the contest. Matt, son of three-time track champion Howie Brode had just two miles between he and his first career NASCAR Modified win, all he needed to have happen was have the remainder of the race play out without caution. Unfortunately for Matt the final yellow of the race waved on lap 45 for a minor spin. On the ensuing restart Brode and Handley, two young, agressive drivers both wanting to win raced hard for the victory. Brode was protecting and Handley pressuring and momentary contact was made getting Matt askew allowing Handley to move out front. Jack was not done though, as now he was the hunted as Dylan Slepian, who raced all the way back from an early race penalty was all over Jack over the final laps.\n\nAt the checker Jack Handley Jr. in the Joe Densieski owned, Suffolk Precast Chevy prevailed. \"Wow what a night\" Jack boasted afterwards, \"I'm so blessed to have a Super Pro Truck owner like Andre Vega and Joe D with the Modified, they give me such wonderful opportunities\". As he closed out his post-race comments Handley looked over at the backstretch grandstands and pointed out, \"I have some of my work friends here and a bunch of New York City Firefighters, let's get the party started\". The victory is the second career Modified win for Handley.\n\nNobody passed more cars in the 50-lapper than runner-up Dylan Slepian of Dix Hills in the Eastport Feeds Chevy, while Chris Rogers of Patchogue turned in an impressive third place tally in the JDL Environmental Chevy. John Beatty Jr. of Merrick and Michael Rutkoski of Mattituck pressed on for fourth and fifth.\n\nFor the second week in a row a Grennan sat in the winners circle at the conclusion of the 25-lap Eagle Auto Mall Crate Modifieds. On opening night Chase Grennan of Glen Cove was declared the winners of the race after tech. Saturday defending champion and older brother Owen pocketed his 15th career win when he led flag to flag for the win. Starting from the pole Owen broke right to the lead with outside pole sitter Kyle Ellwood in tow. It was Ellwood's car that was disqualified for unapproved header modifications on opening night and indeed Kyle was determined to find a way if he could pass Owen Grennan for the win. In the end there would be no passing the Dillner Precast Chevy of Owen Grennan who flashed under the checkers first. Kyle Ellwood of Riverhead was second in the Rosemar Industries Chevy while Michael Berner of Patchogue placed on the podium with a third in the All Island Car Wash entry.\n\nThe Pedersen family version of Family Feud continued to play out in the second 15-lap Figure Eight feature of the season, this time Scott Pedersen of Shirley staved off challenges from his nephew Allan Pedersen for the 15-lap victory. Opening night, the roles were reversed with Allan topping Uncle Scott, the defending champion in the class. During the off-season Scott switched teams moving to the Northeaster Office Equipment/Richo Business Systems effort and so far they new pairing are quick out of the gate. Despite heavy challenges from his nephew Allan, who was seeking his fourth win in a row dating back to last year Scott held on for his 11th career win. Allan Pedersen of Center Moriches was runner-up in the Top Notch Performance Chevy with Gary Fritz Jr,. of Mastic third in the Bobby's One Stop Auto & Exhaust Cadillac.\n\nPrior to winning the NASCAR Modified event, Jack Handley Jr. topped the 30-lap Super Pro Truck main event, the first race of their 2023 Miller Lite Triple Crown Series. The race wound-up being a replay of opening night as Handley would lead Lou Maestri of Deer Park over the entire race distance. While able to stay in the tire tracks of the leader, Maestri, all-time leading winner of the class could not pull up to post a challenge. For the 18th time in his career when the Super Pro Truck event ended Jack Handley Jr. took home the win in the River Walk Bar & Grill Toyota. Lou Maestri was runner-up in the Monetary Recovery Company racer while Matt Triola of Bay Shore was third in the Cesspool Pros Chevy.\n\nAfter going winless in 2022, \"Big Money\" Richie Davidowitz of East Moriches returned to his winning ways in the INEX Legend Race Cars topping their 25-lap feature. Young gun Jeffrey Farruggia Jr. broke to the early lead and was doing a masterful job of leading the 26-car field, especially considering Davidowitz the all-time leading winner with 25 wins was hot on his heels. After sizing up Farruggia for a few laps Davidowitz made his move to the lead. Now second Farruggia and two other up and coming teenage talents in Christopher Coleman and Chase Van Houten took up a three-car race for second, which was just fine with Davidowitz out front. In the end Richie Davidowitz sat in victory lane with his Hampton Fleet Service entry, \"Cookies\" Christopher Coleman of East Islip was an impressive runner-up in the Fidge Factor Web Design machine with Jeffrey Farruggia of Riverhead third in the KMK Contracting mount.\n\nThe 40-lap 4/6-Cylinder Gut & Go Enduro was captured by CJ Zurkowski of Riverhead in the Newtown Landscaping Chevy. Robert Izzo and Jack Tessa were second and third.\n\nIn the 12-lap School Bus Figure Eight race 15-year old Chevy Rommeney of Bohemia scored the extremely popular Scout Night win in his first ever School Bus event.\n\nSunday Miller Lite Triple Crown Series Wins Fall to Brian Brown & Andrew Farnham at Riverhead Raceway\n\nBy Bob Finan\n\nMay 7th, 2023\n\nThe second half of opening weekend Sunday at Riverhead Raceway was contested under beautiful sunny skies and temperatures with the Street Stocks and Mini Stocks highlighting the card with 30-lap Miller Lite Triple Crown Series feature events. When the dust settled Brian Brown of Calverton collected his 9th career Street Stock win tying him with Eric Zeh on the all-time win list while defending Mini Stock champion Andrew Farnham of Baldwin scored his 7th career victory tying him with CJ Zukowski for third all time.\n\nIn the Street Stock contest former Blunderbust and Late Model winner Jarrod Hayes of Calverton seemingly has things in hand leading all 30 circuits of the race that went caution free. Brian Brown, a driver with vast experience at Riverhead as well, including Late Model and Crate Mods chased Hayes the entire distance but could never get to the back bumper of J-Rod. Hayes took the checker flag, did the post-race interview and was ready to rush to a family event. However, in tech the car was found with unapproved brake modifications stripping Hayes of the win.\n\n\"Not the way we like to win them, but we'll take it\" Brown noted after being presented the trophy pit side, \"can't thank Doug & Maura of Eastport Feeds enough and of course my wife Jamie, she drives me to be better everyday\".\n\nGreg Harris of Riverhead placed second in his SGS Stone Works Chevy while Rhett Fogg of Westhampton crossed the line third in the McBetts Racing Engines Chevy.\n\nNo better way for a defending champion to start a title defense season off with a win which is exactly what Andrew Farnham did Sunday in the non-stop Mini Stock 30-lap feature. Farnham in the Ken Matlach Motorsports Honda broke to the early lead as the green dropped. Along the way Andrew had stiff competition, the toughest of which came from eventual runner-up Paul Wojcik of Patchogue. Wojcik, a former champion himself pressured Farnham every turn of every laps over the final 10-lap segment. However Wojcik in the RFG Electrical Contracting entry would have to be content with second while Chris Olivari of Coram in his sponsor wanted racer was third.\n\nIn the 15-lap Bock Auto INEX Bandolero Bandit event, Kix Bock of East Hampton enjoyed the thrill of a first career feature event win Sunday. Bock broke to the lead where he'd stay the entire distance in the Bock Auto entry but had pressure early from Emmett Grattan. Shortly after a late race restart, Bock continued to lead but a battle was brewing for second as Grattan had his mirror fill up with a quick closing Reid Halpin. With just a handful of laps left in the tilt Halpin made a textbook inside pass of Grattan for second exiting the fourth corner. By the time Reid got to second Kix Bock was long gone and drove off to the victory. Halpin, of Wading River turned in a stellar runner-up performance in the Nick & Dano's Auto Clinic Bando while Emmett Grattan of Southold was third in the Southold PBA racer.\n\n2022 Bock Auto INEX Bandolero Bandit champion Ben Morabito of Miller Place topped the 15-lap Outlaw feature event in his first Outlaw. Morabito turned out to be a quick learner as he won the event after taking the lead just past halfway from Gavin Romano. Once in front Ben, steering the Benimax Trucking Bando never looked back notching his 4th overall Riverhead Bock Auto Bandolero victory. Will Sipala of Manorville made a late race charge to second where he'd finish in the Riteway Automotive Center entry while early leader Gavin Romano of Riverhead was third in the Mil-Aero Solutions machine.\n\nThe \"Quiet Man\" Phil LaManna of Smithtown dominated, as he so often does the 50-lap Truck Enduro. LaManna, owner of EP Milling & Sweeping that sponsors a fleet of cars at the track simply pulled away from the field to score yet another win. Bobby Pease of Medford in the Fit Spot Gym Chevy was second while Whitney Williams of Huntington was third.\n\nSome years, ago Don Carasiti of St. James won his share of Spectator Drag events at Riverhead with his red Pontiac Firebird, always sporting his Fred Harbach X-90 -shirt. After taking some time away from the game Carasiti returned Sunday in a big way as he won the 50-lap 8-Cylinder Enduro steering his sponsor wanted Chevy. Woot Lawrence of Southampton was runner-up in the Gregor Well Drilling Camaro while David Verbeeck of Levittown placed third in his self funded racer.\n\nMike Mujsce Jr. of Hampton Bays made a triumphant return to the 4/6-Cylinder Gut & Go Enduro by winning their 50-lap main event. Mujsce moved up to the Mini Stocks successfully winning 8 times tying him with Joe Warren Jr. for all-time wins in the division. Mujsce drove the East & West Pest Control mount Sunday and was followed by Joe Warren Jr. of Ridge in the Newtown Landscaping Chevy and Chris Olivari of Coram in the sponsor wanted entry.\n\nTribute Turns to Triumph as Timmy Solomito Takes Riverhead Raceway NASCAR Modified Opener Sporting Wayne Anderson Throwback Colors\n\nBy Bob Finan\n\nMay 6th, 2023\n\nTimmy Solomito of Islip really had no concrete plans on running the 73rd season opening night NASCAR Modified event Saturday at Riverhead Raceway, however with the recent announcement of Wayne Anderson's retirement Timmy's wheels started spinning. After all it was Wayne & Joette Anderson who gave Timmy his first big break and so he wrapped his car in one of Anderson's more popular colors and at the end of 50-laps tribute turned to triumph as Solomito pocketed his 21st career win. The thank you brought the 76-year old Anderson, who Solomito affectionately calls \"Pops\" to the winners circle one more time.\n\nWith a new handicap system in place for the 2023 Advance Auto Parts Weekly Series, Solomito who charged from the back of his qualifying heat to the front earned the pole position for the 19-car starting grid. The rest as the saying goes is history, although writing that history wasn't as easy as it sounds. Early on Timmy Solomito had hard charging Chris Young, who went winless in 2022 hot on his heels. However as the race wore on Young had some suitors of his own who came calling allowing the leader to get away some during an extended green flag run that extended just past the halfway point. Over the second half of the race Young soon lost second to Kyle Ellwood who himself was out to score his first NASCAR Modified win in quite some time. Over the final stretch run Ellwood stayed in the rearview mirror of leader Solomito, trying to gain a run to the inside exiting the corners of the tight 1/4-mile bullring. However as it if were the 1980's at Islip Speedway, New Egypt Speedway or Riverhead Raceway the light blue colors of Wayne Anderson sat in victory lane as Timmy Solomito scored the story book victory.\n\nAfter exiting his wining machine Timmy offered, \"my family and I had no real plans on running here tonight, we had a few penciled for later in the season. But it was Wayne & Joette who gave me my first break not only here but on the WMT, without them, well who knows\". Timmy, who owns Natural Design Concept & Designs and wrapped the winning car continued, \"Big shout out to Doug & Maura Corwin of Eastport Feeds, they were behind this 100% and of course my family for always having my back. We'll do some of the time trial shows later in the season\". The win moved Solomito into a three way tie on the all-time win list at 21 with Fred Harbach & Dan Jivanelli.\n\nKyle Ellwood of Riverhead was runner-up in the Buzz Chew Chevrolet entry while the returning Tom Rogers Jr. of Riverhead came home third in the Precision Water Works racer. Dylan Slepian of Dix Hills came from deep in the field to finish fourth while John Beatty Jr. of Merrick was fifth.\n\nAfter a year away from racing to start a family, Jeremy McDermott returned to the Late Model wars with a win Saturday in the Rob Pelis owned Eastport Feeds Chevy. Early in the contest Artie Pedersen III looked to have the field covered driving for a new team and owner Jennifer Joann. As the 25-lap race moved along it looked as if Pedersen was going to pocket his first career LM win, as long as the race went caution free. As fate would have it on lap 13 the race was slowed for a multi car incident lining McDermott, who just made his way to second alongside Pedersen for the double file restart. When the green lights came back on Jeremy McDermott pounced taking the lead and leading the remainder of the race for his 26th career win, good for fifth on the all-time win list. Artie Pedersen III of Center Moriches was runner-up in the NY Bernedoodles Chevy while Chris McGuire of Miller Place, who ran second early settled for third in the RTI Inc. machine.\n\nWhen the checker flag waved on the 25-lap Eagle Auto Mall Crate Modified event it appeared as if Kyle Ellwood has scored a win for Rat Pack Racing after holding off the efforts of a hard charging Chase Grennan of Glen Cove. However in post-race teach the winning car was disqualified for an issue in the exhaust/header category of the rules and the win went to Chase Grennan, the third of his career in the Black Forest Auto Chevy. Alex Colasanto of Selden was second in the Vanguard Fire Protection Chevy while Sean Glennon of Northport was third in the LTE Drainage mount.\n\nWhen the Figure Eights ran a doubleheader weekend to close out the 2022 season last September, Allan Pedersen of Center Moriches swept the weekend. On Saturday he got the new season off the same as he ended last year, with a win in the 15-lap feature event. In fact the Pedersen family controlled the majority of the opener as at one point Scott Pedersen, defending champion in the class led nephews Allan & Artie. Scott, driving for new car owner Kathy Kraft seemed to be on his way to a win for his new team but Allan was having none of it taking the lead in the Top Notch Performance Chevy late in the race and his fourth career win. Scott Pedersen of Shirley in the Couch Racer Cadillac was runner-up while Ken Hyde Jr. of Medford came home third in the Brigandi Brothers Automotive Chevy breaking up the Pedersen family reunion on the podium.\n\nTwo-time and defending Blunderbust champion Cody Triola of Bay Shore started the quest for his third straight title with a victory in a non-stop 20-lap feature. Starting from the pole, Triola at the wheel of the Cesspool Pros entry left little doubt as to who was going to win the race driving off to his 9th career win. Brandon Hubbard of Medford was second at the finish in his United Exhaust machine while Jim Laird Jr. of Islip Terrace was third with his Stakey's Pumpkin Farm Caprice.\n\nBaseball had a Mr. October, Riverhead Raceway has Mr. Opening Night in the person of 20-lap Super Pro Truck feature winner Jack Handley Jr. of Medford. Between his days as a Blunderbust racer and now in the Super Pro Truck ranks Jack, a St. John's University graduate wins more often than not over the last decade on opening night. Like Triola earlier, Handley steering the East End Builders owned truck left little doubt as to who was going to win the opener. When Handley took the checker flag it marked his 17th career win tying him for 5th on the all-time win list with Frank Dumicich Sr. Lou Maestri of Deer Park, who tops the all-time win list came home second in the Hunter Business School racer while Matt Triola of Bay Shore completed the podium in his Cesspool Pros Chevy.\n\nFormer champion and tested tough INEX Legend Race Car talent Kevin Nowak of Medford scored a milestone 20th career win Saturday when he triumphed in their 20-lap opener. Racing against competitors who were not even born when he started racing, Nowak used that experience during several early race restarts to take the lead of the race and soon was joined by a fellow veteran and former champion Richie Davidowitz at the front of the field. The duo, who used to travel together to out of state events went toe to toe for the win over the final half of the event. In the end Nowak would prevail in his HVAC Unlimited racer while Davidowitz of East Moriches was a close second in the Green Ride Medical Transport machine. 2022 Rookie of the Year Chase Van Houten of Wading River was third in the Terra Vite Vineyards entry.\n\nWeekend Doubleheader to Kick Start 2023 Championship Chases At Riverhead Raceway This Saturday And Sunday\n\nBy Bob Finan\n\nMay 1st, 2023\n\nThe chase for fourteen 2023 divisional Riverhead Raceway track championships will kick off in spectacular fashion as Connie Partridge and Tom Gatz present opening weekend May 6th & May 7th at the historic quarter mile facility. Seven NASCAR Advance Auto Parts Weekly Series divisions take the green flag Saturday evening while the next afternoon on Sunday seven more divisions begin their quest for a 2023 driving title. Of the fourteen drivers capturing 2022 championships, twelve are expected to defend this season.\n\nWith the news of Wayne Anderson and Kyle Soper going their separate ways, the NASCAR Modified championship chase will be wide open for 2023 starting with this Saturday night's 50-lap event on opening night. John Beatty Jr. of Merrick and his MSM Elite Motorsports team were runner-up to the Anderson/Soper team last season and enter the new season as favorites. There are however plenty of teams ready to pounce on the vacant title. 2022 runner-up Dylan Slepian of Dix Hills and his Eastport Feeds team are ready to take a step up to the championship rung as is third place point man for 2022 John Beatty Jr of Merrick with his MSM Elite Motorsports group. Dave Brigati of Calverton in his Coors Light Silver Bullet and 2022 Rookie of the Year Jack Handley Jr. of Medford in the Suffolk Precast entry were fourth and fifth last year, poised for a title run this year. Throw in talents like Chris Young of Calverton, Eddie Brunnhoelzl III of Levittown, Jason Agugliaro of Islip, Chris Turbush of Wading River Matt Brode of East Islip, Chris Rogers of Patchogue, oh and don't forget returning multi time champion Tom Rogers of Riverhead adding up to a competitive title fight.\n\nAfter 30-years of chasing a Late Model championship Shawn Patrick of Brightwaters will be back to defend his 2022 championship in the Matlach Fabricating racer, while first time Eagle Auto Mall Crate Modified champion Owen Grennan of Glen Cove will be defending in his Dillner Precast/Eastport Feeds Chevy. Both Patrick and Grennan are going to be busy in '23 as Shawn oversees son Liam's budding Super Pro Truck career while Owen straps into the Ken Matlach Motorsports NASCAR Modified on occasion.\n\n2022 Figure Eight champion Scott Pedersen of Shirley will be back seeking his third straight championship in the division, however the soft-spoken driver might very well be doing so with a new team. Scott is expected to reveal his plans this week. Two-time and defending Blunderbust champion Cody Triola and his Cesspool Pros team out of Bay Shore are going for three in a row in 2023, while 2022 Super Pro Truck champion Sean Glennon of Northport seeks to repeat in the LTE Drainage truck. Both drivers will pull double duty with Triola driving the North fork Welding Supply Figure Eight entry and Glennon wheeling his family's Eagle Auto Mall Crate Modified. Off the thrill of his firstINEX Legend Race Car championship last summer, Eric Hersey of Commack will be defending in his Grilling Villain entry and like Glennon will chase the Crate Modified crown.\n\nOnce the Saturday Advance Auto Parts Weekly Series opener is in the books attention quickly moves to the Sunday afternoon Enduro Opening Day. Originally the event was set for this past Sunday but a wet weekend scrubbed all on track activities at Riverhead. Dave Antos of Lindenhurst will be gunning for his fourth career Street Stock championship fresh off his 2022 title in the EP Milling & Sweeping Chevy starting with the Miller Lite Triple Crown Series 30-laplid lifter Sunday. Andrew Farnham of Baldwin will do the same in the Mini Stocks, who also compete in their Miller Lite Triple Crown Series opener Sunday and Farnham with help from Ken Matlach Motorsports hopes to score the victory.\n\nThe popular and growing Bock Auto INEX Bandolero class is ready for their third year of racing on the high banks. 2022 Bandit champion Benny Morabito of Miller Place and his Benimax Racing team are moving up to the Outlaw class for 2023 and judging by practice day on April 22nd are an immediate threat to win that title. Chevy Rommeney of Bohemia captured the Bock Auto Bandolero Outlaw crown last year but has \"aged\" out of the class and has not released his racing plans for the 2023 campaign.\n\nPopular Woot Lawrence of Southampton will begin his title defense in his Gregor Well Drilling machine in the Truck Enduro Sunday.

When the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour rolls into Riverhead Raceway June 24th they will compete in the Miller Lite 200, Salute to Mike Ewanitsko. Mike, the all-time leading WMT winner at Riverhead will be on hand having an active role during the evening, an evening that could very well wind up with Justin Bonsignore tying him atop the Riverhead WMT win list.\n\nDuring the off-season Riverhead Raceway GM John Ellwood thought it would be great to salute Mike Ewanitsko during the 2023 race season. With Mike enjoying equal amounts of success at both Riverhead Raceway and on the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour, the concept of showcasing Mike's racing career during a WMT event came into focus. Riverhead owners Connie Partridge and Tom Gatz were immediately on board with Jimmy Wilson of NASCAR quickly signing on. \"Mike was truly one of the best seat of the pants drivers to ever strap into a Modified\", Ellwood offered. John also disclosed plans for Mike during the Miller Lite 200, \"Mike will participate in the WMT autograph session, give the command to fire engines pre-race and present the race winning trophy. We are honored to have Mike as part of the 200, it will be great to see him interact with his fans again.\"\n\nAfter cutting his eye teeth with the Nassau Quarter Midget program, Mike was elevated into the Ira Bromley owned Mutual Engraving NASCAR Modified at Islip Speedway just before the famed 1/5 of a mile shuttered in 1984. When Saturday night racing shifted east to Riverhead Raceway, it didn't take Mike long to find victory lane as he won his first NASCAR Modified feature at 18 years and two months old on June 14th,1985. It would be the first of 30 overall victories for Mike at Riverhead ranking him 10th on the all-time win list.\n\nIt wasn't long before Mike and his later father Lew made the decision to move their racing focus to the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour where i again it didn't take Mike long to find his way to victory lane. His first of his 11 WMT wins at Riverhead came during the July 8th,1987 CAM2 Motor Oil 151. Ewanitsko quickly backed that first win up on August 6th,1987 when he topped the 7-Up 151 at the demanding quarter mile. Mike would then pick up one Riverhead WMT win per season during the 1988, '89, '90, '92. '95. '97, & '98 seasons. His final home track win came during the CARQUEST Auto Parts 200 August 5th.2000.\n\nEarly on the Ewantisko team would continue running some weekly Riverhead shows when their WMT schedule permitted. However, car owners and sponsors were noticing Mike's natural ability and his racing horizons soon expanded. After his first WMT triumph at Riverhead in 1987, Mike drove to a career total of 28 WMT wins placing him 8th in the WMT all-time rankings. His final visit to WMT victory lane would be a very special one, a win at Martinsville Speedway on October 13th.2001. For his father Lew and family, Mike winning that Martisnville event was among his career highlights as the Virginia oval held a special place in their hearts.\n\nThrough it all Mike remained one of the most popular personalities with the fans of the WMT as well his fellow competitors. Many wondered, if not for some health issues Mike pushed through since youth, what more could he of accomplished on the NASCAR WMT and beyond. Today at 56, Mike remains a humble man and when notified by Riverhead Raceway about the Miller Lite 200 Salute to Mike Ewanitsko, Mike's first response was, \"Looking forward to it, I don't feel like I really did enough to deserve a race, but I am honored\".\n\nMike is looking forward to the possibility of handing the Miller Lite 200 trophy to Justin Bonsignore in victory lane and welcoming Justin to the top of the track WMT win list. After winning the rain delayed Buzz Chew Chevrolet-Cadillac 200 on May 21st at Riverhead for his 10th win at the bullring, Justin admitted \"really hoping to win the salute to Mike Ewanitsko race when we come back in June, that would be pretty cool\". Justin's trek to the top of the Riverhead WMT win list began with a win July 30th,2011 in the Lighthouse Mission 200.\n\nWill a Hollywood type end to the Miller Lite 200 Salute to Mike Ewanitsko be in the offering Saturday June 24th at Riverhead Raceway? Make sure to either join us at the track or watch on Flo Racing for the answers to that and many more questions.\n\nFor further information please visit www.riverheadraceway.com, e-mails reach us at [email protected], 631-842-RACE is our phone number.\n\nChris Rogers Is Fifth Different Riverhead Raceway Modified Winner in As Many Races with First Career Victory\n\nBy Bob Finan\n\nJune 10th, 2023\n\nWhen one grows up an aspiring race car driver on Long Island the ultimate goal is to win a NASCAR Modified event at Riverhead Raceway. Saturday night Chris Rogers of Patchogue attained that goal when he won the 50-lap Advanced Auto Parts Night event becoming the fifth Modified winner in five races to date in 2023. Of the seven feature event winners on the night, five enjoyed their first ever win.\n\nIt took two attempts to get the event underway as a John Beatty Jr. spin off the bumper of Chris Turbush slowed the race on the backstretch before the first laps was completed. Turbush was moved to the rear of the 14-car field joining Beatty. The second try at getting the race going fell short when Michael Rutkoski spun into the infield off the bumper of Matt Brode in turn three, Brode was sent to the rear with Rutkoski who had to pit after hitting a yuke tire but would return. Third time was the charm when Chris Rogers and his 62-time winning cousin Tom Rogers Jr. made up the front row. After running side by side for the first lap Chris took the advantage on lap 2 but the driver on the march using the outside lane was the previous weeks winner Chris Young. On lap three Young worked his way to second passing Tom Rogers Jr., a former five-time track champion to the outside and many sat and wondered how long before Chris would make his move for the lead on the younger cousin.\n\nAs the race moved along Chris Rogers, who was tabbed three years ago to drive the Outlaw Inc. team car to Dave Brigati found another gear in the Coors Light Chevy and was able to keep Young who was looking to become the first repeat winner on the season at bay. At the finish Chris Rogers, who worked his way through the ranks racing first in the INEX Legend Race Cars and Eagle Auto Mall Crate Modifieds at Riverhead would makes his youthful dreams become a reality with career win number one. \"I can never thank Dave, Brian Schwarz and the entire Outlaw Inc. family enough for this opportunity. Thanks to Coors Light, JDL Environmental and Covino Trucking for their support\". He concluded by dedicating the win to Becky Collins, wife of longtime Outlaw Inc crew member Warren, \"this one is for Becky, she is going through a tough fight with cancer, I hope we put a smile on her face tonight\".\n\nChris Young of Calverton was runner-up in the CPC Racing entry while Jack Handley Jr. of Medford completed the podium in the Suffolk Precast Chevy. Dylan Slepian of Dix Hills and Tom Rogers Jr. of Riverhead rounded off the top five.\n\nEver since moving his racing efforts to the Late Model class a few years back, Chris McGuire of Selden has not had the racing luck go his way. That all changed Saturday when he recorded his first 25-lap feature event win when for once the racing Gods smiled down on the former multi-time Charger winner. McGuire broke out to the early race lead but knew at some point Jeremy McDermott of Riverhead who started deep in the field would come calling. Indeed McDermott would come calling, taking the lead from McGuire but a series of two quick cautions one lap apart on lap 19 & 20 changed the race. Shawn Patrick his the wall off the fourth turn drawing a yellow on lap 19. On the ensuing restart McDermott's car did not fire off having some sort of issue allowing McGuire to reclaim the lead, perhaps things were starting to fall Chris's way. Kevin Metzger lopped his car on lap 20 drawing another yellow, it was at this time McDermott ducked to the pits with a tire that was going down. With just five laps to go the final restart of the race went off without a hitch with Chris McGuire nailing it in his Rock Tech Inc. machine for the long awaited win. For the third time in as many 2023 races Artie Pedersen III of Center Moriches was second, but this second place tally in the Unique Golf racer came after the crew changed a throw out bearing in the pits, Veteran Ray Minieri of Bay Shore was third in the Zaremba & Brown Construction Injury Lawyers Chevy.\n\nOpening night Eagle Auto Mall Crate Modified winner Chase Grennan of Glen Cove joined his brother Owen as a repeat winner in the Eagle Auto Mall Crate Modified ranks when he topped a non-stop 25-lap feature event. When the green flag waved Chase Grennan was able to take the early race advantage over Michael Berner who was in search of his first win of the young season. Owen Grennan marched his way to third and at the halfway point of the contest engaged Berner in a torrid battle for second as Chase started to pull away as the duo tussled for position. With no caution flags on the horizon Chase Grennan in the Black Forest Auto Chevy notched his 4th career win in a race that saw all 16 cars finish on the lead lap. Michael Berner of Patchogue was second in the Pro Diesel entry while Owen Grennan third in the Eastport Feeds machine.\n\nThe INEX Legend Race Cars had a rough go of it trying to run a 20-lap feature event, but numerous cautions slowed the race which was called official on lap 10 when a final caution flag waved. Brad Van Houten of Wading Riverhead earned his first win of the year. Van Houten broke to the race lead at the throw of the green but a multi car crash involving Ray Stulz, Eric Hersey, Riely O'Keefe and Ray Fitzgerald slowed the race on lap 2. When the race did resume it enjoyed a green flag run from lap 3 through 9 during which Van Houten and Joey Braun who came to second on lap 2 staged an exciting side by side fight for the lead. However, a series of yellow flags dragged things out on lap 9 and again on lap 10 before officials deemed the race official after the 30-minute time limit expired. Brad Van Houten in the Joe Ryan Race Cars machine, a team car to Jim Sylvester was declared the winner, his 6th career victory. Joey Braun of Manorville in the Uncle Carmine's Hot Peppers entry and Richie Davidowitz of East Moriches in the Freddie & Megan Kraft backed racer were second and third, Davidowitz was aiming for his fifth win in a row before the time limit expired.\n\nA few seasons back, Danny Pizzo of Holbrook decided to give racing another chance, so he went out and bought himself a Street Stock. After many trials and tribulations, crashes and breakdowns, most of which none of his doing, Danny finally broke through for his first career win Saturday in a 20-lap Street Stock event. Pizzo, who is funding his own racing effort in 2023 with no sponsorship displayed on his car broke to the early race lead and never looked back. While Danny had a fast car right off the truck in practice and qualifying, even he himself wondered what might creep up to prevent him from winning. Alas, nothing got in his way and Danny drove off to victory lane for the very first time. Rhett Fogg of Westhampton was runner-up in the McBetts Racing Engines Chevy, Dennis Kurras of Selden was an impressive third in the MKG Kitchen Design entry.\n\nA few weeks back NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour driver Eric Goodale announced he was dropping off the WMT as a full time driver to focus in part on his son Mason's Bock Auto INEX Bandolero Bandit racing effort. Saturday night the old \"apple falling not too far from the tree\" adage proved out when Mason, in just his third ever start won the 15-lap Bandits feature with proud Papa Eric looking on. Emmett Grattan broke to the early advantage leading the first four laps of the race. On lap 5 Mason Goodale came calling taking the lead from Grattan and never looking back to score a very popular win in the Riverhead Building Supply racer. Emmett Grattan of Southold was second in the IGA Market machine while last race winner Reid Halpin of Wading River was third in the Huntington Honda mount.\n\nRevenge can be a great motivator, just ask Will Sipala of Manorville who drove the JD Posillico Materials to the win in the 15-lap Bock Auto INEX Bandolero event. Last race out Sipala seemingly won the affair but had an unapproved restrictor plate placement on his car snatch his first career triumph away from him in post-race tech. The race got off to a shaky start with a first lap yellow slowing the contest. When the second attempt at starting the race was successful Will Sipala ducked to the inside of turn one to take the lead, a lead he'd not surrender earning him a long awaited first career win. 2022 Bandit champion Ben Morabito of Miller Place was runner-up in the 860 Motorsports Northeast racer while Cillian Tennant of Riverhead was third in the Miller & Caggiano Attorney At Law machine.\n\nChris Young Snaps Two Year Winless Streak with Riverhead Raceway NASCAR Modified Triumph Saturday\n\nBy Bob Finan\n\nJune 3rd, 2023\n\nSecond generation driver Chris Young of Calverton snapped a two plus year winless spell Saturday night when he powered his way to victory in the Riverhead Raceway 50-lap NASCAR Modified feature event. It was the third career win for Young who last won on October 31st of 2020.\n\nWhen the 5-lap tilt got underway high school senior Matt Brode jumped to the early lead with Owen Grennan and Dave Brigati it tow for the first lap, one lap later Grennan and Brigati swapped positions. With the race embarking on a long green flag run, Matt Brode was able to get away from Brigati in second while Chris Young moved by Grennan for third on lap 14. While Brode was clicking off laps up front and hoping for a caution free race, Young was busy reeling in Brigati for second. On lap 35 Young rolling the outside was able to work his way around Brigati for second. Just two laps later the scenario Brode did not want to see unfold did when the caution waved on lap 37 for a rare Dylan Slepian spin. The first attempt at restarting the race after the Slepian spin quickly went south as Chris Turbush pounded the wall in the first turn after contact.\n\nOnce the track was clear the double file restart with Brode to the inside and Young to the outside unfolded. Brode held serve for the first lap but on lap 39 Young rolled the top of the track to race his way into the lead. Once back to second Brode had a quick side by side battle with Tom Rogers Jr. for second. That duel ended quickly on lap 41 when Tom Rogers car suddenly dropped fluid in turns three and four with the entire field behind Tom piling in. Luckily all those caught up remained in the race, some after pit stops during an extensive clean up. The final restart of the race would again pit Young and Brode side by side, when the green flag reappeared for the final nine circuits Chris Young was able to remain out front to secure the long awaited return to victory lane.\n\n\"Between not winning since 2020, and all that speedy dry I feel like I've been to the desert\" Young quipped afterwards, \"this feels amazing, can't thank Sendlewski Architects and Bobby Mason of Ace's Landscaping enough for sticking by me\".\n\nMatt Brode of East Islip was runner-up in the Freightliner of Long Island Chevy while Dylan Slepian of Dix Hills rebounded nicely from his lap 37 spin for third in the Eastport Feeds Chevy. Michael Rutkoski of Mattituck and Jack Handley Jr. of Medford were fourth and fifth.\n\nDefending Eagle Auto Mall Crate Modified champion Owen Grennan of Glen Cove scored his second win of the season when he topped the 40-lap Miller Lite Triple Crown Series opener for the class. Starting from the pole Grennan quickly put his Eastport Feeds Chevy to the race lead with Sean Glennon in tow. Glennon, whose team burned the midnight oil to get damage repaired from a heavy crash a week earlier was all over the race leader as the race hit the halfway mark but a lap 27 caution for a Max Handley spin would change the complexion of the race. When the field was lined up and drivers chose at the cone Chase Grennan, younger brother to the race leader sat third and when the race resumed ducked under Glennon in a battle for second. Chase would pass Glennon for second on lap 31 but there would be no catching Owen who secured his 16th career victory. Chase settled for second in the Black Forest Auto entry while Sean Glennon of Northport was third in the R&R Brothers Electric Chevy.\n\nAlso kicking off their Miller Lite Triple Crown Series for 2023 were the Blunderbusts who went to post in a 30-lap contest with defending champion Cody Triola of Bay Shore scoring a milestone 10th career win. Brandon Hubbard led the first lap of the race before he was overtaken by Cody Triola, who quickly started building a very comfortable lead. That lead however was erased after a Brandon Hubbard spin on lap 12 drew a caution and bunched up the field. The ensuing restart pitted leader Triola and second place Jim Laird Jr. side by side. Laird, who raced his way to second on lap 10 hung tough on the outside of leader Triola for several laps before the Cesspool Pros driver eventually took sole possession of the lead and his second win of 2023. Jim Laird Jr. of Islip Terrace was runner-up in the Stakey's Pumpkin Farm Caprice while Brandon Hubbard of Mastic Beach rallied from his lap 12 spin for third in the United Exhaust Shop racer.\n\nAll-time leading Super Pro Truck winner Lou Maetsri of Deer Park notched his 38th career win Saturday in a 20-lap affair. Lou was a driver on a mission, wanting to end the two-race win streak of Jack Handley Jr. and wanting to win for one of his sponsors, former racer Jimmy Vaccaro of Goodfella's Auto Repair who recently underwent major surgery. Maestri wasted no time taking control of the race at the throw of the green and indeed would later have his mirror full of Hanldey later in the race. In the end however Lou Maestri would drive off to his first win of 2023 ending the two-for-two win streak of Handley, dedicating the win to Vaccaro afterwards. Mission accomplished. Jack Handley Jr. of Medford was runner-up in the River Walk Bar & Grill Toyota with \"The Bullet\" Ethan Brown of Floral Park in the FDNY Bravest Football Team Chevy.\n\nThe hottest driver on Long Island right now is \"Big Money\" Richie Davidowitz of East Moriches as he won his fourth INEX Legend Race Car feature in a row Saturday. Joey Braun broke to the race lead at the start with Jeff Farruggia in pursuit. Both young talents have been chasing Davidowitz in 2023 and were hoping to end his three-race win streak. Davidowitz, who started 6th made his way to third on lap 4, then settled in to hunt down Braun and Farruggia. On lap 10 Davidowitz made his way by Farruggia for second and two laps later executed a textbook crossover on Braun to take the race lead on lap 12. Once out in front Richie Davidowitz stayed there for his 29th career win in the Hampton Fleet Service entry. Jeff Farruggia Jr. of Riverhead was second in the Chris Mohr Landscaping mount while the ride of the night was turned in by Chase Van Houten of Wading River who finished third after starting 13th in his Terra Vite Vineyards racer.\n\nFor the second time this year Mike Mujsce Jr. of Hampton Bays topped the 4/6-Cylinder Git & Go Enduro in his East West Pest Control machine. Zach Tyler of Cutchogue was runner-up in the Miller & Caggiano Attorney-At-Law entry while John Palmeri of Lindenhurst was third in the J&J Towing mount.\n\nKevin Rommeney of East Meadow held off brother Michael Rommeney to win the School Bus Oval Race in his North Fork Sanitation bus.\n\nArtie Pedersen III & Jarrod Hayes Score Riverhead Raceway Miller Lite Triple Crown Series Wins Saturday\n\nBy Bob Finan\n\nJuly 22nd, 2023\n\nThe weather was perfect, the grandstands full for a night of NASCAR Advance Auto Parts Weekly Series Racing at Riverhead Raceway and the drivers delivered. Artie Pedersen III of Center Moriches scored his second straight Late Model victory of the season in a 40-lap affair. Jarrod Hayes of Calverton also made it two in a row when he topped a non-stop 30-lap Street Stock feature. Both divisions contested their second race of the 2023 Miller Lite Triple Crown Series.\n\nBrandon Turbush and Artie Pedersen III by virtue of heat race passing points made up the Late Model front row and like he did couple weeks back Artie Pedersen III got a great launch at the throw of the green. Turbush filed in behind leader Pedersen, but Brandon's race took a turn for the worse when he spun in turn four on lap 4 after Jeremy McDermott made contact. McDermott was sent to the rear for his role in the incident. When the green waved after the caution flag period Pedersen remained the leader with former two-time champion Kevin Metzger in tow. Metzger chased Pedersen until lap 26 when McDermott slipped by to the outside up the backstretch after picking his way back through traffic. By the time Jeremy raced his way to second, Pedersen had built himself a comfortable lead in the Unique Golf machine and as much as McDermott chipped away at the advantage Artie Pedersen III would again prevail. McDermott of Riverhead was runner-up in the Eastport Feeds Chevy while Kevin Metzger of Massapequa finished on the podium in third with his Complete Well & Pump Toyota.\n\nClearly, Jarrod Hayes and his North Fork Sanitation Street Stock team did not have the start to their 2023 campaign they would have liked. But Hayes is making up for lost time and Saturday won a non-stop 30-lap main event for his second win in a row. When the race got underway Hayes motored out front, showing for the second race in a row the local speed merchant had the car to beat. McCormack ran second early on but at the halfway mark had to contend with defending champion Dave Antos who came calling. Antos made his bid for second payoff on lap 19 passing McCormack. However, without the aid of a caution and ensuing double file restart Antos would not be able to reel in the race leader. At the finish Jarrod Hayes again made his way to the winner's circle while Antos of Lindenhurst settled for runner-up money in the JTEC Electric Chevy. McCormack of Holbrook was third at the conclusion in his Robo Car Wash entry.\n\nIn 2022 Ken Hyde Jr. of Medford lost a Figure Eight win just feet from the start/finish line after a hard his at the crossover. Fast forward to 2023 and Hyde running and ready to settle for 5th Saturday suddenly saw the seas part in the final turn of the race handing him his second consecutive win. After Joe Warren Jr. led lap 1, Artie Pedersen III, mere minutes after his Late Model win took the lead on lap 2. Pedersen as he did in the LM race built up a fairly comfortable lead, well so he thought. The chaotic last lap saw AP3 trying to lap a slower car. After taking the white Artie closed too fast on that lapped car heading into the third turn. Ryan Warren, brother Allan Pedersen and Uncle Scott Pedersen were all caught up in the momentary chaos. That allowed Ken Hyde Jr. in his Brigandi Brothers Automotive Chevy to part the seas and drive from fifth to victory lane. The unlikely win is the 13th of Hyde's career tying him for 12th all-time with \"The Dean\" Bill Steen. Somehow, someway Ryan Warren of Ridge made it through the last lap excitement for second in the Craftsman Fence Chevy, while defending champion Scott Pedersen of Shirley did likewise for third in the Northeastern Office Equipment Cadillac.\n\nThere are times in racing where the sport challenges a race team. Such has been the case for \"Hubcap\" Brandon Hubbard of Mastic but Saturday the second-generation talent rose above to win a non-stop 20-lap Blunderbust feature. Prior to the win, Brandon and team have fought mechanical issues during the first four races of the season. Armed with a front row start for the race, Hubbard took advantage breaking out front at the drop of the green. Jarrett Campbell chased Hubbard over the first half of the race before he was overtaken by defending champion Cody Triola at the halfway mark. Getting to second was the first challenge Triola faced in the fast-paced race, getting to leader Hubbard would be another. Wanting to reward his hard-working family for their efforts, there would be no catching Brandon Hubbard in his United Exhaust Shop machine as he earned his third career win. Cody Triola of Bay Shore was making progress but had to be content with second in the Cesspool Pros entry, Eddie Diaz of Centereach was third in the Gramercy Group machine.\n\nJoe Warren Jr. of Ridge reached a milestone Saturday when he won a non-stop 20-lap Mini Stock feature, the 10th of his career, second of the year. Joe Cooke Jr. paced the race early on with former champion Paul Wojcik applying the pressure. Wojcik offered up numerous challenges to Cooke for the lead but each time the leader was able to thwart those efforts. As the laps clicked off Wojcik grew frustrated with how Cooke was holding him off and on lap 14 contact was made. While neither car spun, momentum was broken and Joe Warren Jr. in his Schmidt's Market Cavalier got a two for one, driving from third to victory lane. Andrew Farnham of Baldwin was runner-up in the Matlach Motorsports Honda, while James O'Connell of Middle Island was third in the Walls of Fame racer. It was O'Connell's first start of the season.\n\nDoing double duty on the night paid off for Jarrett Campbell of Yaphank when he won an exciting 43-lap Truck Enduro. Wanting to remember and celebrate the life of Kimberly Putzu-Midgett, longtime companion of former champion Don Nelson who sadly passed away suddenly earlier in the month, the 43-lap distance was run in her honor. The race boiled down to a trio of veteran drivers vying for the win, Jarrett Campbell, Bobby Pease Sr. and Don Nelson. Pease showed the way for the first nine circuits before Campbell got by. Ironically enough Pease on the 40th lap, normally the final lap took the lead back from Campbell, while Nelson watched it all from a close third. Pease led the 41st lap before Campbell came roaring back to take the lead for good on lap 42 in his Rock Financial Chevy S-10. Bobby Pease of Medford was third in the Fit Spot Gym truck while Don Nelson of Ricky Point was third in the Jefferson Animal Hospital Chevy.\n\nTested tough Enduro veteran Donald \"Woot\" Lawrence of Southampton scored the victory in the 8-Cylinder Enduro. Lawrence, the 2022 Truck Enduro champion has focused his driving effort in the class that started the Enduro craze at Riverhead in May of 1986, the 8-Cylinders. The race itself was old school with cars spinning, fluid being laid down on the racing surface making just getting around the track a chore. Greg Harris of Riverhead had the lead of the race and seemed like he was the man to beat until a car spun in front of him. The contact that ensued flattened the right front of Harris ending his race. That moved the Travers.com Camaro of Woot Lawrence out front late in the race, Lawrence started the tilt from 18th and scored the popular win.\n\nJack Handley Jr., Jarrod Hayes & Tom Puccia Share Riverhead Raceway Victory Lane Saturday Night\n\nBy Bob Finan\n\nJuly 15th, 2023\n\nA large and enthusiastic crowd gathered Saturday evening at Riverhead Raceway to witness another popular School Bus Demolition Derby. Prior to Michael \"Cheesebox\" Rommeney of Bohemia winning the Bus Demo, Jack Handley Jr. (Super Pro Trucks), Jarrod Hayes (Street Stocks) and Tom Puccia of Shirley (Mini Stocks) scored NASCAR Advance Auto Parts Weekly Series victories.\n\nThe Super Pro Trucks ran the second in their Miller Lite Triple Crown Series with Matt Triola and Jack Handley making up the front row for the 30-lap tilt. Triola, who won for the first time in the most recent Super Pro Truck event and Handley were even at the throw of the green, but it didn't take long for Handley, seeking his third win of 2023 to power out front just before the tandem started lap 2. Once out in clean air Handley was able to keep his East End Builders Toyota out front, while unfortunately Triola's race would later end on the back of the wrecker. At the finish Jack Handley Jr. scored his 19th career Super Pro Truck victory further padding his championship pints lead. Defending champion Sean Glennon of Northport was runner-up in the LTE Drainage Chevy with Lou Maestri of Deer Park third in the Hunter Business School machine.\n\nJarrod Hayes of Calverton took full advantage of the pole starting position for the 20-lap Street Stock main event to notch his first career victory. Hayes, who has compiled victories in the Blunderbusts (5) and Late Models (20) at Riverhead, got a great launch on the initial start to take command of the race over Brian McCormack. The race was only slowed by one caution flag and once again Hayes wheeling the North Fork Sanitation owned Chevy got the measure of challenger McCormack. Jarrod Hayes would lead the rest of the way to score the victory just one week after his son Silas won the Kids Big Wheel race at the track. The Robo Car Wash Monte Carlo of Brian McCormack of Holbrook was second with defending champion Dave Antos of Lindenhurst third in the EP Milling & Sweeping Chevy.\n\nThe Mini Stocks also ran their second race of the Miller Lite Triple Crown Series, a 30-lap affair won by Tom Puccia of Shirley. Puccia, a heavy equipment operator by trade made the decision to bring his Mini Stock out for the first time in 2023 payoff. Former champion CJ Zukowski paced the race for the first 9 circuits before Tom Puccia ducked under him exiting turn four to take the lead to start lap 10. Once in the lead, Tom Puccia was able to stay there in his Ferrandino & Sons Contracting racer, earning his 7th career win. CJ Zukowski of Riverhead crossed the line second but came up light at the scale so runner-up honors went to Paul Wojcik of Patchogue in the RFG Electrical Contracting entry while defending champion Andrew Farnham of Baldwin was third in the Matlach Motorsports Honda.\n\nIn the 15-lap Bock Auto INEX Bandolero Bandit feature Reid Halpin of Wading River executed a game plan of controlled aggression to come from 6th starting position to win his second feature of 2023. Early on Aria Ligon led the way for the first three laps, chased by Emmett Grattan and Halpin who made a bold move at the start of the race to quickly come to third on the first lap. Two laps later, committed to running the outside lane, Halpin went four wide with Ligon and two lapped cars exiting the second corner to move to the race lead. Once out front in the Steven's 112 Ford Bandit, Halpin,10, did not dial back on his driving style leading him to the winner's circle for the second time in four races. Kix Bock of East Hampton made a last lap pass in his Bock Auto entry to claim second over Emmett Grattan of Southold who settled for third in his IGA Food Market of Southold machine.\n\nJust days removed from victory during the Cook Out Summer Shootout Series at Charlotte Motor Speedway, Ben Morabito of Miller Place continued his winning ways in the Bick Auto Bandolero Outlaws capturing their 15-lap main event. Phillip Alaimo broke to the early race lead and over the first 8 laps of the contest appeared headed for victory lane. However Morabito, who like Halpin on the Bandits started deep in the field was on the march. Cillian Tennant chased Alaimo over the first 4 circuits before being involved in a heavy crash in turn two with Will Sipala. Once the field was reset Tucker Bock chased leader Alaimo until the 8th lap when Morabito decided it was go time. Within a lap Morabito, steering the 860 Motorsports Northeast Outlaw broke to the race lead. However, Alaimo was not finished with his quest for victory. Phillip draped himself onto Ben's back bumper hoping to reclaim the lead. In the end Morabito would post his 6th career win and has now won three of the four races contested to date. Alaimo of Miller Place was runner-up in the Alaimo Contracting mount. Jayden Owens-Bader of Selden collected a career best third place finish in his Robert's Express Oil Outlaw.\n\nTypically, if you hear or read about a driver spinning out a half dozen times during a race, the assumption is that driver had a horrible night. Such was not the case for John Palmeri of Lindenhurst who survived hard early race contact that smashed in his driver's door and damaging John's front suspension as well. Despite spinning out no less than six times while leading the 4/6-Cylinder Gut & Go Enduro, John Palmeri in the J&J Towing entry won the 50-lap feature event. Within minutes of the win broadcast on Flo Racing, social media lit up with cries for some car owners to give Palmeri, a second-generation driver a NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour. Eagle Chevrolet Crate Modified driver AJ DeSantis of Yaphank closed in after Palmeri's last spin and nearly edged John out for the win but finished second in the Mastic Wheel Alignment car. Joey Palmeri of Lindenhurst was third in the JP Automotive entry.\n\nAfter 16 Years, JR Bertuccio Returns to Riverhead Modified Victory Lane, Chase Grennan Rules Crate Mod 100\n\nBy Bob Finan\n\nJuly 8th, 2023\n\nNearly 16 years to the day, JR Bertuccio of Centereach returned to NASCAR Modified victory lane Saturday when he led wire to wire in a non-stop 50-lap feature at Riverhead Raceway. Rising driving talent Chase Grennan of Glen Cove scored a clean sweep in the Eagle Chevrolet 100 for the Crate Modifieds for his third win of 2023 after setting fast time in qualifying.\n\nStarting from the front row, former champion JR Bertuccio took full advantage breaking out to the early lead over Michael Rutkoski. With a multi car battle forming for third between Chris Young, Justin Brown, John Beatty Jr. and Mark Stewart the lead tandem of Bertuccio and Rutkoski were able to distance themselves from the pack. During the middle portion Bertuccio set a torrid pace and was able to put some asphalt between he and Rutkoski.\n\nHowever, with 10-laps remaining in the contest either the challenger Rutkoski hit another gear and starting moving closer to Bertuccio, or JR's pace fell off. Being able to pull within a care length or two of Bertuccio would be one thing, getting close enough to mount a challenge quite another. Both drivers were equally as hungry for their first win of the campaign.\n\nDespite seeing his large lead shrink in the final 10 circuits, JR Bertuccio for the first time since July 14th, 2007 sat in Riverhead Raceway victory lane. During the Flo broadcast of the race it was disclosed the Gershow Motorsports team may have made the winning decision at the race shop during the week. Bertuccio had been running a \"built\" motor up until this week with the team deciding install a Spec Engine for Saturday. \"Feels great to be back in victory lane\" JR offered post-race, \"We've had some struggles, but we were fast tonight, can't thank my Dad enough\". The win was the 29th of Bertuccio's career tying him with Kyle Soper for 11th all-time. Next win evens JR with Mike Ewanitsko for 10th.\n\nMichael Rutkoski of Mattituck was second in the Buzz Chew Chevrolet-Cadillac machine, Chris Young of Calverton was third in his Ace's Landscaping racer. Justin Brown of Manorville and Mark Stewart of Riverhead completed the top five.\n\nThe Eagle Chevrolet Crate Modifieds ran their annual 100-lapper Saturday and taking center stage was teenage sensation Chase Grennan of Glen Cove. Grennan topped the 20-cars in qualifying with a lap of 12.359, not far off Dave Brigati's track record of 12.211 set in 2019. When the green light winked on Chase zipped right out front chased over the first three laps by Kyle Elwood. Lap 4 found Chase's older brother and defending champion Owen pass Ellwood for second. Over the next 25-laps Owen ran second to his sibling but as the race moved along caution free his pace started to fall of with Ellwood running behind him. Smelling blood in the water Ellwood was able to repass Owen Grennan for second on lap 29.\n\nJust moments after losing second, Owen's night took a dramatic turn for the worse when his car quit running with a faulty fuel pump stalling just shy of the third turn gate drawing the first stoppage and only stoppage of the race. When the race resumed Kyle Ellwood was draped all over the rear spoiler of Chase Grennan's rear spoiler. It appeared over the middle to final stages of the race Kyle was comfortable letting the young lion set the pace, However when it was go time for Ellwood, Grennan was able to pick up his pace and rive off to his 5th career Crate Modified victory. The triumph also moves Chase to the championship lead. Kyle Ellwood of Riverhead was runner-up in the Rosemar Industries Spafco. Terry Stiles of Rocky Point worked hard to score third place money in his Van Buren Auto Allison Transmissions Chevy, Stiles, AJ Desantis of Yaphank and most recent winner Michael Berner of Patchogue diced for the duration for the position. DeSantis and Berner were fourth and fifth\n\nLate Model car owner Jennifer JoAnn was at wits end in the sport and read"
