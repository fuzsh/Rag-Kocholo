        "text": "About Bellarmine\n\nBellarmine Preparatory School is a Catholic college preparatory school in the Jesuit tradition of education. Under the inspired leadership of the Jesuits, the school was founded in 1928 in a lone building on what was then a remote hilltop overlooking the young city of Tacoma – a site it still occupies today.\n\nAs a Jesuit school, we are not only dedicated to academic excellence, but the development and care for the whole person. We are devoted to preparing young men and women for success in college and beyond, and to instill in them a desire and passion to lead and serve others in the communities, careers and organizations they will go forth to.\n\nStudent Experience\n\nA Catholic high school in the Jesuit tradition of education, Bellarmine seeks to graduate students who are truly ‘men and women for and with others.’ We do this by striving to create an environment that fosters a call to human excellence, through a rigorous college prep curriculum, active athletic and extra-curricular programs, and a strong spiritual development program that is woven into the fabric of school life from freshman admission to senior graduation.\n\nFaith and Service\n\nAs a Catholic school, we believe that Jesus' message is that God loves us, calls us to Him, and that all people are brothers and sisters. This provides a challenge for us. The call to be a follower of Christ, through the Church community and in service to the world, is one of continual conversion. It is our hope and prayer that Bellarmine, with the help of God's grace, is a place where this can begin and continue."
