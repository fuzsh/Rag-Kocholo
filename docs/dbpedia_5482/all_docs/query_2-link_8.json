and\n\nWhereas, Knowledge in the fields of science and technology has exploded in the last several decades; and\n\nWhereas, The literacy of the general public in science and technology in the United States is poor, at best; and\n\nWhereas, Thomas Jefferson wrote that the ultimate powers of society reside with the people, and if the people are not informed enough to exercise those powers, the remedy is not to take the powers from them, but to inform them; and\n\nWhereas, Learning is an ongoing and lifelong process that takes place both inside and outside the walls of educational institutions, and effective learning includes participation and action, I do and I understand; and\n\nWhereas, Hands-on, interactive science museums have proven to be excellent places for people of all ages, levels of understanding and interests to learn science and technology by doing; and\n\nWhereas, The number of science museums has tripled during the last decade, and currently there are approximately 300 science museums in the United States; and\n\nWhereas, In the United States, science museums serve nearly 115 million people every year, including 13 million school children; and\n\nWhereas, The Desert Space Station will be a nonprofit, 92,000-square foot, hands-on, interactive science museum where children and adults can explore and experience state-of-the-art and futuristic science and technology exhibits and presentations associated with Nevadas unique spaces, including outer space, air space and land space; and\n\nWhereas, The expected benefits of the Desert Space Station will be the stimulation of interest in science and technology, the enhancement of science and math education in the region, the promotion of a better understanding of the natural environment of the Mojave Desert, and an appreciation of Death Valley National Park and Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge; and\n\nWhereas, Additional benefits will be a wider understanding of renewable energy opportunities and technologies, a greater knowledge of Nevadas mineral resources and the mining of those resources, the promotion of the understanding and appreciation of past, present and future federal activities at the Nevada Test Site, the Nellis Air Force Gunnery Range and the Fallon Naval Air Station and the stimulation of economic development and diversification in rural Nevada; now, therefore, be it\n\nResolved by the assembly of the State of Nevada, the Senate Concurring, That the members of the 70th session of the Nevada Legislature do hereby commend the goals of the Board of Trustees for the Desert Space Station and express enthusiastic support for the Desert Space Station; and be it further\n\nResolved, That the Nevada Legislature anticipates that the Desert Space Station will be a must-see attraction in the West, a source of pride for Nevadans and a catalyst for learning by people of all ages and backgrounds; and be it further\n\nResolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and transmit a copy of this resolution to Governor Kenny C. Guinn and the Board of Trustees for the Desert Space Station, and be it further\n\nResolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon passage and approval.\n\nSenator McGinness moved the adoption of the resolution.\n\nRemarks by Senator McGinness.\n\nSenator McGinness requested that his remarks be entered in the Journal.\n\nThank you, Madam President. It is my pleasure to support this resolution. I have distributed to everyones desk a Desert Space Station postcard, this is not an alien plot as you may have thought, but on one side of the postcard is a picture of the space station model and on the other side is the information on the science museum. Madam President this is going to be the tourism location in southern Nevada they will forget about the Ballagio and Mandalay Bay, etc. We are going to be able to explore the outer air and land spaces in Nevada, and as you read a 92,000 square foot 4 level interactive discovery center. It is going to feature about 40,000 square feet of indoor space for state-of-the-art and futuristic science and technology exhibits. The IMAX Theater and Digistar planetarium, a interactive theater, observatory, an Area 51 theme restaurant, discovery store, meeting rooms, and a whole lot more. The number of science museums has tripled in the last decade in the United States. There are about 300 science museums in the United States and this one will give children and adults hands on interactive science exhibits, state-of-the-art and futuristic science and technology exhibits associated with Nevadas unique spaces. This is also part of that high-tech corridor that we talked about in Assembly Bill No. 528 this session that runs from Tonopah to Indian Springs, this is going to be the centerpiece. It is about an hour drive from Las Vegas, and a 40-minute drive from Death Valley. The National Park Service indicates that there are 1.5 million visitors to Death Valley and by all indication they figure about 40-percent of those visitors will make the trip to this station. There is an exhibit out in the entry way just past the majority leaders offices, we understand that it will be there the rest of the session, please stop by and see it. The center will also give everyone a greater knowledge of Nevadas mineral resources. Promote the understanding and appreciation of the past, present and future federal activities at the test sites of Nellis Air Force Gunnery Range and the Fallon Air Station and the stimulation of economic development and diversification in rural Nevada. I encourage your support.\n\nResolution adopted.\n\nSenator Raggio moved that for the remainder of the session, all bills and joint resolutions reported out of committee without amendments be declared emergency measures and placed on the General File for the next legislative day.\n\nSenator Raggio requested that his remarks be entered in the Journal.\n\nThis will eliminate second reading for those bills or resolutions with the recommendation of Do pass and will move the process up by one day.\n\nMotion carried.\n\nSenator Raggio moved that for the remainder of the session that all bills/resolutions reported out of committee with amendments be immediately placed on the second reading/resolution files, time permitting.\n\nSenator Raggio requested that his remarks be entered in the Journal.\n\nThis will also move the process up by one day.\n\nMotion carried.\n\nSenator Raggio moved that for the remainder of the session, all legislation passed or adopted be immediately transmitted to the Assembly, time permitting.\n\nSenator Raggio requested that his remarks be entered in the Journal.\n\nThis motion will move bills and messages over to the Assembly for their consideration on the same day and will speed up the process by one day.\n\nThe only suspensions we will have to do on Friday or Saturday, is to have all bills/resolutions reported out of committee with a Do Pass or returned from reprint be declared emergency measures and immediately placed on the appropriate files for final passage.\n\nMotion carried.\n\nAssembly Concurrent Resolution No. 23.\n\nSenator Rawson moved the adoption of the resolution.\n\nRemarks by Senator Rawson.\n\nResolution adopted.\n\nSenator Raggio moved that vetoed Senate Bill No. 182 of the 70th Session be made a Special Order of Business for Wednesday, May 26, 1999 at 4:30 p.m.\n\nRemarks by Senator Raggio.\n\nMotion carried.\n\nSenator Rawson moved that the Senate recess subject to the call of the Chair.\n\nMotion carried.\n\nSenate in recess at 12:38 p.m.\n\nSENATE IN SESSION\n\nAt 1:10 p.m.\n\nPresident Hunt presiding.\n\nQuorum present.\n\nINTRODUCTION, FIRST READING AND REFERENCE\n\nBy the Committee on Finance:\n\nSenate Bill No. 550AN ACT relating to public financial administration; creating the division of internal audits of the department of administration and the executive branch audit committee; providing the powers and duties of the new division and committee; making an appropriation; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.\n\nSenator Raggio moved that the bill be referred to the Committee on Finance.\n\nMotion carried.\n\nUNFINISHED BUSINESS\n\nConsideration of Assembly Amendments\n\nSenate Bill No. 31.\n\nThe following Assembly amendment was read:\n\nAmendment No. 867.\n\nAmend section 1, page 1, by deleting lines 6 and 7 and inserting:\n\n[Third] Martin Luther King, Jr.s birthday is on January 15 but is to be observed on the third Monday in January [(Martin Luther King, Jr.s Birthday)\n\nThird] Washingtons birthday is on February 22 but is to be observed on the third Monday in February [(Washingtons birthday)].\n\nAmend section 1, page 1, by deleting line 11 and inserting: Nevada Day is October 31 [(Nevada Day)] but is to be observed on the last Friday in October.\n\nAmend sec. 3, pages 2 and 3, by deleting line 39 on page 2 and lines 1 through 3 on page 3, and inserting: holiday pursuant to NRS 236.015 .

The Assembly substantially tightened up the exemptions included in Senate Bill No. 521. It now provides that a taxpayer may now charge a fee for the public display of fine art and that anytime the display is opened and a fee is being charged, the taxpayer has to offer 50-percent discount to Nevada residents. The display must be made available for student tours by appointment and without charge for at least 60 days during the entire year. This is an increase from 20 days. The taxes are due to the extent of any net revenue the taxpayer earns from those fees after deducting the direct cost of owning and exhibiting the art and the cost of any educational programs associated with the display.\n\nThe taxpayer is eligible for a credit against any taxes otherwise due for donations to the State Arts Council, the Fund for Historical Preservation or the Nature or Childrens Museum. Previously it was just a charitable organization and the Assembly put in a specific nonprofit charitable organizations that the donations must go to. The taxpayer must provide a free copy of a poster depicting the fine art on display to a public schools, private schools or even home schooled students. In addition, they established certain time limits between the purchase of the art and the period therein which it must be displayed to receive the exemptions. It also revises the definition of fine art for public display to specifically exclude certain items, define such terms as direct cost of owning and exhibiting the fine art, net revenue, public display, defines pupil and student to include all children in grades kindergarten through twelfth grade including home schoolers and students in post-secondary art classes. Finally, it makes a number of mechanical changes that makes it easier for the assessor and the Department of Taxation to administer the exemption and for a taxpayer to comply with the requirements of the bill.\n\nSenator Neal:\n\nI rise in opposition to the concurrence in this amendment to Senate Bill No. 521. When I first read the amendment, it looked good and sounded good. When I realized that Mr. Harvey Whittemore had written the amendment, I decided I had better take another look at it to see exactly what it was doing and how it was going to accomplish these things which appeared to be good. I read the amendment which says that a taxpayer may collect an admission fee for the exhibition of fine art, otherwise exempt from taxation pursuant to NRS 361.068 which is a personal property tax. The taxpayer offers to Nevada residents a 50-percent discount from any admission charges. This sounds good. Then on the front page of the amendment it says, except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, if the taxpayer collecting a fee for the exhibition of the fine art, otherwise exempt from taxation, pursuant to NRS 361.068 the exemption pertaining to the art for the fiscal year must be reduced by the net revenue derived by the taxpayer for that fiscal year. This does sound good. Then I turned to page 2 of the amendment and began to look at subsection 5. If a taxpayer qualifies for and avails himself of both the exemption from the taxation provided by NRS 361.068 and 374.291, the reduction of the exemption by the net revenue derived by the taxpayer as required pursuant to subsection 2 of this section and subsection 2 of section 6 of this act must be carried out in a manner that the total revenue derived by the taxpayer is first applied to reduce the exemption provided pursuant to NRS 374.291. It then goes on to say that if the net revenue exceeds the amount of the exemption provided pursuant to NRS 374.291 the remaining net revenue must be applied to reduce the exemption provided pursuant to NRS 361.06. It then goes on to say that if the net revenue is less than or equal to the exemption provided pursuant to NRS 374.291 for the fiscal , the exemption provided in that NRS 361 Chapter must not be reduced. This sounds good. When I looked at that, I said that the Assembly had done an excellent job in trying to correct a bad bill that we had passed. Then it occurred to me that we had to read that subsection 4 of section 2 which grants a credit. When I saw that language which said that the taxpayer is required to pay a tax resulting from the operation of this section may receive a credit against a tax for any donation made by the taxpayer to the State Art Council, Division of Museums and History Dedicated Trust established pursuant to NRS 381.0031, a museum that provides an exhibit specially related to the nature of the museum that provides exhibits specifically related to children. It says that if the taxpayer had filed these particular statements, he/she may receive a credit. That language may and we have been taught and been trained in this session that anytime we see may we should look at it as being permissive. I was a little bit confused by this may because when I examined this as to permitting this particular credit, I asked my good friend and lawyer here to take a look at it. He is new, out of law school and has not been practicing too long. The law would still be fresh in his mind. He looked at it and said, Joe, that is permissive. I said, well, you better look at that language again. Uh uh, it is not permissive. You know that our lobbyist, Mr. Whittemore, is a brilliant individual when it comes to playing gymnastics with the English language and especially so when he puts into law that may there does not apply to the tax department. It applies to the taxpayer in terms of granting that taxpayer a right to receive that credit. When you look at this bill and the amendment that the Assembly has put into this which is probably one of the reasons why Mr. Whittemore was campaigning so hard was because he did not want this bill to go back to the Assembly because they have been snookered into voting for this. I believe they got 32 votes. They did not understand what had happened here. When you have that language and set out these other things in which these credits can be taken from and you look at this in relationship to the amendment in terms of how the net revenue can be applied to the exemption in terms of reducing the exemption, then you go back and look at the credit. If I, the taxpayer, have a right to get that credit, that means that I go out and give the Museum of History a little bit of money equal to whatever that exemption is. If it is over that and the net revenue is over the exemption, then I just go out and give money to the Museum of Arts and the Museum of History. Then, as a credit, I can take that money back a dollar for a dollar. What we have done here is to take a bad bill and made it worse. This man has not given up anything in this piece of legislation, not one dime which he cannot recover. That may language, if you go back and look at our NRS 0.025, the use of may. Let me just read it to you. This is what I thought about when I saw that. That may seems kind of strange to me. I asked the question as to if there is a law out there or a case that used may in the sense that it is being used here. You have to ask these questions when you are dealing with Mr. Whittemores legislation. So, I asked the question. It was in our statutes, 0.025, the use of may. May confers a right and a privilege for power. That is the definition of may in our NRS so when we see may here, it does not go to the Tax Department in terms of granting a credit. It goes to the taxpayer that he has the authority as well as the right to use that credit to offset anything that he would have contributed to the Museum of Art or these other agencies that are listed such as the Art Council. I know that the Art Council would jump up and down about this, but I dont think they will get a dime. What is happening if it is allowed as we put into the statute which says that the taxpayer may collect an admission fee. The admission fee for this one particular taxpayer is $12 per person. Presuming that he is allowed to take these other deductions which are written into this bill, the cost of the art is for instance $50 and he got $50 back, he would not have to pay a dime because the law says that if it is even with that which is exempted, meaning the net revenue and is even with the exemption, he does not pay anything. It also says that he cannot go beyond zero. If you have $150 with $50 that he can apply to the reduction of the exemption but if you have a credit you can go out and give $50 to the Museum of History, then where am I? There would be no tax. This is what this amendment has done. They have taken a bad bill and made it worse.\n\nI must admit that when you deal with Harvey you have to think because he is going to take you around and around, and he knows his job very well. I told him that if I had to do something in this Legislature, I would hire you because I know that you would get it through. One of the things that Harvey mentioned to me about the credit was that he did not know that I would pick that up. Well, when you deal with Mr. Harvey Whittemore in language you almost have to question every word and the usage of that word. Mr. Harvey has taken everything that Mr. Wynn requested, twisted it around and put it into an amendment with the Assembly passing it and made all of us look good until you begin to read the language and research the language. Then you find out that what you now have is everything that Mr. Steve Wynn asked for in this bill. It is put in such a fashion that the average individual would not just pick this up and read it and find this out because you have to read it in conjunction with other things and other parts of the law.\n\nThat 0.025 was not listed in here. It was only because I was curious with looking for a case law to find out what may was that I was able to come up with this. I went and asked other people to take a look at this in subsection 4 of section 2, line 3 to 13 on page 2 of the second reprint, subsection 4 of this act, lines 15 to 25 on page 9, both provide that the taxpayer may receive a credit against the taxes for donation made to the listed organizations. I believe that these provisions do give the taxpayer the right to a credit against any tax that from admission fees that could have net revenue to subtract from that revenue. NRS 0.025 states that the use of the term may confers a right, privilege of power and based upon the rules of statutory construction, this is what it does. Ladies and gentlemen, I know that you are set to vote this out of here and pass it. We just want to give you a lesson on how these things can be used against you. I hope that the Assembly is listening because they were led down the primrose path on this one and did not see what was happening to them. The school kids in here that I heard were mentioned about the 20 days to 60 days for kids, but they are only open for five hours a day under this amendment. They must ask for an appointment. It is by appointment only. They dont just make the request. They have to get an appointment. You know when you ask for an appointment, it depends upon what your time schedule is whether or not you are granted an appointment. The school kids may not get what seems to be represented by this amendment.\n\nIf you want to give the taxpayer that is represented here this exemption, just come right out and give it to him. If you want to give him the exemption that is represented here, NRS 374.291, you know what that is. It is an exemption from the local school support taxes. I want you to know about this. NRS 374.291 is the local school support taxes. You are taking money from children. This bill, when passed in the Senate, would mean approximately $15 million of local money coming from this section of the law. Think about it. When your schools are being condemned and your kids are calling for library books and for transportation, think about it and what you have done in terms of granting this exemption. Now this exemption is not all. We have concentrated mainly on one person, Steve Wynn who brought this bill here a session ago.\n\nLet me tell you, you have the Venetian Hotel that is being built in Las Vegas, and it can qualify for these same exemptions. Every hotel that you have in Nevada and others besides can qualify for these same exemptions. My dear friend and colleague, Senator OConnell, had this studied and went out and looked at these exemptions. They came back with a report of the exemptions that we have already granted, $667 million each year in exemptions. We are now adding to those exemptions. What does that mean? It means that as this Legislature has seen during this session that we are going to be fighting to try and obtain money to build schools and educate our children because once you give exemptions that are over 30 percent of your general fund, you are going to have to find that money from somewhere else to try to take care of the needs of this State. We have done it this session. We have raised some fees and have tried to cut some people short. We raised bonding capacity trying to meet these meets. Yet, we cannot see that when we pass such legislation what it is doing to the children in the future of education in this State. Think about that when you vote yea to the concurrence on this.\n\nSenator Schneider:\n\nLet me first make a statement that my wife is on the Nevada State Council of the Arts and is a director on that board. If there is money coming back she will be allocating to the different art organizations of this State. I do not see that there is any conflict on this matter for me. Also, I stand in opposition to what my good friend, the Senator from North Las Vegas has said. I do not see the $15 million tax break that is going on. In this case, the Bellagio Hotel is an art dealer and they do not pay the sales tax. Actually, our development office said that with the money spent on this development, we actually will receive $8 million more in tax revenue just from this type of development. I think that is a big plus to our state revenues. Also, we talk about education here. We do not have any art in this State. I checked and found that we have not paid any tax dollars on art coming into this State and do not have any really good collections. I think that this is such a benefit to our children of this State. The Assembly did a good thing in upping it to a minimum of 60 days. They do have to make a reservation because those classes are going in with their teachers to view this art. This is a very good thing. There is curriculum that will be developed for the Clark County School District at the expense of the Bellagio Resort. I think this is a great thing for our State. I would like the 253 Committee to look at this over the next biennium and really analyze it and tell us what we have and how much of a bang for the buck we have here. I think this is a tremendous investment. As I said before, this is a public/private partnership. We have invested no money. Our partner has invested almost $400 million. The hotel has said that they will not take a profit on any of this. All profits will be turned over to the state arts. I think this is just a tremendous opportunity for us. We need to encourage this. I would like us to analyze this over the interim. I think it will show that this is a huge, huge advantage for our State over other states.\n\nSenator McGinness:\n\nI would like to clarify a couple of things. This is not a whole lot different than when you pay your taxes. If you have a donation to a charitable organization, you can deduct it from your income taxes. You dont pay the tax. That is exactly what happens if there are any revenues from the operation of this facility, if they are not donated, the taxpayer would have to pay the taxes on those. The reference to NRS 374.291 and the exemptions from that, that is the entire sales tax package. We can exempt all of those sales taxes except the two percent that was put in by the voters in the 1950s. That does include some school support tax but there are other taxes in there as well for county operations. The $15 million that was talked about as being lost from sales tax, that was not coming to the State. People that were collecting pieces of fine art were not taking possession of them in Nevada. They were taking possession of them in Oregon or other states that gave exemptions for such things. If somebody did buy a $5 million piece of art, the only way the tax department would know to collect would be if the purchaser called them up and said to come over and collect the taxes on this. It was not happening. There has been and will be a net revenue to the State in addition to the donations to the charitable organization.\n\nSenator ODonnell:\n\nThank you, Madam President. I have noticed over the last five to ten years this adversarial attitude towards casinos and the economic engine that drives this State. I remember, as a kid, the Fremont Hotel which was our first high-rise, all seven stories. It was the most magnificent scene in Las Vegas. That was it. Everything else was two stories or less. When the Fremont Hotel was built down on Fremont Street, it attracted visitors. Wayne Newton appeared at the top and as high school kids we used to sneak in the back and make fun of him. I watched this city grow. Over the last 40 or 50 years, I have seen it change from a dust bowl to a magnificent almost Disneyland-type attraction. It is our job here in the Legislature to tweak the laws, to tweak the tax laws, to make it advantageous for the various businesses that we want to reside in our State to become profitable so that they do, in fact, pay taxes. That economic engine equates to jobs. Those jobs equate to schools. Those school equate to churches. Whenever the hotels do very well there is a lot of building that goes on in Las Vegas. We have a lot of people who move here. Why? Because the quality of life is exceptional. The jobs are plentiful. I look at it this way, I had a phone call from a constituent who argued vociferously against giving a tax break to anyone regarding art. I said to him, If they want a volcano and think that is going to attract tourism and is going to be good for our State, give them a volcano. If they want a pond and it is going to attract visitors, give them a pond. If they want an art museum and it is going to attract visitors, give them an art museum and tweak our taxes to that extent. Forty-seven percent of our budget comes from gaming and comes from those tourists who come to these facilities that we as legislators allow to happen through the tweaking of this legislation, tweaking of the law to allow economic diversification. If we did not have that dependence on gaming and did not have that economic engine running, we would have to stop today and double everybodys property tax because there would not be any revenue. The more we bash our gaming industry and the more we think they are an adversary, the more we better look to our own wallet to start paying our bills because they are paying 47 percent of it right now. If it is good for the city, give it to them. It makes sense. In the big picture, it makes sense. In the long run, the whole State of Nevada will benefit.\n\nSenator Titus:\n\nI just have a question. We have heard a lot about the different exemptions. I believe it was the Chairman of the Taxation Committee who mentioned that one of the parties who has been referred to here as an art dealer so that he doesnt have to pay some sort of tax anyway. What I wondered was if an art dealer sells a picture here in Nevada to somebody in New York or somewhere else out of this collection, is there any sales tax on that? Who pays it and how do we track that? What is the story on that end?\n\nSenator McGinness:\n\nThank you, Madam President.

If he takes delivery in another state, it would be applicable in that state.\n\nSenators Neal, Titus and Coffin requested a roll call vote on Senator McGinness motion.\n\nSenators Raggio, James and Jacobsen moved the previous question.\n\nMotion carried.\n\nThe question being that the Senate concur in the Assembly amendment to Senate Bill No. 521.\n\nRoll call on Senator McGinness motion:\n\nYeas14\n\nNaysAmodei, Care, Coffin, Neal, OConnell, Titus, Wiener7.\n\nThe motion having received a majority, Madam President declared it carried.\n\nBill ordered enrolled.\n\nSenate Bill No. 387.\n\nThe following Assembly amendment was read:\n\nAmendment No. 989.\n\nAmend section 1, page 2, line 6, by deleting If and inserting: Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if.\n\nAmend section 1, page 2, line 11, by deleting another and inserting one other.\n\nAmend section 1, page 2, line 12, after area. by inserting: An operator of a tow car is not eligible for inclusion on the list if the operator is insured under the same policy of insurance as two or more other operators of tow cars who are included on the list and operate in the same geographical area..\n\nAmend sec. 2, page 2, by deleting line 16 and inserting: operator of a tow car who:\n\n(a) Is eligible pursuant to NRS 706.4485 to be included on the list; and\n\n(b) Was included on the list on June 30, 1998, and.\n\nAmend sec. 2, page 2, by deleting line 18 and inserting: solely on the ground that the operator was insured under the same policy of insurance as one other operator of a tow car who was included on the list and operated in the same geographical area..\n\nAmend sec. 2, page 2, by deleting line 22 and inserting: list pursuant to NRS 706.4485..\n\nSenator ODonnell moved that the Senate concur in the Assembly amendment to Senate Bill No. 387.\n\nRemarks by Senator ODonnell.\n\nMotion carried.\n\nBill ordered enrolled.\n\nMOTIONS, RESOLUTIONS AND NOTICES\n\nSenator ODonnell moved that Senate Bill No. 152 be taken from Unfinished Business and placed on Unfinished Business on the next agenda.\n\nRemarks by Senator ODonnell.\n\nMotion carried.\n\nUNFINISHED BUSINESS\n\nConsideration of Assembly Amendments\n\nSenate Bill No. 302.\n\nThe following Assembly amendment was read:\n\nAmendment No. 1091.\n\nAmend the bill as a whole by deleting sections 1 and 2 and adding new sections designated sections 1 and 2, following the enacting clause, to read as follows:\n\nSection 1.
