        "text": "It was a 10 year journey building our business before being acquired. Now I spend most mornings with my daughter, drinking coffee, while she sips her babbyccino. In this week's newsletter, I reflect on the value drivers behind our company's exit. Looking back, there were several reasons we were able to position ourselves for a successful exit. Our determination as a team to create a market for our medical device, build adoption globally, and help make childbirth safer all created a significant opportunity for a trade acquirer to accelerate growth and differentiate itself with a unique and innovative product. Many start-ups see an exit as the ultimate goal - interestingly, we never chased after that end result. We believed if we were able to make an impact with our device, build a market, and do all the right things as a company - maybe a larger player would take an interest, otherwise we would go it alone. In the end, it made sense for a strategic acquirer to take it off our hands. As a small team, we could not do it justice and get the device out to as many mothers and babies as we wanted to (our mission was to make childbirth safer globally). With a global player to take it forward, they could immediately roll it out to their sales teams and make a huge impact from day one. I stayed on for a year with the acquiring company, and in that year alone their progress was impressive. I‚Äôll talk through some of the specific value drivers in this week‚Äôs newsletter. I hope it provides some insight for others on a similar journey.

Crafting a product that users can't help but fall head over heels for is the cornerstone of success. At Presto, we're revolutionising oral health, currently immersed in Phase 1, where we're building a product that creates magic for dentists and lab technicians. After all, if your users aren't raving fans, what's the point, right? üí° Phase 2: Maximizing Opportunity with a Solid Company Once you've got a product that's turning heads, it's time to level up. Building a company that can ride the wave of opportunity your product has created is key. It's about maximizing every ounce of potential and turning it into something truly remarkable. üí∞ Phase 3: Harvesting Profits for Future Growth Now, it's time to reap the rewards of your hard work. Harvesting the profits of your core business isn't just about padding your pockets ‚Äì it's about fueling the fire of innovation. Investing in transformative new product ideas ensures your company stays ahead of the curve and continues to make waves. Each phase is like a piece of a puzzle ‚Äì interconnected and essential for the bigger picture of success. But here's the kicker ‚Äì most startups stumble right out of the gate because they miss the mark on Phase 1. Creating a product that users love enough to ditch the competition is no easy feat. It's about understanding your audience, tapping into their needs, and delivering a solution that knocks their socks off. So, if you find yourself in Phase 1, chin up! Success in this phase means you've struck gold ‚Äì discovering a demand so high that your small team can barely keep up. But remember, when that happens, it's time to shift gears. Phase 2 awaits, where you'll build the company of your dreams and leave a lasting legacy as a founder. Here's to embracing the journey, tackling each phase with its highs and lows, and paving the way for a future filled with success! üöÄ‚ú® BTW, we're actively seeking seed pre-revenue investors who believe dental care needs a ground-up rebuild. If you're looking to diversify your portfolio into healthcare, let's chat. #startupjourney #digitaldentistry #oralhealthcare #healthtech #dentaltech #Investors #seed\n\n‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt know everything. Even if you could, your community, your support in the startup world, is really, really important to ensure that you're making the right decisions, because one mistake can cost everything. Surrounding yourself with people is a really solid way to make sure that you're on the right path.‚Äù Meet Tyler Melton, co-founder and CEO of Houston-based Corveus Medical. Tyler and his team are taking an ambitious plunge into remedying congestive heart failure with a catheter-based device for nerve ablation. Here are a few takeaways from Tyler‚Äôs conversation with Scott Nelson: ‚û° Use off-the-shelf products for prototyping to save time and money. Tap into existing expertise and networks to drive progress rather than trying to solve everything yourself in a silo. ‚û° Accelerator programs provide startups with vital networking opportunities and force them to validate or adjust their business assumptions. Tyler shares insights on evaluating the costs of these programs in equity, time, and other commitments. ‚û° Opting for the PMA route, despite its rigor and scrutiny, can offer a focused approach to proving clinical efficacy. When it comes to fundraising, early planning paired with targeted investor engagement can help you navigate hurdles efficiently.

It's ok to be upset if things don't go well. And when things are great, we celebrate. But come Monday morning, we're back at it.‚Äù (Gabriel Jones, CEO of Proprio) \"The best employees are not the best individual contributors. They're those who bring out the best in everyone and make entire teams better. Some people just have that magic.\" (Kirsten Carroll, CEO of Kandu Health‚Ñ¢) ‚ÄúBe shameless and ask more questions to get the evidence you need. This enabled us to be very capital-efficient in our transition from an academic spinoff to a clinical-stage company.‚Äù (Parag Gad, CEO of SpineX Inc. ) These three #medtech entrepreneurs were featured on previous Medsider episodes, and have now returned as mentors, making an appearance in the latest volume ‚Äì Medsider Mentors Volume V, authored by our very own Scott Nelson, who is also the co-founder and CEO of FastWave Medical. Here are some additional key takeaways from these brilliant minds: üí™üèΩ Anticipate delays, time it right, and understand investors' perspectives for securing crucial capital. Master the art of fundraising through resilience, strategic focus, and adaptability. üí°Innovation goes beyond invention.

You want to go where you're being pulled.‚Äú Sahil Diwan, co-founder and CEO of OtoSet¬Æ by SafKan Health, is an ambitious young entrepreneur who turned his passion for technology into a groundbreaking #medicaldevice. SafKan Health, under Sahil's leadership, is changing the landscape for ear care with its first FDA-cleared automated ear-cleaning device, OtoSet. This user-friendly innovation, sparked from a personal family challenge, is now bringing relief to patients with impacted earwax. Here‚Äôs a glimpse into Sahil's recent chat with Scott Nelson: üé® Design is crucial in influencing user perception, interaction, and the adoption rate of a product. Strive to create something visually appealing and user-friendly, without overwhelming complexity. üìú Navigating FDA‚Äôs strict rules is more than compliance; active participation alongside expert counsel can grant you unexpected insights and improvements. üõ†Ô∏è Building a robust business foundation eases the challenges of fundraising. Balancing market demand, product evolution, and team dynamics is crucial for smoothing the path to funding.

Get your healthcare innovation from Idea to Reality faster by telling EVERYONE about it. What do I mean? Let‚Äôs start with a story‚Ä¶ Several years ago, a brand name academic hospital reached out to me for advice on how they could commercialize an idea. I‚Äôm big on paying it forward, so I said sure, I‚Äôd be happy to meet with the team and provide feedback. Not so fast, said the hospital business development team. I‚Äôd have to sign a NDA to make sure I ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt steal their idea‚Äù. I said they‚Äôd have to give me something to work with, so I‚Äôd even know if I could potentially help them. They gave me the one-liner description, and I instantly knew it wasn‚Äôt anything novel - I was aware of other companies that had developed something similar. I asked: well how far along is this project? There was zero development done. It was purely an idea some doctors had. I offered to help, with the caveat that I wouldn‚Äôt sign the NDA out of principle. Remember: they were asking for MY help but choosing to create friction to get that help - for free! What do you think happened? Nothing. They rejected my help. And I‚Äôm pretty sure it fizzled out soon after‚Ä¶ probably because they put up barriers to getting feedback and validation. Not to mention wasting all that time and money on NDAs that never mattered. When I meet healthcare innovators, I often have to help them get unbrainwashed from this poor philosophy of keeping their ideas a secret. Lots of people have the same idea. 99.99% of what separates an innovator from success and failure is execution. Instead, I tell innovators to tell anyone and everyone about their idea. A key reason for this is that evolving your idea based on market feedback is a natural aspect of progress. One of three things happens if you share your idea with others: 1. Your idea is perfect, and you get validation to build it - along with potentially a list of early adopters who are excited by your idea. (Unlikely) 2. Your idea is full of holes that you are now aware of because you got feedback. You then iterate that idea further, until you‚Äôre able to overcome most of the objections. This gives you a much stronger idea and a stronger blueprint for what to build (More likely). 3. Your idea is full of holes that you are unable to plug. You thankfully disqualify the idea before you wasted a ton of time and money on building something no one wanted. You know what never happens? Someone stealing your idea AND having both the skill and drive to execute better than you on the idea. And even in the 1 in a million chance that happens‚Ä¶ well that probably means they were meant for this idea in the first place! Have a healthcare innovation in mind but haven‚Äôt told anyone? Drop it in the comments and I‚Äôll share my unfiltered feedback - no NDA required! #healthcareinnovation #digitalhealth\n\n\"Interpretation is key in regulations, so we were tactical in defining the product to address user needs without making excessive claims in order to get the device to market quickly. We chose not to ask for too much too fast.\" (Cecile Brosset Dubois Brosset, CEO of Sonio) ‚ÄúHospitals have many different priorities. You're trying to build champions, so your clinical sites require some salesmanship. They need to believe that what you're doing is interesting, worthwhile, and compelling.\" (Deanne McCarthy, CEO of Swiftsure Innovations) \"Cutting corners will come back to haunt you. Prioritize decisions that add long-term value and consider which short-term choices take away future options from your company today or from the ultimate acquirer.\" (David Hochman, CEO of Orchestra BioMed) These three #medtech entrepreneurs were featured on previous Medsider episodes, and have now returned as mentors, making an appearance in Volume V of Medsider Mentors, authored by our host Scott Nelson, who is also the CEO of FastWave Medical. Here are a few more takeaways from these featured interviews: üßóüèΩProgress is iterative in both product development and team building. Aim for improvement without being paralyzed by the pursuit of perfection. üëì It's perfectly okay not to know everything. Channel your curiosity across your venture to find the right resources for reaching milestones. üç®When done right, risk-reward-sharing partnerships are great. Customize collaboration to align with your partner organization‚Äôs vision, capabilities, and goals.
