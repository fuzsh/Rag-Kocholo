        "text": "Campbell, William “Bill”\n\nWilliam Harold Campbell, Jr., known to all as “Bill,” passed away after an extended illness on December 15, 2018, at the age of 75 years.\n\nCalling will be Wednesday, December 19, from 3:00pm to 5:00pm and 6:00pm to 8:00pm at Parson Mortuary. Memorial services will be held at 1:00pm on Thursday, December 20, at Riverside United Methodist Church, with Pastor John A. Young officiating. Arrangements are by Parson Mortuary.\n\nBill was born to Mae and Harold Campbell on February 19, 1943, in Wellston, Ohio. He married Nellie Conn on December 4, 1965, in Franklin Furnace, Ohio. Bill attended Ohio University, and graduated with a degree in accounting. He worked as a cost accountant and a controller before starting his own accounting business, Campbell’s Data Services (CDS), with his wife Nellie in Hartford City, Indiana. Bill retired from Ontario Corporation in Muncie, Indiana, in 2008. Bill was also a veteran, serving in the Army Reserve from January 1965 to March 1970.\n\nBill was known for his love of family, friends, and church. He served on many committees and boards at Grace United Methodist Church in Hartford City, Indiana, and enjoyed singing in the choir and participating in the Tuesday night Bible Study at Riverside United Methodist Church in Muncie, Indiana. Bill was passionate about sports; when his children and grandchildren were younger, he could be seen playing whiffle ball or basketball with them and their friends. He also looked forward to his semi-annual golf outing with his son, Andy. In 2013, Bill achieved a life goal of writing a novel with the publishing of “The Goldsboro Curve,” a book about life in southern Ohio. He was asked to attend book signings in Portsmouth, Ohio and Wellston, Ohio because of his accurate description of life in Appalachia.\n\nHis proudest achievement was his marriage of 53 years to Nellie. One of the happiest days of his life was attending their 50th wedding anniversary party in 2015, thrown by his niece, Janis Martin Butcher.\n\nBill is preceded in death by his mother and father; mother-in-law and father-in-law, Willie and Juanita Conn; brother Jerry Mahle; infant brother; and brothers-in-law Ronnie and Willie Michael Conn.\n\nIn addition to his wife, Nellie, Bill is survived by children, Andy (Angie) and Julie Campbell-Holmes (Michael); Sister, Mary Bichsel (Tim); Grandchildren, Sam and Sophie Campbell, Deborah (DC) Campbell-Holmes; Special Cousin, Ronnie Campbell (Rita); Brother-in-law, Paul Conn (Lummy); Sisters-in-law: Sandi Wilson (George), Pam Barnett (Rick), Kim Conn Clark (Willie), and Tiffany Conn Hadsell (fiancé, Tim Fannin).\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial gifts may be made to Riverside United Methodist Church or Viaquest Hospice.\n\nThe family wishes to extend our gratitude to Viaquest Hospice, Riverside United Methodist Church, and Westminster Presbyterian Church for their thoughts, prayers, and service."
