As he pursues this idea, keeping track in blue exercise books, what was at first odd becomes funny, then suddenly sad.\n\nWith very little prompting (“is this just a weird story about an old man, or does it have a deeper meaning?”) even tough-guy teenage boys will discuss loneliness, dementia, immigration, and the importance of friendship.\n\nFirst published in German 1973. Available on The White Review website, newly translated by Lydia Davis, here\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated"
