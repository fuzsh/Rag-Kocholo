        "text": "The papers in this volume grew out of a year-long program in “Real Algebraic Geometry and Quadratic Forms”, held at the University of California at Berkeley during the 1990–1991 academic year. This valuable collection of research articles by top workers serves as a record of current developments in these areas and as a tribute to the fruitful interaction between them. Students and researchers alike will find this book a useful reference, with articles ranging from the technical to the expository. Also included are summaries of the current developments in several sub-disciplines and indications of new research directions."
