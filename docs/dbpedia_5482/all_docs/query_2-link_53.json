        "text": "Was a member of both the National Trapshooting Hall of Fame and the Ohio State Trapshooting Hall of Fame.\n\nWon more Grand American championships than any other person in the first 75 years of the event. Made All American 21 times and captain 5 times.\n\nBroke 59 perfect 200’s and nine were in the same year. Shares the North American Doubles Championship top spot 4 times, and has captured the High-Over-All an unprecedented 7 times.\n\nWon the Marshall Marathon 5 times and holds the record of 465 straight before he missed one out of the 500. The Marshall Marathon was an annual event that took place in Yorklyn, Delaware. It was the country’s first 500 bird registered 16-yard marathon-a five day tournament.\n\nDuring World War II, Hiestand served as a training officer for the U.S. Army Air Corps, teaching target shooting to aerial gunners.\n\nHe was a two term Highland County commissioner before being elected to the House of Representatives.\n\n“He was such a great competitor all of his life,” said his daughter-in-law Helen Hiestand. “He played golf well into his 90’s.”\n\nJoe Hiestand is being inducted into the Highland County Athletic Hall of Fame because he was arguably the greatest trapshooter of all time. But he was much more than that. In a lifetime that spanned 97 years, Hiestand also found success as a politician, farmer, trapper, hunter, golfer, bowler, pilot, military instructor and even an entrepreneur.\n\nIt all started on the family farm off U.S. Route 50 at the western edge of Hillsboro when Hiestand was 8 years old. His father gave him a pellet gun and he started dropping sparrows.\n\nBy the time he was done shooting, Hiestand had amassed 20 North American Trapshooting championships and 33 American Trapshooting Association state crowns.\n\n“Dad’s brother Paul was also a great shot,” Joe’s son, Ed Hiestand, said this week. “In fact, dad said Paul might have been a better shot. But dad had something that Paul didn’t. In the clutch, Paul would kind freeze up, where with dad, the pressure didn’t phase him.\n\n“He’s a good example that if you have responsibilities when you’re young and see them through and you’re successful, it pays off later in life.”\n\nOften, Ed said, Joe and his father and brother would take the dogs, hop on a train in Hillsboro, ride 12 miles out and hunt all the way back. By the time Joe was 12, he had a .22 and soon thereafter he started running traps lines.\n\n“He ran about 25 traps a day,” Ed said. “By the end of the eighth grade had $400 worth of pelts and I think back then that was enough to buy a car.”\n\nJoe was 17 when a Richard Ruble, later the president of Delta Airlines, took him to his first trap shoot in Danville. It cost 25 cents to enter and Joe won the grand prize turkey in a shoot-off.\n\nJoe also worked on the family farm when he was young. One day in 1927, Joe’s father said the farm wasn’t making enough money. So, Joe put up $1,200 to bid on a state highway mowing project and eventually won a $21,000 contract, mowing all the state highways in Highland County with horse teams.\n\nIt wasn’t long after that when Joe hit the trap shooting circuit, traveling nationwide.\n\nHe started winning major championships in 1931, and 41 years later, while competing in his first Grand American as a veteran, he captured three trophies in the over-65 age group, including the high-over-allll.\n\nJoe has been named to 21 Sports Afield All-America men’s trap teams, serving as captain from 1934-36, 1938 and later in 1947-49. He won more Grand American championships than any other person in the history of the event. He led North American Clay Target competition with five wins, shared the doubles championship top spot with Hall of Famer Mercer Tennille at four apiece, and captured the high-over-all an unprecedented seven times. From 1934 through 1936, he won the Jim Day Cup, forerunner to the All-Around. High-over-all honors were captured by Joe in ’34, ’36 ’38, ’46, ’49 and ’56. The record 977×1,000 he set in 1949 was tied twice, but not broken until 1964.\n\nThe Clay Target Championship was Hiestand’s in 1935, ’36, ’38, ’44 and ’60. The four-time doubles champion won the champion of champions honors in 1947 and 1949, and he teamed to win the brother-brother crown in 1955. Until 1972, Hiestand held the record number of 19 perfect 200s at Vandalia, where the North American Trapshooting Championships where held through 2005 before moving to Sparta, Ill.\n\nAt the 1938 Grand, Joe established a long run record of 966 registered singles and an unregistered run of 1,191, including practice and shootoff targets. After the Grand, he completed his registered run at 1,179 and finished with an unregistered string of 1,404. Those runs were not broken until 1959.\n\nOf Joe’s 33 ATA championships, and all but one (the all-around in 1945 in Florida) were won in Ohio. He captured eight 16-yard crowns from 1931-59, three of which were with 200 straights (1937, 1939 and 1949). Until 1955, he was the only person to have accomplished such a feat. He won the Buckeye doubles 12 times and the all-around the same number.\n\nJoe broke 59 perfect 200s in his career, nine of which were recorded in one year in the middle 1930s. His .9298 on 2,650 handicap targets led ATA yearly averages in 1935, and he headed twin-bird averages in 1941 with .9457 and two years later with an even 94 percent. Joe broke 98.7 percent of 3,000 singles targets to lead in 1942, his .9879 on 3,400 clays was tops in 1947, and he paced the 1950 standings with .9895 on 2,000 birds.\n\nJoe was also accomplished in live pigeon shooting and made a trip to Monte Carlo in the 1950s as part of a U.S. trapshooting team. Joe was the captain of the team that won the world championship and, according to Ed, he still holds the record for hitting 58 consecutive live targets without a miss.\n\nOne of the stories from the Monte Carlo trip, Ed said, is that his father and mother – longtime Hillsboro teacher Mary Hiestand – were at a dance where Mary ended up matched with some smallish guy she didn’t know. She later found out the man was Aristotle Onasis.\n\nIn 1964, Joe won the Hillsboro Elks individual golf title, finishing runner-up the following year. He was also runner-up several years at the Snow Hill Country Club near New Vienna. Later in life, Ed said, Joe could shoot below his age. He quit golfing in 1973 after suffering a heart attack while golfing at Snow Hill.\n\nIn 1947, Joe was invited to what Ed said was the National Celebrities Golf Tournament in Washington, D.C. where he captained a four-some that included Olympian Jim Thorpe. The four-some in front of them included Bob Hope.\n\nJoe also bowled. “I know he completed in it and was really good at it,” Ed said.\n\nDuring World War II, Joe, also a pilot, was stationed in Florida as a gunnery instructor. Ed said Joe and some of his shooting buddies were assigned to teach young aerial gunners how to shoot at moving targets.\n\nJoe completed 18 years of government service, the first 13 as a Highland County commissioner and the last five as a state representative.\n\nIt was the family farm, though, where Ed said his dad was most comfortable.\n\nIn later years, before Joe passed away in 2004, Ed said he was able to fly, campaign and travel with his dad. But he also said he’ll never forget the trapshooting days.\n\n“It was kind of neat because Vandalia was kind of close and we got to go over the there and meet a lot of people involved in that industry, and they came to the farm a lot, too,” Ed said. “Dad was always champion in my eyes.”"
