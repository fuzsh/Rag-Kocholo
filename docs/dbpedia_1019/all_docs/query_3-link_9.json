        "text": "Did anyone managed to get a 5 start soldier?, if yes, would you like to share your experience on the time it took (estimations), how it was & all of that.\n\nI got 5 star gunners twice from lootboxes in alpha. Never got the chance to upgrade them since progress wipe came soon afterwards.\n\nThe odds are extremely small to get one from lootboxes from my experience. I got 2 after 1.5 months of very extensive playing. I don’t play that often now. Which could be why I haven’t received one even after 2 months into the beta or the devs have deliberately reduced the chance of getting one even further.\n\nAs for getting one through academy, @5762269 should be able to answer. He’s got the whole math done.\n\nYou need 3 rank 4s, totalling at 12 levels to max. You then need 9 rank 3s, totalling 27 levels to max. Then 27 rank 2s, totalling 54 levels to max. After that, 81 rank 1s, for another 81 levels.\n\nThis is 12+27+54+81=174 levels per rank 5 soldier, +5 to max it = 179\n\nAsuming you need 10 minutes of gameplay to level a soldier up (note that even though you level up multiple soldiers at the same time in a single match, you generally need multiple matches to level the batch), this is 1790 minutes, or 29,8 or 30 hours of raw gameplay per soldier. Of course, your actual match time vs game time is about 50% due to how much time you spend in the main menu organizing things, leading to 60 hours per rank 5 soldier. Note that my previous calculation was much higher, but that was for veteran soldiers, which require 3x that ammount, and under the asumption it took 15min per soldier, before the increased progression rates, making it take another 1.5x as long.\n\nThis means that per squad, you need around 400 hours to get 7 rank 5 soldiers, or 1200 hours to get 3 squads with rank 5 soldiers\n\nHowever, this is under the asumption you are leveling at a high efficiency, always swapping out for new soldiers, always having new soldiers of the appropiate type available to level, can use the academy enough to not get stuck waiting for a soldier to be trained, not using vehicles as those slow progression, etc.\n\nAnd this is per campaign as well. You also will have to mainly use the same 3 squads so they can benefit from +100% XP gain rates.\n\nWith this we can also evaluate how much Darkflow thinks our time is worth. Within that 240 hours to get 4 rank 5 soldiers we can easily max a squad’s level, as well as get upgraded weapons for all its soldiers, akin to the premium assaulter squad. It costs $30 to get to that point, or 240 hours for free. So darkflow evaluates playtime at $30/240 = $0.125/hour.\n\nIn comparison, a heavy grind game known as Warframe gives you the ability to trade in-game items for the premium currency it uses. You earn about $1-2 of ingame premium currency per hour in that game by just farming certain things and selling them on the player market.\n\nSame can be done for War Thunder. A S.U.F.F.E.R. event vehicle generally takes 10 start * 4 hours/star = 40 hours to obtain. Those vehicles are generally worth around $40-120, valueing your playtime at $1-3/hour for such event gameplay, not accounting for normal progression in the tech trees you will also gain while doing the event.\n\nhonestly, in one month of game, ( not like, houndreds of hours, but you got the point. due to my work limitations ) the other day i managed to reach 2 soldiers at 5 stars.\n\nare they good?\n\nyes.\n\nare they worthed?\n\nno. absoluty not.\n\nmy personal suggestion is, aim for make your squad full of 3 and 4 stars. considering the fact that you have to cover like, 3 squads of 7 soldier’s each ( not counting the tankers ) those are huge numbers. so, again, try to aim for soldiers made of 3 stars, and 4. or you will just spend your whole life on this game. not to mention, that once you get soldiers with stars, you have to fill those starts to notice the differences.\n\nbut yeah, soldiers that has 3/4 stars they are still efficent, and preatty easy to make compared to the 5.\n\nbecause if you keep replacing guys with the high number of stars, you are leaving a big open spots and it’s not the best in my opinion. becouse high number stars are gonna make bots more \" smarter \" ( increased accuracy, shooting down people, and more reactive ) and makes your gameplay more easier ( due to perks and buggs ) but that’s up to you.\n\nlast tip i suggest, play lone wolf matches. it’s very good for leveling up your soldiers much more faster. and make the grind less painfull ( as it’s double xp ).\n\nand i would suggest to recycle soldiers in each squad ( let’s say from one that you unlocked recently, swap some soldiers of elder squads in the newer one) so that the process is somewhat faster.\n\nbut that’s up to you.\n\nnot for spam, but i would reccomend you to check Tcat’s YT channell. he explained a lot during his info videos.\n\ncheers ^^\n\nYeah, this is another thing that highlights the issue, usually get a match against bots, get an engineer to build an ammo crate nearby & you will be racking kills without dying. About the videos, I like to do it the classic way although giving it a visit after the game release is going to be a thing to see the difference throughout the game development.\n\nBack to the case, I usually up my soldiers when I’m sure I got enough 3s & the extra are making their way into being 4s, the issue at the moment is that I’m hitting the reserve cap & trying to get rid of all those 1s that I have (the troopers) with about 30 or + cards for soldiers. I’m on my way of actually leaving this testing but I’m really sure as hell as long as you & @TCatPlaysGamezYT are still involved it have hope of getting a lot of corrections & on the right tracks."
