Private First Class Aguirre distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous action on 2 July 1967, while serving as a Medical Aidman attached to Company A, 1st Battalion (Airborne), 8th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile), during combat operations near Tuy An, Republic of Vietnam. When two platoons of Private First Class Aguirre's company came under fire from a well entrenched enemy force, several casualties were suffered, including the company commander. Immediately racing to the fallen commander's side, Private First Class Aguirre did all he could for the officer before removing him to the rear for medical evacuation. Instantly, Private First Class Aguirre was forward again giving aid to the wounded while receiving a hail of enemy small arms fire. Constantly moving from one exposed position to another, he never stopped his work nor let his own safety take precedence over the welfare of the men in need of his services. His actions instilled confidence in all who observed him and saved countless lives. Private First Class Aguirre's gallant action is in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service, and reflects great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile), General Orders No. 5377 (September 10, 1967)\n\n*ALAKULPPI, VESA JUHANI (KIA)\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pride in presenting the Silver Star Medal (Posthumously) to Vesa Juhani Alakulppi (0-98573), Captain, U.S. Army, for gallantry in action while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force on 14 May 1968 while serving as Commanding Officer, Company C, 2d Battalion, 3d Infantry Regiment, 199th Infantry Brigade (Separate) (Light), in the Republic of Vietnam. On this date, Captain Alakulppi was in command of a ready reaction force consisting of one rifle platoon and a mortar section providing security for a large two-company base camp when an unknown-size Viet Cong force attacked the perimeter with automatic weapons, small arms and rocket fire. Reacting immediately, Captain Alakulppi rallied his men to halt the enemy's advance. Realizing that, because of adverse weather conditions air support was not available, Captain Alakulppi repeatedly exposed himself to the intense enemy fire in order to direct supporting artillery fire close to his company's position. During the savage battle, without regard for his personal safety, he continually moved about the perimeter, encouraging his men and directing their fire. Realizing that his unit was isolated from friendly reinforcements, Captain Alakulppi continued to provide dynamic and aggressive leadership in the valiant defense of the base camp until he was mortally wounded by enemy fire. By his courageous actions, he inspired his men to grater efforts and enabled them to bring maximum suppressive fire against the Viet Cong force and repel the enemy attack. Captain Alakulppi's exceptional heroism and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, II Field Force, Vietnam, General Orders No. 601 (June 30, 1968)\n\nBorn: April 23, 1941 at Rovaniemi, Finland\n\nHome Town: Seattle, Washington\n\nALBRACHT, WILLIAM L.\n\n(First Award)\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918 (amended by an act of July 25, 1963), takes pleasure in presenting a Second Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster in lieu of a Third Award of the Silver Star to Captain (Infantry) William L. Albracht, United States Army, for gallantry in action from 28 October 1969 to 1 November 1969, during combat operations against an armed enemy of the United States, as Executive Officer, Detachment A-236, Company B, 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne), 1st Special Forces, while in the Republic of Vietnam. Captain Albracht's calm and reassuring leadership as the Officer-in-Charge of Fire Support Base Kate enabled his forces to successfully withstand the initial waves of enemy attacks. The following day, with complete disregard for his own safety, Captain Albracht moved under intense enemy fire, carrying a wounded Soldier to safety and directing incoming medevac helicopters. Despite his shrapnel wounds, Captain Albracht refused evacuation and continued to lead his Soldiers in fighting enemy forces and ultimately withdrawing from the base. Over the period of six hours, Captain Albracht and his Soldiers evaded enemy forces while moving through the jungle under the cover of darkness to meet United States forces at the rescue position. Captain Albracht's bravery, self sacrifice and exceptional tactical skill enabled the defenders of Fire Support Base Kate to not only defend their position until the last possible moment, but also successfully escape prior to being overrun. Captain Albracht's accomplishments are in keeping with the finest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself, the 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne) and the United States Army.\n\nHome Town: Chicago, Illinois\n\nALBRACHT, WILLIAM L.\n\n(Second Award)\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918 (amended by an act of July 25, 1963), takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Captain (Infantry) William L.

Captain Albracht distinguished himself on 2 November 1969, while serving as an Advisor to Vietnamese forces at Camp Bu Prang, in the Republic of Vietnam. That night enemy elements launched an intense mortar and recoilless rifle attack upon the Vietnamese outpost. Although his bunker was the direct target of hostile recoilless rifle fire, Captain Albracht held his position, detected the launching site of the enemy gunners, and returned fire on them with his machine gun. After silencing the recoilless rifle, Captain Albracht left his bunker and took up a position completely exposed to hostile fire and from there adjusted artillery and tactical air strikes on the adversary's positions. Amid barrages of B-40 rockets, Captain Albracht continued to direct and coordinate friendly fire on the attackers until the cessation of hostilities. Captain Albracht's gallantry in action was in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHome Town: Chicago, Illinois\n\nALBRACHT, WILLIAM L.\n\n(Third Award)\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918 (amended by an act of July 25, 1963), takes pleasure in presenting a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster in lieu of a Second Award of the Silver Star to Captain (Infantry) William L. Albracht, United States Army, for gallantry in action while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an armed force while serving with Detachment B-20, Company B, 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne), 1st Special Forces, in the Republic of Vietnam. Captain Albracht distinguished himself during the period 16 to 18 May 1970, while advising a Vietnamese Mobile Strike Force element during search and clear operations in Kontum Province. After several days of searching for suspected enemy activity in the mountainous jungle terrain surrounding Dak Seang Special Forces Camp, the allies were attacked by a large hostile force supported by intense rocket and mortar fire. Captain Albracht immediately moved through the intense enemy fire to personally direct the defensive efforts of his men and to administer aid to his wounded comrades. As the enemy attack suddenly intensified, the captain rushed to the point of heaviest contact and resisted the enemy with hand-to-hand combat. When the allies ran perilously low on ammunition, Captain Albracht directed a helicopter resupply operation and exposed himself to intense enemy fire in order to unload and distribute the ammunition to his men. On the final day of contact, the allies broke through the enemy encirclement and Captain Albracht assumed rear security responsibilities. Directing allied artillery strikes to within thirty meters of his position, the captain held the enemy at bay while his men moved toward Camp Dak Seang. Then, the captain skillfully flanked his men around the opposing force to the safety of the Special Forces camp. Captain Albracht's gallantry in action was in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHome Town: Chicago, Illinois\n\nALLEN, ALAN W.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to Alan W. Allen (US-54508379), Sergeant, U.S. Army, for gallantry in action against a hostile force on 14 May 1968 in the Republic of Vietnam. Sergeant Allen distinguished himself by intrepid actions while serving as team leader with Company A, 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment, 198th Infantry Brigade, Americal Division. On that date, Company A was given the mission of assaulting a company of North Vietnamese Regulars who were occupying well-fortified bunkers on a ridge line 17 miles west of Tam Ky. As the company began assaulting the hill, the insurgents opened fire with small arms, automatic weapons, heavy machineguns, rockets, and 60-mm. mortars. While moving up the slope, Sergeant Allen continuously exposed himself to the enemy fire. As he and another member of his fire team closed on the bunkers, the enemy began throwing hand grenades. Despite the exploding grenades, Sergeant Allen was one of the first men to breach the enemy perimeter. Once inside the enemy bunker line Sergeant Allen moved quickly and took several of the bunkers under fire. During the ensuing engagement, Sergeant Allen was personally credited with destroying five key enemy bunkers with hand grenades, killing 11 insurgents, and capturing 13 enemy weapons. Sergeant Allen's outstanding display of personal heroism and devotion to duty is in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit upon himself, the Americal Division, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, Americal Division, General Orders No. 6385 (August 24, 1968)\n\n*ANDERSON, JAMES HOWARD (KIA)\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pride in presenting the Silver Star Medal (Posthumously) to James Howard Anderson (19646086), Staff Sergeant, U.S. Army, for gallantry in action while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam on 6 September 1968. Staff Sergeant Anderson distinguished himself near the village of Ap Duong Trau Nho, Republic of Vietnam, while serving as a platoon sergeant for Company A, 3d Battalion, 187th Infantry. The Fourth Platoon of Company A was maintaining a cordon around the village when an enemy force broke through the center of the Company and flanking attacks were directed on the Fourth Platoon. The position to Staff Sergeant Anderson's right was hit by the enemy thrust. Although previously wounded himself, Staff Sergeant Anderson lead a relief party against the enemy thrust, stopped the first enemy flanking attack, and brought one of his wounded men to safety. Realizing how seriously he was wounded, he refused medical aid and propped himself against a rice paddy dike to continue firing upon the enemy until he succumbed to his wounds.

Armed with a shotgun he defended this position for more than 16 hours against several enemy attempts to gain entry into the house. During this period he was severely wounded by enemy grenade fire and was under constant exposure to enemy small arms fire. Throughout the ensuing battle, Sergeant First Class Anderson was instrumental in warding off several enemy attempts to overrun the detachment's position. He personally was responsible for inflicting deadly fire on the attacking enemy forces, thereby rendering a demoralizing effect on the attacking enemy force. His position was later overrun and he was held as a Prisoner of War until his release on 5 March 1973. Master Sergeant Anderson's heroic actions are in keeping with the highest traditions of the services and reflect great credit on himself and the United States Army.\n\nANDERSON, LEONARD G.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918 (amended by an act of July 25, 1963), takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to First Lieutenant (Infantry) Leonard G. Anderson, United States Army, for gallantry in action. First Lieutenant Anderson distinguished himself on 7 October 1967 while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Company A, 2d Battalion, 502d Airborne Infantry, 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division. While set up in a night perimeter, Lieutenant Anderson's platoon was attacked by two company size North Vietnamese Army units. Lieutenant Anderson, with complete disregard for his own safety, exposed himself continually to the vicious hail of enemy automatic weapons fire in order to position his men, direct their fire and call in artillery support. Lieutenant Anderson, realizing he was outnumbered and in danger of being overrun, broke contact and withdrew. After withdrawing to a fairly safe area, he immediately reorganized his platoon for a counterattack. Lieutenant Anderson, again with complete disregard for his own safety, personally led the assault against the enemy. In the early phases of the counterattack he was wounded. Although bleeding profusely and in great pain, he continued to expose himself and lead his men through the assault. Lieutenant Anderson did not allow himself to be evacuated until all of his wounded men were extracted and their position secure. Lieutenant Anderson's successful counterattack accounted for twenty confirmed North Vietnamese Army soldiers dead, fourteen automatic weapons, two rocket launchers and one flame thrower captured. Lieutenant Anderson's outstanding display of gallantry in action and his devotion to duty are within the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, I Field Force Vietnam, General Orders No. 275 (March 22, 1968)\n\n*ARVIN, CARL ROBERT (KIA)\n\n(First Award)\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918 (amended by an act of July 25, 1963), takes pride in presenting the Silver Star (Posthumously) to Captain (Infantry), [then First Lieutenant] Carl Robert Arvin (ASN: OF-104601), United States Army, for gallantry in action while serving with Advisory Team 162, Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, in action against the enemy on 5 September 1967 while serving as Assistant Battalion Advisor, 7th Airborne Battalion, Army of the Republic of Vietnam. On this date, the battalion was deployed in a three-pronged assault on suspected enemy positions. As the unit approached the objective area, the entire left flank came under intense mortar and small arms fire from Viet Cong bunker and trench complexes located on the rice paddy perimeters. An element on the left flank was overwhelmed by the fierce fire and withdrew, leaving Captain Arvin, his counterpart, and two radio operators alone. Undaunted by the perilous circumstances, Captain Arvin led the group forward to engage the enemy. In doing so, one of the radio operators was wounded. Although wounded himself, Captain Arvin, with complete disregard for his personal safety, moved through the enemy fire to the man and dragged him to a relatively protected location. Returning to the group, he began directing repeated armed helicopter gunship strikes as all elements of the battalion now engaged the enemy. Then, heedless of the increasing volume of enemy fire, Captain Arvin established a landing zone and supervised the evacuation of the wounded. Refusing evacuation himself, he returned to the front to continue to advise and assist in the conduct of the battle. As a direct result of Captain Arvin's indomitable fighting spirit, positive leadership, and calm courage throughout the hours-long battle, the insurgents were forced from their positions and the 7th Battalion was able to secure the objective.

On this date, Captain Arvin was accompanying the battalion in a sweep of suspected enemy positions when the unit came under intense hostile mortar and automatic weapons fire. As the volume of enemy fire increased, Captain Arvin called for helicopter gunships to support the attacking Airborne soldiers. Realizing that the battalion was facing a determined enemy, Captain Arvin left his relatively safe position and raced through fire swept fields to a forward position where he expertly began directing the gunships on target. With enemy activity temporarily suppressed, the battalion continued to move forward until it was re-subjected to punishing mortar and small arms fire. Once again Captain Arvin valiantly and in full view of enemy gunners, moved through the fire to a forward vantage point. There, as fighting raged about him, he directed extremely accurate, close range gunship passes onto enemy positions. As a direct result of Captain Arvin's unremitting attention to duty, resolute courage, and superb direction of ground forces and supporting aircraft, a strong and determined enemy was forced to flee in defeat. Captain Arvin's conspicuous gallantry in action was in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself and the United States Army.\n\nBorn: January 19, 1943 in Ypsilanti, Michigan\n\nHometown: Ypsilanti, Michigan\n\nPersonal Awards: Silver Star (Vietnam)\n\n*ASCHENBRENNER, DENNIS DALE (KIA)\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pride in presenting the Silver Star Medal (Posthumously) to Dennis Dale Aschenbrenner (0-5326519), First Lieutenant (Infantry), U.S. Army, for gallantry in action.

When his company came under intense enemy automatic weapons fire, Lieutenant Aschenbrenner, with complete disregard for his own safety, moved from his position of safety to the center of the battle area. He exposed himself to the withering enemy fire as he placed a blazing barrage on the enemy positions, drawing the enemy fire to himself and allowing his men to reach safe positions. Even though his weapon jammed, he continued to expose himself to the insurgent fire, undoubtedly saving the lives of several men. While attempting to fix his malfunctioning weapons, Lieutenant Aschenbrenner was struck and mortally wounded by the enemy fire. His display of courageous leadership and concern for the welfare of his fellow soldiers was in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service, and reflects great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nBorn: January 12, 1942 at Belle Fourche, South Dakota\n\nHome Town: Lead, South Dakota\n\nATCHISON, MARK L.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918 (amended by an act of July 25, 1963), takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Specialist Fifth Class Mark L.

Specialist Fifth Class Atchison distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 2 May 1967 while serving as Special Forces Advisor to a Vietnamese platoon during a search and destroy mission near My Phuoc Tay. Specialist Atchison was separated from the rest of his company and led his platoon across a canal to provide security and to search the opposite bank as the entire force advanced. After following the canal for 200 meters, he took his platoon to search a hamlet. The men were 50 meters from the canal tree line when Viet Cong opened fire with rifles and machine guns. Since the platoon was caught in the open, Specialist Atchison immediately shouted for his men to assault the insurgents. The intense fire stopped his unit before it could reach the enemy positions, but Specialist Atchison moved into the open and initiated a second assault. Although six other men around him were wounded, he continued alone until he was forced to dive for cover 20 meters from the Viet Cong. He crawled to the side of a wounded soldier, treated his wound, and dragged him to safety. Out of the line of fire, he organized his men for another assault and overran the numerically superior enemy. Specialist Fifth Class Atchison's gallantry in action was in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflects great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, United States Army Vietnam, General Orders No. 4383 (August 28, 1967)\n\nBorn: March 14, 1943 at Kearney, Nebraska\n\nHometown: Kearney, Nebraska\n\nAULT, JOHN W., JR.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to John W.

Captain Ault was serving as an Advisor to a Vietnamese Airborne Battalion when a helicopter landed in an opening in a dense jungle to evacuate two soldiers who had been wounded by hostile forces. As the helicopter landed, the northern-most company of the Battalion came under a fierce attack, characterized by intense small arms fire, and suffered heavy casualties. Captain Ault quickly waved the helicopter off the ground, and then, with complete disregard for his own personal safety, crossed an area swept by heavy small arms fire to reach a radio, communicated with the helicopter personnel, and requested additional support. Despite a wound from a hand grenade, he remained with the unit to advise and encourage them, and by his inspiring leadership and courageous actions, rallied the Vietnamese soldiers to hold their position and pursue their defense efforts. Captain Ault's conspicuous gallantry and unselfish actions are in the highest traditions of the United States Army and reflect great credit upon himself and the military service.\n\nDepartment of the Army, General Orders No. 49 (November 22, 1963)\n\nBAHNSEN, JOHN C., JR.\n\n(First Award)\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to John C.

After making visual reconnaissance and providing overhead cover for the ground forces, Captain Bahnsen landed his fire team in a supposedly secure area. While being briefed by the ground commander, a Viet Cong force ambushed the unit. At this time Captain Bahnsen fearlessly led his fire team through intense automatic weapons fire to their aircraft, took off, daringly attacked the enemy forces, and saved the Marine force from having heavy casualties. When another company was ambushed, Captain Bahnsen aggressively made low level attacks on the Viet Cong positions and, while receiving intense hostile fire, evacuated three critically wounded Marines. Upon returning from the evacuation mission, intense hostile fire was received during a low level reconnaissance flight. Captain Bahnsen dauntlessly made three firing passes on the insurgent positions, called for artillery fire and, after exhausting his ordnance, rearmed and returned to support the Marine force. Captain Bahnsen's courage during ten hours of intense hostile fire was an inspiration to his men and the Marine ground force.

On this date elements of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment engaged a company-sized North Vietnamese force within the Ba Da secret zone. During the firefight, the friendly force began receiving an intense concentration of automatic weapons fire from the numerically superior enemy force and immediately called for reinforcements. With the arrival of the friendly reinforcements, the hostile elements began withdrawing into the dense jungle terrain. One platoon from the 2d Mechanized Infantry Regiment and one aero rifle platoon pursued the enemy elements for two kilometers, until they were suddenly engaged by heavy automatic weapons fire from well-concealed positions. Observing the enemy force from the air, Major Bahnsen began directing highly-accurate suppressive fire into the North Vietnamese Army positions. After making a number of passes, landed Major Bahnsen positioned himself in front of the friendly forces, in full view of the enemy elements, and began directing his troop's advancement on the hostile positions. He was forced to seek cover when his position was raked by a barrage of automatic weapons fire, but after directing his gunship's fire onto the enemy force, he again exposed himself to the enemy fire and with shouts of encouragement to his men, led them on an all-out assault on the North Vietnamese positions, completely overrunning and destroying the hostile elements. Major Bahnsen's exceptional courage and aggressive leadership wore in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit and the United States Army.\n\nBAHNSEN, JOHN C., JR.\n\n(Third Award)\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting a Second Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster in lieu of a Third Award of the Silver Star Medal to John C. Bahnsen, Jr. (0-73597), Major (Armor), U.S. Army, for gallantry in action while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force on 3 February 1969 while serving as the Commanding Officer of the Air Cavalry Troop of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, in the Republic of Vietnam. On this date while he was conducting a routine reconnaissance mission, his aircraft suddenly began receiving heavy automatic weapons fire from a well-concealed and heavily-fortified enemy base camp. Reacting instantly, Major Bahnsen returned to his base of operations, quickly assembled his Aero Rifle Platoon, and returned to the contact area. After beginning an assault upon the hostile position, he realized that the hostile fire was larger than he had anticipated. He therefore called his troops back and established a cordon around the hostile fortification. For the next three hours, Major Bahnsen, under constant enemy fire, directed air and artillery strikes against the enemy forces from his low flying aircraft. While directing the bombardment of the area, he requested that a tank company and an armored cavalry assault vehicles arrived, he directed them into an assault formation and, disregarding his personal safety, flew his aircraft at treetop level over the enemy positions in order to effectively direct the final assault on the enemy base camp. When the hostile fortifications had been overrun, Major Bahnsen observed a number of enemy troops attempting to flee from the friendly forces. He immediately landed his helicopter and directed an assaulted upon the retreating enemy soldiers, killing one and capturing another. Major Bahnsen's courage and dedication to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit and the United States Army.\n\nBAHNSEN, JOHN C., JR.\n\n(Fourth Award)\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting a Third Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster in lieu of a Fourth Award of the Silver Star Medal to John C.

When one of his troops was stopped by heavy enemy fire and dense jungle, Major Bahnsen directed the ground action as he made low passes over the contact area directing artillery, air strikes and helicopter gunships against an entrenched enemy bunker complex. Although his aircraft was repeatedly hit by ground fire, he refused to leave the area or fly at a higher altitude. After being forced to make an emergency landing at his base camp, he mounted a mechanized flame thrower and with his headquarters command group of cavalry assault vehicles moved under an air strike and through intense enemy fire to the point of heaviest contact. There he reorganized his ground teams by shouting instructions and encouragement to his troops. After expending his flame thrower against bunkers, Major Bahnsen led a dismounted attack against one bunker, clearing it with his rifle. Realizing the need for additional force, he then called in air strikes. As the enemy broke contact, Major Bahnsen then organized a hasty defensive position for the night among the enemy bunkers. Major Bahnsen's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit and the United States Army.\n\nBAHNSEN, JOHN C., JR.\n\n(Fifth Award)\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting a Fourth Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster in lieu of a Fifth Award of the Silver Star Medal to John C.

Specialist Four Baker distinguished himself while serving as a Senior Rifleman in the 3d Platoon, Company C, 2d Battalion, 8th Infantry. The company was moving to rescue the 1st Platoon, which had become surrounded by a North Vietnamese Army Battalion. Once the company had fought through to the 1st Platoon, the enemy attempted to attack the company from the flank, but the intense fire placed on the North Vietnamese by the 3d Platoon forced them to fall back. When one of the enemy managed to hurl a grenade into the perimeter, Specialist Four Baker, without regard for his own safety, exposed himself to heavy enemy fire to kill the enemy soldier who threw the grenade and shout a warning to his comrades. His warning saved the lives of at least four men, and his instantaneous action prevented the threat of any further grenades. Responding immediately to a call for help to evacuate the wounded, Specialist Four Baker again disregarded danger to himself and moved through the intense enemy fire to carry many of the wounded personnel to safety. Specialist Four Baker's superb example of personal bravery was an inspiration to his fellow soldiers, as they repelled the vicious enemy attack. His unimpeachable valor in close combat against a numerically superior enemy force is in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit upon himself, his unit and the United States Army.\n\nPersonal Awards: Silver Star (Vietnam), Bronze Star w/ V Device, Purple Heart w/ Oak Leaf Cluster, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, Combat Infantryman Badge 1st Award, Republic of Vietnam Campaign Ribbon Expert Badge\n\nBANDA, THOMAS\n\nCitation:\n\nBy direction of the President, under the provisions of the Act of Congress, approved 9 July 1918.

Blagg, Captain (Infantry), U.S. Army, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as a Special Forces \"A\" Detachment Commander on 30 August 1965. On that date Captain Blagg was leading a 30-man combat patrol along the Song So Ha River which forms the border between Cambodia and South Vietnam. At a bend in the river, the patrol was ambushed by a battalion- size North Vietnamese Army (NVA) unit from dug-in positions on the Cambodian side. Most lead elements of the patrol were killed in initial contact. Captain Blagg's Vietnamese interpreter was badly wounded. Captain Blagg contacted his Special Forces camp by radio and directed that reinforcements from the camp deploy immediately to a linkup point near the ambush site. He then strapped his wounded interpreter to his back and began to disengage his patrol from the enemy force using fire and maneuver. As his patrol conducted a fighting withdrawal to the linkup point with reinforcements, the North Vietnamese force pursued across the river into South Vietnam. Soon, the fight became very close combat, hand to hand in some cases. During the fight, Captain Blagg was wounded in the face and his right arm was shattered by an enemy's bullet. Captain Blagg, although seriously wounded, continued to fight his patrol back to linkup with reinforcements. Once linkup was achieved, Captain Blagg reversed the tide of battle by launching an attack into the enemy force, killing many of them, and driving the remainder back into Cambodia. Based on the number of enemy bodies, blood trails, and captured enemy weapons, Captain Blagg's force killed or wounded the enemy at a rate of six to one, despite being, initially, the ambushed force. Not until the battle had been fought and won was Captain Blagg evacuated for medical treatment of his almost fatal wounds. Captain Blagg's heroic actions in battle were in keeping with the highest standards of the American soldier and reflect great credit upon him and the United States Army.\n\nHome Town: Arkansas\n\nBLEACHER, EARL.

Sergeant Bliss distinguished himself by intrepid actions on 8 February 1968 while serving as a rifleman in Company C, 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment, 198th Infantry Brigade, Americal Division. On that date, his company was moving to establish a blocking position near Lien Lac (2) when they suddenly came under intense fire from an enemy force of undetermined size. Immediately, his platoon leader and Sergeant Bliss' squad moved in an attempt to outflank the enemy who had another platoon pinned down. As they moved towards the pinned down element, several North Vietnamese Army soldiers were chased from cover and engaged with friendly fire. As they approached a hut in a small clearing, the enemy launched an attack on his squad, seriously wounding the platoon leader and squad leader. As Sergeant Bliss' squad pulled back, two enemy soldiers attacked the wounded squad leader. Disregarding his own safety, Sergeant Bliss ran to aid his comrade and successfully stopped the enemy with his accurate suppressive fire. He then joined a group that was providing cover for the withdrawal back across the open rice paddies. When all of the wounded were safely across, these brave men moved back to safety.

Bonnelycke (US-MC-1806071/USA-1806021), Sergeant, U.S. Army, for gallantry in action while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam. Sergeant Bonnelycke distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous action on 13 July 1969, while serving as the Platoon Leader of the Second Platoon, Company D, 2d Battalion (Airmobile), 8th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile), during a search and clear mission in Tay Ninh Province, Republic of Vietnam. Moving down a trail the point element was ambushed with mines, machine- guns, and small arms fire. The initial contact inflicted numerous wounds upon the members of Sergeant Bonnelycke's platoon. Realizing that there was no base of fire from which a counter attack could be launched, he moved to his wounded machinegunner and picked up the weapon. Laying down an effective base of fire, he enabled his platoon to mount their attack.

Repeatedly exposing himself to hostile fire, Lieutenant Bradbury disregarded his own safety to effectively direct helicopter gunships, medevac helicopters, and his combined infantry and cavalry forces against the well-constructed enemy positions. Lieutenant Bradbury continually exposed himself to the withering hail of enemy fire as his forces counterattacked the numerically superior hostile force. As a result of his competent leadership and professionalism, Lieutenant Bradbury's men successfully overran the enemy, killing 17 of the insurgents.

Specialist Fifth Class Bridges distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 7 December 1967, as a Combat Medic of an Ambulance Helicopter of the 45th Medical Company, 68th Medical Group, 44th Medical Brigade, on a rescue mission near Cu Chi. His helicopter received an urgent request to evacuate twelve seriously wounded men and immediately flew to the battle area. The mission was undertaken by the crew despite the knowledge that several rescue ships had previously been shot down in the area. The pilot made an unhampered landing and Specialist Fifth Class Bridges began loading the patients. Murderous enemy small arms and automatic weapons fire suddenly erupted from a nearby tree line, riddling his helicopter. With four casualties loaded, the pilot ordered Specialist Fifth Class Bridges to climb aboard and took off to prevent further damage to the ship. The hostile barrage in the landing zone ceased, and the helicopter returned to rescue the remainder of the casualties. The enemy force launched a second fusillade on his ship, and he was wounded as rounds tore into the craft. Ignoring his wound and mounting damage to the helicopter, he remained on the ground until all of the injured were loaded. The pilot then took off and skillfully nursed the badly crippled ship to an airfield.

Specialist Buckley unhesitatingly volunteered for the mission, although he realized that it involved being airlifted in to hostile territory in the darkness. At approximately 0200 hours, he was lowered from a hovering helicopter by a 60 foot rope into the jungle near Tan Uyen. The South Vietnamese defensive position was receiving continuous small arms fire at this time, and he was an extremely vulnerable target during his descent into the unsecured area. Specialist Buckley contacted the friendly elements and worked through the night to clear the vital landing zone.

On the morning of that date, the quarters occupied by Captain Bush and his operations sergeant were attacked by an enemy force of 20 North Vietnamese Commandos using grenades, small arms, machine guns, B40 rockets and satchel charges. Captain Bush, realizing that only he and his sergeant were adequately armed to offer protection to the other Americans in the compound and who were without protective cover, quickly decided to establish a defensive position within the compound from which he could suppress enemy fire. Covering each other with protective fire and throwing grenades into the North Vietnamese positions, both attempted to reach the pre-selected position and to draw enemy fire and attention. The sergeant was seriously wounded short of reaching the new position. Captain Bush, without hesitation, attempted single-handedly to attack the enemy raiders, firing as he advanced and killing two of the enemy.
