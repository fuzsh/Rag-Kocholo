        "text": "Senior military rank used by some nations' armed forces\n\nA five-star rank is the highest military rank in many countries.[1] The rank is that of the most senior operational military commanders, and within NATO's standard rank scale it is designated by the code OF-10. Not all armed forces have such a rank, and in those that do the actual insignia of the five-star ranks may not contain five stars. For example: the insignia for the French OF-10 rank maréchal de France contains seven stars; the insignia for the Portuguese marechal contains four gold stars. The stars used on the various Commonwealth of Nations rank insignias are sometimes colloquially referred to as pips, but in fact either are stars of the orders of the Garter, Thistle or Bath or are Eversleigh stars, depending on the wearer's original regiment or corps,[2] and are used in combination with other heraldic items, such as batons, crowns, swords or maple leaves.\n\nTypically, five-star officers hold the rank of general of the army, admiral of the fleet, field marshal, marshal or general of the air force, and several other similarly named ranks. As an active rank, the position exists only in a minority of countries and is usually held by only a very few officers during wartime. In times of peace, it is usually held only as an honorary rank. Traditionally, five-star ranks are granted to distinguished military commanders for notable wartime victories and/or in recognition of a record of achievement during the officer's career, whether in peace or in war. Alternatively, a five-star rank (or even higher ranks) may be assumed by heads of state in their capacities as commanders-in-chief of their nation's armed forces.\n\nDespite the rarity and seniority of five-star officers, an even more-senior rank of general of the armies was adopted in the United States. Other names for highly senior ranks from the twentieth century include généralissime (France), reichsmarschall (Nazi Germany), generalísimo (Spain) and generalissimus (USSR).\n\nAustralia\n\n[edit]\n\nAdmiral of the fleet[nb 1]\n\nField marshal[nb 1]\n\nMarshal of the Royal Australian Air Force[nb 1]\n\nOnly one Australian-born officer, Field Marshal Sir Thomas Blamey, has held a substantive Australian five-star rank. Lord Birdwood, who commanded the Australian Imperial Force in the First World War, was appointed to honorary five-star rank in the Australian Military Forces on his promotion to field marshal in the British Army in 1925.[3][4] King George VI and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, have held all three Australian five-star ranks in an honorary capacity, and have been the only holders of the Australian ranks of admiral of the fleet and marshal of the RAAF.\n\nRAN admiral of the fleet\n\nshoulder board\n\nAustralian Army field marshal\n\nshoulder board\n\nMarshal of the RAAF\n\nsleeve/shoulder insignia\n\nBrazil\n\n[edit]\n\nFive-star ranks in Brazil are only used in wartime.\n\nMarshal (Marechal)\n\nAdmiral (Almirante)\n\nMarshal of the air (Marechal-do-Ar)\n\nAlmirante\n\nMarechal\n\nMarechal-do-Ar\n\nCambodia\n\n[edit]\n\nGeneral of the army (Khmer: នាយឧត្តមសេនីយ៍ផុតលេខ), Royal Cambodian Armed Forces\n\nGeneral of the army\n\nCroatia\n\n[edit]\n\nStožerni general (lit. \"staff general\", usually translated as general of the army) awarded to six men, none of whom are in active duty.\n\nAdmiral flote (admiral of the fleet). The rank was called stožerni admiral (lit. \"staff admiral\") until 1999; only Sveto Letica was awarded this rank—in March 1996, three months before his retirement.\n\nCroatian Armed Forces\n\n(stožerni general) insignia\n\nCroatian Navy\n\n(admiral flote) insignia\n\nFrance\n\n[edit]\n\nIn France, the term \"five-star general/admiral\" refers commonly to the highest full general or admiral rank,[5][6] equivalent to other armed forces' four-star OF-9 rank, as, due to historical complications and the former existence of a rank of brigadier distinct from that of brigade general, French general officers have one more star than their equivalent-rank counterparts in most countries.[7][8]\n\nThe ranks of equivalent stature and precedence to other countries' 5-star ranks are known in France as the Marshal of France (Maréchal de France) and the Admiral of France (Amiral de France), and are nominally 7-star \"dignities\" (there is no 6-star rank). As of late 2023, there have been 342 Marshals of France, of which 78 have been appointed since the Napoleonic revival of the office in the early 19th Century, the most recent being Pierre Kœnig, elevated posthumously to the Marshalcy in 1984. In the same period, there have been 14 Admirals of France, the last being appointed in 1869.[9] Of the 78 Marshals, 77 Marshals have been drawn from the ranks of the Army, and one from the Gendarmerie, Bon-Adrien Jeannot de Moncey, who also had a significant service history as an army officer during foreign campaigns. No officer from the French Air Force has been elevated to the Marshalcy to date. Moreover, one French officer, Darlan, was appointed to the sui generis rank of \"Admiral of the Fleet\", outranking ordinary full admirals, in order to grant him equal rank and status to his then-British counterpart, who held the higher rank. Darlan does not appear to have received any particular insignia at home in France.[10]\n\nGermany\n\n[edit]\n\nGerman Empire\n\n[edit]\n\nNazi Germany\n\n[edit]\n\nGeneralfeldmarschall in the Heer equivalent in the English-speaking world general of the army\n\nGeneralfeldmarschall in the Luftwaffe equivalent in the English-speaking world marshal of the air force\n\nGroßadmiral in the Kriegsmarine equivalent in the English-speaking world admiral of the fleet\n\nReichsführer-SS in the Schutzstaffel (SS) equivalent in the English-speaking world captain of the guard\n\nIt is also worth noting that this was not the apex and there was a six-star rank also present in the Wehrmacht known as Reichsmarschall, however it was only ever present in the Luftwaffe and only ever held by one man: Hermann Göring, arguably the second most powerful man in Nazi Germany.[11]\n\nIndia\n\n[edit]\n\nField marshal, held by two officers\n\nMarshal of the Indian Air Force, held by one officer\n\nAdmiral of the fleet, never been held\n\nField marshal epaulette\n\nFlag of a field marshal\n\nStar insignia of a field marshal\n\nMarshal of the Indian Air Force rank insignia\n\nFlag of the marshal of the Indian Air Force\n\nFlag of the marshal of the Indian Air Force (1950–1980)\n\nMarshal of the Indian Air Force sleeve insignia\n\nMarshal of the Indian Air Force sleeve insignia\n\nAdmiral of the fleet sleeve insignia\n\nFlag of the admiral of the fleet (2001–2004)\n\nGeneral Sam Manekshaw was the first officer to be promoted to five-star rank. He was promoted to the rank of field marshal on 1 January 1973 after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. General K. M. Cariappa, the first Indian commander-in-chief of the Indian Army was promoted to the rank of field marshal in 1986. In 2001, Air Chief Marshal Arjan Singh was promoted to the rank of marshal of the Indian Air Force (MIAF). Around 1998, the Indian Air Force introduced gorget patches (or collar tabs) for its air officers. The MIAF's patches display five stars.[12]\n\nIndonesia\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to Government Regulation No. 32/1997,[13] the Indonesian five-star ranks are:\n\nJenderal besar (grand general) – only awarded to three people:\n\nSoedirman, the rank was granted posthumously.\n\nAbdul Haris Nasution, the rank was granted 26-years after his retirement.\n\nSoeharto (second president of Indonesia), his rank was granted during his own rule.\n\nLaksamana besar (grand admiral) – never awarded\n\nMarsekal besar (grand marshal) – never awarded\n\nThe five-star ranks above are honorary rank and does not provide additional authority or responsibility.\n\nHowever, Government Regulation No. 32/1997 has been revoked and replaced by Government Regulation No. 39/2010,[14] and the latest regulation does not mention a five-star rank.

US Army General Douglas MacArthur was the first and only field marshal in the history of the Philippine Army, a position he held while also acting as the military advisor to the commonwealth government of the Philippines with a rank of major general. President Quezon conferred the rank of field marshal on 24 August 1936 and MacArthur's duty included the supervision of the creation of the Philippines nation-state.\n\nMinistro Mariskal insignia\n\nPhilippine Revolutionary Army\n\nGeneral Emilio Aguinaldo, the first holder of five-star rank as the first president and commander-in-chief of the Philippines\n\nGeneral Douglas MacArthur, the first and currently the only field marshal in Philippine history\n\nPoland\n\n[edit]\n\nMarshal of Poland (Marszałek Polski) is a Polish Army five-star rank. There are today no living marshals of Poland, since this rank is bestowed only on military commanders who have achieved victory in war. The last appointment was in 1963 to Marian Spychalski.\n\nMarshal of Poland cap insignia\n\nMarshal of Poland shoulder-strap insignia\n\nPortugal\n\n[edit]\n\nDifferent from most other countries, the marshals (Army and Air Force) and admirals of the fleet (Navy) of Portugal are not identified by five stars, but by four golden stars, in comparison with generals and admirals who are also identified by four stars, but in silver.\n\nFive-star appointments—and not ranks—were however foreseen in the armed forces of Portugal, at different times in the past, for the officers exercising the several government posts related with defense (minister of national defense, minister for the army, secretary of state for the army, etc.).\n\nRomania\n\n[edit]\n\nMareșal al Armatei Române (marshal of the Romanian Army) is the highest military rank in the Romanian military forces. This rank can be bestowed to persons from the royal family or to four-star generals or admirals during wartime only. After World War II, the latest surviving marshal of Romania was King Michael I, who was bestowed this rank on May 10, 1941 (the national day of Romania). He died in December 2017.\n\nThe epaulettes insignia of a Romanian marshal\n\nSouth Vietnam\n\n[edit]\n\nGeneral of the army (Thống tướng), Army-held by one officer\n\nAdmiral of the fleet (Thủy sư Đô đốc), Navy\n\nGeneral of the air force (Thống tướng), Air Force\n\nFive-star ranks were used by the former Republic of Vietnam Military Forces during the Vietnam War, from 1955 to 1975.

Promotion to the rank of field marshal was generally stopped in 1995 as a cost-cutting measure but is still made in some cases.[24][25] As of 2024 the most recent appointments to five-star ranks were the promotions in 2012 of the Prince of Wales to honorary five-star rank in all three services, and of former Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Guthrie of Craigiebank to the honorary rank of field marshal.[25][26] In 2014 the former Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Stirrup was promoted to the honorary rank of marshal of the Royal Air Force.[27]\n\nDuring World War II and after, serving NATO, a small number of British five-star commanders have held the additional title Supreme Allied Commander, given operational control over all air, land, and sea units led by the four-star commanders of multi-national forces.\n\nUnited States\n\n[edit]\n\nFleet admiral (held by four officers)\n\nGeneral of the Army (held by five officers)\n\nGeneral of the Air Force (held by one officer)\n\nBefore the five-star ranks were established in 1944,[1] two officers had previously been promoted from their four-star ranks to the superior and unique ranks of Admiral of the Navy and General of the Armies: Admiral George Dewey (appointment 1903 retroactive to 1899, died 1917) and General John J. Pershing (appointed 1919, died 1948). In 1944 the Navy and Army specified that these officers were considered senior to any officers promoted to the five-star ranks within their services (but it was not clear if they were senior by rank or by seniority due to an earlier date of rank).\n\nFive-star ranks were created in the U.S. military during World War II because of the awkward situation created when some American senior commanders were placed in positions commanding allied officers of higher rank.[28] U.S. officers holding five-star rank draw full active duty pay for life, both before and after retiring from active duty.[29] The five-star ranks were retired in 1981 on the death of General of the Army Omar Bradley.[28]\n\nNine Americans have been promoted to five-star rank, one of them, Henry H. Arnold, in two services (U.S. Army then later in the U.S. Air Force). As part of the bicentennial celebration, George Washington was, 177 years after his death, permanently made senior to all other U.S. generals and admirals with the title General of the Armies effective on 4 July 1976. The appointment stated he was to have \"rank and precedence over all other grades of the Army, past or present\".[nb 2]\n\nDuring World War II and (later) serving NATO, a small number of American five-star commanders have also held the additional title of Supreme Allied Commander, given operational control over all air, land, and sea units led by the four-star commanders of multi-national forces.\n\nFleet admiral collar device, sleeve stripes and shoulder board\n\nGeneral of the Army shoulder epaulet\n\nGeneral of the Air Force shoulder epaulet\n\nLaw enforcement usage\n\n[edit]\n\nIn various law enforcement agencies, such as the Detroit Police Department and Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, their respective heads wear five-star ranks.[30]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nFour-star rank\n\nList of field marshals\n\nList of fleet and grand admirals\n\nList of marshals of the Air Force\n\nRanks and insignia of NATO\n\nSix-star rank\n\nHeraldic origin of the use of five-pointed star\n\nDesign of US army insignia\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]"
