        "text": "\"Right away, fast moving enemies cascade down the screen. Youll see the inspiration for the follow up game, Super Star Soldier for the Turbografx-16 (well, obviously), but also for Blazing Lazers for that same system. You'll play this game and think, ''the vertical shooter genre hasn't come very far, has it? Star Soldier had it all!'' That's very high praise you're giving out, you know. But other than the fact that variety is lacking, and theres no real ending, its true. Star Soldier does appear to have it all - Hudson Soft be praised. \""
