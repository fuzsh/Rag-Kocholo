        "text": "The United Federation of Planets not a military organization, and it's true that the primary mission of the Enterprise is of exploration and investigation. However, I think it's clear that Starfleet is at least partly a military organization, and the crew of the ships that make up Starfleet as military personnel, regardless of how its Public Relations department tries to spin it:\n\nThe ships are outfitted with high-tech weapons; not just defensive but potent offensive capabilities\n\nThey follow a military command rank structure\n\nThey carry firearms\n\nThey are trained in combat techniques.\n\nWhat is true, and what would be a more accurate thing to say, is that the Starfleet's military force is not a conquering or agressive force. They are almost entirely devoted to peace-keeping operations, the kind that real-world armies participate in all the time. They exist to support the civilian portion of Starfleet, and the UFP in general, in safely doing their job.\n\nKirk, as the captain of a ship, is not a diplomat. Starfleet has a whole group of dedicated ambassadors that are trained and selected for their dimplomatic skills; Kirk was selected for his ability to command a ship and a crew, to protect those diplomats during their missions. As a Captain, he's obviously expected to have some basic concept of how to make first contact successfully, and how not to ruin diplomatic relationships with other species, but that is not his job and not where his training lies.\n\nRodenberry had a vision of the future where aggression and war were things that Earth had grown out of, and the UFP and Starfleet were part of that vision. However, he also clearly had respect for the idea of a well-trained, properly used military force as an instrument of peace and protection. There's no reason why he would not have recognized the need to have \"soldiers\" protecting the \"diplomats\" from the dangers of unknown deep space, even in his perfect future.\n\nWhile \"Starfleet is a military organization\" is an inaccurate summary of Starfleet's mission, it is impossible to deny that there isn't aren't military components in Starfleet.\n\nCommand structure and customs follow a naval (military) tradition.\n\nShips have extensive offensive and defensive weapons\n\nChief tactical officer is a senior position and \"an evolution of the armory officer position\" of earlier times.\n\nWhen war does break out, Starfleet is the organization that responds.\n\nThe difference between a military organization and Starfleet is that Starfleet does much more than being a military. The bulk of its resources are dedicated to science and exploration.\n\nSimilarly, though a banking institution employs extensive security measures that are vital to its success, it would be inaccurate to summarize Wells Fargo as a \"security company\". The bulk of its resources are dedicated to financial development.\n\nThere are a few roles in Starfleet that require a \"soldier\". Chief tactical officer is one. Captain is another.\n\nIn reality, captain is a bit of everything, including a diplomat.\n\nFederation, and before that United Earth, Starfleet starship commanders were sometimes called upon to serve as diplomats, whether by specific assignment or by emergent necessity.\n\nDiplomat, Memory Alpha\n\nFor example, when necessary, Captain Picard took over formal diplomatic responsibilities for Sarek.\n\nThat, however, was only by necessity. Starfleet -- being primarily a non-military organization -- has high-ranking specialists in diplomacy, given the official title \"Diplomat\". Kirk was (ideally) a diplomat, but he was not a Diplomat. In the context of the Organian council, he was expressing this lack of specialization.\n\nStar Trek parallels earlier exploration eras in Earth history - especially Age of Discovery; when soldiers (or fighting sailors, especially captains or expedition leads) typically were the designated diplomats, especially in case of new explorations - in part, because they were pretty much the person with the highest authority of their sovereign ruler present on the scene.\n\nHistory is replete with diplomats who were soldiers, or even ship captains or military leaders: James Spens, Cook, Magellan, Cardinal Mazarini, Yermak, Kruzenstern, Bellinsgauzen, Vasco Núñez de Balboa, Coronado, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, de Champlain, Bernardino de Mendoza, Pyotr Potemkin, Fyodor Leontiyevich Shaklovity, etc...\n\nPlease note that preponderance of Russian and Spanish personas on the list is mostly because that's the history I'm most familiar with. Examples from other countries should be easy to come by. I limited myself to listing the names that I was familiar with already from my prior reading.\n\nWith the exception of Mazarini (who was primarily a diplomat and later a stateman), they were all more of sailors or soldiers first, and diplomats second."
