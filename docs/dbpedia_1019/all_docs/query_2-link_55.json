        "text": "the golden orders are few and they are gathered little by little, among them the soldiers of the battle pass who, oh surprise, are worse than the common soldiers, I do not suggest that they become OP and object of P2W criticism, but that at least they equal the best versions of the classes.\n\nHere is the comparison\n\nWhenever you buy, (at least in my case) a battle pass soldier, it will be a class rank lower than common (hence the comparison) my point is that a battle pass soldier does not equal a class 4, as I said, I don’t want them to be better, I just want them to be at the level of the respective last class rank, at no time did I want to compare a rank 3 soldier with a rank 4, but rather to demonstrate that the one with the pass is inferior to the rank, it is not bad, but removes incentive to buy.\n\nOne more time… it’s not a comparison, it’s a demonstration that the soldiers in the pass (except engineers and radio operators) are lower in rank, at the top rank of the class, you buy an AT and an AT 1 comes out instead of an AT 2, what I suggest is that they match the last rank.\n\neven your photo proves my point and even worse because one of the same ranks beats them… But the fact is that having rank 3 riflemen who are obviously better than rank 2 riflemen, the soldiers of the pass should be equivalent to rank 3 (in this specific example) and so on with all classes.\n\nGO are supposed to be max perk for their tier. There are some event soldiers (Twitch Drops for example) that are not I believe, however. I believe some older ones that are sunset were never upped to max though.\n\nNo, I don’t believe that GO should have perks beyond their tier, nor automatically change tier as a new one is available or unlocked. Reasoning is you may not have leveled that up, and therefore may lose out on upgrades (such as bag slot etc). Also, each tier has a different starter perk that is “unique” to it.\n\nFor Example: Rifleman:\n\nRifleman I: +10.5% speed of decreasing of the shot spread after quick turning.\n\nRifleman II: +5.4% sprint speed\n\nRifleman III: +15% medpack usage speek\n\nNow, if you were suggesting that you be able to SELECT the tier of the GO soldier and it still be maxed for that tier, then I would not have a problem with that changing.\n\nAlso note that with the new update coming, GO soldiers will now grant +20% Squad leveling XP for the entire squad that they are in. So having different tier soldiers available becomes a good thing for leveling (as said, you may have things like bag slots for one, but not the other)."
