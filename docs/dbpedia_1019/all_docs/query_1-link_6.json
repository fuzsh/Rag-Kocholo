It is the sequel to Star Soldier, and part of a vertical-scrolling shooter series by Hudson Soft. According to the company, many people believed Super Star Soldier's graphics were the best of any HuCard game.

Konami published it for the Virtual Console on Nintendo's Wii system in North America on November 27, 2006,[1] and in Japan[2] and Europe in December.[3] The game has also been released on the Japanese PlayStation Store on August 19, 2009 and on the North American PlayStation Store on June 3, 2011.

It consists of eight levels.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nTaking place four years after Star Soldier, the original galactic invaders known as the Star Brain corps have returned from their crushing defeat from the Cesear star fighter and they are now led by the ultimate spaceship, Mother Brain.
