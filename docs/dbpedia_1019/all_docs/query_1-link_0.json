        "text": "This article is about the video game series. For the first game in the series, see Star Soldier (video game).\n\nVideo game series\n\nStar SoldierGenre(s)Scrolling shooterDeveloper(s)Hudson SoftPublisher(s)Hudson SoftPlatform(s)MSX, NES, TurboGrafx-16, Super Famicom, Nintendo 64, GameCube, Game Boy Advance, Mobile phone, PlayStation Portable, Wii, iOSFirst releaseStar Soldier\n\nJune 13, 1986Latest releaseStar Soldier R\n\nMarch 25, 2008Spin-offsStarship Hector\n\nBlazing Lazers\n\nStar Parodier\n\nStar Soldier[a] is a series of scrolling shooters mainly developed by Hudson Soft. Konami has owned the rights to the series since their absorption of Hudson Soft in 2012. The first game, named Star Soldier, appeared on the MSX and NES in 1986, and the series has continued on various gaming systems. Star Soldier itself was released with little change in a compilation for the Super Famicom in 1995, received enhanced remakes for both the GameCube and PlayStation 2 in 2003, and a different remake for the PlayStation Portable in 2005, while the latest installment of the series was released on the Wii as a WiiWare game in 2008. In addition, Super Star Soldier, Final Soldier, Soldier Blade and Star Parodier have been re-released on the Wii's Virtual Console and on the Japanese PC Engine's Best Collection lineup for the PSP. The Star Soldier games are best known for their distinctive music, unique weapon power-ups, and a special time attack high score mode called \"Caravan Mode\".[1]\n\nCaravan gaming tournaments\n\n[edit]\n\nStar Soldier was developed as a spiritual successor to Tecmo's Star Force, from which it borrows most of its gameplay elements. The Star Force series, along with Hudson's Star Soldier, was often featured in the popular Japanese gaming tournament known as \"Hudson All-Japan Caravan Festival\". Home ports of Star Soldier games would sometimes feature \"Caravan\" modes in which the player would race through timed stages while trying to accumulate a high score.\n\nCommon elements\n\n[edit]\n\nBeing an arcade-style game, Star Soldier's objective is primarily based on achieving a high score. The series often makes use of hidden destructible tiles that offer bonus points when shot, but may occasionally power-up the player's ship instead. Bonus points will also be awarded for defeating sequences of enemy formations while they are within a certain proximity to the player's ship, or defeating mini bosses before they have a chance to attack.\n\nGames\n\n[edit]\n\nRelease timeline1986Star Soldier1987Starship Hector198819891990Super Star Soldier1991Final Soldier1992Soldier BladeStar Parodier199319941995Caravan Shooting Collection199619971998Star Soldier: Vanishing Earth19992000200120022003Star Soldier (GCN)20042005Star Soldier (PSP)20062007Soldier Collection2008Star Soldier R\n\n1986: Star Soldier - MSX, Famicom/NES, Game Boy Advance, iOS, Wii VC, 3DS VC, Nintendo Online (Switch).\n\nStar Soldier Special+ - Mobile Phone\n\nStar Soldier SP Arcade - Mobile Phone\n\nStar Soldier Fukkoku-Ban - Mobile Phone\n\n1990: Super Star Soldier - PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16, Wii VC, Windows Store, Wii U VC\n\n1991: Final Soldier - PC Engine, Wii VC, Wii U VC\n\n1992: Soldier Blade - PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16, Wii VC, Wii U VC\n\n1992: Star Parodier - PC Engine CD ROM, Wii VC\n\n1998: Star Soldier: Vanishing Earth - Nintendo 64\n\n2008: Star Soldier R - Wii (WiiWare)\n\n2010: Star Soldier Mission Mode - Mobile Phone\n\n2013: Star Soldier for GREE - iOS\n\nDuring the Konami Action & Shooting Contest hosted by the Shueisha Game Creator’s Camp and Tokyo Game Show 2022, Beep won the rights from Konami to develop the game through the competition, a game titled Star Soldier RE:VIVE Multiverse is in development.[2]\n\nCrossover\n\n[edit]\n\n2006: Star Soldier vs DoDonPachi DaiOuJou CARAVAN'06 - Mobile Phone\n\n2018: Super Bomberman R - Nintendo Switch\n\n2018: Pixel Puzzle Collection - iOS, Android\n\nCompilations and remakes\n\n[edit]\n\n1995: Caravan Shooting Collection - SNES\n\nCompilation of Star Force, Star Soldier and Starship Hector\n\n2003: Star Soldier - GameCube, PS2\n\n3D remake with arranged stages\n\n2005: Star Soldier - PSP\n\nEnhanced port of the 2003 remake\n\n2006: Hudson Best Collection Vol. 5: Shooting Collection - GBA\n\nCompilation of Star Force, Star Soldier and Starship Hector\n\n2008: PC Engine Best Collection: Soldier Collection - PSP\n\nCompilation of Super Star Soldier, Final Soldier, Star Parodier and Soldier Blade\n\nCanceled games\n\n[edit]\n\n1995: Kuma Soldier - PC-FX[3]\n\nOther media\n\n[edit]\n\n1985–1987: Famicom Rocky - manga: Star Soldier is one of the videogames based on the manga.\n\n1986-1987: Famicom Cap - manga: Star Soldier is one of the videogames based on the manga.\n\n1986–1987: Nekketsu!
