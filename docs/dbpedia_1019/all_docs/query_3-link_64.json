        "text": "The soundtrack for the 2005 feature film that combines characters from the three Star God shows into a single storyline. Sadly, one's reaction to the soundtrack itself will differ greatly, as most of the music is just extended themes from the Super Fleet Sazer-X show as opposed to a completely original score. Hiroshi Takagi did compose some unique music for the movie, but sadly its few and far between here. For all intents and purposes, the music also sounds like the same very limited size orchestra from the show was also used, as the music doesn't sound anymore \"grand\" as one would have hoped for a feature film. Regardless, there are a couple of nice cues off this release, in particular \"The Terrible Beast Appears!\" which conveys an almost serial-like mentality to the monster appearing, befitting the show it comes from, along with \"Large Pinch!\" which is probably the most interesting cue from the show and that not too surprinsgly goes for the movie as well.\n\nThe disc also features some recycled themes from previous Toho endeavors, such as the \"Life Goes On\" song from The Gransazers (2003) and the title song for The Justirisers (2004), both of which are present in their shorter versions instead of the extended tracks. Among the reoccurring music is also Akira Ifukube's \"Gotengo theme,\" which is the one that plays when the ship flies off to face the Mu Submarine in the original Atragon (1963).\n\nOverall, it's not a bad soundtrack if one enjoys the music from the show, but it does make owning both this and the regular Super Fleet Sazer-X CD (Vol. 1) a little redundant to anyone outside of completists. On a side note, this release also comes with a sticker of the image seen on the cover.\n\nRating:"
