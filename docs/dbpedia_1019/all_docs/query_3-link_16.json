        "text": "This unusual arcade game system is cartridge based and it incorporates very specialized controls. The mother board does not use any of the usual control inputs, except for coins one and two. It looks for two special control sets while it is booting. If they are not found, the game will not work.\n\nThe controls are a dual/convertable 8-way joystick and a digital-analog joystick. The optics are like those found on a 360 degree steering wheel so it could be considered a two-in-one joystick. The special joystick is a digital control where it combines the Up, Down, Left, Right, 1, 2, 3, 4 and Start input signals into a single data line that runs straight to the mother board. So all input signals go through the special joystick circuit board and then to the 3 position connector (blue and white) -- see picture.\n\nThere are only three known cartridges for this system:\n\nStar Soldier - Vanishing Earth will work with either analog or 8-way controls.\n\nEleven Beat World Tournament (Soccer) will only play with the analog setting of the controls.\n\nVivid Dolls is a strip type game similar to Gals Panic\n\nDIP switch bank 1 switch 8 sets the joystick type. DIP switch bank 2 switch 8 enables self test mode."
