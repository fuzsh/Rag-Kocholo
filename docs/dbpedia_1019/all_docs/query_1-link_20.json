The game contains both horizontally and vertically scrolling segments. The player's starship has two modes of fire: one to tackle flying enemies and one for ground-based ones.\n\nStarship Hector is a follow-up to Hudson Soft's earlier shooter Star Soldier, itself inspired by Tecmo's Star Force, an arcade game that Hudson had ported to the Famicom in 1985. The background music of Starship Hector was reused as background music in Super Star Soldier. The theme also appears in the Wii game Kororinpa, which itself has many themes from older Hudson Soft games.\n\nThe game was released in 1995 for the Super Famicom, along with Star Force and Star Soldier, in the Caravan Shooting Collection released exclusively in Japan."
