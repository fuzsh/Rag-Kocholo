        "text": "I’m feeling pretty dang sunny after the jolly Panic Restaurant, so why not keep the lighthearted groove going another week with that staple of vintage Japanese gaming, the cute-’em-up? Allow me to introduce Kaneko and Hudson Soft’s Star Parodier. This 1992 Super CD-ROM release is most often described, and dismissed, as a simple rip-off of Konami’s already established Parodius franchise. There’s some truth to that, too. The shared naming convention, for instance. Parodius is parody Gradius, Star Parodier is parody Star Soldier. Subtle it’s not. The two also share the core conceit of disparate characters and settings from the publisher’s back catalog colliding in absurd ways, as the Caesar ship from Star Soldier now fights alongside Bomberman and an anthropomorphic version of the PC Engine console itself.\n\nBut does originality really matter all that much in the context of a work this silly? This isn’t a storytelling or world building exercise, it’s an excuse for a flying game console to drop bombs on walruses. I mean, the heroes launch their campaign against the forces of the evil Mother Brain from a space carrier ship modeled on the short-lived PC Engine SuperGrafx unit. It’s awfully tough to nitpick when you’re grinning from ear-to-ear at touches like that.\n\nA skilled run through the game’s eight vertical scrolling stages will take you around forty minutes. You also have the option of practicing a standalone “Caravan” score attack level, despite Star Parodier never actually being the focus of an All-Japan Caravan Festival. The general flow of the action is based closely on the three previous 16-bit Star Soldier entries, with the occasional cheeky nod to Blazing Lazers for good measure. In other words, it’s top-notch stuff; fast, smooth, and addictive. Veterans will spot many familiar enemy patterns and boss designs through their wacky new coats of paint.\n\nThe three playable characters are what give Star Parodier’s gameplay an identity of its own, preventing it from lapsing into pure retread. Each hero has his, her, or its own selection of three main shot types and two supplementary pickups, as well as a unique super bomb blast effect. Bomberman is all about dealing big damage. PC Engine focuses on defense, with weaker weapons that cover more of the screen. Caesar (or rather ParoCaesar, as it’s dubbed here) aims to strike a balance between the latter two extremes. It’s a well conceived, well implemented system and seeing the PC Engine launch HuCards and CDs to mow down the opposition is practically worth the price of admission on it its own. That said, I can’t help but wish we’d been treated to an even bigger roster of classic Hudson stars. Imagine how cool it would be to play as Master Higgins/Takahashi Meijin from Adventure Island, complete with stone axe and boomerang weapons.\n\nIt’s an ancient reviewer cliché to observe that a cutesy game isn’t nearly as soft as it lets on. In the case of Star Parodier, however, looks aren’t deceiving in the least. It’s more forgiving than any of the proper Star Soldier installments that came before. In fact, it’s the overall easiest PC Engine shooter I’ve played to date. I’ve yet to legitimately game over on it and had to go out of my way to kill myself off in order to test whether or not it offers unlimited continues. It does. Only the final boss and a couple very brief sections in the later stages were able to give me the slightest pause. Needless to say, this is great news for newcomers to the genre. Experts will want to head into the options menu and crank the difficulty up first thing.\n\nAs expected, Star Parodier’s graphics skew bright and colorful throughout. The sprite and background design clearly owes a lot to the TwinBee series. Regardless of whether you’re inclined to judge that copying or homage, it’s executed fine. The music by Hiroshi Saito, Jin Watanabe, and Shinichi Sakamoto is primarily cheery synthesizer fare. It edges into prog rock territory when things get intense, though, and that’s how I like it best. One section from a boss theme could have come straight out of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer’s “Tarkus.” I guess Nobuo Uematsu isn’t the only fan of that one.\n\nStar Parodier delivers on multiple fronts. If you’re into cute stuff, overhead shooters, or the Star Soldier saga in particular, you’re all but guaranteed to find something to love about it. Fans of all three will be in hog heaven. Too bad it debuted toward the end of the classic shooter era, a time when fighters, beat-’em-ups, and mascot platformers dominated the medium. Thus, it never benefited from the many refining sequels the older Parodius did. A planned North American localization, Fantasy Star Soldier, was ultimately shelved due to the TurboGrafx-CD’s dismal sales. Star Parodier would remain a region-locked obscurity for years until it was finally reissued digitally on the Wii in 2008. Most recently, it was made available physically for the first time outside Japan on the 2020 PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 Mini consoles. However you manage to access this one, you’re in for a walrus-blasting good time.\n\nOur world can be a terrifyingly uncertain place. Saving it from aliens, though? That’s simple. With this in mind, let’s escape to 2092 and join the heroic SIA (Special Interception Air force) as they defend Earth from the invading Zeograd Army in Soldier Blade for the TurboGrafx-16.\n\nDeveloped and published by Hudson Soft in 1992, Soldier Blade caps off a de facto trilogy of 16-bit Star Soldier sequels that began with 1990’s Super Star Soldier and continued the following year with the deceptively named Final Soldier. It boasts quite the sterling reputation, with some fans proclaiming it the finest vertical shooter available on a platform teeming with them. I don’t think I have the experience under my belt yet to confirm or deny that. I can say that it’s my personal favorite Soldier title by a good margin, however. It’s no quantum leap over its predecessors, but it is the best looking, best sounding, and best balanced of the three.\n\nThese games aren’t known for their complexity or innovation. No frills arcade style shooting is the order of the day, and Soldier Blade stays true to form throughout its seven moderate length stages. There’s a streamlined power-up system in effect that revolves around three shot types: Red bullets (the default), blue lasers, and green energy waves. Collecting an icon of the corresponding color will switch you to that type and snagging multiples of the same color in a row will raise your current weapon’s level, to a maximum of three. Keeping your level up is key, since it pulls double duty as your health. As long as it’s sitting at two or better, taking a hit will downgrade your firepower one step instead of killing you outright.\n\nAn interesting new wrinkle is the way Soldier Blade handles its bombs and option drones. Final Soldier combined these two functions into a single item. Soldier Blades takes this a step further by implementing a sort of grand unified power-up scheme. The last three weapon icons you’ve collected are kept in stock as bombs. The most recently acquired one also trails your ship and functions as an option. When needed, you can sacrifice your active option to trigger a powerful bomb attack. Unlike in Final Soldier, the type of attack produced isn’t always the same. Rather, it’s tied to the color of the option sacrificed. Green is a massive homing orb, for example, and blue a gigantic sustained laser blast. Additionally, expending an option in this way has the potential to alter your primary shot, which will automatically be set to match the color of the next one in the rotation. In essence, there’s only one type of pickup in Soldier Blade and it governs all aspects of your offense and defense. Elegant!\n\nAbove all, what elevates Soldier Blade above the previous two Star Soldiers for me is the goldilocks quality of its difficulty balancing. Super Star Soldier felt like more of an ordeal than a game at times, even with the unlimited continues common to the series. The terminally laid-back Final Soldier embraced the opposite extreme. Soldier Blade gets it just right. I’m never frustrated or bored at any point during a playthrough.\n\nBeyond that, all the elements at play here, familiar as they are, have an extra layer of refinement to them. Boss encounters are deeper and more dynamic, with each mechanical monstrosity having several distinct parts that need to be taken out over the course of the fight. I especially love how the last boss shows up as early as the first level to take a few potshots at you before retreating. Lord knows it’s rare for a shooter of this vintage to put any kind of effort into establishing an antagonist like that, but Soldier Blade goes the extra mile. The same can be said for the graphics and music. Sprites are detailed and colorful, backgrounds showcase some superb parallax scrolling effects, and the soundtrack rocks so hard that I had to make a concerted effort not to focus too much on it as I was playing lest I crash and burn.\n\nMy only real gripe with Soldier Blade’s gameplay is that your main weapons don’t really perform that differently under normal conditions. Whether you’re using the bullets, lasers, or energy waves, your shot pattern starts out narrow and then gradually expands to cover a wider forward arc. Thus, they’re largely interchangeable. The only noteworthy exception is the bullets, which also fire behind you when upgraded. I would have preferred more variety. Better yet, they could have kept Final Soldier’s awesome weapon edit mode. Oh, well. As it is, the selection is at least adequate.\n\nSoldier Blade doesn’t revolutionize the genre, nor does it need to. It’s a brilliantly polished gem of an overhead shooter: Fast, smooth, addicting, and one hell of a looker. Hudson Soft seemingly learned all the right lessons from past installments, resulting in a quintessential Star Soldier experience slick and well-paced enough to entertain veterans without scaring off newcomers. Perfect for any time you’d rather be struggling against another planet’s monsters for a change.\n\nFor a simple PC Engine shoot-’em-up, 1991’s Final Soldier is a surprisingly tricky game to write about. Produced by Hudson Soft and developed by Now Production, it’s the third entry in Hudson’s flagship Star Soldier line of vertical shooters. Upholding series tradition, it served as the centerpiece of that year’s Hudson All-Japan Caravan Festival, a long-running (1985-2006) annual high score contest the company used to promote its latest games. It’s well-designed, attractively presented alien blasting. It’s…well, it’s more Star Soldier. See what I mean? Only one paragraph into this review and I’m already running short of material.\n\nWhen dealing with a franchise this consistent, I’m probably best off adopting a Mega Man approach. That is, getting the boilerplate stuff out of the way as quickly as possible so I can focus instead on the subtle tweaks that make a specific installment ever so slightly different from what came before. Here goes!\n\nFinal Soldier has a classic space shooter plot, in that it’s short, sweet, and confined entirely to the instruction booklet. Time travelling aliens called the Gader’el are attacking 23rd century Earth and the experimental Dryad fighter craft is humanity’s last line of defense. Its mission encompasses seven lengthy stages set in a variety of conventional video game locales, such as outer space, the ocean, and a futuristic city. Each zone has a pushover mid-boss and a tougher end boss, except the final one, which is an extended running battle against the ultimate baddie and its swarm of minions. Nothing special, but kudos to the developers for not padding the finale out with a lazy boss rush like so many other shooters of the era.\n\nThe weapon system is where things get interesting. The Dryad has a machine gun type main shot by default and this can be swapped out for energy waves, lasers, or a flamethrower by picking up icons of the appropriate color dropped by defeated enemies. Grabbing multiple same colored icons in a row will level-up your current weapon, increasing its area of effect and damage. Upgraded weapons also double as armor, since getting hit while wielding one results in a loss of firepower in lieu of instant death. Missiles and Gradius style option pods round out your arsenal, which is a pretty typical one by genre standards. Final Soldier’s ace in the hole is the Set-Up menu accessed from the title screen. Here, you can change the properties of the energy wave, laser, flamethrower, and missiles (though not the machine gun for some reason). The three modes available for a given weapon have a profound effect on its operation. For example, the normal straight laser shot can be swapped out for a chaotic torrent of blue bubbles. This effectively ups the number of unique weapons in the game from a modest five to a generous thirteen. Even the option pods have a nifty secondary function: You can sacrifice them as needed to trigger a full-screen super attack.\n\nAnother factor that differentiates Final Soldier from earlier Star Soldier outings is its relative ease. Super Star Soldier pushed my patience to the limit with its grueling, glitchy last area. Someone behind the scenes must have felt the same way, because there’s nothing remotely comparable here. Final Soldier’s default difficulty setting will be a cakewalk for any experienced player. Not that I’m complaining. It’s a more casual “kick back and blaze away” experience and reminds me of some of my favorite Compile-developed shooters in this regard. If you’re a fellow Gun-Nac or Space Megaforce fan, you’ll be right at home. Besides, I can always throw Super Star Soldier back on if I want an ass kicking.\n\nSo there you have it: Final Soldier is the same tried-and-true Star Soldier formula with a deeper than average weapon system and a relaxed approach to challenge. Between its crisp graphics, high energy music, silky smooth control, and viscerally satisfying shooting action, you really can’t go wrong with this one. While I wouldn’t rank it at the very top of the PCE heap with Air Zonk and Blazing Lazers, it’s still a highly competent work with no outstanding flaws. Pity it was destined to be the “lost” Star Soldier game back in the day, having never been ported to the North American TurboGrafx-16 like its predecessor, Super Star Soldier, or its sequel, Soldier Blade. Sequel? Why, of course! You didn’t think this was the final one, did you?\n\nI wonder if I can get away with listing “flying away from big explosions” on my resume at this point?\n\nOff to the PC Engine I go for another bout of alien ass whupping in 1990’s Super Star Soldier. To understand the origins of the Star Soldier series, we need to start back in 1984, when Tecmo (then called Tehkan) developed the fast-paced vertical shooter Star Force for arcades. The subsequent home release of Star Force on the Famicom proved so wildly popular that its publisher, Hudson Soft, made it the centerpiece of their first annual All-Japan Caravan Festival in 1985.\n\nThis nationwide high score contest generated considerable publicity and Hudson was understandably eager to make it an annual event. Problem was, they needed a new game to center Caravan ’86 around. Preferably one very similar to Star Force…. In other words, Star Soldier was a bit of a copycat. It was a worthy shooter in its own right by the standards of the time, however, and all three of its PC Engine follow-ups (Super Star Soldier, Final Soldier, and Soldier Blade) would headline their own Caravans from 1990-1992.\n\nBefore I move on to discussing Super Star Soldier proper, here’s one last Caravan fun fact I couldn’t resist sharing with you all: We have these early competitions to thank for the rise of none other than Toshiyuki “16 Shot” Takahashi, the gaming prodigy named and famed for his rapid-firing skills in Star Soldier who later served as the real life model for Adventure Island’s Master Higgins. Yes, without these space shooter festivals taking place on the other side of the world, we would never have known the serene majesty of a portly gent in animal skins and baseball cap hurling stone axes at snails while riding a skateboard. What a bleak existence that would be.\n\nThough developed for Hudson by Kaneko, Super Star Soldier will remind PCE/TurboGrafx fans of another, better-known shooter for the platform: Compile’s Blazing Lazers. In much the same way Star Soldier was “inspired” by Star Force, its sequel feels like an unofficial extension of Blazing Lazers. Many of the weapons feel familiar and your ship controls much the same, right down to having variable speed settings toggled with the Select button. Enemy and stage designs have a very Compile/Aleste look and flow to them, as well, although the settings you fly through are slightly less wild here. There are no deadly rainbow bubbles awaiting you this time out, for example. Even the quirky “special lives” mechanic introduced in Blazing Lazers, which has you repeatedly shooting certain power-up icons until they turn into flashing orbs and then collecting those so you can respawn in place when destroyed instead of being sent back to a checkpoint, is carried over. Considering Compile’s towering reputation among shooter fans, the same principle that exonerated the first Star Soldier holds true here: If you’re going to crib, crib from the best.\n\nThe plot, if you can call it that, is like so: Earth is under attack by a pack of evil space brains and their leader, Mother Brain. I tell you, it’s always brains in these old Japanese sci-fi games. So far this year alone, I’ve already killed one at the end of Gradius, another (also named Mother Brain) in Metroid, and a third in Section Z. That’ll teach those squishy bastards to think so much, I guess. Anyway, there’s still hope for us humans because an improved version of the Caesar craft from the last game, dubbed Neo Caesar, has been engineered for just such an emergency. The player assumes the role of the Neo Caesar’s pilot, referred to in the manual as “Starbuck.” Dirk Benedict’s character from Battlestar Galactica, then? Excuse me, but if I have to play as an A-Team alumnus, I’d much prefer Mr. T.\n\nStarbuck’s mission consists of eight stages. Most are variations on the outer space theme with only a couple taking place planetside. Each is fairly long and has its own unique final boss. The exception is, of course, the final stage, which is a punishing five boss gauntlet with a generous compliment of standard enemies sprinkled in for good measure. The entire journey takes around 35 minutes, assuming highly skilled play. That’s a respectable amount of play time for the genre, albeit also less than Blazing Lazers.\n\nThe Neo Caesar has four primary weapons at its disposal, accessed via colored-coded orbs dropped by enemies. These include the default multi-shot machine gun, the wide-angle ring laser, the more focused spread laser, and the powerful, short range swing fire. You can upgrade each weapon multiple times, increasing its area of effect considerably in the process. Taking damage will lower your weapon’s power, so these enhanced armaments also double as your armor in classic Aleste fashion. In general, I found the multi-shot and ring laser to be the best at taking out swarms of regular enemies, while the piercing spread laser was ideal for dealing heavy damage to single targets (i.e. bosses). I actively avoided swing fire for the majority of the game, since its flame jets share the same bright orange color scheme as the enemy’s bullets, which resulted in far too much accidental damage. Too bad. Double flamethrowers should equal pure bliss in any game.\n\nRounding out your arsenal are a couple of useful supplementary items. The Starbuck Defense System is a very fancy name for a very basic pair of “option” satellites that hang out near your ship blocking enemies and their shots. While these will damage foes on contact, they don’t actually multiply your firepower like the options from Gradius. Your other choice, the homing missiles, are entirely self-explanatory. You can only have one primary and one secondary weapon equipped at a given time. Thankfully, power-up drops are quite frequent, so you’ll never have to wait too long for your favorites to show up in the rotation.\n\nSuper Star Soldier poses a respectable challenge without being too overwhelming. For the most part, anyway. It’s definitely tougher than Blazing Lazers thanks to denser enemy patterns, trickier bosses, and no shield pickup or stock of super bombs. At the same time, it’s not totally lacking in clemency. You have weapons-as-armor to prevent those one-hit deaths and unlimited continues to boot. The biggest hurdle by far is the final stage. Defeating five tricky bosses in a row, the last of which has four distinct forms, is no joke. Worst of all is the three minutes or so of regular enemy waves you have to fight your way past before the boss rush even starts. It doesn’t sound like much, but having to wade through these guys over and over each time you continue can really start to wear on you after a while. This is another of those games where I spent significantly more time on the last level than on all the rest combined.\n\nOh, and I can neither forget nor forgive the hellish glitch that put an ugly end to my first full playthrough. See, crashing into enemies in Super Star Soldier damages both parties. The first time I managed to defeat the final boss, it was by accidentally colliding with it, destroying us both in the same instant. I had a ship in reserve, so I wasn’t worried. All I had to do was respawn and watch those credits roll, right? Wrong. I came back like normal, but the game just hung there. The boss music kept on looping as I sat there alone on an endlessly scrolling starfield. With nothing left to kill me and no time limit, all I could was give up and reset the machine. Did I eventually start fresh and beat the boss the normal way so I could have that true ending? I did. Was I happy about it? I was not.\n\nThat freak occurrence aside, there’s very little in Super Star Soldier that’s objectionable and much to appreciate. The audiovisuals meet the usual high Hudson standard and the shooting action is fast, precise, and, above all, satisfying. It’s true that the difficulty curve is a tad lopsided due to that crazy brutal eighth stage and the weapon selection, while adequate, could stand to be broadened. The three other games on the system that share this exact style of play, Blazing Lazers, Final Soldier, and Soldier Blade all have a little more going on mechanically and can be considered slightly better overall. Fortunately, being the weakest of these four still allows Super Star Soldier ample room to stand tall as one of the best shooters on a console synonymous with them. Just don’t try to kamikaze its bosses. Let my pain be your gain."
