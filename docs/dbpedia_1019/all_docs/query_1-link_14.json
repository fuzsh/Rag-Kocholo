It is a spin-off of the Star Soldier series and was localized for North America as Fantasy Star Soldier, but this version was never released.[1] The game was released for the Wii Virtual Console on March 7, 2008 in Japan, March 16 in Europe and later in North America on August 11.[2] The title is also playable on the Turbografx-16/PC Engine Mini Console.\n\nStar Parodier is a vertical scrolling shooter, much like the Star Soldier games, and features many of the same conventions, such as collecting power-ups to upgrade the player's weapons, and facing several bosses and minibosses as they progress through the game. The game also features the 2- and 5-minute high score time attack modes seen in previous games.\n\nIn parodying the hard sci-fi atmosphere of the Star Soldier games, Star Parodier takes a lighthearted approach by featuring cute, cartoonish graphics and toning down the violence (for example, defeated enemies wave white flags in surrender).[3] The players choose from three craft to play as in the game: the Paro Ceaser from Star Soldier, a giant flying Bomberman or an anthropomorphic PC Engine console that shoots HuCards and CD-ROMs at enemies.[4]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nParodius\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
