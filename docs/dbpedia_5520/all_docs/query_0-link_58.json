The assault on Hue City tests the mettle of U.S. forces against a determined enemy in a battle that lasts nearly four weeks.\n\nInformation tabs include shortcuts to pertinent books, articles, academic papers written by MCU CSC students in pursuit of the Master of Military Studies (MMS) degree, maps and photographs, archival materials, and USMC History Division resources. Content may change periodically to present additional supplemental materials which will add value to the EWS Battle Studies curriculum. \"Tags\" include terms or key words that may be useful in researching more on the Hue City course module."
