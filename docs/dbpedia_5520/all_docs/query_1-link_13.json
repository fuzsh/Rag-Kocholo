        "text": "In late January 1968, during the Vietnamese lunar new year (Tet) holiday, the North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong guerilla fighters launched a massive coordinated offensive against U.S. and allied forces across South Vietnam. The offensive largely took U.S. forces by surprise, and fierce fighting broke out across the country. Especially intense action occurred in the city of Hue, and around the besieged Marine base at Khe Sanh. However, after several weeks, most enemy forces had been beaten back, and the offensive failed in its main objectives of inflicting military defeat on U.S. forces or instigating a general uprising against the South Vietnamese government.\n\nTet Offensive Background and History\n\nBy 1968 there were nearly 500,000 U.S. service personnel in the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam), under the overall command of Commander, U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (COMUSMACV) General William C. Westmoreland. Aided by 650,000 Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) personnel, the United States’ mission since 1965 had consisted of Rolling Thunder bombing campaigns against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam), interdiction attempts along the Ho Chi Minh trail, and search and destroy missions against enemy forces throughout the South Vietnamese countryside. Optimism was high among U.S. military and planning personnel that these combined efforts were steadily degrading North Vietnam’s combat capabilities; within the near future, the U.S. intended to turn more and more of South Vietnam’s internal defense over to the ARVN.\n\nA massive communist offensive, beginning in late January 1968, demonstrated that North Vietnam and its allies were still able to put up a fight. Throughout the evening of January 30-31, 1968, during the Vietnamese New Year holiday of Tet, more than 84,000 communist soldiers launched assaults on various U.S. and South Vietnamese military installations, cities, and hamlets. Enemy forces were a mix of North Vietnamese Army (NVA) troops and Viet Cong (VC) guerillas, with the former predominating towards the North – South Vietnamese border. Together they attacked more than 100 South Vietnamese targets, including most large cities, the capital of Saigon, and major U.S. bases. Although the sheer scale of the Tet Offensive was one of its most notable aspects, several actions deserve special mention:\n\nSiege of Khe Sanh: Khe Sanh was a U.S. Marine Corps base in far northwestern South Vietnam, near the North Vietnamese and Laotian borders. The area had long been a hotspot of NVA activity, and a major NVA attack was launched upon the base on January 21, ten days before the broader Tet Offensive. Marine units at Khe Sanh were cut off, and had to be resupplied by air. Although a U.S. Special Forces camp was overrun by North Vietnamese forces (the latter using Soviet-made tanks for the first time in the conflict), the main USMC facility held off all enemy attacks with the assistance of U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps close air support (Operation Niagara). U.S. Army and ARVN troops began Operation Pegasus, a ground assault to reopen road links to Khe Sanh, on April 1; by April 8 the base had been relieved. 6,000 Marines had defended Khe Sanh against an estimated 20,000 PAVN troops for 77 days. The true purpose of the North Vietnamese attack has long been a matter of debate – whether Khe Sanh was intended to divert U.S. attention from the coming Tet Offensive, the Tet Offensive was intended to relieve U.S. pressure on Khe Sanh, or that both operations were part of the overall North Vietnamese strategy. U.S. commanders at the time, including Gen Westmoreland, certainly saw the defense of Khe Sanh as absolutely vital to U.S. forces in Vietnam and treated its relief accordingly.\n\nBattle of Hue: Hue was a major South Vietnamese city, an ancient provincial capital located 60 miles south of the North Vietnamese border. Until the Tet Offensive, it had not been heavily attacked by the NVA or VC, and there was only a small U.S. military (though a large ARVN) presence in the city. On the first day of Tet, a mass attack by a combined NVA and VC force struck Hue without warning; they had specially prepared for urban combat and soon occupied much of the city, including the easily-defensible Citadel (palace of the 19th Century Vietnamese emperors). The closest U.S. units available to respond were Marines from the nearby Phu Bai base, and a plan for the recapture of the city was soon devised: the ARVN would be responsible for retaking the northern portion of Hue (which contained the Citadel), the Marines for the southern portion, and Army elements would be used to defend the outlying portions of the city. The Marines slowly fought through their portion of the city, which involved a great deal of urban house-to-house combat; southern Hue was retaken by February 14, as Marines and Army units linked up in the city’s suburbs. Marine units had also begun assisting the ARVN assault on the Citadel on February 10, and the complex fell to U.S. and South Vietnamese forces on the 24th. The entirety of Hue was back under U.S. and South Vietnamese control on March 2nd, after 26 days of fighting. However, Hue itself had been severely damaged, and communist forces had killed many civilians while they controlled the city. The initial defense and subsequent recapture of Hue was a military victory for U.S. forces, but a shock to South Vietnamese morale.\n\nAttack on Saigon: A major focal point of the Tet Offensive was the South Vietnamese capital city, which had not been heavily attacked prior to Tet. Like Hue, the majority of Saigon was defended by ARVN, though there were substantial U.S. military forces throughout the city and a number of nearby U.S. facilities. Unlike Hue, communist (mainly VC) forces in Saigon prioritized attacking symbolic targets such as the city’s radio station and the U.S. embassy. VC guerillas did breach the U.S. embassy compound, though not the main embassy building, but their lack of coordination meant that Saigon as a whole was never in danger of falling under communist control. U.S. forces moved in from nearby bases and the city had been cleared of organized VC resistance by February 10, though sporadic clashes continued through early March.\n\nThough Khe Sanh and Hue were notable exceptions, most communist forces involved in the Tet Offensive had been defeated and driven back by mid-February. They had failed to achieve either a crushing military victory or a general uprising against the South Vietnamese government. Approximately 1,000 U.S. service personnel and 2,000 ARVN personnel lost their lives through March 1968. Communist losses, though numbers remain uncertain, were at least 40,000; the VC and its operations within South Vietnam were particularly hard-hit. However, the Tet Offensive played a major role in how U.S. policy planners and the U.S. public viewed the ongoing conflict in Vietnam. It was immediately obvious that the NVA and VC were not near defeat, that they could launch attacks nearly anywhere in South Vietnamese territory, and that the ARVN alone could not stop the bulk of these attacks. When Gen Westmoreland called for more than 200,000 additional troops to be sent to Vietnam in the aftermath of Tet, President Lyndon B. Johnson refused to authorize the increase. On March 31, 1968, President Johnson announced he would not run for reelection. Within a year his successor, President Richard Nixon, began the process of Vietnamization—a major shift in U.S. strategy that saw the eventual departure of U.S. military forces from South Vietnam. For the United States, the Tet Offensive had proven to be a military victory and a strategic defeat.\n\nAuthor: Dr. Bradley Cesario, Texas A&M University"
