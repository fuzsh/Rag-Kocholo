Jamal Crawford has told the Hawks that he either wants an extension or to be traded before the season starts. From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution: “Jamal Crawford has told the Hawks he wants to be traded before the 2010-11 season if the team doesn’t offer a contract extension to his liking, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. Crawford, whose current contract expires after the season, asked the Hawks for an extension last month but has yet to receive an answer from the team. If Atlanta balks at offering Crawford what he considers an extension reflecting his market value then he would rather play elsewhere for the final season of his contract, according to the person familiar with the circumstances.”
