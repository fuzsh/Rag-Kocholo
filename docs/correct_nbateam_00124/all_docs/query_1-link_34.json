        "text": "Mark J. Terrill/Associated Press\n\nLos Angeles Clippers guard Jamal Crawford will once again be honored for his contributions off the bench, as the veteran was voted the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year for the 2015-16 season. The NBA announced the news Tuesday morning, and ESPN.com's Chris Forsberg provided the voting results:\n\nChris Haynes of Cleveland.com and Sam Amick of USA Today were the first to report the news. The 36-year-old was previously named Sixth Man of the Year in 2010 and 2014 as well.\n\nCrawford averaged 14.2 points, 2.3 assists and 1.8 rebounds per game during the regular season, starting just five of the 79 contests he appeared in.\n\nThe sharpshooting Seattle native is the first player in NBA history to be named Sixth Man of the Year three times.\n\nFormer Toronto Raptors and current Los Angeles Lakers guard Lou Williams beat out Crawford for the award last year, but improved efficiency put the former Michigan standout above the fray this season.\n\nHe shot a solid 34 percent from long range and a remarkable 90.4 percent from the free-throw line, making him an important weapon for a Clips team that spent a large portion of the season without superstar forward Blake Griffin.\n\nCrawford has bounced around the league over the course of his 16-year career, enjoying previous stints with the Chicago Bulls, New York Knicks, Golden State Warriors, Atlanta Hawks and Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nHe is a major reason why the Clippers were able to secure the No. 4 seed in the competitive Western Conference, and he'll need to come up big in the playoffs if L.A. is to go on a surprising run to the NBA Finals.\n\nCrawford has the ability to take over games offensively when he gets hot from the field, and that X-factor makes the Clippers a dangerous team and a difficult out in the postseason."
