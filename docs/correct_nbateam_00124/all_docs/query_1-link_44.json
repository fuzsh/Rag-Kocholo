        "text": "May 8, 2014\n\n Wolverines in the NBA\n\nNEW YORK, N.Y. -- Former University of Michigan men's basketball player and current Los Angeles Clipper guard Jamal Crawford (U-M, 1999-2000) was named the 2014 NBA Sixth Man of the Year today (Thursday, May 8), the league announced. It is Crawford's second time earning the distinction, as he also won the award in 2010 as a member of the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nCrawford averaged 18.6 points per contest, his fourth-highest career scoring average, while playing more than 30 minutes a night for LA this season. He shot 41.6 percent from the floor and 36.1 percent from three, contributing better than three assists and two rebounds per night on average.\n\nThe Clippers guard has helped LA to back-to-back pacific division championships in two seasons with the team, the first division titles in franchise history. The No. 3 seed earned by Crawford and his teammates this year marks the highest seeding for a Clippers team since the 1974-75 season, while the 113 wins accumulated during the regular season in Crawford's pair of seasons in LA are a two-year high for the Clippers franchise.\n\nThe Clippers return to STAPLES Center for game three of their series with the Oklahoma City Thunder (tied, 1-1) at 10:30 p.m. EDT on Friday (May 9).\n\nMeanwhile, on Monday (May 5), it was announced that former U-M guard Trey Burke (2011-13) finished third in Rookie of the Year voting, with Tim Hardaway Jr. (U-M, 2010-13) placing fifth. Both received first-place votes behind the winner, Philadelphia 76ers guard Michael Carter-Williams, who took home the award over runner-up Orlando Magic guard Victor Oladipo.\n\n NBA.com Releases: Sixth-Man | Rookie of the Year"
