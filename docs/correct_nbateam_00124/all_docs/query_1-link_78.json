        "text": "The Atlanta Hawks made their first splash of the offseason in a trade with the Utah Jazz. John Collins will now don another uniform for the first time in his career, and while the Hawks only acquired a future second-round pick and Rudy Gay in the deal, the move opened up significant cap space for the team.\n\nThe Hawks goal is rather obvious, but how they plan to accomplish it is much more difficult to imagine. They want to take massive steps towards improving the roster. The same core of players isn’t getting it done. Time has run its course, and reports have suggested that every player not named Trae Young is available for trade.\n\nAtlanta appears to be big game hunting, and they have some valuable pieces that could pique the interest of other teams. But how they land another All-Star caliber talent without giving up all of their depth seems almost impossible. Landry Fields and company have a challenging task ahead of them, especially for two very new front office members.\n\nOn the latest episode of SportsTalkATL, we discuss the current state of the Hawks, and how they can make this team competitive in just one offseason.\n\n—\n\nPhoto: Photographer: Jevone Moore/Icon Sportswire"
