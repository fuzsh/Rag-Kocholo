        "text": "The Atlanta Hawks have decided to part ways with Patty Mills, as reported by The Athletic’s Shams Charania. The veteran guard played sparingly this season, appearing in only 19 games.\n\nAtlanta will now convert Trent Forrest‘s two-way deal to a standard contract to fill the open roster spot.\n\nNBA News: Atlanta Hawks Waive Title-Winning Guard\n\nFormer Hawks Guard Patty Mills\n\nBest known for his nine-year stint with the San Antonio Spurs, Mills was drafted with the 55th pick in the 2009 NBA draft by the Portland Trail Blazers. During the infamous 2011 NBA lockout, Mills spent time with the Melbourne Tigers of the Australian National Basketball League and the Xinjiang Flying Tigers of the Chinese Basketball Association.\n\nHe eventually returned to the NBA in March of 2012, signing with the Spurs. Mills went on to become one of the most successful role players in San Antonio’s history, reaching the NBA Finals twice with the franchise. The first Finals series ended in a loss to the LeBron James-led Miami Heat in 2013. The Spurs prevailed in the rematch a year later, with Mills scoring 17 points in the closeout game.\n\nIn 2021, the Australian set a league record for most three-pointers made as a reserve with a single team. He currently holds the fourth-highest total of three-pointers made among reserves in NBA history, trailing only Kyle Korver, Jamal Crawford, and Lou Williams.\n\nWhat’s Next for Patty Mills\n\nNow 35 years old, Mills’ best days are behind him, yet several NBA teams will register interest in him. The New York Knicks and Phoenix Suns each have an open roster spot, and are in need of back court depth.\n\nIn 2023-24, Mills is averaging 2.7 points on 38.2 percent from three-point range.\n\nHawks Sign Trent Forrest\n\nForrest has had a similar role to Mills this season, averaging 10.5 minutes across 20 games played. The former Florida State Seminole is averaging 2.0 points, 2.1 assists, and 1.3 rebounds.\n\nAfter going undrafted in the 2020 NBA draft, Forrest spent two seasons with the Utah Jazz after signing a two-way deal in 2020.\n\nThe 25 year-old guard had been on a two-way contract with the Hawks since the beginning of last season, and will now sign the first standard contract of his professional career.\n\nWhat’s Next for Atlanta\n\nThe Hawks are currently 10th in the Eastern Conference, holding the last spot for the play-in tournament. Atlanta had the chance to trade one of Trae Young or Dejounte Murray, but they opted to stay the course. They must now remain wary of several threats below them as the race for the playoffs heats up.\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets are four games behind Atlanta in 11th place, while the Toronto Raptors are 4.5 games back in 12th. The Charlotte Hornets are 5-1 in their last six games and sit 13th. With a record of 15-43, they will need a shocking resurgence to threaten Atlanta this late in the year.\n\nAtlanta’s next game is a crucial road matchup tonight against the Nets, with potential seeding implications on the line."
