Customer loved our All Day insoles so much that he‚Äôs having a custom Oxford dress shoe built around the All Days ü§Ø\n\nThese are the type of Move reviews I love reading. We are building the tangible sports med company for youth and recreational athletes with products that are used/co-signed at the highest levels of sports!\n\nMove‚Äôs Game Day series of insoles are already the preferred over the counter insoles across the NBA. Now the word is starting to spread to MLB clubhouses. Shoutout to Reds player Buck Farmer for showing us love on social!\n\nGreat weekend for Dame in Indy. All-Star MVP, 3-Point Champion + the launch/reveal of signature products with Tissot SA, adidas, and Oakley. Glad I was able to have my wife with me to experience it. Cc: Goodwin Sports\n\nAfter a successful November, where we had our best month ever and more than doubled our revenue from last November, we‚Äôve officially launched our Move holiday shop! üõí https://lnkd.in/gSekiJCN The holiday shop is highlighted by our new sneakerhead bundle, featuring Russ Bengtson‚Äôs awesome new book and our new Puff Print tee. A great gift for the sneakerheads in your life! üéÅ As always, shout out to everyone that has been supporting us!\n\nLaunched Move‚Äôs off-court All Day insoles product a year ago. Game changer for folks that love wearing retro and heritage sneakers, but hate the way they make their feet feel. Taking retro comfort from üß± to ‚òÅÔ∏è‚òÅÔ∏è https://move.one\n\nHoliday shopping season is back, and we just launched the first set of our Move 2023 holiday bundles. The perfect time to stock up on all of our insoles and save üíµ! A big part of this bundle offering is our collaboration with Lasso. We have been working on developing our own biomechanic focused performance socks, but in the meantime, we partnered with Lasso to bring you access to their performance compression socks. The perfect companion to our insoles. üõí https://lnkd.in/dY9gzSkd\n\nDamian Lillard recently wrapped up his 2nd annual Formula Zero Elite Camp. The Move team was honored to be able to seed the athletes and coaches at the camp with our Game Day and Game Day pro performance insoles."
