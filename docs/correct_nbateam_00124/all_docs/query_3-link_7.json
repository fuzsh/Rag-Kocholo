        "text": "Jamal Crawford has been a permanent member of the NBA family since the year 2000 when he was drafted 8th overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers, and subsequently traded to the Chicago Bulls where he began his career in earnest.\n\nA lethal ball-handler, and a potent scorer, Crawford would quickly unleash his offensive arsenal against NBA opponents, and stick with it until he retired in 2020.\n\n(He wouldn't officially announce his retirement until 2022, due to the hope of finding his way onto another roster.)\n\nDespite offers from multiple teams to join their front office, it was television that eventually led to Crawford's new path of becoming a stable in the NBA entertainment industry. And that despite the fact that television was never on his mind.\n\n\"I thought I'd be a GM, to be honest with you,\" Crawford tells me on a video call.\n\n\"I thought I'd be in a front office, and I always thought that pretty much my whole career. I always loved putting teams together, and visualizing what it'd be like.\"\n\nThe then 42-year-old began filling in on Inside The NBA, where he quickly found himself enjoying the setting. TNT enjoyed his presence there too, offering him the chance to announce games.\n\nWhen Crawford talks about announcing games alongside Reggie Miller and Kevin Harlan, he speaks in a tone that makes it sound like it's still surreal.\n\n\"I’m up there with Kevin Harlan and Reggie Miller, and to me, they're some of the voices of the game. Like, they're on 2K, and in all the big moments you hear them. They’re like the soundtrack of the game. And now I'm up here with these two legends, who I'm learning from every single day, and having fun.\"\n\nHis admiration for Harlan and Miller doesn't make him shy away from his own ambitions, however.\n\n\"This has been like a dream, and now that I'm in this space, I want to be as at this as I was at basketball,\" he says.\n\nHis transition to the media side, which he called seamless, came on the heels of a dark period.\n\n\"It was seamless after going through a bit of a depression,\" he revealed.\n\n\"I was like 'I know I can still play, I won Teammate Of the Year'. Besides the 51-point game [Crawford scored 51 points off the bench for the Suns on April 9th, 2019 at age 39], I was averaging over 31 in my last month in the league, even at 39 off the bench. So I know I can still play, you can't question my character, so why am I not being signed? And six or seven teams wanted me in their front office, so I couldn’t figure it out.\"\n\nCrawford says he found peace in coaching his son, and eventually got over his frustration when his television career became a recurring thing.\n\nIn 2023, Crawford added narrator to his growing media résumé. He returned to narrate the second season of Chasing History, an NBA production that airs on League Pass via the NBA App.\n\nThe program follows the NBA postseason, both play-in and the actual playoffs.\n\nUnlike his career announcing games, or analyzing basketball alongside Charles Barkley, Shaquille O'Neal, Kenny Smith, and Ernie Johnson, Crawford is narrating on his own, but lauds the help he's received.\n\n\"Every time I do it, I'm smiling,\" he says. \"When I send it off, I say 'Tell me, whatever you want me to do to clean it up, or however you want me to say it, I'll do it ten times, it doesn't matter, because I want you guys to feel good about it, because I'm honored to be able to do it.\"\n\nCrawford smiles widely and jokes that his wife has begun calling him James Earl Jones, after the famed voice-over actor who provided the voice of Darth Vader in the Star Wars franchise.\n\nCrawford, another former player who joined the ranks of becoming an analyst, has avoided the widespread criticism of former players diminishing the efforts of current players by focusing on the game itself.\n\n\"Growing up, the game was always the most important thing to me. And I have to give B.J. Armstrong a lot of credit. Before I even got into the business, he said 'When you get into this business, if you just keep the game the main thing, then just follow the game, and the game will guide you,\" he says in a reflecting manner.\n\nCrawford calls the divide between former and current players a disconnect, and uses his TNT co-host Shaquille O'Neal as an example.\n\n\"Shaq, for example, isn't a hater by any means. But Shaq has a different way of going about challenging somebody, and I've grown to know that by working with him these last couple of years. His way is like 'I may say something in a [certain] way, and it may come out harsh, but I'm really just asking them to step up.\"\n\nHe goes on to give his interpretation of how young players may hear such challenges, and how he has experience with both eras.\n\n\"A younger player may hear it differently. They may say 'Hold on, this guy did it, he played, he knows about the five games in seven nights, he knows the travel, he knows all the things that come with being a pro', and what's interesting about me is that I played for so long that I'm in a sweet spot as far as being able to bridge the gap. I played 20 years. So I played against [John] Stockton and [Karl] Malone, and I also played against Luka [Dončić],\" he notes.\n\nCrawford's positive attitude, and ability to follow the evolution of the game, has laid a pathway for him to further cement his second NBA career off the floor.\n\nAt 44, Crawford finds himself in exactly that sweet spot he referenced where the bridge between his playing career and media career - a transition he agreed was rather seamless - allows him to maintain a level of youthful exuberance while still coming off as an authority figure.\n\nHe, alongside ESPN's JJ Redick, represent a new era of former players who have taken on the media side, after long tenures as NBA players, and have understood what it takes to speak to both younger, and older fans."
