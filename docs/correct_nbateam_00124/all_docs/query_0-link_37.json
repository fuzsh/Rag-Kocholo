        "text": "The free agency pool could be gaining a multiple-time NBA Sixth Man of the Year. After a three-team trade that saw him moved to the Hawks, it appears as though Jamal Crawford will not be sticking around for long.\n\nAccording to USA TODAY Sports’ Sam Amick, the former Clippers’ shooting guard “has no plans” to play for the Hawks after the trade:\n\nCrawford, who played for the Hawks from 2009 to 2011, sent out this cryptic tweet hours before the trade was reported:\n\nThe Hawks will likely try to trade Crawford in exchange for some additional assets. However, due to his situation, it’s most likely that he will be bought out of his contract ($14.8 million this season and only $3 million guaranteed next season).\n\nCrawford could be a hot commodity on the free agent market as a proven scorer off the bench. Despite visible regression, as he has aged, Crawford could still be a valuable component for a contending team.\n\nUPDATE: Crawford is apparently looking at the Lakers as an option if he is bought out, according to Marc Spears of ESPN’s ‘The Undefeated’.\n\nVeteran guard Jamal Crawford’s preference would be to join rookie Lonzo Ball in the backcourt with the Lakers if he can get bought out of his contract, a source told The Undefeated. With his family based in Los Angeles and a solid relationship already in place with Ball, the current Los Angeles Clippers guard would like to sign as a free agent with the Lakers if he were bought out of his contract by the Atlanta Hawks after an expected multi-team trade that is expected to send Danilo Gallinari to the Clippers. The Lakers have strong interest in signing Crawford as well, a source said, and have the money to offer a respectable contract. Crawford could possibly start at shooting guard for the Lakers and be a big help as a mentor and shot maker for the assist creating Ball."
