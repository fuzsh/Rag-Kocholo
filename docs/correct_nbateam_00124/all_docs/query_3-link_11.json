        "text": "Seated in the southwest corner of Royal Brougham Pavilion on the Seattle Pacific University campus, still donning his full uniform, Jamal Crawford is very much in his element.\n\nHe’s resting after another successful Saturday afternoon at his Crawsover Pro-Am. His long legs dangle beneath the training table while he poses with the dozens of fans lined along the hardwood to meet him. After recording a 41-point triple-double, dazzling the crowd with his usual flair, Crawford makes sure to greet every person, posing for selfies and signing collectibles.\n\nThis what Jamal Crawford does: gets buckets, then gives back.\n\nNear the end of the line of is Mount Tahoma wing Lezjuan Harris. Sharing a court with some of the best pro and college basketball players Seattle has to offer, the high schooler was clearly out of place. It showed when Harris’ first shot attempt of the game was aimed at the opposing team’s basket. He missed, but that didn’t deter the crowd from laughing, nor the game announcer from poking fun at the Tacoma kid’s mistake.\n\nBut Crawford saw himself in Harris. He recalled being a teenage baller, playing alongside NBA veteran Doug Christie in an earlier iteration of this same event. Nerve-stricken by the idea of playing against professionals, Crawford scored just eight points total in his first four summer-league games.\n\n“Dang, I’m out here with pros,” he remembered thinking to himself. “What am I gonna do?”\n\nCrawford’s elder teammates kept faith in him, recognizing his potential. They encouraged him to play his game. That encouragement helped Crawford maintain his confidence when Christie suffered an ankle sprain, thrusting the 16-year-old Crawford into an extended role.\n\nHe scored 30 points a game the rest of the summer.\n\n“I remember what that did for me. For me, I was like OK, I think I can make it to the NBA,” Crawford told The Athletic. “That gave me a certain belief and a certain realism to it. I wanted to do the next thing for the next generation.”\n\nCrawford shared his story with Harris, then left the young man with a concise message: Don’t be discouraged. Stay confident. Keep believing. After the conversation, Harris posted his photo with Crawford. The caption had only one word: “Inspiration.”\n\nCrawford’s story is one of local legend. A wiry, 6-foot-5 guard with a mesmerizing handle, an electric scoring ability and prophetic passing skills, he led Rainier Beach High School to a state championship in 1998, then carried his talents to the University of Michigan for one season, then proceeded to become an NBA lottery pick, three-time Sixth Man of the Year and the 2018 Teammate of the Year. At age 38, he’s still a coveted free agent.\n\nKnown throughout his 18-year NBA career for his scoring, Crawford’s legacy in Seattle is defined by his assists in the city’s basketball community.\n\n“Jamal has had a hand in everybody,” longtime Rainier Beach coach Mike Bethea said. “Not just the Rainier Beach kids – I’m talking about from the Zach LaVines to the Brandon Roys. He’s kind of like the godfather of this generation.”\n\nCrawford loves hip hop. A line from B.I.G.’s “Sky’s The Limit” is tattooed on his arm. He’s close friends with Jay-Z. In a way, Crawford embodies the essence of the hip hop genre: a combination of originality and samples from previous generations. The iconic acts of generosity for which is Crawford is revered were inspired by the time he spent under the tutelage of Christie and SuperSonics legends Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp. They developed his game, offered the blueprint for life as a pro athlete and provided the mentorship he has since given to a new generation of players.\n\n“For me, I was just like this meant everything to me,” Crawford said of his relationship with Christie and Payton. “I was a kid with a dream. If someone takes an interest in you that’s at the level you want to be at, I want to do the same thing for the next person.”\n\nIt helps that Crawford is addicted to basketball. His bachelor party in 2014 was a late-night, star-studded pickup game at SPU. It was open to the public. He frequented Renton’s Liberty Park so often throughout his life that, after he funded a remodel, the city named the court after him.\n\nOn the eve of a regular-season game against the Sonics in February 2004, Crawford, then playing for Bulls, needed his fix. He drove with friends to Green Lake Park and played pickup games with strangers for hours into the night.\n\nShowing no signs of fatigue against his hometown team the next night, Crawford drove the lane, lobbed the ball off the backboard and dunked it with two hands, finishing with a game-high 31 points.\n\nAs a teen, Crawford didn’t have Christie’s phone number. But if Christie told him when and where to be for a hoop session, Crawford would get there by any means necessary. “I didn’t care how I got there,” he said. “Whether I was riding dirty with a car with no plates, if I was catching the bus, if I was getting dropped off, I was gonna be at that gym.”\n\nThat tradition continues today, as many of the relationships he’s formed with the younger generation of players were founded in various small gyms across the greater Seattle area.\n\n“I’ve hooped against him in the Pro-Ams these past couple years, I played against him in pick-up at (Rainier) Vista, at UW,” said Abdul Gaddy, who starred at Tacoma’s Bellarmine Prep and the University of Washington. “I’ve hooped with him all the time. Everybody in Washington has somehow hooped against ‘Mal, but that’s what he loves to do. He’ll literally go to the park and play. That dude is special.”\n\nCrawford is notoriously accessible. Rashaad Powell knows this as well as anyone. A longtime friend and former Pro-Am commissioner, Powell is one of the people responsible for reshaping the summer league into what it is today.\n\nNow the dean of students at alma mater Renton High, Powell regularly interacts with children experiencing hardships. He recalls one student in particular whose life changed after an impromptu conversation Powell arranged with Crawford.\n\n“This was in 2014: I was talking to this kid, and the kid was having a rough time in school and life in general,” Powell said. “He was struggling to find a direction in life. He was a kid who aspired to play basketball, so I said, ‘I’m going to have you talk to a friend of mine.’ I didn’t tell him who it was.\n\n“So I called Jamal and said, ‘Jamal, I need you to talk to this kid,’ and he said, ‘No problem, man, call me right now.’ The kid is a huge Jamal fan, and a lot of times they don’t know Jamal is a friend of mine. He talks to the kid, and at the end he says, ‘My name is Jamal.’ And the kid goes, ‘Jamal Crawford!?!’ and freaked out. They finished the conversation and the kid gets off the phone and starts crying, telling me, ‘I can’t believe I just talked to Jamal Crawford.’\n\n“Anyway, the kid ended up graduating later, and he brought me a letter. He asked me to give it to Jamal, and it was about how he inspired him to succeed and to graduate. That was two years later. And that’s just one time. I’ve used him for that before.”\n\nCrawford has a special connection with his alma mater. He’s the namesake of the school gym. He calls Bethea after every game. When Crawford played for the Clippers in 2013, he arranged to fly home and watch the Rainier Beach play Franklin in the state semifinals. The Vikings won, but Crawford had to leave before the championship game the next day. Staying updated as best he could, Crawford phoned Bethea all the way to the airport. Rainier Beach beat Lakeside in overtime to snag the title.\n\nIn addition to his annual Pro-Am, Crawford has a history of competing in alumni-vs-student games at Beach during the summer. His close friend and current Vikings assistant Dave King runs the scoreboard. First team to 100 points wins. Rainier Beach is notorious for producing the state’s premiere basketball talent, so it’s effectively an unofficial Pro-Am. For the high schoolers, it’s the chance of a lifetime to showcase and sharpen their skills.\n\n“Part of the reason we took it very seriously was Jamal and them guys coming back to play against us,” said Mike Ladd (class of ’08). “We had to strap up going against them every day during the summer. We didn’t want to get embarrassed. They made us better defensively because if we could stop Jamal coming down, if we could stop him one time out of the whole day, I knew I was good enough to stop any high schooler in the state.”\n\nIt’s not uncommon for Crawford to attend Rainier Beach practices during NBA All-Star weekend. He’ll work with the current players, play one-on-one, five-on-five; whatever the occasion demands. He may even bring a guest; while playing for Bulls, Crawford walked into the Vikings gym with teammate Ron Artest.\n\n“There’s always respect – and there still is – throughout the region for Jamal, and there always will be,” said Ed Haskins, a longtime Rainier Beach assistant now working at Washington State. “If that dude ran for mayor right now I think he would win – literally; even governor of the state of Washington.”\n\nCrawford altered Reggie Moore’s career path when he convinced the O’Dea High School guard’s mother to let Moore transfer to Rainier Beach. Apprehensive because of potential gang violence, Moore’s mother needed assurance he would not only be safe, but also receive a proper education. Crawford saw potential in Moore, who eventually starred at Beach for two seasons, won a championship as a senior and earned a scholarship to Washington State. That was another assist from Crawford, who guided Moore to Pullman on the strength of his relationships with head coach Ken Bone and assistant Curtis Allen, both Seattle-area natives.\n\nMoore was a three-year starter at WSU before he was dismissed for a violation of team rules. He remains in contact with Crawford, who proudly wears items from Moore’s SkyBlue clothing line. Their bond stems back to Moore’s childhood, when he’d watch Crawford at summer-league games with his grandfather, both in awe of Crawford’s talent.\n\n“Jamal has been like a god to me,” Moore said. “To keep it 100 percent. He don’t even know that shit.\n\n“I got hella memories with my grandpa going to watch people play basketball, and watching Jamal,” Moore, voice cracking, paused before starting to laugh. “That shit was like – it’s like the craziest thing ever and I’ll never forget that stuff. He’s like a god to me at hoop. … He’s like Jimi Hendrix with a guitar, that’s how he is with a basketball. He’s like a GOAT. He’s like my idol, for real.”\n\nCrawford has always had a strong interest in sneakers, particularly the ones he couldn’t afford. His XJ9000s weren’t Air Jordan’s; neither were his Pro Wings or his Pro-Keds, but he acted as if they were. Growing up, people in the neighborhood took a liking to Crawford. Some childhood friends were kind enough to gift him sneakers.\n\nThose gestures motivate Crawford still. At his basketball camps, the price of entry for participants is a new or lightly worn pair of sneakers. The shoes are then donated to children in need. David Hudson, Crawford’s best friend and camp organizer, estimates they donated more than 2,500 pairs of sneakers last year.\n\nBut camps aren’t the only times Crawford is willing to hand out kicks.\n\n“I’ve literally seen him hoop or have some new shoes, and he’ll see a kid come up to him like, ‘I love those shoes,’” Gaddy said. “He’ll be like, ‘You want ‘em? Here, have ‘em.’ He’ll walk off barefoot. We’re talking about an NBA player. He’ll walk barefoot, no shoes on. He’ll just do that. That’s Jamal.”\n\n“He will take the shirt off his back for you,” said Martell Webster, the only Seattle hoop star to take the prep-to-pro route, jumping from Seattle Prep to a 10-year NBA career. Webster, like many, has seen Crawford’s unique generosity up close.\n\n“I think that shirt is dope as hell, Jamal,” he said, mimicking a typical interaction. “‘You like this?’ Literally, he will take it off and give it to you. That’s another level of compassion.”\n\nNeed money for school clothes? Need a place to stay? Need help with your cellphone bill? Crawford has your back. He once loaned a random group of high school kids $20 at the Washington State Fair, just because. He had no idea one of those kids was future NBA guard Avery Bradley of Tacoma.\n\nThe bulk of Crawford’s philanthropy happens off camera, when no one is watching. He seeks no media attention; his only goal is to inspire.\n\nFriends tell of a day in the mid-2000s when Crawford encountered a homeless man in the Capitol Hill neighborhood while waiting for his BMW to be repaired. Crawford insisted on taking the man, who had no idea who Crawford was, shopping to buy food. During their shopping trip, Crawford grew so fond of him that he decided to take the man for a ride when his car was ready. They spent the day cruising the east side of the city before Crawford welcomed the man to his Bellevue condo.\n\nOnly at the end of their hangout did Crawford reveal his true identity.\n\nCrawford remembers being the child soliciting autographs from his favorite celebrities. He also remembers the ones who declined. The feeling of being publicly snubbed hasn’t faded, even when Crawford encountered some of those came celebs later in life.\n\n“So I said if I’m ever in that position I’m never turning down anybody, ever,” Crawford said. “Especially kids. Ever, ever. That moment lasts forever. I’ve never forgotten that. That was 30 years ago.”\n\nThrough this ideology, Crawford has inspired a generation of humble stars.\n\nIn Crawford, Bulls guard Zach LaVine, a former Bothell High standout, found a person with similar laid-back traits; the type of person who wouldn’t mind stopping to take pictures with fans at any moment, even on family getaways.\n\n“You’re just a regular person,” LaVine said. “We’re exceptional at what we do, but at the end we’re all regular people, and we should be treated that way and treat other people like that.”\n\nTre Simmons starred at Garfield High and the University of Washington in the mid-2000s, but his fame reached children born after his Husky days thanks to his participation in the Pro-Am. Whenever he’s approached, Simmons, now playing overseas, always has time for a young fan.\n\n“A lot of kids call me and ask me for advice,” he said. “I think I also got that from him.”\n\n“When your lifestyle becomes something that people follow, then it turns into a brand. He’s never seen his lifestyle as a brand. He saw it as a way of life,” Webster said.“All he’s done is continue to be himself, which is somebody that loves basketball and loves other people to get involved.”\n\nSome of Crawford’s all-time favorite NBA players are Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and Isiah Thomas. His game features elements from all three, along with Penny Hardaway and Allen Iverson.\n\nIn Seattle, Crawford’s handle is spoken of as a deity. He dribbles as if he trusts that, no matter what, the ball will never betray him. As he glides across the court, his palm forms what seems like an unbreakable bond with the rock.\n\nCrawford doesn’t do any dribbling drills; his skills are purely instinctual. His logic: Why dribble around cones and chairs when cones and chairs aren’t 6-foot-6, athletic defenders? As stories circulated that Crawford dribbled everywhere he went, crossing-over random people on the street on his way to school, others emulated the practice.\n\n“Shit, I mean, he set the tone everybody. Literally, everybody who playing basketball in Seattle copied his game,” Moore said. “So, like, his hesitation-pull-up jumper, his hesitation-crossover, every guard in Seattle is known for having that because of Jamal. Nobody had that before.\n\n“Nate (Robinson) had it,” Moore continued. “I do it. (Peyton) Siva, Tone Wroten. Everybody. Isaiah Thomas. It’s all his style we try to emulate. It’s all his style. We got it from him because we all used to sit there and watch him play and tried to be like him.”\n\n“I feel like the right words would be dudes try to play like Jamal,” Gaddy said, laughing. “You can’t play like Jamal because he’s unreal.”\n\nCrawford has several signature crossovers. He’s been doing most of them since high school: fake-behind-the-back-in-and-out; dribbling backwards down the court. Once in high school he wrapped the ball around his body with only his right hand. His between-the-legs, around-the-back move has its own name, according to Simmons: “The 206.”\n\nPlaying guard at 6-foot-5 was virtually unheard before Crawford’s high-school career. Before Crawford, Metro League showdowns didn’t resemble AND1 Mixtape tours. Seattle has long produced prolific scorers, but Crawford ushered in a new area of lengthy, flashy bucket machines.\n\n“He was the one guy that I can say changed Seattle basketball,” Brandon Roy, a Seattle legend and former All-NBA player, said a couple of years ago. A star at Garfield High School – where he’s currently the head coach of the reigning state champs – and Washington, Roy is arguably the most talented player ever to come out of the city. But even his game was altered forever after watching Crawford play high school ball in the late 90s.\n\n“Just the way Jamal was dribbling the ball out there at the top of the key, I’d never seen that. I’d never seen a tall guy do that,” Roy said. “I can honestly say that he made me believe that I could be a guard. I was like,‘Dude, I can be a point guard even though I’m going to be a bigger kid.’\n\n“I remember going to see them play Mercer Island at KeyArena, and he was just so famous the way he walked around the court. I would say he’s the one player over the 20 years I’ve watched high school basketball that totally changed it. Jamal Crawford is the one guy who totally changed the landscape because everybody wants to be him. Even a guy as recently as Dejounte Murray gets compared to him. He’s been that transcendent in Seattle basketball.”\n\nCrawford is regarded as the face of Seattle basketball; the heart and soul of the city’s most talent-rich sport and a role model for those looking to use athletics to serve the community. But his motivation has never been a matter of titles or accolades. He’s invested in people, not publicity.\n\nWhen actor Denzel Washington accepted his Tony Award for Best Actor in 2010, he uttered a phrase that encapsulates Crawford’s approach to philanthropy: “My mother always says, ‘Man gives the award, God gives the reward.’” Crawford values inspiration over attention. Most of his contributions to the community go unseen, but they are far from unnoticed.\n\nSince Crawford’s rise to stardom, Seattle has developed a reputation as a hotbed for hoops talent. Crawford knew the caliber of player coming up after him, so he positioned himself to be a bridge between Seattle legends of the past, present and future. Perhaps more importantly, Crawford hasn’t just demonstrated how to reach a certain level of success; he’s exemplified how to return the favor when you get there.\n\n“It’s pretty simple,” Crawford says, comfortably positioned in the front row of the now empty SPU gym, still in full uniform and draped in a floral towel. “Just treat people the way you want to be treated.”\n\n(Top photo by Doug Pensinger/Getty Images)"
