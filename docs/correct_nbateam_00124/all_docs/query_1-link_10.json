        "text": "But taking that stance could threaten the team’s chemistry and cohesion before the season even gets started. I don’t need to remind you that both of those things unraveled for the Hawks by the end of last season. L.D. already has a lot on his plate before adding a disgruntled sixth man to the list. That’s not to say the Hawks will give in to keep Crawford happy but they obviously have to consider how not doing so could affect chemistry. You can see where both sides are coming from in this. Harder to see is the room for compromise if Crawford sticks with his demands and the Hawks stick with their fiscal plan. The Hawks probably anticipated Crawford would seek an extension after he slid seamlessly into the sixth man role and turned in his best season. What they may not have foreseen was that the request would come with a “or trade me” addendum, which has led to this delicate dance as camp approaches. Things are quiet for the Hawks right now but a storm could be brewing.\n\nCrawford has not publicly demanded a trade, and he won’t, but he has made it clear in talking to the Globe that an extension would be appreciated. Asked if he would be comfortable changing teams, he told the Globe last week, “All I wanted to do growing up is be in the NBA. If I am in the NBA, I am fine. I feel like I have a lot of basketball left. I can play at a high level for a long time. The best is yet to come for me.’’\n\nJamal Crawford’s pending pay-me-or-trade-me request notwithstanding, it looks like Atlanta will send out the same top nine for 2010-11 as they did for 2009-10. So how can the Hawks improve on No. 3 in the East and the second round of the playoffs, particularly with Boston still Boston, Miami shooting past them on paper, Orlando’s so-far unconquerable core still intact, and Chicago and Milwaukee creeping up from behind? “I know that I’m excited personally with what Coach Drew has been talking about,” Horford said. “He wants to change the offense a little bit and do things a little differently. Having said that, it all depends on the kind of level that our key guys like Joe Johnson and Josh Smith [reach] coming in. Mentally, I think that’s going to be a part of how good we are as a team. “I think there is room for growth. There definitely is. We have to work harder if we want to be any better because, man, the East. Milwaukee is better. Chicago is better. Miami is better, it goes without saying. It’s going to be an interesting year for us.”\n\nSund is a Crawford fan, too, and why shouldn’t he be? Jamal made him look smart for swinging that trade, and while it’s not like the Hawks gave up much to get him, it was no sure thing Jamal would work here. It did work–so well, as it turns out, that Crawford had a big year and now is angling for one last big contract. Success is expensive. As for Jamal’s value on the trade market, I’m told at least three teams inquired about his availability before the pay-me-or-trade-me news came out but were rebuffed by the Hawks. I’ve got to think Sund will try to re-establish those talks now and listen to any other offers that come in. I know there’s some sentiment to just deny Jamal the extension and have him report to camp (and he would), but would it be a good look for the Hawks to have an unhappy camper?"
