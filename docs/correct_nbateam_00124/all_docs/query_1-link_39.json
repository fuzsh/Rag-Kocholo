        "text": "ATLANTA — Jamal Crawford scored 29 points, Al Horford added 20 points and 14 rebounds and the Atlanta Hawks beat the Detroit Pistons 91-85 on Saturday night for their 10th straight home victory.\n\nThe Hawks also handed Detroit its 11th straight loss, the Pistons' worst run since dropping 13 in a row Dec. 15-Jan. 11.\n\nJosh Smith finished with 13 points and 14 rebounds to help the Hawks improve to 13-6 overall since Feb. 28.\n\nRodney Stuckey had 22 points for the Pistons, and Tayshaun Prince added 17.\n\nJonas Jerebko's layup at the 3:29 mark of the third gave the Pistons their first lead since Will Bynum's jumper made it 17-16 with 1:51 left in the first.\n\nBut the Hawks never trailed after Zaza Pachulia's tip-in made it 76-74 with 11:13 remaining.\n\nBen Gordon, who signed a five-year, $55 million contract with Detroit last summer, finished 0 for 7 from the field and went scoreless. In his last 33 games, Gordon has scored in single digits 19 times, including three with no points.\n\nMaurice Evans scored 10 points as he started in place of Hawks guard Joe Johnson, who was sidelined by a sprained right thumb. Injuries also caused forced the Pistons' Richard Hamilton, Ben Wallace and Jason Maxiell to miss the game.\n\nDetroit's last field goal came with 2:25 left in the game when Stuckey's layup cut the Hawks' lead to five at 88-83.\n\nCrawford hit a pair of free throws to end the scoring with 22.8 seconds remaining.\n\nNOTES: Hawks coach Mike Woodson listed Johnson as day-to-day, adding that he hopes Atlanta's scoring leader will be ready Tuesday night at Charlotte. ... Detroit's 7-30 road record includes a current 11-game losing streak. ... Atlanta improved to 19-7 when Crawford hits a 3-pointer. He finished 6-for-9 from 3-point range."
