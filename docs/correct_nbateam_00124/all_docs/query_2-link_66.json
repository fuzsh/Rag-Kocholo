The NBA on TNT Tuesday franchise, a two-time Sports Emmy winner for outstanding interactive experience (original programming), returns weekly starting in January.\n\nBeginning later this month, Crawford will be featured regularly on NBA TV Center Court. The weekly franchise – starting Thursday, Oct. 27 – is the network’s marquee night of live programming, incorporating enhanced viewing options, such as unique camera angles, next-gen analytics and social media integrations into the originally produced telecast. He will also appear regularly on NBA TV’s signature studio show, NBA GameTime.\n\nNBA Twitter Live’s coverage of NBA Opening Night on Tuesday, Oct. 18, will be Crawford’s first appearance of the season. Crawford – one of the NBA’s most active voices on Twitter – will also contribute to select games throughout the season.\n\nHost & Commentator Bomani Jones Signs New Contract Extension with ESPN\n\nESPN and host and commentator Bomani Jones have agreed to a new contract extension. Jones will continue to lead his popular ESPN Podcast, The Right Time with Bomani Jones, three times per week.\n\nJones will continue to make regular guest appearances across ESPN Radio’s sports talk programming.

FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™ begins on Sunday, Nov. 20 with a majority of the group stage matches featuring 8:00 AM, 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM ET start times through the FIFA World Cup Final on Sunday, Dec. 18.\n\nFive incredibly unique announce teams comprise FOX Sports’ roster of play-by-play commentators and match analysts calling matches at FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™. The dynamic John Strong and former U.S. Men’s National Team (USMNT) star Stu Holden anchor the lead broadcast booth for FOX Sports. The Strong-Holden pairing has called more than 250 soccer matches together since 2014 – more than any other English-language television duo – and will surpass the 300-match mark in Qatar. Veteran play-by-play announcer JP Dellacamera pairs with former USMNT legend Cobi Jones, while former U.S. Women’s National Team (USWNT) sensation Aly Wagner partners with the distinguished Derek Rae. The Rae-Wagner pairing reunites in Qatar after successfully calling matches together for the men’s tournament in 2018. In a serendipitous assignment, the venerable Ian Darke makes his FOX Sports play-by-play debut alongside USMNT icon Landon Donovan. In 2010, Darke captured the hearts of American soccer fans when he called Donovan’s memorable injury-time goal for the U.S. against Algeria. Former England defender Warren Barton joins the esteemed Jacqui Oatley to round out the announcer pairings. Match assignments will be announced before the tournament begins.\n\nLead studio analyst Alexi Lalas, along with fellow U.S. soccer legends Clint Dempsey, Carli Lloyd and Maurice Edu, headline FOX Sports’ list of former soccer stars providing expert insights at FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™. Two former goal-scoring machines for the England Women’s National Team, Eni Aluko and Kelly Smith, join the studio analyst roster with their perspectives, while former NFL star Chad Johnson makes his FOX Sports debut as a contributing analyst.\n\nRob Stone returns as lead host for FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™ anchoring studio coverage throughout the tournament from the FOX Sports set in Doha, while acclaimed host Kate Abdo is back as lead host of FIFA WORLD CUP TONIGHT. Trusted reporters covering all the FIFA World Cup™ action include Jenny Taft, Rodolfo Landeros and Geoff Shreeves. Tom Rinaldi, 17-time Emmy Award winning storyteller, joins as a reporter and feature correspondent for the first FIFA World Cup™ of his career. Finally, FOX Sports will bring two acclaimed rules analysts to Qatar in former referees Dr. Joe Machnik and Mark Clattenburg."
