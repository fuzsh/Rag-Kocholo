        "text": "Shooting guard Jamal Crawford is a 19-year NBA veteran and three-time Sixth Man of the Year. He’s played for eight teams, logging his longest stints with the Clippers, Knicks and Bulls. He finished the 2018-19 season with the Suns, scoring 51 points off the bench in the final game that year—and possibly his career.\n\nCrawford, who turned 40 in March, did not retire but was surprised not to have received interest from any team prior to the current season. He is one of only three NBA players in history (along with Dell Curry and Lou Williams) to score more than 10,000 points as a substitute; he also ranks eighth all-time in made 3-pointers.\n\nSPORTTECHIE DAILY: Get the Latest Industry Updates in Our Morning Newsletter\n\nAn avowed gym rat, Crawford is famous for his year-round participation in pick-up games. Though he has a famously slick handle—his Twitter handle is @JCrossover—he has said he never did ball-handling drills and didn’t practice his shot much until 2012. A Seattle native, he is still living there with his family. A February trip with his 10-year-old son and nephew to a Shoot 360 gym in nearby Kirkland prompted him to become an investor in the company. Fellow NBA veterans Fred Jones and Rodney Stuckey already own and operate their own Shoot 360 gyms, which use shot-tracking technology and interactive video interfaces to engage fans in ball-handling and passing drills.\n\nOn working out with Michael Jordan . . .\n\nHis trainer who I knew, Tim Grover, was working out with him at 6 in the morning. He called me and said, ‘MJ said to come meet him.’ And there was a rumor—my dad had told me at the time—that MJ loves your game. I’m like, ‘Dad, come on.’ You don't know Michael Jordan. How would you know he liked my game?’ Fast forward, I get a chance to meet him. And when he told me he liked my game, I was like, ‘Wow, my dad was right.’ This is before social media. Jordan said, ‘We'll start training together in the summer.’ It was actually in the season when he told me that.\n\nThen we started training together. You know, he really took a liking to me. He really started looking out for me. I started going to his house and training with him. He actually picked me to be in a commercial to play the younger version of him—some really cool moments came out of that. This is the greatest player ever. This is my favorite player. And he's really taken an interest in me.\n\nOne day I came late to the gym. When you’re a younger player, you have to work out with your franchise first, and then you can go wherever you want to go play. So I had to work out with the Bulls and then I would drive downtown to his gym. One day, they called me and were like, ‘You're late. MJ is waiting on you.’ ‘Waiting on me? What do you mean, waiting on me?’ That's when I found out that we were going to start being on the same team. From that moment on, I made sure to get there on time.\n\nSo then we started playing together, pick-up games, and we never lost. We literally played the whole summer, and we never lost one single game. It wasn't like, OK, we won five and they won four, so we won the day. No, we never lost a single match within a day—ever. We went the whole summer without losing. It was unbelievable. We were playing against Penny Hardaway, Tim Hardaway, Antoine Walker, Mike Finley, Ray Allen. Whoever you could think of, we were playing against at that time.\n\nOn the hot hand and hitting 16 straight shots in a 52-point performance as a Knick in 2007 . . .\n\nActually, it was funny: I missed my first four shots that game, and one of them was a dunk! I was like, ‘Oh my, this is not my night.’ And I hit one, then another one and just kept going. I went from the end of the first quarter into the third quarter without a miss, so I scored 42 straight points. It was 16 straight field goals, and eight of the 16 were 3-pointers. I remember Walt Clyde Frazier, the legend, coming up to me after the game and saying, ‘I've never even hit eight straight shots in a game. You hit eight straight threes!’ I was blown away by that, which is really cool. But yeah, it was a night I'll never forget. I just got unconscious.\n\nIt’s like you can kick it up there. I really felt like I can take this ball and kick it like I’m kicking a punt, and it will go in. You just feel so hot. You don't even care where you're at. You don't care who's around you. You feel like, if you can see the rim, it's going in. It doesn't matter if your feet are facing one direction or your body's not square. You’re just on a whole other level of a rhythm. But I've always said this even after a 50-point game, it's never just the guy who’s scoring in the basket. It's the guy drawing up the plays, which is the coach.\n\nIt’s guys setting screens. It’s guys getting you the ball. All you guys are experiencing that at once. The players are like, ‘He’s hot, get him the ball.’ The fans are like, ‘He’s hot, get him the ball.’ Yeah, the guy who makes the shots gets the credit, but it’s something everybody can experience and be a part of, so it's really cool.\n\nOn training by playing . . .\n\nFor example, if a player comes back from injury, they’re doing drills, they're shooting, they're running now. They're healthy. They’re going through the one-on-one stuff and are sharpening their skills. And then when they play five-on-five, they sometimes feel like a fish out of water. It’s like, man, the speed of the game was different. Now you have guys banging against you. You have these 6’ 6” athletic wings guarding you.\n\nFor me, the way I thought about it was, OK, instead of it being that cone or that chair, I would rather train in a game. I'm working on different things while I’m playing against live bodies. So I can see how they react to it. I can see what move works, what move doesn't work. It always helped me keep a flow and a rhythm. Whether it be the summer or the NBA, I played the exact same style. I kind of mastered that style. The style obviously isn't for everybody.\n\nBut on the other hand, cones and those things are needed. With my son, actually, we were doing cones today. I think both are needed: sharpening your individual skill and then taking that skill to play against live people to see what works and what doesn’t.\n\nOn his first impressions of Shoot 360 . . .\n\nI was introduced to it five years ago, by Fred Jones, who was already in with them. He actually had a facility in Indiana. And I was on a road trip with the Clippers at the time. I think we were on like our seventh game in like 12 days—it was towards the end of the trip. And I was really tired. I remember he was like, ‘Hey, just come check it out. It's a 30-minute ride.’ I said, ‘Maybe,’ but I never went and saw it. But obviously he sent me footage and things like that.\n\nRodney Stuckey brought one to Kirkland, Wash., and I was able to actually go. My son and my nephew were like, ‘Hey, let's go check it out.’ I didn't even tell Stuckey I was coming—I kind of surprised him. And when I got there, as soon as I walked in, I was blown away. I had no doubts, right when I walked in. Instantly, I’m like, ‘This is totally different than any gym I've ever been in.’ I've been in gyms all my life, right? Just seeing the kids and how they were working, the technology they were working with—you know now kids love playing video games, well, it was almost like they were playing video games while they were training and getting better. So it was like twofold, right?\n\nOn training young players . . .\n\nSo they're trying to hit bugs on the screen with passes. They’re ball handling. And they’re not knowing that they're getting hidden shooters in the perfect shooting pocket. You know, because they're trying to hit the bug, but they're getting better while they're doing that. I just saw the joy the kids had, and it was refreshing to see that and not a trainer beating them down and saying, ‘Do this or do that.’ It was very interactive for them. Trainers walked by and checked on them, but it was more so they were doing what the screen was telling them to do. Everything was self-sufficient. It was just genius to me. I was like, ‘I want to be a part of this.’\n\nYou don't ever feel out of place, from the beginner level all the way to the pro level. You're enjoying getting better and enjoying the process of it. When we left there, it was funny, my son and my nephew were like, ‘If this was close to our house, we would work out twice a day.’Just to see the kids and the joy they had experiencing it, it was just unbelievable.\n\nI had never done a ball-handling drill. I had never used the cones or anything. If I was in Shoot 360 as a kid, I'd be in there every single day—like, literally. It was just so much fun, like a basketball haven. It was exciting because I was looking around at the other parents—some of them I knew, some of them I didn’t—and they're just enjoying watching their kids get better.\n\nThe technology was so far advanced. For example, you could go to one of the shooting cages and do a workout and they'll tell you like, ‘Crossover, step back, hesitation pull-up.’ You do it and they draw it for you exactly. My nephew and my son competed while they were doing it, and if you're a member, say you're in Seattle, you can compete with somebody in New York if they're a member as well.\n\nMy son has worked with different trainers. I see so many kids at times, when they work with different people—and not to say every trainer is like that, but some kids I’ve seen their confidence get beat up and they get discouraged at times because they may not be as far along as some of their peers. But the whole Shoot 360 concept is to grow at your own pace, improve at your own pace. I think that's the beauty and the joy of it because it's not discouraging, it's just encouraging.\n\nOn the skills needed in the modern NBA . . .\n\nEven more so now, there's emphasis on ball-handling and shooting. When I first came to the league, you had Shaq, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett—guys you kind of just threw the ball to on the post and said, ‘OK, give me a basket.’ Well, now, it’s shifted toward guards. If you can create your own shot and get 3-pointers up—and they’re thinking now, the three is worth more than two, so they're trying to get as many three-pointers as possible up.\n\nI think Shoot 360 goes right along with analytics. You're getting reports and you're getting reviews right there on the spot on how you can get better: get your arc up a little bit better, you’re aiming left or right, your depth needs work. You're getting all this feedback right there on the spot, so you have no choice but to get better. I think the ball-handling and the shooting plays along with the way the NBA game is going. You look at a guy like Steph Curry or Trae Young or Kevin Durant or James Harden and all these guys that use their ball handling and shooting to separate themselves.\n\nOn keeping in shape in case an NBA team calls . . .\n\nAbsolutely. Part of it is to get back, and part of it is just who I am. I play basketball every single day of my life and work out, so if the NBA doesn’t happen this season, I'll still be in shape because I just love the game. I don't do it for that. I've always done it for me."
