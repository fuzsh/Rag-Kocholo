        "text": "ATLANTA -- Jamal Crawford says every game in his first season in Atlanta felt like a rock concert.\n\nNow the winner of the NBA's Sixth Man Award last season is hoping for more than one encore with the Hawks.\n\nCrawford will be an unrestricted free agent after the season, and he says he wants to remain in Atlanta past this year.\n\nHis future with the team is in doubt, however. The Hawks re-signed Joe Johnson to a six-year deal worth more than $123 million in the offseason, and they made Jordan Crawford the team's first-round draft pick.\n\nJamal Crawford, Johnson and Jordan Crawford are all shooting guards. Jamal Crawford says he understands the business side of the game, as the depth at the position may make it difficult for the team to re-sign the 10-year veteran."
