        "text": "Victor Wembanyama will be the only NBA player to have a chance at viewing basketball's coveted Jamal Crawford hidden crossover files should he ever perform Crawford's signature move during a game.\n\nThroughout the NBA season, Crawford has consistently praised Wembanyama, emphasizing that his impact on the court extends far beyond scoring. During a recent NBA TNT Tip-Off segment, Crawford tested Wembanyama's skills, inquiring if the rookie could replicate his signature move, the double behind-the-back shake and bake.\n\nWith relentless confidence, Wembanyama promptly accepted the challenge, citing his previous training under the tutelage of his coach in France, who had also taught him the famed ShamGod move. Crawford, impressed by the rookie's response, upped the ante by promising Wembanyama access to an exclusive version of his coveted basketball moves should he successfully execute the move during a game.\n\nRenowned for his legendary ball-handling, Crawford has built a legendary status around his repertoire of crossovers, including ten elusive moves he's never executed in an NBA game. This mystique and his reputation as a seasoned player boasting three Sixth Man of the Year awards across a 20-year career has intrigued fans to see the footage.\n\nREAD MORE: Ranking NBA playoff series as LeBron James and Los Angeles Lakers aim to dethrone Denver Nuggets\n\nREAD MORE: 2024 NBA Playoff roster rules explained rigid policies outlined\n\nExclusive access to Crawford's secret stash of ten unreleased moves is a privilege reserved solely for Wembanyama, as Crawford told Mirror Sports US. Crawford emphasized that while there's many elite basketball players roaming the Earth, the unique opportunity is extended solely to the standout Spurs rookie, who he likened to a character straight out of a video game.\n\n\"No, I think Wemby was just a special case because of his hype and size,\" said Crawford. \"As we see Wemby nowâ€¦ seeing what he's doing and how he's doing it, I say Wemby's the \"Create-a-player\" that creative players would create.\"\" And what I mean by that is we say Durant and LeBron; these guys are 'created players,\"' he continued.\n\n\"If they were playing 2K and they were to print their own player, it would look like 'I want to be 7-foot-4, shooting step back threes, and run, the court like a gazelle.' So, he's that guy. So that challenge is for him and him only.\"\n\nClick here to follow the Mirror US on Google News to stay up to date with all the latest news, sport and entertainment stories.\n\nIf Crawford's eager to catch Wembanyama's elusive move, he'll have to bide his time until the 2024 Paris Olympics or the next NBA season. San Antonio wrapped up their regular season with a modest 22-60 record, missing out on this year's NBA Playoffs, a trend continued since the 2019-20 season.\n\nDuring his rookie season with the Spurs, Wembanyama lived up to the expectations of NBA fans online as a once-in-a-generation talent. Standing at 7-foot-4, the French prodigy made NBA history by scoring over 1,500 points, blocking over 250 shots, and making over 100 three-pointers in a single season - a feat that no other player has ever achieved.\n\nWembanyama rewrote NBA record books and led the league in blocks per game with an average of 3.6. The NBA will reveal the three finalists for the Kia NBA Rookie of the Year on Sunday, April 21."
