Reliever Jorge Lopez got tossed from the game, threw his glove into the stands, and then told Steve Gelbs he's on the worst team in MLB. Boomer feels bad for Manager Carlos Mendoza, but Gio said it has to be partly his fault. Gio doesn't feel bad for the manager, he feels bad for the people who sell Mets tickets for a living. Boomer said that Mendoza needed to put his foot down but doesn't have the experience that a Brian Daboll does. Gio said Mendoza is another in a long line of guys that looks great until they get to the Mets. When you come to the Mets, ‘you become an idiot'. In addition to that fun, Edwin Diaz went on the IL and Pete Alonso got drilled in the hand with a pitch. Jerry is here for his first update of the day and has all the audio of the Mets implosion. First up, the Ohtani HR. The SNY booth describes what's happening with Jorge Lopez. Carlos Mendoza reacts. Lopez said he didn't regret it because he's on the worst team in MLB. Edwin Diaz talked about his shoulder tightness. The Yankees beat the Angels as Luis Gil pitched 8 innings of 2 hit ball. In the final segment of the hour, Boomer is having problems with his earpiece Hour 2 The Mets hit the pinnacle of disaster with yesterday's performance against the Dodgers everything that was said after the game. At least we know where the Mets stand between now and the trade deadline, which is now 8 weeks away. Mets fans have to be desensitized to all of this now after all of these years. If you believe in David Stearns, he is now going to be in full control of blowing this up. This is probably going to be the best thing for Stearns. Jerry returns for an update and has audio from 2 years ago where Boomer & Gio are excited about Steve Cohen and the Mets. We heard from Howie Rose as the Mets lost to the Dodgers. After the game, reliever Jorge Lopez said he did not regret his actions because he's on the worst team in MLB. Francisco Lindor called a team meeting after the game. The Yankees beat the Angels as Alex Verdugo hit a HR. There was also an infield fly/interference double play on the Yankees which Aaron Boone called ‘wonky'. He was tossed for arguing. Jerry has audio of Sal telling a caller to ‘kiss my ass'. In the final segment of the hour, we talked about LPGA golfer Charley Hull and how she was photographed smoking a cigarette. Boomer invited Al to tonight's Rangers game but that is completely out of Al's comfort zone. Hour 3 Boomer really wants to take Al to the Rangers game tonight but he has no interest in going. Boomer expects tonight's game to be super intense. We took a lot of calls from Rangers fans that wanted to change up the lines and the power play. Jerry returns for an update and starts with the disaster that is the Mets. We heard from Howie Rose as reliever Jorge Lopez tossed his glove into the stands. Boomer found out that Lopez's son is waiting for an organ transplant so he understands what he might be going through. Luis Gil threw 8 innings of 1-run ball as the Yankees beat the Angels. Quinnen Williams just found out that this is Aaron Rodgers' 20th season in the NFL. UFC fighter Sean Strickland went all in on Tom Brady for the way he behaved at the roast. In the final segment of the hour, Boomer got a tumbler with a bluetooth speaker in it. A caller coming up for Darryl Strawberry's jersey retirement went through a litany of Mets disasters over the years. Hour 4 Boomer said Matthew Tkachuk called out Chris Kreider and now he needs to respond tonight. Gio said the first goal scored tonight will be huge to set the tone. We also talked about the Mets and Gio said David Stearns is going to give this team a colon cleanse. Everyone will be gone. Jerry returns for his final update of the day and starts with the disastrous day the Mets had yesterday and the Yankees win in L.A. over the Angels. Jamal Crawford compared Inside the NBA to the Golden Girls. The Moment of The Day involves Al complaining about Rangers talk and 7-game series. In the final segment of the show, a man in Michigan Zoomed into his court hearing for a suspended license. The problem is, he was driving while Zooming and he doesn't have a license. Boomer is doing a cleanse right now so he can't even enjoy any good food and drink for tonight's Rangers game. Boomer said Kreider will very much be in the mix tonight.\n\nIn one of our favorite conversations on The Pivot, Ryan, Channing and Fred talk with NBA legend Jamal Crawford on everything from his basketball journey to Michael Jordan bond to fatherhood to life after the game and importance of legacy. Whether it is starting roles or years of advice, he's given back a lot to the game he loves, and on this episode we get a rare glimpse of how one person can have so much love and gratitude for a sport. When people bring up the greatest ball handlers basketball has ever seen, there is a shortlist of guys who make that group, with most of the players being shorter point guards who have made a living off of facilitating NBA games and dominating other small defenders. At 6'5”, Jamal cemented himself as one of the best isolation players from the shooting guard position and adapted a “whatever it takes” mentality to win which led to Jamal being named the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year three times and the 2018 NBA Teammate of the Year which meant the most to him because it was always about who he is over what he is that matters. As a young man growing up in LA and Seattle, Jamal shares how a random but timely interaction with Paul Pierce pushed him to be in school and approach his grades with as much love and detail as he did basketball, and once he started, the opportunities started flowing. His natural ball handling skills and unique approach to the sport paved a path not many can walk professional sports, but Jamal did it was class and respect, being clear that playing basketball was never about changing his circumstances, rather it was always about his pure love for the sport and the magic feeling that took over his body every time he touched a ball. It was after getting drafted where Jamal's ability and basketball career truly took off and how meeting one man, forever changed his life. Sharing never-told-before stories to The Pivot, Jamal opens up how Michael Jordan took him under his wing and explains how their close knit bond on and off the court was formed. MJ deemed Jamal his go-to partner in summer ball and the duo never lost while attracting stars and celebs to their pick up games. By developing this life-long bond with the GOAT, Jamal understands how that bond changed his life on every level by just knowing he had the “Greatest Ever” in his corner, helped his career skyrocket and he even shares some off-the-court stories between the two from gambling to parties to hard lessons. After listening to Jamal talk his basketball journey, how he approached the game, his love for the sport and ability to easily talk any aspect and break down players and plays, Ryan called him a “Basketball Nerd”, a compliment to how much he truly loves the game. Before closing out the conversation, Jamal talks fatherhood, what it's like coaching his son and the lessons learned through this experience. The current on-air analyst gives his take on the current NBA playoff picture, his comparison of Kyrie and Jokic and how Wembley is the emerging face of the game for years to come. Crawford has always been an analyzer, hyper-aware of all that is going on around him, and his breakdown of any situation proves just that. He may not have an All-Star appearance to his name, but he tells the guys that's part of his story of what he gave back to a game that gave him so much. Learn more about your ad choices.

He's not young and not gonna stick around, but he holds this team together, and when he leaves he might have Clinkscale ready to take over, which he isn't now. Matters if he's going to take one or two jobs (IE bring his guy) on staff because they need some recruiting juice if he's going to be a Mike Macdonald-level recruiter. Lee Aaliya: This should be the last straw for the NCAA. NCAA strung him along for five then came up with ridiculous demands: wanted an 18-year-old to have all of his grocery receipts and pay $15,000 (was it $1500?). Jamal Crawford, Mitch McGary: The NCAA is preventing kids who want to come to Michigan FOR THE EDUCATION from coming here, and it's hard at this point not to believe it's out of hatred for Michigan. Michigan should have signed him and dared the NCAA to come after them. NCAA vs Everybody: Dartmouth ruling will either stick if Dems retain White House, or get overturned by federal NLRB if Reps do, because of the party differences on unions (Craig: and grift!). Expect to see some legislation in the near future in Southern states that protect the donors who were paying kids under the table for all these years, because they have some big tax liabilities."
