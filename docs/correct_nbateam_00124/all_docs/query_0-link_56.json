        "text": "Jamal Crawford, who is arguably the greatest sixth man in league history, is officially retiring from basketball.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1505909403261849604?s=20&t=syHthL16pe6C4EW8yucmnQ\n\nCrawford played two seasons in Atlanta from 2009 to 2011, where he averaged 16.1 points on 43.7% shooting from the field and 36.3% from beyond the arc, earning Sixth Man of the Year honors for the 2009-2010 season. The Hawks have boasted two of the greatest bench scorers the Association has ever seen in Crawford and Lou Williams. The latter is still on the team and giving teams fits off the bench; however, the former is calling it quits. A hoops legend and one of my personal favorites is done with the NBA.\n\nâ€”\n\nPhotographer: Erik Lesser/Zuma Press/Icon Sportswire"
