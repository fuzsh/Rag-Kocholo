        "text": "With the 2016 NBA Draft set to get underway on Thursday, it?s time to have some drafting fun.\n\n[ MORE: Big Ten players in NBA Mock Drafts ]\n\nSeveral former Big Ten stars are expected to hear their name called in the upcoming draft, which got me thinking about this year?s Big Ten class, and how they fare compared to past Big Ten draft picks.\n\nImagine if every former Big Ten player in the NBA today was filtered into a one-round NBA Draft, which included this year's draft prospects. What would it look like?\n\nI?m going to answer that for you. In order to do so, I?m going to use this year?s NBA Draft order. So, the Philadelphia 76ers will pick first, while the Golden State Warriors will pick 30th.\n\nThis list doesn?t necessarily reflect the order of the top Big Ten players in the NBA today, because you have to take age, injuries and numerous other factors into account. Think of it as if you were drafting a team to start your own NBA franchise right now.\n\nWith that said, here?s a look at what a one-round draft of former Big Ten players in the NBA today would look like.
