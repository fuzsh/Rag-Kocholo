        "text": "When the Oklahoma City Thunder played the Miami Heat in the 2012 NBA Finals, I was actively rooting for Miami. It had nothing to do with the Heat. It had everything to do with how much it stung to watch my hometown team, the Seattle SuperSonics, in the NBA Finals representing a different city.\n\nSince then, I’ve developed a strong friendship with Kevin Durant, so now I root for him to succeed — unless he’s playing my Los Angeles Clippers, of course. But back then, the pain of losing the Sonics was still fresh, and I couldn’t help but feel deep dislike for the entire Thunder franchise. I can tell you that most Seattle fans still feel that way.\n\nI had already been in the NBA for many years when the Sonics left town, but that didn’t make the team’s departure hurt any less. Like so many others, I fell in love with the team at a young age, seeing posters and billboards of guys like Gus Williams (“The Wizard”), Downtown Freddie Brown, and Jack Sikma.\n\nLater, when my big sister got a job working at KeyArena, I got the opportunity to see NBA players in person for the first time in my life. I was nine years old, and I couldn’t believe how big, fast and skilled those guys were. I knew right then and there what I wanted to do with my life, but over time, the SuperSonics came to represent more than just a dream; playing for the team became a goal.\n\nMost people don’t know this, but I was nearly selected by Seattle in the 2000 NBA Draft. The team held the 17th overall pick, but as my draft stock ascended into the top 10, I was told the front office was prepared to trade up to get me. Me … in the same uniform as Dana Barros and Shawn Kemp and Gary Payton. People in the organization had known me for years, especially as a player for Rainier Beach High School. I even played at the team’s facility sometimes.\n\nI wasn’t meant to be. I ended up getting selected eighth overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers, only to be dealt immediately in a draft-night trade to the Chicago Bulls. The Sonics ultimately went with Desmond Mason at No. 17.\n\nEven though I didn’t get picked by Seattle, it always was an event when I would return home to face the Sonics. Typically, I’d have at least 100 people at the game — family and friends — and the atmosphere in KeyArena would never disappoint. It was only a once-a-year game back then since I was in the Eastern Conference with the Chicago Bulls and later, the New York Knicks, but it was always a highlight of my season.\n\nI miss those games.\n\nI was playing for the Knicks in 2008 when Seattle’s relocation to Oklahoma City was made official. I remember being in total disbelief. Sure, there had been rumors that ownership might sell the team if it didn’t get a new arena, but I never thought it would actually happen. The fans in Seattle are too passionate, too loyal — and the team had just been to the NBA Finals in 1996.\n\nIt dawned on me immediately that I had already played my last professional game in the city of Seattle. It was an emotional moment, but mostly because it also sunk in that I’d never get a chance to actually suit up in a Sonics jersey. I just kind of took it for granted that my playing for the franchise was meant to be. At that point in my career, I had never even experienced free agency. There’s no doubt in my mind that I would’ve signed with Seattle had the team not relocated, but once again, it wasn’t meant to be.\n\nFast forward to now.\n\nSeattle and the surrounding areas have continued to make their mark on the NBA. In recent years, I’ve been joined in the league by local boys like Brandon Roy, Isaiah Thomas, Nate Robinson, Avery Bradley, Zach LaVine, Spencer Hawes, Tony Wroten Jr., and Marvin Williams.\n\nOnly, growing talented players isn’t what makes Seattle different. Many cities are known for producing great basketball players. The difference is that many cities — like New York and Chicago — have great developmental programs, but their players are rarely united.\n\nPlayers from Seattle are there for one another. If one of us has a charity function or event, it’s understood that all of us will be there to support their efforts. The SuperSonics may be gone, but what’s left is a connection — a communal feeling that we represent something together, both on the court in our respective NBA cities, and in the communities we serve.\n\nI consider Brandon a brother. Isaiah stayed at my house for a period of time in high school. I took Spencer to Rucker Park for the first time in his life. Those are the kind of things that Doug Christie and Gary Payton did for me when I was younger, and I definitely wanted to play a similar role in these young players’ lives. Now that there aren’t Sonic players to guide the young guys, we have to do that for each other.\n\nIf you talk to any of the guys I’ve mentioned, they all feel the same way. I especially feel for the younger players from Seattle because they never had a chance to play in KeyArena. They never had a chance to experience the homecoming game that I did. They never got to play in that atmosphere, and that’s not fair.\n\nThankfully, I’m not the type of guy who shies away from a challenge. In fact, I am so passionate about Seattle basketball that I put on a Pro-Am every summer to give local players as close to the real thing as possible.\n\nBefore, kids in Seattle could only watch NBA players on TV or in video games. Now, every year I ask the kids who they want to see, and then I try to bring that player. All of the Washington-area players play in the Pro-Am, but I’ve also had stars like Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, Chris Paul, John Wall, Kyrie Irving, LaMarcus Aldridge, James Harden, DeMar DeRozan, and Tyreke Evans play in Seattle. The passionate fans deserve it, and I am honored to be able to play a small part in bringing them an experience that was unfairly stripped from them.\n\nWhenever I go back home, people stop me on the street to talk about this issue. They tweet at me and yell things during the Pro-Am about getting a team back in Seattle. Even some NBA players have told me that they want Seattle to have a team again. Blake isn’t from Seattle, and had never played an NBA game there, but after his first time at the Pro-Am, he told me, “Wow, I love it here.”\n\nAnd he isn’t alone.\n\nSeattle already is known for bringing tremendous support for its sports teams — just look at the Seahawks. Those fans make life miserable for visiting NFL teams; they don’t call them the 12th Man for nothing. The Mariners have a great fan base, too.\n\nI just wish the powers that be in the NBA would start paying attention to Seattle fans’ extreme passion. We all know that money plays a big factor when it comes to stuff like this, but sometimes, it’s about doing the right thing. Seattle fans were — and many remain — furious that their beloved Sonics were taken away from them, but time heals most wounds, and all will be forgiven if and when a “new” NBA franchise comes to town."
