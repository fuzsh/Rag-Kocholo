        "text": "Jamal Crawford has been the talk of every ‘social media GM’ this summer, yet the NBA free agent has yet signed with an NBA team.\n\nLast week, Ben Simmons said he wanted Jamal Crawford to become a member of the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\n“He needs to come through,” the NBA’s Rookie of the Year told me.https://platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?dnt=false&embedId=twitter-widget-1&features=eyJ0ZndfZXhwZXJpbWVudHNfY29va2llX2V4cGlyYXRpb24iOnsiYnVja2V0IjoxMjA5NjAwLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfSwidGZ3X2hvcml6b25fdHdlZXRfZW1iZWRfOTU1NSI6eyJidWNrZXQiOiJodGUiLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfX0%3D&frame=false&hideCard=false&hideThread=false&id=1034955998358843393&lang=en&origin=http%3A%2F%2Fscoopb.com%2Fkemba-walker-jamal-crawford%2F&sessionId=8806c05b8b30cb7f45bbe137a58558285d92bad9&theme=light&widgetsVersion=82e1070%3A1619632193066&width=550px\n\nA three time recipient of the NBA’s Sixth Man of The Year Award, Crawford wants to play for the Philadelphia Sixers. “I like their city,” Crawford told me last month on the Scoop B Radio Podcast.\n\n“I would be honored to play there, but things obviously have to take its course and I kind of got to sit back, but who wouldn’t want to play there?”\n\nAccording to The Ringer, Jamal Crawford is ranked third in the top six remaining free agents.\n\nWhile Simmons may want Crawford to be a Sixer, J-Cross has an ally from another Eastern Conference guard: Kemba Walker.\n\n“I have no idea why he’s a free agent, man,” the Charlotte Hornets point guard told me.\n\n“Everybody loves J.C. He’s a great dude first of all and basketball-wise, I mean, everybody knows what he does.”\n\nBrandon ‘Scoop B’ Robinson discusses Jamal Crawford & the Sixers on ESPN Radio.https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sf1OnGK80Qk\n\nCrawford, 38, opted out of the second year of his two-year contract with the Minnesota Timberwolves, that he signed last summer. He cited playing time as a huge issue in his decision. “First off, minutes, that was definitely an issue,” Crawford told me on Scoop B Radio. “It really was, because I didn’t know it would be like that. At this stage, you want to be out there as much as possible. I understand in certain situations you won’t play as much, but I was expecting one thing and it just didn’t go that way, so I think that’s when it started.”\n\nLeague sources have expressed to me all summer that the Sixers are the frontrunner in signing Crawford. Additionally, they state that in order to make Jamal Crawford’s roster spot work in Philly, Jerryd Bayless would have to be bought out of his contract or traded.https://platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?dnt=false&embedId=twitter-widget-2&features=eyJ0ZndfZXhwZXJpbWVudHNfY29va2llX2V4cGlyYXRpb24iOnsiYnVja2V0IjoxMjA5NjAwLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfSwidGZ3X2hvcml6b25fdHdlZXRfZW1iZWRfOTU1NSI6eyJidWNrZXQiOiJodGUiLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfX0%3D&frame=false&hideCard=false&hideThread=false&id=1035576679421435904&lang=en&origin=http%3A%2F%2Fscoopb.com%2Fkemba-walker-jamal-crawford%2F&sessionId=8806c05b8b30cb7f45bbe137a58558285d92bad9&theme=light&widgetsVersion=82e1070%3A1619632193066&width=550px\n\n“He’ll bring it every night,” Walker said of Crawford.\n\n“He could score with the best of ‘em and I have no idea why he’s a free agent.”"
