        "text": "It turns out the Suns do need him. Before the season, they had ambitions of competing for the playoffs. Instead, they entered Monday night 6-24, last in the NBA.\n\nCrawford is uniquely qualified for this role as team sage. Now on his eighth team in 19 years in the NBA, Crawford has played for every type of outfit, from lottery dwellers to pseudo contenders.\n\n\"This isn't the end-all, be-all,\" Crawford said when asked what he tells younger Suns players as they grind through a dismal season.\n\n\"Just work every day. Take it day by day, get better. But there's a bigger picture to this. As long as you can worry about the stuff you can control, that's always best for you.\"\n\nCrawford has been a breath of fresh air in the locker room, as other players would tell it. No. 1 overall pick Deandre Ayton told The Athletic's Gina Mizzel on Monday that he continually tells Crawford that it's an \"honor\" to be around him.\n\nThe NBA world jokes about Crawford's agelessness, particularly in his looks.\n\nBut behind Crawford's longevity has been hard work and help from others, including some dietary changes made by his wife.\n\n\"I switched Capri Suns for water,\" Crawford said. \"My wife made me, actually. She started changing my diet before I noticed she was changing it, to be honest with you. Like, I started eating more whole foods, better stuff. At first, it was like once a week. Then it was like four times a week.\"\n\nBut Crawford also said he made sacrifices to hang around the NBA.\n\n\"Staying in love. I think if you're in love, you're willing to do anything that comes with it. Whether that be foam roller or ice tub or Epsom salt bath or stretching, whatever it might be, getting extra shots up. If you wanna actually love the game like that, then you'll sacrifice.\n\n\"If you're good to the game, the game is usually good to you.\"\n\nThat youthfulness was on display Monday night against the Knicks, when Crawford racked up a career-high 14 assists (off the bench), helping the Suns beat the Knicks, 128-110.\n\nThere is a lot of season left to be played, but even with the Suns winning three in a row, it doesn't appear as if they're heading for meaningful games soon. Crawford could ask for a trade to a contender if he wanted. He could aim for lofty stats, climbing further up on some leaderboards â€” he ranks 58th all-time in points, sixth all-time in made threes, and 25th all-time games played.\n\nBut those aren't Crawford's goals.\n\n\"The love of playing trumps all of that, to be honest with you,\" Crawford said. \"Even the day I retire, I'll still be playing somewhere.\""
