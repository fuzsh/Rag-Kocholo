        "text": "Rocky Widner/Getty Images\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks and Jamal Crawford agreed to a buyout on Friday, per Chris Haynes of ESPN.\n\nTNT's David Aldridge reported the Minnesota Timberwolves, Cleveland Cavaliers, Washington Wizards and Los Angeles Lakers will have interest in the free-agent guard.\n\nCrawford, 37, has continued to be an extremely valuable asset as a sixth man, averaging 12.3 points in 26.3 minutes per game off the bench for the Los Angeles Clippers last season. He was ultimately traded to the Atlanta Hawks in the Danilo Gallinari deal, however, but Crawford never seemed inclined to play for Atlanta.\n\nCrawford had some kind words for Atlanta after the buyout:\n\nBut Crawford has always been a player who could put the ball in the bucket and score in streaks, and that was the precise role he played for the Clippers. So adding Crawford for the influx of points he can bring off the bench will be a major boost to any team's depth and ability to spread around the scoring production through a number of players.\n\nAdd in Crawford's veteran presence and postseason experience, and there's no doubt he brings a lot his next team. At some point, Crawford's age will catch up to him and his production will slow down, but there are likely a number of teams willing to bet that won't occur next season."
