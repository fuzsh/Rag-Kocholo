        "text": "MINNEAPOLIS -- At 37 years old and having never played in the NBA Finals, Jamal Crawford certainly could have gone ring chasing when he received a buyout from the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers, who have met in the last three finals, were both interested in the veteran scorer. LeBron James was calling Crawford personally to recruit him to Cleveland.\n\nSo naturally, Crawford chose ... the Minnesota Timberwolves?\n\nThe Wolves have missed the playoffs for 13 straight seasons. But after Minnesota added Jimmy Butler, Taj Gibson and Jeff Teague this summer, Crawford decided to join Tom Thibodeau's team in hopes of being an integral part of a team trying to break through as opposed to the latest hired gun on an established contender.\n\n\"I want to experience it with these guys and go through the wars and the struggles and just really embrace the journey with these guys,\" Crawford said Wednesday. \"To me, that can be even more gratifying than just going to a team that's already made and ready to win a championship. Hopefully, we'll get there, but we'll all go through it together\" (see full story).\n\nSpurs: Ginobili indicates he'll return for 16th season\n\nSAN ANTONIO -- As the clock ticked down on the Spurs' season and Manu Ginobili was pulled from the game, a thunderous roar from the home crowd guided him to the bench.\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers\n\nComplete coverage of the Philadelphia 76ers and their rivals in the NBA from NBC Sports Philadelphia.\n\nGinobili wore an appreciative but quizzical look on his face as he put a warmup shirt back on and prepared to head off into the summer. Clearly, the fans were saying goodbye to one of the most popular players in Spurs history.\n\nGinobili was not ready to do the same: The Argentinian posted a message on his Twitter account on Wednesday that he is re-signing with San Antonio for another season, which will be his 16th with the Spurs.\n\n\"It felt like they wanted me to retire,\" Ginobili said with a smile after the Spurs were swept out of the Western Conference finals by the Golden State Warriors. \"Like they were giving me sort of a celebration night. And of course, I'm getting closer and closer.\"\n\nSave those goodbyes for at least another year (see full story).\n\nClippers: Griffin calls decision to stay a 'no-brainer'\n\nLOS ANGELES -- Blake Griffin was back in his usual place, front and center on a Clippers stage.\n\nAfter opting out of his contract, Griffin didn't spend the offseason toiling over whether to sign with another team -- like his teammate DeAndre Jordan famously did. For Griffin, it was an easy decision to sign a max five-year deal to stay with the only NBA team he's played for in his seven-year career.\n\n\"I want to say how excited I am to be back. This has been my home since I was drafted. A lot went into this decision,\" Griffin said Wednesday. \"In the end, I realized this was a no-brainer for me. This is the place where I want to start and finish my career. . This next chapter and next season for the Clippers and myself, I've never been more excited about an opportunity.\"\n\nGriffin, 28, is undoubtedly the star of the Clippers with Chris Paul gone in the trade with the Rockets that sent Pat Beverley to Los Angeles.\n\nGriffin said he and Paul talked about his decision to want to leave the Clippers.\n\n\"No hard feelings,\" said Griffin, a five-time All-Star. \"I think we're all professional enough to know and we've all been in the situation now to know sometimes you have to do what's right and what's best for yourself and your family. I've never had hard feelings with any of my teammates who decided to leave or felt like it was best to leave. I wouldn't start now\" (see full story).\n\nWizards: With Porter deal done, team keeps core intact\n\nWASHINGTON -- Otto Porter is a quiet, complementary piece to the Wizards' talented young core. He is also now Washington's highest-paid player.\n\nAt least temporarily.\n\nGuards John Wall and Bradley Beal garner most of the attention as Washington has made it to the second round of the NBA playoffs three of the last four seasons. But for now, Porter makes the most money after the Wizards matched a four-year, $106.5 million max-contract offer sheet the forward signed with the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nThere might be questions if the 24-year-old Porter is worth that money. But the Wizards believe he is a good fit alongside Wall, 26, a four-time All-Star, and Beal, 24, one of the league's top shooting guards.\n\n\"You just use that as motivation just like John and Brad did,\" Porter said at a news conference Wednesday. \"They set the bar high. I'm going to set my bar, high, too\" (see full story).\n\nGrizzlies: PG Chalmers signs contract\n\nMEMPHIS, Tenn. -- The Memphis Grizzlies have signed guard Mario Chalmers, nearly 1 1/2 years after he ruptured his right Achilles tendon playing for the team.\n\nThe Grizzlies announced the deal Wednesday. Terms of the contract weren't disclosed.\n\nThe 31-year-old Chalmers was injured in March 2016. During the 2015-16 season, Chalmers played 61 games for the Grizzlies and Miami Heat, averaging 10.3 points, 3.8 assists and 2.6 rebounds.\n\nChalmers played for Miami from 2008-15 and was part of the Heat's 2012 and 2013 NBA championship teams."
