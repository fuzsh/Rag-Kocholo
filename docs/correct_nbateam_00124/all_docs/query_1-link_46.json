        "text": "Jamal Crawford is one of the best players to come off the bench in the history of the NBA.\n\nHe has won three 6th Man of The Year Awards (tied for the most ever), and spent 20 seasons playing in the NBA for the Golden State Warriors, New York Knicks, Minnesota Timberwolves, Atlanta Hawks, Portland Trail Blazers, Los Angeles Clippers, Brooklyn Nets, Chicago Bulls and Phoenix Suns.\n\nOn Thursday, the 42-year-old officially announced that he would be joining the NBA on TNT.\n\nCrawford: \"Talk about a blessing!! Iâ€™m with the fam @NBAonTNT, @NBATV\"\n\nThis is big news for fans of the NBA because he is one of the most popular players ever, and they will now get to see him on TV a lot.\n\nHe has over 1.6 million followers on Twitter, more than Jimmy Butler, Devin Booker and other current NBA All-Stars.\n\nAndrew Marchand of The New York Post initially reported the news that Crawford would be Dwyane Wade's replacement.\n\nThe Miami Heat legend had been with the network for several years.\n\nIn 2008, Crawford averaged a career-high 20.6 points per game with the Knicks (he also dished out 5.0 assists per game).\n\nHowever, arguably his most valuable seasons came with the Hawks and Clippers (the two teams he won the 6th Man of The Year Award with).\n\nHe helped both teams make the second round of the NBA Playoffs.\n\nIn 74 career NBA Playoff games, he averaged 14.3 points, 1.9 rebounds and 2.2 assists per contest.\n\nHe most recently played for the Phoenix Suns (2019) and Brooklyn Nets (2020).\n\nBack in March, he announced his retirement.\n\nThe first game of the 2022-23 NBA regular season will take place on October 18 between the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers in Massachusetts."
