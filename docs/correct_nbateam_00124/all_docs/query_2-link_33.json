        "text": "Jamal Crawford News\n\nJamal Crawford Will Miss A Few Games\n\nBrooklyn Nets guard Jamal Crawford (hamstring) is going to be sidelined for a few games, according to head coach Jacque Vaughn. He looked solid during his bubble debut, but sadly it was short lived because of a hamstring strain. It's unclear if Crawford's injury will heal in time for him to help the team on the court this season. Caris Levert and Joe Harris (groin) will see a few extra minutes without Crawford available right now.\n\nAug 7\n\nJamal Crawford Won't Play Wednesday\n\nBrooklyn Nets guard Jamal Crawford (hamstring) has been ruled out for Wednesday's game against the Boston Celtics. He suffered the injury during his bubble debut and was only able to play for six minutes of the game. Both Caris Levert and Joe Harris are expected to be back after resting during their last contest. It sounds like Crawford is day-to-day right now, but it's unclear when he'll be back on the court. Both LeVert and Harris should be reliable DFS options with the Nets depleted right now.\n\nAug 5\n\nJamal Crawford Exits Early With Injury\n\nBrooklyn Nets guard Jamal Crawford (hamstring) was forced to miss the rest of Tuesday's game versus the Milwaukee Bucks due to injury. He played just six minutes before tweaking his left hamstring during his Nets debut. Crawford became the second-oldest player to suit up for the team, but sadly it didn't last long. He dropped five points and three assists before exiting the game. Hopefully he isn't going to be sideline too long because the Nets could use him on the court during the seeding games.\n\nAug 4\n\nJamal Crawford Listed As Out For Sunday\n\nBrooklyn Nets guard Jamal Crawford (conditioning) has been downgraded to out for Sunday's game against the Washington Wizards. He was listed as questionable, but it doesn't sound like Crawford is in game shape yet. Crawford joined the Nets late and wasn't able to play in the scrimmages or their first seeding game. It's unclear when he'll be ready to play, but he could have some low-end DFS value once he's back to full speed.\n\nAug 2\n\nJamal Crawford Agrees To Deal With Nets\n\nFree-agent guard Jamal Crawford has agreed to a deal with the Brooklyn Nets. The 40-year-old guard brings valuable depth to the organization after seven players decided to opt out of the restart. Crawford dropped a 51-point game with the Phoenix Suns during the 2018-2019 season. He clearly still has the ability to shoot the ball, which is great for Brooklyn since the team is thin at guard. Crawford should get plenty of playing time with the second unit. He should carry decent DFS value since the Nets are desperate for someone to shoot outside of Caris Levert.\n\nJul 11\n\nJamal Crawford Turns Back The Clock With 51 Points\n\nPhoenix Suns guard Jamal Crawford stole some of the spotlight from legend Dirk Nowitzki as he poured in 26 of his 51 points in the fourth quarter in the loss to the Mavericks on Tuesday. Crawford was on fire as he nailed 18 of 30 shots from the floor and added five rebounds with five assists and a block with a steal while drilling a season-high seven triples on the night. He was one point shy of his career high of 52 points and even though it was a meaningless game, it is still impressive that Crawford can still pull this type of night off at the age of 39.\n\nApr 10\n\nJamal Crawford Stays Hot In Sunday's Loss\n\nPhoenix Suns guard Jamal Crawford kept things going for his injury-plagued club on Sunday when the veteran racked up 27 points in the blowout loss to the Rockets. Crawford scored 27 points on 9-for-17 shooting and added six assists with four rebounds and a steal on the night. Crawford has averaged a remarkable 27.5 points over his last two games and is worth an add for Tuesday's tilt when the Suns take on the Mavericks. If his price tag is still friendly in DFS, he is also worth a look there as well on what will be a messy night in fantasy.\n\nApr 8\n\nJamal Crawford Records A Season-High 28 Points\n\nPhoenix Suns guard Jamal Crawford filled the void for the offense on Friday as the veteran magician collected 28 points in the overtime win over the Pelicans. Crawford added a full line, as he handed out seven dimes with two boards and added three steals with four triples as he proved there is still lots of gas left in the tank. He is tough to add in most formats, but with the Suns roster being very light in the player department, Crawford is definitely worth a punt play, assuming he suits up on Sunday against the Rockets.\n\nApr 6\n\nJamal Crawford Scores Season-High 22 Points Against Spurs\n\nPhoenix Suns shooting guard Jamal Crawford produced an impressive performance off the bench on Tuesday against the Spurs, scoring a season-high 22 points on 8-for-12 shooting in 30 minutes. He was 3-for-5 from deep and did a great job moving the rock as well, finishing with seven assists. With injuries hurting the Suns, Crawford has logged 20-plus minutes in six straight games, and while he's lost a step or two due to age, he can still shoot lights out on his day. He'll be looking to do so again on Saturday against his former team the Hawks, who have allowed the second-most points in the league to opposing shooting guards this season.\n\nJan 30"
