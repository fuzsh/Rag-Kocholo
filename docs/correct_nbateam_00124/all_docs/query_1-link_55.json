Known for his incredible ball-handling skills and creative passing, \"Pistol Pete\" was a five-time NBA All-Star and four-time All-NBA Team selection during his tenure with the Hawks. Though he never won a championship, Maravich's legacy as one of the greatest shooting guards in Hawks history is unquestionable, immortalized by his number 44 jersey retired by the team. To this day, his name remains synonymous with the essence of basketball artistry and showmanship.\n\nBirthplace : Little Rock, Arkansas\n\nNationality : American\n\nTeam : Phoenix Suns, Atlanta Hawks, Brooklyn Nets, Miami Heat, Utah Jazz\n\nPosition : Shooting guard\n\nAtlanta Hawks: 2005–2012\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks franchise acquired Joe Johnson in 2005 via trade from the Phoenix Suns, securing themselves an elite shooter and consistent scorer in the process. Johnson's cool demeanor and proficiency in knocking down long-range shots earned him the nickname \"Iso Joe,\" as he routinely converted isolation plays into buckets with ease. During his tenure with the Hawks, he was a six-time NBA All-Star and one-time All-NBA Third Team selection. His marksmanship and clutch performances solidified his place as one of the premier shooting guards in Atlanta Hawks history.\n\nBirthplace : Detroit, Highland Park, Michigan\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nPosition : Shooting guard\n\nAtlanta Hawks: 1994–1999\n\nOriginally drafted by the Miami Heat, Steve Smith found his way to the Atlanta Hawks in a 1994 trade. A versatile and well-rounded player, Smith's combination of size, basketball IQ, and shooting ability made him a potent offensive threat. He was named an NBA All-Star in 1998 and, in the same year, also garnered All-NBA Third Team honors for his outstanding play. The lasting impact of Smith's contributions to the team has earned him a place among the all-time great Atlanta Hawks shooting guards.\n\nBirthplace : Greensboro, North Carolina\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nPosition : Shooting guard, Small forward\n\nAtlanta Hawks: 1966–1977\n\nLou Hudson, affectionately known as \"Sweet Lou,\" joined the Atlanta Hawks after being drafted fourth overall in 1966.

Over the course of his time in Atlanta, he was a six-time NBA All-Star and amassed over 16,000 career points. Hudson's contributions to the franchise continue to be celebrated, as he remains firmly entrenched in the pantheon of great Atlanta Hawks shooting guards.\n\nBirthplace : Seattle, Washington\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : Chicago Bulls, New York Knicks, Golden State Warriors, Atlanta Hawks, Portland Trail Blazers\n\nPosition : Point guard, Shooting guard\n\nAtlanta Hawks: 2009–2011\n\nJamal Crawford, also known as \"J-Crossover,\" began his Atlanta Hawks journey in 2009 following a trade from the Golden State Warriors. A lethal scorer with a penchant for dazzling dribbling displays and clutch shots, Crawford quickly became a fan favorite. He garnered the NBA Sixth Man of the Year award in 2010 during his time with the Hawks, thanks to his remarkable ability to light up the scoreboard off the bench. His penchant for game-winning shots and silky-smooth playstyle endears him as one of the most memorable shooting guards to have donned the Atlanta jersey.\n\nBirthplace : Lakewood, California\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : New Jersey Nets\n\nPosition : Shooting guard, Small forward\n\nAtlanta Hawks: 2012–2017\n\nAcquired from the Chicago Bulls in a 2012 trade, Kyle Korver immediately made a significant impact on the Atlanta Hawks. A consummate sharpshooter with exceptional range, Korver's ability to space the floor and knock down three-pointers at a high clip was invaluable to the team's success. In 2015, he earned his first and only NBA All-Star selection while also setting an NBA record for the highest single-season three-point shooting percentage. Korver's time in Atlanta is fondly remembered and has cemented his status as one of the most lethal long-range shooters in franchise history."
