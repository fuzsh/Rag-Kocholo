        "text": "NEW YORK — Josh Jackson buried the right-wing 3-pointer after receiving the pass. But the message Jamal Crawford delivered to Jackson before the ball is what resonated.\n\n“(Crawford) told me, literally, where to stand, where to be and what was gonna happen,” Jackson said. “And it happened.”\n\nCrawford is still setting personal bests in his 19th NBA season. And after a career primarily built on a wicked crossover and putting the ball in the basket, it’s fitting Monday’s mark perfectly symbolized Crawford’s on- and off-the-court role with this young Suns team.\n\nHis 14 assists broke his previous career-high of 12, most recently achieved in 2005 inside this same iconic building. They spearheaded Phoenix’s 128-110 victory over the Knicks, clinching the franchise’s first three-game winning since early March 2017.\n\n“I’ve been in that zone scoring, where you get lost in the game. But (this time) I was in that zone passing,” Crawford said. “I felt like I’m gonna just create every play (and) try to get guys going (for) easy shots.\n\n“They had the tough job of finishing, but I had to try to navigate it.”\n\nCrawford was quick to remind that he played point guard in high school in the Seattle area, in college at Michigan and during his early NBA career, which began in 2000. He suggested that his instant-offense reputation drew the Knicks’ defensive focus, allowing him to find passing lanes for teammates. And once coach Igor Kokoskov realized Crawford was in “assist mode,” he tailored his play calls to that part of Crawford’s skill set.\n\nCrawford’s most popular target was Richaun Holmes, a slashing dunk highlighting his six finishes off the assists. Crawford dished the key pass on three consecutive possessions at the end of the Suns’ dominant third quarter, confidently throwing his arms into the air before T.J. Warren’s 3-pointer even dropped through the rim. He had six assists in the fourth quarter, breaking his career mark on a bounce pass to star Devin Booker for a fadeaway jumper.\n\n“Everything he does just looks really flashy,” Booker said. “I don’t think he tries. It’s just his game. His handle is so tight. He’ll just throw it like that real quick. He has that instinct of basketball, just a ‘hooper’ mentality.”\n\nAdded Holmes: “His basketball mind was really on display tonight.”\n\nCrawford ranks second on the Suns with 3.3 assists per game and has become a complementary offense-initiator for a Phoenix team still without an established traditional point guard. Booker is a dynamic scorer and emerging playmaker with the ball in his hands, but even after his recent return from a nagging hamstring injury, Kokoskov has kept De’Anthony Melton as the starter at point guard in order to use his defensive length on the perimeter.\n\nFor now, this appears to be the Suns’ ballhandling group.\n\nLate Monday, ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reported Phoenix will immediately waive Austin Rivers after acquiring him in the trade that sent Trevor Ariza to Washington. Prior to Monday’s game in New York, Kokoskov said he expected both Rivers and wing Kelly Oubre to join the Suns in Boston, where they play the Celtics Wednesday night.\n\nCrawford’s veteran impact stretches beyond his on-court production. His leadership helped spark this three-game surge, which occurred during a tumultuous week lowlighted by arena controversy, relocation rumblings and a botched (then not-botched) trade.\n\nCrawford spoke at Thursday’s shootaround about establishing winning habits and “speaking it into existence,” a mantra he learned from former coach Isiah Thomas during his time with the Knicks. A national-televised victory over Dallas followed, snapping the Suns’ 10-game losing skid.\n\nRookie big man Deandre Ayton continues to tell Crawford every day that it’s an “honor” to play with him, proclaiming, “you amp this team up, just because of who you are and what you did and you’re still doing it.”\n\n“We’re doing the right things,” Crawford said. “We’re playing with the right spirit, more than anything. We’re playing for each other, and it’s a lot of fun.”\n\nBecause of Crawford’s lengthy career and kind personality, Suns road games often double as a reunion tour of sorts. A group of longtime Knicks team attendants entered the visiting locker room to greet and take photos with Crawford, who was holding the night’s game ball.\n\n“I got (a photo with Crawford) 17 years ago!” one hollered.\n\n“I got one when he scored 50!” yelled another.\n\nA few minutes later, Crawford exited Madison Square Garden with that basketball tucked under his arm. He finally kept it to himself, instead of dishing it out to a teammate.\n\n(Top photo: Sarah Stier/Getty Images)"
