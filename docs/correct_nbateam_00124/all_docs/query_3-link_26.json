        "text": "Jamal Crawford is a dangerous player. The kind who can give defenders fits and opposing coaches anxiety.\n\n“He makes shots that you don’t think should go in,” said Scott Brooks, coach of the Oklahoma City Thunder, who will take on the Clippers 12:30 p.m. today at Staples Center in Game 4 of their Western Conference semifinal series.\n\nBrooks was just getting started.\n\n“He can generate offense by playing isolation basketball and he’s a hard cover,” Brooks said of Crawford, who Friday received his second NBA Sixth Man of the Year award. “You put a smaller guy on him, he shoots over him. You put a bigger guy on him, he can get around him with some of his moves.\n\n“He comes in, he gives them a spark and the guy can score anywhere from 15 to 35 points any given night, and that’s definitely a luxury that Doc has.”\n\nClippers coach Doc Rivers says one of the things that makes Crawford so good is that he does more than score. But scoring is his best attribute.\n\n“He can score in his sleep,” Rivers said. “I never saw a guy who can sit for 15 minutes, literally be on the floor for half a second and swing the ball and he’s ready to shoot and makes the shot.”\n\nTo think Crawford could have messed it all up long before he played just one year of college ball, long before he became a pro. Crawford remembers hanging with a sketchy crowd as early as 11 years old in Seattle. At the behest of his mother, he moved to South Central Los Angeles to live with his father, where he was hassled by local gangs, ahead of moving back to play ball at Rainier Beach High in Seattle.\n\n“Yeah, I mean, gangs are basically everywhere,” Crawford said. “And you’re around them in some way, shape or form whether you’re trying to be or not trying to be.”\n\nFrom the sound of it, Crawford kind of wanted to be with them when he was in Seattle prior to his move to L.A.\n\n“I’ve had so many different interactions with them,” Crawford said. “It wasn’t just in L.A. It was in Seattle, too. That’s why I went to L.A. because I was with the wrong crowd. I was coming home at 12 o’clock at night, at 11 years old, you know what I mean?”\n\nWhen Crawford moved to Los Angeles, he was in the last stages of middle school. He then attended Dorsey High for a couple of years, but didn’t play basketball. For one thing, he was getting the business from area gangs.\n\n“It wasn’t always the best experiences, and there were run-ins sometimes,” he said. “Some unwarranted, and sometimes that’s just the culture of where you’re at.”\n\nFor another, Crawford admits he didn’t realize that one had to maintain academic standards in order to be eligible to play.\n\n“Before I went to high school, I didn’t even know you had to have a certain grade-point-average to play basketball,” he said. “You didn’t have to in middle school and that’s where you’re coming from. You’re young, you’re immature, you’re in the ninth grade.\n\n“It’s a whole new world. … So it’s, ‘Oh, man, I’m in high school now. I’m going to have fun.’ I wasn’t really the most focused. I changed that focused and things really turned around for me.”\n\nCrawford made it clear he was never initiated into a gang.\n\n“No, no, no, I was never in a gang, not at all,” he said. “I’ve always known people that are in gangs, but I was never in a gang myself.”\n\nStill, if he didn’t alter his ways, he never would have been able to play basketball for Rainier Beach after moving back to Seattle. Once he became academically eligible, he led the Vikings to a state title in 1998.\n\n“What I didn’t understand then,” Crawford said of his days at Dorsey, “I understood later on that I would have to really buckle down and focus more on school and basketball than anything else. Like, before I had a girlfriend or kids or friends, I had my basketball.\n\n“My love for basketball was deeper than anything else, and I just had to figure out the best route.”\n\nWithout high school, the road to the NBA might have hit a big detour, or been closed altogether. But his metamorphosis helped lead him to Michigan, where he toiled just one year for the Wolverines. Even though he was suspended for a handful of games for improper interactions with a booster, he had shown well enough to enter the 2000 NBA draft — he was taken by Cleveland but traded to Chicago on draft day — after his freshman season.\n\nThe rest, as they say, is history. Crawford, 34, averaged 18.6 in this, his 14th season. In 2007-08 as a starter with the New York Knicks, he averaged a career-high 20.6 points and has a career average of 15.6.\n\nAnd, like Brooks suggested, he is fully capable of taking over a given game.\n\n“I mean, just having Jamal on the court is great,” Clippers teammate Blake Griffin said. “He’s the guy you have to worry about when he’s shooting at a high percentage.”\n\nWith all of his talent, Crawford is about as cool a cat as you’ll find in the NBA, which makes his story even better.\n\n“That comes from my parents,” he said. “They always stressed humility and being respectful. Always treat people the way you want to be treated, always look people in the eye.”\n\nEspecially when he’s about to bury a 25-foot jumper in someone’s face."
