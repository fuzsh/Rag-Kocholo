        "text": "On the eve of the NBA's return to the end of the 2019-2020 season, Jamal Crawford joins the Brooklyn Nets after a year away from the league since his stint at the Phoenix Suns, where he played the 2018-2019 season.\n\nJamal has a quite considerable history throughout these 20 years in the NBA. He started his career in 2000 as the 8th choice for the Cleveland Cavaliers in the draft but was soon replaced by the post Jordan Chicago Bulls of Jerry Krause where he would spend 4 seasons with an average of 17.3 points per game and 73 games. He then continued with the same disposition in the New York Knicks between 2004-08 even on the bench averaging 20.6 points per game.\n\nIn the 2009-10 season playing for the Atlanta Hawks, he was still hungry and was awarded for the first time as the ‘Sixth Man of the Year’ with an average of 18 points per game. He would be the second “Sixth Man of the Year” for Los Angelis Clippers in the 2013-14 season and repeat the feat the following season receiving the third “Sixth Man of the Year” award with an average of 18.6 points per game.\n\nThis guy has always been \"feared\" for his skills with the ball and especially for his crossovers. Shammell Stallworth, a player from São Paulo basketball and the STREETOPIA TEAM, recently recalled Jamal Crawford's plays at “The Ballers Call”, a meeting of athletes around the world through the Instagram lives of STREETOPIA:\n\n“Jamal Crawford was the guy who was the best player, by playing by himself his own way, because the guy didn’t practice, he was physically skinny, but man, there was no way to steal his ball, he was like this, whatever came up he already knew his move. You go to the right, he throws the ball behind, it was impossible…”"
