        "text": "Jerry Brewer Seattle Times staff columnist wrote a wonderful article with Rainier Beach’s own Jamal Crawford. The headline refers to him as one of Rainier Beach’s best basketball players. Do you agree? Anyway, the article provides an insight of a Rainier Beach honed individual we can all be proud of.\n\nJamal Crawford (11) was a key contributor for the Clippers this season, averaging nearly 19 points per game and winning the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year award. It’s a Friday afternoon in his offseason, and Jamal Crawford is on a basketball court at the Rainier Vista Boys & Girls Club, surrounded by grade-school children. Basketballs are flying. Limbs are flailing. In the middle stands Crawford, shooting set shots with his rambunctious crowd. “How’d you make that half-court shot?” one boy asks. “Did you ever play football?” another randomly wonders. Crawford, the former Rainier Beach High School star and two-time NBA Sixth Man of the Year, grins as he answers each question. And when he tells the kids he must leave, there’s a chorus of “Bye, Jamal!” “Nothing like home,” Crawford says. “It’s good to be back.”\n\nThough Crawford would rather be playing in the NBA Finals right now, this is a much-needed homecoming after the wildest of his 14 pro seasons. What happened this year? What didn’t happen? Crawford played perhaps the best basketball of his life. He debuted his signature sneakers. He fought through a late-season injury. And then, in the middle of a playoff run with the Los Angeles Clippers, he came to understand that his team’s owner is an unapologetic racist. “At 14 years in the NBA, I thought I had seen every situation,” Crawford said. “But this was a whole new challenge. This was something you couldn’t prepare for.”\n\nCrawford, 34, has played for six NBA teams. He has had to follow 17 different head coaches. He has been traded twice and experienced negotiations for four contracts. He has played for underachievers and overachievers, and he has been criticized and praised. But this Donald Sterling firestorm was too crazy and complicated for even his veteran savvy. When TMZ released a racially insensitive conversation between Sterling and a female companion six weeks ago, it rocked the Clippers. They had team meetings and all-out vent sessions. They protested by turning their warmup shirts inside out and then dumping them at halfcourt before a playoff game at Golden State. Then they watched the entire league, led by new commissioner Adam Silver, feel their pain and take a stance against Sterling, who was banished from the league and pressured into selling the team. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer bid $2 billion on the franchise, and he will be the Clippers’ new owner unless Sterling wins a lawsuit against the league."
