        "text": "Doug Christie’s Pro-Am League in Seattle was full of notables. Shawn Kemp. Sam Perkins. Terrell Brandon. Damon Stoudamire. Jerome Kersey. Cliff Robinson. Not to mention a host of others who played college ball or overseas somewhere. The league was so popular that a draft was needed to choose which 72 players, from the pool of about 175, would make-up the six-team league.\n\nSo you can imagine the reaction to some scrub high school junior taking up a spot. Still, J.R. Harris, then-Christie’s agent, let 16-year-old Jamal Crawford play.\n\nA few games into the 1996 summer league, Christie tweaked his ankle and Harris, the coach of Christie’s team, turned the reins over to Crawford. Almost immediately, the old heads witnessed first hand that the kid from Rainier Beach High was no scrub.\n\n“He started dropping 35s and 40s. He got our team to the finals,” Harris said. “He was doing stuff we’d never seen before. Nobody who came through Seattle handled the ball like that. Then, when he started hitting that jumper, he owned you. That summer league created his legend in the city. Yep, I’ll use the word ‘legend.’ He’d already had a little name for himself, but that’s when he became a legend.”\n\nWhen the Warriors acquired Crawford from the New York Knicks, they got a player reputed as one of the best-kept secrets in the NBA. Some NBA insiders rave about his game, and he is considered by many to be one of the most underrated players in the league.\n\nBut if he’s so good, why have you hardly heard of him? Probably because Crawford’s temperament, bashful and humble, won’t let you. Or because he can’t shake the reputation of a streetball player, featuring more flashiness than consistency, more style than substance. Or because he’s never been on a winning team.\n\nBut this, Crawford said, is his opportunity. Though he can opt out of his contract after this season and become a free agent, he said the Bay Area represents a chance for him to take his career to a new level.\n\n“This is the perfect match,” he said. “We could do this together, turn this thing around. I mean, they didn’t bring me here for a rest-of-the-season stretch. I’m hoping they brought me here for a long-term thing. I want to win more than anything. If you win, that all takes care of itself. There’s only a certain level you can reach until you win.”\n\nCrawford has always been an exceptional talent. As a teenager, he became a wizard with the ball and developed a knack for scoring that dropped jaws. His flair on the court belied his muted disposition, and he was surprisingly athletic for such a skinny frame.\n\nIt’s no wonder where he got such ability. Crawford’s father, Clyde – who played point guard at Oregon and was an NBA prospect before blowing out his knee – put a ball in his son’s hand at age 2. Though he spent most of his childhood in Seattle with his mom, Crawford lived in Los Angeles with his father for stretches. Because of his father, he was always around basketball.\n\n“He was always a little upset with me,” Crawford said of his dad. “Because he was like, ‘Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.’ He was good enough to make it but didn’t because of injury. So he saw the downfall of not making it.”\n\nBut Crawford didn’t listen and put his eggs, bacon and biscuit all in one basket. He was one of those kids who always had a ball in his hands, could always be found on a court somewhere. He would sometimes play by himself at Liberty Park in Seattle in the rain, the snow even.\n\nMaking it to the NBA wasn’t a question for Crawford, a mindset that caused him a fair share of grief. He didn’t play high school basketball until his junior year because his grades weren’t up to par. He was suspended for eight games at Michigan for attempting to enter his name in the NBA draft while in high school after signing a letter of intent to play for the Wolverines.\n\nBut Crawford wasn’t the only who knew he was destined to play in the NBA. When he was 16, Seattle SuperSonics assistant coach Steve Gordon, who ran youth development programs in Seattle, brought Crawford in to play open runs with the Sonics.\n\nOne time, Seattle forward Detlef Schrempf got caught trying to defend the teenager in the open court. Crawford hit him with a crossover, causing Schrempf to buckle to the hardwood.\n\n“He did something crazy,” said Gordon, now a consultant with the Portland Trail Blazers. “I can’t even articulate what he did. He basically broke Detlef’s feet at half court. We thought Detlef was hurt.”\n\nSchrempf was upset and protested Crawford’s move, contending it was carrying or traveling or something. But Sonics guard Eric Snow sent the gym into laughter by imploring Schrempf to accept the fact that a high schooler just embarrassed him.\n\n“He crossed up more than Detlef,” said Magic forward Rashard Lewis, a youngster for the Sonics back then. “Him and Ray Allen went at it for a while. This was a young guy playing against NBA players and holding his own.”\n\nCrawford has held his own in his eight-plus years in the NBA. He had a break-out year — 17.3 points, 5.1 assists and 1.4 steals — in 2003-04 with the Chicago Bulls, who acquired him from the Cavaliers on draft night in 2000. He’s averaged at least 17 points and 4.0 assists in four of the last five seasons, including 20.6 points and 5.0 assists last season for the New York Knicks.\n\nLast Saturday at Charlotte, he notched 50 points for the third time in his career.\n\n“He can hit 17 or 18 in a row. We’ve seen him do that,” said guard Dwyane Wade, whose Miami Heat were victims of Crawford’s best-game ever – 52 points in January of 2007, including 16 made baskets in a row.\n\n“You can’t get up on him because he’s got the handles that a lot of people don’t have, and he’s very quick.”\n\nYou would think he was Michael Jordan the way people around the league talk about him. For a long time, Hall of Fame point guard Magic Johnson has called Crawford one of his favorite players. Coaching great Larry Brown said Crawford, during their one season together in New York, showed more improvement than any player he’s ever coached. Even Jordan himself, when he was an executive in Washington, tried to trade for Crawford.\n\n“He’s an offensive machine,” Denver Nuggets point guard Chauncey Billups said. “He scores in a lot of different ways. He’s got every move in the book. He’s got the three ball. He’s got midrange. He’s got floaters. He’s a tough, tough cover. He was born to play this game. He doesn’t get the credit, man, but from his peers, everybody who plays against him, you know you’ve got a long night when you go against Jamal. The Bay Area is in for a treat.”\n\nBut something is keeping Crawford from being a household name. Something has prevented him from getting a sniff at an All-Star Game or All-NBA recognition, from racking up huge endorsement dollars.\n\nIt certainly has something to do with his mild-mannered disposition. Crawford can be shier than a math geek in a sorority house. He said experience and fatherhood (he has a 10-year-old son, Eric) has mellowed him out plenty, so the indulging he took part in is now borderline extinct.\n\nFew know he co-owns with Jay-Z a recording studio in New York frequented by some of hip-hop and R&Bs biggest names. Or that he had his own Reebok shoe. Even fewer know about his extensive charity work.\n\nCrawford is reputed as one of the more charity-minded players in the league. His community work takes up nearly an entire page in his bio. But he doesn’t like to talk about it.\n\nIn Oklahoma City, Crawford ran into an old friend from Seattle, Fred Montgomery, a self-described ex-gang member who grew up with Crawford in a rough area called “the village.” He had no problem bragging about Crawford’s efforts, forcing Crawford to divert his attention to ease the embarrassment.\n\nThe two spent a moment trying to remember the name of someone they knew from the ‘hood who’d died. Crawford remembered him, but couldn’t get the name off the tip of his tongue, which is odd considering he paid for the funeral.\n\nBecause he was traded to the Warriors, his annual Christmas gifts-giving event in New York had to be canceled. So, instead, bright and early on Christmas Eve, hours after returning from the Warriors’ five-game road trip, Crawford was at Wal-Mart in East Oakland giving away $15,000 worth of gift cards, signing autographs and taking pictures. He had to be talked into allowing a photographer to come.\n\n“This kid, he gives back to the community like there’s no tomorrow,” Montgomery said. “He doesn’t ask for any credit. People don’t see what we see. I almost think he gives too much.”\n\nSomeone acutely aware of Crawford’s generous spirit is Portland Trail Blazers guard Brandon Roy. The two met through a mutual friend, former Washington Huskies guard Will Conroy, and Crawford befriended and mentored Roy.\n\nRoy, also a Seattle native, said he was surprised at how down-to-earth Crawford was despite his status. He said Crawford, who advised Roy not to rush into the NBA, was a big reason he stayed at Washington.\n\n“He saw that we had a lot in common,” Roy said. “He saw me as a good dude and he didn’t want me to be corrupted. A lot of things that guys had to go through, I didn’t have to go through because he took me under his wing. My mom even loves him. She thinks he’s the sweetest dude in the world, and she’s a great judge of character.”\n\nSounds like Crawford should have billboards in Times Square, right? Sounds like the Warriors pulled off the steal of the century, doesn’t it?\n\nSome say no. More than his disdain for attention, the brat stigma Crawford hasn’t been able to shake is the reason he isn’t more well-known. His scandals at Michigan – he also was suspended for accepting extra benefits from a Seattle businessman, prompting him to enter the draft after one season – and his clashing with coach Scott Skiles in Chicago early in his career tarnished his image.\n\nHaving playground tendencies in his game — the fancy dribbling, the addiction to difficult shots, the matador defense — doesn’t help. A YouTuber with the handle Odenized illustrates a perception of Crawford with the video he posted in February. It was called “Why No One Would Trade for Jamal Crawford” and it was clip of him against Charlotte failing in an attempt to throw an alley-oop off the glass to himself.\n\nFor every eye-popping fade-away he makes, he’ll miss three or four, which he says is the reason his low field goal percentage (40.3 percent for his career). He’s been known to “drop dimes” but his career assist-to-turnover ratio is just 2-to-1, good for a swingman, but not a player who considers himself a point guard.\n\nHe’s also known for his streakiness, which the Warriors already have seen. It’s understood that when he gets going, he’s almost unstoppable. But his style of play makes him prone to more off nights than you’d like from a player of his caliber. So far this season, he has nine games with at least 25 points, including 50-, 40- and 32-point performances. But he’s also had six games in single digits, including one point in 32 minutes against Milwaukee while with the Knicks.\n\n“When I first came into the league, they used to talk a lot about players who can get to the rim,” Crawford said. “With my handle, I can get by anybody. To me, that’s the easy part. To me, it’s more impressive to do a move and then shoot a fade-away or something. I had to learn that all the great scorers get to the line, get to the rim, open up things for their teammates. But I didn’t understand that coming in.”\n\nWhat Crawford now understands is that he must win. He’s been on losing teams his entire career, which puts a ceiling on his star power.\n\nIn his ninth season, he’s played for 10 coaches. He’s jostled between point guard and shooting guard for most of his career, which hasn’t afforded him the luxury of mastering either craft. But, in the end, he’ll be measured by wins and losses.\n\nSo far, the closest he’s gotten to the postseason was 2006-07 when the Knicks led the Atlantic Division late in the season before collapsing down the stretch largely because of injuries. New York was expected to compete for a playoff spot this season, but Crawford is now on a team already booked for Secaucus, N.J., site of the NBA draft lottery.\n\nAs was the case in New York, he’s expected to play a big role in getting the Warriors back into the playoffs, and he’ll be judged on whether he gets it done.\n\n“Because he’s so talented, people expect so much from him and are kind of hard on him,” Roy said. “If Jamal gets to play on that playoff stage, watch out. Because Jamal is one of those guys people around the league knows about. It’s people outside the league don’t know about him. But if they get a chance to see him, they’re going to love him.”"
