They were dominated in almost every facet of the game. It led to a 4-1 series win for Trae Young & Co., sending the Knicks packing their bags after Wednesday night’s 103-89 loss at MSG. While it was a wildly disappointing playoffs, it was a memorable season for the Knicks, who were expected to win only about 25-30 games. They won 41 and finished as the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference — not too shabby for a roster that nobody saw doing that well.\n\nTo break down the series loss to the Hawks, the 2020-21 Knicks season and look ahead to what they might do in the offseason, we bring you the Season 2 finale of the “Big Apple Buckets” podcast with Sal Licata, Jerome “The Junk Yard Dog” Williams and Jake Brown.\n\nOR LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher\n\nEPISODE 48: KNICKS ON BRINK OF ELIMINATION FEAT. ASHLEY NICOLE MOSS\n\nMay 31, 2021\n\nThe Knicks looked almost unrecognizable in Atlanta in Games 3 and 4. After tying the series at The Garden on Wednesday, they were blown out both games on the road and now are on the brink of elimination, down 3-1. What the heck happened to this team down south? Can it win Game 5 at MSG and come back in this series?\n\nTo answer those questions, we bring you a new episode of the “Big Apple Buckets” podcast with Sal Licata, Jerome “The Junk Yard Dog” Williams and Jake Brown, featuring a chat with friend of the program, Ashley Nicole Moss.\n\nOR LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher\n\nEPISODE 47: MSG ROCKED FOR MUCH-NEEDED KNICKS WIN FEAT. ANTHONY DONAHUE\n\nMay 27, 2021\n\nMadison Square Garden was shaking on Wednesday night.\n\nIt almost felt like an earthquake late in the game. It was out of a movie. The Knicks won a thrilling game to even the series at one and send it back to Atlanta. What an unbelievable atmosphere at the World’s Most Famous Arena.\n\nTo talk about that and the first two games, we bring you a new episode of the “Big Apple Buckets” podcast with Sal Licata, Jerome “The Junk Yard Dog” Williams and Jake Brown, featuring an interview with Knicks super fan Anthony Donahue.\n\nOR LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher\n\nEPISODE 46: KNICKS-HAWKS PLAYOFF PREVIEW, PREDICTIONS FEAT. DICK BARNETT\n\nMay 18, 2021\n\nWho would have thought we would be sitting here in the second half of May talking about the Knicks in the playoffs? And not just in the playoffs, but hosting Game 1 at Madison Square Garden. What a time to be alive. The Knicks have stunned the basketball world behind Tom Thibodeau’s top-ranked defense and begin their playoff run Sunday against the Hawks.\n\nTo give you an in-depth Knicks-Hawks playoff preview, we bring you a brand new episode of the “Big Apple Buckets” podcast with Sal Licata, Jerome “The Junk Yard Dog” Williams and Jake Brown, featuring an interview with two-time Knicks NBA champion Dr. Dick Barnett.\n\nOR LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher\n\nEPISODE 45: KNICKS’ FINAL PUSH FOR NO. 4 SEED\n\nMay 11, 2021\n\nIt’s here folks. Four games to go. Less than a week left in what has been a magical 2020-21 New York Knicks season to remember. They are sitting alone at the moment in the fourth spot in the Eastern Conference with four pivotal games to go. The race is tight, and one or two losses could mean losing homecourt in the first round of the playoffs. It all begins Tuesday night when Julius Randle takes on his old squad in Los Angeles.\n\nTo talk about the final four games, the impressive West Coast trip and whom they might face come playoff time, we bring you a new episode of the “Big Apple Buckets” podcast with Sal Licata, former Knicks big man Jerome “The Junk Yard Dog” Williams and Jake Brown.\n\nOR LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher\n\nEPISODE 44: PATRICK EWING TALKS 2021 KNICKS, ’90s KNICKS, COACHING\n\nMay 4, 2021\n\nThe Knicks have clinched their first winning season since 2013. There are lot of reasons to celebrate. They will finish over .500. They have won three straight games and 12 of their last 13. They entered Tuesday with a 1.5-game lead for the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference. Derrick Rose has been a godsend for this team since they re-acquired him. Julius Randle continues play at an MVP level. And the Knicks have seven games remaining until they are back in the playoffs.\n\nTo talk about all the positive vibes with the Knicks and have a terrific conversation with Knicks legend and Georgetown head coach Patrick Ewing, we bring you a new episode of the “Big Apple Buckets” podcast with Sal Licata, Jerome “The Junk Yard Dog” Williams and Jake Brown.\n\nOR LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher\n\nEPISODE 43: CP3 ENDS KNICKS’ DAZZLING WIN STREAK FEAT. GEORGE GERVIN\n\nApril 27, 2021\n\nThe Knicks deserved a standing ovation following their loss to the Suns. A team that was not expected to sniff the playoffs went on a nine-game winning streak and took the team with the second-best record in the NBA to the brink. They played their hearts out and a future Hall of Famer finished them, making a few impossible shots. You tip your cap to Chris Paul and you tip your cap to the Knicks, who still hold the fourth seed in the East after finally losing a game.\n\nTo dive into what was a dazzling win streak, the loss to the Suns, CP3’s future and the road ahead for the Knicks, we bring you a new episode of the “Big Apple Buckets” podcast with Sal Licata and Jerome “The Junk Yard Dog” Williams, featuring an interview with one of the greatest 50 players in NBA history, George “The Iceman” Gervin.\n\nOR LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher\n\nEPISODE 42: THE KNICKS’ MAGICAL RUN FEAT. ASHLEY NICOLE MOSS\n\nApril 20, 2021\n\nHow fun are these Knicks? It’s must-watch basketball every night. They have won six straight games and have four home games coming up. They are now 31-27 and are tied for the No. 5 seed in the East, just a half game behind the Hawks for the No. 4 seed. This has been a truly magical run after a dry spell that had fans worried this team might drop to one of the final spots. They are now putting themselves in a position where they could potentially have homecourt advantage in the first round.\n\nTo dive into the Knicks’ hot streak, we bring you a new episode of the “Big Apple Buckets” podcast with Sal Licata and Jerome “The Junk Yard Dog” Williams, featuring a chat with SNY and KnicksFanTV’s Ashley Nicole Moss.\n\nOR LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher\n\nEPISODE 41: RJ BARRETT’S SENSATIONAL DEVELOPMENT FEAT. SPEEDY CLAXTON\n\nApril 13, 2021\n\nThe Knicks are on a desperately needed three-game winning streak as they continue their playoff push.\n\nJulius Randle just abused his former team Monday. RJ Barrett is turning into a star-level player right in front of our eyes. The role players are making key plays. It’s amazing what a good three-game stretch can do for a team. The Knicks are now right back in the conversation to try to get a spot in the top six and avoid the new play-in tournament.\n\nTo talk all about the Knicks past week, we bring you a new episode of the “Big Apple Buckets” podcast with Sal Licata and Jerome “The Junk Yard Dog” Williams, featuring an interview with Speedy Claxton, the new head coach of the Hofstra Pride men’s basketball team.\n\nOR LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher\n\nEPISODE 40: WHAT HAS GONE WRONG WITH KNICKS?\n\nApril 6, 2021\n\nThe Nets have had the Knicks’ number. Brooklyn finished off a season sweep of Tom Thibodeau’s squad Monday in a tight finish. The Knicks have come down to earth the past week as they hold on to playoff hopes. This team likely will finish in the top 10 in the East, but with how they are playing of late, it might have to come in the play-in tournament. A best-of-seven first-round playoff series is not looking as promising for the Knicks as it did a few weeks ago.\n\nWith a tough schedule ahead, this is a big stretch coming up for the Knicks this week. To talk about the playoff push, we bring you a new episode of the “Big Apple Buckets” podcast with Sal Licata and Jerome “The Junk Yard Dog” Williams.\n\nOR LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher\n\nEPISODE 39: BREAKING DOWN KNICKS PLAYOFF PUSH FEAT. ALLAN HOUSTON\n\nMarch 30, 2021\n\nThe Knicks have 25 games to go. They are currently fifth in the Eastern Conference. It’s been a thrilling season for a team that didn’t have playoff expectations. Now, it would be a debacle if they missed the playoffs. They decided to stand pat at the trade deadline and not bolster the young roster. Was that the right decision?\n\nWe answer that question and talk everything Knicks on the latest “Big Apple Buckets” podcast with Sal Licata and Jerome “The Junk Yard Dog” Williams, featuring a terrific interview with Knicks legend Allan Houston.\n\nOR LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher\n\nEPISODE 38: SHOULD THE KNICKS MAKE A TRADE?\n\nMarch 23, 2021\n\nThe Knicks had a couple of gut-wrenching losses to the Sixers in the past week. Julius Randle has vented his frustrations with some poor officiating. The Knicks All-Star forward and company need to put Sunday’s heartbreaker in the rear view mirror, though. They have two games against the lowly Wizards they really need to win before the schedule begins to get difficult with fewer than 30 games remaining in the regular season. Will Randle have one or more new teammates by the end of the week?\n\nTo talk about the trade deadline and whether the Knicks should make a move, along with everything else going on with Tom Thibodeau’s team, we bring you a new episode of the “Big Apple Buckets” podcast with Sal Licata and Jerome “The Junk Yard Dog” Williams, featuring quite the story from JYD on the time he was traded from the Pistons to the Raptors in 2001.\n\nOR LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher\n\nEPISODE 37: KNICKS NEED ANOTHER SHOOTER FEAT. JOHN WALLACE, BILL PIDTO\n\nMarch 16, 2021\n\nJulius Randle lost a chance to tie the game for the Knicks on Monday. With that said, the Knicks had their chances to beat the Nets. They missed open shots and were forced to have to rally late to get themselves into a one-possession game. Knicks fans were frustrated and rightfully so. This team might need to add a shooter if they want to have a shot at a run and maybe winning a round in the playoffs.\n\nTo talk about the heartbreaking loss to the Nets and where the team is at, we bring you a new episode of the “Big Apple Buckets” podcast with Sal Licata and Jerome “The Junk Yard Dog” Williams, featuring interviews with John Wallace and Bill Pidto.\n\nOR LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher\n\nEPISODE 36: SHOULD KNICKS ADD ANOTHER PIECE? FEAT. QUENTIN RICHARDSON\n\nMarch 9, 2021\n\nThe Knicks enter the second half of the season as the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference. If you said that before the season, people would laugh at you. With 35 games to go in this pandemic-shortened 72-game season, the Knicks have a very good chance of making the playoffs. They might not even have to worry about the play-in games if they finish in the eight-to-10 range, if they keep playing the way they have been. Will the Knicks continue their impressive play?\n\nTo answer that, look ahead and recap Obi Toppin getting robbed in the Slam Dunk Contest, we bring you a new episode of the “Big Apple Buckets” podcast with Sal Licata and Jerome “The Junk Yard Dog” Williams, featuring an interview with a guy that played for the Knicks and won a 3-point contest in his career, Quentin Richardson.\n\nOR LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher\n\nEPISODE 35: KNICKS ARE SHOCKING THE WORLD FEAT.

You can’t miss these Knicks.\n\nYou also can’t miss everyone’s favorite Knicks podcast. That would be “Big Apple Buckets” with Sal Licata and Jerome “The Junk Yard Dog” Williams.

While it’s only 10 percent capacity, 2,000 people can still make some noise and bring some energy to a Knicks team that is just a game under .500 and in the seventh spot in the Eastern Conference. Fans are back, Julius Randle is potentially going to be an All-Star and the Knicks are playing great basketball.\n\nThere’s no better time to tune in to a brand new episode of the “Big Apple Buckets” podcast with Sal Licata and Jerome “The Junk Yard Dog” Williams, featuring an interview with Knicks standout rookie guard Immanuel Quickley.\n\nOR LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher\n\nEPISODE 33: THE KNICKS ARE FINALLY FUN AGAIN\n\nFebruary 16, 2021\n\nThe Knicks are finally fun again!

The team traded Dennis Smith Jr. and a second-round draft pick to the Pistons for Rose on Sunday. The former NBA MVP is reunited with head coach Tom Thibodeau, after a successful Bulls run and another stop with the Timberwolves.

It’s been a rocky back-and-forth ride for Tom Thibodeau’s squad, who lost a heartbreaker to the Bulls in Chicago Monday night. Speaking of those Bulls, should the Knicks do whatever it takes to make a trade for their star Zach LaVine?\n\nWe debate that and much more on the latest episode of the “Big Apple Buckets” podcast with Sal Licata and Jerome “The Junk Yard Dog” Williams, featuring an interview with Bleacher Report’s Taylor Rooks.\n\nOR LISTEN ON: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher\n\nEPISODE 30: SHOULD QUICKLEY BE STARTING?
