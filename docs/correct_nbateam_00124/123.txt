Jamal Crawford is hanging up his kicks and crossing over toward retirement.

After his 19 NBA seasons played, the last two as a free agent, the three-time Sixth Man of the Year and former Phoenix Sun point guard announced his decorated career's end in a tweet on Monday.

The tweet has a photo of Crawford showing his back to the camera, facing an outdoor hoop with a basketball under his arm.

"Goodbye to the game, all the spoils the adrenaline rush. Thank you basketball, I owe you everything," Crawford said with a two-finger peace sign emoji.

The lithe 6-foot-5 Seattle native earned the nickname "J-Crossover" for his electrifying ball-handling skills and passes, and stunning streetball-style one-on-one scoring moves which awed spectators and made him a viral sensation.

The 42-year-old Crawford averaged 14.6 points, 3.4 assists, 2.2 rebounds, 0.9 steals in 1327 games played, 433 of them as a starter. He shot 41.8% field goal percentage and 86.2% of his free throws.

After he was drafted by the Chicago Bulls as a one-and-done player out of Michigan in 2000, Crawford played on nine different teams until 2020.

Crawford has stints with the New York Knicks, Golden State Warriors, Atlanta Hawks, Portland Trail Blazers, Los Angeles Clippers, Minnesota Timberwolves, the Suns on a one-year deal for the 2018-19 season, then joined the Brooklyn Nets as a COVID-19 replacement player in July 2020 at the NBA bubble in Orlando.

He never won a championship, but former journeyman is part of an elite company in several statistical categories, including ones unto himself.

Crawford is the eighth player in league history to play at least 20 NBA seasons, along with Vince Carter, Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Willis, Hall of Famers Kevin Garnett, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Kobe Bryant.

During Crawford's final game with the Suns in their loss and final regular season game at Dallas Mavericks on April 9, 2019, he rained on Nowitzki's farewell game parade by scoring 51 points.

That performance reached three milestones: at 39 years old, he became the oldest player to score more than 50 points since Michael Jordan's 51 at age 38 in December 2001; the only player to reach the 50-point mark with four different teams; the most points ever scored by a reserve player.

Crawford and Atlanta Hawks guard Lou Williams are the only players to win the Sixth Man award three times.

Crawford holds the most four-point plays (54; not including his five in the postseason), he's eighth all-time in 3s made (2221), and he's second all-time in points off the bench (11,279) behind Williams (13,373), per StatMuse.
