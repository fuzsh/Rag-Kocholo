The Eleventh Street Bridge Project replaced the existing twin bridges that carry I-295 over the Anacostia River in the southeast quadrant of the District of Columbia. Three new bridges were constructed and improvements were made to the interchanges at both ends, including adding missing movements to and from the north onto the Anacostia Freeway (I-295/DC 295).

The two-phase project has:

Improved mobility by providing separate freeway and local traffic connections to both directions of DC 295, the Southeast-Southwest Freeway (I-295/I-395), and local streets on both sides of the river

Provided a shared bicycle and pedestrian path, as well as rails to allow future streetcar connections

Replaced functionally deficient and structurally obsolete bridges

Provided additional evacuation routes from the nation's capital

Included new trail connections, improved drainage, and other environmental investments

Phase 1 included the three bridges and most of the amenities described above. Phase 2 further improved the connection between the Southeast-Southwest Freeway and Virginia Ave. SE with the new outbound 11th Street Freeway Bridge.

Phase 1 construction began December 2009 and was completed in July 2013.

Phase 2 construction started in July 2012 and was completed in September 2015.
