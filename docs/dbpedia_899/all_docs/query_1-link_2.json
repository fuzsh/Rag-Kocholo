        "text": "Historic; segregation line\n\nAnacostia Park was a segregated park, with what is now the 11th St. Bridge serving as the segregation line. North of the bridge was the White section, with a golf course, pool, and many fields and courts. South of the Bridge was the Black section, a much smaller area with only courts and fields. Anacostia Park during this time was a clear representation of the failure of “separate but equal”. Segregation in Anacostia Park ended in 1949.\n\nThe 11th Street Bridge first opened in 1965. Its construction coincided with the Interstate Highway System introduced by President Eisenhower. DC followed the trend of improved urban planning and infrastructure happening nationwide. In 2009, the bridge underwent a major renovation almost 50 years since its initial construction. The DC Department of Transportation (DDOT) replaced the bridge. At the time, it was the most expensive project they ever completed with an estimated cost of over $450 million dollars. This bridge is one of several bridges that connect DC on the east and west sides of the Anacostia River. From the bridge, it overlooks Anacostia Park to the north and south. It is where the political boundary lines for DC wards 6 and 8 meet. The bridge is 931 feet in length. On the eastern side of the bridge, 11th street ends and becomes Martin Luther King Avenue."
