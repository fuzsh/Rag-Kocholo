The following areas of planning, programming, and performance-based decision making have been addressed: Condition and performance measures that are used to define policy goals and perfor-â¢ mance targets for the bridge program Methods of establishing funding levels and identifying bridge needsâ¢ Methods and organizational responsibilities for resource allocation between the â¢ bridge program versus competing needs in other programs (pavement, safety, etc.) Methods of allocation among districts and selection and prioritization of projectsâ¢ The role of automated bridge management systems (BMS) in planning, program-â¢ ming, resource allocation, and budgeting Use of economic methods in bridge managementâ¢ Methods to promote accountability and communication of the status of the bridge â¢ inventory and the bridge program. The study has also considered recent trends and events that could influence future bridge program management. Several state departments of transportation (DOTs) that were interviewed for this study described ongoing, leading-edge enhancements of their bridge management processes and systems that provide examples for other agencies to apply in the future. The increasing application of asset management principles among state DOTs is another such influence, encompassing bridges, pavements, and a growing set of other transportation assets. Several actions following the collapse of the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis in August 2007 also promise to reshape bridge management practices in the future, with increasing emphasis on program performance, federal oversight and account- ability, inspection qualifications and procedures, use of innovative inspection technology, and research needs to improve BMSs, procedures, and technology. Information on these topics was gathered through a review of literature on U.S. and international bridge management, a survey of U.S. and Canadian agency bridge manage- ment practices and assessments, and 15 in-depth interviews with state DOT executives and bridge managers. Twenty U.S. agencies and four Canadian agencies responded to the survey. Bridge management in the United States has taken major strides in the past 40 years, with significant accomplishments at the federal and state levels. The National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS), which were implemented in the 1970s, established a single, unified method of collecting data on the nationâs public-highway bridges. These data are submitted annually by state DOTs to the FHWA, which compiles them within the National Bridge Inventory database. The NBIS have enabled the FHWA and state DOTs to monitor bridge condition and performance nationally on a consistent basis, identify bridge needs,\n\n2 define criteria of project eligibility for federal bridge funding, and thereby promote pub- lic safety through better stewardship of bridge assets. Following the implementation of the NBIS, substantial advances have occurred in bridge management at the national and state levels. Today, all state DOTs have a bridge management process. Most employ some type of automated BMS with an associated database of bridge-related information, including NBIS data and ratings, but often incorporating more detailed element-level data or additional, customized data. State DOTs differ in their specific procedures for bridge program-related management, funding, and resource allocation. This variability is driven by several factors, among them (1) different philosophies of bridge management; (2) different approaches to planning, program- ming, and budgeting; (3) the characteristics of each agencyâs transportation system and its infrastructure; and (4) the policy, financial, technical, and institutional environment in which each agency operates. Despite the diversity of their practices, agencies that were addressed in this study appear to have integrated their bridge management procedures and systems well within their individual planning, resource allocation, programming, and budgeting pro- cesses. Philosophies of bridge management may contrast across agencies (e.g., centralized vs. decentralized decision making; use vs. nonuse of prediction models to forecast bridge network condition). Nonetheless, in each case that was studied in this synthesis, the agency has configured its bridge program management to fit within its organizational, financial, managerial, and technical modes of operation. It has tailored its internal communications of information, as well as its institutional relationships with other agencies, accordingly. In interviews conducted under this study, state DOTs stressed the importance of repeated consultations to seek agreement between central office and district personnel, regardless of which management approach they used. In many agencies, the management style is mixed, with centralized techniques often applying to bridge replacement and rehabilitation [i.e., projects that are eligible for federal Highway Bridge Program (HBP) funding], and more decentralized responsibility typically applying to bridge maintenance and repair (i.e., proj- ects tending to be funded more often by state money). Decisions thus flow both top down and bottom up. Even in decentralized organizations, the central office often handles major bridge projects and may retain responsibility for bridges on âtrunk lineâ or âbackboneâ networks that have statewide significance. Further insight into the decision-influencing role of bridge management may be gained by considering how agencies use their BMS. The systems vary in analytic capabilities and sophistication, ranging from straightforward repositories of bridge data to full-fledged man- agement systems that include such tools as forecasting models, comparative analyses (sce- nario testing), and optimization procedures or decision rules. Full-featured systems operate at both the program or network level and at the level of individual bridges or projects. Those agencies that have a full-featured BMS thus have the ability to apply higher-end analyses such as project planning, network-level budget scenarios, trade-off analyses, and economic analyses of agency and user costs and benefits. However, the actual use of these capabilities is by no means a given. As a general statement, BMS capabilities are underutilized, a situa- tion that has been observed by other studies as well for at least 10 years. For example, many agenciesâincluding those with sophisticated productsâuse their BMS solely to manage bridge inspection data. Those agencies that have applied more advanced functionality may still take advantage of only a subset of available features. To establish a benchmark for the current state of practice, interviews were conducted in this study with agencies that do use virtually the full set of available BMS features, including economic analyses and scenario testing. These DOTs might thus be viewed as leading-edge BMS practitioners. In addition to using a full set of BMS capabilities, several of them try to understand bridge program investments in a broad contextâfor example, considering impacts on different classes of road users and effects on local economic situations.\n\n3 More generally, however, the characteristic use of BMSs for state DOT decision making is toward more limited ends, including the following: Compilation and display of current and near-term information rather than long-term â¢ analyses A focus on technical results such as bridge condition and performance rather than â¢ also considering economic comparisons of benefits and costs A preference for straightforward calculations and analyses, including database man-â¢ agement and computations of bridge ratings and indexes, rather than more sophis- ticated modeling such as forecasting, scenario analyses, trade-off analyses, and optimization. Likely components of agenciesâ databases regarding bridge condition and performance include the results of their bridge inspection program and computed NBIS ratingsâStruc- tural Deficiency, Functional Obsolescence, and Sufficiency Rating. Agencies may also define custom measures of condition or performance to reflect local bridge, traffic, and transportation system characteristics. Many DOTs reserve more comprehensive, sophis- ticated, long-term analyses for major bridge projects. In considering applications more broadly to the entire bridge network, these types of analyses tend to be the purview of the subset of agencies that routinely employs more advanced BMS features, as discussed earlier. An important way to adapt bridge management to an agencyâs business and decision processes is through customizationâthe ability to define new BMS data, performance measures, analytic procedures, and reports. Among agencies that were interviewed in this study, these customizations are important to ensuring that bridge management information remains relevant to agency decisions across all affected organizational units and levels. In particular, customized performance measures such as deficiency-point calculations and custom bridge health indexes in several cases were believed to be critical to advancing state-specific practices technically, managerially, and procedurally. These new indicators were supported and used by upper management and served bridge-office as well as execu- tive-level informational needs for investment planning, resource allocation, and budgeting. Some agencies also saw customized bridge rating indexes as a way to get better guidance on bridge investment needs and benefits, to compensate for what they believed were short- comings in the Sufficiency Rating as a criterion for bridge replacement and rehabilitation. Organizational responsibilities for decision making vary to some degree by agency, but the following statements generally hold. An agencyâs bridge office is substantially involved in all programming decisions that deal specifically with bridges, but this author- ity is shared with other groups within and outside the agency. For example, major bridge projects involve strong participation by agency executives and, in some states, the oversight transportation board or commission. Regional and local officials will also be involved for major bridge projects in urban areas. Local bridge programs engage important roles by local and regional bodies together with the state agencyâs local or municipal assistance office. Districts (or regions or divisions) generally have a strong say in decisions involving all categories of bridge projects within their jurisdictions, including local, state owned, and major bridges. One programming decision for which the bridge unit does not have a dominant role among reporting agencies is in the allocation of resources among competing agency pro- grams: bridge versus pavement, safety, maintenance, and so on. Leadership on this deci- sion is seen either as an executive-level function, with transportation board or commission involvement as well in several states, or as a broader departmental decision involving units such as planning, investment management, policy and strategy, project management, and (in a Canadian province) the director of highway design and construction. In two of the\n\n4 states responding to the survey, this decision is decentralized, with program allocations made by districts. In some states, this decision may be moot if bridge funding is allocated âoff the topâ or is reserved in a noncompeting set-aside. Even with off-the-top or set-aside bridge program funding, however, resource allocation may present issues if the total amount of bridge funding has remained level or declined over time and is now significantly less than current bridge needs. Agencies use economic methods to varying degrees in bridge management, but overall, the practices do not represent wide use. Common examples of applications to individual structures include the use of benefit-cost analysis for major bridge projects, and life-cycle cost comparisons of rehabilitation versus replacement options for specific structures. Agen- cies that have full-featured BMSs are more likely to employ economic analyses in network- level bridge management, but the practice is not yet widespread; also, some agencies may have reservations about the transparency of these analytic procedures or disagreements with the methodsâ assumptions. FHWA division offices have encouraged greater use of economic analyses in bridge management, and several agencies interviewed in this study plan to apply such analyses to a greater degree in the future. Several factors that have been identified in this synthesis project point to coming changes in bridge program management, including likely revisions to the NBIS specifically. These factors will shape how advances in bridge management practices, systems, and informa- tion will inform future investment and resource allocation decisions. Although these factors are still evolving and their outcomes are not yet determined, it appears likelyâbased on the numerous and significant federal and state actions that are described in this reportâ that changes will occur in state DOT bridge inspection and condition assessment, bridge program management, and application of the NBIS. It also appears likely that federal (i.e., FHWA) oversight of these activities, and particularly over the correction of structurally defi- cient and functionally obsolete bridges, may be strengthened. There may also be a greater focus on accountability to relate funding to performance, quality assurance, quality con- trol, and increased compliance reporting among state DOTs, the FHWA, the U.S.DOT, and Congress. Potential influences on future management practices stem in part from ongoing activities such as BMS enhancements by selected state DOTs, which advance the state of the art to the benefit of peer agenciesâfor example, customized additions or improvements in BMS data and database processing, new bridge condition and performance indexes, and custom BMS models to estimate near-term and long-term impacts of bridge investments. Other influences on future practice derive from activities such as state DOT, TRB, and FHWA participation in several recent peer exchanges on ways to improve asset management through better plan- ning, programming, budgeting, and use of data and information. Still other activities have identified and reinforced exemplary methods in infrastructure managementâfor example, a U.S. domestic scan on best practices in asset management, and an FHWA initiative on systemwide bridge preservation. The collapse of the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis in August 2007 catalyzed a number of more far-reaching, national-level influences on future directions in bridge program manage- ment. It should be noted that the causes of the I-35W collapse and the completion of the sub- sequent bridge replacement project were not within the scope of work of this study and have not been addressed in this report. However, this tragedy launched several actions that may significantly enhance and refocus bridge program management and the NBIS, specifically. These factors, which are summarized here, are discussed in chapter four: A comprehensive review of the NBIS that is now being conducted by the U.S.DOTâs â¢ Office of the Inspector General. This three-phased review will consider (1) FHWAâs progress in meeting previous recommendations for oversight of structurally deficient\n\n5 bridges nationwide, (2) state DOT use of federal bridge funding to correct struc- tural deficiencies, and (3) FHWA oversight of the safety of National Highway System (NHS) bridges nationwide. Public reaction following the I-35W bridge failure, which indicated confusion over â¢ the meaning of âstructural deficiencyâ and its implications for bridge condition and public safety. Changes in HBP procedures and criteria that were proposed in congressional testi-â¢ mony. State DOT executives, some of whom represented both their respective depart- ments and AASHTO, recommended several updates to federal HBP decision making and to how the NBIS sufficiency and deficiency ratings are applied as program crite- ria. Hallmarks of this testimony included proposals for greater flexibility in program funding decisions and greater reliance on systematic, data-driven, performance-based methods in lieu of arbitrary criteria. Several other aspects of federal and state bridge program funding were also covered, as were topics of bridge inspection, innovative inspection technology, materials performance, and research needs. A recent U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the federal HBP, â¢ the data and techniques available for bridge management, and results to date in cor- recting structurally deficient bridges. The GAO recommended several actions: (1) to define the national goals of the HBP, (2) to determine HBP performance in relation to these goals, (3) to identify and evaluate bridge management best practices that can improve HBP performance, and (4) to investigate ways to align HBP funding more closely with performance, supporting a more focused and sustainable federal bridge program. Legislation now before Congress that will affect the future practice and technol-â¢ ogy of bridge management. Current bills before the House and Senate define several actions to be undertaken by federal and state agencies with respect to bridge program management and resource allocation. Although provisions of these bills are subject to further congressional deliberation, if passed substantially in their current form they will mandate a number of items, for example, (1) state DOT use of BMSs; (2) establishment of state 5-year performance plans for bridge inspections and correc- tion of structurally deficient and functionally obsolete bridges, with such plans to be approved by the FHWA; (3) enhancements of the national bridge inspection program with specific requirements for dealing with critical findings and for strengthening inspection team training and qualifications; and (4) a number of other provisions.\n\n6 particular statutory, political, or financial requirements. Most agencies use a computerized tool, a bridge manage- ment system (BMS), to manage and process relevant data and to provide analytical support for bridge program decisions. Again, the particular BMS products agencies use can differ, and even the same product may vary in its details among agencies in how it is customized and applied. The familiarity of upper management with the assumptions, data, and con- ventions of bridge management, and with the capability of their agencyâs BMS, may also vary among agencies. DOTs would like to understand how their peers apply and benefit from their bridge management processes and systems when making resource allocation decisions. MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVES A DOTâs upper management and its bridge managers are involved in bridge program decisions. However, these two groups bring different responsibilities, perspectives, and cri- teria to their respective roles regarding resource allocation as it affects the bridge program. The DOT chief executive offi- cer (CEO) and his or her senior management team provide executive leadership to the agency. They: Translate federal and state public policy and regula-â¢ tions into agency objectives, procedural requirements, and performance targets Set strategic priorities for the agencyâ¢ Understand and provide strategic direction regarding â¢ interactions among federal and local governments and the state DOT Provide guidance and oversee decisions on the depart-â¢ mentâs long-range transportation plan, the Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP), budget development, and resource allocation, including: Meeting short-term and long-term projections of â needs Addressing uncertainties in the projections of eco- â nomic and demographic shifts, traffic volume and composition, and revenue streams from different sources Accounting for geographic equity considerations â in the balancing of needs; that is, resource alloca- tions among districts, regions, or other geographic subdivisions CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION BACKGROUND Bridges are one of the most visible and important compo- nents of a transportation system. By providing crossings at critical locations, bridges maintain network continuity, traversing natural and manmade features that otherwise would add significant travel time and cost. Designing, building, maintaining, repairing, and replacing bridges involve critical investment decisions for agencies because of the high cost of these investments, the need to sustain an appropriate level of investment throughout the consid- erable life of a bridge, and the important structural and functional implications of the selected investments. Agen- cies therefore try to get these investments right, both to minimize life-cycle cost (LCC) and to provide safe and efficient mobility to transportation system users. Agencies must at the same time account for the revenue stream that is available to fund transportation programs, the project eligibility rules and degree of flexibility afforded by dif- ferent funding sources, and the competition between the bridge program and other transportation needs for the lim- ited dollars available. Decision making regarding the funding of state and pro- vincial bridge programs occurs at different organizational levels within departments of transportation (DOTs). The ways in which these decisions are reached, and with what data, depend on an agencyâs philosophy and approach to bridge management as well as broader processes for long- range planning, revenue projection, capital and maintenance programming, and budgeting. These more broad-based functions set the levels of investment and the allocation of resources among agency programs, geographic districts or regions, and support activities. This synthesis study was motivated by a desire among DOTs to understand how their peer agencies conduct bridge management, and how this information supports upper-management decisions affect- ing the bridge program. All state DOTs (for brevity, âstateâ will be understood in this report to refer to both âstateâ and âprovincialâ unless noted otherwise) have a bridge management process in place. Later chapters will show that this process can vary consider- ably from one agency to another. There is no single âmodelâ process. These variations may reflect management philoso- phy and culture; they may also be pragmatic responses to\n\n7 Recommend a bridge program, implement the approved â¢ bridge program, and conduct or manage delivery of required bridge work. These management perspectives relate to each other through an agencyâs business processes, illustrated schemat- ically in Figure 1. These business processes comprise top- down and bottom-up communications throughout the year in support of ongoing system management and performance monitoring, as well as for project selection, prioritization, and program trade-offs during the agencyâs budgeting cycle. Figure 1 is useful as an idealized illustration, recognizing that actual agency practices show considerable variability in, for example, centralized versus decentralized decision making, procedures and criteria for planning and program- ming, the sequence of top-down and bottom-up actions in proposing candidate bridge projects through final program recommendations, and resulting demands for information at various organizational levels. Of primary concern to this study is the information that is transmitted from or by means of the bridge unit to the execu- tive level as part of building the agencyâs programs and bud- get, as shown in Figure 1. The adequacy of this information certainly depends on ensuring that its descriptions of bridge status, needs, and costs are complete, current, accurate, and timely. Other attributes, however, are also important to upper management, such as the ability to compare this information with corresponding submittals on competing programs, and to understand the implications of funding all or part of bridge needs at a level, or with a schedule, that may be different from what is requested. These potential trade- offs between bridge and other programs are also indicated in Figure 1. All of these processes and information flows take place within the context of federal and state funding avail- ability, governing regulations, agency procedural require- ments, interagency coordination, and public and stakeholder demands on the quality and level of service of their trans- portation system. STUDY OBJECTIVE AND FOCUS The objective of this synthesis is to document how bridge managementâits processes, analytic tools, and informa- tionâmeets the needs of upper management regarding their planning, programming, and resource allocation decisions. Although Figure 1 represents many individual functions, flows of information, and decision points, it is important to realize that significant variations exist among agencies in how these are handled and with what information. An agen- cyâs management approach and culture, organizational roles and responsibilities, and strength in information technology are factors in these differences, and are discussed in the syn- thesis findings when they have a significant influence. Balancing needs versus funding sources, account- â ing for dollar levels required versus available, and funding eligibility of programs and projects Monitor agency and transportation system perfor-â¢ mance, document accomplishments, and track prog- ress toward established targets Communicate with the governor, legislature, transpor-â¢ tation board or commission, other stakeholders, and the general public regarding agency plans, programs, projects, and accomplishments. Managers in the bridge unit at both central office and field levels (e.g., districts or regions) have responsibilities for the public highway bridge system within the state. Within the United States, state DOTs have certain responsibilities for bridges that are âon systemââthat is, owned and maintained by the DOTs as part of the state highway networkâand âoff systemââthat is, owned by local governments. Bridges on federal lands, privately owned bridges, and tribally owned bridges are excluded from state responsibility. Although bridge-related interactions between a DOT and local gov- ernments vary by state, at a minimum it is the state DOTâs responsibility to ensure the conduct of federally required biennial inspections of local bridges as well as of state- owned structures, and report to the FHWA the results of these inspections. Refer to chapter two for additional infor- mation on this biennial inspection program. Within this con- text, managers in a DOTâs bridge organizational unit: Conduct and assess biennial bridge inspections of on-â¢ system and off-system bridges in coordination with local governments Maintain and submit resulting inspection data to the â¢ FHWA, and compute and assess measures and trends of bridge condition and performance Identify and assess needs for work and their priorities â¢ that result from inspections and evaluations across several areas; for example, structural condition, func- tional performance, vulnerability to seismic damage and scour, potential security concerns, fracture-critical classification, and other circumstances Prioritize bridge projects according to agency criteria, â¢ which may include: Bridge structural condition and functional â performance Other aspects of bridge health, safety, deficiency, â and risk of failure National Bridge Inventory ratings (refer to chapter â two) Funding availability and eligibility requirements â Long-term bridge needs and a strategy for addressing â them as identified, for example, in the agencyâs long- term transportation plan or capital investment plan Design and manage bridge projects, including large, â¢ complex âmajor bridge projectsâ\n\n8 CEO, Senior Management Team with e.g., Planning, Programming, Financial Mgmt.

It has asked how their bridge management processes are applied to these decisions. Information has also been collected on future plans for upgrading and better utilizing bridge management processes. The focus has been on both funding allocations for bridges in competition with other agency programs, and allocations within the bridge program for replacement, rehabilitation, and maintenance needs throughout the state. The information that has been gathered falls into a number of categories based on specific items called for in the project scope of work, among them: An agencyâs â¢ overall approach to decision making on infrastructure investments The current â¢ state of practice of bridge management, including what factors are considered in the process, ongoing improvements by DOTs, and additional capa- bilities that are desired The â¢ organizational levels at which bridge program decisions are madeâthat is, who typically makes deci- sions in the following areas: infrastructure funding allocations; selection of performance measures; fund- ing splits among maintenance/repair, preservation/ rehabilitation, and replacement; and project selection Comparison of the â¢ information needed by senior deci- sion makers with that actually provided by the bridge management process/system Use of â¢ economic methods such as LCC and cost-ben- efit ratios by senior managers Standard reportsâ¢ provided to decision makers and other stakeholders, including the general public The extent to which senior decision makers rely on â¢ BMS outputs or subjective judgment from the bridge management process Suggested enhancementsâ¢ to existing bridge manage- ment processes and systems. The collapse of the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis in August 2007 brought several issues related to bridge man- agement and bridge funding into sharper relief. These issues include the need to understand better the current status of a bridge, the meaning of âstructural deficiencyâ and its implications for public safety and structure preservation, and the adequacy of existing bridge program funding levels and eligibility requirements. Wider implications have been recognized regarding the accuracy and reliability of bridge inspections, potential needs for new inspection technology and wider adoption of existing nondestructive evaluation techniques, and a need to reexamine the nationâs approach to assessing and reporting current bridge conditions. All of these issues have arisen in the context of more than 12% of the nationâs bridges being classified as structurally deficient, and a lack of understanding of this concept among the public as well as concern as to what to do about it. This synthesis deals with these issues to the extent that they relate to study objectives. This study is principally concerned with program- or net- work-level decision making. However, project-level concerns have not been ignored. For example, project prioritization and selection are critical steps in building a network-level program. Some agencies adopt an intermediate-level view of project definition and evaluation, in which bridge projects are considered and developed at a corridor or subnetwork level, consistent with the highway links they serve. Another example concerns budget allocations to major bridge proj- ects, which can cost hundreds of millions of dollars and therefore have network-level ramifications. Also, if the scope of a conventional bridge project changes, the funding avail- able for other projects within the program also adjusts, as may their schedules. Finally, a BMS may perform network- level calculations based on its project-level results. STUDY METHODOLOGY Information was gathered for this synthesis through a lit- erature review, a survey of state transportation agencies, and interviews with chief engineers and bridge section engineers. The literature review contributed to the narrative â¢ describing the development of bridge management practice over the past four decades. It established much of the general BMS state of practice and related toolsâ for example, specialized applications to optimize bridge investments and perform trade-off analyses. Survey questionnaires were sent to all the states and â¢ Canadian provinces. The survey included three parts: Part A, broadly covering the bridge management pro- cess and BMS; Part B, a budgeting component; and Part C, a planning component. The surveys were sent to agency bridge engineers, who were requested to dis- tribute the second and third parts to the heads of bud- geting and planning, respectively. Alternately, a bridge engineer who had the knowledge to do so had the option to complete all parts of the survey. The survey results are discussed in chapter three and are a key source of information on current agency practice. The complete survey questionnaire is included in Appendix A. Ten chief engineers were interviewed to obtain an â¢ executive perspective on bridge management and pro- vide insights on bridge program funding decisions as part of planning, programming, and budgeting. Five engineers in the bridge unit (e.g., state bridge engi- neers and bridge maintenance engineers) were inter- viewed to obtain specifics on how bridge management processes and BMS tools are used within their agen- cies, and how they saw these capabilities supporting upper-level managers in their decision making. Both\n\n10 sets of interviews were critical in elaborating on gen- eral themes identified in the literature and the survey responses. Interview results are also discussed in chap- ter three and are another key source explaining cur- rent practice. The guides for both sets of interviews are included in Appendix B. Participants in these inter- views as well as respondents to the survey are listed in Appendix C.

Table 1 tallies the questionnaires and responses in the study survey, in terms of both the number of overall questionnaires distributed and received and the specific numbers of results for each of the three parts of the ques- tionnaire. Not all agencies completed all parts of the survey. The numbers of useable statistical results were therefore less than the total number of responses. For Parts B and C (the Budgeting and Planning components, respectively), Table 1 also identifies the organizational position of the respondentsâthat is, whether Part B or Part C was com- pleted by the chief of budgeting or planning, respectively, or whether it was completed by the bridge engineer or a delegate. Chapter three presents the main survey results in graphic form as a series of charts. Numerical tallies of responses to these questions are included in Appendix D. Appendix E presents supporting survey results regarding factors that affect budgeting. Because the survey response rate was less than desired, several efforts were made to strengthen findings on current agency practice. Additional information was gained from the 15 interviews noted previously and from several other sourcesâfor example, comparison of Topic 37-07 survey findings with those of related NCHRP studies, proceedings of several recent peer exchanges, and congressional testi- mony regarding the condition of U.S. bridges, bridge safety, and funding adequacy. This supplementary information is reported in chapters three and four. OUTLINE OF REPORT Chapter two provides a brief history of the advancement of bridge management over the past four decades. It begins with the inception of the National Bridge Inspection Stan- dards (NBIS) and progresses to todayâs general state of bridge management practice. Chapter three evaluates how agencies apply their bridge management processes and their BMS specifically to agency decision making, focusing on the several stages of planning and programming that deal with resource allocation and project prioritization and selection. Definition of bridge program objectives and performance tracking against targets are also covered. Chapter four con- siders emerging trends that will affect bridge management practice, and potential research that could strengthen the application of bridge management to funding decisions. This compilation of research needs draws from the litera- ture review, interviews, and survey responses. Summaries of recent peer exchanges and of relevant items raised in recent congressional testimony are also included in this chapter. Chapter five concludes the report. The five appendixes are as follows: Appendix A, Survey Questionnaire; Appendix B, Interview Guides; Appendix C, Survey and Interviews Participants; Appendix D, Responses to Selected Survey Questions; and Appendix E, Survey Responses: Factors Affecting Budgeting.\n\n11 NATIONAL BRIDGE INSPECTION STANDARDS Overview NBIS came about in the aftermath of the collapse of the Silver Bridge over the Ohio River between Ohio and West Virginia in 1967 (FHWA and FTA 2002, Chapter 11). This failure, and the concerns it raised about bridge conditions nationally and their implications for public safety, resulted in congressional mandates to the U.S.DOT in 1970 to develop and implement national bridge inspection standards and procedures (P.L. 91-605). Subsequent federal surface trans- portation legislation during the next 35 years expanded the inspection requirements and authorized federal funding to bridge programs (FHWA and FTA 2004, Exhibit 15-1). NBIS requirements are issued as federal regulations (23 CFR Sub- part C Â§650.300) that are updated by the FHWA from time to time in a formal rulemaking process that is published in the Federal Register. The most recent NBIS update was in December 2004 (FHWA 2004). A core requirement of the NBIS is the biennial inspec- tion of all bridges and culverts greater than 20 ft in length on U.S. public roads. Bridges that have serious deficiencies are inspected more frequently, as required. Although select bridges that are in excellent condition and meet certain other criteria may be inspected at intervals longer than 2 years with prior FHWA approval, only a small percentage of bridges nationally, generally new bridges in excellent condition, meet these criteria. Most bridges in the United States are inspected at at least 2-year intervals, and the biennial inspec- tion requirement of NBIS is widely understood throughout the U.S. highway community. NBIS regulations also include other provisions; for example, the required qualifications of inspection staff. The practical guidelines for conducting NBIS-mandated bridge inspections are contained in a bridge recording and coding guide issued by the FHWA (1995). This guidebook includes instructions and examples for more than 125 entries to be recorded, together with coding forms. An overview of the items addressed in the inspection guidelines is as follows: Items 1â27: General description and administrative â¢ information Items 28â42: Functional or operational (capacity) â¢ information, design load Items 43â44: Structure/design/construction type and â¢ material of construction Items 45â56: Span information, geometric informa-â¢ tion, and clearance dimensions (no Item 57) Items 58â70: Structural condition and bridge loading â¢ information Items 71â72: Waterway and approach data (no Items â¢ 73â74) Items 75â97: Inspectorâs work recommendations and â¢ projected costs Items 98â116: Other information of various categoriesâ¢ Several items have multiple parts (A, B, C), which accounts for the more than 125 entries. Items relating to structural components and operational characteristics must be observed, assessed, and rated by cer- tified, trained inspectors. The FHWA Recording and Cod- ing Guide describes the alphanumeric codes that inspectors must use to rate each item. Rating systems for bridge condi- tion and structural and functional appraisals are recorded on a scale from 0 to 9 (summarized in the following sec- tions). The results of inspection ratings for all bridges on a statewide network, plus local bridges within the state, are reported annually by each state DOT to the FHWA, where they are compiled and processed within the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) database. The NBI database is the source of reports on national bridge statistics, including numbers and percentages of bridges that are âstructurally deficientâ or âfunctionally obsolete,â as explained later. The NBI database is also the source of data used by the FHWA in its biennial report on bridge conditions and performance to the Congress (e.g., FHWA and FTA 2006, chapter 3). NBI ratings are described in some detail here because they play a key role in federal bridge funding and state DOT track- ing of bridge condition and performance. They are referred to repeatedly in subsequent chapters as a key component of bridge management information. National Bridge Inventory Condition Ratings The following scale is used to rate bridge condition (FHWA 1995): CHAPTER TWO STATE OF PRACTICE IN BRIDGE MANAGEMENT\n\n12 2 = Basically intolerable, requiring a high priority â¢ of replacement 1 = This value of rating not used in appraisalsâ¢ 0 = Bridge closedâ¢ N = Not applicableâ¢ TABLE 2 NBI RATINGS FOR BRIDGE DECKS, SUPERSTRUCTURE, AND SUBSTRUCTURE Rating General Description of Condition 9 EXCELLENT CONDITION 8 VERY GOOD CONDITION: no problems noted. 7 GOOD CONDITION: some minor problems. 6 SATISFACTORY CONDITION: structural elements show some minor deterioration. 5 FAIR CONDITION: all primary structural elements are sound but may have minor section loss, cracking, spalling, or scour. 4 POOR CONDITION: advanced section loss, deteriora- tion, spalling, scour. 3 SERIOUS CONDITION: loss of section, deterioration, spalling, or scour have seriously affected primary struc- tural components. Local failures are possible. Fatigue cracks in steel or shear cracks in concrete may be present. 2 CRITICAL CONDITION: advanced deterioration of primary structural elements. Fatigue cracks in steel or shear cracks in concrete may be present or scour may have removed substructure support. Unless closely monitored, it may be necessary to close the bridge until corrective action is taken. 1 âIMMINENTâ FAILURE CONDITION: major deteri- oration or section loss present in critical structural com- ponents or obvious vertical or horizontal movement affecting structural stability. Bridge is closed to traffic but corrective action may put back in light service. 0 FAILED CONDITION: out of serviceâbeyond cor- rective action. N Not applicable. Source: FHWA 1995. Structural Deficiency and Functional Obsolescence The NBI ratings are used to compute two measures of defi- ciency in bridge condition and performance: Structural Deficiency (SD) and Functional Obsolescence (FO). These designations are important because (1) they call attention to important bridge structural or functional needs; (2) they shape the publicâs and stakeholdersâ perceptions of bridge condition and performance that are obtained from annual statistical summaries of NBI data and the biennial bridge Conditions and Performance report to Congress; and (3) they are part of the discussions of bridge program funding at federal, state, and local levels. 9 = Excellentâ¢ 8 = Very Goodâ¢ 7 = Goodâ¢ 6 = Satisfactoryâ¢ 5 = Fairâ¢ 4 = Poorâ¢ 3 = Seriousâ¢ 2 = Criticalâ¢ 1 = âImminentâ Failureâ¢ 0 = Failureâ¢ N = Not Applicableâ¢ For example, the condition of new, well-constructed bridges would be taken as 9. Ratings from 8 to 6 would characterize generally good performance, with only minor problems. Ratings from 5 to 3 are intended as warnings of growing problems that require action, whether (1) mainte- nance, rehabilitation, or replacement; (2) posting of load limits to prohibit heavy vehicles; or (3) increased frequency of inspection. Some agencies assign âflagsâ to these ratings to highlight these warnings for managers. Ratings of 2 or 1 are critical and call for immediate action, including possible bridge closure. A rating of 0 denotes a failed bridge that is out of service and cannot be repaired. N means that the par- ticular item is not applicable to that bridge. These general descriptions introduce the rating scale; the actual inspec- tion and rating process uses more specific definitions and explanations that are tailored to particular inspection items. For example, Table 2 gives rating definitions for Inspection items 58-Bridge Decks, 59-Superstructure, and 60-Sub- structure. For comparison, Table 3 lists rating definitions for item 62, Culverts. National Bridge Inventory Appraisal Ratings Appraisal ratings differ from the condition ratings. Appraisal items evaluate the level of service provided by a bridge to the highway it serves, as compared with that of a new bridge built to current design standards that are now applicable to that highway. Appraisals can apply to structural as well as functional items. Unlike condition ratings that are recorded by an inspector, appraisal items are computed by FHWAâs NBI Edit/Update Program based on values of two or more other NBI rating items. The rating scale for appraisals is as follows (FHWA 1995): 9 = Superior to present desirable criteriaâ¢ 8 = Equal to present desirable criteriaâ¢ 7 = Better than present minimum criteriaâ¢ 6 = Equal to present minimum criteriaâ¢ 5 = Somewhat better than minimum adequacy to â¢ tolerate being left in place as is 4 = Meets basic minimum tolerable limits to be left â¢ in place as is 3 = Basically intolerable, requiring a high priority â¢ of corrective action\n\n13 rated poor or worse. The structural rating items used to eval- uate bridge deficiency are listed in Table 4. The conditions of bridge structures are rated using Items 58â60; the condition of culverts more than 20 ft in length are rated by Item 62. The criteria for poor or worse are also shown in Table 4 in terms of NBI rating values. The implications of this rating approach are that (1) a designation of SD may be triggered by any one of the items in Table 4, (2) a bridge rated as SD does not differentiate whether only one or many items in Table 4 were rated poor, and (3) an SD classification does not convey the causes of the poor ratings. Recent congressional testi- mony has described, for example, how poor ratings might result from deficiencies that do not reflect overall bridge structural integrity (Bizjak 2007; Kerley 2007, p. 7). SD is thus a coarse measure. SD signals a bridge problem requir- ing further attention, but in and of itself does not communi- cate details of the causes or implications of poor rating(s). TABLE 4 STRUCTURAL DEFICIENCY CRITERIA NBI Rating Item Number Structural Item Rated Type of Rating Criterion for Poor or Worse 58 Deck rating Condition <5 59 Superstructure rating Condition <5 60 Substructure rating Condition <5 62 Culvert rating Condition <5 67 Structural evaluation Appraisal <3 71 Waterway adequacy Appraisal <3 Note: FHWA and FTA 2006. The FHWA has observed that the primary reason to clas- sify bridges as structurally deficient is a low condition rating. Eighty percent of structurally deficient bridges nationwide are so classified because of their condition ratings; 20%, because of their appraisals (FHWA and FTA 2006). The two are not mutually exclusiveâthat is, a bridge may be defi- cient in both its condition rating and its appraisal. Functional Obsolescence An inspected bridge is functionally obsolete ifâ it is â¢ not already structurally deficient; and it is deficient in terms of its geometry, clearance, or â¢ load capacity. The NBI rating items that are considered when determin- ing FO and the criteria used to determine whether an item is deficient are shown in Table 5. With one exception, these TABLE 3 NBI RATINGS FOR CULVERTS Rating General Description of Condition 9 No deficiencies. 8 No noticeable or noteworthy deficiencies that affect the condition of the culvert. Insignificant scrape marks caused by drift. 7 Shrinkage cracks, light scaling, and insignificant spall- ing that does not expose reinforcing steel. Insignificant damage caused by drift with no misalignment and not requiring corrective action. Some minor scouring has occurred near curtain walls, wingwalls, or pipes. Metal culverts have a smooth symmetrical curvature with superficial corrosion and no pitting. 6 Deterioration or initial disintegration, minor chloride contamination, cracking with some leaching, or spalls on concrete or masonry walls and slabs. Local minor scouring at curtain walls, wingwalls, or pipes. Metal culverts have a smooth curvature, nonsymmetrical shape, significant corrosion, or moderate pitting. 5 Moderate to major deterioration or disintegration, extensive cracking and leaching, or spalls on concrete or masonry walls and slabs. Minor settlement or mis- alignment. Noticeable scouring or erosion at curtain walls, wingwalls, or pipes. Metal culverts have signifi- cant distortion and deflection in one section, significant corrosion, or deep pitting. 4 Large spalls, heavy scaling, wide cracks, considerable efflorescence, or opened construction joint permitting loss of backfill. Considerable settlement or misalign- ment. Considerable scouring or erosion at curtain walls, wingwalls, or pipes. Metal culverts have signifi- cant distortion and deflection throughout, extensive corrosion, or deep pitting. 3 Any condition described in Code 4 but which is exces- sive in scope. Severe movement or differential settle- ment of the segments, or loss of fill. Holes may exist in walls or slabs. Integral wingwalls nearly severed from culvert. Severe scour or erosion at curtain walls, wing- walls, or pipes. Metal culverts have extreme distortion and deflection in one section, extensive corrosion, or deep pitting with scattered perforations. 2 Integral wingwalls collapsed; severe settlement of roadway due to loss of fill. Section of culvert may have failed and can no longer support embankment. Com- plete undermining at curtain walls and pipes. Correc- tive action required to maintain traffic. Metal culverts have extreme distortion and deflection throughout with extensive perforations due to corrosion. 1 Bridge closed. Corrective action may put back in light service. 0 Bridge closed. Replacement necessary. N Not applicableâused if structure is not a culvert. Source: FHWA 1995. Structural Deficiency An inspected bridge is structurally deficient if at least one structural rating item, whether condition or appraisal, is\n\n14 Special Reductions, Sâ¢ 4 â a deduction from SR, maxi- mum absolute value = 13 Each of these rating components is defined here. Figure 2 provides a graphic representation of these SR components. Note that the structural and the functional components of SR, S1, and S2, respectively, are different from SD and FO in the preceding section. FIGURE 2 Sufficiency rating components (Source: FHWA 1995). Note: Obs. = Obsolescence; Rdwy. = Roadway; STRAHNET = Strategic Highway Network. Structural Adequacy and Safety,â¢ S1, is a function of the following rating items: Item 59, Superstructure; â Item 60, Substructure; â Item 62, Culverts; and â Item 66, Inventory rating (a measure of load â capacity). Serviceability and FO,â¢ S2, is a function of the follow- ing rating items: Item 28, Number of lanes on the structure; â Item 29, Average daily traffic (ADT); â Item 32, Approach roadway width; â Item 43, Structure type, main; â Item 51, Bridge roadway width; â Item 53, Vertical clearance over deck; â Item 58, Deck condition; â Item 67, Structural evaluation (a function of load â capacity); Item 68, Deck geometry; â Item 69, Underclearance; â Item 71, Waterway adequacy; â appraisal items are all computed from other NBI item ratings by the NBI Edit/Update Program. TABLE 5 FUNCTIONAL OBSOLESCENCE CRITERIA NBI Rating Item Number Functional Item Rated Criterion for Poor or Worse 67 Structural evaluation (function of load capacity) =3 68 Deck geometry <4 69 Underclearance (over highway) <4 71 Waterway adequacy =3 72 Approach roadway alignment <4 Note: FHWA and FTA 2006. Rating items 67 and 71 overlap the structural and func- tional evaluations (see Tables 4 and 5). If either of these rat- ings equals 3, then the bridge is not considered structurally deficient, because the problem can still be corrected (refer to the definition of the nine-point appraisal scale mentioned earlier). However, because a rating of 3 implies that bridge load capacity or waterway adequacy is too low to be toler- able, the bridge is characterized as functionally obsolete. If either of these ratings falls below 3, the bridge is considered structurally deficient (FHWA and FTA 2006). Item 72, Approach Roadway Alignment, is an excep- tion to the explanation of appraisal items described earlier. Rather than comparing this alignment with current design standards, the existing approach alignment is compared with the existing bridge alignment. Ratings are assigned based on the ability of the two alignments, functioning together, to permit traffic to enter the bridge without significant speed reduction. If a bridgeâs ratings are such that it is both structurally deficient and functionally obsolete, it is reported in the NBI database as structurally deficient. SD takes precedence over FO in reporting bridge status. A bridge is listed as function- ally obsolete only if it is not structurally deficient. Sufficiency Rating The Sufficiency Rating (SR) ranges from a value of 100 (best) to 0 (worst). It includes four rating components (FHWA 1995): Structural Adequacy and Safety, Sâ¢ 1 â maximum value = 55 Serviceability and FO, Sâ¢ 2 â maximum value = 30 Essentiality for Public Use, Sâ¢ 3 â maximum value = 15\n\n15 functional classes, traffic levels, and construction materials. The requirement for state DOTs, working with local govern- ments, to inspect bridges periodically and submit NBI data to the FHWA annually ensures a nationwide consistency of method, a wide familiarity with NBI data and ratings, and a comprehensive, up-to-date database. NBI bridge ratings are specified at an aggregate level of structural component and are analytically simple. These characteristics are advantages in that they enable the NBIS to apply to a numerous and diverse nationwide bridge population. Because the approach depends on the skill and training of the certified bridge inspectors, this factor is addressed in detail in the federal regulations that govern the NBIS (23 CFR 650C). The FHWA has updated the NBIS rating items from time to time to address new prob- lemsâfor example, the need for underwater inspections to protect bridges from scour, and the identification and need for inspection of fracture-critical members that, if degraded, could make the bridge vulnerable to further structural dam- age. Since its inception in the 1970s, the NBI database has compiled a detailed history of every bridge carrying a public highway in the United States, making it the most comprehen- sive and uniformly organized source of bridge condition data in the country. The NBI data are the basis of FHWAâs identifi- cation of bridge needs, allocation of bridge program funding, and biennial reporting to Congress. The NBI database and the computed SD, FO, and SR rat- ings have provided current and comprehensive data on bridge status and investment needs during the last 35 years. Today, however, the deficiency and sufficiency ratings are recog- nized to have shortcomings when applied to management or funding decisions. This chapter covers those shortcomings related to how the NBI ratings are formulated. Chapter three discusses how DOTs are working to compensate for short- comings in NBI-rating decision support. Chapter four recaps key issues regarding NBI deficiency and sufficiency ratings that were presented in recent congressional testimony. These various concerns can be summarized as follows: The SD and FO ratings are coarse: Although they signal â¢ a potential problem, they do not distinguish between single versus multiple causes or their possible impacts, as discussed earlier. The SD, FO, and SR ratings are reactive; that is, they â¢ do not signal a bridge problem until it has already occurred. Moreover, they do not show an improved bridge condition unless corrective or remedial work is done. They are therefore unsuited to preventive maintenance strategies that could prevent or forestall bridge damage before it occurs and that could be more economical. The weights and formulas used to compute SRs are â¢ fixed and may be arbitrary as bridge designs, con- struction materials, vehicle loads, bridge investment strategies and priorities, and other factors continue to evolve. Item 72, Approach roadway alignment; and â Item 100, STRAHNET (Strategic Highway â Network) Designation (a network comprising about 61,000 miles, including the Interstate system, to serve national defense needs). Essentiality for Public Use,â¢ S3, is a function of the ratings of the following bridge items: Item 19, Detour length; â Item 29, ADT; and â Item 100, STRAHNET Highway Designation. â Special Reductions,â¢ S4, are a function of the ratings of items listed here. A Special Reduction is applied only when S1 + S2 + S3 â¥ 50; otherwise S4 = 0. Relevant bridge items are: Item 19, Detour length; â Item 36, Traffic safety features; and â Item 43, Structure type, main. â The rating components S1 through S4 are computed by a set of analytic procedures in the NBI database as a function of the respective NBI ratings listed earlier (FHWA 1995). The SR is the total of S1 through S4: SR = S1 + S2 + S3 â S4, where S4 represents a deduction. When all the NBI ratings listed earlier for S1, S2, and S3 are at their maximum (best possible) value, SR = S1 + S2 + S3 = 100, assuming S4 = 0. As bridge structural, functional, or public use ratings decline, the values of S1, S2, and S3 decline from their maximum val- ues and SR < 100. By correcting structural problems, defi- cient geometry, or other problems represented in the rating items, bridge projects can restore SR to a higher value. With- out any corrective measures, SR theoretically will continue to decline to its minimum (zero) value, at which point the bridge is no longer in service. If a bridge has an attribute that causes a Special Reductionâfor example, a long detour routeâits SR can never be at the theoretical maximumâ that is, SR < 100 even when the bridge is new. Implications for Bridge Management and Program Funding The NBI measures of SD, FO, and SR are important to bridge management and to federal funding of bridge pro- grams. The FHWA lists the number and percentage of SD and FO bridges on its website, and many agencies track these measures as key indicators of the success of their bridge pro- grams. Table 6 gives these statistics for each state as of 2007, including bridges on National Highway System (NHS) as well as non-NHS highways. NBI Ratings as Performance Indicators The NBIS system of coding and recording bridge condition was designed to apply to the entire public highway bridge inventory in the United States. The NBI database currently includes almost 600,000 bridges of various designs, highway\n\n16 TABLE 6 NBI STATISTICS ON BRIDGE DEFICIENCY, 2007 No. of Bridges No. of SD No. of FO No. SD or FO Percent SD or FO Alabama 15,881 1,899 2,158 4,057 25.5% Alaska 1,229 155 179 334 27.2% Arizona 7,348 181 600 781 10.6% Arkansas 12,531 997 1,908 2,905 23.2% California 24,184 3,140 3,837 6,977 28.8% Colorado 8,366 580 824 1,404 16.8% Connecticut 4,175 358 1,042 1,400 33.5% Delaware 857 20 112 132 15.4% Dist. of Columbia 245 24 128 152 62.0% Florida 11,663 302 1,692 1,994 17.1% Georgia 14,563 1,028 1,888 2,916 20.0% Hawaii 1,115 142 358 500 44.8% Idaho 4,104 349 452 801 19.5% Illinois 25,998 2,501 1,840 4,341 16.7% Indiana 18,494 2,030 2,004 4,034 21.8% Iowa 24,776 5,153 1,455 6,608 26.7% Kansas 25,461 2,991 2,372 5,363 21.1% Kentucky 13,637 1,362 2,928 4,290 31.5% Louisiana 13,342 1,780 2,180 3,960 29.7% Maine 2,387 349 468 817 34.2% Maryland 5,127 388 980 1,368 26.7% Massachusetts 5,018 585 1,987 2,572 51.3% Michigan 10,923 1,584 1,304 2,888 26.4% Minnesota 13,067 1,156 423 1,579 12.1% Mississippi 17,007 3,002 1,315 4,317 25.4% Missouri 24,071 4,433 3,108 7,541 31.3% Montana 4,980 473 541 1,014 20.4% Nebraska 15,475 2,382 1,241 3,623 23.4% Nevada 1,705 47 156 203 11.9% New Hampshire 2,364 383 358 741 31.3% New Jersey 6,448 750 1,501 2,251 34.9% New Mexico 3,850 404 294 698 18.1% New York 17,361 2,128 4,518 6,646 38.3% North Carolina 17,783 2,272 2,787 5,059 28.4% North Dakota 4,458 743 249 992 22.3% Ohio 27,998 2,862 4,001 6,863 24.5% Oklahoma 23,524 5,793 1,614 7,407 31.5% Oregon 7,318 514 1,155 1,669 22.8% Pennsylvania 22,325 5,802 3,934 9,736 43.6%\n\n17 The FHWA specifies four criteria based on NBI data that must all be met for a bridge to qualify for federal Highway Bridge Program (HBP) funding (FHWA 2006): The bridge must be longer than 20 ft (NBI Item 49), â¢ be a highway bridge that carries a public road, and be included in the NBI database. The bridge must be classified as either structurally â¢ deficient or functionally obsolete. The bridge must have an SR of 80 or less to qualify for â¢ federally funded rehabilitation, or an SR of less than 50 to be eligible for federal funding of its replacement. The bridge cannot have been built or replaced (NBI â¢ Item 27) or rehabilitated or reconstructed (NBI Item 106) within the last 10 years, regardless of the source of funding (the â10-year ruleâ). The requirements for an SD or FO rating and the SR thresholds were an attempt to give greatest priority to those bridges that had greatest need for work (essentially a âworst- firstâ criterion) (23 CFR 650D). The FHWA imposed the 10-year rule â[to prevent] a bridge from remaining in a defi- cient classification after major reconstruction and thereby affecting the bridge fund apportionments to a Stateâ (FHWA n.d.). Recently, the FHWA has clarified these provisions with respect to the eligibility of structurally deficient bridge decks for HBP funding (Lwin 2007). Structurally deficient bridge decks that require rehabilitation or replacement are eligible for federal funding regardless of the bridgeâs SR or require- ments of the 10-year rule, consistent with the provisions of TABLE 6 (Continued) NBI STATISTICS ON BRIDGE DEFICIENCY, 2007 No. of Bridges No. of SD No. of FO No. SD or FO Percent SD or FO Rhode Island 748 164 232 396 52.9% South Carolina 9,221 1,260 808 2,068 22.4% South Dakota 5,924 1,216 261 1,477 24.9% Tennessee 19,838 1,325 2,776 4,101 20.7% Texas 50,271 2,186 7,851 10,037 20.0% Utah 2,851 233 254 487 17.1% Vermont 2,712 500 467 967 35.7% Virginia 13,417 1,208 2,234 3,442 25.7% Washington 7,651 400 1,661 2,061 26.9% West Virginia 7,001 1,058 1,515 2,573 36.8% Wisconsin 13,798 1,302 789 2,091 15.2% Wyoming 3,030 389 231 620 20.5% Puerto Rico 2,146 241 822 1,063 49.5% Totals 599,766 72,524 79,792 152,316 25.4% Source: FHWA 2007b. Note: Table for 2007. Data reflect bridges on NHS and non-NHS highways. SD = structurally deficient; FO = functionally obsolete. The SD and SR ratings are somewhat inconsistent with â¢ respect to bridge decks. Although SD directly reflects a deck condition that is poor or worse, the SR is much less sensitive: A deduction for poor or worse deck condition in the Serviceability and FO calculation subtracts at most 3% to 5% from the SR value. Moreover, deck con- dition is not included in the Structural Adequacy and Safety component of SR. No generally accepted and used set of predictive models â¢ exists for SD, FO, and SR. The models that have been developed to date are for specific agencies and purposes as discussed later and are not in general use. Lacking such deterioration or performance models, agencies can- not forecast trends in deterioration of SD, FO, and SR. The lack of such models precludes using NBI ratings to predict future bridge needs; quantify the benefits of future bridge investments; analyze different scenarios regarding infrastructure policy, performance, and cost; and assess resource allocation trade-offs. Chapter three provides examples of other technical mea- sures of bridge condition and performance that DOTs have developed to overcome some of these drawbacks. Funding Implications Utilization of the NBI as the primary data source for the disbursement of funds through HBRRP [Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program, now the Highway Bridge Program] and the Special Bridge Program has been the basis for bridge management decision making since the early 1970s (Small et al. 1999, A-1/2).\n\n18 DOTs are developing based on selected NBI rating items (see chapter three for examples of these indexes). Because a single agency deals with a smaller number of bridge designs and construction materials than those encountered nation- wide, state DOTs are able to subdivide their bridge popula- tions more easily into distinct groups for which modeling becomes more practical. A needs forecasting model has been developed for use with the entire nationwide NBI database. The FHWA applies this predictive tool, NBIAS (National Bridge Investment Analysis System), when preparing its bridge-related needs estimates for submittal to Congress in the biennial Condi- tions and Performance reports. NBIAS draws on the infor- mation in the complete NBI database and on a set of unique analytic techniques based in part on the methodology and data in Pontis, a full-featured BMS used in more than 40 state DOTs (e.g., for element-level deterioration models and default values of required data such as unit costs). Users may specify key input parameters such as standards for bridge structural preservation and functional improvement. The predictive models for bridge deterioration require ele- ment-level data describing the bridge network, informa- tion much more detailed than that in the NBI database. For example, element-level data would require descriptions and condition information on each bridge girder rather than a single numerical rating for the entire superstructure as in the NBI database. NBIAS therefore incorporates a unique set of Synthesis, Quantity, and Condition (SQC) models that draw on current NBI data to estimate the quantity and condition of all the bridge elements in the NBIâthat is, the element-level data are âsynthesizedâ from the NBI data. SQC models were derived from a statistical study of more than 10,000 bridges representing structural and materials configurations from throughout the country. NBIAS has continued to be enhanced since its initial use in the 1999 Conditions and Performance report to permit greater user flexibility and to improve the reliability of its estimates (FHWA and FTA 2006). BRIDGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS Background Development of new BMSs with more advanced decision- support capabilities began in the United States in the 1980s and continued through the 1990s. BMS designs and imple- mentations were pursued independently by several DOTs, including North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Kansas, New York, Indiana, and Texas. The FHWA sponsored a demonstration project that led to the development of Pontis (Small et al. 1999). Today, Pontis is an AASHTOWare product main- tained as part of AASHTOâs BRIDGEWare suite, and is used by more than 40 state DOTs plus other transportation agen- cies. DOTs that are not Pontis licensees may employ state- SAFETEA-LU. Specific guidelines for decks include the fol- lowing (Lwin 2007): Such bridge work is to be considered rehabilitation â¢ under the HBP regardless of the bridgeâs SR. Although the 10-year rule will not prevent federal â¢ funding of deck rehabilitation or replacement, once this work is performed, the 10-year rule will apply. Deck rehabilitation or replacement projects should be â¢ identified systematically, in conjunction with a com- prehensive BMS, to use federal and other bridge funds wisely. This bridge-deck eligibility does not relieve the bridge â¢ owner of having to perform other work needed to restore bridge structural integrity or to correct safety deficiencies. This clarification addressed several concerns expressed in 2007 congressional testimony regarding the eligibility of structurally deficient bridge decks for HBP funding. The key points that were presented in this testimony are discussed in Chapter 4. Predictive Models for NBI Measures The NBI condition and performance ratings are aggregate measures, sufficiently general to apply to the many combi- nations of bridge designs, materials, traffic loadings, and geographic locations throughout the country. It is therefore difficult to develop a general set of predictive models that could apply to the many different bridge configurations nationwide. This form of bridge management [based on NBI data] utilizes aggregated information and thus has limited applicability for analytical decision making. While the formula is convenient for funds allocation, it is not necessarily sufficient for analysis and needs prediction. â¦ A new form of bridge management decision support to facilitate budgeting, policy analysis and project- programming [came to be] desired (Small et al. 1999, p. A-1/2). Todayâs BMSs, which are alluded to at the end of the pre- ceding quotation, employ more detailed descriptions of bridge elements and individual deterioration models for each group of elements. These systems are discussed in the next section. A few DOTs have sought to take advantage of the wide coverage, ready availability, and rich content of their NBI database by formulating predictive models tailored to their own state practices and geographic conditions. In some cases, these models predict the change in NBI ratings on a scale of 0 to 9 (Michigan DOT, see Juntunen 2003) or the numbers of bridges in different SR intervals (Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development; see Sun et al. 2004). In other cases, yet newer models are being esti- mated for uniquely defined bridge indexes that individual\n\n19 A report of bridge â¢ NBI ratings Structure, Inventory, and Appraisal (SI&A) and load testing by structure. A supplementary report provides historical trends in NBI ratings for a structure. A report listing bridges by their â¢ SR priority. A list of bridges â¢ scheduled for inspection, with inspection due date. A list of bridges showing â¢ current maintenance needed. A list of bridges showing their â¢ current posting status. A list of bridges indicating those with â¢ data errors that have been identified in the FHWA edit report. A report relating â¢ bridge projects to road projects identified in the agencyâs construction project manage- ment system, identifying bridge replacement projects and other types of projects (e.g., bridge painting). Reports on â¢ specific bridge characteristics; for exam- ple, engineering and site conditions for scour-critical bridges. If an agency has defined its own measure of condition and performance, an additional set of reports likely will be avail- able to display this information. In this example for Alabama DOT, the ABIMS system provides a list of bridges by prior- ity in terms of several categories of Deficiency Points: Total, Load, Vertical Clearance, Width, Condition, and Statewide. A manager can tailor the ABIMS reports to focus on par- ticular areas of interest. These may be geographic (district, city, or county); for certain reports, the particular bridges to be shown (e.g., identified by Bridge Identification Number or by route-milepost limits); for inspection and maintenance reports, the inspection responsibility code or the maintenance responsibility code for which records are to be displayed; the type of inspections to be displayed (e.g., those on 24-month intervals versus intervals less than 24 months); the specific maintenance activities to be displayed; for reports on histori- cal records, the years to be displayed; and so forth. All of these reports represent current or historical snap- shots of bridge status. Some categories of reports, such as those related to identified bridge needs and actual mainte- nance work performed, or reports related to explanations of bridge engineering characteristics, may be available in both summary and detailed formats. Because the BMS has no predictive models, there are no forecasts, scenario analyses, or other future-oriented reports. Pontis System Overview Pontis was developed for the FHWA in 1989 and is now sup- ported through AASHTOWare as a product in AASHTOâs BRIDGEWare suite. It is licensed as of 2008 to DOTs in more than 40 states and the District of Columbia, as shown specific systems. Agencies in other countries likewise have the option of licensing Pontis or developing their own BMS. Examples of two U.S. BMSs that illustrate two ends of the analytic spectrum at which these systems operate follow. Alabama Bridge Information Management System System Description Some BMSs focus on database managementâfor example, input, quality checking, and processing of bridge data, and production of reports. The Alabama Bridge Information Management System (ABIMS) provides a series of bridge inventory and inspection menus by which users may input bridge descriptive information and inspection data. Another set of menus allows users to specify reports on, for example, bridges due for inspection, status of maintenance, bridge posting status, the rating history of a bridge structure, a vari- ety of inventory listings, and priority ranking. The criterion for priority ranking may be specified as either the FHWA SR or the stateâs unique Deficiency Point calculation. The latter report may be tailored according to Deficiency categoryâfor example, Total Deficiency, Load Deficiency, Vertical Clear- ance Deficiency, Width Deficiency, Condition Deficiency, and Statewide Deficiency (Alabama DOT 2006). This exam- ple illustrates one measure of value of a BMS: the ability to address unique aspects of bridge operation and customized features of bridge management. ABIMS is able not only to cal- culate Deficiency Points from NBI inspection data (together with SD, FO, and SR), but also to accommodate nonstandard legal loads in its bridge load rating calculations. Reports The ABIMS database is a repository of descriptive informa- tion on bridge structural characteristics, traffic loads, geo- graphic and route location, functional class, and age, as well as current and historical records of inspection data. NBI data are included for annual reporting to the FHWA, and cus- tom data defined by the agency are also included. Standard reports focus on breakouts of bridge characteristics, bridge condition, and information on related management tasks such as inspection and maintenance. Following are examples of the types of reports that are available: Separate reports presenting a complete â¢ list of bridges currently in the inventory, a list of structures catego- rized by current operational status (e.g., now in design or construction, in service, or out of service), and a list of bridges organized by special categories (e.g., those with underwater substructure, those with fracture-critical members, and those with certain NBI structural condition, waterway adequacy, and scour ratings of 3 or less). Inventory cross-referencing information is listed on another report. A list of â¢ bridges by route.\n\n20 Representation of Structural Elements Pontis describes bridge and culvert structures in more detail than the NBI offers. Bridges are expressed in terms of their structural elements. Some examples for different types of bridges include girders, stringers, and beams; truss components; arches; pin and hanger assemblies; deck and deck slab; railings and traffic barriers; deck joints; bear- ings; piers and columns; abutments, approach slabs, and wing walls; and footings and pilings. These elements may be described for bridges as a whole, or within sections with varying characteristics termed âstructure units,â as illus- trated in Figure 4 (Cambridge Systematics, Inc. 2005b). By contrast, the NBI would represent the bridge structure in Figure 4 by the more general components of superstructure, substructure, and deck. Pontisâ analytic approach is built around structural ele- ments. A brief discussion helps to illustrate the difference between element-level descriptions of bridge condition ver- sus the NBI ratings described earlier. Some examples are as follows: Bridge inspections are conducted at the element â¢ level. AASHTO has formalized these inspection procedures within its guide for âcommonly recog- nizedâ (CoRe) elements (AASHTO 1997). Although this guide was based on the Pontis approach, it has been generalized to apply to other BMS in addition to Pontis. Agencies may also define their own elements within Pontis. in Figure 3 (Johnson 2008), plus several city, county, and international agencies. It is a full-featured BMS that pro- vides a number of capabilities useful in supporting bridge program management and resource allocation (Cambridge Systematics, Inc. Jan. 2005b): Bridge Inventory: Establish and maintain an inventory â¢ of bridge and culvert information, and exchange data with other agency information systems. Managing Inspections: Schedule bridge inspections, â¢ enter or importing inspection data, produce SI&A and other inspection reports, and produce the NBI files that are required to be submitted to the FHWA annually. Needs Assessment and Strategy Development: Estimate â¢ and update bridge element deterioration and treatment cost models based on individual agency experience; develop long-range, network-level policies for both structure preservation and bridge improvement based on agency standards or guidelines and economic fac- tors, including agency and road-user costs; assess cur- rent and future preservation and improvement needs; and evaluate alternative bridge program investment scenarios based on predicted structure condition and performance, accounting for the technical, economic, and policy-related factors described previously. Project and Program Development: Develop projects â¢ to respond to inspector work recommendations and agency policies and standards; evaluate the impacts of project alternatives on structure performance; rank projects; develop programs of projects subject to budget constraints; and track project status and completion. FIGURE 3 U.S. state agencies licensing Pontis as of 2008 (Source: Johnson 2008).\n\n21 Do Nothing, or Clean and Paint, or Reset Bearings, and/or Rehabilitate Supports; CS-3, advanced cor- rosion: either Do Nothing, or Rehabilitate Supports or Bearings, or Replace the Bearing Unit. Bridge deterioration models and cost models are defined â¢ by the Pontis user for each element. Deterioration mod- els are expressed through transition probabilities that describe the likelihood of an element condition chang- ing from one condition state to another in a simulated cycle. Pontis users may estimate these probabilities when first applying the BMS, and later update them when historical data on element deterioration are avail- able. Preservation costs are expressed for each defined treatment or action by element and condition state. Pontis users may enter costs of bridge improvementsâ for example, for bridge widening, strengthening, or raising to improve vertical clearance. Bridge elements may be located in different environ-â¢ ments, which might influence rates of deterioration. The following environmental regimes are defined in Pontis (Cambridge Systematics, Inc. 2005b): BenignâNo environmental conditions affecting â deterioration LowâEnvironmental conditions create no adverse â impacts or are mitigated by past actions or highly effective protective systems ModerateâTypical level of environmental influ- â ence on deterioration SevereâEnvironmental factors contribute to rapid â deterioration. Protective systems are not in place or are ineffective. Analytic Processes Pontisâ analytic processes are extensive and address several aspects of bridge management. Their descriptions are con- tained in system documentation (Cambridge Systematics, Inc. 2005a, b; FHWA 2007d). An overview of the sets of procedures, which are organized in âmodules,â is shown in Figure 5. FIGURE 4 Structure units and elements in Pontis (Source: Cambridge Systematics, Inc. 2005b). Note: PS = painted steel; RC = reinforced concrete. Some agencies inspect bridges at the element level and then apply a Translator program in Pontis (developed for the FHWA) to convert element-level data to the for- mat required for NBI submittals. Other agencies con- duct dual inspections, recording bridge conditions at both the element level and in NBI format. State DOTs also may develop supplementary inspection guides to accommodate state-specific bridge, traffic, or other data requirements. Structure condition is defined at the element level in â¢ terms of up to five discrete âcondition states.â The best condition is specified in condition state 1, and the worst condition in the last condition state (condition state 3, 4, or 5, depending on the element). The per- centage of each element in each condition state is com- puted by Pontis in each time period and is available in a report. This breakdown describes the condition dis- tribution of that element, allowing a manager to get a better perspective on the magnitude of network-level deficiency. CoRe elements have predefined condition state descriptors. For example, the condition states for element 152, Painted Steel Floor Beam, and element 313, Fixed Bearing, are as follows (condition states are identified using a CS number convention): Painted Steel Floor Beam: CS-1, no corrosion; CS-2, â paint distress; CS-3, rust formation; CS-4, active corrosion; CS-5, section loss Fixed Bearing: CS-1, no deterioration; CS-2, minor â deterioration; CS-3, advanced corrosion Up to 10 preservation treatments or actions may be â¢ defined at the condition state level for each element. Pontis users may apply default actions or define their own preservation treatments. Actions may range across alternatives such as Do â Nothing, Routine or Preventive Maintenance, Minor Element Repair, Major Element Repair, Element Rehabilitation, and Element Replacement. A specific example by condition state for element â 313, Fixed Bearing, is as follows: CS-1, no deteriora- tion: Do Nothing; CS-2, minor deterioration: either\n\n22 of benefits versus costs and the resulting condition of the bridge network. The results of a Pontis simulation can be expressed in sev- eral ways (Cambridge Systematics, Inc. 2004): Condition distributions of structure elementsâ¢ Predictions of structure needs and work that is pro-â¢ jected to have been accomplished The Pontis Health Index, which is the ratio of the cur-â¢ rent value of all structure elements (based on their cur- rent distribution of condition states) as compared with the total value of all elements (assuming all are in their best condition state) Benefits to both agency and road users as the result â¢ of preservation and improvement actions; for exam- ple, monetized benefits owing to improvements in the Health Index, and road-user benefits in terms of reduced travel time, vehicle operating, and accident- related costs as the result of bridge improvements NBI condition ratings for deck, superstructure, sub-â¢ structure, and culvert; deficiency status (SD, FO); NBI appraisal ratings; and calculation of the NBI SR Other measures, including the Health Index of subsets â¢ of elements, eligibility for HBP funding, and detail information for individual structures. The Project Planning module focuses on projects for indi- vidual bridges. Projects are developed from results of the network-level analyses and from work candidates recom- FIGURE 5 Overview of Pontisâ analytic processes (Source: Cambridge Systematics, Inc. 2004). The review and analysis of bridge data, including bridge inventory and inspection data, is handled through the Inspec- tion module, which works with the database that is used in connection with Pontis. The data encompass the standard or default bridge elements and descriptors, the standard NBI data, and any custom data that the bridge manager has defined. The NBI Translator program may be applied to con- vert element-level data to the format required by the FHWA for NBI submittals. Other available processors include the SR program, which computes SR, SD, and FO status, and the Validation program, which conducts edit checks of the most recent NBI data. Pontis conducts a comprehensive analysis of bridge pres- ervation options to recommend a preferred strategy. This entails definition of a preservation policy for each combina- tion of bridge element and environment. Other data items are also defined, including (1) treatments for each element and condition state, (2) corresponding unit costs, and (3) other technical and budgeting parameters. Similarly, specifica- tion of an improvement policy entails providing guidelines and costs for different types of bridge improvements; for example, widening and increasing clearances. Separate sim- ulations and decision-support procedures are conducted for these two types of investments at the network level through the Pontis Program Simulation module. The network-level simulation accounts for the effect of budget constraints and supports estimates of bridge needs and decisions in pro- gramming, resource allocation, and budgeting. These analy- ses estimate impacts of future bridge investments in terms\n\n23 tor of the most recent regular and special inspections, and planned dates for the next inspections. The â¢ Inspection Resource Requirements report provides the dates of the last and the next scheduled inspections and planned resources needed in terms of estimated hours for the inspection crew, flaggers, help- ers, snoopers (trucks with inspector baskets on articu- lated, telescoping arms that can reach overhead or under a bridge), special crews, and other special equipment. The â¢ Bridge Health Index displays the current Pontis Health Index for selected bridges plus detailed infor- mation about the condition distributions of bridge ele- ments that are used to calculate the Index. The â¢ Bridge Condition Summary shows, for each selected facility, the most recent inspection date, the SD and FO rating, the SR, and NBI ratings for the deck, superstructure, substructure, culvert, and channel rat- ing items. The â¢ Network Element Summary shows the network- wide distribution of bridge elements by environment and condition state. Two reports present the results of the network-level mod- eling of Bridge Preservation: The â¢ Unconstrained Needs report displays the costs and benefits of the optimal preservation policy as applied to the bridge network when unconstrained by budget lim- its. The effect of the budget constraint is shown, how- ever, in the distinction between those recommended projects that are âprogrammedâ by Pontis (i.e., allowed by the budget limit) versus those that are not. The â¢ Preservation Details report identifies the recom- mended actions for each element in each type of envi- ronment and condition state, and compares the current distribution of bridge elements versus the distribution that would result from the optimal preservation policy applied over the long term. The report also provides the details on unit cost of each action, and the transition probabilities that were used in the deterioration model to determine the optimal policy. In addition to the bridge preservation results cited pre- viously, several standard reports provide information on Bridge Needs and Projected Work: The â¢ Bridge Management Summary reports the cur- rent requirements of the bridge inventory in terms of estimated future needs and programmed work by year. It helps managers to determine whether current invest- ment levels can meet the optimal long-term investment policy recommended by Pontis. The â¢ Backlog Summary displays the annual budgeted amounts versus the backlog of unmet needs by year and work category: preservation, replacement, and improvement/other work. mended by bridge inspectors. Projects can be assembled into programs. Once programs are defined, further network-level analyses can be run to refine resultsâfor example, by vary- ing the characteristics of scenarios, running what-if analy- ses, and adjusting policy specifications and costs to match agency business processes more closely. Results can be viewed in reports as described here. Customization Options The ability to customize BMS features will be shown in chapter three to be an important aspect of BMS usefulness and acceptability. Pontis has features dedicated to incorpo- rating user-defined additions or revisions within its analytic framework and graphical user display. A number of items may be customized, including the definition and classifica- tion of bridge elements, the definition and classification of bridge actions, the cost index that is used, internal formu- las for data processing, and organization of the desktop and assignment of user privileges. Features such as data input forms and reports may be customized to accommodate the analytic revisions. Reports Pontis presents a broad selection of standard reports, reflect- ing its extensive features and functionality. The reports are organized by system modules and include the examples listed here. Reports are available in metric or English mea- surement units. If a report pertains to a given structure (as opposed, for example, to summaries for a bridge network), the bridge(s) may be selected using Pontisâ Select Struc- ture screen, which selects bridges by district, county, owner agency, custodian agency, function class, NHS or non-NHS, defined administrative area, defined bridge grouping, or inspector responsibility. These descriptions are adapted from the Pontis Release 4.4 User Manual (Cambridge Sys- tematics, Inc. 2005b). Inspection Reports present information on the bridge inventory, current and historical information on bridge con- dition and performance, and inspection schedules. Example reports include the following: The â¢ SI&A sheet lists for each bridge the NBI SI&A information, element-level condition data, and past inspection comments. The â¢ Expanded SI&A report includes notes recorded by the inspector regarding a bridge, bridge element, and inspection; work candidates specified by the inspector; and summary information on past inspections. The â¢ Inspection Schedule gives inspection planning and scheduling information, including the frequency of regular and special inspections, the date and inspec-\n\n24 The â¢ Project Priority List displays projects sorted by program, year, and Pontis Program Rank. Managers may select a single year, a single project status (i.e., Initiated, Programmed, Deferred, In Progress, Completed), or an individual program to be displayed. If these fields are left blank, all projects will be selected. The Pontis Program Rank may be based on project benefits, costs, benefit-cost ratio, average Health Index, SR, or Agency Rank (e.g., a numerical score computed by the agency or a district-provided ranking). The â¢ Pontis Priority List displays Pontis-generated work candidates for a selected scenario and one or more selected years. The â¢ Pontis Candidate List displays Pontis-generated needs or work candidates for a selected set of bridges. Managers may select the groups of work to be included based on year, costs and benefits, whether work was programmed by the selected scenario, whether the work was assigned to a project, and other items avail- able in the Pontis work-related data. The â¢ Project Details report is a one-page-per-project display of all information provided on the project data entry forms, including a list of work items. Projects may be selected for this report based on project ID, pri- mary action type for the project (e.g., Replace Element, Overlay Deck, Replace Paint, or Replace Structure), the year for which the project is programmed, the proj- ect status, the program ID, and the district, route, and milepost/kilometer-post. The â¢ Actual versus Budget report compares the dol- lar value of programmed work by year to the annual budget that has been established for that program. The manager can specify the projects to be included in the programmed work totals in terms of project status cri- teria (i.e., one or more of the project status designations listed previously). The â¢ Program Funding report displays the fund- ing sources and amounts by year for each active program. A â¢ series of reports displays the costs and benefits of needed work and programmed work for the bridge network by year in different formatsâfor example, for each element or set of selected elements; for each element, grouped by element category; for different combinations of element category and material type; for each district, functional class, on/off NHS, and on/off system classification; for each district and each scenario; for all combinations of values of district, functional class, on/off NHS, and on/off system clas- sification; and overall costs and benefits by year. Two reports on performance measures: a â¢ Bridge Performance Measures report that displays perfor- mance measures by structure and year, and a Network Performance Measures report that displays perfor- mance measures for all combinations of values of dis- trict, functional class, on/off NHS, and on/off system classification. A â¢ Scenario Report displays the specifications for the currently selected scenario. Project Reports produce information related to individ- ual bridge structures: The â¢ Preservation Needs report displays preservation needs for individual structures that Pontis has gener- ated for the currently selected scenario, and an indi- cation of whether or not they have been programmed by the simulation. By selecting a particular year to display, a manager can identify whether needs for specific bridge(s) have been programmed (i.e., recom- mended as work candidates when budget constraints are considered). The â¢ Work Candidates and Projects report displays the proposed projects, inspector-specified work can- didates, and Pontis-generated work candidates for all scenarios for a selected set of bridges. This report is useful to determine which work candidates have been addressed by projects.\n\n25 CHAPTER THREE APPLYING BRIDGE MANAGEMENT TO AGENCY DECISION MAKING characterized by a stronger linkage between public policy and transportation system planning and programming; a greater interest in quantitative measures and criteria of per- formance and accountability; increased roles of actors other than the state DOTs in planning, programming, and shaping the nature of selected projects; greater funding flexibility, prompting a need to investigate trade-offs in resource alloca- tion among programs and projects; and innovative financing mechanisms involving the private as well as the public sec- tor. Adding to this dynamic management environment were continuing trends in broad, sometimes conflicting policy directions; competition among agency programs for scarce resources; increasing emphasis on system preservation and more efficient system operation; and uncertainties in sev- eral pertinent management areas, including funding, project budgets and schedules, and policy shifts following new state administrations and DOT executive turnover. NCHRP Syn- thesis 243 thus addressed methods used by DOTs for prior- ity setting, and the types of quantifiable measures of policy objectives and system performance that they applied, among other topics (Neumann 1997). The NCHRP Synthesis 243 survey was structured to elicit information comprehensively"
