        "text": "The Cyrus Avery Centennial Plaza\n\nMap showing the key elements of the Cyrus Avery Centennial Plaza (click for interactive map)\n\nHistoric U.S. Route 66 sign on the Skyway bridge, downtown Tulsa at the Cyrus Avery Centennial Plaza\n\nCyrus Avery Centennial Plaza looking west from the Skyway\n\nThe Cyrus Avery Centennial Plaza is named for the Tulsa resident who is known as \"The Father of Route 66\". It is located at the east entrance to the historic Route 66 bridge near downtown Tulsa. The first phase of the plaza, dedicated in 2008, included a display of flags from all eight states through which Route 66 traversed.\n\nA Skyway with observation deck leads pedestrians from the visitors parking lot across Southwest Boulevard to the plaza.\n\nThe park and sculptures are an artistic representation of the use of automobiles and highways spreading across the country in the late 1920s and 30s. Future plans for the Avery Centennial Plaza include a visitorâ€™s center and the Route 66 Interpretive Center, to be located on the hill beside the Skywalk near the parking lot. It would feature Route 66 exhibits, historical perspectives, restaurants and gift shop.\n\nCentennial Plaza is located at the east entrance to the historic Route 66 bridge at the intersection of Southwest Boulevard and Riverside Drive.\n\nA visit to Centennial Plaza is highly recommended for Route 66 fans!\n\nRoute 66 Bridge Over the Arkansas River\n\nDirectly west of Cyrus Avery Centennial Plaza is the original Eleventh Street Bridge bridge built in 1915 to carry Route 66 over the Arkansas River. It is located between newer bridges on Southwest Boulevard and Interstate 244, and was closed to traffic in 1980 although it remained open for pedestrians for a time.\n\nGates were locked on the bridge in 2008, and it remains closed to both vehicular and pedestrian traffic today. The old bridge is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and re-named the Cyrus Avery Route 66 Memorial Bridge."
