        "text": "The Tulsa Police Department is investigating after a body was found in the Arkansas River on Sunday.\n\nAccording to deputies, Around 2 p.m. a couple spotted the body in the river between Newblock Park and the 11th Street Bridge and called 911.\n\n\"It ain't right you know? You got someone's dead you gotta call the police and let them know what's going on about it,\" said Christopher Watters.\n\nThe couple said they saw it yesterday but didn't realize it was a person.\n\n\"We came here yesterday and the body was there. I wasn't for sure if it was a body or not so we came back today and we were fishing and my boyfriend got it tangled up and he walked out there and sure enough, it was a body,\" said Jennifer Duff.\n\nTulsa Police as well at the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office and Tulsa Fire, responded to the scene as a part of the search. The body of an adult female was recovered, the medical examiner says the individual possibly drowned. No foul play is suspected at this time but a full autopsy will be conducted.\n\n\"I'm not gonna go as far as to say homicide. We just have a body in the river but like I said we're not ruling anything out,\" said TPD Sgt. Marcus Harper. \"There are a lot of homeless camps up and down the river.. you know my experience, what we've seen from time to time is sometimes the homeless guys will get out there and maybe fall in the water or people get out there and fish sometimes, get too far and can't swim and don't have the proper equipment like life jackets and things like that and get trapped out there in the water and end up drowning so, we don't know yet.\""
