        "text": "McKissack &McKissack provided design-build services to reconstruct the 11th Street Corridor, a critical project in a 30-year initiative to transform the shores of the Anacostia River into a world-class waterfront.\n\nOne of the largest District Department of Transportation (DDOT) projects, the $390 million 11th Street Bridge Project was critical to improving travel and achieving the larger vision of the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative. The project replaces two bridges built in the 1960s with three new bridges that separate local and freeway traffic. McKissack provided design and construction management services to DDOT to reconstruct the 11th Street Corridor, including replacement of the existing bridge spans over the Anacostia River in Southeast Washington, D.C. McKissack provided the design for the streetcar system across the local bridge span and other design support services, as well as quality assurance and quality control. Construction inspection services included overseeing geotechnical investigations; concrete and steel testing; and preparing all the required documents. This mega project separates local and commuter traffic and accommodate pedestrians, bicyclists and a light rail system."
