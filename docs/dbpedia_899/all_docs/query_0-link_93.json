        "text": "In memory of Rebecca Gartrell, who would likely have set a new Fastest Known Time across Texas.\n\nRace reports serve several purposes: they give a feel for what it was like to be there and do the thing in question. They contain time-and-location-stamped photos and selfies important as evidence of FKTs (fastest known time on a specific route, maintained by FastestKnownTime.com) and are usually supported by other forms of evidence from live GPS trackers and GPS watch workouts. Together, they document a level of detail about road conditions, weather, or encounters that would be extremely difficult to falsify.\n\nThey also leave a record for others contemplating similar efforts that can help aid their own planning. I know that for my own runs, Leslie and I searched out all the race reports we could find from transconners, the more detailed the better.\n\nPartly because of the above, a lot of the following may read a little like: “I went here. I did that. I ate a sandwich. I finished at 6:00 PM.” I apologize in advance if that puts you to sleep.\n\nIf you’re still reading, though, please enjoy! It’s harder to get a much closer look at the day-to-day experience of running across the USA.\n\n2/1/2020: Newport Beach and the Pacific Ocean to Corona CA\n\nI began the #T1Determined Type 1 Diabetes Run Across America on February 1st, 2020, at the beach at the end of 47th Street, at 6 AM.\n\nMy wife Leslie and I had already been in San Diego for about a week, where we had set up “home base.” I did a TV interview with KUSI / Good Morning San Diego which gave me a great opportunity to share my three goals for the run:\n\nRaise awareness of issues faced by people living with Type 1 Diabetes, including the special challenges to managing blood sugars while being physically active.\n\nTo semi-officially run across the United States, according to the USA Crossers’ “two wet feet rule”: actually putting a foot in the water of both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.\n\nTo become the first person to run from Disneyland to Disneyworld and set the FKT for that distance. Unfortunately, Guinness doesn’t consider those two endpoints significant enough to constitute a world record. Crazy, right?\n\nTandem Diabetes Care, who makes my insulin pump, and Dexcom, who makes my continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) had invited us to tour their factories, so we started the week leading into the run by meeting up with the folks who actually help keep me and hundreds of thousands of other people with Type 1 alive and out of the ER. As we left Tandem, community outreach manager Blair Ryan gave me a wonderful box full of notes written by some of Tandem’s Type 1 employees and other Type 1s, designated to be opened at specific points along the way.\n\nSara Hall and her Type 1 diabetic photographer from the Newport Beach Independent had come out to the 47th Street beach with me the afternoon of January 31st, when we relocated our headquarters to Newport Beach (so I could test-run the Santa Ana River trail and Power Line Road east of Palm Springs), in order to get some daylight shots for the paper in case the starting line photos didn’t turn out. That’s their article in the photos, and you can read it here.\n\nI did a phone interview with the Orange County Register’s Disneyland reporter and you can read the article here.\n\nMy hometown magazine, Plano Magazine, also did an article about the run that ran January 31st, 2020.\n\nOutside of raising awareness of issues faced by people living with type 1 diabetes, I had one other logistical objective for the run that I hoped our carefully planned route would help me achieve: to stay off the Interstates unless that was the only way to get from point A to point B (and even then, limit any such time to less than a mile), and stay off illegal or private roads in general so if any records were set, they’d be valid for someone else to attempt.\n\nI wanted to make sure I documented the run thoroughly, so I carried with me a live satellite tracking beacon (a Garmin InReach), two GPS watches: a Suunto 9 Baro with extended battery life, plus a Suunto Ambit 3 that was a bit more accurate counting mileage but had known problems with refusing to record runs longer than 1000 kilometers; and my cell phone, which I hoped would record the time and location of abundant selfies I took next to unique landmarks along the way as I ran.\n\nAt the starting line, I was joined by USA Crosser Thomas Curran, who met us at the convenience store near Chronic Tacos a few blocks away and handed me a “lucky” $5 bill signed by previous USA crossers: for emergencies, or if you believe in luck, to prevent them. I ceremoniously signed it in anticipation of handing it off to the next crosser after me. The photographer from the Newport Beach Independent came out to get some starting line photos as well.\n\nI was also joined by fellow type 1 ultra runner Jerry Nairn. Jerry was one of the people who had written some notes to me to be opened somewhere along the way. I discovered Jerry’s note when we reached DFW, and it warmed my heart and reminded me of that first day.\n\nWe targeted a 6 AM start, about 45 minutes before sunrise, so I could finish the day in Corona before sunset. It was very windy and cold on the beach at that hour. I had dressed for running, so I was shivering when the photographer did the starting line photos for his newspaper. We didn’t have adequate lighting for the starting line shot, and my wife Leslie and others improvised by turning the cell phone flashlights on. In the end, the starting line photos didn’t turn out.\n\nRight at 6 AM, I scurried down to the water’s edge wearing my sand gaiters, as I didn’t want beach sand to be the reason I got blisters on the very first day, put a toe in the water, and with not much more ceremony than that, I was literally off and running.\n\nJerry ran with me about 10 miles until just before Disneyland. That’s Jerry in the photo above, somewhere along Superior / CA-55, a little before we turned onto Harbor Boulevard.\n\nI reached Disneyland at 9:40 AM, just over 14 miles from my starting point, and my wife Leslie took a photo of me with our Disney type 1 mascot, Coco the Monkey, in the hotel parking lot across the street, where we had reserved a spot in advance so we could celebrate the moment.\n\nMost of the remaining day was spent getting out of the congested area near the Los Angeles suburbs, which took a little doing for me as a runner. The biggest challenge on day 1 was finding a way to get past CA-93, a super-busy freeway that might have technically been legal to run on but which would have been suicidal or just crazy, without being too far from the van, which had most of our emergency medical supplies, including glucagon, spare infusers, insulin, CGM sensors, and glucose shots.\n\nI found a paved bike trail, the Santa Ana River Trail, that ran from Yorba Linda parallel to La Palma Avenue. I stayed on La Palma until the sidewalk ran out, in order for Leslie to be able to spot me, then got back onto the trail just past a gas station approaching the turn onto Gypsum Canyon Road and the bridge over the Santa Ana River, since there was a barrier blocking access to the trail for the remaining distance to the turn. The trail descended and ducked under Gypsum Canyon Road and continued for a few miles parallel to CA-93, a busy freeway I wanted to avoid. We rejoined each other at the far end of the trail at Green River Road.\n\nWhat I remember about the day was that my feet were fresh, I felt good, and the day seemed short. I made it to the gas station at Green River and Dominguez Ranch Road that marked my entry into Corona just before sunset, a total of around 36 miles.\n\n2/2/2020: Corona to El Casco CA (Redlands & San Timoteo Canyon Rd)\n\nThe second day was a little more challenging that I had expected. I ran along 6th Street, then Magnolia, for a good portion of it, with a couple turns just east of Home Gardens to avoid a dangerous overpass. That’s where I ran into my “instant friend” in the picture above, in Corona around 11:15 AM. He was a fellow runner who had heard about my USA run to raise type 1 diabetes awareness. His sister has Type 1.\n\nI no longer had the chilly wind from the beach, and even in February, the California sun just keeps coming. It was uphill into Riverside, and not long after turning onto Arlington / Chicago Avenue, I remember stopping on a little neighborhood pull-out just south of Andulka Park to meet with a lady who Leslie had been in contact with. By then, I was sweating profusely ad wishing I’d worn my desert running shirt.\n\nSomewhere around the turn for Central, I ran into two parents with their daughter, who was selling Girl Scout cookies. I paid for a whole box and ate two cookies. They were delicious. That put me in a much better mood.\n\nOne thing I’ve learned is that you don’t pass up good opportunities to sit down for a minute or two. Somewhere along Central I found a discarded chair, and feeling like I deserved it, sat down–carefully. You can see how dodgy the chair looks in the photo above.\n\nAt Sycamore Canyon Road, I turned and followed the frontage, which kept switching from decent to weed-covered, until I got to my left turn at the Jack-in-the-Box at Box Spring / Ironwood Road.\n\nGiven its proximity to Los Angeles, I was surprised at how rural things got after that. The last photo above is of a bit of farmland along Ironwood before I came to the turn at Redlands Road.\n\nThe day wore on, and before long, I was starting to run out of sunlight. I ran fast along Redlands Road through Moonlight Rim. The shoulder came and went and then never came back, and the road got rather busy, so I adopted the habit of running when there were gaps in traffic, then stepping quickly off into the weeds when I had to.\n\nI reached some kind of outbuilding just before the road bent slightly east toward San Timoteo Canyon Road and checked my remaining miles for the day. It was touch and go and very narrow or absent shoulders through the narrow canyon road just before San Timoteo Canyon Road. At one point, I’m pretty sure I lost GPS on all three of my trackers, because both of my watches reported a lost signal and my live tracker shows a gap. But there was nothing much I could do about it, and fiddling with electronics on a 1-2 ft. shoulder on a busy road just before sunset seemed like a horrible idea. I learned later that signal echoes and drop-outs are fairly common in canyons depending on how narrow they are.\n\nWhen I emerged from the canyon it was mostly downhill and a wide shoulder. I reached the intersection with San Timoteo Canyon Road at last light.\n\n2/3/2020: El Casco to Palm Springs CA\n\nThe early morning hours heading down San Timoteo Canyon Road toward Beaumont, Banning, and Palm Springs were a mixed blessing. February 3rd was one of the coldest days in the early part of the run, and I had doubled up my winter gloves to keep my hands, which are subject to Reynaud’s, from becoming painfully cold.\n\nDespite the fact that it was a Monday, and around dawn, there wasn’t much traffic on the road. The road ran parallel to a railroad for a while. It was quiet, apart from a road crew that had set up near where a slight S-curve in the road crossed the railroad. Before I knew it, I was at Fisherman’s Retreat and the sun was coming up.\n\nThe sandy, off-and-on shoulder of San Timoteo Canyon Road eventually gave way to Oak Valley Parkway, a wider road with better shoulders, which still ran through a fairly rural area.\n\nI ran along Oak Valley Parkway until it emerged in a more developed area and T’d onto Highland Springs Road in Beaumont. There, the road was under construction and the easternmost lane was blocked off with cones and trucks. I ran along that area until I felt I was becoming a traffic hazard. Eventually, I was forced to run in the grassy area on the east side of the street, which was absolutely full of cockleburs. By the time I reached the Walgreens at 6th / Ramsey, I had close to 20 burs stuck in my insteps, shoelaces, and even the soles of my shoes. I sat down on the curb and picked them out before turning onto Ramsey and continuing.\n\nMy running was relatively uneventful after that. I met Leslie and the van at the gas station at Hargrave before setting off on the next segment of the run, a section I hadn’t been entirely sure would work even after scouting it upon our arrival in Newport Beach.\n\nGetting out of the Los Angeles basin on foot is harder than it looks. There are really only a few ways out.\n\nOne is to run local roads or the I-10 frontage road until you reach Haugen-Lehmann near the Indian Casino and surrounding shopping, then get on the north side of the Interstate to take Tamarack and some small roads until you reach a section of sandy, non-vehicle-friendly land with windmills. You cross that for a mile or so and come out on a utility road that joins CA-62. From there, some transconners take CA-62 north for a while until they reach a hill called the Morongo Grade. The shoulder on Morongo Grade is very narrow, perhaps 2 feet at most, and it’s next to a busy multi-lane highway that heads toward 29 Palms.\n\nAnother way is to take mountain roads south of Banning toward Ribbonwoods and Palm Desert, which are prone to having narrow or nonexistent shoulder. That route is perhaps the longest one, which prolongs the risk of getting hit by a vehicle.\n\nThe third way is to run parallel to I-10 on the south side for as long as you can, get to CA-111, and head into Palm Springs. That’s the route I took. It’s relatively short, remarkably quiet, and the only disadvantage is that once you’re in Palm Springs, there isn’t much beyond Coachella but desert. For a runner with a van, that’s not as challenging as it looks and there are a few places to stop, just not many.\n\nI crossed south on Hargrave to just before the Banning Airport. There’s a short paved road next to the airport that runs parallel to railroad tracks. That road dead-ends, but there are a few safe places to cross the railroad tracks, and after maybe a mile or so of stepping gingerly over the large rocks that make up the rail bed, you emerge onto a long-neglected road called Johnson. That’s Johnson in the pictures above with the mature weeds growing through the asphalt.\n\nI followed Johnson past the back side of the inspection state to where it kind of unofficially dumps out onto a roundabout. From there, I took Main St. through Cabazon and Mons until the road ran out.\n\nThere’s a short section, perhaps a quarter mile, where the safest and only way for a runner to get to CA-111 is the wide right shoulder of I-10. Technically one could run the left shoulder after exiting Tamarack, but not only would that require running shifting sands on the top of a hill, but you’d still have to be on the interstate, for longer, and crossing a long bridge across the highway to exit onto CA-111.\n\nThis is why I say it’s hard to find a safe way out of the LA basin. I took the safest one available, and after not long, I was on the wide shoulder of CA-11 and headed toward Palm Springs (that’s it in the fourth picture above).\n\nIt was on the shoulder of CA-111 that I ran across a guy who had for years been collecting recyclables and exchanging them for the few pennies value they had, then had taken the money he saved and bought bicycles for over 100 kids. This was one of the first encounters on my USA run that I had with people out on the road doing good in the world.\n\nSomewhere in Banning I dropped an entire bottle of glucose test strips on the ground. Things like that can put you in a funk for a while on these long runs, so I tried to remind myself it wasn’t really a bad day.\n\nAround 2 o’clock in the afternoon I ran into fellow Type 1 diabetic Matt Kearney, who is a firefighter with the Palm Springs Fire Department. Something you might not know is that it is very, very difficult with type 1 to obtain and hold a job as a first responder. Many towns feel a bit gun-shy about having someone in a lifesaving job whose own life might be endangered by a low blood sugar. So actually working in such a job is a sign not just that Matt’s in pretty tight control, but that people with Type 1 can do pretty much anything if they’re careful, meticulous, and determined enough.\n\nI felt instant brotherhood with Matt.\n\nJust before sunset, I reached the gas station that marked my entry into Palm Springs, feeling pretty good about the world. I took one last photo at sunset, from our hotel, because with the sunset and palm trees, it reminded me of the Eagles’ Hotel California. The icing on the cake was testing my sugar once we were in the hotel room and finding it to be 94 mg/dl, which is very close to normal, despite a stressful day of sucking down calories and trying not to get struck by cars.\n\n2/4/2020: Palm Springs to Coachella CA\n\nFrom the gas station at the edge of town in Palm Springs, I ran along 111 until I reached downtown, and turned onto Vista Chino. Around 10 AM, I was surprised by the loud growl of a diesel engine behind me and a couple of short, friendly honks. My friend Matt had somehow managed to give me a fire engine escort through Palm Springs!\n\nI cannot tell you what an uplifting moment that was for me. Some of my transconner friends who are first responders or military types occasionally get this kind of VIP treatment, but I never expected it. I had just been happy that Matt showed up the previous day.\n\nMatt and two other firefighters ran with me through the rest of Palm Springs until we reached the border with Cathedral City. We parted ways, and I was on Cloud Nine.\n\nNot long after, I turned onto Ramon and ran toward I-10, picking up the east side frontage road (Varner) in Thousand Palms just past the Agua Caliente Casino. I headed south along Varner (I-10 frontage), and as sidewalk appeared and disappeared into sandy shoulder, I began to get the sense that civilization here was an uneasy truce between people and the desert. My route jumped the highway at Jefferson to the south / west side, and by late afternoon, I was in Indio.\n\nLooking back, I really don’t know where the time went.\n\nIndio, which lies in the gap between Palm Springs and Coachella, was a little seedy. Some of the convenience stores I passed had a number of homeless and sometimes addled-looking people waiting outside. One of the stores I went into for a restroom break had the cashier inside a separate room with bulletproof glass.\n\nThat said, once we reached Coachella, we had dinner that same night at El Mexicali Cafe, a little place next to the railroad tracks that looked fairly busy with local patrons. I no longer see it on their menu, but I remember having chicharrons and a fried egg, and that it was awesome.\n\n2/5/2020: Coachella to Mecca CA and Box Canyon\n\nHeading out of Coachella was more of the same: seemingly endless stretches of Indio Boulevard / I-10 business, which got increasingly more desert-like and less developed. We passed a date farm on the right, and Leslie stopped to get me a date-flavored milkshake, which wasn’t bad. It tasted like a cross between grape and chocolate.\n\nThe road shoulders soon went to hell in a handbasket. They were steeply sloped and sandy, and just stepping off the road became a challenge, as my feet would often get caught in a shower of sand as the shoulder collapsed where I stepped off the road. I was wearing my desert gaiters, so that helped, but after a while, the absent shoulder and road camber (slant) become quite annoying and put stress on my ankles.\n\nAt 6th Street, somewhere around lunchtime, I crossed into Mecca. The shoulders finally came back. We had lunch at a place called Taco Time that was for the most part a hole-in-the-wall, but had the best carne asada I’ve ever tasted, plus some kind dish that was a bit like fried mashed potatoes. Just as we arrived, we were passed by a group of cyclists who appeared to be headed down 66th Avenue toward Box Canyon. We later learned that Box Canyon Road, which is what 66th turns into, was a popular route for cyclists, and we encountered a few of them later in the day.\n\nAfter lunch, I was underway again, through a section of land that was fairly well irrigated and had crops growing. I was amazed how in the middle of the desert, there were hundreds of acres of crops.\n\nThat same day, Ross Wollen of A Sweet Life, an online diabetes diet-focused newsletter, did an online interview with me and published an article about my run and what I ate while out on the road.\n\nThe farmland gave way pretty quickly to sandy canyonland.\n\nBox Canyon was beautiful, but it was sunny. The sun is an odd thing. Even in February, it’s relentless. You can be so cold you need a jacket, as you can see in the pictures above, and yet sometimes even with a wide-brimmed boonie hat, it can still bear down on you and make you dizzy. As I looked up to catch the occasional fighter jet flying overhead, when I looked back down I found I had to catch my balance.\n\nToward the end of the day, I finally emerged out of the canyon and onto a section of Box Canyon Road that would eventually join up with a dirt utility road paralleling I-10 that would be my secret to finally getting out onto the open highways outside the populated part of Southern California.\n\n2/6/2020: Box Canyon to Desert Center CA via Pinto / Power Line Road\n\nWe began the day at the western end of Pinto Road, a road defined in only the loosest sense. To reach the very short paved section of the road from Box Canyon, you actually have to drive in sand deep enough to get your wheels caught. So it was off limits from the start for Leslie to follow the same route. Instead, we agreed that she’d hop onto I-10 and drive down to each of the exits in sequence: Chiriaco Summit, Hayfield, Red Cloud, and Eagle Mountain Road.\n\nJust past the Hayfield exit, in the distance across the highway, I could see a huge concrete structure built into the mountainside and wondered what it was. It turns out that the area around Desert Center has a storied past. Back in the early 1900s, some folks had this great idea to divert the waters of the Colorado River into a huge reservoir just north of that structure. It was supposed to form a wonderful manmade lake and perhaps the planners had an idea that development would sprout up around it; I’m not sure. Anyway, the new lake leaked. The rerouted river breached an irrigation canal and hundreds of millions of gallons of water from the Colorado River made its way toward what is now the Salton Sea. The project was abandoned and as the Salton Sea had no reliable freshwater replenishment source, it became increasingly salty and stagnant. Today, it stinks like an abandoned fishery and only the most hardscrabble types still live anywhere nearby. Parks, fishing areas and other amenities near this manmade inland sea sea have gone to seed.\n\nThe remainder of Pinto Road, including the part where Pinto gave out and continued as jeep trail just north of Power Line Road, was mostly unnavigable by anything other than an off-road vehicle. Some sections were fairly well-packed gravel and some were fairly rocky and sandy, especially near the so-called “washes”, places where flood waters often crossed roads in the rainy season.\n\nOff and on, I’d encounter something noteworthy. One thing in particular that stands out in my mind was a type of lodging that someone appeared to have set up just off the dirt road, which appeared to be little more than a dirt mound covering some kind of structure from whose top stovepipes arose. Sometimes jackrabbits would bound across the trail and off into the desert. At some point, I began to notice some fairly large paw tracks that I thought might be from a mountain lion.\n\nI had scouted this section previously upon arrival in Newport Beach, and had marked in my notes where to turn so I didn’t get lost in the desert; however, it spooked me to see mountain lion tracks and I lost track of my turns. Figuring it couldn’t hurt me to just follow the power lines, I continued on what I thought had been my route. I was relieved when I arrived at the next exit and spotted Leslie.\n\nThe sections between the Interstate exits were typically 4-6 miles long. Leslie would meet me at the exits and I’d unload any pretty rocks I saw. For the rest of the way across California and Arizona, having little better to do at times, I became quite the amateur rock hound. After a while, though, with rocks heavy in my waist pack and pockets, I got far more selective, threw some rocks back, and kept the smaller ones.\n\nAll in all, I believe it was about 20 miles of poor-quality, sandy jeep trails before Leslie and I joined each other at Eagle Mountain Road. There, I crossed the highway to Ragsdale Road and rain over a little more than half a dozen rickety old bridges until we reached the largely-abandoned former downtown of Desert Center.\n\nPro Tip: fellow transconners, if you are looking for accommodations in the actual living downtown of Desert Center, there’s an RV park community a bit north at Lake Tamarisk that is clean, friendly, and absolutely charming. It even has a walking trail around the lake its own little fire department.\n\n2/7/2020: Desert Center CA to US-177 & CA-62\n\nOnce we left Desert Center, there was very little to look forward to until we reached Parker, AZ. For lack of any better location, we targeted our day’s-end where CA-177 joined US-62 east of Joshua Tree.\n\nI began to see signs for Parker, AZ.\n\nBut mostly, it was one long section of desert road. On CA-177, the shoulders were paved for a good ways and mostly adequate. There wasn’t a lot of traffic, and we had planned our start date on purpose to fall well after the rainy season, since during our scouting we had encountered a road closure on 177 due to flooding, which caused significant re-routing in an area that doesn’t have that many routing options to start with.\n\nI spotted a tow truck that reminded me of the Tow Mater character from the Disney film Cars, and out in the middle of the desert, a porta-potty. For the next several hundred miles, all the way to Rodeo, NM, I began to encounter them just when I needed them, and came to believe my porta-potty “juju” was very strong.\n\nI am still amazed that someone had the forethought and diligence to put a fresh roll of TP in a stall in the middle of the Mojave Desert.\n\n2/8/2020: CA-177 & CA-62 to RR crossing west of Vidal Junction CA\n\nWe stayed one more blissful night at the RV park at Lake Tamarisk, and returned to CA-177 and CA-62 to continue running.\n\nDesert sunrises are something to behold. The photo above doesn’t do it justice.\n\nJust past the turn onto CA-62, I encountered the Iron Mountain Training Center, a big section of desert where troops had trained for possible desert deployment during WWII. It’s long since been closed, but it broke up the monotony and I was glad to see it.\n\nOnce on CA-62, I began to encounter a series of slowly rolling hills that wouldn’t have been a nuisance to run on except for the fact that in most places it was a 2-lane road and they were blind hills. I stayed as far away from the road as I could. In many places, the desert sands had blown over the road and the road was only visible behind and beyond. But the shoulders were fairly wide until just before the entry into Vidal Junction and its lone gas station about 17 miles outside of Parker. Gas there was somewhere around $5.00/gallon, which was more than double the price elsewhere\n\nAt around 3 PM I reached Rice, CA, the location of both the “miles from nowhere” sign and the famous “shoe fence” (shoe tree, shoe… structure?!) and some other oddities, including a long stretch of road just north of which was a section where people had spelled out messages in dark-colored rock against the light-colored rail bed. It was cool, crazy and weird, but it also felt a little bit like what you’d get if you awarded art installation slots at Burning Man to the lowest bidders.\n\nWe grabbed a snack at the shoe fence, took some photos, and moved on.\n\nIt was a bit of a stretch to actually make it to Vidal Junction, so we picked a landmark we could relocate on a map and decided to end the day at a RR crossing far enough west of Vidal Junction that it would make a reasonably full day running into Parker.\n\n2/9/2020: RR crossing west of Vidal Junction CA to Parker AZ\n\nMy train juju was nearly as strong as my porta-potty juju. When we reached the railroad crossing for the day start west of Vidal Junction, just as I crossed the tracks, I noticed a lo-o-ong train approaching.\n\nAt this point in the run, my feet were still doing okay, but I was starting to feel the accumulated miles. We had planned for a rest day every 10 days or 250 miles, whichever came first, and Parker, AZ was right at the 250 mile mark, give or take a few.\n\nI started to see signs indicating that Parker was within a day’s running distance, and at once I felt both excited and exhausted. As a result, the day seemed to stretch out forever.\n\nJust outside Parker, CA-62 turns onto CA-95, which becomes AZ-95. After crossing a long bridge at the Colorado River, I was back in civilization, ready to get out of my running clothes, take a long, hot shower, and eat the biggest entree I could find\n\n2/10/2020: Rest Day in Parker AZ\n\nAfter constantly suiting up, facing road hazards, and slogging out the miles for the last 10 days, it felt weird to be off the clock. Leslie and I stopped several times at Crossroads and did our best to fill me up with protein.\n\nLeslie and I took a short walk around town just to loosen my legs, and I spotted a leaf that made me smile. We encountered Melvin Lee, the grandfather of one of my T1D friends, Michell Lee Scott, who turned out to be a pretty cool guy.\n\nThe rest of the time I slept at the hotel with my feet elevated and tried to rebuild some of what I had broken down.\n\nLeslie had taken great care of my feet, and despite the constant thread of sand in my shoes, the desert gaiters had kept out nearly everything that might have caused me trouble. But I was beginning to wear the tread off my first pair of Inov-8s, one that I had taken to a cobbler who sewed a continuous line of Velcro around the shoes just above the sole. I was hoping I could make them last through Arizona at least, possibly some of New Mexico, and crossed my fingers at an outside chance they’d last me through west Texas.\n\nFor the mean time, though, my well-taped and coddled feet were free of blisters and I had California behind me. I had crossed my first state in the USA run as well as the entire Pacific Time Zone. I had crossed the Mojave Desert on foot and was into the Sonoran and its ubiquitous barrel cacti.\n\nI let that sink in while I dug into my steak.\n\n2/11/2020: Parker to Bouse AZ\n\nThere was something about finally leaving Parker that stayed with me. As I headed east out of town past the Running Man gas station (of course I had to take a selfie!), I began to see a little more scrub, cactus, and clouds and a little less sand and unrelenting sun. I can only imagine what that sun would have been like during the summer.\n\nI set my sights on reaching the junction with AZ-72.\n\nThe landscape was beautiful. But as in the Mojave, there were few landmarks to establish where I was and where I was going next, so I began to lose track of time. The occasional road sign would inform me I was getting closer to the next town, and mysterious “cow” signs started showing up. And not just one. It was like a crazy person with a paintbrush and a bunch of road signs was desperately trying to warn us all of an impending invasion by bovines.\n\nI realize the purpose of the signs was to let motorists know that there were no fences and to watch for cows crossing the road, but honestly, I don’t think I ever saw even one cow. In fact, the only cow I ever saw on this stretch of road was when I was looking at the road on Google Street View. And I imagine that cow was rather surprised.\n\nI reached Bouse, AZ and its little market / laundromat around 5 PM, a little over an hour before sunset.\n\nLater that night, we returned to the hotel in Parker (closest accommodations) and I opened the care package my friends at Tandem Diabetes had given me in San Diego the week before the run. I was truly blown away by the warm, personal notes from the very real people who worked at the insulin pump company that kept my body alive.\n\nThe notes, however, kept my soul alive.\n\n2/12/2020: Bouse to Salome AZ\n\nThe road heading out of Bouse was fairly busy. I had seen very little traffic the day before, and wondered at the reason for increased traffic. There were towns along the route called Utting, Bush Pit, and Vicksburg, but they seemed to exist only in the sense that they had a zip code. No general stores, not even a dilapidated or abandoned building to be seen.\n\nEventually the traffic waned as I got farther out of town.\n\nThe day’s big excitement was finally getting off AZ-72 in Hope, AZ and turning onto US-60 and the road into Salome. At the junction, there is a sign announcing entry into Hope. There is also a sign just past the turn announcing that “You Are Beyond Hope.” I’m not a superstitious person, but at the time I thought it was bad juju to take a selfie in front of that particular sign.\n\nThe road headed toward Salome was blessed with relatively clear ranch roads of pack sand just a few yards off the highway. They made for fast running.\n\nAround 5:30 PM, heading into Harcuvar, I was excited to spot a rock with some petroglyphs. It got my mind racing about who made them and how long ago, and the remaining 30 minutes or so into Salome flew by. Leslie and I stopped and had dinner at Salome Restaurant, then tucked into our spot at the RV park nearby, where we just happened to be parked next to where another transconner on a bike had set up his tent. But it was chilly and we were both too tired to talk much.\n\n2/13/2020: Salome to Tonopah AZ\n\nThe next day was one of cloudless skies and unending roads. After making the turn onto Salome Road heading towards Tonopah, I encountered some serious thorn bushes. It was only after getting some stuck in the soles of my shoes that I realized they were everywhere across Arizona, new Mexico, and much of west Texas. But they seemed worst in Arizona.\n\nA few miles before we reached the intersection with I-10 where we planned to call an end to the day, we encountered an irrigation canal of some sort. The desert in that part of Arizona didn’t seem as well and thoughtfully irrigated as the area around Mecca, CA, and I wondered where the water eventually went.\n\nShortly thereafter, I reached the junction with I-10, beyond which Salome Road turned into a 7-mile-long dirt road that I planned to tackle the next morning.\n\n2/14/2020: Tonopah to Buckeye AZ\n\nSalome Road heading out of Tonopah and toward the Phoenix area was mixture of dirt and pavement pockmarked with potholes that were difficult to see in the dark. Google Maps hadn’t created a street view for that section, and I had a few turns to avoid, so I walked a good chunk of it to make sure I didn’t run right past the few landmarks I had that were unambiguous from the satellite view.\n\nThe sunrise was beautiful. The photos above are unretouched: it really did look like the sky was on fire, and I wondered if anyone else had ever taken the chance to watch it from this forgotten stretch of road.\n\nAfter seven miles, the pavement returned as I ran past signs for Wintersburg, past a lone house perched on a steep hillside, to the turn at Baseline Road.\n\nParts of Baseline Road had sidewalk, but that luxury was short-lived.\n\nBaseline Road seemed to go on forever, and it wasn’t the quiet road I remember during our route scouting trip. The area around Phoenix seems to be expanding rapidly, and the road was not only choked with traffic, but the traffic was slowed by the fact that nobody seemed to have thought of installing signal lights. Nearly ever intersection was marked by a four-way stop that left traffic at a standstill.\n\nI presume this was the fault of the same city planner who named one of the streets “393th.”\n\nI ran the sandy shoulder into Buckeye, thankful that I was on foot, until we reached the Shell at the far side of Oglesby Road / Highway 85, where I slowed down a bit to make sure I didn’t miss Mikey’s Mini Mart and our official day’s end in Buckeye. The mini-mart looked a bit dodgy, so we agreed I’d run a little farther through a neighborhood to a building that said Roosevelt Irrigation District. The sun was already low in the sky and I was anxious to get to the hotel and get a good night’s sleep.\n\n2/15/2020: Buckeye to Laveen AZ\n\nThe run from Buckeye to Laveen did not go as planned. It started off well enough, then got worse toward the end of the day.\n\nBuckeye Road eventually T’d into MC-85, which I ran for a while. My porta-potty juju was strong as a neared a bend in the road where some construction was going on, and for the most part the shoulder improved.\n\nI was joined in Goodyear by Martha Kennedy Kratchman and her husband John, who originally signed up to drive her chase vehicle and eventually ran with us, then back to the chase vehicle, then drove ahead, then ran back to meet us. He got a workout that day!\n\nI rejoined Buckeye Road further to the northeast (see what I mean about it going on forever?), and crossed the Agua Fria River.\n\nRivers are weird in Arizona. They’re either there (flood season) or they aren’t. When they aren’t, you encounter bridges over bits of desert that make you think the city planners just had extra money and needed to spend it or lose it. It was dry season, so I just had to imagine the river was actually there.\n\nOriginally, our route took a turn on 91st Street and went past the wastewater treatment plant, then on some local roads for another six miles through Komatke, where I took the selfie with the discarded office chair, toward a gas station in Maricopa. Not long after that, I encountered a rather territorial dog, and a cop stopped by. I figured he was going to try to separate the dog from me or warn me about a road closure.\n\nWell, it turns out that the not-very-well-marked road I was on was part of the Gila River Indian Reservation. The cop, who worked for the reservation, said I was trespassing.\n\nThat was the last thing I wanted to hear after running six miles past the wastewater treatment plant, but minus those six miles it had still been a 30 mile day.\n\nWhat I really didn’t enjoy was spending the next four hours at the hotel completely redesigning the next three or four days of the route to avoid Indian lands while not losing sight of turn cues or landmarks such as gas stations, which represented restroom stops I genuinely looked forward to. I was already tired and badly in need of rest. But there wasn’t an option not to avoid the reservations, as some records -keeping organizations stipulate that a route may not make use of illegal or private roads, both categories that my Komatke excursion fell into.\n\nIt was harder than I thought, as a sizeable portion of Arizona is Indian lands. In fact, some of the US and state highways that cut across the state do so only by virtue of some rather tenuous easement agreements. A fellow transconner who had taken a similar route through the southwest told me to stay to state highways and stay on the paved shoulder–sometimes easier said that done. But that’s what I was going to have to do.\n\nMy beautiful 2800 mile route suddenly became a 2845 mile route. Since those extra miles came before my rest day in Marana (just outside Tucson), I resented it even more.\n\nThe Komatke cop had been right; and moreover, he had been polite, and I had no choice but to back my route up to the previous turn, not take it, and start the next day from where I had left off, heading east toward Chandler and Gilbert.\n\n2/16/2020: Laveen to Gilbert AZ\n\nIt turned out not to be so bad after all picking things up at Laveen and heading toward Chandler. Though the route was longer and added a little over a day, my new route had considerably more sidewalk and places to stop.\n\nI continued along Baseline (see, it really does go on forever!) to just before AZ-87, then cut through a business park to avoid a busy intersection. It was somewhere near there that I ran into a fellow runner (not in his running clothes, though) who nevertheless ran with me for a mile or so. Then we went our separate ways.\n\nAfter emerging from the business park, I turned right onto AZ-87 / Arizona Avenue and continued to Pecos Road. The road was nice, but the beating my feet had taken from the previous day’s 36-mile run, added to the current day’s attempt to make up for lost time, annoyed the bone spur in my left foot, and toward the end of the day, I was limping and very ready to be done with it all.\n\nI stopped at the Circle K at Pecos and Val Vista, right around sunset, slightly disoriented due to the fact that I had seen the route only once, in Google Street View, in daylight lighting. It wasn’t the way I preferred to do things.\n\nJust after sunset, I ran into my old high school classmate, Rick Elliott, who came out to greet us. Strangely, it helped my feet feel better.\n\n2/17/2020: Gilbert to Coolidge AZ\n\nI was joined in Gilbert by Type 1 diabetic ultra runner Patrick Votruba, who ran a number of miles with me, then turned around and ran back.\n\nI enjoy all the company I get when doing runs like this, but Patrick was a particularly great pleasure to run with. He knew type 1, he knew ultra running, and he was one of a small number of people who could conceive of what I was doing and why it meant to much to me to do it. He also seemed to be well-acquainted with watching for road hazards.\n\nI didn’t have to think about anything on his behalf. We just ran, for the pleasure of running despite all the inconveniences and downright horrors that type 1 sometimes adds being athletic. We talked about everything until the good running shoulder an out miles later and going farther would have just put him in more weeds or sloped shoulder.\n\nI followed Pecos Road to Power Road, then Rittenhouse, and things quickly got rural again. I hoped that by taking Rittenhouse through Queen Creek and San Tan Valley, I could avoid running into issues with crossing Indian land, which I was now quite jumpy about due to the scarcity of options that didn’t involve Interstate or major highways. I was especially concerned about Florence and the area just outside of Coolidge, because it seemed desolate, just the kind of road I probably wasn’t supposed to be on. But nothing happened, and before long I was across the Gila River and on AZ-287, the Florence-Coolidge Highway.\n\nI had deliberately made each day out of Laveen a little longer than I had wanted, in hopes of making up the lost day. AZ-287 was a bit busy, but I’ve seen worse, and the shoulder was good. I picked up my pace a bit in an attempt to make it into Coolidge before sunset.\n\nThe last obstacle was a bridge just before entry into Coolidge. It had an adequate shoulder, but not a wide one. I was sorely aware that if I tripped and fell, I would most definitely fall into traffic, and accordingly, I stayed close to the guardrail.\n\nUnfortunately, that’s where most of the accumulated road junk, including broken bottles, retreads, and loops of wire seem to settle. As I crested the bridge, I tripped in a loop of wire and instinctively reached for the guardrail with my bare left hand. The back of the guardrail was extremely rough and took the palm-size skin off three of my fingers.\n\nI wrapped a handkerchief around my hand and squeezed like there was no tomorrow. When I reached the van by the WalMart about a mile away at the day’s end marker near the Casa Grande Ruins, my fingers were already swollen and I didn’t want to let go of the handkerchief. I could tell they were going to be swollen for a while, and that this was not going to heal quickly.\n\nLeslie went into the WalMart to get some bandages, Neosporin, saline wound wash, Curlix, and other first aid supplies, and I dealt with the painful task of pulling my wedding ring off over raw flesh.\n\nMany thanks to my friend Noggy David Jaen for the Mupiricin Rx. It helped.\n\n2/18/2020: Coolidge to Wymola AZ\n\nAZ-87 was rather rural heading out of Coolidge, and as we continued onto AZ-587 and got closer to the Interstate and the frontage road I planned to run on rejoining our original route, despite the injury to my hand, my nerves calmed a bit.\n\nThe road was very quiet as I ran through Randolph and La Palma. Once we passed Eloy around mile 500, rounded the road past the Picacho School, and reached the Shell station in Wymola around 5:45 PM, I started to feel less like I’d get stopped for being on the wrong road.\n\nAlong the road I saw a couple riding their bikes, and smiled at the thought that I might be returning to developed areas pretty soon. I was anxious to get in my second rest day.\n\n2/19/2020: Wymola to Rillito AZ outside Tucson\n\nDespite the near-brush with civilization at the Shell station, the area around the Interstate frontage road was still pretty rural as I passed a sign for Red Rock. My route paralleled a railroad line, and occasionally a train would pass by. They were wonderful to look at, but also distracting, as they took my attention away from the road and masked traffic noise.\n\nThe shoulder was quite narrow in places on the frontage road, and I found myself looking for long stretches of packed dirt parallel to the road, where I could run undistracted and avoid thinking about traffic for a while.\n\nAs I got closer to Marana, I had to cross under the Interstate because the road became one-way heading toward me, and it made it difficult for Leslie and me to meet up.\n\nAs I got to Crossroads Trail and then Tangerine outside Rillito, I could tell I was nearing the developed outskirts of Tucson. There was a cool, shaded, blissful stretch running past a cement facility, whose stone entrance I sat down on for a water break. A little bit after that and I was in the suburbs, and nice houses and sidewalk were the norm.\n\nAs we reached the QuikMart at Coachline and Silverbell, I decided to push the miles a bit and get my day-end marker as close to the hotel as I could. I ran to the Walgreens at Silverbell and Cortaro, stopped my timers, packed into the van, and headed for Texas Roadhouse and our nearby hotel.\n\n2/20/2020: Rest Day in Tucson AZ\n\nAt the hotel, I ran into the couple I had met on the Interstate frontage road who had been cycling. We chatted a bit at breakfast, and they were off cycling again.\n\nLater that morning, I got a sports massage, which was a mixed blessing. I really wanted the knots out of my calves, but I also really wanted sleep. My muscles were so tight that I really couldn’t doze off on the table, and a good chunk of the time I was on edge. As soon as the therapist left, I took a nap.\n\nSomething to know about is that after lots of aerobic activity, you can become insulin sensitive. Blood sugars can drop precipitously, as they did in Odessa during my run across Texas. You can pass out, and if very unlucky, not wake up.\n\nIt must have been a very deep sleep, because I awoke to Leslie’s concerned voice–she had been trying to wake me up for 10 minutes. I tested my blood sugar and it was far from low.\n\nMy conclusion was that I had probably actually fainted from exhaustion.\n\n2/21/2020: Rillito to Green Valley AZ\n\nFrom Rillito down Silverbell to the turn at the hospital into Tucson and a couple of turns that put me onto 6th Avenue, I was happy to be running in a metropolitan area with sidewalks. South Tucson seemed a bit seedy, and once I was approached by a disturbed-looking person who had a Moses-on-the-mountain look in his eyes and talked in a stream of consciousness about my bright outfit. As I passed Children’s Hospital, a man approached and asked about the run and where he could donate.\n\nJust before exiting Tucson, I noticed there was some kind of rodeo going on on the eastern side of the road. The sidewalk had been coming and going, and the pavement was getting iffy, and I tripped and fell full-force on my elbows. Now if you’re keeping track, this was on top of the previous injury to my left hand, and I felt pretty bruised and a little more than cursed when I got up.\n\nOnce outside of Tucson, the sidewalk gave way to shoulder again and 6th Avenue turned into Old Nogales Road.\n\nSomewhere along the way I ran into Steve Henry, who has both Type 1 Diabetes and Cystic Fibrosis. Not everyone realizes it, but if you have one autoimmune disease, there’s a good chance you have another. The only question is how it’s going to be living with more than one autoimmune disease. The most common are conditions like Hashimoto’s, Sjogren’s or celiac. But CF is an auto-immune disease also, and it sucks all by itself.\n\nLet’s just say that Steve has an Iron Will. Since the road shoulder was already difficult to navigate and CF challenges Steve’s breathing, we walked for some time, about three miles if I remember, and it was some of the best fellowship I’ve had.\n\nI had planned on ambitious mileage running all the way into downtown Green Valley, but it was getting cold and the sun was going down, and under the cloud cover that had been building all day, I made it as far as the stoplight just outside town, beyond which the road narrowed and crossed ravines, with little room afforded by the guardrail.\n\nIt felt like a wise decision to cut the planned 36-mile day to around 30 and call it a win.\n\n2/22/2020: Green Valley to Nogales AZ\n\nI picked up running again the next morning at the stoplight, and the run into Green Valley, while a little chilly, was pleasant in the daylight. However, the forecast called for rain, and I kept watching the sky, wondering when it was doing to hit.\n\nI hit 600 miles. I would learn to treasure that photograph, because just over 20 miles later, due to a bug in Suunto’s software for the Ambit 3, the watch spontaneously stops recording workouts at 1000 kilometers, approximately 625 miles. It did so faithfully the very next day, February 23rd.\n\nI was concerned about how things would turn out near Amado; specifically, just south of Agua Linda, where on both sides, the Interstate frontage road gave out, and there was a Border Patrol checkpoint.\n\nI had noticed on Google Maps Street View that the section of road in question had a sign directing where bicycles should go, and I thought there was a good chance that the short 1-mile section of Interstate might also be pedestrian legal.\n\nIn fact, it was. Nevertheless, I scurried as fast as I could and as far from the road as I could to get to where the frontage picked back up.\n\nA little further south, near Tubac, there was a golf resort. It was a Saturday, and traffic near it was pretty constant. The frontage road that ran past the club was two-laned, with no shoulder and a steep slope, forcing me to walk through the soggy, tall weeds on the uneven slope next to the road.\n\nGetting past the golf course was a pain in the butt and seemed to take forever. Moreover, the clouds were starting to look ominous.\n\nLeslie and I have a rule: I’ll run in rain, but not in thunderstorms; so the question was whether it was going to storm or just rain. You could feel in the way the temperature dropped that it was going to rain soon.\n\nSure enough, somewhere between Tubac and Tumacacori, the bottom fell out.\n\nI was joined by runner Gary Bochman, who ran the next several miles with me in ordinary running gear.\n\nI was, as always, grateful for his company, since it made the time fly by. And I didn’t want to say a word about how soaked and miserable I felt.\n\nThe rest of the run into Nogales was uneventful, and thankfully, dry. As soon as I could, to avoid a dangerous snarl of merging highways north of Nogales, I got off onto Palo Parado and then Pendleton Drive, stopping at the intersection with 289, which heads to a Pilot truck stop near the Interstate.\n\nIt was with some resignation that I paused there for the day. I could tell by now that I was not going to make up mileage by trying to run 36-40 miles a day, and resolved going forward to just try to get in 30-33 miles and stop at some place I could find again on Google Maps upon heading out from the hotel.\n\n2/23/2020: Nogales to Patagonia AZ\n\nHaving one of my GPS watches stop recording and refuse to record another workout was jarring. But I’d learned to get used to that kind of thing, and at the time I felt that I could just retrieve the first 625 miles from the watch when my run was over and I’d at least have that for documentation. I was concerned with the Err 12 codes that kept repeating in the workout log after it had stopped, a sign of a corrupted workout.\n\nBut while not as accurate as the Ambit 3, my Suunto 9 baro was still working, as was my Garmin InReach GPS beacon, which recorded my progress live online for others to watch.\n\nRunning the remains of Pendleton Road went reasonably well. The road was poor quality and hilly, but it emerged onto AZ-82 east of Nogales and avoided a lot of traffic.\n\nSomewhere before the turn, I noticed a sign saying “The more I know of man, the more I like dogs.” Then I met a rather lost-looking German shepherd without a collar, whom I nicknamed Dogales, since I had seen him just outside Nogales. Dogales was friendly and playful, but he started to act anxious the longer we ran, and I sensed that maybe he had lost track of where he lived, though he wasn’t sure how far back on the road that must have been. I gave him some water to drink, and eventually, he turned and headed back.\n\nOnce outside of Nogales, AZ-82 started to turn narrow, with narrow shoulders. During our route scouting, I had been somewhat concerned about running such roads, but I had chosen the route through Nogales and along AZ-82 over an alternate route out of Tucson along AZ-83 through wine country, because by my best estimation, AZ-83 had 20-30 miles of blind hills and some pretty steep dropoffs, and the road outside Patagonia had maybe six or seven that I was concerned about.\n\nOnce I got past a somewhat narrow canyon, the shoulder improved a little, and in the hilly area just west of Patagonia, it widened considerably and was pleasant to run, or would have been if not for the rolling hills. I tried not to look uphill unless I heard traffic, and enjoyed the boost I got going downhill. The day was getting long in the tooth and I was starting to feel a little chilly, so I ran faster.\n\nAs the sun headed down over the horizon and I took my last selfie before entering town around 6:15 PM, I looked down at my gloves.\n\nThey said Patagonia.\n\n2/24/2020: Patagonia to just past Sonoita AZ\n\nAt 2 in the afternoon just outside Sonoita, I met two people, neither of which knew each other. One was Elaine, who was staying in the same hotel, Sonoita Inn, that Leslie and I were staying at. She had come to the area to enjoy some cycling, which is apparently fairly common in that part of Arizona. The other was a fellow transconner on a Surly Long Haul Trucker, heading west. I recognized the type of bike by its distinctive steel frame design and panniers. I waved him down and we exchanged greetings and well-wishes.\n\nElaine ran with me for a while until the road got iffy again, and I believe I saw her later that day on her bike, when I also met a number of other cyclists.\n\nOne asked me how far I was going and where I had started. I said, “2800 miles. Los Angeles.” She gave me a fist pump in the air and rode on.\n\nSomewhere in the vicinity of Road 900 and the Las Cienegas Conservation Area, the shoulder got narrow again. I caught the edge of my shoe on an irregularity in the asphalt on the road, tripped, and fell onto my right shoulder, damaging my Garmin InReach. There was traffic on that road, and I’m lucky that I didn’t fall too far into the road.\n\nI waited for a gap in traffic, picked up my water and electrolyte bottles, and kept going.\n\nI felt a twinge of self-pity. One hand, two elbows, and now my right shoulder and all taken a beating recently. I was beginning to wonder whether I was actually not paying attention, was losing balance, or had some other problem.\n\nBut it wouldn’t get solved where I was at the moment. I found a wide spot on the shoulder and looked at my tracker, which had taken the brunt of the impact. The screen was still on, so I plugged it into the charger that night at the hotel back in Sonoita and chalked it up to a lucky strike in a somewhat bad day.\n\nI didn’t know I had rendered the InReach non-functional until the next morning when I tried to start my workout and the device wouldn’t power up. I presume something in the internals of the device knocked the charging contacts loose, but it wasn’t anything I knew how to fix.\n\nLeslie contacted Garmin and they express shipped us a replacement.\n\nIf you’re counting, that’s two tracking devices down so far.\n\n2/25/2020: Sonoita to Tombstone AZ and Davis Road\n\nTwo days after losing the ability to track workouts on my Ambit 3, I lost the ability to track progress on my InReach. That left my Suunto 9 and the timestamped selfies, which I came to rely on increasingly, given the 9’s inaccurate sense of location and mileage. What I had hoped would serve as corroboration of more accurate tracking was now my only tracking apart from the cell phone selfies.\n\nMy Suunto 9 was becoming increasingly inaccurate. When I reached Whetstone at 9 o’clock that morning, at mile 674, the Suunto 9 stated that I had just reached 771 miles. That was over 100 miles off!\n\nI made it into Tombstone about 4:30 that afternoon and the sidewalk began again. But it didn’t last long. A good chunk of the road into Tombstone had narrow, sandy shoulder with thorn bushes.\n\nAt that point, I was looking for something positive to happen. Anything.\n\nJust then, Elaine from Sonoita rode by and waved and shouted hello. That did the job.\n\nLater in the day, we met Rick, a type 1 diagnosed in 1968, who just happened to see our van.\n\nOur mileage goals shot, our tracking half-crippled, and our nice little town-to-town itinerary now fully messed up, I continued through Tombstone toward McNeal and the turn onto Davis Road.\n\nIt had been getting challenging to find something steady about the run to hold onto, and I realized now that it was those chance meetings and words of encouragement and fellowship that were keeping me going.\n\n2/26/2020: Davis Road to Douglas AZ\n\nFirst of all, let me get this out of the way: that stuff you see on TV about tumbleweeds in the southwest? True. Coyotes and roadrunners? Somewhat true, except for the ACME explosives and the coyotes holding signs announcing their thoughts.\n\nDavis road went on for a while, and it was windy. Tumbleweeds were fairly common. I turned onto US-191 just past a school and headed south into a headwind.\n\nThe road toward Douglas was fairly desolate, the scenery didn’t change much, and there wasn’t much to look at until we got just outside of town, where both the state prison and the Bisbee-Douglas airport were. We had taken this particular road into Douglas to avoid a shorter route that went through a narrow tunnel in Bigsbee. I stopped at the nearest intersection and we decided it was best to pick up there in the morning.\n\nMy mind was already on a plateful of tacos at Asadero el Guero, and the hope of getting a new InReach the next morning.\n\n2/27/2020: Douglas to Boss Ranch Road / Apache AZ\n\nAt 7:15 AM, the InReach was waiting at the hotel front desk. Leslie figured out how to configure the basics, but it appeared set on 10-minute updates even though we had configured it online for 2-minute updates. Eventually Garmin straightened it out, though like a lot of stuff with Garmin, it seemed more complicated that it needed to be.\n\nWe were through Douglas fairly quickly, then onto AZ-80 and the open road. If anything, sections of 80 were more desolate than some of the roads I had been on. The shoulder was better, but there wasn’t much to mark our progress. We were now shooting for the New Mexico state line. Having long since been knocked off our rhythm of running from town to town, around 5:45 PM we picked a spot not far outside Apache where Boss Ranch Road crossed 80 and called it a day.\n\nWe stayed the night at a wonderful ranch just off AZ-80 that we found on Air B&B. It was run by two ladies, one of whose husband had been the owner and operator of the property before his death. They were trying to keep the operation alive, they said, but weren’t sure how long they’d continue to do it, given its location and the lack of traffic. I’m just glad it was there when we were.\n\n2/28/2020: Boss Ranch Rd / Apache AZ to Animas NM\n\nThe bulk of the day from Boss Ranch Road was spent running the remaining distance to the state line and into the vicinity of Rodeo, NM.\n\nThe shoulders on highway 80 improved once we got into New Mexico, and the running was for the most part good. Now and again on the road into Rodeo I kept spotting what looked like military vehicles with long poles mounted atop them, at the end of which were what looked a bit like searchlights. I didn’t see anyone around them, but I did spot a porta-potty that hadn’t been serviced for the last 2 years. I made the stop anyway, and as I emerged, I saw a soldier of some sort getting out of the military vehicle.\n\nI saw more of this as the miles went on, and at least judging by my experiences, I would guess the whole southern half of New Mexico is populated by Border Patrol.\n\nOnce I made the turn onto NM-9 and headed toward Animas (strangely, the name of a defunct insulin pump manufacturer), their presence was pretty much constant. At one point, I was doing my best to watch for a gap in traffic so I could relieve myself on the side of the road when I was buzzed by a helicopter. I hope they saw what they wanted to see.\n\nAlong NM-9, Leslie and I constantly kept encountering our friends from Border Patrol. At first they were very curious about what we had in the van. Once they were satisfied I really was running across the USA, they seemed to leave us alone, and as we neared Animas, one even asked about our run.\n\nWe reached our AirB&B in Animas at 4 PM and I ran the remaining distance into town to establish a start point for the next day that wouldn’t force us into long miles.\n\n2/29/2020: Animas to Hachita NM\n\nFebruary 29th was a day of extremes. It wasn’t exactly a joke that I had taken the selfie in front of a sign that said “Hurt.” My legs were feeling it, and the stretch of running days heading toward Columbus was one of my longest ones, almost 350 miles.\n\nSomewhere close to Hachita, our long-time friends Carol and Kerry Ezell, who moved not long ago from the DFW area to Las Cruces, NM, met us briefly on the highway before promising to see us again tomorrow, with Carol on her bike.\n\nWe were super-excited to see old friends, and Carol took the wonderful photo above of Leslie and me. Not only that, but the weather seemed to be warming up just a little, and I ran most of the day in a long-sleeve shirt rather than the shirt-plus-windbreaker arrangement that sometimes overheated me and tended to catch a fair bit of wind if I had it unzipped enough to cool down. The skies were clear and blue but not cloudless, and I was feeling pretty good when we got to the Hachita Food Mart, where I had previously met the owner, Jeff, on a route scouting trip. Jeff’s a long-distance cyclist and is in love with the town. It’s in the middle of nowhere, and I don’t know what’s going to happen to towns like Hachita in the long run. So if you’re out there, pay him a visit and buy something.\n\n3/1/2020: Hachita to somewhere short of Columbus NM\n\nI started my day at the Hachita Food Mart. Carol and Kerry had brought us boiled eggs, which Leslie used in my lunches of egg salad, and Leslie went in and bought something from Jeff. It was shaping up as a good day.\n\nEarly in the day, it was a little cloudy, but the weather cleared. Carol got on her bike and rode slowly across the Continental Divide, with me running on the opposite side of the road.\n\nWe were sorry to see them go, but that special treat made my day, and I was beginning to realize that it was my bonds with other people that helped hold things together during the run.\n\nMaking it all the way from Hachita to Columbus would have made it a 44-mile day, and at that point I really didn’t have 44-mile days in me. I stopped running about 20 miles short of Columbus at the Hermanas Grade, and marked the spot in Google Maps for our start point the next day.\n\nOh! And did I mention, New Mexico sunsets are stunning?\n\n3/2/2020: Into Columbus NM and a little farther\n\nI ran the remaining miles from Hermanas Grade into Columbus the next morning, with the goal of getting maybe ten miles or so past town, wherever that may be. There weren’t really any towns, abandoned gas stations, or even an intersection with a dirt road to serve as markers.\n\nOn one stretch or road, truck after truck after truck hauled dark colored steel beams, and pulled off to the south of the road where people were busy at work building miles of border wall. It accentuated just how close to Mexico we were at the time.\n\nMy Suunto 9 had gotten to the point where it was useless except as verification that at some time or other, I had run the route I was on. It said I had gone almost 1000 miles, and RideWithGPS said that we were somewhere around mile 890.\n\nI finally decided to ignore my GPS watch and just look at our progress against landmarks whose position and mileage on the route was unambiguous.\n\nThat was a challenge. My goal for the day looked clear enough on RideWithGPS: Arena, NM. But Arena had no markers. I took to noticing the mile markers when I left Columbus, and decided our best bet was to shoot for mile marker 102. That was a really poor choice since it wasn’t possible to locate it on Google Maps the next morning. We’d just have to zero out the van’s trip meter and drive the prescribed number of miles until we got closer to mile marker 102. There was a ranch nearby with a somewhat distinctive gate, and we decided to end the day there.\n\nOur adventure trying to figure out how far we really were from anywhere made me uneasy about my mileage for the last couple of days. Coming into Columbus, I thought I had gotten closer. Heading out of Columbus, I could only guess how far we were to the next marker. The markers weren’t the kind of thing you could punch into a nav system or Google Maps, which rendered them useless for daily mileage estimation; and often, my guesses were just wrong.\n\n3/3/2020: Just past Columbus to NM-9 and A-0005 outside El Paso\n\nI began to see markers for the Santa Teresa Point of Entry, 43 miles away, just west of El Paso. I knew one thing for certain, El Paso was farther than that.\n\nWe decided to split the remaining distance to El Paso into two days, in hope of getting back to our town-to-town rhythm that made it easier to understand our progress. Somewhere in the middle of all that was an intersection between NM-9 and a dirt road labeled A-0005. That was our goal for the day: 22 miles. We’d seen that the forecast was for rain, and decided that if we made it any farther than that, it was good fortune.\n\nI had made it perhaps 20 miles when the rain started coming down hard. Unlike the rain in Tumacacori, this wasn’t just miserable: it was drenching, and it was starting to affect my stride. Leslie and I conferred in the cover of the van on the roadside and talked about running farther. To do so with any success, I’d need to retape my feet, put on dry clothes and… just get soaking wet again.\n\nWith only 23 miles left to El Paso, the tape coming off my feet and blisters being re-exposed, Leslie and I looked at the weather forecast: continued rain for the next several hours, on into the next day. After that, it was supposed to be sunny again.\n\nWe decided to take our rest day one day early, stopped the tracker, and Leslie drove us to El Paso.\n\n3/4/2020: Rest Day: El Paso TX\n\nI have no photographs from El Paso. I barely remember the ride into town and finding our hotel.\n\nWhen we opened the 850-mile envelope in the Tandem care package, there was a note from my friend and fellow Type 1 Blair Ryan, who worked in their Marketing Department. I am pretty sure those aren’t my feet in the picture, but mine didn’t look much different. I was glad to peel off the tape for a day, take the gel covers off my longest toes, and just lie down.\n\nI am sure I slept well. If I recall correctly, close to twelve hours. I remember waking up around lunchtime, very hungry, but feeling much better.\n\n3/5/2020: NM-9 & A-0005 to El Paso TX\n\nMarch 5th held up to its promise of being a dry day, and the run into El Paso was much more pleasant than my previous running day.\n\nOn the north side of NM-9, out in the middle of nowhere, I spotted two largish bushes that were probably mesquite, judging by the thorns, that someone had decorated with Christmas garlands. I found this insanely amusing, and quickly posted on Facebook that I had some really good hallucinations to share (I had a running joke ever since Mecca CA that I was going to post hallucinations so people could see what i was seeing).\n\nMuch sooner than I had expected, I reached at T where NM-9 abrubtly stopped just north of Santa Teresa, and to the north the road became a busy four-lane called the Pete Domenici Highway. It had a good shoulder for a long stretch, and where it didn’t, someone had dumped dry straw into the ditch, which made for decent walking with the running wasn’t good.\n\nThere was only one section of highway that was a little dodgy, and that was where road crews were working on an area where the highway crossed over a railroad just south of Airport Freeway. I had plenty of room, but out of an abundance of caution, I walked that section.\n\nAfter that, it was downhill, and the shoulder came and went on Airport Freeway. It finally got somewhat civilized near Santa Teresa High School, and after the turn onto 273, I began to see bits and pieces of what looked like bike trail.\n\nAs I turned onto Country Club road, the sidewalk began again, actually did hit the 1000-mile mark, and as I crossed the Rio Grande, I knew I was back in Texas and finally in El Paso.\n\nAs I ran along Country Club, I was anxious not just to beat sunset, but to get to our day’s-end marker at the Krispy Kreme just east of I-10.\n\nAs headed out for dinner, our entertainment for the evening was figuring out how a pickup pulling an RV trailer had managed to get itself into a rather delicate situation about half a mile from our hotel.\n\n3/6/2020: El Paso to Butterfield TX\n\nI was relieved to reach El Paso for several reasons.\n\nFirst, because I was rejoining a route I “knew”, at least in the sense that I had run most of it before. Some parts, like the dangerous run through oilfield country and TX-302, I had eliminated by routing through Carlsbad and back into Texas via Andrews, since I no longer included in my objectives a full transit of Texas.\n\nSecond, because I was returning to the rhythm of running from one town to another, with just a few exceptions. In any case, we knew what the starting and ending points were pretty well up to the New Mexico border and once we rejoined our original route in Big Spring.\n\nBut I was also running El Paso a full two weeks earlier than I had before, and it was windier and colder.\n\nFinally, when running across Texas the previous year, I had picked San Jacinto Plaza for my starting point, as it was the closest I felt I could get to the New Mexico border without having to deal with a lot of traffic.\n\nThis time, I was actually entering from New Mexico and starting further north and west.\n\nFrom the moment I left the Krispy Kreme I could tell this was the El Paso I didn’t know. The first part of my route through town followed Country Club until it turned slowly south and turned into Mesa Street. Mesa was very hilly, and with the wind, it was slow going. The road seemed to go on and on and on, and in my mind, my run from El Paso didn’t actually start until I had turned off Mesa and onto Montana, several blocks west of a Circle K I had stopped at on my previous run across the state.\n\nReaching that Circle K was a milestone for me: I was finally back on my “usual” route, which followed Montana to US-62 / US-180 and out through the eastern side of town.\n\nWhile US-180 was a long stretch of road, it gave me some comfort to see familiar landmarks go by: the Whataburger where I had previously eaten lunch with Eric Dutcher and Leslie on my Texas run, and town markers for Las Casitas and O’Shea.\n\nI kept having to remind myself that I was starting farther west and north compared to my previous Texas run, and that running from my current day-start in El Paso to Hueco Tanks was not a 24-mile run, but a 49-mile one. I’d have to stop well short of Hueco Tanks.\n\nThe rest of the day’s run was along the wide shoulders of 180 and east past Butterfield. I ran out of sunlight shortly after the street lights discontinued at the far east end of Butterfield, a total daily mileage of 32.5 mi.\n\n3/7/2020: Butterfield to Double-U Ranch west of Cornudas TX\n\nOne of the things I had been concerned with during the US run was being out on the road and mentally “out there” so much of the time that I forgot significant events.\n\nThe day’s running was pretty uneventful.\n\nOwing to the changed starting point from Hueco Tanks to Butterfield, I wasn’t sure exactly where my day stop would be. I reached the Hueco Mountain Estates sign around 8:30 AM, then there was a Border Patrol station down the road, and then the route was nothing but long, straight roads, the occasional roadside memorial to a construction worker or pedestrian, and an assortment of ranch gates and abandoned properties the further I got out of town.\n\nI reached Desert Haven around 10:30 in the morning, and that was the last marker I encountered for a while.\n\nOur goal for the day was to make it to the Cornudas Cafe, a remote outpost of civilization that was the only indicator that the town of Cornudas even existed. But it was 40 miles from Butterfield.\n\nAbout an hour before sunset, I had gone around thirty miles and we felt like it was time to stop. We spotted a nice pulloff about ten miles west of Cornudas and took a photo at the gate of Double U Ranch, which I thought my dad might appreciate, as we had a long running joke about buying thousands of acres of remote ranchland and renaming it Muchow Ranch.\n\nMy dad was a big supporter of my efforts to raise diabetes awareness, and had been especially proud back in April 2019 when he learned that I had set a record for the fastest known run across Texas (27d 8h 36m). He followed my progress closely.\n\nUsually I’d text them with a brief message about what town I had made it to, how many miles I had run, and what town I was shooting for next.\n\nBut March 7th was Dad’s 83rd birthday. This was our exchange.\n\nDuring the run, he and Mom would worry constantly about my safety. I would reassure him that we were doing the run in the safest way possible and occasionally remind him about all the safety measures we were taking. He asked me if Leslie and I had made any plans for what might happen if we were both hit by a car. I told him yes, we had all that sorted out and not to worry, and told him I was looking forward to seeing him and Mom when I crossed the Mississippi River and ran into the town where I did much of my growing up. I told him we’d take an extra rest day and get together. He had said he hoped he could make it.\n\nIn the back of my mind, though, I got the sense that something else was on his mind.\n\n3/8/2020: Double-U Ranch to Salt Flat TX\n\nIn regard to the rain, well, that forecast was pushed out until late evening. I could tell from the building cloud cover and chilly wind that we were going to get rained on; just not when.\n\nThe remaining ten miles into Cornudas went without event. I got started around 8:30 AM or so, due to the daylight savings time change. I reached the cafe around 11:40 AM or so.\n\nIn the distance, I could now see the distinctive shape of Guadalupe Peak, the tallest mountain in Texas. My goal for the day was to stop in Salt Flat, about fifteen miles short of Guadalupe Pass, and try to do the steep run through the pass and back down the following day.\n\nThe shoulders were wide and friendly, but it was overcast and windy, and I found myself running in my high-vis rain jacket just for warmth.\n\nI reached the Salt Flat Cafe (once an abandoned Greyhound station and still sporting some of the signage) around 6:20 PM, about 40 minutes before sunset, and called it a day.\n\nOur normal Air B&B arrangement of staying in Dell City was out of the question: the owner of all the rental properties in Dell City had decided to take a hiatus from renting for a while. So that night we drove to the Pine Springs Safety Rest Area at McKittrick Canyon to stay the night.\n\nThen the rain came. And came. And came.\n\n3/9/2020: Salt Flat TX to Pine Springs / McKittrick Canyon Safety Rest Area\n\nAfter the previous night’s rain, there were only a few clouds on the horizon at my start in Salt Flat around 7:30 AM. I enjoyed the fact that we were no longer in Pacific Time and would soon be out of Mountain Time as well, meaning dawn and our day starts could move an hour later. The clouds boiled off early.\n\nEast of Salt Flat are the actual salt flats from which the town gets it name. At street level, they look like vast bony-white sparkling fields of sand. In the 1860s, the then 20-year-old state of Texas actually got involved in a minor war with Mexico over who had the rights to harvest salt from them. There’s a marker along that stretch of road to commemorate the event.\n\nIt’s hard for me to imagine anyone wanting to fight over that piece of land.\n\nAfter passing the salt flats, I was on my way the remaining twelve miles up the slow incline to the base of Guadalupe Mountain.\n\nGuadalupe Pass sneaks up on you. Most of the hills between El Paso and there (there are two of them) aren’t that big, and they come on slowly, so when you see this long road ahead of you sloping slightly up, it’s easy to think it’s just another one of those hills. Then at the base of the pass, the grade increases to about 12% for the next three miles, during which it ascends from around 3000 ft. to 5695 ft.\n\nIt’s nothing compared to the Rocky Mountains, I’m sure. But even when you know what to expect, it’s still a workout; and to make matters worse, there’s a picnic table and a scenic overlook about halfway up the grade that makes you think you’ve conquered the mountain when in reality you’re only halfway there.\n\nSomething about having run through the pass two times before (once on a training run and again on my run across Texas) made it a little bit more tolerable, and the fact that the sun was out made the wind a little easier to take.\n\nI reached the top of Guadalupe Pass around 2:45 PM, made a long-awaited restroom stop at the Guadalupe Peak Visitors’ Center, and headed down the mountain toward the Pine Springs Safety Rest Center near McKittrick Canyon.\n\nI reached the rest stop around 5:30 PM. This time, no rain, but we decided not to chance it, and instead made the 40-mile drive to Carlsbad for a stay in a decent hotel.\n\nI texted my dad to let him know we had arrived.\n\n3/10/2020: Scheduled Rest Day in Carlsbad–and Bad News\n\n“Get that rest, you deserve it!” turned out to be the last words Dad ever said to me.\n\nAt 5:30 AM, just as my wake-up alarm was to go off, Leslie woke me gently to let me know that my dad had passed away late the previous evening, just a few hours after our last text.\n\nThere were several unanswered voice messages from my brother and sisters along the lines of “call me” that had not broken through Do Not Disturb. I called them in the order of arrival, starting with my brother Walt, then my sisters, then Mom.\n\nOf course, we were all in shock. Both my eldest sister Vicki and my Mom told me that Dad “would have wanted me to finish the run” and gave me an opportunity to continue running without guilt if I chose not to attend the funeral.\n\nI decided in that moment that first of all, I would most definitely attend Dad’s funeral; secondly, that while I didn’t know offhand what would happen to the run, it would have to happen after I got back; and thirdly, that I could think of no better way to honor him than to fulfill that wish.\n\nBut everything in due time. Right now was the time for very, very difficult goodbyes.\n\n3/11/2020-3/16/2020: Hiatus for My dad’s funeral\n\nThe 1000-mile drive to Greenwood, MS, where I had once hoped to meet Dad after crossing the Mississippi was at the same time endless and hurried. I spent most of the time corresponding with family members on my cellphone, then later, friends and run followers to let them know what had happened and that I had paused the run for at least a week.\n\nThat’s him in the back with my mom, and it’s how I like to remember him: healthy, vigorous, in love with travel and food, and the glue that holds a good family together.\n\nI was touched, even overwhelmed, at the outpouring of sympathy, but something about the process of having to repeatedly acknowledge Dad’s death kept hammering it into my soul. There were times when I couldn’t look up from my phone, and times when I just stared out the window. Those moments came in waves as I thought of something important detail I forgot to mention or some person I forgot to notify.\n\nWe called the hotel in Carlsbad and told them we had checked out early and called the hotel in Greenwood to reserve a room. It all felt surreal and mechanical, like putting on your oxygen mask before the plane crashes. It was something to do, but it wasn’t the plane crash itself.\n\nDad’s funeral was held March 12th. It was heartening in some ways to see family, and a visit had been long overdue. My dad had been a NJROTC teacher during his early years in Greenwood after his retirement from the Navy. Long-time friends and former students showed up all morning during the visitation to pay their respects, and for once, I got to see just how much Dad meant to so many people.\n\nIt hit me like a gut punch when the funeral home director announced that they would be closing the casket. I went over to my dad’s side one last time, whispered “Get that rest, you deserve it”, and looked into his face until forced to keep moving. It would be last time I’d ever see it, and I wanted to remember forever the man he had been.\n\nAn ultra runner friend told me not long afterwards that the only way to fill a dad-sized hole is to grow up into the man he wanted you to be.\n\nI’m still working on that, Dad.\n\n3/17/2020: Pine Springs TX to Dark Canyon Road outside Carlsbad NM\n\nI resumed running on March 17th, a week after my dad’s passing.\n\nBeing back out on the road after the funeral was, in a word, exhausting. I was grateful to be doing something and not lost in thought about the last week’s events, but the excitement I’d anticipated in crossing into New Mexico and running into Carlsbad was now gone. It was just another slog, another day out there. The weather wasn’t great either; it was horribly windy.\n\nAt my request, Leslie took a photo of me next to a sign that said “Eddy Canyon Road.” I thought it would be an uplifting tribute to Dad but it just fell flat somehow.\n\nI tried settling back into the routine of texting my mom to let her know how far I’d gone and what I’d seen on the road, but it seemed vain and empty now.\n\nI reached Whites City around 3:00 PM and continued the run toward Carlsbad.\n\nBut I didn’t have it in me. We stopped at Dark Canyon Road, ten miles outside of Carlsbad, at 6:00 PM; and before long, I knew that the fanciful notion of a complete day’s running fitting nicely between two towns as start and end points was just that: a fanciful notion, not reality.\n\n3/18/2020: Dark Canyon Rd through Carlsbad to Halfway NM\n\nThe roads in and out of Carlsbad weren’t bad. Going into Carlsbad, sometimes there were sidewalks, sometimes sandy shoulder, and sometimes just rocks and weeds. I reached Carlsbad around 10 that morning and made the turn at the McDonalds, then was off toward Halfway NM.\n\nHeading out of town, shoulders were good, wide and flat.\n\nThere was cloud cover but it wasn’t the kind that freezes you to the bone by blocking out the sun and bringing the wind with it. Instead, the grayness just hung in the sky. It was just the perfect kind of day for running and thinking, which I did a lot of. I kept looking at the road ahead, expecting rain, but it didn’t come.\n\nI must have stopped near the intersection with CR-31, because I have a picture of it.\n\n3/19/2020: Halfway NM to Sims Rd outside Oil Center / Eunice NM\n\nWe were learning to adjust our mileage expectations down to 30-33 miles a day and be happy with it. Our goal for the day was Eunice, NM, home of URENCO, a uranium enrichment facility. Failing that, Oil Center, NM, which had a very nice park that we could spot on a map. Failing that, Sims Road just outside Oil Center. I set off that morning just after sunrise.\n\nMarch 19th was one of the strangest days I ever experienced on my USA run. The day was for the most part lightly overcast and windy, clearer and calmer in the morning than in the afternoon.\n\nAs I reached the turn onto NM-176 around lunchtime, I stopped for a quick lunch where there was enough of a pulloff for Leslie to safely park the van.\n\nThere would be spurts of truck traffic from time to time, presumably going to and from either the oilfields, the potassium fields, or the uranium enrichment facility in Eunice.\n\nAfter lunch, it got windier and the road quality went downhill quite a bit. I spotted a sign that said Marathon Road and thought it was funny. Nobody was going to run a marathon on that road.\n\nSometimes, the wind would catch my back and push me. I learned to run with my arms at my side, hands pointed toward the ground, to catch as much of the wind as I could and sail it.\n\nSongs came and went from my head, as they usually do: mostly stuff from the late sixties, seventies, and eighties. I think I get this from the the fact that in the early 1980s, I was a radio announcer, and for safety reasons I don’t wear earbuds when I run.\n\nWhat I remember most strongly from that day was humming Roberta Flack’s song, The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face, except that in my mind I heard it as “the last time ever I saw your face.” I thought of my dad and I slowed to a walk. I felt a sense of profound loss. I felt his presence in a way that was tangible and real, not ghostly, angelic, or like the hallucinations I was familiar with from my sleep-deprived Austin-to-Corpus run.\n\nWe talked for a while. I promised him I’d finish the run, and that I’d leave my running shoes at his gravesite. He said he was proud of me, that he had always been, and that I could do this. Then he said we couldn’t talk any longer, but he’d see me at the finish line.\n\nAnd then he was gone.\n\nIn his place was a feeling that maybe, just maybe, I could finish the run. And now I knew why.\n\nI reached Sims Road, about twelve miles west of the park in Eunice, a little before 5:00 PM. We drove to Hobbs, our “home base” for the next few days. COVID was on our minds, and we had begun to get picky about choosing hotels with good cleaning standards where we could stay for several days. We switched from dine-in to window pick-up, and we were just starting to become conscious of the difficulty in restocking the van at places like WalMart.\n\n3/20/2020: Oil Center / Eunice NM to somewhere outside Andrews TX\n\nSims Road to Oil Center was relatively quiet. I reached the little park in Oil Center around 1:00 PM, and we took our usual 20-minute lunch break.\n\nFrom there, the road into Eunice was long and the shoulder was wide, and I started to notice an abundance of washers of all sizes scattered on the road. From that point onward, it came to be a second habit of mine to pick up shiny or unusual looking washers, as I had done with sparkling rocks in the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts.\n\nThere wasn’t much to Eunice’s downtown, but I did find half a dozen pennies lying on the ground outside Debbie’s Country Kitchen, and it put me in a good mood. And it was nice to have sidewalk for a little while.\n\nAs I left Eunice and the sidewalk disappeared, I began to see signs for the Texas state line and Andrews County. But after running some 20 miles from Sims Road through Eunice to the Texas state line, Andrews was still 32 miles away.\n\nPast the Love’s Travel Stop we came upon the Texas state line. I wanted to run at least that far. I laughed when I saw that just on the near side of the state line was a garbage dump of some sort. It seemed that New Mexico wanted it as far from the center of the state as possible. Judging by the smell, I would have wanted the same, but I wondered how Texas felt about it.\n\nI wasn’t up for a 52 mile day, so we found a spot not far past the state line, near TX-176 and Nelson Road, with a distinctive sign that said “Barrow Ranch.” That was about 22 miles west of Andrews, which made a run into Andrews the following day seem reasonable. I stopped there around 6:45 PM and we decided to call it a day.\n\n3/21/2020: Into Andrews TX\n\nThe 22 miles into Andrews were fairly quiet and uneventful. The weather was getting misty and a bit on the miserable side, but I was handling it in my rain jacket and winter buff. I didn’t take many selfies, though, because every time I took my hands out of my mittens to take a photo, it would take forever to warm my hands back up.\n\nThe cold mist continued for the rest of the day. After twenty-two miles, I decided I had had enough. My blood sugar was low, my legs were cramping, and I was freezing. We stopped in Andrews, got a hot take-out meal, and checked into the hotel.\n\nFrom there, it was 32 miles to Tarzan, our next destination, and tomorrow’s problem, not today’s.\n\nMeanwhile, Leslie anxiously followed COVID updates in the news. There were beginning to be articles about expected lockdowns in the DFW area, and she was concerned about being stuck out on the road and having to shelter in place somewhere we didn’t actually live.\n\n3/22/2020: Andrews to Tarzan TX\n\nThe next morning the weather was better and I felt rested. We started a little after 8:30 AM, and by 3:00 PM, we were twelve miles outside of Tarzan.\n\nTarzan’s one claim to fame is a place at the intersection of TX-176 and CR-2751 called Tarzan and Jane’s Bar & Grill. It’s got a sign on the side of the building that’s hard to miss.\n\nI reached Tarzan around 6:20 PM in a good mood, ready for the next day’s run into Big Spring. Leslie drove us to the hotel. That’s when she opened up about the true level of her COVID concerns, and the news that some stores were selling out of everything.\n\nWe talked over our options: run to Big Spring and pause, try to make it to Abilene, or possibly try to make it to DFW. Each option carried with it a certain amount of risk. We were low on refrigerated supplies but could possibly make it to Abilene. If we did, though, we’d kill several days that could have been spent shopping to stock our own pantry at home, and would likely come up short. If we shopped now, way out in west Texas where people were mostly ignoring the pandemic, maybe we’d have better luck.\n\n3/23/2020: COVID decisions, the return home, and a pause\n\nThe next day, we hit three two different grocery stores in Big Spring, both of which had people on a one-roll-per-customer toilet paper ration. Leslie and I shopped separately in hopes of getting a little more of the necessities we had avoided buying while I was trying to burn up the miles.\n\nRemember that wonky issue with the Suunto Ambit 3 quitting not long after 1000 kilometers? Well, as soon as we got home, I tried to synch both Suunto Ambit 3 and Suunto 9 watches.\n\nThe image below is the last I ever saw of my workout. Notice the Err:12 in the last image. That’s Finnish for “I didn’t save your workout.”\n\nAt least I had had an inkling before that the Ambit 3 might not save my workout. I was genuinely stunned when the Suunto 9 Baro simply refused to acknowledge that it ever existed.\n\nNot that the last “999 miles” photo of the Baro’s face taken around 860 miles was that confidence-inspiring.\n\nWe unpacked the van, and I laid my gear out on the living room floor in anticipation of reloading it.\n\nI hoped sanity would return soon, people would stop panic buying, and that I’d be back out at Tarzan in a week.\n\nThen my hope waned to six weeks.\n\nThen June. In late May, I made an announcement on Facebook that we hoped to resume then, but there was a second sharp spike in COVID cases.\n\nThen, in a last false hope, I though maybe July. I had been training all through June in my desert gear in hopes of being ready to run the hot part of Texas at the worst time of year.\n\nI put all these scenarios into our trip planning spreadsheet, which had everything from its own ephemeris to calculate sunrise and sunset and adjust for time zones and daylight savings time, to indirect cell references that extracted hotel information from turn-by-turn cues and amounted to denormalized database, to integrated live and historical weather forecasting from our partner, VisualCrossing.com.\n\nI even had auto-formatting rules that coded the cold or wet days in blue and the hot days in pink (over 80 degrees F) or red (over 90 degrees F).\n\nI finally had to admit that it was too hot, things had not gotten better COVID-wise, and that I just needed to be patient.\n\nIn an attempt to teach myself patience–the one skill I realized I had not learned very thoroughly–I took to swimming, which was meditative, and to growing apple trees from seed.\n\nIt was a good reminder that things worth doing also take time.\n\n9/24/2020: Tarzan TX to Big Spring TX\n\nA full six months passed, almost to the day, before I had the opportunity to load up, suit up, and get back out on the road. We spotted a lull in COVID cases across Texas and parts of Arkansas, and set our sights for reaching the Mississippi River before another wave hit.\n\nJust before dawn, I paused before the sign I had last seen in March: “Greetings From Tarzan.”\n\nMy goal for the day was Big Spring.\n\nI resumed running in Tarzan at 7:40 AM. As I ran down TX-176, the sunrise was, as usual, stunning, tinged orange by the west Texas dust. I entered the town of Lenorah around 8:45 AM and reached the Stripes in Big Spring at the corner of I-20 frontage road and US-87 around 5:00 PM.\n\nShortly thereafter, we drove to Colorado Springs and our Air B&B, a cottage less than a mile south of our day stop.\n\nThis time, we were operating fully under our new COVID protocol: booking through Air B&B, which showed us properties that had been vacant for a week, staying at the same property for as many days as we could, given up to an hour’s drive to our day start or day end, wiping down all surfaces with Clorox Hard Surface Cleaner, and spreading a Tyvek sheet over either a large table or floor so we could lay out our gear and supplies without touching anything. We also booked only single-occupancy properties that had openable windows. In many cases, that meant a cottage or cabin in an extremely low-pedestrian-traffic area.\n\nIt had been a long time coming, but it felt good to be back on the road again, running the two-way frontage road next to I-20, and in the Land of Interstate Exit Gas Stations.\n\n9/25/2020: Big Spring to Colorado City TX\n\nI headed out of Big Spring a little before 8:00 AM, missing my desired dawn start by a little due to the drive from Colorado City. But conditions were good: light breeze, sun, and not too blistering hot, at least in the morning.\n\nI reached Coahoma around 9:00 AM. When I was running across Texas, the Dairy Queen in Coahoma was home to a feral momma cat and her kitten. During one of our scouting trips, we stopped by to check on them and the kitten was grown. This time, I didn’t stop at the Dairy Queen. I kept running, thinking good thoughts in the direction of the two cats.\n\nThe breeze died off as the day warmed up. I reached Westbrook around 3:00 PM, and Colorado City just after 4:00 PM. By then, temps were in the 90s, with the THI pushing it up another few degrees. The sun was beating down on me and I was walking some spots more than running. I was regularly plowing through my liquids and still drinking hugs quantities when I caught up with the van.\n\nAnd the next day was supposed to be even hotter.\n\nThat night, we had take-out from Kelley Cafe. It is, in the most literal sense of the word, Old School. Kelley Cafe is the brainchild of a former teacher at the converted elementary school. Brenda, the owner, simply converted the old cafeteria into an actual restaurant, rented out some of the old classrooms to local businesses, and used the old gym as a recreational facility for the town.\n\nDuring my run across Texas, we had stopped there during a downpour and enjoyed an amazingly good homestyle meal. We feared that they might have closed due to COVID, and were anxious to bring them business if they were open at all.\n\nBrenda admits it’s been tough, but yes they’re still there, she’s on top of the town’s carry-out business, and they’re actually thriving despite the odds. The world needs more places like that. Small towns only when we stop feeding them.\n\n9/26/2020: Heat, half day, and Colorado City to Loraine TX\n\nMostly because I felt like I had had it with the heat, I slept in until 9:00 AM, with the objective of getting as much sleep and food as I could. Once I had lunch (beef Vesuvio at Kelley Cafe), I felt like I could at least walk a few miles, and despite the heat, I was refreshed enough to make it another twelve miles to Loraine.\n\nThat was beneficial. I didn’t feel like I had bailed on the day, and I wasn’t trying to beat anyone’s timeline. Twelve miles was good miles, and it put us in Loraine, a little closer to Sweetwater.\n\nIt was still plenty hot, and the 12 miles into Loraine were far from enjoyable except for their brevity.\n\nAs the frontage road veered away from I-20 and toward Loraine, I ran under a railroad on a narrow road with a bit of a blind curve to it, and had to listen for traffic and time my transit under the bridge. I ran into a townsperson who asked about the run and told me if I were ever back in Loraine he’d buy me a beer. Minutes later, I reached Loraine’s abandoned downtown at 5:20 PM, ran just past it to some stone picnic tables next to the town’s police station, or perhaps it was the town hall; anyway, it had a police car parked next to it. I had remembered that area from my Texas run and it seemed like a good place to stop given our limited goals for the day.\n\nWe drove back to the cottage in Colorado City and still had time to wish my older sister a happy birthday.\n\n9/27/2020: Loraine to Eskota Road east of Sweetwater TX\n\nI got started around 6:45 AM in Loraine and was out of town before the sun was up. Loraine really didn’t have much of a downtown, so it was a matter of picking back up at the police station, town hall, park or whatever it was.\n\nI reached Roscoe around 8:45 AM and Sweetwater around 10:30 AM. Leslie had driven ahead to scout a good stopping place and discovered a lone picnic table–with shade–just off the exit to CR-304. She stopped at a Whataburger for pickup and had a mushroom, swiss, and grilled jalapeno burger waiting for me that I wolfed down along with copious amounts of diet root beer we had stockpiled in a cooler in the van.\n\nThe day was warm, but not as bad as the previous two days had been.\n\nFrom Loraine, the next towns were Sweetwater, Trent, and then Abilene. Finishing in Sweetwater would have only put us at 19 miles, and finishing in Trent would have put us at 37 miles, which I wasn’t quite sure I was up for after the previous few days’ activity.\n\nDuring my trainin"
