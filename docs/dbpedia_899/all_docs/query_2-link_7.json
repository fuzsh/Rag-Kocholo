        "text": "The Eleventh Street Bridge Project replaced the existing twin bridges that carry I-295 over the Anacostia River in the southeast quadrant of the District of Columbia. Three new bridges were constructed and improvements were made to the interchanges at both ends, including adding missing movements to and from the north onto the Anacostia Freeway (I-295/DC 295).\n\nThe two-phase project has:\n\nImproved mobility by providing separate freeway and local traffic connections to both directions of DC 295, the Southeast-Southwest Freeway (I-295/I-395), and local streets on both sides of the river\n\nProvided a shared bicycle and pedestrian path, as well as rails to allow future streetcar connections\n\nReplaced functionally deficient and structurally obsolete bridges\n\nProvided additional evacuation routes from the nation's capital\n\nIncluded new trail connections, improved drainage, and other environmental investments\n\nPhase 1 included the three bridges and most of the amenities described above. Phase 2 further improved the connection between the Southeast-Southwest Freeway and Virginia Ave. SE with the new outbound 11th Street Freeway Bridge.\n\nPhase 1 construction began December 2009 and was completed in July 2013.\n\nPhase 2 construction started in July 2012 and was completed in September 2015."
