The bridge is a significant landmark on Route 66 and is known as the place where East meets West.\n\nBuilt by the Missouri Valley Bridge and Iron Company for $180,000, the 11th Street Arkansas River Bridge is a multi-span concrete arch bridge with 18 spans set on piers sunk into bedrock. Harrington, Howard and Ash of Kansas City, a firm that designed many bridges in the Midwest, engineered the bridge. Completed in 1917 and regarded as an architectural beauty with all modern features, the bridge, at 1,470 feet long and 34 feet wide, was one of the longest concrete structures in the Midwest. It supported a railroad track in the center and single lane of vehicular traffic on each side with sidewalks adjacent to the exterior lanes. The original design included a classical balustrade and Victorian-era lighting. In 1929, the installation of new Art Deco style guardrails and lighting fixtures updated the bridge.\n\n« less\n\nFilename: The Cyrus Avery Memorial Bridge Tulsa Oklahoma 20120416-IMG_6838_39_40-.jpg From gallery: Tulsa Oklahoma Route 66 Source: Date 16 Apr 2012 Location: Dimensions: 4112x2740 td> Credit: Copyright: © Greg Disch Photography gdisch@gregdisch.com Model Release: No Property Release: No Restrictions: Direct Link: Keywords:\n\nBridges\n\nCyrus Avery Route 66 Centennial Plaza and Memorial Bridge\n\nGreg Disch Photography\n\nHighway Bridge\n\nHistoric Route 66\n\nMain Street USA\n\nOklahoma\n\nRoute 66\n\nStock Photo\n\nStock Photography\n\nStock Photos\n\nThe Mother Road\n\nTulsa\n\nUnited States\n\nrt 66\n\nOnly search this gallery"
