Max Bond Center on Design for the Just City at the Spitzer School of Architecture at the City College of New York;\n\nCarol Mayer-Reed, partner-in-charge of landscape architecture and urban design at Mayer/Reed;\n\nMichaele Pride, AIA, professor of architecture at the University of New Mexico;\n\nHarry Robinson III, FAIA, professor of urban design and dean emeritus at Howard University’s school of architecture and design\n\nDesign Challenge: Qualified firms are challenged to convert an existing freeway bridge spanning the Anacostia River in Southeast D.C. into an elevated park that unites the neighborhoods of Capitol Hill and Anacostia. The project aims to re-engage District residents with the riverfront, offer new civic space that fosters play and health, and provide environmental education. The 11th Street Bridge Park is estimated to cost $25 million to complete, with the earliest projected opening date in 2017 or 2018. The park’s backers also anticipate raising a $10 million endowment to support park programming, operations, and maintenance.\n\nGiven the unique nature of this project and its location in the nation’s capital, there has been tremendous interest from the country’s most innovative designers. Later this spring, the top four concepts will be shared with community members for feedback. The final design will be selected in fall.\n\nFor more information, go to: http://bridgepark.org/competition\n\nRopax Ferry Terminal Competition in Riga\n\n1st Place: Zaha Hadid Architects – night view from river – Render by Negativ\n\nArriving to board a ferry boat or cruise ship used to be a rather mundane experience. If you had luggage, you might be able to drop it off upon boarding, assuming that the boarding operation was sophisticated enough. In any case, the arrival experience was nothing to look forward to. I recall boarding the SS United States for a trip to Europe in the late 1950s. Arriving at the pier in New York, the only thought any traveler had was to board that ocean liner as soon as possible, find one’s cabin, and start exploring. If you were in New York City and arriving early, a nearby restaurant or cafe would be your best bet while passing time before boarding.\n\nRead more…\n\nPreparation and Organization of Design Competitions\n\n[phase 1] Benjamin Hossbach / Christian Lehmhaus / Christine Eichelmann\n\n210 × 230 mm, 192 pp.\n\nover 600 images\n\nsoftcover\n\nISBN 978-3-86922-316-2 (English)\n\nISBN 978-3-86922-240-0 (German)\n\nDom Publishers\n\n€48 in EU (For price abroad, see below)\n\nFounded in 1998 in Berlin, Phase 1 has been a principal player in the organization and facilitation of design competitions, not only in Germany, but abroad as well. The accomplishments of the firm have been well documented in three volumes—The Architecture of Competitions—beginning in 2i006. Whereas these books mainly focused on the results of the competitions they have administered, the present work, Fundamentals of Competition Management, takes one from the very beginnings of the competition process to its conclusion. The authors envisioned the publication as “three three books in one: one „blue book“ with example projects, one „yellow book“ with statements and the „white book“ with the actual guideline to competition management.”\n\nAlthough there have been a number of handbooks covering the administration of designcompetitions a study covering the entire process in such detail is a welcome addition to the the literature in this field. As a contribution to this important democratic process that has yielded exceptional design for decades, this volume is not only valid for Europe, but a current overview of the process for those globally who wish to raise the level of design by virtue of a design competition. -Ed\n\nForeign institutions wishing to obtain a copy of the book will recieve a discount to cover the cost of foreign shipping.\n\nTo obtain a copy for that offer, go to: accounting@phase1.de\n\n35 years of COMPETITIONS\n\nRecalling Some of the Most Memorable, Both Built and Unbuilt\n\nHelsinki Central Library, by ALA Architects (2012-2018)\n\nThe world has experienced a limited number of open competitions over the past three decades, but even with diminishing numbers, some stand out among projects in their categories that can’t be ignored for the high quality and degree of creativity they revealed. Included among those are several invited competitions that were extraordinary in their efforts to explore new avenues of institutional and museum design. Some might ask why the Vietnam Memorial is not mentioned here. Only included in our list are competitions that were covered by us, beginning in 1990 with COMPETITIONS magazine to the present day. As for what category a project under construction (Science Island), might belong to or fundraising still in progress (San Jose’s Urban Confluence or the Cold War Memorial competition, Wisconsin), we would classify the former as “built” and wait and see what happens with the latter—keeping our fingers crossed for a positive outcome.\n\nRead More…\n\nNew Kaohsiung Port and Cruise Terminal, Taiwan\n\nRUR model perspective – ©RUR\n\nNew Kaohsiung Port and Cruise Terminal, Taiwan (2011-2020)\n\nReiser+Umemoto RUR Architecture PC/ Jesse Reiser – U.S.A.\n\nwithFei & Cheng Associates/Philip T.C. Fei –R.O.C. (Tendener)\n\nThis was probably the last international open competition result that was built in Taiwan. A later competition for the Keelung Harbor Service Building Competition, won by Neil Denari of the U.S., the result of a shortlisting procedure, was not built. The fact that the project by RUR was eventually completed—the result of the RUR/Fei & Cheng’s winning entry there—certainly goes back to the collaborative role of those to firms in winning the 2008 Taipei Pop Music Center competition, a collaboration that should not be underestimated in setting the stage for this competition\n\nRead more…"
