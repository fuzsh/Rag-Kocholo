        "text": "Route 66 in Tulsa, Oklahoma\n\nAfter traveling through Galena, Riverton and Baxter Springs, Kansas, Route 66 entered Commerce, Oklahoma, and headed southwest through Miami, Chelsea, Claremore and into Tulsa.\n\nOnce inside Tulsa, Route 66 traversed the city east-to-west on 11th Street into downtown, crossed the Arkansas River, and headed westbound to Sapulpa, Davenport, Chandler, Arcadia and Oklahoma City.\n\nAs other segments of Route 66, alignments around Tulsa varied and improved over the years.\n\nIn general, it followed the route of present-day Interstate I-44.\n\nThe city is known for its art deco architecture in the central Deco District. Landmarks like the Philcade and Philtower buildings reflect a 20th-century construction boom fueled by the prosperous local oil industry. It is often called \"The Oil Capital of the World\". The city is home to Oral Roberts University, the University of Tulsa and the University of Oklahoma - Tulsa.\n\nTulsa International Airport (TUL) is located about five miles northeast of downtown and provides non-stop flights to cities across the country. Also located at the airport is the global maintenance headquarters of American Airlines.\n\nMap of approximate Historic Route 66 path through the Tulsa, Oklahoma area\n\nLodging and Dining Options in Tulsa\n\nTulsa, Oklahoma Travel Guide\n\nHotel listings and traveler reviews for Tulsa\n\nRestaurant reviews for Tulsa\n\nAttractions and things to do in Tulsa\n\nHighlights of the attractions to see in Tulsa\n\nThere are dozens of fun and interesting places to see and visit in Tulsa, both along and outside of Route 66.\n\nTulsa is an exciting, bustling city, an attractive destination for travelers.\n\nThe city offers a large array of museums, night life, events at the BOK Center, sports, lodging options and historic venues for visitors.\n\nTulsa has attractions ranging from trendy nightlife to first-class art museums, family fun destinations, shopping, Route 66 stops, and much more.\n\nListed below are but a few of the popular attractions in the Tulsa area.\n\nVisit TripAdvisor for a full list of things to do in Tulsa along with travelers reviews\n\n\"You Said We Couldn't Do It\" Mural\n\nThis mural commemorates a bridge built over the Arkansas River in Tulsa in 1904. The bridge wasnât for rail traffic, so investors considered it a risky project. The government wouldnât pay for it either. Instead, three citizens formed a toll company and paid for the bridge, a huge undertaking both financially and logistically due to the shifting river bed.\n\nOn the completed bridge they hung a sign, âYou Said We Couldnât Do It, But We Did.â\n\nLocated in the Meadow Gold District - 1306 E. 11th Street at S. Peoria Avenue\n\nThe Cyrus Avery Centennial Plaza\n\nTwo plazas in Tulsa celebrate Historic Route 66 and Cyrus Avery: Centennial Plaza on the east bank of the Arkansas River, and Southwest Plaza on the west bank.\n\nMap showing the key elements of the Cyrus Avery Centennial Plaza\n\nCyrus Avery Centennial Plaza looking west from the Skyway\n\nThe Cyrus Avery Centennial Plaza is named for the Tulsa resident who is known as \"The Father of Route 66\". It is located at the east entrance to the historic Route 66 bridge near downtown Tulsa. The first phase of the plaza, dedicated in 2008, included a display of flags from all eight states through which Route 66 traversed.\n\nA Skyway with observation deck leads pedestrians from the visitors parking lot across Southwest Boulevard to the plaza.\n\nThe park and sculptures are an artistic representation of the use of automobiles and highways spreading across the country in the late 1920s and 30s. Future plans for the Avery Centennial Plaza include a visitor’s center and the Route 66 Interpretive Center, to be located on the hill beside the Skywalk. It will feature Route 66 exhibits, historical perspectives, restaurants and gift shop.\n\nCentennial Plaza is located at the east entrance to the historic bridge at the intersection of Southwest Boulevard and Riverside Drive.\n\nA visit to Centennial Plaza is highly recommended for Route 66 fans!\n\nView of Skyway looking west\n\nView of bridge from Skyway\n\nObservation walkway under I-244, looking east, old Route 66 bridge & Skyway to the right\n\nThe Sculptures\n\nEast Meets West: Symbolic Route 66 Midpoint\n\nThe scene in Centennial Plaza depicts the Avery family riding west in a Motel T Ford, meeting an eastbound horse-drawn carriage. He, his wife, his daughter and their pet cat are all in the Model T traveling down Route 66. They suddenly come across an oil field waggoneer whose team of horses are scared by the new sounds of a combustion engine. The sculptures are the work of Robert Summers.\n\nRoute 66 Bridge Over the Arkansas River\n\nDirectly west of Cyrus Avery Centennial Plaza is the original Eleventh Street Bridge bridge built in 1915 to carry Route 66 over the Arkansas River. It is located between newer bridges on Southwest Boulevard and Interstate 244, and was closed to traffic in 1980 although it remained open for pedestrians for a time.\n\nGates were locked on the bridge in 2008, and it remains closed to both vehicular and pedestrian traffic today. The old bridge is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and re-named the Cyrus Avery Route 66 Memorial Bridge.\n\nOther Attractions Around Tulsa\n\nThe Healing Hands sculpture, on the campus of Oral Roberts University in Tulsa\n\nIt is the largest bronze sculpture in the world, and towers 60-feet high.\n\nEarlier Times on Route 66: Vintage Views of Tulsa\n\nWhat was Route 66 like in its earlier years, as visitors drove around or through Tulsa? What did all the service stations, motels and public buildings look like when they were new?\n\nWhat did the traveling public experience on the Mother Road? We wonder such things when we travel Route 66 today.\n\nThose earlier times in the 1930s, 40s and 50s were not always captured on film. But the use of colorful postcards was common in those decades.\n\nWe have included below a sampling of our collection of vintage travel postcards showing scenes in Tulsa. These portray the city in its earlier years and help us to visualize \"yesterday\" as we drive Route 66 today.\n\nWill Rogers Motor Court\n\nBordens Restaurant\n\nCooks Court\n\nAnchor Court\n\nLittle Mexico Restaurant\n\nDowntown Motel\n\nInteractive Map of Tulsa Oklahoma\n\nRoute 66 Road Trips in Oklahoma\n\nKansas to Tulsa\n\nTulsa to\n\nOklahoma City\n\nOklahoma City to\n\nTexas\n\nMORE OKLAHOMA ROUTE 66\n\nOklahoma Route 66 Passport\n\nThe Oklahoma Route 66 Passport from the Oklahoma Tourism & Recreation Department helps Route 66 travelers find new destinations to explore and document their progress along the way.
