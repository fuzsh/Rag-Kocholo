        "text": "Tulsa was founded in 1879 with the establishment of its first post office. The town has deep Native American roots. The Creek Indians from Alabama were relocated here in the 1880s. In fact the town was originally called Tulsey Town for this Indian community. The railroad came to town in 1882 insuring Tulsa's economic growth. I guess the real clincher for an up and coming Oklahoma town was the oil boom brought on by the first commercial well located across the river in Red Fork in 1901.\n\n1916 photo of the new 11th Street Bridge.\n\nThe famous 11th Street Bridge over the Arkansas River was completed in December 1915. When Route 66 became a reality this was the bridge used to channel a nation on the move west. Tulsa's expansion into the west bank of the Arkansas River was due in large part to this wonderful bridge. The design and detail of the 11th Street bridge is a beautiful example of early Art Deco style. This bridge was used from 1916 through 1972 then it was discontinued when the Interstate bypassed it.\n\nNot too long ago the 11th Street Bridge was almost forgotten, but the resurgence of interest in Route 66 has brought about a revival in everything Route 66 and the 11th Street Bridge is no exception.\n\n11th Street Bridge Roadside Attraction\n\nMichael and Suzanne Wallis give the dedication speech ~\n\n\"This bridge and places like it are here to remind us of the times before America became generic.\"\n\nJim and Hampton V.P. William Edmundson at the ceremony.\n\nTulsa Mayor Bill Lafortune extols the merits of Tulsa.\n\nThe 11th Street Bridge is certainly a sight worth seeing. Suzanne and Michael Wallis along with Joy Avery, Cyrus Avery's granddaughter, support the efforts of historic preservation.\n\nHampton executives William Edmundson and Melissa OBrien join the 66 Caravan for this historic event.\n\nSand Springs Hampton employees join in the celebration of the 11th Street Bridge.
