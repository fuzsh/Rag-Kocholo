        "text": "The 11th Street bridge in Covington, which spans above the CSX railroad tracks between Madison Avenue and Russell Street is set to be demolished, years after the project was first announced.\n\nThe Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC) said Monday that work would begin on March 15.\n\nThe bridge was closed to vehicular traffic in 2013. “Based on recent inspections, ongoing deterioration of the structure has continued,” said Rob Hans, then-chief district engineer for KYTC District 6, in Covington, at the time. “For future safety of the traveling public, the Cabinet made the decision that the closure of this structure is warranted.”\n\nIn 2015, it was announced that when a new bridge is constructed, it would be strictly for pedestrians.\n\nThe new 12-foot-wide pedestrian bridge will be constructed in the same space. The new span will provide a safer connection for neighborhoods, a news release said.\n\nKYTC will work with CSX and its train schedule during this project.\n\nThe $777,000 project was awarded to Louisville Paving and Construction.\n\nCity Manager David Johnston said that the span was a critical connection for pedestrians.\n\n“The city continues to work with many groups and agencies to improve walkability within our community,” Johnston said. “This important project ensures pedestrian access from Covington’s Westside and Old Seminary Square neighborhoods to Cathedral Square.”\n\nIt has an Aug. 15, 2021 completion date.\n\nThe 15th Street bridge four blocks south has also been closed to vehicles for years, and is also expected to be replaced at some point. When it reopens, it is expected to accommodate vehicles.\n\n-Staff report"
