        "text": "Clarification: Some photo captions with this story originally identified twin bridges as Bird Creek bridges. The bridges cross part of the Verdigris River, but are known locally as the Bird Creek bridges. There is also a sign indicating the bridges cross Bird Creek.\n\nThe one bridge along Route 66 that Jim Ross is perhaps the proudest of discovering is one that doesn’t exist.\n\nRoss, who has written several books about the 2,451-mile highway nicknamed “The Mother Road,” has spent the better part of the last three years putting together his most recent work, “Route 66 Crossings” (University of Oklahoma Press, $29.95), a photographic chronicle of the hundreds of bridges along the route.\n\nThe book documents the varying types of bridges that are still in use, from modest timber structures over dry creekbeds in New Mexico to the massive, steel-girded Chain of Rocks Bridge over the Mississippi River that links Illinois and Missouri.\n\nOne section is devoted to bridges, such as Tulsa’s Cyrus Avery Memorial Bridge (formerly the 11th Street Bridge), that are protected as part of the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nAnother chapter focuses on bridges that are now derelict, victims of changes to Route 66 itself.\n\n“That’s something I don’t think a whole lot of people understand,” Ross said, speaking by phone from his home near Arcadia. “Route 66 came into being in 1926, and almost immediately began to change. Sometimes those changes were to accommodate flooding problems, or create a more uniformly paved road.”\n\nThe only problem, Ross said, is that the documentation for these changes, most of which were done 70 to 80 years ago, is buried in the archives of various state transportation departments.\n\n“They’d map out a project, and once it was finished, they roll the plans up and squirrel them away,” Ross said. “But that’s always been a fascination of mine — to discover and verify all these little details about Route 66.”\n\nOne of those little details concerned a bridge that had once spanned the Cottonwood Wash near Winslow, Arizona.\n\n“There are more derelict and abandoned Route 66 bridges in Arizona than any other state,” Ross said. “The bridge that is there now was built in the 1930s, but all that remains of its predecessor was a single concrete pier.\n\n“I was working with the Arizona Historical Society, and they sent me a photograph of what they said was the original bridge,” he said. “But I knew because of the landscape that it had to be mislabeled.”\n\nOne of the society’s archivists dug into the records to locate the original prints and finally turned up the image that appears in the book.\n\n“It was a pure, freak accident that I was able to include this in the book,” Ross said. “And it was due to this person taking it on themselves to go the extra mile.”\n\n“Route 66 Crossings” contains 727 photographs, more than half of which Ross took himself.\n\n“One thing I really tried to do was to make this a book that would appeal as much to the casual reader as to the real hardcore Route 66 history buff,” Ross said. “I wanted to document what is still there, as well as what’s now gone, but still have something that people would enjoy looking at.”\n\nRoss, whose previous books on Route 66 include “Oklahoma Route 66” and “Route 66 Sightings” (this one co-written with Shellee Graham and Jerry McClanahan), said the idea for a book on the bridges of Route 66 first came to him about a dozen years ago.\n\n“I kicked the idea around with a friend of mine, but nothing really came of it,” he said. “But after ‘Route 66 Sightings’ was published in 2011, he asked what my next project would be. I didn’t have an idea, so he just looked at me and said, ‘Bridges.’ ”\n\nRoss’ fascination with Route 66 began when he watched the “Route 66” TV series in the early 1960s.\n\n“Then life happened and I forgot about it,” he said. “Then, when I was about 40, I came across Michael Wallis’ ‘Mother Road’ book, and that really rekindled my interest. I started to travel the route and got really interested in all the different paths it had taken over the years. And the bridges are an important part of that.”\n\nJames D.
