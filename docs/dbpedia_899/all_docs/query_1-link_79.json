        "text": "Tulsa Oklahoma Route 66 Photography\n\nTulsa is the second-largest city in the state of Oklahoma and 47th-most populous city in the United States. Tulsa was settled between 1828 and 1836 by the Lochapoka Band of Creek Native American tribe. For most of the 20th century, the city held the nickname “Oil Capital of the World” and played a major role as one of the most important hubs for the American oil industry.\n\nIn 1925, Tulsa businessman Cyrus Avery, known as the “Father of Route 66,” began his campaign to create a road linking Chicago to California by establishing the U.S. Highway 66 Association in Tulsa, earning the city the nickname the “Birthplace of Route 66”. Once completed, U.S. Route 66 took an important role in Tulsa’s development as the city served as a popular rest stop for travelers, who were greeted by Route 66 icons such as the Meadow Gold Sign and the Blue Whale of Catoosa. During this period, Bob Wills and his group, The Texas Playboys, began their long performing stint at a small ballroom in downtown Tulsa. In 1935, Cain’s Ballroom became the base for the group, which is largely credited for creating Western Swing music. The venue continued to attract famous musicians through its history, and is still in operation today.\n\nTulsa Oklahoma Route 66 Photo Gallery\n\nImages available for browsing or purchase through PhotoShelter.\n\nBrowse Images\n\nCreate and Save Personal Lightboxes\n\nPurchase Licensing Rights\n\nDownload High Resolution Files\n\nDownload Personal Use Files\n\nOrder Prints\n\nOklahoma Route 66 Photo Galleries\n\nMy name is Greg Disch and I am a freelance photographer with a passion for taking photos of Route 66.
