        "text": "The Two RV Gypsies: Full-Time RVers\n\nat The 11th Street Bridge on Route 66\n\nSouthwest Blvd in Tulsa, OK\n\nOctober 13, 2022\n\nThe 11th Street Bridge was completed in December 1915 to carry vehicles across the Arkansas River at Tulsa, Oklahoma. Used from 1916 to 1972, it was also a part of U.S. Route 66. Functionally, it has been replaced by the\n\nI-244 bridges across the Arkansas. At present, the bridge is in poor structural condition and unsafe even for pedestrians. In 2008, the gates were locked to exclude all visitors.\n\nThis bridge was added on December 13, 1996, to the National Register of Historic Places under Criteria A and C. Its NRIS number is 96001488. It was named the \"Cyrus Avery Route 66 Memorial Bridge\" in 2004.\n\nAlthough the bridge still stands, it is considered unsafe for use and has been closed to vehicles since 1980 and to pedestrians since 2008.\n\nBelow: A skyway with an observation deck lead the two RV Gypsies from the visitors' parking lot across Southwest Boulevard.\n\nBelow: Cyrus Avery Centennial Plaza is located adjacent to the east entrance of the historic Bridge in Tulsa, at the intersection of Southwest Boulevard and Riverside Drive. See the old bridge and the new bridge in the photo below.\n\nBelow: Another short bridge with interesting signs. But it just led to a dead-end.\n\nShame on the person or people who put graffiti on the bridge."
