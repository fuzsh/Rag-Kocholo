        "text": "Taste of Cherry is a 1997 film by the Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami. It is a minimalist film about a man who drives through a city suburb looking for someone who can carry out the task to bury him after he has died. It was awarded the Palme d'Or at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nWhile reading a novel by Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf on the bus, Ali Sabzian strikes up a conversation with a pretty girl, Mahrokh Ahankhah. When she tells him her family admires Makhmalbaf's work, Ali pretends to be the filmmaker to impress her. Becoming friendly with the Ahankhahs, Ali tells them he is preparing a new movie, but when they uncover his true identity, he is arrested for fraud. This film reenacts the true story of the incident, with Ali and the family playing themselves.\n\nWhen Nader (Payman Maadi), a bank employee, refuses to leave Tehran, his wife, Simin (Leila Hatami) sues for divorce in the hope that she can make a better life for their young daughter abroad. Needing someone to care for his senile father while he's at work, Nader hires Razieh (Sareh Bayat), a married woman whose chador hides her pregnancy. One day, after becoming angry with Razieh, Nader shoves her, and she has a miscarriage, leading Razieh's husband to take Nader to court.\n\nBaran is a 2001 Iranian film directed by Majid Majidi, based on an original script by Majid Majidi. The movie is set during recent times in which there are a large number of Afghan refugees living on the outskirts of Tehran. Almost a silent movie, Baran won a number of awards both nationally and internationally for the director and writer Majid Majidi.\n\nWhen young Ali (Amir Farrokh Hashemian) accidentally loses the only pair of shoes his little sister Zahra (Bahare Seddiqi) owns, the siblings attempt to hide the bad news from their poverty-stricken father (Mohammad Amir Naji) and ill mother (Fereshte Sarabandi). They devise a scheme to share Ali's own pair of worn sneakers until they can find a new pair of shoes for Zahra. This documentary-like film was shot on location in some of Tehran's poorest areas."
