        "text": "J.B. Kish’s story “Through the Middle” was published in Metaphorosis on Friday, 9 December 2022.\n\nA few years ago, I drove past a restaurant and found myself jotting down the concept for a new story: Guy pays $300 for the best hamburger someone can make. It didn’t mean much to me at the time. I actually had no idea why someone would pay so much for a hamburger of all things. But I liked the imagery, and even though the idea would spend years collecting dust in my notes folder, it stuck with me.\n\nThis is how most of my stories come together. I capture small vignettes like that until I begin to see connective tissue. In the case of Through the Middle, the three notes that acted as the story’s foundation were:\n\nGuy pays $300 for the best hamburger someone can make\n\nDiner in the middle of nowhere\n\nWhat if aliens didn’t come from above, what if they came from below\n\nI spent days mashing these ideas together, writing various outlines for how they might work. Sometimes the ideas just won’t gel, no matter how hard I try. But “Through the Middle” was one of those wonderful, rare occasions where the story quickly began to tell itself.\n\nSubscribe to our e-mail updates so you’ll know when new stories go live."
