        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nLow back pain (LBP) is a major cause of disability and health care cost in the world (Hoy et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2013). LBP is often associated with intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, although the relationship between IVD dysfunction and pain is complex and multi-factorial (Livshits et al., 2011). Gross characteristics of painful IVD degeneration includes the presence of fissures in the annulus fibrosus (AF), structural changes of the endplates (EPs), and collapse of the AF leading to disc height loss (Cheung et al., 2010; de Schepper et al., 2010; Videman et al., 2008). IVD degenerative pathologies have been sub-divided into two distinct phenotypes: AF-driven and EP-driven degeneration (Adams and Dolan, 2012; Battie et al., 2008). The mechanism through which these two distinct phenotypes lead to painful IVD degeneration is complex and likely associated with mechanical and biological factors, including mechanical hypermobility, structural change, inflammation, and sensitization of neurons (Evashwick-Rogler et al., 2018; Ohtori et al., 2015; Purmessur et al., 2008). The EP is known to play a key role in the development of IVD degeneration and LBP, although work is required to determine the mechanical mechanisms governing EP damage and its progression to EP damage, bone marrow lesions and LBP (Fields et al., 2018).\n\nIt is necessary to investigate possible different biomechanical characteristics and mechanisms of AF and EP phenotypic injuries in a controlled animal model in order to gain more understanding of lumbar discogenic pain mechanisms in the human condition. Rat lumbar models are commonly used in discogenic pain animal models because the model is inexpensive, the evaluation of pain-like behavior in rats is relatively facile (Hwang et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2011a; Lai et al., 2015, 2016; Lee et al., 2009; Miyagi et al., 2013; Mosley et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2009), and the rodent IVD has been mechanically validated as a suitable model of the human disc (Elliott and Sarver, 2004). Rat models are commonly used to determine the pathophysiology of discogenic pain, and AF puncture injury is the most commonly adopted approach to induce IVD degeneration in animal models. Biological and biomechanical changes in response to AF injury have been widely investigated (Elliott and Sarver, 2004; Hwang et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2011a, 2011b; Lai et al., 2015, 2016; Lee et al., 2009; Miyagi et al., 2013; Mosley et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2009). Specifically, AF injuries lead to IVD degeneration with spinal instability, disc height loss, and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and pain-related behaviors (Elliott et al., 2008; Han et al., 2008; Keorochana et al., 2010; Michalek et al., 2010). Furthermore, pain-related behaviors were correlated with disc height loss, intradiscal cytokines, and sensitization of dorsal root ganglion (Lai et al., 2016). It has been shown that larger AF injuries more repeatably result in specific biomechanical property changes and severe IVD degeneration, and this severe IVD degeneration can cause endplate lesion and degeneration (Elliott et al., 2008; Fujii et al., 2020; Han et al., 2008; Keorochana et al., 2010; Michalek et al., 2010). AF and EP defects are expected to result in distinct biomechanical phenotypes (Iatridis et al., 2013), yet this has not been investigated.\n\nThe role of endplate disruption in biomechanical instability and the development of discogenic pain requires further elucidation. Crock (1986) proposed that endplate microdamage is an initiating factor in the “internal disc disruption” of IVD degeneration (Crock, 1986; Han et al., 2016; Peng et al., 2009; Rade et al., 2018). In clinic, EP injuries occur in peripheral and central areas, and trauma-induced endplate innervation is a potential contributor to back pain (Lotz et al., 2013). Surgically removed herniated tissue has also been found to usually contain cartilaginous endplate (CEP) (Hao et al., 2020; Lurie et al., 2013; Rajasekaran et al., 2013; Yaman et al., 2017) and CEP avulsion at the cartilage-vertebral endplate junction may be the most common type of lumbar herniation (Rajasekaran et al., 2013) ( ). In patients with Modic changes, the extruded disc tissue included parts of CEP 63% of the time (Joe et al., 2015; Schmid et al., 2004). Biomechanically, focal microdamage weakens the endplate and allows nucleus pulposus (NP) bulge into the vertebral body (Adams et al., 2000). Biologically, this breach of the endplate by the NP may induce an autoimmune reaction which could cause Modic changes and disc degeneration (Crock, 1986; Dudli et al., 2016, 2018; Lotz et al., 2013) ( ). While EP is implicated in many painful conditions, the role of an EP disruption in biomechanical instability and as an initiator of painful IVD degeneration is less clear, requiring the development of an EP driven injury model in animals.\n\nAn EP-driven IVD degeneration in rat model would inform the pathophysiological progression from EP disruption to IVD degeneration and pain, and inform potential therapeutic avenues. In developing an EP injury model, this study focused on precise injury creation and biomechanical characterization using an ex vivo model. The objective of this study was therefore to i) establish an EP injury model in rat spine, and ii) evaluate the biomechanical role of EP in lumbar stability by characterizing ex vivo IVD biomechanical behavior changes following EP injury and comparing these changes to those following AF injury using a rat model. Rat lumbar IVDs were evaluated with cyclic axial and torsional biomechanical tests from intact to injury status. Stiffness, range of motion, neutral zone and hysteresis parameters were calculated. The findings of this study can give insight into the importance of endplate injury for the onset of IVD degeneration and pain, and also describe an endplate injury model for further ex-vivo and in-vivo studies.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nCurrent clinical diagnosis and treatment for EP-driven pain and IVD degeneration have limited efficacy and EP changes are associated with a high incidence of pain-associated complications (Lama et al., 2014; Ninomiya et al., 2017; Rajasekaran et al., 2013; Tanaka et al., 1993; Wang et al., 2019). In the clinical setting, it is difficult to differentiate endplate-driven from AF-driven pain. Furthermore, EP disruption can occur in clinical spinal trauma cases with vertebral body fracture (Wang et al., 2012, 2013). To better understand the role of EP injuries and EP-driven IVD degeneration, this study established an EP injury model in rat lumbar spines through a transcorporeal approach and evaluated the ex vivo axial and rotational biomechanical properties after EP injury compared to AF injury. Lumbar EP injury substantially affected axial biomechanical behaviors while AF injury most strongly affected torsional properties. This study therefore demonstrated methods for creating an EP injury in rat lumbar spines that can eventually be translated to an in vivo model while also demonstrating distinct biomechanical phenotypes of AF and EP injury.\n\nEP injury had the greatest effects on axial biomechanical properties. Since axial biomechanical properties indirectly assess intradiscal pressure, AF tension, and IVD laxity (Iatridis et al., 2013; Mosley et al., 2019), we show EP injury substantially influences these biomechanical functions. The effects of EP injury on axial biomechanical properties are consistent with an ex vivo sheep study with trans-endplate nucleotomy (Johannessen et al., 2006). Furthermore, the EP injury model in this study did not affect segmental rotational stability, consistent with a transpedicular endplate injury in ovine spines (Russo et al., 2017). Russo et al. used different experimental test protocols and parameters so we cannot directly compare torque range or torsional stiffness across studies. Furthermore, the ovine model requires adequate percutaneous transpedicular skill, a fluoroscopy facility, and ovine models have higher economic and ethical costs that are more appropriate for advanced translational studies. EP fracture in a rabbit organ culture model from axial compression impact loading was more important than the amount of mechanical energy applied in causing IVD degeneration changes including increased apoptosis, catabolism and pro-inflammatory activity (Dudli et al., 2012). Therefore, we determined that the creation of an EP injury was more important than the application of axial compression overload, which would be very challenging to apply to the lumbar spine in a controlled manner in vivo. Hence, the rat model fills a gap on a small animal EP injury model that would better enable screening of experimental and early-stage treatment strategies. Rat IVD degeneration models offer the benefit of faster healing times, well-characterized behavioral assays to evaluate pain-like behaviors and relatively low expense compared to larger animal models (Lai et al., 2015, 2016). The rat model is limited by its small size and need to apply a surgically-induced injury. Certain procedures like a transpedicular EP injury would be very difficult to perform repeatably in rats. We therefore developed the anterior transcorporeal approach to puncture the end-plate and leave the AF intact. The anterior approach was sufficiently accurate to yield repeatable biomechanical changes in this in vitro study. An anterior approach is similarly used for rat in vivo studies with anterior AF puncture injuries in the lumbar IVDs (Lai et al., 2015, 2016). We recently applied these methods in vivo with a similar anterior transcorporeal approach to induce EP injury using fluoroscopic guidance in ongoing in vivo studies (Wang et al., 2022).\n\nEP damage arising from repetitive loading is most likely a common event in life since the EP serves as the vertebra-IVD interface between the hard and soft tissues. The EP is at risk of damage since it must serve dual and potentially conflicting roles. First, the central EP needs to support axial physiological compression yet remain structurally porous to facilitate metabolite transport between the NP and vertebral body. In contrast, the peripheral EP also serves as an attachment site for the annulus fibrosus and its penetrating Sharpy’s fibers. Under axial loading, high peak shear strains occur at the EP near the inner AF likely due to the AF curvature and oblique fiber insertion site angles, and these shear strains may be a cause of EP damage under high compressive loads (O’Connell et al., 2007). In a human cadaveric biomechanical study, high compressive loads applied to simulate unsafe lifting led to frequent early EP failure (Amin et al., 2020). Interestingly, mechanical indentation testing has shown that the peripheral endplate is stronger than central zones in human lumbar vertebrae (Bailey et al., 2011; Grant et al., 2001). Endplate disruption was detected in a cadaver study and found to occur in 76% of post-mortem specimens aged 13–96 years in 50 cadavers (Adams and Dolan, 2012; Hilton et al., 1976). This finding supports the concept that the central EP is more prone to damage. In this study, we therefore induced EP injuries in the central EP to approximate some of the EP damage observed clinically. The EP injury with a 26G needle (0.46 mm outer diameter) created a central EP disruption of approximately 1–10% of the average rat lumbar EP surface area (Jaumard et al., 2015). This surgically-induced puncture injury does not directly correspond to clinically observed EP damage, yet the size of this relatively minor disruption falls between microfracture and traumatic burst fracture.\n\nEP and AF injury are previously reported to cause distinct biomechanical changes to motion segments (Iatridis et al., 2013). In the current study, EP injury exhibited significant alterations in nearly all of the axial biomechanical properties but not torsional properties. EP disruption reduces intradiscal pressure, and consequently AF fiber tension decreases, which is most directly associated with significantly increased axial ROM and decreased axial tensile stiffness. EP injury in the current study resulted in increased axial ROM, hysteresis, and decreased axial NZ stiffness, tensile stiffness, and fast time constant when compared to Intact. The EP injury therefore induces axial mechanical hypermobility and directly indicates the crucial role of the EP in axial motion segment biomechanical stability in a small animal model. Stress relaxation fast time constant was significantly reduced by EP injury, further suggesting IVD depressurization. The fast time constant is associated with IVD bulge and NP fluid flow while the slow time constant is more related to permeability and AF fluid transport (Masuoka et al., 2007; O’Connell et al., 2011). Vresilovic (Vresilovic et al., 2006) reported that trans-endplate partial nucleotomy significantly increased the short time constant in stress relaxation in sheep lumbar spine ex vivo. However, they did not evaluate the effect of endplate violation without nucleotomy on stress relaxation behavior which could result in tissue compaction thereby altering IVD bulge and NP fluid flow behaviors.\n\nThe current study, in the context of the literature provides a potential biomechanical mechanism for progressive IVD degeneration from EP disruption. EP injury in this study caused IVD depressurization as assessed with increased axial laxity and decreased fast time constant consistent with more rapid IVD bulge and accelerated NP fluid flow. EP injury induced in a porcine model by Holm et al. (2004) who drilled a 3.5 mm hole through the endplate observed EP injury induced degeneration of the adjacent IVDs that included AF lamellar disruption. Using cadaveric spines, Adams et al. postulated that damaged EP enlarges the volume to the NP resulting in a IVD depressurization, leading to the collapse of the inner layer of the AF into the decompressed NP region (Adams et al., 2000).\n\nAF injury has a large effect on rotational stability since torsional parameters are sensitive and strongly affected by AF fiber integrity (Krismer et al., 1996; Michalek et al., 2010). In this study AF injury significantly decreased torque range and torsional stiffness consistent with the literature. In contrast, for axial properties, AF injury only significantly decreased compressive stiffness which may indirectly result from NP depressurization due to loss of AF fiber tension. The literature indicates that AF puncture can cause greater changes in axial biomechanical properties than reported in this study including alterations in axial NZ stiffness and axial ROM (Elliott et al., 2008). Differences between studies can be explained considering injury severity and puncture methods since severity of AF puncture injury influences the amount of NP depressurization which plays a dominant role in compressive mechanics (Michalek et al., 2010). To create a more consistent and severe AF injury, we performed a 3 times needle puncture, which is similar to Kim et al. (2005) who found repeatable and severe IVD degeneration on histology and MRI grading of rabbit IVDs with a 3 times needle puncture using 21 G needle puncture. Furthermore, in rats in vivo, Muralidharan (Muralidharan et al., 2017) found chronic mechanical LBP and IVD degeneration in rats in vivo using 5 and 10 times AF punctures using a 25G needle.\n\nThe biomechanical changes with EP injury in this study may help explain some clinical observations. Splendiani et al. (2019) compared supine and standing MRI reporting that reported greater spinal loading from standing resulted in Modic I modifications and increased pain. Splendiani et al. speculated that these changes were due to EP cracks that enable rapid water redistribution and IVD dehydration when imaged in the standing posture. This study found EP disruption caused axial instability and reduced fast time relaxation which may help explain the Modic I changes, IVD dehydration, and pain provocation observed in the patients of Splendiani et al. Therefore, the current study along with the literature (Hao et al., 2020; Lotz et al., 2013; Russo et al., 2017; Splendiani et al., 2019) suggest that axial mechanical pain might be a character of EP-driven low back pain in clinical studies. Future in vivo studies with this EP-driven rat model may help inform the relationships between EP disruption, IVD pathology, and pain.\n\nSome limitations of this study are important to mention. We did not repair the transcorporeal tunnel with PMMA bone cement and it therefore cannot fully simulate the clinical IVD degenerative condition of endplate disruption with an intact vertebral body. However, the ex-vivo EP defect itself is generally consistent with the size and location of EP injuries observed in clinical studies (Wang et al., 2012, 2013). Furthermore, we believe that use PMMA or another way to seal the transcorporeal tunnel would be a complicated confounder in future in vivo studies applying this EP injury model. The needle stopper prevented penetration depth beyond 3 mm, so there is little risk of the needle in the EP injury damaging the inner AF. Nevertheless, a few samples exhibited the presence of vertebral endplate tissue in the intervertebral space ( ) which could result in some IVD disruption beyond the damage from the EP puncture injury. For example, small amounts of subchondral bone that displaced into the NP following injury could account for some of the variance observed some in axial range of motion and NZ stiffness values. We note that statistical analyses confirmed normality of the data and parametric and non-parametric analyses on these variables yielded nearly identical statistical findings. Clinically important EP disruptions commonly involves Modic changes with inflammation, bone turnover, and fibrosis (Dudli et al., 2016) ( ) requiring an in vivo model to simulate. We selected male rats in this study since their motion segments are somewhat larger and we did not expect anatomical differences in spinal anatomy across sexes to affect our comparisons between EP and AF injury. However, we note that sex differences in pain-related behaviors and inflammatory responses so that future in vivo studies need to consider sex as a biological variable (Mosley et al., 2019, 2020). AF injury involved three punctures while the EP injury had only a single puncture, although that did not influence our ability to detect significant differences in injury type that were comparable in magnitude even with the differences in numbers of punctures. Finally, some variability was observed in parameters due to the complexities of dissecting, potting and testing procedures on these small motion segments that can be quantified from the variances observed in the Intact group, and this did not influence our ability to detect significant differences across injury groups. Considering these limitations, we believe we can still conclude that EP injury caused repeatable biomechanical changes that were distinct from AF injury and Intact conditions."
