Jarzen, a plant scientist, had pollen from an ancient tree that bore a similarity to pollen from a modern tree — a big, flashy, red-flowered tree in New Zealand. So that’s what Kish painted.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles from Elizabeth Payne, David Pugliese, Andrew Duffy, Bruce Deachman and others.

It was more like a modern magnolia, he realized. That meant white flowers, not red.\n\n“Still scientifically a valid find and still a beautiful tree, however, by now Ely had nearly completed the painting,” he recalls. “And yes the bright red flowers on the tree from New Zealand were there for the world to see.”\n\nThe two men were nervous.\n\n“Dale and I both knew how Ely would take the news as she had reacted earlier on several occasions to much smaller changes in a very straightforward and blunt manner,” Jarzen said.\n\nThey were used to her swearing in particular. Words “that would easily make a preacher blush,” he said.\n\nThey steeled themselves, and asked her to paint again.\n\nOnce the cussing subsided (Jarzen calls it an “onslaught”), Kish went back to work like a pro.\n\n“The finished product is now a classic with the red flowers covered forever by fewer and larger white flowers,” he says now, “recalling to me a time I will cherish and never forget. A time the scientists and artist became one and used their respective talents to create a world long gone, but close to our hearts.”\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nEly Kish died Oct. 12 at the age of 90.\n\nThe public knew her best as a painter and sculptor of dinosaurs and other ancient scenes. Her work has ranged from Baby Dinosaurs, a children’s pop-up book commissioned by the National Geographic Society, to Life in the Ancient Seas, a vast mural with underwater luminescence commissioned by Washington’s Smithsonian Institution.\n\nThe Smithsonian mural took two years to complete and made her career. She also told Citizen reporter Joanne Laucius that it gave her the money to convert an old log house and barn near Bourget into a combination home and studio.\n\n”Those little beasts started it,” she said of the dinosaurs in a 1992 interview. ”I always wanted a studio, but I never had the money. The Smithsonian gave me that chunk of cash.”\n\nBut she also said her greatest love in art was ”beautiful things. Environmental things.”\n\nThis included a fascination with native life ranging from a large portrait of singer Buffy Sainte-Marie to the American Southwest, where Kish spent time while painting a prehistoric mural 13 metres wide for the natural history museum in Albuquerque, N.M.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nSteve Cumbaa, an emeritus scientist from the museum, describes how she did these paintings for Dale Russell’s two masterpiece books, A Vanished World: The Dinosaurs of Western Canada (1981) and An Odyssey in Time: The Dinosaurs of North America (1989), both published by the museum.\n\nFor the most part the paintings were not on public display, but 31 of them remain in the museum’s collection.\n\nThe group worked then in a building on Woodroffe Avenue.\n\n“She had an easel and everything set up in a back room,” Cumbaa said in an interview.\n\n“Ely was an exacting artist, and collaborated both extensively and intensively with Dale Russell and … David Jarzen to get every detail right,” he added.\n\n“For some scenes, Ely would sculpt the dinosaurs. Dale would show her the fossil bones of the featured dinosaur(s), and with his constructive criticism, she would make a scale model of the skeleton. She and Dale would then add in the muscles, based on attachment points observable on the fossil bones, supplemented by their extensive experience in comparative anatomy.\n\n“Over the bones and muscle would go the skin, its texture an exact match for fossilized skin impressions in the CMN and other fossil collections. In a similar manner, David’s detailed knowledge of the fossil plants and pollen uncovered with the dinosaur bones enabled Ely to re-create long-extinct environments.”\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nShe also worked with Richard Harington, who studied the post-dinosaur era and ancient mammals of North America.\n\n“I knew Ely fairly well, and worked with her in the late 1970s on a watercolour of a restoration of ice age mammals living about 20,000 years ago in the Dawson area, Yukon,” Harington said.\n\n“It showed wolves and bison in the foreground, Yukon horses and woolly mammoths in the middleground and caribou in the background with Ogilvie Mountains and Laurentide Ice Cap in the distance. Ely was very particular about depicting the characters of the different animals, relative sizes, probable coat colour etc., before starting the work. She also showed the various movements of the mammal groups involved to add to the aesthetic dynamics of the picture.”\n\nEly Kish was born and raised in New Jersey, the daughter of painter Eugene Kiss (his daughter later changed the spelling of her last name) and Teresa Bittman. In the early years of her career she exhibited at the Cleveland Museum of Art, and at a museum in Mexico.\n\nIt was the then-named National Museum of Man in Ottawa that connected her with the dinosaurs. She was commissioned to paint a Thanksgiving mural for the museum in 1974, and that’s what drew Dale Russell to her art.\n\n“She was very intellectually curious and that drove a lot of her stuff,” Cumbaa said.\n\nHe still keeps a pencil drawing of hers in his home: not a dinosaur scene, but a nun looking out a window.\n\nEly Kish leaves her partner, Huguette Vrancken; a brother, Eugene; and several nieces and nephews. At her request there was no funeral service.\n\ntspears@ottawacitizen.com\n\ntwitter.com/TomSpears1\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
