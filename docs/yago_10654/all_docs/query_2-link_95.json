It was traditionally made of natural fibre such as wool, cotton and later silk; after the 1970s synthetic fibres were introduced. The kaftan influenced western fashion from the 1960’s, as seen on hipsters and fashionable ladies. During the 1970s most famously worn by Demis Roussas, a highly popular international male singer. Over the past decade, kaftans in a variety of shapes and materials are finding their way onto the high street as ladies day/evening and sun dresses. For the exhibition we had a small selection of kaftans from different periods and places, illustrating the fashionable applications of this ancient garment, including a vintage 1970s kaftan styled by Beverly Hills, a 1980s classical Middle Eastern decorative kaftan, a 1996/7 collection Hassan Hajjaj kaftan and a 2013 collection kaftan by KTZ fashion House\n\n24 March 2014 - ‘On the road again’ with DIck Taylor, Henry Padovani, and Kathy Mendonca for a private live gig, Paris.\n\nFeb and Mar 2014 - Music workshop for children at Rustam, Persian language school.\n\nNour Festival 2013 RBKC- Nour Festival, the wonderfully organised and run festival, by RBKC, in the heart of London town celebrates the cultures of Near East and North Africa.
