        "text": "Crossing canyons, ravines, sheer mountain passes, large cave networks, rift valleys, and plateaus, Draelish that channel Earth Essence are known by their Affinity name as Kish. With axinite-colored eyes and brownish/tan-green scales, Kish often channel their essence using tectonic forces when they attack.\n\nGameplay Traits\n\nAbility Score Increase. Draelish are known for their Strength and Constitution, exerting great physical force and having high resilience at the cost of lower flexibility. You increase your Strength and Constitution ability scores by 2 each, but you decrease your Dexterity ability score by 1.\n\nCreature Type. You are a Humanoid. You are also considered a Wand for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be a Wand.\n\nSize. Your size is Medium. Draelish are taller and heavier than other humanoids, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging over 250 pounds.\n\nSpeed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\nLanguages. You can speak, read, and write Drael and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for your character, such as Regional (a catch-all term for the region's main language, also known as Common in 5e).\n\nCore Affinity. You have resistance to the Thunder damage type.\n\nAffinity Attribute: Earth Treader. You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you have advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock you prone.\n\nSubspecies Morphology Choose one trait listed below that represents an Earth Affinity's ability to travel through ravines and caverns or traverse quake-intensive regions.\n\n1. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were in dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.\n\n2. Tremorsense. You gain tremorsense out to 20 feet. A creature with tremoresense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the creature and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremoresense can't be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures.\n\nDescendant of Terrible Might. Draelish possess ancient power, bending the world subconsciously to their will. You gain a bonus equal to half your proficiency bonus rounded down to one Saving Throw of your choice (choose which one when you select this template).\n\nEssence Channeler. Draelish have many powerful abilities locked inside themselves, unlocking them through intense training and strong resolution. You can cast the Earth Tremor spell with this trait. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the Earth Ripple* spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the Seismic Wave* spell with it. Once you cast any of these spells with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this template).\n\nCurse of the Shr'keldar. You have disadvantage on saving throws against being charmed by Dragons.\n\nOptional: Roleplay Traits\n\nBelow are additional traits called Talents and Restrictions that players can use when playing as a Draelish, especially for those looking to immerse themselves in the world a little more when roleplaying as one. Some make life as an adventurer more difficult while others encourage the player and gamemaster alike to think of new ways they could use the Draelish Ancestry's biology and/or lore to solve problems (or even make new ones), listed or otherwise. If you enable Talents and Restrictions, you gain all of the following traits for your character: Talent: Carnivorous Stomach\n\nYou can eat cuisine that others may find unappetizing or difficult to stomach, including bugs and raw meat (but not rancid). [Draelish have no qualms about eating the flesh of other creatures, though it is generally frowned upon to eat the flesh of a sentient, especially that of another Draelish. Typical Draelish meals include spicy curry, savory snacks such as salted bugs, or pungent, meaty stew.]\n\nTalent: Rudimentary Tools\n\nIf you have natural weapons, such as a beak, fangs, talons, or claws, you can use them as makeshift tools, such as when digging or carving. You gain half proficiency when making a tool check if it makes sense to use your natural weapons.\n\nTalent: Low-Frequency Detection\n\nYou have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing if you are trying to detect the direction and distance of a large seismic activity such as an earthquake, volcano, tsunami, large thunderstorm, an approaching army, a roaring waterfall, or other sources that emit infrasound.\n\nRestriction: Unusual Physique\n\nDue to your unconventional form (such as having additional appendages, a tail, or wings), armor costs and weighs 1.5x more than normal when made to fit you. Armor already made to fit a standard-sized humanoid must be resized to fit you, costing 0.5x its base value to adjust it to your physique.\n\nRestriction: Bulky\n\nIf you are wearing heavy armor, you have a harder time squeezing into smaller spaces. You must spend 4 extra feet for every foot when moving inside a space that requires you to squeeze.\n\nRestriction: High Metabolism\n\nThough you are naturally good at regulating your body temperature and can run with an extra burst of speed, you are not as efficient when traveling over a long period of time. You have -1 Stamina Points but when you dash, you can move an extra 10 feet.\n\nArt by Sam Santala at artstation.com/samsantala\n\nEye Color: Axinite\n\nScale Color Scheme: Brown (Kasniska) or Nickel Ore (Sankara)\n\nEssence Channeled: Earth (Volatile form: Tectonic Forces)\n\nClick here to return to the Draelish Ancestry page.\n\nSpells with an asterisk (*) next to them come from KibblesTasty's Casting Compendium, which is found here.\n\nKish Spell Theme\n\nIf you are playing as a Kish Draelish spellcaster (Drael: \"Duumarle\") and would like to theme your spells after your Affinity (or see what would most likely be their in-universe essence expressions in 5e), the following spells would act as forms of channeled Earth Essence: Cantrips:\n\nMold Earth\n\nRock Slam*\n\nStone Forming*\n\nThunder Note*\n\n1st-Level Spells\n\nCreate Pit*\n\nEarth Tremor\n\nStone Fist*\n\nThunder Punch*\n\nThunderous Smite*\n\nThunderwave\n\n2nd-Level Spells\n\nEarthbind\n\nEarth Ripple*\n\nThunderburst Mine*\n\n3rd-Level Spells\n\nElemental Weapon\n\nErupting Earth\n\nInstant Bulwark*\n\nSeismic Wave*\n\nQuick Sand*\n\n4th-Level Spells\n\nEchoing Lance*\n\nElemental Bane\n\nOrbital Stones*\n\nStone Coffin*\n\nStone Shape\n\n5th-Level Spells\n\nBurial Barrage*\n\nFissure*\n\nSonic Shriek*\n\nTransmute Rock\n\nWall of Stone\n\n6th-Level Spells\n\nAvalanche*\n\nBones of the Earth\n\nForm of Stone*\n\nInvestiture of Stone\n\nMove Earth\n\n8th-Level Spells\n\nEarthquake"
