        "text": "Many ships move forward on the huge waves of seas and have no fear of storms, on the infinite blue of the sea, under the yellow light of the reckless sun moving from coast to coast. Each of these ships has a story, an audible and incredible story! The Greek ship Kish, which is quite near the west coast of Kish Island, also has a fascinating and audible story that some are not aware of.\n\nWhere is the Greek ship kish?\n\nThe Greek ship is one of the most scenic attractions of Kish Island in Hormozgan province. The ship is located in the southwest of the island and around ghorob Square. On July 26, 1966, a large ship came aground near the village of Baghoo in Kish. For several years, the Greek ship has been located on Kish Island and has become a symbol and one of the tourist attractions of Kish today.\n\nAddress: Hormozgan Province, Southwest of Kish Island, ghorob Street, ghorob Square,ghorob Beach Park (Greek ship Beach Park)\n\n⇐Reading Suggestions: Getting to Know Kish Island Hotels\n\nWhat happened to the Greek ship in Kish?\n\nThe ship was built in 1943 by William Hamilton in Glasgow, Scotland, and was abandoned in the water. The ship weighed 7,061 tons at the time of construction and its length was 136 meters, currently weighing less because of severe decay. The ship had been handed over between British and Iranian owners, and the last owner was a Greek man. The names of the ship were “Empire Trumpet”, “Necheralist”, “Cyrus Parsi”, “Hamedan” and “Kuala F” during came aground. The reason of came aground is still in a veil of obscurity. The high premium of the ship with Lloyd’s UK has created some doubts.\n\nFinally, in 1966, the ship came aground on Kish Island, while 80 days of continuous efforts were made to pull it out, but due to the high weight of the ship, no success was achieved. On the other hand, because it was not economically affordable, passengers and crew were eventually forced to leave, and the oil load was completely unloaded.\n\nIt was first built in 1943 (equivalent to 1946) by William Hamilton Shipbuilding and partners, sold to the British War Transport Ministry, and named the Empire Trumpet.\n\nA company called the Steamboat Larinaga took over and two years later handed the ship over to T and J Harrison. Between 1943 and 1946, the ship was at the permission of the Government of South Africa. In 1946, Shrant steamship bought it and changed the name of the ship to Necheralist. The decision was then made to hand over its management to T and J Harrison, the ship’s previous owner. In 1959, it was the turn of an Iranian company to take ownership of the ship. After renaming the ship to Cyrus Irani, the Iranian company Lloyd’s and ko-Khorramshahr handed over its management to Beechworth and partners. In 1965, Iran’s shipping lines in Khorramshahr owned it and chose the name Hamedan for the\n\nA company called the Steamboat Larinaga took over and two years later handed the ship over to T and J Harrison.

After renaming the ship to Cyrus Irani, the Iranian company Lloyd’s and ko-Khorramshahr handed over its management to Beechworth and partners. In 1965, Iran’s shipping lines in Khorramshahr owned it and chose the name Hamedan for the ship. Two Greek individuals named P.J. Frangoulis and A.I. Cliafas were the last ship owners to buy it in 1966, and thus the ship’s name was changed to Kuala F. The story of that ship that came aground occurred the same year, and since the ship belonged to the Greeks, it became known as the Greek ship.\n\nStory to the Greek ship running aground\n\nThere are various stories and narratives about how the Greek ship ran aground. For example, in one of the stories, it is stated that the captain of the ship falls in love with an Iranian girl, but the girl’s family does not accept the captain, and one day the captain of the ship will date her, who will soon take the girl to Greece on her ship until this happens to the ship and this will not happen. In another story, the ship’s owner is in financial bankruptcy, and in collaboration with the captain and sailors, the ship made it happen to get a lot of damage from the insurance. Also, some people in the area have said that the captain of the Greek ship was drunk and that this drunken state caused the ship to fall into this position. But the theory that is closer to reality is that the weather was foggy and on the other hand, there was no lighthouse on Kish Island; the ship mistakenly came to the island and the Greek ship ran aground.\n\nAboard the Greek ship Kish\n\nThe Greek ship decayed over time due to humidity. In a short time, permitted to enter the ship under certain conditions, which accelerated the ship’s destruction. The exhaustion of the ship is very high, especially the lower part that is rotted due to the impact of sea waves and the salinity of the water and may sink into the depths of the water. Currently, this ship has become a place of living for sea creatures and its safety status is so low that no one else can step in. Every few years, the ship’s stability becomes less, and part of it collapses, which happened to the rear of the ship.\n\nNow the hull is falling apart and collapsing in the water, and no one knows how many years it will be possible to watch. From the conversations between the Sharif University of Tehran and the Kish Free Zone Organization, it was concluded that there was no hope of remaining the Greek ship, and since the cost of maintenance and restoration is not cost-effective, it should be accepted fact that in the next few years this tourist attraction and the symbol of Kish Island will be destroyed\n\n. According to the talks and the results of these negotiations, some Greek ship lovers decided to take this risk and visit before the iron giant completely collapsed. For some time, footage from inside the ship has been widespread in cyberspace, showing people with the courage to take risks and go into this worn-out structure, in addition to visiting it themselves, to create a picture for other people who cannot enter it.\n\n⇐ Special Offer: Yat Rental Ticket in Kish\n\nRecreation and attractions around the Greek ship Kish\n\nIt is currently not possible to visit the vessel.

The images are likely to relate to professional divers or when the Greek ship was in good condition. Also, some people may have wanted to see the inside before the ship completely collapsed, but they were unable to go too far because of the iron cut.\n\nWatch the sunset\n\nOne of the main beauties is the ship that finds a picture at sunset, the sun fades on the horizon and at the same time covers the red and orange colors of the sky and the ship looks like a painting, many people come to see the ship only to watch this pleasant and dreamy sunset and photograph it, of course on certain days the ship is decorated with colorful lights. That multiplies its beauty.\n\nCamel riding\n\nThere are interesting recreations around the area for visitors, one of which is camel riding and horseback riding on the beach, and besides, they have designed large and varied sculptures on the beach that both create a beautiful atmosphere and a good opportunity for photography.\n\nBeach Park\n\nIn addition, a beach park is located right nearby, a space of 60,000 square meters, which offers entertainment facilities such as a buffet, cafeteria, restaurant, amphitheater, etc., and also has booths for renting bicycles; Of course, this park is under development and a part of it is still not fully opened, a sports hall, many restaurants, etc. are among the things that will be added to the collection, and also a part is considered for skate rental.\n\n⇐Reading Suggestions: Best Travel Time to Kish Island\n\nOcean Water Park\n\nOcean Water Park is another attraction of Kish Island, located about eight kilometers from the Greek ship.
