        "text": "CANNES FILM FESTIVAL\n\nThe Cannes festival has taken a turn to films that have hints of pedophilia and violent death. Atom Egoyan (who won the 1997 Grand Prix for \"The Sweet Hereafter\") can't seem to keep his hands off the subject. How many times have his movies had scenes of young girls in cars being fondled by a father figure?\n\n\"Felicia's Journey,\" which stars Bob Hoskins, Elaine Cassidy and Arsinee Khanjian, is adapted from William Trevor's novel about Felicia, a young Irish girl (Cassidy), who crosses the sea to find her lover and tell him she is pregnant. Instead, she meets a portly bachelor named Hilditch (Hoskins), who, it\n\nturns out, collects young girls. This respectable gentleman, who runs a catering business, had a devouring mother (Khanjian) who peppered his childhood with the video dramas of her gourmet TV show. She turned her pudgy little mother's helper into a magnificent monster. Magnificent because Hilditch is not out to hurt his tender girls, but perhaps to put them out of harm's way; he takes delicate care of them, driving them around the countryside, attentive to their sad adventures.\n\nRemarkably portrayed by Hoskins, Hilditch becomes a full character, in touch with Felicia's unhappiness, understanding better than she that she is in trouble. Just as things are heating up to a frightening finale, salvation literally walks through the garden gate. \"Felicia's Journey\" is a skillful piece of work.\n\nBruno Dumont's \"L'Humanite,\" is more explicitly about a case of pedophilia that leads to murder, but treated as a social problem, in Dumont's homeland in northern France, neighboring Belgium (which is still in the aftermath of the pedophile murder case of 1996). Dumont made a striking debut with \"La Vie de Jesus,\" set in the same flatlands: He films listless inhabitants and revved-up bikers, giving them faces out of primitive painting.\n\nOnce again, the director uses local nonprofessionals for the parts, but their faltering performances and the pacing of the film damages the impact. It's like being in the Coen brothers' \"Fargo,\" without the irony.\n\n-\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
