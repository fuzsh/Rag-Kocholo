        "text": "Transnational metacinema describes a range of films that depict film production across borders. The diverse corpus includes fictional works explicitly addressing the ethics of film crews working between nations, hybrid nonfictions that reflexively consider their own use of archival footage and re-enactments, cannibal horror films featuring documentarian protagonists, and Hollywood satires. This article considers themes of colonization and exploitation that traverse these examples. Each case complicates the sustaining, modernist notion that reflexivity disrupts viewing pleasure, inviting more politically aware spectatorship. Many examples promote self-awareness in the filmmaker-audience relationship at the expense of concern for the Indigenous and marginalized populations represented.\n\nTransnational cinema: The film reader (Ezra & Rowden, 2006) is an anthology of papers on transnational cinema from the two earlier decades. It introduces the emerging debates of the transnational scene. It discusses transnational cinema as the most transportable art form as integration of digital technology has caused the rapid disappearance of permeable national media borders. Transnational cinema is characterized by awareness and diversity, and a speed capable of linking people across nations in minimum possible time. It affects the global economy and the cinematic literacy of its audiences and becomes the source of anxiety worldwide. Such themes draw on much discussed worldwide naturalization of Hollywood by taking the space of national cinemas in different countries. Transnational cinema: The film reader discusses the cultural repercussions of a global shift from multiple national cinemas to a diverse transnational cinema; the movement of Hollywood into the era of the multiplex; multicultural and diasporic interventions; and the ethics and aesthetics of Hollywood mis-èn-scene.\n\nThis chapter aims to present an overview of the history of the transnational in film studies, and consider the ways in which the discipline has responded to developments in the social sciences following a transnational momentum in film studies from 2005, with the following years seeing a number of conceptual and theoretical essays and edited volumes and the founding of a journal, Transnational Cinemas in 2010. It outlines the key areas of focus in the first phase of transnational cinema studies: migration and cinema and exilic and diasporic filmmaking; transnationalising readings of national and regional cinema; historical readings of transnational cinema; and film festival studies. Following this, the chapter discusses approaches to transnational film theory through an analysis of a selection of definitional essays on the subject. The final section of the chapter presents an overview of the second phase of transnational film studies, and considers the expanded reach of the transnational to the many fields that make up the discipline.\n\n“Breakthrough” global blockbusters like Black Panther (2018) and Crazy Rich Asians (2018) create disturbances among critics and firms forced to wonder if such ripples of diversity will become waves of new cinema wiping out the hegemony of Hollywood and the global West. In this essay, we establish the context for this phenomenon in terms of film’s historical relationship to marketing. Through this context, we theorize a transnational aesthetic for global blockbusters, one that may serve to limit ripples of diversity, breaking waves of change against the rocks of a banal cinema of Americanized nothingness.
