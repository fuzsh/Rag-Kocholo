        "text": "● Birthday: 10 July 1941\n\n● Birthplace: Abadan\n\nBiography\n\nHe was born in the Arab village of Saedoni in southeastern Abadan. His father, Ali, was an employee of the Customs office and therefore he had to travel with his father to the border areas of southern Bandarabbas. From the same years, adolescence was fond of cinema and literature. The high school was completed in Razi, Abadan, I. Before the start of the cinema, the Impiety became a TV show and was noted by making the TV series. In the book of the film The Impiety of the (“Greek ship”) of the Tales in Kish-1998 is seen in three films before the revolution and three films after the Islamic Revolution. The impiety of the famous serial: My Uncle Napoleon has made the people know him more with this collection. This series is written by Iraj Pezeshkzad, a TV-lasting series. He was a prominent documentary. The taxi meter, which was built for television in 1967, is the first of his work in film field. Documentaries Chun: Mashad carpet, Forough Farrokhzad, and… Jen are the most important documentaries of impiety. He has a acclaimed short film: The Liberation, made in the year 1971. The film was awarded at eight major international festivals, including Venice, San Francisco and Giffoni festivals. In the year 1965, in the years before he was behind the camera, a documentary short film was considered as the technical staff of the famous film brick and Mirror made by Ibrahim Golestan. And the modulate of film was also taught.\n\nMaster Nasser Taghvai is the award-winning Golden Panther Film Festival, for the Captain Sun film in the year 1988. After the revolution of the documentary, he made the last practice in 2004, with the theme of the topic. He is among the few Iranian filmmakers who know the literature well and in his own love of literature. He is an unfinished student in Persian literature. One set of stories is also called the summer of the year, which consists of eight interconnected stories that released. It was also the editor of the literary Journal of South Art and literature. Perhaps this is why the impiety in his works is more than all Iranian filmmakers to be adapted to literary.\n\nFilm: Peace in the presence of others, built in 1970, according to Gholamhosein Saedi, the story of a colonel is retired, and his relationship with her daughters has been seized. In the film, exhibitors poets: Mohammad Ali Sepanlou and Manouchehr Atashi played a role in their own roles. Film: Sadegh Korde, the product of 1972, was written by the impiety of Saeed Rad, Mohammad-Ali Keshavarz, and the police-Ayatollah. The film is the only film in which the impiety has used the flashback, which is not the case of his favorite. Film: Curse, built in 1973, wrote, according to the story: swamp; Behrooz Vosoughi, Jamshid Mashayekhi, and Fakhri Khorvash played in this film. Although it was not confronted with the public Iqbal, but the film is very sexy of impiety and critics. The captain of the Sun, product 1986, which is an adaptation of: possessing and having the Ernest Hemingway, is believed to be the top-adapted cinematic in the history of Iranian cinema. And undoubtedly, the prodigious fluency of the impiety on the literature and of course adaptation, is a masterful directing along the brilliant games of film scores.\n\nMovie: Ey Iran, the production of 1989, was written by a national identity and by the game of Akbar Abdi, Hossein Sarshar and Gholamhossein Naghshine, Nasser Eye Azar Music and filming Mahmoud Clary in Masouleh’s location. The film was put aside from the Fajr Festival competition. View film: A paperless paper, built in 2001, wrote the impiety and Mino Farshchi, the last of the Impiety movie to date. Although the film does not think of some, the strength of other films is the impiety, but it remains elaborate and accurate.\n\nHe has a few unfinished movies and TV work in his worksheet. TV series: Sarayan stories, in 1978, who paid to the life and works of the writers of contemporary literature, including that. Before the revolution, he was supposed to be the husband of Ms. Ahoo written by Ali Mohammad Afghani. After the revolution, the massive small forest project wrote himself in the year 1983, and two famous projects (buzzer and Roman-2002) and (bitter tea-2003) also remained incomplete. In January 2003, a war film was key to the bitter tea, but for financial reasons and lack of support for the public centers. What the impiety raised as an exception to the cinema is not only a high quality of his works, but the mass of non-business works in the report. Surely he is not the culprit of all these projects. In some cases, different conditions and events were also shared.\n\nCinema\n\n– Bitter Tea – Semi-finished\n\n– Zangi – Roman – Semi-finished\n\n2001 – Paper Line\n\n1998 – Greek ship\n\n1989 – Ey Iran\n\n1986 – Captain Khorshid\n\n1973 – Curse\n\n1971 – Sadegh Korde\n\n1970 – Peace In The Presence of Others\n\nDocumentary\n\n– Illiterate bread\n\n– Sun Hairdresser\n\n– Taxi meter\n\n– Wind Elf\n\n– Palm\n\n– Minab Market\n\n– South Music\n\n– Arbaeen\n\n– Mashad Rug\n\n– Forough Farrokhzad\n\n2004 – Final Exercise – Ta’ziyeh Horr Brave – The Ta’ziyeh was registered with the UNESCO World Heritage Organization through the screening of this film and several other acts.\n\nShort Film\n\n1971 – Relief\n\nScreenplay\n\n– Perfect Man\n\n– Safe Match\n\n– Bitter Tea\n\n– Forest Kuchak\n\nStory\n\n– Summer of the same year and (seven continuous stories)\n\nAwards\n\n2013 – The seventh edition of the Truth of cinema to the passing of a life of art\n\n1999 – Golden Palm nominated Cannes Film Festival for film: Tales of Kish\n\n1988 – Award-winning bronze Panther Film Festival Locarno for film: (Nakhoda Khorshid) Captain Sun\n\n1988 – Nominated Golden Panther Award for Film Locarno Festival for film: (Nakhoda Khorshid) Captain Sun\n\n1986 – Crystal Simorgh nominated for Best Director at The 5th Fajr Film Festival for film: (Nakhoda Khorshid) Captain Sun.\n\n1972 – San Francisco award winning Golden Prize for short Emancipation film\n\n1973 – Silver badge 6th Tehran Sepas Festival for film: Curse\n\n1972 – Bronze show the 5th Tehran International Film Festival\n\n0 COMMENTS"
