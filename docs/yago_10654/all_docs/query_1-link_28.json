Even the legendary explorer Marco Polo, during his sojourn at the Imperial court in China, became enchanted by the tales of Kish’s exquisite pearls.\n\nFrom Luxury Resort to Duty-Free Hub: Kish’s Evolution\n\nIn the 1970s, Kish Island underwent a metamorphosis under the last Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. It transformed into a luxurious resort destination, luring the international elite with attractions such as the Grand Casino, later renamed the Shayan International Hotel after the Iranian Revolution. The island even boasted an airport designed to accommodate the Concorde. Post-revolution, Kish Island embraced a new identity as a duty-free shopping paradise.\n\nA Mysterious Enigma: Robert Levinson’s Disappearance\n\nKish Island harbors a mysterious chapter in its history, shrouded in the disappearance of Robert Levinson, a former F.B.I. agent turned private investigator, who vanished without a trace on March 9, 2007.\n\nIn Conclusion: A Journey Awaits\n\nIn conclusion, Kish Island is not just a picturesque destination; it is a treasure trove of history, natural splendor, and modern delights.
