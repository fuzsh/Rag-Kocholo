        "text": "The Myth of Etana is the story of the Sumerian antediluvian King of Kish who ascends to heaven on an eagle to request the Plant of Birth from the gods so that he might have a son. Etana is named as the first king of Kish in the Sumerian King List (composed c. 2100 BCE) which claims he reigned early in the 3rd millenium BCE. According to the Sumerian King List, Etana was known as \"he who stabilized the lands\" after the gods had created order out of chaos and established the concepts of kingship and government among humanity. Etana was, therefore, a well-known and highly respected figure and would have been chosen as the central character for precisely this reason. A central message of the myth is that one should trust in the gods and Etana, a great king, would have been chosen by the unknown author as the best exemplar in conveying that message.\n\nCentral Message\n\nThat the myth is very old is attested to by cylinder seals depicting Etana on the eagle's back which date from the reign of Sargon of Akkad (2334-2279 BCE). The British Museum has among its holdings a fragment of The Myth of Etana from King Assurbanipal's library at Ninevah, dating from the 7th century but, as G.S. Kirk points out:\n\nRemove Ads\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Neo-Assyrian version from Ashurbanipal's library happens to be the most surviving text, but where it overlaps with an Old Babylonian version of a thousand years earlier it corresponds with it very closely, sometimes word for word. A short Middle Assyrian fragment maintains the same accuracy. (25)\n\nThe story contains many motifs seen in myths of every culture: a great city created by the gods, a search for a worthy ruler, talking animals, broken oaths, divine intervention and a quest which brings the hero to the land of the gods (this one involving an eagle of mythic proportions). The myth may have been intended, as suggested by R. McRoberts, to convey a political message regarding kingship:\n\nWhen this story is placed in the context of the First Dynasty of Kish, and its exceptional rule of twenty three consecutive kings, it can be seen as more than a tale of fantasy. Earlier dynasties in the King Lists show only a few kings ruling in succession. It is possible that the success of the First Dynasty of Kish could be owed in part to a new tradition of passing the monarchy on to a male heir of the previous king. The myth of Etana served as a colorful reminder that it was the king's duty to go to any lengths, or heights as the case may be, to produce that heir. (40)\n\nWhile McRoberts' observation is certainly valid, the duty of the king was not only to his people but to the gods who had not only given him life but placed him in his position. According to Sumerian belief (and Mesopotamian belief in general), the gods had created humanity as co-workers to maintain order and keep the forces of chaos in check. The king was responsible to both the gods and his subjects to make sure the gods' will was followed. He could not perform this task if he had no faith in the gods himself and so the myth, in addition to its many other themes, would have emphasized Etana's faith in the gods even when it seems his prayers have not been answered.\n\nRemove Ads\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSummary\n\nThe story opens with the foundation and building of the great city of Kish where the gods surround the city with high walls and then begin a careful search for a king to rule the city. Etana is finally chosen by Ishtar/Inanna to rule and he builds a shrine to the god Adad. Near to this shrine a poplar tree is growing in which an eagle has built a nest in the branches and a serpent has made a home in the roots.\n\nThe eagle and the serpent swear an oath of loyalty, with Shamash, the sun god as their witness, that they will be friends and care for each other's children. The eagle will watch over the serpent's children when the serpent goes out to search for food and the serpent will do likewise for the eagle. This agreement works well until, one day, when the eagle's children have grown, the eagle decides to eat the serpent's children, not heeding the warning cries of his own children who beg him not to.\n\nRemove Ads\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the serpent comes home with the day's food he finds his children gone, his nest destroyed and the eagle's talon prints in the earth around his former home. He cries out to Shamash for help in punishing the eagle and is told to hide inside the carcass of a wild ox and, when the eagle comes to eat of the flesh, to seize him, cut off his wings and tail feathers, pluck him, and throw him into a pit. The serpent does as he is instructed and the eagle, helpless in the pit, now cries out to Shamash himself asking for help. Shamash tells the eagle that what he did with the serpent's children was a horrible act but that the god will send Etana to help the eagle.\n\nEtana, meanwhile, is also petitioning Shamash for help because his wife is barren and he despairs of having a son and heir to his throne. Shamash directs Etana to the pit where the eagle is suffering and Etana nurses the bird back to health. The eagle and Etana become close friends and the eagle even interprets Etana's dreams for him. In one of these dreams, Etana ascends to heaven riding on the eagle and is given the Plant of Birth by Ishtar. The eagle believes this dream is a message from the gods for the two of them to attempt this venture and tells Etana to hold on to his wings, placing his breast to the bird's breast.\n\nThe story of Etana contains many motifs seen in the myths of every culture.\n\nClinging to the underbelly of the great eagle, Etana is carried up into the heavens. He is so far up that, when he looks down, he cannot see the earth and becomes afraid. He cries out to the eagle, \"I looked but could not see the land! Nor were my eyes enough to find the vast sea! My friend, I won't go up to heaven Set me down, let me go off to my city\" and then lets go of the eagle and plunges toward the earth. The eagle swoops down after Etana and rescues him.\n\nRemove Ads\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two return to the City of Kish where Etana and his wife both have dreams and the eagle interprets Etana's dream as a command to make a second attempt at the heavens. The second attempt is successful in that they gain the heights of heaven and arrive in the abode of the gods to bow down together but the rest of the story has been lost. As Etana did have a son, Balikh, who succeeded him as king (and is said to have reigned for 1500 years) it is understood that the dream Etana had of Ishtar bestowing upon him the Plant of Birth came true.\n\nThe Text\n\nThe following translation is by Benjamin Foster from his work, From Distant Days: Myths, Tales and Poetry from Ancient Mesopotamia used under Creative Commons License from the Gateways to Babylon website and supplemented by Stephanie Dalley's translation, paraphrased in this present author's own words, toward the conclusion.\n\nTABLET I\n\nThey planned a city [ ]\n\nThe gods laid its foundations\n\nThey planned the city [Kish?]\n\nThe Igigi-gos founded its brickwork [ ]\n\n\" Let [ ] be their (the people's) shepherd,\n\n\" Let Etana be their architect... \"\n\nThe Great Anunnaki gods ordainers of destinies,\n\nSat taking their counsel concerning the land,\n\nThe creators of the four world regions, establishers of all physical form,\n\nBy command of all of them the Igigi gods\n\nOrdained a festival for the people\n\nNo king did they establish, over the teeming peoples,\n\nAt that time no headdress had been assembled, nor crown,\n\nNor yet scepter had been set with lapis.\n\nNo throne daises whatsoever had been constructed,\n\nAgainst the inhabited world they barred the gates...\n\nThe Igigi gods surrounded the city with ramparts\n\nIshtar came down from heaven to seek a shepherd,\n\nAnd sought for a king everywhere.\n\nInninna came down from heaven to seek a shepherd,\n\nAnd sought for a king everywhere.\n\nEnlil examined the dais of Etana,\n\nThe man whom Ishtar steadfastly...

In Kish, Etana has a series of dreams which \"encourage him to make a second attempt to reach heaven.\" The rest of the piece tells of Etana's dreams, the eagle's interpretation, the dream of Etana's wife (in which she seems to see a long reign for Etana) and Etana's and the eagle's second flight to heaven where \"they went through the gate of Sin, Shamash, Adad and Ishtar\" and bowed down together. As the last line of the piece is given as \"He pushed it open [and went inside]\" Dalley concludes that this second attempt at the heavens is successful and Etana receives the Plant of Life from Ishtar.\n\nRemove Ads\n\nAdvertisement"
