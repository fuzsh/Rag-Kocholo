        "text": "Mohammad Khodadadi, born in 1979 in Bushehr, Iran, is a Ney player and a composer who is currently residing in Vienna/Austria. He has studied composition of western classical music at the university of Anton Bruckner in Linz/Austria. Mohammad started playing Ney from the age of 15 through strong self-discipline and coaching of Masters of Ney such as Mr. Hassan Kassai, and Mr. A. Afsharnia. He has also studied the Persian radif and techniques of singing with Master Hatam Askari & Seddigh Tarif. He learned to play the piano with Rosita Shaker and Tamara Dolidze in Iran and continued with Andreas Taller in Austria. Mohammad learned composition with Master Alireza Mashayekhi, Professor Soyka and Erland Freudenhaler. Mohammad currently performs as a soloist and composer in various concerts in Europe and Iran.\n\nMokhtar Paki born in Shiraz, received his M.A. in architecture from Science & Technology University in Norway, and as a visiting student at Oxford Polytechnic University finished his theses on “Reconstruction of Disaster Stricken Regions”. His professional work includes reconstruction and rehabilitation of schools, and clinics for veterans. He received his second M.A. in Creative-writing from San Francisco State University in 1996.\n\nSince 1987, his short stories and articles have appeared in various journals in Iran, Europe and U.S. His latest novel “Sharhzade Sokoot” has been recently published. Mokhtar is also a painter, and he teaches art.\n\nManijeh Mohamedi, theater arts graduate from San Francisco State University, with master degree in drama-therapy (RDT), has over 45 years experience in theatrical arts and over 20 years experience in teaching drama in universities, acting schools, community centers and colleges in Iran, and acting schools in US.\n\nManijeh with her extensive experience in drama-therapy has addressed individual and group emotional issues through theater and a variety of presentation workshops. She has designed workshops for prisoners, war victims and their families, as well as adolescents, emotionally disturbed and disabled individuals and elderly.\n\nBahram Beyzaie is one of Iran’s most acclaimed filmmakers, playwrights, and scholars of the history of Iranian theater, both secular and religious. He was a leader of the generation of filmmakers known as the Iranian New Wave, beginning in the late 1960s, and has since directed more than a dozen prize-winning films. He has also conducted pioneering research into the roots of ancient legends derived from Indo-Iranian mythology and known collectively as A Thousand and One Nights. He is that rare artist who is also an erudite critic and scholar of his myriad crafts.\n\nBorn in Tehran, Beyzaie was for many years the head of the Theatre Arts Department at Tehran University. His two volume study of the history of Iranian theatre is still considered the authoritative account of this history. Since his arrival at Stanford as the Bita Daryabari Lecturer of Persian Studies, he has staged several of his plays and given workshops on Iranian mythology and cinema. He currently teaches courses on Iranian theatre and cinema.\n\nShaida Mohammadi: In mythology, time is a nonlinear revolving phenomenon, but in contemporary literature it is about an orderly course of events. Time for a narrator is the time in which she/he lives and can cognitively understand, a time which only finds meaning in ‘before’ and ‘after’; and it is within this chronological time-frame that the narrator can recall and record events. I do the same in my poetry, except for the strong element of nostalgia, the deep longing for the ‘lost time’ and the desire to make those fantasies to come alive in my time.\n\nNasser Rahmaninejad, a foremost celebrated Iranian artist started his theatre career in 1959 in Iran. In response to the authoritarian cultural policies and harsh censorship of the Shah’s regime, he founded his alternative, independent theatre group, Mehr, in 1966.\n\nHis group, which later changed its name to Iran Theatre Association, became very influential in the field, competing with other well-financed, state-sponsored theatre groups until it was closed down by the SAVAK, the Shah’s secret police in 1974. All members of the group were arrested and Rahmaninejad was sentenced to 12 years in prison; though he was ultimately freed by the 1979 revolution that toppled the Shah’s regime.\n\nAfter the revolution Rahmaninejad resumed his artistic activities, staging several plays while teaching at Iran’s Faculty of Dramatic Arts, while writing articles and lecturing on theatre and politics for a range of audiences.\n\nFollowing the Islamic regime’s crackdown on the opposition, Rahmaninejad was forced into exile. However, he continued his artistic activities writing essays, translating articles on theatre and politics into Persian, and lecturing at a variety of academic and artistic organizations in Europe and the United States, such as the International Writing Program (University of Iowa), the Center for Iranian Research and Analysis (CIRA), and the Iranian Studies Program at Stanford University. His plays in exile include My Heart, My Homeland, produced and performed by the Department of Theatre of Columbia College of Chicago (1995); and One Page of Exile, performed in the inaugural “New Windows on Old Pasadena” festival (1996). Rahmaninejad lives in the Bay Area, California.\n\n“The Poet’s Daughter is an engrossing coming-of-age tale of a Persian girl torn between devotion to her father- Bahar, the last icon of classical Persian poetry-and her own relentless desire to fashion for herself an identity as an independent, assertive modern woman…The beguiling simple elegance of the narrative never shies away from the harsh and heroic realities of the story.”\n\n–Abbas Milani, Director of Iranian Studies, Stanford University\n\nAbout the Speaker\n\nParvaneh Bahar was born in Tehran, Iran and came to the US in 1953. She has a B.A. in English Literature from American University and an M.S. from Catholic University of America in Washington DC. She worked for 29 years as Research Librarian for the World Bank and IMF Library and has written two books in Persian – Morgh Sahar: Khaterat Parvaneh Bahar (Memoir of Parvaneh Bahar) and Abeh Portaghal (Orange Juice). Parvaneh’s third book, The Poet’s Daughter: Malek o’Shoara Bahar of Iran and the Immortal Song of Freedom is in English and was published in September 2011.\n\n“In the immediate aftermath of the 2009 presidential elections, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad dismissed the millions of Iranians who had poured into Tehran’s streets as “dust and dirt”. And like dust and dirt, the Islamic Republic has sought to wipe and wash away the memory of the 2009 protests. Yet, far from remaining confined in the ash heaps of history, the political and historical ash remains a potent, explosive force, one that sparks and crackles with life. “Zahra’s Paradise” takes us into the depths of Evin prison, and explores the judicial twilight zone in which hundreds of Iranian dissidents have vanished. We look at the role of art, technology and memory through the prism of a graphic novel, and explore how citizen-journalists capture and reflect the hope, courage and dignity of the Iranian people, the promise of an Iranian spring.”\n\nKambiz Hosseini is a playwright, award-winning actor, and TV host working for Voice of America. He was born in Rasht, Iran in 1975 and moved to the U.S. in 2000.
