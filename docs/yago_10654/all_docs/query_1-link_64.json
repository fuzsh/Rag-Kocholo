        "text": "“The Face of Robinson… A legend… A man of integrity…An icon…Well-respected.” This is how students, faculty, and alumni describe Dr. Bernie Kish, one of the most influential members of the KU Sport Management community. In this feature, we are excited to share the unique story of Dr. Bernie Kish, who has been an integral part of the program’s success for many years, and who continues to impact the lives of students.\n\n“Coach Robinson doesn’t think you can be a good coach unless you love your players. And I don’t think you can be a good teacher unless you care about your students. That is an important part of my philosophy.”- Dr. Bernie Kish\n\nDr. Bernie Kish was born and raised in Lucerne Mines, Pennsylvania, a small town of fewer than 1,000 people. His father worked as a coal miner for fifty years, and Dr. Kish remembers his childhood as an experience he “wouldn’t trade for anything. It was just a great place for a young kid to grow up.” He has one younger brother, Andy, who is a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy.\n\nDr. Kish attended Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP), then Indiana State Teachers College. He majored in geography, social studies, and history, with plans of becoming a teacher. He participated in the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC), which was a requirement during the first two years at the institution. As Dr. Kish enjoyed the experience, he spent his final two years at IUP in the program as well. Upon graduating, he originally enlisted in the Army for three years, the obligatory requirement. Almost thirty years later, Dr. Kish retired as an Active Colonel, the most senior field grade military officer rank.\n\nDuring his time in the Army, Dr. Kish was stationed overseas for several years, including a year in Vietnam, a year in Cambodia, and eight years in Germany. Reflecting on his command position in Germany, Dr. Kish explained, “I had about 6,500 people, 21 different locations, 3 different countries, so some big and important jobs.” Other assignments included Ft. Riley in Kansas, Ft. Ord in California, and Leavenworth, Kansas. Dr. Kish also served as captain and ROTC instructor at Cornell University for three years. One of his cadets, Dr. Dave Darwin, is now an engineering professor in the School of Engineering at KU. When asked about his time with Dr. Kish, Dr. Darwin shared a memory: “Bernie was one of my instructors in Army ROTC when I was an undergraduate student at Cornell. When I graduated and was commissioned, my first assignment was to stay at Cornell for my master’s degree. Major Kish recruited me for the touch football game versus the cadre of the Naval ROTC. Bernie was our quarterback and we beat them soundly!”\n\nIn June of 1971, Dr. Kish met a young woman on a blind date named Judy. Six months later, Judy and Dr. Kish married. Nearly 50 years later, the couple has two daughters and one grandchild. Dr. Kish admires his wife’s flexibility during his career in the service: “Judy has been a great Army wife; she moved around with me was and always very supportive of what I did.”\n\nIn August of 1992, Dr. Kish was hired to be the special assistant to Dr. Bob Frederick, the Athletic Director at the University of Kansas. In addition, he served as Director of Ticket Operations. While working in the athletic department at KU, Dr. Kish started a chapter for the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall of Fame. When a new Hall of Fame was built in South Bend, Indiana, Dr. Kish thought he should apply for the job. “I had no background whatsoever in museum studies or anything like that. I called a friend who had been the director of the US Hockey Hall of Fame. He reminded me I did not have the experience necessary for the job. I decided to apply anyway.” Dr. Kish was selected for the position, and relocated to South Bend, Indiana, where he worked with a fantastic staff, and enjoyed the proximity to Notre Dame.\n\nFast-forward nearly thirteen years later, to August 2005. Insert the importance of nurturing valuable relationships and a love for the town of Lawrence, Kansas. Dr. Bob Frederick, chairperson of the KU Sport Management program, was hiring a lecturer for the upcoming academic year, and knew whom to contact. When Dr. Kish received Dr. Frederick’s phone call to come and teach graduate sport ethics, he did not hesitate. After just a few weeks of teaching, Dr. Frederick insisted that Dr. Kish apply for the positions of full-time lecturer and facility director. Since then, Dr. Kish has been a vital part of the Sport Management program, teaching undergraduate courses in sport ethics, personnel management, facilities, event management, and the pre-internship seminar. At the graduate level, Dr. Kish teaches sport facilities and sport ethics.\n\n“Since my first semester here at KU, Dr. Kish has made me feel unique and valued. He has an incredible ability to really connect with students and help them in pursuing their goals and dreams. His passion for teaching, for the community, and for the University of Kansas is contagious; I feel incredibly blessed to work with the icon that is Dr. Bernie Kish.”- Sari Little, KU Doctoral Student\n\nWhen asked about his teaching philosophy, Dr. Kish responded with passion. “I don’t do any whiz-bang stuff, so to speak. I am not real technologically savvy, so I follow the advice of Chuck Noll, former coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers. He had this philosophy that champions don’t do extraordinary things, they do ordinary things very, very well.” Dr. Kish incorporates this philosophy each and every day in his teaching. “Be organized for my class, present interesting material, and tell lots of stories. I have lots of good stories.” Dr. Kish also referenced Eddie Robinson, the legendary football coach at Grambling State University in Louisiana. “Coach Robinson doesn’t think you can be a good coach unless you love your players. And I don’t think you can be a good teacher unless you care about your students. That is an important part of my philosophy.”\n\nStudents speak highly of Dr. Kish’s role as a teacher and mentor. Chad Gerber, former KU Sport Management student and current Ph.D. student at Ohio State University, shared, “The thing that was immediately evident about Dr. Kish was his passion for teaching and concern for all students. He truly cares about the wellbeing of KU students. I remember him mentioning how much he enjoyed academia and that it was a career path that shouldn’t be forgotten”.\n\nIn addition to their praise for his teaching, former and current students were eager to emphasize Dr. Kish’s tremendous impact on their entire experience in the Sport Management program, and their comments reflect their respect and heartfelt appreciation for him. Sari Little, Masters graduate and current Doctoral student in the KU Sport Management program, said, “Since my first semester here at KU, Dr. Kish has made me feel unique and valued. He has an incredible ability to really connect with students and help them in pursuing their goals and dreams. His passion for teaching, for the community, and for the University of Kansas is contagious; I feel incredibly blessed to work with the icon that is Dr. Bernie Kish.”\n\nAnother former student, Anthony Ritoff, expressed similar admiration for Dr. Kish. “I would not be where I am today if it were not for Dr. Kish, a man of great integrity and with an incredible amount of knowledge. As a student of his in my undergraduate and graduate school years at KU, I learned a great deal from him. Dr. Kish played a huge role in helping me to get involved with the Sport Management program at KU and to get started within the sports industry, and I will forever be grateful to him. He cares for everyone he meets and makes each person feel important. Dr. Kish is a true gentleman, scholar, and mentor. He is simply the best.”\n\nFinally, Derek Stark, Masters graduate and current Doctoral student in the KU Sport Management Program, also expanded on Dr. Kish’s influence, both inside and outside the classroom. “Ever since arriving to Lawrence in August of 2016 there is not an individual who has made me feel more at home than Dr. Bernie Kish. It has been clear since Day 1 that Dr. Kish is in it for the right reasons: to teach, develop, and mentor students. He is an instrumental individual in our sport Management program as well as the glue guy for Robinson. I am a better man for knowing Dr. Kish and am so grateful for the classes, meetings, and quality time I’ve had with him. Dr. Kish epitomizes what it means to be a Jayhawk.”\n\nAfter speaking to current students, coworkers, and alumni, it is quite obvious that Dr. Bernie Kish is a tremendous asset to the Sport Management community, who has impacted the lives of so many. We are very grateful for Dr. Kish’s continued engagement in all facets of the KU Sport Management program."
