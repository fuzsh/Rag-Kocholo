        "text": "This book analyzes the changes in the representation of women in Iranian cinema since the 1960s, and investigates the reasons and motives for this. Iranian cinema, both before and after the Islamic Revolution, has been closely monitored by the ruling power, and has been utilized to relay messages and information that comply with the ruling ideology. However, it was only after the 1979 Revolution and the subsequent legitimization of cinema by the Islamic rule that cinema became widely accessible to the general public. Within this context, this book explores the changing roles of women in film production and their representation in films made between the 1960s and 2000s. Although some aspects of women’s lives became stricter after the revolution, it was in the late 1980s that women took a prominent role both behind and in front of the camera for the first time. It is demonstrated here that such shifts were due to several factors, including factionalism within the Islamic Republic, shifts in the Iranian film industry, and the emergence of a group of highly educated film production teams, in addition to the fuller integration of women into the film industry, which is analyzed in particular detail. This study explores a number of representative female-centric films, with a focus on their cultural, social and cinematic contexts. Discussing these films with respect to the representation of women, it uses textual analysis as its base methodology. Interviews conducted with filmmakers and people active in the industry also serve to place the films into their historical, social, and political context.\n\nThis article explores the vexed relationship between the development of Iranian ethnography, the Iranian New Wave, and Iranian literary modernity through the trope of the African slave descendent tradition, zar. Naṣir Taqvā’ī and Ghulām-Husayn Sā‘idī, among other Iranian authors and filmmakers, thematize zar in writings and films of the 1960s. Mining Taqvā’ī’s and Sā‘idī’s oeuvres Vaziri argues that the encounter with zar exceeds the order of eventuality; she tracks it throughout these authors’ subsequent work. Retroactively, zar, as a primitive figure for madness, produces coherence for the modernness of Iranian anxiety and alienation in New Wave films and modernist writings. This coherence depends upon the dissolution of zar’s historicity, that is, its relation to the African slave trade. The particularity of this ethnographic encounter thus elicits questions about how to navigate the ethical implications of abstraction in modernist translations of Iranian ethnography.\n\nConvenors Prof. Roy Dilley (Head of Department of Social Anthropology, University of St. Andrews) Dr. Pedram Khosronejad (Department of Social Anthropology and Research Fellow in The Institute for Iranian Studies, University of St. Andrews). 13-16 June 2008 (conference and film season), 5-18 June 2008 (exhibition) University of St. Andrews, St. Andrews, Fife, Scotland. A conference, film season and photographic exhibition that aim to interpret and theorise visual representations of Iran in ethnographic, documentary and feature films, as well as other visual art forms. Presented by The Department of Social Anthropology, the Institute for Iranian Studies and the Centre for Film Studies of the University of St. Andrews and the Iran Heritage Foundation with the support of: Centro Incontri Umani, Documentary & Experimental Film Center, Documentary Filmmakers Society, Farabi Cinema Foundation, Houtan Scholarship Foundation, Iran Cultural Heritage Organisation, Iranian Young Cinema Society, Bank Julius Baer, Ravayat-e Fath Institute, Visual Media Institute, Young Filmmaker House. Summary In recent years, there has been a steady growth in, and global recognition of, the innovative qualities of Iranian cinema and visual arts. Yet, at the same time, Iran occupies an ambiguous place in the imagination of the West. As a field of academic inquiry, contemporary Visual Anthropology opens up a range of possibilities for examining the ambiguities that surround the imaginations and representations of Iran. Drawing from the broad spectrum of theoretical approaches that span the poetics and practice of filmmaking, photography as well as the art and politics of representation, Visual Anthropology poses a series of questions that may be the basis for dialogue and debate over images of Iran between scholars from a variety of disciplines. A four day programme will investigate these issues within the context of a conference, a film season and a photographic exhibition (the exhibition will remain on view after the conclusion of the four day programme).\n\nCritical Remix Video (CRV) is an emerging form of experimental video art activism that uses as raw materials previously published, often copyrighted audio-visual content in order to critique perceived wrongs and injustices or make political statements. In many cases, CRVs seek to expose dominant ideologies embedded in mainstream media messages, for example authoritative journalism, persuasive advertising or political broadcasts. This paper uses Visual Semiotics to analyse a representative CRV (I Am Not Moving) and shows how this critical video is equally susceptible to ideological influence by revealing the alternative or oppositional ideologies embedded within it. The following questions are addressed: which version of events is the more accurate representation of reality – the narratives presented by mainstream media or the deconstructed versions presented by CRVs? To what extent are the critical messages presented by CRVs diluted by the ideological biases to which they too are subject? How long can Critical Remix survive as a form of alternative artistic practice before being completely subsumed by mainstream media - a trend we can already see happening today? Despite such shortcomings, CRVs represent an opportunity for grassroots activists to have their voices heard on a global stage, utilizing the full potential of digital networking and mobile technologies as well as spreadable media content.\n\nThis paper examines Ari Folman’s Waltz With Bashir (2008) and Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis (2007) to elucidate how artists, distributors, and audiences shape and define the porous boundaries of the documentary genre, and how such perceptions are shaped within a digital context. By analyzing how each film represents reality; that is, how documentaries attempt to represent the real world, this paper explores the elements of performativity within animated documentary as a reflection of both the growing fluidity of the documentary genre and the instability of the indexical in a digital age. In a digital context, where the “real” can be manufactured at an increasing rate, stronger skepticism and cynicism push the documentary genre towards more subjective explorations, with animated documentaries serving as a key example of how genre distinctions have fluctuated in response."
