        "text": "Nasser Taghvai (Persian: ÙØ§ØµØ± ØªÙÙØ§ÛÛâ, also Romanized as NÄsser TaghvÄ'i and NÄser TaqvÄyi; born 10 July 1941) is an Iranian film director and screenwriter.\n\nNÄsser TaghvÄi was born in Abadan, Iran. After early experiences as a story writer, he began filming documentaries in 1967. He made his debut, Tranquility in the Presence of Others, in 1970 and gained the attention of Iranian critics. His concern for the ethnography and atmosphere of southern Iran is notable in his films.\n\nMost of his works have been based on novels. Captain Khorshid is an adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's To Have and Have Not, which won the third prize at the 48th Locarno International Film Festival in Switzerland in 1988."
