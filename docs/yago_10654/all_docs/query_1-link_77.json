        "text": "When Chef Kristen Kish first tried kimchi, she immediately wanted to pile it high on top of a McDonald's quarter-pounder. Unlike many Korean kids who grew up eating kimchi and rice with every meal, she didn't try the spicy fermented cabbage until she was 7 years old, when her adoptive parents brought her to the Grand Rapids Food Festival. The kimchi, she thought, would help cut through the richness of the greasy burger. Genius!\n\nKish was born in Seoul, South Korea as Kwon Yung Ran. After living in a few orphanages as an infant, she was adopted when she was four months old. \"As I grew up, I realized just how incredible it was to go from unwanted and abandoned by my birth mother to being part of a new, welcoming family, who felt only joy at my arrival,\" Kish—Top Chef season 10 winner and Chef Barbara Lynch's former chef de cuisine—wrote in the introduction of her new cookbook, Kristen Kish Cooking.\n\nAfter trying kimchi at that food festival, she couldn't get it out of her mind. \"At that age I was just kind of eating everything and anything. I don't know if I specifically processed that I'm Korean, and this is my food,\" she told me over the phone.\n\nI was also adopted from Seoul (by a white family in upstate New York) and talked to Kish about feeling disconnected from my Korean culture—especially the food. Even though we both like it, neither of us have spent much time cooking the cuisine because we didn't grow up with Korean grandmothers to show us how to make melt-in-your-mouth short ribs or pajeon, the best seafood and scallion pancakes that I have yet to master.\n\n\"I don’t know anything about Korean culture. I was raised by a white family in Michigan, and I didn’t look in the mirror and think about why we didn’t all look the same,\" Kish pointed out. \"They are my family, and that’s all I know.\"\n\nBut because of the way she looks, people often assume that she must make some sort of Asian cuisine. She noted that there have been a couple instances where she says she loves making pasta, and someone responds, \"Oh, do you make ramen?\" She doesn't. And that's not going to change anytime soon. \"I recognize where my lane is and my lane is not cooking that,\" Kish said. \"I love to eat Korean food, but I don't need to cook it. Other people can do it better.\"\n\nInstead, Kish focuses more on French technique, superb pasta, and inventive twists on the comfort food of her youth. \"My grandma's stuffed cabbage will always be one of my favorite dishes that I started helping her with when I was younger than 10, standing on a step stool. And even though my mom definitely bought our three-bean salad in a jar, the charred version in the book is my take on the dish we'd always bring to picnics,\" she said.\n\nSometimes she'll throw in an Asian ingredient into a dish—like the Korean melon in roasted pork and puffed rice crackers in her cookbook—but it's not with an end goal of making an Asian dish. \"If I use soy sauce, it's because I want an umami-salty thing, and I love miso because it's caramel-y, sweet, and salty at the same time,\" Kish explained. \"I look at it just as a Rolodex of different flavors as opposed to where it came from.\"\n\nThe only time that Kish set out to learn Korean cuisine was a few years ago when Lucky Chow did an episode with her and YouTube Korean cook Maangchi. They made kimchi, bulgogi, and japchae together, but Kish admitted she hasn't made any of those recipes again.\n\nHowever, it did leave a lasting impression. When she was in the middle of cooking with Maangchi, the Korean cook gave her a special pouch filled with sesame seeds that she roasted just for Kish. \"There’s this fondness I’ve always had for older Korean women—I soften up, and I can legit feel it inside my heart. They’ll be like 'I’m so proud of you' and it just crushes me, in this really sweet way,\" Kish explained. \"My life is f—king fantastic and I don’t want a Korean family, but we both know that there was another life that could have potentially happened. It’s the 'what ifs?' that get you.\"\n\nHer goal since winning Top Chef in 2012 was to take a trip to Korea with the money she won on the show. \"I’m putting too much pressure on myself because I have a plan of what I feel like would be fulfilling to me. And it's very overwhelming,\" she said with a sigh. \"There's too much expectation on it, as opposed to being just like: get your ass to Korea, go eat the food, and have a great time like you would any other new country. I'm suffocating the push to actually go.\"\n\nGetting in touch with her Korean heritage isn't a priority for Kish right now, but she hopes to one day at least go to the clinic where she was born. I have thought about finding my birthmother, but am hesitant because I don't view that person as my mom at all. Kish agreed, explaining: \"Thinking about it is emotional, yet I feel oddly disconnected because my family is my family. Maybe I wouldn't have become a chef if I grew up in Korea. I was put up for adoption for a reason, whether I was unwanted or they couldn't care for me, and my life wouldn't have been as great. Being in a family that wants you, that life is much better.\"\n\nBuy Kristen Kish Cooking on Amazon now ($25.45).
