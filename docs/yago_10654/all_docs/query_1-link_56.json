        "text": "Cal Poly alumna and Netflix co-founder Christina Kish is coming back to Cal Poly for an interactive talk this Thursday. The talk will be held from 11:10 a.m. to 12 p.m. in the University Union, room 220, and will be available on Zoom for students who want to attend virtually.\n\n“It’s a great opportunity for any student who feels they’re worried that they don’t know their career path,” event coordinator Heather Domonoske said. “I’m really excited to bring in an alumni who can share that she went on multiple career paths and has had amazing opportunities.”\n\nAccording to Kish’s website, she is an accomplished senior executive with more than thirty years of success across a variety of industries from software to entertainment. Kish also does motivational speaking and mentoring in which she brings “years of experience starting and operating consumer-driven companies, problem solving, branding, and navigating life’s curveballs to companies, teams, groups and individuals,” the website’s homepage reads.\n\nAccording to Domonoske, she will be facilitating the conversation with Kish, and the event will feature a roughly 25 minute conversation with questions curated for Kish on various topics such as what she did after Cal Poly and her work with Netflix. Attendees, including those on Zoom, will also have the opportunity to ask her questions, and learn more about her experience and journey to where she is now.\n\n“I think a big thing that students can get out of this talk is just the opportunity to network with someone who has been in this industry for a while is one thing,” business administration and management senior Aryan Lohia said. “You get to learn a little bit about risk-taking and about an entrepreneurship-minded person and what they entail.”\n\nAccording to the event’s website, Kish graduated from Cal Poly with a degree in business administration with a concentration in management information systems. She has worked with many start-ups and learned the importance of making the most of career curveballs.\n\nThe first 100 hundred attendees will be provided with lunch at the in-person watch party and have the possibility of winning a year long subscription to Netflix, according to the event’s website.\n\nFurther information regarding the event can be found here.\n\nUpdate: This article was updated at 4:31 p.m. to reflect a location change for the event."
