        "text": "If you ask those who have traveled to Kish Island about its attractions, they might not mention the Jinn Castle. This mysterious castle, dating back to the Portuguese occupation of the islands, is one of the fascinating and intriguing places on the island. In this article, we will explore its most important features, origin, naming reasons, location, and the thrilling adventures associated with this site.\n\nWhere is the Jinn Castle of Kish?\n\nWhen you travel to Kish Island, numerous attractions await you. Among them, the Jinn Castle stands out as one of the most intriguing. This mysterious castle, now registered as a historical site, is located around Kish, near the Greek Ship. Interestingly, many visitors, especially first-timers, are unaware of its existence and pass by without noticing. The unique design and architecture have turned it into a historical landmark.\n\nWhy is it Called the Jinn Castle?\n\nIn the 1960s, the Jinn Castle was one of the most important border outposts and the main headquarters of SAVAK (the former Iranian intelligence service). The castle was chosen for its strategic location and good visibility for border surveillance. However, after a series of strange events and the mysterious deaths of four soldiers, rumors spread about the castle being haunted by jinns and spirits. Consequently, the island’s governor ordered the outpost to be vacated, and the locals began referring to it as the Jinn Castle.\n\nWhy was the Border Outpost Vacated?\n\nVarious stories explain the evacuation, with the most common being that the soldiers took turns guarding the castle overnight. One morning, officials found all four soldiers dead, with frightened expressions and cold, lifeless bodies. The eerie incident, which was never fully explained, led to heightened fears and the eventual relocation of the outpost. Initially, superior officers dismissed the soldiers’ fears, but the persistent terror led the authorities to relocate the outpost, citing the castle’s age as the reason.\n\nArchitecture and Design of the Castle\n\nThe Jinn Castle of Kish is a relatively small, secluded structure near the Greek Ship, known for the spooky stories that have kept tourists away. The castle, built about 60 years ago, features a rectangular design with watchtowers on both sides. The main building, located at the end of the structure, has two floors, and the most beautiful part is the courtyard with a small garden in the center. Unfortunately, due to neglect, the castle is in a state of disrepair, despite its architectural beauty that reflects the culture of Kish Island’s locals.\n\nVisiting the Jinn Castle at Night\n\nVisitors can explore the castle 24/7 for free. However, due to the eerie tales about jinns, it is advised not to visit at night. If you enjoy a thrill and are not afraid of supernatural stories, you can enter the castle by passing through the blocks at the entrance.\n\nAre the Stories About the Jinn Castle Real or Imaginative?\n\nOne of the earliest stories involves commanders and soldiers hearing strange rustling and whispers at night, leading them to believe the castle was haunted. Many tales about jinns and spirits persist, with visitors often reporting eerie sounds and sights. These stories have turned into local beliefs over time, despite being hard to rationalize.\n\nOne well-known story involves a taxi driver who claimed to see jinns celebrating a wedding near the castle. The driver was so scared that he turned off his car and waited hours for the event to end before leaving. Whether these tales are true or products of overactive imaginations remains unclear.\n\nCurrent Condition of the Jinn Castle\n\nThe Jinn Castle is currently in poor condition, with parts of the structure deteriorating due to neglect. Many locals consider it cursed and haunted, avoiding the area completely. As a result, there is no security, and the entrance is only blocked by a few moveable blocks.\n\nNearby Attractions to the Jinn Castle of Kish\n\nGiven Kish Island’s small size, most attractions are close to one another. This proximity allows visitors to explore multiple sites in a short time. Some notable nearby attractions include:\n\nGreek Ship of Kish: This famous and beautiful site, contemporaneous with the Jinn Castle, is a must-see.\n\nBagu Village: Named after an elderly woman who lived during the Portuguese occupation, this village features attractions like a mosque and a Lur tree.\n\nOcean Park: A top-notch water park with various facilities for men and women.\n\nIn this article, we’ve covered everything you need to know about visiting the Jinn Castle of Kish. If you are afraid of ghost stories, this may not be the best place for you. However, if you seek an adrenaline rush, this mysterious site is worth exploring. If you have visited the Jinn Castle or know other tales about it, share your experiences in the comments below."
