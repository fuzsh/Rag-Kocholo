        "text": "Enmebaragesi (flourished c. 2700 bc) was the king of Kish, in northern Babylonia, and the first historical personality of Mesopotamia.\n\nEnmebaragesi is known from inscriptions about him on fragments of vases of his own time, as well as from later traditions. He was the next-to-last ruler of the first dynasty of Kish. He “despoiled the weapons of the land of Elam,” one inscription asserts. His son, Agga, was the last king of the dynasty, owing to his defeat by Gilgamesh, according to the Sumerian epic Gilgamesh and Agga of Kish."
