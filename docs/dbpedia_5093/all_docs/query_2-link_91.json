        "text": "Article content\n\nBefore being signed in 1971 to Epic records, REO Speedwagon's founding member, Neal Doughty, was minding his own business at the University of Illinois studying to become an engineer. Then he befriended Alan Gratzer, and created a band. Many musicians were involved in the initial stages, eventually leading them to live-show stardom.\n\nMM: When you originally formed the band back in the 60s, did you have any real plans for the future?\n\nND: “We were just students in a dorm. Alan [Gratzer] and I were going to school to be engineering students. We became friends because we both shared the same view when it came to the subject of choice. Engineering just wasn't our calling. Instead of letting ourselves feel trapped, we started playing. Low and behold, REO Speedwagon was born. We really didn't have much idea of where we were going. We were a college bar band. We traveled to play live a lot. Honestly, we found our true calling when we were already a band. Traveling all the time and playing a show to an amped up audience every night is how we discovered who we were. Where we went was all up to the people who payed to see us play.”\n\nMM: What happened to school when you travelled so much?\n\nND: “Eventually, we dropped out. The band was never something we did with half our energy. We waited until our attendance dwindled to almost never, then decided to focus fully on our passion. Explaining that to my parents was hard, but telling them that we were already a successful band in our area softened the blow. I always used to say 'Quit the day job and do the band'.\n\nMM: Do you think starting a band today would go the same as it did for you then?\n\nND: “Even 'back then' a lot of bands had a hard time getting started. We were lucky. Today it seems that you have to be in the 'Hot Top 40', or whatever it's called, to be able to sell a worthwhile amount of records. Today's market has changed, and today's taste has changed.”\n\nMM: Speaking of today's market, what is your take on the tech-world when it comes to promoting music on the web?\n\nND: “I've been vocal about this before. It's not all bad! If it reaches to more members of your audience, that's the point. What people don't understand though, is who is really being ripped off when music is downloaded illegally. I'll reference Eminen [just to use as an example], when people download his latest CD illegally, their first thought is that it won't hurt him because he's a big star. They may be right, but what about the secretaries? Or the smaller bands that share the label? They benefit from Eminen's CD sales too. Everyone matters.”\n\nMM: After all this time, you still decide to tour. You've even got some back-to-back shows this summer. Why do you continue to still tour?\n\nND: “We're kind of known as a live band. It's been a while since we put out our last record, but people still know the songs, even 'after all this time'. They may have seen us before, but now they are bringing their kids to the shows to pass on the love to them. We are all getting up there, but when we get on the stage and feel that love... We automatically feel like we are 20 years old again, for the night. We wouldn't be able to do this without the constant love we've received over the years.”\n\nMM: How do you keep it together as a band?\n\nND: “The key is taking care of yourself. You see, in the 80s ... people did stuff. Stuff you just can't do now. The travel is becoming difficult, to tell you the truth. We [the band] all have great family lives to come back to. It feels as though we are just getting comfortable at home when we have to jet off to a show across the country. I think that's why it's easy to still work with these guys. We understand each other and our individual situations.”\n\nMM: Out of a calendar full of tour stops this summer, Belleville made the list. You guys are part of this year's Empire Rock Fest. What can the audience expect? Any 'Hi Fidelity' hits?\n\nND: “Of course. What kind of REO concert would it be if there wasn't any 'Hi Fidelity' hits? But in all honesty, we are very happy to be coming to Belleville. I'm actually from Belleville ... Illinois. So you could say I feel a connection. This summer is a whirl-wind of concerts, and our audience can have faith we won't disappoint. The comment I hear most about our shows is when people didn't realize we played a certain song. When they realize we are 'that band' that they once rocked out to, we help bring them back to memory lane with all our hits and some surprises.”\n\nMM: Will we hear anything new from REO Speedwagon?\n\nND: “Probably not. We've had our turn. We've had the years of recording, the parties. Now it's time to celebrate our hits and move over for someone new. I don't mean for that to sound bad, because I'm okay with it. We've had some pretty fast times and people still appreciate us. I can't as for more.”\n\nREO Speedwagon will hit the stage July 25 as part as Empire Rockfest 2013. Dennis DeYoung: The Music of Styx and Night Ranger are the beginning acts. Gates open at 6 p.m.\n\nFor more information visit http://www.empiresquarelive.com"
