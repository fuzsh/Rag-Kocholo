        "text": "Jon-Ford Scott – Texas\n\nNomination by Mende Moore\n\nPhotography by Hayly Hext Photography\n\nIssue 71 of Inspiring Teens Magazine\n\n​\n\n​Nomination: Jon-Ford Scott was born with a congenital heart defect, Transposition of the Great arteries which required open heart surgery at 5 days old. Second, he has a speech impediment \"stuttering\" which has been difficult throughout school. When told he couldn't play contact sports because of his heart, he picked up tennis and played Varsity Tennis through High School. When struggling with speech, he joined Theatre and was cast in every production the school offered, winning numerous awards, and qualifying for Nationals in Monologue Acting. Plus, he was actively involved in Speech and Debate qualifying for State in Prose Interpretation.\n\nPhotography by Hayly Hext Photography\n\n​What has growing up with a congenital heart defect helped you learn about yourself and the world around you?\n\nGrowing up with a heart defect makes me really grateful that I have the opportunities I do. I was given a second chance and I want to do all I can to live life to the fullest.\n\nWhat do you wish others knew about stuttering?\n\nI wish people knew that stuttering can’t be helped. You can’t “spit it out” or “just slow down”. I think that sometimes people automatically assume that people with a stutter aren’t as intelligent as they are. We want to be treated just like everyone else. Yes, sometimes it might take me a while to tell my story but let me tell it my way.\n\nTell us about your tennis career.\n\nI started playing tennis in the 7th grade. The seventh grade is when tackle football and basketball started. I had played flag football throughout elementary but once it came time for tackle, I needed a new challenge. Tennis was it. I am now in college and don’t play competitively but I do play for fun whenever I get the chance.\n\nWhat is the hardest part about learning/playing tennis?\n\nLearning and playing tennis came easy for me. The struggle I had was learning to control my excitement, frustrations, and emotions on the court. I am a lefty, so my serve took a while to master as well.\n\nWhat is your tennis team like? Where do you fit in and where do you stand out?\n\nWhen I made the Varsity team my freshman year I was the baby. The team was a tight knit group of older guys. They were all very serious and hardly smiled. They were just that competitive. Bus rides were a bore. After a few days they had taken me under their wings. I became the team leader of our chants, the cheer leader on sideline, and the singer and jokester on the bus rides. They quickly became my best friends and still are.\n\nPhotography by Hayly Hext Photography"
