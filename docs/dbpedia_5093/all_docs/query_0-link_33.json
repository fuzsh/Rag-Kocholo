On stage, she usually played rags-to-riches Cinderella characters who lived happily ever after. Her enormous popularity and famed image were in distinct contrast to her personal life, which was marred by disappointment, tragedy, frequent illness, and ultimately her sudden death due to complications of nasal surgery at age 37.\n\n20th-century American dancers · 553T\n\nActors from Evansville, Indiana · 13T\n\nAmerican Theater Hall of Fame inductees · 561T\n\nBoots Randolph American musician\n\n0 0\n\nrank #5 · 3\n\nHomer Louis \"Boots\" Randolph III (June 3, 1927 – July 3, 2007) was an American musician best known for his 1963 saxophone hit \"Yakety Sax\" (which became Benny Hill's signature tune).
