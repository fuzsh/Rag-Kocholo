        "text": "Neal Allan Doughty (born July 29, 1946, Evansville, Indiana) is an American keyboardist, best known as a founding member of the rock band REO Speedwagon. As of 2017, Doughty is the last original member still playing with the band. He formed the band in the fall of 1967, with original drummer Alan Gratzer.\n\nContents\n\nREO Speedwagon Ridin the Storm Out\n\nPast keyboard instruments\n\nReferences\n\nAlthough he has never been one of REO Speedwagon's primary songwriters, Doughty has written or co-written several of the band's songs. Songs for which he is the sole composer include \"Sky Blues\" from 1974, \"One Lonely Night\" from 1984 and \"Variety Tonight\" from 1987. The latter two songs charted as Billboard singles, with \"One Lonely Night\" cracking the top 20.\n\nHis most notable playing includes the Hammond Organ solo on \"Roll With The Changes\" and the honky-tonk piano work on \"157 Riverside Avenue\". He notes the beginning to \"Can't Fight This Feeling\" is the most difficult and rewarding to play. He was an early adopter of the Moog Synthesizer, which can be heard on the opening swoop of \"Ridin' The Storm Out.\" Currently he is using synths made by Korg and Yamaha and tours with a Hammond B3 Organ routed through Leslie speaker cabinets."
