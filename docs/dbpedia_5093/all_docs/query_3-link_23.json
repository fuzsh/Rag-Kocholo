        "text": "Kimball Cemetery, Liberty TownshipIndex of Kimball Cemetery burials . . . .\n\nThe Kimball Cemetery is the largest cemetery within Liberty Township. The cemetery is still active and very well maintained; it is located at 615 North on County Road 175 West in Section 34. Kimball cemetery has been platted.\n\nThe cemetery was last read in May 1994 by Ed Brozak, Doris Brozak, Patti Duggins, and Karen Hudson for the Northwest Indiana Genealogical Society (NWIGS). The cemetery had been previously read by Mrs. Charles Curry, Mrs. Wesley Diener, Mrs. John Fedorchak, Mrs. Byron Reed, and Mrs. Theodore Roupe on August 5, 1967, for the Meshowe-to-Quad Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution in Hobart, Indiana.\n\nGeneral newspaper items concerning Kimball Cemetery can be found at the bottom of this page.\n\nIn addition to the information provided below, Robert C. Bull transcribed an enumeration of the Kimball Cemetery by the members of the Meshowe-to-Quad Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution (Hobart, Lake County, Indiana) and archived by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Film No. 0849927, Item No. 6). This transcription can be viewed here: Bull Transcription of Kimball Cemetery Inscriptions.\n\nThe cemetery contains the burial of at least nineteen veterans of the Civil War, two veterans of World War I, and several veterans of World War II and the Korean Conflict.\n\nThe first known burial in Kimball Cemetery is that for a tombstone inscribed Hannah, which lists a date of death of July 20, 1844. The next known burial was that of Nancy Amanda Kimball, who died on February 16, 1848.\n\nKimball Cemetery has also been known to be called Hughart Cemetery, Mott Cemetery, and St. Clair Cemetery. The St. Clair family homestead and the St. Clair School House were both located very near Kimball Cemetery, thus the alternative cemetery name. Numerous members of the Hughart family are interred in Kimball Cemetery, as a few of the Mott family.\n\nNOTE: If you have information that you like to add to this database, including corrections, then please contribute it to Steve Shook.

BULL -- Died at his residence in Liberty tp., Porter county, Ind., March 30, 1891. Mr. Theodore S. Bull, aged 62 years and 10 days. Mr. Bull was born in Cayuga co., N.Y., on the 20th of March, 1829. He came to Indiana in 1850, since which time he has been a resident of Porter county and one of its most highly respected citizens. He was married to Ann M. Mason on the 20th of September, 1855. Ten children were born to this union - seven of whom, with the mother, still survive the father. Mr. Bull accepted Christ as his Savior and became identified with the Christian Church in 1867. During the past winter he again renewed his vows to his Maker, took up the duties of Christian living and by his earnest zeal he has robbed this dread blow of its bitterness, to the dear ones upon whom it falls so heavily, and tempered this intense sorrow with the sweet assurance of a reunion where sorrow is unknown. || Obituary 2: Theodore Bull, a prominent citizen and bee man of this county for many years, died at his home Monday morning after a fews hours illness. The funeral services conducted by J. H. O. Smith were held Wednesday at 11 o'clock, at the Phares school house. || Obituary 3: Theodore Bull, Sr. a well-known pioneer farmer of this county, living between Chesterton and Valparaiso died Monday very suddenly. He had been well up to the night before his death, and was in Valparaiso Saturday. On his return home, he took sick, and soon died. His heart was affected, which rendered the attack of grip so fatal. Mr. Bull was a dealer in bees and honey, and had a wide reputation as an apiarist. || Obituary 4: NORTH-WEST CENTER, April 6th, -- Theodore S. Bull, well-known throughout this county, died suddenly last Monday morning. The deceased was an old resident of this county, universally esteemed for his unbending integrity, his general affability in manner, studious habits and general intelligence. In his special line of work (the apiary) he was a recognized authority, and we are informed, was a valued contributor to several of the journals devoted to bees and bee-keeping. Notwithstanding the difficulties of locomotion, a large and thoughtful concourse followed him to the grave. The remains were interred at the Kimball cemetery. || Obituary 5: Mr. Theodore S. Bull, of Valparaiso, Ind., died at his residence on March 30, 1891, aged 62 years. He was in apparent good health until 3 p.m. of the day previous, when in was attacked by La Grippe. He grew worse rapidly until 6 a.m. of the 30th, when death ended his sufferings. His demise was so unexpected that only two of his children were at his bedside, though all seven of them lived within a few miles of the parental residence. He was one of the oldest subscribers to the BEE JOURNAL, and was its firm friend. A biographical sketch of his life may be found on page 373 of the BEE JOURNAL of June 15, 1889. His apiary was kept in a very neat manner, as was his excellent farm. His methods and systematic management were admired by all its visitors. It afforded him the greatest pleasure to show his hives, and explain his methods. Those who attended the conventions in Chicago and elsewhere in this region will remember his enthusiasm and good natured talk about his bees and management. One by one, the old friends are departing, and soon the pioneers will be all gone the way of all flesh.\n\nObituary Source: Obituary 1: The Messenger, Valparaiso, Porter County, Indiana; April 2, 1891; Page 2 || Obituary 2: Porter County Vidette, Valparaiso, Porter County, Indiana; April 2, 1891; Volume 35, Number 14, Page 5 || Obituary 3: The Tribune, Chesterton, Porter County, Indiana; April 3, 1891; Volume 7, Number 51, Page 1, Column 3 || Obituary 4: The Tribune, Chesterton, Porter County, Indiana; April 10, 1891; Volume 7, Number 52, Page 5, Column 2 || Obituary 5: American Bee Journal, Chicago, Cook County, Illinois; April 16, 1891; Volume 27, Number 16, Page 503\n\nBULLOCK, Dolly (Kimball)\n\nBirth: 8 - 1 - 1803\n\nDeath: 12 - 24 - 1883\n\nNotes:\n\nObituary: Obituary 1: From the DAILY VIDETTE of Monday, Dec. 24th inst.

Her funeral will take place to-morrow and her remains will be laid in the Kimball Cemetery. || Obituary 2: OBITUARY. Passed to a higher life at the residence of Geo. Rawson in Valparriso, Mrs. Dolly Bullock, aged 80 years, 4 months and 23 days, mother of Mrs. Geo. Rawson and sister of Harry Kimball, of this county. She was born in V. T. and at the age of 16 was married to Daniel Bullock, lost her husband in Huron co., O., in March, 1854, since which time she has been a widow. She was the mother of 13 children, 7 boys and 6 girls. Of these only 1 son and 2 daughters survive. The son lives in the far west. None but the two daughters, Mrs. Rawson and Mrs. Wm. Williams, were present to witness the burial scene. To sum up her obituary in a few words, she was a woman whose life was thickly strewn with cares, full of sorrows and acquainted with grief, yet amid all she has well borne afflictions, and with an ever willing hand and loving heart contributed largely to the comfort and happiness of those around her. For the past several years she has been a firm believer in the communion of departed spirits, which she professed to richly enjoy. In her last moments she folded her own arms, closed her own eyes, and without a struggle calmly passed to the other shore, bidding adieu to earth and friends with a strong faith that a higher, nobler and better life awaited her, leaving beside her 3 children, 2 brothers and 1 sister to rejoice over her peaceful departure and her new birth.\n\nObituary Source: Obituary 1: Porter County Vidette, Valparaiso, Porter County, Indiana; December 27, 1883; Volume 27, Number 52, Page 5, Column 3 || Obituary 2: Porter County Vidette, Valparaiso, Porter County, Indiana; December 27, 1883; Volume 27, Number 52, Page 5, Column 6\n\nCAMPBELL, Charles A.\n\nBirth: 12 - 31 - 1857\n\nDeath: 4 - 22 - 1938\n\nNotes: Husband\n\nObituary: C.
