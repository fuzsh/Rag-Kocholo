        "text": "Syracuse.com | The Post-Standard is giving the “Syracuse Playlist” a remix this month by looking back at some of the biggest songs of all time from artists with Central New York ties.\n\n“Syracuse’s Greatest Hits” is a new playlist highlighting famous singers and bands from Syracuse and CNY, including Rock and Roll Hall of Famers, Grammy-winning musicians, buzzy rappers, Oscar-winning songwriters, and culturally significant artists. We’ve compiled 33 artists in rock, hip-hop, pop, country, jazz, R&B, swing, blues, and more who have had a major impact, from selling millions of albums (or generating billions of streams) to delivering breakthroughs for their genres or unique backgrounds.\n\nSongs are also featured in a Spotify playlist called “Syracuse’s Greatest Hits.” You can listen with a free Spotify account (or a paid subscription) and click on each artist to hear more of their songs, share them or add them to your own playlists to listen to at home or on a mobile device. (Cell phone data or WiFi may be required.)\n\nEnjoy!\n\n* * * * *\n\nPost Malone - “Circles”\n\nPost Malone was born Austin Richard Post on July 4, 1995, in Syracuse, N.Y. He lived in Central New York until he was 10, when his family moved to Texas because his father (a former wedding DJ in CNY) was offered a job working for the Dallas Cowboys. The Grammy-nominated singer currently lives in Utah, but his family still owns a home in Baldwinsville. “Posty” is one of the biggest musicians on the planet today, with numerous RIAA records broken for platinum singles (12 of his songs, including “Circles,” “Sunflower” and “Rockstar,” have more than a billion streams — each — on Spotify alone) and collaborations with superstars like Taylor Swift, Beyonce, Justin Bieber, The Weeknd, and Ozzy Osbourne. He’s also known for his many tattoos, roles in movies (such as the recent “Road House” reboot) and many business ventures, including Bud Light Super Bowl ads, a professional beer pong league, a clothing brand (Trading Post Apparel), and his own lines of Crocs and Harley Davidson gear.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe Chainsmokers - “Closer”\n\n2012 Syracuse University graduate Andrew “Drew” Taggart is a singer, DJ and producer that’s best known as one-half of the EDM (electronic dance music) duo The Chainsmokers. He started writing their biggest hit, “Closer” (featuring Halsey), which reached No. 1 in 2016 and topped the charts for three months, while he was a student in SU’s Bandier music program and said some of the lyrics were inspired by his actual college experience. However, contrary to campus rumors, the line “roommate back in Boulder” was not originally a reference to Syracuse’s Boland Hall — he did live in BBB (Brewster, Boland and Brockway halls) as a freshman but said that part of the lyrics were based on some of his friends who went to school in Boulder, Colorado.\n\n* * * * *\n\nGrace Jones - “Slave to the Rhythm”\n\nSinger, model and actress Grace Jones was born in Jamaica, moved to Syracuse at a young age and first started performing while attending Onondaga Community College. Her late father has a street named after him in Syracuse, Bishop Robert W. Jones Way, and Grace has a star on the Syracuse Walk of Fame outside the Landmark Theatre. An icon and provocateur of the 1980s and ‘90s, she sang club hits like “Slave to the Rhythm” and “Pull Up to the Bumper” while also appearing movies like “Conan the Destroyer,” James Bond’s “A View to a Kill,” and “Boomerang.” She still performs today, hula-hooping on stage at concert festivals and collaborating with artists like Beyonce, Gorillaz and Janelle Monae.\n\n* * * * *\n\nBarenaked Ladies - “It’s All Been Done”\n\nSteven Page has lived in the Syracuse area for more than a decade since leaving Barenaked Ladies in 2009, currently residing in Manlius and enjoying regular trips to Wegmans and the New York State Fair. He performs as both a solo artist and the leader of the Steven Page Trio, but he’ll always be tied to BNL, the Canadian Hall of Fame band known for songs like “If I Had $1000000,” “The Old Apartment,” “It’s All Been Done” (which he wrote solo) and “One Week.”\n\n* * * * *\n\nREO Speedwagon – “Keep on Loving You”\n\nREO Speedwagon’s original drummer Alan Gratzer was born in Syracuse and performed on the band’s biggest hits, including “Keep On Loving You” and “Can’t Fight This Feeling.” Gratzer, who formed the classic rock group with University of Illinois classmate Neal Doughty in the late ‘60s, co-wrote their early songs and provided backing vocals, plus co-produced 1980′s certified diamond (10 times platinum) album “Hi Infidelity” (featuring “Keep On Loving You” and “Take It On the Run”). Gratzer left the band in 1988 and retired from music, but briefly reunited with singer Kevin Cronin and the current lineup in 2019.\n\n* * * * *\n\nJeff Buckley - “Grace” (with Gary Lucas)\n\nSyracuse native Gary Lucas co-wrote Jeff Buckley’s “Grace,” named one of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time by Rolling Stone. Lucas, who graduated from Nottingham High School in 1969, wrote the music and Buckley penned the lyrics. Lucas today is a guitarist, songwriter and composer whose career also included performing with Captain Beefheart’s Magic Band and the psychedelic rock group Gods and Monsters; working for CBS Records (including promoting The Clash as “The Only Band That Matters”); touring all over the world; more than 50 albums; and scores composed for a long list of films and TV shows including 2012′s “Greetings from Tim Buckley.”\n\n* * * * *\n\nDio – “Rainbow in the Dark”\n\nRonnie James Dio, born Ronald James Padavona in New Hampshire and raised in Cortland, N.Y., is a metal legend who famously popularized the “devil horns” in rock and roll. He started out as a trumpet player, performing at the New York State Music Festival in sixth grade, and later adopted the name “Dio” while forming a doo-wop band at Cortland High School. He became an international star with bands like Elf, Rainbow, Dio, and even replacing Ozzy Osbourne in Black Sabbath. The hometown hero had a street named after him in Cortland (”Dio Way”) and he was posthumously awarded a SAMMYs Lifetime Achievement Award from the Syracuse Area Music Hall of Fame in 2014.\n\n* * * * *\n\nLou Reed - “Walk on the Wild Side”\n\n1964 Syracuse University graduate Lou Reed is a two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Famer, inducted as both a solo artist and for The Velvet Underground, the hugely influential rock band that included guitarist Sterling Morrison, a classmate at SU, and drummer Maureen “Moe” Tucker, the younger sister of Morrison’s friend from Syracuse. Reed, who died in 2013, wrote songs and poetry while at SU, plus hosted his own late-night show on campus radio station WAER called “Excursions on a Wobbly Rail.” He maintained his connections to Syracuse years later, founding the Lou Reed/Delmore Schwartz scholarship for creative writing students in 2007 and sharing the VU song “Head Held High” in a video ad for the school highlighting prominent alumni.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe Rascals – “Good Lovin’” (Felix Cavaliere)\n\nSyracuse University alumnus Felix Cavaliere, who grew up in Pelham, N.Y., is a singer, songwriter, producer and musician best known for his work with The Young Rascals, also known as simply The Rascals, on ‘60s hits like “Good Lovin’,” “Groovin’,” “A Beautiful Morning,” “How Can I Be Sure” and “People Got to Be Free.” He was also a member of Joey Dee and the Starliters (“Peppermint Twist”), had a solo hit with “Only a Lonely Heart Sees,” and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with the Rascals.\n\n* * * * *\n\nGym Class Heroes - “Cupid’s Chokehold”\n\nFrontman Travie McCoy, who grew up in the Finger Lakes city of Geneva, formed Gym Class Heroes in 1997 as a teenager with his friends Matt McGinley and Ryan Geise. The group built a following by performing a mix of hip-hop and alternative rock at Syracuse University and other CNY colleges; band members included Milo Bonacci, who went on to form Ra Ra Riot at SU, and Cornell University alumnus Disashi Lumumba-Kasongo. Gym Class Heroes scored two top 10 hits with the Supertramp-sampling “Cupid’s Chokehold” (feat. Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy) and “Stereo Hearts” (feat. Adam Levine of Maroon 5), plus won an MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist in 2007. McCoy also had a solo hit with “Billionaire” (feat. Bruno Mars).\n\n* * * * *\n\nRa Ra Riot – “Can You Tell”\n\nSyracuse is the only city all the members of Ra Ra Riot lived in together, according to lead singer Wesley Miles. The indie rock band formed in 2006 at Syracuse University when Miles, guitarist Milo Bonacci, bassist Mathieu Santos, and violinist Rebecca Zeller started performing together with cellist Alexandra Lawn, who left the group in 2012, and drummer John Pike, who died in 2007. Ra Ra Riot, which now includes current drummer Kenny Bernard, has released five albums, including the acclaimed 2008 release “The Rhumb Line” and 2019′s popular shift into synthpop, “Need Your Light.”\n\n* * * * *\n\nBenny Mardones – “Into the Night”\n\nBenny Mardones, a.k.a. “The Voice,” was best known for “Into the Night,” one of the few songs to reach the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 twice (in 1980 and 1989). Between those nine years, Mardones struggled with cocaine and alcohol, but when his son was born in 1985, he moved to Syracuse to get clean. He successfully kicked the drug habit and began performing again with a Central New York band, The Hurricanes, in his adopted hometown. “When I was addicted to drugs, Syracuse opened its arms to me,” he told syracuse.com in 2017, before playing his final show at the Turning Stone Resort Casino. “It gave me my life back.
