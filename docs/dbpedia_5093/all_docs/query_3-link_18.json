I want to thank Rick Saunders for the info re: the 7th Cavalry. Sorry to be so late in doing so. I've been putting a lot of things on my \"To Do List\" lately. RE: STROUDS To Rick: I notice that you had an Olive B. STROUD ancestor that enlisted with the 7th Cav. in Nashville one day apart from the James P. MILLER I am researching. Were your Wilson Co. Strouds from Orange Co. NC, particularly the White Cross area? The reason I ask is that I am researching the STRAUGHANS/STRAWNS of Chatham, Orange Counties NC and I noticed in the 1860 census that a Nancy Stroud, age 18, was enumerated in the household of Henderson and Frances Strawn. Also in that census, my Nathan Straun appears to be in the household of A.P. Stroud,age 40. Other Strawns in Orange Co. had Stroud neighbors and it appears to be the case in some other locations. RE: STROUDS/ NEWTONS Do the Wilson County Strouds have any connection with the NEWTONS? I also noted in the 1850 Wilson Co. Census that ARCHIBALD STROUD, age 32, and ROBERT W. NEWTON, age 40, appear to be neigbors and the Stroud children seem to have been named after Robert Newton's wife and daughter. I am also looking at Newtons from North Carolina since one of my Straughans was named ROBERT NEWTON STRAUGHAN, and I wonder if he was named after the surname Newton, as this appears to be a strong trend in this family.

It is so good to hear from someone on the JARRATT line. My husband's great aunt hired a genealogist to do the JARRATT genealogy. She gave me a xeroxed copy of the large notebook which included genealogies on SMITH/JARRATT/MIMS connections. It was written by Austin Wheeler Smith of Cookeville, TN, August 1, 1941. It is very comprehensive with many sources and documentations listed; even has a large index of names. (Wouldn't you know, the name I am searching, Claiborne JARRETT, is not in the index, even though there is a section for him!) I have not verified the sources and documentations at this time, as I am only beginning to research this line. This JARRATT genealogy begins with \"Robert JARRATT, b. perhaps 1625-27; d. 1-21-1709; m. Mary _____ of Ireland, d. 3-31-1707. Both died in New Kent Co., VA. The _Vestry Book and Register_ of St. Peter's Parish, New Kent Co., gives the date of the death of each. His grandson, the Rev. Devereux Jarratt, says that his grandfather was born in Deveruex Co., Essex Street, London, and that he fought under Robert Devereux, 3d Earl of Essex, which would place the date of his birth not later than 1627.\" (p. 100) This Robert JARRATT was listed as the emigrant ancestor of this line. Mr. Smith, the author, lists the following about Devereux JARRATT, the father of Claiborne Robertson JARRATT: (p.154) \"Devereux Jarratt, b. 1-18-1777; d. (will probated 1848-1852); m. 1-5-1800, Martha Elizabeth Roberson, b. 4-11-1781; she was living 1850. He was born in Goochland County, Va., but moved to Wilson Co., Tenn,. where he and his wife are buried and where he owned several thousand acres of land. His will is probated at Lebanon, Tenn. He was the son of Devereux Jarratt of Goochland Co., Va., and his second wife, Molly Duiguid. He may have lived for a short time in North Carolina. CHILDREN: *1. Higdon R. Jarratt, m. Elizabeth Rucker. 2. Nathaniel G. Jarratt. There is no record of his marriage or his whereabouts after September 15, 1846, at which time he deeded his interest in his father's land to his father. *3. Claiborne Robertson JARRATT, m. (1) Catherine Rucker; m. (2) Mary Jane Davis Holt.\" (The * means that he has a section on that individual.) (p. 155) \"Claiborne R. Jarratt, b. 1813; d. 2-11-1884; m. (1)Catherine Rucker, of Rutherford Co., Tenn.; m. (2) 6-1-1829, Mary Jane Davis Holt, of Sumner County, Tenn., d. 11-21-1897 at Walter Hill, Tenn. She is buried beside her husbnd in the family cemetery in Wilson Co.\" It gives more about him. The death certificate for Annie Lee JARRATT Eddins says that her mother's maiden name was Mary Jane WILSON. (p.155-156) CHILDREN by Catherine Rucker: 1. Elizabeth Jarratt *2. Gideon Jarratt, b. 1845, m. Sara Ann Moore (also had a son named Claiborne) 3. Sarah Jarratt 4. Aphilia Jarratt, m. Benjamin Posey 5. Joicy Jarratt, m. N.P. SHANNON. Issue: Ewing, Catherine, Elmo, Lillie, Laura. 6. Laura Jarratt, m. John Epperson. 7. Napoleon Bonapart Jarratt, m. Ella P. Pool. Issue: George, Leon, Louise, Roberta Well, Greg. It looks as if you are descended from Claiborne Robertson JARRATT theough his first wife, and my husband through his second wife. I is possible that the above listing of the children by his first wife could be that #1. Elizabeth and #5. Joicy are the same person. All I can tell you is what is in my copy and other info I have accumulated. There are 95 pages on the SMITH genealogy, 57 pages on JARRATT, 3 pages on MIMS. These do not include the index pages. Hope this helps. I'll do lookups in this source, but can't guarantee it can be done before the Holidays.

Hi Robert! My great-grandfather's middle name was NEWTON! He was born FINAS NEWTON EDWARDS, 1850, Illinois. His father, MC COLLISTER EDWARDS, was born in Saulsbury (Saulsbury Road, near Smith Co. line), Wilson County, Tennessee, in 1823. McCollister Edwards' father, JOHN EDWARDS, was born in South (?)

I have been told there is no town of Saulsbury in Wilson County, but I see there is a Saulsbury Road/Route 40 that crosses into Smith County. McCollister Edwards gave Saulsbury, Wilson County, Tennessee as his place of birth when he was mustered in to Civil War service.

I read with great interest this message concerning John Neal / O'Neal. Is it your experience that the Neal / O'Neal name is interchangeable in the early Wilson County records? Reason I'm asking is that I've been looking for the parents of Nancy O'NEAL, born about 1832, Tennessee, who married McCollister EDWARDS, 11 July 1845, Wilson County, Tennessee. Have not been able to find her, but believe she is either the sister or cousin of William O'NEAL who died in Williamson County, Ill. in 1906. His gravestone indicates he was born in 1820. Probate indicates this William is, at the time of his death, the husband of Mary Melvina (nee Harrison, per her will). \"Decedant left surviving him the unknown heirs of Delila HENRY, deceased, Wichita, Kansas; Nancy EDWARDS, deceased, Crossville, Illinois; and Betsy JENKINS, deceased, Wate.......; residence unknown; and Faith O'NEAL of Watertown, Tennessee\" Might these be sisters of Nancy O'NEAL EDWARDS, and might William be her brother? Apparently this William O'NEAL had no children. Delila HENRY mentioned above is no doubt the Delilah O'NEAL who married Stephen HENRY in Wilson County, 1840. Finas EDWARDS was bondsman. My g-grandfather's name also was Finas EDWARDS, born 1850, so there is a connection here for me. The Nancy EDWARDS mentioned in William O'NEAL's probate may be my g-g-grandmother because she died in Burnt Prairie, White County, Illinois, and the Crossville, Illinois mentioned in the probate records may have been the closest Post Office. I know nothing of Elizabeth (presumed born O'NEAL) JENKINS mentioned in the probate records. Would love to learn more about Faith O'NEAL of Watertown, Tenn. mentioned in William O'NEAL's probate records. Apparently she was still alive in 1906. Could she be a younger sister to my Nancy O'NEAL EDWARDS? Did Faith O'NEAL never marry, so that she could take care of her widowed mother who may have been Dorcas MIDGET O'NEAL HAWKINS who lived to be well over 100 years old, dying in Wilson County, Tennessee about 1900 (give or take 5 years)? A Dorcas MIDGET married John O'NEAL 1812, Wilson County, Tennessee which takes us full circle to your earlier e-mail: \"These two fathers were brothers and sons of JOHN NEAL {O'NEAL) and his wife, ELIZABETH HUNGER- FORD.\" Were there two John NEAL / O'NEALs? Or, did Elizabeth Hungerford O'Neal die, with John then marrying Dorcas MIDGET? Will be very interested to hear what you think of all this! Thanks!

For your information, here are some of the abbreviations I use in my source citations: QCR - Quarterly Court Records CC - Circuit Court * CCR - Chancery Court Records A&ES - Administrations and Estate Settlements W&I - Wills and Inventories DB - Deed Book * MB - Marriage Bonds * the two above so marked mean that I have only a limited number of abstracts from these sources done by myself. Mr. THOMAS PARTLOW has done tremendous work in abstracting these two sources, as well as so many others. Also, please remember that my abstracts cover 1799-1865. In requesting information, I need a first and last name of the individual/individuals you are wishing information about from me and the date(s) or approximate dates in Wilson County, TN. PLEASE request only ONE family at a time. I would ask that you do not request that I trace a family back to NC or VA. If I have information on your family in either state and is readily available to me, I will include it without your requesting it. I am happy to share my collected research which has been collected over the past 45 years without charge to you. I have decided that I am not going to publish my records as the cost to purchasers would be too expensive. My A-C volume of the combined records alone is 300 pages. Should anyone, however, feel so inclined, if I have really helped you, a small gratuity would not be refused. [I am now retired and on a limited income.] For those who wish to do so, I will send you my U.S. mail address. Otherwise, enjoy what I can find for you!

Tipton was born about 1805/08 somewhere in TN. At some point he moved to AL, maybe with his family? He married Diedamia Ray on April 10, 1824 in AL. Either Limestone or Morgan (Cataco) Co. Diedamia was born in 1808 in TN or AL. William and Diedamia's first child was born in AL: John J.Tipton b.abt.1825. By 1830 William had moved his family to Wilson Co. TN were the next four children were born: James A., Alfred Harrison, Rebecca E. and Martha F. They then moved to MO, either Lincoln or Cole Co., by 1840. The next five children were born there: Jonathon Anderson, Mariah Louisa, Charlotte L., Penathe Matilda, and William Joseph. (not sure on the first name of Matilda, hard to read on William's probate papers) William's second and third sons, James A. and Alfred H. moved to Iowa at some point. Alfred returned to MO but James remained. James wrote a biography in Mills Co. In it he stated that he himself was born in Wilson Co. TN and that his father, William, did not have much contact with the family due to some marriage dispute or problem of long ago. One story states that William and his family traveled to MO with the family of Thomas Tiller, Missouri Tipton Tiller and Lydia Tipton. Lydia is the mother of Missouri. I have yet to find proof of this. If they did travel together, why? Is there some connection between Missouri, William and Lydia? Have not been able to find the father of William R. Tipton or Diedamia Ray. Hope someone recognizes this Tipton family and will compare notes.

Sorry, I don't know of any Edwards down near Shawneetown. Mine were further north in Williamson County, Illinois (1850s-1860s) and White County, Illinois after that. They never went to White County, Arkansas. Do you have any EDWARDS in your line? I have not seen the STRAUGHAN and PILKINTON names while doing Illinois research, though I have not looked in Gallatin County, Illinos records. If you do have any EDWARDS for Wilson County, Tenn. in your line, I would be very interested in learning their names. Thanks for taking the time to contact me.

My Tilman Trippe/Tripp's mother was Fredonia Riggan who was born in Wilson County, Tennessee and later moved off and married Sam Tripp/Trippe and when he died moved back to Wilson County, Tennessee between 1867-1870. She\n\nhas listed as 28 in 1870. She had a daughter named Henrietta and a son named Tilman. Her parents were born in North Carolina and she had a relative in the 1880 census living with her by the name of Lerania Riggan. Does this ring a bell to anyone? Also, I have found my great great grandmother on the Stewart side was named Ella Webber and she married George W. Stewart. Does this ring a bell?\n\nCynthia Cline X-Message: #16 Date: Wed, 16 Dec 1998 01:34:04 -0600 From: [email protected] (LaDoris Weber) Subject: [TNWILSON-L] [Long]....GILL w/DOUGHTY and WHEELER BACKGROUND: Robert DOUGHTY, a native of Virginia, was in Wilson Co prior to 1827, purchased land on Round Lick Creek in 1833, died 1845, Wilson Co.

Children of Robert DOUGHTY were: i. William Doughty, born c1800-1803 VA. married Betsy SPRINGS Sep 8, 1829 Wilson Co. David Echols, Bondsman. William purchased portion of Robert's estate lands. Ch. b. Wilson Co. Jordan, Harriet, Pleasant, Emly and Sterling Doughty. ii.Matilda DOUGHTY, b. c1800 Va. married: i. John WHEELER 21 Jul 1823, Fauquier Va John WHEELER d. 1827 Wilson Co TN.

August, 1831 Wilson Co to Sarah COOKSEY. Following ROBERT DOUGHTY'S c1845 death, a portion of the land was sold and it was necessary for his heirs to sign a Deed of Relinquishment. BENJAMIN W. GILL was among those signing the Deed of relinquishment .....\"on Oct 11, 1847 the following persons signed relinquishing their rights to this property: William DOUGHTY, Lucinda DOUGHTY, Lorenzo D. DOUGHTY, Henry WHEELER and BENJAMIN W. GILL. [Robert Doughty, decd].\" WILLIAM B. GILL bought 4A of land in Wilson Co from Lorenzo D. DOUGHTY on Nov 27 1849, wit. by William Lane Swann and G. W. Brittle. Somewhere in my paper files is a notation that a GILL and COOKSEY were partners in a store. Is someone researching the GILL families in Wilson County and, if so, are you able to identify the above GILLS and explain their relationship to our DOUGHTY family. WHY was Benjamin W. GILL included as an heir to the estate of our xxxGrandfather, Robert DOUGHTY? Will appreciate any assistance on these GILLS; & will share data with interested parties.
