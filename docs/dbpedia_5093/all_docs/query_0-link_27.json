        "text": "It finally happened.\n\nAt a wet and slippery classic rock show on Friday night, someone in Indiana finally told me I was too young to be at this particular concert. She cut deeper still, telling me in no uncertain terms: \"This is our music. Your generation's music isn't as good.\"\n\nIt was only the 100th time I've heard it, and in roughly 95 of those cases, I've argued my generation's case.\n\nBut Styx was on stage. Damn. She had me on this one.\n\nMore: Indiana State Fair adds Trace Adkins, KC & The Sunshine Band to 2022 free stage lineup\n\nIt was an Illinois double feature at Ruoff Music Center, as Styx and REO Speedwagon co-headlined a high-voiced, guitar-heavy evening.\n\nREO Speedwagon frontman Kevin Cronin put it succinctly when he told the crowd it wanted \"some of that good ol' Midwestern, meat and potatoes, straight ahead rock 'n' roll.\"\n\nWhat followed was indeed the most Midwestern thing I have yet seen, as REO launched into \"Ridin' the Storm Out\" for a packed crowd that had thus far done exactly that, as rain had greased the amphitheater's hill for the last two hours.\n\nAnd then it stopped raining. Just for that song. It started back up again for \"Keep on Loving You.\"\n\nIndiana, man.\n\nReview: Fans power through wet, muddy Carb Day concert featuring Rick Springfield, Kings of Chaos\n\nREO Speedwagon was solid. And loud. Opening act Loverboy was also quite fun, but they're Canadian, so it messed up my Midwestern theme.\n\nBut Styx was unspeakably good.\n\nThe only other time I've seen Styx and REO Speedwagon was in 2009, when I was 20.\n\nI've lost more than a step or two since that day, not least of which in my own guitar playing. I've gained plenty, too, particularly in the midsection and gray hair.\n\nStyx, however, has not.\n\nGuitarist and singer Tommy Shaw is 68 years old. No one who is seven years older than my mother has any right to sing that high, shred that hard and be that cool.\n\nSorry, mom. And Tommy. I love you both.\n\nI go to a lot of classic rock shows, and you start to learn the signs of a group losing a step.\n\nThey sing an octave or two lower or take some choruses off. They have younger touring musicians carry the load or take it a little easier in middle section of the set before turning back on for the big hits.\n\nI saw none of that with Styx.\n\nThey rocked from front to back, \"Blue Collar Man\" to \"Renegade.\" Of particular note was an excellent Shaw solo during the \"Come Sail Away\" outro.\n\nI am not particularly a Styx fan in my day-to-day life. I have never purchased one of their albums. I don't think I could even name one of their albums, apart from \"Styx.\" I've only ever heard more than one Styx song in a sitting twice, on Friday and in 2009.\n\nBut I can think of maybe a handful of bands I enjoy more live.\n\nReview: 'It's the energy and the crowd.' Phish bring groove, wailing guitar to friendly Ruoff show\n\nClearly, this was a tough act to follow, but REO Speedwagon gave a pretty strong set.\n\nI'd obviously be in one camp if forced to choose between the two, but I seemed to be in minority in this crowd. Indianapolis loves itself some REO Speedwagon, and Cronin reciprocated.\n\n\"There is nothing like the sound of 16,000 Hoosiers,\" he told the crowd early in the set.\n\nThe band's keyboardist and only remaining founding member, Neal Doughty, is himself a Hoosier. He was born in Evansville.\n\n\"The people of Indianapolis mean so much to us,\" Cronin said a bit later on. \"This is one of the first two cities in the country to really embrace REO Speedwagon.\"\n\nThis checks out in my limited experience. When I saw both groups in California, the response to REO Speedwagon was nowhere near as strong as in Indiana.\n\nCronin's first Indianapolis show with REO Speedwagon was in 1972, he explained. Their first song was \"Like You Do,\" which the band then cranked out a stirring rendition of 50 years later.\n\nBoth bands actually swapped Indy stories on Friday, in fact.\n\nDuring the Styx set, Shaw explained he wrote the lyrics to \"Too Much Time On My Hands\" while driving through Indiana and back to the group's base in Chicago.\n\nCronin's vocals were strong, apart from a lackluster \"Keep On Loving You.\" In fact, his mic could have been turned a bit, as he was really loud. But they're a loud band, so I dig it.\n\nGuitarist Dave Amato was not to be left behind in the shredding department. REO may be known best for its ballads, but they can thump.\n\nThat generational knife was twisted yet again when Cronin asked the audience to picture it was 1981, and they just got the new REO Speedwagon record.\n\nSmiles washed over a collective sea of Boomers, but I had to sit it out. That was seven years before my birth.\n\nDespite my age handicap, I still managed to enjoy all three groups.\n\nBarring an act of God — and I can't rule it out given the way the sky looked Friday night — I will spend most of Saturday covering a festival centered around the music of \"my generation.\"\n\nBut it's hard to imagine I won't be singing \"Blue Collar Man\" to myself on that drive home, too.\n\nLooking for things to do?
