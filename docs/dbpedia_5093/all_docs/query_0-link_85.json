        "text": "Lloyd Rose\n\nLloyd Rose, 1916-2011\n\nLloyd Rose, long time member of the Greater St. Louis Archaeological Society, died on Feb 11, 2011, at the age of 95. He was able to play cards with friends until about two weeks before he died.\n\nHe collected artifacts for approximately 70 years, mostly in North St. Louis County, Missouri. It is a very rich archaeological area overlooking the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. The full spectrum of prehistoric sites from Clovis to Proto-Historic can be found there. He also collected in the Aleutian Islands when he was stationed there in WWII. His in-laws were farmers in North County which gave him access to many sites. He was well known for writing the location of his finds with the date found on the artifacts. He documented many of his discoveries in the Central States Archaeological Journal.\n\nLloyd and his wife LaVerne regularly attended artifact shows in Missouri and western Illinois. It was always a pleasure to visit with them. Their finds enhance the artifact frames of many Midwest collectors. He was also a craftsman and made many artifact frames for sale, most of which are probably still exhibiting artifacts. LaVerne’s health deteriorated before Lloyd’s and he visited her faithfully every day while she was in a nursing home. They are survived by son Gerald and daughters Marilyn and Diane and several grandchildren.\n\nLloyd was one of the old time collectors, seriously interested in artifacts and the people who made them. He was respected by his contemporaries and admired by those who were younger. His interest led him to walk hundreds of miles, probably more than anyone in the area will again because many of the sites are gone. His legacy is the artifacts with his distinctive writing and the knowledge he shared with other collectors.\n\nsubmitted by Alan Banks\n\nJuly 2011 Vol 39 No# 3\n\nBob Eagle Rampani\n\nIn Memorial: Bob Eagle Rampani\n\nOn Monday morning, April 18, the Greater St. Louis Archaeological Society lost one of our best ambassadors for avocational archaeology. Bob had gone turkey hunting at his son's farm near Forestell, Missouri. He never finished that hunt.\n\nBob is survived by his mother, one brother, two sisters, four sons, and one daughter along with eleven grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.\n\nBob served with distinction as a demolition expert in the Army during the Korean War and received several decorations. He retired from the McDonnell-Douglas Corporation, where he worked as a sheet metal specialist.\n\nSeveral years ago Bob joined the Laureates Society. He published two books of poetry and one book of short stories. There was a third poetry book being typed, but it may not be published.\n\nHe joined the G.S.L.A.S around 1980 and became one of our biggest supporters. Bob was an introvert and it took him many years before he started his career with us. He had his own way of saying things, and he was difficult to understand at times. Many of us can remember his calling a discoidal, “dis-ka-del.”The more he learned, the more involved he became. He saw that our Secretary/Treasurer was having difficulties\n\nkeeping up with the demands of a growing society and offered to help him with the sales of posters. That was fifteen years ago and the start of Bob’s becoming the unofficial business manager of the G.S.L.A.S. Several years ago we changed the Constitution to add the position of Business Manager and Bob finally became “official.”He took great delight in signing up new members and renewals and selling all the publications we offer. There was no such thing as turning down a question about artifacts. He loved helping people, especially those new to the hobby and children. “This society cannot continue unless we get the kids involved,”he was always preaching. Bob considered friendships more important than any of his artifacts. He told me many times that his collection was nothing compared to all the friendships he had acquired while in this society.\n\nWe are going to miss his gruff voice, the backwoods way of his speech, his dry sense of humor, and his tireless efforts to make ours a better society. We have lost a true friend. May God bless you, Bob!\n\nBy John H. Beyes John D. Turin Sr.\n\nJohn D. Turin Sr.\n\n1935 - 2002\n\nJohn Turin, a long-standing member of the Greater St. Louis Archaeological Society, died on Easter Sunday, March 31, 2002, at the age of 66. He was buried at the Jefferson Barracks National Historic Cemetery. John is survived by his wife, Ruth Louise, four children and ten grandchildren.\n\nJohn served as a fireman and fire marshal for the city of St. Louis, Missouri, for over thirty years. He began his service in 1967 and only retired recently. John was a masterful cook and served as chief chef at many benefits and occasions.\n\nJohn was greatly interested in American Indian archaeology, artifacts and the prehistoric past. He had an eye for finding artifacts and a passion for recording and documenting them for the future. He lamented the destruction of the land and sites they had roamed. Much of his spare time was spent in search of these prehistoric artifacts. John was very successful in this endeavor and found an abundant number of artifacts. Many of his artifacts find were featured in articles and photographs in teh Central States Archaeological Journal.\n\nJohn always wanted to share the joy of discovery, the excitement of a find and his knowledge of history with scout groups, historical societies and school children. He used displays of his personal finds to enhance the presentations that he gave, and he gave those presentation whenever the opportunity presented.\n\nJohn's greatest thrill came with the discovery of the artifact itself. He studied them and learned a great deal. Still, he could never find enough artifacts to satisfy his appetite for discovery, an admirable goal we should all have. He was an inspiration to all who knew him. God bless you, John, you will be greatly missed.\n\nsubmitted by Bob Eagle Rampani\n\nJuly 2002 Vol 49 No# 3\n\nGlenn E. Quinn\n\nGlenn E. Quinn\n\n1924 - 2001\n\nThe Illinois State Archeological Society and the Central States Archaeological Societies lost a long, influential and faithful member with the passing of Glenn E. Quinn on January 17, 2001. He had a passion for Indian artifacts and attending the artifact shows that where such a source of enjoyment for him.\n\nGlenn was born in Mt. Vernon, Illinois, on January 3, 1924. He was the son of Robert M. Quinn and Elizabeth (Lizzie) Quinn. He had two brothers and one sister. It was in Illinois where his dad and mom had a farm, that his interest in Indian artifacts began as a child.\n\nGlenn was a veteran of World War II and served as a cook in the US Army. Cooking would remain another hobby that he truly enjoyed throughout his life. He entertained many friends over the years with his ability in cooking field while discussing the latest finds and shows pertaining to artifacts.\n\nAfter serving with the US Army he moved to Mt. Vernon, Indiana, where he bought a farm, married and raised a family consisting of two sons, two daughters and one stepdaughter. Along with farming he worked at Babcock & Wilcox as an x-ray inspector for many years. After retiring from B & W he spent most of his spare time hunting for artifacts and collecting for his impressive collection. He had many different kinds of artifacts, but his favorite was quality flint, especially from the Archaic cultures.\n\nHe was a speaker at many schools over the years where he used his vast knowledge of artifacts for giving presentations. He was an excellent speaker and would always take along displays for the students to see.\n\nGell will be truly missed at artifacts shows, as he was known to be friendly and outgoing man. He always had very nice displays and loved mixing and talking to others who shared his deep interest in Indian artifacts.\n\nsubmitted by Courtney L. McKowen\n\nJuly 2002 Vol 49 No# 3\n\nDale R. VanBlair\n\nDale R. VanBlair\n\n1921 - 2017\n\nDale R. VanBlair, 96, of Belleville, Illinois, died Friday, September 15, 2017.\n\nVanBlair was born June 17, 1921 in Quincy, Ill., which was also the hometown of his late wife, Mary, nee Stickler, VanBlair. They were married April 9, 1949 and were happily married for 53 years until Mary E.'s death in 2002.\n\nFor 26 years VanBlair taught at Belleville West High School until he retired in 1982 as Chairman of the English Department. In 2017 he was inducted into The Belleville West Wall of Fame.\n\nAlways on the go, VanBlair's passions included reading, his favorites being Thoreau, Twain, and Dickinson; fishing; bowling and had a perfect game at age 83 and again at 87; and archaeology, he was a ten year editor of the Central States Archaeological Society Journal. He was a proud WWII Army Air Forces veteran and wrote a book detailing his experiences as 8th Air Force Tail Gunner on a B-24, Looking Back: A Tail Gunner's View of WWII.\n\nHe was active in his church, Westview Baptist Church in Swansea, Ill., where he was honored as Deacon Emeritus. He was also a member of the VFW in Smithton, Ill.\n\nVanBlair was preceded in death by his wife, Mary E., nee Stickler, VanBlair of Quincy/Belleville, Ill.; parents, Cecil and Lora, nee Orr, VanBlair, both of Quincy, Ill.\n\nHe is survived by his daughters, Deborah VanBlair of Belleville, Ill. and Karen (Doug) Weaver of Waterloo, Ill.; and granddaughter, Dr. Elizabeth (Dr. Dennis Moore) Weaver of Louisville, Ky.\n\nJohn F. Berner\n\nJohn F. Berner\n\n1932-2019\n\nOver the past few years we have seen several notable collectors pass away. One of those who was very influential in the world of collecting artifacts passed away at his home on April 23, 2918. John F. Berner, sometimes known as \"the Colonel\" spent the last few years of his life in seclusion and few younger collectors have heard of him. But if you collected from the 1970's - 2000s he was a force to be reckoned with.\n\nJohn F. Berner 1932-2019\n\nJohn was editor of this publication for just a few years but was it's savior. At the beginning of 2005, the Journal was without an editor. John Crowley stepped up to do one issue (April) but could not find anyone to fill the role. Without an editor, the publication of the Journal would have been over. John stepped into the position and literally saved this publication from demise. He served for a bit more than two years, talking me into taking over the editorship at the beginning of 2008. he was awarded a plaque for his service to the Central States, and the stated several times that it was one of the few times he truly treasured.\n\nBut this was not the only publication he was involved with! John served as president of The Artifact Society as well as three terms as president of G.I.R.S. He was additionally editor of G.I.R.S. publications, including The Redskin, Prehistoric Artifacts of North America and Prehistoric American, for nine years. In 1984, when the organization folded, it was his and Dr. Neil Brown's personal recruitment efforts that resurrected the G.I.R.S and got the organization and its magazine back on track.\n\nJohn was also instrumental in promoting the use of authentication, and papered artifacts for many years (American Artifacts Inc. and American Antiquities Inc.). John's knowledge of some artifact types were well known throughout the collecting world, and at shows he would be handed pieces after pieces for his opinion. Over the years he could be very blunt with his thoughts, which turned some collectors off, but he always meant well. He wrote dozens of articles about his main subject, which was exposing \"fakes\" and those who made them. He wrote a book that came out in 2000 American Indian Artifacts - Genine or Reproduction, that included many of his articles as well as images from his massive library of photos showing fakes and real artifacts.\n\nJohn amassed a huge collection over the years, and constantly upgraded. When business problems overwhelmed him in the late 1990's, he sold off the majority of his pieces, retained only a few prized artifacts. You can identify objects he collected by his catalog number, always starting with a J and ending with a B (J112B). He personally knew many of the important earlier collectors including Hubert Wachtel, Gray Ladassor and Dr. M.E. Hawes, and would always share stories. He was also a certified artifact appraiser and looked at countless collections during his lifetime. He appeared in Whos's Who in Indian Relics #3 and #10.\n\nJohn was a prolific writer and for many years was the guiding force of several artifact organizations. It is rare that someone has such a big impact on the world of collecting. John's knowledge and expertise as well as his lifelong crusade against \"fakes\" will be sorely missed. He was a character that you either loved or hated, but respected regardless - Submitted by Steven R. Cooper\n\nJuly 2019 Vol 66 No# 4\n\nRichard M. Burnett\n\nRichard M.

Pleasant, Iowa. He is survived by two daughters and seven grandchildren.\n\nWarren was born in 1916 at Bonaparte, Iowa, but spent most of his life in Mt. Pleasant. When a young boy, he was stricken with polio, making it difficult to walk. This handicap slowed Warren down very little as he fished, hunted and walked many miles looking for Indian artifacts. While always a fisherman and hunter, Warren didn't seriously take up artifact hunting until 1956 when he was forty years old, and he continues to hunt them until 1976. He especially made surface collections from two Hopewell sites, two Late Archaic sites, a multicomponent site and many other sites along the skunk River in Henry and Jefferson Counties. Because he labeled and catalogued his finds by site location, his collection is of great value to any study of the Skink River Drainage.\n\nAmong his finds was the Holland cache of 14 spearpoints reported and pictured in the January, 1971, Central States Archaeological Journal. Three of this cache also appear in the Special Bulletin #4, Guide to the Identification of Certain American Indian Projectile Points by Gergory Perino. Warren was particularly fond of early man points and delighted in finding a nice Dalton or Nebo. He found a superb 4 1/2 inch Clovis, two saddle bannerstones, and some nice Keokuk axes along with a variety of points and tools from all the prehistoric cultures of his area. He was the first to find and recognize core preparing tools as specialized tools in his area.\n\nAnyone who visited at Warren’s was always made to feel welcome. He was always helpful with suggestions and encouragement to a beginning artifact hunter and cooperated with professionals any time he could. He appeared in Who's Who in Indian Relics #3. He attended the Keasaqua and Quincy shows for years and was a member of the Hawkeye State Archaeological Society. His many friends made through his interest in Indian artifacts will miss him and remember him as a real gentleman Indian artifact collector with a genuine interest in learning and sharing his knowledge about the cultures of his area.\n\nGary Vandyke\n\nApril 1989 Vol 36 No# 2\n\nCharles Bosworth (C.B.)

Calvin Drafahl, 62, a longtime member of the Badger State Archaeological Society of Wisconsin passed away after a long fight against a debilitating heart disease. He is survived by his wife, Virginia, and his six children.\n\nI taught Cal how to surface hunt. He had come to me in 1960 and asked if I would teach him the art of arrow hunting. It didn't take him long to learn the tricks of the trade, and soon he and his wife and children were out hunting every chance they had. Cal put into practice and honored the unwritten law not to intrude on another hunter's territory. On Cal's very last hunt, we went to a field that was new to him. He had had fair luck but Cal kept wanting to go to one corner of the field. I had told him that the walk would be useless, as I had never found any signs of artifacts there. He persisted and came back with a beautiful 3/4 grooved axe. It was a perfect way to end his arrow hunting days. His memory will walk with me this spring. I will miss him.\n\nRalph Hammerly\n\nJuly 1992 Vol 39 No# 3\n\nF.M. (Ray) Snyder\n\nF.M. (Ray) Snyder\n\n1908 - 1992\n\nRay Snyder of Ten Mile, Tennessee, one of the grand old men of Indian relic collecting, passed away on October 14, 1992. Ray was born at Etowah, Tennessee, on January 13, 1908, and beginning with picking up points at ten, spent 74 years involved with Indian relics. When in his teen and living in Marietta, Georgia, on weekends Ray would board a northbound train engineered by his father and get off in Cartersvillle, Bartow County Georgia. He would spend the day hunting Indian relics in the Etowah River bottoms at the famous Etowah Ceremonial Site and then board his father’s southbound train that evening back to Marietta.\n\nRay excavated many sites. Probably his most extensive were at the Savannah Farms Site in Polk County, Tennessee. Relics marked 40P01 most assuredly came from Ray's excavations at this site because that was his site number. It was here that he recovered a monolithic axe from the log tomb, and Ray believed that he recovered 90 or more percent of the relics found at this site. He also worked at the Hiwassee Old Town (Conasoga) Site in the same county, where he found several silver trade items. Included were one Spanish and two English bracelets. The two English bracelets where traced by the hallmarks to London, England, where they were made in the late 1700's, and one traced to the silversmith who made it (Fletcher Jolly, III, 1975, Central States Archaeological Journal 22(3):119-122). This site also produced all the beads utilized in the Tennessee Colored Bead Charts published in 1978 by Gerald R. Fenstermaker. Ray introduced Bill Stiles, Curator of the Museum of the American Indian in New York City, to the Great Tellico Site, former capitol of the Cherokee, in Monroe County Tennessee. In their excavations at this site Ray uncovered a grave containing 18 shell gorgets.\n\nThe experiences of Ray regarding the abundance and easily found relics at some of the significant sites in the early days of this century are hard to imagine today. For example, Ray once found 4 or 5 Cherokee animal effigy elbow steatite pipes in one day surface collecting at one of the Overhills Cherokee village sites on the Little Tennessee River in Monroe County, Tennessee.\n\nRay worked 35 years as a engineer on, and retiring from, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. He is survived by his wife of 62 years, Pearl; two daughters, McRae (Mrs. Harry) Williams and Judy (Mrs. Bill) Weber of Athens Tennessee; three grandchildren, Johnny and Jimmy Cross and Jackie Bell; and to great-grandchildren, Tristan and Ashlen Cross. Ray was a member of the First Christian Church of Etowah. He was a current member of the Greater St. Louis and Arkansas Archaeological Societies and a former member of the Tennessee Archaeological Society. He was involved in establishing and providing relics for several museums, including his own Museum of the Tennessee Indian in Townsend, Tennessee, which he and Pearl operated for seven years in the late 1960's and early 1970's. His collection at that time was illustrated in Who's Who No. 3.\n\nRay attended many relic shows throughout the Southeast and Midwest and was a personal acquaintance of most of the major collectors in theses regions. He will be greatly missed but not forgotten.\n\nV. Gary Henry\n\nJuly 1993 Vol 40 No# 3\n\nRandal N. Jones\n\nRandal N. Jones\n\n1941 - 1993\n\nIt is with deepest regret that I must report the passing of one of our stalwart members and dearest friends, Randal Jones.\n\nRandal N. Jones, 51, of Paoli, died Friday, February 12, 1993, at Orange County Hospital where he had been rushed by ambulance from his home. He was born March 12, 1941, in Hardinsburg to Charlies and Lucy Setser Jones. He was married to Donna Shirley. Surviving with his wife are his mother of Milltown, Indian; one son, Steven Jones of Paoli; one daughter, Leisha Sherron of Paoli; one brother Robert Jones of Onelaska, Wisconsin; and one granddaughter, Sarah Jones.\n\nHe was a self-employed antiques and artifact dealer and collector. He was a member of Eastview Baptist Church, Central States Archaeological Society, Indiana Archaeological Society, Antique Bowie Knife Association and the Orange County Historical Society.\n\nRandell could be found at nearly every show selling frames and, more importantly, visiting with his many friends. Although appearing to be of an unassuming nature, Randal possessed a simple homespun wisdom and knowledge that can only be found in a chosen few. With Randal there was no pretense. What you saw was what you got. He was genuinely concerned about people, and wanted to see people go home happy.\n\nHe was a peacemaker and the glue that held many of us together. He could find that common thread of acceptance without compromising himself or his values. It is very seldom in life that we have the chance to meet a Randal Jones. His honesty and goodness, his compassion and sincerity touched all who knew him, while he simply remained \"Randal.\"\n\nPat Mooney\n\nJuly 1993 Vol 40 No# 3\n\nArnold Richter\n\nArnold Richter\n\n1919 - 1992\n\nArnold Richter, noted collector and authority on Indian artifacts, passed away on Tuesday, May 5, 1992, in his home in Fairmount, Illinois. Arnold suffer a massive heart attack. He was born at Bronson, in Vermillion County, Illinois, on August 12, 1919. He spent thirty-five years working as a rural letter carrier. He retired in April, 1982. He lived in the Fairmount area for 72 years.\n\nArnold Richter served in the Army as a sergeant during World War II. He served in the Pacific and he served five years.\n\nArnold had been a collector since he was 16 years old. He wrote article on Indian relics for the Central States Archaeological Journal and local papers. He started writing a book on the relics of the area, which will hopefully be published in the near future. He also started the Wabash Valley Archaeological Society. In 1958 he and Tom Razmus had the meetings in Georgetown, Illinois, and Jamaica High School, Jamaica, Illinois.\n\nArnold's contributions have been of untold value and assistance to the beginner as well as to the average and advanced collector. For many years he had gone out of his way to advise and inform any and all collectors who sought his opinion.

Variously known as \"John,\" \"Johnny,\" or \"Doug,\" he plied his trade throughout the Midwest, bringing together people and their collections. Always willing to deal (while complaining about getting \"took\" again), his country charm and easy manner put him on everyone's \"favorite curmudgeons\" list.\n\nHe joined the dealer \"network\" only in 1970, after he and his wife, Althea, sold the motel they had been running since 1955. Retirement made him restless. Without the business to occupy his thoughts, he returned to a childhood love of American Indian art and artifacts. As a boy he had collected surface finds around his home in Amity, Missouri. He had kept a few points through the years, and these inspired him to renew his collecting interest.\n\nLiving in Baraboo, he founded and helped organize the central Wisconsin show. He was a member of the Wisconsin Society, but his major contribution were made at sales and auctions. At these he could be found sharing laughter, information, and good times with a network of collectors, dealers, and auctioneers. Ever ready with a quip, comment, or more often than not, cautionary warning. John was always full of cheer. Whether he was running up another bidder or just making wisecracks during sales, he was determined to have fun.\n\nIn addition to his wife, Althea, John is survived by a daughter, Suzi, and the cherished memories of his many friends.\n\nApril 1998 Vol 45 No# 2\n\nTom Razmus\n\nTom Razmus\n\nThomas (Tom) Stanley Razmus, noted collector and author of Indian artifacts passed away on Friday, June 13, 1997, in his home in Georgetown, Illinois.

He was a member of the Piedmont archaeological society of North and South Carolina as well as many other archaeological societies. He began collecting at the young age of five with two points given to him by his grandfather. During his youth, he lived throughout the United States and collected from many locales, including the famous Cahokia Mounts site in 1919 and 1920, where he met Warren K. Moorehead. He returned to the site 64 years later and found another point.\n\nEven though he amassed a collection that numbered in the hundreds of thousands of relic, Loy was much more than just a collector. He as an avid student of American archaeology before most of us were born. He wrote many articles about Indian artifacts and was instrumental in many Southeastern point types being named. The very rare Alamance Point of the Paleo Period was initially studies and named from examples in his collection when he lived in Haw River, North Carolina. Until his health failed him, Loy regularly attended meetings of the Virginian and North Carolina Archaeology Societies, and no Piedmont or Old Dominion archaeology Society relic show would have been complete without Loy displaying his artifacts. He donated over 200,000 Indian relics to the Smithsonian Institution and about 300,000 pieces to the Preswould Foundation of Clarksville, Virginia, where many can be seen on display today at Prestwould.\n\nLoy was preceded in death by his beloved wife, Beatrice Hopkins Carter, and is survived by three daughters; Clara Carter Edwards, Dorothy Carter Hinman and Jill Carter Lavagnino; eleven grandchildren; twenty-two great-grandchildren and four great-great grandchildren.\n\nYour many friends miss you, Loy, but I suspect that you are now with other friends talking about Indian reclis and looking for a good relic field in heaven.

Wright, Sr.\n\nOctober 30, 1913 - April 11, 2001\n\nThe Illinois State Archaeological Society has lost a long and loyal member. Carl M. Wright Sr. of Grand Tower, Illinois, by the Mississippi River bluffs, passed away April 11, 2001 at the age of 87 years and six months. I called him Dad. He was a member of the ISAS since the beginning of the New Series in 1950. Carl Sr. began collecting artifacts as child in 1922 while living on a farm near Pomona, Illinois. The farm was new Peter's Cave which is similar to Graham Cave in size and geomorphology. As an adult, he read every book he could find on archaeology and was self-taught.\n\nMr. Wright assembled a devoted collection of personal finds. He was also an early experimental archaeologist who corresponded with professionals such as Don Cragtree and John Reynolds. Carl's efforts yielded three distinct knapping techniques during the late fifties and early sixties. He learned through trial and error; he studied Borde's technique and shared this information when little was known about knapping. He never sold or traded replicas, but did give them away as gifts and tokens of esteem. He made fine copper and stainless steel belt buckles. He also made a typological set of classic point forms out of hammered copper that rivaled cast products; he used this for teaching. This is a one of a kind group and received an award of excellence at an Olive Branch artifact show a few years ago. His works were published in the Southern Illinoisan newspaper three times, and a very small portion of this collection was in \"Who's Who\" in Indian Relics #5. Carl worked with Irvin Peithmann, Archaeological Curator for Southern Fountain Bluff near Gorham, Illinois. He was also a major contributor to Dr. Brian Bulter from the Center for American Archaeological Investigations at SIUC and fully funded a salvage test excavation at Bishops Shelter at Fountain Bluff in 1968. The excavation of this site was overseen by Dr. Phil Weigand and Carl Kuttriff from SIUC. This is archived by this writer and Dr. Frank Rackerby. This was done with his guidance. Dad also worked with Professor Gerald Thompson of Southeastern Missouri State University on the Twenhfel Hopeswell Mound group.\n\nCarl M. Write Sr. was a great grandfather, provider, husband, friend, shooter, fisherman, and amateur archaeologist. He served 36 years at the Central Illinois Public Service Company at the Grand Towers Power Station. He retired as the lead turbine operator. He was a member of the local #148 of the Operating Engineers. Dad attended artifact shows even after he became disabled. He was a tribute to what we as avocational archaeologist can accomplish if we have the mindset and fortitude to document what we find. Everyone who knew him will miss him greatly.\n\nCarl M.

An avid amateur archaeologist, she and her husband, Edward, spent several months each winter on a ranch in Del Rio, Texas, surface hunting and locating Paleo and Archaic Indian sites.\n\nOn a recent visit to Texas she brought several display cases to Wayland Baptist College in Plainview, Texas. The staff archaeologist was amazed by what she had found, as Plainview material had not been reported in southern Texas. Her archaeological knowledge of this part of Texas was impressive. She was a former member of the Rehoboth Art League and a member of the West Virginia, Volunteer State, and Texas archaeological societies, the Texas Rock Foundation, Texas Amateur Archaeological Society and the American Society for Amateur Archaeologist.\n\nShe is survived by her husband, Edward; three daughters, Lysanne Taylor, Lynne Hash and Sherrie Fisher; a son, Jimmy Lightner; and two brothers, James A. Livesay and Dale H. Livesay. She will be greatly missed by all who knew her.\n\nJames A Livesay Sr.\n\nJan 2001 Vol 48 No# 1\n\nJ.W. Berry\n\nJ. W.

We spent many pleasent hours walking the plowed fields, going to artifact shows, looking at various collections over the years, and just generally enjoying each other's company.\n\nMr. Berry was one of the most sincere and honest people we have ever had the pleasure of knowing. He touched not only our lives but the lives of many, many people that he came in contact with. We feel very blessed to have called him our friend and will hold his memory in our hearts forever. We will miss him always!\n\nDennis and Lisa Bushey\n\nJuly 1998 Vol 45 No# 3\n\nVirginia Swaim\n\nVirginia Swaim\n\nOn December 31, 1998, the heart of the Northwest Arkansas Archaeological Society stopped beating.

She and her surviving husband, Larry Swaim, have been the heart and soul of the NWAAS since they first joined in 1959.\n\nVirginia, age 80, was born in Waterloo, Iowa. She and her husband retired to Bella Vista, Arkansas. She was an active member of the 1st Presbyterian Church of Bentonville.\n\nShe served as a board member for the Shilo Museum in Springfield, Arkansas, and on the Advisory Board for the University of Arkansas Museum.\n\nThe Central States Archaeological Societies Inc. owes a debt to her, for she helped to compile the two indexes for the Central States Archaeological Journal, as well as Memoir Number 3.\n\nVirgina along with her husband, received numerous anthropological and archaeological awards and also award from museums. During the previous thirty-three years she participated in exploratory and field work from the Arkansas Archaeological survey. A lady of many talents, this treasure of our society will be sorely missed.\n\nJames F. Cherry MD.\n\nFayetteville, Arkansas\n\nJuly 1999 Vol 46 No# 3\n\nJames J. Matthews\n\nJames J. Matthews\n\nIn Memorium: James J. Matthews\n\nOn March 7, 1999, one of the truly great collectors of Indian artifacts passed away. Jim Matthews was well known and respected throughout the collecting community for his keen eye, vast knowledge and outstanding integrity.\n\nA retired high school biology teacher, Jim never quit teaching. He taught me about archaeology, botany, gardening, fossils and people every time I saw him. I am certain he did the same for practically everyone he came in contact with. I have spend untold house in his basement poring over his vast collection and listening to him tell of everything he knew about where the pieces were found and the associated materials found with them.\n\nJim spent most of his adult life hunting the Ohio River Valley in the vicinity of Louisville, Kentucky, and had a substantial collection of materials from sites that have since disappeared under urban sprawl. It was a tremendous education in the prehistory of my home town that I would never had ad the opportunity to know were it not for Jim. I would often stop as this house after a day of hunting to show him the points and other scraps of material I had found. Jim was as interested in viewing these as he was any top-notch piece. He had a rue love for all aspects of archaeology.\n\nThough I only knew him a short while, he completely changed my outlook on collecting. He instilled in me the importance and desire to document my collection and share that information with others. To say that I will miss Jim would be a tremendous understatement. I doubt that I will ever look and other artifact or walk a field when I won't at some time thing of him. I know that I am not alone in that feeling.\n\nJames C. Meuer, Louisville, Kentucky\n\nJuly 1999 Vol 46 No# 3\n\nCharles H. Long\n\nCharles H. Long\n\n1941-1988\n\nOn February 2, 1998, the artifact-hunting community lost a good friend. Loving husband and father, Charles had collected artifacts for over forty years. He was a long-time member of the C.S.A.S, through the Green River Society. Speaking for all those who knew Charlie, we were thankful for his taking the time to answer the many questions we asked. His knowledge of artifacts was immeasurable, and his stories were mesmerizing. Charlie will truly be missed.\n\nDavid Farris\n\nJuly 1998 Vol 45 No# 3\n\nJames Forrest Malone\n\nJames Forrest Malone\n\nAugust 18, 1924 - February 8, 1998\n\nOne of Tulsa's well-recognized experts in arrowhead identification, James Forrest Malone, died of complications from pneumonia. He was survived by his wife, Dora, his archaeological sidekick of fifty years; his two daughters, Maureen Brown and Sheila Tabor; and his four grandsons, Sean, Eric and Matthew Brown and Forrest Mitchell Malone.\n\nBorn in Billings, Montana, he was reared in New Mexico and Colorado, where he learned an appreciation of American Indian history and their artifacts at an age of 4 when his father carried him on his shoulders into the remote pueblo ruins in the Galesteo Basin of New Mexico. When his family moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 19t62, his education in point type identification continues through the mentorship of his friend Gregory Perino.\n\nHe was a past vice-president and member of the Tulsa Archaeological Society, the Oklahoma Anthropological Society, Keystone Crossroads Historical Society, and the Northwest Arkansas Archaeological Society.\n\nJim participated in numerous professional archaeological digs throughout Oklahoma, but his favorite site was the Leslie Vore site in Tulsa County, Oklahoma, under the direction of Dr. Gregory Odell of the Tulsa University. His kind and helpful nature and expertise will be missed. He was a credit to modern American archaeology.\n\nJanuary 1999 Vol 46 No# 1\n\nRalph Mahan\n\nRalph Mahan\n\n1912 - 2001\n\nThe Wolverine State Archaeological Society Loses a Long-Time Member, Ralph Mahan.\n\nRalph joined the W.S.A.S in 1983. He was very active in all of the functions of the Michigan society. Everyone will remember him as the guy with the box under his arm and a roll of tickets in his hand. With his booming voice, he would raffle off his special salesmen spiel that no one could resist. Single handedly, he raised more funds than anyone else over the years for the W.S.A.S. and our local chapter.\n\nRalph was always there for the children, whom he truly loved, and complimented them on their collections, encouraged them to continue their study of Michigan prehistory. He cheered the little ones on in their search for arrowheads at our club sponsored family picnics.\n\nThough not a serious artifact collector himself, he and his wife, Jean, would often hunt with our family in search of artifacts. Ralph's real interest was in the old historic Indian trails. Armed with the original 1837 survey maps, he spent countless hours in the field, locating and remapping the trails on Wexford and Grand Traverse Counties. His knowledge of them and expertise in them was phenomenal. He could show you where traces of trails could still be found today and explain the logic behind them. We recently revisited one of the scenic spots along the trail overlooking the Manistee River and fondly remembered a good friend.\n\nRalph had a life-long involvement with the Boy Scouts and earned the rank of Eagle Scout. His activities in various leadership capacities in Flint and Cadillac, Michigan, also earned him the Silver Beaver Award.\n\nRalph's survivors include his son Clark (Carol) Mahan; grandson Robert (Lori) Mahan; and grand-daughters, Alice and Rebecca Mahan\n\nGood-by, old friend. You will be missed!\n\nDon and Noreen Gustafson\n\nJanuary 2002 Vol 49 No# 1\n\nIn Memorium: Roy Hathcock\n\nOn March 25th, 2005, American archaeology lost a great friend and supporter. Roy Hathcock passed away at the age of 72 from complications following open-heart by-pass surgery.\n\nRoy was a sought out fixture at many state-sponsored artifact shows within Central States for several decades. His warm charm and pleasing wit will be sorely missed. Roy was always helpful and provided guidance to many beginning collectors. His advice and opinions were always taken seriously by friends and fellow collectors. Many professional archaeologists also appreciated Roy’s willingness to communicate and share opinions and information, thereby helping to bridge the gap between professionals and amateurs.\n\nRoy was a registered member of the Cherokee Tribe of Tahlequah. He is well known for his books on Native American pottery. His first, Ancient Indian Pottery of the Mississippi River Valley, was published in 1976. A second edition with many additional examples of Indian ceramic art was released in 1988. Roy’s second major archaeological contribution, The Quapaw and Their Pottery, was published in 1982. This book was dedicated “To the remaining Quapaw and to the preservation and recognition of their ancestral heritage.”Items from Roy’s personal collection are currently on display as a part of a traveling exhibit developed by The Art Institute of Chicago. Roy’s collection is diverse, with artifacts of interest from many part of the Central States region. Documentation of Spiro Mounds artifacts, the history of the site and interpretation of the artifacts were of special interest to him.\n\nRoy was a United States Army Veteran and served with the Missouri National Guard. He is survived by Norma, his wife of fifty-two years, and by his son, Bryce.\n\nTom Zmudka\n\nMy heart was saddened with the knowledge of Tom Zmudka's untimely death that occurred in late 2003. I had previously been aware of some quiet rumors, but nothing definite until just recently, when my suspicions were confirmed by two local people. Tom was very instrumental in organizing, implementing and following through with the northeastern Illinois Archaeological Society shows held in Utica, Illinois on a semi-annual basis for many years. Tom was a resident of Ogelsby, Illinois. He was a fast and true friend of the late Don Edwards, a collector from the Utica, Illinois region. An age difference separated the two but not their love of the local history and archaeology of the area. It is my opinion that Tom was never recognized and given the thankfulness that he deserved for all of his hard work, dedication and devotion in his putting on”the Utica show. With all due respect, I thank Tom for all he did so selflessly. It would be most appropriate for all of us to take a minute and say, THANKS, TOM! His walking on has left a void that wont be replaced.\n\nby Jake Ilko\n\nDuane Beanie Johnson\n\nDuane has collected for many years. Portions of Duane's collection are featured in Who's Who #8 and Who's Who #9.\n\nJim Dresslar\n\nJames Edward “Jim” Dresslar\n\nAug 15 1933 - Oct 22 2011\n\nJames Edward Dresslar, 78, Bargersville, IN, died Oct. 22, 2011.

His knowledge of the powder horns is beyond belief. He and his wife Carolyn had a log barn and a log cabin, from the same property, moved from Kentucky to their property in Bargersville, Indiana. They made a beautiful home out of the two. They were set apart and the center was filled in as the foyer and kitchen on the first floor. The top of the barn was their bedroom and a second bedroom, the bottom, the dining room. The cabin part became their den. There was an entire lower level with several decks. It was a very lived in house but with a primitive beauty all it's own.\n\nDr. Gordon Frederick Meuser\n\nDr. Gordon Frederick Meuser\n\nJune 29 1897 - December 6 1971\n\nWhen Gordon Frederick Meuser was born on 29 June 1897, in Massilon Township, Wayne, Illinois, United States, his father, Fred Meuser, was 32 and his mother, Anna Marie Trauner, was 25.\n\nHe married Aurelia Eliza Martin on 28 December 1922, in Crawford, Ohio, United States.
