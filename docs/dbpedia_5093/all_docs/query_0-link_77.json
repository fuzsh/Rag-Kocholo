        "text": "Gannon, Elizabeth\n\nDear Bros. Fanning & Lipscomb: - It becomes my unpleasant task to announce the death of Elizabeth Gannon, my beloved wife, who died on the 19th of December last.Â She was taken sick the first of last June, and continued to suffer severely up to the time of her death.Â She became obedient to the faith, and was immersed by our venerable Brother Trott, in the year 1845.Â Â She received the truth in the love of it--lived in all holy obedience to its precepts, and died in the triumphant hopes of immortality and eternal life.Â She has left seven children with me to mourn her loss.Â May the Lord enable us to bear these distresses with Christian fortitude.\n\nJohn P. Gannon., Cannon Co., Tenn., April 26, 1859.\n\nGospel Advocate, July 1859, page 223.\n\nGannon, John P.\n\nÂ Â Brethren L. & S.:Â Please publish through the ADVOCATE the death of my father, John P. Gannon, who died Aug. 28th, 1870.Â He was born in Guilford County, N. C., Feb. 2nd, 1813.Â Aged 57 years, 6 months, and 26 days.Â He espoused the Christian cause twenty-five years ago, and lived a zealous Christian up to the close of his earthly pilgrimage.Â I was with him during his illness, the latter part of which was most excruciating, yet he bore it with Christian patience--perfectly submissive to his Master's will.Â He leaves a wife and children to mourn his loss; yet we mourn not as those who have no hope.Â May the promises of the Gospel of Christ strengthen us to push forward and to be faithful until the end that we may enter in through the gates into the city and join the Heavenly hosts in singing praises to God and the Lamb.\n\nYours in the one hope,\n\nAlfred J. Gannon., Maxville, Tenn.\n\nGospel Advocate,Â September 22, 1870, page 882.\n\nGarner, John\n\nPermit me also to announce the death of my affectionate uncle, John Garner, who departed this life at his home in Izard County, Ark. on the 21st of August 1872, in the 64th year of his age.Â He was also a native of Warren Co. Tenn. and came out from the Baptists and untied with the disciples at Philadelph a congregation on Hickory Creek thirty-five years ago, and was a devoted member there until 1838, when he moved to this State, and notwithstanding his opportunities to meet with the brethren were not very good for some time after he settled here, his zeal and faith continued the same, and when the cause of our Master began to prosper here, he was as much delighted with the movement as any mortal could have been.Â He was ever ready to do all that was in his power to advance the cause and kingdom of Christ.Â He was the father of eight children, one of whom died in the war.Â He leaves a widow and seven children behind, who have all commenced the Christian warfare, except the youngest child.Â May the Lord help them to live so as to meet him where there will be no more sickness, sorrow, pain or death.\n\nWm. P. Garner., Franklin, Izard County, Ark. July 6th 1873\n\nGospel Advocate, July 24, 1873, page 693.Â\n\nGarner, Wm. P.\n\nBrethren L. & S: Permit me on your pages to offer a little tribute of affection to the memory of my dear Father Wm. P. Garner, who departed this life on the 15th day of September 1870, in the 52nd year of his age.Â He was a native of Warren County Tenn. where he came out from the Baptists and untied with the disciples of Christ about 35 years ago, and lived faithfully, with the congregation worshipping at Philadelphia church on Hickory Creek, until the year 1860.Â He then emigrated to this State, and finding but few of the brethren here, and they like sheep without a shepherd, he was prompted by his love for our Master's cause, to commence preaching the Gospel of Christ, in his old days, and through his labors, and the assistance of a few others, the cause of Christ was lifted up in this country.Â His zeal for the high cause he so earnestly plead for, the last eight years of his life was great, and his aspiration for heaven and his faith in Christ seemed to grow stronger, as he advanced in life.Â He and mother were the parents of twelve children, three of whom they buried in Tenn., the other nine are all living here.\n\nÂ Â Mother departed this life in full assurance of faith, in the year 1861, and father married again in 1862, to Martha Murphy, who was also a follower of the Lord, and died in the triumphs of a living faith about six weeks before father died.Â So he was a man whose days on earth were full of sorrows, but we are sure that he is gone to rest, and according to my promise to him I am trying to fill his place.Â May the Lord help me.Â He saw six out of nine of his children make a start in the Christian warfare, and when he was approaching death, he called his children and friends to his bedside and admonished those who had made the start to serve the Lord, never to turn back, for he then could realize the worth of a faith in Christ, and it was worth all of this world.Â He also pointed the unconverted to the Lamb of God.Â O! that we may all die the death of the righteous and our last end be like his.\n\nWm. P. Garner\n\nGospel Advocate, July 24, 1873, page 693.\n\nGeorge, Robert Fleming\n\nRobert Fleming George was born May 8th 1851, and died June 18th 1872.\n\nÂ Â The only son of fond and devoted parents, it was hard indeed to give him up.Â But the king of Terrors is no respecter of persons.Â The aged and the young--the infant in its mothers arms--the maiden in the flush of her beauty--the youth just entering upon a vigorous manhood, are called from time away.\n\nÂ Â Robert Fleming George will walk no more among men.Â His youthful companions will meet him no more on times side of eternity.Â He has preceded them to \"That bourne whence no traveler returns. Gifted with many noble qualities of head and heart, he had won respect and confidence of the community in which he lived, and had endeared himself to those friends who were more nearly associated with him.\n\nÂ Â God called him--he has trustingly answered that call; and with an abiding confidence, he leaned upon the strong arm of the Savior, and has crossed to the better shore.\n\nÂ Â There he rests \"Neath the shade of the trees\" waiting the coming of those left behind.\n\nÂ Â May the blessings of a kind providence, and the consolations of the glorious Gospel of Christ lead the bereaved ones of his family, and all his friends to make a suitable preparation to meet him and all the redeemed in the blissful realms of the \"paradise of God.\"\n\nJ.

Giles.Â She was the only daughter of Jacob H. Banton, Sr.Â She was born in Rutherford Co. Tenn. January 24th 1817, was married in the same County November 20th 1836, to Elder Sam'l B. Giles, with whom she came to Texas in May 1837.\n\nÂ Â Few persons have better illustrated \"pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father than she.Â In the domestic relations especially, was she noted for all that characterizes the devoted wife and mother.\n\nÂ Â Her disease was pronounced cancer of the throat.Â Her sufferings were intense, but life did not yield to them for several weeks, during which time she manifested the greatest patience, and powers of endurance.\n\nÂ Â Such a life as hers, rich with the golden fruits of the Spirit, is followed by memories, that soothe the anguish of those who weep over her loss.\n\nJ. H. Banton.\n\nGospel Advocate, December 4, 1873, page 1168.\n\nGiles, W. A.\n\nÂ Â Brethren:Â Permit me, in your paper, to offer a tribute of affection to the memory of my dear father, W. A.Giles, who departed this life on the 12th day of September 1876, in the 79th year of his age.Â He was born in Pittsylvania County, Va., and moved to Tenn., where he united with the disciples of Christ, above 40 years ago.Â He was a strong advocate of the cause of Christ, and was never heard to express a doubt, but died, as he had lived, in the full triumph of a living faith.Â He raised eleven children, all of whom have commenced the Christian warfare, four of them were asleep in Christ before him.\n\nÂ Â We miss him sadly, but grieve not as those who have no hope. We know if we prove faithful we will meet him where there is no more sickness, pain or death.\n\nMrs. R. A. Hay., Gibson, Co., Tenn. Nov. 18, 1876\n\nGospel Advocate, January 4, 1877, page 11\n\nGoss, Jas. W.\n\nÂ Â We have been pained though not surprised to hear of the death of Bro. Jas. W. Goss, at his home in Virginia.Â He was for years a most successful teacher and preacher in Virginia.Â At the close of the war he came to Kentucky and settled at Hopkinsville.Â He remained there but two years.Â He was stricken with paralyses over a year ago.Â Although hearty, cheerful, and of good constitution he never recovered.Â At the close of the session of his school in June he passed through Nashville on his way to Virginia.Â Â We felt then that he would never return West and that his days on earth were few.Â He was in many respects a remarkable man.Â His faith was positive yet simple, child-like and trusting.Â His life was the outgrowth of his faith and was pure, upright, active but blameless.Â His talent was extraordinary.Â Though modest, retiring, and even shy as a girl, he had few superiors in either matter or manner as a preacher.Â He had an inexhaustible store of social kindness, loved his friends and was in turn loved by them as seldom falls to the lot of man.Â He was full of humor, ready in repartee, was a living spring of salient wit, yet tender, gentle, and loving as a child.\n\nÂ Â Â We learned to love him before we ever saw him.Â That affection was strengthened by every meeting we had with him.Â We truly sorrow with his family and many friends in his loss, yet feel that the life of such a man is a public blessing to the world and his memory a precious treasure to his family and friends.Â He died we believe Nov. 26th.\n\nD. L.\n\nGospel Advocate, December 22, 1870, page 1182\n\nGooch, Joseph Henry\n\nIt becomes our duty to say something in regard to the life and death of another of our fellow travelers to eternity.Â We will not call it a painful duty, while the sad news of his seemingly untimely death sent a thrill of sadness and sore bereavement to the hearts of his family, the church of God, the community in which he lived, and to that in which he was raised.Â Still it is a pleasure to speak of the character he had formed, both as a member of society and the Church of God.Â Since it was the will of Him \"that doeth all things well\" to take from us one in the beginning of manhood, whose life seemed so promising, so prolific of good to his family, to the Church, and to the world.Â It is a source of pleasure, it is comforting in the hour of bereavement to know that his heart had been placed upon things above, that the hope of immortality was his.Â So far as we know, \"our loss is his gain.\"Â \"We should sorrow not as those who have no hope.\"Â Brother Joseph Henry Gooch, the oldest child of brother R. and sister Nannie Gooch, was born Nov. 7th, 1858, lived in obedience to his parents from his infancy, confessed the Savior, and was immersed by Bro. J. M. Barnes, in the waters of Carter's Creek, in October, 1873; was drowned in Duck river, July 9, 1881.Â We have known brother Joe from his childhood; have watched him in the school room, the place where the integrity of boys is generally tested, and have always found that in the severest trials he manifested the most scrupulous integrity and firmness of purpose.Â It is indeed pleasant to life up the character and example of such a noble young man to the living.Â All who knew him loved him and delighted to speak his worth.Â His bereaved widow has lost a loving, kind and dutiful husband.Â His little infant daughter has lost the protection and guardianship of a devoted father, but they have the legacy of an untarnished character, and the example of an humble servant of the Lord, the richest boon that can be left by a parent to his family.Â The father and mother have lost the association and pleasant visits of a dutiful son.Â Sisters and brothers have lost the companionship of an affectionate brother.Â The Church has lost a useful and worthy member, and the society in which he moved, a firm defender.Â Let us all profit by this lesson; we are forcibly reminded of the uncertainty of life, of the brittleness of the slender thread that supports it.Â Let us then labor to be ready when summoned to go.Â That the good Lord may be a husband to the widow, a father to the little one and the promises of our blessed Savior, be a comfort to the family, and that we may all so live that we may meet Joe in the \"Beautiful Beyond\" where the waters will not drown; where no tears will be shed, where no shrieks of grief and no wails of woe will be heard; whereÂ we can enjoy the approving smiles of God and the lamb forever, is our wish and sincere prayer.\n\nW. Anderson., Beech Grove, Maury county, Tenn.\n\nGospel Advocate, August 18, 1881, page 521\n\nGraham, Fanny E.\n\nÂ Â With an humble and loving heart I chronicle the sad news of the death of sister Fanny E. Graham, who fell asleep in Jesus near Rome, Ga., where she was visiting her friends, on the 11th inst.Â Her mother and brother (Mrs. S. L. Graham and John M. Graham) reached home with her remains on the 12th, and same were interred on the 13th.Â Sister Fanny was born August 9th 1859 hence was 20 years, 5 months and 2 days old.Â She was indeed a lovely character; as a child she was loving and obedient; as a lady she was kind, affable and gentle in her deportment; as a Christian she was zealous humble, and courteous.Â She confessed our Savior under the teaching of Bro. J. G. Hester on the 31st of April last, and was by him buried with Christ by baptism, since which time her seat has seldom, if ever, when at home, been vacant at our weekly Lord's day meeting.Â She was indeed an ornament in our congregation and in her death we have lost much, but thanks be to God our loss is her gain.Â Praying heaven's blessing on the bereaved, and: humbly admonishing all to imitate her Christian deportment, that we may be gathered with her in that sweet bye and bye.\n\nM.\n\nGospel Advocate, January 22, 1880, page 58\n\nGrant, H. G. W., Dr.\n\nÂ Â Died, at Salem, Tenn., on Friday, the 19th of March, 1869, Dr. H. G. W. Grant,Â aged 49 years 4 months and 16 days.Â The deceased was born and raised near Nashville, Tennessee.Â He was, the greater portion of his life persuaded of the truth of the Christian religion, and in the year 1866 determined to no longer allow anything to stand in the way of his obedience and was, like the ancient Phillipian jailor, baptized the same hour of the night, and lived afterward a Christian.Â In his death his family have sustained a loss which is irreparable by any one on earth.Â He was always ready to attend to their every want, and did everything which a kind, indulgent father and husband could do to render them comfortable.Â We sympathize with his aged mother, his wife, sister and brothers and children in their affliction, and trust that they may find a friend and comforter in our Heavenly Father, who is a husband to the widow, and a Father to the fatherless.Â He it is who has said \"I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.\"Â Trust in Him.Â Our brother was, for upwards of twenty-five years a successful practitioner in medicine.Â He could be seen during the silent watches of the night by the bedside of the poor, ministering to the wants of the suffering and dying--and no doubt he hastened his death by exposure in visiting the sick.Â But medical aid with which he had so often benefited others failed to relieve him; he had every attention which a fond family and friends could render, but all to no avail.\n\nÂ Â During his illness, which was long and painful, he was patient and calm, telling his children not to grieve for him but to trust in the Lord.Â In his last moments he was resigned and perfectly rational, and fell gently asleep.\n\nG. L.\n\nGospel Advocate, April 22, 1869, page 380\n\nGreen, James R.\n\nBros. Fanning & Lipscomb: - Our beloved brother, James R. Green, died on the 16th ofÂ February, 1859.Â He was born September the 8th, 1816, and united with the Church of God, worshipping at Bethel, on the fourth Lord's day in Sept., 1848, by confessing the name of Jesus before men, and immersion for the remission of his sins.Â He took upon himself the yoke of Christ, which he bore in meekness till he laid it down in death, with the sure hope of entering into a glorious immortality with the redeemed in heaven.Â \"Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth; yea, saith the spirit, that they may rest from their labors, and their works do follow them.\"\n\nÂ Â Bro. Green was noted for his integrity, and uprightness in every department of life which drew around him a large circle of friends, who, with his bereaved wife and six little children will ever fondly cherish his memory.Â We write this by request of his aged father, a pioneer of the State, and the reformation, who devoted his talents and much of his time, through the prime of life, to the proclamation of the gospel.\n\nT. Goodall., Wilson Co., Tenn.\n\nGospel Advocate, August 1859, page 256.\n\nGriffin, Julia A.\n\nÂ Â SisterJulia A. Griffin departed this life on the 23rd of March 1872 near Huntsville Spaulding Co. Ga.Â She was born August 28th 1831 near Madison, Morgan county Georgia.\n\nÂ Â Sister Griffin united with the church of Christ at Berea in Henry County Ga. August 19th 1863, and up to the time of her death lived to honor her Christian profession.Â She has left a disconsolate husband and eight children to mourn her loss which is truly great.Â In all the various relations of life she sustained herself with such propriety that she was beloved by all who knew her, she had lived the life of the righteous and left the world with the glorious hope of immortality.Â May her husband and dear children be consoled by the reflection that in heaven she has a better and more enduring substance which this world cannot give.Â Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord.\n\nW. S. Fears., May 28th, 1872\n\nGospel Advocate, June 13, 1872, page 580\n\nGrigg, Mary H.\n\nÂ Â It becomes my sad duty to record the death of my dear mother, Mary H. Grigg wife of J. A. Grigg whose obituary was announced in the ADVOCATE last year.Â Mary H. Grigg was born in Pittsylvania county, Va., July 30th, 1806, and bade farewell to earth with all of its cares and toils Oct. 11th 1880 near Leeville, Wilson county, Tenn.Â She was confined but a short time, yet her suffering was severe.Â She bore it with great fortitude, and was perfectly willing to go and enter the rest prepared for the weary.Â Truly the church has lost one of its brightest examples of faith, piety and true devotion to Christ.Â She was a kind and affectionate mother and leaves a great many children and relatives to mourn her loss.Â She lived to see all of her children enter the church, and all of her grandchildren who were old enough to know their duty to God.Â Then, dear brothers sisters let us feel that our loss is her gain.Â She has gone to the home of the faithful to join the angelic band to sing the songs of the redeemed in glory.Â Yes, she will be with the Savior in endless days to learn of his glorious works and ways, and when our race is run we will meet mother and father above.Â Then we shall stand and sing with them:\n\nIn the city of God, Jerusalem.\n\nSo farewell dear parents till the resurrection morn, when all the people\n\nof God will gathered home forever more.\n\nJ. P. Grigg., Millersburg, Tenn.\n\nGospel Advocate, January 20, 1881, page 42.\n\nGrigg, Mollie J.\n\nBrethren L. & S:Â It becomes my painful duty to record the death of my dear wife, Mollie J. Grigg daughter of N. A. and Susan McElroy.Â She departed this life on Friday Sept. 12th 1873, after a confinement of about six months.Â I saw her suffer more than I thought it possible for any human to bear.Â I saw her waste away until she became a living skeleton.Â Though her sufferings were great she bore them with all fortitude, and said that she was prepared to die.Â She was a kind and devoted wife, and read her Bible until her eyes became so weak that she could not see the letters, she admonished her friends to read the Bible and prepare to follow her.Â But she is done with the toils and sufferings of earth.Â Dark indeed would be the grave, were it not that Jesus has been there, and taken away its gloom.Â Farewell dear wife, till the resurrection morn when all the people of God will be happy forevermore.\n\nJ. P. Grigg., Murfreesboro Tenn. Sept. 20th 1873.\n\nGospel Advocate, October 9, 1873, page 980.\n\nGupton, Henry Clay\n\nÂ Â With what a sad heart it is that I attempt to communicate to you--the readers of the ADVOCATE, the death of my most beloved companion, Mr. Henry Clay Gupton.Â He had attained and nearly completed his 36th year.Â He had for more than 11 years been an humble and devoted follower of Jesus.Â When fully convinced that it was his duty, he delayed not to obey the gospel, and unite himself with the disciples of the Lord.Â He was first married to Miss Martha L. Bunnel.Â Having fought a good fight and finished his course, and kept the faith, he fell asleep in Jesus April 8th 1881.Â That heavenly happiness, that sweet flowing peace and that blissful light which pervades every home, blessed with one so pure and Christ-like, has gone out from mine, and the anguish of my heart is unspeakably great.Â The Christian graces were truly exemplified in his unostentatious life, and by his pious walk many were instructed.\n\nMary A. Gupton., Monroe, Hart County, Ky.\n\nGospel Advocate, July 14, 1881, page 438\n\nGrimes, W. R.\n\nDied at his mother's in Hickman Co. in January, of Small Pox, Bro. W. R. Grimes.Â We do not know bro. Grimes' age, but he was a young man.Â In his death the church of Christ has lost an exemplary member, the community a valuable citizen, and the Masonic Fraternity, a worthy brother.\n\nÂ Â He obeyed the Gospel under my preaching at Dunlap meeting house, 1871--and from that time his walk was that of a Christian.Â He was highly esteemed and beloved by all who knew him well.Â He was affectionate and kind to his widowed mother--as well as to his brothers and sisters--whom he has left to mourn his untimely loss.\n\nÂ Â We are glad to say that we learn, notwithstanding most persons dread the disease which caused his death, his relatives and friends did not desert him--but trusting in God, gave that attention he needed, and by their kind ministrations, smoothed his way to the tomb.Â He died trusting in Jesus, and in hope of a glorious immortality.Â May his aged mother his brothers, sisters and other dear friends take comfort in the hope of meeting him again to dwell together forever.\n\nF. H. Davis.\n\nGospel Advocate, March 27, 1873, page 308.\n\nGarrett, E. A.\n\nDeath has again laid low a noble specimen of manhood, Bro. E. A. Garrett of the Cross Roads congregation in this county, (Lowndes) died of yellow chills or biliousÂ haematuria in about, the fortieth year of his age.Â His mother \"Aunt Polly Garrett,\" went before him on the 20th of February last, His father, the good and noble Silas Garrett only a few years ago.Â Bro. E. A. Garrett was one of the few men against whom I never heard a word spoken.Â He was indeed of good report among all those who were his religious enemies.Â He leaves a young wife and a little boy to mourn, yes to mourn that he is gone, but how different their mourning from what it would have been, if he had not been the humble, and zealous Christian, that he was.Â His wife is a Christian too, and as they were of one mind and done body while here together, so when she shall follow, they will together join their voices in songs of perfect praise to him who died that they might live.Â May God bless them, and may his going hence increase and intensify the desire of all who loved him true, to go where he has gone.\n\nA.

W. Gillenwaters, daughter of M. N. and M. C. Alexander.Â She was born in Lafayette, Macon Co., Tenn., January 23, 1849; was married to R. R. W. Gillenwaters on April 13, 1869, and died in Edgefield, Davidson county, Tenn., June 14, 1878, aged twenty-nine years, four months and twenty-four days.Â She with her husband united with the Christian church at Lafayette the same year they were married, and she remained a devoted Christian up to the time of her death.Â I have known her since 1873; her conversation was ever that of a Godly woman, her walk that of a pious person.Â She leaves a husband and little daughter, a father, mother and brother, with many friends to mourn her loss.Â She suffered with disease for about a year.Â She talked often of her approaching dissolution with great firmness and resolution.Â A short time before her death she told her husband that she was going to die, but she had no fears--she was trusting in the promises of a risen Savior.Â She requested him to educate their little daughter Maggie, and to train her up to be a Christian, and for him to hold on to his Christian faith, and never to use intoxicating drinks.Â May God help him to carry out her wishes.\n\nW.

Golden on the 1st day of December 1870, and died at the residence of her father near Fulton, Ky., July 25th 1878, aged 23 years and 4 days.Â Sister Delia, as she was familiarly known, obeyed the Lord in her 13th year and from that time up to the time of her death she lived a devoted Christian.Â She leaves a husband and two little boys, a father, mother, four brothers, and two sisters besides many relations and friends to mourn her loss.Â She died in the triumphs of a living faith.Â I have known her from her childhood and can truly say that she was kind, gentle, loving, lovely, and beloved.Â I have it from the lips of her parents that she never in all her life spoke a cross or unkind word to them.Â Just before she died she said to those around her, \"I am dying, I am going to heaven.\"Â An hour or so later she called the family to her one by one and bade them an affectionate farewell exhorting them to meet her in heaven.Â She earnestly entreated her husband to prepare to meet her in heaven.Â May the Lord help him to heed her entreaty.Â Â Sister Delia was a member of Boaz Chapel congregation at the time of her death.Â The church sustained a great loss but our loss is her eternal gain.Â\n\nT.

Gooch, of Rutherford County, Tenn.Â He obeyed the gospel and became a Christian in his 19th year, and lived to be 26 years old.Â He was educated chiefly at Burritt College, Tenn., and for awhile followed school teaching in Tennessee, and read law at McMinnville, Tenn., and went to Texas in 1883, where he taught school most of his time till July 1889, when he formed a law partnership, with fair prospects, when just as he felt that he was settled in a business for future life, death came and called him hence.Â He was an earnest and conscientious Christian, ready to sacrifice anything he thought needful for the sake of the cause of truth.Â It seem sad that one in the activities of a useful life should be cut down so soon; but on the other hand, a great consolation comes from the precious promise, \"Blessed are the dead who die in Lord from henceforth; Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors and their works do follow them.\"Â Â\n\nTaken from a Texas paper.\n\nGospel Advocate, December 25, 1889, page 830.\n\nGoodloe, Henry\n\nIt becomes my painful duty to record the death of another Elder in Israel, our beloved brother Henry Goodloe, of Rutherford county, Tennessee.Â He died of cancer of the stomach, and of course lingered long and suffered much.Â Bro. Goodloe was born June 12th, 1812, was married to Miss M. H. Barton Dec. 25th, 1834, obeyed the gospel in the year 1835, and died Nov. 13th, 1877, aged sixty-five years and four months, having lived a Christian for over forty years.Â As a citizen his council was sought and his advice received with a deference on all questions of importance or interest.Â As a neighbor he was kind and obliging, ever ready to accommodate and assist his neighbors.Â As a husband and father he was kind and affectionate.Â To him there was \"no place like home;\" no earthly associations like those of his own household.Â He earnestly prayed that his life might be spared, that he might raise his children, which prayer was answered. He lived to see all of his children grown and all but one members of the body of Christ.Â (We humbly pray that this one may be spared until he also may see the importance of preparing for another world.)Â It was as a Christian that the character of Bro. Goodloe shone the brightest.Â When I say he loved his house, children and the institutions of the Lord, I but feebly express it.Â He delighted in them.Â He entered the kingdom early in life, and after he had spent his strength in his Master's service he said to the writer just before his death: \"I have never regretted entering the vineyard of the Lord as early as I did; neither have I ever felt a doubt on the subject of my acceptance with him.\"Â He seemed to be and expressed himself perfectly resigned to the will of the Lord.Â He spoke frequently to his family and friends in the most encouraging manner.Â He was constant in his attendance at the house of the Lord as long as he was able to get there, and after he became too weak to attend he had his brethren to meet with him at his own house, to read, sing, pray, and break the loaf in memory of the Lord and Savior.Â He exhorted, admonished and encouraged his brethren and family until the very day of his death.Â And though his suffering was intense, he was never heard to murmur, but said the Lord knows what is best for me, his will be done.Â As a Christian, a husband, father and neighbor his loss is severely felt.Â But strengthened by his example let us live as he lived and die as he died, then we will live together with him in that blessed home prepared for the righteous.\n\nL.

The deceased was born in Rutherford county, Tenn., and at an early age his parents moved to Gibson county, where he was principally raised and educated; his principal education was obtained at Bluff Spring Academy in said county.Â He embraced Christianity at quite an early age being raised by exceedingly religious parents, he lived a consistent, Christian life, wielding more influence for good with less effort than any man of his age I ever saw.Â He was beloved by all who knew him.Â During the rebellion he made a brave and faithful soldier, notwithstanding his Christian principles, which forbid the idea of war, under the circumstances, he was forced into the army; and as his wont, he was faithful in everything he undertook.Â He was a consistent and faithful member of the Masonic Order, which served him beneficially in a dilemma during the war, at the close of which he commenced the business of teaching, in which he was very successful for several years, during which time he married a very excellent lady who still survives him with four small children.Â From the want of proper exercise for his health he abandoned the school room for the farm for a few years, but thinking he could better serve and benefit his species, he moved to this place and took up school again, where he gave universal satisfaction until his death which was deeply regretted by all.\n\nAlamo, Crockett County, Tenn.\n\nGospel Advocate, January 10, 1878, page 23.\n\nGowin, John\n\nMy dearly beloved husband was born September 20, 1866, we were married September 20, 1887, and I feel assured fell composedly asleep in Jesus on the early morning September 8, 1888, being twenty-one years, eleven months, and twelve days of age.Â John experienced a hope in Christ and was baptized into the fellowship of the Christian church at Mars Hill, Rutherford Co.

Jones and Trott.Â During her illness of long continuance, she manifested great fortitude, patience and wonderful resignation.Â She lived to raise a small but useful family, some of them however have preceded her to the better land; all that remain are faithful members of the church of Christ.Â Sister Green was a great lover of the Bible, it was her daily companion, she drew rich lessons from it and taught it to those around her.Â Sister Green will be long remembered by the old pioneer preachers.Â She was always ready and willing to administer to the wants of the poor.Â She leaves a large circle of friends and relations to mourn her departure. But none will miss her like her aged companion. Cheer up then, fight on, the battle will soon be over, and we all will soon meet in that beautiful beyond where weeping and parting will be no more, forever to be with the Lord and our loved ones who are watching and waiting for us.Â\n\nP.

F. George on May 8, 1834, and with him she lived till a few years ago, when he preceded her in death.Â To them were born five children--three sons and two daughters.Â The two daughters only survive her.Â For fifty years she was a member of the body of Christ.Â Death did not take her by surprise.Â For months before the great change came she was the gradual, but certain, approach of the hour when she would leave this world, and talked about the tasks she was hastening to finish on earth before her crossing.Â Malignant tumors were the cause of her death.Â With these she suffered about six months, gradually growing worse.Â From 1891 she was a member of the church at Normandy.Â The writer of these lines made a talk to the sorrowing relatives and friends at the home of Mrs. Cortner.Â Sister George was always bright, cheerful, happy, fond of conversation, kind to all who came about her.Â Her life was long--from February 23, 1817, to June 30, 1899--and lovely.Â She will be missed in the church, in the neighborhood, and especially in the home.Â May the promises of the Savior comfort all the bereaved and sorrowing ones.\n\nW.

Graham, who survives her at the advanced age of eighty-eight years.Â How lonely he must be without her with whom he lived so happily for more than sixty-eight years!Â She was the mother of thirteen children.Â Four of these died in infancy.Â Two sons and seven daughters lived to be grown and married.Â One of these sons and six daughters survive her.Â The other son, James L., a promising minister of the gospel, died in November, 1875, aged twenty-six years.Â In May, 1835, Sister Graham was baptized by Elder Laven Merritt and always remained a consistent member of the Grapevine congregation, which was organized in September, 1830.Â Her long life of usefulness is ended: she has gone to her reward.Â To-night the fire burns brightly in the old fireplace; from its clean-swept hearthstone the mother has gone, never to return; the aged father sits bowed down with sorrow.Â The separation will not be long.Â Tomorrow's sun will shine through the windowpanes and across the armchair, but the mother is gone.Â To the surviving ones, and especially to the aged father in Israel, we extend our warmest Christian sympathies.Â \"Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord.\"\n\nStrother M.

She was the daughter of Hugh Roberts, and was raised and educated at Celina, Tenn., and at the age of fifteen (if I mistake not) was united in marriage to William Gearheart, with whom she lived until 1861 or 2.Â Brother Gearheart died and left her a widow with eight children.Â Three of them passed over the river before she did.Â Five of them still linger on the shores of time.Â She lived to see all her children baptized.Â She has one son who is a preacher of no small ability.Â She was a woman of strong convictions, and would contend earnestly for what she thought to be right; was charitable and kind to the poor.Â She was a kind and affectionate wife, a tender and good mother, a kind neighbor, and her house was the preacher's home.\n\nJ.

J. E. Scobey at Murfreesboro, Tenn., as a pupil, and in 1872 became a teacher in that institution, continuing in that capacity two or three years.Â From there she returned to Montgomery, Ala., and in 1876 to her childhood's home in Ellis county, Tex, where she remained following teaching, as her health would allow, until her death.\n\nÂ Â It was my good fortune to know her as a child and woman, and few have been able to fill all the relations of life in which they are placed, with a greater degree of success.Â Perfect as a child, and a model in her womanhood, she drew around her a host of friends who sincerely mourn her loss.\n\nÂ Â Her Christian deportment filled the highest standard among us, and she is missed from the church where her membership was held so long, and her presence so often felt.Â Consumption came with its insidious march, and found her ready.Â The valley and shadow of death had no terrors for her, but she welcomed its approach as a relief from suffering, and an entrance into the Christian's rest.Â She recognized and spoke to her friends, even after the hand of death was upon her.Â In full possession of her faculties, she fell asleep in Jesus.\n\nÂ Â Three neighboring schools were dismissed to attend her funeral, together with the many friends who came to assist in the last sad offices for the dead, paid a higher tribute to her memory and worth than tongue or pen could do.Â In the family burying ground, beside mother and brother, she awaits the call that shall awake the dead.\n\nG.

Sister Pollie was an earnest Christian and a zealous worker in the church of Christ of which she was a member for twenty-five years.Â We do not wish her back again, for we know where she is there is no sorrow, pain or weeping, and of all these she had her share.Â But oh! we miss her; we miss the constant care, the loving presence.Â There is no wife to console the lonely husband that was always so kind.Â There is no mother here now to counsel the little son, no mother to care for the little daughters, there is no care now for the daughter who cared for her so long and lovingly, and so we all miss her, but we know though she cannot come to us we can go to her and that she will be waiting at the beautiful gate.\n\nA Sister.\n\nGospel Advocate, September 10, 1890, page 587.\n\nGalloway, Susan\n\nÂ Â Sister Susan Galloway was born on November 14, 1817, and died at the home of her son, near Carter's Creek, Tenn., on May 28, 1900; aged eighty-two years, six months and fourteen days.Â In 1837 she was married to Matthew J.

Gooch, in 1875, and died at her home, in Hanson, Ky., October 31, 1899--on the fifty-second anniversary of her birth.Â She obeyed the gospel in October, 1872, and lived a devoted Christian life to the end--no, not to the end; to the beginning--the beginning of the true life on the other side of the river.Â Sister Gooch was one of the best of women.Â This is not mere eulogy, but the statement of a fact well known to all who knew her.Â When the sad news that she was dead was spoken on the streets everyone said, \"She was a good woman\"--the grandest just compliment that was ever paid to anybody.Â One man who had lived a neighbor to her, and who belongs to another church, said of her: \"She was one of the best women I ever saw.\"Â No tramp called in vain at her kitchen door; no sickness in the cabin homes of her acquaintances but she went to see and assist; no death but she was there to console and see to things.Â I have been her minister three years, and two years of that time I have lived next door to her; yet I never heard her speak an unkind word about anybody or anything.Â But she has gone from us for a season.Â Everything that human skill and love could do for her was done, but all to no purpose; as the twilight shades were fading into the deeper shadows of evening she left us.Â She leaves a loving husband and four noble children--two daughters and two sons--besides all who knew her, to mourn her death.Â All the loved ones left behind--save little Hardy, who is scarcely old enough yet--are Christians, fighting the only battle that death does not gain.Â We can only say to them: Be faithful, and it will not be long until you meet her again at the great reunion in the Father's house.\n\nW.

Williams some time in July, 1896.Â Brother Abe was one of the most zealous, consecrated Christians I ever knew.Â He loved his Bible and was always ready to give a reason for the hope that was in him \"with meekness and fear;\" he loved theÂ Gospel AdvocateÂ and has been one of its constant readers for several years.Â Brother Green was a good citizen, an obliging neighbor, an obedient son, and a kind and loving brother.Â Truly, he was an \"unpolished jewel.\"Â He was unpretentious, and did not show up for his real worth; but the more he was rubbed, the brighter he shone.Â Those who were most intimately associated with him felt most the influence of his Christian character.Â He leaves a father, two brothers, and two sisters to mourn their loss.Â His father and his two sisters are loyal members of the one body, the church of Christ.Â To the sorrowing ones I would say: Let us try to imitate his Christian life, so that when we are called to quit the walks of life we may be prepared to meet him in that beautiful home that our Savior has gone to prepare.Â May God bless the loved ones, is the prayer of one who loved him.\n\nLouis E.

J.\n\nÂ Â On May 6, 1901, after a night of great agony, and just as the sun was lifting himself above the eastern horizon, Sister A. J. Gann passed from time to eternity, having lived seventy-six years.Â She was formerly a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church, but some fifteen or twenty years ago she learned the way of the Lord more perfectly under the earnest preaching of Brother Harry Hamilton, and was baptized into the one body by the beloved Benny Spears, remaining a faithful member until death.Â Since the death of Brother N. W. Gann, some five or six years ago, she has appeared sad and lonely, like a dove that has lost its mate, although she had a good home with her daughter, Sister A. R. Tiller, who did what she could to make her pleasant and happy.Â She leaves a number of children and a host of friends to mourn their loss; yet we believe she was perfectly willing to go and anxious to meet her husband she loved so much in the paradise of God.Â I desire to say to those who weep for her here: Dry your tears and earnestly follow Christ; he will soon lead us across the dark river into the city of God, where we shall meet to part no more.\n\nT.

Gannon, who departed this life on December 9, 1900, in the fifty-ninth year of his age.Â Brother Gannon was born and reared in Cannon County, Tenn., and came to Arkansas in 1872.Â In 1876 he was married to Miss Maggie Palmer, who, with their five children--two daughters, who have reached womanhood, and three sons, aged fourteen years, twelve years, and ten years, respectively--survive him.Â Brother Gannon united with the church of Christ at the early age of eighteen years, and was a constant Bible reader, and to those who knew him well a record of his virtues is unnecessary. Â He has fought the good fight and won at last.Â May God comfort the grief-stricken widow and fatherless children.Â It was Brother Gannon's wish to live and train his children in the paths of righteousness, but God knows best.\n\nA Friend.\n\nGospel Advocate, January 24, 1901, page 62.\n\nGardener, Sarah\n\nÂ Â Died, on the morning of the 26th of February, Sister Sarah, wife of Bro.

Garrett of Mt. Willing, Ala. has reached us. The church, a large family of relations and many friends join in the number of mourners.Â Sister Garrett made no show of piety.Â Her religion was not of a character that it required an effort to make it manifest.Â She was ever the same.Â Her worth was known at home and among her neighbors.Â Oh what a chasm the mother--the true mother leaves when she departs from the fireside of the home!Â No one for the dear little ones to run to, with all the many thousand complaints.Â No one to listen with a mother's patience to the trials of childhood's life.Â Oh the little ones! the little ones! the motherless little Willie, Davis, Fannie, sister and the infant that will never know what it is to have a mother.Â Often will they call from the restlessness of midnight hours for mama, mama, to come and soothe the bed or speak a word to drive away the bad dream, but the ears that were wont to be so attentive to catch every sigh, moan or groan are now listless in death, the eyes that waked at the faintest call, and watched to see what troubled the darling are now closed to earthly things; the hands that were so ready to minister to every want and the heart that moved them are still, oh how still!Â William, walk through those large halls of yours uncomforted.Â Poor fellow, I thank God I can weep for you.Â I will not say you have lost a jewel, a diamond, that does not express it.Â Death has robbed you of a wife.Â I know no other word in the English or any other language that can convey the idea.Â Are you not thankful my dear brother that you have a lively hope that paves its way through the dark future, so that you weep not as those who have no hope.Â 'Tis faith that under props this expectation, and brings the Judgment day before you with your unbroken family marching to take a position on the right hand of the throne of judgment.Â But your children must be prepared for the heavenly home.Â Then dry up your tears as soon as your heart has overflowed with grief long enough.Â There is a great work for you.Â Yes you must be mother and father too.Â Point the little ones to Jesus their great friend, kiss them often, for they have no mother to press lips of love to tender lips.Â\n\nWhat do they say? In language too solemn to be misunderstood they say, \"Our winter will come by and by, let us prepare.\"\n\nJ. M.

O how sad the word \"gone\" when it means never to return! Husband, wife, and dear children, bound by the strongest ties of tender affection, dwelt together in the sweet comforts of life.Â It was my fortune to know her for five years, and many times have I enjoyed the pleasure of her hospitable home.Â For years she has been a sufferer, but the immediate cause of her death was pneumonia.Â A kind husband, two sons, four daughters, and a host of friends are left to mourn their loss.Â But sorrow not as those who have no hope.Â We trust that our loss is her eternal gain.\n\nA.

German, of Whitewright, Texas, was accidentally killed in his father's cotton gin.Â In order to relieve his father, Frank had taken charge of the ginning department at the first of the season, and all went well until the accident occurred that cost him his life.Â Frank was a noble, Christian boy; considering his age---he was twenty years old--he was in many respects a model.Â At home, in school, and in the church his Christian virtues were seen to best advantage.Â He was a graduate of Grayson College, and was contemplating entering the Nashville Bible School this winter for a two-years' course.Â Those who knew him best believe he has entered God's university, from which there is no graduation.Â It is a source of comfort and consolation to the grief-stricken father and mother to know that Frank always loved home and the church, and in this respect he was an example for many young men who grow too large for home and too wise for the church.Â The home and the church are the best places on earth to learn those lessons that adorn character and beautify the soul.Â From a family of eleven children,\n\nnearly all of whom are grown, Frank was the first to take his departure.Â When his father asked him as to his hope regarding the future life he said that he had no fears.Â The promises of the savior were his comfort in death. His young life was an open book, and will be read by many loving friends.Â The funeral services were held in the church of Christ at Whitewright.Â By their presence several hundred persons showed their appreciation of a noble life and their sympathy for the sorrowing family.Â The writer, as best he could on the occasion, spoke words of comfort to the loved ones left to mourn the sad parting, which in God's providence may not be for long.Â One by one we are going home.\n\nF.

Gilliam, whose membership was then with the Antioch congregation, determined that this little band of disciples should have a house in which to worship.Â Within five months' time a neat and comfortable house is erected.Â It stands a living monument to-day of the Christian liberality of our deceased brother.Â Bro. Gilliam was not merely a good man in the common acceptation of that term.Â He was emphatically a pure man, a high-toned Christian gentleman.Â His influence in life and death was good.Â He has left a sorrow-stricken wife and several children, a large circle of friends and relations to mourn his loss.Â To the church just in its infancy his loss is a heavy affliction.Â May the Lord preserve them to everlasting life is my prayer.\n\nGospel Advocate, February 11, 1875, page 163.\n\nGlover, J.

He leaves eight children and a wife to mourn his death. He was kind and affectionate to all, and his whole life was that of uprightness.Â Our loss will be his eternal gain.Â The Lord does all things well.Â Let us bow with humble submission to his will.Â We want every reader of theÂ Gospel AdvocateÂ to pray that his dear children will become Christians and be ready to meet him at the pearly gates.Â Pray that they may all live as he has lived.Â He lived near Trimble, Tenn.\n\nGospel Advocate, June 13, 1901, page 382.\n\nGlover, W.

J. Glover. Sleep on, dear brother, for it will not be long till we can be with thee, to eat and drink together in our Father's kingdom.Â Brother Glover was born on August 28, 1854.Â He obeyed the gospel, under the preaching of Brother Lee, in 1885, from which time he has ever lived a consistent member of the body of Christ; he was never disposed to waver or falter.Â It was seldom that anything came up to keep him from being at the Lord's house on Lord's day.Â His seat there will long be remembered by the writer, for he had learned to love him as a brother, and we never met each other but that we had something to say about the word of God; we often met and talked together on that theme.Â To know Brother Glover was to love him, for all who knew him loved him.Â He always seemed to have a kind word for everybody, both old and young.Â He was an affectionate and loving husband, and was a dutiful father to his five children, all of whom, together with his many friends, are left to mourn their loss.\n\nM.

G. Gooch.Â Her husband preceded her to the grave twenty-five years or more, her son eight or ten.Â During the last several years of life, she was afflicted by loss of sight.Â She was respected and esteemed for her solid worth by all who knew her, and although of a ripe old age her death is regretted by a large number of friends.\n\nD.

B. Hall and Charlotte Hall well-known in Rutherford county, and it will interest her many friends in that section to know something of the last days of this beloved saint.Â Her disease was one of a most painful character from which she suffered greatly being confined to her bed for eight months preceding her death; yet during all this time of acute suffering--undergoing two painful surgical operations in the meantime--a murmur of complaint or impatience never escaped her lips.Â Indeed when her dear children and loving friends as they witnessed her intense and hopeless agony, would utterly break down, she would rally and give them some loving and Christian admonition, assuring them that rest and freedom from suffering was just ahead.Â At a very early age she was immersed into Christ whom she served all her life with unswerving fidelity.Â Every day of her long life was wholly directed to God and his holy religion.Â She made everything subservient to it.Â A woman of fine intellect, her mind was a magazine well filled of all God has said to man, and from her quiet fireside to all she came in contact, she was a forcible, earnest and eloquent teacher of Christianity.Â She was really and truly a mother in Israel.Â Her house the preachers' home whom she refreshed with her hospitality and encouraged by her Christian wisdom.Â She was ever ready to strengthen the weak, encourage the strong and comfort the afflicted.Â Farewell sainted mother, loving friend and generous neighbor, thou hast passed away, but we have left the blessed memory of thy pure life, and spotless character.Â May those who loved you most fondly day by day emulate it.Â \"Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord from this time.Â Yes says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors and their works do follow them.\"\n\nA.

Grant, of West Nashville, Tenn., Brother Charles Morgan Grant died in the Lord, having almost reached the age of seventy-five years.Â His wife, a son, and a daughter preceded him to the other shore some years ago, Brother J. W. Grant being the only child left.Â On August 24 the remains of Brother Grant were carried back to the old family burying ground, in Montgomery County, near Guthrie, Ky., and there, in his old Tennessee home, he was laid to rest beside the loved ones gone before.Â At the grave the writer made a short talk to quite a concourse of his old friends and neighbors who, by their tears of sympathy and words of love, showed that he was held in high esteem.Â \"He was a good man;\" \"He was loved by all;\" \"He was kind and gentle to all;\" \"He never did any one a wrong;\" \"He was always ready to help,\" etc--these are some of the utterances that I heard as his friends took their last look at the grave.Â Two years ago, on account of age and infirmity, Brother Grant went to live with his son, who, with his faithful, devoted Christian wife, earnestly and devotedly ministered to his earthly needs until needs were past; age, with its infirmities, had left him upon his bed to gradually wear away.Â I visited him frequently in his last days, and can truly say\n\nof Brother and Sister Willie Grant that they did what they could for the comfort of their aged father.Â Though they miss him, yet they feel consolation in the exceeding great and precious promises of the blessed One who said: \"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\"Â \"The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness.\"Â While I commend their fidelity to the world, I commend them to God and to the word of his grace.Â \"Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.\"\n\nR.

Thus closes the life of a pure Christian in the prime of womanhood.Â We extend to the bereaved family our deep sympathy in this sore trial, and pray they have sufficient grace in this time of need.Â Let us sorrow not as those who have no hope, \"for she is not lost but gone before.\"Â The funeral sermon was preached by the writer, in the M.

Tracy, who baptized him, also conducted his funeral services.Â O how sad to part with loved ones!Â Would to God that every young man would follow in Brother Griffith's footsteps!Â He was kind and obedient in his sickness.Â His physician was with him eight days and Asa would implore him to do something else for him.Â O how young he was to go!Â But God knows best, and God in his wisdom saw best to take him home--that home about which Asa talked so much, where he could rest.Â His loved ones did for him everything in their power, yet it was all in vain; so let us bow in humble submission to God's will.Â Brother Griffith was a bright, intelligent young man.Â As a son he was devoted to his parents; and as a brother, was kind and affectionate toward his brothers and sisters.Â He leaves two sisters, who tenderly cared for him; and four brothers, who faithfully watched over him in his sickness.Â Let us all so live that we may meet him in heaven.\n\nNettie Boles.\n\nGospel Advocate, September 12, 1901, page 591.\n\nGrigg, Jesse A.\n\nÂ Â It has become my sad duty to record on your pages the death of my father, Jesse A. Grigg.Â He was born in Virginia, Aug. 19th, 1806, and died December 26th, 1879 at his residence near this place.Â He had been afflicted for about fifteen months with a tumor on the neck which grew to an enormous size and which appeared to baffle all the skill of physicians.Â My father united with the Baptists in Virginia, when quite young and continued an orderly member till about 1845.Â At that time he heard and believed the preaching of the brethren and became one of the founders of the Mt. View congregation.Â For a long time he held the office of the Justice of the Peace, and it is but sheer justice to say, that seldom have the decisions of a magistrate been better received.Â He also taught a good many schools.Â He was a kind and obliging neighbor, a kind father and husband, and as a Christian, it has never been my lot to know a man of more implicit faith in the Bible, in which book he was well posted.Â He was, I think, beloved and respected by all true followers of Christ.Â His sons, grandsons and great-grandsons number twenty-five and it may be truthfully said that in the course of more than fifty years, I have never known one of them to be drunk, to swear profanely, or to be guilty of riotous behavior, and of those who have reached years of accountability, all are members of the body of Christ save two, (one of whom is about sixteen), and both of whom would now likely be so, had it not been for circumstances in which they had no part.Â He bore his afflictions with becoming fortitude and quietly fell asleep in Christ.Â My mother adds these lines:\n\nHe died in Jesus and is blest,\n\nÂ Â How sweet his slumbers are!\n\nFrom sickness and from pain released,\n\nÂ Â And free from every care.\n\nE. T. Grigg., Leeville, Wilson County, Tenn.\n\nGospel Advocate, March 11, 1880, page 171.\n\nGrigg, Susan E.\n\nÂ Â By request it is my painful duty to announce the death of our beloved sister Susan E. Grigg which occurred at her residence in this County on the 5th of October 1874 in the forty-third year of her age.Â She was the widow of our beloved Brother W. L. Grigg who died about the close of the war.Â She lived a member of the Presbyterian Church for several years.Â But in 1853 heard the Gospel preached by bro. S. E. Jones, understood it and obeyed it and united with the Christian Church at Mountview--since which time she lived an orderly and pious member until her death.Â She died of that lingering and painful disease consumption which she bore with Christian fortitude for several months without a murmur.Â She leaves her two daughters the oldest of which was baptized by brother G. Lipscomb a few months since with many relatives and friends to mourn their loss.\n\nÂ Â Peaceful be thy rest dear sister till the last trump shall call us all to the judgment seat of Christ where we hope to meet you in that blissful abode where pain and sorrow can never reach us more, is the prayer of your affectionate sister in Christ.\n\nMartha S. Grigg., Mountview, Wilson Co. Oct. 31st 1874.\n\nGospel Advocate, January 8, 1875, page 46.\n\nGuin, Lura\n\nÂ Â On the evening of February 18, 1901, the death angel visited the home of Mr. Billy Gilliam and claimed for its victim Sister Lura Guin, youngest daughter of Mr. Gilliam.Â Sister Lura obeyed the gospel while young under the preaching of Brother Woods.Â She was married three years ago to Bedford Guin.Â She leaves a husband, two little children, two sisters, two brothers, and an aged father and mother.Â Just before she crossed the dark river she called her friends and asked how many were ready to go with her; she said that she had to go and that she was ready and willing.Â She told her husband that all she regretted was leaving him and her little children; that she was going to a better world; that she wanted him to live better in the future and rear the children right, for she hoped to meet them in a better world.Â She called her father and brothers, who are serving the flesh, and told them she must leave them, but said she was willing to go, and asked them to live better lives and come to her.Â She left a Christian mother on the bed of affliction, who had to be carried to Lura's bed to take a last look at her.Â Her husband, parents, and many friends are grieved to give her up, but they find consolation in her last words and in the fact that death is not the end.Â Brother Tipton conducted the funeral exercises.\n\nS. E. Johnson., Millport, Ala.\n\nGospel Advocate, April 11, 1901, page 238.\n\nGunn, Fannie\n\nÂ Â Miss Fannie, daughter of Julia A. Francis Gunn, departed this life on December 2, 1900.Â Sister Fannie was born on October 11, 1875, making her stay on earth twenty-five years, one month, and twenty-one days.Â In August, 1892, she was \"born again\" under the preaching of Brother F. B. Srygley, and became an \"heir of God and a joint heir with Christ\"--entered the church of God, where all of the precious promises of God are enjoyed.Â Judging her from her treatment of her stepfather, Brother Connor, and her half-brother, she was an excellent girl.Â Brother Connor tells me that she never gave him a single unkind word.Â Sister Fannie was loved by all who knew her; if she had an enemy, I do not know it.Â She had been in feeble health for years.Â Death is full of sadness, somehow, but the manner in which Sister Fannie came to her death was indeed tragic, and deplorable beyond human expression.Â She, being alone, had a fit and fell into the fire.Â How long she was there is unknown, but when found by her aunt her clothes were all burned, part of her teeth were burned out, and her body was still burning.Â On December 1, 1900, the writer, with others, ate dinner that she had prepared.Â When the message reached me to come and preach her funeral, I felt it was more than I could bear; but I found sweet repose on Jesus' promises, which are sufficient.Â I believe Fannie is asleep, resting from her labors.Â We weep, but not as those who have no hope; for we believe that when Jesus comes again she will be one of his jewels.Â Let me say to all of her loved ones and friends: Be faithful till death, if you want to see her and be with her.Â I extend my sympathy to the heartbroken ones; surely I know their feelings.Â May the good Lord help us all to be faithful, that we may meet our loved ones on the eternal shores, where we will never part again.\n\nR. T. Sisco., Hall's Hill, Tenn.\n\nGospel Advocate, March 7, 1901, page 155.\n\nGaines, Mary A.\n\nÂ Â Sister Mary A. Gaines was born in Cumberland County, Ky., on March 16, 1814, was married to James H. Gaines on April 2, 1835, obeyed the gospel under the preaching of Bro. Samuel Trice between forty-five and fifty years ago, and lived a devoted, consistent and earnest Christian from that time till she was called to her eternal home on May 18, 1889.Â Her maiden name was Harrison, and she was a second cousin to President William Henry Harrison.Â For many years a widow, adorned by all the Christian graces, she endeared herself to all of her acquaintances, and when she departed from among us it was the universal sentiment of the people that one of the purest and best had gone to that beautiful mansion not made with hands, eternal in the heaven.Â As an example of the devotion and consecration of our sister to the cause of the Master, it is remembered by the older citizens of Gainesboro that soon after the war the church at this place consisted of about a dozen devout Christian women--not a single male member to lead in any service whatever.Â This noble band of sisters, one of whom was our sister Gaines, met regularly every Lord's day to study the Bible, sing hymns, and encourage each other in the Christian work.Â They continued this work for several years until Bro. Huffman held a meeting for them, when the church began to grow, and through them and him the Lord established a prosperous church at this place.Â Only three of this noble band of sisters now remain with us.Â Sister Gaines' two children went before her to try the realities of the great hereafter, her only son falling in battle for his native southland, and her daughter, Mrs. Margy Green, having died in the triumphs of a living faith a number of years ago. One granddaughter and three great grandchildren are the only living descendants of sister Gaines.\n\nJ. Z. B., Gainesboro, Tenn., July 29, 1889.\n\nGospel Advocate, August 7, 1889, page 498.\n\nGalloway, Matthew Justice\n\nÂ Â Matthew Justice Galloway was born May 26, 1813, died April 6, 1889--aged 75 years, 10 months and twenty days.Â He joined the Missionary Baptist church when young and lived a consistent member for more than forty years.Â Â He become fully convinced that his people taught for doctrine things foreign to scripture.Â He joined the Christian church under the teaching of Frank Davis and from that time lived so far as man could judge a zealous Christian life.Â He leaves his aged companion and four children, three sons and one daughter, together with a large circle of friends and kindred to mourn their loss, but we feel very sure our loss is father's eternal gain, and with his long, pious, and godly life before us, we can feel comfort in this sad bereavement, feeling sure that all is well with father.\n\nHis Children.\n\nGospel Advocate, May 22, 1889, page 331.\n\nÂ Gardner, Jane\n\nÂ Â Sister Jane Gardner, wife of brother John Gardner, suddenly died on Sunday morning the 9th of March, 1879. She had passed her three score years and ten, several years, having faithfully served her heavenly Master upwards of forty.Â Sister Gardner was a good woman, faithful in all her relations, as wife, mother, neighbor and Christian.Â The very large number that attended her funeral attested the esteem in which she was held in the community.Â Our aged brother has the sympathies of the community, in being left alone in the world.\n\nJ. D. Floyd., Flat Creek, Tenn.\n\nGospel Advocate, June 12, 1879, page 375.\n\nGeer, Thomas Carter\n\nÂ Â Thomas Carter Geer, 78, died April 1 after many years as a preacher and missionary.\n\nÂ Â Geer preached and taught in schools and churches in Arkansas, Florida, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.Â He also served as an administrator and teacher at Crowley's Ridge College in Paragould, Ark.\n\nÂ Â Geer entered the mission field at age 60, and he and his wife, Ruth, spent 16 years as missionaries in Tanzania and Kenya. They returned to the United States shortly before Geer's death.\n\nÂ Â He is survived by his wife, Ruth Summitt Geer; three daughters, Sandra Halfacre, Janet Allison and Ruth Deck; one son, Tom Geer; four sisters, Adelia DeGraw, Burnie Bryant, Dora Grayson and Mattie Lou Robinson; two brothers, Sam and Carl Geer; 12 grandchildren and two great-"
