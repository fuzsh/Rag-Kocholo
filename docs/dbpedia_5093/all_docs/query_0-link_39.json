Notes for DAVID MICHAEL EAGER: David Michael was born at Welborn Baptist Hospital and delivered by Dr. Urban Stork who was the same doctor who delivered his father, David George Eager, on October 19, 1937. When I went to the hospital to deliver I thought Dr. Harold Davidson would be delivering David Michael because Dr. Stork's daughter had just been drowned. I was extremely surprised when Dr. Stork showed up to deliver David in spite of the tragedy of losing his daughter. During this pregnancy I gained over 60 pounds. Dave (my husband) always laughs about pushing me down on the bed and I couldn't get up. I guess I was like a turtle which had been turned over on its back. Also, I couldn't see my feet or tye my shoes. On my birthday, June 8th, Dave took me out to dinner. My feet were so swollen we bought a pair of \"huge\" shoes for me to wear. On June 12th David Michael was born...a very exciting time of our lives. David's death was the worst thing I've ever experienced. No one can understand the agony of losing a child. David was shown one evening from 7:00 p.m until 9:00 p.m. and during that three period, over 500 people came through the receiving lines. There were so many people that Dave and I had our own lines. We were also amazed at the number of floral arrangements. There were so many that the funeral home moved many of them into the hallway. The funeral service was held at Sansom-Kriekhaus Funeral Home and Dr. Webb Garrison, our minister from Central Methodist Church in Evansville, IN, officiated. David is buried in the Masonic section of Sunset Memorial Gardens Cemetery on St. George Road in Evansville, IN. He is buried in the Eager plot with his grandfather and grandmother Eager. ii.
