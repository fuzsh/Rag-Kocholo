        "text": "ALAN GRATZER, REO SPEEDWAGONS FOUNDING FATHER\n\nA biography written by Kimberly Tolley (Kimmers)\n\nBetween 1968 and 1989, a young, enthusiastic rock band named REO Speedwagon successfully made the transition\n\nfrom local favorites in Champaign, Illinois, to worldwide fame and notoriety. Leading them every step of the way was\n\ndrummer and co-founder Alan Franklin Gratzer. In the liner notes of the bands Second Decade of Rock And Roll album,\n\nlead singer Kevin Cronin describes Alan as a solid rock drummer, as well as the most stable member of the band\n\nemotionally and business wise. He earned the respect and trust of everyone he met with his easy-going personality,\n\nsense of humor, and level-headed approach for resolving conflict.\n\nMost die hard REO fans (myself included) would have a difficult time envisioning Alan in any other gig besides\n\nplaying the drums. However, there was a time some time ago when his career plans were much different. In the late\n\nsixties, he entered the University of Illinois in Champaign to pursue a degree in aeronautical engineering.\n\nOnce he began taking classes, he realized he was moving in the wrong direction. During his interview for the VH-1\n\ndocumentary Behind The Music, he says, Between chemistry and physics, I didnt have a clue. Luckily, his roommate\n\nwas a fellow engineering major named Neal Doughty, who had a talent for playing the Hammond organ and piano. Once they discovered their mutual love of music, Neal, Alan, and a few of their buddies formed a band that they decided to call\n\nREO Speedwagon after Neal learned of the name in his History of Transportation class. The REO Speedwagon was a\n\nhigh velocity brand of truck & fire engine manufactured by Ransom Eli Olds (future creator of the Oldsmobile) at the\n\nturn of the century. U of I chemistry major Irving Azoff signed on as the bands manager, and a fledging musical\n\nempire was born.\n\nAt first, REO performances were limited to fraternity houses on campus, and local nightspots around Champaign,\n\nbut when the university walls began to close in on them, they decided to hit the road and never look back. In Behind The Music,\n\nformer REO bassist Gregg Philbin described life as they knew it. Things were desperate there, because we existed pretty\n\nmuch day to day, week to week by playing, by performing.\n\nIt is this phase of a musicians career that is the most critical test of their dedication and commitment to their craft. Most\n\nbands crack under the strain and pressure, and fade into obscurity even before anyone knows they existed. But\n\nREO Speedwagon would prove to be cut from a much stronger cloth as they maintained their hectic touring and\n\nrecording schedule.\n\nIn 1981, the band released their tenth album, Hi Infidelity, which immediately went to #1 on the billboard charts.\n\nKevin Cronins heartfelt ballad Keep On Loving You became REOs first #1 single. The record soon went platinum,\n\nand the band hit the big time. As they honed their chops and made all the necessary adjustments in their lives, both on\n\nand offstage, Alan maintained his role as the sturdy, solid leader, partying with his bandmates in the festive times, and\n\noffering calm, cool logic when tempers flared.\n\nBy the late eighties, however, REOs founding father began to grow weary of the nonstop pace of rock & roll.\n\nIn 1989, after several years of careful contemplation, he finally decided it was time to retire. He describes why\n\nin Behind The Music.\n\nBeing on the road, being away from my wife, being away from my kids it was torture. When {my hotel room door}\n\nwould slam behind me, it felt literally like I was in prison. Its a quiet room, 3000 miles away from home .this is not\n\nwhere I want to be.\n\nBassist Bruce Hall, keyboard player Neal Doughty, and lead singer Kevin Cronin took the news in stride, having known\n\nfor some time how unhappy Alan was. But lead guitarist Gary Richrath was totally unprepared for Alans decision, and\n\nhad the most emotional reaction. Alan said, He just gave me a big hug and wouldnt let go. We both burst into tears. It was\n\njust one of those things where wed been together for so long, this is really tough.\n\nDuring the Second Decade interview in 1990, Kevin reflected on the impact of Alans retirement. I had no idea at the time\n\nhow deeply, or on how many levels, Alans departure would affect the group. He didnt elaborate any farther in the interview,\n\nbut any one of us could easily put ourselves in the bands shoes, and think how we would feel if the family member we\n\ndepended the most on suddenly wasnt there anymore. The difference is, we wouldnt have the eyes of the world watching\n\nus as we rolled with the changes.\n\nAfter temporarily working with ex-Santana skins basher Graham Lear, the band recruited L.A. drummer Bryan Hitt,\n\nwho had previously worked with Wang Chung, done many movie soundtracks, and session work with various rock bands.\n\nBryan remains with the lineup to this day. Alan eagerly reports, I really like Bryan Hitt. Hes a very nice guy and\n\nmuch more technically proficient than I ever was. I hear hes a pretty good golfer, too! (The best one in the band,\n\naccording to Bryan). J\n\nCurrently, Alan and his wife Nancy stay busy with various small business ventures. He has no regrets about his decision\n\nto leave REO, and cherishes his time with his family, but adds that he misses all the great, loyal fans that made being\n\non stage all those years such fun.\n\nWhat does the future hold for Alan and REO? In a 1996 interview with REO Pals International, he says, If there was\n\na reunion tour with the five of us, it would take a bit of soul searching to consider whether Id do it or not, but I wouldnt rule\n\nit out. He occasionally sits in on live REO gigs when his schedule allows, and its clear from the audience reaction, and the\n\nreaction of the band, that his cameo appearances are very much appreciated.\n\nWhether or not a reunion tour ever happens, Alans very impressive REO resume will always precede him. Ever humble,\n\nand never one to toot his own horn, he preferred to keep a low profile, giving his band mates a solid backbone that allowed\n\nthem to shine like the stars they were always destined to be. His commitment to, and love for, the rock and roll family he\n\ncreated has remained constant to this day.\n\nFrom the bottom of our hearts, Alan, we thank you for 21 wonderful years of REO magic!\n\nWe love you and miss you too!
