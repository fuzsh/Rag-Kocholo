        "text": "Jimmy Neil Doughty entered his Heavenly home on September 10, 2022. He was born April 18, 1930, in Oklahoma City to Oscar and Jewell Doughty (Wheeler).\n\nJim grew up in Oklahoma City and attended Capitol Hill High School. He worked at Allied Steel from 1949 to 1978 and then went on to work for Rent-a-Crane until retirement. Jim married the love of his life, Janet Burroughs, in 1949. They were blessed with nearly 47 years of a wonderful marriage prior to Janet’s passing in 1996. Jim later married Helen Haggard in 1998 and enjoyed 13 years together prior to Helen’s passing in 2011.\n\nJim loved dogs of all kinds and often took in any and every dog he found. He did not go searching for dogs. As Jim would say, they chose him! They would come wandering up to his home, hungry and in need of care, and he never thought twice. He had a true heart for them and cared for a multitude of dogs over the years.\n\nIn addition, he had a passion for motorcycles and loved riding. He also enjoyed bicycles and golfing. Jim was a member of Woodland Hills Baptist Church in Newcastle.\n\nHe was preceded in passing by: his parents, Oscar and Jewell Doughty; his first wife, Janet Doughty; his second wife, Helen Doughty; and his grandson, Joey Phillips.\n\nThose left to continue his legacy include: his son, Mike Doughty and wife Nancy; daughter, Patti Cureton; grandchildren, Lindsey Prichard, Patrick Phillips and wife Jennifer, Joshua Phillips and wife Chelsea, Betsy Doughty and husband Jay Lenoce, and Carrie Milligan and husband Jason; great-grandchildren, Allison Fowler, Rhyder Phillips, Weston Phillips, Spencer Phillips, Deacon Phillips, Carson Milligan, and Emma Milligan. Jim is also survived by many loving nieces and nephews and extended family and friends."
