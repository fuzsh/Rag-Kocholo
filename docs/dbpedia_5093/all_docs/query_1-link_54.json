        "text": "Can’t really say it’s been a good year\n\nI know I’ll see better days\n\nSome things that shouldn’t have been going on around here\n\nHave been going on anyways\n\nI was face down in a pool of my own self-pity\n\nGotta pick myself up and get out of this city\n\nGotta leave before I hurt someone\n\nThere’s a place somewhere I’m gonna find\n\nWhere I can feel safe and leave it all behind\n\nGonna get away and have myself a little fun\n\n‘Cause you can knock me down, run me over\n\nBack up and run me down again\n\nYou ain’t the first – I’ve been treated worse\n\nGuess I oughta be more careful choosing my friends\n\nWell, you can leave me cold – I’ll recover\n\nSay nasty things about my mother\n\nWell, you can beat me, mistreat me\n\nBut guess who’ll be smilin’ in the end?\n\nPlayin’ in bands since I was a kid\n\nAlways part of the brotherhood\n\nBut a lonely, only child\n\nOnly barely understood\n\nI was told I’d never make it so many times before\n\nThe best and the brightest had shown me the door\n\nBut the more they tried to hold me back, the stronger I got\n\nThey said my songs were too simple, my voice was too weak\n\nSaid I was too young, too dumb, too much of a freak\n\nThey thought they could write me off\n\nBut there’s somethin’ they forgot\n\n‘Cause you can knock me down, run me over\n\nBack up and run me down again\n\nYou ain’t the first – I’ve been treated worse\n\nGuess I oughta be more careful choosing my friends\n\nWell, you can leave me cold – I’ll recover\n\nSay nasty things about my mother\n\nWell, you can beat me, mistreat me\n\nBut guess who’ll be smilin’ in the end?\n\nI won’t say I ain’t had my share of good luck\n\nGood luck is fine, it just ain’t enough\n\n‘Cause you can knock me down, run me over\n\nBack up and run me down again\n\nYou ain’t the first – I’ve been treated worse\n\nGuess I oughta be more careful choosing my friends\n\nWell, you can leave me cold – I’ll recover\n\nSay nasty things about my mother\n\nWell, you can beat me, mistreat me\n\nBut guess who’ll be smilin’ in the end?\n\nI need love like water\n\nI need truth to soak me to the bone\n\nI need my friends all around me now\n\n‘Cause I’l not doin’ real well when I’m alone\n\nSee, my best friend, or at least I thought she was\n\nHas found herself a new friend back at home\n\nI’m drifting here on what’s left of my heart\n\nAnd my spirit is floatin’ like a stonoe\n\nNow, my faith is an illusion\n\nMy dreams, some passing ship\n\nI’m reaching out for answers, but I’m losing my grip\n\nSo tell me, are you gonna go the distance\n\nStep into the cold, hard rain\n\nAre you gonna keep fightin’ through and come back again\n\nI’ll forgive your trespasses\n\nAsk your mercy for my own\n\nI’ve gone as far as I can go\n\nNow it’s up to you to find your own way home\n\nI need time, but there’s no time\n\nMy emotions have dipped into the red\n\nAnd this vision that I just can’t wash away\n\nIs tearin’ in my head\n\nAnd I believe in redemption\n\nThere’s hope for every soul\n\nBut I can’t wait forever for a miracle\n\nSo tell me, are you gonna go the distance\n\nStep into the cold, hard rain\n\nAre you gonna keep fightin’ through and come back again\n\nI’ll forgive your trespasses\n\nAsk your mercy for my own\n\nI’ve gone as far as I can go\n\nNow it’s up to you to find your own way home\n\nSome days I feel like letting go – I’ve held on for so long\n\nDo I need to walk away to see how it feels when I’m gone\n\nSo tell me, are you gonna go the distance\n\nStep into the cold, hard rain\n\nAre you gonna keep fightin’ through and come back again\n\nI’ll forgive your trespasses\n\nAsk your mercy for my own\n\nI’ve gone as far as I can go\n\nNow it’s up to you to find your own way home\n\nSo close to given up\n\nNever before been so broken\n\nCan I hold on long enough\n\nAre there words yet left unspoken\n\nCan I rise above the burning sea\n\nOr am I human after all\n\nMaybe I’m just higher than a man should be\n\nMaybe I needed to fall\n\nI needed to fall and come back stronger\n\nI needed to crawl to find my way\n\nAnd I pray we can look back on it all\n\nKnowing that I needed to fall in love with you\n\nSo tired of living up\n\nTo an image laid upon me\n\nCan I ever be enough\n\nIt all seems so far beyond me\n\nAnd I take this weight upon my shoulders\n\nWhile I appear to stand so tall\n\nThinking I can carry the world forever\n\nMaybe I needed to fall\n\nI needed to fall and come back stronger\n\nI needed to crawl to find my way\n\nAnd I pray we can look back on it all\n\nKnowing that I needed to fall in love with you\n\nThere is just so much a man can bear\n\nUntil he starts to find it hard to care\n\nAnd baby, I’m almost there\n\nI needed to fall and come back stronger\n\nI needed to crawl to find my way\n\nAnd I pray we can look back on it all\n\nKnowing that I needed to fall in love with you\n\nI’ve been thinkin’ too much, I’ve been drinkin’ too much\n\nAnd thinkin’ and drinkin’ for me is a dangerous combination\n\nAnd I’m lonely as hell with a story to tell\n\nI’m talkin’ to myself and that’s a dangerous conversation\n\nBaby, you could save me tonight\n\nYou could make everything alright\n\nYou’re lookin’ better by the minute\n\nI’m tryin’ to keep from falling in it\n\nBut you may be just a little too much temptation\n\nIf we’re gonna turn back, better turn back now\n\nI’d say no, but I don’t know how\n\nGirl, I really should be leaving\n\nBut that’s another conversation\n\nBaby, you and me tonight is a dangerous combination\n\nI’ve been trying so hard, feel like crying so hard\n\nBaby, I may die trying to find a taste of sweet salvation\n\nBut it all looks so clear through these glasses of beer\n\nAnd in your eyes, I’ve stumbled upon a double shot of inspiration\n\nA rock and a hard place, I’m in between\n\nCome on, baby, and set me free\n\nBut you may be just a little too much temptation\n\nIf we’re gonna turn back, better turn back now\n\nI’d say no, but I don’t know how\n\nGirl, I really should be leaving\n\nBut that’s another conversation\n\nBaby, you and me tonight is a dangerous combination\n\nThere is no easy way to say goodbye\n\nI’ve prayed this day would never come\n\nIt’s best if I just walk away\n\nBetter if I run\n\nWish I could stay here on our secret island\n\nDon’t want to leave you in this place, but in\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nAnother lifetime, a different world\n\nWe could be together, you could be my girl\n\nRight beside me around every turn\n\nIn another lifetime\n\nA different world\n\nI swear I never meant to break your heart\n\nOr ever cause you any pain\n\nNow you’re telling me you can’t go on\n\nYou can’t last another day\n\nWhere do I go with all this mixed emotion\n\nI just want to fly away to\n\n[Chorus]\n\nWe’ll move along through our separate lives\n\nIt’s gonna take some time, but we’ll be alright in\n\n[Chorus 2x]\n\nIn another lifetime\n\nIn another lifetime\n\nA different world\n\nDon’t you wish we could run away baby\n\nFind ourselves a little space\n\nJust you and me and a sunny day, hey, hey\n\nIn some secret hiding place\n\nSpread a blanket by the riverside\n\nLay back and dream\n\nThrow our clothes in a big pile\n\nWash each other down in a cool stream\n\nDon’t you wish we could run away baby\n\nWe don’t have to go too far\n\nWe don’t need any air tickets darlin’\n\nLet’s just hop inside my car\n\nCheck into a no tell motel\n\nHave them hold our calls\n\nGet as crazy as we can in an hour\n\nShake the pictures off of those thin walls\n\nOh, now I don’t want to sound like I’m complaining\n\nOh, I’m just looking for some blue skies\n\nIt’s been raining so long\n\nOh, now I don’t want to sound like I’m complaining\n\nOh, I’m just looking for some blue skies\n\nIt’s been raining\n\nDon’t you wish we could run away baby\n\nFind ourselves a little space\n\nJust you and me and a sunny day, hey, hey\n\nIn some secret hiding place\n\nDon’t you wish we could run away\n\nDon’t you wish we could run away\n\nDon’t you wish we could run away baby\n\nDon’t you wish we could run away\n\nRun away, run away, hey, hey, hey\n\nI can’t fight this feeling any longer\n\nAnd yet I’m still afraid to let it flow\n\nWhat started out as friendship, has grown stronger\n\nI only wish I had the strength to let it show\n\nI tell myself that I can’t hold out forever\n\nI said there is no reason for my fear\n\nCause I feel so secure when we’re together\n\nYou give my life direction\n\nYou make everything so clear\n\nAnd even as I wander\n\nI’m keeping you in sight\n\nYou’re a candle in the window\n\nOn a cold, dark winter’s night\n\nAnd I’m getting closer than I ever thought I might\n\nAnd I can’t fight this feeling anymore\n\nI’ve forgotten what I started fighting for\n\nIt’s time to bring this ship into the shore\n\nAnd throw away the oars, forever\n\nCause I can’t fight this feeling anymore\n\nI’ve forgotten what I started fighting for\n\nAnd if I have to crawl upon the floor\n\nCome crashing through your door\n\nBaby, I can’t fight this feeling anymore\n\nMy life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you\n\nI’ve been running round in circles in my mind\n\nAnd it always seems that I’m following you, girl\n\nCause you take me to the places that alone I’d never find\n\nAnd even as I wander I’m keeping you in sight\n\nYou’re a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter’s night\n\nAnd I’m getting closer than I ever thought I might\n\nAnd I can’t fight this feeling anymore\n\nI’ve forgotten what I started fighting for\n\nIt’s time to bring this ship into the shore\n\nAnd throw away the oars, forever\n\nCause I can’t fight this feeling anymore\n\nI’ve forgotten what I started fighting for\n\nAnd if I have to crawl upon the floor\n\nCome crashing through your door\n\nBaby, I can’t fight this feeling anymore.\n\nFrom the beginning,\n\nWhen time began\n\nEvery good woman needs a lovin’ man\n\nSomeone to hold her,\n\nTake good care of her\n\nRemove the weight of the world from her shoulders\n\n‘Cause when you’re happy baby, I’m so glad\n\nAnd when you’ve got the blues, I’m so sad\n\nI’ll do my best to make you feel better\n\nWe’ll make it through this crazy world together\n\nYes I was born to love you?\n\nWith all of my heart and soul\n\nYes I was born to love you\n\nI’ll give you all I’ve got and then I’ll give you more\n\n‘Cause I was born to love you baby\n\nLove, it’s so complicated\n\nIt makes you weak, it makes you strong\n\nNo doubt about it, just got to shout it\n\nSomething so right, well you know it can’t be wrong\n\nYes I was born to love you?\n\nWith all of my heart and all of my soul\n\nYes I was born to love you\n\nI’ll give you all I’ve got and then I’ll give you more\n\nDon’t stop, don’t stop now\n\nI’m in too deep and I don’t want to come out\n\nThere’s no way in the world that I can be wrong\n\nThis time\n\nMy heart has been broken in so many ways\n\nI can’t bring back those days\n\nNow it’s you, please be true\n\nYes I was born to love you\n\nOh I was born to love you?\n\nWith all of my heart and soul\n\nYes I was born to love you\n\nI’ll give you all I’ve got and then I’ll give you more\n\nYes I was born to love you?\n\nAll night do everything, every night my life\n\nYes I was born to love you\n\nI was born to love you baby\n\nI was born to love you baby\n\nNo doubt about it, just got to shout it\n\nI was born to love you baby\n\nWe’ll make it through this crazy world together\n\nI was born to love you\n\nEvery night, every day\n\nI was born to love you\n\nLet my love find you\n\nIf it takes all night\n\nWe can sleep tomorrow\n\nIn the warm sunlight.\n\nThere’s a new day coming\n\nIn a future bright\n\nLet my love find you\n\nIt will be all right.\n\nLet my love find you\n\nIt will be alright.\n\nMay your spirit guide you\n\nMay it brightly burn\n\nFor the truth inside you\n\nMay you always yearn\n\nMay I walk beside you\n\nAs we live and learn\n\nMay your spirit guide you\n\nEverywhere you turn.\n\nMay your spirit guide you\n\nEverywhere you turn.\n\nOh baby, this is a dream\n\nI have for us tonight\n\nBaby, this is a prayer\n\nI will say before I sleep\n\nHoping it will keep us together,\n\nforever."
