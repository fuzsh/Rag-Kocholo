And though Todd and Blair are definitely still on the outs (remember, he did “kill” his twin brother and frame her boyfriend for the crime!), the chemistry between the two is as undeniable as it ever was — and it’s never more apparent than in the final moments of this preview.\n\nThat said, as we first told you, Blair comes also bearing news for Todd — and he has something he wants to tell her. Hmmm….\n\nBlair first resurfaces on Wednesday’s GH, most likely in the very final seconds (you know how it is). Press PLAY for a sneak peek at her and Todd’s sparkage, and then hit the comments with your thoughts on the possible love (re)connection!\n\nP.S. Bonus points for the Irene Manning nod, Todd!\n\nRelated stories\n\nExclusive: Smash Alum Will Chase Is Gonna Rock Necessary Roughness\n\nExclusive Suits First Look: Meet Louis' Furry BFF\n\nSons of Anarchy Sneak Peek Offers 'Explosions and Nudity,' Jimmy Smits and Harold Perrineau"
