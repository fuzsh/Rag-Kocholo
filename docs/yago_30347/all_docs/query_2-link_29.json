        "text": "Fan favorite Kassie DePaiva is coming back to General Hospital. The actress first appeared on the show over a decade ago as Blair Cramer, her One Life to Live character.\n\nKassie DePaiva Brings Blair Back to GH\n\nTV Line broke the news that DePaiva is returning to GH. The actress first played Blair on GH back in 2012 following the cancellation of OLTL. Other characters connected to Blair, including her ex-husband Todd (Roger Howarth) and their daughter Starr (Kristen Alderson), migrated to Port Charles around this time and had longer stays on the show.\n\nPlaying Eve\n\nRecently, DePaiva resurfaced on Days of our Lives as Eve Donovan, where Eve was reunited with high school pal Harris Michaels (Steve Burton, ex-Jason, GH). There was a time following the cancellations of AMC in 2011 and OLTL in 2012 when ABC did not have the rights to utilize characters from Pine Valley and Llanview as they’d been licensed to The Online Network for the digital revivals of AMC and OLTL.\n\nKassie DePaiva: Class Reunion\n\nLater, ABC regained the rights to those characters. In some cases, familiar faces reprise their roles — like Walt Willey bringing AMC’s Jackson and Hillary B. Smith taking Nora from OLTL to GH. In other cases, actors, including Knight, Cameron Mathison (Drew; ex-Ryan, AMC), and James Patrick Stuart (Valentin; ex-Will, AMC), take on new characters.\n\nMichael Maloney is the Sr. West Coast Editor of Soap Hub. He has been writing about soap operas for both consumer and trade publications for 30 years.\n\nPrior to joining Soap Hub, Michael had been on staff at Soap Opera Digest, Soap Opera Magazine, Soap Opera Update, Soaps In Depth, In Touch, and Inside TV. He has written for Variety, TV Guide, TV Insider, AOL TV, and TODAY.\n\nBased in Los Angeles, Michael authored the book “The Young and Restless Life of William J. Bell” with Lee Phillip Bell (Sourcebooks, 2012)."
