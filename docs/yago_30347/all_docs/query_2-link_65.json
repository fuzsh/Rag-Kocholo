        "text": "As soon as it was announced that Kassie DePaiva would be reprising the role of Blair Cramer in another return to GENERAL HOSPITAL, fans started speculating about what would bring the Llanview resident back to Port Charles. And now, shortly before her first episode airs on Friday, Sept. 15, the truth has been revealed! Stop reading right now if you don’t want any spoilers… but honestly, if you’re already reading this article, then you probably aren’t really concerned about that!\n\nAs many fans have already successfully guessed, TVLine.com has confirmed that Blair will be playing the oft-mentioned third ex-wife of attorney Martin Grey. As part of this storyline, DePaiva will share scenes with Michael E. Knight (Martin) as well as Jane Elliot (Tracy). And, we should hope, Lynn Herring (Lucy)!\n\nDePaiva and Knight did share the screen together back in 2010 when Tad met Blair as part of ABC Daytime’s “What If” webisodes. The pair encountered each other on a flight to Jamaica and, after comparing their disastrous love lives, they performed together in a fantasy musical number singing the song “I Suck at Love.”\n\nDePaiva took over the role of Blair on ONE LIFE TO LIVE back in 1993 and played the popular character until the soap’s final episode on ABC in 2012. She then joined some other Llanview residents in crossing over to GH, though, unlike Kristen Alderson’s Starr, Michael Easton’s John, and Roger Howarth’s Todd, DePaiva’s alter ego didn’t stick around.\n\nDuring those GH appearances, Blair turned down Todd’s marriage proposal because she was engaged to Tomás Delgado. And then in 2013, when DePaiva reprised the role for the sadly short-lived online reboot of OLTL, those episodes ended with Blair reuniting with Todd and secretly marrying him before he went on the run.\n\nThis means that somewhere in the past 10 years, Blair and Todd must have gotten divorced so she could marry (and then divorce) Martin. Although she must be doing quite well for herself if she’s been paying him alimony all these years. Back in 2013, Blair was running a nightclub called Shelter in Llanview. Perhaps she expanded?\n\nDon’t miss DePaiva’s return to GH in the upcoming episodes because Blair is going to add a whole new twist to this storyline!"
