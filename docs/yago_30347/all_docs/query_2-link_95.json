        "text": "Port Charles is about to get interesting as Blair brings over some Llanview flare. If you enjoyed Kassie DePaiva’s first day in Port Charles, then you’re in for a treat.\n\nHere’s a behind-the-scenes look at Kassie DePaiva’s OLTL reunion with Roger Howarth (Todd Manning OLTL, Franco Baldwin/Austin Holt GH). Lucy (Lynn Herring) and Tracy (Jane Elliot) and Martin (Michael E. Knight) joined in on the fun too! Anything is possible with Blair in Port Charles. Not to mention, that handsome lawyer from Pine Valley is likely to pop back in. DePaiva and Howarth go way back as one of One Life to Live’s most popular super couple of all time. Todd and Blair were GH’s Sonny and Carly.\n\nBlair Lands In Port Charles\n\nGeneral Hospital spoilers tease that it’s going to be a wild ride as Blair’s plans for Marty unravel. In the near future, Lucy learns the truth about Marty and the Deceptor. This makes Lucy questions whether or not she would even still want to marry Marty. After being lied to, and knowing that he’s capable of stealing ideas and mooching off of his ex-wife, how can she not question it?\n\nWill Blair’s plan fail once Lucy finds out that Martin stole Blair’s idea and lied about it?\n\nOh what a shame, Martin looks so nervous. In my opinion it serves him right for how he treats Lucy. Martin Grey (Michael E. Knight) and Lucy Coe (Lynn Herring) may appear to have had a solid, healthy, relationship, but his secrets say otherwise.\n\nPort Charles has become a melting pot for fictional cities from ABC soaps. Like Jackson Montgomery (Walt Willey) from Pine Valley, Blair Cramer from Llanview is from one of ABC’s since cancelled, sister soaps. Personally, I love that ABC keeps these characters alive. They’ve been a part of our culture for so long, and shouldn’t be forgotten. I believe that General Hospital, (and Port Charles) is the perfect place to bring these names back to life. Meaning, the character and the actors who are most famous for portraying them.\n\nBlair Comes For Martin and Tracy- The Deceptor Belongs to Blair\n\nPreviously, GH Blog shared the news with fans that Blair Cramer is Martin’s ex-wife. You know, the one who pays him $50K a month? Yeah, that one. We also predicted that Blair would have something to do with the Deceptor. And boy were we right! According to the latest General Hospital spoilers, DePaiva will share scenes with Jane Elliot as Blair Cramer and Tracy Quartermaine.\n\nOk, so we know that Blair will share scenes with Tracy. That said, is Blair there to confront Tracy about the Deceptor? Or, are they working together against Lucy Coe? Still, it’s possible that Martin stole the Deceptor idea from Blair, and now she’s in Port Charles to settle the score.\n\nSpoiler Alert! It looks like you won’t have to wait for Kassie DePaiva’s GH return to find out what she’s doing in Port Charles. Instead, you are privy to the know DePaiva’s GH role prior to her arrival. So if you just can’t wait to find out what business OLTL’s Blair Cramer has in Port Charles, then keep on reading!\n\nPreviously, General Hospital Blog reported that DePaiva was set to bring Blair to PC. While fans were left unaware of the details, many put the pieces together. Blair’s purpose in PC remains the hot topic as DePaiva’s return debut approaches.\n\nLet’s just say that Martin should start preparing himself as his ex-wife reveals herself as such. As GH news reports confirm, OLTL’s Blair Cramer is Martin’s ex-wife! Now, poor Lucy deals with her personal life on top of the Deception drama.\n\nBlair is Martin’s ex-wife!?!? Incoming! From Llanview to Port Charles, a familiar face pops up into town! Throw a lawyer from Pine Valley in the mix and we have a full fledged ABC Soap Opera reunion! Ok, I’ll stop reminiscing now.\n\n…Martin Gray (Michael E. Knight) has some explaining to do. Now that Lucy Coe (Lynn Herring) confronted how about the alimony, she’s also come clean about snooping in Jackson Montgomery’s files. That’s when she admitted to snooping on Martin- but with good reason. Lucy wants answers, and if Martin won’t divulge, maybe ex-wife #3 will.\n\nGeneral Hospital news reports confirm that OLTL star Kassie DePaiva returns to GH this September. Meanwhile, another new yet familiar face has shown up recently. All My Children star and daytime tv icon, Walt Willey, joined General Hospital as his OG AMC role, Jackson Montgomery. The golden heartthrob gets all the boomer’s hearts ticking. In fact, Walt Willey (and Tom Jones) are my late mother’s absolute favorite celebrities. I remember her swooning over Walt every time Jackson popped up around 1 o’clock!\n\nOverall, Willey and DePaiva’s return to the screen has OG soap fans smiling from ear to ear. Moreover, recent GH rumors tease that Blair Cramer’s arrival ties into Jackson’s as they both have unfinished business with Martin Gray (Michael E. Knight).\n\nPort Charles feels like a revolving door as of late. Kassie DePaiva returns to GH! Familiar faces are all around if you’re familiar with Llanview and Pine Valley. All My Children and One Life To Live made up 2/3 of three iconic pieces of American history. Although AMC and OLTL may have ended their run over a decade ago, the shows live on as characters resurface in Port Charles.\n\nOver the years, AMC and OLTL’s characters and their portrayers became like household names to so many Americans. So when the two daytime dramas ended their run in 2011 and 2012, a great loss was felt all over the country and beyond. Meanwhile, other shows in various genres tried and failed to successfully fill those time slots. Sadly, nothing every stuck and we soap fans are still missing our favorites. Thankfully, Port Charles seems like it has an unlimited population limit. ????\n\nGeneral Hospital news reports confirm that OLTL actress Kassie DePaiva returns to GH as the iconic Blair Cramer! While her purpose in PC has yet to be determined, GH rumors hint toward the lady from Llanview and the man from Pine Valley stick around the same crowd. According to GH spoilers, Blaire arrives in PC in September."
