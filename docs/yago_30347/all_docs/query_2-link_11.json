        "text": "General Hospital (GH) spoilers reveal that ever since it was announced that Kassie DePaiva would be reprising her One Life to Live role and bringing Blair Cramer to Port Charles, fans have speculated about the reason she’ll pop up.\n\nMany viewers have guessed Blair might be Martin Grey’s (Michael E. Knight) infamous third ex-wife, especially since we’ve heard so much about her!\n\nIt was always just a matter of time until we met Martin’s least favorite former flame – and it turns out Blair Cramer is the woman we’ve been waiting for.\n\nTV Line confirms that Blair is indeed ex-wife number three for Martin, so she should be the unpleasant sight he spots on the September 15 episode.\n\nKassie DePaiva is sure to cause quite a stir when she catches up with dear old “Marty.”\n\nMartin won’t be happy once Blair heads to Port Charles, where she’ll also have some scenes with Tracy Quartermaine (Jane Elliot).\n\nGH fans will recall that Tracy had some phone conversations with a secret partner, so it seems Blair was the person on the other end of those calls.\n\nTracy has been stepping up as the leader of this lawsuit against Deception, but Blair is clearly caught up in all this as well.\n\nAlthough Lucy Coe (Lynn Herring) claims The Deceptor is her idea, the show’s been clear about Martin having some input.\n\nThere’s a reason why Martin always tries to downplay his role in helping Lucy come up with The Deceptor – and that’s probably because he stole it from Blair or someone close to her.\n\nBlair and Tracy may have a pretty strong case against Deception thanks to Martin’s actions, so look for him to land in some hot water on September 18 as Blair’s brief stint continues.\n\nOf course, this isn’t the first time Kassie DePaiva’s One Life to Live character has shown up in Port Charles.\n\nBlair Cramer also appeared on GH shortly after OLTL wrapped its ABC broadcast run in 2012, so it’ll be fun to see Blair back in town.\n\nGeneral Hospital spoilers say Blair will shake things up for Martin and a few others, so stick with us for updates on the shocking news she’ll bring with her.\n\nCDL will have other fantastic General Hospital spoilers, updates and news to read up on, so make us your favorite hotspot."
