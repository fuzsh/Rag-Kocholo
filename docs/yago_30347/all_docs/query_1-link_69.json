        "text": "The beautiful Blair Manning's presence in Llanview means only one thing: Trouble. As played by actress Kassie DePaiva, the selfish and greedy Blair continues to connive her way through the lives of others as she tries to attain the power and prestige she desperately desires. While grieving the death of husband Todd Manning, a convicted criminal and heir to the multi-million-dollar Lord fortune, Blair developed feelings for the man she once held responsible for Todd's death -- Patrick Thornhart. Just before Todd's \"return from the dead\", Blair became pregnant with Patrick's child. The pregnancy played a large role in keeping Todd and Blair apart, although they are still married. Starr's (Todd and Blair's daughter) need for a bone marrow transplant has somewhat brought the two together. Just recently, a car accident involving Blair and Patrick, and caused by Blair's cousin Kelly, caused Blair to miscarry, and she now is being treated for multiple injuries. Hopefully on the return of Kassie De Paiva's maternity leave, fans can look forward to a Todd and Blair reunion.\n\n\"One Life to Live\" marked Kassie's return to daytime television: She played good-girl Chelsea Reardon on \"Guiding Light\" from 1986 to 1991.\n\nBorn and raised in Kentucky with two older brothers and a younger sister, Kassie worked at Nashville, Tennessee's Opryland as a singer and, at the age of 18, debuted as a soloist at the legendary Grand Ole Opry, performing two songs. While working at Opryland, she realized that she wanted to entertain. Towards that end, she enrolled in Indiana University and later, at the University of California at Los Angeles, to study theater. While attending UCLA, she became a member of a four-part harmony band called Newport, which performed in the Los Angeles, San Diego and Las Vegas areas. Kassie ultimately dropped out of college to take advantage of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity: To travel with the USO on its Orient tour to Japan, Korea and Okinawa.\n\nShortly after her return to the United States, Kassie sang back-up for soul singer Bobby Womack during two United States and one Great Britain tour. Not long afterwards, she landed her first professional acting role, as Bobbie Jo in the feature film, \"Evil Dead II.\"\n\nJust before joining \"One Life to Live,\" Kassie completed guest-star appearances on episodes of prime-time television's \"Melrose Place,\" and the syndicated series, \"Baywatch\" and \"Timetrax.\"\n\nAn avid golfer, Kassie serves as co-host of the syndicated television golf show, \"The Pro Shop,\" and is once again actively pursuing her singing career.\n\nKassie is married to \"One Life To Live\" co-star James DePaiva (Max Holden), and they just had thier first child together, James Quentin DePaiva.
