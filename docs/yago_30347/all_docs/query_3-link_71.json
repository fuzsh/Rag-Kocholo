        "text": "NOTES TO DECISIONS\n\n1. General Principles.\n\nThe statute of limitations is looked upon with favor as a statute of repose, as it cannot be said that the result is harsh or inequitable, for there was a period of one year within which suit could have been started. West v. Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co., 108 F. Supp. 276, 1952 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2250 (D. Tenn. 1952).\n\nIn action by equal employment opportunity commission against employer where employer contended that action was barred by one year statute of limitations as provided by this section, court held that while general rule is that where no limitation is provided by federal law, the state law governs, an exception is made where the federal government or one of its agencies is plaintiff on the concept of sovereign immunity and federalism, particularly where practice complained of is contrary to public policy. EEOC v. Duff Bros., Inc., 364 F. Supp. 405, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11757 (E.D. Tenn. 1973).\n\nThis section being a procedural bar to legal remedies and not an extinguisher or qualifier of a statutory cause of action does not apply to a diversity action for wrongful death as the law of the forum state governs. Cummings v. Cowan, 390 F. Supp. 1251, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13512 (N.D. Miss. 1975).\n\nAn action for deprivation of constitutional rights in proceedings to attach plaintiff's automobiles was barred by this section where the alleged wrongful acts occurred more than one year prior to the filing of the suit. Boles v. Fox, 403 F. Supp. 253, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16044 (E.D. Tenn. 1975).\n\nAs a general rule this section is applicable to strict tort cases while § 47-2-725 is applicable to warranty actions. McCroskey v. Bryant Air Conditioning Co., 524 S.W.2d 487, 1975 Tenn. LEXIS 668 (Tenn. 1975).\n\nSection 29-28-103 is not a conventional statute of limitations. It imposes an outer limit or ceiling upon the existing statute of limitations relating to actions for personal injuries in this section. Buckner v. GAF Corp., 495 F. Supp. 351, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9742 (E.D. Tenn. 1979).\n\nIn determining whether the purpose of an action is to recover damages which are personal, to property, or on account of a breach of contract, the court must look to the complaint and ascertain the basis for which damages are sought. Harvest Corp. v. Ernst & Whinney, 610 S.W.2d 727, 1980 Tenn. App. LEXIS 417 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1980).\n\nSection 29-28-103 was meant to supplement in part and supersede in part the statute of limitations for personal tort actions provided in this section. Milligan v. American Hoist & Derrick Co., 622 F. Supp. 56, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16397 (W.D. Tenn. 1985).\n\nThere is no conflict between the provisions of § 50-6-112(d), regarding claims of workers covered by the workers' compensation provisions against third persons, and this section. Craig v. R.R. Street & Co., 794 S.W.2d 351, 1990 Tenn. App. LEXIS 12 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1990).\n\n2. —Constitutionality.\n\nThe fact that the statute starts to run at the date of the wrongful act or sale of a defective product does not constitute a violation of the due process clause. Hargraves v. Brackett Stripping Machine Co., 317 F. Supp. 676, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10281 (E.D. Tenn. 1970).\n\nFact that suit by workers' compensation recipient against manufacturer and supplier of equipment for personal injuries sustained from explosion of equipment during course of employment was governed by limitation of § 50-914 (now § 50-6-112) of one year from date of injury rather than applicable general limitation of this section, prior to its amendment, of one year from date of wrongful act or omission did not constitute unlawful discrimination prohibited by Tenn. Const., art. XI, § 8 or equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. 14. Dobbins v. Terrazzo Machine & Supply Co., 479 S.W.2d 806, 1972 Tenn. LEXIS 401 (Tenn. 1972).\n\nGiving amended statute of limitations retroactive effect was unconstitutional where it revived a cause of action that had expired prior to the amendment. Ford Motor Co. v. Moulton, 511 S.W.2d 690, 1974 Tenn. LEXIS 498 (Tenn. 1974).\n\n3. Application.\n\nThe one year time limitation of this section applies to an action based on racial discrimination in employment filed under 42 U.S.C. § 1981. Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 421 U.S. 454, 95 S. Ct. 1716, 44 L. Ed. 2d 295, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 15 (1975), superseded by statute as stated in, Tahy v. United States, — F.3d —, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 20250, 1999 Colo. J. C.A.R. 4937 (6th Cir. 1999).\n\nThis section does not affect the time period in which a civil action may be commenced after receipt of the right to sue letter pursuant to Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Draper v. United States Pipe & Foundry Co., 527 F.2d 515, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 11487 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1975).\n\nAs a special statute of limitation, § 28-3-202 takes precedence over the general statute, this section, although reference must be made to both such statutes in determining whether a particular claim is barred. Harper v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 498 F. Supp. 910, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20082 (E.D. Tenn. 1978), aff'd without opinion, Harper v. Grundy Motel Co., 633 F.2d 215, 1980 U.S. App. LEXIS 14245 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1980).\n\nWhere automobile accident occurred in Tennessee and defendants were residents of Tennessee, action filed in Tennessee more than one year after accident was barred by this section although an action had been filed in state where plaintiffs resided within such one-year period and was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Elias v. A & C Distributing Co., 588 S.W.2d 768, 1979 Tenn. App. LEXIS 353 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1075, 100 S. Ct. 1022, 62 L. Ed. 2d 757, 1980 U.S. LEXIS 711 (1980).\n\nA statute of limitations other than that contained in the Uniform Contribution Among Tort-feasors Act (UCATA), has no effect on an action under the UCATA and the party seeking contribution will not be barred by it. Manning v. Ft. Deposit Bank, 619 F. Supp. 1327, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14962 (W.D. Tenn. 1985), appeal dismissed without opinion, vacated without op., Fort Deposit Bank v. Waring, Cox, James, Sklar, & Allen, 798 F.2d 469, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 37384 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1986), rev'd and remanded, Manning v. Waring, Cox, James, Sklar & Allen, 849 F.2d 222, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 7830 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1988).\n\nThis section does not apply to action by parents of an emotionally disturbed child under Federal Education of All Handicapped Children Law for repayment of education expenses, because there is no tortious injury. Janzen v. Knox County Bd. of Education, 790 F.2d 484, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 24930 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1986).\n\nThis section is applicable to discrimination claims under § 4-21-311. Puckett v. Tennessee Eastman Co., 889 F.2d 1481, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 16584 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1989).\n\nPlaintiff's action alleging loss of a business relationship and financial backing which led to the closing of his business dealt with business and property losses, and were governed by the three-year statute of limitations of § 28-3-105, not this section. Collins v. Greene County Bank, 916 S.W.2d 941, 1995 Tenn. App. LEXIS 704 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995), appeal denied, 1996 Tenn. LEXIS 160 (Tenn. Feb. 26, 1996).\n\nThe one-year limitation of this section applied to an action alleging libel, invasion of privacy and a violation of the Personal Rights Protection Act. Gibbons v. Schwartz-Nobel, 928 S.W.2d 922, 1996 Tenn. App. LEXIS 57 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1996).\n\nTennessee's personal injury statute of limitations applies to plaintiff's federal civil rights claims. Craft v. Vanderbilt Univ., 18 F. Supp. 2d 786, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12952 (M.D. Tenn. 1998).\n\nAn employee's claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 was not subject to the one-year statute of limitations under T.C.A. § 28-3-104. Anthony v. BTR Auto. Sealing Sys., 339 F.3d 506, 2003 FED App. 278P, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 16264 (6th Cir. Tenn. 2003).\n\nWhere notice of a proposed zoning reclassification to allow a shooting range involved ten acres, but the adopted resolution stated ninety acres, the ordinance was void ab initio and the statute of limitations was no defense because: (1) The resolution qualified as a zoning amendment which required specific procedures; (2) The county legislative body had no jurisdiction to act on the proposed amendment since the alteration was so substantial that there should have been a resubmission of the proposed amendment to the planning commission; and (3) The record did not establish the requisite public or private reliance for an exception to the application of the void ab initio doctrine. Edwards v. Allen, 216 S.W.3d 278, 2007 Tenn. LEXIS 144 (Tenn. 2007).\n\nIn an appeal arising from a family dispute over a life estate, respondents properly pled the statute of limitations an affirmative defense in their answer to the amended petition. The trial court committed no reversible error in soliciting argument and then ruling on an issue properly pled. Stokely v. Stokely, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 23 (Tenn. Crim. App. Jan. 19, 2018).\n\nEven though appellant's contract with appellee was the basis for its retainage claim, the contract was not the basis for its claim for $ 300-per-day damages under the statute, which described its relief as a penalty; the Prompt Payment Act was the basis for appellant's claim, and thus the one-year statute of limitations period applicable to statutory penalties governed this claim. Snake Steel, Inc. v. Holladay Constr. Grp., LLC, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. App. LEXIS 23 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 22, 2020).\n\n4. —Miscellaneous Examples.\n\nThe statute of limitations barred action in the following case: Inmates, Washington County Jail v. England, 516 F. Supp. 132, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16683 (E.D. Tenn. 1980), aff'd without opinion, 659 F.2d 1081, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 13381 (6th Cir. 1981).\n\nTrial court erred in ruling that the statute of limitations had run in wrongful termination lawsuit filed on December 12, 1995 where defendant initially believed she was terminated November 23, 1994, but she was not actually terminated until December 13, 1994. Reed v. Alamo Rent-A-Car, Inc., 4 S.W.3d 677, 1999 Tenn. App. LEXIS 207 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1999).\n\nOn ex-husband's abuse of process claim against ex-wife arising out of contempt petition filed by ex-wife in state court, ex-husband's contention that initial issuance of process was parties' divorce decree and contempt petition was subsequent improper use of process, claim was time-barred because abuse of process claim was filed more than one year after filing of contempt petition; although Tennessee's Code does not prescribe limitations period for abuse of process claims or prescribe a catch-all period for torts, the most nearly analogous statute is T.C.A. § 28-3-104(a)(1), which provides a one-year limitations period for personal torts, and the Sixth Circuit determined that a Tennessee court would apply § 28-3-104(a)(1) to abuse of process claims. Law v. Law, 279 Fed. Appx. 386, — F.3d —, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 12038, 2008 FED App. 306N (6th Cir. May 29, 2008).\n\nT.C.A. § 28-3-104 barred tort claims including malicious prosecution because the conduct about which plaintiff complained, the taking of his deposition and the filing of a verified complaint against him, occurred well over a year prior to plaintiff's filing of the lawsuit. Lane v. Becker, 334 S.W.3d 756, 2010 Tenn. App. LEXIS 145 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 25, 2010), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2010 Tenn. LEXIS 1146 (Tenn. Nov. 24, 2010).\n\nCourt erred in dismissing a medical malpractice action where the original lawsuit was “commenced” for purposes of the savings statute, T.C.A. § 28-1-105, because, although it was filed outside the one-year statute of limitations in T.C.A. §§ 28-3-104 and 29-26-116, it was filed within one year of the order of voluntary nonsuit, and it was filed in the name of the proper party plaintiff under T.C.A. § 20-5-107. Howell v. Claiborne & Hughes Health Ctr., — S.W.3d —, 2010 Tenn. App. LEXIS 400 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 24, 2010), overruled in part, Myers v. AMISUB (SFH), Inc., 382 S.W.3d 300, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 735 (Tenn. Oct. 4, 2012).\n\nDefendants were not entitled to dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) of a breach of contract claim on statute of limitations grounds because the face of the complaint did not show that the suit was filed in violation of former T.C.A. § 28-3-104(a)(2) [now § 28-3-104(c)], or that the Tennessee statute was applicable here instead of the statute of limitations under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5525(a). Estate of Thouron v. Cecil Smith & Assocs., PC, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1129 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 3, 2013).\n\nArrestee's claims against a city and a group of its police officers for intentional infliction of emotional distress or outrageous conduct, false imprisonment, malicious harassment, and civil rights violations were barred by the applicable one-year statute of limitations as the arrestee ‘s claims accrued more than one year prior to the filing of the arrestee's complaint. Olivier v. City of Clarksville, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 564 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 17, 2017).\n\n5. —Constitutional Challenges.\n\nThis section did not apply to constitutional challenge of Homosexual Practices Act, because there is no statute of limitations on challenging an unconstitutional penal statute. Campbell v. Sundquist, 926 S.W.2d 250, 1996 Tenn. App. LEXIS 46 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1996).\n\n6. Jurisdiction.\n\nA judgment of a court dismissing a suit for want of jurisdiction does not conclude the plaintiff's right of action. Davis v. Parks, 151 Tenn. 321, 270 S.W. 444, 1924 Tenn. LEXIS 67 (1924).\n\n7. —Conflict of Laws.\n\nWhere automobile accident occurred in Tennessee, fact that defendant was a nonresident would not toll the statute of limitations and Tennessee statute of limitations was applicable in suit brought in Missouri. Young v. Hicks, 250 F.2d 80, 1957 U.S. App. LEXIS 4452 (8th Cir. Mo. 1957).\n\nThe commencement of a suit in North Carolina does not toll the running of the statute of limitations in this state. Sigler v. Youngblood Truck Lines, Inc., 149 F. Supp. 61, 1957 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3823 (D. Tenn. 1957).\n\nThe Tennessee statute of limitations was not applicable to actions brought pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Jackson v. Cutter Laboratories, Inc., 338 F. Supp. 882, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9791 (E.D. Tenn. 1970); Kennerly v. Aro, Inc., 447 F. Supp. 1083, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11604 (E.D. Tenn. 1976); Kennerly v. Aro, Inc., 447 F. Supp. 1090, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13769 (E.D. Tenn. 1977).\n\nBy providing for a 30-day period in which an aggrieved party could have brought an action [42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)], Congress intended to insert a limitation period for actions which should have been applied in lieu of a statute of limitations. Beckum v. Tennessee Hotel, 341 F. Supp. 991, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13422 (W.D. Tenn. 1971); Kennerly v. Aro, Inc., 447 F. Supp. 1083, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11604 (E.D. Tenn. 1976); Kennerly v. Aro, Inc., 447 F. Supp. 1090, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13769 (E.D. Tenn. 1977).\n\nThe Tennessee one year statute of limitations was not tolled as to actions under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1985(3). Harrison v. Wright, 457 F.2d 793, 1972 U.S. App. LEXIS 10327 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1972).\n\nThe Tennessee statute of limitations was applicable to actions filed under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983, but not to actions filed under Title VII, Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.Kaltenborn v. Excel Personnel, 339 F. Supp. 129, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15220 (W.D. Tenn. 1972); Kennerly v. Aro, Inc., 447 F. Supp. 1083, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11604 (E.D. Tenn. 1976); Kennerly v. Aro, Inc., 447 F. Supp. 1090, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13769 (E.D. Tenn. 1977).\n\nWhere, in a civil rights action, the court had the choice of applying this statute or the Georgia statute of limitations, it held that where a civil rights action arose in one state but was brought in another, a federal district court should apply statute of limitations of the state in which the action arose. Jones v. Bales, 58 F.R.D. 453, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12766 (D. Ga. 1972), aff'd, 480 F.2d 805, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 11519 (5th Cir. Ga. 1973).\n\nUnder Tennessee law a claim would be barred because Tennessee's one-year statute of limitations for personal injury cases, § 28-3-104, is not tolled under § 28-1-105 by the filing of the lawsuit in another state where there was no basis for personal jurisdiction. Graham v. Ferguson, 593 F.2d 764, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 16392 (6th Cir. Mich. 1979).\n\nRather than permitting application of the one year limitations period of subdivision (a)(3) of this section, 28 U.S.C. § 1658 mandated application of the four year federal statute of limitations to employee's racial discrimination claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1981. Miller v. Federal Express Corp., 56 F. Supp. 2d 955, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9618 (W.D. Tenn. 1999).\n\n8. —Declaration.\n\nThe declaration alleged the bringing of a former suit and its dismissal by nonsuit and the bringing of the present suit within 12 months thereafter, defendant's plea of one year statute of limitations was insufficient to put upon the plaintiff the burden of making proof to sustain his averments in the declaration. Holliston Mills of Tennessee v. McGuffin, 177 Tenn. 1, 145 S.W.2d 1, 1940 Tenn. LEXIS 4 (1940).\n\nTo determine whether suit is for tort or contract and therefore whether respective one or six year statute of limitations applies, court must look to plaintiff's declaration to see whether personal injuries are claimed regardless of how the action is styled and even though some contract damages are claimed. Bland v. Smith, 197 Tenn. 683, 277 S.W.2d 377, 1955 Tenn. LEXIS 335, 49 A.L.R.2d 1212 (1955).\n\n9. —Amendment.\n\nWhere receivers of a railroad company are not made parties until after the year, by amendment, the cause of action is barred as to them. Memphis & C. R. Co. v. Hoechner, 67 F. 456, 1895 U.S. App. LEXIS 2766 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1895).\n\nA party cannot, by way of amendment, change his right of action from contract to tort and obviate with respect to the latter the running of the statute of limitations. Gruver v. Cordes, 3 Tenn. Civ. App. (3 Higgins) 591 (1913).\n\nWhere the original declaration did not state a common law right, it was an imperfect declaration subject to amendment to make it perfect. Kennard v. Illinois C. R. Co., 177 Tenn. 311, 148 S.W.2d 1017, 1940 Tenn. LEXIS 40, 134 A.L.R. 770 (1941).\n\nAn amendment merely changing designation of defendant, under Tennessee law, for limitation purposes related back to the date of the original filing of the action. Smith v. Proctor & Gamble Mfg. Co., 33 F.R.D. 294, 1963 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10372 (D. Tenn. 1963).\n\nWhere the trial court did not have the benefit of the 1972 amendment at the time summary judgment was entered for defendant, the judgment was vacated and the case remanded for further consideration in light of this section as amended. Bradley v. General Motors Corp., 463 F.2d 239, 1972 U.S. App. LEXIS 9477 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1972); Bradley v. General Motors Corp., 512 F.2d 602, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 15801 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1975).\n\nThe contract which was entered into before the limitation in this section was amended from six years to one year was subject to the one year statute of limitations. Bradley v. La Penna, 490 S.W.2d 500, 1973 Tenn. LEXIS 518 (Tenn. 1973).\n\nA federal action is commenced as against additional party defendants named in an amended complaint as of the date of the filing of the amended complaint, rather than the date of the order granting leave to so amend. Cannon v. Metcalfe, 458 F. Supp. 843, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15065 (E.D. Tenn. 1977).\n\nAn amendment to a complaint in federal court which added a new party created a new cause of action and there was no relation back to the date of the filing of the original complaint for statute of limitation purposes. Jenkins v. Carruth, 583 F. Supp. 613, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17646 (E.D. Tenn. 1982), aff'd without opinion, 734 F.2d 14, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 14413 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1984).\n\nA party to be brought in by amendment, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c), must receive notice within the statute of limitations period, Schiavone v. Fortune, 477 U.S. 21, 29, 106 S. Ct. 2379, 2384, 91 L. Ed. 2d 18, 1986 U.S. LEXIS 106 (1986); however, the notice required by Schiavone does not need to be formal. Smith v. TW Services, Inc., 142 F.R.D. 144, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20693 (M.D. Tenn. 1991).\n\nNotice to a liability insurer provided the sole basis for Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c) notice to a new defendant, alleged tortfeasor, so that the plaintiff's amendment related back to the date of the original complaint. Smith v. TW Services, Inc., 142 F.R.D. 144, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20693 (M.D. Tenn. 1991).\n\nWhere shortly after an accident, the liability insurer of a defendant brought in by amendment became aware of the claim, and it received an “information copy” of the complaint with letter from plaintiff's counsel, based on the prolonged correspondence between plaintiff's counsel and defendant's liability insurer, including settlement requests, injury/medical updates and finally a copy of the complaint, the defendant received sufficient notice of the action that it would not be prejudiced in the maintenance of its defense. Smith v. TW Services, Inc., 142 F.R.D. 144, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20693 (M.D. Tenn. 1991).\n\nPlaintiff could not amend his complaint to identify John and Jane Doe officers because amendment would be futile, as his 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 excessive force and unreasonable seizure claims and his state law negligence, false imprisonment, and assault claims would not relate back to the date of the original complaint and thus, would be barred by Tennessee's one year period of limitations. Dunfee v. Finchum, — F. Supp. 2d —, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126052 (E.D. Tenn. Sept. 21, 2015).\n\n10. —Cause of Action.\n\nIn administrator's bill to renew a judgment formerly entered against respondent, the substitution of the distributees by naming them did not constitute a new cause of action. Delaney v. Delaney, 190 Tenn. 632, 231 S.W.2d 328, 1950 Tenn. LEXIS 530 (1950).\n\nWhere plaintiff knew of a causal relationship between products he worked with and his condition as far back as September of 1977, but chose in two earlier suits, and in present action, to pursue a remedy against only the makers of the finished products, and made no effort until 1980 or 1981 to locate the manufacturers and suppliers of any ingredient that went into the finished products, under these circumstances, plaintiff had sufficient knowledge, or should have had sufficient knowledge, that he could have had a cause of action against defendant suppliers long before he added them in 1981, and suit against such defendants was properly dismissed as barred by the statute of limitations. Webber v. Union Carbide Corp., 653 S.W.2d 409, 1983 Tenn. App. LEXIS 575 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1983).\n\n11. —Commencement of Action.\n\nThe suing out of a summons is the commencement of an action that interrupts the running of the statute. Whitson v. Tennessee C. R. Co., 163 Tenn. 35, 40 S.W.2d 396, 1930 Tenn. LEXIS 136 (1931).\n\nWhen the remedy of the suitor is complete and unaffected by the absence of the defendant, when his nonresidence does not affect the right to sue, the time of his residence out of the state shall not be taken as any part of the time limited for the commencement of the action. Arrowood v. McMinn County, 173 Tenn. 562, 121 S.W.2d 566, 1938 Tenn. LEXIS 43, 119 A.L.R. 855 (1938).\n\nWhere plaintiff filed his declaration and summons in the state court within the period of limitation, but the clerk of the court, through oversight, did not forward it to the secretary of state until after the limitation period had expired, the process and service were sufficient. Miller v. Baird, 239 F. Supp. 754, 1965 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7101 (E.D. Tenn. 1965).\n\nThe filing of a suit for personal injury and property damage arising out of an automobile collision does not toll the statutory limitations contained in this section as they apply to the defendant and a cross-declaration filed pursuant to § 20-1007 (repealed) must be filed within the statutory limitations contained herein. Lovejoy v. Ahearn, 223 Tenn. 562, 448 S.W.2d 420, 1969 Tenn. LEXIS 442 (1969).\n\nA suit for personal injuries may be brought more than one year after the injury occurs provided it is brought within one year after it is discovered or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been discovered. McCroskey v. Bryant Air Conditioning Co., 524 S.W.2d 487, 1975 Tenn. LEXIS 668 (Tenn. 1975).\n\nAttorneys whose only interest was that of an attorney representing a client did not become real parties in interest; the one-year statute of limitations was not tolled by the filing of the action against the client, and the action was commenced not by the proceedings against the client, but when the counsel was brought in as third-party defendants.

Daniel v. Cantrell, 241 F. Supp. 2d 867, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1185 (E.D. Tenn. 2003), aff'd, 375 F.3d 377, 2004 FED App. 216P, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 14078 (6th Cir. Tenn. 2004).\n\nIn clients' legal malpractice action, trial court erred in denying their former attorney's motion to dismiss because clients' intentional nine and one-half month delay in service of the summons after the filing of the complaint against their former attorney rendered the filing of the complaint ineffective pursuant to Tenn. R. Civ. P. 4.01(3). Jones v. Cox, 316 S.W.3d 616, 2008 Tenn. App. LEXIS 697 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 25, 2008), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2009 Tenn. LEXIS 282 (Tenn. June 1, 2009).\n\n12. —Ignorance of Cause of Action.\n\nMere ignorance or failure of plaintiff to discover his cause of action or the subsequent resulting damage cannot prevent the running of the statute.

LEXIS 13 (1931).\n\nThe mere failure of a plaintiff to discover the existence of a cause of action does not prevent the running of the statute. Clinard v. Pennington, 59 Tenn. App. 128, 438 S.W.2d 748, 1968 Tenn. App. LEXIS 336 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1968).\n\nThe relevant inquiry for determining the date of discovery is an objective one. Hughes v.

LEXIS 13 (1931).\n\nWhere there is a bare averment that plaintiff was kept in ignorance of the cause of action without averment that the concealment was fraudulent on part of defendant or that the cause of action was known to the latter, the court may not presume fraud in order to prevent a bar. Bodne v. Austin, 156 Tenn. 366, 2 S.W.2d 104, 1927 Tenn. LEXIS 129 (1928), overruled in part, Teeters v. Currey, 518 S.W.2d 512, 1974 Tenn. LEXIS 438, 93 A.L.R.3d 207 (Tenn. 1974).\n\nThere can be no fraudulent concealment where there is no dealing between the parties. Mere silence does not constitute it.

LEXIS 70 (1933).\n\nThe fact that a dentist should have known that he, in extracting a tooth, had left its root in his patient's mouth, did not constitute fraudulent concealment. Albert v.

LEXIS 498 (Tenn. 1997).\n\nFailure of officials, agents and representatives of railroad to disclose details of death of plaintiff's husband to plaintiff did not constitute fraudulent concealment of facts so as to prevent running of statute of limitations in action for damages against railroad for such death. Turner v. N. C. & S. L. Railway, 199 Tenn. 137, 285 S.W.2d 122, 1955 Tenn.

Union Carbide & Carbon Corp. v. Stapleton, 237 F.2d 229, 1956 U.S. App. LEXIS 4323, 69 A.L.R.2d 1206 (6th Cir.

Scheibert, 484 S.W.2d 63, 1972 Tenn. App. LEXIS 345 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1972).\n\nAllegations that defendant physician knowingly concealed injuries to plaintiff's spinal cord occurring during spinal operation for arthritic spur by representing that disability and paralysis resulted from contractions of muscles in plaintiff's back and continued to so represent during period plaintiff continued under treatment by defendant were sufficient allegations of fraudulent concealment to toll running of statute of limitations if proved. Ray v. Scheibert, 224 Tenn. 99, 450 S.W.2d 578, 1969 Tenn. LEXIS 380, 1969 Tenn. LEXIS 381 (1969).\n\nIn order for the statute of limitations to be tolled by a fraudulent concealment, there must be an allegation that the cause of action was known to defendant and fraudulently concealed by him, since mere ignorance by plaintiff and his failure to discover the cause of action is not sufficient to prevent the running of the statute. Ray v. Scheibert, 224 Tenn. 99, 450 S.W.2d 578, 1969 Tenn. LEXIS 380, 1969 Tenn. LEXIS 381 (1969).\n\nAn honest mistake made by physician in diagnosing the cause of a patient's infirmity, standing alone, was not evidence of fraudulent concealment; therefore the statute of limitations was not tolled. Ray v. Scheibert, 484 S.W.2d 63, 1972 Tenn. App. LEXIS 345 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1972).\n\nT.C.A. § 28-3-104 barred an alleged victim's negligent supervision claim against a diocese, based on the victim's alleged sexual abuse by a priest when the victim was a child, because the doctrine of fraudulent concealment, the discovery rule, and equitable estoppel did not toll the statute when the victim reached the age of majority, as, (1) when the victim reached the age of majority, the victim knew a priest of the diocese had abused the victim, that the victim had a claim against the priest, and that the diocese employed the priest, and (2) the abuse was the injury, not the diocese's alleged cover-up of the abuse. Redwing v. Catholic Bishop for the Diocese of Memphis, — S.W.3d —, 2010 Tenn. App. LEXIS 358 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 27, 2010), rev'd, 363 S.W.3d 436, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 143 (Tenn. Feb. 27, 2012).\n\nT.C.A. § 28-3-104 barred an alleged victim's negligent supervision claim against a diocese, based on the victim's alleged sexual abuse by a priest when the victim was a child, because the doctrine of fraudulent concealment, the discovery rule, and equitable estoppel did not toll the statute when the victim reached the age of majority, as, (1) when the victim reached the age of majority, the victim knew a priest of the diocese had abused the victim, that the victim had a claim against the priest, and that the diocese employed the priest, and (2) the abuse was the injury, not the diocese's alleged cover-up of the abuse.

Feb. 27, 2012).\n\nConstitutional claims in both the original action and the instant action were properly construed as Bivens claims and the claims against all of the deputized officers named in the original action were timely under T.C.A. § 28-3-104(a)(3) because the statute of limitations was tolled under the doctrine of fraudulent concealment. Moreover, the Tennessee Savings Statute, T.C.A. 28-1-105(a) “saved” the Bivens claims where the court interpreted the term “commence a new action” to include reasserting the cause of action, whether through an independent lawsuit or through reasserting the claims in the context of an existing action premised on the same underlying facts. Pike v. United States, 868 F. Supp. 2d 667, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51243 (M.D. Tenn. Apr. 11, 2012).\n\n15. —Absence of Defendant from State.\n\nThe limitation fixed by this section was not tolled by the absence of the defendant from the state where the defendant was a nonresident subject to service of process by service on the secretary of state under § 20-235 (now § 20-2-214). Burris v. Alexander Mfg. Co., 51 Misc. 2d 543, 273 N.Y.S.2d 542 (1966).\n\n16. —Pleading of Statute.\n\nThe plea of the statute of limitations is a special plea personal in its nature and which may be waived or asserted, and a party relying upon it affirmatively must set it up in his pleadings. Whittaker v. Monterey Spoke Co., 6 Tenn. Civ. App. (6 Higgins) 26 (1915).\n\nWhen issue is joined on defendant's plea of the statute of limitations, the burden is on plaintiff to prove that the cause of action accrued within the period of limitation. Brown v. Tennessee Consol. Coal Co., 19 Tenn. App. 123, 83 S.W.2d 568, 1935 Tenn. App. LEXIS 24 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1935).\n\n17. —Miscellaneous Actions.\n\nAction for damages for willful violation of plaintiff's right to the undisturbed possession and interment of the body of her deceased band is not barred by the one year statute.

LEXIS 127, 52 A.L.R. 1442 (1927).\n\nOne year statute of limitations did not apply to suit by bank receiver against stockholders of bank to recover loss to unsecured creditors and depositors. Robertson v. Davis, 169 Tenn. 659, 90 S.W.2d 746, 1935 Tenn. LEXIS 94 (1936).\n\nIn a suit by a receiver for compensation for his acts as receiver and for alleged damages suffered for failure of the complainant in the cause in which he was appointed to protect him at the time of the entry of the final decree the six year statute of limitations applicable to actions on contracts was controlling and not the one year statute governing actions in tort. Taylor v. Smith, 172 Tenn. 247, 111 S.W.2d 1020, 1937 Tenn. LEXIS 74 (1938).\n\nPlaintiff's action suing attorney for mishandling of divorce case claiming “not only loss of properties but … pain and mental anguish” was controlled by one year statute of limitations for personal actions rather than six year contract statute. Bland v. Smith, 197 Tenn. 683, 277 S.W.2d 377, 1955 Tenn. LEXIS 335, 49 A.L.R.2d 1212 (1955).\n\nAction by insured and wife against insurance carrier to recover for injuries sustained in automobile accident when their vehicle was struck by hit and run driver which was brought under uninsured motorist clause of policy was governed by six year limitation for actions on contract rather than one year limitation for personal tort actions. Schleif v. Hardware Dealer's Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 218 Tenn. 489, 404 S.W.2d 490, 1966 Tenn. LEXIS 582 (1966), superseded by statute as stated in, Gray v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., — S.W.2d —, 1989 Tenn. App. LEXIS 113 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 15, 1989).\n\nAn action by a client against his attorney for damages for failure to file his personal injury action prior to the running of the statute of limitations is not an action for personal injuries within the meaning of this section, but an action for breach of contract. Sitton v. Clements, 385 F.2d 869, 1967 U.S. App. LEXIS 4454 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1967), overruled, Shoemake v. Ferrer, 143 Wn. App. 819, 182 P.3d 992, 2008 Wash. App. LEXIS 776 (2008).\n\nWhere parents satisfied proof of financial responsibility for their minor son under 18 years of age pursuant to former § 55-7-104(c), and where son was later found liable for damages for bodily injuries to other parties, the statute of limitations applying to parents' liability sounds in tort under this section, and was not a contractual liability under § 28-3-109. Bankers Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Sampley, 304 F. Supp. 523, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9919 (E.D. Tenn. 1968), aff'd, 420 F.2d 300, 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 11375 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1970).\n\nIn products liability case, where two minors were killed, although the cause of action accrued at date of sale of product, the one year statute of limitations would not bar the suit, as the injuries resulted to minors, and the minors had they lived, would have had a cause of action. Rives v. International Oil Burner Co., 298 F. Supp. 1146, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9034 (E.D. Tenn. 1969).\n\nAs the statute of limitations on a libel action does not begin to run on a published book until the first copy is sold in the county where the action is brought or where the defamed individual lives, it was error to dismiss an action when book had been published over a year before commencement of action, but the date on which book was first sold in the plaintiff's county was not ascertainable. Applewhite v. Memphis State University, 495 S.W.2d 190, 1973 Tenn. LEXIS 487 (Tenn. 1973).\n\nWhere prisoner brought action for damages against judge who dismissed prisoner's post-conviction petition, the action was barred by the doctrine of judicial immunity and further by the one-year statute of limitations for injuries against the person.

Kelley v. Metropolitan County Bd. of Educ., 836 F.2d 986, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 16899 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1987), cert. denied, Metropolitan County Bd. of Educ. v. Tennessee, 487 U.S. 1206, 108 S. Ct. 2848, 101 L. Ed. 2d 885, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 2848 (1988).\n\n19. Suits Against the State.\n\nTennessee claims commission for the eastern grand properly held the inmate's claim against the state was barred by the statute of limitations because: (1) The inmate filed his claim against the state well beyond the one-year statute of limitations in T.C.A. §§ 9-8-402(b) and 28-3-104(a); and (2) The inmate had full knowledge of the facts relevant to his alleged injury when it occurred because he knew that he was being tried and sentenced in abstentia; thus, the commission did not err when it granted the state's motion to dismiss, Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12. Williams v. State, 139 S.W.3d 308, 2004 Tenn. App. LEXIS 43 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2004 Tenn. LEXIS 530 (Tenn. June 1, 2004), appeal denied, Williams v. Parker, — S.W.3d —, 2006 Tenn. LEXIS 9 (Tenn. 2006).\n\nClaims commission did not err in dismissing a family's claim against the state as time barred because the ninety day extension provided in T.C.A. § 20-1-119 was not triggered; the family originally only sued the county, which denied the allegations in the complaint and asserted that it could not have been liable for any of the injuries sustained by the family because that property was in control of the state, but the county failed to allege comparative fault in its answer, and the family had not asserted in its complaint against the county or before the commission that any comparative fault existed. Austin v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2006 Tenn. App. LEXIS 386 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 6, 2006), rev'd, 222 S.W.3d 354, 2007 Tenn. LEXIS 434 (Tenn. 2007).\n\n20. Action Against Court Clerk.\n\nThe one year statute of limitations this section began to run against landowner seeking interest from court clerk for money previously held by clerk as trustee when landowner received money from clerk without interest.

Personal Injuries.\n\nSuit for damages upon allegation that defendants had conspired to deprive plaintiff from occupying her home with her children and from being supported by her husband by counseling certain persons to place plaintiff in state mental hospital and by advising her husband to divorce her was suit for injury of a personal nature and was barred by the one year limitation for injuries to the person where filed more than one year after last act complained of.

Maxwell v. Roark, 337 F. Supp. 506, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10184 (E.D. Tenn. 1971).\n\nA suit for personal injuries may be brought more than one year after the injury occurs, provided it is brought within one year after it is discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence should have been discovered.

App. 1986).\n\nAn action against a bank for refusal to make payment on a check, where the gravamen of the action was mental anguish, humiliation, embarrassment, and damage to reputation, was one for personal injuries, and therefore the one-year limitation in this section applied, rather than the six-year limitation in § 28-3-109(a)(3). Pera v. Kroger Co., 674 S.W.2d 715, 1984 Tenn. LEXIS 828 (Tenn. 1984).\n\nNot all contract actions are subject to the six-year statute of limitations; they may be subject to a one-year period for personal injuries or a three-year period for property damage. Pera v. Kroger Co., 674 S.W.2d 715, 1984 Tenn. LEXIS 828 (Tenn. 1984).\n\nThe one-year statute of limitations for personal injury actions contained in this section applied to union member's action, pursuant to § 101(a)(5) of the labor-management reporting and disclosure act (29 U.S.C. § 411(a)(5), for discharge from the union without prior notice or hearing. Holmes v. Donovan, 984 F.2d 732, 1993 U.S. App. LEXIS 1030 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1993).\n\nIn a personal injury case, plaintiff's first amended complaint was devoid of any factual allegation which would estop defendants from asserting the statute of limitations defense or to support a claim of fraudulent concealment. Similarly, the allegations contained in plaintiff's second amended complaint were conclusory and inadequate to establish a basis upon which to prevent the raising of the statute of the limitations defense or to constitute fraudulent concealment of any cause of action against defendants. Bracey v. McDonald, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 25 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 13, 2016), review denied and ordered not published, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 370 (Tenn. May 9, 2016).\n\nIn a case arising from an automobile accident, damages should not have been awarded for personal injuries because an insurer's claim was not made until after the statute of limitations had run, and an appeal to the circuit court from the general sessions court did not extend the limitations period; in such an appeal, the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure did not expand the circuit court's jurisdiction. The savings statute did not permit the insurer to refile the previous action and rely upon the original filing of the lawsuit in order to add a claim for personal injuries. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Blondin, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 189 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 14, 2016).\n\n22. —Definitions.\n\n“For injuries” means on account of injuries to the person. Blackwell v. Memphis S. R. Co., 124 Tenn. 516, 137 S.W. 486, 1911 Tenn. LEXIS 60 (1911).\n\nActions “for injuries to the person,” as used in one year statute of limitations means actions for “bodily injuries.” Rheudasil v. Clower, 197 Tenn. 27, 270 S.W.2d 345, 1954 Tenn. LEXIS 447, 46 A.L.R.2d 1083 (1954), superseded by statute as stated in, Hanover v. Ruch, 809 S.W.2d 893, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 156 (Tenn. 1991).\n\nThis section did not apply to suit by divorced wife to recover from former husband her share of proceeds recovered by husband as administrator for minor child, since it was not a wrongful death suit, but an action to recover proceeds of settlement in a wrongful death suit. Shelton v. Shelton, 198 Tenn. 346, 280 S.W.2d 803, 1955 Tenn. LEXIS 379 (1955).\n\nDeclaration which in substantial part sought recovery for damages to plaintiff's reputation as a business man, father and respected member of society and for humiliation and the like, alleged damages to rights which were personal in nature and limitation of this section was applicable. Brown v. Dunstan, 219 Tenn. 291, 409 S.W.2d 365, 1966 Tenn. LEXIS 529 (1966).\n\nThe phrase “for injuries to the person” appearing in this section is not limited to bodily injuries resulting from trauma but includes injuries resulting from invasion of rights that inhere in man as a rational being, such rights, however, being distinguished from those which accrue to an individual by reason of some peculiar status or by virtue of an interest created by contract or property. Brown v. Dunstan, 219 Tenn. 291, 409 S.W.2d 365, 1966 Tenn. LEXIS 529 (1966).\n\nA suit for damages because of obliteration by land developer of burial plot in which plaintiff's ancestors were buried in which it was alleged that plaintiff suffered great mental pain and anguish and loss of property rights was a suit for injuries to the person within the meaning of this section. Carney v. Smith, 222 Tenn. 472, 437 S.W.2d 246, 1969 Tenn. LEXIS 454 (1969).\n\nFor the purpose of this section personal injury actions are defined as those brought for injuries resulting from invasion of rights, that is, rights to which one is entitled by reason of being a person in the eyes of the law and such rights are to be distinguished from those which accrue to an individual by reason of some peculiar status or by virtue of an interest created by contract or property. Swauger v. Haury & Smith Contractors, Inc., 512 S.W.2d 261, 1974 Tenn. LEXIS 477 (Tenn. 1974).\n\nThe application of any particular statute of limitations is governed by the gravamen of the action as determined on the basis of the claimed damages; and a suit for inconvenience and loss of enjoyment of a home resulting from faulty construction of a septic system was basically a suit for injury to property and was not barred after one year by this section, the applicable statute being the three-year statute (§ 28-3-105). Swauger v. Haury & Smith Contractors, Inc., 512 S.W.2d 261, 1974 Tenn. LEXIS 477 (Tenn. 1974).\n\n23. —Declaration.\n\nWhere there is no averment that the wrong was within the period allowed for action, the declaration cannot be sustained upon the theory that it is based upon recurrent injuries within the period. Bodne v. Austin, 156 Tenn. 353, 2 S.W.2d 100, 1927 Tenn. LEXIS 128, 62 A.L.R. 1410 (1928), superseded by statute as stated in, Stanbury v. Bacardi, 953 S.W.2d 671, 1997 Tenn. LEXIS 498 (Tenn. 1997).\n\nStatute governing form of notice to be given municipality requires only that the “general” nature of the injury be stated, thus indicating legislative intent not to require same exactitude in stating nature of injury as is required in stating time and place of injury. Maryville v. McConkey, 19 Tenn. App. 520, 90 S.W.2d 951, 1935 Tenn. App. LEXIS 63 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1935).\n\n24. —Amendment.\n\n25. — —Cause of Action.\n\nAmended declaration in death action based on law of foreign state did not change cause of action merely because amended complaint cited particular foreign statutes upon which plaintiff relied to sustain cause of action which original declaration did not cite. Parsons v. American Trust & Banking Co., 168 Tenn. 49, 73 S.W.2d 698, 1934 Tenn. LEXIS 19 (1934).\n\nIn action for wrongful death, an amendment to the declaration setting up doctor's bill and funeral expenses as items of damages, was not demurrable as barred by limitation, since they were but items incidental to the wrong already and seasonably pleaded. Caldwell v. Hodges, 18 Tenn. App. 355, 77 S.W.2d 817, 1934 Tenn. App. LEXIS 39 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1934).\n\nOriginal complaint which alleged that plaintiff's injuries were due to the negligence of defendant's employees in the use of a scaffold, stated no different cause of action as respects limitation than amended complaint filed more than one year after date of injury which stated that her injuries were due to the negligent manner in which the scaffold was constructed, because the two acts alleged were but different invasions of plaintiff's primary right and different breaches of the same duty, thus amended complaint did not introduce a new cause of action so as to be barred by this section. Blair v. Durham, 134 F.2d 729, 1943 U.S. App. LEXIS 3672 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1943), rehearing denied, 139 F.2d 260, 1943 U.S. App. LEXIS 2257 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1943).\n\n26. — —Parties.\n\nWhere the declaration in the widow's action for the wrongful death of her husband contains a count for common law negligence as against a railroad operating between two points in Tennessee, and another count for negligence under the Federal Employers' Liability Act as against a railroad engaged in interstate commerce, and amendment to the declaration allowing the widow to prosecute the suit in her capacity as the personal representative of her deceased husband, as well as in her individual capacity, does not introduce a new cause of action so as to be barred by the limitation of two years under the federal statute. Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Wulf, 226 U.S. 570, 33 S. Ct. 135, 57 L. Ed. 355, 1913 U.S. LEXIS 2265 (1913); Gray v. Kent, 5 Tenn. Civ. App. (5 Higgins) 519 (1914).\n\nIn a personal injury action, the court properly refused to permit plaintiff to amend his declaration and summons so as to make the action and summons run against a corporation as defendant instead of against the president and general manager of the corporation, where two years had elapsed since bringing the action, and the one year statute of limitations had run against the action. Abdallah v. Weil, 168 Tenn. 382, 79 S.W.2d 284, 1934 Tenn. LEXIS 69 (1935).\n\nWhere administrator brought suit for wrongful death of decedent in administrator's name for benefit of decedent's brothers and after the statutory period of one year had expired moved to amend the declaration by striking out the allegation that the suit was for the benefit of the brothers and inserting that it had been brought for the use and benefit of the living father and mother, deceased leaving no widow or children, this was not the commencement of a new suit so as to be barred by this section as the cause is that of the decedent and the suing out of the summons in the name of the administrator was the commencement of the action and the names of the beneficiaries may be set out by amendment. Townsend v. Nashville, C. & S. L. Ry., 170 Tenn. 239, 94 S.W.2d 384, 1936 Tenn. LEXIS 8 (1936).\n\nWhere suit by foreign administratrix against foreign power company and city to recover damages for death of deceased as result of defective insulated wire was dismissed when plaintiff took a nonsuit, a second suit filed within one year thereafter by domestic administratrix against power company was not barred by limitations even though city was not made a party defendant in second action. Privett v. West Tennessee Power & Light Co., 19 F. Supp. 812, 1937 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1738 (D. Tenn. 1937), aff'd, 103 F.2d 1021, 1939 U.S. App. LEXIS 3771 (6th Cir. 1939).\n\nIn action by father as next of kin for wrongful death of minor son father could amend complaint so as to include mother of deceased as party plaintiff and amendment would relate back to time of filing original action, since cause of action would not be changed by adding party plaintiff, and this was so even though suit by mother would have been barred by statute of limitations. Mosier v. Lucas, 30 Tenn. App. 498, 207 S.W.2d 1021, 1947 Tenn. App. LEXIS 107 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1947).\n\nOne year statute of limitations in this section does not bar decedent's parents as next of kin from amending summons where action for wrongful death of decedent was originally brought by the father as an administrator, the amendment relates back to the date of the original summons because no new cause of action or new parties are set out. Gogan v. Jones, 197 Tenn. 436, 273 S.W.2d 700, 1954 Tenn. LEXIS 505 (1954).\n\nA party to be brought in by amendment, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c), must receive notice within the statute of limitations period, Schiavone v. Fortune, 477 U.S. 21, 29, 106 S. Ct. 2379, 2384, 91 L. Ed. 2d 18, 1986 U.S. LEXIS 106 (1986); however, the notice required by Schiavone does not need to be formal. Smith v. TW Services, Inc., 142 F.R.D. 144, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20693 (M.D. Tenn. 1991).\n\nNotice to a liability insurer provided the sole basis for Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c) notice to a new defendant, alleged tortfeasor, so that the plaintiff's amendment related back to the date of the original complaint. Smith v. TW Services, Inc., 142 F.R.D. 144, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20693 (M.D. Tenn. 1991).\n\nWhere shortly after the accident, the liability insurer of a defendant brought in by amendment became aware of the claim, and it received an “information copy” of the complaint with letter from plaintiff's counsel, based on the prolonged correspondence between plaintiff's counsel and defendant's liability insurer, including settlement requests, injury/medical updates and finally a copy of the complaint, the defendant received sufficient notice of the action that it would not be prejudiced in the maintenance of its defense. Smith v. TW Services, Inc., 142 F.R.D. 144, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20693 (M.D. Tenn. 1991).\n\nAlthough defendants reasonably could be expected to have known of the instant suit, this alone is insufficient to impute to them knowledge of their future status as defendants. Others who were not named as defendants were aware of and even deposed in this case. Doe v. Sullivan County, 956 F.2d 545, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 1685 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 864, 113 S. Ct. 187, 121 L. Ed. 2d 131, 1992 U.S. LEXIS 5302 (1992).\n\nAs defendant-A was named in an amended personal injury complaint filed within the applicable statute of limitations under T.C.A. § 28-3-104, and as defendant-B was thereafter named in a second amended complaint within 90 days from the identification of it for comparative fault purposes under T.C.A. § 20-1-119, the claim against defendant-B was not time-barred; accordingly, it was error to grant summary judgment to defendant-B on that basis. Mills v. Fulmarque, Inc., — S.W.3d —, 2010 Tenn. App. LEXIS 793 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 23, 2010), rev'd, 360 S.W.3d 362, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 142 (Tenn. Feb. 24, 2012).\n\nCourt of appeals erred in affirming an order granting fraternity members' motion to dismiss vehicle owners' complaint on the ground that it was barred by the one-year statute of limitations, T.C.A. § 28-3-104, because “a person not a party to the suit,” for purposes of T.C.A. § 20-1-119, included any defendant previously dismissed pursuant to a written, non-final order under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.02; a named defendant ceases to be a “party to the suit,” for purposes of § 20-1-119, when the trial court issues an order, whether final or interlocutory, dismissing that defendant. Mann v. Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity, 380 S.W.3d 42, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 468 (Tenn. July 3, 2012).\n\nIn a personal injury action filed by plaintiff injured party against a deceased driver, a trial court properly denied plaintiff's Tenn. R. Civ. P. 15.03 motion to amend to add the personal representative as a defendant and dismissed the action because plaintiff failed to name the personal representative as a defendant, as required by T.C.A. § 20-5-103, before the expiration of the one-year statute of limitations in T.C.A. § 28-3-104. Vaughn v. Morton, 371 S.W.3d 116, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 201 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 28, 2012), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 435 (Tenn. June 19, 2012).\n\nTrial court erred in granting limited liability companies' (LLCs) motion to dismiss because a customer was permitted to add the formerly dismissed LLCs back into her lawsuit to recover for injuries she sustained when she slipped and fell at a grocery store; pursuant to the one-year statute of limitations, the action against the LLCs was still viable when the grocery store identified them as comparative tortfeasors, and the customer filed her second amended complaint within 90 days. Scales v. H.G. Hill Realty Co., LLC, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 56 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 30, 2018).\n\n27. —Conflicts of Law.\n\nWrongful death action filed in Tennessee though based on death in Florida was controlled by limitation period contained in this section as law of the forum applied. Cauley v. S. E. Massengill Co., 35 F. Supp. 371, 1940 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2540 (D. Tenn. 1940).\n\nWrongful death action filed in Tennessee against former resident of Mississippi to recover damages for death of decedent occurring in automobile accident in Mississippi was governed by one year limitation period of Tennessee instead of six year limitation period prevailing in Mississippi. McDaniel v. Mulvihill, 196 Tenn. 41, 263 S.W.2d 759, 1953 Tenn. LEXIS 404 (1953).\n\nIn action for violation of federally protected civil rights, since there is no applicable federal statute of limitations, state statute controls and requires dismissal of suit filed more than one year after plaintiff's alleged cause of action accrued. Phipps v. Armour, 335 F. Supp. 768, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10797 (E.D. Tenn. 1971).\n\n28. —Running of Statute.\n\nThe cause of action for a personal injury accrues at the time of the injury, and is the same whether brought by the party injured or by his personal representative. The statute begins to run from the moment of the injury, and is not suspended by the death of the injured party, nor during the time that intervenes after his death and before the qualification of his personal representative. The statute applies alike to instant death or to instance where injured person survives for a time. Fowlkes v. Nashville & D. R. Co., 56 Tenn. 829, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 211 (1872); Whaley v. Catlett, 103 Tenn. 347, 53 S.W. 131, 1899 Tenn. LEXIS 115 (1899).\n\nAction in the name of the administrator for the wrongful death of his intestate is effectively commenced, so as to prevent the running of the statute of limitations, though it does not mention the beneficiaries of the recovery. Love v. Southern R. Co., 108 Tenn. 104, 65 S.W. 475, 1901 Tenn. LEXIS 13, 55 L.R.A. 471 (1901).\n\nWhere plaintiff contracted tuberculosis from working in defendants poorly ventilated factory the tort was a continuous one and the statute of limitations did not begin to run until plaintiff had quit work. Goodall Co. v. Sartin, 141 F.2d 427, 1944 U.S. App. LEXIS 3691 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1944), cert. denied, 323 U.S. 709, 65 S. Ct. 34, 89 L. Ed. 571, 1944 U.S. LEXIS 350 (1944).\n\nWhere action for personal injuries arising out of automobile accident was commenced against nonresident in federal court in Tennessee within the one year period provided by this section and summons was returned that the defendant was no longer in the Tennessee district but could be found at a designated address in another state but nothing further was done until the second term of court thereafter when plaintiff obtained an order for “plures summons” and service in Tennessee more than 22 months after date of the injury, plaintiff's claim was barred by the limitation of this section since plaintiff could have availed himself of the provisions of §§ 20-2-203, 20-2-205 providing means of service on nonresident motorists. Hixon v. Highsmith, 147 F. Supp. 801, 1957 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4282 (D. Tenn. 1957).\n\nSuit for damages upon allegation that defendants had conspired to deprive plaintiff from occupying her home with her children and being supported by her husband by counseling certain persons to place her in a mental hospital and advising her husband to divorce her was of a personal nature and barred by this section where the last overt act alleged, the filing of the divorce suit, occurred more than a year prior to the filing of the suit for damages. Emerson v. Machamer, 221 Tenn. 739, 431 S.W.2d 283, 1968 Tenn. LEXIS 500 (1968).\n\nThe limitation in this statute begins to run from the date of the alleged wrongful act or from the date of sale of the equipment rather than from the date of damage or injury caused by such act or equipment. Hargraves v. Brackett Stripping Machine Co., 317 F. Supp. 676, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10281 (E.D. Tenn. 1970).\n\nWhere wife's claim for loss of consortium was filed one year from date of husband's injury instead of one year after husband's employer purchased the defective equipment which caused the injury, as this claim was derived from husband's personal injuries, the court held that to bar such suit would be against the public policy of Tennessee and the same limitation should apply to both claims. Manning v. Altec, Inc., 488 F.2d 127, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 6665 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1973).\n\nAlthough the amendment shortening this limitation on actions from six years to one year was given prospective application only, a malpractice action against an attorney which had accrued two years prior to the enactment of the amendment was properly dismissed for failure to commence the action within one year of the effective date of the amendment. Redmon v. Le Fevre, 503 S.W.2d 97, 1973 Tenn. LEXIS 432 (Tenn. 1973).\n\nWhere suit was not filed in a personal injury action until after the death of the defendant, at which time the period of limitation of action under this section had not expired, and subsequently, after the expiration of the period, the trial court ordered the personal representative as defendant, the court held that that order commenced the action within the meaning of Tenn. R. Civ. P. 3, but that the first provision of § 28-1-110 tolled the running of the statute for the same period of time after the appointment of the personal representative as the unexpired period existing at the time of death, up to six months, and that, therefore, the action was not barred by this section. Carpenter v. Johnson, 514 S.W.2d 868, 1974 Tenn. LEXIS 460 (Tenn. 1974).\n\nAction by patient and husband against physician and drug manufacturer alleging high blood pressure and heart damage from taking contraceptive pills was not barred by one year period of limitation where action was commenced within one year of time patient was first advised by another physician of causal relationship between pill and such symptoms even though more than a year had lapsed since patient had last taken such medication. Gilbert v. Jones, 523 S.W.2d 211, 1974 Tenn. App. LEXIS 120 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1974).\n\nIn action seeking to enforce oral agreement between automobile insurance carrier and person injured in automobile accident with respect to settlement for personal injuries and property damages where there was no allegation that plaintiff failed to file suit within period of limitation because of reliance of promise of insurance carrier to negotiate and no assertion of forbearance as consideration for failure to institute suit within statutory period, claim was barred by limitation of this section. Whitehead v. Davidson, 522 S.W.2d 865, 1975 Tenn. LEXIS 725 (Tenn. 1975).\n\nIn tort actions including but not restricted to products liability actions predicated on negligence, strict liability or misrepresentation, the cause of action accrues and the statute of limitations commences to run when the injury occurs or is discovered or when in the exercise of reasonable diligence it should have been discovered. McCroskey v. Bryant Air Conditioning Co., 524 S.W.2d 487, 1975 Tenn. LEXIS 668 (Tenn. 1975).\n\nA suit for personal injuries may be brought more than one year after the injury occurs, provided it is brought within one year after it is discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence should have been discovered. Gosnell v. Ashland Chemical, Inc., 674 S.W.2d 737, 1984 Tenn. App. LEXIS 2617 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1984).\n\nThe fact that the plaintiff wife was disabled mentally and physically from the date of the intentional tort by husband did not exclude her from the application of the pipeline approach in the application of Davis v. Davis, 657 S.W.2d 753, 1983 Tenn. LEXIS 723 (1983). Lazarov v. Lazarov, 731 S.W.2d 928, 1987 Tenn. App. LEXIS 2561 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1987).\n\nAn action for injuries allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos in the work place was not time barred where, even though plaintiffs had been notified by letter more than one year before the action was filed of the possibility that they had an asbestos — related disease, the statute of limitations did not begin to run until they received the results of follow-up testing which they had pursued diligently. Wyatt v. ACandS, Inc., 910 S.W.2d 851, 1995 Tenn. LEXIS 717 (Tenn. 1995).\n\nThe one-year limitation applicable to employees' claims against an employer based on allegations of outrageous conduct/intentional infliction of emotional distress was not tolled by the employees' filing of administrative charges against the employer. Scarborough v. Brown Group, 972 F. Supp. 1112, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12700 (W.D. Tenn. 1997).\n\nUnder the discovery rule, the determination of when the statute of limitations begins to run requires a determination of when the plaintiff had sufficient knowledge that she had sustained an injury. The inquiry does not require that the plaintiff had knowledge that a breach of the appropriate legal standard had occurred. McIntosh v. Blanton, 164 S.W.3d 584, 2004 Tenn. App. LEXIS 531 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2005 Tenn. LEXIS 74 (Tenn. Jan. 24, 2005).\n\nStatute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff is aware of the facts sufficient to put a reasonable person on notice that he has suffered an injury as a result of wrongful conduct, and the plaintiff knows the identity of the person who engaged in the conduct. The statute does not begin to run until the plaintiff had “sufficient information” to put him on notice that he has suffered an injury and that the injury was caused by a wrongful act. McIntosh v. Blanton, 164 S.W.3d 584, 2004 Tenn. App. LEXIS 531 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2005 Tenn. LEXIS 74 (Tenn. Jan. 24, 2005).\n\nWhile T.C.A. § 56-7-1206(d) allows a plaintiff to proceed directly against an uninsured motorist carrier under certain circumstances, even if the uninsured motorist is never successfully served with process, a plaintiff is still required to make a duly diligent effort to serve process on the uninsured motorist, and when that diligent effort is lacking and an unreasonable amount of time passes, a plaintiff can not use the uninsured motorist statute to avoid the requirements of Tenn. R. Civ. P. 3. Thus, where the insured failed to exercise due diligence to serve the tortfeasor, he could not use T.C.A. § 56-7-1206(d) to avoid the one-year requirement of Tenn. R. Civ. P. 3 when he later sued his uninsured motorist insurance carrier. Webb v. Werner, 163 S.W.3d 716, 2004 Tenn. App. LEXIS 703 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2005 Tenn. LEXIS 240 (Tenn. Mar. 7, 2005).\n\nClass action tolling doctrine was consistent with Tennessee law and the trial court erred in failing to invoke same as to the replacement workers' individual claims of breach of contract and interference with contract; the doctrine of laches did not prevent the replacement workers from maintaining their claims, in part, because they were not sleeping on their rights when they trusted the former class action plaintiffs to adequately represent their interests. Tigg v. Pirelli Tire Corp., — S.W.3d —, 2005 Tenn. App. LEXIS 812 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 22, 2005), rev'd, 232 S.W.3d 28, 2007 Tenn. LEXIS 641 (Tenn. Aug. 16, 2007).\n\nDoctor's state law claims of negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims were barred by T.C.A. § 28-3-104 and the medical malpractice claim was time-barred under T.C.A. § 29-26-116, because the doctor knew or should have known of defendant physician's allegedly actionable statements in a state court malpractice action against the doctor and the doctor failed to bring the current federal action against the physician and others within the applicable statute of limitations. Feild v. Graffagnino, 514 F. Supp. 2d 1036, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71052 (W.D. Tenn. Sept. 11, 2007).\n\nIn an action that arose from a fatal fire at an apartment complex, plaintiffs' claims against defendants were barred by applicable statutes of limitations where plaintiffs' counsel intentionally caused delay of prompt service of summons, which rendered the initial filing of the complaint ineffective. Estate of Butler v. Lamplighter Apts., 278 S.W.3d 321, 2008 Tenn. App. LEXIS 488 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 20, 2008).\n\nTrial court did not err in granting an uninsured motorist carrier summary judgment because an insured's claim against it was barred; because a driver, the alleged tortfeasor, died prior to the filing of the complaint, in order to comply with the Survival Statute, T.C.A. § 20-5-103(a), the insured was required to serve the driver's personal representative with process prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations, T.C.A. § 28-3-104(a)(1), but the insured failed to submit any evidence showing that an estate was ever established for the grinder. Liput v. Grinder, 405 S.W.3d 664, 2013 Tenn. App. LEXIS 136 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 27, 2013), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. LEXIS 615 (Tenn. July 11, 2013).\n\nTrial court did not err in granting an uninsured motorist carrier summary judgment because an insured's claim against it was barred since the insured failed to ever serve any personal representative for a driver's estate; pursuant to T.C.A. § 28-1-110, the one-year statute of limitations contained in T.C.A. § 28-3-104(a)(1) was tolled for the maximum allowance of six months from the date of the driver's death, but the insured did not obtain issuance of new process within one year of the original issuance as required by Tenn. R. Civ. P. 3 to maintain his claim. Liput v. Grinder, 405 S.W.3d 664, 2013 Tenn. App. LEXIS 136 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 27, 2013), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. LEXIS 615 (Tenn. July 11, 2013).\n\nInsureds did not comply with the rule because they failed to have any summons issued within one-year of filing the complaint; therefore, the insureds did not strictly comply with the rule and allowed their claim to lapse because the filing of their complaint was insufficient to toll the statute of limitations, and their claim against a driver was barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Davis v. Grange Mut. Cas. Grp., — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 646 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 28, 2017).\n\nFailure of a driver and her husband to comply with the survival statute by appropriately commencing their personal injury case until after the expiration of the statute of limitations barred their recovery because no new cause of action arose on the date they discovered the decedent's death that extended the statutory period for filing their claim simply on the ground that they failed to realize the decedent died until that date. Putnam v. Leach, 572 S.W.3d 605, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 22 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 23, 2018), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. LEXIS 281 (Tenn. May 17, 2018).\n\nTrial court properly granted the motion to dismiss filed by an administrator ad litem because a driver and her husband did not commence their lawsuit within the time afforded by the one-year statute of limitations; the discovery rule was not applicable to delay the commencement of the statute of limitations until the date when the driver and husband determined the decedent passed away because they were aware of the nature and cause of the driver's injuries on the date of the accident. Putnam v. Leach, 572 S.W.3d 605, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 22 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 23, 2018), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. LEXIS 281 (Tenn. May 17, 2018).\n\nWhen a decedent died the survival statute paused the statute of limitations, and because no personal representative was appointed during the six month period following his death, the statute of limitations recommenced; because the statute of limitations period ran before a driver and her husband filed their action against the administrator ad litem, the statute of limitations barred their personal injury claims. Putnam v. Leach, 572 S.W.3d 605, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 22 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 23, 2018), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. LEXIS 281 (Tenn. May 17, 2018).\n\nCircuit court properly denied a motion filed by an injured driver and his wife (the plaintiffs) to enlarge the time frame for obtaining new service of process of the defendant driver, and dismissed their automobile negligence suit because they failed to timely serve the defendant with process, acknowledged that their counsel's failure to investigate the lack of personal service sooner was negligent, and failed to follow up with the process server or the trial court clerk to determine whether they needed to effectuate alias service despite having almost 10 months to do so. Webster v. Isaacs, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 404 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 21, 2019).\n\nTrial court did not err by finding that this section was applicable to extend the statute of limitations for plaintiff?s personal injury action to two years due to defendant?s traffic citation for failure to exercise due care, and therefore the trial court did not err by denying defendant?s motion for summary judgment, because the traffic citation issued to defendant, which had been prepared, accepted, and the original citation filed with the court, was a criminal charge and a criminal prosecution by a law enforcement officer. Younger v. Okbahhanes, — S.W.3d —, 2021 Tenn. App. LEXIS 33 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2021).\n\n29. — —Disabilities.\n\nThe statute of limitations does not run against married women during the disability of coverture, but this does not disqualify her from suing to recover damages for personal injury before the removal of the disqualification if she joins her husband as a nominal plaintiff. Rink v. Campbell, 70 F. 664, 1895 U.S. App. LEXIS 2539 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1895) (decision prior to enactment of Married Women's Act).\n\nAs the statutes saving the right of recovery for the personal injuries of a decedent to his widow, children, next of kin, and personal representatives, do not create a new and independent cause of action for them, but merely preserve the right that accrued to the decedent for their benefit, the statute of limitations that began to run against the decedent continues to run against those who succeed to his rights, notwithstanding their disabilities, and bars the action, unless it is brought within one year after the injury was done. Whaley v. Catlett, 103 Tenn. 347, 53 S.W. 131, 1899 Tenn. LEXIS 115 (1899); Love v. Southern R. Co., 108 Tenn. 104, 65 S.W. 475, 1901 Tenn. LEXIS 13, 55 L.R.A. 471 (1901); Davidson Benedict Co. v. Severson, 109 Tenn. 572, 72 S.W. 967, 1902 Tenn. LEXIS 95 (1903), overruled, Jordan v. Baptist Three Rivers Hosp., 984 S.W.2d 593, 1999 Tenn. LEXIS 43 (Tenn. 1999); Smith v. Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co., 136 Tenn. 282, 189 S.W. 367, 1916 Tenn. LEXIS 129 (1916).\n\nPlaintiff-students were unable to take advantage of § 28-1-106 in a suit against a teacher for sexual abuse and resulting emotional harm where they did not repress the memory of the incidents and remained aware of their injuries and the wrongfulness of defendant's conduct. Rather than being incapable of protecting their rights, they consciously chose not to pursue the matter to avoid embarrassment; therefore, their reluctance to come forward could not postpone the commencement of the running of either subdivision (a)(1) or § 29-20-305(b). Jane Doe A v. Coffee County Bd. of Educ., 852 S.W.2d 899, 1992 Tenn. App. LEXIS 1019 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1992).\n\nWhere plaintiff's anxiety and depression were not shown to render her of unsound mind and she was aware of facts sufficient to put her on notice that she suffered an injury, her claims were barred by the one-year statute of limitations and were not tolled. Jacobs v. Baylor Sch., 957 F. Supp. 1002, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20704 (E.D. Tenn. 1996).\n\nDisability benefits claimant's negligence claim against an insurer and an Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 plan administrator was barred by the one-year statute of limitations of T.C.A. § 28-3-104(a)(1) because even though the claimant should have discovered her injury on January 8, 2003, the date of the misstatement to a doctor's nurse and the same date the doctor refused to write her a prescription for pain medication, she did not file her complaint until more than one year after the alleged misstatement. Newman-Waters v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Tenn., Inc., — F. Supp. 2d —, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27394 (E.D. Tenn. May 27, 2005).\n\nIn answer to certified questions, the supreme court of Tennessee held that the tolling provision of Tennessee's legal disability statute remains in effect as to plaintiffs of unsound mind for so long as they remain of unsound mind regardless of the appointment of a legal guardian and/or the commencement of a lawsuit by a representative on behalf of the disabled plaintiff; the discovery rule is inapplicable to plaintiffs of unsound mind for so long as they remain of unsound mind. Abels v. Genie Indus., 202 S.W.3d 99, 2006 Tenn. LEXIS 836 (Tenn. 2006).\n\nPlain language of Tennessee's legal disability statute tolls the running of the statute of limitations while the claimant is either under the age of eighteen years, or of unsound mind; the disability of unsound mind is removed when the individual is no longer of unsound mind, due either to a change in the individual's condition or the individual's death and the statute contains no language which would lead the supreme court of Tennessee to conclude that the legislature intended for removal of either of these two disabilities upon appointment of a guardian. Abels v. Genie Indus., 202 S.W.3d 99, 2006 Tenn. LEXIS 836 (Tenn. 2006).\n\nThe statute of limitations, T.C.A. § 28-3-104, is tolled for purposes of T.C.A. § 28-1-106, the tolling statute, for so long as the person to whom the claim belongs is under a disability because of age or unsound mind. Sullivan v. Chattanooga Med. Investors, 221 S.W.3d 506, 2007 Tenn. LEXIS 361 (Tenn. Apr. 24, 2007).\n\nCourt of appeals did not err in reversing the decision of the trial court that found that a deceased nursing home resident's negligence claims against the home were barred by the statute of limitations; the deceased was mentally incapacitated while being a resident at the home, and therefore T.C.A. § 28-3-104(a)(1), the statute of limitations on the negligence claims, remained tolled by T.C.A. § 28-1-106 until the resident's disability was removed by the resident's death, and the tolling was uninterrupted by the existence of a durable power of attorney in the resident's representative. Sullivan v. Chattanooga Med. Investors, 221 S.W.3d 506, 2007 Tenn. LEXIS 361 (Tenn. Apr. 24, 2007).\n\nGrant of summary judgment in favor of the physician in a medical-malpractice action was inappropriate because there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the patient was of unsound mind on the date the cause of action accrued, thus tolling the limitations period. Sherrill v. Souder, 325 S.W.3d 584, 2010 Tenn. LEXIS 988 (Tenn. Oct. 28, 2010).\n\n30. — —Accrual of Action.\n\nThis Tennessee statute of limitations does not in express terms apply to wrongful death actions instituted under § 20-5-106, but has been construed by the Tennessee Supreme Court to restrict them to one year from the date the decedent was injured. Fowlkes v. Nashville & D. R. Co., 56 Tenn. 829, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 211 (1872); Wilson v. Massengill, 124 F.2d 666, 1942 U.S. App. LEXIS 4550 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1942), cert. denied, 316 U.S. 686, 62 S. Ct. 1274, 86 L. Ed. 1758, 1942 U.S. LEXIS 572 (1942).\n\nWhere the plaintiff's effort is to base his cause of action on alleged consequential damages, by an allegation that he suffered no damages until a year and nine months after the alleged negligent operation by the defendant dentist, the statute began to run from the time of the original injury. Albert v. Sherman, 167 Tenn. 133, 67 S.W.2d 140, 1933 Tenn. LEXIS 17 (1934), overruled in part, Teeters v. Currey, 518 S.W.2d 512, 1974 Tenn. LEXIS 438, 93 A.L.R.3d 207 (Tenn. 1974), superseded by statute as stated in, Stanbury v. Bacardi, 953 S.W.2d 671, 1997 Tenn. LEXIS 498 (Tenn. 1997).\n\nFiling of declaration more than one year after accrual of death action did not suspend limitation period where summons was issued within one year period even though Private Acts 1917, ch. 30 stated that in counties with population of more than 150,000 the declaration should be filed upon suing out of summons, since private act could not suspend the general law of the state. Parsons v. American Trust & Banking Co., 168 Tenn. 49, 73 S.W.2d 698, 1934 Tenn. LEXIS 19 (1934).\n\nAs against an action for personal injuries, the statute of limitations begins to run from the date of the injury complained of. Brown v. Tennessee Consol. Coal Co., 19 Tenn. App. 123, 83 S.W.2d 568, 1935 Tenn. App. LEXIS 24 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1935).\n\nOne year statute of limitations for personal actions began to run on action for alleged negligent handling of divorce suit by attorney when final decree was handed down rather than on final payment of fees. Bland v. Smith, 197 Tenn. 683, 277 S.W.2d 377, 1955 Tenn. LEXIS 335, 49 A.L.R.2d 1212 (1955).\n\nIn action for personal injuries by employee against employer based on alleged negligence of employer to disclose fact that employee had active tuberculosis after physical examination in employer's medical department revealed such fact, the statute of limitation commenced to run from the date that employee left employment and not from the time of the physical examination since duty of employer to exercise ordinary care to inform employee of his condition continued throughout the period of employer-employee relationship. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp. v. Stapleton, 237 F.2d 229, 1956 U.S. App. LEXIS 4323, 69 A.L.R.2d 1206 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1956).\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of ch. 3, part 2 of this title that actions for injuries as a result of defective improvements of real estate shall be brought within four years after substantial completion of the improvement, one who suffers personal injuries as a result of such defective improvement may bring suit within one year after the date of injury. Leyen v. Dunn, 62 Tenn. App. 239, 461 S.W.2d 41, 1970 Tenn. App. LEXIS 264 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1970).\n\nWhere plaintiff had no previous contact with the building constructed by defendant three years prior to plaintiff's injury, plaintiff's claim was of a consequential nature and the statute of limitations did not begin to run until the time of plaintiff's injury. Vason v. Nickey, 438 F.2d 242, 1971 U.S. App. LEXIS 11851 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1971).\n\nIn action for tortious misrepresentation and negligence the cause of action accrues and the statute of limitations commences to run when the injury occurs or is discovered or when in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, it should have been discovered. Curtis v. Murphy Elevator Co., 407 F. Supp. 940, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17216 (E.D. Tenn. 1976).\n\nThe accrual date is generally defined as the date when the injury occurs or the date when the injury should have been discovered by a reasonable person. Huggins v. Fulton, 505 F. Supp. 7, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15875 (M.D. Tenn. 1980).\n\nWhereas a plaintiff who is fired cannot exercise control over the triggering act or accrual date but must instead count the injury from the date of the employer's action terminating him, the plaintiff who submits his resignation thereby defines his own accrual date, and an employer who accepts the terms of the resignation is estopped to assert an earlier date. Huggins v. Fulton, 505 F. Supp. 7, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15875 (M.D. Tenn. 1980).\n\nThe discovery rule applies only in cases where the plaintiff does not discover and reasonably could not be expected to discover that he has a right of action; it does not permit a plaintiff to wait until he knows all of the injurious effects or consequences of a tortious act. The statute is tolled only during the period when the plaintiff has no knowledge at all that a wrong has occurred, and, as a reasonable person, is not put on inquiry. Woods v. Sherwin-Williams Co., 666 S.W.2d 77, 1983 Tenn. App. LEXIS 666 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1983).\n\nWhen allegations of discrimination involve a termination from employment, the critical date is the date of termination; the existence of a grievance procedure does not change the importance of this date. Kessler v. Board of Regents, 738 F.2d 751, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 20625 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1984).\n\nIn federal civil rights action applying the one year statute of limitation of subsection (a), the cause of action accrued when plaintiff knew of his injury and its connection to the defendants at the time of the alleged assault, despite plaintiff's lack of knowledge of the names of the individuals who allegedly assaulted him. Richmond v. McElyea, 130 F.R.D. 377, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7782 (E.D. Tenn. 1990).\n\nWhere dry-cleaning company employee who purchased chemicals for the company became ill from his exposure to chemicals in his work place, his knowledge of his illness and the causal connection between the illness and his exposure to the chemicals involved put him on inquiry as to the manufacturers and suppliers who were the source of the chemicals; and where wife of employee filed wrongful death action more than one year after employee had knowledge of the causal connection, suit was barred. Craig v. R.R. Street & Co., 794 S.W.2d 351, 1990 Tenn. App. LEXIS 12 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1990).\n\nWhere plaintiff's decedent was the victim of a continuing tort that resulted in a latent, “creeping” disease, the statute of limitations did not begin to run until such a condition was discovered, or until it reasonably could have been discovered, by the injured party. Potts v. Celotex Corp., 796 S.W.2d 678, 1990 Tenn. LEXIS 318 (Tenn. 1990).\n\nAn earlier manifestation of an asbestos-related disease (asbestosis) did not trigger the running of Tennessee's one-year statute of limitations on a separate, distinct, and later-manifested disease (mesothelioma) that was also caused by exposure to asbestos. A cause of action for a separate and distinct asbestos-related disease does not accrue, under this section, until that disease becomes manifest. Potts v. Celotex Corp., 796 S.W.2d 678, 1990 Tenn. LEXIS 318 (Tenn. 1990).\n\nPlaintiff cardholder knew or was put on notice that he had a claim against defendant bank relative to its handling of his credit card dispute on date when he was first denied credit due to the bank's credit report, and thus the one-year statute of limitations began to run on that date. Yater v. Wachovia Bank, 861 S.W.2d 369, 1993 Tenn. App. LEXIS 359 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1993).\n\nThe doctrine of continuing tort did not apply to claims for assault, battery, and false imprisonment. Seaton v. Seaton, 971 F. Supp. 1188, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12566 (E.D. Tenn. 1997).\n\nPersonal tort claims brought by residents near an atomic weapons facility were barred by the one-year statute of limitations, T.C.A. § 28-3-104(a)(1), (3), since the residents should have known of their causes of action based upon newspaper publicity. Ball v. Union Carbide Corp., 212 F.R.D. 380, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25288 (E.D. Tenn. 2002), aff'd, 376 F.3d 554, 2004 FED App. 229P, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 14572 (6th Cir. Tenn. 2004), aff'd, 385 F.3d 713, 2004 FED App. 334A, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 20540 (6th Cir. Tenn. 2004).\n\nClient's legal malpractice action accrued at the latest in June 1997 when, upon signing the settlement statement on that date, the client knew or should have known that the client was not going to get any further payments out of the settlement with her former husband's estate; that realization contained two elements: (1) Knowledge that the client's attorney had not recovered all he allegedly said he would from the estate; and (2) Knowledge that the client had been harmed by the attorney's alleged failure. Swett v. Binkley, 104 S.W.3d 64, 2002 Tenn. App. LEXIS 819 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2002), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2003 Tenn. LEXIS 286 (Tenn. Mar. 17, 2003).\n\nDistrict court properly granted summary judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 in favor of the government and certain private contractors in an action by two groups of plaintiffs alleging personal injuries and civil rights claims arising from the operation of the nuclear weapons manufacturing and research facilities that the government established in the Oak Ridge Reservation, Tennessee, as part of the Manhattan Project in 1942; the one-year statute of limitations under T.C.A. § 28-3-104(a)(1) and (3) had run on plaintiffs' claims because extensive news coverage of a government study gave plaintiffs' constructive notice of potential claims; further, the equal protection and due process clauses of U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV did not afford the relief sought by plaintiffs under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, because the contractors had no affirmative duty to eliminate the current effects of past discrimination by governmental entities and there was no allegation that the contractors initiated the segregation in the 1940's. Ball v. Union Carbide Corp., 376 F.3d 554, 2004 FED App. 229P, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 14572 (6th Cir. Tenn. 2004).\n\nDistrict court properly granted defendants, the government and private contractors, summary judgment on the residents' personal injury claims, because they were barred by the one-year statute of limitations. The public record was sufficient to alert the residents as to a possible connection between emissions from the nuclear weapons facilities and health risks; the residents should have been aware of a potential personal injury claim when a steering panel's preliminary reports on the emissions became available; the statute of limitations also applied to the residents' civil rights claims, because they did not seek to eliminate the vestige of past discrimination by asking for desegregation of part of the town surrounding the facilities because they were seeking remedies for potential personal injuries and property damage. Ball v. Union Carbide Corp., 385 F.3d 713, 2004 FED App. 334A, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 20540 (6th Cir. Tenn. 2004).\n\nHusband and wife were placed on notice at the time of the accident that they could file an action against the company that improperly stacked the sheetrock at the time the incident occurred, because they knew that the injury was likely caused by the improper stacking of the sheetrock; thus, dismissal under T.C.A. § 28-3-104 was proper. Schultz v. Davis, 495 F.3d 289, 2007 FED App. 277P, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 17436 (6th Cir. July 23, 2007).\n\nDistrict court did not err in rejecting plaintiff's arguments that accrual of his due process cause of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, based on juvenile court proceedings in which he was falsely accused of child sexual abuse, was delayed or extended pursuant to the continuing violation doctrine or the rule of Heck v. Humphrey; therefore, his complaint was time barred under T.C.A. 28-3-104(a)(3). Eidson v. Tenn. Dep't of Children's Servs., 510 F.3d 631, 2007 FED App. 497P, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 29400 (6th Cir. Dec. 20, 2007).\n\nBecause a patient's deposition testimony regarding her March 20, 2002 conversation with a hospital patient advocate was unrefuted by the patient's later affidavit and showed that, by not later than March 20, 2002, the patient was aware of facts sufficient to put a reasonable person on notice of an injury resulting from another's wrongful conduct, the medical malpractice suit filed on April 14, 2003 was untimely and was barred by the statute of limitations. Sampson v. Wellmont Health Sys., 228 S.W.3d 124, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 62 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 31, 2007), appeal denied, Sampson v. Wellmont Health Ctr., — S.W.3d —, 2007 Tenn. LEXIS 547 (Tenn. June 18, 2007).\n\nAlthough knowledge of misconduct on the part of one defendant does not automatically result in a finding of inquiry notice of claims against a potential co-defendant, a plaintiff should be charged with inquiry notice of what an investigation of the potential co-defendant would have revealed where potential co-defendants are closely connected, as with an employer/employee relationship; therefore, a motion to dismiss should have been granted in a case based on sexual abuse perpetrated by a priest because the action was time-barred under T.C.A. § 28-3-104 since a congregant could have learned when he reached the age of majority that he had a right of action against a diocese for negligent supervision and retention, and equitable estoppel, fraudulent concealment, and discovery rule did not operate to toll the limitations period. Doe v. Catholic Bishop for the Diocese of Memphis, 306 S.W.3d 712, 2008 Tenn. App. LEXIS 527 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 16, 2008), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2009 Tenn. LEXIS 144 (Tenn. Mar. 16, 2009).\n\nDismissal of the passenger's action against the vehicle owner's son after she was injured while riding in a vehicle being driven by the driver was proper because the passenger's claims were barred by the one-year statute of limitations under T.C.A. § 28-3-104(a)(1). The passenger knew, or reasonably should have known, no later than April 7, 2006, that it was the son, and not the father, who loaned the driver the vehicle; the passenger did not amend her complaint to add the son as a defendant until June 9, 2008, over two years later. Strine v. Walton, 323 S.W.3d 480, 2010 Tenn. App. LEXIS 268 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 15, 2010), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2010 Tenn. LEXIS 768 (Tenn. Aug. 25, 2010).\n\nIn a personal injury and products liability case in which the injured party and his spouse sued the makers of a tree/deer stand, and the makers moved for summary judgment, the complaint was untimely under the one-year limitation period in T.C.A. §§ 28-3-104 and 29-28-103. The accrual period was when the injury was discovered, not when the injured party and his spouse discovered who the makers were, and they failed in their duty through the exercise of reasonable care and due diligence to discover who the makers were. Willis v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 819 F. Supp. 2d 700, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110292 (M.D. Tenn. Sept. 26, 2011).\n\n31. — —Third Party Defendants.\n\nThe statute does not begin to run as to third party defendants until the effective filing of the principal action against the third party plaintiffs.
