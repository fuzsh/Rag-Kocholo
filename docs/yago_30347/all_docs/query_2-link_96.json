        "text": "General Hospital (GH) spoilers reveal that Blair Cramer (Kassie DePaiva) has an affair with David Vickers (Tuc Watkins). Fans are upset over this shocking storyline.\n\nThey don’t understand how she could hurt her own aunt and Martin Grey (Michael E. Knight). It’s any wonder how Blair will bounce back from this betrayal. Could she really be this heartless? Keep reading to learn more.\n\nGH Spoilers: Blair Cramer Slept With David Vickers\n\nThe General Hospital spoilers are unsettling. Fans learned that Blair had a fling with David, who is very much married. Fans took to the SoapCentral.com Message Boards to react. The user KingGemini87 posted: “Blair messed around with David Vickers? Seriously? Blair had an affair with Dorian’s man? How can she do that to her aunt and Martin? And more importantly Todd?”\n\nThe GH fans took to the thread to react. Most are them are disgusted and in disbelief over this storyline. They didn’t expect Blair to go there. Some believe that it’ll be hard for the character to be redeemed after this.\n\n“Gross! I can’t believe Blair would do such a thing!” one fan wrote. “Yeah, my jaw hit the ground!!! DAVID VICKERS?!?!! Weren’t David Vickers and Dorian together at the end of OLTL?!?!!” another asked. During the time when One Life to Live aired on ABC, David was married to Dorian Cramer (Robin Strasser).\n\nThe couple was still together when the show ended on January 13, 2012. However, they were not together when the daytime soap moved to Prospect Park. The General Hospital spoilers seemingly hint that Blair would never go there with David. Some fans claim that the writing is off the wall.\n\n“I don’t think so. Someone on the writing staff didn’t do enough research! Blair would not sleep with David in a million years,” one fan argued.\n\nGeneral Hospital Spoilers: New Drama More Interesting Than Mob?\n\nThe General Hospital spoilers also suggest that this new storyline is more interesting than the mob. It shows how the storyline can get intertwined with the residents of Llanview on One Life to Live. Most fans are looking forward to seeing how this storyline will develop. They would love to see the truth behind the affair rumors.\n\n“Just proves that even off the air OLTL and its tangled web of characters are still more interesting than PC, Sonny, and the mob,” one fan suggested. “You can say that again! I detest Blair and I would rather see than this Sonny,” another user responded.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you believe that Blair would be this heartless and have an affair with David? Do you like this new storyline? Sound off below in the comment section."
