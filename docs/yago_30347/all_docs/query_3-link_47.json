Introduction\n\nThe effect of human activity on observed changes to the climate system over recent decades is widely acknowledged and is a global cause for concern. Anthropogenic (man-made) climate change has led to a rise in annual global mean temperatures since pre-industrial times, with more rapid increases since the mid-1900s [1]. As well as changing weather patterns, increasing average temperatures and, potentially of more concern, is the increase in the frequency of extreme weather events which can have enormous human cost [2]. Climate change is seen as an example of a tragedy of the Commons [3], whereby it is in the interests of individuals to benefit from human activity but the overall impact on all people collectively will be negative unless there is an agreed intervention. It is generally the case that the largest impacts on health are realised in developing regions of the world such as the tropics, whereas the greatest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions are often developed countries which do not suffer the consequences of extreme events to the same extent [4]. Due to the lifetime of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and the timescales associated with ocean warming, even if global CO2 emissions were curtailed immediately, the effects on the earth’s climate, including increasing temperatures and sea level rise would continue for a number of decades before starting to plateau [2]. However, this should be seen as a general call to action to reduce emissions as soon as possible, given that the impacts are likely to extend beyond current conditions and there are indications that economic investment now will be likely to reduce costs later [5]. There is also a need to develop adaptations to cope with changes in climate. Recent research highlighting the health benefits of limiting future temperature rises to the more ambitious target of 1.5 °C rather than 2 °C, in line with the Paris agreement of 2016, further emphasises the need to limit emissions [6].\n\nClimate change affects health in a number of ways, and the impacts vary both geographically and between different populations. A growing and ageing population in much of the world means that the proportion of the population who are vulnerable to the effects of climate change will increase in the future [7]. The most direct impacts from climate change are from the effects of high temperatures, and from acute impacts relating to extreme events such as storms, floods and heatwaves. These physical or meteorological stressors can produce direct health effects, such as physical injury, illness, or mental health impacts due to the consequences of the aftermath. In places where infrastructure or adaptation measures are poor, the impacts will be more severe [2]. In addition to these types of impact on health, climate change is likely to modify or mediate existing health effects and exacerbate inequalities through a number of indirect pathways. These more indirect effects on health occur through climate interactions with ecosystems, water, biodiversity and land use changes. Climate change can lead to environmental degradation; can affect food and water availability and quality; and increase risks to health from pathogens, vectors and infectious diseases [8]. Civil conflict or mass movement of people may be partly driven by environmental degradation and can further increase risks to health. There is evidence to suggest that climate change can be a driver for civil war [9,10].\n\nWaterborne and water-related diseases are sensitive to environmental conditions, some or all of which are likely to be affected by climate change. For example, climate change is likely to lead to changes in the frequency of heavy rainfall events, storms and drought periods [2], melting of polar ice and glaciers, warming and thermal expansion of the oceans causing sea level rise [11], and melting of permafrost, which may contribute to further warming [12]. Changes in interactions between the water cycle and the climate system will modify the risk from waterborne diseases from these physical impacts, as well as from the resulting risk of famine, water shortages, decreased water quality, increasing habitat for mosquitoes, alterations to seasonality of diseases and contaminated recreational waters. However, health impacts of waterborne disease over the longer term may be secondary to other health effects associated with other water issues (e.g., shortage, flooding, famine, the economy, sea level rise and war).\n\nTackling the climate change problem has focussed on mitigating the effects of greenhouse gas emissions through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), through cross government international agreements on reducing carbon emissions and by providing reliable scientific evidence and reports. While the approach has generally been to reduce worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, the reductions are likely to be slow and work on adaptation strategies to deal with the climate change associated with overall increases in temperature is also being undertaken.\n\n2. Climate Change and the Water Cycle\n\nEven cursory examination of the evidence shows the importance of water in relation to climate change. The impact of water in the decline of civilisations has been examined and reviewed [13]. Climate change is likely to affect the water cycle across the globe [14] with potential influences on surface and groundwater quality; it will lead to changes in atmospheric water vapour content, changes in cloud types and cover, and changes in the frequency of severe storms. Over time, it is likely that there will be increased melting of glaciers and icecaps [15] and ocean warming (and associated thermal expansion) that will cause sea levels to rise [16]. It remains possible that the release of permafrost methane may contribute to further warming [12,17]. These changes in atmospheric conditions and moisture content are expected to result in an increase in floods, famine, hurricanes and tropical storms, drought [18], wild fires, chronic water shortages, decreased water quality, periods with increased mosquito vectors, alterations to the seasonality of diseases, contaminated recreational waters and rising sea levels. Most assessments of the risks to health from climate change are conducted over time periods ranging from the present to 80 years. However, there are potentially much larger risks over longer timescales, particularly if there is a substantial sea level rise, and prolonged periods with much-increased average and peak temperatures [19].\n\nAlthough scientific understanding of how climate may affect weather patterns has increased enormously over the past few years, especially in relation to extreme weather, the consequences for, and influences on, water quality (e.g., microbiological quality) are far less studied [20]. Changes in water arise from interactions with the weather, affecting ecosystems, changing the flow of nutrients and pathogens in catchments, and influencing water quality. Climate change may influence the microbiological quality of river water, which may present risks to bathers [21]. A modelling approach involving Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment found that although climate change increased the fluxes of a number of pathogens, the overall change in risk was limited. Part of this was due to the dilution effect of increasing rainfall. As risks are likely to be location specific, wider generalisations are difficult. The approach used in such studies could be transferred to other locations. In summary the IPCC states that in overall terms, climate change is projected to reduce the quality of raw waters [22].\n\n3. Climate Change and Drinking Water-Related Infectious Diseases\n\nThe history of water-related disease dates back to the classical period when Empedocles is reported to have introduced drainage of a swamp (a public health intervention) to reduce disease [23]. The ability of waterborne diseases to cause large outbreaks that, in the case of typhoid and cholera, have a high morbidity and mortality, makes them important historically. A classification of water-related infections was drawn up by Bradley (Bradley’s classification [24]) and has been adapted by others [25,26,27]. A modified-version groups diseases into waterborne; water access related; water based; water-related insect vectors; and engineered water systems, although this revision still excludes some water-related diseases (Table 1).\n\nDrinking water is the most important waterborne disease risk because the contamination of large mains supplies can cause large outbreaks [28,29,30,31,32], and because small rural supplies are commonly contaminated [33,34] which, in developing countries, can lead to substantial infant mortality. Bottled water is usually safe, particularly natural mineral waters that are derived from deep wells or other secure sources, but outbreaks may occasionally occur. The water supplies on ships, trains and aircraft can be subject to contamination where the supply chain breaks down [35]. There are always potential risks when people drink untreated natural waters. The supply of clean water can become critical in areas of war, disaster, famine, drought, water shortage and flooding, and refugee supplies often need to be established rapidly to prevent outbreaks [36,37,38,39,40,41].\n\nWhile climate change may affect the microbiological quality of water and water-related diseases, the arguments indicate notable uncertainty over what the specific impacts will be, and when and where they will be most acute. However, to assess the likely impacts upon the health of humans, there is a need to examine the resilience of society to changing water quality. Developing an understanding of these capabilities and adaptation potentials is key to assessing the likely influence of climate change.\n\nOne of the major pathways through which contaminated water affects individuals is though drinking water. In terms of management, these supplies range from unimproved sources where the individual is effectively consuming raw water, to large, managed supplies where multiple barriers exist to prevent microbiological contamination of water supplies. Climate change has a number of potential influences upon water treatment, and higher temperatures are known to enhance biological methods of water treatment [43]. However, countering this effect are a number of other factors linked to more extreme weather, such as increased rainfall and water turbidity [44,45] which may increase risks to microbiological water quality in some locations. A review of the impacts of climate change on surface water contamination concluded that it was likely to increase the risk associated with drinking water supplied mainly during extreme climatic events [46]. Pathogen risk was argued to rise mainly due to elevated temperatures and extreme rainfall, especially in temperate countries.\n\nEnsuring appropriate water infrastructure, regular monitoring and appropriate management techniques, such as Water Safety Plans, are likely to be increasingly important to address changing risks. In the future rapid testing (e.g., PCR based) [47] and new treatment technologies (e.g., nanomaterials) [48] may play an increasing role in addressing climate change challenges. The ability to respond to changing risks will vary according to the resources available. In terms of supplies less able to adapt to a changing water quality, we highlight small water supplies, private water supplies as well as supplies in lower income areas as potentially being at greatest risk.\n\n4. Settings Other Than Drinking Water, and the Range of Water-Related Diseases\n\nDrinking water is not the only route through which potentially contaminated water may affect individuals; bathing water is another important pathway. As argued above, modelling is challenging, and this is especially the case given the multiple number of potential exposure points. Water quality modelling is currently possible, and could be extended to include climate change. Warning the public about water risks in relation to bathing water is one way to address changing risks associated with climate change [49].\n\nInfections can be related to exposure to natural and man-made recreational waters. These include thermal waters (amoebae, Legionella) [50], inland recreational fresh waters, ponds and lakes (cyanobacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa [51], enteric pathogens, Leptospira spp., Trichobilharzia spp. [52], Schistosoma spp. [53], Vibrio spp.) [54], wild swimming (enteric pathogens), coastal waters including sea sports, sea water pools, bathing beaches (dinoflagellates and diatoms, jelly-fish larvae, toxic seaweed, enteric pathogens) and the beach environment, including run-off from fields and sewers, beach sand, and so forth. Recreational exposure to man-made fresh water pools includes treated swimming pools (Cryptosporidium), natural pools (enteric pathogens), spa baths (P. aeruginosa [55], Legionella spp.), water parks (Cryptosporidium spp.), foot wash and foot spas (Mycobacterium spp. [56] and P. aeruginosa [57]) and inflatables (P. aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila [58]).\n\nInfections from working in water can include Schistosoma spp., Burkholderia pseudomallei [59] and wound infections from water (Vibrio vulnificus [60], Mycobacterium spp., [61] B. pseudomallei [62]). Water transmission in man-made systems and equipment includes hospital/medical uses of water, water for dialysis and hydration (cyanobacteria), water for washing and decontamination, hospital water systems, water transmission in intensive care (P. aeruginosa) [63,64,65,66], contaminated equipment including endoscope washers (Mycobacterium spp.) [67], humidifiers, taps and wash basins, showers (Legionella spp.) and water births [68,69,70,71]. A variety of industrial waters can contribute to respiratory infection, including cooling towers and thermally polluted waters (Legionella spp.).\n\nThe disposal of waste can contribute to water contamination, particularly chemical contamination, but also pathogens. Sewage disposal is the main source of human faecal contamination in developed countries and sewage treatment is designed to reduce this to a minimum. However, animal waste probably represents a larger input to the natural environment as a result of defecation on fields and run-off. In developing countries, human faeces are commonly deposited in the natural environment at defaecation sites or middens where the ‘night soil’ matures over time and some pathogens require this to become infectious (Ascaris lumbricoides [72], Cyclospora cayetanensis). There are also potential risks associated with water passing through waste burial sites, particularly mass graves associated with plague, smallpox or anthrax, and from water running from leather processing sites (Bacillus anthracis).\n\nWater is important in agriculture and food production, and irrigation may be conducted with water that is not of potable quality. Where this is done for salad items and soft fruit that are eaten without further treatment, then outbreaks can occur [73,74]. Contaminated water used for washing and food processing can also cause outbreaks. Food retailers require water on the premises in order for staff to wash their hands. Water-related foodborne disease (water-based) includes helminths and other macro-parasites, ciguatera, shellfish dinoflagellate toxins and similar toxins [75]. As shellfish filter large volumes of water, there are common outbreaks associated with faecal pathogens (especially norovirus and Vibrio cholerae [76], Vibrio parahaemolyticus [76] and Vibrio vulnificus [76]). Many processed drinks and foods contain water, and infections are prevented by source water protection, filtration, heat treatment or preservative treatment and a matrix that prevents pathogenic organisms from multiplying.\n\nWhere water is in short supply, water washed diseases may occur [14]. This can be in desert areas where lack of water and chronic water shortages, together with flies resulting from poor waste disposal, can allow the transmission of enteric (shigellosis) and eye infections (Chlamydia trachomatis).\n\nVector borne diseases (mosquito-borne, tick-borne, fly-borne, triatomid bug) can be strongly influenced by weather and geographic parameters, are likely to change in distribution as a result of climate change and are difficult to predict accurately [77], but are not examined further in this paper.\n\n5. Methods and Reviews Related to Water Quality and Health\n\nSystematic review (SR) and meta-analysis (MA) are methods which have been used extensively to elucidate the relationships between microbiological contamination and ill health. As climate change will impact water contamination, an examination of systematic reviews relating to water quality has been undertaken. A SR of the effectiveness of interventions to reduce the health impact of climate change around the world, found a weak evidence base and gaps in dealing with extreme weather events [78]. This follows a previous SR [79]. The seasonal differences in faecal contamination of source waters used for supplying drinking water have been examined in a SR [80]. They found increased contamination in the wet season. A general review of wider evidence for pathogens being waterborne and the impacts of climate are included in the review of pathogens (Table A1, Appendix A).\n\n6. Flooding\n\nFlooding causes local or widespread disruption of normal life and makes waste disposal difficult. A SR of waterborne infections and climate change found evidence of outbreaks and increased sporadic disease following flooding [37], and included cholera and other diarrhoeal diseases. Other reviews have found similar results [36] and the health impacts of flooding showed that monitoring, mitigation and communication had the potential to reduce loss of life [81]. Tsunami related flooding can have a disproportionate impact on women, children and the elderly [82]. The impact of flooding is generally greater in developing rural countries with poor infrastructure compared to developed countries where people in flooded properties can be readily moved to non-flooded areas for a temporary period and provided with potable water. This is particularly true of coastal areas [83]. After Hurricane Katrina, there was an outbreak of norovirus deriving from populations being held in a stadium [84] and an increase in Vibrio infections resulting from coastal waters [85]. An increase in flood related disease might be expected under climate change with altered weather patterns and more severe weather events. Early warning systems with effective disease surveillance, prevention and response are important in preventing infectious diseases following flooding [86].\n\n7. Drought\n\nDrought can be a hidden risk with the potential to cause a public health disaster [87]. A SR of the health effects of drought found the main categories included: Nutrition-related effects; water-related disease (including Escherichia coli, cholera and algal bloom); airborne and dust-related disease (including coccidioidomycosis); vector borne disease (including malaria, dengue and West Nile Virus); mental health effects; and other health effects [88]. A review in Canada found that drought can affect respiratory and mental health, with illnesses related to exposure to toxins, food, water and vector-borne diseases [89]. Drought-related health impacts vary widely and depend upon drought severity, population vulnerability, health and sanitation infrastructure, and available resources with which to mitigate impacts as they occur. Population resilience is affected by socio-economic environment. A SR has examined the likely impacts of climate change on water quality and disease in the Mekong delta basin [90].\n\n8. Disasters\n\nThe water needs for disaster recovery identified relations between the amount of water provided and the diarrhoea and mortality rates, but emphasised the inadequacy of the data [91]. As responses to climate related emergencies influence subsequent morbidity and mortality, it is important to understand the impact of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions on health outcomes in humanitarian crises. The current evidence base is limited, and is unsuitable for determining associative or causal relationships [92]. People living with HIV have a higher morbidity where there is contaminated water, poor hygiene and sanitation. Programs to improve these also improved morbidity [93].\n\n9. Climate Impacts on Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)\n\nUnderstanding the climate change impacts on water-related diseases requires an understanding of water, sanitation and hygiene. Much of the burden of waterborne disease appears to result from small and rural supplies, although there may be under-ascertainment of outbreaks in urban areas with mains supplies due to limited disease surveillance. This is important in an examination of the burden of waterborne disease and future changes as a result of altered weather patterns. Waterborne disease burden methodologies used in developed countries to attribute acute gastrointestinal infection (AGI) to drinking water, include simple point estimates, quantitative microbial risk assessment, Monte Carlo simulations based on assumptions and epidemiological data from the literature [94]. In developing countries, inadequate water and sanitation are associated with risk of diarrhoeal disease [95], particularly in young children, and raised maternal mortality occurs in households with poor sanitation and a poor water environment [96]. The microbiological quality of household water correlates with health outcomes (diarrhoea and trachoma) [97], although improved sources do not always provide water that is completely free of faecal contamination. Point of use devices can be effective [98], however, contamination of water between source and point of use remains a continuing problem [99]. An examination of interventions to reduce diarrhoea in less developed countries found, that while interventions were generally effective, the heterogeneity between studies made the exact conditions causing disease reductions difficult to assess [100], and others found a dearth of methodologically sound studies [101]. There were also inadequacies in behavioural models and frameworks for intervening in WASH specific interventions [102]. The impacts of WASH on child diarrhoeal morbidity has been examined in a number of studies [103] and there was a general lack of good quality studies of diarrhoea morbidity in children in India [104]. While water treatment (e.g., chlorine water treatment at point of use) can be effective, most studies are short term [105]. An examination of water distribution system deficiencies demonstrated that study blinding can be important [106]. Expecting to obtain good information on the risks from water-related infections under climate change, in the absence of reliable, experimental evidence for effectiveness of interventions, seems naïve.\n\nOf 293 outbreaks linked to water supplies in Canada and the US, failure of existing treatment and lack of water treatment were the leading causes [107]. Temporary water outages and chronic outages in intermittently operated systems can be associated with gastrointestinal infection [106]. The Walkerton outbreak of E. coli O157 and Campylobacter in Canada highlighted the role that heavy rainfall can play in outbreaks [108,109]. However, this was also linked to poor management. There are many studies that have examined the role of rainfall before an outbreak. It is generally seen that heavy rain is more common before many outbreaks, suggesting the source water is compromised [32,36,110,111,112]. The association between waterborne outbreaks with a period of prolonged low rainfall in the four weeks before an outbreak may also indicate a vulnerability to weather [32], although this was not seen in other studies. There is a strong need for water utilities to build water safety plans that factor in likely changes in climate over future scenarios, while retaining an understanding of historical weather events. Behaviour change interventions for water and sanitation in developing countries have looked at risk factors, attitudinal factors, normative factors, ability factors, and self-regulation factors [113]. Social marketing for water and sanitation products showed this improves health threat awareness and provides a solution to reducing disease burden [114]. Good water sourcing, treatment, distribution, storage and clean point of use remain the key to community health. Water and sanitation in schools is an important area where improvements can facilitate improved educational achievement [115].\n\nThere is a need for robust epidemiological studies that quantify the health risks associated with both small, private water systems, and large community supplies. More information is needed on pathogen quantification, susceptibility of vulnerable sub-populations, the influence of extreme weather events, the proportions of the population served by different water sources and the treatment level, source water quality and condition of the distribution system infrastructure. The exposure to faecal contamination in potable water has been estimated, suggesting that there may be a substantial under-estimate of disease burden [116].\n\n10. Which Water-Related Pathogens Are Important?\n\nA wide range of pathogens are known to be transmitted through water (Table A1, Appendix A). Historically, some diseases, such as cholera, dysentery and typhoid have been very important from a public health perspective, causing extensive morbidity and mortality. Many of the diseases are a problem where there is limited infrastructure, as in developing countries or rural regions of developed countries and can be sensitive to social disruption and infrastructure damage. It is important to understand the future health impacts of climate change and to understand where the most important disease burdens will be. Waterborne diseases can be sensitive to emergence, but this is generally related to the discovery of new infectious agents or identification methods (e.g., cryptosporidiosis, microsporidiosis, legionellosis, hepatitis E) rather than newly emergent diseases. However, some classical waterborne pathogens may emerge in new areas with climate change (e.g., cholera), and Legionnaires’ disease, which is predominately derived from contaminated water systems in the built environment, may increase as a result of raised temperatures.\n\nAn examination of 24 analytical studies assessing the association between extreme precipitation or temperature and drinking water-related waterborne infections, found that most studies showed a positive association with increased precipitation or temperature. A few studies showed an association with decreased precipitation and several in which there was no association [117]. Infections included cholera, typhoid, paratyphoid, campylobacter, shigella, hepatitis A, cryptosporidiosis, giardiasis and waterborne outbreaks.\n\n10.1. Schistosomiasis\n\nSchistosoma are transmitted as a result of cercaria burrowing through the skin of people working or bathing in contaminated waters. The cercaria develop in infected snails. Although temperature, precipitation and humidity are known to influence the development of schistosome parasites, as well as their intermediate snail hosts (Biomphalaria spp.; Oncomelania spp.) [118,119,120,121] and their internal defence system [122], modelling climate change impacts on disease can have mixed results [123,124]. Some scenarios show predicted increases and decreases [125], with degrees of uncertainty [126,127]. Increases in parasite growth related to temperature can be offset by increased snail mortality at higher temperatures [127]. Schistosoma eradication campaigns may be impacted by changes in snail distribution, migrant workers and weather [128]. The impact of water and sanitation on schistosomiasis has shown that access to safe water and adequate sanitation is important in reducing schistosomiasis [129,130].\n\n10.2. Guinea Worm\n\nDracunculus medinensis is transmitted by drinking water contaminated with copepods that contain the parasite larvae, and infections are easily controlled with simple measures. This disease is moving rapidly towards eradication under the supervision of the Carter Centre, with the World Health Organisation, UNICEF and CDC [131,132]. Although climate is likely to influence disease, the biggest problems in elimination have been organising surveillance in conflict areas [133], and the recent demonstration of a transmission cycle in dogs, particularly in Chad [134].\n\n10.3. Nematodes\n\nAscaris, Trichuris and hookworms are soil transmitted nematodes, and transmission is related to inadequate methods for faecal/wastewater disposal. Risk of Necator infections were linked to rainfall in East Timor [135]. For Ascaris lumbricoides, higher temperatures in the coolest quarter of the year resulted in reduced risk. There is little evidence to suggest that changes in climate might greatly increase disease transmission and evidence that helminth control measures, if effectively undertaken, might cause substantial reductions in disease. A SR of spatial and temporal distribution of soil transmitted helminths was used to determine changing disease burden and predict treatment needs for eradication [136]. Another soil helminth SR and MA identified reductions in disease associated with WASH activities, but emphasised the limited nature of the studies, which were mostly observational [137].\n\n10.4. Protozoa\n\nWaterborne cryptosporidiosis is common, even in developed countries because the parasite’s oocysts are resistant to chlorine, which is the main chemical treatment used for disinfecting both drinking water and indoor recreational waters, including swimming pools [138]. The oocysts are common in natural waters and can be present in source waters. A SR and MA of the impacts of weather on surface waters indicated that contamination with Cryptosporidium and Giardia was 2.61 and 2.87 higher during and after heavy rainfall [139]. A SR was used to examine the risks of endemic cryptosporidiosis, and found increased risk associated with the unsafe use of water [140]. This makes the need for risk assessment necessary. Cryptosporidiosis outbreaks may well increase if there are more frequent incidents of severe weather. In many countries, surveillance involving the laboratory identification of isolates is absent or suboptimal. Without good surveillance, outbreaks will be missed, and the prevention of these not dealt with. A SR of Toxoplasma outbreaks showed longer incubation following exposure to contaminated water compared to meat related exposures [141]. A SR of intestinal protozoal infections found significantly lower odds of infection in people with treated water [142]. Giardia transmission is not as well understood as Cryptosporidium, mostly because typing approaches have been suboptimal and routine surveillance in developed countries has focussed on the link to travel, rather than indigenous sources of infection [143]. Hygiene linked to water is important and occurrence in developing countries shows no relationship to rainfall [144]. However, the infection is common, and determining any change due to climate may be difficult. Both Giardia and Cryptosporidium are common in developing countries, and include a variety of species and types, and it has been suggested that climate change will increase malnutrition and contamination of water sources [145].\n\nNaegleria fowleri infections are commonly associated with thermally polluted waters and cases might increase with raised temperatures. However, many of the reported infections are associated with geothermal waters that will not be greatly impacted by climate change.\n\n10.5. Cholera and Other Diarrhoeal Diseases\n\nCholera remains one of the major diarrhoeal disease concerns with climate change. There has been a long history of associations between seasonality and weather as contributing factors in outbreaks. Cholera is also readily inserted into disaster situations and can contribute to morbidity and mortality. Examination of the weather relationship in El Niño years to the occurrence of cholera suggests that weather might be able to be used for predicting outbreaks in East Africa [146]. However, the assumptions in models are not necessarily always proven in practice [147,148,149]. As pandemics of cholera have occurred in the past, there is a strong need to reduce the risks of another pandemic arising out of a disaster situation. Changes in seawater temperature may contribute to changes in disease incidence [150]. The impact of water, sanitation and hygiene interventions are important in the control of cholera [151]. Home water treatment and storage interventions can reduce diarrhoea and cholera [152]. This study demonstrated the dearth of good evidence. A SR looked at the environmental determinants of cholera in inland Africa [147]. They found that spread was linked to displaced populations and the poor water and sanitation associated with these settings. A similar review of coastal cholera by the same authors found that cholera seasonality is driven by rainfall-induced contamination of unprotected water sources [148].\n\nThe impact of a changing climate is most important when it comes to the quality of drinking water and diarrhoeal diseases, particularly in developing countries [37]. There are relationships between many of the bacterial infections and temperature, and evidence of links to heavy rainfall and flooding [32,110,117]. The sources of exposure may be agricultural [153] or from sewage, and the different sources contain different pathogens, with human viruses rarely being detected in animal waste [154]. Engagement with the water sector is important in reducing risks.\n\n10.6. Legionella\n\nLegionnaires’ disease is commonly associated with thermally polluted waters [155]. Due to the relationship between temperature and the occurrence of Legionella spp. in water, one might expect an increase in cases or outbreaks associated with climate change. Studies indicate that temperature and humidity [156,157], or vapour pressure [158], may play a role in the occurrence of sporadic disease. Due to concerns about the multiplication of Legionella spp. at the consumer endpoint (taps and showers) the European Drinking Water Directive has been modified to include a risk assessment for this pathogen. A SR on cooling towers related to Legionnaires’ disease provided quite detailed advice on risks and their mitigation [159]. As climate changes becomes more apparent, there may be improvements in our understanding of previously unrecognised transmission routes from the natural environment.\n\n10.7. Leptospira spp.\n\nLeptospirosis outbreaks are commonly linked to flooding in rural developing countries. This relates to the dislocation of small mammal populations [160,161,162]. It is expected that an increase in flooding will contribute to more leptospirosis cases. Floods are one of the most important drivers of leptospirosis on islands and in Asia [163].\n\n10.8. Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n\nThe ability of Pseudomonas to grow in water is dependent on being able to extract nutrients from the surfaces it is growing on, and to bloom within the body of the water. This includes outbreaks of folliculitis associated with spa pools and is dependent on temperature. One must therefore expect some increase associated with increased temperatures. A SR of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in hospitals found evidence that the water systems can be the source of this organism, and that contamination mostly occurs at the distal end [164]. Water resource management is important in control of this [165]. P. aeruginosa infections are common, and numbers related to water use may increase with a changing climate.\n\n10.9. Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs)\n\nHarmful algal blooms have the potential to increase with changes in climate [75]. The neurotoxin producing dinoflagellate and diatom plankton mainly cause disease through shellfish poisoning and Ciguatera poisoning in fish, but can also be responsible for the mass deaths of fish. Monitoring of shellfish waters can facilitate shellfish bed closures as a means of controlling exposure through food, while ciguatera is mostly controlled by not eating carnivorous reef fish. Blooms can cause respiratory symptoms in people on affected bathing beaches. Freshwater cyanobacteria are a potential risk through untreated potable water, and the toxic products can cause liver disease. In developed countries, these problems should be dealt with by water utilities.\n\n10.10. Shiga-Toxin Producing E. coli (STEC)\n\nAs water is commonly contaminated with the faeces of agricultural animals, ways of reducing E. coli O157 excretion by cattle have been examined [166]. Further work on preventing haemolytic uremic syndrome found that vaccine use on animals reduced carriage, but the study emphasised the importance of public health measures [167]. Patients were consistently found to have exposure to rodents, behavioural and sanitation related risk factors.\n\n10.11. Norovirus\n\nAn examination of norovirus transmission routes showed higher attack rates in foodborne than waterborne transmission, and higher rates in surface derived than groundwater derived waters [168]. Given the very common occurrence of this pathogen, any change will possibly depend more on progress in vaccinations rather than an impact from climate change. However, outbreaks may occur when large populations are kept in confined areas during an emergency [84].\n\n10.12. Trachoma\n\nChlamydia trachomatis is the cause of trachoma, a disease of the eyes related to water shortage. Water can be important in reducing trachoma, where the F and E of the SAFE strategy (surgery, antibiotics, facial cleanliness and environmental improvement) were strongly linked to disease reduction [169]. Another trachoma SR found the studies too limited to demonstrate the impact of F and E [170]. The SAFE interventions are dramatically reducing disease but could be disrupted in chaotic situations associated with climate change.\n\n11. Preparing for Climate Change\n\nThe principal reason for drinking water infections is the absence of reliable infrastructure. For rural communities worldwide, this includes the source waters used for drinking, the methods used to transport it from source to household, safe storage within the household, any treatment used and hygiene and sewage disposal changes. The principal underlying factor is poverty. Improving water treatment needs to be accompanied by improvements in sewage disposal and hygiene training. Climate change will not alter these underlying principles. What could change is the frequency of water shortages, population movements, conflict, refugee camps and so on, and a deterioration in the hygienic quality of water that people receive. Good planning associated with disasters can reduce the risks of waterborne diseases [41]. Any increase in disease associated with disasters in developing countries can have knock-on effects in developed ones.\n\nWith climate change, it is important to build knowledge of the mechanisms by which changes in weather can influence individual pathogens, and how these may subsequently affect human health. Not all problems associated with diarrhoeal diseases are as a result of outbreaks and it is important to understand the drivers for sporadic disease, and the disease burdens associated with the range of common pathogens. Good surveillance is necessary in order to detect clusters and outbreaks at an early stage, so that they can be investigated and controlled in a timely way, and so that future outbreaks can be prevented.\n\nMost enteric pathogens are very seasonal, with bacterial pathogens (e.g., Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., STEC) predominating in the summer months, while viral gastroenteritis predominantly peaks in the winter (e.g., norovirus, rotavirus) [171]. The analytical examination of weather drivers has relied on time series approaches, that have limitations due to the collinearity between, for example temperature and seasonality, making it difficult to get definitive evidence of the causal mechanisms and to predict the impact of changes in climate. A review of mathematical approaches to demonstrating weather influences on waterborne infections has been undertaken [172]. The studies grouped into two clusters: Process-based models (PBM) and time series and spatial epidemiology (TS-SE). A review of analytical epidemiology studies looked at the quality of evidence for associations with rainfall, temperature, and so on, and waterborne disease identified the difficulties with developing optimum approaches [117]. A more systematic examination of the seasonality of a full range of pathogens [171] may widen our understanding of those that are linked to climate fluctuations. There are also a range of less analytical approaches that can contribute to a better understanding of waterborne pathogens and future risks (Table A1, Appendix A). Further development of tools to separate the effects of weather from other influences on seasonality needs to be undertaken, utilising surveillance data from a wider geographic area and linking local cases to local weather.\n\n12. Conclusions\n\nThere have been a number of previous reviews and publications highlighting potential impacts of climate change and water-related illness in water-related or waterborne disease [37,38,117,172,173,174,175,176,177,178,179,180,181,182]. Some approaches examine the technological means to best represent the data [42,175,177,178,183], some examine outbreaks [28,32] and others focus on effects of the hydrological cycle in particular regions [28,110,174,179], while others have adopted a systematic review approach [37]. This paper has examined a full range of water-related pathogens, providing an evidence base for regarding them as water-related and indicating which studies have provided evidence. In addition to a changing climate, the world will continue to experience an increasing human population, with ever greater inter-connectivity through travel and information technology. Animal infections will continue to contribute to zoonotic disease and we should expect new pathogens to continue to arise. With climate change we need to watch for the rise in cholera worldwide. Although this is predominantly a disease of the poor and is not generally a problem in developed countries that have safe drinking water, it still has the potential to cause pandemic disease if there is general chaos, as can be found in disaster situations. The growth of Vibrio cholera in coastal waters means there can be changes in exposure with alterations in rainfall and temperature [150]. There remains a strong need for timely surveillance and rapid epidemiological response to outbreaks and new waterborne pathogens. The needs of developing countries in relation to waterborne diseases are both technical and financial, and ensuring adequate quantities of good quality water will be essential in preventing excess morbidity and mortality in areas that will suffer from substantial changes in climate in the future.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nG.N. initiated the paper and reviewed the evidence for waterborne disease and climate change.
