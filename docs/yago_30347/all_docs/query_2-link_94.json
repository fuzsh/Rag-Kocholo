        "text": "General Hospital Spoilers report it has been confirmed that Blair Cramer (Kassie DePaiva) is coming to Port Charles this September, and fans are here for it. We haven’t seen Blair since December of 2013, and viewers are itching to find out what she’s been up to and who might be interesting enough to bring her back to town. Will Tracy Quartermaine’s (Jane Elliot) lawsuit dovetail with Blair’s visit? Could she be headed to town with ties to Austin Gatlin Holt (Roger Howarth) and Mason Gatlin (Nathanyael Grey)?\n\nMore importantly, might Blair be the infamous third ex-wife to Martin ‘Marty’ Grey (Michael E. Knight)? If she is, he’s going to have a lot of explaining to do about the vicious tall tales he told on her.\n\nGeneral Hospital Spoilers — Marty Sold His Story To Everyone\n\nWhen Marty first came to Port Charles, he was hoping to steer clear of anyone finding out who his brother was — the infamous Cyrus Renault (Jeff Kober).\n\nMarty went to great lengths to hide those ties, and he didn’t embrace them when they became public knowledge.\n\nNow, it appears he’s playing the same game with his ex-wife, which leads us to believe he wouldn’t necessarily divulge that information unless she too came to town and forced him to confront the truth.\n\nMarty has sold a rather salacious story that all three of his ex-wives are money-hungry and vindictive.\n\nSo he’s going to have to answer for himself if it turns out Blair is any one of his exes — but most especially if she is his third ex-wife.\n\nGH Spoilers – Say Blair Cramer Was Never Like That\n\nEveryone remembers Blair being adjoined at the hip to Todd Manning (Roger Howarth), but Max Holden (James DePaiva), Patrick Thornhart (Thorsten Kaye), and many others stole Blair’s heart over the years.\n\nWhile she wasn’t always the best judge of character and may have let a few too many imposters into her bed, Blair had a good head on her shoulders and managed to raise an amazing daughter, Starr Manning (Kristen Alderson).\n\nIn other words, she was never one to seek such terrible vengeance, but are we safe to assume that Marty’s ex is actually the one in the wrong here?\n\nREAD THIS: Find out what happens next on General Hospital.\n\nGeneral Hospital Spoilers — Is Blair Cramer The Link Between Tracy Quartermaine And Marty Grey?\n\nFans are spitting out theories left and right as to why Blair is coming to Port Charles if she is, in fact, Marty’s ex. Which number is she?\n\nMaybe Blair wants Marty back. Maybe they were never even divorced! Is Tracy conspiring with Blair to help her break Marty and Lucy apart and take Lucy down at the same time?"
