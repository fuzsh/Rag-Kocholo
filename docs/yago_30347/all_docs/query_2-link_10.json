        "text": "Kassie DePaiva‘s Blair Cramer resurfaces on General Hospital beginning this Friday — and TVLine can exclusively reveal what (or better yet who) coaxes the One Life to Live vixen back to Port Charles.\n\nAs our sister site Soaps.com correctly speculated (and as confirmed by the above image), it will be revealed that Blair is the mysterious third ex-wife of Martin Grey, played by All My Children-turned-GH cast member Michael E. Knight. DePaiva will also share scenes with GH vet Jane Elliot, who plays Tracy Quartermaine.\n\nAs we noted when we broke the news of DePaiva’s casting last month, this will not be the OLTL alum’s first trip to GH. In March 2012, just two months after OLTL ended its broadcast run on ABC, the actress brought Blair to GH for a multi-month crossover event that also featured her longtime Llanview leading man Roger Howarth, AKA Todd Manning. Coincidentally, Howarth has been starring on GH for much of the past decade in myriad new roles, first as Franco Baldwin (R.I.P.) and, currently, as Austin Gatlin-Holt.\n\nDePaiva — who recently returned to Days of Our Lives as Eve Donovan — recently discussed a possible GH return (and the inevitable deja vu with Howarth), telling Soap Opera Digest that she would be game to return to the soap as Blair.\n\n“There’s a lot of history there, a lot of time, a lot of water under that bridge,” she told to the mag, before acknowledging, “But I guess Todd is not Todd, right? So if I was to go back on that show, he probably wouldn’t recognize me. But I could go, ‘You’re hot. You look like somebody I used to know.’”"
