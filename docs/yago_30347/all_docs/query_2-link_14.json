        "text": "When daytime fan favorite, Kassie DePaiva, drops into Port Charles and General Hospital, she will be reprising her One Life to Live role as Blair Cramer.\n\nCircle this Friday, September 15th for the start of Kassie’s stint.\n\nAccording to TV Line, in story, it will be revealed that Blair is the ‘mysterious’ third wife of Martin Grey (Michael E. Knight). Look for DePaiva to share scenes not only with Knight, but the one and only Jane Elliot (Tracy Quartermaine).\n\nThis is not Blair’s first trip to Port Charles. DePaiva brought her Llanview alter-ego to GH back in March of 2012, just two months after One Life to Live went off the air on ABC.\n\nAt that time, Blair was part of a story arc on GH that lasted several months, along with Roger Howarth, who was then playing Todd Manning. Howarth is still on the show today in his third incarnation as Austin Gatlin-Holt.\n\nFans may remember the “What If'” ABC Daytime short-form stories and promos. One of which featured Knight as AMC’s Tad Martin meeting DePaiva’s Blair Cramer on an airplane flight. You can check that out below.\n\nSo, what do you think about Blair being liked up with Martin on GH? Share your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nOn the Tuesday, August 30th episode of ABC’s General Hospital, John “Jagger” Cates (Adam J. Harrington) becomes more unhinged as his hatred for Sonny (Maurice Benard) has taken over any sense of reason. First, he tried to get Kristina (Kate Mansi) put behind bars for threatening to kill and harm Ava Jerome (Maura West) during the confrontation that saw Kristina go crashing through a window.\n\nKnowing Cates is using Kristina as a pawn to get to him, Sonny goes into the courtroom as cool as a cucumber, while Alexis (Nancy Lee Grahn) goes before the judge to argue how Cates’ case against her daughter has no merit. The judge gives Cates 48 hours to come up with proof and build a case of the allegations he levied against Kristina, or he is in deep trouble with the law and the FBI.\n\nMeanwhile, Ava (Maura West) and Nina (Cynthia Watros) talk at the gallery where Ava admits what happened when Kristina came to pay her visit the night she fell through the window and lost her unborn baby. When Nina asks what really went down that day, Ava explains that Kristina came to see her after she was issued a subpoena. Ava confirms that Kristina barged into the room and was yelling at her. She then adds that at some point she put her hands on Kristina, but Kristina pulled away, and tripped over some luggage and fell through the window. Ava begs Nina to believe her. Later, Nina make a call to someone calling in a favor.\n\nAfter his case against Kristina goes bust, Cates heads to Ava’s gallery, where he informs her what happened in court. Ava thinks she will really need her lawyer now and she hasn’t heard from Scott. That is when Cates pipes up that she doesn’t need Scott and how she is the only hope he has left.\n\nCates tells Ava that she has to give him a statement, the one he wants and she will give it exactly like he wants her to. Concerned, Ava tries to deflect saying its late and she’s tired so she will deal with it tomorrow. However, Cates shuts her down saying he has 48 hours to get the case together. So, he tells Ava on no uncertain times they are going to start now to perfect her statement.\n\nLaura (Genie Francis) has been summoned to Silver Springs by Lulu’s doctor. Fearing the worst, Kevin (Jon Lindstrom) and Laura show up. Laura finds her brother Cyrus (Jeff Kober) there, too. Meanwhile at Sam’s (Kelly Monaco) place, Rocco (Finn Carr) tells Dante (Dominic Zamprogna, he is waiting to hear his mother’s voice again and for her to wake up one day. Back at Silver Springs, when the doctor arrives, she tells Laura that Lulu’s liver is compromised and if it continues her liver will fail. Laura asks if her daughter is going to die, and we fade to black.\n\nSo, is Agent Cates about to have a rude awakening? Will his plot to force a statement out of Ava fail miserably? Will Lulu wake up sooner than later? Comment below.
