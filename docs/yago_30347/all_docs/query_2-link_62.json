        "text": "MAX HOLDEN BUCHANAN\n\n(1987 - 1990 and\n\n1992 - PRESENT)\n\nJames DePaiva plays the charmingly amoral, Max Holden, Llanview's Man Ready with a Plan or a Scam. James was born in Livermore, CA and is not just a talented actor; he is musically accomplished, also. James started his professional music career, playing the electric bass when he was still a teenager. His musical repertoire includes punk rock, Latin rock and country-western and he played in a number of bands. After eight years of performing as a professional musician, his interest in theater and drama overshadowed his interest in music and he switched to acting, appearing in local theater productions. James DePaiva studied drama and to enhance his acting capabilities he also pursued fencing, ballet and jazz dance at a community college. He hired an agent and moved to Los Angeles. His first television role was on General Hospital playing Eddie Holton, a waiter with a crush on Holly Scorpio (Emma Samms)."
