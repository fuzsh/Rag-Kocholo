        "text": "Soap fan favorite, Kassie DePaiva is making a return to ABC’s General Hospital in her role as Blair Cramer from One Life to Live.\n\nA rep for the daytime drama series confirmed to TV Line that DePaiva will begin airing in September. DePaiva appeared as Llanview’s Blair before on GH.\n\nAfter One Life to Live ended in 2012, and in March of that year, GH kicked-off a crossover story that featured DePaiva along with Roger Howarth, formerly Todd Manning on One Life and GH.\n\nWhile Howarth has remained at GH in other roles over the years including as Franco Baldwin and Austin Gatlin-Holt, DePaiva has also been playing Days of our Lives’ Eve Donovan on and off. She recently appeared on the Peacock streaming soap opera earlier this month when she reprised Eve for a short stint.\n\nDePaiva recently spoke to Soap Opera Digest saying she would love a chance to back to GH and reprise Blair, but she added, “I guess Todd is not Todd, right?’ So if I was to go back on that show, he probably wouldn’t recognize me. But I could go,‘You’re hot. You look like somebody I used to know.’”\n\nLooking forward to seeing Blair on GH again? What story would you like to see her involved with? Share your thoughts via the comment section below.\n\nTV host, author and journalist, Debbie Matenopoulos makes a two-day guest appearance starting today August 22nd and again tomorrow on Friday, August 23rd when she comes to General Hospital playing the producer of the QVC-type fictional home shopping network in Port Charles, “Home & Heart.”\n\nMatenopoulos shares scenes with Morgan Fairchild, Jane Elliot, Rena Sofer, Amanda Setton, Kirsten Storms, Eva LaRue and more. Debbie, who also had her own skin care line, also helps launch the clever promotional tie-in, beginning today when GH officially launches the website ShopHomeandHeart.com which makes it possible for viewers to get skin care products and more. Leading the way is “The Deceptor” which is a portable skincare device created and inspired by the GH storyline.\n\nDebbie visited the Michael Fairman Channel in a brand-new virtual interview where she teases what happens in the story, discusses her love of GH, her time on ABC’s The View as a co-host (1997-1999) and working and knowing TV legend Barbara Walters, and of course, being buddies with Cameron Mathison (Drew Quartermaine, GH). The two formerly hosted Hallmark Channel’s former morning talk show, Home & Family.\n\nIn a preview of the action on GH, it look like Lois comes to the rescue on the set of “Home & Heart” in situation that may back-fire. Debbie shared, “Lois overhears something like literally 10 seconds before she’s about to go on air and it throws her for a loop. That’s all I’m gonna say. And here I am, producer Michelle, and I have to sort of try to smooth this out, and she hears what is being told to me. So it’s unfortunate if you’re about to go on live television, you hear something that kind of throws you. It is something that she would hope that she had not heard . So anyway, without me giving to much, just watch it. It’s so good.”\n\nDebbie also revealed she is a huge fan of Jane Elliot’s and was thrilled to work with her: “I am obsessed with her. She is one of the coolest women I’ve ever met in my life. Jane has the best stories in the world, probably, which cannot be repeated in public, but they are hysterical.”\n\nCameron Mathison was not on set the day that Matenopolous taped her scenes, so she is hoping to be brought back: “I said to Frank Valentini (EP, GH), please bring back. I don’t care what you make me on the show. I will be the street sweeper if you need me to be,” she suggested. “I just want to be in a scene with Cameron because I so desperately would like an Easter egg for the audience. You know? Because people who watched Home & Family also watch General Hospital. I want Cameron to say to me, “Have I met you somewhere ?” I just want to just throw the line away, like, “I don’t think so.” (Laughs)\n\nAs to how her former show show, The View, has evolved in 27 years since she was first at the table as a co-host, Debbie expressed, “It’s such a different show now. I believe it is not what (the late) Barbara Walters and Bill Geddie (ex-EP, The View) intended it to be, ever. Barbara was protective of her political beliefs that she would never say one way or another, whether she was Republican or Democrat because she felt it was inappropriate when she’s trying to interview people.”\n\nMatenopolous added, “I don’t think Barbara would have ever allowed the show to be what it is today. Now having said that, it has evolved in so many ways, and it has become a completely different program. It is very political and arguably the most influential political daytime show, which is not a bad thing. It’s just a different show than it was when I was on. It was more of a lifestyle program, then. Barbara came from news, and her idea of making The View was it was her time to have fun and have girlfriends and not have to think about all of that hard news that she was coming from on a daily basis. It was her place to relax. That’s really why she did it.

Harrington) becomes more unhinged as his hatred for Sonny (Maurice Benard) has taken over any sense of reason. First, he tried to get Kristina (Kate Mansi) put behind bars for threatening to kill and harm Ava Jerome (Maura West) during the confrontation that saw Kristina go crashing through a window.\n\nKnowing Cates is using Kristina as a pawn to get to him, Sonny goes into the courtroom as cool as a cucumber, while Alexis (Nancy Lee Grahn) goes before the judge to argue how Cates’ case against her daughter has no merit. The judge gives Cates 48 hours to come up with proof and build a case of the allegations he levied against Kristina, or he is in deep trouble with the law and the FBI.\n\nMeanwhile, Ava (Maura West) and Nina (Cynthia Watros) talk at the gallery where Ava admits what happened when Kristina came to pay her visit the night she fell through the window and lost her unborn baby. When Nina asks what really went down that day, Ava explains that Kristina came to see her after she was issued a subpoena. Ava confirms that Kristina barged into the room and was yelling at her. She then adds that at some point she put her hands on Kristina, but Kristina pulled away, and tripped over some luggage and fell through the window. Ava begs Nina to believe her. Later, Nina make a call to someone calling in a favor.\n\nAfter his case against Kristina goes bust, Cates heads to Ava’s gallery, where he informs her what happened in court. Ava thinks she will really need her lawyer now and she hasn’t heard from Scott. That is when Cates pipes up that she doesn’t need Scott and how she is the only hope he has left.\n\nCates tells Ava that she has to give him a statement, the one he wants and she will give it exactly like he wants her to. Concerned, Ava tries to deflect saying its late and she’s tired so she will deal with it tomorrow. However, Cates shuts her down saying he has 48 hours to get the case together. So, he tells Ava on no uncertain times they are going to start now to perfect her statement.\n\nLaura (Genie Francis) has been summoned to Silver Springs by Lulu’s doctor. Fearing the worst, Kevin (Jon Lindstrom) and Laura show up. Laura finds her brother Cyrus (Jeff Kober) there, too. Meanwhile at Sam’s (Kelly Monaco) place, Rocco (Finn Carr) tells Dante (Dominic Zamprogna, he is waiting to hear his mother’s voice again and for her to wake up one day. Back at Silver Springs, when the doctor arrives, she tells Laura that Lulu’s liver is compromised and if it continues her liver will fail. Laura asks if her daughter is going to die, and we fade to black.\n\nSo, is Agent Cates about to have a rude awakening? Will his plot to force a statement out of Ava fail miserably? Will Lulu wake up sooner than later? Comment below. But first, check out the touching scenes featuring Finn Carr and Dominic Zamprogna from today’s GH."
