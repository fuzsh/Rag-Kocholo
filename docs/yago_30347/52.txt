Llanview resident Blair Cramer (played by daytime-TV vet Kassie DePaiva) returns to General Hospital today, and we’ve got an exclusive first look at her not-quite-happy reunion with Port Charles’ latest import — and her ex-hubby — Todd Manning (Roger Howarth).

This clip from Thursday’s episode of the ABC sudser finds the onetime One Life to Live loves coming together to celebrate the musical debut of their daughter, Starr. And though Todd and Blair are definitely still on the outs (remember, he did “kill” his twin brother and frame her boyfriend for the crime!), the chemistry between the two is as undeniable as it ever was — and it’s never more apparent than in the final moments of this preview.

That said, as we first told you, Blair comes also bearing news for Todd — and he has something he wants to tell her. Hmmm….

Blair first resurfaces on Wednesday’s GH, most likely in the very final seconds (you know how it is). Press PLAY for a sneak peek at her and Todd’s sparkage, and then hit the comments with your thoughts on the possible love (re)connection!

P.S. Bonus points for the Irene Manning nod, Todd!
