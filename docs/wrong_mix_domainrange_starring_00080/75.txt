Henry Hall, the 21-year-old son of actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, has been an official New Yorker for two whole days — but he’s already feeling the spirit of the city.

“If any muggers want to take advantage of someone who doesn’t know the city, send them my way,” says Hall, a singer and guitarist whose band, Grand Cousin, releases its new, self-titled EP on July 8.

It’s not surprising Hall is funny. His mom is the “Seinfeld” alum who has won two Emmys for her role on HBO’s “Veep.” His father, Brad Hall, was Louis-Dreyfus’ castmate on “Saturday Night Live” in the ’80s.

But the comedy couple inadvertently did more to steer their son toward music than the family business: “My dad’s a Beatles fanatic,” says Hall, while his mother prefers Earth, Wind & Fire.

The Wesleyan grad began playing guitar and writing songs at age 10. He became introspective in high school, citing The Smiths as an influence — and it’s evident in Grand Cousin’s music. The band’s single “Oxygen” features upbeat chords against anxiety-laden lyrics.

“It isn’t interesting if the song is just one emotional note,” he says.

Still, comedy is in his blood, evident when asked for an example of advice he received from his parents.

“One time my dad said, ‘If you ever travel back in time, don’t step on anything, because that will screw up the future for everybody.’ That’s a ‘Simpsons’ joke,” he says. “Everything they say is good advice. They’re like little parent Buddhas.”
