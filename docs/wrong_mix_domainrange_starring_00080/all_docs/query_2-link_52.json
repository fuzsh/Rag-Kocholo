        "text": "CLICK HERE if you are having a problem viewing the photos on a mobile device\n\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus says she stayed quiet following the drug overdose death of her younger half-sister, Emma Louis-Dreyfus, out of respect for her memory — not because they weren’t close.\n\nIn a New Yorker profile, Louis-Dreyfus also said that the death of Emma Louis-Dreyfus, an Oakland resident, was as much of a shock to her as it was to anyone else. She said she got the tragic news as she returned to work on the “Veep” set that month, following months of chemotherapy for breast cancer.\n\n“It was out of the blue,” Louis-Dreyfus said.\n\nEmma Louis-Dreyfus, a 44-year-old San Mateo County social worker, died of an accidental drug overdose while at a campsite close to a popular hiking trail in South Yuba River State Park, north of Nevada City, authorities in Nevada County told the Union newspaper in Grass Valley in October.\n\nFirst responders went to a campsite a quarter-mile upstream of Purdon Crossing about 9:30 a.m. Aug. 13 after receiving reports of a woman having a seizure and becoming unresponsive. Three or four other people were with Emma Louis-Dreyfus at the campsite.\n\nMike Sullivan, Nevada County’s chief deputy coroner, ruled Emma Louis-Dreyfus’ death accidental following the results of a toxicology test. She had elevated amounts of cocaine and alcohol in her system, Sullivan told the Union.\n\nThe actress expressed dismay at some of the coverage of Emma’s death, including any suggestions that she and her sister had been estranged.\n\n“Given the fact that that heinous (expletive) came out, I would simply say I’ve kept this under wraps out of reverence for my dearest Emma,” Julia Louis-Dreyfus told the New Yorker.\n\n“It’s been a very bad period of time,” she added.\n\nIndeed, the past two years have been a time of both triumph and tragedy for the award-winning actress.\n\nIn September 2016, she broke down in tears on stage as she accepted her fifth Emmy Award for playing politician Selina Meyer in “Veep.” (She’s won eight acting Emmys in total, six for “Veep.”) She revealed that her father, billionaire business mogul William Louis-Dreyfus, had died two days earlier.\n\n“Lastly, I’d like to dedicate this to my father, William Louis-Dreyfus, who passed away on Friday,” Louis-Dreyfus said. “I’m so glad that he liked ‘Veep’ because his opinion was the one that really mattered.”\n\nJust after winning another outstanding lead actress Emmy in September 2017, Julia Louis-Dreyfus revealed that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. Following months of treatment, she announced that her cancer was in remission.\n\nAt an event in October 2018, Louis-Dreyfus said that she is “very lucky” to be alive. That same month, she accepted the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor at John F. Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.\n\nWith regard to her sister, the New Yorker profile pointed out that the Louis-Dreyfus family situation has always been “complicated” but “privileged.”\n\nWilliam Louis-Dreyfus was the head of a powerful family commodities-trading firm; his net worth was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2006.\n\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus is the daughter of William Louis-Dreyfus’ first wife, Judith LeFever, a writer and special-needs tutor, whom he divorced the year after the future actress was born in 1961.\n\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus, one of the most awarded actors in television history, was raised by her mother and stepfather in Washington, D.C., where she attended high school at the prestigious Holton-Arms School in Bethesda, Maryland, the alma mater of Palo Alto University Professor Christine Blasey Ford.\n\nEmma Louis-Dreyfus was born to William Louis-Dreyfus and his second wife, Phyllis Blankenship. She grew up in New York City, then attended Brown University, where she received a bachelor’s degree in psychology, according to her obituary. She moved to the Bay Area in 1998 and received a master’s degree in social work from UC Berkeley.\n\nIn her career, Emma Louis-Dreyfus had worked as a clinical social worker and family therapist and was a graduate fellow in infant-parent mental health. She had been employed as a bilingual clinician at Star Vista, an agency that provides counseling, crisis prevention, youth housing and other programs to people in San Mateo County, according to her Facebook page.\n\nEmma Louis-Dreyfus was a “brilliant, progressive thinker and supporter of social justice,” her obituary said. In addition to enjoying a career that involved helping other people, she also had an entrepreneurial spirit. The Daily Mail reported that in July she set up a company, Etta Duane Industries, for the purpose of developing property for marijuana production in California. She had invested $4.5 million into the project.\n\nIn addition to work, Emma Louis-Dreyfus loved to travel and to get into the outdoors, particularly in the Sierra Nevada and the Tetons, her obituary said, adding that one of her favorite getaways was the Yuba River."
