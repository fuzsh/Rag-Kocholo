        "text": "Saturday is Town Cleanup day; TMHS Theater Co. announces its fall musical\n\nDineout season is in full swing, and the Carnation is collecting listings in our new Community Calendar. By eating in or ordering from a restaurant taking part in a dineout, the student group gets 10% to 20% of your purchase as a donation. It’s a good idea to mention the group when ordering. And if you’d like your noncommercial event listed, drop us a line at tewksburycarnation@gmail.com.\n\nOn Saturday, about 28 volunteers came together to sort and reshelve hundreds of books in the Ryan school library. Damaged and duplicate volumes were weeded out to make room for new acquisitions. Extra books may be offered on an honor cart for students to take home.\n\nLibrarians Jen Burke, center in photo, and Theresa Troiano, left, led the effort. With Burke and Troiano is TMHS student Skye-Bryana Tambi, who spent the day helping out.\n\n“I’m blown away,” said Burke. “Everybody came together, from NHS and DECA students to parents with kids in the school to retired volunteers. It was nice. Everybody was working as a team to get this done.”\n\nBurke also thanked those who dropped off snacks, including School Committee member Katie Anderson, and DECA advisor Jim Sullivan, who helped out with directing students as they reshelved the entire nonfiction section. Several retirees expressed interest in volunteering on an ongoing basis, she said, adding that the town includes shelving books in its senior and veterans tax work off program. While the elementary schools and high school have staff librarians, the Ryan library is run by volunteers. The Wynn library has been out of service since Covid.\n\nResidents who want to help out can learn more by contacting Suzanne Caliendo in the Ryan School office, at scaliendo@tewksbury.k12.ma.us. All school volunteers need to have active CORI forms (download here) on file. Once completed, forms can be emailed to Caliendo or brought into the school. Tiffany Troxell is in charge of volunteer scheduling and can be reached at ryanschoollibrary@gmail.com.\n\nIn other school news, TMHS Theater Company will present High School Musical as its fall show. The dates are Nov. 17, 18 and 19, and tickets are now on sale. The troupe’s spring show, Mamma Mia, sold out, so grab your seats early. You can also support the theater program in its Kyoto dineout this Wednesday.\n\nFinally, trash collection will be delayed one day this week, and branch collection runs through Oct. 14.
