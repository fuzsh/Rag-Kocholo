No.\n\n[Julia] Saturday Night Live.\n\nI was going to school at Northwestern University,\n\nand I was doing a show in downtown Chicago\n\nwith The Practical Theater Company\n\nbetween my Junior and Senior year of college.\n\nAnd unbeknownst to me,\n\nwere the producers of SNL in the audience.\n\nAnd after that particular show ended, they came backstage\n\nand they offered all of us a job on Saturday Night Live.\n\nSo we're like, Yeah, good.\n\nSo that was it, I flew the coop.\n\nThe first sketch that I was ever in on SNL was\n\na sketch actually with Chevy Chase as the shark,\n\nbut he was doing it remotely.\n\nAnd so it was sort of like, like a television screen\n\ninside the mouth of a shark.\n\nAnd it was one of the, you know, candy-gram kind of thing.\n\nIt was completely surreal.\n\nI came to SNL at the age of 21,\n\nI was unbelievable naive.\n\nI had really done very little professional theater.\n\nOnly Second City and Practical Theater in Chicago.\n\nI had no idea about this business of show.\n\nIt was a very male dominated,\n\nmale centric environment there.\n\nIn addition to the fact that everybody was completely high\n\non any drug that they could get their hands on.\n\nAnd I had no idea.\n\nI learned quick.\n\nIt was not exactly what I thought it was going to be.\n\nLarry David and I were both at SNL together,\n\nand he was there my third year.\n\nWe were both miserable together,\n\nand we bonded over our misery.\n\nAnd we've been miserable ever since.\n\nI came back to host I think in 2006,\n\nand I was really quite happy to do it.\n\nI mean it was an interesting experience,\n\nbecause I had been there.\n\nSort of like, it's like going back to high school\n\nand being able to relive certain moments\n\nthat spin around in your head.\n\nSo I knew how the show worked,\n\nI knew how to navigate it.\n\nIt wasn't unknown to me, it wasn't,\n\nit was really really fun.\n\nAnd furthermore when I went back\n\nit was being produced by Lorne Michaels,\n\nand it was very female friendly.\n\nTina and Amy and Kristen and Maya, they were all there.\n\nSo I had an absolute ball.\n\nMy big takeaway from being on SNL was that\n\nI was only going to do jobs that were pure fun\n\nfrom thereon out as simplistic as that sounds.\n\nThat's not something that's always so easily attained,\n\nbut that was my goal.\n\nAnd I have for the most part.\n\n[jazz music]\n\nAll right who's dancing?\n\nCome on who's dancing?\n\nDo you want me, do you want me to get it started?\n\nI'll get it started.\n\n[guests cheering]\n\nAll right, whoo\n\n♪ When you wish upon a star ♪\n\n[audience laughing]\n\n♪ Ya dreams will take if very far yeah ♪\n\n[claps]\n\nWhoo\n\n[Elaine] Come on guys, what's the hold up?\n\n[clap]\n\n♪ Life ain't always- ♪\n\nSweet fancy Moses. [audience laughing]\n\nI became involved with The Seinfeld Chronicles\n\nas it was called early on.\n\nThey had made a pilot, I was not in the pilot.\n\nAnd then it came to my attention,\n\nthat NBC had picked up this show The Seinfeld Chronicles\n\nfor four episodes.\n\nLarry David was writing it and, Would I be interested?\n\nSo I read a couple of the episodes and I thought,\n\nOh, wow, this doesn't sound like anything on television.\n\nIt definitely had a different voice.\n\nA different rhythm than any sitcom at that period of time.\n\nSo I went in and I met with Jer\n\nand we got along really well.\n\nAnd of course Larry was an old friend of mine.\n\nAnd so I signed up to do it.\n\nI remember thinking back\n\nwhen we first started doing the show\n\nfor those first four episodes.\n\nAnd I remember thinking,\n\nThis show is so good and the network is going to be\n\nso stupid to cancel it.\n\nBecause I figured they would let it go.\n\nYou know a four order, four episode order\n\nis hardly a seal of approval from the network.\n\nIt felt like they were just burning off a commitment.\n\nI just figured we were goners.\n\nBut we weren't.\n\nI had lots of thoughts about Elaine,\n\nand she was one of four characters,\n\nand it was very important to me\n\nthat she was not just the girl.\n\nAnd she wasn't written as the girl.\n\nAnd so I sort of took that and ran with it.\n\nShe was, I don't know if this is,\n\nprobably not quite right to say,\n\nbut she was one of the guys, except she was a girl.\n\nThe Elaine dance is from this episode\n\ncalled The Little Kicks.\n\nAnd, um, it was just written that,\n\nElaine danced really badly.\n\nAnd so, the night before the table read I had the script\n\nand frankly, I just stood in front of the mirror,\n\nand tried to do movements that looked incredibly bad.\n\nAnd I had a few of them,\n\nand I remember my mom was staying with us at the time\n\nand I came downstairs and I sort of auditioned these\n\ndifferent [laughs]\n\ndifferent movements for my mom and my husband.\n\nAnd they all voted on the one that, that uh, that I did.\n\nSo there you go.\n\nPeople approach me about the dance all the time.\n\nI say, Oh thank you so much, no I'm not gonna do it.\n\n[laughing off screen]\n\nI don't have a favorite episode,\n\nI had many episodes that I loved.\n\nYou know, we did that show for nine years\n\nand it evolved so much over the time,\n\nover that period of time.\n\nSo I mean, you know, early on, the episode The Deal,\n\nI loved The Soup Nazi,\n\nI of course I loved The Little Kicks,\n\nI loved The Mango episode,\n\nI mean it goes, Puerto Rican Day Parade.\n\nI have a million shows that,\n\nI mean I'm actually a fan of the show.\n\nSo I like a lot of the episodes, yeah.\n\nJerry and I are really good friends.\n\nAnd still are to this day.\n\nAnd just to sort of harken back to what I learned at SNL,\n\nwe were having a really good time on that show all the time.\n\nIf it made us laugh, it made it into the show.\n\nSo that was true of rehearsal,\n\nit was true of the writing process,\n\nit was true of improvising.\n\nAnd we were just trying to make each other laugh.\n\nAnd that was a really good,\n\nshall we say, equation for a kind of excellence.\n\nI learned so much that I, I learned about comedy,\n\nI learned more about timing.\n\nIt was just more training in performing.\n\nAnd more training in frankly even producing.\n\nI didn't produce Seinfeld, but I watched.\n\nSo I learned a lot that I took with me moving forward.\n\n[Queen Ant] Now what do we do?\n\n[Princess Atta] Oh don't tell me, I know it, I know it.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nWe relax.\n\n[laughs] Right.\n\nOh--\n\n[Julia] A Bugs Life\n\nMy friends at Pixar invited me to come in,\n\nand they wanted me to, they wanted to hear my voice.\n\nI wanna say it was for a different character,\n\nif I'm remembering this correctly.\n\nAnd we were just sort of playing around\n\nand then all of a sudden they asked me to read\n\nthese lines of Atta Ant,\n\nand the next thing I know they were asked me to do\n\nthe one of the lead voices.\n\nWhich I was delighted to do.\n\nI haven't really ever done voice overwork before.\n\nI hesitate to think what it sounds like,\n\nI don't know if it was good or not.\n\n'Cause it was all new to me.\n\nBut it was certainly a great deal of fun.\n\nIt's entirely different from being on camera.\n\nWell for starters you can come in your sweat pants\n\nand you don't have to wear any makeup.\n\nBut you have no other tool but your voice.\n\nSo your voice has to inform everything,\n\nwhich is a very different way of performing\n\nthan any other kind of performing.\n\nIt has to tell the full story, your voice.\n\nSo it means you have to sort of explore things\n\nvocally that you might not do otherwise.\n\nWhat I love most about Princess Atta,\n\nwas that she was strong, she was aggressive,\n\nshe was a fighter, she wasn't just looking for a prince.\n\nWhich I liked.\n\n[piano music]\n\nLar, the guy came,\n\nI got an estimate and it's gonna cost 500 bucks\n\nto fix that table, the ring.\n\nI--\n\nYes you did.\n\nCome one man, yes you did.\n\nPlease don't play this game with me.\n\nI would tell you if I left it.\n\nI respect wood, I revere wood.\n\nI'm considerate of wood.\n\nOh, I got involved with Curbed\n\nbecause Lar just called and said, Would ya do it?\n\nAnd I said, Yeah sure.\n\n[laughs]\n\nI did a number of episodes, um, as myself.\n\nAnd then, later we sort of did this kind of,\n\nour version of a Seinfeld reunion,\n\nwithin the structure of Curbed.\n\nThat was crazy fun.\n\n'Cause we all got back together again,\n\nthey rebuilt the set.\n\nAnd sort of jerry-rigged it to,\n\nJerry-rigged, ha, that's funny.\n\nIt was sort of a modern version of the Seinfeld apartment.\n\nAnd that was fun, it was really a great time for all of us.\n\nAnd to be able to play Elaine,\n\nand then to also play me, working on playing Elaine.\n\nThat was kind of bizarre and kind of meta, but cool.\n\nIt's kind of what I'm doing right now, talking to camera.\n\nThis is a version of myself, but it's not the real me.\n\nOne of my most favorite memories\n\nof that time during Curbed\n\nwas Bob Einstein played the character of Marty Funkhouser.\n\nAnd I remember [laughs] that he came on to set\n\nand he told the most foul joke.\n\nAnd it was so hilarious and it got, by the way,\n\ncompletely folded into the show.\n\nI think it's in the cut.\n\nI was doubled over laughing,\n\nit was so inappropriate and wonderful.\n\nI encourage all of you to go and try to find that\n\nand see how offended you might become.\n\n[cheerful music]\n\nWe have your Honor\n\n[funky music]\n\nWe've got Lizer.\n\n[Narrator] Yes, Maggie was the most feared prosecutor\n\nin all of Orange County.\n\nAnd therefore I would like\n\nto bring your attention to exhibit A.\n\nMitch Hurwitz reached out to me,\n\nhe said he was writing this character named Maggie Lizer,\n\nwho was pretending that she was blind.\n\nSo already it was like, Oh, that sounds super interesting.\n\nAnd I was a fan of the show.\n\nSo I said, Great, I'll do it.\n\nSo I went and did a number of episodes.\n\nI had a ball.\n\nIt was harder to do than you might think.\n\nBecause I did it with my eyes crossed the whole time,\n\nand believe it or not\n\nwhen your not actually looking at someone\n\nand talking to them in the scene,\n\nbecause you can't really see 'em,\n\n'cause your eyes are crossed.\n\nIt makes it much harder to learn lines.\n\nAt least it did for me.\n\nBut maybe I'm just not that intelligent.\n\nAnd that's a possibility.\n\nBut it was super fun.\n\nYears later when I was doing Veep\n\nand people came up to me and to Tony Hale\n\nand said, Oh, you guys were both on Arrested together,\n\ndid you have scenes together?\n\nAnd both Tony and I said, No we didn't,\n\nwe never got a chance to work together.\n\nWell guess what?\n\nWe did work together.\n\nAnd we had both forgotten it.\n\nSomebody showed us a picture, we had a scene together.\n\nNeither of us remembered it.\n\nSo you can see we made a extraordinarily positive\n\nimpression on one another.\n\n[laughing off screen]\n\n[audience laughing]\n\n[crying noises]\n\nI'm done here.\n\nNo, no wait, Barb, oh my god.\n\nAre you okay, what happened to you?\n\nThe guy I picked up at the wedding\n\nwas an immigration officer.\n\nHe's trying to ship me back to the Bahamas.\n\nOh, that's horrible.\n\nI had a bad time too.\n\n[audience laughing]\n\nThe Old Christine script was sent to me\n\nby Warner Brothers and I liked it very much.\n\nI met with Kari Lizer who wrote and created the show.\n\nShe and I got along right away,\n\nand yeah, and so off we went\n\nto make this series for five years.\n\nAnd we had lots of wonderful actors on the show\n\nincluding Wanda Sykes and Clark Gregg and Hamish Linklater.\n\nAnd the show itself was run by a bunch of women.\n\nWhich was very refreshing.\n\nHuge number of uh, female writers\n\nand a lot of female producers.\n\nUh, myself included.\n\nAnd a lot of working mothers, I will point that out too.\n\nSo we got done with work always early,\n\neverybody got home in time to make dinner,\n\ndrive carpool, work on homework, you know whatever it was.\n\nI liked the disfunction of Old Christine.\n\nI liked the disfunction of the family relationships,\n\nand uh, the premise of her ex-husband\n\ngoing out with a woman with the same name, who is younger.\n\nAnd living with her brother.\n\nIt just all felt kind of messy.\n\nAnd people trying to do the right thing,\n\nbut screwing up constantly.\n\nThe idea of a mother who was constantly screwing up\n\nwas appealing to me.\n\n[soft music]\n\nWanna kiss?\n\nYeah.\n\n[soft music]\n\nI became involved with Enough Said,\n\nbecause I met with Nicole Holofcener.\n\nI had read the script, loved it.\n\nI met with her, we talked, we meshed really well.\n\nAnd then she offered me this part.\n\nAnd um, so I was sort of,\n\nor I was the first person cast in the movie.\n\nWe got along really well,\n\nI realized I haven't talked to her in a while,\n\nI need to talk to her because she's a good friend of mine.\n\nBut I love that woman.\n\nAnd then uh, Jim Gandolfini wanted to do the movie.\n\nAnd there we go,\n\noff we went to this heartbreaking film.\n\nWhich I think it is actually.\n\nAnd Jim was utterly charming.\n\nSurprisingly lacked a lot of confidence.\n\nWhich was very surprising to me.\n\nThis huge impressive person,\n\nhe was a little bit shy.\n\nAnd a little bit tentative doing comedy.\n\nSo that was fun to work with him on it\n\nand sort of you know,\n\nkick him in the ass to get him going.\n\nAnd that was really fun, we had a good time.\n\nVery labor intensive and it took a lot of emotional stuff.\n\nBut it was stuff I liked doing.\n\nNevada's my state, I'm gonna be president\n\nI'm gonna be the first elected lady president.\n\nI'm gonna have a lovely inauguration.\n\nBilly Joel is gonna sing.\n\nMy agent told me they were developing a show\n\nover at HBO about a female, unhappy vice-president.\n\nAnd I was like, Bam, were do I sign up?\n\nThat was all I needed to hear.\n\nAnd that Armando Iannucci was writing and creating it.\n\nThis was all, this was his brain child.\n\nAnd I knew his work from The Loop In the Loop.\n\nWhich is a movie I had seen staring James Gandolfini\n\nthat Armando had done.\n\nAnd was nominated for an Academy Award for\n\nas a matter of fact.\n\nAnd so, I met with Armando,\n\nwe were supposed to meet for about 45 minutes\n\nto talk about it.\n\nAnd it turned into a three hour work session,\n\nit couldn't have been more fun.\n\nPitching ideas, talking about you know,\n\nI grew up part of my life in Washington, D.C.\n\nSo a huge part of my childhood was spent there.\n\nSo I really, there's an understanding that I have\n\nof inside the beltway, as we call it, of D.C.\n\nthat I sort of could bring to the conversation.\n\nIn addition to the fact\n\nthat I've done a lot of political work,\n\nand so I've sort of seen behind the curtain a lot.\n\nAnd that was very useful too.\n\nSo we had a great time.\n\nI immediately thought he was a genius,\n\nwhich of course he is.\n\nAnd uh, off we went.\n\nAnd we made it um, over at HBO,\n\nwhich was like a dream for me.\n\nReally nice to get away from network television,\n\ntruth be told and have more creative freedom.\n\nMy god, it was incredible.\n\nIt's been the most incredible ride of my life.\n\nWe did so much research to prepare for the show.\n\nI mean in addition to meeting vice-presidents,\n\nwe met with lobbyists, we met with congressmen\n\nand congresswomen, and senators, and chiefs of staff,\n\nand secretary of this, secretary of that, schedulers.\n\nI mean across the board we met so many people.\n\nAnd got to tour the Eisenhower Building,\n\nspent time in the actual White House,\n\nand the Oval Office in fact.\n\nI mean we did a ton of behind the scenes work.\n\nWhich really really reaped many rewards.\n\nThe thing that I'll miss most about playing Selina\n\nis she really was a toddler trapped\n\nin a middle-aged woman's body.\n\nAnd there was something, very fabulous about that\n\nbecause how a toddler thinks the world revolves around them\n\nand how a toddler has a tantrum every couple times a day\n\nwhen they don't get their way.\n\nWell that's how Selina behaved.\n\nAnd it was accepted by everybody who worked for her.\n\nAnd she blamed everybody for her faults.\n\nAlso that was accepted.\n\nSo that was from a comedic point of view.\n\nThat was just so ripe with opportunity.\n\nAnd so I will miss that actually.\n\nI will miss playing that kind of character\n\nwho was reckless, uh emotionally.\n\nI was very happy with our finale.\n\nI think we kind of,\n\nI hope we gave the fans what they wanted.\n\nWe certainly worked hard and blood, sweat, tears\n\nand more tears were poured into that finale.\n\nI think that it worked out really well.\n\nUm in the sense that\n\nSelina got what she though she wanted.\n\nIn so doing, she\n\ngives up things,\n\npeople, not things, people,\n\nwho are the most important to her.\n\nAnd she's left with that.\n\nAnd that felt exactly right.\n\nMy point is, is that laughter is a basic human need,\n\nalong with love, and food and an HBO subscription.\n\n[audience laughter]\n\nThere's no situation, none,\n\nthat isn't improved with a couple of laughs.\n\nEverybody needs laughs.\n\nSo the fact that I have had the opportunity\n\nto make people laugh for a living\n\nis one of the many blessings\n\nthat I have received in my life.\n\nWhen I first was notified about the Mark Twain Prize\n\nI thought that they were emailing me to present it\n\nto another person.\n\nAnd I was like, Oh, my God, I can't fly all the way to D.C.\n\nI'm in the middle of production,\n\nI don't, to present an award.\n\nAnd then I realized they were actually asking me\n\nif I wanted to receive the award.\n\nAnd I was like, Oh, my God, I can't believe it,\n\nof course I wanna take that award.\n\nAnd it was a incredibly lovely night,\n\nI will say there was a lot of pressure,\n\nbecause when they give you an award such as that for comedy,\n\nthen you're asked to make a, you know, 10, 15 minute speech.\n\nSo it's like they give you the award,\n\nand then it's now like, prove it, prove you can really,\n\nyou're really deserving of this trophy.\n\nSo there was a lot of, you know,\n\nGod Almighty, I worked so hard on that speech\n\nand I was very nervous about it.\n\nBut it was a very warm room,\n\nit was surprisingly emotional.\n\nI had a lot of really good friends show up,\n\nto make speeches and so on.\n\nAnd it was, it was just,\n\nit was a night I will never ever forget.\n\nBut there's one person who was happier about that night\n\nthan anybody else in the whole world.\n\nAnd that was my mother.\n\nMy mother was so out of her mind, she was just beaming.\n\nAnd she actually told me afterwards,\n\nit was the happiest night of her life. [laughs]\n\nand no offense to Mark Twain, but you know,\n\nother things have happened in her life.\n\nBut she really, she really had a good time [laughter]\n\n[woman mumbles offscreen]\n\nShe did, she told me, I was like, Mom, come on.\n\nThe comedy that I've done\n\nhas been just sort of a happy accident.\n\nBecause I'm an actress, I'm not a comedian per se.\n\nWhen looking back at my career choices,\n\nwould I change anything?\n\nOf course I would change things,\n\nbut I'm not gonna delve into that,\n\nI'm not gonna delve into a list of regrets.\n\nYeah, there's tons I would change,\n\nbut I'm very happy with where I am right now.\n\nI consider myself to be very lucky.\n\nWe'll just leave it at that.\n\nI hope this interview goes on for 20 more years.\n\nI wanna be on this apple box 20 years from now,\n\nanswering more questions about myself. [laughs]\n\n[woman mumbles offscreen]"
