        "text": "Julia Louis-Dreyfus gets a fantastical visitor while caring for her ailing daughter in the first trailer for the A24 drama Tuesday.\n\nA24 released the trailer Thursday for Daina Oniunas-Pusic’s feature, which does not yet have an announced release date. Tuesday centers on Zora (Louis-Dreyfus) and her terminally ill daughter, Tuesday (Lola Petticrew), who meet Death in the form of a talking and size-shifting bird voiced by Arinzé Kene.\n\n“Madam, you need to say goodbye to your daughter,” Death says calmly in the footage. “Life — every life — ends.”\n\nLater, Zora has trouble coming to terms with saying goodbye. “I don’t know what I am without you, who I am without you,” she tells Tuesday. “I don’t know what the world is without you in it.”\n\nOniunas-Pusic wrote and directed Tuesday, which premiered at the Telluride Film Festival in September. Helen Gladders, Ivana MacKinnon and Oliver Roskill serve as producers.\n\nIn her review for The Hollywood Reporter, film critic Sheri Linden wrote that Tuesday “is a straightforward, uncluttered fusion of mother-child drama and magic realism. In what is essentially a three-hander, Death is a world-weary macaw who can shrink and grow effortlessly, an outstanding VFX creation voiced with engaging seriousness and heart by Arinzé Kene (I’m Your Woman).”\n\nLouis-Dreyfus starred in the 2023 releases You People and You Hurt My Feelings. The Seinfeld alum is set to appear in Marvel Studios’ Thunderbolts, which currently holds a July 2025 release date.\n\nPetticrew’s credits include roles in the crime series Bloodlands and the 2022 movie She Said."
