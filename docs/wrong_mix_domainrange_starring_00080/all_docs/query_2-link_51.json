        "text": "17 Disney Channel Scenes That Literally Give Me Secondhand Embarrassment To Watch\n\n\"Totally blingalicious!\"\n\nSo many of us grew up on iconic Disney Channel shows like Wizards of Waverly Place, Hannah Montana, and Lizzie McGuire, and movies like High School Musical and Camp Rock.\n\nBut there were certainly moments then — and especially looking back now — that made you go like this:\n\nHere are just a few moments from Disney Channel shows and original movies that just had a serious cringe factor.\n\n1. First, you already know I gotta start with the classic...Debby Ryan's face from Radio Rebel.\n\n2. Loretta's dance moves during \"Nothing's Wrong With Me\" in Pixel Perfect were truly something else.\n\n3. Lemonade Mouth was a solid film, tbh, but Stella's off-rhythm clap-dancing in the detention scene was...not it.\n\n4. Camp Rock has SO MANY, but my favorite's got to be Caitlyn playing the keyboard and dancing and Mitchie going, \"She's really good!\"\n\n5. Though a close second's gotta be when Mitchie calls Tess's bracelet \"so blingalicious.\"\n\n6. This dance-off in Cadet Kelly is absolutely iconic, but also one of the more cringey things I've seen in my life.\n\n7. Who can forget this iconic Life With Derek scene where Disney Channel was 100% trying to get us to ship these two RELATED characters.\n\n8. If you have never seen The Suite Life Movie, you're missing out on scenes like this, where Zack and Cody awkwardly circle each other and hit themselves.\n\n9. Or when they turned into weird, glowing versions of themselves and fought for twin superiority.\n\n10. But nothing beats when Cody ran his fingers down a machine in the lab and affectionately (and kinda sexually???) said, \"Shh, baby, don't speak.\"\n\n11. I absolutely HATE this Jessie moment when Zuri and Jessie switched bodies and Luke said he was attracted to his sister in disguise.\n\n12. Look, \"Bet on It\" is by far the best song of the High School Musical franchise. Mostly because watching Zac Efron run SUPER dramatically around a golf course is just so darn cringey while also being incredibly entertaining.\n\n13. Remember when Troy gave Gabriella a necklace with his first initial on it in High School Musical 2?\n\n14. Okay, so at the end of The Cheetah Girls, Toto couldn't hear the girls shouting, but when they start singing quietly, the firefighter's all like, \"OMG, IT'S WORKING\"?!? I just can't deal with the cheesiness.\n\n15. You may have seen this iconic Camp Rock 2 march/dance scene pop up on TikTok, where people hilariously edit it into other scenes.\n\n16. I remember freaking out over Aaron Carter kissing Lizzie in Lizzie McGuire when I was younger, but looking back...it is one of the most awkward things I've ever seen.\n\n17. But finally, the most awkward Disney Channel moment? Hilary Duff's \"You're watching Disney Channel\" outtakes.\n\nWhat Disney Channel moments always make YOU cringe?
