        "text": "Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who returns Sunday, April 24, as President Selina Meyer on the fifth season of HBO’s “Veep,” began her TV career as an ensemble member of “Saturday Night Live.” (She returned to “SNL” as host of its April 16 show.) Here are five things to know about her 1982-85 “SNL” stint:\n\nHer performance with Chicago’s Practical Theatre Company at its “Golden 50th Anniversary Jubilee” led to her being asked to join “SNL.” She was hired with two other troupe members, Gary Kroeger and Brad Hall, her future husband.\n\nAt 21, she was the youngest female cast member in the show’s history at that time.\n\nOn the show, she impersonated ’80s celebrities including Marie Osmond, original MTV VJ Nina Blackwood, Diana Ross, NBC journalist Linda Ellerbee and Mary Travers of Peter, Paul and Mary. She also impersonated Darla from “The Little Rascals.”\n\nCharacters she played included April May June, a Southern beauty queen televangelist; Weather Woman from the “superhero” group “The Interesting Four”; and Patti Lynn Hunnsacker, the “Teen News Correspondent” for “Saturday Night News.”\n\nHer years on the show were a bittersweet experience. The bitter: “I thought it was going to be a congenial experience; my head was in the clouds,” she told the authors of the “SNL” history, “Live From New York. “I wasn’t aware of the politicking one had to do.” The sweet: She first met Larry David, an “SNL” writer from 1984-85, who would cast her a few years later as Elaine Benes on “Seinfeld.”"
