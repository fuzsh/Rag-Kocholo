        "text": "I had the wonderful opportunity once\n\nto meet Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan.\n\nAnd she told me,\n\nthis was back when Antonin Scalia was still alive,\n\nthat she and Scalia would get together once a week\n\nand have lunch and talk about the episode\n\nthat had just been on,\n\n'cause they were both getting such a kick out of it.\n\nThat was like a trophy in and of itself.\n\nHi, I'm Julia Louis-Dreyfus,\n\nand I'm going to revisit some scenes\n\nfrom throughout my career.\n\nPray for me.\n\n[energetic music]\n\n[pulsing music]\n\nGo on, leave!\n\nGet out!\n\nBut I didn't do anything.\n\nNext!\n\n[audience laughing]\n\nHello.\n\n[audience laughing]\n\nYou.\n\nThis is obviously an iconic episode of Seinfeld.\n\nThis was based on a real guy in New York\n\nwho was referred to as the Soup Nazi there, apparently.\n\nI never went by there and got soup\n\nfrom him because I was too frightened.\n\nI don't know if you noticed,\n\nbut at the beginning of that clip,\n\nthat was on Ana Gasteyer,\n\nwho was in the very beginning of the scene.\n\nIncidentally, on Ana Gasteyer was\n\nin the same class with my sister,\n\nand I babysat her and my sister when she was little.\n\nSo go figure.\n\nThe other thing I was struck by,\n\nwatching this, is my voice has changed.\n\nMy voice was higher back then\n\nthan it is now.\n\nThan it is now.\n\nI don't want soup.\n\nI can make my own soup.\n\nFive cups chopped porcini mushrooms,\n\nhalf a cup of olive oil,\n\nthree pound celery.\n\nThat is my recipe for a wild mushroom.\n\nYeah, that's right.\n\nI do know that after this episode aired and the Soup Nazi,\n\nI don't know what its real, the real name\n\nof his establishment was in New York.\n\nObviously it wasn't the Soup Nazi.\n\nAll of a sudden, he got crazy business.\n\nLines were out the door forever and ever and ever.\n\nAnd evidently Jerry went in after the fact,\n\nand he was livid with Jerry\n\nbecause he didn't want this business.\n\nThis was not the, he just,\n\nit was making his life a horror\n\nbecause it was too much work.\n\nThat's what I was told.\n\nYou're through, Soup Nazi.\n\n[audience laughing]\n\nPack it up.\n\nNo more soup for you.\n\nNext!\n\n[audience laughing]\n\nAny job is great training\n\nif you're paying attention as an actor.\n\nAnd that certainly was the case working on Seinfeld\n\nbecause, first of all,\n\nI was surrounded by these comic geniuses.\n\nWe were all working together,\n\nand I think learning from one another.\n\nBut really, honestly,\n\nI learned a lot watching Michael and Jason.\n\nAnd Jerry and Larry were incredibly hard workers\n\nand really killed themselves making this show.\n\nSo I witnessed all of that,\n\nand I got a good understanding\n\nof what it meant to produce\n\nand what the value was in producing.\n\nAnd that's why I, in my subsequent jobs,\n\nI was always producing.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nOh, what about that?\n\n[Gary gasps] Respect.\n\nYou know, the Aretha Franklin song?\n\nYes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nThat would be great. Hey, Mike.\n\nMike [glass shattering]\n\nOkay, so that was from season two, episode nine.\n\nThis episode was called Running.\n\nThis was actually a very hard shot to get\n\nbecause it was multiple special effects.\n\nIf I recall correctly,\n\nit was like plexi and then breakaway glass.\n\nAnd so what I was doing was banging\n\ninto the plexi and then they had these squibs\n\nthat were gonna make the breakaway glass shatter.\n\nBut we were having trouble with the timing of it.\n\nWe had four breakaway sort of setups.\n\nAnd on each of the first three that we tried,\n\nthe glass would shatter too late.\n\nSo I'd walk into it,\n\nand then it would be seconds, seconds, brr, like that!\n\nAnd so it absolutely did not work.\n\nAnd people were really wringing their hands\n\nbecause this was a very expensive setup to create.\n\nAnd we were on our final breakaway glass.\n\nAnd in this instance, it worked.\n\nThank God.\n\nPrior to this moment,\n\nI'm talking to my team about the music\n\nthat I want playing when I'm coming out\n\nand announcing my run.\n\nWhat about that?\n\nRespect.\n\nYou know, the Aretha Franklin song?\n\nYes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nThat would be great. Hey, Mike!\n\nMike. [glass shattering]\n\n[Julia laughing]\n\nI was particularly pleased with that choice\n\nbecause I thought it was a lovely juxtaposition\n\nto walking through a glass door.\n\nOh my God. Duchess is down.\n\nDuchess is down.\n\nYellow, yellow.\n\nI repeat, Duchess is down.\n\nGo, Rick. Go, go, go, go, go!\n\n[gasps] Oh God, your face.\n\n[Aide] We're gonna need a medic.\n\nIs it bad?\n\nNo. Yes!\n\nKaren Kawahara, my makeup artist,\n\nwho created all the, my bloody face,\n\nwe wanted that to look as real as possible,\n\nbut not so terrifying that all of a sudden\n\nthe comedy is sucked out of the scene.\n\nSo it was an artful job that she did\n\nwith the amount of blood and cuts on my face\n\nto make it just right.\n\nAnd then having my face covered\n\nand coming up and revealing.\n\nI mean, Tony Hale, he's incorrigible.\n\nHe can never not laugh in a scene,\n\nso in this case, we, again, had to do multiple takes\n\nbecause Tony was just.\n\nI mean, it was hilarious to come up\n\noutta here and then be covered in blood\n\nand say, How do I look? [laughing]\n\nIt was.\n\nThat was a lot of fun to shoot.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI am about to become president.\n\nOf America. [laughing]\n\n[Gary crying]\n\nNo, no, no, no.\n\nOh, don't cry.\n\nDon't cry.\n\nYour nose is bleeding.\n\n[Gary sobbing]\n\nYou're bleeding.\n\nOh my God, your bleeding.\n\nGeorgia Pritchett, who was one of our producers\n\nand writers on Veep, wrote this particular episode.\n\nWhat happens to Georgia Pritchett\n\nwhen she gets excited or over stimulated\n\nor overcome with emotion,\n\nshe gets nose bleeds.\n\nSo she wrote that into the show.\n\nAnd then, when we were doing the first table read\n\nof this script, the reading went really well,\n\nand she was overcome.\n\nSo she got a nose bleed in the middle\n\nof the table reading and had to exit the premises.\n\nI hope she doesn't mind my telling that story,\n\nbut I've told it, so cat's outta the bag.\n\nWhen I get excited, Put your head back.\n\nmy nose bleeds. Well, that's good.\n\nWait, let me get you a pa.\n\nOh, shit.\n\nGary, there's [laughing]\n\nthere's no toilet paper. Oh my God.\n\nI love so many things about this.\n\nI love that Gary is treating me like a mental patient.\n\nSo I think that's hilarious.\n\nAnd then, it's also ironic\n\nbecause Tony Hale and I,\n\nthroughout the entire run of this show Veep.\n\nwere constantly laughing and had lots\n\nof trouble keeping our shit together doing these scenes\n\n'cause we were just enjoying the scenes so much,\n\nthrough all the seasons.\n\nIn this scene, in which we had to\n\nbecome hysterical laughing,\n\nit was brutally difficult to do.\n\nAnd I remember after every take we'd just look\n\nat each other and just drop it and go like,\n\nOh my God, that is so hard.\n\nGo in my bag. No paper.\n\nWhat? Go in my bag.\n\nThere's tissue in my bag.\n\n[Gary coughing]\n\n[Selina] Okay.\n\nIt's in the side pocket. What?\n\nWhere is it? It's in the outer.\n\nIt's in the outer pocket. What is this,\n\nwhat is this for?\n\nOh shit, that looks bad through here.\n\nWe chose a bunch of different things\n\nto go into that bag.\n\nThat was really fun.\n\nWe went to our prop department,\n\nand we were going through a table trying to figure out\n\nwhat would be believable\n\nbut somewhat incongruous items\n\nto have in the bag that we could pull out.\n\nIt's also interesting to see\n\nbecause Selina is so nurturing for a brief moment of Gary.\n\nThat doesn't last, of course, but anyway.\n\nI felt very responsible for Veep.\n\nI loved doing the show.\n\nIt was an enormous amount of work,\n\nbut it was a true labor of love.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nMore guacamole?\n\nNo, not for me.\n\nYes, I'd love some actually.\n\nDo you know how many calories are in guacamole?\n\n10. [chuckles]\n\nLay off the guy.\n\nHe likes his guacamole.\n\nYou know what?\n\nUh, we don't need the guac.\n\nI'll just stick with the cheese.\n\n[Eva chuckles]\n\nI drank like three bottles of wine\n\nbefore we shot this.\n\nNo, I'm kidding. [laughs]\n\nNo.\n\nSo my character of Eva has become friends\n\nwith Albert's ex-wife.\n\nWhat happens is she's getting information, intel,\n\nabout her boyfriend that is pretty negative.\n\nAnd so it's all starting to come out in this scene.\n\nShe's drinking too much,\n\nand she's just tone deaf.\n\nYou're picking on him.\n\nNo, I'm not.\n\nYou are. Huh?\n\nNo.\n\nYou kind of are.\n\nOkay, I'm sorry.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nI've just never in my entire life\n\nhave I met anybody who couldn't whisper.\n\nWhen I'm doing a scene like this,\n\nwhich was sort of, it was dramatic.\n\nAnd there were many scenes in this movie that were dramatic.\n\nMy sort of knee jerk reaction\n\nwhen I'm working is to find the funny\n\nand explore the nooks and crannies\n\nof the scene with a comic eye.\n\nI didn't know Jim Gandolfini before we made Enough Said,\n\nand I was thrilled to work\n\nwith him because I was such a fan of his.\n\nI really do believe he was like Marlon Brando\n\nin terms of his abilities as an actor.\n\nIn this movie,\n\nthis is actually what he was very much like personally.\n\nHe was a teddy bear.\n\nHe was a tender guy.\n\nAnd so I'm very happy that he made this film,\n\nnot only because I got to work with him,\n\nbut the public got to see him not as a mafia boss\n\nbut as somebody closer to himself,\n\nwho was very vulnerable and very kindhearted.\n\nAlthough I will say that that part of him,\n\nI would say, was very much underneath Tony Soprano.\n\nAnd I would suggest\n\nthat one of the reasons, among many,\n\nthat he was so good at Tony Soprano was that\n\nthat vulnerability was in place.\n\nAnd that made his character much more complicated\n\nand interesting to watch.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nHey, Mom.\n\nWhat?\n\nThis potato salad's so good.\n\nCan I take some of it home with me?\n\nOh, please, I have plenty.\n\nI have too much.\n\nTake some tinfoil.\n\nWhat?\n\nNicole Holofcener, who directed this film,\n\nwe met first on Enough Said.\n\nAnd I loved her\n\npractically from the minute I first met her.\n\nThis was an utter joy to do.\n\nThis day, when we were shooting\n\naround the table and in her kitchen,\n\neverybody was just firing on all cylinders.\n\nI was gonna just put it in one of these things.\n\nYou got like 3,000 of 'em.\n\nNo, no, just wrap it in tinfoil.\n\nOh, that's hilarious.\n\nI'm not going to put potato salad\n\nin tinfoil, Mom.\n\nThat is just, that's totally gross.\n\nIt's crazy.\n\nMom?\n\nAnd by the way, that potato salad was very good, for real.\n\nActually, I am remembering that.\n\nThe food actually was delicious.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\n[Everett] Director de Fontaine?\n\nReally?\n\nWell, agent thinks it was the Wakandans.\n\nWe've been on every one of them\n\nsince they took out our ship.\n\nThat's why I wanted you here.\n\nI met with Kevin Feige\n\nand the fancy people over at Marvel.\n\nWe had a meeting.\n\nThose guys were big Seinfeld fans,\n\nas a matter of fact.\n\nWe talked about Seinfeld a lot. [laughs]\n\nAnd Veep too, as a matter of fact.\n\nAnd I said if anything ever came up,\n\nI'd love to do it.\n\nWhy wouldn't I wanna do it?\n\nIt's a whole other genre.\n\nI think it would be cool for a woman my age\n\nto be in this universe.\n\nAnyway, long story short,\n\nthey called me and they said,\n\nWell, we got something for you.\n\nContessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine is\n\na real character in the comics,\n\nand she's sort of a Nick Fury type.\n\nAnd so I was on board.\n\nI'm really looking forward to delving more\n\ninto her, which I'll be doing later.\n\n[gentle music]\n\nYou're looking good.\n\nOh.\n\nWell, I try.\n\n[Valentina] You put that home gym in?\n\n[Everett] Yeah, last year.\n\nMaybe I'll drop by some time and jump on your Peloton.\n\nI'm gonna be in Thunderbolts.\n\nWe're about to start shooting that momentarily.\n\nAnd Valentina is gonna be quite the force.\n\nI'm looking forward to working with Florence Pugh again\n\nand Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russell, and David Harbour.\n\nI mean, it's a really good group of actors,\n\nand I'm excited about it.\n\nI'm particularly excited about it\n\nbecause it's very character driven this particular movie.\n\nSo I think it'll be fun.\n\nI think Marvel fans will dig it.\n\n[gentle music]\n\nI'm happy that I've been able to do this thing\n\nthat I really wanted to do from a very young age.\n\nAnd the fact that it's worked out is\n\njust such a blessing.\n\nAnd there's so much luck involved.\n\nThings have lined up in just a certain way.\n\nAnd the fact that I'm making a living doing this\n\njust blows my mind.\n\nThis used to be an extracurricular activity\n\nwhen I was in school,\n\nand now it's the job.\n\nI'm thrilled.\n\nOkay.\n\nWell, thanks for watching.\n\n[energetic music]"
