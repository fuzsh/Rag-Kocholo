        "text": "If there is any downside to living in an era when movies about queer people are finally plentiful, it’s that sometimes the best of them are overshadowed by bigger, splashier films and end up getting lost in the mix.\n\nTwo such titles are a pair of indie projects, both of which focus on “outsider” queer characters, newly available on the VOD market after brief-and-limited theatrical runs; each of them deserves a better fate than that.\n\nThe first of these, “Big Boys,” was a major hit in the 2023 queer festival circuit, winning multiple awards (including Outstanding Lead Performance honors for its young star, Isaac Krasner, at LA’s Outfest) and emerging as an audience favorite. It’s easy to see why.\n\nWritten, produced, and directed by Corey Sherman, it’s a small, slice-of-life story centered on Jamie (Krasner), a bright-but-awkward 14-year-old trying to navigate the dual challenges of growing up as a chubby gay-and-closeted teen, who sets out (along with his slick and more confident older brother Will, played by Taj Cross) on a camping trip with favorite cousin Allie (Dora Madison), though he’s initially disappointed when he finds out her new boyfriend Dan (David Johnson III) is also coming along. His attitude changes, however, when the interloper turns out to be a handsome young man who wears his physical “chunkiness” with an easy confidence. Yes, it’s an instant and impossible crush, leading to a weekend adventure that pushes awkward boundaries for all four campers. But aside from his attractiveness, Dan also emerges as a positive role model for Jamie, who begins to find a confidence of his own.\n\nEqual parts bittersweet coming-of-age story and uncomfortable-yet-endearing comedy, Sherman’s movie wins us over early on, largely through the strength of Krasner’s performance; the young actor exhibits not just the comedic chops necessary to get laughs from even his most painful moments, but the vulnerability to make them ring true. Seemingly unafraid of exploring his own identity through his character, he turns in a tour-de-force which stands up to comparison with some of the greatest “young actor breakthrough” performances of all time.\n\nHe’s given an ideal foil in Johnson, whose easygoing charm as Dan still allows us subtle hints of an internal process that keeps him from coming off as callow and clueless – something that pays off well in the film’s quiet-but-heart-stirring climax, which is best left unspoiled here. Madison also provides invaluable support with a performance that captures the conflicted impulses that come between youth and adulthood, and Cross successfully gets past the casual toxicity of his aggressively hetero-centric character to remain sympathetic.\n\nIt’s a stellar collection of performances from an ensemble of relative newcomers, and it goes a long way toward endearing “Big Boys” to a presumably queer audience, which will likely find resonance in the way they each – especially Kasner – convey its theme of trying to claim and define one’s young identity when it goes against the grain of the world around you. But it’s ultimately Sherman, who drew heavily from his own experiences growing up as a plus-size queer kid in creating the film, that deserves full credit – not just for putting it all together, but for having the courage and determination to deliver a queer story that foregoes the glitz and glamour of “gay romance” and connects with the lived experience of viewers who may feel left out of the typically glossy mainstream depictions of queer life.\n\nCut from a similar cloth is “Cora Bora,” starring “Hacks” fan favorite Meg Stalter as the title character, a bisexual musician who might just be the poster child for clueless self-centeredness. Openly rude, unrepentantly shallow, and blatantly manipulative, she steamrolls her way through life seemingly oblivious to the impact her attitude has on others. Having departed her native Portland – and left behind longtime girlfriend Justine (Jojo T. Gibbs), though ostensibly maintaining a “long-distance open relationship” with her – to pursue a music career in Los Angeles, success has proven elusive. She decides to make a surprise visit back home to re-evaluate, only to find that a new girl (Ayden Mayeri) has moved in to take her place. When her attempts to reassert her claim in the household just make matters worse, Cora is forced to recognize that both her professional and personal lives are a shambles – but can she find the humility it will take to get “real” enough to repair them?\n\nDirected by Hannah Pearl Utt from a screenplay by Rhianon Jones, “Cora Bora” also relies heavily on the talents of its star player. Statler, in a turn that lends a darker, more desperate edge to the comedic persona that has made her “Hacks” character one of that show’s biggest assets, is at once monstrous and endearing, a ridiculously broad yet shrewdly-drawn caricature of modern bourgeois boorishness that serves as a fragile cover for something deeper and – without spoiling anything – profoundly traumatic. The journey we take with her is at once hilarious and powerfully affecting, echoing a time-honored comic tradition of transcending pain by finding humor in a pain that feels universal.\n\nShe’s aided by an equally gifted supporting cast, with both Gibbs and Mayeri finding enough heart to keep either of their characters – the other two points of the film’s romantic triangle – from being positioned as a “villain,” and a convincing turn from Manny Jacinto (known for his breakout “himbo” role on TV’s afterlife comedy “The Good Place”), as a character that would otherwise seem too good to be true, lending credibility to an eventual resolution that hinges on a pile of coincidences that would seem absurd without his sincerity. There are also appearances from other familiar faces in cameo roles – such as Margaret Cho as part of a polyamorous commune and Chelsea Peretti as an outraged dog owner – which serve as highlights in a movie already rich with them.\n\nBoth “Big Boys” and “Cora Bora” are linked by a common thread. Each of them features a queer protagonist, of course, but they are outsiders even within their own community. Ultimately, their struggles are born of a perspective that separates them from the rest of the world, a lived experience that others around them do not and cannot fully share. It would be easy enough for either film to make its lead character the butt of the joke, but neither of them makes that choice. The humor comes through their relatability, rather than from their “otherness,” and that makes all the difference. Despite these films’ occasional painfulness, their kindness is what comes shining through – not just toward their misfit characters, but toward the misfits in the audience, too.\n\nFor our money, that’s what the world needs a lot more of these days, and it places these two hidden gems among 2024’s best releases so far.\n\nGreg Berlanti is known as a pioneer in bringing depictions of queer life to television, having been behind the first male-on-male kiss in an American network show (“Dawson’s Creek”), the first recurring transgender character on prime-time television (“Dirty Sexy Money”), and the first openly gay superhero to headline a series (“Freedom Fighters: The Ray”) – not to mention bringing the first live-action transgender superhero to TV with the casting of Nicole Maines in the show “Supergirl” or his production of last year’s high-profile Amazon adaptation of the gay literary romance “Red, White, and Royal Blue.” His legacy on the small screen, which includes numerous accomplishments beyond those mentioned above, is not just solid, but exemplary.\n\nOn the big screen, however — with the exception of 2018’s “Love, Simon” (a major hit, which scored an impressive $66 million at the box office) — his efforts in the theatrical film industry have failed to replicate his success on television.\n\nYet with “Fly Me to the Moon,” which opened a widespread theatrical release on July 12, he just might have changed that narrative.\n\nIndeed, changing narratives might be what the movie itself is all about. Set in 1969, a year in which divisive politics and an unpopular war had made America a deeply anxious and cynical nation (sound familiar?), the pseudo-historical but entirely fictitious plot takes place during the Cold War “Space Race” in the months leading up to the historic Apollo 11 moon landing. National sentiment for the U.S. space program has waned, thanks to shifting public priorities and tragic setbacks in NASA’s progress. But with a perceived battle between American and Russian ideologies on the line, the U.S. government has decided that the mission is “too important to fail,” and they enlist the services of New York marketing whiz Kelly Jones (Scarlett Johansson) to give the floundering moon mission a boost in popularity.\n\nBringing all the tricks of her trade to NASA’s Florida headquarters, she is, naturally, met with resistance from mission director Cole Davis (Channing Tatum), a Korean War hero whose no-nonsense military background immediately puts him at odds with her “do whatever it takes” approach to selling the public on his project. Nevertheless, a mutual attraction sparks between them, but when Kelly’s “handler” (Woody Harrelson) instructs her to arrange a faked moon landing that can be sold to the public in case of the mission’s failure, any potential romance is put on hold as she tries to pull it off under Davis’s unsuspecting nose. Needless to say, as the launch date grows closer, the stage is set for a confrontation of ideals – and a comedy of errors — with consequences that will impact not just their personal lives, but America’s future understanding of its own history, as well.\n\nOstensibly a “romcom,” Berlanti’s film — built into a screenplay by Rose Gilroy from a story by Bill Kirstein and Keenan Flynn — certainly incorporates that always-popular genre into its slick-and-stylish formula. The match between its two attractive leading characters seems a foregone conclusion before they even meet, and once they do, proceeds through the standard series of tropes toward a presumed happy ending in which they ride (or, in this case, fly) off into the sunset together.\n\nBut “Fly Me to the Moon” doesn’t set out to simply be a love story with a historical backdrop; the romantic tension between its leads is really a hook to pull us into a satirical, absurd-ish confrontation between perception and reality — defined, in this case, by the juxtaposition of a historic event and the public image being manipulated around it — which plays into (and pokes a bit of troll-ish fun at) the perplexing popularity of conspiracy theories two generations later, and pitting the “end justifies the means” approach to truth embodied by half of its leading couple against the tight-lipped, old-fashioned idealism embodied by the other.\n\nFor fans of classic Hollywood cinema, it’s as much this aspect as the movie’s romcom trappings that will likely resonate. In its first half, it feels more than a bit like an homage to the sly and cynical wit of the great Billy Wilder, whose films from “Double Indemnity” to “Sunset Boulevard” to “The Apartment” looked beyond comfortable morality to cast a grimly humorous spotlight on human corruptibility. As the plot shifts toward its “save the moon mission” denouement, however, a swelling of sentiment fueled by the emotional arc of Johansson’s seemingly amoral huckster transforms the vibe into something more akin to the populist fables of Frank Capra, whose films about underdogs fighting and winning against a stacked system arguably helped to shape the American sense of self throughout the mid-20th Century. Indeed, one might easily envision James Stewart and Jean Arthur — the stars of Capra’s 1939 classic “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington” — as the two romantic leads here.\n\nUnfortunately, they’re not. While Johansson — for our money, one of the best yet most under appreciated film actresses in the industry — easily wins our attention and our loyalty early on, her chemistry with Tatum never quite ignites into the crackling flame clearly intended by the script. For his part, Tatum is well-cast in his role, but seems to us a little out of his depth when it comes to the finer points of his character growth.\n\nAmong the supporting players, there’s a more solid slate of performances. Ray Romano tugs our heartstrings without trying as a schlubbish career rocket scientist, and queer actor/comedian Jim Rash gives a hilarious but completely authentic turn as the “high maintenance” would-be directorial genius hired to orchestrate the phony lunar landing. Rounding out his headlining cast, Woody Harrelson steals his scenes as the shady government operative who serves as Kelly’s “handler,” and the fact that the actor’s father was in real life a CIA agent, on the scene at the John Kennedy assassination, adds a layer of fun detail for those who care to look.\n\nOn top of its collection of memorable performances, “Fly Me to the Moon” offers a spectacularly genuine period aesthetic, achieved with a seamlessly orchestrated visual design that ranges from perfectly recreated late-sixties fashion to a convincing and magnificent recreation of the real-life moon landing. And though it’s far from being a “thinker,” Berlanti’s movie is layered and compassionate enough to make us drop our reticence over some of its less historical elements.\n\nWe won’t mislead you: “Fly Me to the Moon” is a genuinely insightful comedy, but the chemistry between its leading players fizzles. The cast is stellar, and even if its effort to balance hard-boiled social commentary with feel-good sentiment doesn’t always feel simpatico, its throwback, classic Hollywood style makes for an oddly satisfying nostalgic romp. In other words, it’s not what we would call great cinema, but as mainstream, middle-of-the road entertainment goes, you could do a lot worse.\n\nThey might not be as coveted or as prestigious as some of the other awards out there, but the Dorians — presented annually by GALECA: The Society of LGBTQ Entertainment Critics, at separate ceremonies throughout the year, for excellence in film, television, and theater – nevertheless represent an important and much-needed perspective that “reminds society that the world values the informed Q+ eye on everything entertainment.” Fittingly enough, the 500+ member media journalists’ association, now in its 15th year, chose the 55th anniversary of the Stonewall rebellion to announce the group’s 2024 nominations for the best in television and streaming across 24 categories, and the competition – as one might expect – skews a little bit on the queer side, even if the nominations reflect a widely diverse range of cultural experience.\n\n“A lot of our nominated shows are focused on outcasts trying to punch through norms, and their own fears and flaws, to find peace – a not-easy road, but one our members obviously loved following,” says GALECA founder and Executive Director John Griffiths. “It’s fitting we’re flagging these stories on the same day that, years ago, the brave souls of Stonewall […] took to the streets of Greenwich Village to protest abuse and oppression and hate at the hands of bigots and bullies. Like those protesters, the writers of these Dorian Award-nominated shows remind us that you can’t just pout and clutch pearls if you want a better existence.”\n\nLeading the nomination tally among dramas are three very disparate series based on period novels, with “Anne Rice’s Interview with the Vampire” (AMC) snagging six nods, while “Shōgun” (FX/Hulu) and “Fellow Travelers” (Showtime/Paramount+) each earned five. In the comedy field, critical darlings “The Bear” (FX/Hulu) and “Hacks” (Max) – alongside Netflix’s shocking (if darkly amusing) “Baby Reindeer” – all grabbed six nominations.\n\nThis year, GALECA has included a couple of new categories. One of those is Best Written Show, where nominees include the aforementioned “The Bear,” “Hacks,” “Reindeer,” and “Fellow Travelers,” alongside ABC’s “Abbott Elementary,” a show that has been a past favorite with the group and scored additional nods across several categories; the other is for Best Genre TV Show, where the deeply queer “Vampire” competes with Netflix’s haunting “The Fall of the House of Usher,” Amazon Prime’s future-trippy “Fallout” and comedic horror offerings “What We Do in the Shadows” (FX) and “Chucky” (SyFy/USA).\n\nUnder the category of “nice surprises,” beloved SNL alumnus Kristen Wiig landed a nod for Best Comedy TV Performance for her work on the fizzy Apple TV+ hit “Palm Royale,” joining fellow SNL vets Maya Rudolph (for “Loot”) and Martin Short (“Only Murders in the Building”) alongside rising stars like Devery Jacobs of “Reservation Dogs. The latter show, about an underdog cadre of Indigenous American friends in Oklahoma, is up for both Best Unsung TV Show – a unique-to-the-Dorians category – and Best TV Comedy.\n\nIn fact, each of the Dorians’ acting, performance, and tribute categories – which are all non-gendered (hello, other Awards bodies, time to catch up with the times) – are peppered with beloved names, both big and up-and-coming. Such revered performers as Emma Stone, Jodie Foster, Angela Bassett, Ryan Gosling, Christine Baranski, LeVar Burton, Carol Burnett and Meryl Streep join those races alongside relative newcomers like Kali Reis, Ncuti Gatwa, Moeka Hoshi, Nama Mau, Jessica Gunning, Benny Safdie, Emma D’Arcy and Julio Torres.\n\nThen there’s GALECA’s most irreverent Dorian Award, for the year’s Campiest TV Show, where honors could go to doll-gone-wild tale “Chucky,” Netlix’s cheeky post-modernist period romance “Bridgerton,” Peacock’s opportunist reality/competition hit “The Traitors,” the 1970s Manhattan society “true gossip” dishfest “Feud: Capote Vs. The Swans” (FX/Hulu), and the aforementioned “Palm Royale,” which skewers high society in Palm Beach circa 1969 through the story of an average woman (nominee Wiig) seeking acceptance at a posh private resort while discovering there is more to life than the superficial trappings of glamor and ostentatious prosperity for which her fellow vacationers seem to hunger.\n\nOf course, the biggest interest for most queer TV fans lies in knowing which of their fan favorites made the cut for recognition at the Dorians. In the TV Drama category, alongside “Travelers” and “Vampire” (our personal pick for the most thrilling and transgressively queer show of the year, hands down), contenders include fellow genre-labeled series “Fallout,” Broadway-star-slumfest “The Gilded Age,” and the feel-good YA romance “Heartstopper.”\n\nOn the comedy side, queer-inclusive critical darlings “Abbot Elementary” and “Hacks” are joined by the under appreciated gem “Reservation Dogs” and the literary remake “Shōgun,” with irreverent fan favorite “What We Do in the Shadows” and Hulu’s “The Bear” rounding out the race.\n\nIn the race for Best LGBTQ TV show, “Fellow Travelers” (which also received nods in the Lead and Supporting Performance categories, for Matt Bomer and Jonathan Bailey, respectively) and “Vampire” (likewise for series star and “Game of Thrones” veteran Jacob Anderson) are joined by “Heartstopper,” “Hacks,” and “Baby Reindeer,” while the Best Unsung TV Show category – which also includes “Vampire” – spotlights less high-profile shows like “Chucky,” “Reservation Dogs,” Peacock’s “We Are Lady Parts,” and Max’s now-canceled queer pirate dram-com “Our Flag Means Death.” Not to be ignored, “Ripley,” Netflix’s stylish black-and-white adaptation of iconic queer novelist Patricia Highsmith’s novel “The Talented Mr. Ripley,” scored noms for Best TV Movie or miniseries, Best Drama Performance (Andrew Scott), and Most Visually Striking Show – another category unique to the Dorians.\n\nThe Dorian Awards, presented by GALECA, the Society of LGBTQ Entertainment Critics, are chosen democratically by the full membership, and are presented to TV, film and Broadway/Off-Broadway winners at different times of the year. Members work or freelance for a variety of mainstream and niche media outlets, including the Washington and Los Angeles Blade. A nonprofit organization, GALECA also advocates for better pay, access and respect for entertainment journalists, especially the underrepresented. Winners of the 2024 Dorian TV Awards will be announced Aug. 12.

She also reveals the powerful queer activism that has been pushing mainstream boundaries over the past five decades and beyond through a collection of out-and-proud comics that reads like a “who’s who” of queer comedy icons.\n\nIn doing so, its spotlight inevitably lands on Robin Tyler, who – after becoming the first lesbian comic to come out on national television and co-starring in a network series with her partner, Pat Harrison – incurred the wrath of sponsors (after an on-air remark aimed at notorious anti-LGBTQ mouthpiece Anita Bryant) and wound up unceremoniously dropped by the network.\n\nTyler persisted, and her passion led her to activism, where her contributions are likely well known to many Blade readers. She organized and produced the first three national marches on Washington for LGBTQ rights, including 1987’s “mock wedding” of hundreds of queer couples; she and her future wife (the late Diane Olsen) were the first couple to sue the state of California for the right to be married — leading to the seven-year legal battle that culminated in marriage equality. If you are currently in a same-sex marriage in the United States, you have her to thank.\n\nWe spoke to her about the film and her legacy, and, as always, she pulled no punches. Our conversation is below.\n\nBLADE: ‘Outstanding’ highlights your removal from “prime time” as a setback for queer visibility, but do you still think of it as a setback for your career?\n\nROBIN TYLER: You know what? Everybody says, “Oh, she gave up this career, she could have been a star,” but what they mean is I could have gotten mainstream acceptance. It’s like saying to Richard Pryor: “If you didn’t tell the truth, maybe white people would have loved you.” The best thing that happened to us is that we didn’t get picked up, because then we could go and be free. It takes your life away, having to live a lie. We gained our freedom and lost nothing.\n\nI don’t care about mainstream acceptance, if it means being in the closet. Don’t forget, 75 million Americans are MAGA supporters. To me, that’s the mainstream.\n\nBLADE: As an organizer, you spearheaded the fight for marriage equality. How did that happen?\n\nTYLER: In 1987, two men from L.A. wanted me to do the “mock wedding” as part of the ‘87 march on Washington. I took it to the board – there’s always this board of 68 people, it’s different people, but the same attitude, with every march – and they voted it down. They said, ‘no one’s interested in marriage,” and I said “fine.” And I did it anyway, and 5,000 people came. Obviously it was an issue we were interested in.\n\nIt was also interesting that a march board would try to decide what people want or not. Well, we did want it, and we got it, now.\n\nBLADE: And yet, it seems we’re still fighting for it.\n\nTYLER: I agree, and I think with this Supreme Court we’re in trouble – but passion is much better than Prozac, so we need to keep aware and be ready to get into the streets again. We can’t just be “armchair activists” on the internet, you know? Because then we’re just reading to each other.”\n\nBLADE: It does seem that the internet has made it easier for us to live in our comfortable bubbles.\n\nTYLER: Yeah, but I’m an organizer, and it’s wonderful for that. I was the national protest coordinator when we stopped Dr. Laura [Schlesinger, the anti-LGBTQ talk radio “psychotherapist” whose transition to television was successfully blocked by community activism in the early 2000s], and we did all the demonstrations locally. We worked with a guy who knew the internet, and we were able to send out information all over the country for the first time. I remember when we just had to go to parades and bars and baseball fields and had to leaflet everyone. This is easier. Less walking.\n\nBLADE: Still, social media has become a space where “cancel culture” seems just to divide us further.\n\nTYLER: That term was created by the right. They can go ahead and say anything they want, but we get to not be called names anymore. At least we have a way to fight back. They call it “cancel culture” and we call it “defending our rights.”\n\nAnd you know what? Even today, people like Dave Chappelle are doing homophobic jokes, and it’s not just that they’re doing it, it’s that these people sitting in the audience are still laughing at it. They still think they can get away with ridiculing us. You can always punch down and get a laugh. And why is it so bad, with people like Chappelle or Bill Maher? Because anytime you dehumanize anybody, when you snicker at them because you don’t understand, you’re giving other people permission to attack them. They’re attacking these people that are being brutally murdered, and they’re using humor as the weapon.\n\nWe didn’t accept it in the ‘70s, so why are we accepting it now? And why aren’t we calling out Netflix for giving it a platform? It’s not enough to put out “Outstanding” and showcase pro-gay humor. If a comic says something racist, their career is over, yet it’s OK for Chappelle to do homophobic stuff? What if I stood up and changed what he’s saying to make it about race instead of transgender people?\n\nAnd it’s not just about “right” vs. “left” anyway. Even with the Democrats in, they never deliver. Since 1970, they promised us a “gay civil rights bill,” and we still don’t have one. Why not? Democrats have held power in Congress, the Senate, the presidency, and they never pushed it through. We still can’t rent in 30 states, we can get fired; the United States is not a free country for queer people, and we must hold the government accountable. We have to fight for marriage separately, we have to fight for this and that, separately – and all it would take is one bill!\n\nIt’s been 54 years. Isn’t it time? We have to look at who our friends are – but don’t get me wrong, I’m still voting for Biden.\n\nBLADE: So, how do we fix it?\n\nTYLER: Here’s what I believe in: a woman walks into a dentist office, and he’s about to drill her teeth when she grabs him by the balls and says, ‘We’re not going to hurt each other, are we?’ I believe in that approach. Whatever they do to us, they need to know that there will be consequences.\n\nAnd, also, at Cedars-Sinai they have just one channel in the hospital, and it’s comedy, because laughter is healing. Maybe we should we end on that?"
