        "text": "A24 has released a trailer for its upcoming emotional drama, “Tuesday,” which stars Julia Louis-Dreyfus (“Veep”) and Lola Petticrew (“Bump Along the Way,” “Dating Amber”).\n\nThe film premiered at the 50th Telluride Film Festival on Sept. 1 and is expected to release sometime this summer.\n\nLouis-Dreyfus plays a loving, caring mother to a terminally ill teenage daughter (Petticrew). The two have a powerful bond, and early scenes of the “Tuesday” trailer show how they’ve embraced their circumstances with joy and humor, undaunted by the looming specter of death.\n\nThat changes when the daughter is literally confronted by death manifested in the form of a talking bird. As the story unfolds, the mother must learn to make her peace with and accept the brevity of her daughter’s time on Earth in an emotionally devastating drama about the echoes of loss and finding resilience in the unexpected.\n\nRounding out the cast is British actor and playwright Arinzé Kene (“I’m Your Woman,” “How to Build a Girl”).\n\nWritten & Directed by Daina O. Pusić, “Tuesday” marks Pusić’s feature directorial debut, but the London-based filmmaker gained recognition after her short film “The Beast” premiered at the Telluride Film Festival in 2015. Her follow-up short film, a comedy called “Rhonna & Donna,” played at Telluride in 2016 and won several awards.\n\nAlong with A24, producers include Ivana MacKinnon for Wild Swim Films, Helen Gladders for Gingerbread Pictures and Oliver Roskill for Record Player Films. Anna Meredith composes the film score.\n\nBBC Film is co-financing the film with A24 alongside BFI and awarding funds from the National Lottery and Cinereach. The project was developed with BBC Film, BFI and Gingerbread Pictures.\n\nWatch the trailer below."
