singing lessons.\n\nMy step dad was in vaudeville and my mother was a pianist\n\nand she played the piano for him and they had an act,\n\ntoured all over England.\n\nTo their surprise, they found out that I had\n\na kind of freaky adult larynx\n\nand could sing all kinds of coloratura songs\n\nand it wasn't long before I became part of their act.\n\nAt the age of about 10, I began climbing on a box\n\nto sing beside them on stage and then at 12,\n\nI had my first sort of main break in London.\n\nAnd that night was very successful for me\n\nbecause I don't think the press had ever heard\n\nsuch a freaky four octave voice in such a young kid before.\n\nBut it was the beginning of all the rest, really.\n\nI was in a London production of a Cinderella.\n\nAlso playing at the same time in London\n\nwas a very popular show called The Boyfriend.\n\nAnd some American producers came over to London\n\nand a great friend of mine said, Why don't you look in\n\nat the girl in Cinderella?\n\nSo they came to see the show, came backstage and met,\n\nand asked if I'd like to go to Broadway in America,\n\nwhich was one of the great pieces of serendipity in my life.\n\nBecause after I had been in The Boyfriend for a year,\n\nI was asked by Lerner and Loewe,\n\nwho wrote the wondrous play, My Fair Lady,\n\nif I would be interested in playing Eliza Doolittle.\n\nAnd then I guess my career took off from there.\n\n♪ All I want room somewhere ♪\n\n♪ Far away from the cold night air ♪\n\n♪ With one enormous chair ♪\n\n♪ Now wouldn't it be lovely ♪\n\nI had a lot of challenges in terms of creating Eliza.\n\nFirst of all, I really didn't have a Cockney accent.\n\nI didn't know how to find it.\n\nAnd I'd never really done a play before.\n\nI'd done my act in variety, in vaudeville, in musical\n\nbut never a really long, wonderful play.\n\nAnd so I was completely out of my depth.\n\nAnd then it was just a question, really,\n\nof putting my head down and learning day after day\n\nafter day my craft.\n\nIt really was the greatest learning experience on stage\n\nthat I could ever have had.\n\nI was in the show for about three and a half years\n\nand that's a very long time\n\nto play eight performances a week.\n\nIt does teach somebody how to, I mean,\n\nif your leading man has a cold,\n\nif the audience is coughing and sneezing,\n\nif it's raining outside, any number of things could happen\n\nand you really learn how to preserve your voice,\n\nhow to deliver lines, how to play comedy.\n\nI mean, it was a tremendous experience for me.\n\n♪ Someone's head resting on my knee ♪\n\n♪ Warm and tender as he can be ♪\n\nVery well, hold this for me.\n\nAs I expected.\n\nMary Poppins, practically perfect in every way.\n\nWhen I was fortunate enough to be asked to make the film\n\nof Mary Poppins, again, it was a brand new thing\n\nin my life that I'd never done before.\n\nIt was for Walt Disney, of course, and the songs\n\nin Mary Poppins had a kind of vaudeville quality to them.\n\nAnd I think it's what attracted me to the role\n\nbecause all that kind of supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\n\nand Jolly Holiday music was very much\n\nlike the kind of things that you hear in English vaudeville.\n\n♪ Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious ♪\n\n♪ Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious ♪\n\n♪ If you say it loud enough, you'll always sound precocious ♪\n\n♪ Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious ♪\n\nI felt a little bit more at home with the music I always did\n\nbecause basically all my life I've been a singer, really.\n\nAnd so with the kindness of people like the Disney team,\n\nlittle by little by little, I learned the craft\n\nof making a film.\n\nThe wonder of that all was that Mr. Disney not only asked me\n\nto do the film, but he asked my then-husband,\n\nTony Walton, to design Cherry Tree Lane\n\nand all the interiors of all the homes in the movie\n\nplus the costumes for everybody.\n\nTony was hugely talented and creating my costumes,\n\nhe would discuss them with me and he said,\n\nYou know, you're very prim and proper on the outside,\n\nbut I think Mary Poppins has a kind of secret life, maybe,\n\nand I'm gonna give her, when you open your coat\n\nor when you turn and dance, you'll see marvelously-colored\n\npetticoats and wonderful linings of your clothes.\n\nAnd he said, Because I think\n\nthat's what gives her pleasure.\n\nVery formal on the outside and a little bit wicked\n\non the inside, so to speak.\n\nAnd it completely gave me a clue as to her character.\n\nBig, big help for me.\n\n♪ Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down ♪\n\n♪ In a most delightful way ♪\n\n♪ The hills are alive with the sound of music ♪\n\nEverybody knows that The Sound of Music\n\nwas based on the Broadway musical.\n\nWhen it came time to do the movie, I think most of us felt\n\nthat the piece could be quite saccharine\n\nif we were not careful.\n\nI know our director, Robert Wise, felt that way,\n\nI know that wonderful Christopher Plummer felt that way,\n\nand I certainly did also.\n\nSo there were some conversations before we began filming\n\nhow best to get rid of the really sugary parts of the film.\n\nIt's mostly because with that beautiful scenery\n\nand seven children and that glorious music,\n\nif you weren't careful, it could be very, very sugary.\n\nIt was really thanks to Chris Plummer\n\nwho gave the film its glue.\n\nHe was the firm, stern father of the children\n\nand the antagonist that I had to work with.\n\nChris was such a wonderful actor.\n\nWe became great friends and really,\n\nuntil he passed away fairly recently,\n\nwe saw each other a lot, we knew each other.\n\nHe stayed a friend and it was very pleasant.\n\n♪ When you sing, you begin with do, re, mi ♪\n\n♪ Do, re mi ♪\n\n♪ Do, re, mi ♪\n\n[Jimmy] I have you.\n\nYou're home.\n\nOh, oh, thank you, thank you!\n\nI was very proud to make a wonderful film called Hawaii.\n\nAnd that was directed by a wonderful director\n\ncalled George Roy Hill.\n\nAnd in very short order, he was asked to direct a film\n\ncalled Thoroughly Modern Millie,\n\nwhich was a 20s flapper comedy, full of sweetness.\n\nI had a ball making that film.\n\nFirst of all, the costumes were delicious\n\nand it was with wonderful Mary Tyler Moore.\n\nMy friendship with Mary was such\n\nthat long after we'd finished the film,\n\nI was called Millie and she was called Miss Dorothy.\n\nAnd so I would meet her long after the film was over,\n\nwe'd see each other across a grocery shop\n\nor something like that and I'd go, Hey, Miss Dorothy!\n\nMillie! And we'd rush to meet and catch up on news.\n\nIt was a very nice relationship. We really bonded.\n\nYou have nice eyes.\n\nYou should catch 'em by candlelight.\n\n[Millie snorts]\n\nHave dinner with me?\n\n♪ Oh baby won't you play me ♪\n\n♪ Le Jazz Hot maybe ♪\n\n♪ And don't ever let it end ♪\n\nMy first husband and I had sadly divorced\n\nand it was painful, as they always are.\n\nBut, eventually I met Blake.\n\nHe was very charismatic, very attractive man,\n\nand a fabulous film director.\n\nWe did seven films together and one of the,\n\nprobably one of the most important ones was Victor/Victoria.\n\nAnd he came home one day having seen a German film\n\ncalled Victor und Victoria and it was the basic theme\n\nof the film that we subsequently made,\n\nbut it didn't have any of the depth of story,\n\nit didn't have the love story in it,\n\nit didn't have the homosexuality in it.\n\nIt was just a early 1930s black and white movie.\n\nAnd Blake began to think about it\n\nand he said to me, I've got,\n\nthere's a wonderful role for you.\n\nAnd I kept thinking, I don't think anybody's gonna believe\n\nthat I could be a guy.\n\nAnd I asked him about it and he said,\n\nJulie, don't worry about it.\n\nI've built it into the film.\n\nThe audience within the film believes wholeheartedly\n\nthat you are a guy and therefore the audience\n\nwatching the movie in the cinema\n\nwill go along with that story.\n\nIt was fascinating to play that role.\n\nIt stood me on my head.\n\nWas I a woman becoming a man\n\nor was I a woman playing a man\n\nbut thinking like a woman or was I trying to be a man only\n\nbut then got stuck with thinking like a woman?\n\nIt was crazy.\n\nIt was like patting your stomach\n\nand rubbing your head, that kind of thing.\n\nIt was great fun to do.\n\nAnd it was the third film I ever made\n\nwith that wonderful actor, James Garner.\n\nHe's not only a great actor, he's a great reactor.\n\nIf you watch Victor/Victoria,\n\nyou'll know exactly what I mean.\n\nHis reactions to my character were priceless\n\nand it was easy to work with him by then\n\nbecause we were such good friends.\n\nWell, I just find it hard to believe that you're a man.\n\nBecause you found me attractive as a woman?\n\nYes, as a matter of fact.\n\nDoctor, I want you to make it stop.\n\nI mean, my hands, something else could go any day now.\n\nI don't know when.\n\nSomewhere in the midst of other films,\n\na screenplay came across my desk, so to speak.\n\nIt was loosely based on Jacqueline du Pre,\n\nwho was a phenomenal cellist but she got multiple sclerosis\n\nand couldn't eventually play.\n\nAnd that's the basis of the film.\n\nIn this case, I played a violinist.\n\nIt was one of the hardest films,\n\nin terms of getting into the role, that I've ever done.\n\nI've had to do longer films and more exhausting films,\n\nbut this one was deeply sad.\n\nAnd I was confined to a wheelchair most of the time.\n\nI did a lot of research and went to the clinics\n\nwhere a lot of patients would go\n\nfor counseling or to get together.\n\nThey were very, very helpful to me\n\nand it's such a terrible illness.\n\nUnfortunately, I think, if I may be so brave,\n\nI think the studio felt it wasn't\n\nthe biggest blockbuster they'd ever made\n\nand they released it, of all days, on Christmas day.\n\nAnd I think it closed on the day\n\nafter Christmas Day. [laughs]\n\nBut I'm still very proud that I did it.\n\nYou married me because I was famous.\n\nAnd who were you?\n\nYou're nothing but a lazy, spoiled man.\n\nIf I am, you made me that way.\n\nDon't--\n\nAmelia, I'm so glad you could come.\n\n[Amelia] Hi, you've got a great place.\n\nThank you.\n\nWell, let me look at you.\n\nYou look so\n\nyoung.\n\nLater in my career, I made two films,\n\nPrincess Diaries 1 and Princess Diaries 2\n\nand this lovely young, talented actress starred\n\nin both of them, Anne Hathaway.\n\nIt was clear from the very first day of shooting\n\nthat she was gonna be a star.\n\nShe was incredibly talented, her instincts were so true,\n\nshe was very, very beautiful, and just a lovely human being.\n\nAnd it was great fun to watch her growing and learning\n\nand I kind of think that I probably\n\nwas a bit of a mum to her, too.\n\nAnd we're great friends.\n\nI have an announcement to make.\n\nMy granddaughter--\n\n[Amelia clears throat]\n\nShe's here! I see.\n\nShe's---\n\nWhat?\n\nMom, who is this sweaty guy? He's stinking up the house.\n\nI thought you were cooking cabbage.\n\nHe's my new guru.\n\n[Minion scoffs]\n\nA lot of people ask me what it is like to do voice acting.\n\nNot to be seen on a film, but to just do a voice.\n\nI have to tell you, it's an extremely different technique,\n\nnothing like making a movie.\n\nOne goes into a studio and offers up every kind of reading\n\nof a line that you could possibly imagine.\n\nAnd finally, the director of the film\n\ntakes the readings that he likes the best\n\nand that's what ends up in his movie.\n\nYou literally discover it as you go along\n\nand you are sort of putty in the director's hands.\n\nThe first one I did was when I was about 15 years old\n\nand I think it was called The Singing Princess.\n\nAnd all I did was dub a Czechoslovakian animated movie\n\nand I never thought about it until more recently,\n\nwhen a sort of spade of them have come along.\n\nI'm kind of happy to be doing them,\n\nlike Bridgerton, like Gru's mum in Despicable Me\n\nand The Minions.\n\nIt's very pleasant because you don't have\n\nto go into the studio,\n\nyou can just come in your dressing gown if you want.\n\nBut mostly, you don't have to do hair and makeup,\n\nyou just have to give a voice.\n\nIn Despicable Me, the company said,\n\nYou name her. What's she gonna be called?\n\nAnd she's such a terrible woman and so full of herself,\n\nshe thinks she's the best thing since God knows what.\n\nSo I thought she would think of herself\n\nas a kind of a Marlene Dietrich.\n\nThat's her image of herself.\n\nShe's far from that, but I thought she should\n\nbe called Marlene, so she is.\n\nShe's maybe the worst mother you could possibly encounter.\n\nShe's terrible to Gru, her son.\n\nShe's the reason he becomes such a despicable human being.\n\nIt isn't poor Gru's fault, it's Mum's fault.\n\nSome marvelous surprise will come your way,\n\nsome offer, some magic will happen.\n\nBut be ready, do your homework.\n\nThat's usually the advice that I give.\n\nBecause when you're asked to do something as miraculous\n\nas some of the things that I've been asked to do,\n\nyou'd better be ready and I think, to a certain extent,\n\nI did a lot of homework and it stood me\n\nin great, good stead."
