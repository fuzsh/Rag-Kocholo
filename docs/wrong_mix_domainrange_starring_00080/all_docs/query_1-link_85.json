The new cast members are Tisha Campbell-Martin as Tanya, Hamish Linklater as Harry and Steven Weber as Bill.\n\nThe production also stars previously announced Corbin Bleu as Sky, Dove Cameron as Sophie, Jaime Camil as Sam, Lea DeLaria as Rosie, and Jennifer Nettles as Donna.\n\nMamma Mia! will be directed and choreographed by three-time Tony Award-winner Kathleen Marshall and conducted by David Holcenberg. Filled with ABBA's timeless songs, Mamma Mia! features music and lyrics by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus and some songs with Stig Anderson, with book by Catherine Johnson. Mamma Mia! was originally conceived by Judy Craymer.\n\nTisha Campbell-Martin is known for her starring roles in the FOX television series Martin and on the ABC television sitcom My Wife and Kids. Campbell's first TV appearance was at the age of 6, in a 1974 episode of PBS' The Big Blue Marble. At age 18, she was in the film of Little Shop of Horrors as Chiffon with future Martin co-star Tichina Arnold. Her films include School Daze, House Party, Another 48 Hrs., Rush Hour 4, and Sprung, which included vocals by Campbell, singing on the remake of \"Don't Ask My Neighbor\" In 1992, Campbell released her debut album, Tisha, which included \"Push,\" co-written and produced by her friend Vanilla Ice, and \"Love Me Down.\" Campbell later became a part of the sitcoms Rita Rocks and The Protector. In 2012, Campbell starred in Mindless Behavior's music video \"Hello,\" starring as Prodigy's mom. Recently she played Damona on Dr. Ken, starring Ken Jeong.\n\nHamish Linklater made his Broadway debut opposite Alan Rickman in Seminar, won an Obie Award for his performance off-Broadway in The School for Lies, and a Drama Desk Award nomination for his work in the Public Theatre's Shakespeare in the Park 2010 production of Twelfth Night. He appeared in Measure for Measure, directed by Sir Peter Hall, at the Ahmanson Theatre. He made his playwriting debut with The Vandal, and his third play, The Whirligig, had its premiere this May and June off Broadway, produced by the New Group at Pershing Square Signature Center. Linklater starred for five seasons on the CBS comedy The New Adventures of Old Christine, playing the brother of Julia-Louis Dreyfus' title character. Recently he's had recurring roles on FX's Legion and Fargo, as well as appeared in the films 42 and Battleship.\n\nThe son of a nightclub singer and a borscht belt talent agent, it's not surprising that Steven Weber has a love for the limelight that emerged at an early age. By the time he was in third grade, the New York City-born Weber was appearing in television commercials. Pursuit of an acting career brought his film debut in The Flamingo Kid and a role on the soap opera As the World Turns. He appeared in the acclaimed war film Hamburger Hill and made his Broadway debut in The Real Thing. But it was the NBC sitcom Wings in which Weber soared to national attention, as he and Tim Daly starred for seven TV seasons as brothers running a one-plane airline in Nantucket. Weber's acting career has been as eclectic as it is accomplished- whether starring in the television version of Stephen King's horror story The Shining on ABC or appearing years earlier on the same network as JFK in The Kennedys of Massachusetts. His films also demonstrate his wide range, with roles in thrillers Single White Female and The Temp, as the title in the gay romantic comedy Jeffrey and as a sleazy 1930s pimp in Showtime's comic musical Reefer Madness. Returning to the stage, Weber has played the lead in the hit Broadway musical The Producers, appeared with Kevin Spacey and Mary Stuart Masterson in the London production of National Anthems, and again on Broadway in The Philanthropist. Most recently, Weber can be seen in the recurring role of Councilman Douglas Hamilton on CBS' NCIS: New Orleans. He is also appearing in Netflix's Thirteen Reasons Why as Principal Gary Bolan. Steven will also make appearances on this season of Ballers and Curb Your Enthusiasm for HBO. Weber studied at New York's High School of the Performing Arts and is a graduate of the theater program at the State University of New York at Purchase.\n\nCorbin Bleu comes from an extensive background in film, television and the theater. He is probably best known for the Emmy Award-winning High School Musical franchise. Bleu partnered with Karina Smirnoff on the seventeenth season of Dancing with the Stars, placing a close second. His Broadway credits include Ted in Holiday Inn: The New Irving Berlin Musical and Jesus in the revival of Godspell, which followed his rave reviews as Usnavi in In the Heights. Another stage highlight was appearing in Hairspray at the Hollywood Bowl as Seaweed, opposite Harvey Fierstein and Marrisa Jaret Winokur.\n\nDove Cameron is best known for playing the dual role as both title characters in Disney's Liv and Maddie for four seasons, as well as starring in Disney's Descendants as Mal, Maleficent's daughter; she will reprise that role in Descendants 2, which is set to premiere on July 21 simultaneously on ABC, Freeform, Lifetime, Disney XD and Disney Channel. Dove also recently appeared on NBC's Hairspray Live!, as Amber von Tussle, and in the film Barely Lethal with Hailee Steinfeld, Jessica Alba and Samuel L. Jackson. She has made guest appearances on a wide variety of television shows, including Showtime's Shameless, ABC's Malibu Country, Disney XD's Ultimate Spider-Man and CBS's The Mentalist.\n\nGolden Globe, Critics' Choice, Teen Choice nominee, Imagen Award winner and Broadway actor Jaime Camil, of CW's Jane the Virgin, wrapped a two-month run on Broadway starring as \"Billy Flynn\" in Chicago last summer. He has also appeared on stage in West Side Story, Hook, Aladdin, El diluvio que viene and the Broadway-bound musical The Mambo Kings. He began his career as a singer, performing alongside Cuban icons Amaury Gutierrez and Pancho Cespedes, before going on to star in the mega hit telenovelas Mi Destino Eres Tú and La Fea Más Bella in his native Mexico. He has starred in award-winning films, including Pulling Strings, 200 Cartas (alongside Lin-Manuel Miranda) and 7 Dias, which earned him Best Supporting Actor honors from the Premios ACE and the Mexican Cinema Journalists. Camil's career continued to skyrocket following star turns in the gender-bending comedy Por Ella Soy Eva and the fish-out-of-water romp Que Pobres Tan Ricos. He has recorded four platinum-selling albums.\n\nLea DeLaria currently appears as Big Boo on the hit Netflix show Orange is the New Black. The role has garnered her three SAG Awards. Her other TV credits include Showtime's Californication, Comedy Central's Broad City, CBC's Baroness Von Sketch, NBC's Law & Order: SVU, Will and Grace and Friends. Selected film credits include The First Wives Club, Dear Dumb Diary, and Edge of Seventeen, along with Pixar's Cars 3. DeLaria appeared on Broadway as Eddie/Dr. Scott in The Rocky Horror Show and as Hildy in the Public Theatre's On the Town (Obie, Theatre World Awards). Lea has five records on the Warner Jazz and Classics label; her sixth, House of David, was released in 2015.\n\nGrammy-winning Country superstar Jennifer Nettles made her Broadway debut in 2015 as Roxie Hart in Chicago and joined the cast of the NBC Dolly Parton television biopic, Coat of Many Colors. Her career has garnered eight No. 1 singles, over 22 million in worldwide sales and numerous awards from American Music Awards, the Academy of Country Music, and the Country Music Association. The multi-media maven has also won five ASCAP awards highlighting her songwriting prowess. Nettles has shared the stage with Beyoncé, Bon Jovi, Idina Menzel, John Legend, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga and Rihanna, among others.\n\nDirector and choreographer Kathleen Marshall is one of Broadway's most celebrated artists. Honored numerous times for her work on stage and screen, she has won three Tony Awards (with six more nominations) and two Drama Desk Awards (four additional nominations).
