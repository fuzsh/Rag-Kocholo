        "text": "Julia Louis-Dreyfus often finds herself in uncomfortable situations on her HBO sitcom \"Veep,\" but her interview on Jay Leno's show earlier this week trumped them all.\n\nThe 52-year-old \"Seinfeld\" alum called the \"The Tonight Show\" host an \"a--hole\" twice on Monday night when Leno trotted out a clip of the actress's film debut. The scene has a 20-something Louis-Dreyfus emerging from some leaves virtually naked, in the form of a sort of wood sprite, and laughing at her future real-life husband, actor Brad Hall.\n\nThe film in question is the 1986 cult classic \"Troll,\" about a wizard transformed into a troll, which possesses the body of a woman in an apartment building. Which raises the question: why did Louis-Dreyfus agree to do such a potential clunker at all?\n\n\"The were going to fly us to Rome,\" she told Leno. \"We didn't have a penny to our names.\"\n\nLouis-Dreyfus, who married Hall a year after the film's release, reportedly took the role while she was still a cast member on \"Saturday Night Live.\" She left the NBC show in 1985 to pursue a career in film appearing in Woody Allen's \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" and \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.\"\n\nBut it wasn't until 1989 that Louis-Dreyfus landed the role of Elane Benes on \"Seinfeld,\" which she played for nine seasons."
