According to Variety, Irish actor Lola Petticrew, whose credits include indie comedies 'A Bump Along the Way' and 'Dating Amber' will play the role of Louis Dreyfus' daughter, named Tuesday, in the film.\n\nThe cast also includes British actor and playwright Arinze Kene of 'I'm Your Woman' and 'How to Build a Girl' fame.
