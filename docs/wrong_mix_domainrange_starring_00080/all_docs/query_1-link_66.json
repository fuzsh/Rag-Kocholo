        "text": "12. ALWAYS (1989)\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg. Writers: Jerry Belson, Diane Thomas. Starring Richard Dreyfuss, Holly Hunter, John Goodman, Brad Johnson, Audrey Hepburn.\n\nFor a third time, Dreyfuss teams up with his “Jaws” and “Close Encounters” director Steven Spielberg in this remake of “A Guy Named Joe,” this time set in the contemporary world of aerial firefighting. Dreyfuss delivers a strong performance as Pete Sandich, a firefighter whose daredevil approach to his job concerns his colleagues and loved ones. As a side note, “Always” marks the final screen performance of Audrey Hepburn, who plays Hap, a being from the other side who guides Pete in his journey through the afterlife.\n\n11. DILLINGER (1973)\n\nWriter/Director: John Milius. Starring Warren Oates, Ben Johnson, Michelle Phillips, Cloris Leachman, Richard Dreyfuss.\n\nAlthough few might think of Dreyfuss as a mobster, his performance as giggly but deadly gangster George “Baby Face” Nelson in the John Milius indie film brought Dreyfuss to the attention of Hollywood casting agents. And although he never had such a blood-thirsty kind of role again, I suspect that it was his performance between his gleeful bursts of machine-gun fire that showed Hollywood that this guy can act. And his very next film turned out to be “American Graffiti.”\n\n10. NUTS (1987)\n\nDirector: Martin Ritt. Writers: Tom Topor, Darryl Ponicsan, Alvin Sargent, based on Topor’s play. Starring Barbra Streisand, Richard Dreyfuss, Maureen Stapleton, Karl Malden.\n\nBarbra Streisand took an uncharacteristically dramatic role as Claudia Draper, a call girl who has been accused of killing her john (Leslie Nielsen in his final dramatic role). Given her limited means, she must use the services of public defender Aaron Levinsky (Dreyfuss), whose help Claudia initially resists until she finally realizes that Aaron is truly on her side. For his performance as Aaron, Dreyfuss was nominated for his third Golden Globe Award.\n\n9. TIN MEN (1987)\n\nWriter/Director: Barry Levinson. Starring Richard Dreyfuss, Danny DeVito, Barbara Hershey, John Mahoney.\n\nBB Babowsky (Dreyfuss) and Ernest Tilley (Danny DeVito) are rival aluminum-siding salesmen in 1963 Baltimore when rivalries between “tin men” (as such salesmen were regularly called) could become extreme, and so it does between BB and Tilley. BB takes things so far that he sleeps with Tilley’s wife Nora, and the two men decide to play a game of pool to decide who gets Nora. Not exactly PC, but remember that this was 1963, and both Dreyfuss and DeVito nail that unfortunate trait of excessive male pride, an attribute that is sadly still with us today.\n\n8. WHAT ABOUT BOB? (1991)\n\nDirector: Frank Oz. Writer: Tom Schulman. Starring Bill Murray, Richard Dreyfuss, Julie Hagerty.\n\nAlthough they reportedly did not get along very well while on set, Dreyfuss and Bill Murray have great chemistry onscreen in Frank Oz’s comedy about Bob (Murray), a clingy psychoanalytic patient who so needs his therapist, the egomaniac Dr. Leo Marvin (Dreyfuss), that he follows him on Dr. Rosen’s family vacation. And much to the analyst’s horror, his wife Fay (Julie Hagerty) and his children Anna (Kathryn Erbe) and Sigmund (Charlie Korsmo) take the darling Bob under their wing and insist that he be a part of the Marvin family vacation. Complications ensue.\n\n7. THE APPRENTICESHIP OF DUDDY KRAVITZ (1974)\n\nDirector: Ted Kotcheff. Writer: Lionel Chetwynd. Starring Richard Dreyfuss, Micheline Lanctôt, Jack Warden, Randy Quaid.\n\nDreyfuss followed up his “American Graffiti” success with a starring role in this Canadian film as Duddy Kravitz, a young man desperate to prove his worth to his family. He gets a job as a waiter at a kosher summer resort, and through various means, he is able to parlay his savings into enough money into buying most of the property around a picturesque lake. However, concerned that the owners might not sell to a Jew, he gets his girlfriend Yvette (Micheline Lanctôt) to serve as a front for him. It was important for Dreyfuss at this point in his career to be seen as an actor who could carry a leading role, and with “Duddy Kravitz,” he did.\n\n6. DOWN AND OUT IN BEVERLY HILLS (1986)\n\nDirector: Paul Mazursky. Writers: Paul Mazursky, Leon Capetanos. Starring Nick Nolte, Bette Midler, Richard Dreyfuss, Elizabeth Peña.\n\nIn Paul Mazursky’s hugely successful remake of Jean Renoir’s 1932 classic “Boudu Saved From Drowning,” Dreyfuss plays Dave Whiteman, whose invention of a new type of coat hanger has made him a very rich man. Feeling unfulfilled in his marriage to his wife Barbara (Bette Midler), he begins an affair with the family’s live-in maid Carmen (Elizabeth Peña). But their comfortable if unhappy world is upended by the appearance of homeless man Jerry Belson (Nick Nolte) who falls into their Beverly Hills pool and winds up changing their lives.\n\n5. MR. HOLLAND’S OPUS (1995)\n\nDirector: Stephen Herek. Writer: Patrick Sheane Duncan. Starring Richard Dreyfuss, Glenne Headly, Jay Thomas, Olympia Dukakis, William H. Macy.\n\nGlen Holland (Dreyfuss) is a successful musician in the midst of composing his one great musical work. However, to free up time to be with his wife Iris (Glenne Headly) and his son, he takes a job teaching music at a local high school. When his son turns out to be deaf, Holland withdraws from him, resentful that his son can’t enjoy music which gives his own life meaning. When the music department is eliminated and he is out of a job, Holland is called back to school for a big surprise from his former students. For his performance as Mr. Holland, Dreyfuss was nominated for his second Academy Award and earned his fourth Golden Globe nomination.\n\n4. AMERICAN GRAFFITI (1973)\n\nDirector: George Lucas. Writers: George Lucas, Gloria Katz, Willard Huyck. Starring Ron Howard, Cindy Williams, Richard Dreyfuss, Charles Martin Smith, Harrison Ford.\n\nThe top-billed performers in George Lucas’ landmark comedy were television actors Ron Howard and Cindy Williams, but one of the true movie stars that came out of that film was Dreyfuss. (And Harrison Ford didn’t do too badly, either.) Dreyfuss plays Curt Henderson, a recent high-school graduate who is about to leave his home in Modesto, CA for college the next day, and while cruising around town, Curt spots a beautiful blonde (Suzanne Somers) who mouths the words “I love you” to him. Curt then spends his final night before college trying to track down this elusive symbol of love. For his performance as Curt, Dreyfuss was nominated for his first Golden Globe Award.\n\n3. THE GOODBYE GIRL (1977)\n\nDirector: Herbert Ross. Writer: Neil Simon. Starring Richard Dreyfuss, Marsha Mason, Quinn Cummings, Paul Benedict.\n\nDreyfuss won his first Academy Award and his first Golden Globe Award for his performance as Elliot Garfield, an aspiring actor who intends to move into a subleased apartment, only to find that it is already occupied by its rightful owner, dancer Paula McFadden (Marsha Mason). With Herbert Ross’ directing expertise and a delightful script by Neil Simon, the squabbling duo eventually fall in love (natch), and the courtship that follows is one of the most charming in recent movie history.\n\n2. JAWS (1975)\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg. Writers: Peter Benchley, Carl Gottlieb. Starring Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, Lorraine Gary.\n\nIn the biggest hit of his career, Dreyfuss portrays know-it-all oceanographer Matt Hooper who is asked to examine the remains of a young swimmer and determines that the town of Amity has a shark problem…a huge shark problem. Together with local police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) and Quint (Robert Shaw), a professional shark hunter, set out on Quint’s boat to catch the killer shark. It was the camaraderie among the three men that allowed Hooper to fit in with these gruff man and an opportunity for Dreyfuss to endear himself to audiences and set the stage for his Oscar-winning career ahead.\n\n1. CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND (1977)\n\nWriter/Director: Steven Spielberg. Starring Richard Dreyfuss, Teri Garr, Melinda Dillon, François Truffaut.\n\nArguably, Dreyfuss’ best lead performance was in Steven Spielberg’s sci-fi classic as Indiana electrical lineman Roy Neary who encounters a UFO which shines a bright light on his truck and burns his face. Roy becomes obsessed with UFOs and the image of a unusual-looking mountain of which he begins to make models, finally traveling to that mountain to come face-to-face with the alien beings. Dreyfuss carries this film classic in the lead role, and the image of Dreyfuss’ Roy saying goodbye to his family as he enters the spaceship has become iconic in the realm of sci-fi films."
