        "text": "Julia Louis-Dreyfus walks unnoticed up a quiet street in the posh Pacific Palisades neighbourhood where she lives, spots me at a table outside a French restaurant, gives that huge wide smile and a little waggle-fingered wave, and grabs a seat. Poached eggs, toast and jam are cheerfully ordered without recourse to a menu, and we're away. Neatly dressed in a blue tunic, white shirt and dark trousers, with good hair and in an affable mood, she looks like what she actually is when the cameras are off: a suburban mother who might have just dropped the kids at school.\n\nLouis-Dreyfus, 51, has reason to be cheerful. The debut season of Veep, the American political satire which has just ended in the US and is about to appear in the UK, has been rapturously received. The comedy, in which she stars as gaffe-prone vice-president Selina Meyer, has been seen as a personal triumph for Louis-Dreyfus, as well as a stateside vindication for the comic method of its creator, Armando Iannucci. Filmed in the style of his acclaimed British political comedy The Thick Of It (an American version of which failed to make it past the pilot stage) and its spin-off movie In The Loop, Veep seems also to have done away with any lingering suggestion that Louis-Dreyfus's career was suffering from the famous Seinfeld curse, which saw its central characters struggle to recreate the success they enjoyed on the hit comedy. A second season of Veep has already been commissioned.\n\nWhen Louis-Dreyfus first met Iannucci, he was a relatively unknown figure in the US. \"I wasn't familiar with The Thick Of It,\" she says, \"but when they told me he did In The Loop, I thought, fabulous. I loved that movie. And we hit it off right away. It was only the baldest concept at that point, and the pilot hadn't yet been written. He talked about his ideas and I talked about my impressions of politics and the system, things that I've observed as an actress and a citizen.\"\n\nThings that keep you awake at night? \"Exactly, but also all the behavioural stuff – ridiculous political behaviour I've noticed. And it didn't hurt that I spent part of my childhood and teenage years in Washington DC.\"\n\nIannucci and his team put together a tightly disciplined cast of energetic improvisers to portray the back-stabbing, internecine world of US politics. Selina Meyer's beady-eyed chief of staff Amy Brookheimer is played by Anna Chlumsky, who in another life was My Girl, opposite the pubescent Macaulay Culkin, and who appeared in In The Loop. (She's certainly not a little girl any more, not with that mouth: \"Maybe I'll name my kid after you – yeah, I'll call it Fuckweasel.\") Tony Hale, the idiot's idiot from Arrested Development, is Meyer's personal assistant, while Matt Walsh plays Mike McClintock, her balding, mostly useless communications director, who dodges the scorn of everyone around him, from lanky White House liaison Jonah Ryan (Timothy Simons: \"Matt, blink if you can understand me!\") to Meyer's witheringly sardonic appointments secretary, Sue Wilson (Sufe Bradshaw). And at the centre of it all is Louis-Dreyfus, swearing her head off.\n\n\"Before we shot even a frame of the show, we rehearsed for six weeks, which is unheard of,\" she says. \"Armando's famous for saying, 'Let's loosen things up a bit, let's lose that, try this, add this.' And even on the day we're shooting, we layer on even more improv while the cameras are running. You spend a lot of brain-energy, but I gotta say, it's a lovely, rewarding way to work.\"\n\nAnd was the cursing liberating? \"It really is, you know,\" she says with a leer, \"because I myself am a big curser, so it's lovely to have that. But the wicked language helps to highlight the world we're trying to depict, that's to say, the way there's a political world in front of the curtain, and another political world that's totally behind the curtain.\"\n\nPolitics as facade and performance? \"Exactly, the 15-car motorcade to buy frozen yoghurt, or all the ridiculous energy spent choosing exactly the right dog for Selina's daughter. The stuff behind the curtain is just… alarming.\"\n\nAs one would expect from Iannucci, the language takes centre stage: important speeches are routinely \"pencil-fucked\" moments before they're to be delivered, and as for sentimental subjects such as pregnancy, \"career-wise, that's like joining Scientology or getting a fuckin' neck-tattoo\". In short, the spirit of Malcolm Tucker hovers ever near at hand.\n\n\"It's just nuts, a total pleasure to speak it,\" Louis-Dreyfus says. \"Armando is a master writer, obviously, but to his credit he is not at all precious about his writing. He's incredibly open to other people's ideas and he actively encourages improvisation – encourages it like crazy.\"\n\nThere was talk before Veep aired that it had been inspired by Sarah Palin, the last, and only the second, woman to come anywhere near securing Meyers' job. But no, Louis-Dreyfus says, \"Palin was not a factor at all. Mainly because that's been done so well already, by Tina Fey and by Julianne Moore [in the recent HBO movie Game Change]. I guess you could make that link superficially, because I'm dark as well, and we're roughly the same age, and when she's fumbling around I can see why people might go there. But I wanted very much not to be in the business of copying an individual because I don't want to align myself with a party in the show, and we're not looking to make this a parody. That's why you'll never know which party these characters belong to, because it's really about behaviour, not ideology. The real star is language, and behaviour.\"\n\nIt's 30 years since the then 21-year-old Louis-Dreyfus joined Saturday Night Live in 1982, its youngest cast member ever. Before that, she had done time at Chicago's Second City comedy club, while she was studying theatre at Northwestern University in Chicago. When she joined the legendary show, it was barely seven years into its 37-year run.\n\n\"My cast included Eddie Murphy, Marty Short, Christopher Guest, Billy Crystal and Joe Piscopo. It was very intimidating and I really didn't know what I was doing. It wasn't a very happy time in my life. I went in there thinking it'd be all for one, but it was a dog-eat-dog world and I did not understand the dynamics at all. I've been back to host a couple of times and it seems like a much happier cast. But back then there was a lot less camaraderie.\"\n\nLouis-Dreyfus grew up in New York City, then in Washington DC after her parents divorced, and spent periods of her adolescence in Sri Lanka and elsewhere because of her stepfather's work with Project Hope, an organisation aiding medical practitioners in developing countries. \"We lived for short periods in Colombia and in Tunisia, and then I just lived in DC. So I had this out-of-America perspective, even a third world perspective, once I came home. You do end up thinking a little differently.\"\n\nHer father was descended from Alsatian French Jews, and her grandfather headed the giant conglomerate Louis Dreyfus Energy Services. Forbes magazine once named her one of the Hottest Billionaire Heiresses. She snorts cheerfully. \"I'm not unhappy about the 'hot' part, very flattered. But we had Forbes make a retraction on that – not the hot part. The truth is my father was the president of a billion-dollar commodities firm for a number of years, which is probably why they made the connection, but he's not a billionaire by any stretch.\"\n\nShe says she can't remember contracting the showbiz bug, but her childhood idols were the women of American comedy. \"I adored the obvious ones: Lucille Ball, Vivian Vance, Mary Tyler Moore, tons of women, Madeline Kahn, Teri Garr. Oh, and Diane Keaton.\" She went crazy for the films of Preston Sturges, whose female stars were always both funny and sexy. And it was while studying theatre, at Northwestern, that she met her future husband and frequent collaborator Brad Hall, to whom she has been married for 25 years. They have two sons, aged 15 and 20.\n\nShe lasted only three seasons at Saturday Night Live, without making much impact. But four years later – after flops such as the 1986 film Troll (\"Hey, it got me and my husband a vacation in Rome!\") and a walk-on in Hannah And Her Sisters (\"I could hardly hold it together when Woody was around, I was so in awe\") – came the best revenge. Not just for herself, but for another under-used comedian from the show, Larry David, who had teamed up with standup comedian Jerry Seinfeld.\n\n\"I knew Larry David from my time at SNL. He was on it one year and we were happy to be miserable together on the show. You know what? He never got a single sketch on the show, which says something – not a single one. And then so many years later, they made the Seinfeld pilot, which I've never seen. And they told Jerry and Larry, you need a woman regular – so here I am. SNL finally paid off handsomely, but in a delayed-reaction sort of way.\"\n\nDid she have any idea how successful Seinfeld would turn out? \"God, no, are you kidding?\" She laughs loudly, suddenly looking very like her Seinfeld character, Elaine Benes – big eyes, wide smile in the middle of an absolutely symmetrical face. \"I had no idea. I thought we'd get cancelled in a week. The show was such a departure from the kind of TV that was on at the time, like Cheers.\"\n\nFamously said to be \"about nothing\", Seinfeld featured four New Yorkers and one overarching diktat: \"No hugging, no learning.\" A couple of seasons in, it became apparent to critics and viewers that a true comedy phenomenon was under construction – but Louis-Dreyfus didn't even notice. \"Well, I didn't wake up one morning realising I was on a cultural landmark. When I was doing it, I was just driving to work every morning like a regular commuter. And I also had my two babies during that period, so I was very much about working – and there wasn't anything else beyond that. I do remember shooting the final episode, though. We were at Radford in Studio City and they had blockades up around the stage and the sets to block the view. There were all these cameramen outside with huge zoom lenses trying to figure out who was in the final episode. And I was amazed that anyone even gave a shit.\"\n\nBut give a shit they most certainly did. And her kids noticed, too. \"There was a period when I was on the cover of lots of magazines, during the Seinfeld era, and it certainly seemed that way to my son, who would have been about five at the time. We were walking along the street outside Brentano's bookstore and Margaret Thatcher's memoirs were in the window, lots of copies. And he goes, 'Mom, look! It's you – you're everywhere!\" I think he just assumed that any woman on the cover of a magazine was his mom.\"\n\nHow does she keep things normal for her sons? \"It's a tricky balance, but not a hard one to prioritise. I've kept things private, and I've made a lot of decisions career-wise to do with family that I'm really happy about. I mean Veep, I would never have done this five years ago, because then my kids would have been too young to lose me to work on the east coast for two months at a time [Veep shoots in Baltimore, using The Wire's crew]. But now my older son is in college and my youngest is 15, so between me and my husband – who is very, very hands-on – it works out fine.\"\n\nAs for her own politics, Louis-Dreyfus worries \"about how Obama will do in November\" and espouses an interest in green issues: she works for LA's Heal the Bay coastal renewal project and she and her husband recently built an eco-house up the coast in Montecito, near Santa Barbara. \"Work for the planet, but start in your neighbourhood – yes, I believe in the global-local thing,\" she says. \"And living in Santa Barbara, it's such a luxury, perhaps even an indulgence, to have a second home at all that we thought we'd make it as green as humanly possible.\"\n\nAs lives go, it sounds more charmed than cursed. And Louis-Dreyfus's Seinfeld co-stars aren't doing too badly, either: Seinfeld is an elder statesman of the US comedy community and David's follow-up hit, Curb Your Enthusiasm, extended even to a Seinfeld reunion, which Louis-Dreyfus describes as \"very meta, like going back to your high school reunion – but having a good time\".\n\nAside from Veep, she followed Seinfeld with a short-lived US show called Watching Ellie, which featured Steve Carell's first post-Daily Show, pre-The Office role (\"That man will win the best actor Oscar one day,\" she predicts), and the successful series The New Adventures Of Old Christine. Next up is an untitled Nicole Holofcener movie opposite In The Loop veteran James Gandolfini, a man also supposedly the victim of a post-Sopranos curse. \"We get to fall in love,\" she says. \"It's gonna be fun!\"\n\nSome curse."
