        "text": "By MAYA SALAM\n\nLess than two weeks after her record-setting Emmy win, Julia Louis-Dreyfus announced she’s been diagnosed with breast cancer. In a post on her Twitter page, the “Veep” and “Seinfeld” actress wrote, “1 in 8 women get breast cancer. Today, I’m the one.”\n\nShe then immediately shifted the conversation to health care and cancer research.\n\n“The good news is that I have the most glorious group of supportive and caring friends, and fantastic insurance through my union,” she wrote. “The bad news is that not all women are so lucky, so let’s fight all cancers and make universal health care a reality.”\n\nShe prefaced the social media posts with the line: “Just when you thought…”\n\nShe did not disclose the severity of the diagnosis.\n\nLouis-Dreyfus, 56, learned she had cancer Sept. 18, the day after the Primetime Emmy Awards, an HBO spokeswoman said Thursday. The news played no part in the decision to make next season of “Veep” its last, the spokeswoman said.\n\n“The writers will continue writing, and the production schedule will be adjusted as needed,” she added.\n\nThe comedy’s last season will air in 2018.\n\nLouis-Dreyfus this year earned her sixth consecutive Emmy as Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her role as Selina Meyer, the vice president turned president turned ex-president, on the hit HBO comedy “Veep” — giving her the most Emmy wins by a performer in one role.\n\n“Our love and support go out to Julia and her family at this time,” HBO said in an emailed statement. “We have every confidence she will get through this with her usual tenacity and undaunted spirit, and look forward to her return to health and to HBO for the final season of ‘Veep.’”\n\nThe actress Christina Applegate immediately replied to Louis-Dreyfus’ post, saying: “Mama, find me. Let’s talk if you want.” Applegate learned that she had breast cancer in 2008 and had a double mastectomy shortly afterward.\n\nLouis-Dreyfus has won eight Emmys in her career. Aside from those associated with “Veep,” she won the lead actress Emmy in 2006 for her role as Christine Campbell in “The New Adventures of Old Christine,” and a supporting actress Emmy in 1996 for her role as Elaine Benes on “Seinfeld.”"
