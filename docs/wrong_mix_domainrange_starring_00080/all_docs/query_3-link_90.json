        "text": "Julia Louis-Dreyfus says having breast cancer put her priorities into “sharp focus.”\n\nThe “Veep” actor, 63, reflected on her breast cancer diagnosis during a visit to TODAY on June 10, and shared a poignant moment of reflection with Hoda Kotb, who is also a breast cancer survivor.\n\n“One of the reasons I always wanted to talk to you was because many years ago, I was diagnosed with breast cancer, and something struck me in that moment,” Hoda told the “Seinfeld” actor.\n\n“I realized for the very first time in my life that my life had a beginning and an end. I had never actually visualized it until that diagnosis,” Hoda continued. “It’s like the world snapped into focus. I cleared away stuff I didn’t want anymore, I held on tightly to the things I did.”\n\nLouis-Dreyfus said Hoda’s words resonated with her.\n\n“When you’re younger, there’s kind of this arrogance of youth. … You do feel immortal,” she said. “And then all of a sudden, you’re bumped up against that, and you're like, ‘Oh, wait a minute, this at some point it’s going to end. What?’ You know, you don’t go through life thinking about that very much, so it puts into sharp focus priorities. It did for me.”\n\nThe “New Adventures of Old Christine” star revealed her breast cancer diagnosis on social media in September 2017.\n\n“1 in 8 women get breast cancer. Today, I’m the one,” she wrote in an X post. “The good news is that I have the most glorious group of supportive and caring family and friends, and fantastic insurance through my union. The bad news is that not all women are so lucky, so let’s fight all cancers and make universal care a reality.”\n\nIn an October 2018 “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” appearance, Louis-Dreyfus shared she beat breast cancer.\n\nThe actor also said on TODAY that her “attitude shift” following her experience with breast cancer influenced her recent work.\n\nIn her new movie, “Tuesday,” Louis-Dreyfus plays a mother coming to terms with her daughter’s terminal illness with the help of Death itself, who arrives in the form of a macaw.\n\nHoda has also opened up about how her breast cancer diagnosis led her to take more risks professionally.\n\nShe previously shared the story of how her “wildly fearless” attitude after having breast cancer gave her the courage to pitch herself as co-host for the TODAY show’s fourth hour.\n\n“I remember going up the elevator and I’m like, ‘I’m going to ask for that job.’ I would never have dreamt that I was even deserving of that job (before),” she told Jenna Bush Hager in 2023.\n\n“I thought, ‘Oh, my God, if I hadn’t gotten sick, I wouldn’t have been brave and if I wasn’t going to be brave, I wouldn’t be there and I wouldn’t be here,’” she added. “Sometimes it’s like the scariest thing in the world becomes the thing that makes you fearless.”"
