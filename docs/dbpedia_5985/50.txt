Friends,

The following is a letter from the Burrows of Hollywood with new information on the SUCCESS of Chump Change. Please visit the site for a plethora of funny tid-bits on Chump Change including the covers that didn't make it.

I picked up a DVD copy of Chump Change from Honk Kong with Japanese subtitles and the original poster as the cover. I find it interesting that this movie has already been around the world.

Enjoy,

Steve Meisner

Howdy Fellow Chumps -

Thanks to you all, Chump Change is a DVD hit! We wanted to let you know that the 'official' Chump website is finally up and running (http://www.chumpchangethemovie.com/ ) - it's truly the one-stop shop for all things Chump. Heck, you can even buy the movie through it. If so inclined, you can also peruse some of the great reviews we've received, not to mention all sorts of other chump nonsense.

Also folks, we want to encourage all of you and yours to go to the industry standard website (http://www.imdb.com) and place your vote for Chump. Somehow the scoring is all screwed up for us. Chump's median score is 10 and our arithmetic average is 8.4 - but the 'weighted score' works out to only 3.7! We can't figure it out and when we contacted IMDB their only response was "it'll work out when more people vote". Duh. So, please spread the word - and help us get out the vote! (though one vote per chump only, please.)

Thank you again for all your support through the long years of getting Chump Change out there to the audience. Stay tuned as we hope to be emailing you an announcement regarding our next movie - soon!

All our best,

Steve & Margo

P.S. Just found out our Chump Change website has won a Golden Webby! (whatever that is.)

Howdy Folks -

Great news for Chump Change. We just got our first review from a national publication - Entertainment Weekly, no less! In the February 13th issue (the Survivor cover) Entertainment Weekly gave Chump an A for our just released DVD. We're right in between Lost in Translation (A), Rain Man (A-), and the Coen Brothers (C). We're on page 59.

Our little movie has finally gone public - nationwide. Many thanks to all who helped us get there. Also, check out the new official Chump Change website @ http://www.chumpchangethemovie.com/ .

Miramax releases Milwaukee native's award-winning film on DVD

"Miramax put together an entertaining DVD that builds on the humor of the film and gives viewers about four-and-a-half hours of laughs for chump change," Said Burrows. "I'm excited that the hundreds of people who put their heart and soul into this project can now pay from $15 to $30 for a movie they didn't get paid to work on."

"Chump Change" is now available on BN.com, Amazon.com, Video.com, Blockbuster.com, Buy.com, deepdiscount.com, Borders.com, etc. and in Barnes & Noble stores, Suncoast Video, Best Buy, etc.

Howdy Chumps -

Just a quick completely impersonal update following the Chump Change premiere in Milwaukee.

On November 7, for the first time in history, the palatial Oriental Theatre sold out its 1,200 seats, and turned away 500 poor folks freezing their arses off in 10 degree weather for the premiere of Chump. It was insanity gone mad -red carpets, cleg lights, accordion players, Shriners, attractive young gals handing out 3" pieces of cut-up Chump film print, an organist playing everything from On Wisconsin to Lady of Spain, a plethora of cast and crew members including Traci Lords, an after-party, an after-after party, an after-after-after party - whew!

Our press was exceptional (to check some of it out):

And we found out there's already a run on pre-ordering the film

(through http://www.amazon.com or http://www.blockbuster.com ). This has always been the little film that could, and we thank you all for all the amazing support along the way.

Our release January 20 is inevitable - Chump will finally belong to the audience it was made for.

Have a great holiday season.

All our best,

The Burrows of Hollywood
