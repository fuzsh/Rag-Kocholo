        "text": "When it comes to taxes, I'm an adherent of avoidance (not evasion). I make my living helping business owners and advisors minimize and mitigate taxes and risk. The lower they are the more value is created. However, patriotism and capitalism is NOT the same thing. If you disagree, stop reading right here. This screed might offend.\n\nI admire large corporate executive titans who are able to navigate their companies through all the market and regulatory obstacles and still deliver for their shareholders, employees and customers. They seldom get the credit they deserve.\n\nWhat I don't admire is an event that happens once a generation or two; a major tax over-haul claiming one thing that delivers another. The media \"red meat\" is the 1% versus the 99%, but that's deflection. It's the US citizen versus large corporations. I'd like to illustrate a few items of note and concern.\n\nOur uniformed services project U.S. interests abroad; however, there is a big difference between the troops and defense contractors. All paid from US tax dollars. When our forces are present overseas it makes for more markets for U.S. based global companies from burgers to banking.\n\nRead \"War is a Racket\" by twice medal of honor recipient USMC LtGen. Smedley Butler. Nothing has changed other than the Fourth Estate (Media Independence.)\n\nThe supply chain that most US conglomerates use in our country is connected by roads, rail and rivers. They are maintained (or should be) from primarily US tax dollars.\n\nThe labor pool of these large corporations is derived from those educated in our public schools. Many of those returning from WWII benefitted from the G.I. Bill and obtained a college degree paid by our government. It was recognized then that upper mobility was tied to higher education. Then the corporations paid the highest proportion to our US Treasury that allowed for roads, bridges, military AND education. A quality public education was the great social and economic equalizer.\n\nThis WAS the middle-class economic engine that benefitted corporations whose goods they often helped to make and purchase. Win-win.\n\nEach of the above are examples of how corporations rely on the federal (and state governments) to provide the infrastructure that permits them to pursue profits. It stands to reason they should share in the costs.\n\nYet, effective (not posted - armies of great CPAs/attorneys assure this) corporate tax rates lowered and loop holes exploded, where the US taxpayer was expected to pick up more of their share of tax payments. States can't print money, so they incurred more of the costs of education from construction to curriculum and eventually had to push that burden down to municipal level where neighborhood property taxes influenced the caliber of education - an oversight to a maxim of - educate your future taxpayer or potentially \"carry\" or incarcerate him or her at even greater cost later.\n\nAll one has to do is look at Congress' almost $5 trillion in tax reductions (over the next decade) and offset deductions to realize by far the \"Champs\" are large corporations with taxes lowered to 21% from 35% (or greater). These go into effect and are permanent.\n\nNot so much those for the US Taxpayer - the Chumps. Where is the repatriation of the Trillions of Dollars of corporate profits that remain offshore and the associated taxes?\n\nBut wait. There's more to come.... The social welfare safety-net (not business subsidies) is also going under the butcher knife (not scaple) to better balance the budget. So, if you have a parent or are one who receives or expects to receive assistance and your middle income or below - ignore the repackaging - stay seated - it's gonna' hurt.\n\nSo, above I underscored some examples of where government can and does help both citizens and corporations alike. Every elected official on Capitol Hill takes an oath to protect and defend the Constitution from all enemies foreign and domestic. It doesn't say only Republican or Democrat. It also doesn't say corporations. The preamble does begin with \"We The People\". Whose corner are your elected representatives in?\n\nIf, we as citizens, want a strong, stable and well-defended country where pursuit of happiness includes individual freedoms then who saves and who pays matters much more than simply what my neighbor has or doesn't have. I'll stand by my neighbor before aligning with a large corporation that doesn't do their fair share of the lifting."
