        "text": "When I heard about the release of this American Sonnets for My Past and Future Assassin, I knew I had to read it. I don’t often read poetry but when I do it’s because I’m sure the collection is going to move me. And this one did that and more.\n\nThis collection was savvy, intelligent, angry, creative, and has its pages and words on the pulse of what’s wrong with America. How does a poet cope with the election of a new president? Lyrical and rhythmic, Hayes let’s us know what the deal is. So you need to be ready. He’s angry. Every sonnet in the collection has the same title, ‘American Sonnet for My Past and Future Assassin’. One of the coolest things about this collection is that there is a sonnet index at the back. The first line of each sonnet with its page number moreover when you read each line in the index it makes another poem.\n\nIn this collection, Hayes is the assassin but so are we if we feel as angry as he does. He makes it clear that we are all linked and that we need to realize that and act like it. He also reiterates that we’re in the shit! He uses everything from police brutality to pop culture to express his thoughts so if you aren’t up on the news, music, literature, tv, shows, movies, etc., it might be difficult to understand the meaning behind these sonnets. I personally found them excellent and would recommend them to everyone, especially to Americans. I’ve already read it twice. Finding new meaning throughout the collection and I will surely pick it up again. We are going through a difficult and unprecedented period in the United States that needs to change for the better! All I can say is read American Sonnets for My Past and Future Assassin for some consolation and most of all vote! Check out the video below where Terrance Hayes talks about his writing and reads a few of his poems. He’s brilliant!\n\n“AMERICAN SONNET FOR MY PAST AND FUTURE ASSASSIN\n\nThe umpteenth thump on the rump of a badunkadunk\n\nStumps us. The link, the chump, the hunk of plunder.\n\nThe umpteenth horny, honky stump speech pumps\n\nA funky rumble over air. The umpteenth slump\n\nIn our humming democracy, a bumble bureaucracy\n\nWith teeny tiny wings too small for its rumpled,\n\nDumpling of a body. Humpty-Dumpy. Frumpy\n\nSuit. The umpteenth honk of hollow thunder.\n\nThe umpteenth Believe me. The umpteenth grumpy,\n\nJumpy retort. Chump change, casino game, tuxedo,\n\nTeeth bleach, stump speech. Junk science. Junk bond.\n\nJunk country, sum speech. The umpteenth boast\n\nStumps our toe. The umpteenth falsehood stumps\n\nOur elbows & eyeballs, our Nos, Whoahs, wows, woes.”\n\nAmerican Sonnets for My Past and Future Assassins, p. 48 – Terrance Hayes (Penguin Books) 89 pages, paperback\n\nRating: 5 stars\n\nIf you’d like to pick up a copy of American Sonnets For My Past And Future Assassins or any of my other recommendations please consider clicking my affiliate link for The Book Depository.
