        "text": "Xavier Giannoli's latest movie is an unsatisfying satire on the subject of celebrity. The premise is interesting enough. Kad Merad plays Martin Kazinski, a bald, middle-aged guy who leads a humble, decent life working for a firm that recycles old computers and also provides employment for people with learning difficulties. One morning, he wakes up to find he has undergone a Kafkaesque metamorphosis into a celebrity: people demand his autograph and take his photo. He is all over the net. But why? No one will tell him. He is famous, then famous for being famous, exploited by a reality TV show produced by worldly cynic Jean-Baptiste (Louis-Do De Lencquesaing) and his beautiful but troubled colleague Fleur (Cécile de France) who develops a soft spot for their poor, panicky chump.\n\nAt first, the movie interestingly suggests that Martin has experienced a kind of spontaneous combustion of web celebrity, a SuBo phenomenon originally caused by mischief-makers in the same spirit as people who decide to bully school-contemporaries online. But how did they get his name? And how did they get the childhood photos of Martin that are posted online?\n\nInfuriatingly, it doesn't occur to anyone here to ask or answer these obvious questions. At one stage, the movie hints at the possibility that Martin's woes originate from having joined an internet dating site. But this idea is just dropped. Perhaps a scene was cut.\n\nOf course, it is possible that the mystery is intentional, like Haneke's Hidden, but the fact that no one behaves as they would in real life makes it valueless both as satire and drama.\n\nWell, having ignored the real point, the film, like the meretricious TV show at its centre, asks a lot of dull and obvious questions about celebrity: is there too much of it, are we too obsessed with it, what do we think of someone who \"refuses\" it? (But wait: he's not refusing it – he's trying to find out how he got it.)\n\nMartin becomes an emblem of ordinariness, a tribune of the people, accosted by excitable shoppers in supermarkets in awkwardly scripted scenes that are neither funny nor convincing – and then, inevitably, he morphs from hero to villain as the mob interprets his reclusive fear as starry arrogance.\n\nIt's a decent performance by Kad Merad, but the whole film is just so redundant and fundamentally unconvincing – and the growing relationship between Martin and Fleur is almost insultingly phoney.\n\nGiannoli's 2006 movie, The Singer, with Gerard Depardieu as a fading lounge singer, was shrewd and interesting on the subject of celebrity. This one, sadly, is not."
