        "text": "Guys,\n\n––First, let me start out by saying “Unbroken” is NOT a war movie,….at least like you normally think of one.\n\n----It IS a very powerful, inspirational movie that is extremely well done. It also has a enough WW2 action/scenes to be “interesting” to a WW2 buff. The CGI as well as the physical props were well done. I only noticed one inacuracy,…when returning to America at the end of the war there was a transport aircraft that still had the early ww2 red dot in the star and red/white rudder stripes. I guess it might have been possible but I doubt it. Anyway, it was hardly noticable (except to a historian) and didn’t detract from the movie at all. All summed up, a great movie that’s well written, acted, with great cinematography.\n\n----My opinion,…If you want to see a well done INSPIRATIONAL movie set in the WW2 era, this is a GREAT ONE!\n\nTall Paul\n\nI really wanted to like it but it was so compressed, I think the best scene is when that CGI plane blows up in the sky during the invasion. Was there a drop of blood in the whole movie that wasn’t from the deer? Not that I’m blood thirsty but this was a war movie.\n\nThis version will never be as good as MY Red Dawn back in the 80’s. The most dissapointing thing was waiting the 2 years when they were about to release it and followiing it on YouTube with bootleg footage and the fake trailers…humpf…I feel cheated. But, I found a blu ray copy of the original and it came with $7.50 off the price of a ticket so it only cost me $2.50 to watch so there Helmsworth! Put that towards your Malibu condo dude!\n\nAll true Red Dawn fans know this fact, It was the first ever rated PG-13 movie. In todays rating world, the orginal might have been rated R while this new version should have been Rated G.\n\nThanks for letting me vent fellas.\n\nTHe part where it showed the video, and you see an alien for the first time, I jumped. But over all the aliens were not that scary. I mean you can trap them with a pantry door, and beat them to death with a bat.\n\nThey are fast and strong, but they didn’t seem to use those qualities in combat, only in movement. Given a super soaker or an assault rifle you could probably take out a dozen of the aliens."
