        "text": "Dear Readers: To mark my final week writing this column, I’ve fired up the “Ask Amy” Wayback machine and am re-running some memorable Q&As culled from the last 21 years of “Ask Amy.”\n\nDear Amy: Yesterday, my girlfriend “Lori” and I went to lunch at a local restaurant. Two guys were heading for the same restaurant and were slightly ahead of us, but when they got to the door, they held it open for us and allowed us to enter the restaurant first.\n\nWe smiled, I thanked them and as soon as I entered, I stood back to allow them to get in line ahead of us, because I figured that was their rightful place and they shouldn’t be penalized for having been courteous to us.\n\nI could tell that they were on their lunch break from work, whereas we had plenty of time to enjoy our own lunch.\n\nLori got irritated with me and said I shouldn’t have let them “cut” in line ahead of us. I told her I didn’t think they should be penalized for holding the door for us.\n\nLori keeps laughing at what a “chump” I was. What do you think? When someone holds the door open for another person, does the door holder automatically give up his/her place in whatever line is inside?\n\n– Confused\n\nDear Confused: Let’s diagram this situation.\n\nOn second thought, let’s not.\n\nYou are a nice person.\n\nYour girlfriend is a jerk.\n\nYou performed an act of kindness.\n\nShe laughed at you for it.\n\nMy only concern is that if you continue to hang out with her, her harsh assessment of you might turn out to be correct. Don’t be a chump!\n\n(June 2006)\n\nDear Readers: R. Eric Thomas is starting a new advice column called “Asking Eric.” Eric is young, smart, and an experienced advice-giver. You can help him to get started by sending your thorniest dilemmas his way. Email him at eric@askingeric.com.\n\nStories by Amy Dickinson\n\nAsk Amy: In her final column, Amy shares some wisdom and laments ‘I’ll miss having coffee with you’\n\nAsk Amy: It's wedding season! Check out these hilarious mishaps gathered from Amy's files\n\nAsk Amy: College student worries over Black friend’s safety as he visits San Francisco over the summer"
