        "text": "It sells themes of bravery and being adventurous relatively well for a story of this kind, using its medium to humour and entertain while also being supportive underneath the veil of its narrative.\n\nJuly 19, 2024\n\nMigration is a solid-animated film that might have made one too many safe decisions regarding its plot, animation style, and themes.\n\nJuly 3, 2024\n\nScreenwriter Mike White conjures up a series of episodes ... There is much for older, childless adults to enjoy ... splendid animation. ... often quite unexpectedly funny. ... The high quality of the voice cast ensures that every nuance rings true.\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\nIllumination’s latest feature is bright and bouncy and largely pitched to audiences who’ve only recently learned to waddle, with plenty of sight gags that will quack up undemanding audiences.\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\nI laughed out loud quite a few times during the tight 82-minute running time.\n\nFebruary 29, 2024\n\nI’d bet $5 the pitch for this movie was “Vacation … but with ducks on migration! … but also Finding Nemo … on the quality level of The Secret Life of Pets,” and the entire room stood in applause. It’s okay!\n\nFebruary 21, 2024\n\nMigration is a winning choice for the family, and likely to entertain viewers of any age.\n\nFebruary 20, 2024\n\nA sparky script helps make this silly animated adventure more entertaining than expected, cleverly written by Mike White and voiced by a superbly eclectic cast. Director Benjamin Renner also adds enjoyably colourful touches in the design work.\n\nFebruary 6, 2024"
