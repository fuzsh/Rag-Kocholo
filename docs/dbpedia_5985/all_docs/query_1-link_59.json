        "text": "When I was in high school competing against Gregg Hale in speech tournaments hosted by the Kentucky High School Speech League, I don't think anyone had any idea what he had in store for us 15 years after graduation.\n\nA Blair Witch Anniversary\n\nBack in 1999, a little film with a little budget took the world by storm and effectively created the \"found footage\" horror genre. That little film, shot on a budget of between $30,000 and $60,000, was called The Blair Witch Project. Ultimately, the budget--after post-production--would balloon to between $200,000 and $750,000 which is still chump change by Hollywood standards.\n\nEventually, the iconic horror film--directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez and produced by Henderson County's Hale--would gross more than $248 million dollars and become firmly ensconced in the annals of classic horror films. And that PROFIT MARGIN...whew.\n\nWell, don't look now, but The Blair Witch Project turns 25 this year, and it's time to celebrate. And since the Maryland woods were all booked up, the screening will be held Friday, September 13th (thoroughly appropriate) at Showplace Cinema East in Evansville, and Hale will be on hand to answer any of your questions.\n\nA Long List of Credits for Henderson County KY's Gregg Hale\n\nSince that auspicious debut a quarter-century ago, Gregg Hale has helmed multiple horror projects, working as a director/writer/producer on V/H/S 2, FreakyLinks, Exists, Lovely Molly, 50 States of Fright. He's currently set to produce a new film called Hooked Up. The Blair Witch screening is part of the Victory International Film Festival and presented in conjunction with Owensboro-based Blood Moon Pictures.\n\nThe movie begins at 7 PM, and tickets are $10."
