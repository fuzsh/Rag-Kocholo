        "text": "For our 21st Century Literature from the Philippines and the World (21CL) class, we were required to watch a play entitled “21 Chump Street” on YouTube. It premiered in a showcase put on by “This American Life”, held at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on June 7, 2014. It was written during the first half of the decade of the 2010s by the director and narrator of the play, Lin-Manuel Miranda.\n\nLin-Manuel is an American composer, lyricist, actor, singer, rapper, producer, and playwright. In writing the play, he took inspiration from other works or stories. One of these stories is found in the second act of episode #457 of a radio program entitled “This American Life” where a story about a teenage student falling for an undercover cop was told. It was also inspired by a movie entitled “21 Jump Street.”\n\nThe plot of the play revolves around a young man named Justin Laboy, played by Anthony Ramos, falling for a new student named Naomi Rodriguez, played by Lindsay Mendez. In an attempt to impress her, he looks for drugs to give her. His friends – Tevin played by Alex Boniello, Derek played by Gerard Canonico, and Andrew played by Antwaun Holley – help him with this process. In the end, Justin gets arrested because Naomi turned out to be an undercover cop.\n\nI really enjoyed the play; the different aspects – the plot, the acting, the scenery, the dialogue, and the music – and the overall performance were just really good. The plot was interesting for me. The actors were able to portray the characters well. The scenery was simple but nice. The dialogue along with the music was quite funny and enjoyable to watch. All of these together made a play that taught a valuable lesson without being boring at the same time.\n\nAs stated earlier, the play was written during the first half of the decade of the 2010s. From before then to now, drug use and selling, especially among teenagers and students, is a contemporary issue in the United States of America.\n\nAccording to Juergens (2020), many teenagers experiment with drugs, whether it be due to curiosity or peer pressure, without realizing that there could be consequences to their actions. Although in the play we don’t really see the usage of drugs being a problem, we still see how quite easily a teenage student was able to acquire some drugs.\n\nIn the play itself as well, Naomi mentions that she saw the effects of drugs when she was growing up. Because of this, she wants to make life safer one school at a time. Here, she is implying that drug use and selling is a real problem in many schools, specifically in the United States of America.\n\nThe main message that the director hoped to relay to the audience is the fact that there are consequences in life, and these consequences can be caused by many things. In the play for example, there were two things that caused Justin to face consequences – selling of drugs and desperation.\n\nWhen I first watched the play, I observed that Justin got arrested because he technically sold drugs on school premises. Here, the director was trying to tell us that when we do bad or illegal things, we will have to face consequences.\n\nWhen I critically analyzed the play though, I realized that Justin’s desperation is what really caused him to get arrested. Here, the director was trying to tell us that our desperation could blind us to do things that could cause us to face consequences.\n\nGenerally though, the idea or concept surrounding the play is the fact that our actions result in something, whether it be good or bad.\n\nThis message or theme is actually reflected by the literary elements of the play. As stated earlier, the plot talks about a teenage student named Justin Laboy falling for an undercover cop named Naomi Rodriguez. Due to his desperation to get her to go with him to prom, he looks for drugs to give her. After acquiring some, he gives it to her. However, she gave him money in exchange for it even though he didn’t want it. Since technically he sold drugs to her by doing this, he gets arrested.\n\nIn this plot, we see how the theme is being reflected. We see how desperate Justin is to get Naomi to go with him to prom. Because of this desperation, he looks for drugs to give her even if he isn’t a drug dealer, and this leads to him getting arrested. We see how his desperation and actions led to consequences.\n\nAlong with the plot, the characters of the play also reflected the theme of the play. As stated earlier, Justin’s desperation led to consequences. We saw how his actions led to him getting arrested. We also see the theme being reflected by Naomi. This is because throughout the play, she repeatedly says, “Seriously, these kids need to learn there are consequences in life.”\n\nEven the technical elements of the play reflected the theme of the play. One of these is the setting. There were two main settings in the play – the school where the background was blue lockers and the place where they got drugs where the background was a gray vandalized wall.\n\nAccording to The Incredible Art Department (n.d.), blue symbolizes calmness while gray symbolizes modesty. In the play, Justin was really calm when he was at school desperately trying to get Naomi to go with him to prom. On the other hand, when he was trying to acquire the drugs, there was some irony. This is because he should’ve done a modest amount of thinking on his actions; however, it was evident that he had not really thought about his actions that much because he still did something bad even if he knew it was wrong.\n\nAlong with the setting, the lights and sounds also helped effectuate this. When Justin was in the process of trying to acquire the drugs, the lighting was bright and the music was rather lively. When he started facing the consequences though, the lighting was rather dark and the music was somewhat slower and melancholic.\n\nFurthermore, three of the props used in the play were the pack of drugs, Naomi’s purse, and the money. These could actually represent different things. The pack of drugs could represent Justin’s naive and desperate self. Naomi’s purse could represent the trap he didn’t know he was walking into, and the money could represent Justin accepting the consequences. By putting the pack of drugs in Naomi’s purse and taking the money, Justin unknowingly walked into a trap that led to him facing some consequences.\n\nLastly, the performance elements of the play also reflected the theme. Anthony Ramos’s acting really showed that Justin was aware that he was doing something bad, but he was just really desperate to get Naomi to go to prom with him. He was able to show that Justin was really desperate and naive. On the other hand, Lindsay Mendez’s acting showed that Naomi was disappointed in the fact that kids don’t realize there are consequences in life. The acting showed that we could really be blinded by things like desperation, and this would lead to consequences.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that the director successfully and clearly expressed his message through the play. The simplest reason for this is the fact that the different elements of the play – literary elements, technical elements, and performance elements – reflected the message or theme. They showed that our desperation and actions could cause us to face consequences.\n\nI was actually able to relate to the play, especially to Justin. There were times in my life where my desperation blinded me to the point that I did things I knew were bad or wrong. In the end, I had to face some consequences. Because of these, I learned that I should control myself. By doing this, I will prevent myself from doing things that are wrong, and I will prevent myself from facing consequences.\n\nWatching, understanding, and critically analyzing the play were really enjoyable experiences for me. The play itself was really great, but the message it was trying to send or relay was even greater."
