        "text": "I, like a few I know, always tended to avoid the foreign language versions of classic Laurel and Hardy films. Not keen on effectively no understandable dialogue? Concerned that the comedy would suffer as the boys would be out of the ‘zone’ – needing to think about other things? Unhappy that our favourite members of the Roach ‘stock company’ would be replaced by actors not known to us? Well, probably all of these as well as a few more, I suppose. But have I been missing something? Mike Jones\n\nWell, I was sent a link to a couple of previously unseen clips (that is, unseen by me and the sender) of Stan and Ollie that were purported to be from deleted scenes from Be Big and Blotto. As one who always delights in seeing any Laurel and Hardy for the first time, I got quite excited about these. I asked around on the interweb to see if any others had seen the clips and it didn’t take long to establish that these weren’t deleted from the US / UK prints at all. Instead. they were actual sequences retained in La Vida Nocturna / Une Nuit Extravagante; the Spanish and French versions of Blotto and from Los Calaveras and Les Carrotiers; the Spanish and French versions of combinations of the three reel version of Laughing Gravy tacked onto Be Big.\n\nSo, clearly yes. I am missing something. The sequences from Be Big were very funny indeed and would have added so much to that interminable boot removal sequence. I can almost hear you exclaim “How dare I criticise a Laurel and Hardy film!” Okay, but if Randy Skretvedt in his splendid Laurel and Hardy – The Magic Behind the Movies can refer to the boot removal as an “excruciatingly protracted sequence“, then I rather think I’m in good company.\n\nFor what its worth, the foreign sequence I was sent from Blotto is less impressive, but it still falls into the category of ‘seeing some Laurel and Hardy for the first time’ so from that perspective, its still good!\n\nAnyway, based on these ‘discoveries’, I decided that I would take the plunge and watch Politiquerias, the Spanish version of Chickens Come Home, and see how I got on.\n\nIn case you don’t know, there was a period when the ‘dubbing’ of Stan and Ollie’s voices into existing English language prints by foreign actors was a cost-effective way of getting their comedies into the lucrative foreign markets. Before then, this wasn’t practicable so the boys would remake entire films, often with different supporting cast, but speaking their lines phonetically (reading from cue cards that were just out of the range of the cameras). In order to ensure the lines got the right intonation, word-for-word cue cards in English were held up alongside the phonetic ones. And they said that dubbing wasn’t practicable….\n\nAs I often do, I defer to Randy for an opening to this monologue-a-blog, and will refer again subsequently to his ‘The Magic Behind the Movies’ on several occasions as the definitive tome on all things Laurel and Hardy.\n\nRandy: “Once you’ve seen the Spanish version of Chickens Come Home, you will never forget it. At 56 minutes, it’s almost twice the length of the English-language version; ‘Chickens’ is a better, tighter film overall, but Politiquerias has some astounding moments that are utterly unlike anything else in a Laurel and Hardy Movie” Well, if that short quote doesn’t spark your interest there seems little point in you reading on…\n\n“Utterly unlike anything else” is indeed the case when we consider what can best be described as ‘the filler’ used to lengthen the movie to a mini-feature for an overseas audience and a distributor, who presumably would be paying more for 56 minutes than they would for 20 minutes (or 30 minutes in the case of Chickens Come Home’).\n\nThis ‘padding’ largely consists of a largely uninspiring magician – Abraham J. Cantu, and a nauseating, in my humble opinion, ‘regurgitator’ going by the name of Hadji Ali. Virtually all of the other additional footage used to lengthen the movie features at least one of Stan, Babe or Fin though, and for these alone, it is well worth the entrance fee!\n\nIn the Spanish version, Linda Loredo plays the Mrs Hardy role, which was brilliantly portrayed by Thelma Todd in Chickens. The Mae Busch ‘old flame’ character is taken by Rina De Liguoro though perhaps not quite so formidably. Axe-toting Señora Laurel was Carmen Granada, where Norma Drew played her in ‘Chickens. Busy-body Patsy O’Byrne is replaced by virtual doppelganger Nelly Fernández, but happily, Jimmy Finlayson recreated his role as the butler – or el Criado. Strangely though, frequent stand-in / stunt double for Stan, Ham Kinsey, is replaced as the elevator operator in Politiquerias by Charlie Hall. This seems odd though as neither elevator operator has any lines in either version…\n\nThe entire Fertiliser Company office staff are replaced with Spanish-speaking counterparts, and of course we have the Magician – Abraham J. Cantu , and the regurgitator – Hadji Ali, to contend with.\n\nWe do know that neither Stan nor Babe were fluent in any other language, and it shows, though I have to say that I felt that Babe seems to make a better fist of pronunciation than Stan. I may be doing Stan a disservice here of course; a Spanish speaker may have a completely opposite opinion. Stan may, in fact be a natural: Its just that, to me, where Babe comes across as reasonably comfortable in his enunciation, Stan sounds very unfluent indeed. (Is that even a word?)\n\nI understand that most of the dialogue-free sequences were taken from the English-speaking version of the film, where clearly that could not be the case where the cast have any lines. That being said, there – apparently – were two cameras on set, side by side shooting the same action and as a result, there are noticeable, though negligible, differences in camera angles to be seen if you run the two side by side. I didn’t…\n\nI’ve always known that Politiquerias is significantly longer than ‘Chickens’, so in an attempt to try and see some of the differences between the two versions for myself, I diligently watched Chickens Come Home and then Politiquerias one after the other, having topped up my glass first. So while the former was reasonably fresh in my mind, this is what I noted, and the approximate running time at which I noted it. There are more differences of course, but these are the more obvious ones:\n\n1:44: Ollie, or in this instance, Senor ‘Ardy summons a member of staff, and a gentleman, Senor Robert, arrives. Ollie then tells Robert to call for another employee which he does and leaves, and a young lady, Señorita Tula appears. She in turn is asked to request the presence Senor Turich. Señorita Tula departs and Senor Turich walks in. Senor Hardy asks him to get Señorita Embtree, who eventually has to invite Ollie’s General Manager, Senor Laurel, to his office. In ‘Chickens’, Stan’s appearance is requested by the first employee to attend Ollie. I suppose this sequence is used to show how important the Laurel and Hardy (Dealers in High-Grade Fertiliser) company is, that Ollie is in absolute charge: and, of course, that he does this because he is a shoe-in for Mayor. Additionally, of course, because he can!\n\n3:30: On his appearance – from the ‘samples’ room – Stan swishes the insect swatter to emphasise the fact that there might have been a fly or two in there.\n\n9:50: Babe’s eye movement to the phonetic cue cards is clearly visible at this point, though much less so than in other foreign versions, particularly of Berth Marks. (which is combined with The Laurel-Hardy Murder Case to make a Spanish release, Noche de Duendes). This being another, earlier example of pandering to, or extracting extra revenue from, an overseas distributor. Referring again to the earlier mentioned phrase “excruciatingly protracted sequence“. In Berth Marks, the upper bunk sequence is surely as overlong as the boot removal in Be Big?\n\n18:10: The dinner party appears a rather formal occasion and comprises 10 guests including Senor and Señora Hardy. They all take longer to repair to the parlour to be ‘entertained’. There are only six dinner guests in Chickens Come Home in what comes across as a more relaxed get-together rather than an occasion.\n\n18:30: The start of a much longer – and more intense – exchange with the Butler (still James Finlayson, who is tremendous in this!)\n\n19:00: Senor ‘Ardy introduces the first ‘act’ to entertain his guests; Cantu,a magician. There are regular shots which cut between a clearly nervous Ollie, a mugging Fin and said magician. There is also a small band in the background whose instruments rarely reflect the music we are hearing. Note that the magician stubs a cigarette out on the Hardy carpet! This either isn’t noticed by Señora Hardy, or perhaps this was acceptable behaviour in 1930’s Spain!\n\n23:25: The magician pulls literally dozens of bits of silk etc from the butler’s person resulting in a typical Finlayson glare. I think it best not to speculate what some of the ‘bits of fabric’ actually are!\n\n24:30: Fin gets one over superbly on the magician by producing a pack of cards from behind the latter’s ear!\n\n26:20: Ollie does a small ‘prance’ and twirl and then encourages his guests to dance to distract Señora Hardy so that…\n\n27:05: …he can attempt to leave; Naturally though, he is quickly rumbled by her.\n\n28:30: Ollie makes another escape attempt but Señora ‘Ardy is waiting outside for him. They come back into the house and she adroitly destroys his hat and overcoat.\n\n29:05: Senor ‘Ardy introduces the second act to entertain his guests: Hadji Ali. The act proceeds to drink what looks like a gallon or two of water, and then ‘regurgitates’ it in long seemingly endless streams. Yuk!\n\n31:00: Hadji Ali sprays a lengthy stream of water onto Fin’s bald head, drenching him. The act goes on… including the swallowing of hazelnuts and making them, er, reappear, swallowing kerosene and ‘breathing’ fire causing a conflagration which he then puts out with more water he found, still somewhere within his person.\n\nI feel that I need to make an observation at this point: Besides the fact that I find the actions of Mr Ali at best disturbing, remember that Senor Hardy is running for political office! What candidate would want to impress supporters at a black tie party with entertainment provided by somebody who starts a fire in his own parlour and then belches a long, rainbow spray of water to extinguish the flames?\n\n36:20: We are back in the old flame’s apartment and Stan arrives complete with hangar still in his overcoat, just like in ‘Chickens’. A very noticeable difference between the Tina De Liguoro ‘old-flame’ photograph and the Mae Busch version is seen again at this point. In an acknowledgement to a perhaps more liberated European audience, Ms De Liguoro is sat astride a bathing-suited Senor ‘Ardy at the beach where Mae Busch sits on the shoulders of a bath-robed Senor Hardy (see below).\n\n41:40: Señora ‘Ardy delivers a splendid Thelma Todd-esque sock to the Hardy chin following his latest attempt to depart to thwart the impending uninvited arrival of the old-flame.\n\n46:26: Ollies “Wrong Number” results in a perfectly delivered vase onto his cranium by his increasingly suspicious wife.\n\n47:00 Stan’s coat hanger snags and tangles in the curtain, similarly to in ‘Chickens’ and then disappears without explanation, also just like in ‘Chickens’,\n\nIncidentally, at this point, the busy-body comes out of a door right opposite the old-flame’s apartment. What a strange coincidence, don’t you think?\n\nThe rest of the film runs very similarly to Chickens Come Home though we do get to enjoy Ollie singing a Spanish version of ‘Somebody’s Coming to My House’. However, there is much more interaction and exchange of ‘hush-money’ between Ollie and Fin and some of this is very well done indeed. There is also clear use of the same footage in which the busy-body neighbours car is completely destroyed by the old-flame character – with semi-conscious Stan – reversing into it.\n\nI was ready and waiting for a different version of one of my favourite Ollie howls: When he sits on the accidentally visible picture frame to hide it from the view of his wife: His plaintive ‘Oooh’s and Aaaah’s’ as the broken glass crunches and grinds beneath his posterior always have me in stitches.\n\nHowever, this sequence both appears and sounds identical to the ‘Chickens’ version, which was a bit of a surprise. Oooh’s and Aaaah’s’ are, after all, technically dialogue – even though no specific words are uttered. However, I suppose that ‘Ooooh’ and ‘Aaaah’ have a similar meaning in Spanish as they do in virtually any language!\n\nAt a recent Beau Chumps ‘virtual meeting’, the discussion topic was Politiquerias. Original Chump, Ian S, observed that [Chickens Come Home] “is one of my favourite L&H shorts so I found the whole Spanish version fascinating, especially the Boys’ varying success with the language. The whole of the middle section with the regurgitator and magician hardly seemed necessary and tested my patience several times. It was good to see Fin get more screen time in this version.“\n\nI think we all agreed that the padding was indeed just that and a tighter edited version – ie: without any of the magician and regurgitator sequences would have made for a better film. Mind you, and I’m going to contradict myself here, I’d definitely have found a way to keep the sequence where Fin pulls the pack of cards from the magicians lughole though. Priceless!\n\nAs I hope that I have been able to illustrate, there is an awful lot of business in here that you won’t have seen before and I intend to finish how I started – in leaving the final word to Randy: “Truly an astonishing movie. Is easily the most enjoyable of all the surviving Laurel and Hardy Spanish-language pictures.”\n\nI can’t really disagree with that. There is so much here to enjoy, and if like me you’ve avoided Politiquerias in the past, watch it. Now. I just really struggle with the regurgitation sequences though, but perhaps that’s just me…\n\nI know I said I was finished but when researching this piece, I found this article http://www.jbkaufman.com/movie-of-the-month/politiquerias-1931from March, 2013 which is very interesting, offering a similar though different perspective to mine. See what you think!\n\nIf you want to read more on Hadji Ali, read on as coincidentally, I was browsing through Willie McIntyres old printed Bowler Dessert editions and chanced across the below in BD#54 from Summer 1998. It’s a short piece by David Wallachinsky from BigStar which is undated.\n\nDo you pay good money to watch someone throw up? Thousands once did, gladly, on both sides of the Atlantic. Born in Egypt in 1892, Hadji Ali travel to the United States in the early 1930s appearing in fairs carnivals and vaudeville. Billed variously as The Amazing Regurgitator and the Egyptian Enigma, Ali would swallow a variety of household objects – coins, buttons, stones, watermelon seeds, hickory nuts, costume jewelry, even live goldfish – and wash them down with copious amounts of water. Then as audience members called out specific itemes, he would spit them up, one at a time.\n\nAli required a small but enthusiastic following; his grand finale brought down the house every night. His assistant would set up a toy castle in a corner of the stage while Ali gulped down a gallon of water chased with a point of kerosene. To the accompaniment of a dramatic drumroll. he would spit out the kerosene in a six-foot arc across the stage, setting the Castle on fire. Then with the flames shooting high into the air Ali would upchuck the water and extinguish all traces of the fire.\n\nAli remained a more a sideshow curiosity than a true vaudeville entertainer. According to Joe Laurie Jr in his book ‘Vaudeville: from Honky Tonks to the Palace’ Ali lasted four weeks in one theater before they got why’s that he was killing their supper shows.\n\nEven so, Ali’s remarkable talent was recorded in at least three films: Strange as it Seems, a 1930s short subject, Politiquerias and Gizmo, a documentary films in the 1930s that is occasionally shown on cable television. He was also featured in Grauman’s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood from 1930 to 1931. He died during a theatrical Tour of Britain in 1937. Oddly, David Wallachinsky makes no mention of Politiquerias being a Laurel and Hardy film.\n\nI do have a vague recollection of Ali being called out, at around this time as using some sort of special effect to produce the remarkable streams of fluid etc. But in another coincidence, there were two respondents to that claim in Bowler Dessert and a 25 year-old Mike Jones was one of them. The other is some chap called Skretvedt who you might have heard of…\n\nThe Regurgitation act is still alive and well! There’s a chap from one of those British countries (Huh? What was I on about there?) called Stevie Starr who does an act very much like Ali. His main thing is light bulbs, though. It’s a fantastic trick to see but not an easy one to do. For many years, audiences were convinced that Ali was really doing what he seemed to be doing. MJ\n\nYou mean that Ali wasn’t really regurgitating that water and those Hazelnuts? Then where the hell did all that stuff come from? Hey, call me gullible but I really think that Ali was doing what he seemed to be doing. That water and everything else is clearly coming out of his mouth and when he did this act on stage he surely didn’t have the advantage of tricky film editing. RS"
