        "text": "\"Lin-Manuel Miranda continues to prove his immense talent with a funny, alive, endearing, and interesting show that explores a world of teenage love\" — Michael Kras, The Cast Album Review\n\n\"This would be a great musical with a great score even if it hadn't been written in such an admirably short time... but the fact that it was created that fast says even more about it. Lin-Manuel Miranda continues to prove his immense talent with a funny, alive, endearing, and interesting show that explores a world of teenage love and the complications surrounding Justin's unknowing infatuation with an undercover police officer, and how the officer uses this to her advantage to make an arrest. There's a moral ambiguity here that makes for fascinating theatre, supported by a memorable score that leaves us wanting more. As it is, 21 Chump Street is a delicious little bite-sized musical that's totally satisfying.\" — Michael Kras, The Cast Album Review\n\n\"The evening’s melodic highlight belonged to Lin-Manuel Miranda’s 21 Chump Street. Giddy and bittersweet, this quickie musical adapts a tale of bad romance that was broadcast in 2012 on the “What I Did For Love” episode of This American Life.\" — Alexis Soloski, New York Times"
