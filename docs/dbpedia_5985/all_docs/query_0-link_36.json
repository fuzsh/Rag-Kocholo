        "text": "Whether it's Sylvester Stallone putting on the iconic Rocky Balboa boxing trunks or Michael B. Jordan carrying the torch as protégé Adonis Creed, the \"Rocky\" movies have always had pop culture punch.\n\nThe Oscar-winning 1976 original introduced audiences to an all-time classic underdog story that spawned a rousing narrative that's ongoing, as Jordan's back in action with \"Creed III\" (in theaters now). The \"Rocky\"-verse has given us a pair of unforgettable ring masters, colorful villains, memorable love interests and crowd-pleasing, seat-of-your-pants championship bouts.\n\nIn honor of the newest franchises, we're ranking all the \"Rocky\" and \"Creed\" films, from worst to best:\n\n9. 'Rocky V' (1990)\n\nRocky and wife Adrian (Talia Shire) usually had a litany of hardships to deal with but this much is ridiculous: The champ is broke and is forced to retire because of brain damage as he returns to his working-class Philadelphia roots and trains young fighter Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison). He turns out to be a chump and he and Rocky face off in a street fight that can't hold a candle to any of the other climactic film matches.\n\n8. 'Creed II' (2018)\n\nThis one is all about the fathers and sons: Adonis is publicly challenged for the title by Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu), a Russian as intimidating as his big bad dad Ivan (Dolph Lundgren) – who by the way killed Adonis' father in a match. Rocky initially doesn't want to train Adonis for the fight but comes around (and faces Ivan again) for a film better with the Shakespearean drama than the in-ring theatrics.\n\n7. 'Rocky Balboa' (2006)\n\nNow a widower, Rocky runs a small Italian restaurant and is estranged from his son Robert (Milo Ventimiglia). The aging pugilist is goaded back into the game by Mason \"The Line\" Dixon (Antonio Tarver), a champ hungry for the kind of respect Rocky once garnered. Robert and Rocky work through their differences on their way to the Big Fight in a surprisingly good franchise entry that delivers on a bunch of emotional callbacks.\n\n6. 'Rocky II' (1979)\n\nAfter taking Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) to the limit, Rocky agrees when Adrian calls for his retirement but has a hard time making ends meet and misses the ring. Obsessed to have a rematch, Apollo publicly mocks Rocky and our hero starts training again with Mickey (Burgess Meredith). While the sequel mainly sticks to the original's successful formula, the second (and better) Apollo/Rocky fight is a fantastic, white-knuckle climax.\n\n5. 'Rocky IV' (1985)\n\nThe one where our hero ends the Cold War! After his latest title win, Rocky watches in horror as a high-profile exhibition match between Apollo and Soviet super man Ivan Drago ends in tragedy. To avenge his old friend's death, Rocky ventures to Russia to train for a Christmas showdown against the impossibly fearsome Drago on his home turf. Cheesy, showy and patriotic, but, boy, does it all work in heart-pounding fashion.\n\n4. 'Creed III' (2023)\n\nSeveral years after hanging up his gloves, Adonis reunites with childhood friend and former boxing prodigy Damian Anderson (Jonathan Majors), who's spent two decades in prison and wants Adonis' help at a title shot. This underdog story takes a dark turn and the pals turn foes. As a first-time director, Jordan crafts nifty, anime-influenced ring matches and Majors' \"Diamond Dame\" is the best \"Rocky\" antagonist since Apollo.\n\n3. 'Rocky III' (1982)\n\nAfter finally defeating Apollo, Rocky enjoys the fruits of success and celebrity until brash upstart Clubber Lang (Mr. T) arrives and annihilates the champ, who gets trained up for a rematch by none other than Apollo. It's the most 1980s \"Rocky\" entry, giving us not only \"Eye of the Tiger\" but also Hulk Hogan's Thunderlips, and the intensity of the Clubber/Rocky feud nicely matches the inspiration of the Apollo/Rocky bromance.\n\n2. 'Creed' (2015)\n\nThe franchise was down and out on the mat when Jordan, Stallone and director Ryan Coogler gave it new life. Angry and bitter toward his late father, young Adonis ventures to Philly to ask Rocky to train him. The stirring, feel-good chapter checks all the \"Rocky\" boxes – from montages to old-school references – yet Jordan and Stallone are what drive the plot as a lost youngster and the father figure he desperately needs.\n\n1. 'Rocky' (1976)\n\nThere is a reason why every underdog story in the past 45-plus years is compared to the original, which won best picture at the Oscars. Stallone became a household name playing the headstrong southpaw who falls in love with the local pet-shop girl, is put through the weirdest workouts ever (thanks, Mick!) and gets the opportunity of a lifetime when the cocky Apollo needs an opponent. And of course he becomes the first of many to underestimate the Italian Stallion.\n\nRead more about the 'Rocky'-verse:"
