Please visit the site for a plethora of funny tid-bits on Chump Change including the covers that didn't make it.\n\nI picked up a DVD copy of Chump Change from Honk Kong with Japanese subtitles and the original poster as the cover. I find it interesting that this movie has already been around the world.\n\nEnjoy,\n\nSteve Meisner\n\n04/05/04\n\nHowdy Fellow Chumps -\n\nThanks to you all, Chump Change is a DVD hit! We wanted to let you know that the 'official' Chump website is finally up and running (http://www.chumpchangethemovie.com/ ) - it's truly the one-stop shop for all things Chump. Heck, you can even buy the movie through it. If so inclined, you can also peruse some of the great reviews we've received, not to mention all sorts of other chump nonsense.\n\nAlso folks, we want to encourage all of you and yours to go to the industry standard website (http://www.imdb.com) and place your vote for Chump. Somehow the scoring is all screwed up for us. Chump's median score is 10 and our arithmetic average is 8.4 - but the 'weighted score' works out to only 3.7! We can't figure it out and when we contacted IMDB their only response was \"it'll work out when more people vote\". Duh. So, please spread the word - and help us get out the vote! (though one vote per chump only, please.)\n\nThank you again for all your support through the long years of getting Chump Change out there to the audience. Stay tuned as we hope to be emailing you an announcement regarding our next movie - soon!\n\nAll our best,\n\nSteve & Margo\n\naka The Burrows of Hollywood\n\nP.S. Just found out our Chump Change website has won a Golden Webby! (whatever that is.)\n\n2/10/04\n\nHowdy Folks -\n\nGreat news for Chump Change. We just got our first review from a national publication - Entertainment Weekly, no less! In the February 13th issue (the Survivor cover) Entertainment Weekly gave Chump an A for our just released DVD. We're right in between Lost in Translation (A), Rain Man (A-), and the Coen Brothers (C). We're on page 59.\n\nOur little movie has finally gone public - nationwide. Many thanks to all who helped us get there. Also, check out the new official Chump Change website @ http://www.chumpchangethemovie.com/ .\n\nSteve & Margo\n\nThe Burrows of Hollywood\n\n01/17/04\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nSHOW ME THE CHUMP CHANGE!\n\nMiramax releases Milwaukee native's award-winning film on DVD\n\nFresh off a successful showing at the inaugural Milwaukee International Film Festival, where it earned rave reviews and sold out the historic Oriental Theater for the first time since 1987, \"Chump Change\" is hitting DVD shelves around the country.\n\nStarring Milwaukee native Stephen Burrows, who also wrote and directed the film, \"Chump Change\" is a fast-paced comedy based on Burrows' real-life experiences in Hollywood and Wisconsin. In addition to the film, which stars Tim Matheson, Traci Lords, Jerry Stiller, Anne Meara, Abe Vigoda and Fred Willard, the \"Chump Change\" DVD features a director's commentary, a director's commentary on the director's commentary, behind-the-scenes footage, outtakes, deleted scenes and an interview with Traci Lords, to mention a few.\n\n\"Miramax put together an entertaining DVD that builds on the humor of the film and gives viewers about four-and-a-half hours of laughs for chump change,\" Said Burrows. \"I'm excited that the hundreds of people who put their heart and soul into this project can now pay from $15 to $30 for a movie they didn't get paid to work on.\"\n\n\"Chump Change\" is now available on BN.com, Amazon.com, Video.com, Blockbuster.com, Buy.com, deepdiscount.com, Borders.com, etc. and in Barnes & Noble stores, Suncoast Video, Best Buy, etc.\n\nBurrows will sign copies of the DVD and participate in a Q&A and discussion with fans at the following location:\n\nFriday Jan. 23, 7 p.m.\n\nBarnes & Noble\n\nMayfair Mall\n\n(414) 475-6070\n\nMiramax picked up \"Chump Change\" at the HBO/U.S. Comedy Arts Festival after it earned the Best Actress Award for Traci Lords, as well as the Audience Award for Best Picture. The film includes numerous notable Wisconsin landmarks, including the world's largest six-pack (LaCrosse), the world's largest stuffed fish/museum (Hayward), the world's largest talking cow (Neilsville), Milwaukee's Mitchell Park Domes and Steve Meisner and his Band.\n\n12/2/03\n\nHowdy Chumps -\n\nJust a quick completely impersonal update following the Chump Change premiere in Milwaukee.\n\nOn November 7, for the first time in history, the palatial Oriental Theatre sold out its 1,200 seats, and turned away 500 poor folks freezing their arses off in 10 degree weather for the premiere of Chump. It was insanity gone mad -red carpets, cleg lights, accordion players, Shriners, attractive young gals handing out 3\" pieces of cut-up Chump film print, an organist playing everything from On Wisconsin to Lady of Spain, a plethora of cast and crew members including Traci Lords, an after-party, an after-after party, an after-after-after party - whew!\n\nOur press was exceptional (to check some of it out):\n\nhttp://www.madison.com/archives/read.php?ref=wsj:2003:11:23:289126:ARTS\n\nhttp://milwaukee.about.com/b/a/041307.htm\n\nhttp://www.jsonline.com/onwisoncinc/movies/nov03/184058.asp?showheadlines=all\n\nhttp://www.jsonline.com/onwisconsin/movies/nov03/182959.asp\n\nAnd we found out there's already a run on pre-ordering the film\n\n(through http://www.amazon.com or http://www.blockbuster.com ). This has always been the little film that could, and we thank you all for all the amazing support along the way.\n\nOur release January 20 is inevitable - Chump will finally belong to the audience it was made for.\n\nHave a great holiday season.\n\nAll our best,\n\nThe Burrows of Hollywood"
