I hope the plane can take off after they load my luggage! Maybe Randy will loan me a steamer trunk?\n\nRandy, maybe the Observation bar would be a better place for those drinks. Sir Winstons' is formal and I'm not bring my tux. Although it might be fun to wear it in Las Vegas on my second leg of our trip. I'd feel like Sean Connery all dressed up for the Casino! If Long beach or Vegas doesn't work for you, Meet me at the \"Top of the Mark\", the bar at the Mark Hopkins in San Francisco, the third leg of our trip. Damn, I sure hope Avis has a Cadillac for me and all this driving!\n\nDavid\n\n>>>>>The Queen Mary was shown throughout the whole episode. Mulder and Scully somehow get thrown into a time warp and all of a sudden, they are aboard her in the late 1930's. Some of her interiors were shown and it was really well done. It was great to see a famous ocean liner tossed into the mix of the show, so I quite enjoyed watching it. <<<<<\n\nJason,\n\nThis has to be one of my favorite episodes of the X-files. If I remember correctly, the episode was shot in wide screen format (which when it was filmed, wide screen format TV shows were not as common practice as it is today and were just reserved for special episodes). I remember they played it off as an \"X-files Special Event\". The cinematographers did a great job lighting the QM, there hasn't been a film that has captured the true beauty of the QM like this episode did.\n\n>>>>I saw a video recently for a Fiona Apple song that was shoot in one of the Queen's first class cabins, a passageway, the bridge and first class lounge.<<<\n\nJohn,\n\nI have seen that video, and I must say, while I am no Fiona Apple fan, her music videos are always good. This one especially considering it was shot on the QM. My only problem was the way in which they used the First Class Swimming Pool.... you could see the already crumbling tiles popping off into the air right in the video. This makes me wonder if Joseph Prevratil and the QSDI even monitor the activity of film makers. But all in all, a good video.
