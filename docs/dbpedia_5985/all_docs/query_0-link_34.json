        "text": "I well remember the excitement when I first learned that possibly my favourite film, Way Out West, had been digitally enhanced and put through a new process called ‘Colorization’. This would be about 1984, I think, and I simply couldn’t wait to feast my eyes on Laurel and Hardy in colour for the first time. Mike Jones reports.\n\nThe ‘Colorized’ Films\n\nAnyway, that opportunity came just over a year later at the UK Laurel and Hardy Convention in Blackpool over the May Bank Holiday weekend in 1986 when well over a hundred of us sat down in the ‘cinema’ in Pontins eagerly anticipating the first dawn of this new world. Just how good would this be? Would the images be sharp and well defined? How many colours would be used? Would ‘Colorization’ open up a new market of younger fans? The list of questions was endless and I do recall being somewhat nervous as the lights went down.\n\nWell, I do remember thoroughly enjoying being in a crowd of like-minded ‘Sons’ to watch Laurel and Hardy on the big screen. There’s no better way to enjoy the boys’ antics as you know, and as usual I loved the movie and laughed harder than usual. But I also recall being a little underwhelmed, the expectations of a ‘colour’ film I had in my mind had not quite been met, but many around me were blown away, so I thought it must just have been me. Perhaps they were just ‘in the zone’ at the time, but I mean, reflections in the mirrors in Mickey Finn’s palace were still black and white! What was that about?\n\nWhen the ‘colour’ Virgin videos were released, I like many, was in the queue on release day with many around me extolling the virtues of the ‘new’ films. I was buying them out of curiosity and, I suppose, loyalty.\n\nThen the 21-disc DVD set came out in the UK and what purported to be ‘better’ colour versions were included, but still, ‘Colorization’ wasn’t for me. Yes, I wanted to own them so I could dip in if I fancied it, but I only ever watched the original versions… until the granddaughters came along. See below and more on that later.\n\nAnyway, here we are almost 35 years later and while it is clear the process has improved massively, I’m still not a fan. I consider myself something of a purist. If the films were made in black and white, really, shouldn’t they be viewed in black and white? They were lit, staged, costumed and angled all to optimise the monochrome medium (and the talents of the crew) so surely we do them all a disservice on viewing versions they had no hand in ‘enhancing’?\n\nIn case you didn’t know, in 1983, original Laurel and Hardy producer, Hal Roach studios, became one of the first studios to use computerised film colourisation and began creating digitally coloured versions of some of its films. Firstly Topper, and Way Out West (both originally made in 1937), became the first black-and-white films to be redistributed in colour using the digital ‘Colorization’ process. This however, perhaps inevitably lead to controversy. While it would allow black-and-white films to perhaps be open to new audiences, the process was crude and many detractors including James Stewart, John Huston, George Lucas and Woody Allen claimed that even if it were refined, it would not take into account lighting compositions chosen for black-and-white photography which would not necessarily be as effective in colour.\n\nSo, is it just me then? Well, the answer, clearly, is a firm “no”. With these far more learned detractors, it seems that I’m not alone. Additionally, when screening films at tent meetings when there is a colour version available, the question is always asked. Needless to say, we’re still to screen a colourised version of any film at a Beau Chumps tent meeting.\n\nNaturally, I also asked my fellow Chumps what they thought, and first ‘out of the hat’ was original Chump Ian with whom I was sat in that draughty Pontins building in 1986. Ian: I was reasonably excited back in the day when I heard that work was under way to colorize some Laurel & Hardy films. When they eventually appeared, I lapped them up but the novelty was short-lived as I found myself getting very critical with them, perhaps too harshly, picking fault with some of the colours used etc. etc. Basically, as a purist, I yearned for the “warmth” and familiarity of good old black and white. Watching a colorized L&H film followed immediately by a black and white one shows you how unnatural looking the colour films can be. I’m not totally dismissing the colour films but, in the world of Laurel & Hardy, monochrome is king.\n\nI was having lunch in the HMV staff room one day and was watching an L&H short, I forget which one now. One of my younger colleagues came in and noticed that on the menu I could have chosen the colour version of the film so why didn’t I? I played him five minutes of the colorized version and he was raving about how good it looked (should have gone to Specsavers?). The same kid also wouldn’t watch subtitled films as they were “too much hassle” so make of that what you will.\n\nTo me, Laurel & Hardy in colour will always be something of a fake novelty and I rarely sit down to view a colorized film of theirs. A few years ago I watched a colorized version of ‘It’s A Wonderful Life‘ and it was okay but just didn’t feel right. “Watch it as it was meant to be” is the phrase I think I am grasping for here. One of my all time favourites is Hitchcock’s ‘Psycho‘, one of the most famous and iconic black and white films ever. It has never been colorized and I would be appalled if it ever happened. Hopefully there are steps in place to prevent it.\n\n‘Continuity Vizier’ Anth made a great point: I don’t know if you have seen the Peter Jackson documentary ‘They Shall Not Grow Old’ where he colourised World War One footage? This looks absolutely amazing, a lot of money spent and it’s state of the art technology. If the boys’ films were given this same treatment then I would be interested. Black and white can be beautiful and modern directors still use it to this day. Bong Joon Ho who directed the Oscar winning film ‘Parasite‘, re-released it in black and white and they say it gives the film a whole new feel and most preferred it.\n\nI have nephews who say they are big film fans but won’t watch old black and white movies. Can’t get my head around that one and I must admit I am with Ian on this one; It doesn’t look or feel right to me and I think that has a lot to do with quality and mostly nostalgia.\n\nYou’re Darn Tootin’ tent Grand Sheik and honorary Chump Andrew has a slightly different view, but the same conclusion: I don’t see anything wrong with colourising any black and white film as long as it’s done well. I remember buying VHS tapes of Laurel and Hardy in the early 1990s which contained colourised versions. The colours weren’t very convincing. Ollie’s jacket, in particular, appeared as a washed out blue/grey and the greens and browns looked a bit off as well. I can’t remember if Stan’s red hair was accurately represented, though.\n\nThe thing about colourisation in the early 1990s is that it actually ‘looked’ computerised, as if the process had been untouched by human hand, and ​I think the most disappointing film is/was Towed in a Hole. I haven’t seen it in colour for ages but I seem to remember their gloves were an unconvincing mucky grey colour and the paint that Ollie was using was an unconvincing dark green.*\n\nThe colourisation in the DVD collection is better but still pretty poor, I think. I haven’t seen any up-to-date colourisation but the Way Out West image above and those that follow below look beautiful. They’re a pleasure to look at as whoever created them obviously took pride in their work. It must be the depth of the colour that makes them look so good but I think it would cost a lot to produce a similar effect in the films.\n\nGive the viewer the choice between black and colour and colourised but, whichever they chose, at least they would still be watching the films. I would probably plump for black and white. Other, younger viewers may prefer colour but, as long as they’re watching Stan and Ollie, it doesn’t really bother me.\n\n*An unconvincing dark green? Hmm. I wasn’t sure what Andrew would think of the ‘pinky-lilac’ the paint is in the colourised still from Towed in a Hole below, so naturally, I asked him…\n\nAndrew: My memory might be at fault re the green paint in Towed in a Hole. The paint in this still is a much more pleasing colour. I agree with Henry Ford – ‘You can have any colour you like as long as it’s ‘pinky lilac’. Ha ha! And so say all of us!\n\nChumps Vice Sheik Peter is also on the same page: When the colour versions came out and I received a couple of copies, my first thoughts before watching them were great, I’m going to see Stan and Babe as they really appeared and looked like in the flesh so to speak. My thought behind the idea of being in colour was to appeal to a more younger up to date modern audience and that the thought was to gain new following from in an age of high definition colour like everything that was being produced.\n\nBut when I started to watch them in colour I took a dislike to them. For me they just did not seem right. The colours seemed to take your attention away somewhat from the main action and made me start looking at the surroundings in the scenes and taking away the old fashioned feel of days when the world was only in black and white. I have just finished watching both versions of Oliver The Eighth and have to say that for me the B & W version wins hands down. It looks as if the colour version is grainy and a little blurred and again as I said earlier I was being drawn in to looking at the background rather than the great visuals of Jitters playing cards and Stan, Babe and Mae Busch eating their delicious but invisible dinner.\n\nWell, that seems pretty conclusive. I suppose it’s nice to know the ‘Colorized’ versions are there, but not something us traditionalists would be likely to miss. Anyway, that’s enough on the ‘Colorized’ films; the consensus doesn’t seem to be massively positive, but what do you think?\n\nWhat about the Actual Colour Films?\n\nIt is well known that the only Laurel and Hardy film that was shot in colour was Tree in a Test Tube. However, Stan and Babe (as Ali-Bek and Murza-Bek) also appeared in The Rogue Song – A Lawrence Tibbett vehicle that has been missing for many years (other than a couple of short sequences, a trailer and the soundtrack discs). There were also two Laurel and Hardy features that had ‘colour rumours’ surrounding them. Read on…\n\nThe Rogue Song was filmed in early ‘Two-Color Technicolor’ and ran for 108 minutes. It was premiered in Hollywood on January 17th, 1930 and was MGM’s first ‘all-talking, all-colour’ film. Production began in August 1929 and in September, MGM announced that it had borrowed Laurel and Hardy from Hal Roach (at $4,000 per week) to play “two burlesque desperadoes” as comedy relief in the film that Hal Roach had suggested was too sombre.\n\nSo Roach both sowed the seeds and sold the boys’ services, for the equivalent of $60,800 per week in 2020 numbers! Laurel and Hardy have 11 scenes in the film totalling 14 minutes but it seems only two of these were with Tibbett.\n\nThe ‘colour’ technology used in the film quickly became outdated as colour processes improved, so it was never re-released after 1930 at which point it all but disappeared. MGM’s print was destroyed in a fire, but a complete set of soundtrack discs still exist and their content was released in the 80’s. Around that time a three-minute clip of a Laurel and Hardy ‘bear cave’ sequence was discovered and preserved and a trailer which includes footage of the boys in a ‘cheese sequence has also surfaced.\n\nThe Tree In A Test Tube was filmed on Saturday November 29th, 1941 on 16mm Color Kodachrome stock and was a educational movie made to extoll the virtues of wood products in helping the US war effort. The film, made to be shown in schools, libraries, churches and civic meetings, was shot with no sound on the Fox back-lot in West Los Angeles, and the sequence featuring Stan and Babe lasts around four and-a-half minutes. Being effectively the boys first silent since 1929’s Angora Love, a voice-over was needed and the guilty party was perennial narrator, Pete Smith, with various sound effects.\n\nThis is merely a curio, not a Laurel and Hardy Movie in the basest sense, but arguably more likeable than some of the ‘big-studio’ stuff that they were making around this time.\n\nBabes in Toyland aka March of the Wooden Soldiers was rumoured to have been planned as a colour release. The Babes in Toyland ‘story’ began in December 1933 when Roach wrote a treatment of the Victor Herbert operetta that Stan was very unhappy with. Shooting finally started in late June and was completed in November 1934.\n\nThe village of Toyland was built on sound stages at Hal Roach Studios with the buildings painted in vivid storybook colours, leading Stan to regret that the film wasn’t shot in Technicolor. However, the three-strip Technicolor process that captured the entire spectrum was just being introduced to live-action movies at the time ‘Babes’ began filming. Randy Skretvedt, in his amazing ‘The Magic Behind the Movies‘ suspects the expense of shooting in Technicolor would have been prohibitive for Roach.\n\nIt was also long thought that Swiss Miss was originally shot in colour. Co-star, Della Lind is known to have said “it was originally a colour film” and it is also known that several of the first shooting days were spent in the making of some colour test footage. Hal Roach had already made a short film in colour (with Constance Bennett) some months before, and indeed originally intended that Swiss Miss would be in colour too, but seemingly changed his mind during the first week of production, again because of the cost. Stan’s first wife, Lois, who was on the set with their daughter (also Lois) who was working as an extra, confirmed this chain of events in the 80’s.\n\nWould Laurel and Hardy in colour have worked? Well the simple answer is yes. Of course they would. Stan, Babe and crew would have still developed and shot the same scenes in the same way and in many ways the films would have been enhanced, but perhaps Peter’s thinking earlier gives an alternative viewpoint. “…the colours seemed to take your attention away somewhat from the main action and made me start looking at the surroundings in the scenes“. One of the things that is most appealing about Laurel and Hardy comedy, is there is always something going on. Stan and Babe’s performances were so precise, so nuanced, that I still pick out little bits of business for the first time even today; fifty-plus years since I first laughed at them on the telly! This is especially so with the new definitive restorations’, as so much more can be seen than before.\n\nLike Anth though, “…If the boys films were given this [current state of the art] treatment then I would be interested.” And yes, so would I and I rather suspect you might be too!\n\nMy thanks again to Randy for much of the information in this section.\n\nOn Colour Stills\n\nSo why, I hear you ask, am I penning a piece entitled ‘Laurel and Hardy in Colour‘ if not really in favour of ‘Colorized’ films? Well, simply because I happened across a colour still photograph of the boys that didn’t look ‘Colorized’, and it peaked my interest because I thought it quite beautiful.\n\nI could see that Babe’s skin tone was both varied and a different tone to Stan’s, and that there were various shades of yellow in the image. In a ‘Colorized’ image, there would only be one skin tone and perhaps a light and a dark yellow, but not various yellows to creams as seen in the photograph above.\n\nSurely, I though, there are more out there? Well there are. But only three of them. However, more on those originals later.\n\nIn looking and researching, I found a wealth of very nicely done retouched, colourised / ‘Colorized’, enhanced (whatever you want to call them) images of the boys and I wanted to find out more as, unlike my first viewing of the colourised Way Out West, I most certainly wasn’t underwhelmed with what I found. Clearly, a lot of love, care and thought has gone into many of these, and taking the ‘real colour picture’ thought forwards, the colourisers (is that even a thing?) in many cases, would actually have had to cope with the lighting that Roach photographer ‘Stax’ Graves optimised in the thousands of splendid (black and white) stills he took over the years, most of which were lit for film rather than still photography.\n\nAll of the images that follow have been downloaded from various places on the interweb, generally available to all it seems, so we must first congratulate those responsible for their splendid work, and then apologise if any of these images are subject to any form of restrictions. Nothing that follows appears to suffer any form of copyright, but if any are and we have used them inadvertently, I will be happy to either take the image down or credit the originator. We assume that the images were created for the enjoyment of all, and anyway the fact that that they can be gotten ‘out there’ and shared amongst L&H enthusiasts can only be a good thing?\n\nHere are a few of my favourites, though these and a lot more are in a slideshow at the bottom of this article.\n\nAs mentioned, these and many more all appear in the slideshow at the end of the article. But what of the genuine colour images?\n\nWell, as touched on, we know of four that were taken in May 1938; the one with the sunflower above and then there are these:\n\nThe pictures were captured by New York Daily News photographer, Harry Warnecke, during the shooting of Block-Heads, and we think they are quite wonderful.\n\nAt the end of this article is a slideshow of some of the images that we have found online that are really good examples of how an image can be coloured to best effect.\n\nA Happy Coincidence?\n\nFinally, and back to the the ‘Colorized’ films front, I’d like to share what I thought was an amusing story. You’ve already met my two older Granddaughters, Abigail and Sophia?\n\nIn the summer of 2019, they had been to an after-school group called Busybodies. Now, I’d always thought that was a brilliant name for the group anyway; always hopeful, of course, that the children had no exposure to a timber yard! Well, we collected them on that particular day and took them back home for tea at which point the eldest, Abigail, told me that they “had been watching Stan and Ollie” that very afternoon!\n\nImpressed as I was with the splendid judgement and taste the teacher had shown the children, well you would be wouldn’t you, I asked which part was their favourite. Without hesitation it was “Where Stan sticks the paintbrush on Ollie’s chin!”\n\nSo, it turns out that they had been watching Busy Bodies at Busybodies! A coincidence perhaps? Surely not! I naturally asked if they would like to see it again, and was delighted to receive a very positive YESSS! However, I did ask the question, and that is how I ended up watching colourised versions of the classics with the girlies!\n\nAs mentioned, click on the arrows to simply scroll from image to image. I hope you’ll like the collection as much as we do.\n\nWe do have another item which looks purely at professionally coloured stills. Please click here to be taken to the article."
