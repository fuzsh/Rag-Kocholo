        "text": "Last week (December 26-January 2) I watched the first six Star Wars movies because I wanted to see them again, in order, before going to see Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens. I’m glad that I did, and I considered reviewing all of the movies before reviewing the new film (don’t worry, this is not that) but scrapped that idea. Who wants to read a review for something that came out ten to thirty years ago? But while watching Episode II through Episode VI I found a common takeaway that all five movies were practically screaming. Anakin Skywalker was a chump, idiot, moron, and a tool; and I don’t know why I never picked up on it before.\n\nSo, I guess this is a character review. I’ve never written one before, at least not in an official capacity. As a writer, I don’t judge my characters, but work on them, explore them, try to figure them out and most of all, I listen to them. If I didn’t, they wouldn’t work like they should. They would be superficial, not fully formed, problematic, and yes – they would be tools, not people. I feel like Anakin Skywalker is exactly this – nothing more than a tool so people can blow things up. And that’s disappointing.\n\n(Spoilers to the first six Star Wars films follow, but I don’t touch the new film at all.)\n\nIn Star Wars: Episode I, Anakin is just a boy and yet I felt like this was the most authentic and human portrayal of the future fallen Jedi who would become known as Darth Vader. The differences between Episode I and Episode II are astounding, and even when I watched Episode II in theaters, I felt something was off. I was a teenager then, so I didn’t know what it was, and part of me thought the actor was to blame. But he wasn’t. Because it’s the things Anakin says and does in the movie that are problematic and that goes back to the actual story and direction of the film.\n\nAnakin started out as this confused, scared boy who was strong in the Force (conceived by it even) who was also curious, happy, brave and absolutely selfless. He continually does things in the first film, like offer strangers shelter or put his life at risk to help others, and he was just a boy. When Episode II takes place ten years later, there is no trace of that boy. The one we see is defiant, angry, scared, arrogant and always thinking about himself. I always felt like it was a complete 180 from the boy we had been introduced to earlier. It’s no wonder why Anakin turned to the dark side. He is so “gone” by the second movie, where is the tension? There is no internal conflict we can see because much of the goodness in Anakin is not seen and instead only his pettiness and less attractive qualities are. Maybe the writers needed to have him be this way because they knew what his future was going to be. Maybe they worried if they didn’t make him a blowhard so soon, it would be too abrupt when he finally did turn to the dark side. But I don’t think it would have been abrupt as much as it would have been more impactful.\n\nAt the end of Episode III, Anakin turns to the dark side in foolish hopes to save Padme, the woman he loves and the mother of Luke and Leia. But the dark side makes him do monstrous things including attacking Padme, nearly killing her. His body is mostly destroyed after a fight and when he comes back, bathed in the black Darth Vader costume, he is told that he killed Padme. But he is certain he didn’t. So why does this arrogant, powerful, narrow-minded person give up on the one thing/person he has been so obsessed with? It doesn’t make sense (from a character standpoint).\n\nAnd Darth Vader goes on in the original trilogy to be merciless and all of the things Anakin Skywalker, even the douchey version, wasn’t. But he doesn’t have any motivation. He isn’t loyal to his master, the Emperor (he tries to convince Luke to join him and overthrow the Emperor so they can rule together, and in Episode III he said the same thing to Padme) and he isn’t rewarded. He doesn’t want anything and the reason he turned to the Dark Side is gone (Padme). So really he’s just a puppet on some invisible strings, and yet he can’t even pull that off since he has no problem thinking about overthrowing the Emperor.\n\nI feel like unlike the other characters in the Star Wars universe, Anakin Skywalker was never a character so much as a device. Darth Vader was necessary, but Anakin was who he was before. The prequel could have made the connection – done a great job with Anakin and showing his slow seduction to the Dark Side instead of what it actually did, which was not that. I don’t know if the writers felt intimidated and overwhelmed by the task of going from a place of extreme light to extreme dark, or if they were just lazy. I mean, as a writer, these huge character spirals are thrilling when they’re organic. Because it’s our mistakes and pains and failures that shape us and force us to grow (and to hopefully be better).\n\nIt’s disappointing that this all-powerful Jedi could be so easily manipulated, but more than that – without reason or focus or intent, the character is just there, doing a whole lot of nothing. We didn’t get to see his descent into darkness, but simply arrived at the destination we were already familiar with (since the prequel trilogy came out fifteen years later). Am I the only one bothered by this?\n\nAnakin Skywalker’s story should have been one about transformation, but it can’t even be called a story on its own. He was a plot device. And he deserved better. He could have been the most interesting character/icon to appear in decades. He should have been a writer’s (and actor’s) absolute wet dream. And instead he’s just some chump on a bunch of tangled strings.\n\nNow that’s the real tragedy.\n\n-DMW"
