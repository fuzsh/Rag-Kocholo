        "text": "May, 2024\n\nWhen Tigers Got Their Spots\n\nAny number of modern scientific (Latin) names for plants and animals include the adjective tigrinus. Many of these organisms have spots, blotches, or similar markings that are definitely not stripes. In fact, modern compendia of \"botanical Latin\" (e.g, P. M. Eckel, A Grammatical Dictionary of Botanical Latin, 2010-2023) give meanings such as \"tiger-like, marked like a tiger, i.e. spotted like a jaguar (Felis onca), the American 'tiger' or, less often, barred like the Asiatic tiger (Felis tigris) (Stearn); barred as the grain in wood.\"\n\nOne might suppose that the application of tiger or tigrinus to such things as \"tiger lilies\" (the name Lilium tigrinum seems to have been used first in 1809) or the spotted Cattleya described in 1848 as Cattleya tigrina originated with people who had never seen an actual tiger.\n\nHowever, the idea that an adjective relating to tigers could be applied generally to things with spots, blotches, or similar markings can be traced back at least as early as the 18th Century, with the French adjective tigrÃ© and the taxonomic usage of tigrinus. But between Classical Latin and the 18th Century, there is a gap that we have not been able to span with citations of the adjective tigrinus from Latin documents.\n\nPossibly unique among the modern languages frequently used by taxonomists, French happens to have an adjective tigrÃ© that means, literally, something like \"made to resemble a tiger\", \"tigerized\", or simply \"resembling a tiger\". As a result, species descriptions in French have a special potential to inform us about how some taxonomists understood tigrinus. One might even posit that the French understanding of tigrÃ©, which from its earliest usage has referred to things that are spotted, blotched, or otherwise marked, colored their understanding of what the Latin tigrinus ought to mean. In fact, among the early orchid species descriptions involving \"tiger\" names, the only languages encountered other than Latin are French and English.\n\nHowever, in some parts of Latin America, the Jaguar (Panthera onca) is also known in Spanish as \"el tigre\", tigre, or tigre americano, in part because that is how 16th Century Spanish authors referred to it, apparently because of its markings (echoing Medieval developments to be discussed below), and not knowing its indigenous name. There does not seem to be a term in Spanish equivalent to French tigrÃ©, and the Spanish idioms involving tigre seem to refer to its fierce disposition rather than colors or patterns.\n\nClassical Latin usage: Did tigers have spots?\n\nSome citations illustrating the usage of tigrinus and the appearance of tigers:\n\nStatius (d. 96 CE), Thebaid, liber 2: Qualis ubi audito venantum murmure tigris Horruit in Maculas. (As when, hearing the rustling of its prey, the tiger shivers in its spots.) (While the translation âshivers in its spotsâ makes good rhetoric, then as now, all this passage really tells us about the definition of macula is that it could be applied to tigers. It does not tell us that the adjective tigrinus, \"of or pertaining to tigers\", means \"spotted\". Maculatus simply means marked in some way, as opposed to being \"unmarked\", immaculatus.)\n\nPliny the Elder (d. 79 CE), Naturalis Historia, liber 8, c. 23: Panthera et tigris macularum varietate prope solae bestiarum spectantur, ceteris unus ac suus cuique generi color est. (Bostock & Riley translation, 1855) The panther and the tiger are nearly the only animals that are remarkable for a skin distinguished by the variety of its spots; whereas others have them of a single colour, appropriate to each species. (Perhaps following the text more closely: The panther and tiger are almost the only animals distinguished by their various markings, while the others are of a single color, each according to its type.) Using \"species\" this way in an English translation carries anachronistic implications of the (relatively) new science of taxonomy, when applied to Roman texts!\n\nBostock & Riley in this context cite a passage in Naturalis Historia, liber 13, c. 30, regarding wooden furniture, \"tables of tiger and panther pattern\": Mensis praecipua dos in venam crispis vel in vertices parvos. illud oblongo evenit discursu ideoque tigrinum appellatur, hoc intorto et ideo tales pantherinae vocantur. sunt et undatim crispae, maiore gratia, si pavonum caudae oculos imitentur. (Bostock & Riley translation, 1855) The principal merit of these tables is to have veins arranged in waving lines, or else forming spirals like so many little whirlpools. In the former arrangement the lines run in an oblong direction, for which reason these are called \"tiger\" tables; while in the latter the marks are circling and spiral, and hence they are styled \"panther\" tables. There are some tables also with wavy, undulating marks, and which are more particularly esteemed if these resemble the eyes on a peacock's tail. (Or, again trying to remain closer to the original text: The most esteemed tables show the wood grain in wavy lines or in little swirls, the former running lengthwise, known as \"tigrinae\" (tiger grain), the other contorted and known as \"pantherinae\" (leopard grain), and there are also some with wavy, curly grain, even more prized if they resemble the \"eyes\" of the peacockâs tail.) (Note the distinction, and the implication of a constrast, between \"tiger\" and \"leopard\" grain here! Tigers had stripes, leopards had spots (or swirls)! But, as in the first citation from Pliny, these were regarded as \"markings\", opposed to a uniform coloration.)\n\nWhile there are many Roman mosaics depicting tigers (identifiable to us by their stripes), as well as some identified today as \"leopards\" or \"panthers\" (with leopard spots), we donât actually know which figures in the Roman art that has come down to us were known to the Romans themselves as tigris, panthera, or perhaps something else. Mosaics, frescos, etc. generally donât come with contemporary labels! Reasoning that the animals the Romans called tigris always had stripes, based on unlabeled images, may be a case of circular logic.\n\nNevertheless, the distinction implicit in the citation from Statius, marked versus unmarked fur, could give rise to the idea that tiger fur is \"marked\" (maculatus), and that, by extension, tigrinus could mean \"resembling\" a tiger by virtue of having (generic, unspecified) markings. Tigrinus seems to have come into French as tigrÃ©, and at least to later taxonomists, apparently carried with it the implication of indefinite markings, not just stripes. However, the evidence from Pliny, distinguishing and contrasting tigrinus and pantherinus (i.e., characterized by stripes versus the whorls we usually call spots when they appear on leopards, jaguars, and other wild cats) suggests that the concepts of stripes and spots were indeed separate in Roman times, and perhaps only later became conflated to give rise to the concept embodied in the French adjective tigrÃ©.\n\nThat tigers had stripes in ancient times is also implied by the Greek á¼±ÏÏÏÏÎ¹Î³ÏÎ¹Ï, \"tiger horse\", apparently referring to the zebra! But no one seems to have located a clear reference to a zebra in Classical Latin, or indeed in Ancient Greek, to prove the point.\n\nMedieval Fantasies\n\nIs there any evidence in Medieval Latin for tigrinus meaning \"spotted\"? We found a modern opinion on the internet that tigrinus, in the indefinite past, referred to \"everything that is striped, speckled, or spotted yellow and black or brown\", but is that simply a modern generalization of how tigrinus has been used by post-medieval naturalists? Where are the medieval citations?\n\nLiterature more or less about tigers in the Middle Ages seems to come almost exclusively from bestiaries, a sort of medieval equivalent of todayâs bizarre conspiracy theories. Somehow, the tiger became associated with an absurd story. In brief, people for some unspecified reason wanted to steal tiger cubs (Pliny also mentions this, but not the absurdities that come next in the medieval story). Today it is French bulldog puppies that are stolen. Someone discovered that the pursuing tigress, seeking to recover her cubs, could be distracted by a mirror (or in some versions, a glass ball), and, seeing her reflection, thought it was one of her cubs, and so she would stop as if to rescue the cub, before realizing her mistake. In some versions, the tigress falls for this trick repeatedly. As a result of this medieval fake news story, there are a large number of illustrations in the medieval bestiaries, easily identifiable as images supposed to be tigers by the inclusion of the mirror or glass ball (usually depicted as a circular object with a rim of some sort), if not by labels or their placement in the manuscript. These illustrations almost never give the animal stripes! Instead, almost all of them are either spotted or, less often, unmarked, and a few have wings. At least one example has hooves. Thus, in this sort of literature, medieval tigers had spots.\n\nThe bestiary web site, produced by David Badke of Victoria, British Columbia, has compiled citations for the animals of the bestiaries and their documentary sources as far back as Lucian and Pliny. By the time of Gaius Julius Solinus (3rd Century), tigers still had stripes, and, apparently, there was at that time a thriving industry of stealing tiger cubs. Claudian (4th Century) explains that tiger cubs, in his time still striped, were captured as pets for the amusement of the Persian king. Around the same era, St. Ambrose gives the version with the glass ball, and from that point forward, there seems to be little interest in the appearance of tigers, other than that they are sometimes said to have unspecified markings. An English version of a bestiary by Bartholomeus Anglicus (13th Century) was published in London in an English translation by Stephan Batman in 1582: here the tiger is \"spotted with divers specks\", and is yet again distracted by mirrors.\n\nIn spite of the bestiaries, there are historical mentions of tigers and other large animals presented as gifts to various European kings, suggesting that at least a few people were not distracted by the fabulous popular stories and had first-hand knowledge of the big cats. But, if the pervasive illustrations of tigers in the bestiaries are any indication, the ordinary understanding of what a tiger looked like was apparently extremely vague and did not include stripes! As for tigrinus, the adjective, we were not able to find any medieval citations at all, apart from copies of Pliny. The visual concept of the tiger had apparently become so indistinct that it was no longer a suitable point of comparison; the adjective no longer served a purpose.\n\nSo far, nothing that has come to our attention appears to contradict the conclusion that the use of the adjective tigrinus in the sense of \"spotted or mottled\" (i.e., applicable to things that are marked in some way other than striped) is a post-medieval development, certainly not part of Classical Latin usage, and apparently not attested in medieval times.\n\nPost-medieval developments\n\nThe Renaissance saw a flurry of activity in the publication of dictionaries, in which it is possible to trace some of the evolution of modern European languages.\n\nJean Nicot, Thresor de la langue francoyse, tant ancienne que moderne (1606) p. 629, in the entry for the noun tigre: \"Tables mouchetÃ©es et tavelÃ©es ou grivelÃ©es comme sont les tigres, Mensae tigrinae.\" (Why does the example concern tables? This seems to be another allusion to Pliny, and perhaps also a French preoccupation with stylish furniture.) No such usage is noted in Robert Estienneâs Dictionnaire franÃ§ois-latin (1539), but the identical citation about tables is found in his 1549 edition (on Google Books). In Estienneâs 1543 Dictionarium seu latinÃ¦ linguÃ¦ thesaurus, the same citation from Pliny appears under a separate entry for tigrinus, but the text is slightly different: \"Mensis prÃ¦cipua dos in vena crispis, vel in vertice variis. Illud oblongo euenit discursu, ideÃ³que tigrinÃ¦ appellantur.\" Here, tigrinus, as it was understood to have been used in the distant past by Pliny, seems on the verge of being transferred into French.\n\nGrand dictionnaire de lâAcadÃ©mie FranÃ§oise (1696), entry for tigre, tigresse, still does not cite an adjective as such, but uses the words mouchetÃ© or mouchetez and tavelez to describe the concept. In the same volume: Taveler: moucheter, tacheter, \"il ne se dit guere quâen parlant de certains animaux dont la peau est naturellement tachetÃ©\". Tacheter: marqueter de diverses taches. \"Il se dit proprement des taches qui sont sur la peau des hommes & de certains animaux\". Among the definitions of Tache, \"se dit aussi de certaines marques naturelles qui paroissent sur la peau\". However, this edition lacks a suitable definition of moucheter. In other sources of the same period (Pierre Richelet, Dictionnaire franÃ§ois, contenant generalement tous les mots, 1693), Moucheter: \"Câest marquer de plusieurs petites taches noires un fond blanc\" — the general sense is a random dark speckling, as if covered by flies (mouches).\n\nThe first example of tigrÃ©, the adjective, in a French dictionary seems to be Nouveau dictionnaire de lâAcadÃ©mie franÃ§oise, 1718: TigrÃ©: \"mouchetÃ© comme un tigre\".\n\nBy 1835, Pierre-Claude Boiste, Dictionnaire universel de la langue franÃ§aise, TigrÃ©, \"mouchetÃ© comme un tigre, comme un lÃ©opard, une once\" (in modern French, once is the snow leopard, but the same or a similar word has been applied to the lynx and other felines), and as a verb: Tigrer, \"moucheter, rayer comme le lÃ©opard, le tigre\". (In modern French, rayÃ© means striped, even though that sense of rayÃ© seems not to be included in the 1835 dictionary.) Also the flower tigridie (Latin tigridia), \"tigrine, plante iridÃ©e, Ã belles fleurs horaires, jaunes-brunes, tachetÃ©es de noir, tripÃ©tales\". MouchetÃ©: \"tachetÃ©, comme couvert de mouches\" (as if covered with flies). Tacheter: \"Marquer de plusieurs taches\".\n\nThus, by 1835, it is clear that French tigrÃ© has come to mean both spotted and striped, but the extension of mouchetÃ© (originally linked to flies and hence to spots, specks, or generally, to small dark marks) to include specifically both spots and stripes (in the entry for tigrÃ©) seems not to have been noted in earlier dictionaries.\n\nIn summary, Latin tigrinus is attested in Roman times with reference to the striped grain of wood, but apparently not in the sense of other markings such as spots, speckles, etc. However, the text from Pliny, if not quoted completely, could easily give rise to the idea that \"tiger\" wood grain could include markings other than just stripes. Much later, in the 16th Century and beyond, French tigre became associated not only with the animal, the tiger, but also with things that were marked in some vague, imprecise way âlike a tigerâ. By the 18th Century, the first example of the French adjective tigrÃ© makes it essentially equivalent to mouchetÃ© (covered with flies!), but in the manner of a tiger, as if tigers themselves were spotted or speckled, as they had commonly been depicted in the medieval bestiaries! The usage of adjectives derived from tiger by this time is not the same as their usage in Classical Latin.\n\nAnd it is in the 18th Century that Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) invented what became the modern system of naming plants and animals, taxonomy. Linnaeus wrote mainly in Latin, and sometimes in Swedish, and is said never to have learned much of other languages. However, he was held in high regard throughout Europe, and so his ideas and writings were spread widely in French, English, German, Italian, etc. Linnaeus himself described some species with epithets that refer to the tiger: Cypraea tigris (Linnaeus, 1758), the Tiger Cowry, a mollusc whose shell has spots, not stripes, although in this case Linnaeus does not provide a separate description of the pattern on the shell that alludes to tigers. Another is a clam, Venus (now Codakia) tigerina (Linnaeus, 1758), often misspelled as tigrina, the description referring to concentric \"stripes\" or ridges on the shell. Linnaeus also described the tiger as Felis (now Panthera) tigris (1758), noting corpore maculis omnibus virgatis â with the body marked all over with stripes (virgatus: striped).\n\nThere are a number of species with the specific epithet spelled tigerin- rather than tigrin-, and in at least one case (Rana tigerina, now Hoplobatrachus tigerinus, Daudin, 1802, the Indian Bullfrog), the original publication also gives a vernacular (French) translation of the name, in this case Grenouille TigrÃ©e, demonstrating that tigerina is simply a variant spelling. In this example, the description in the taxonomically-required Latin as well as the equivalent French tells us something about the use of the adjective: \"maculis atro-fuscis tigerinis artubus insuper\", and \"dâun brun rougeÃ¢tre tigrÃ© de taches noirÃ¢tres en dessus; ces taches tigrÃ©es sont entourÃ©es dâune teinte jaunÃ¢tre dessus les membres et les flancs...\" â here, tigerinus and tigrÃ© refer to irregular blotches or spots, not stripes.\n\nSo it was that the tiger, or the idea of the tiger, acquired spots or blotches in medieval times, and this popular misperception also passed into French about the same time modern taxonomy was invented, with the result that a number of plants and animals bearing spots but lacking stripes came be named after the tiger.\n\nExamples of \"Tigrinus\" Orchid Species\n\nThelymitra tigrina Robert Brown 1810: Latin only, \"perianthio patulo maculato\".\n\nOncidium tigrinum Juan JosÃ© Martinez Lexarza 1825: Latin only, \"Flores tres, quinque, magni, alterni, specioci, pellem tigrinam referentes... Perigonium regulare patens, sementis quinque lanceolato-ovatis lutescentibus, maculis tigrinis castaneo purpureis tota superficie variegatis... Labellum maximum luteum, immaculatum...\" This one actually has stripes or bars, not just spots.\n\nStanhopea tigrina James Bateman ex Lind. 1838 Latin and English, sepals ... \"marked with irregular longitudinal blotches... which approach or run into each other at the origin of the sepals.\" Petals ... \"marked at their base with transverse bands...\"\n\nCattleya tigrina Achille Richard 1848: French only (no Latin description, perhaps one reason why some considered this an invalid taxonomic name). Text calls the plant \"CATTLEYA TIGRINA (Cattleya Ã fleurs tigrÃ©es)\". Some modern articles call it the \"Tiger Striped Cattleya\", being unaware that tigrina and tigrÃ©e need not refer to stripes! The next oldest name for the same plant is Cattleya leopoldii, whose publication also appears somewhat irregular.\n\nThe taxonomic history of Cattleya tigrina in marvelously convoluted. Dr. Jack Fowlie discussed the problem in his 1977 monograph, The Brazilian Bifoliate Cattleyas and Their Color Varieties (Day Printing Corp., Pomona, CA), p. 95. Fowlie eventually located the first description of the plant as Cattleya tigrina, noting that there was no Latin description, normally considered essential for \"valid publication\", but his principal reason for not advocating this name in lieu of the currently popular C. leopoldii and the only slightly less popular C. guttata was that it had already taken decades for orchid growers to begin to understand that guttata and leopoldii were separate, distinct species, after a long period where a veritable parade of esteemed orchid botanists had lumped them into guttata, with the result that numerous hybrids had already been made with both forms under the latter name. Fowlie considered the difficulties that would ensue in orchid horticulture (as well as the obscurity of the journal where the species had been published — the Portefeuille des horticulteurs was then exceedlingly rare, but today easily found on the web site of the Biodiversity Heritage Library), and judged that such a change would be \"unwieldy and argumentative\".\n\nThe concern about how taxonomy impinged upon the practical requirements of horticulture was still a strong consideration for some authors over a decade later, when Carl Withner (The Cattleyas and Their Relatives. Volume I: The Cattleyas, 1988, Timber Press, Portland, OR, especially pp. 67-69), after enumerating the differences between guttata and leopoldii, thought that the original color plate of tigrina most closely resembled the original description of guttata, mentioning that Braem thought tigrina (again, from the original color plate) was closer to leopoldii. Withner goes on to explain why the name makes sense, pointing out that \"the South American tigre, or jaguar, is a completely black-spotted, not striped, fierce feline\"! — in other words, he missed the story of how the tiger got its spots, and how the jaguar came to be seen by early Spanish chroniclers in South America as tiger-like instead of leopard-like. In any case, it was only much later that orchid taxonomists were no longer sensitive to the way their pronouncements would affect the wider community of orchid horticulture: the intended audience for the work of taxonomists has changed since the 1980's.\n\nThe two species concepts, guttata and leopoldii, might have remained distinct were it not for a series of ambiguous statements. After the description by Achille (or sometimes Achilles) Richard (lacking, as we have seen, the normal Latin diagnosis), the next mention of what eventually became established as leopoldii was by John Lindley in Paxton's Flower Garden 2:129 (1852) as a horticultural form, Cattleya Leopoldii Hort., but without an \"official\" description, the name having been bestowed by Alexandre Verschaffelt, the grower who first flowered it in Europe about 1850. The required botanical description followed, authored by Charles Lemaire, first in a brief note without the Latin diagnosis in 1854 (L'Illustration horticole, Tome I, MiscellanÃ©es, p. 68), and then with the formal description in 1855 (L'Illustration horticole, Tome II, t. 69), in both cases referring to it as Cattleya Leopoldii Hort. Versch. However, Fowlie reports, Lemaire, in the \"fine print\", also refers to it as \"C. guttata var. Leopoldii\" — but in context, what that passage, in the French text, actually says (our translation of the French) is that \"It is very close to C. granulosa and C. guttata, but it seems to us sufficiently different to regard it as distinct. Nevertheless, one might strictly speaking (\"Ã la rigueur\") consider it a form of the latter, but a form infinitely more developed and quite superior in beauty.\" Here Lemaire uses the conditional tense, expressing a hypothetical taxonomic alternative that the most fastidious taxonomist might adopt, but clearly expressing his opinion and decision that specific rank is the best solution. In French, \"Ã la rigueur\" refers to a view that is fastidious in the extreme, an outside possibility.\n\nMeanwhile, Linden's nursery in Brussels had acquired a large shipment of plants from Brazil, including, as mentioned in 1860 (Jean Jules Linden, with the collaboration of Jules-Emile Planchon, Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach, and G. Lüddemann, Pescatorea: iconographie des orchidÃ©es, plate 43, text on p. [55]), a plant illustrated as \"Cattleya guttata var. Leopoldii Linden & Rchb.f.\". Reichenbach had apparently misconstrued Lindley's original description of guttata as applying also to his leopoldii plant that had been described by Lemaire, and the conflation that seems to stem from Lemaire's \"fine print\" was now firmly established. As Fowlie observed, Lindley had seen both plants alive, but he died before he had an opportunity to reiterate his view that they were properly distinct.\n\nOrchid experts such as Robert Allen Rolfe and Alfred Cogniaux again made the case that the two forms were distinct in the 1890's, but the pendulum later swung back in favor of combining them. We would have to wait until about the 1970's before the growers again became aware of the differences, even though much later, in 1988, Withner observed that the Royal Horticultural Society was still treating them as a single species, guttata, for purposes of hybrid registrations. That change was eventually made (2002, long after most growers had understood that two different species were involved), but a few years later, the RHS, following a decision by the World Monocots Checklist (now superseded by the World Checklist of Vascular Plants), recognized C. tigrina as the correct name, having priority over C. leopoldii, with the publication of the orchid hybrid registrations for April-June, 2006 (Published in Orchid Review 114, Number 1271, September-October, 2006), and referring to Braem, Guido J. (1984) Die bifoliaten Cattleyen Brasiliens (BrÃ¼cke-Verlag Kurt Schmersow, Hildesheim, Germany) 1:74-79 for discussion and synonymy — in other words, acceptance of Braem's views on the names of this species did not come about until over 20 years after he had suggested the change. By that time, 2006, the confusion caused by the long-standing decision to combine guttata and leopoldii for purposes of registration had been largely untangled, or at least understood, and the change to tigrina was no longer considered prohibitively \"unwieldy and argumentative\".\n\nThe publications cited above (Fowlie, 1977; Braem, 1984; and Withner, 1988) present rather different views of the relationships involved, and Achille Richard's type specimen has been located in Paris, another ingredient for a better understanding of the taxonomy, see notes below†.\n\nHoulletia tigrina Linden ex Lindl. 1853: Latin and English, pattern only mentioned in the English description, tepals \"richly mottled and variegated with deep rose\", and on the lip, \"cross bands of blood-red\", but no direct explanation of why the specific epithet was chosen.\n\nCymbidium tigrinum Charles Samuel Pollock Parish ex Hooker 1864: Latin and English: Spot-lipped Cymbidium, \"labello longe unguiculato trilobo albo purpureo-maculato\", and the English description notes that the mid-lobe of the lip is \"barred transversely with short streaks of dark purple\", which in the accompanying plate are widely spaced oval spots, not forming distinct bars.\n\nTrichocentrum tigrinum Jean Jules Linden & H. G. Reichenbach filius, 1869: Other than the fact that the flowers are \"coloured like those of Cattleya Aclandiae\", there is nothing in the description alluding to tigers.\n\nMormodes tigrina JoÃ£o Barbosa Rodrigues 1877: Latin and French, the only reference perhaps alluding to tigers is in the French, \"perianthe jaune-sale, trÃ¨s-finement mouchetÃ© de brun-pourpre\".\n\nCatasetum tigrinum H. G. Reichenbach filius 1881: Latin and English, the only reference alluding to tigers is in the English, \"white sepals and petals, the last unusually broad, all with numerous cinnamon-colored bars\", which in photographs are a mixture of spots and short transverse bars scattered over a pale background.\n\nCytropodium tigrinum Linden 1881: No description as originally published, apart from the fact that it had been collected along the Rio Branco; this was merely a name on a list of plants recently introduced into commerce by the Linden nursery. While the name is usually considered a junior synonym of Cyrtopodium punctuatum, a recent publication speculates that it could be an as-yet-undescribed species.\n\nDendrobium tigrinum Rolfe ex Hemsl. 1891: Latin and English, the only allusion to tigers is \"sepals and petals very undulate in their basal half, where they are also spotted and somewhat veined with dark purple\". Now considered a synonym of Dendrobium spectabile, which is very definitely adorned by various stripes, bars, and spots.\n\nEpidendrum tigrinum MartÃ­n SessÃ© & JosÃ© Mariano MoziÃ±o 1894: Latin only, sometimes considered an illegitimate name, \"Petala oblonga, crasiuscula, reflexa, intus purpureo punctata...\", no other explanation for the specific epithet. Now referred to Epidendrum cristatum (Ruiz & Pavón, 1798).\n\nMaxillaria tigrina Charles Schweinfurth 1968, the flower is actually striped: Latin and English, \"flos pro planta magnus, conspicue striatus\".\n\nPost-script: A Thought Experiment\n\nThe invention of the moveable-type printing press around 1440 unleashed astounding changes in the way information was spread and used. What might have happened if that invention had included Artificial Intelligence?\n\nThe first step in deploying Artificial Intelligence in the year 1440 would be to train it, by feeding it all of the assembled knowledge found in the best libraries. It would learn the classics, both Greek and Roman, and the vast corpus of manuscripts dutifully copied by over a thousand years of scribling monks as well as secular clerks. In particular, it would absorb all of the bestiaries.\n\nThen, when someone Googled \"tigris\", the Artificial Intelligence engine of the printing press would produce an essay about the tiger, printed on fine paper with the latest moveable type, describing an animal with indistinct spots and sometimes wings, easily distracted by mirrors.\n\nIt has been many decades since we were first introduced to computers. The earliest definition we heard was, \"The computer is nothing but a high-speed idiot\". This was followed, maybe a decade later, by the maxim, \"Garbage in, garbage out\". For computers to generate anything of value, the input must have value as well. Before Artificial Intelligence can have something meaningful or even helpful to say on the subject of tigers, for example, first-hand information and analysis about tigers is required, originally produced and compiled by humans. The thousand-year attempt to assemble knowledge about tigers based on copying and recopying faulty descriptions was a failure, for lack of evidence-based inquiry. Then as now, even with Artificial Intelligence, the maxim holds: Garbage in, garbage out.\n\nFootnote\n\n†A discussion of Braem's publication and its relationship to those of Fowlie and Withner may be helpful here:\n\nCattleya: Die bifoliaten Cattleyen Brasiliens, Guido J. Braem, BrÃ¼cke-Verlag Kurt Schmersow, Hildesheim, Germany. No copyright date, ISBN 3-87105-016-4. Estimated publication dates as early as 1981 and as late as 1986 have been found on the internet. Kew uses 1984. At least one entry in WorldCat specifies \"[1977?]-1986\", perhaps indicating that the earliest possible publication date is 1977, since it cites Fowlie's monograph published in that year. Withner uses 1984 as well. The 1986 date might be the date of publication of the earliest known bibliographic citation of this volume. The earliest notice in any form located so far is the announcement that it was a \"New Publication\", in an advertisement by the publisher in the AOS Bulletin 53(9):975 (September, 1984). German-English parallel text, but the English frequently differs from the German, and sometimes contains additional information. No credit is given for the English translation, although conceivably it was prepared by the author himself, and in places might actually have preceded the German version. The text contains some German peculiarities, such as the abbreviation usw. (=und so weiter, literally \"and so forth\"), rendered in the English text as a. s. o. (=\"and so on\") instead of the conventional etc., suggesting that the English text was not written by a native English speaker. There is no bibliography. There are many in-line bibliographic citations, but many statements lack references, especially those regarding the limited information about habitats.\n\nThere is no indication that the author has studied these species in the wild, or that he has knowledge of their habitats apart from whatever he gleaned from Fowlieâs monograph and earlier sources. Habitat information is generally limited to a few lines, and there seems to be no cultural information at all.\n\nThe author generally ascribes differences in flowering season to differences in climate and \"geography\", while Fowlie treats the flowering seasons as inherent adaptations, genetically determined. These interpretations sometimes lead to different conclusions.\n\nThe author seems to have little experience with hybrids, the process by which they are registered and named, or with the history of the use of species names by orchid growers generally. The work was apparently intended to convey the taxonomy and description of the bifoliate Cattleya species to an \"amateur\" audience, but without any overt consideration of what that audience might want to know about them. There is no indication that the author intended a formal taxonomy.\n\nThe author notes four points made by Fowlie in the latter's choice to continue using the name leopoldii:\n\nNo type specimen for Richardâs Cattleya tigrina is known;\n\nThere was no Latin diagnosis;\n\nThe publication was difficult to locate (Braem says Fowlie called the volume \"obscure\", but he did not; notably, Fowlie does not tell us how he discovered the existence of this species description);\n\nThe names leopoldii and guttata (including \"guttata var. leopoldii\") had been in use for so long, discussed by many famous botanists, and had been used in so many hybrids that it would be \"unwieldy\" (although that term, from Fowlie, is not used in the German text, but only in the English text). (In fact, leopoldii was not permitted as part of orchid hybrid registration until much later, 2002!)\n\nFurther, the English text specifies that Richard's description had not been referenced for 130 years, while the German text says only \"lange Jahre\".\n\nIt is, of course, the fourth problem that led Fowlie to avoid formal recognition of the priority of tigrina. Fowlie was sensitive to the effect such a change would have on the orchid growers of his time, who were still struggling to distinguish guttata and leopoldii, which Braem does very little to clarify, apart from noting the larger flowers of leopoldii and the differences in the way the side lobes of the labellum cover (partially or entirely) the column. Braem suggests the differences in flowering season are due to climate and geography. (Braem does not include an illustration of the unrolled labellum, but does mention the deep sinuses separating the lateral lobes from the midlobe in leopoldii. Fowlie illustrates and describes the unrolled labella of both species, which, at least in his illustrations, are very distinct from one other. Withner does not describe the differences in the shape of the lateral lobes of the labellum, but he does illustrate the labellum of guttata, p. 23. It is impossible to establish from these accounts how reliable or variable this characteristic may be. And, as pointed out by both Fowlie and Withner, there had already been so much confusion in horticulture between the two species, comparisons involving plants in cultivation labeled as either guttata or leopoldii would be problematic.)\n\nCarl Withner mentions Cattleya tigrina in the first volume of his monograph (The Cattleyas and Their Relatives: Volume I. The Cattleyas, 1988, Timber Press, Portland, Oregon), especially pp. 67-69. The original description from 1848 included no measurements at all, but Withner refers to \"plants\" of C. tigrina that have \"no more than 2-3 flowers per growth; and the flowers are also small, about 1Â½-2 in. (4-5 cm.) across\". Where did these \"plants\" come from, and how were they identified as C. tigrina, which seems not to have been mentioned in modern times prior to Fowlieâs monograph? Was Withner misled by \"plants\" that were labeled as tigrina, believing them to be the form illustrated in 1848? The mystery is deepened by a photograph on p. 69, labeled \"Cattleya tigrina (C. guttata?)\", but the volume does not list credits for any of the photographs. Withner indicates that the plants then referred to (by unknown growers) as tigrina were even smaller than those of C. guttata. Withner was here considering the question of whether the \"plants\" then (1988) labeled as C. tigrina represented a taxon distinct from C. guttata and C. leopoldii, and preferred to reserve judgement, but their existence seems to have influenced his understanding of the differences and similarities between guttata and leopoldii. Perhaps this circumstance illustrates better than any other argument the difficulty that Fowlie perceived: Without additional information, it was impossible to assign the name tigrina definitively to living plants, as the published description was simply too vague. Guttata and leopoldii were known from specific locations, and their descriptions, preserved material, and living specimens provided a good range of measurements and a continuity of identifications. The only clear characteristic of the illustration from 1848 was that the column was clearly visible in side view, as explicitly noted in the accompanying text, favoring leopoldii rather than guttata in the absence of any other distinctions, such as measurements. In Withnerâs photograph of \"tigrina\", the column is not exposed. It remains to be established whether the origin of the \"tigrina\" plants discussed by Withner can be established. Withner notes that the original plate from 1848 was reproduced on the cover of the September, 1984 issue of Die Orchidee. There are also are several items in Withnerâs \"Selected References\" that need to be checked, but so far, no additional citations, photographs, or figures of \"tigrina\" from 1848 until Fowlie's time have been located.\n\nIn this connection, we note that there is at least one mention on the internet of an herbarium sheet from Paris, bearing a specimen purported to be the same Cattleya tigrina, but the date is cited as 1838, long before the specimen described by Achille Richard bloomed in 1847 (see the article by Greg Allikas, June, 2010 on the American Orchid Society web site). There are in fact three herbarium sheets at the MusÃ©um national d'Histoire naturelle, 57 rue Cuvier, Paris: MNHN-P-P00407301, MNHN-P-P00407302, and MNHN-P-P00407303, all digitized, from the herbarium collection of Louis Claude and Achille Richard (in spite of the inconsistent punctuation, it appears that the \"Louis Claude\" on this label was in fact Louis Claude Marie Richard, 1754-1821, the father of Achille Richard, 1794-1852).\n\nThe first sheet, designated TYPE, is labeled Cattleya tigrina macranthera A. R., BrÃ©sil. The ink showing through from the back of this label is also visible, in mirror image, \"Cayenne. Le Prieur. 1847\" — Monsieur Le Prieur is described elsewhere as FranÃ§ois RenÃ© Mathias Leprieur or Le Prieur, 1799-1870, a \"pharmacien de la marine\", a pharmacist in the French navy, and he was a well-known collector at the time in French Guyana. However, there is no evidence he ever collected in Brazil, and it is possible the back of the label for the Cattleya tigrina type specimen is irrelevant to the provenance of the specimen; the label, a convenient scrap of paper originally pertaining to some other specimen, may simply have been turned over and re-used to indicate the name bestowed on the specimen after it was first designated (on the other, earlier label on the same herbarium sheet) \"Cattleya spec de Bresil. Les pseudobulb ressemblent Ã Cattleya guttata. 45 cm de long. pseudobulb clavatis subteretibus.\" The herbarium sheet bears no other date, and the 1847 date on the reverse of the label may be completely irrelevant. The specimen itself consists of a single flower and a single leaf. The flower is in poor condition, and a small piece of printed paper has been inserted between the proximal portion of the labellum and what appears to be the folded side-lobe of the labellum and the petal, the column itself completely hidden. The lateral lobe of the labellum is apparently partly overlaid with a petal, and from the way the flower is folded, it is impossible to make out the shape of the labellum, apart from the distal part of the midlobe. The length of the dried petal appears to be about 4.2 cm, so the natural spread of the flower (after drying) must have been about 8-9 cm. Fowlie reports that the petals of leopoldii (in life) are around 4-5 cm in length, those of guttata, 3.6-4.4 cm; in other words, this specimen itself is not particularly helpful in its present state.\n\nThe second sheet, designated ISOTYPE, consists of three flowers, a pseudobulb, and a leaf. One flower is arranged to show the lip from below, another from above, and the distal end of the midlobe is visibly cleft, the lateral lobes acute, ending directly above the end of the column, and separated from the midlobe by deep sinuses. These features are consistent with Fowlie's figure of the labellum of leopoldii. The petals appear to be about 4 cm in length.\n\nThe second sheet also provides more information about the provenance of the plant: labeled Cattleya tigrina, it was collected in 1838 in Brazil by M. Peixoto (not yet identified), and bloomed in July, 1847 in the botanic garden of the \"FacultÃ© de MÃ©decine\", where it was harvested by A. RiviÃ¨re. There is a small rectangular glue stain next to this label, suggesting that something else may have been attached to the sheet at some point. (Possibly the unexplained glue residue is where a small label with the word \"TYPE\" was attached. The dimensions are similar to those of a \"TYPE\" label on some other herbarium sheets.)\n\nThe third sheet bears a modern label C. tigrina A. Rich. 2004, indicating it had been assigned by the museum to that species in 2004. The original label is \"Cattleya tigrina macranthera A. R. BrÃ©sil Mr. Peixoto. (Le nouveau) août 1844\". The specimen consists of two flowers and the spike from which they have become detached. One flower has been manipulated so that the column is exposed, and the lateral lobe of the labellum folded under it. The other flower has the column exposed, with the entire lip unrolled beneath it, showing that the distal portion of the lateral lobes is broadly rounded, not acute. No scale was photographed with this sheet, so the dimensions are uncertain. What is the significance of the name \"macranthera\", which appears also (as a variety or subspecies name?) on the type specimen but not in the published description? It seems never to have been published, \"validly\" or otherwise, and is not noted, as far as we have been able to determine, as a synonym, nomen nudem, or any other sort of taxonomic name, by any other source. And what of \"Le nouveau\"? The first specimen from Mr. or M. Peixoto was received in 1838. Perhaps he sent another specimen in 1844, that Richard thought was the same species? However, the details of the labellum do not seem to match the first two sheets, and, in hindsight, with the knowledge of the existence of two similar species, guttata and leopoldii, differing in the shape and arrangement of the midlobes of the labellum, there is no guarantee that the plant on this third sheet is what is now called tigrina, and not guttata.\n\nSeptember, 2022\n\nA Big Project: Tracking Down Old Orchid Awards!\n\nWhen we started digging into the history of South Coast Orchid Society, we learned about our members from the past. Many of them turned out to be important players in the development of modern orchid hybrids. We wanted to know more about their plants.\n\nGradually, starting about August, 2021, we have been able to track down the awards from Long Beach judging. At first it was a slow and confusing process. There were multiple sources to be checked, for the most part not indexed, and sometimes with glaring discrepancies and errors. We gradually worked out a process for recovering the data as efficiently as possible, and began to understand the limitations of each source.\n\nWhere to find our Long Beach and Southern California awards project: click HERE! Links are provided to Long Beach ODC awards 1954-1967 and their few surviving photos, Long Beach AOS awards 1968-1980, and all other Southern California AOS awards 1950-1968. The web pages will be updated with additional photographs and information as they are discovered.\n\nThe story of Long Beach judging begins in late 1954, when SCOS members voted to go ahead with a request to start official Orchid Digest Corporation judging in conjunction with our monthly meetings.\n\nAt first, SCOS recruited judges from the Orchid Society of Southern California who had been accredited by Orchid Digest Corporation â most of whom were already members of SCOS as well. The first official Long Beach judging session was held at our December, 1954 meeting, and duly reported in the form of a summary of the meeting published in Orchid Digest, prepared by our Secretary at that time, Elva \"Tommy\" Hanes.\n\nOur meetings had been scheduled, from the very beginning, to be held on the fourth Monday of the month, exactly two weeks after the monthly OSSC meetings, so that no matter when your fabulous orchid came into bloom, you could show it off at some Southern California orchid club. Consequently, many people joined both societies and regularly attended both sets of meetings. In those days, the freeways were not crowded; it was considered normal to drive down to Long Beach from Canoga Park every month for the SCOS meeting (as Grayce and Adolph Hecker did), or in the reverse direction, from Long Beach to the OSSC meeting site in Fiesta Hall at Plummer Park in Hollywood (now part of West Hollywood). One consequence of this arrangement is that the history of Southern California orchid activities is not a history of separate societies, but rather a history of a network of individuals and societies who collaborated freely to improve their knowledge, skills, and resources.\n\nSoon, we starting growing our own judges, through the same process that is still used today in AOS judging. Generations of judges, first under Orchid Digest Corporation standards, and then in 1968, after the two judging systems were merged, under American Orchid Society standards (which had become nearly identical by then anyway), studied and âmentoredâ under SCOS judges such as John Hanes, Glenn Hamilton, Woody Wilson, A. G. Tharp, and many others.\n\nThe development of judges and judging was easily found in our old newsletters and in Orchid Digest and the AOS Bulletin, although there are still some aspects that are murkey. But we had more trouble finding the actual awards.\n\nFor ODC awards, a large bundle of SCOS newsletters, donated to ODC by Rita Crothers and now in the âOrchid Archiveâ at The Huntington Botanical Center, plus additional award lists published in Orchid Digest, gave us a nearly complete list (about 85%) of the ODC awards for Long Beach covering 1954-1967. That was a good start!\n\nLong Beach AOS awards, 1968 to the present, have proved more difficult. The awards were published mainly in a separate journal, Awards Quarterly, but when those awards were transcribed and entered into the first AOS awards database, and then propagated through several generations of databases down to the current one, OrchidPro, all sorts of errors crept in. Those errors proved so pervasive, we estimate that they have affected about 18% of all Long Beach AOS awards 1968-1980, making many of the awards unfindable or misleading.\n\nWhen AOS started developing an awards database, the intention was probably to create a complete inventory, very similar to the information found in the Register of Awards, covering all awards up through 1968, and in Awards Quarterly, covering all awards 1969 through about 2006, but in a searchable format. However, the task seems to have become too daunting, so that a very large group of awards, from about 1950 through the mid 1960âs, now appear in OrchidPro with only very limited information: the name of the plant, the award, the award number, which includes the year of the award, and occasionally, the official award photo. Missing from this group of awards are the name of the exhibitor, the place where the award was conferred, the date of the award, and all descriptive information and measurements. In effect, these are place-holder entries, likely considered a temporary expedient until someone had time to enter complete information. The missing information, of course, can generally be found in the Register of Awards and Awards Quarterly, although there was a period when HCC/AOS awards were not required to include descriptions or measurements.\n\nOne feature of the older awards would have created difficulties for data entry: For the early years, measurements were recorded in inches, to the nearest 1⁄16th inch. Current practice expresses measurements in centimeters, to the nearest millimeter. The best way to approach this problem would be to use a spreadsheet or customized data entry screen that converts the measurements automatically from inches to centimeters. When the first database was created, such a tool was likely unavailable, another reason to bypass these records.\n\nIt is important to note the sequence in which the various sources were generated or published: For Long Beach, the award was made at our monthly meeting, slides were prepared, labeled, and sent to AOS headquarters or otherwise distributed. The information was generally published in our newsletter for the following month. After the information reached AOS headquarters, there might be a delay until an award fee was paid by the exhibitor, and an additional delay if the award was for a hybrid that had not yet been registered with the Royal Horticultural Society. After the completion of those formalities, the awards were reported in the AOS Bulletin (this practice was discontinued in 1975). The next step was publication in the Register of Awards (for awards up to the end of 1968) or Awards Quarterly (for awards from 1968 through about 2006, when Awards Quarterly was discontinued — by then, all awards were entered directly into a database). The last step was entering the information into whatever database was in use at the time. Errors might and actually did occur at each step along the way. The information the Register of Awards was very closely edited, although we discovered a few errors there that seem not to have been noticed before. Editing of Awards Quarterly, at least in its early years, was far less careful, resulting in the creation of many duplicate award numbers, date errors, and all sorts of other problems that were compounded when the information was transfered to a database. We found it essential to review all of the published sources to be sure we had found the correct information.\n\nSome of the original award notices in the AOS Bulletin were accompanied by small black and white photos, generally cropped to show a single flower. At various times, those photos became extremely scarce for Southern California awards. These photos were often copied when the same awards were reported in the Register of Awards or in Awards Quarterly. However, these black and white photos were extremely rare or did not appear at all in some years for Southern California judging sites, while photos from judging in the rest the of country appeared frequently. Eventually, complaints mounted, to the point where they were mentioned in the AOS Bulletin, with the admonition that the required 12 duplicates of the color slide plus one black and white photo had to be received by a deadline at the offices of AOS at Harvard University, Cambridge, MA. What was the problem? Did someone on the west coast have the wrong mailing address, so that the photos ended up in the wrong mail slot at Harvard? Or was the mail, and communication generally, just too slow in those days? In any case, those rare black and white photos, when they can be found, have proven to be extremely useful in confirming that color images found elsewhere are in fact the official award photos. In a very few cases, even the black and white photo accompanying the first publication of an award had turned out to be incorrectly identified, by comparison with the award description published at the same time.\n\nThus, when we began looking for AOS awards involving some of our notable SCOS members from the past, there were big gaps. OrchidPro could not tell us about the early awards to say, John Hanes, or Imogene and Carl Keyes, because the names of the exhibitors, as well as the date and location, were almost always omitted.\n\nAfter developing a âcompleteâ list of Long Beach AOS awards and retrieving as many award photos as possible from a variety of sources (a major source proved to be the old collection of award slides maintained by the Pacific South regional judging program, now at The Huntington Botanical Center), we turned our attention to the rest of Southern California. Was it possible to find out what SCOS members had been doing before AOS judging started at Long Beach?\n\nAfter thinking about the problem, we realized that it should be possible to enter key data from the Register of Awards (the original volume plus the six âSupplementsâ) into a spreadsheet, and then use spreadsheet âformulasâ to generate the text and HTML code required to format the information for a web page. Oddly, the idea worked the first time, and we now have a comprehensive list of Southern California AOS awards 1950-1968, with all of the exhibitors and locations and with as many photos as we could find in published sources. One big part of this project remains, to search for the remaining Southern California award photos in the Pacific South awards slide collection. How far back do the award slides go? We donât know yet!\n\nHowever, a number of award slides ended up in the hands of AOS judges, and many have since been donated to OrchidWiz. Only a minority of the images in OrchidWiz are official award photos, but a significant number of them can be identified as such, from other information. In many cases, we can match the OrchidWiz photo with a black and white image published in the AOS Bulletin, or with an image from OrchidPro. The OrchidWiz images are generally much better scans of the original slides than the scans in OrchidPro, as many of the latter seem to have been created using very early scanning technology. Many of the OrchidWiz award images turn out to be mirror images of the photos in OrchidPro or the award slides — not everyone knew which sides of the slide were properly the \"front\" and \"back\", and how to orient the slide in the scanner!\n\nFrom the photos in OrchidWiz that can be identified as real award photos, and from occasional mentions in the old SCOS newsletters and elsewhere, we know that color slides were being made during judging sessions as early as the 1950âs, and that, by the 1960âs, there was already a requirement to supply 12 copies of the award slides, plus a black and white photographic print, to AOS headquarters. The 12 duplicate slides were to be distributed to judging centers and also loaned out to local societies for their own use. Additional duplicates might have been made at the same time for use by local judges or influential nurserymen. Consequently, award slides probably ended up all over the US. Whether there is a complete archive of the âoriginalâ slides at AOS headquarters, we donât yet know.\n\nAt least for the Pacific South region, the quality of the slides is generally very good — we were able to obtain stunning digital images using an inexpensive portable scanner — but a large number suffer from technical issues: some are badly overexposed, especially for white flowers, and require additional work to recover a good image. Others, especially red flowers, are badly oversaturated. A great number have an overall blue tone that needs to be removed to recover something closer to realistic color. A few slides are spoiled by small blue or purple spots, presumably due to splatter of some sort of chemical during the process of making the duplicate slides.\n\nAlso, whole groups of slides are missing: all of the early Lycaste awards, all awards for the remarkable Cymbidium hybrid Lillian Stewart, all awards for some of the famous Cattleya hybrids such as Bonanza and Bob Betts, etc. Were those slides âborrowedâ at some point by someone who was preparing articles for publication in the AOS Bulletin or Orchid Digest, and never returned? Do the missing slides still exist in other archives, and can we find them before those collections are discarded as âobsoleteâ? At least until all of the images can be properly scanned and added to OrchidPro, they are an important resource and need to be preserved by all of the judging centers and other institutions that may have them!\n\nThe skills of the photographers varied tremendously as well. By about 1950, there was plenty of advice for aspiring orchid photographers. A notable example is the extremely successful commercial photographer Valentino Sarra, who, once he had encountered orchids, became an expert grower and a collaborator in some commercial orchid ventures. He wrote about the difficulties of lighting, backgrounds, and all the technical details and tricks that could be used to produce satisfying images of the most difficult flowers. Some of the award photographers in our area took these lessons to heart, others did not. The problem is especially noticeable for Phalaenopsis flowers, which were almost always photographed as a spray, rather than an individual flower. Some photographers used careful lighting from one side, which emphasizes the texture and contours of the flowers; others apparently used lighting from the front, which almost always produces a washed-out image. Controlling the depth of focus, through a combination of light intensity and the f stop, was another obvious difficulty, which some photographers used to advantage, while others did not.\n\nIn spite of these problems, the new scans from the Pacific South award slides have yielded many images that are far superior to those now in OrchidPro, as well as many excellent images that are not found in OrchidPro at all.\n\nNow, at last, we can begin to recreate that long parade of stunning plants that was displayed at our meetings, as well as the plants that built the well-deserved reputations of some of our most energetic and innovative members from the past. There is much to learn from these pictures and the lists of awards. We hope the information we have recovered will point the way to improvements in future generations of the AOS awards database. We think the record of awarded plants and the remarkable people who produced them is worth preserving.\n\nJuly, 2022\n\nAscocenda Nostalgia\n\nDuring our project to recover the orchid awards associated with SCOS, first under Orchid Digest Corporation standards from December, 1954 through December, 1967, and then from January, 1968 right down to the present under American Orchid Society standards, we were surprised to find a large number of awards for Ascocendas. The Ascocendas awarded in Long Beach were stunning! Rarely seen these days, at least in our area, Ascocendas used to play a starring role. Hybrids of Ascocentrum and Vanda, they produced beautiful round flowers in jewel tones, from small Vanda-like plants. They were much easier to manage in a small greenhouse than \"standard\" Vandas. Today, when fewer people are able to afford and manage a greenhouse environment, even a small one, their place has largely been taken by \"compact\" Cattleyas, \"novelty\" Phalaenopsis and Paphiopedilums, and Neofinetia hybrids, all of which are suitable for either outdoor or indoor cultivation, without a specialized and carefully regulated growing area.\n\nToday, also, there is a prevailing school of thought that says Ascocendas no longer exist, because Ascocentrum and several other genera have been completely submerged into Vanda. We will have something to say about that development below.\n\nThe first Ascocenda was produced in 1949 by Dr. Christos Plutarchou Sideris, then a plant physiologist working in Honolulu. Sideros was born in 1891 on the island of Samos, Greece, and came to the United States in 1909. He attended college in California, receiving his Ph.D. in plant physiology in 1924 from the University of California at Berkeley. His first job after that was with the Pineapple Producers' Cooperative in Honolulu, which later became the Pineapple Research Institute. He may also have held a position at the University of Hawaii. Orchid growers in Hawaii have explained that agricultural scientists in Hawaii in those days traveled frequently to Southeast Asia in connection with their research on improving productivity of pineapple and other tropical crops in Hawaii, and during these travels encountered interesting orchids, some of which they brought back with them to Hawaii.\n\nDr. Sideris became interested in growing orchids. Travel presumably stopped during World War II, but in 1949, he registered the intergeneric hybrid Ascocenda Portia Doolittle (Ascocentrum curvifolium × Vanda lamellata), named after the wife of one of his friends in Honolulu, Dr. Stewart E. Doolittle, who also had a \"hothouse\". Ascocenda Portia Doolittle, at least the examples known today, was not a spectacular plant, but it proved that these two genera could produce viable hybrids. Dr. Sideris had also made a more promising cross, Ascocentrum curvifolium × Vanda Rothschildiana, which he registered in 1950 as Ascocenda Meda Arnold. It was a stunning plant, with full, round, brilliant red flowers (and several other shades) over an inch across, well displayed on erect spikes. We found 66 AOS awards for this hybrid.\n\nWho was Meda Arnold? Born Meda Lorraine Sheldon, she was the wife of Dr. Harry Loren Arnold, a physician who seems to have come to Hawaii as a Major in the US Army before 1920. By 1930 he was in private practice. He was a founding partner in the Straub Clinic in Honolulu, and at his retirement in 1967, chief of staff at Queen's Hospital. He died in 1971. He and Meda had come from Michigan. Meda was born in Michigan in 1884, married there in 1911, and died in Honolulu in 1974.\n\nDid they grow orchids? They certainly did! Even during World War II, orchid shows were held in Honolulu, and Dr. Sideris was there. In 1949, show winners included C. P. Sideris, Dr. Harry L. Arnold, and Dr. Stewart E. Doolittle. In 1954, there was a two page photo essay in a local newspaper featuring Dr. Arnold and his orchids, in great detail. In 1950, the \"Garden of the Week\" column in the Honolulu Advertiser was devoted to the C. P. Sideris garden. The Advertiser also ran a column \"All About Orchids\" for a time, and in 1954, this column featured an extract from an article by Dr. Sideris in the Pacific Orchid Society of Hawaii Bulletin, on \"Iron in nutrient solutions for orchids\".\n\nWe know from SCOS newsletters that the early Ascocendas had arrived in the Long Beach area by 1964, because both Ascocenda Ophelia and Meda Arnold received awards from ODC judging at our meetings in 1964-1966. They may well have arrived in Long Beach as a direct result of charter flights for orchid hobbyists to Hawaii arranged by SCOS. One well-publicized tour, September 16-30, 1963, was dubbed \"South Coast Orchid Society's Rendezvous Hawaii\", at a cost of only $360.00. A full account of this tour appeared in the newsletter of the Orchid Society of Southern California. Arrangements were made by Fitzpatrick Travel and PanAmerican Airlines (remember PanAm?). Our happy SCOS tourists visited numerous orchid growers in the Islands, and we can only assume they brought back many orchid plants as souvenirs. Hawaii was such a popular place in those days that SCOS held an annual luau every August, with Hawaiian-themed decorations and entertainment.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ascocenda story continued. Hawaiian orchid grower Roy Fukumura tried the cross of a very nice Vanda cultivar for which he had won an award (Vanda Pukele 'Helen' HCC/AOS, awarded in 1960 at the Third Hawaiian Orchid Congress, Kahalui, Maui) with Ascocentrum curvifolium. Seedlings were distributed before any had bloomed; the first one to bloom had found its way to the Yip Kee Garden, a family-run nursery in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and the proprietor, Mr. Yip Sum Wah, registered it in 1965 as Ascocenda Yip Sum Wah, which quickly became even more famous than Meda Arnold. Yip Sum Wah turned out to be extremely productive, routinely producing one big spike a month, and quickly became a favorite for the cut flower trade, with weekly exports to Europe from Thailand. So far, we know of 108 AOS awards for Yip Sum Wah. Flower sizes for the awarded plants have generally been in the range of 1Â½\" to 2\", but a few have come close to 3\". Color range is generally red, with shades from red-orange to raspberry red, often with an overlay of dark red dots.\n\nThe natural consequence of these two stunning hybrids, Meda Arnold and Yip Sum Wah, was that someone would cross them. That honor went to Robert Perreira Orchids, of Kaneohe, Hawaii. The cross was registered in 1970 as Ascocenda Fiftieth State Beauty, which has received at least 38 AOS awards. The color range is excellent, including some rose shades; the size tends to be about the same as Meda Arnold. SCOS members brought in some fine cultivars for judging.\n\nToday there are still new \"Ascocendas\" being registered, but, since April, 2013, they are now all called Vandas, as a result of some taxonomic adventures that now need to be explained. We donât see many of them locally, but they are still popular in Hawaii and Southeast Asia. Some have larger flowers, and it appears some of the newer hybrids tend to be larger as well, as a result of further crosses with \"standard\" Vandas. The color range has expanded, too, as a result of crosses involving other genera (some of which, however, have also turned into Vandas).\n\nSCOS members are well aware of the taxonomic upheavals of the past couple decades. In part, the large-scale changes of orchid names have come about through the application of DNA sequencing methods. These methods have revealed unsuspected genetic relationships of various species and genera, some of which have by now been validated by additional research on morphology, pollination strategies, and detailed studies of natural populations. However, the technology is still evolving, and along with it, taxonomic concepts for interpreting the results.\n\nOne of the newer concepts we can call \"monophyletic purity\". For purposes of determining the boundaries of a genus, it is now almost an article of faith for many taxonomists that a genus can only contain the evolutionary descendants of a single hypothetical ancestor, and that it must contain all such descendants. It has become distinctly unfashionable to split out groups of species that are morphologically very distinct, unless all of the other related groups at the same level of the \"phylogenetic tree\" (usually derived through analysis of genetic data) are also split out into separate genera. For example, in order for the very distinct Neofinetia to remain as a separate genus, it would be necessary, under the idea of \"monophyletic purity\", to split Vanda and maybe some other, related groups of species that branch from the evolutionary \"family tree\" at about the same level, into multiple new genera. It is a sort of \"fairness\" argument that has nothing to do with the utility of the new classification for anyone, except possibly the taxonomists themselves. Further, it is an idea that gives primacy to genetic data, to the virtual exclusion of what the plants look like, how they behave in cultivation or in nature, or any other visible character that might actually be useful to the gardener or even to the field naturalist.\n\nOne of the ways that genetic data have been applied to orchid taxonomy is in the creation of a monumental revision of the genera of orchids, entitled by exact translation into Latin, Genera Orchidacearum, in six huge volumes. It is not, however, the size of the volumes that concerns us, but rather, their prohibitive cost. That the cost (initially about $160 per volume, but we have seen prices on the internet as high as $700 per volume) is actually prohibitive can be judged from the fact that we have been unable to locate anyone in our area who owns or has even held one of these volumes.\n\nPerhaps understanding that few people are likely ever to see or use these volumes, many of the contributors have published some or possibly all of their data elsewhere, but it is not yet clear how much additional information or what new interpretations may be found in Genera Orchidacearum. This fact makes the work difficult to evaluate.\n\nNevertheless, most of the decisions in these volumes concerning the names and composition of the genera of orchids have apparently been adopted by the Royal Horticultural Society as the basis for orchid hybrid nomenclature and registration. That is the story behind the elimination of the genus Odontoglossum, for example.\n\nFor Vanda, the story is mixed. Preliminary to the publication of the account in Volume 6 of Genera Orchidacearum, what appear to be the genetic data underlying it were published separately (Gardiner, Lauren Maria, Kocyan, Alexander, Motes, Martin, Roberts, David L, and Emerson, Brent C., 2013, Molecular phylogenetics of Vanda and related genera (Orchidaceae), Bot. J. Linn. Soc. 173:549-572). These authors presented data and derived phylogenetic trees based on selected regions of chloroplast DNA (for a total of 154 \"potentially informative characters\"), with the result that the Ascocentrums they sampled did not cluster together, but were instead interspersed with other Vanda species in the phylogenetic tree. That seemed to clinch the case that Ascocentrum and several other genera were not inherently separate and distinct from a genetic, evolutionary perspective, and should therefore be lumped into an enlarged genus Vanda. From this paper, it was apparently a short step to the account (which we still have not seen) in Volume 6 of Genera Orchidacearum (which finally appeared in 2014), and from there to the decision by the RHS to accept these conclusions — a decision, however, that was actually made in May, 2013, before Volume 6 had appeared (reported, for example, in Orchids 82(7):439 (July, 2013)).\n\nHowever, another study, comparing a much larger set of DNA markers, appeared in 2015, with a very different conclusion: Zou, Long-Hai, Huang, Jiu-Xiang, Zhang, Guo-Qiang, Liu, Zhong-Jian, Zhuang, Xue-Ying, 2015, A molecular phylogeny of Aeridinae (Orchidaceae: Epidendrioideae) inferred from multiple nuclear and chloroplast regions, Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 85:247-254. This team used not only the same chloroplast DNA regions as Gardiner et al. (although not necessarily with the same âprimersâ or results), but also included the âinternal transcribed spacerâ (ITS) regions from nuclear ribosomal DNA as well as other nuclear DNA regions, for a total of 1802 \"potentially informative characters\" — a major expansion of the amount of information available for working out the genetic relationships. In their hands, the final result was that Ascocentrum and Neofinetia, as well as other groups, proved to be distinct from the traditional Vanda genus. In terms of experimental design, the inclusion of a much larger selection of genetic data is expected to yield a better, more reliable result. Further, the fact that two apparently technically sound studies produced different results suggests that the question of generic boundaries is not yet settled, and must be confirmed by further studies. In effect, it looks like Genera Orchidacearum and the RHS may have jumped the gun. It would be better to wait until the scientific community has a chance to evaluate and confirm the experimental findings and to consider the taxonomic questions from more points of view. There is no need to rush taxonomy.\n\nUltimately, taxonomic revisions, no matter how authoritative they may appear, are only and always suggestions. There is always the expectation that they may need to be revised when additional information becomes available. In this case, we should remember Ascocendas, because we may need to bring them back, officially, someday.\n\nDecember, 2021\n\nKeyesara, the Latest Hybrid Genus Name Honoring an SCOS Member\n\nOver the years, friends and members of South Coast Orchid Society have been honored by the creation of new hybrid orchid genus names. The practice of naming a hybrid orchid genus after a person dates back to the early 20th Century, when it first became clear that botanical hybrids could in some cases be created from multiple genera. After reflection and deliberation, a committee of the Royal Horticultural Society proposed that hybrids involving three or more taxonomic genera could be named after a person, with the suffix -ara. The first such hybrid orchid genus was apparently Vuylstekeara (1911), which we discussed in a previous blog installment. The RHS orchid registrar Julian Shaw told us recently that, in round numbers, about 3,000 such hybrid genera (or \"nothogenera\") have been created, of which about 2,000 involve orchids. Hybridizers have been very busy!\n\nOne of these, only recently created, was named after former SCOS member Carl Keyes, and, we suggest, his wife Imogene. Carl and Imogene Keyes were regulars at our meetings from at least 1966 until about 1973. They exhibited plants for judging in Long Beach at least as late as 1978. They had moved from Burbank to the Santa Barbara area in 1973, and in 1980 to Arroyo Grande. Their plants won many awards at Long Beach judging sessions, and they were also members of the Orchid Society of Southern California in Los Angeles. Carl served as OSSC President 1969-1970. In those days, orchid growers, both hobbyists and nursery professionals, joined both SCOS and OSSC so that they would always be able to show their plants for judging while the flowers were in good condition, on the second Monday of the month for OSSC, or on the fourth Monday for SCOS. They called their collection Carimo Orchids, combining the first letters of their given names Carl and Imogene, and they used 'Carimo' as the cultivar name for most of their awarded plants as well. An appreciation of the Keyes was published after Carl's death in 1991 in Orchid Digest (55(4):179-180). See below for some of their accomplishments.\n\nThe first nothogenus named after a member of SCOS was Degarmoara, honoring former SCOS President Lloyd R. DeGarmo. The list continues: Fredclarkeara, Hugofreedara, Freedara, Hanesara (another SCOS President), Hasegawaara, Rehfieldara, and most recently, in 2009, Keyesara. Take a look at the table to see the component genera:\n\nHybrid Orchid Genera Honoring Past or Present SCOS Members\n\nSee below for examples of each one!\n\nNothogenus Component Genera Date Honoree Degarmoara* Brassia × Miltonia × Odontoglossum* 1968 Lloyd R.

Ironically, taxonomy, a discipline developed explicitly to bring stability to the naming of living things, has turned out to be by far the biggest disrupter of names in the orchid world. The problem is best illustrated with our first SCOS nothogenus, Degarmoara. It was created for hybrids of Brassia, Miltonia, and Odontoglossum, of which Lloyd DeGarmo had created the first one, Degarmoara Agnes, named after his mother. What could go wrong?\n\nFirst, parts of Miltonia were split out to form a new genus, Miltoniopsis. Any Degarmoara that involved one of those species would now need a new name. Later, Odontoglossum was split into several pieces (about half a dozen new genera), and, later, the species that still remained in Odontoglossum were then lumped into Oncidium. Finally, the original Miltonium species that went into Degarmoara Agnes, M. warsewiczii, ended up as Oncidium fuscatum. Degarmoara Agnes has thus ended up as Brassidium Agnes. Other Degarmoara hybrids, depending on exactly which species occur in their ancestry, have ended up in different places, such as Aliceara, Brassoncidopsis, and many others.\n\nRoughly the same thing has happened to all of the other SCOS-related nothogenera, with two exceptions: The taxonomy of the Catasetum group seems still to be intact, so Fredclarkeara has survived. Both Fred Clarke himself, and his spectacular Fredclarkeara hybrids have made a big splash in the orchid world, and we hope to see both of them as soon as the pandemic passes and we can again meet in person in Long Beach. For the moment, also, the genera involved in Keyesara seem safe for at least a few years.\n\nKeyesara involves the \"new\" Laelia species, the ones that have remained in Laelia such as anceps, autumnalis, gouldiana, etc., plus the ones newly transferred from Schomburkia. These all tend to have long, strong spikes, and they seem well adapted for outdoor growing in our area. So far, there are only a handful of Keyesara hybrids. We could only find one that has been photographed, and none seem to have been awarded yet. We predict there will be more!\n\nHow Carl Keyes Almost Got a Species Named in His Honor\n\nDr. Jack Fowlie MD (1929-1993), who served as editor for Orchid Digest for many years, met Carl and Imogene Keyes about 1966 at some orchid society meeting. It could well have been at SCOS, as Jack remembered that they had both driven a considerable distance to attend the meeting. Dr. Fowlie had many orchid interests; one of them was Paphiopedilum biology and taxonomy. When the Keyes had a new, unusual Paph coming into bloom, they invited Dr. Fowlie to take a look at their collection at their home in Burbank. From that sprang their friendship and collaboration.\n\nThe new Paphs in question were significant. Dr. Fowlie recalled, \"The ladyslipper that took me there proved to be from the Ang Thong Archipelago. We called it 'P. keysianum' and the plants that would be later be called P. acmodontum and P. hennisianum, also were first introduced to me there. Later the fates would take me searching for this initial ladyslipper in the Ang Thong Archipelago of Thailand, where we discovered it was a natural hybrid swarm, calling it P. × ang-thong. The tall scape came from P. niveum and the spotted pouch from P. godefroyae.\"\n\nFowlie eventually published his observations about the Ang Thong plants (Orchid Digest 41(3):117, 1977), giving them the name Paphiopedilum × ang-thong, describing them as a natural hybrid swarm derived from the species godefroyae and niveum. Later authors had other opinions about these plants, which seemed to be well separated geographically from both of the supposed parental species. Fowlie pointed out (in the same Orchid Digest issue where he recounted his friendship with the Keyes) that the Ang Thong plants were remarkably variable, and that many of them showed deformities in the flowers, which might be expected in a population derived from two not quite compatible species. In addition, he observed that the natural population of godefroyae came from the virtually inaccessible \"Birdsnest Islands\", for which the King of Thailand had an absolute concession both for the swifts' nests (they are not actually swallows) used in the famous soup, as well as all access to the islands. Fowlie managed to visit these islands, but only after making the acquaintance of the king's personal physician. Consequently, exports of godefroyae were very likely plants collected elsewhere, referrable either to leuchochilum or to the Ang Thong plants. The absence of a sufficient number of plants of known origin had badly clouded the taxonomy; plants of diverse origins appear to have ended up with diverse names, to the point where plants that might be derived from the Ang Thong population might be labeled as godefroyae, niveum, or leuchochilum, with or without a varietal name ang-thong. While there are apparently many different opinions about how to solve this puzzle taxonomically, Fowlie's observations on the extent of the natural variation in the Ang Thong and adjacent populations cannot be explained away. Carl and Imogene never got their keyesianum species, but it was their odd plant that set Fowlie on this quest.\n\nHybrids Named After Carl and Imogene Keyes\n\nCarl and Imogene created two Paph hybrids that they named after themselves. Paph. Carl Keyes (W. N. Evans × W. N. Firebrand) was registered in 1968. Paph. Imogene Keyes (Milionette × W. N. Evans) in 1975. Both received AOS awards; however, the only award photos we were able to locate were donated to OrchidWiz by the Cymbidium Society of America.\n\nIn addition, Ben Bracey created a hybrid now known as Cattleya Imogene Keyes (cinnabarina × Anzac (1921), registered in 1964 (no awards or photographs are known). Howard Liebman of Pacific Palisades, CA registered Odontioda (now Oncidium) Carl Keyes (Genadier × Lautrix) in 1974; this hybrid, cultivar 'Santa Barbara', received HCC/AOS when exhibited by Santa Barbara Orchid Estate November 9, 1981 at Los Angeles monthly judging. Finally, Howard Liebman created Aspasium Imogene Keyes (Aspasia princippissa × Odontioda (now Oncidium) Lippestern), registered in 1976 as a Lagerara (Aspasia × Cochlioda × Odontoglossum); a cultivar 'Black Knight' received AM/AOS when exhibited by Glenwood Orchid Acres, Mountain View, Hawaii August 11, 1995; this cultivar was illustrated in an article in the AOS Bulletin 51(9):931-936, \"Aspoglossum and Lagerara Hybrids\", by Howard Liebman, who considered his Lagerara Imogene Keyes to be the most successful Aspasia × Odontioda hybrid (grower and photographer credited as Keith Andrew).\n\nWe should also count here the hybrids called Carimo: Oncidopsis (formerly Vuylstekeara) Carimo, created and registered by Howard Liebman (1978); Paph. Carimo, created and registered by the Keyes in 1975, Carimo Reward in 1977, and Carimo Crimson in 1978.\n\nHybrids Created by Carl and Imogene Keyes\n\nCarl and Imogene are credited with creating 32 hybrids, of which they registered 24 themselves. Of the 32, 13 are Paphiopedilum, 8 are Oncidium, 7 are Phalaenopsis, 3 are Rhyncholaeliocattleya, 1 is a Cattleya. By far the most awarded of their creations is Paphiopedilum Deena Nicol (philippinense × glanduliferum), registered in 1987 by Paphanatics (Howard Koopowitz and Norito Hasegawa), various cultivars of which have received 6 HCC/AOS, 8 AM/AOS, and 4 CCM/AOS.\n\nAOS Awarded Plants of Carl and Imogene Keyes\n\nJack Fowlie remarked, \"At one point, Carl and his wife were told that as 'private growers', they had received more awards and trophies than anyone else in that category.\" (All AOS award photos © AOS, photographers unknown unless otherwise noted.

[AOS award no. 19740148. The same cultivar received a BM/CSA December 11, 1986 when exhibited by Paphanatics (Harold Koopowitz and Norito Hasegawa), and a photo from that event is in OrchidWiz, image #121933.]\n\nMarch 22, 1974:\n\nOncidium McNabianum 'Carimo' HCC/AOS, Santa Barbara International Orchid Show, Santa Barbara, CA. [AOS award no. 19740615.]\n\nPaphiopedilum Spring Tree 'Carimo' HCC/AOS, Santa Barbara International Orchid Show, Santa Barbara, CA.

[AOS award no. 19740518.]\n\nPaphiopedilum Charles Sladden 'Raspberry' HCC/AOS, Regional Monthly Judging, Los Angeles, CA. [AOS award no. 19740520.]\n\nCattleya Redzac 'Glow' HCC/AOS, Regional Monthly Judging, Los Angeles, CA. [AOS award no. 19740521. There are three versions of a single color photo in OrchidWiz that might be the award photo, but there is not enough information to be sure, as the grower, date, and award status are not listed for the photo. Now that we have located the award slide in the Pacific South collection, we know that the photos in OrchidWiz, while obviously old, were not taken at the judging session.]\n\nJuly 8, 1974:\n\nPaphiopedilum curtisii 'Purple Spendor' HCC/AOS, Regional Monthly Judging, Los Angeles, CA. [AOS award no. 19740553. This form is often listed as a synonym or variety of Paph. superbiens.]\n\nPhragmipedium Dominianum 'Bob Mc' HCC/AOS, Regional Monthly Judging, Los Angeles, CA. [AOS award no. 19740558. This cultivar, as 'Bob Mc' and 'Bob Mac', has received additional, later awards. The \"Bob\" in question might be Robert E. McElderry of Burlingame, CA, a close contemporary of the Keyes.]\n\nDecember 9, 1974:\n\nPaphiopedilum Soulageanum 'Carimo' HCC/AOS, Regional Monthly Judging, Los Angeles, CA. [AOS award no. 19740829.]\n\nPaphiopedilum bellatulum 'More Mesa' HCC/AOS, Regional Monthly Judging, Los Angeles, CA. [AOS award no. 19740833.]\n\nFebruary 10, 1975:\n\nPaphiopedilum Charles Sladden 'Carimo' HCC/AOS, Regional Monthly Judging, Los Angeles, CA.

[AOS award no. 19750349.]\n\nOncidium Grouse Mountain 'Grandeur' HCC/AOS, Regional Monthly Judging, Los Angeles, CA. [AOS award no. 19750355.]\n\nApril 28, 1975:\n\nPaphiopedilum lowii 'XLNT' AM/AOS, Regional Supplemental Monthly Judging, Long Beach, CA. [AOS award no. 19750458. OrchidWiz has an entry for this award under no. 19750953, as well another award with the same name but a description of an entirely different plant as award no. 19760458. The reason for this discrepancy between OrchidPro and OrchidWiz has to do with duplicate award numbers published in Awards Quarterly and subsequent efforts to untangle the resulting confusion in successive AOS award databases. Published in Awards Quarterly 7(4):94 (1976) without a photo. Note that XLNT is a brand of plastic-wrapped frozen tamal.]\n\nPhalaenopsis Dusky Rouge 'Goodie' HCC/AOS, Regional Supplemental Monthly Judging, Long Beach, CA. [AOS award no. 19750459. OrchidWiz has an entry for this award under no. 19750954, as well another award with the same name but a description of an entirely different plant as award no. 19760459, another example of confusion caused by duplicate award numbers that were published in Awards Quarterly. The photo attached to this award in OrchidPro actually belongs with award number 19750926, Phalaenopsis Natasha 'Eye'Dee', not connected in any way with the Keyes.]\n\nOncidium Crislette 'White Satin' HCC/AOS, Regional Supplemental Monthly Judging, Long Beach, CA. [AOS award no. 19750462. OrchidWiz has an entry for this award under no. 19750957, as well another award with the same name but a description of an entirely different plant as award no. 19760462. This award was also caught up in an episode of duplicate award numbers.]\n\nJune 9, 1975:\n\nOncidium Stropheon 'Carimo' HCC/AOS, Regional Monthly Judging, Los Angeles, CA. [AOS award no. 19750512.]\n\nJune 23, 1975:\n\nOncidium Golden Glacier 'Golden Eagle' HCC/AOS, Regional Supplemental Monthly Judging, Long Beach, CA.

[AOS award no. 19760317.] The version of the award photo in OrchidPro has a strong bluish tone that masks the colors obtained from the award slide.\n\nMarch 8, 1976:\n\nPaphiopedilum Golden Chalice 'Carimo Gold' HCC/AOS, Regional Monthly Judging, Los Angeles, CA. [AOS award no. 19760396. While the award photo has not been found, the same cultivar was exhibited at the Santa Barbara International Orchid Show in 1979, and there is a badly faded photo for that one. CSA provided a slightly better copy of the same 1979 AOS award photo to OrchidWiz, image #122052.]\n\nPaphiopedilum Blenheim Palace 'Carimo Pride' HCC/AOS, Regional Monthly Judging, Los Angeles, CA. [AOS award no. 19760397.]\n\nMarch 26, 1976:\n\nPaphiopedilum Charles Richman 'Royal Robe' AM/AOS, Santa Barbara International Orchid Show, Santa Barbara, CA.

It seems extremely unlikely that the Keyes would have exhibited in Atlanta for Regional Monthly Judging. This will need to be confirmed in Awards Quarterly, not yet examined. The AOS awards index 1932-1989 places this award at Los Angeles.]\n\nApril 7, 1978:\n\nPaphiopedilum Berenice 'Carimo Dark Emperor' AM/AOS, Santa Barbara International Orchid Show, Santa Barbara, CA. [AOS award no. 19780586. The photo in OrchidPro is badly faded.

The only one we know of is Hanesara Golden Beauty, created by Masao Yamada and registered by John Hanes in 1977. It is now, if it still exists at all, a Burkillara (=Aerides × Arachnis × Vanda). The parentage is Vanda (Neofinetia) falcata × Aeridachnis Bogor (which, in turn, is Arachnis hookeriana × Aerides odorata). It was likely a smallish Neofinetia-like plant with yellow flowers, but beyond that, we can't guess. Peter Lin, are you following this?\n\nHasegawaara ?\n\nHugofreedara ?\n\nWe haven't either!
