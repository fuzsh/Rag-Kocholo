        "text": "Logical Empiricism: Reframing Its Philosophical Significance\n\nLogical empiricism was one of the central projects in academic philosophy from roughly the late 1920s to the 1960s. It began in Europe, most importantly in Vienna and Berlin, and, with the rise of fascism in Europe, eventually reached its mature and most influential state in the United States of America. The first of the logical empiricists to emigrate from Europe to the United States was Herbert Feigl in 1931; he was followed in the 1930s by many others, including Gustav Bergmann, Rudolf Carnap, Philipp Frank, Carl Hempel, Hans Reichenbach, and Edgar Zilsel. Logical empiricism played a large role in shaping the contours of American academic philosophy, especially after World War II. Logical empiricism was central to the development of formal logic, metalogic, semantics and philosophy of language, philosophy of science, and (especially formal) epistemology. It was also important in the development of noncognitivism in ethics. The rise and flourishing of analytic philosophy in the United States, Britain, and then throughout the world depended upon the prominence of logical empiricism. By the same token, since the 1970s, if not before, analytic philosophy has understood itself to have progressed away from the doctrines and techniques of philosophy associated with logical empiricism. Logical empiricism was once an important movement within analytic philosophy and is now no longer a movement in analytic philosophy (or elsewhere).\n\nThis one-paragraph summation of logical empiricism is about as uncontroversial as any set of claims about the recent history of philosophy can be. Any reputable book-length history of analytic philosophy contains at least one chapter on logical empiricism. Logical empiricism is, within such histories, associated with new logical techniques for doing philosophy as well as with certain fundamental, but ultimately naïve and mistaken philosophical doctrines – the verificationist theory of meaning, the rejection of metaphysics, the linguistic doctrine of logical truth, the claim that mathematics and logic are purely formal or analytic, and perhaps a few others. The chapters on logical empiricism in these histories typically have a common structure, then: they show the original relation of logical empiricism to other foundational projects in analytic philosophy and why the doctrines associated with logical empiricism have an initial attraction and, perhaps, plausibility, but then provide the decisive arguments against those doctrines. Armed with such arguments against such doctrines, rather than against a whole tradition of philosophizing, analytic philosophy continues past logical empiricism, absorbing both its useful technical advances and the rejection of its central doctrines. The next chapters of the histories often go to the work of those associated with the anti-logical–empiricist arguments, usually Willard van Orman Quine, occasionally the late Ludwig Wittgenstein or Oxford ordinary language philosophy.\n\nThis Element will outline a different view. The problem is not so much that the other stories are wrong. In a real sense, the stories have become self-certifying: in virtue of being repeated for more than half a century these stories give an account of logical empiricism and its legacy that the vast majority of trained analytic philosophers take for granted. The influence logical empiricism has had for a couple of generations is largely the influence assigned to it by these stories. Nonetheless, the stories have been reconsidered recently from a variety of angles – there is now an enormous literature reevaluating logical empiricism. Within this literature, for example, it has been disputed that logical empiricism is a project that can properly be connected to a few central doctrines such that, should these doctrines be refuted, the project is dead; against this, it has been noted that several of the core logical empiricists never adopted some of the alleged core doctrines or came to reject those doctrines while still thinking of themselves as pursuing the same overall philosophical project. This Element will deploy some of the central themes of the literature reappraising logical empiricism to offer a new account of the significance of logical empiricism for twentieth-century philosophy. This Element will take seriously (while lacking space to detail) both the range of different projects embedded within logical empiricism and the wealth of materials the logical empiricists drew upon within those projects. But it will, as it must, delimit the scope of its interests and concentrate on a few key figures and issues.\n\nWhat Is Logical Empiricism? A First Account\n\nIn order to undertake the project of this Element, we of course need to know the referent and the meaning of the term “logical empiricism.” We also need to draw out explicitly the largely implicit default story of logical empiricism that those trained in analytic philosophy imbibe in order to motivate a reappraisal.\n\nIn the matter of reference, matters are relatively straightforward. The groups who aligned themselves with the project were the members of the Vienna Circle and the Berlin Group associated with Hans Reichenbach (Reference Milkov and PeckhausMilkov and Peckhaus 2013). The Vienna Circle is among the most famous groups of early twentieth-century philosophers. Its members also did the historian of logical empiricism the favor of writing a manifesto in which they explained their philosophical views and presented their membership this is the Wissenschaftliche Weltauffassung (Scientific World-Conception) of 1929 and produced several participant histories (Reference Neurath, Carnap, Hahn, Stadler and UebelNeurath et al. [1929] 2012). We will get to the vision of philosophy offered in the manifesto shortly. Here we will discuss briefly the membership circa 1929.\n\nWhat in 1929 announced itself as the Vienna Circle began meeting in 1922 when the physicist-turned-philosopher Moritz Schlick arrived in Vienna to become the fourth occupant in the chair for philosophy of the inductive sciences, a chair that had been founded for Ernst Mach in 1895. The 1929 manifesto was written in celebration of Schlick’s decision to stay in Vienna and thus to continue as the central figure around whom the Circle was organized. The principal authors of the manifesto were the philosopher Rudolf Carnap, the sociologist and political economist Otto Neurath, and the mathematician Hans Hahn (Reference Uebel, Neurath, Stadler and UebelUebel 2012). In addition to these four figures, the manifesto lists ten members of the Circle: Gustav Bergmann, Herbert Feigl, Philipp Frank, Kurt Gödel, Viktor Kraft, Karl Menger, Marcel Natkin, Olga Hahn-Neurath, Theodor Radakovic, and Friedrich Waismann. The number of intellectuals in Vienna who were associated with the Circle was much larger than this; Friedrich Stadler’s definitive history of the Circle lists about twenty more figures who were in some way and at some point affiliated with the Circle (Reference StadlerStadler 2015).\n\nThe authors of the manifesto claimed that their project was an international movement and thus listed a group of figures “close to the Vienna Circle.” These included the Berliners Walter Dubislav, Kurt Grelling, and Hans Reichenbach. They also listed several more Viennese scholars: the architect Josef Frank (Philipp’s brother), Heinrich Loewy, and Edgar Zilsel. Rounding out this group, they listed Hasso Härlen of Stuttgart, Eno Kaila of Finland, Frank P. Ramsey of Cambridge, and Kurt Reidemeister of Koenigsberg. The pamphlet also listed Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell, and Ludwig Wittgenstein as the “leading representatives of the scientific world conception.” This provides us with a wide enough range of persons and views, although we need to make one addition: in 1929, Reichenbach’s student Carl Hempel was too young to be well known to the Viennese authors of the manifesto. He would in time become one of the central figures in American logical empiricism, however.\n\nIn an important sense, logical empiricism just is the philosophy presented and exemplified by these figures – at least for some period of their careers. This is not ordinarily, however, how we think of philosophical projects or schools of thought. We usually present them as content – we present their methods, goals, and tenets. This is how the default story of logical empiricism is told. We can approach the telling of this story through a few of the key documents in the articulation of logical empiricism.\n\nBefore we begin, we must deal with an initial complication. The project that came to be called “logical empiricism” had many names, even if we restrict our attention to those who identified with or endorsed the project. Within the Anglophone context, the first name associated with the project was “logical positivism,” which was the term chosen by the young American recruit Albert Blumberg and Feigl in their Reference Blumberg and Feigl1931 introductory essay (Reference Blumberg and FeiglBlumberg and Feigl 1931). Only about a decade later was that term routinely discarded in favor of “logical empiricism,” a slight variation of a term (“logistic empiricism”) introduced for an Anglophone audience by Reichenbach in the mid-1930s (Reference ReichenbachReichenbach 1936). For some of the figures in the movement, some of the names were importantly more accurate than others; other figures were indifferent to the question of naming. For some (such as Neurath), certain words (such as “philosophy”) were dangerously vague or ambiguous and to be avoided. The change of names is sometimes itself marshaled as an argument for a degenerating trajectory: a robust anti-metaphysical positivist project became an increasingly diluted project of empiricism. I will continue to use “logical empiricism” as my main term – this was the term most used by adherents as the project gained prominence in the American context. But in this historical sketch, we must begin with “logical positivism” – a term that retains a strong presence in the wider academic world, especially among scientists and among those critical of positivism.\n\nAs just noted, the term “logical positivism” was first used in print to discuss the philosophy of the Vienna Circle in 1931 in an essay Blumberg and Feigl wrote for the Journal of Philosophy. Blumberg and Feigl introduce the term “logical positivism” with the following words: “To facilitate criticism and to forestall even more unfortunate attempts at labeling this aspect of contemporary European philosophy, we shall employ the term ‘logical positivism.’ Although it is perhaps the best among many poor ones, the name may suggest a mere rephrasing of traditional positivism. However, this is not the case” (Reference Blumberg and FeiglBlumberg and Feigl 1931, pp. 281–282).\n\nThe term was meant to do two things: summarize the main features of the philosophy on offer, and suggest the relations of that philosophy to other historically given philosophical projects, especially positivism. Moreover, Blumberg and Feigl are clear that the term, while better than others they could think of, was not really adequate for the purposes for which it was introduced. Each of these aspects of the term deserves at least a bit more elaboration.\n\nThe first point speaks to the innovations of logical positivism as Blumberg and Feigl present it. One of the most interesting phenomena in recent European philosophy was, they argued, the convergence of two significant traditions: the positivistic-empirical and the logical. Comparable in importance to the Kantian synthesis of rationalism and empiricism, this new movement was sharply distinguished from Kantianism both by its results and by the fact that it embodies not the work of an individual, but the agreement of numerous logicians, philosophers, and scientists who independently arrived at the position.\n\nGiven this interpretative framework, the authors go on to argue that the epistemology of empirical knowledge, especially empirical science, has been the purview of empiricist epistemology, but this project has traditionally underestimated and misunderstood the nature and importance of logical and mathematical knowledge. Rationalism has been better at explaining mathematical and logical knowledge but has traditionally underestimated and misunderstood the nature and importance of empirical knowledge. Their logical positivism was the attempt, inspired by revolutionary new advances in the formal sciences and in the understanding of the methodology of exact physical science, to recombine in a non-Kantian way the insights of rationalism and empiricism and to understand the role of the formal sciences in empirical knowledge. Thus, the account at once paid homage to the significance of Kant’s philosophical ambitions and acknowledged the failure of Kant’s project adequately to fulfill those ambitions.\n\nThe choice of the term “logical positivism” expressed both the synthetic element of the project and a philosophical and historical connection to the project of nineteenth-century positivism. The “traditional” Machian positivism toward which the passage just quoted gestures was, crudely, an attempt to provide a generally empiricist experiential foundation to empirical scientific knowledge and to reject, as beyond our experiential ken, the claims of metaphysics. Thus, a Machian positivist would attempt to explain the nature of, say, knowledge of the physical world through attention to how physical concepts (such as force or mass or energy) organize the content of experience while claiming that notions such as cause or essence or ideal value go beyond what we can experience and thus should be rejected. Logic, within the project Blumberg and Feigl offer, will provide the purely formal framework within which to express the relations of scientific claims to experience. Moreover, the techniques of definition within modern formal logic provide, finally, a precise and general instrument to make exact the negative claim about metaphysics. By showing that the alleged claims of metaphysics contain concepts that cannot be defined on the basis of experience, logic can show exactly why such claims should be rejected: they are not rejected because they are false or subjective or dangerous but because they are, strictly speaking, meaningless.\n\nLogic thus at once allows logical positivism to connect their technical concerns to traditional rationalism (while rejecting the synthetic a priori), fulfill the project of empiricist epistemology, clarify and discharge the anti-metaphysical tasks of positivism, and occupy a position within philosophy reminiscent of that claimed by Kant. It also does more than that. For, as the authors then detail, logic and mathematics both set and solve an epistemological problem within modern physical methodology that none of the previous projects could even express (Reference Blumberg and FeiglBlumberg and Feigl 1931, pp. 288ff). A simplified version of the issue can be presented within the context of the question of whether physical space is Euclidean or non-Euclidean, a topic of significant import to logical positivism due to its centrality in the history of relativistic physics.\n\nEuclidean geometry differs from its non-Euclidean alternatives in many ways; importantly for our question, these geometries differ in their theorems about properties such as the angle-sum property for triangles and the ratio between the radius of a circle and its circumference. So, for example, in Euclidean (flat) geometry, all triangles have angles that sum to a straight angle or 180 degrees. In non-Euclidean geometries of constant negative curvature, all triangles have angles that sum to less than 180 degrees, and the difference between the sum and 180 degrees increases with the size of the triangle. Non-Euclidean geometries of constant positive curvature have angles that sum to more than 180 degrees, and the difference between the sum and 180 degrees increases with the size of the triangle. This suggests an empirical test regarding the geometry of physical space: given a big enough triangle, we should be able to discern whether the angles sum to 180 degrees or less or more than that. The great German mathematician Christian Gauss undertook such measurements using light beamed from mountaintops and discerned no divergence from Euclidean structure.\n\nLogical positivism asks for philosophical care to be taken at just this point. Measuring the angles between light beams helps us determine the angle-sum property for physical triangles only if light travels in straight lines. How can you determine this? You could see if light can be beamed along the edge of a straightedge. But this again presumes that the straightedge is straight, and how do you determine that? Eventually, say the logical positivists, building on their understanding of the work of Einstein and Henri Reference PoincaréPoincaré ([1902] 2017), you get to a point where you cannot empirically check for physical straightness but rather must make a conventional choice about what you are going to count as straight. Within the parlance employed by Blumberg and Feigl, which they took from the work of Reichenbach, the scientist must make a conventional choice of an axiom or definition of coordination (Reference Blumberg and FeiglBlumberg and Feigl 1931, p. 289). What is coordinated is, on the one hand, an already well-defined mathematical concept or structure (straightest possible line, in the example) and, on the other, experientially available processes in the physical world (for example, the path of a light ray or a straightedge). Gauss, for example, instead of presuming that light travels in straight lines, should have said something like “I hereby choose ‘path of a light ray’ to be what ‘physically straight line’ means.” Once you have done that you have a way to coordinate the experimental result with the theorems of the various geometries, and only then can you take yourself to be testing those geometries against facts given in experience at all.\n\nIn the example, the coordination is between a specific geometrical concept – a straight line – and a particular physical process – the path of light rays. The coordination could, however, be more global; one could decide, for example, that Euclidean geometry is the simplest to work with and, thus, that you wish to use it. You have thereby conventionally chosen a Euclidean structure for space. Any complications arising from this decision could be pushed into more and more complicated physics. There might be limits on how far you would want to go in this direction – Einstein himself objected to gravity conceived of as a universal force, preferring to alter the underlying space-time geometry. Similarly, certain circumstances might require violations of causal connection if a Euclidean space(-time) is chosen. But here too there are methodological trade-offs only, not demands offered to the very nature of experience, reason, or science. There is never a simple empirical refutation of an assertion about the metrical geometry of space(-time).\n\nIt is the novelty of this sort of epistemological problem – one not known to classical empiricism or nineteenth-century positivism – that explains the unhappiness Blumberg and Feigl have with their own chosen moniker, “logical positivism.” Logical positivism was a philosophy of scientific knowledge as developed in close contact with revolutionary developments in the exact sciences and the issues raised were not the same as the epistemological problems central to the projects of traditional philosophy of any stripe. Rather, the most precise accounts of the epistemological problem and its solution were to be found in the methodological and scientific work of the exact scientists themselves, especially in the work of Einstein and Poincaré. The name “logical positivism” was a decidedly backward-looking name – a name that placed logical positivism in an historical development of philosophy – but the philosophy espoused was presented as revolutionary, as importantly unprecedented, as dependent on clarifications of the foundations of knowledge revealed in the then-contemporary revolutions in exact science.\n\nThe example of conventionalism in geometry gives a flavor of the revolutionary aspect of the scientific context within which the logical empiricists were working, but it surely does not provide anything approaching a synoptic vision. Even in physics, there were other important elements to their interests in the content and methodology of new theories – questions of causation and determinism in quantum mechanics, the methods of metrology and operationalism, the questions of what counts, after the general theory of relativity, as giving a properly unified account of physical forces, and much more. Moreover, they were also interested in the revolutionary changes in mathematical logic and the conceptions of rigorous foundations of analysis as well as in arguably revolutionary changes in social science and psychology in the work of Max Weber, the behaviorists, and the Gestalt psychologists. Revolution in science and, for some of them, such as Neurath, also in politics, was very much in the air.\n\nThis revolutionary vision of logical empiricism is to be found not only in this introductory work by Blumberg and Feigl – such rhetoric abounds in the literature of logical empiricism of the time. It is evident in the aforementioned 1929 public announcement of the Vienna Circle, Wissenschaftliche Weltauffassung. In this work, the authors claimed that its philosophical work was revolutionary not merely in the details of the epistemological problem that it takes up, but also in its entire mode of philosophical inquiry, a mode that brings philosophy finally into the modern world and ties it to other socially progressive intellectual and practical movements. The revolutionary new philosophy espoused takes its place within science, not beyond it, and it serves not to limit the possibilities of scientific knowledge, but to foster them:\n\nThere is no such thing as philosophy as a basic or universal science alongside or above the various fields of the one empirical science; there is no path to genuine knowledge other than the path of experience; there is no realm of ideas that stands over or beyond experience. Nevertheless, the work of “philosophical” or “foundational” investigations in the spirit of the scientific world-conception remains important. For the logical clarification of scientific concepts, propositions, and methods liberates one from inhibiting prejudices. Logical and epistemological analysis by no means wants to set limit scientific inquiry; on the contrary, analysis provides science with as complete a range of formal possibilities as is possible, from which to select what best fits each empirical finding (example: non-Euclidean geometries and the theory of relativity).\n\n(Reference Neurath, Carnap, Hahn, Stadler and UebelNeurath et al. [1929] 2012, p. 89; emphasis in the original)\n\nEven Schlick, a more personally and politically conservative person than most of the logical empiricists, could not at this time contain his revolutionary rhetoric. He was given the first word in the logical empiricist house journal, Erkenntnis, in 1930 and chose for the title of his piece “Die Wende der Philosophie” (“The Turning Point in Philosophy”; Reference Schlick and AyerSchlick ([1930] 1959). He placed his remarks within the context of a general concern about the objectivity and progress of philosophy, noting that many commentators on the history of philosophy have found it little more than a conflict of systems offered by individual philosophers and elaborated by schools devoted to those philosophers. In the essay, he cites a methodological advance as the reason philosophy circa 1930 is able to turn away from such a fruitless conflict of systems:\n\nI am convinced that we now find ourselves at an altogether decisive turning point in philosophy, and that we are objectively justified in considering that an end has come to the fruitless conflict of systems. We are already at the present time, in my opinion, in possession of methods which make every such conflict in principle unnecessary. What is now required is their resolute application.\n\nThis advance had two parts: the technical advances of formal logic and the epistemological advance in the understanding of the nature of logical truth. Regarding the latter, Schlick argued that once we understand logical (and mathematical) truth as purely formal, we can see that it is not a branch of science with its own special subject matter but rather a purely formal discipline that presents frameworks within which any knowledge of any subject can and must be couched. The philosophy of logical empiricism is simply the precise elaboration of logical systems for science.\n\nBased on this exposition, we are now in a position to understand some of the core doctrines of logical empiricism, if not in their full technical detail, then in their philosophical motivations. Consider, for example, their commitment to there being a difference in principle between the nature of logico-mathematical truth and empirical truth. This commitment is embedded in the conventionalist story. That story begins with the various systems of metrical geometry having been fully developed as mathematical systems. For example, what a Euclidean straight line or a geodesic in a geometry of constant negative curvature is, is wholly a matter of mathematical definition. The ability of consistent axiom systems in mathematics to pick out structures that fulfill them is not in question; it is taken for granted. The question asked is how these mathematical structures are brought to bear on the world of matters of fact of experience in order to render possible a precise, predictive, mathematized knowledge of nature. But it is not just the truths of logic and mathematics that have this status of not having either truth makers in or confirmed by experience. Also, the conventions that connect the mathematics to the world of experience also have this epistemological status; the conventions are, in the very nature of the case, not empirically grounded but chosen. They can turn out to be simple or difficult to work with, but they cannot be confirmed or falsified. It is a further elaboration of this idea that led to the distinction between analytic and synthetic sentences within logically formalized languages, which is how the distinction between logico-mathematical truth, on the one hand, and empirical truth, on the other, ultimately is analyzed in logical empiricism beginning around 1930. The analytic/synthetic distinction is a way to make logically precise the informal epistemology on which the conventionalist methodology relies.\n\nAmong the reasons to wish to convert the informal epistemology of conventionalism into a rigorous distinction of logical and methodological claims within science was a general distrust the logical empiricists had about philosophical vocabulary. This attitude is most prominently displayed in their efforts to show that metaphysical claims are meaningless. How might one in a rigorous fashion show that an allegedly meaningful concept (say, cause or essence) is meaningless? One idea would be this: begin with a language adequate for the description of experience, use the techniques of formal logic (already, as we have seen, shown to be analytic, meaningful but making no claims about the world of experience) to show how all other empirical concepts can be defined from the primitive terms of that description. This is one way to express the verificationist theory of empirical or cognitive meaningfulness: all empirical concepts are definable in a language of pure experience so that any empirical claim can be translated into a logically complicated statement in that language. All statements of metaphysics can then be shown to be empirically meaningless by showing that they contain concepts undefinable in the language of experience. The claims of metaphysics defy any effort to regiment into a system of axioms connected by definition to experience. Nor, of course, do the metaphysicians think that they are doing merely formal work with concepts – they insist that they are making substantive statements about the world; metaphysics is not a branch of mathematics. The logical empiricists respond to this situation as follows: we respect the intention that metaphysics be a substantive discipline but as far as we can tell, given the failure to find a consistent set of definitions that tie such concepts to experience, metaphysicians do not succeed in actually making statements about the world. We eliminate metaphysics in this way; in order to avoid eliminating epistemology or philosophy of science along with metaphysics, it must be shown how to regiment the heretofore informal concepts of epistemology or methodology of science into logically precise concepts. What is not unclear about the a priori or the conventional is captured in the formal definition of analyticity for a language of science. This is Carnap’s project in the logic of science.\n\nThe Received Significance of Logical Empiricism\n\nNo story worth telling is a story simply of a project that was born, developed, and was superseded. If logical empiricism is worth caring about, there must be some account of the significance of it. The most salient stories of the significance of logical empiricism have framed that significance as a part of the development of the project of empiricism, on the one hand, or analytic philosophy, on the other. Often the two frames are combined.\n\nThis framing of the significance of logical empiricism is due largely to the logical empiricists themselves. We have already seen that Blumberg and Feigl presented logical empiricism (their “logical positivism”) as a project that combined empiricism with a commitment to a formalist account of logical and mathematical truth. Even earlier, the Vienna Circle explained their philosophical work in similar ways. Already in 1929, in the Wissenschaftliche Weltauffassung, Neurath, Carnap, and Hahn explained their philosophical point of view this way:\n\nWe have characterized the scientific world-conception essentially by two features. First it is empiricist and positivist: there is knowledge only from experience, which rests on what is immediately given. This sets the limits for the content of legitimate science. Second, the scientific world-conception is marked by the application of a certain method, namely that of logical analysis. The aim of scientific work is to reach the goal, unified science, by applying logical analysis to the empirical material.\n\nThe most diligent framer of the history of logical empiricism within the history of empiricism is, however, perhaps logical empiricism’s most famous critic, Quine. Much of Quine’s work has a distinctively historical cast to it and throughout that work he is at pains to locate logical empiricism – especially Carnap’s logical empiricism – within the larger project of empiricism tout court. Thus, for example, Quine’s “Five Milestones of Empiricism” presents an entirely internal history of empiricism, starting from Locke and ending with Quine himself (Reference Quine and QuineQuine 1981). Along the way, the philosophy of the Vienna Circle is presented within the second milestone of empiricism, the move from concern with the meanings of words to the meanings of sentences. Even more crucial than the positive place for logical empiricism in Quine’s story is the negative place for it. Each of the last three of Quine’s milestones of empiricism are aspects of his own repudiation of Carnap: holism (the move of semantic concern from sentences to systems of sentences), monism (the repudiation of the analytic/synthetic distinction), and naturalism.\n\nThe significance of Carnap’s philosophy is, throughout Quine’s work, understood as a particular kind of effort to employ logic in the service of stringently empiricist epistemological goals. This is perhaps most evident in Quine’s account of “Viennese philosophy” in the opening paragraphs of his essay “Carnap and Logical Truth” (Reference Quine and SchilppQuine 1963). There Quine claims that one embarrassment for historical empiricism was mathematics, which seemed to have both a certainty and a distance from experience that traditional empiricism could not countenance. This empiricist puzzle about mathematics was precisely the problem the Vienna Circle proposed to solve through a new account of the nature of logical and mathematical truth. Quine explains as follows:\n\nWhat now of the empiricist who would grant certainty to logic, and to the whole of the mathematics, and yet would make a clean sweep of other non-empirical theories under the name of metaphysics? The Viennese solution to this nice problem was predicated on language. Metaphysics was meaningless through misuse of language; logic was certain through tautologous use of language.\n\nQuine calls the idea that logical truths are true in virtue of the meanings of terms “the linguistic doctrine of logical truth.” Throughout the essay, he represents the doctrine as an “epistemological doctrine” – a doctrine in an empiricist epistemology of logic.\n\nThis understanding of logical empiricism is the framework also for Quine’s most famous essay, “Two Dogmas of Empiricism,” in which the analytic/synthetic distinction is presented as one of the dogmas of foundationalist empiricism (Reference QuineQuine 1951). Moreover, Quinean holism and its consequences, monism and naturalism, are also, in Quine’s account, in the service of empiricism. Quine’s is of course a de-dogmatized empiricism. No longer does the empiricist philosopher feel embarrassed by mathematics, which is now recognized not as a priori at all, but merely as at quite a large remove from experience. There is no longer in Quinean empiricism a distinctive class of analytic sentences that achieve their truth in a uniquely nonempirical way. Indeed, as Quine presents it, monism follows from empiricism directly once a moderate holism regarding theory testing is accepted. Empiricism assigns to sentences only their empirical consequences as their meanings, but holism reminds us that no sentence by itself has any significant empirical consequences. Thus, there is nothing to assign as the meaning of an individual sentence. The empirical significance of a large enough chunk of theory can still be given; what cannot be done is to divvy up that significance sentence by sentence in order to arrive at the empirical meaning of each individual claim. Thus, since analytic sentences were supposed to differ from synthetic sentences in having no empirical meaning, our conclusion (no assignable empirical meaning for any sentence) gives us no way to delimit the class of analytic sentences.\n\nWhile the largest feature of Quine’s account of logical empiricism is its place within the history of empiricism, another historical narrative is also in play in Quine’s work. Quine presents an empiricist epistemology at the heart of analytic philosophy. Thus, on Quine’s view, Carnap’s empiricist epistemological project in his 1928 Der logische Aufbau der Welt (Reference CarnapCarnap [1928] 1961a) derives from the empiricist epistemology of Bertrand Russell’s External World Program: “To account for the external world as a logical construct of sense data – such, in Russell’s terms was the program. It was Carnap, in his Der logische Aufbau der Welt of 1928, who came closest to executing it” (Reference Quine and QuineQuine 1969, p. 74). More generally, Quine assimilates, in his “Five Milestones,” the logical and semantical doctrines of Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein, to the epistemological project of empiricism. Thus, Quine invites us to read logical empiricism as an episode also in the history of analytic philosophy. It is just that Quine’s analytic philosophy is continuous with an empiricist epistemological tradition that went right back into the seventeenth century.\n\nRethinking the Significance of Logical Empiricism\n\nSo far, with very few exceptions, I have used the phrase “logical empiricism” in the singular, and surely logical empiricism has some form of unity. But the recent interpretative literature has argued that one way in which the standard story is impoverished is that takes logical empiricism to be a vastly more monolithic project than it actually was. The standard history, implicitly or explicitly, makes Carnap the central figure in logical empiricism. Carnap is clearly the main target of Quine’s criticisms. Sometimes Quine seems to invite his readers to equate logical empiricism with Carnap’s philosophy. When, for example, the failure of the analytic/synthetic distinction to do some epistemological work is taken as a refutation of all of logical empiricism, crucial differences between Carnap’s and the other logical empiricist projects are often elided. Partially in response to this problem of interpretation and partially simply to recover interesting philosophical voices, there has arisen a literature that seeks to emphasize other versions of logical empiricism, often arguing that those versions do not suffer from the same philosophical problems that the Carnapian version does.\n\nWithin this literature of recovery, Neurath’s logical empiricism is often given pride of place. Quine offered naturalism as the replacement project within empiricism for Carnapian formalism; Neurath is of immediate interest for Quine’s story, then, because he offered a naturalistic version of logical empiricism right back into the 1920s. Moreover, Quine knew this and chose one version of Neurath’s famous boat metaphor as the motto of his Word and Object (Reference QuineQuine 1960). This raises interesting questions about how one can be both a naturalist and a logical empiricist – Neurath seems not ever to have endorsed the two dogmas of empiricism that are the key to overcoming logical empiricism. The reintroduction into historical consciousness of Neurath’s project cannot help but complicate the standard history of logical empiricism.\n\nNeurath is interesting in other, not unrelated, ways also in complicating the standard history of logical empiricism. Neurath was a social scientist and both his sense of science and his main areas of interest in philosophy of science stemmed from his training in political economy and sociology. He also was a scholar of history, including history of science. He wrote papers in history of economics and history of physics. Neurath was also a deeply politically engaged and explicitly Austro-Marxist thinker and actor. Neurath clashed with both Carnap and Schlick on the evidentiary role of experience and the foundations of empirical knowledge in the protocol sentence debate. Thus, the aims and the methods of Neurath’s logical empiricism do not seem the same as those we have come to associate with default logical empiricism. This difference between Neurath’s and more technical logical empiricisms is thematized already in the 1929 manifesto:\n\nThe scientific world-conception is close to the life of the present. Certainly it will face hard battles and hostility … Of course not every single adherent of the scientific world-conception will be a fighter. Some, glad of solitude, will lead a withdrawn existence on the icy slopes of logic; some may even disdain mingling with the masses and regret the “trivialization” which is inevitable when popularizing.\n\nIt would seem, therefore, if logical empiricism is to accommodate both Carnap and Neurath, it will have to be a fairly broad-church movement, not one easily codified into a few shared philosophical doctrines and methods. Again, not only does Neurath complicate the picture for the historian, he thematizes this complication in his own work. Neurath decried any attempt to reduce logical empiricism to a list of agreed-upon philosophical theses: “A program formed of statements accepted by all collaborators would be narrow and would be a source of divergences in the near future … The maximum of co-operation – that is the program!” (Reference Neurath, Neurath, Carnap and MorrisNeurath 1938, pp. 23–24). His complicated understanding of the unity of the sciences was also exemplified – not accidentally – in his understanding of the complexities of the unity of logical empiricism itself.\n\nOf course, adding Neurath’s voice to the history of logical empiricism is merely a first step toward diversifying our understanding of the project. As noted earlier, Reference StadlerStadler (2015) lists more than thirty members of the Vienna Circle with many more allied persons in Vienna and abroad. The Vienna Circle by the early 1930s had room within it for, for example, explicitly Wittgensteinian philosophers such as Schlick and his assistant Friedrich Waismann, philosophers influenced by phenomenology such as Felix Kaufmann, and the Marxist historian of science and intellectual historian Edgar Zilsel, as well as figures, including the logician Kurt Gödel, the mathematicians Hans Hahn and Karl Menger, and the physicist Philipp Frank, whose largest contributions, at least early in their careers, were mainly in scientific disciplines. The Vienna Circle had considerable contact with other philosophical and scientific figures such as Karl Popper, the psychologists Karl Bühler and Egon Brunswik, the historian of philosophy Heinrich Gomperz, and the architect Josef Frank. In Berlin, Hempel eventually received his doctoral degree, after Reichenbach’s forced removal with the rise of Nazism, under the direction of the eminent Gestalt psychologist Wolfgang Köhler. Reichenbach himself was hired into the physics faculty at Berlin in 1926 and had considerable contact with psychologists in Berlin, especially Kurt Lewin. Finding a common core of philosophical theses definitive of logical empiricism, given this diversity, seems unlikely, probably simply wrongheaded.\n\nAttention to the variety of projects that the logical empiricists undertook or allied themselves with has been instrumental in loosening the hold of the standard story, at least among scholars of the movement. From this perspective, the standard story is not so much a general report on the influence of logical empiricism on philosophy as a lesson drawn by analytic philosophers about logical empiricism’s importance for the development of analytic philosophy. This being the case, the standard story is less explanatory than in need of explanation: How and why did logical empiricism come to be reduced from the various and disparate elements it had in the European context to a narrow and specifically formalistic project that can be neatly slotted into a history of analytic philosophy? Did the diverse figures within logical empiricism come to understand the significance of their philosophies in terms of the advancement of logical analysis and empiricism, when, and why? Why did the socially active aspect of logical empiricism announced in 1929 fall away? From the broader viewpoint of historically available options for logical empiricism, the standard story now appears as deeply contingent, even surprising, not the inevitable working out of the problems with a few original and core logical empiricist doctrines.\n\nAnother, more directly conceptual historicist issue intersects with the literatures of complication and also suggests that the standard story of logical empiricism ought to have the status of a problem rather than a solution. As we have seen, the standard story trades in two principal philosophical notions, empiricism and analytic philosophy. Any reasonable historicism asks us, when presented with an account of a project, X, by placing it in a tradition, Y, to ask whether and to what extent Y can do that work. In the case of logical empiricism, the two frames suffer from different but ultimately similar important problems.\n\nTo illustrate this issue, let us limit our attention now mainly to Carnap and Reichenbach and ask after the interpretative issues with locating their work wholly within the context of empiricism. A number of scholars have argued in various ways that Carnap’s early philosophical work showed the strong influence of scientific neo-Kantianism of the Marburg school. While Carnap did believe that the Aufbau importantly differed from the neo-Kantian epistemology on offer in Germany in the 1910s and 1920s, we should not be surprised to find some major themes of that epistemology central to Carnap’s project. Among the debts to neo-Kantianism one can find in Carnap’s early work is the centrality of logic in the epistemology of the empirical sciences. For example, Ernst Cassirer’s understanding of the post-Kantian problem of knowledge indicated that what needed to be shown was how the intellectual constructions of logic and mathematics were precisely the basis upon which objective empirical knowledge of the world was built. It was in this way that Cassirer both secured the exact sciences of nature as the proper topic of epistemology and reoriented the business of epistemology to showing how the form of experience allowed the mathematically precise statement of natural laws.\n\nIn Carnap’s earliest work, starting from his dissertation, Der Raum (Carnap [1922] 2019), other philosophical and nonempiricist influences are just as clear. In the dissertation, Carnap speaks in Kantian language, calling our knowledge of the structure of intuitive space synthetic a priori knowledge. But his official account of the foundations of our knowledge of intuitive space is explicitly indebted to phenomenology; he explains our knowledge of intuitive space using Edmund Husserl’s notion of Wesensschau. In the Aufbau, there is no longer any need for Wesensschau, but arguably the naming of the overarching philosophical framework of the work “constitution theory” is a nod to the constitution theory of Husserl’s Ideen. We know that Carnap joined Husserl’s advanced seminar in phenomenology briefly between writing his dissertation and publishing the Aufbau; we know that the largest project within the Husserl circle at the time was the preparation of the second volume of Ideen; it would be surprising if nothing from that context played an important role in Carnap’s understanding of what he was doing.\n\nThe language that both Carnap and Reichenbach used to describe the lessons of the relativity theory in the early 1920s was Kantian. For Reference ReichenbachReichenbach (1920), the lesson to be learned was that Kant had conflated two notions of the synthetic a priori – “constitutive of the object of knowledge” and “necessary and universal.” Relativity theory had principles constitutive of the object of knowledge and, in this sense, the synthetic a priori had not only survived the shift to contemporary physics, but had also been clarified by that shift. What could no longer be endorsed was any sense of the synthetic a priori that made it universal, necessary, and unchanging. This “relativized a priori” is also on offer in Carnap’s dissertation, in his account of the structure of physical space. It had also been expressed in the epistemology of the exact sciences Cassirer provided in 1910 in his Substanzbegriff und Funktionsbegriff.\n\nIf we cast our intellectual nets even wider, we find a number of other philosophical and cultural influences on Carnap and Reichenbach’s early work that might well have left a lingering mark. Reichenbach, during his student days, was a socialist, a pacifist, and an activist within the Freistudenten movement in Berlin. Carnap also had a political background that included membership as a youth in the utopian nature society, the Wandervögel, and a lingering political-cum-philosophical commitment to a form of expressivism about philosophy influenced by his professors and ultimately by Wilhelm Dilthey’s Weltanschauungslehre. The political and cultural projects of the logical empiricists lingered into the era of the Vienna Circle. Neurath, Carnap, and Frank all lectured at the Dessau Bauhaus and claimed a kinship between logical empiricist philosophy and modern movements in art and architecture. Many of the logical empiricists also engaged in adult education at the Wiener Volkshochschule.\n\nWhat is the significance of these considerations? It is at least this: “empiricism” was a contested actors’ category for the logical empiricists. It can be deployed to understand their work only if we take for granted changes they themselves wrought in the notion of empiricism or if we speak at such a high level of abstraction that the detailed texture of the history of empiricism is no longer discernible. For Carnap and Reichenbach, the voyage to empiricism was a complicated one. It was not at all clear through the mid-1920s for the logical empiricists themselves that a plausible story existed that tied the methodological lessons of Poincaré and Einstein to any extant form of empiricism. As outlined previously, in the language of Reichenbach’s Philosophie der Raum-Zeit-Lehre (Reference ReichenbachReichenbach [1928] 1958), axioms of coordination are constitutive of the meanings of physical notions like “straightest line in space-time” in virtue of relating such notions to already well-defined mathematical structures. Those structures are themselves well behaved on logical grounds independently of experience, suggesting a robust notion of the mathematical a priori, and relating such structures to the facts of experience is what first makes objective physical science possible, which points to a lingering commitment to the methodological point – if not the vocabulary – of Kant’s synthetic a priori.\n\nNonetheless, by the time Reichenbach wrote that book, he and, more problematically, Carnap did think of themselves as empiricists. This is not a triumph of the standard story of logical empiricism, however, since that story gives us no purchase on how that could have happened. No empiricist epistemology available before logical empiricism can absorb the lessons of conventionalism very readily; nor was their work always motivated by an effort to find a version of empiricism that could absorb those lessons. That much was obvious to Carnap and Reichenbach in the early 1920s. In 1923, for example, while he was already at work on the Aufbau, the work Quine takes to the high-water mark of traditional empiricist epistemology, Carnap wrote an essay in which he declared that empiricism was a nonstarter as an epistemology of the exact sciences. This essay, entitled “On the Task of Physics and the Application of the Axiom of Simplicity,” begins:\n\nAfter a long period during which the question of sources of physical knowledge has been hotly disputed, it may now perhaps be said that pure empiricism has lost its dominance. That the construction of physics cannot rely solely on the results of experiments, but must use non-experiential principles, has of course been proclaimed by philosophy for some time now. But solutions that could satisfy the physicist resulted only after representatives of the exact sciences began to investigate the character of physical method, and arrived at a non-empiricist conception about it.\n\nIn that essay, the principle of simplicity is the non-experiential principle under discussion. That principle serves as a formal constraint on theory choice in Carnap’s account of physical methodology. The principle guides our sense of what is a proper scientific theory but is not itself grounded in experiment or experience. True to his own sense of the history of nonempiricist philosophy, Carnap’s main business in the essay is to try to come up with a mathematically precise version of the axiom of simplicity, one that could satisfy the mathematicians and the physicists. Reichenbach dealt with similar issues in his dissertation in 1916, which addressed a specifically Kantian concern: the necessity of mathematics in the objective representation of nature (Reference ReichenbachReichenbach [1916] 2008).\n\nIn order subsequently to think of himself as an empiricist, Carnap had to convince himself that he was wrong about the lessons of exact science in the early twentieth century, that he had a faulty understanding of empiricism, or that a rigorously defensible notion of empiricism had not yet been but could be formulated. He chose the last of these options. But this is as much as to say that for him, as for Reichenbach, the notion of empiricism is itself in flux and contested throughout the 1920s – and, in Carnap’s case at least, well into the 1930s. Thus “empiricist epistemology” is not a transparent explanatory frame within which to place their philosophical work. Empiricism itself had to change importantly in order for logical empiricism ultimately to be seen even by some of its practitioners as an empiricist philosophy. Any account of the significance of logical empiricism needs to take empiricism as itself an historical topic, not as an always already present philosophical framework.\n\nThe problems are similar for analytic philosophy as a frame for the account. Not least among the problems is the idea that analytic philosophy was a particularly friendly philosophical project for empiricism. None of the leading founders of analytic philosophy as we understand it today – Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, and Ludwig Wittgenstein – is obviously an empiricist in a classical sense. Frege, who was a professor of Carnap, was clearly opposed to a Kantian understanding of arithmetic but his logicist program did not support an empiricist account of arithmetic. He was withering in his criticisms of the empiricist account of arithmetic of J. S. Mill (Reference FregeFrege [1884] 1960). Moreover, Frege retained the language of the synthetic a priori in speaking about geometry and, after Russell’s criticisms of his version of the laws of logic, reintroduced such talk for arithmetic as well.\n\nRussell’s External World Program (Reference RussellRussell [1914] 1993), which sought, as Quine said, to account for the objects of physics as logical constructions of sense-data, sounds like an empiricist project. But, as Quine understood, whether and how it is an empiricist project depends upon the epistemological status of the logical tools Russell brings to bear in the project. On this matter, Russell is not clearly an empiricist. Very early, Russell, having disputed Kant’s understanding of mathematics as synthetic a priori knowledge by showing how to reduce all of mathematics to logic, ended up saying that logical principles are themselves synthetic a priori. Later he deployed his basic epistemological notion of acquaintance and claim that we are acquainted not just with sense-data (and concepts) but also with logical primitives. This idea of a direct rational acquaintance with logical primitives is distinctly nonempiricist, philosophically obscure, and antithetical to the accounts of logic for which the logical empiricists became famous.\n\nThe Vienna Circle famously read Wittgenstein’s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (Wittgenstein [1921] 1961) as a successor project to the Russell’s External World Project. Again, however, the question is whether the account of logic given in the Tractatus can plausibly be thought to be friendly to empiricism. The Tractatus itself is silent on that issue; the term “empiricism” is not found in the text. For Carnap, the Tractatus provides a large step in the direction of his later views – views he came to think of as empiricist – by suggesting that logical truth was in principle different from empirical truth not in being absolutely general (pertaining to everything), but in being, so to speak, encoded into language. Logic on this view is both content-free and operational. The road here is open to a view in which, again as Quine says, logic is vouchsafed as a priori because it says nothing about the world and that this account is an answer to the question of an account of the a priority of mathematics that an empiricist can embrace. Two questions remain for this as the road Carnap takes. First, can the view of logic be made sense of on its own terms? (And, of course, that it cannot is precisely Quine’s point in the analytic/synthetic debate.) Second, can logic so understood be made to do all the epistemic work that the logical empiricists see the formal doing to in methodology of empirical science? It is this second question and its complications that indicate to some that Carnap’s views of logic retain much of the transcendental flavor of neo-Kantian views. Logic, philosophy of logic, logical analysis, understandings of the virtues of philosophy that limits itself to such tools – all these are also in flux in Carnap’s work. Historically and hermeneutically, deploying an inchoate notion of “analytic philosophy” as a way to understand Carnap’s work is explanatorily inert: he was attempting to find a notion of logic or analysis that could play the philosophical role he needed it to play.\n\nThe point can be put plainly: there was no canonical analytic tradition available for the early logical empiricists to endorse circa 1920 or 1930. Insofar as analytic philosophy became a philosophical tradition, it became one in part in and through the development of logical empiricism itself. Logical empiricism is undoubtedly important for the history of empiricism and the history of analytic philosophy. We cannot, however, explain the development of logical empiricism by seeing it as the ever more clear expression of a fundamental drive among the logical empiricists to be empiricists or to be analytic philosophers. That is a sort of teleological history that trades in unclear philosophical notions that the logical empiricists claimed to abjure and that, I will argue, misrepresents the most fundamental philosophical purpose of their work, and most emphatically the work of Carnap and Reichenbach.\n\nThe larger frame within which I place logical empiricism comes directly from its own motivating literature: logical empiricism was, in its development, a series of episodes and projects within the history of scientific philosophy. Throughout their early motivational literature, the logical empiricists were largely united and at pains to offer up logical empiricism as a way to make philosophy scientific or to offer a scientific successor to philosophy, to introduce the intellectual standards of the sciences into the morass of philosophy. Despite all their differences of detail in both topic and method of philosophy, this point was held substantially in common. Moreover, in the first years of logical empiricism’s move to North America, it was received at least among some prominent American philosophers as a project in scientific philosophy. Within the North American context, it was only in the years after World War II that the story of logical empiricism was told more or less exclusively as an episode in an Anglo-American project of analytic philosophy.\n\nThe notion of a scientific philosophy that includes logical empiricism may sound odd to some philosophical ears. Some will think that whatever philosophy is or may be, it is not a science. Indeed, within the analytic context, it is mainly contemporary naturalists, who view themselves as far from logical empiricism, who think that philosophy either does or should take its place among the sciences. The broad disappearance of a scientific ambition for philosophy even within analytic philosophy, together with the sense that naturalistic scientific philosophy is a rejection of the central philosophical features of logical empiricism, are themselves aspects of the contemporary framework of analytic philosophy that cry out for historical explanation. For not a hundred years ago, many who came to be seen as founders of analytic philosophy and many other philosophers were united in seeking to make philosophy a scientifically responsible endeavor and offered several non-naturalistic alternatives.\n\nIn placing the history of logical empiricism within the framework of scientific philosophy, I am undertaking an historicist project, seeking to express the motivations and significance of the project in terms that its historical advocates took seriously. Historicism is also not good simply for its own sake. I believe, however, that this change in framework does real historical and philosophical work. In the next section, I further specify the larger project of scientific philosophy and develop aspects of the family of logical empiricist versions of it. In the final section, I use logical empiricism as scientific philosophy to reorient some philosophical and historical understandings of the development of twentieth-century philosophy.\n\nLogical Empiricism As Scientific Philosophy: Evidence and Background\n\nAny new account of the significance of logical empiricism needs to seek a more fundamental philosophical commitment within it than a commitment to empiricism or to analytic methods in philosophy or to specific doctrines associated with those commitments (verificationism, the linguistic doctrine of logical truth). It is for this reason that I introduced at the end of the previous section the notion of scientific philosophy. The interpretative idea is that the commitment to introduce scientific methods, goals, and processes within philosophy is the most fundamental joint commitment of the logical empiricists. We cannot expect too much of this interpretation – it would be ill conceived to attempt to reunify into a tidy intellectual package all the disparate elements that the new literature of the varieties of logical empiricism has brought to our scholarly attention. Nonetheless, there is no doubt that there was among the logical empiricists a sense of a unified movement, despite the differences of opinion they had on many – perhaps all – doctrinal matters. It is the business of this section to advance this interpretation and to argue that within the Austrian and German contexts where logical empiricism arose, scientific philosophy, not analytic philosophy, not positivism, not empiricism, is the most apposite framework for understanding the philosophical project of logical empiricism.\n\nBefore continuing, however, we must take a brief detour through a terminological issue that arises from the fact that the early work of the logical empiricists is written in German. The standard German word for science is Wissenschaft; this is the word the logical empiricists use to refer to science. Wissenschaft in German is a broader term than is the English word “science.” Thus, for example, the program of any humanities conference in Germany might well be called der wissenschaftliche Programm – the scientific program; it would never be called this in English. In general, any systematic study or body of knowledge is routinely called a Wissenschaft in German. Thus, when we attend to the use of Wissenschaft and wissenschaftlich and other cognate terms in German, we have to bear in mind that the term is more catholic in application.\n\nThis reminder is important because I will argue that the word Wissenschaft as employed in the early literature of the logical empiricists is more in line with the English usage of “science” than with the standard German usage. This desire for a stricter application of the term is indicated in the fact that when they are being careful about their terms, the logical empiricists (and others in the German-language philosophical world of the time) modify the word with adjectives such as streng or exakt – “strict” or “exact.” Such words indicate that what is at stake is the question of whether and how philosophy might be scientific in the sense of the most exact sciences, the paradigmatic formal and natural sciences, which for the logical empiricists were certainly mathematics and physics. The issue of whether philosophy can be a science, then, is not answered by pointing out that all the humanities disciplines are, after all, Wissenschaften in the standard usage of the German term. The question is whether philosophy can be a science in a way that makes it as strictly or exactly scientific as mathematics or physics.\n\nSome Evidence\n\nThe hortatory writings of the logical empiricists from the late 1920s and the early 1930s make clear that the primary purpose of the movement was to radically revise the practice and goals of philosophy so that it could participate in modern intellectual life and promote positive social values. This is evident whenever the logical empiricists pause from doing philosophy to discuss what they are doing as philosophers. Their remarks on this topic were clear and frequent. Philosophy had not managed to organize itself as a science; philosophers had not taken on the intellectual responsibility adopted by the scientist. Philosophy was, for these reasons, mired in fruitless debates in which personal opinions were presented as factual claims but lacked rational persuasiveness. There were no common standards, no common understanding of the vocabulary of philosophy. There was no way forward in philosophy without a radical reform motivated by and emulating the practices of those scientists who had made the clearest progress, mathematicians and physicists.\n\nThe Vienna Circle’s manifesto, Wissenschaftliche Weltauffassung, announced in its very title the point of view motivating the philosophical project on offer. The idea was to bring philosophy fully into an already existing, indeed widespread, scientific outlook upon the world. The manifesto argued that it was principally in philosophy and theology that an opposition to a scientific conception of the world was to be found. Thus, it was important not just for philosophy but for the fully rational functioning of society that a scientific philosophy be developed. More than this, the manifesto ascribed the rise of metaphysical theorizing in the postwar era precisely to the critical social and economic troubles of the times. At stake was the fully conscious acceptance of scientific modernity:\n\nThe increase in metaphysical and theologizing leanings which shows itself today in many associations and sects, in books and journals, in lectures and university courses, seems to be based on the fierce social and economic struggles of the present. One group of combatants, holding fast to traditional social forms, cultivates traditional attitudes of metaphysics and theology whose content has long since been superseded; while the other group, especially in central Europe, facing the new age, rejects these views and adopts empirical science as its basis.\n\nNeurath’s socialist leanings are clearly in view in such passages – the paragraph in fact ends with the claim that the scientific world conception was the most adequate expression of the down-to-earth empiricism and materialism of “the masses.” What is crucial is the conservative social role ascribed to metaphysical philosophy: metaphysics is inherently connected with outmoded social forms and institutions. This view was not simply strategic or based on a wish to find some connection between old philosophy and old social forms. As Reference RingerFritz Ringer (1969) and others have pointed out, academic philosophy had been important in the nineteenth century in the cementing of the German social and political order. This social role for philosophy was, just at the time of the Vienna Circle’s manifesto, being rethought and curtailed; part of the crisis of Germanophone philosophy after World War I was precisely over the role philosophy should play socially.\n\nAt the time in Germany and Austria, there was a robust alternative to scientific philosophy – Lebensphilosophie – philosophy of life or life philosophy. It is not easy to describe Lebensphilosophie in short compass but, as the name suggests, it was understood (at least by its advocates) as a form of philosophy devoted to living a good, proper, or authentic life. It was less concerned with philosophy as a body of doctrine or a method for acquiring knowledge than as a source of practical wisdom. This sort of philosophy was in most of its varieties understood to be a non- or even anti-rationalist movement. Reference SchelerMax Scheler ([1913] 2018) credited three thinkers as giving rise to Lebensphilosophie: Wilhelm Dilthey, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Henri Bergson. Bergson’s notion of intuitive metaphysics – a metaphysical insight into the being of a thing, as it were, from the inside – was clearly at issue in the manifesto even though Bergson’s name went unmentioned: “The view which attributes to intuition a superior and more penetrating power of knowing, capable of leading beyond the contents of sense experience and not to be confined by the shackles of conceptual thought – this view is rejected” (Reference Neurath, Carnap, Hahn, Stadler and UebelNeurath et al. ([1929] 2012, pp. 83–84). Indeed the joint insistence upon sensation as the material of all cognition – and thus empiricism – and logic as the conditions of rational thought was very much in opposition to a metaphysics based on intuition advanced by Bergson and adopted by some Lebensphilosophen. Carnap, for example, in the final part of his 1928 Logischer Aufbau (Reference CarnapCarnap [1928] 1961a, §182) rejects metaphysics as meaningless, having adopted, for the purposes of this argument, a Bergsonian understanding of metaphysics as thought inexpressible in symbols (Reference BergsonBergson [1903] 1999). The philosophical tropes and social concerns of Lebensphilosophie also give shape to the final paragraph of the Vienna Circle’s Aufruf, indicating that the goals of Lebensphilosophie are fulfilled more by scientific philosophy:\n\nThus, the scientific world conception is close to the life of the present … We are witnessing how the spirit of the scientific world-conception penetrates in growing measure the forms of personal and public life, of education, of child-rearing, of architecture, and how it helps shape economic and social life according to rational principles. The scientific world-conception serves life, and life embraces it.\n\nIt has become clear in recent scholarship that the connection drawn in the Wissenschaftlicher Weltauffassung between logical empiricism and other modernist movements in education, architecture, and so forth was not simply a matter of motivating rhetoric; it was a program of activity. Several Vienna Circle members were teachers in experimental educational settings such as the Vienna Hochschule, a generally socialist adult education project. Josef Frank, the brother of Philipp, was a leading modernist architect in Vienna. Several members of the Vienna Circle, including Feigl, Neurath, and Carnap, gave lectures at the Dessau Bauhaus. Neurath was throughout his life fervently involved in educational projects that incorporated what we would now call “new information technologies” such as his ISOTYPE method for the visual representation of scientific information. The same is true in Berlin of Hans Reichenbach and his activities on radio. Neurath was also an urban planner, museum curator, and, briefly, a minister for economic rationalization in the Soviet Republic of Bavaria. The Vienna Circle itself had a public outreach arm in the Ernst Mach Society, which sponsored public lectures on topics in science and scientific philosophy in Vienna. The manifesto makes plain that such activities are not add-ons but essential to the philosophy on offer:\n\nThe Vienna Circle does not rest content with collective work as a closed group. It is also trying to make contact with the active movements of the present, insofar as they are well disposed toward the scientific world-conception and turn away from metaphysics and theology … The Vienna Circle believes that in collaborating with the Ernst Mach Society it fulfills a demand of the day: we have to fashion intellectual tools for everyday life, for the daily life of the scholar but also for the daily life of all those who in some way join in working at the conscious reshaping of life. The vitality that shows itself in the efforts for a rational transformation of the social and economic order, permeates the movement for a scientific world-conception also.\n\nIn other passages in which the logical empiricists sought to motivate their project, the focus is mainly on the internal reshaping of the discipline of philosophy. The logical empiricists had a diagnosis of the lack of intellectual authority from which philosophy suffered. It stemmed from an improper understanding of the nature of knowledge production. Philosophy had always, especially in metaphysical ages, been understood as the expression of a sort of personal genius or special wisdom of the individual philosopher. In this philosophy was more like poetry or other creative arts than like science – yet philosophy, unlike poetry or art, wished to present itself as a form of knowledge. What philosophy needed to do to fulfill its ambitions was to have a different model of the epistemic agent, a model taken from the proper operation of the scientific research community. This piecemeal collaborative aspect of the new scientific philosophy is the most important point that Carnap makes in the introduction to his Aufbau. When joined into a genuine research community, philosophers behave differently and can expect more lasting results:\n\nThe individual no longer undertakes to erect in one bold stroke an entire system of philosophy. Rather, each works at his special place with the one unified science. For the physicist and the historian this orientation is commonplace, but in philosophy we witness the spectacle (which must be depressing to a person of scientific orientation) that one after another and side by side a multiplicity of incompatible philosophical systems is erected. If we allot to the individual in philosophical work as in the special sciences only a partial task, then we can look forward with more confidence into the future: in slow careful construction insight after insight will be won.\n\n(Reference CarnapCarnap ([1928] 1961a, pp. xvi–xvii)\n\nFor Hans Reichenbach, in 1929, the very idea that philosophers engaged in something properly called “research” was new and bold, an indication that such philosophy had taken its stand within the special scientific disciplines. He too argued that this stance differed in principle from a social organization around a few great figures in the history of philosophy – or around a single philosophy professor in a German university. Such a philosophy of schools or movements – such as an early twentieth-century configuration of German philosophy into various sects of neo-Kantians or neo-Hegelians – was antithetical to proper epistemic functioning. Such an organization of philosophy was, for Reichenbach, a sort of “unproductive epigonism the sight of which must repel anyone who works in the stimulating atmosphere of the sciences and who has even once looked at contemporary philosophy from this vantage point” (Reference Reichenbach and ReichenbachReichenbach [1929] 1978, p. 250).\n\nThis rhetoric is perhaps surprising, since the Wissenschaftliche Weltauffassung was written in celebration of Schlick’s decision to remain in Vienna rather than take up the chair in philosophy at Bonn. Similarly, the decision to name the public wing of Vienna Circle activities after Mach might suggest a mere school of thought – a group of neo-Machians to add to the neo-Kantians, neo-Friesians, and all the rest. In the case of Mach and the Verein Ernst Mach, the manifesto is explicit: “By the choice of its name, the society wishes to describe its basic orientation: science free of metaphysics. This, however, does not mean that the society declares itself to be in programmatic agreement with the individual doctrines of Mach” (Reference Neurath, Carnap, Hahn, Stadler and UebelNeurath et al. [1929] 2012, p. 81). This message had been underscored already in the text by the enormous array of influences listed earlier in the first section of the work – in all the names of more than forty scientists and philosophers are mentioned, stretching from Epicurus into then contemporary technical work in mathematics and physics as well as empiricist sociology.\n\nThe case of Schlick as potential leader of a school is the more interesting one. The manifesto always placed Schlick first among equals. The manifesto was written for Schlick and Schlick was the center of the Circle, but it was the Vienna Circle, not the Schlick Circle, and its existence as informal entity was not so much due to Schlick as the reason Schlick decided to stay. The manifesto states that when Schlick decided “after some vacillation” to stay in Vienna:\n\nFor the first time it became clear to him and to us that there is such a thing as the “Vienna Circle” of the scientific world-conception, which continues to develop this mode of thought in a collaborative effort. This circle has no rigid organization; it consists of people who have the same basic scientific attitude. Here the individual endeavors to fit in, everyone emphasizes that which unites, and no one wishes to disturb idiosyncratically the cohesion of the group.\n\nFor his part and as we have seen, Schlick, when called upon to write a programmatic lead essay in the first issue of Erkenntnis, the new house journal of logical empiricism, in 1930, also stressed the adoption of a universal and scientifically acceptable method as the key to the new project in philosophy that the journal endeavored to promote. This, for Schlick, was, as the title of the essay indicated, a “turning point” in philosophy, and indeed precisely a turning away from schools and thus from “the fruitless conflict of systems” (Reference Schlick and AyerSchlick [1930] 1959, p. 54).\n\nThe point of emphasizing the programmatic commitment of logical empiricism to scientific philosophy is not to say that the logical empiricists, by and large, were not committed also to logical analysis or to positivism or to empiricism. It is to say that notions like positivism, empiricism, and, indeed, logic were themselves taken by many of the logical empiricists to be obscure philosophical terms that needed, as an element of philosophy becoming scientific, to be given a clear meaning or, should that not be possible, to be set aside. “Science” was not, however, an obscure philosophical term – it was a term of everyday usage and what disciplines were sciences in the strictest sense could be fairly easily agreed upon. Moreover, although exactly how those sciences achieved their epistemic success was an epistemological question for logical empiricism, that those sciences had achieved such successes could be, so the logical empiricists believed, taken for granted – those practices could only be understood internally in a suitably scientific logic or philosophy of science. So it was a presupposition of the program that the sciences of physics and mathematics had achieved an unparalleled level of epistemic success and thus, to become scientific, philosophy should emulate them somehow. On the methodological front, analysis was not promoted simply because it was analysis, but because the status of logic as the framework within which formalized science was already being done. There could be no doubt that logical analysis occurred in the exact sciences. Hilbertian axiomatization of geometry, the Frege–Russell reduction of mathematics to logic, Einstein’s account of simultaneity of events at a distance – all of these were understood to be logical analyses within the exact sciences. “Analysis” itself, especially if modified with a philosophical term like “epistemological” and contrasted with “psychological,” would need some clearing up. But, among the reasons why the exact sciences were exact was that they dealt with precise concepts and they did so as a result of logical analysis – this too was presupposed and thematized in the work of the logical empiricists.\n\nEmphasizing this programmatic commitment does not reintroduce a false interpretative unanimity among the logical empiricists. After all, the commitment is at such a high level that disagreements could – and did – break out at any of several different points. The logical empiricists disagreed about how to account for the success of the exact sciences themselves. They disagreed about the nature of analysis and about the range of application of the formal tools of logic. They disagreed about the properly scientific replacement of empiricist epistemology and about the relation of that project to psychology. They disagreed about how precisely to reject metaphysics and about what exactly was rejected when one did. They disagreed over the very term “scientific philosophy,” which was one of many terms Neurath unequivocally rejected (since it did, after all, include the word “philosophy”). But stressing the joint commitment to making philosophy scientific both allows these disagreements to be structured in an illuminating way and indicates how the disagreements neither proceeded without limit nor needed to disrupt the unity of the movement. This is because the commitment to scientific philosophy amounted to a commitment to certain norms of philosophical activity and to the use of certain methods and tools in philosophical research. As the manifesto stated: “The scientific world-conception is characterized not so much by theses of its own, but rather by its basic attitude, its points of view and direction of research” (Reference Neurath, Carnap, Hahn, Stadler and UebelNeurath et al. [1929] 2012, p. 81).\n\nThere are many questions, therefore, that a mere commitment to making philosophy scientific does not answer but that any version of scientific philosophy must ultimately decide upon. If philosophy is to be one science among many, then presumably it differs from other sciences in virtue of its topic, its objects of study. What, then, is the proper topic of scientific philosophy? What methods are appropriate to a science with such a topic and what vouchsafes the scientific status of such a method? Also, there are the issues involved with any attempt radically to reform a field of human intellectual endeavor – how can we vouchsafe that a philosophy made scientific is still properly philosophy? The scientific philosophy of the logical empiricists had answers to all these questions, answers on which there was broad but not full agreement among the logical empiricists. We shall examine their answers beginning in the final portion of this section, but first we must examine another virtue that interpreting logical empiricism as an episode in scientific philosophy has: the scientific status of philosophy was an important metaphilosophical issue in German and Austrian academic philosophy for about three-quarters of a century before the announcement of the logical empiricist version of scientific philosophy. Moreover, the issue had come pointedly to a head in the critical cultural climate of the period after World War I in the defeated German-speaking lands. We shall look at just one other example of this dynamic.\n\nScientific Philosophy in Germany and Austria in the Twentieth Century\n\nThere is a history that goes right through to at least the middle of the nineteenth century of concerns about the Wissenschaftlichkeit of philosophy within the German and Austrian philosophical communities. This history is long and complicated. It involves varying sensibilities about what Wissenschaftlichkeit is, what virtues a scientific philosophy would have and what vices it would avoid, what alternative models for philosophy and philosophical activity there are, and so on. We clearly do not have the space or patience for much of that history here. But it is useful briefly to cover some aspects of the issues as they were discussed more widely within the generation from which the nascent logical empiricists learned philosophy and among some of their prominent contemporaries.\n\nIn the generation before the rise of logical empiricism, German scientific philosophy had many varieties, including the positivism of Ernst Mach and Richard Avenarius, various neo-Kantianisms but especially those advanced by the Marburg school, and the sociological empiricism of Ferdinand Tönnies. But, in the years just before World War I, perhaps the most important call for scientific philosophy came from Husserl on behalf of phenomenology. In 1911, Husserl wrote an long essay for the journal Logos entitled “Philosophie als strenge Wissenschaft [Philosophy As Rigorous Science]” (Reference Husserl and HusserlHusserl [1911] 1965). Husserl too attacked the lack of scientific credibility of philosophical systems hitherto. This leads immediately to a question: “For with this blunt emphasis on the unscientific character [Unwissenschaftlichkeit] of all prior philosophy, the question immediately arises whether philosophy is to continue envisioning the goal of being a rigorous science, whether it can or must want to be so” (Reference Husserl and HusserlHusserl [1911] 1965, p. 65). Husserl’s answer is that philosophy must be a science if it is to be anything at all. He too lays much of the blame for its lack of scientific credibility on a mistaken notion of philosophical genius, leading to systems that ultimately are kept in a “silent museum of history” instead of providing a foundation for future philosophical work. To rectify this, there needs to be a reorientation of philosophical understanding of the epistemic virtues of the philosopher, who, says Husserl, works in an “impersonal” science and thus needs “not wisdom, but theoretical talent” (Reference Husserl and HusserlHusserl [1911] 1965, p. 149).\n\nHusserl’s chief contribution to scientific philosophy is not the originality of the arguments he deploys against earlier unwissenschaftliche philosophy. It is, rather, in his enunciation of a radical alternative vision of what science philosophy properly was. Husserl insisted that phenomenology was so new that most philosophers had no concept of it. And what was phenomenology? It was a science of pure consciousness:\n\nA science of consciousness that is still not psychology, a phenomenology of consciousness as opposed to a natural science about consciousness … Psychology is concerned with “empirical consciousness,” with consciousness from the empirical point of view, as empirical being in the ensemble of nature, whereas phenomenology is concerned with “pure” consciousness.\n\nHusserl’s job as a phenomenologist, then, was both to clarify what this “pure consciousness” is and to develop methods appropriate to a science of it. Indeed, these methods are the best way to develop the account of pure consciousness, since pure consciousness is revealed in and through the method of epochê, which allows the bracketing of content of mental activity and the revealing of the pure act. We cannot develop the account of phenomenology in any detail here. What matters in this context is the clarity of Husserl’s insistence that phenomenology was scientific, indeed rigorously so. He too offered his new account of the project of philosophy as a way to introduce scientifically acceptable methods into philosophy and to achieve scientifically respectable results in philosophy.\n\nThe defeat of the German and Austrian empires in World War I induced a deep cultural, intellectual crisis in those countries. There was an important reaction against what was understood to be a pristine and ultimately failed reliance on rationality in the German-speaking world. Oswald Spengler’s The Decline of the West (Reference SpenglerSpengler [1918/1922] 1991) was only the most successful of a series of attacks on the scientific culture of Germany. These attacks led to the rise in metaphysical and theological thinking to which we have already seen the logical empiricists, in the late 1920s, giving attention; it was also the reason for the flowering of Lebensphilosophie. Among its many consequences, the new era led to a radical reformation of phenomenology as Heidegger repudiated Husserl’s insistence that phenomenology was scientific philosophy.\n\nThroughout the 1920s, Heidegger often explained his philosophical work by relating it to science. For example, Heidegger began his 1925 lecture course at Marburg with a lengthy discussion of the movement of scientific philosophy. In this history, he gives pride of place to phenomenology and thus to the figures of Franz Brentano, Wilhelm Dilthey, and Husserl. But the way he expresses himself also shows clear debts to the neo-Kantians with whom he had studied. The following long quotation gives a clear sense of the newness and promise of scientific philosophy – and indicates how he saw his own work as within this tradition:\n\nTo summarize: In the middle of the nineteenth century a well-defined scientific philosophy gained prevalence. The expression “scientific philosophy” has a threefold sense. This philosophy characterized itself as scientific:\n\n1. Because it is a philosophy of the sciences, that is, because it is a theory of scientific knowledge, because it has as its actual object the fact of science.\n\n2. Because by way of this inquiry into the structure of already given science it secures its own theme that it investigates in accordance with its own method, while it itself no longer lapses into the domain of reflection characteristic of the particular sciences. It is “scientific” because it acquires its own domain and its own method. At the same time, the method maintains its security by its constant orientation to the factual content of the sciences themselves. Speculation aimed at world views is thereby avoided.\n\n3. Because it seeks to give a foundation to the various disciplines that are directed toward consciousness through an original science of consciousness itself, a psychology.\n\n(Reference HeideggerHeidegger [1925] 1985, pp. 18–19)\n\nBy placing his work within a tradition of scientific philosophy only extant since the middle of the nineteenth century, Heidegger was able to thematize philosophically the fact of science and offer a version of a phenomenology of consciousness. His work also reacted against the speculative excesses that damaged philosophy’s scientific credibility.\n\nAll this began to change after Being and Time was published in 1927. As he moved from phenomenology to fundamental ontology, Heidegger also readopted the older understanding of science as a systematic body of knowledge – precisely what Husserl’s insistence on strenge Wissenschaftlichkeit was meant to indicate was not sufficient. Thus Heidegger argued in his Basic Problems of Phenomenology that there was nothing of real interest in scientific philosophy, since “that philosophy is scientific is implied by its very concept” (Reference HeideggerHeidegger [1927] 1982, p. 12). Indeed, philosophy has always and everywhere attempted to be science, indeed a particular science, ontology: “It can be shown historically that at bottom all the great philosophies since antiquity more or less explicitly took themselves to be, and as such sought to be, ontology” (Heidegger [1929] 1982, p. 12). Only by adopting a broad and ancient notion of science – not the notion of science that the scientific philosophers contrasted with the merely systematic and that thus made the scientific status of philosophy worth arguing about – could Heidegger hope to pull off the feat of demonstrating that all the great philosophies sought to be a science of being. Indeed, although Heidegger continued to use the phrase “wissenschaftliche Philosophie” in the introductory sections of Basic Problems, he argued that the phrase was redundant; scientific philosophy was simply philosophy per se. In his Einleitung in die Philosophie, a collection of lecture notes from 1928 to 1929 at Freiburg, he analogized the term “scientific philosophy” to the term “round circle,” a simple spelling out of a concept (Reference HeideggerHeidegger [1928/1929] 1996, pp. 16–18).\n\nAs the point of contention motivating the scientific philosophers, including Husserl and Heidegger’s own younger self, began to slip away, ontology or metaphysics began, in Heidegger’s work, to show something more: metaphysics indicates the way in which philosophy goes deeper than mere science. By raising the problem of Dasein and its relations to Nothing, metaphysics passes beyond all special scientific rigor. Metaphysics raises the existential question of being; metaphysics is authentic existence. As he writes in his 1929 essay, “Was ist Metaphysik?”: “No amount of scientific rigor attains to the seriousness of metaphysics. Philosophy can never be measured by the standard of the idea of science” (Reference Heidegger and HeideggerHeidegger [1929] 1977, p. 112). Phenomenology had become entirely philosophically inverted – having begun as a way to secure the strictly scientific nature of philosophy, it had, in Heidegger’s hands, by 1930, instead been used to show that philosophy was intrinsically other and more serious than exact science.\n\nScientific Philosophy and Analytic Philosophy\n\nThe range of German and Austrian scientific philosophies, including versions of empiricism, neo-Kantianism, and phenomenology (and the list could be extended), reaches well beyond the scope of what we now consider to be the founders, in the German context, of analytic philosophy. Indeed, Gottlob Frege, the German “founder” of analytic philosophy par excellence, who was a mathematician, did not have well-worked-out views on the scientific status of philosophy. The intellectual status of philosophy was not a major concern of his.\n\nIt is of interest, though, that of the three “leading representatives of the scientific world conception” listed at the end of the Wissenschaftliche Weltauffassung, two were Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein (Reference Neurath, Carnap, Hahn, Stadler and UebelNeurath et al. [1929] 2012, pp. 108–111). (The third was Albert Einstein.) The case of Wittgenstein is, as one might expect, vexed. It is hard to read various pronouncements of the one published piece of philosophy he had published by 1929 – his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus – as calling for a scientific philosophy. Indeed, one might well think that the case for Wittgenstein as scientific philosopher is ruled out explicitly in 4.111, when Wittgenstein writes, simply enough: “Philosophy is not one of the natural sciences. (The word ‘philosophy’ must mean something whose place is above or below the natural sciences, but not beside them.)” (Reference WittgensteinWittgenstein [1921] 2001)\n\nWittgenstein’s use of the term “natural sciences” here should not mislead us. He is not saying or suggesting that philosophy is a social or cognitive science. Indeed, in 4.1121, he says as much regarding psychology, which he is happy to call a natural science: “Psychology is no more closely related to philosophy than any other natural science.”\n\nNothing about Wittgenstein or his relationship to the Vienna Circle is simple, however, and between these two statements, Wittgenstein endorses a view that becomes a central component of the scientific philosophy that the logical empiricists endorsed. What is not clear is whether this view is an endorsement of scientific philosophy in Wittgenstein’s own work:\n\n4.1121 Philosophy aims at the logical clarification of thoughts.\n\nPhilosophy is not a body of doctrine but an activity.\n\nA philosophical work consists essentially of elucidations.\n\nPhilosophy does not result in “philosophical propositions,” but rather in the clarification of propositions.\n\nWithout philosophy thoughts are, as it were, cloudy and indistinct: its task is to make them clear and to give them sharp boundaries.\n\nIn some versions of logical empiricism from the late 1920s onward, this account of philosophy is substantially endorsed. In logical empiricism, this is a way of making philosophy scientific – philosophy becomes a logical method of clarifying propositions, which all properly belong to science. Philosophy is the process of clarifying the propositions of science and of distinguishing them from the pseudo-propositions of metaphysics; it is not the science of another realm of properly philosophical objects or facts. The result of logical analysis is then a fully clarified science and nothing else – but this process is already to be seen in scientific work; philosophy extends scientific work in this way. In the very process of clarification, the pseudo-problems of metaphysics drop out. This seems to be the position of Wittgenstein’s antepenultimate section:\n\n6.53 The correct method of philosophy would really be the following: to say nothing except what can be said, i.e. propositions of natural science – i.e. something that has nothing to do with philosophy – and then, whenever someone else wanted to say something metaphysical, to show him that he had failed to give a meaning to certain signs in his propositions. Although it would not be satisfying to the other person – he would not have the feeling that we were teaching him philosophy – this method would be the one strictly correct one.\n\nWhile we cannot hope to unravel all the mysteries of Wittgenstein’s text, the question regarding his own understanding of such claims and how the logical empiricists understood them reduces, one might say, to what “has nothing to do with philosophy” means here. For the logical empiricists, it is clear that all that can be said is the propositions of science and there is no additional field called philosophy that offers more propositions about its own realm of objects. Wittgenstein’s views invite, especially in light of his discussions of the “unsayable” or “the mystical” at the end of the Tractatus, an interpretation that there is something beyond, in some sense, what can be said in science. This beyond can be gestured at or pointed to – shown – in philosophy and it is more important than the limits of what can be said. Just before 6.53, for example, Wittgenstein writes this in 6.522: “There are, indeed, things that cannot be put into words. They make themselves manifest. They are what is mystical.” All this seems antithetical to logical empiricism.\n\nWhatever Wittgenstein’s ultimate disposition in matters pertaining to scientific philosophy, one founder of analytic philosophy who is central to the vision of philosophy in logical empiricism and who did advocate, unequivocally, for scientific philosophy was Bertrand Russell. The complete title of his 1914 Lowell Lectures was Our Knowledge of the External World As a Field for Scientific Method in Philosophy (Reference RussellRussell [1914] 1993). As the title indicates, the main object of the book was to illustrate how a philosophy using a properly scientific method would look; the problem of our knowledge of a world external to our minds is one topic to which that method is applied, but it is illustrated via other topics such as infinity and continuity and causation and free will. The properly scientific method for philosophy on offer in the book is the “logical-analytical method in philosophy.” This method he assigns to Frege as the founder, and it is best exemplified, of course, in the enormous work he and Alfred North Whitehead did in attempting to extend Frege’s work and derive all of mathematics from the principles of logic.\n\nThroughout the book, Russell was insistent that this new method is but the scientific method applied to logic conceived as a science of the possible. He too despairs of progress in philosophy in the absence of a generally agreed-upon method for achieving solid results. He ascribes the particular crisis of intellectual authority that philosophy is suffer"
