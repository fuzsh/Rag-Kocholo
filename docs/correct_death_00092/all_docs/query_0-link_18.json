They were sitting in the bow. I took little Freddy Fickbohm on the top deck to show him the points of interest. We were approaching the island when, looking forward, I saw flames shooting up from the deck below. Unclasping my knife, I slashed at the fastenings of the life rafts nearby. But, they were secured by wire instead of rope. I told Freddy to stay with me, but when I returned he has disappeared. I then started for my party but was driven back by the flames.\n\nThe whole front part of the boat by this time was a mass of fire. For the time being, so near were we to shore that there was no panic. The passengers, mostly women and children, retreated before the flames. All thought that the boat would put into shore at once, but it seemed fully five minutes or more before she swung inshore. By this time, the scene was terrifying. Women threw their children overboard and then followed. They had no other refuge from the flames, which swept everything before them.\n\nI rushed aft, calling to my wife, but I could not see her, and in the roar of the fire and the cries of the panic-stricken passengers, she could not hear me. I was driven back to the wheelhouse by the fire. I thought I was trapped. There was no chance for me to go farther aft, and below was the fire.\n\nI threw myself over the railing and dropped into the water on the side farthest from land. It was then I received these burns. The water came only to my armpits, and I could have walked to the shore. When I finally emerged, I looked back and to my dying day I'll never forget the scene. Around me were scores of bodies, most of them charred and burned. I helped as many as possible of those living to the land. From the stern of the boat, where hundreds of persons were huddled fighting like mad to leap into the water, I saw dozens of women throw themselves over the side.\n\nI searched in vain for my wife. Body after body was laid out on the shore, but hers was not among them. Then someone said that a party of women and children had been sent to the city, and a neighbor told me my wife was among them.*\n\n*Amelia died in the Slocum disaster.\n\nFickbohm ⚰ ⚰ ⚰ ⚰ ☁\n\nCity Record: Fickbohm 91 Ave D.

(Only his wife and daughter were listed among the Slocum dead under the name Bandelow.) In December 1904 William Bandelow a clothing cutter of 87 7th street Manhattan was still seeking in vain for his son, George. He had lost his wife and little girl in the burning ship. However, he held out hope that his son had been rescued by and elderly woman who owned property at Liberty and Wynona streets. He offered a $100 reward. He spent days putting up posters with the picture of George and relating the supposed rescue of his son by the unknown woman. It was stated he did not know his wife had decided at the last minute to go on the excursion. He had returned home around noon on the 15th to find his house deserted. After hearing of the disaster he was able to identify his wife who had been burned to death and his daughter who had drown. They were buried side by side. He was unable to identify his son among any of the numerous children's bodies at the morgue. He claimed that he was fairly sure he could identify his son by his teeth. He hired men to dredge for the body and divers to search for it. Some months later Captain Berg of the United States Volunteer Life Saving Corps informed William Bandelow that he had helped rescue a boy of the age and description of young George and had put him ashore at Oak Point. William Bandelow started his hunt anew this time in the area of Oak Point, an area in the Bronx not far from Brother's Island. Even later William Bandelow's sister-in-law met a woman, a Mrs. Mary Ryan, who told her that she had met an elderly woman with a young boy that she had supposedly found wandering in the streets the day of the disaster. The elderly woman had asked the child his name but he was unable to tell her. Assuming that the child's parents had perished in the calamity she had taken the boy home to her own house. She said she owned property at Liberty and Wynona streets. Mrs. Ryan said the boy met the exact description of young George Bandelow. From that point on William Bandelow focused on finding the elderly lady with the young golden haired boy. George was described as: three years and nine months old, 38 inches tall, blue eyes, curly blond hair, upper teeth short broad and decayed, bottom teeth short, narrow and perfect, strawberry birthmark on left breast, and a large brown mole on his back, wearing a gold chased band ring on middle finger of left hand. When last seen he was wearing navy blue velvet Russian blouse, bloomer pants, a coat with four large white pearl buttons, white leather belt, blue flannel Norfolk shirt waist with white pearl buttons, white flannel drawers, black stockings, and garters and black lace shoes. William Bandelow's family was buried in evergreen Cemetery. This story popped up throughout July, August and September 1904 and was carried in several papers cross the county. In August William Bandlow went to Providence in the vain hope of finding his son. A story with an image of the boy was carried as late as December 1904.\n\n1908: William Bandelow married Anna Sobiechowska\n\n1910: Greenwich ave., William F Bandelow 38, 2nd marriage, cutter, cl----s Anna M Bandelow 37, first marriage, no children\n\n1915: Pierpont ave Bronx William Bandelow 44, born Germany, pattern maker, Annie Bandelow 42, born Germany\n\n1930: Manhattan, no address indicated, William Bandelow 58, head, born Germany, pattern maker, ladies clothing, Anna M Bandelow 57, wife, born Poland, Helena Metka 62, lodger\n\nWilliam Bandelow and his wife, Anna, traveled to Europe several times in the 1910s, 1920s, 1930s and 1940s.\n\n1960: William Bandelow born August 30, 1871 in Germany resident of 472 Brook Ave Bronx New York, died July 9, 1960 at 51 Elbestrasse Frankfurt am Main, of heart infraction.

Bertrand was born in New York City, January 26, 1884, a son of the late Charles A. and Elizabeth Bertrand. On his father's side he is of French descent, being a great great grandson of Count Henri Gratien Bertrand, one of the generals of Napoleon I and one of the Emperor's most loyal supporters. The first member of the family to come to this country was Mr. Bertrand's grandfather, who settled in the United States in 1858. His son, Mr. Bertrand's father, was for many years successfully engaged in the trucking business and also was over a very long period of years a power in local politics, having been a staunch supporter of the Democratic party and at one time a member of the New York State Senate. He died in 1916, having been predeceased by Mrs. Bertrand, who was one of the unfortunate victims, June 15, 1904, of the disaster which befell the Steamship \"General Slocum\" in the East River.\"\n\nEDWARD J.
