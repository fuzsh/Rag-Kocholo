Printed inscription on recto, 'August Brasch Leipzig Lindenstrasse No.7.'. Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach (1824-1889) was a Germanbotanist and ornithologist. He became an expert on orchids, widely regarded as leading expert on the subject after the death of John Lindley. Frederick Sander compiled the massive work 'Reichenbachia' in his honour. He dictated in his will that his orchid collections would not be examined for 25 years after his death; it is generally assumed that this was an intended blow at his rival, F. A. Rolfe, but the consequence was that by the time Reichenbach's collections were examined, most of the work they could have stimulated had already been done elsewhere._x000D_\n\nHis father was Heinrich Gottlieb Ludwig von Reichenbach, also a botanist and ornithologist, and with whom he assisted with the publication of 'Icones Florae Germanicae'..
