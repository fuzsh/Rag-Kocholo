        "text": "My dear Lindley\n\nI am infinitely obliged for your letter, answering everything so clearly & so fully.—\n\nDo not read enclosed without you like, I send it on mere chance of being new to you.—\n\nI shd. be most grateful for any orchids (especially Dendrobium) in flower & bud : if it be a small parcel tin cannister best way by Post, & you must let me repay postage: if too large, address.\n\nC. Darwin | care of Down Postman | Bromley | Kent per Railway\n\nI terribly want any one of your “Arethuseæ.”\n\nMr James Veitch has been most generous; I did not know that you had spoken to him: if you see him pray say I am truly grateful. I dare not write to a live Bishop or a Lady; but if I knew the address of “Rucker”?? & might use your name as introduction I would write. I am half mad on subject.— Hooker has sent me many exotics; but I stopped him, for I thought I shd. make a fool of myself; but since I have determined to publish, I much regret it.\n\nI will not trouble you for the Books, for systematic works are out of my line.—\n\nHooker is trying to buy Reichenbach on the pollen & if he gets it will lend me, for it is in no public Library & I do not suppose would be worth my buying.\n\nWith cordial thanks for your great kindness.—\n\nYours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin"
