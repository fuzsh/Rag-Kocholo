        "text": "As a rule, the point of departure for unified field theory was general relativity. The additional task then was to ‘geometrize’ the electromagnetic field. In this review, we will encounter essentially five different ways to include the electromagnetic field into a geometric setting:\n\nby connecting an additional linear form to the metric through the concept of “gauging” (Weyl);\n\nby introducing an additional space dimension (Kaluza);\n\nby choosing an asymmetric Ricci tensor (Eddington);\n\nby adding an antisymmetric tensor to the metric (Bach, Einstein);\n\nby replacing the metric by a 4-bein field (Einstein).\n\nIn order to bring some order into the wealth of these attempts towards “unified field theory,” I shall distinguish four main avenues extending general relativity, according to their mathematical direction: generalisation of\n\ngeometry,\n\ndynamics (Lagrangians, field equations),\n\nnumber field, and\n\ndimension of space,\n\nas well as their possible combinations. In the period considered, all four directions were followed as well as combinations between them like e.g., five-dimensional theories with quadratic curvature terms in the Lagrangian. Nevertheless, we will almost exclusively be dealing with the extension of geometry and of the number of space dimensions.\n\n2.1 Geometry\n\nIt is very easy to get lost in the many constructive possibilities underlying the geometry of unified field theories. We briefly describe the mathematical objects occurring in an order that goes from the less structured to the more structured cases. In the following, only local differential geometry is taken into accountFootnote 26.\n\nThe space of physical events will be described by a real, smooth manifold MD of dimension D coordinatised by local coordinates xi, and provided with smooth vector fields X, Y, … with components Xi, Yi, … and linear forms ω, ν, …, (ωi, νi) in the local coordinate system, as well as further geometrical objects such as tensors, spinors, connectionsFootnote 27. At each point, D linearly independent vectors (linear forms) form a linear space, the tangent space (cotangent space) of MD. We will assume that the manifold MD is space- and time-orientable. On it, two independent fundamental structural objects will now be introduced.\n\n2.2 Metrical structure\n\nThe first is a prescription for the definition of the distance ds between two infinitesimally close points on MD, eventually corresponding to temporal and spatial distances in the external world. For ds, we need positivity, symmetry in the two points, and the validity of the triangle equation. We know that ds must be homogeneous of degree one in the coordinate differentials dxi connecting the points. This condition is not very restrictive; it still includes Finsler geometry [281, 126, 224] to be briefly touched, below.\n\nIn the following, ds is linked to a non-degenerate bilinear form g(X, Y), called the first fundamental form; the corresponding quadratic form defines a tensor field, the metrical tensor, with D2 components gij such that\n\n$$ ds = \\sqrt {{g_{ij}}d{x^i}d{x^j}} , $$\n\n((1))\n\nwhere the neighbouring points are labeled by xi and xi+dxi, respectivelyFootnote 28. Besides the norm of a vector \\(\\left| X \\right|: = \\sqrt {{g_{ij}}{X^i}{X^j}}\\), the “angle” between directions X, Y can be defined by help of the metric:\n\n$$ \\cos (\\angle (X,Y)): = \\frac{{{g_{ij}}{X^i}{Y^j}}}{{\\left| X \\right|\\left| Y \\right|}}. $$\n\nFrom this we note that an antisymmetric part of the metrical tensor does not influence distances and norms but angles.\n\nWith the metric tensor having full rank, its inverse gik is defined throughFootnote 29\n\n$$ {g_{mi}}{g^{mj}} = \\delta _i^j $$\n\n((2))\n\nWe are used to g being a symmetric tensor field, i.e., with gik=g(ik) and with only D(D+1)/2 components; in this case the metric is called Riemannian if its eigenvalues are positive (negative) definite and Lorentzian if its signature is ±(D−2)Footnote 30. In the following this need not hold, so that the decomposition obtainsFootnote 31:\n\n$$ {g_{ij}} = {\\gamma _{(ik)}} + {\\phi _{\\left[ {ik} \\right]}}. $$\n\n((3))\n\nAn asymmetric metric was considered in one of the first attempts at unifying gravitation and electromagnetism after the advent of general relativity.\n\nFor an asymmetric metric, the inverse\n\n$$ {g_{ij}} = {h^{(ik)}} + {f^{[ik]}} = {h^{ik}} + {f^{ik}} $$\n\n((4))\n\nis determined by the relations\n\n$$ \\begin{array}{*{20}{l}} {{\\gamma _{ij}}{\\gamma ^{ik}} = \\delta _j^k,}&{\\;\\;\\;{\\phi _{ij}}{\\phi ^{ik}} = \\delta _j^k,\\;\\;\\;}&{{h_{ij}}{h^{ik}} = \\delta _j^k,\\;\\;\\;}&{{f_{ij}}{f^{ik}} = \\delta _j^k,} \\end{array} $$\n\n((5))\n\nand turns out to be [356]\n\n$$ {h^{(ik)}} = \\frac{\\gamma }{g}{\\gamma ^{ik}} + \\frac{\\phi }{g}{\\phi ^{im}}{\\phi ^{kn}}{\\gamma _{mn}}, $$\n\n((6))\n\n$$ {f^{(ik)}} = \\frac{\\phi }{g}{\\phi ^{ik}} + \\frac{\\gamma }{g}{\\gamma ^{im}}{\\gamma ^{kn}}{\\phi _{mn}}, $$\n\n((7))\n\nwhere g, φ, and γ are the determinants of the corresponding tensors gik, φik, and γik. We also note that\n\n$$ g = \\gamma + \\phi + \\frac{\\gamma }{2}{\\gamma ^{kl}}{\\gamma ^{mn}}{\\phi _{km}}{\\phi _{\\ln }}, $$\n\n((8))\n\nwhere g := det gik, φ := det φik, γ := det γik. The results (6, 7, 8) were obtained already by Reichenbächer ([273], pp. 223–224)Footnote 32 and also by Schrödinger [320]. Eddington also calculated Equation (8); in his expression the term ∼φik*φik is missing (cf. [59], p. 233).\n\nThe manifold is called space-time if D=4 and the metric is symmetric and Lorentzian, i.e., symmetric and with signature sig g=±2. Nevertheless, sloppy contemporaneaous usage of the term “space-time” includes arbitrary dimension, and sometimes is applied even to metrics with arbitrary signature.\n\nIn a manifold with Lorentzian metric, a non-trivial real conformal structure always exists; from the equation\n\n$$g(X,X) = 0$$\n\n((9))\n\nresults an equivalence class of metrics {λ} with λ being an arbitrary smooth function. In view of the physical interpretation of the light cone as the locus of light signals, a causal structure is provided by the equivalence class of metrics [67]. For an asymmetric metric, this structure can exist as well; it then is determined by the symmetric part γik=γ(ik) of the metric alone taken to be Lorentzian.\n\nA special case of a space with a Lorentzian metric is Minkowski space, whose metrical components, in Cartesian coordinates, are given by\n\n$$ {\\eta _{ik}} = {\\delta _i}^0{\\delta _i}^0 - {\\delta _i}^1{\\delta _i}^1 - {\\delta _i}^2{\\delta _i}^2 - {\\delta _i}^3{\\delta _i}^3. $$\n\n((10))\n\nA geometrical characterization of Minkowski space as an uncurved, flat space is given below. Let \\({{\\mathcal L}_X}\\) be the Lie derivative with respect to the tangent vector XFootnote 33; then \\({{\\cal L}_{{{_X}_p}{\\eta _{ik}}}} = 0\\) holds for the Lorentz group of generators Xp.\n\nThe metric tensor g may also be defined indirectly through D vector fields forming an orthonormal D-leg (-bein) \\(h_{\\hat \\iota }^k\\). with\n\n$$ {g_{lm}} = {h_{l\\hat \\jmath }}{h_{m\\hat k}}{\\eta ^{\\hat \\jmath \\hat k}}, $$\n\n((11))\n\nwhere the hatted indices (“bein-indices”) count the number of legs spanning the tangent space at each point (ĵ=1, 2, … , D) and are moved with the Minkowski metricFootnote 34. From the geometrical point of view, this can always be done (cf. theories with distant parallelism). By introducing 1-forms \\({\\theta ^{\\hat k}}: = h_l^{\\hat k}d{x^l}\\), Equation (11) may be brought into the form \\(d{s^2} = {\\theta ^{\\hat \\imath}}{\\theta ^{\\hat k}}{\\eta _{\\hat \\imath\\hat k}}\\).\n\nA new physical aspect will come in if the h kî are considered to be the basic geometric variables satisfying field equations, not the metric. Such tetrad-theories (for the case D=4) are described well by the concept of fibre bundle. The fibre at each point of the manifold contains, in the case of an orthonormal D-bein (tetrad), all D-beins (tetrads) related to each other by transformations of the group O(D), or the Lorentz group, and so on.\n\nIn Finsler geometry, the line element depends not only on the coordinates xi of a point on the manifold, but also on the infinitesimal elements of direction between neighbouring points dxi:\n\n$$ d{s^2} = {g_{ij}}({x^n},d{x^m})d{x^i}d{x^j}. $$\n\n((12))\n\nAgain, gij is required to be homogeneous of rank 1.\n\n2.2.1 Affine structure\n\nThe second structure to be introduced is a linear connection L with D3 components Lijk; it is a geometrical object but not a tensor field and its components change inhomogeneously under local coordinate transformationsFootnote 35. The connection is a device introduced for establishing a comparison of vectors in different points of the manifold. By its help, a tensorial derivative ∇, called covariant derivative is constructed. For each vector field and each tangent vector it provides another unique vector field. On the components of vector fields X and linear forms ω it is defined by\n\n$$\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{{\\mathop \\nabla \\limits^ + }_k}{X^i} = \\frac{{\\partial {X^i}}}{{\\partial {x^k}}} + {L_{kj}}^i{X^j},\\;\\;\\;}&{{{\\mathop \\nabla \\limits^ + }_k}{\\omega _i} = \\frac{{\\partial {\\omega _i}}}{{\\partial {x^k}}} - {L_{ki}}^j{\\omega _j}.} \\end{array}$$\n\n((13))\n\nThe expressions \\({\\mathop \\nabla \\limits^ + _k}{X^i}\\) and \\(\\tfrac{{\\partial {X^i}}}{{\\partial {x^k}}}\\) are abbreviated by \\({X^i}_{\\left\\| k \\right.}\\) and Xi,k, respectively, while for a scalar f covariant and partial derivative coincide: \\({\\nabla _i}f = {\\tfrac{{\\partial f}}{{\\partial {x_i}}}} \\equiv {\\partial _i}f \\equiv {f_{,i}}\\).\n\nWe have adopted the notational convention used by Schouten [300, 310, 389]. Eisenhart and others [121, 234] change the order of indices of the components of the connection:\n\n$$ \\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{{\\mathop \\nabla \\limits^ - }_k}{X^i} = \\frac{{\\partial {X^i}}}{{\\partial {x^k}}} + {L_{jk}}^i{X^j},\\;\\;\\;}&{{{\\mathop \\nabla \\limits^ - }_k}{\\omega _i} = \\frac{{\\partial {\\omega _i}}}{{\\partial {x^k}}} - {L_{ik}}^j{\\omega _j}.} \\end{array} $$\n\n((14))\n\nAs long as the connection is symmetric, this does not make any difference as \\({\\mathop \\nabla \\limits^ + _k}{X^i} - {\\mathop \\nabla \\limits^ - _k}{X^i} = 2{L_{[kj]}}^i{X^j}\\). For both kinds of derivatives we have:\n\n$$ \\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{{\\mathop \\nabla \\limits^ + }_k}({v^l}{w_l}) = \\frac{{\\partial ({v^l}{w_l})}}{{\\partial {x^k}}},\\;\\;\\;}&{{{\\mathop \\nabla \\limits^ - }_k}({v^l}{w_l}) = \\frac{{\\partial ({v^l}{w_l})}}{{\\partial {x^k}}}} \\end{array} $$\n\n((15))\n\nBoth derivatives are used in versions of unified field theory by Einstein and othersFootnote 36.\n\nA manifold provided with only a linear connection L is called affine space. From the point of view of group theory, the affine group (linear inhomogeneous coordinate transformations) plays a special role: With regard to it the connection transforms as a tensor (cf. Section 2.1.5).\n\nFor a vector density (cf. Section 2.1.5), the covariant derivative of X̂ contains one more term:\n\n$$ \\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{{\\mathop \\nabla \\limits^ + }_k}{{\\hat X}^i} = \\frac{{\\partial {{\\hat X}^i}}}{{\\partial {x^k}}} + {L_{kj}}^i{{\\hat X}^j} - {L_{kr}}^r{{\\hat X}^i},\\;\\;\\;}&{{{\\mathop \\nabla \\limits^ - }_k}{{\\hat X}^i} = \\frac{{\\partial {X^i}}}{{\\partial {x^k}}} + {L_{jk}}^i{{\\hat X}^j} - {L_{rk}}^r{{\\hat X}^i}.} \\end{array} $$\n\n((16))\n\nA smooth vector field Y is said to be parallely transported along a parametrised curve λ(u) with tangent vector X if for its components \\({Y^i}_{\\left\\| k \\right.}{X^k}(u) = 0\\) holds along the curve. A curve is called an autoparallel if its tangent vector is parallely transported along it at each pointFootnote 37:\n\n$$ {X^i}_{\\left\\| k \\right.}{X^k}(u) = \\sigma (u){X^i}. $$\n\n((17))\n\nBy a particular choice of the curve73x2019;s parameter, σ=0 may be imposed.\n\nA transformation mapping autoparallels to autoparallels is given by:\n\n$$ {L_{ik}}^j \\to {L_{ik}}^j + {\\delta ^j}_{(i}{\\omega _{k)}}. $$\n\n((18))\n\nThe equivalence class of autoparallels defined by Equation (18) defines a projective structure on MD [404, 403].\n\nThe particular set of connections\n\n$$ _{(p)}{L_{ij}}^k: = {L_{ij}}^k - \\frac{2}{{D + 1}}{\\delta ^k}_{(i}{L_{j)}} $$\n\nwith \\({L_j}: = {L_{im}}^m\\) is mapped into itself by the transformation (18) [348].\n\nIn Part II of this article, we shall find the set of transformations \\({L_{ik}}^j \\to {L_{ik}}^j + {\\delta ^j}_i\\tfrac{{\\partial \\omega }}{{\\partial {x^k}}}\\) playing a role in versions of Einstein’s unified field theory.\n\nFrom the connection Lijk further connections may be constructed by adding an arbitrary tensor field T to its symmetrised partFootnote 38:\n\n$$ {\\bar L_{ij}}^k = {L_{(ij)}}^k + {T_{ij}}^k = {\\Gamma _{ij}}^k + {T_{ij}}^k. $$\n\n((20))\n\nBy special choice of T we can regain all connections used in work on unified field theories. We will encounter examples in later sections. The antisymmetric part of the connection, i.e.,\n\n$$ {S_{ij}}^k = {L_{[ij]}}^k = {T_{[ij]}}^k $$\n\n((21))\n\nis called torsion; it is a tensor field. The trace of the torsion tensor \\({S_i}: = {S_{il}}^l\\) is called torsion vector; it connects to the two traces of the affine connection \\({L_i}: = {L_{il}}^l;{{\\tilde L}_j}: = {L_{lj}}^l\\) as \\({S_i} = \\tfrac{1}{2}({L_i} - {\\tilde L_i})\\).\n\n2.2.2 Different types of geometry\n\n2.2.2.1 Affine geometry\n\nVarious subcases of affine spaces will occur, dependent on whether the connection is asymmetric or symmetric, i.e., with \\({L_{ij}}^k = {\\Gamma _{ij}}^k\\). In physical applications, a metric always seems to be needed; hence in affine geometry it must be derived solely by help of the connection or, rather, by tensorial objects constructed from it. This is in stark contrast to Riemannian geometry where, vice versa, the connection is derived from the metric. Such tensorial objects are the two affine curvature tensors defined byFootnote 39\n\n$$ \\mathop {{\\rm{ }}K}\\limits^ + {\\;^i}_{jkl}\\; = {\\partial _k}L_{lj}^{\\;\\;\\;i} - {\\partial _l}L_{kj}^{\\;\\;\\;i} + L_{km}^{\\;\\;\\;i}L_{lj}^{\\;\\;\\;m} - L_{lm}^{\\;\\;\\;i}L_{kj}^{\\;\\;\\;m}, $$\n\n((22))\n\n$$ \\mathop {{\\rm{ }}K}\\limits^ - {\\;^i}_{jkl}\\; = {\\partial _k}L_{jl}^{\\;\\;\\;i} - {\\partial _l}L_{jk}^{\\;\\;\\;i} + L_{mk}^{\\;\\;\\;i}L_{jl}^{\\;\\;\\;m} - L_{ml}^{\\;\\;\\;i}L_{jk}^{\\;\\;\\;m}, $$\n\n((23))\n\nrespectively. In a geometry with symmetric affine connection both tensors coincide because of\n\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathop {{\\rm{ }}K}\\limits^ + \\;_{jkl}^i - \\mathop {{\\rm{ }}K}\\limits^ - \\;_{jkl}^i) = {\\partial _{[k}}{S_{]lj}}^i + 2{S_{j[k}}^mS_{l]m}^{\\;\\;\\;i} + L_{m[k}^{\\;\\;\\;i}{S_{l]j}}^m - L_{j[k}^{\\;\\;\\;\\;m}{S_{l]m}}^i. $$\n\n((24))\n\nIn particular, in Riemannian geometry, both affine curvature tensors reduce to the one and only Riemann curvature tensor.\n\nThe curvature tensors arise because the covariant derivative is not commutative and obeys the Ricci identity:\n\n$$ \\mathop {{\\rm{ }}\\nabla }\\limits^ + {\\,_{[j}}\\mathop \\nabla \\limits^ + {\\,_{k]}}{A^i} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathop {{\\rm{ }}K}\\limits^ + {\\,^i}_{rjk}{A^r} - {S_{jk}}^r\\mathop {{\\rm{ }}\\nabla }\\limits^ + {\\,_r}{A^i} $$\n\n((25))\n\n$$ \\mathop {{\\rm{ }}\\nabla }\\limits^ - {\\,_{[j}}\\mathop \\nabla \\limits^ - {\\,_{k]}}{A^i} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathop {{\\rm{ }}K}\\limits^ - {\\,^i}_{rjk}{A^r} - {S_{jk}}^r\\mathop {{\\rm{ }}\\nabla }\\limits^ - {\\,_r}{A^i} $$\n\n((26))\n\nFor a vector density, the identity is given by\n\n$$ \\mathop {{\\rm{ }}\\nabla }\\limits^ + {\\,_{[j}}\\mathop \\nabla \\limits^ + {\\,_{\\,k]}}{{\\hat A}^i} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathop {{\\rm{ }}\\nabla }\\limits^ + \\,{{\\,} ^i}_{rjk}{{\\hat A}^r} - {S_{jk}}^r\\mathop \\nabla \\limits^ + {\\,_{\\,r}}{{\\hat A}^i} + \\frac{1}{2}{V_{jk}}{{\\hat A}^i} $$\n\n((27))\n\nwith the homothetic curvature Vjk to be defined below in Equation (31).\n\nThe curvature tensor (22) satisfies two algebraic identities:\n\n$$ {\\mathop {{\\rm{ }}K}\\limits^ + {\\;^i}_{j[kl]}\\; = 0,} $$\n\n((28))\n\n$$ {\\mathop {{\\rm{ }}K}\\limits^ + {\\;^i}_{\\{ jkl\\} }\\; = 2{\\nabla _{\\{ j}}{S_{kl\\} }}^i + 4{S_{m\\{ j}}^i{S_{kl\\} }}^m,} $$\n\n((29))\n\nwhere the curly bracket denotes cyclic permutation:\n\n$$ {K^i}_{\\{ jkl\\} }: = {K^i}_{jkl} + {K^i}_{ljk} + {K^i}_{klj}. $$\n\nThese identities can be found in Schouten’s book of 1924 ([300], p. 88, 91) as well as the additional single integrability condition, called Bianchi identity:\n\n$$ \\mathop {{\\rm{ }}K}\\limits^ + {\\;^i}_{j\\{ kl\\left\\| {m\\} } \\right.}\\; = 2{K^i}_{r\\{ kl}{S_{m\\} j}}^r. $$\n\n((30))\n\nA corresponding condition obtains for the curvature tensor K̅ from Equation (23).\n\nFrom both affine curvature tensors we may form two different tensorial traces each. In the first case \\({V_{kl}}: = {K^i}_{ikl} = {V_{[kl]}}\\), and \\({K_{jk}}: = {K^i}_{jki}\\). Vkl is called homothetic curvature, while Kjk is the first of the two affine generalisations from \\(\\mathop {{\\rm{ }}K}\\limits^ +\\) and \\(\\mathop {{\\rm{ }}K}\\limits^ -\\) of the Ricci tensor in Riemannian geometry. We getFootnote 40\n\n$$ {V_{kl}} = {\\partial _k}{L_l} - {\\partial _l}{L_k}, $$\n\n((31))\n\nand the following identities hold:\n\n$$ {V_{kl}} + 2{K_{[kl]}} = 4{\\nabla _{[k}}{S_{l]}} + 8{S_{kl}}^m{S_m} + 2{\\nabla _m}{S_{kl}}^m, $$\n\n((32))\n\n$$ \\mathop V\\limits^ - {\\,_{kl}} + 2\\mathop K\\limits^ - {\\,_{[kl]}} = - 4\\mathop \\nabla \\limits^ - {\\,_{[k}}{S_{l]}} + 8{S_{kl}}^m{S_m} + 2{\\nabla _m}{S_{kl}}^m, $$\n\n((33))\n\nwhere \\({S_k}: = {S_{kl}}^l\\). While Vkl is antisymmetric, Kjk has both tensorial symmetric and antisymmetric parts:\n\n$$ {K_{[kl]}} = - {\\partial _{[k}}{{\\tilde L}_{l]}} + {\\nabla _m}{S_{kl}}^m + {L_m}{S_{kl}}^m + 2{L_{[l\\left| r \\right.}}^m{S_{m\\left| k \\right.}}^r, $$\n\n((34))\n\n$$ {K_{(kl)}} = {\\partial _{(k}}{{\\tilde L}_{l)}} - {\\partial _m}{L_{(kl)}}^m - {{\\tilde L}_m}{L_{(kl)}}^m + {L_{(k\\left| m \\right|}}^n{L_{l)}}^m. $$\n\n((35))\n\nWe use the notation \\({A_{(i\\left| k \\right|l)}}\\) in order to exclude the index k from the symmetrisation bracketFootnote 41.\n\nIn order to shorten the presentation of affine geometry, we refrain from listing the corresponding set of equations for the other affine curvature tensor (cf., however, [356]).\n\nFor a symmetric affine connection, the preceding results reduce considerably due to \\({S_{kl}}^m = 0\\). From Equations (29,30,32) we obtain the identities:\n\n$$ {K^i}_{\\{ jkl\\} } = 0, $$\n\n((36))\n\n$$ {K^i}_{j\\{ kl\\left\\| {m\\} } \\right.} = 0, $$\n\n((37))\n\n$${V_{kl}} + 2{K_{[kl]}} = 0,$$\n\n((38))\n\ni.e., only one independent trace tensor of the affine curvature tensor exists. For the antisymmetric part of the Ricci tensor \\({K_{[kl]}} = - {\\partial _{[k}}{{\\tilde L}_{l]}}\\) holds. This equation will be important for the physical interpretation of affine geometry.\n\nIn affine geometry, the simplest way to define a fundamental tensor is to set gij:=αK(ij), or gij:=αK̅(ij). It may be desirable to derive the metric from a Lagrangian; then the simplest scalar density that could be used as such is given by det (Kij)Footnote 42.\n\nAs a final result in this section, we give the curvature tensor calculated from the connection \\({{\\bar L}_{ij}}^k = {\\Gamma _{ij}}^k + {T_{ij}}^k\\) (cf. Equation (20)), expressed by the curvature tensor of \\({\\Gamma _{ij}}^k\\) and by the tensor \\({T_{ij}}^k\\):\n\n$$ {K^i}_{jkl}(\\bar L) = {K^i}_{jkl}(\\Gamma ) + {2^{(\\Gamma )}}{\\nabla _{[k}}{T_{l]j}}^i - 2{T_{[k\\left| j \\right|}}^m{T_{l]m}}^i + 2{S_{kl}}^m{T_{mj}}^i, $$\n\n((39))\n\nwhere (Γ)∇ is the covariant derivative formed with the connection \\({\\Gamma _{ij}}^k\\) (cf. also [310], p. 141).\n\n2.2.2.2 Mixed geometry\n\nA manifold carrying both structural elements, i.e., metric and connection, is called a metric-affine space. If the first fundamental form is taken to be asymmetric, i.e., to contain an antisymmetric part \\({g_{[ik]}}: = \\tfrac{1}{2}({g_{ij}} - {g_{ji}})\\), we speak of a mixed geometry. In principle, both metric-affine space and mixed geometry may always be re-interpreted as Riemannian geometry with additional geometric objects: the 2-form field φ(f) (symplectic form), the torsion S, and the non-metricity Q (cf. Equation 41). It depends on the physical interpretation, i.e., the assumed relation between mathematical objects and physical observables, which geometry is the most suitable.\n\nFrom the symmetric part of the first fundamental form hij=g(ij), a connection may be constructed, often called after Levi-CivitaFootnote 43 [204],\n\n$$ \\{\\, _{ij}^k\\} : = \\frac{1}{2}{\\gamma ^{kl}}({\\gamma _{li,j}} + {\\gamma _{lj,i}} - {h_{ij,}}), $$\n\n((40))\n\nand from it the Riemannian curvature tensor defined as in Equation (22) with \\({L_{ij}}^k = \\{ \\,_{ij}^k\\}\\) (cf. Section 2.1.3); { kij } is called the Christoffel symbol. Thus, in metric-affine and in mixed geometry, two different connections arise in a natural way. In the remaining part of this section we will deal with a symmetric fundamental form γij only, and denote it by gij.\n\nWith the help of the symmetric affine connection, we may define the tensor of non-metricity \\({Q_{ij}}^k\\) byFootnote 44\n\n$$ {Q_{ij}}^k: = {g^{kl}}{\\nabla _l}{g_{ij}}. $$\n\n((41))\n\nThen the following identity holds:\n\n$$ {\\Gamma _{ij}}^k = \\{ {\\mkern 1mu} _{ij}^k{\\mkern 1mu} \\} + {K_{ij}}^k + \\frac{1}{2}({Q^k}_{ij} + {Q_{ji}}^k - {Q_{j}^{k}}_{i}), $$\n\n((42))\n\nwhere the contorsion tensor \\({K_{ij}}^k\\), a linear combination of torsion \\({S_{ij}}^k\\), is defined byFootnote 45\n\n$$ {K_{ij}}^k: = {S^k}_{ji} + {S^k}_{ij} - {S_{ij}}^k = - {K_i\\,^k_j}. $$\n\n((43))\n\nThe inner product of two tangent vectors Ai, Bk is not conserved under parallel transport of the vectors along Xl if the non-metricity tensor does not vanish:\n\n$$ {X^k}{\\mathop \\nabla \\limits^ +} _k({A^n}{B^m}{g_{nm}}) = {Q_{nml}}{A^n}{B^m}{X^l} \\ne 0. $$\n\n((44))\n\nA connection for which the non-metricity tensor vanishes, i.e.,\n\n$$ {\\mathop \\nabla \\limits^ +} _k{g_{ij}} = 0 $$\n\n((45))\n\nholds, is called metric-compatibleFootnote 46\n\nJ. M. ThomasFootnote 47 introduced a combination of the terms appearing in \\(\\mathop \\nabla \\limits^ +\\) and \\(\\mathop \\nabla \\limits^ -\\) to define a covariant derivative for the metric ([346], p. 188),\n\n$$ {g_{ik/l}}: = {g_{ik,l}} - {g_{rk}}{\\Gamma _{il}}^{r} - {g_{ir}}{\\Gamma _{lk}}^r, $$\n\n((46))\n\nand extended it for tensors of arbitrary rank ≥ 3.\n\nEinstein later used as a constraint on the metrical tensor\n\n$$ 0 = \\mathop {{g_{ik\\left\\| l \\right.}}}\\limits_{ + - } : = {g_{ik,l}} - {g_{rk}}{\\Gamma _{il}}^r - {g_{ir}}{\\Gamma _{lk}}^r, $$\n\n((47))\n\na condition that cannot easily be interpreted geometrically [97]. We will have to deal with Equation (47) in Section 6.1 and, more intensively, in Part II of this review.\n\nConnections that are not metric-compatible have been used in unified field theory right from the beginning. Thus, in Weyl’s theory [397, 395] we have\n\n$${Q_{ijk}} = {Q_k}{g_{ij}}.$$\n\n((48))\n\nIn case of such a relationship, the geometry is called semi-metrical [300, 310]. According to Equation (44), in Weyl’s theory the inner product multiplies by a scalar factor under parallel transport:\n\n$$ {X^k}{\\mathop \\nabla \\limits^ +} _k({A^n}{B^m}{g_{nm}}) = ({Q_l}{X^l}){A^n}{B^m}{g_{nm}}. $$\n\n((49))\n\nThis means that the light cone is preserved by parallel transport.\n\nWe may also abbreviate the last term in the identity (42) by introducing\n\n$$ {X_{ij}}^k: = {Q^k}_{ij} + {Q_{ji}}^k - {{Q_{j}}^k}_{i}. $$\n\n((50))\n\nThen, from Equation (39), the curvature tensor of a torsionless affine space is given by\n\n$$ {K^i}_{jkl}(\\bar \\Gamma ) = {K^i}_{jkl}(\\{ \\;_{nm}^{\\;\\;r}\\;\\} ) + {2^{(\\{ \\,_{jk}^i\\} )}}{\\nabla _{[k}}{X_{l]j}}^i - 2{X_{[k\\left| j \\right|}}^m{X_{l]m}}^i, $$\n\n((51))\n\nwhere ({ ijk })∇ is the covariant derivative formed with the Christoffel symbol.\n\nRiemann-Cartan geometry is the subcase of a metric-affine geometry in which the metric-compatible connection contains torsion, i.e., an antisymmetric part \\({L_{[ij]}}^k\\); torsion is a tensor field to be linked to physical observables. A linear connection whose antisymmetric part \\({S_{ij}}^k\\) has the form\n\n$$ {S_{ij}}^k = {S_{[i}}{\\delta ^k}_{j]} $$\n\n((52))\n\nis called semi-symmetric [300].\n\nRiemannian geometry is the further subcase with vanishing torsion of a metric-affine geometry with metric-compatible connection. In this case, the connection is derived from the metric: \\({\\Gamma _{ij}}^k = \\{ \\,_{ij}^k\\,\\}\\), where \\(\\{ \\,_{ij}^k\\,\\}\\) is the usual Christoffel symbol (40). The covariant derivative of A with respect to the Levi-Civita connection \\(\\mathop \\nabla \\limits^{\\{ \\,_{ij}^k\\,\\} }\\) is abbreviated by A;k. The Riemann curvature tensor is denoted\n\n$$ R_{jkl}^i = {\\partial _k}\\{ \\,_{lj}^i\\,\\} - {\\partial _l}\\{ \\,_{kj}^i\\,\\} + \\{ \\,_{km}^{\\;\\;i}\\,\\} \\{ \\,_{lj}^m\\,\\} - \\{ \\,_{lm}^{\\;\\;i}\\,\\} \\{ \\,_{kj}^m\\,\\} . $$\n\n((53))\n\nAn especially simple case of a Riemanian space is Minkowski space, the curvature of which vanishes:\n\n$$ R_{jkl}^i(\\eta ) = 0. $$\n\n((54))\n\nThis is an invariant characterisation irrespective of whether the Minkowski metric η is given in Cartesian coordinates as in Equation (10), or in an arbitrary coordinate system. We also have \\({{\\mathcal L}_X}{R_{ijkl}} = 0\\) where \\({\\mathcal L}\\) is the Lie-derivative (see below under “symmetries”), and X stands for the generators of the Lorentz group.\n\nIn Riemanian geometry, the so-called geodesic equation,\n\n$$ {X^i}_{;k}{X^k}(u) = \\sigma (u){X^i}, $$\n\n((55))\n\ndetermines the shortest and the straightest curve between two infinitesimally close points. However, in metric affine and in mixed geometry geodesic and autoparallel curves will have to be distinguished.\n\nA conformal transformation of the metric,\n\n$$ {g_{ik}} \\to {g'_{ik}} = \\lambda {g_{ik}}, $$\n\n((56))\n\nwith a smooth function λ changes the components of the non-metricity tensor,\n\n$$ {Q_{ij}}^k \\to {Q_{ij}}^k + {g_{ij}}{g^{kl}}{\\partial _l}\\sigma , $$\n\n((57))\n\nas well as the Levi-Civita connection,\n\n$$ \\{ \\,_{ij}^k\\,\\} \\to \\{ \\,_{ij}^k\\,\\} + \\frac{1}{2}({\\sigma _i}\\delta _j^k - {\\sigma _j}\\delta _i^k + {g_{ij}}{g^{kl}}{\\sigma _l}), $$\n\n((58))\n\nwith \\({\\sigma _i}: = {\\lambda ^{ - 1}}{\\partial _i}\\lambda\\). As a consequence, the Riemann curvature tensor \\({R^i}_{jkl}\\) is also changed; if, however, \\({{R'}^i}_{jkl} = 0\\) can be reached by a conformal transformation, then the corresponding spacetime is called conformally flat. In MD, for D>3, the vanishing of the Weyl curvature tensor\n\n$$ C_{jkl}^i: = R_{jkl}^i + \\frac{2}{{D - 2}}(\\delta _{[k}^i{R_{l]j}} + {g_{j[l}}{R^i}_{k]}) + \\frac{{2R}}{{(D - 1)(D - 2)}}{\\delta ^i}_{[l}{g_{k]j}} $$\n\n((59))\n\nis a necessary and sufficient condition for MD to be conformally flat ([397], p. 404, [300], p. 170).\n\nEven before Weyl, the question had been asked (and answered) as to what extent the conformal and the projective structures were determining the geometry: According to Kretschmann (and then to Weyl) they fix the metric up to a constant factor ([196]; see also [401], Appendix 1; for a modern approach, cf. [67]).\n\nThe geometry needed for the pre- and non-relativistic approaches to unified field theory will have to be dealt with separately. There, the metric tensor of space is Euclidean and not of full rank; time is described by help of a linear form (Newton-Cartan geometry, cf. [65, 66]). In the following we shall deal only with relativistic unified field theories.\n\n2.2.2.3 Projective geometry\n\nProjective geometry is a generalisation of Riemannian geometry in the following sense: Instead of tangent spaces with the light cone ηikdxidxk=0, where η is the Minkowski metric, in each event now a tangent space with a general, non-degenerate surface of second order γ will be introduced. This leads to a tangential cone gikdxidxk=0 in the origin (cf. Equation (9)), and to a hyperplane, the polar plane, formed by the contact points of the tangential cone and the surface γ. In place of the D inhomogeneous coordinates xi of MD, D + 1 homogeneous coordinates \\({X^\\alpha }(\\alpha = 0,1,2, \\ldots ,D)\\) are definedFootnote 48 such that they transform as homogeneous functions of first degree:\n\n$$ {X^\\alpha }\\frac{{\\partial {{X'}^\\nu }}}{{\\partial {X^\\mu }}} = {X'^\\nu }. $$\n\n((60))\n\nThe connection to the inhomogeneous coordinates xi is given by homogeneous functions of degree zero, e.g., by \\({x^i} = \\tfrac{{{x^i}}}{{{\\phi _\\alpha }{X^\\alpha }}}\\)Footnote 49. Thus, the \\({X^\\alpha }\\) themselves form the components of a tangent vector. Furthermore, the quadratic form \\({g_{\\alpha \\beta }}{X^\\alpha }{X^\\beta } = \\epsilon = \\pm 1\\) is adopted with \\({g_{\\alpha \\beta }}\\) being a homogeneous function of degree -2. A tensor field \\(T_{\\;{n_1}\\;{n_2}\\;{n_3} \\ldots }^{{m_1}{m_2}{m_3} \\ldots }\\) (cf. Section 2.1.5) depending on the homogeneous coordinates \\({X^\\mu }\\) with u contravariant (upper) and l covariant (lower) indices is required to be a homogeneous function of degree \\(r: = u - l\\).\n\nIf we define \\({\\gamma _\\mu }^i: = \\tfrac{{\\partial {x^i}}}{{\\partial {X^\\mu }}}\\), with \\({\\gamma _\\mu }^i{X^\\mu } = 0\\), then \\({\\gamma _\\mu }^i\\) transforms like a tangent vector under point transformations of the xi, and as a covariant vector under homogeneous transformations of the \\({X^\\alpha }\\). The \\({\\gamma _\\mu }^i\\) may be used to relate covariant vectors ai and \\({A_\\mu }\\) by \\({A_\\mu } = {\\gamma _\\mu }^i{a_i}\\). Thus, the metric tensor in the space of homogeneous coordinates \\({g_{\\alpha \\beta }}\\) and the metric tensor \\({g_{ik}}\\) of MD are related by \\({g_{ik}} = {\\gamma _i}^\\alpha {\\gamma _k}^\\beta {g_{\\alpha \\beta }}\\) with \\({\\gamma _\\mu }^i{\\gamma _k}^\\mu = \\delta _k^i\\). The inverse relationship is given by \\({g_{\\alpha \\beta }} = {\\gamma _\\alpha }^i{\\gamma _\\beta }^k{g_{ik}} + \\epsilon {X_\\alpha }{X_\\beta }\\) with \\({X_\\alpha } = {g_{\\alpha \\beta }}{X^\\beta }\\). The covariant derivative for tensor fields in the space of homogeneous coordinates is defined as before (cf. Section 2.1.2):\n\n$$ {\\nabla _\\alpha }{A^\\beta }(X) = \\frac{{\\partial {A^\\beta }(X)}}{{\\partial {X^\\alpha }}} + {\\Gamma _{\\alpha \\nu }}^\\beta (X){A^\\nu }(X). $$\n\n((61))\n\nThe covariant derivative of the quantity \\({\\gamma _k}^\\mu\\) interconnecting both spaces is given by\n\n$$ {\\nabla _\\rho }{\\gamma _k}^\\mu = \\frac{{\\partial {\\gamma _k}^\\mu }}{{\\partial {x^\\rho }}} + {\\Gamma _{\\rho \\sigma }}^\\mu {\\gamma _k}^\\sigma - \\{ \\,_{kl}^m\\,\\} {\\gamma _\\rho }^l{\\gamma _m}^\\mu . $$\n\n((62))\n\n2.2.3 Cartan’s method\n\nIn this section, we briefly present Cartan’s one-form formalism in order to make understandable part of the literature. Cartan introduces one-forms \\({\\theta ^{\\hat a}}(\\hat a = 1, \\ldots ,4)\\) by \\({\\theta ^{\\hat a}}: = h_l^{\\hat a}d{x^l}\\). The reciprocal basis in tangent space is given by \\({e_{\\hat \\jmath}} = h_{\\hat \\jmath}^l\\tfrac{\\partial }{{\\partial {x^l}}}\\). Thus, \\({\\theta ^{\\hat a}}({e_{\\hat \\jmath}}) = \\delta _{\\hat \\jmath}^{\\hat a}\\). The metric is then given by \\({\\eta _{\\hat \\imath\\hat k}}{\\theta ^{\\hat \\imath}} \\otimes {\\theta ^{\\hat k}}\\). The covariant derivative of a tangent vector with bein-components Xk̂ is defined via Cartan’s first structure equations,\n\n$$ {\\Theta ^i}: = D{\\theta ^{\\hat \\imath}} = d{\\theta ^{\\hat \\imath}} + {\\omega ^{\\hat \\imath}}_{\\hat l} \\wedge {\\theta ^{\\hat \\imath}}, $$\n\n((63))\n\nwhere \\({\\omega ^{\\hat \\imath }}_{\\hat k}\\) is the connection-1-form, and \\({\\Theta ^{\\hat \\imath}}\\) is the torsion-2-form, \\({\\Theta ^{\\hat \\imath }} = - {S_{\\hat l\\hat m}}^{\\hat \\imath}{\\theta ^{\\hat l}} \\wedge {\\theta ^{\\hat m}}\\). We have \\({\\omega _{\\hat \\imath\\hat k}} = - {\\omega _{\\hat k\\hat \\imath}}\\). The link to the components \\({L_{[ij]}}^k\\) of the affine connection is given by \\({\\omega ^{\\hat \\imath}}_{\\hat k} = h_l^{\\hat \\imath}h_{\\hat k}^m{L_{\\hat rm}}^l{\\theta ^{\\hat r}}\\)Footnote 50. The covariant derivative of a tangent vector with bein-components Xk̂ then is\n\n$$ D{X^{\\hat k}}: = d{X^{\\hat k}} + {\\omega ^{\\hat k}}_{\\hat l}{X^{\\hat l}}. $$\n\n((64))\n\nBy further external derivation Footnote 51 on Θ we arrive at the second structure relation of Cartan,\n\n$$ D{\\Theta ^{\\hat k}} = {\\Omega ^{\\hat k}}_{\\hat l} \\wedge {\\theta ^{\\hat l}}. $$\n\n((65))\n\nIn Equation (65) the curvature-2-form \\({\\Omega ^{\\hat k}}_{\\hat l} = \\tfrac{1}{2}{R^{\\hat k}}_{\\hat l\\hat m\\hat n}{\\theta ^{\\hat m}} \\wedge {\\theta ^{\\hat n}}\\) appears, which is given by\n\n$$ {\\Omega ^{\\hat k}}_{\\hat l} = d{\\omega ^{\\hat k}}_{\\hat l} + {\\omega ^{\\hat k}}_{\\hat l} \\wedge {\\omega ^{\\hat k}}_{\\hat l}. $$\n\n((66))\n\n\\({\\Omega ^{\\hat k}}_{\\hat k}\\) is the homothetic curvature.\n\n2.2.4 Tensors, spinors, symmetries\n\n2.2.4.1 Tensors\n\nUp to here, no definitions of a tensor and a tensor field were given: A tensor Tp(MD) of type (r, s) at a point p on the manifold MD is a multi-linear function on the Cartesian product of r cotangent- and s tangent spaces in p. A tensor field is the assignment of a tensor to each point of MD. Usually, this definition is stated as a linear, homogeneous transformation law for the tensor components in local coordinates:\n\n$$T_{{{l'}_1}\\;{{l'}_2}\\;{{l'}_3} \\cdots }^{{{k'}_1}{{k'}_2}{{k'}_3} \\ldots } = T_{{n_1}\\;{n_2}\\;{n_3} \\cdots }^{{m_1}{m_2}{m_{3 \\cdots }}}\\frac{{\\partial {x^{{n_1}}}}}{{\\partial {x^{{{l'}_1}}}}}\\frac{{\\partial {x^{{n_2}}}}}{{\\partial {x^{{{l'}_2}}}}}\\frac{{\\partial {x^{{n_3}}}}}{{\\partial {x^{{{l'}_3}}}}}\\frac{{\\partial {x^{{{k'}_1}}}}}{{\\partial {x^{{m_1}}}}}\\frac{{\\partial {x^{{{k'}_2}}}}}{{\\partial {x^{{m_2}}}}}\\frac{{\\partial {x^{{{k'}_3}}}}}{{\\partial {x^{{m_3}}}}} \\ldots $$\n\n((67))\n\nwhere xk′=xk′(xi) with smooth functions on the r.h.s. are taken from the set (“group”) of coordinate transformations (diffeomorphisms). Strictly speaking, tensors are representations of the abstract group at a point on the manifoldFootnote 52.\n\nA relative tensor Tp(MD) of type (r, s) and of weight ω at a point p on the manifold MD transforms like\n\n$$T_{{{l'}_1}\\;{{l'}_2}\\;{{l'}_3}..}^{{{k'}_1}{{k'}_2}{{k'}_3}..} = {\\left[ {\\det \\left( {\\frac{{\\partial {x^s}}}{{\\partial {{x'}^r}}}} \\right)} \\right]^\\omega }T_{{n_1}\\;{n_2}\\;{n_3} \\cdots }^{{m_1}{m_2}{m_{3 \\cdots }}}\\frac{{\\partial {x^{{n_1}}}}}{{\\partial {x^{{{l'}_1}}}}}\\frac{{\\partial {x^{{n_2}}}}}{{\\partial {x^{{{l'}_2}}}}}\\frac{{\\partial {x^{{n_3}}}}}{{\\partial {x^{{{l'}_3}}}}}\\frac{{\\partial {x^{{{k'}_1}}}}}{{\\partial {x^{{m_1}}}}}\\frac{{\\partial {x^{{{k'}_2}}}}}{{\\partial {x^{{m_2}}}}}\\frac{{\\partial {x^{{{k'}_3}}}}}{{\\partial {x^{{m_3}}}}} \\ldots $$\n\n((68))\n\nAn example is given by the totally antisymmetric object ∊ijkl with ∊ijkl=±1, or ∊ijkl=0 depending on whether (ijkl) is an even or odd permutation of (0123), or whether two indices are alike. ω=-1 for ∊ijkl; in this case, the relative tensor is called tensor density. We can form a tensor from ∊ijkl by introducing \\({\\eta _{ijkl}}: = \\sqrt { - g} { \\epsilon _{ijkl}}\\), where gik is a Lorentz-metric. Note that \\({\\eta ^{ijkl}}: = \\tfrac{1}{{\\sqrt { - g} }}{ \\epsilon ^{ijkl}}=\\). The dual to a 2-form (skew-symmetric tensor) then is defined by \\(*{F^{ij}} = \\tfrac{1}{2}{\\eta ^{ijkl}}{F_{kl}}\\).\n\nIn connection with conformal transformations \\(g \\to \\lambda g\\), the concept of the gauge-weight of a tensor is introduced. A tensor \\(T_{\\;\\;\\;\\;...}^{...}\\) is said to be of gauge weight q if it transforms by Equation (56) as\n\n$$T_{\\;\\;\\;...}^{...} = {\\lambda ^q}T_{\\;\\;\\;...}^{...}.$$\n\n((69))\n\nObjects that transform as in Equation (67) but with respect to a subgroup, e.g., the linear group, affine group G(D), orthonormal group O(D), or the Lorentz group \\({\\mathcal L}\\), are tensors in a restricted sense; sometimes they are named affine or Cartesian tensors. All the subgroups mentioned are Lie-groups, i.e., continuous groups with a finite number of parameters. In general relativity, both the “group” of general coordinate transformations and the Lorentz group are present. The concept of tensors used in Special Relativity is restricted to a representation of the Lorentz group; however, as soon as the theory is to be given a coordinate-independent (“generally covariant”) form, then the full tensor concept comes into play.\n\n2.2.4.2 Spinors\n\nSpinors are representations of the Lorentz group only; as such they are related strictly to the tangent space of the space-time manifold. To see how spinor representations can be obtained, we must use the 2-1 homomorphism of the group SL(2,C) and the proper orthochronous Lorentz group, a subgroup of the full Lorentz groupFootnote 53. Let A∈SL(2,C); then A is a complex (2-by-2)-matrix with det A=1. By picking the special Hermitian matrix\n\n$$ \\mathbf{S} = {x^0}\\mathbf{1} + \\sum\\limits_p {{\\sigma _p}{x^p},} $$\n\n((70))\n\nwhere 1 is the (2 by 2)-unit matrix and σ are the Pauli matrices satisfying\n\n$$ {\\sigma _i}{\\sigma _k} + {\\sigma _k}{\\sigma _i} = 2{\\delta _{ik}}. $$\n\n((71))\n\nThen, by a transformation A from SL(2,C),\n\n$$ \\mathbf{S}' = \\mathbf{AS}{\\mathbf{A}^ + }, $$\n\n((72))\n\nwhere A+ is the Hermitian conjugate matrixFootnote 54. Moreover, det S=det S′ which, according to Equation (70), expresses the invariance of the space-time distance to the origin:\n\n$$ {(x{\\,^{0'}})^2} - {(x{\\,^{1'}})^2} - {(x{\\,^{2'}})^2} - {(x{\\,^{3'}})^2} = {(x{\\,^0})^2} - {(x{\\,^1})^2} - {(x{\\,^2})^2}{(x{\\,^3})^2}. $$\n\n((73))\n\nThe link between the representation of a Lorentz transformation Lik in space-time and the unimodular matrix A mapping spin space (cf. below) is given by\n\n$$ L{(\\mathbf{A})_{ik}} = \\frac{1}{2}{\\rm{tr(}}{\\sigma _i}\\mathbf{A}{\\sigma _k}{\\mathbf{A}^ + }). $$\n\n((74))\n\nThus, the map is two to one: +A and -A give the same Lik.\n\nNow, contravariant 2-spinors ξA(A=1, 2) are the elements of a complex linear space, spinor space, on which the matrices A are actingFootnote 55. The spinor is called elementary if it transforms under a Lorentz-transformation as\n\n$$ {\\xi ^{A'}} = \\pm {\\mathbf{A}^A}_C{\\xi ^C}. $$\n\n((75))\n\nLikewise, contravariant dotted spinors ζȦ are those transforming with the complex-conjugate matrix Ā: {\\zeta ^{\\dot B'}} = \\pm {{\\bar \\mathbf{A}}^{\\dot B}}_{\\,\\dot D}{\\zeta ^{\\dot C}}. Covariant and covariant dotted 2-spinors correspondingly transform with the inverse matrices,\n\n$$ {\\xi _{B'}} = \\pm {({\\mathbf{A}^{ - 1}})^C}_B{\\xi _C}, $$\n\n((77))\n\nand\n\n$$ {\\xi _{\\dot B'}} = \\pm {({{{\\bf{\\bar A}}}^{ - 1}})^{\\dot C}}_{\\dot B}{\\xi _{\\dot C}}. $$\n\n((78))\n\nThe space of 2-spinors can be used as a representation space for the (proper, orthochronous) Lorentz group, with the 2-spinors being the elements of the most simple representation D(1/2,0).\n\nHigher-order spinors with dotted and undotted indices \\(S_{\\,\\,\\,\\,C \\ldots \\dot D \\ldots }^{A \\ldots \\dot B \\ldots }\\) transform correspondingly. For the raising and lowering of indices now a real, antisymmetric (2×2)-matrix ∊ with components \\({ \\epsilon ^{AB}} = \\delta _1^A\\delta _B^2 - \\delta _2^A\\delta _B^1 = { \\epsilon _{AB}}\\) is needed, such that\n\n$$ \\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{\\xi ^A} = { \\epsilon ^{AB}}{\\xi _B},\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;}&{{\\xi _A} = {\\xi ^B}{ \\epsilon _{BA}}.} \\end{array} $$\n\n((79))\n\nNext to a spinor, bispinors of the form \\({\\zeta ^{AB}},\\;{\\xi ^{A\\dot B}}\\), etc. are the simplest quantities (spinors of 2nd order). A vector Xk can be represented by a bispinor XAḂ,\n\n$$ {X^{A\\dot B}} = \\sigma _k^{A\\dot B}{X^k}, $$\n\n((80))\n\nwhere \\(\\sigma _k^{A\\dot B}\\) (k=0,…3) is a quantity linking the tangent space of space-time and spinor space. If k numerates the matrices and A, Ḃ designate rows and columns, then we can chose σ AḂ0 to be the unit matrix while for the other three indices σ AḂj are taken to be the Pauli matrices. Often the quantity \\(s_k^{A\\dot B} = \\tfrac{1}{{\\sqrt 2 }}\\sigma _k^{A\\dot B}\\) is introduced. The reciprocal matrix \\(s_{A\\dot B}^k\\) is defined by\n\n$$ s_j^{A\\dot B}s_{A\\dot B}^k = \\delta _j^k, $$\n\n((81))\n\nwhereas\n\n$$ s_j^{A\\dot B}{s^{j\\;\\;C\\dot D}} = { \\epsilon ^{AC}}{ \\epsilon ^{\\dot B\\dot D}}. $$\n\n((82))\n\nIn order to write down spinorial field equations, we need a spinorial derivative,\n\n$$ {\\partial _{A\\dot B}} = s_{A\\dot B}^k{\\partial _k} $$\n\n((83))\n\nwith \\({\\partial _{A\\dot B}}{\\partial ^{A\\dot B}} = {\\partial _k}{\\partial ^k}\\). The simplest spinorial equation is the Weyl equation:\n\n$$ \\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{\\partial _{A\\dot B}}{\\psi ^A} = 0,\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;}&{\\dot B = 1,2.} \\end{array} $$\n\n((84))\n\nThe next simplest spinor equation for two spinors χḂ, ψA would be\n\n$$ \\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{\\partial _{A\\dot C}}{\\chi ^{\\dot C}} = - \\frac{{2\\pi }}{{\\sqrt 2 h}}m{\\psi _A};\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;}&{{\\partial ^{C\\dot B}}{\\psi _C} = \\frac{{2\\pi }}{{\\sqrt 2 h}}m{\\chi ^{\\dot B}},} \\end{array} $$\n\n((85))\n\nwhere m is a mass. Equation (85) is the 2-spinor version of Dirac’s equation.\n\nDirac- or 4-spinors with 4 components ψk, k=1,…, 4, may be constructed from 2-spinors as a direct sum of contravariant undotted and covariant dotted spinors ψ and φ;: For k=1, 2, we enter ψ1 and ψ2; for k=3, 4, we enter φ1̇ and φ2̇ . In connection with Dirac spinors, instead of the Pauli-matrices the Dirac γ-matrices (4×4-matrices) appear; they satisfy\n\n$$ {\\gamma ^i}{\\gamma ^k} + {\\gamma ^k}{\\gamma ^i} = 2{\\eta ^{ik}}\\mathbf{1}. $$\n\n((86))\n\nThe Dirac equation is in 4-spinor formalism [53, 54]:\n\n$$ \\left( {i{\\gamma ^l}\\frac{\\partial }{{\\partial {x^l}}} + \\kappa } \\right)\\chi = 0, $$\n\n((87))\n\nwith the 4-component Dirac spinor χ. In the first version of Dirac’s equation, α- and β-matrices were used, related to the γ’s by\n\n$$ \\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{\\gamma ^0} = \\beta ,\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;}&{{\\gamma ^m} = \\beta {\\alpha ^m},\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;}&{m = 1,2,3,} \\end{array} $$\n\n((88))\n\nwhere the matrices β and αm are given by \\( \\left( {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} 0&{ - {\\sigma _i}}\\\\ {{\\sigma _i}}&0 \\end{array}} \\right),\\;\\;\\left( {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} 0&{ - 1}\\\\ 1&0 \\end{array}} \\right) \\).\n\nThe generally-covariant formulation of spinor equations necessitates the use of n-beins \\(h_{\\hat \\imath}^k\\), whose internal “rotation” group, operating on the “hatted” indices, is the Lorentz group. The group of coordinate transformations acts on the Latin indices. In Cartan’s one-form formalism (cf. Section 2.1.4), the covariant derivative of a 4-spinor is defined by\n\n$$ D\\psi = d\\psi + \\frac{1}{4}{\\omega _{\\hat \\imath\\hat k}}{\\sigma ^{\\hat \\imath\\hat k}}\\psi , $$\n\n((89))\n\nwhere \\({\\sigma ^{\\hat \\imath\\hat k}}: = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\left[ {{\\gamma ^{\\hat \\imath}}{\\gamma ^{\\hat k}}} \\right].\\).\n\nEquation (89) is a special case of the general formula for the covariant derivative of a tensorial form ψ, i.e., a vector in some vector space V, whose components are differential forms,\n\n$$ D\\psi = d\\psi + {\\omega ^{\\hat \\imath\\hat k}}{\\rho _{\\hat \\imath\\hat k}}({e_\\alpha })\\psi , $$\n\n((90))\n\nwhere \\(\\rho ({e_\\alpha })\\) is a particular representation of the corresponding Lie algebra in V with basis vectors \\({e_\\alpha }\\). For the example of the Dirac spinor, the adjoint representation of the Lorentz group must be usedFootnote 56.\n\n2.2.4.3 Symmetries\n\nIn Section 2.1.1 we briefly met the Lie derivative of a vector field \\({{\\mathcal L}_X}\\) with respect to the tangent vector X defined by \\({({L_X}Y)^k}: = {([X,Y])^k} = {X^i}{\\partial _i}{Y^k} - {Y^i}{\\partial _i}{X^k}\\). With its help we may formulate the concept of isometries of a manifold, i.e., special mappings, also called “motions”, locally generated by vector fields X satisfying\n\n$$ {{\\mathcal L}_X}\\;{g_{ik}}: = {\\partial _k}({g_{ij}}){X^k} + {g_{lj}}{\\partial _i}{X^l} + {g_{il}}{\\partial _j}{X^l} = 0. $$\n\n((91))\n\nThe generators X solving Equation (91) given some metric, form a Lie group Gr, the group of motions of MD. If a group Gr is prescribed, e.g., the group of spatial rotations O(3), then from Equation (91) the functional form of the metric tensor having O(3) as a symmetry group follows.\n\nA Riemannian space is called (locally) stationary if it admits a timelike Killing vector; it is called (locally) static if this Killing vector is hypersurface orthogonal. Thus if, in a special coordinate system, we take Xi=δ i0 then from Equation (91) we conclude that stationarity reduces to the condition ∂0gik= 0. If we take X to be the tangent vector field to the congruence of curves xi=xi(u), i.e., if \\({X^k} = \\tfrac{{d{x^k}}}{{du}}\\), then a necessary and sufficient condition for hypersurface-orthogonality is \\({\\epsilon^{ijkl}}{X_j}{X_{[k,l]}} = 0\\).\n\nA generalisation of Killing vectors are conformal Killing vectors for which \\({{\\mathcal L}_X}\\;{g_{ik}} = \\Phi {g_{ik}}\\) with an arbitrary smooth function Φ holds. In purely affine spaces, another type of symmetry may be defined: \\({{\\mathcal L}_X}\\;{\\Gamma _{ik}}^l = 0\\); they are called affine motions [425].\n\n2.3 Dynamics\n\nWithin a particular geometry, usually various options for the dynamics of the fields (field equations, in particular as following from a Lagrangian) exist as well as different possibilities for the identification of physical observables with the mathematical objects of the formalism. Thus, in general relativity, the field equations are derived from the Lagrangian\n\n$$ {\\mathcal L} = \\sqrt { - g} (R + 2\\Lambda - 2\\kappa {L_{\\rm{M}}}), $$\n\nwhere R(gik) is the Ricci scalar, g:=det gik, Λ the cosmological constant, and LM the matter Lagrangian depending on the metric, its first derivatives, and the matter variables. This Lagrangian leads to the well-known field equations of general relativity,\n\n$$ {R^{ik}} - \\frac{1}{2}R{g^{ik}} = - \\kappa {T^{ik}}, $$\n\n((92))\n\nwith the energy-momentum(-stress) tensor of matter\n\n$$ {T^{ik}}: = \\frac{2}{{\\sqrt { - g} }}\\frac{{\\delta (\\sqrt { - g} {L_{\\rm{M}}})}}{{\\delta {g_{ik}}}} $$\n\n((93))\n\nand \\(\\kappa = \\tfrac{{8\\pi G}}{{{c^4}}}\\), where G is Newton’s gravitational constant. \\({G^{ik}}: = {R^{ik}} - \\tfrac{1}{2}R{g^{ik}}\\) is called the Einstein tensor. In empty space, i.e., for Tik= 0, Equation (92) reduces to\n\n$$ {R^{ik}} = 0. $$\n\n((94))\n\nIf only an electromagnetic field \\({F_{ik}} = \\frac{{\\partial {A_k}}}{{\\partial {x^i}}} - \\frac{{\\partial {A_i}}}{{\\partial {x^k}}}\\) derived from the 4-vector potential Ak is present in the energy-momentum tensor, then the Einstein.Maxwell equations follow:\n\n$$ \\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{R^{ik}} - \\frac{1}{2}R{g^{ik}} = - \\kappa \\left( {{F_{il}}{F^l}_k + \\frac{1}{4}{g_{ik}}{F_{lm}}{F^{lm}}} \\right),\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;}&{{\\nabla _l}{F^{il}} = 0.} \\end{array} $$\n\n((95))\n\nThe components of the metrical tensor are identified with gravitational potentials. Consequently, the components of the (Levi-Civita) connection correspond to the gravitational “field strength”, and the components of the curvature tensor to the gradients of the gravitational field. The equations of motion of material particles should follow, in principle, from Equation (92) through the relation\n\n$$ {\\nabla _l}{T^{il}} = 0 $$\n\n((96))\n\nimplied by itFootnote 57. For point particles, due to the singularities appearing, in general this is a tricky task, up to now solved only approximately. However, the world lines for point particles falling freely in the gravitational field are, by definition, the geodesics of the Riemannian metric. This definition is consistent with the rigourous derivation of the geodesic equation for non-interacting dust particles in a fluid matter description. It is also consistent with all observations.\n\nFor most of the unified field theories to be discussed in the following, such identifications were made on internal, structural reasons, as no link-up to empirical data was possible. Due to the inherent wealth of constructive possibilities, unified field theory never would have come off the ground proper as a physical theory even if all the necessary formal requirements could have been satisfied. As an example, we take the identification of the electromagnetic field tensor with either the skew part of the metric, in a “mixed geometry” with metric compatible connection, or the skew part of the Ricci tensor in metric-affine theory, to list only two possibilities. The latter choice obtains likewise in a purely affine theory in which the metric is a derived secondary concept. In this case, among the many possible choices for the metric, one may take it proportional to the variational derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to the symmetric part of the Ricci tensor. This does neither guarantee the proper signature of the metric nor its full rank. Several identifications for the electromagnetic 4-potential and the electric current vector density have also been suggested (cf. below and [143]).\n\n2.4 Number field\n\nComplex fields may also be introduced on a real manifold. Such fields have also been used for the construction of unified field theories, although mostly after the period dealt with here (cf. Part II, in preparation). In particular, manifolds with a complex fundamental form were studied, e.g., with \\({g_{ik}} = {s_{ik}} + i{a_{ik}}\\), where \\(i = \\sqrt { - 1}\\) [97]. Also, geometries based on Hermitian forms were studied [313]. In later periods, hypercomplex numbers, quaternions, and octonions also were used as basic number fields for gravitational or unified theories (cf. Part II, forthcoming).\n\nIn place of the real numbers, by which the concept of manifold has been defined so far, we could take other number fields and thus arrive, e.g., at complex manifolds and so on. In this part of the article we do not need to take into account this generalisation.\n\n2.5 Dimension\n\nSince the suggestions by Nordström and Kaluza [238, 181], manifolds with D>4 have been used for unified field theories. In most of the cases, the additional dimensions were taken to be spacelike; nevertheless, manifolds with more than one direction of time also have been studied.\n\nAfter 1915, Einstein first was busy with extracting mathematical and physical consequences from general relativity (Hamiltonian, exact solutions, the energy conservation law, cosmology, gravitational waves). Although he kept thinking about how to find elementary particles in a field theory [70] and looked closer into Weyl’s theory [72], at first he only reacted to the new ideas concerning unified field theory as advanced by others. The first such idea after Förster’s, of course, was Hermann Weyl’s gauge approach to gravitation and electromagnetism, unacceptable to Einstein and to Pauli for physical reasons [246, 292].\n\nNext came Kaluza’s five-dimensional unification of gravitation and electromagnetism, and Eddington’s affine geometry.\n\n4.1 Weyl’s theory\n\n4.1.1 The geometry\n\nWeyl’s fundamental idea for generalising Riemannian geometry was to note that, unlike for the comparison of vectors at different points of the manifold, for the comparison of scalars the existence of a connection is not required. Thus, while lengths of vectors at different points can be compared without a connection, directions cannot. This seemed too special an assumption to Weyl for a genuine infinitesimal geometry:\n\n“If we make no further assumption, the points of a manifold remain totally isolated from each other with regard to metrical structure. A metrical relationship from point to point will only then be infused into [the manifold] if a principle for carrying the unit of length from one point to its infinitesimal neighbours is given.” Footnote 76\n\nIn contrast to this, Riemann made the much stronger assumption that line elements may be compared not only at the same place but also at two arbitrary places at a finite distance.\n\n“However, the possibility of such a comparison ‘at a distance’ in no way can be admitted in a pure infinitesimal geometry.” Footnote 77 ([397], p. 397)\n\nIn order to invent a purely “infinitesimal” geometry, Weyl introduced the 1-dimensional, Abelian group of gauge transformations,\n\n$$ g \\to \\bar g: = \\lambda g, $$\n\n((98))\n\nbesides the diffeomorphism group (coordinate transformations). At a point, Equation (98) induces a local recalibration of lengths l while preserving angles, i.e., δl=λl. If the non-metricity tensor is assumed to have the special form Qijk=Qkgij, with an arbitrary vector field Qk, then as we know from Equation (57), with regard to these gauge transformations\n\n$$ {Q_k} \\to {Q_k} + {\\partial _k}\\sigma . $$\n\n((99))\n\nWe see a striking resemblance with the electromagnetic gauge transformations for the vector potential in Maxwell’s theory. If, as Weyl does, the connection is assumed to be symmetric (i.e., with vanishing torsion), then from Equation (42) we get\n\n$$ {\\Gamma _{ij}}^k = \\{ \\,_{ij}^k\\,\\} + \\frac{1}{2}(\\delta _i^k{Q_j} + \\delta _j^k{Q_i} - {g_{ij}}{g^{kl}}{Q_l}). $$\n\n((100))\n\nThus, unlike in Riemannian geometry, the connection is not fully determined by the metric but depends also on the arbitrary vector function Qi, which Weyl wrote as a linear form dQ=Qidxi. With regard to the gauge transformations (98), \\({\\Gamma _{ij}}^k\\) remains invariant. From the 1-form dQ, by exterior derivation a gauge-invariant 2-form \\(F = {F_{ij}}d{x^i}\\,\\Lambda \\;d{x^j}\\) with \\(F = {Q_{i,j}} - {Q_{j,i}}\\) follows. It is named “Streckenkrümmung” (“line curvature”) by Weyl, and, by identifying Q with the electromagnetic 4-potential, he arrived at the electromagnetic field tensor F.\n\nLet us now look at what happens to parallel transport of a length, e.g., the norm |X| of a tangent vector along a particular curve C with parameter u to a different (but infinitesimally neighbouring) point:\n\n$$ \\frac{{d\\left| X \\right|}}{{du}} = {\\left| X \\right|_{\\left\\| k \\right.}}{X^k} = (\\sigma - \\frac{1}{2}{Q_k}{X^k})\\left| X \\right|. $$\n\n((101))\n\nBy a proper choice of the curve’s parameter, we may write (101) in the form \\(d\\left| X \\right| = - {Q_k}{X^k}\\left| X \\right|du\\) and integrate along C to obtain \\(|X| = \\int {\\exp ( - {Q_k}{X^k}du).} \\). If X is taken to be tangent to C, i.e., \\({X^k} = \\tfrac{{d{x^k}}}{{{du}}}\\), then\n\n$$ \\left| {\\frac{{d{x^k}}}{{du}}} \\right| = \\int {\\exp ( - {Q_k}(x)d{x^k})} , $$\n\n((102))\n\ni.e., the length of a vector is not integrable; its value generally depends on the curve along which it is parallely transported. The same holds for the angle between two tangent vectors in a point (cf. Equation (44)). For a vanishing electromagnetic field, the 4-potential becomes a gradient (“pure gauge”), such that \\({Q_k}d{x^k} = \\tfrac{{\\partial \\omega }}{{\\partial {x^k}}}d{x^k} = d\\omega\\), and the integral becomes independent of the curve.\n\nThus, in Weyl’s connection (100), both the gravitational and the electromagnetic fields, represented by the metrical field g and the vector field Q, are intertwined. Perhaps, having in mind Mie’s ideas of an electromagnetic world view and Hilbert’s approach to unification, in the first edition of his book, Weyl remained reserved:\n\n“Again physics, now the physics of fields, is on the way to reduce the whole of natural phenomena to one single law of nature, a goal to which physics already once seemed close when the mechanics of mass-points based on Newton’s Principia did triumph. Yet, also today, the circumstances are such that our trees do not grow into the sky.”Footnote 78 ([396], p. 170; preface dated “Easter 1918”)\n\nHowever, a little later, in his paper accepted on 8 June 1918, Weyl boldly claimed:\n\n“I am bold enough to believe that the whole of physical phenomena may be derived from one single universal world-law of greatest mathematical simplicity.”Footnote 79 ([397], p. 385, footnote 4)\n\nThe adverse circumstances alluded to in the first quotation might be linked to the difficulties of finding a satisfactory Lagrangian from which the field equations of Weyl’s theory can be derived. Due to the additional group of gauge transformations, it is useful to introduce the new concept of gauge-weight within tensor calculus as in Section 2.1.5Footnote 80. As the Lagrangian \\({\\mathcal L} = \\sqrt { - g} L\\) must have gauge-weight w=0, we are looking for a scalar L of gauge-weight -2. WeitzenböckFootnote 81 has shown that the only possibilities quadratic in the curvature tensor and the line curvature are given by the four expressions [391]\n\n$$ \\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{{({K_{ij}}\\;{g^{ij}})}^2},\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;}&{{K_{ij}}{K_{kl}}{g^{ik}}{g^{jl}},\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;}&{{K^i}_{jkl}{K^j}_{imn}{g^{km}}{g^{\\ln }},\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;}&{{F_{ij}}{F_{kl}}{g^{ik}}{g^{jl}}.} \\end{array} $$\n\n((103))\n\nWhile the last invariant would lead to Maxwell’s equations, from the invariants quadratic in curvature, in general field equations of fourth order result.\n\nWeyl did calculate the curvature tensor formed from his connection (100) but did not get the correct resultFootnote 82; it is given by Schouten ([310], p. 142) and follows from Equation (51):\n\n$$ {K^i}_{jkl} = {R^i}_{jkl} + {Q_{j;[k}}{\\delta _{l]}}^i + {\\delta _j}^i{Q_{[l;k]}} - {Q^i}_{;[k}{g_{l]j}} + \\frac{1}{2}\\left( { - {\\delta _{[l}}^i{Q_{k]}}{Q_j} + {Q_{[k}}{g_{l]j}}{Q^i} - {\\delta _{[k}}^i{g_{l]j}}{Q_r}{Q^r}} \\right). $$\n\n((104))\n\nIf the metric field g and the 4-potential Qi≡Ai are varied independently, from each of the curvature-dependent scalar invariants we do get contributions to Maxwell’s equations.\n\nPerhaps Bach (alias Förster) was also dissatisfied with Weyl’s calculations: He went through the entire mathematics of Weyl’s theory, curvature tensor, quadratic Lagrangian field equations and all; he even discussed exact solutions. His Lagrangian is given by \\({\\mathcal L} = \\sqrt g (3{W_4} - 6{W_3} + {W_2})\\), where the invariants are defined by\n\n$$ \\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{W_4}: = {S_{pqik}}{S^{pqik}},\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;}&{{W_3}: = {g^{ik}}{g^{lm}}{F^p}_{ikq}{F^q}_{lmp},\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;}&{{W_2}: = {g^{ik}}{F^p}_{ikp}} \\end{array} $$\n\nwith\n\n$$ \\begin{array}{*{20}{l}} {{S_{[pq][ik]}}: = \\frac{1}{4}({F_{pqik}} - {F_{qpik}} + {F_{ikpq}} - {F_{kipq}}),}\\\\ {\\;\\;\\;{F_{pqik}} = {R_{pqik}} + \\frac{1}{2}({g_{pq}}{f_{ki}} + {g_{pk}}{f_{q;i}} + {g_{qi}}{f_{p;k}} - {g_{pi}}{f_{q;k}} - {g_{qk}}{f_{p;i}})}\\\\ {\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\; + \\frac{1}{2}({f_q}{g_{p;[k}}{f_{i]}} + {f_p}{g_{q;[k}}{f_{i]}} + {g_{p[i}}{g_{k]q}}{f_r}{f^r}),} \\end{array} $$\n\nwhere Rpqik is the Riemannian curvature tensor, \\({f_{ik}} = {f_{i,k}} - {f_{k,i}}\\), and fi is the electromagnetic 4-potential [4].\n\n4.1.2 Physics\n\nWhile Weyl’s unification of electromagnetism and gravitation looked splendid from the mathematical point of view, its physical consequences were dire: In general relativity, the line element ds had been identified with space- and time intervals measurable by real clocks and real measuring rods. Now, only the equivalence class {λgik|λ arbitrary} was supposed to have a physical meaning: It was as if clocks and rulers could be arbitrarily “regauged” in each event, whereas in Einstein’s theory the same clocks and rulers had to be used everywhere. Einstein, being the first expert who could keep an eye on Weyl’s theory, immediately objected, as we infer from his correspondence with Weyl.\n\nIn spring 1918, the first edition of Weyl’s famous book on differential geometry, special and general relativity Raum-Zeit-Materie appeared, based on his course in Zürich during the summer term of 1917 [396]. Weyl had arranged that the page proofs be sent to Einstein. In communicating this on 1 March 1918, he also stated that\n\n“As I believe, during these days I succeeded in deriving electricity and gravitation from the same source. There is a fully determined action principle, which, in the case of vanishing electricity, leads to your gravitational equations while, without gravity, it coincides with Maxwell’s equations in first order. In the most general case, the equations will be of 4th order, though.”Footnote 83\n\nHe then asked whether Einstein would be willing to communicate a paper on this new unified theory to the Berlin Academy ([321], Volume 8B, Document 472, pp. 663–664). At the end of March, Weyl visited Einstein in Berlin, and finally, on 5 April 1918, he mailed his note to him for the Berlin Academy. Einstein was impressed: In April 1918, he wrote four letters and two postcards to Weyl on his new unified field theory — with a tone varying between praise and criticism. His first response of 6 April 1918 on a postcard was enthusiastic:\n\n“Your note has arrived. It is a stroke of genious of first rank. Nevertheless, up to now I was not able to do away with my objection concerning the scale.”Footnote 84 ([321], Volume 8B, Document 498, 710)\n\nEinstein’s “objection” is formulated in his “Addendum” (“Nachtrag”) to Weyl’s paper in the reports of the Academy, because Nernst had insisted on such a postscript. There, Einstein argued that if light rays would be the only available means for the determination of metrical relations near a point, then Weyl’s gauge would make sense. However, as long as measurements are made with (infinitesimally small) rigid rulers and clocks, there is no indeterminacy in the metric (as Weyl would have it): Proper time can be measured. As a consequence follows: If in nature length and time would depend on the pre-history of the measuring instrument, then no uniquely defined frequencies of the spectral lines of a chemical element could exist, i.e., the frequencies would depend on the location of the emitter. He concluded with the words\n\n“Regrettably, the basic hypothesis of the theory seems unacceptable to me, [of a theory] the depth and audacity of which must fill every reader with admiration.”Footnote 85 ([395], Addendum, p. 478)\n\nEinstein’s remark concerning the path-dependence of the frequencies of spectral lines stems from the path-dependency of the integral (102) given above. Only for a vanishing electromagnetic field does this objection not hold.\n\nWeyl answered Einstein’s comment to his paper in a “reply of the author” affixed to it. He doubted that it had been shown that a clock, if violently moved around, measures proper time ∫ ds. Only in a static gravitational field, and in the absence of electromagnetic fields, does this hold:\n\n“The most plausible assumption that can be made for a clock resting in a static field is this: that it measure the integral of the ds normed in this way [i.e., as in Einstein’s theory]; the task remains, in my theory as well as in Einstein’s, to derive this fact by a dynamics carried through explicitly.”Footnote 86 ([395], p. 479)\n\nEinstein saw the problem, then unsolved within his general relativity, that Weyl alluded to, i.e., to give a theory of clocks and rulers within general relativity. Presumably, such a theory would have to include microphysics. In a letter to his former student Walter Dällenbach, he wrote (after 15 June 1918):\n\n“[Weyl] would say that clocks and rulers must appear as solutions; they do not occur in the foundation of the theory. But I find: If the ds, as measured by a clock (or a ruler), is something independent of pre-history, construction and the material, then this invariant as such must also play a fundamental role in theory. Yet, if the manner in which nature really behaves would be otherwise, then spectral lines and well-defined chemical elements would not exist. […] In any case, I am as convinced as Weyl that gravitation and electricity must let themselves be bound together to one and the same; I only believe that the right union has not yet been found.”Footnote 87 ([321], Volume 8B, Document 565, 803)\n\nAnother famous theoretician who could not side with Weyl was H. A. Lorentz; in a paper on the measurement of lengths and time intervals in general relativity and its generalisations, he contradicted Weyl’s statement that the world-lines of light-signals would suffice to determine the gravitational potentials [211].\n\nHowever, Weyl still believed in the physical value of his theory. As further “extraordinarily strong support for our hypothesis of the essence of electricity” he considered the fact that he had obtained the conservation of electric charge from gauge-invariance in the same way as he had linked with coordinate-invariance earlier, what at the time was considered to be “conservation of energy and momentum”, where a non-tensorial object stood in for the energy-momentum density of the gravitational field ([398], pp. 252–253).\n\nMoreover, Weyl had some doubts about the general validity of Einstein’s theory which he derived from the discrepancy in value by 20 orders of magniture of the classical electron radius and the gravitational radius corresponding to the electron’s mass ([397], p. 476; [152]).\n\n4.1.3 Reactions to Weyl’s theory I: Einstein and Weyl\n\nThere exists an intensive correspondence between Einstein and Weyl, now completely available in volume 8 of the Collected Papers of Einstein [321]. We subsume some of the relevant discussions. Even before Weyl’s note was published by the Berlin Academy on 6 June 1918, many exchanges had taken place between him and Einstein.\n\nOn a postcard to Weyl on 8 April 1918, Einstein reaffirmed his admiration for Weyl’s theory, but remained firm in denying its applicability to nature. Weyl had given an argument for dimension 4 of space-time that Einstein liked: As the Lagrangian for the electromagnetic field FikFik is of gauge-weight -2 and \\(\\sqrt { - g}\\) has gauge-weight D/2 in an MD, the integrand in the Hamiltonian principle \\(\\sqrt { - g} {F_{ik}}{F^{ik}}\\) can have weight zero only for D=4: “Apart from the [lacking] agreement with reality it is in any case a grandiose intellectual performance”Footnote 88 ([321], Vol. 8B, Doc. 499, 711). Weyl did not give in:\n\n“Your rejection of the theory for me is weighty; […] But my own brain still keeps believing in it. And as a mathematician I must by all means hold to [the fact] that my geometry is the true geometry ‘in the near’, that Riemann happened to come to the special case Fik=0 is due only to historical reasons (its origin is the theory of surfaces), not to such that matter.”Footnote 89 ([321], Volume 8B, Document 544, 767)\n\nAfter Weyl’s next paper on “pure infinitesimal geometry” had been submitted, Einstein put forward further arguments against Weyl’s theory. The first was that Weyl’s theory preserves the similarity of geometric figures under parallel transport, and that this would not be the most general situation (cf. Equation (49)). Einstein then suggested the affine group as the more general setting for a generalisation of Riemannian geometry ([321], Vol. 8B, Doc. 551, 777). He repeated this argument in a letter to his friend Michele Besso from his vacations at the Baltic Sea on 20 August 1918, in which he summed up his position with regard to Weyl’s theory:\n\n“[Weyl’s] theoretical attempt does not fit to the fact that two originally congruent rigid bodies remain congruent independent of their respective histories. In particular, it is unimportant which value of the integral \\(\\int {\\phi _\\nu }d{x_\\nu }\\) is assigned to their world line. Otherwise, sodium atoms and electrons of all sizes would exist. But if the relative size of rigid bodies does not depend on past history, then a measurable distance between two (neighbouring) world-points exists. Then, Weyl’s fundamental hypothesis is incorrect on the molecular level, anyway. As far as I can see, there is not a single physical reason for it being valid for the gravitational field. The gravitational field equations will be of fourth order, against which speaks all experience until now […].”Footnote 90 ([99], p. 133)\n\nEinstein’s remark concerning “affine geometry” is referring to the affine geometry in the sense it was introduced by Weyl in the 1st and 2nd edition of his book [396], i.e., through the affine group and not as a suggestion of an affine connexion.\n\nFrom Einstein’s viewpoint, in Weyl’s theory the line element ds is no longer a measurable quantity — the electromagnetical 4-potential never had been one. Writing from his vacations on 18 September 1918, Weyl presented a new argument in order to circumvent Einstein’s objections. The quadratic form Rgikdxidxk is an absolute invariant, i.e., also with regard to gauge transformations (gauge weight 0). If this expression would be taken as the measurable distance in place of ds, then\n\n“[…] by the prefixing of this factor, so to speak, the absolute norming of the unit of length is accomplished after all”Footnote 91 ([321], Volume 8B, Document 619, 877–879)\n\nEinstein was unimpressed:\n\n“But the expression Rgikdxidxk for the measured length is not at all acceptable in my opinion because R is very dependent on the matter density. A very small change of the measuring path would strongly influence the integral of the square root of this quantity.”Footnote 92\n\nEinstein’s argument is not very convincing: gik itself is influenced by matter through his field equations; it is only that now R is algebraically connected to the matter tensor. In view of the more general quadratic Lagrangian needed in Weyl’s theory, the connection between R and the matter tensor again might become less direct. Einstein added:\n\n“Of course I know that the state of the theory as I presented it is not satisfactory, not to speak of the fact that matter remains unexplained. The unconnected juxtaposition of the gravitational terms, the electromagnetic terms, and the λ-terms undeniably is a result of resignation.[…] In the end, things must arrange themselves such that action-densities need not be glued together additively.”Footnote 93 ([321], Volume 8B, Document 626, 893–894)\n\nThe last remarks are interesting for the way in which Einstein imagined a successful unified field theory.\n\n4.1.4 Reactions to Weyl’s theory II: Schouten, Pauli, Eddington, and others\n\nSommerfeld seems to have been convinced by Weyl’s theory, as his letter to Weyl on 3 June 1918 shows:\n\n“What you say here is really marvelous. In the same way in which Mie glued to his consequential electrodynamics a gravitation which was not organically linked to it, Einstein glued to his consequential gravitation an electrodynamics (i.e., the usual electrodynamics) which had not much to do with it. You establish a real unity.”Footnote 94 [327]\n\nSchouten, in his attempt in 1919 to replace the presentation of the geometrical objects used in general relativity in local coordinates by a “direct analysis”, also had noticed Weyl’s theory. In his “addendum concerning the newest theory of Weyl”, he came as far as to show that Weyl’s connection is gauge invariant, and to point to the identification of the electromagnetic 4-potential. Understandably, no comments about the physics are given ([295], pp. 89–91).\n\nIn the section on Weyl’s theory in his article for the Encyclopedia of Mathematical Sciences, Pauli described the basic elements of the geometry, the loss of the line-element ds as a physical variable, the convincing derivation of the conservation law for the electric charge, and the too many possibilities for a Lagrangian inherent in a homogeneous function of degree 1 of the invariants (103). As compared to his criticism with respect to Eddington’s and Einstein’s later unified field theories, he is speaking softly, here. Of course, as he noted, no progress had been made with regard to the explanation of the constituents of matter; on the one hand because the differential equations were too complicated to be solved, on the other because the observed mass difference between the elementary particles with positive and negative electrical charge remained unexplained. In his general remarks about this problem at the very end of his article, Pauli points to a link of the asymmetry with time-reflection symmetry (see [246], pp. 774–775; [244]). For Einstein, this criticism was not only directed against Weyl’s theory\n\n“but also against every continuum-theory, also one which treats the electron as a singularity. Now as before I believe that one must look for such an overdetermination by differential equations that the solutions no longer have the character of a continuum. But how?” ([103], p. 43)\n\nIn a letter to Besso on 26 July 1920, Einstein repeated an argument against Weyl’s theory which had been removed by Weyl — if only by a trick to be described below; Einstein thus said:\n\n“One must pass to tensors of fourth order rather than only to those of second order, which carries with it a vast indeterminacy, because, first, there exist many more equations to be taken into account, second, because the solutions contain more arbitrary constants.”Footnote 95 ([99], p. 153)\n\nIn his book “Space, Time, and Gravitation”, Eddington gave a non-technical introduction into Weyl’s “welding together of electricity and gravitation into one geometry”. The idea of gauging lengths independently at different events was the central theme. He pointed out that while the fourfold freedom in the choice of coordinates had led to the conservation laws for energy and momentum, “in the new geometry is a fifth arbitrariness, namely that of the selected gaugesystem. This must also give rise to an identity; and it is found that the new identity expresses the law of conservation of electric charge.” One natural gauge was formed by the “radius of curvature of the world”; “the electron could not know how large it ought to be, unless it had something to measure itself against” ([57], pp. 174, 173, 177).\n\nAs Eddington distinguished natural geometry and actual space from world geometry and conceptual space serving for a graphical representation of relationships among physical observables, he presented Weyl’s theory in his monograph “The mathematical theory of relativity”\n\n“from the wrong end — as its author might consider; but I trust that my treatment has not unduly obscured the brilliance of what is unquestionably the greatest advance in the relativity theory after Einstein’s work.” ([59], p. 198)\n\nOf course, “wrong end” meant that Eddington took Weyl’s theory such\n\n“that his non-Riemannian geometry is not to be applied to actual space-time; it refers to a graphical representation of that relation-structure which is the basis of all physics, and both electromagnetic and metrical variables appear in it as interrelated.” ([59], p. 197)\n\nAgain, Eddington liked Weyl’s natural gauge encountered in Section 4.1.5, which made the curvature scalar a constant, i.e., K=4λ; it became a consequence of Eddington’s own natural gauge in his affine theory, Kij=λgij (cf. Section 4.3). For Eddington, Weyl’s theory of gauge-transformation was a hybrid:\n\n“He admits the physical comparison of length by optical methods […]; but he does not recognise physical comparison of length by material transfer, and consequently he takes λ to be a function fixed by arbitrary convention and not necessarily a constant.“ ([59], pp. 220–221)\n\nIn the depth of his heart Weyl must have kept a fondness for his idea of “gauging” a field all during the decade between 1918 and 1928. As he had abandoned the idea of describing matter as a classical field theory since 1920, the linking of the electromagnetic field via the gauge idea could only be done through the matter variables. As soon as the new spinorial wave function (“matter wave”) in Schrödinger’s and Dirac’s equations emerged, he adapted his idea and linked the electromagnetic field to the gauging of the quantum mechanical wave function [407, 408]. In October 1950, in the preface for the first American printing of the English translation of the fourth edition of his book Space, Time, Matter from 1922, Weyl clearly expressed that he had given up only the particular idea of a link between the electromagnetic field and the local calibration of length:\n\n“While it was not difficult to adapt also Maxwell’s equations of the electromagnetic field to this principle [of general relativity], it proved insufficient to reach the goal at which classical field physics is aiming: a unified field theory deriving all forces of nature from one common structure of the world and one uniquely determined law of action.[…] My book describes an attempt to attain this goal by a new principle which I called gauge invariance. (Eichinvarianz). This attempt has failed.” ([410], p. V)\n\n4.1.5 Reactions to Weyl’s theory III: Further research\n\nPauli, still a student, and with his article for the Encyclopedia in front of him, pragmatically looked into the gravitational effects in the planetary system, which, as a consequence of Einstein’s field equations, had helped Einstein to his fame. He showed that Weyl’s theory had, for the static case, as a possible solution a constant Ricci scalar; thus it also admitted the Schwarzschild solution and could reproduce all desired effects [244, 243].\n\nWeyl himself continued to develop the dynamics of his theory. In the third edition of his Space-Time-Matter [398], at the Naturforscherversammlung in Bad Nauheim in 1920 [399], and in his paper on “the foundations of the extended relativity theory” in 1921 [402], he returned to his new idea of gauging length by setting R=λ= const. (cf. Section 4.1.3); he interpreted λ to be the “radius of curvature” of the world. In 1919, Weyl’s Lagrangian originally was \\({\\mathcal L} = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\sqrt g {K^2} + \\beta {F_{ik}}{F^{ik}}\\) together with the constraint K=2λ, with constant λ ([398], p. 253). As an equivalent Lagrangian Weyl gave, up to a divergenceFootnote 96\n\n$$ {\\mathcal L} = \\sqrt g \\left( {R + \\alpha {F_{ik}}{F^{ik}} + \\frac{1}{4}(2\\lambda - 3{\\phi _l}{\\phi ^l})} \\right), $$\n\n((105))\n\nwith the 4-potential φ and the electromagnetic field Fik. Due to his constraint, Weyl had navigated around another problem, i.e., the formulation of the Cauchy initial value problem for field equations of fourth order: Now he had arrived at second order field equations. In the paper in 1921, he changed his Lagrangian slightly into\n\n$$ {\\mathcal L} = \\sqrt g \\left( {R + \\alpha {F_{ik}}{F^{ik}} + \\frac{{{ \\epsilon ^2}}}{4}(1 - 3{\\phi _l}{\\phi ^l})} \\right), $$\n\n((106))\n\nwith ∊ a factor in Weyl’s connection (100),\n\n$$ {\\Gamma _{ij}}^k = \\{ \\,_{ij}^k\\,\\} + \\frac{ \\in }{2}(\\delta _i^k{\\phi _j} + \\delta _j^k{\\phi _i} - {g_{ij}}{g^{kl}}{\\phi _l}). $$\n\n((107))\n\nIn both presentations, he considered as an advantage of his theory:\n\n“Moreover, this theory leads to the cosmological term in a uniform and forceful manner, [a term] which in Einstein’s theory was introduced ad hoc”Footnote 97 ([402], p. 474)\n\nReichenbächer seemingly was unhappy about Weyl’s taking the curvature scalar to be a constant before the variation; in the discussion after Weyl’s talk in 1920, he inquired whether one could not introduce Weyl’s “natural gauge” after the variation of the Lagrangian such that the field equations would show their gauge invariance first ([399], p. 651). Eddington criticised Weyl’s choice of a Lagrangian as speculative:\n\n“At the most we can only regard the assumed form of action […] as a step towards some more natural combination of electromagnetic and gravitational variables.” ([59], p. 212)\n\nThe changes, which Weyl had introduced in the 4th edition of his book [401], and which, according to him, were of fundamental importance for the understanding of relativity theory, were discussed by him in a further paper [400]. In connection with the question of whether, in general relativity, a formulation might be possible such that “matter whose characteristical traits are charge, mass, and motion generates the field”, a question which was considered as unanswered by Weyl, he also mentioned a publication of Reichenbächer [272]. For Weyl, knowledge of the charge and mass of each particle, and of the extension of their “world-channels” were insufficient to determine the field uniquely. Weyl’s hint at a solution remains dark; nevertheless, for him it meant\n\n“to reconciliate Reichenbächer’s idea: matter causes a ‘deformation’ of the metrical field and Einstein’s idea: inertia and gravitation are one.” ([400], p. 561, footnote)\n\nAlthough Einstein could not accept Weyl’s theory as a physical theory, he cherished “its courageous mathematical construction” and thought intensively about its conceptual foundation: This becomes clear from his paper “On a complement at hand of the bases of general relativity” of 1921 [73]. In it, he raised the question whether it would be possible to generate a geometry just from the conformal invariance of Equation (9) without use of the conception “distance”, i.e., without using rulers and clocks. He then embarked on conformal invariants and tensors of gauge-weight 0, and gave the one formed from the square of Weyl’s conformal curvature tensor (59), i.e. \\({C^i}_{jkl}C_i^{jkl}\\). His colleague in Vienna, WirtingerFootnote 98, had helped him in thisFootnote 99. Einstein’s conclusion was that, by writing down a metric with gauge-weight 0, it was possible to form a theory depending only on the quotient of the metrical components. If J has gauge-weight -1, then Jgik is such a metric. In order to reduce the new theory to general relativity, in addition only the differential equation\n\n$$ J = {J_0} = {\\rm{const}}{\\rm{.}} $$\n\n((108))\n\nwould have to be solved.\n\nEisenhart wished to partially reinterpret Weyl’s theory: In place of putting the vector potential equal to Weyl’s gauge vector, he suggested to identify it with \\(\\tfrac{{ - F_k^i{J^k}}}{\\mu }\\), where Ji is the electrical 4-current vector (-density) and μ the mass density. He referred to Weyl, Eddington’s book, and to Pauli’s article in the Encyclopedia of Mathematical Sciences [116].\n\nEinstein’s rejection of the physical value of Weyl’s theory was seconded by DienesFootnote 100, if only with a not very helpful argument. He demanded that the connection remain metric-compatible from which, trivially, Weyl’s gauge-vector must vanish. Dienes applied the same argument to Eddington’s generalisation of Weyl’s theory [51]. Other mathematicians took Weyl’s theory at its face value and drew consequences; thus M. Juvet calculated Frenet’s formulas for an “n-èdre” in Weyl’s geometry by generalising a result of Blaschke for Riemannian geometry [180]. More important, however, for later work was the gauge invariant tensor calculus by a fellow of St. John’s College in Cambridge, M. H. A. Newman [237]. In this calculus, tensor equations preserve their form both under a change of coordinates and a change of gauge. Newman applied his scheme to a variational principle with Lagrangian K2 and concluded:\n\n“The part independent of the ‘electrical’ vector φi is found to be \\({K_{ij}} - \\tfrac{1}{4}K{g_{ij}}\\), a tensor which has been considered by Einstein from time to time in connection with the theory of gravitation.” ([237], p. 623)\n\nAfter the Second World War, research following Weyl’s classical geometrical approach with his original 1-dimensional Abelian gauge-group was resumed. The more important development, however, was the extension to non-Abelian gauge-groups and the combination with Kaluza’s idea. We shall discuss these topics in Part II of this article. The shift in Weyl’s interpretation of the role of the gauging from the link between gravitation and electromagnetism to a link between the quantum mechanical state function and electromagnetism is touched on in Section 7.\n\n4.2 Kaluza’s five-dimensional unification\n\nWhat is now called Kaluza-Klein theory in the physics community is a mixture of quite different contributions by both scientistsFootnote 101. Kaluza’s idea of looking at four spatial and one time dimension originated in or before 1919; by then he had communicated it to Einstein:\n\n“The idea of achieving [a unified field theory] by means of a five-dimensional cylinder world never dawned on me. [–] At first glance I like your idea enormously.” (letter of Einstein to Kaluza of 21 April 1919)\n\nThis remark is surprising because Nordström had suggested a five-dimensional unification of his scalar gravitational theory with electromagnetism five years earlier [238], by embedding space-time into a five-dimensional world in quite the same way as Kaluza did. In principle, Einstein could have known Nordström’s work. In the same year 1914, he and Fokker had given a covariant formulation of Nordström’s pure (scalar) theory of gravitation [104]. In a subsequent letter to Kaluza of 5 May 1919 Einstein still was impressed: “The formal unity of your theory is startling.” However, on 29 May 1919, Einstein became somewhat reservedFootnote 102:\n\n“I respect greatly the beauty and boldness of your idea. But you understand that, in view of the existing factual concerns, I cannot take sides as planned originally.”Footnote 103\n\nKaluza’s paper was communicated by Einstein to the Academy, but for reasons unknown was published only in 1921 [181]. Kaluza’s idea was to write down the Einstein field equations for empty space in a five-dimensional Riemannian manifold with metric \\({g_{\\alpha \\beta }}\\), i.e., \\({R_{\\alpha \\beta }} = 0\\), α, β=1,…, 5, where \\({R_{\\alpha \\beta }}\\) is the Ricci tensor of M5, and to look at small deviations γ from Minkowski space: \\({g_{\\alpha \\beta }} = - {\\delta _{\\alpha \\beta }} + {\\gamma _{\\alpha \\beta }}\\).Footnote 104. In order to obtain a theory in space-time, he assumed the so-called “cylinder condition”\n\n$$ {g_{\\alpha \\beta ,5}} = 0, $$\n\n((109))\n\nequivalent to the existence of a spacelike translational symmetry (Killing vector). Equation (109) is used for all “functions of state” (Zustandsgrössen), i.e., also for the matter variables. Kaluza did not normalize the Killing vector to a constant, i.e., he kept\n\n$$ {g_{55}} \\ne {\\rm{const}}{\\rm{.}} $$\n\n((110))\n\nEquation (110) is called the “sharpened cylinder condition” by some authors including Einstein. Of the 15 components of \\({g_{\\alpha \\beta }}\\), five had to get a new physical interpretation, i.e. \\({g_{\\alpha 5}}\\) and g55; the components gik, i, k=1, …, 4, were to describe the gravitational field as before; Kaluza took gi5 proportional to the electromagnetic vector potential Ai. The component g55 turned out to be a (scalar) gravitational potential which, in the static case, satisfies the equation\n\n$$ {\\nabla ^2}{g_{55}} = - \\kappa {\\mu _0}, $$\n\n((111))\n\nwith the constant matter density μ0.\n\nKaluza also showed that the geodesics of the five-dimensional space reduce to the equations of motion for a charged point particle in space-time, if a weakness assumption is made for the components of the 5-velocity \\({u^\\alpha }:{u^1},{u^2},{u^3},{u^5} \\ll 1\\), u4≃1. The Lorentz force appears augmented by an additional term containing g55 of the order \\({\\left( {\\tfrac{u}{c}} \\right)^2}\\) which thus may be neglected. From the fifth equation of motion Kaluza concluded that the fifth component of momentum p5∼e, with e being the particles’ electric charge (up to a constant of proportionality). From the equations of motion, charge conservation also followed in Kaluza’s linear approximation. Kaluza was well aware that his theory broke down if applied to elementary particles like electrons or protons, and speculated about an escape in which gravitation had to be considered as some “difference effect”, and the gravitational constant given “a statistical meaning”. For him, any theory claiming universal validity was endangered by quantum theory, anyway.\n\nFrom the cylinder condition, a grave objection toward Kaluza’s approach results: Covariance with regard to the diffeomorphism group of M5 is destroyed. The remaining covariance group G5 is given by\n\n$$ \\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{x^{5'}} = {x^5} + f({x^k}),\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;}&{{x^{l'}} = {x^l}({x^m}),\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;}&{k,l,m = 1, \\ldots ,4.} \\end{array} $$\n\n((112))\n\nThe objects transforming properly under (112) are: the scalar \\({g_{5'5'}} = {g_{55}}\\), the vector-potential \\({g_{5'k'}} = {g_{5l}}\\frac{{\\partial {x^l}}}{{\\partial {x^{k'}}}} + {g_{55}}\\frac{{\\partial {x^5}}}{{\\partial {x^{k'}}}}\\), and the projected metric\n\n$$ {g_{i'k'}} - \\frac{{{g_{i'5'}}{g_{k'5'}}}}{{{g_{5'5'}}}} = \\left( {{g_{lm}} - \\frac{{{g_{l5}}{g_{m5}}}}{{{g_{55}}}}} \\right)\\frac{{\\partial {x^l}}}{{\\partial {x^{i'}}}}\\frac{{\\partial {x^m}}}{{\\partial {x^{k'}}}}. $$\n\n((113))\n\nKlein identified the group; however, he did not comment on the fact that now further invariants are available for a Lagrangian, but started right away from the Ricci scalar of M5 [185]. The group G5 is isomorphic to the group H5 of transformations for five homogeneous coordinates \\({X^{\\mu '}} = {f^\\mu }({X^\\nu })\\) with \\({f^\\nu }\\) homogeneous functions of degree 1. Here, contact is made to the projective formulation of Kaluza’s theory (cf. “projective geometry” in Sections 2.1.3 and 6.3.2).\n\nWhile towards the end of May 1919 Einstein had not yet fully supported the publication of Kaluza’s manuscript, on 14 October 1921 he thought differently:\n\n“I am having second thoughts about having kept you from the publication of your idea on the unification of gravitation and electricity two years ago. I value your approach more than the one followed by H. Weyl. If you wish, I will present your paper to the Academy after all.”Footnote 105 (letter from Einstein to Kaluza reprinted in [49], p. 454)\n\nIt seems that at some point Einstein had set his calculational aide GrommerFootnote 106 to work on regular spherically symmetric solutions of Kaluza’s theory. This led to a joint publication which was submitted just one month after Einstein had finally presented a rewritten manuscript of Kaluza’s to the Berlin Academy [105]. The negative result of his own paper, i.e., that no non-singular, statical, spherically symmetric exact solution exists, did not please Einstein. He also thought that Kaluza’s assumption of general covariance in the five-dimensional manifold had no support from physics; he disliked the preference of the fifth coordinate due to Equation (109) which seemed to contradict the equivalence of all five coordinates used by Kaluza in the construction of the field equations [105]. In any case, apart from an encouraging letter to Kaluza in 1925 in which he called Kaluza’s idea the only serious attempt at unified field theory besides the Weyl-Eddington approach, Einstein kept silent on the five-dimensional theory until 1926.\n\n4.3 Eddington’s affine theory\n\n4.3.1 Eddington’s paper\n\nThe third main idea that emerged was Eddington’s suggestion to forego the metric as a fundamental concept and start right away with a (general) connection, which he then restricted to a symmetric one Γ in order to avoid an “infinitely crinkled” world [58]. His motivation went beyond the unification of gravitation and electromagnetism:\n\n“In passing beyond Euclidean geometry, gravitation makes its appearance; in passing beyond Riemannian geometry, electromagnetic force appears; what remains to be gained by further generalisation? Clearly, the non-Maxwellian binding forces which hold together an electron. But the problem of the electron must be difficult, and I cannot say whether the present generalisation succeeds in providing the material for its solution” ([58], p. 104)\n\nIn the first, shorter, part of two, Eddington describes affine geometry; in the second he relates mathematical objects to physical variables. He distinguishes the affine geometry as the “geometry of the world-structure” from Riemannian geometry as “the natural geometry of the world”. He starts by calculating both the curvature and Ricci tensors from the symmetric connection according to Equation (39). The Ricci tensor Kij(Γ):=*Gij is asymmetricFootnote 107,\n\n$$*{\\text{G}_{kl}} = {\\text{R}_{kl}} + {\\text{F}_{kl}},$$\n\n((114))\n\nwith Rkl(Γ) being the symmetric and Fkl(Γ) the antisymmetric part. According to Equation (31) Fkl derives from a “vector potential”, i.e., \\({F_{kl}} = {\\partial _k}{\\Gamma _l} - {\\partial _l}{\\Gamma _k}\\) with \\({\\Gamma _{lr}}^r\\), such that an immediate physical identification of Fkl with the electromagnetic field tensor is at hand. With half of Maxwell’s equations being satisfied automatically, the other half is used to define the electric charge current jk by \\({j^l}: = {F^{lk}}_{\\left\\| k \\right.}\\). By this, Eddington claims to guarantee charge conservation:\n\n“The divergence of jk will vanish identically if jk is itself the divergence of any antisymmetrical contravariant tensor.” ([64], p. 223; cf. also [58], p. 113)\n\nNow, by Equation (25),\n\n$$ {F^{lk}}_{\\left\\| {[l} \\right\\|k]} = {K_{[rk]}}{F^{rk}} + {S_{jk}}^s{\\nabla _s}{F^{jk}}. $$\n\n((115))\n\nFor a symmetric connection thus, unlike in Riemannian geometry,\n\n$$ {j^k}_{\\left\\| k \\right.} = {F^{lk}}_{\\left\\| {[l} \\right\\|k]} = {F_{rk}}{F^{rk}} \\ne 0. $$\n\n((116))\n\nHowever, for a tensor density, due to Equation (16) we obtain\n\n$$ {{\\hat \\jmath}^k}_{\\left\\| k \\right.} = {{\\hat F}^{lk}}_{\\left\\| {[l} \\right\\|k]} = \\frac{1}{2}({V_{rk}} + 2{K_{[rk]}}){{\\hat F}^{rk}} + {S_{jk}}^s{\\nabla _s}{{\\hat F}^{jk}}, $$\n\n((117))\n\nand thus for a torsionless connection (cf. Equation (38)) \\({j^k}_{\\left\\| k \\right.} = 0.\\)\n\nEddington introduces the metrical tensor by the definition\n\n$$ \\lambda {g_{kl}} = {R_{kl}}, $$\n\n((118))\n\n“introducing a universal constant λ, for convenience, in order to remain free to use the centimetre instead of the natural unit of length”. This is called “Einstein’s gauge” by Eddington; he is delighted that\n\n“Our gauging-equation is therefore certainly true wherever light is propagated, i.e., everywhere inside the electron. Who shall say what is the ordinary gauge inside the electron?” ([58], p. 114)\n\nWhile this remark certainly is true, there is no guarantee in Eddington’s approach that gkl thus defined is a Lorentzian metric, i.e., that it could describe light propagation at all. Only connections leading to a Lorentz metric can be used if a physical interpretation is wanted. Note also, that the interpretation of Rkl as the metric implies that det Rkl≠0.\n\nWe must read Equation (118) as giving gkl(Γ) if the only basic variable in affine geometry, i.e., the connection \\({\\Gamma _{ij}}^k\\), has been determined by help of some field equations. Thus, in general, gkl is not metric-compatible; in order to make it such, we are led to the differential equations \\({R_{ij\\left\\| k \\right.}} = 0\\) for \\({\\Gamma _{ij}}^k\\), an equation not considered by Eddington. In the absence of an electromagnetic field, Equation (118) looks like Einstein’s vacuum field equation with cosmological constant. In principle, now a fictitious “Riemannian” connection (the Christoffel symbol) can be written down which, however, is a horribly complicated function of the affine connection — as the only fundamental geometrical quantity available. This is due to the expression for the inverse of the metric, a function cubic in Rkl. Eddington’s affine theory thus can also be seen as a bi-connection theory. Note also that Eddington does not explicitly say how to obtain the contravariant form of the electromagnetic field Fij from Fij; we must assume that he thought of raising indices with the complicated inverse metric tensor.\n\nIn connection with cosmological considerations, Eddington cherished the λ-term in Equation (118):\n\n“I would as soon think of reverting to Newtonian theory as of dropping the cosmic constant.” ([63], p. 35)\n\nNow, Eddington was able to identify the energy-momentum tensor Tik of the electromagnetic field by decomposing the Ricci tensor Kij formed from Equation (51) into a metric part Rik and the rest. The energy-momentum tensor Tik of the electromagnetic field is then defined by Einstein’s field equations with a fictitious cosmological constant \\(\\kappa {T^{ik}}: = {G^{ik}} - \\tfrac{1}{2}{g^{ik}}(G - 2\\lambda )\\).\n\nAlthough Eddington’s interest did not rest on finding a proper set of field equations, he nevertheless discussed the Lagrangian \\({\\mathcal L} = \\sqrt { - g} *{G^{ik}}*{G_{ik}}\\), and showed that a variation with regard to gik did not lead to an acceptable field equation.\n\nEddington’s main goal in this paper was to include matter as an inherent geometrical structure:\n\n“What we have sought is not the geometry of actual space and time, but the geometry of the world-structure which is the common basis of space and time and things.” ([58], p. 121)\n\nBy “things” he meant\n\n(1)\n\nthe energy-momentum tensor of matter, i.e., of the electromagnetic field,\n\n(2)\n\nthe tensor of the electromagnetic field, and\n\n(3)\n\nthe electric charge-and-current vector.\n\nHis aim was reached in the sense that all three quantities were fixed entirely by the connection; they could no longer be given from the outside. As to the question of the electron, it is seen as “a region of abnormal world-curvature”, i.e., of abnormally large curvature.\n\nWhile Pauli liked Eddington’s distinction between “natural geometry” and “world geometry” — with the latter being only “a graphical representation” of reality — he was not sure at all whether “a point of view could be taken from which the gravitational and electromagnetical fields appear as union”. If so, then it must be a purely phenomenological one without any recourse to the nature of the charged elementary particles (cf. his letter to Eddington quoted below).\n\nLorentz did not like the large number of variables in Eddington’s theory; there were 4 components of the electromagnetic potential, 10 components of the metric and 40 components of the connection:\n\n“It may well be asked whether after all it would not be preferable simply to introduce the functions that are necessary for characterising the electromagnetic and gravitational fields, without encumbering the theory with so great a number of superfluous quantities.” ([211], p. 382)\n\n4.3.2 Einstein’s reaction and publications\n\nEddington’s publication early in 1921, generalising Einstein’s and Weyl’s theories started a new direction of research both in physics and mathematics. At first, Einstein seems to have been reserved (cf. his letters to Weyl in June and September 1921 quoted by Stachel in his article on Eddington and Einstein ([330], pp. 453–475; here p. 466)), but one and a half years later he became attracted by Eddington’s idea. To Bohr, Einstein wrote from Singapore on 11 January 1923:\n\n“I believe I have finally understood the connection between electricity and gravitation. Eddington has come closer to the truth than Weyl.” ([139], p. 274)\n\nHe now tried to make Eddington’s theory work as a physical theory; Eddington had not given field equations:\n\n“I must absolutely publish since Eddington’s idea must be thought through to the end.” (letter of Einstein to Weyl of 23 May 1923; cf. [241], p. 343)\n\nAnd a few days later, he was still intrigued about this sort of unified field theory, in particular about its elusiveness: “[…] Over it lingers the marble smile of inexorable nature, which has bestowed on us more longing than brains.”Footnote 108 (letter of Einstein to Weyl of 26 May 1923; cf.[241], p. 343) And indeed Einstein published fast, even while still on the steamer returning from Japan through Palestine and Spain: The paper of February 1923 in the reports of the Berlin Academy carries, as location of the sender, the ship “Haruna Maru” of the Japanese Nippon Yushen Kaisha lineFootnote 109 [77].\n\n“In past years, the wish to understand the gravitational and electromagnetic field as one in essence has dominated the endeavours of theoreticians. […] From a purely logical point of view only the connection should be used as a fundamental quantity, and the metric as a quantity derived thereof […] Eddington has done this.”Footnote 110 ([77], p. 32)\n\nLike Eddington, Einstein used a symmetric connection and wrote down the equationFootnote 111\n\n$$ {\\lambda ^2}{K_{kl}} = {g_{kl}} + {\\phi _{kl}}, $$\n\n((119))\n\nwhere gkl=g(kl) and φkl=φ[kl], and λ is a “large number”. By this, the metric was defined as the symmetric part of the Ricci tensor. Due to\n\n$$ {\\phi _{kl}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( {\\frac{{\\partial {\\Gamma _{kj}}^j}}{{\\partial {x^l}}} - \\frac{{\\partial {\\Gamma _{lj}}^j}}{{\\partial {x^k}}}} \\right) $$\n\n((120))\n\none half of Maxwell’s equations is satisfied if φkl is taken to be the electromagnetic field tensor. Let us note, however, that while \\({{\\Gamma _{kj}}^j}\\) transforms inhomogeneously, its transformation law\n\n$$ {\\Gamma _{k'j'}}^{j'} = {\\Gamma _{lm}}^m\\frac{{\\partial {x^l}}}{{\\partial {x^{k'}}}} + \\frac{{{\\partial ^2}{x^{l'}}}}{{\\partial {x^{k'}}\\partial {x^{m'}}}} \\cdot \\frac{{\\partial {x^{m'}}}}{{\\partial {x^{l'}}}} $$\n\nis not exactly the same as that of the electric 4-potential under gauge transformations.\n\nFor a Lagrangian, Einstein used \\({\\mathcal L} = 2\\sqrt { - \\det \\;{K_{ij}}} ;\\); he claims that for vanishing electromagnetic field the vacuum field equations of general relativity, with the cosmological term included, hold. Einstein varied with regard to gkl and σkl, not, as one might have expected, with regard to the connection \\({\\Gamma _{kj}}^j\\). If \\({\\hat f^{kl}}: = \\tfrac{{\\delta {\\mathcal L}}}{{\\delta {\\phi _{kl}}}}\\), then the electric current density jl is defined by \\({{\\hat \\jmath}^l}: = \\tfrac{{\\partial {{\\hat f}^{kl}}}}{{\\partial {x^k}}}\\). \\({\\hat f^{kl}}\\) is interpreted as “the contravariant tensor of the electromagnetic field”.\n\nThe fie"
