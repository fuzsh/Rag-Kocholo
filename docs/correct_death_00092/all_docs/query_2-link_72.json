HENDERSON, PH.D., L.H.D.\n\nAuthor of A History of Germany in the Middle Ages; A Short History of\n\nGermany, etc.\n\nIt is difficult to assign to Gustav Freytag his exact niche in the hall of fame, because of his many-sidedness. He wrote one novel of which the statement has been made by an eminent French critic that no book in the German language, with the exception of the Bible, has enjoyed in its day so wide a circulation; he wrote one comedy which for years was more frequently played than any other on the German stage; he wrote a series of historical sketches—Pictures of the German Past he calls them—which hold a unique place in German literature, being as charming in style as they are sound in scholarship. Add to these a work on the principles of dramatic criticism that is referred to with respect by the very latest writers on the subject, an important biography, a second very successful novel, and a series of six historical romances that vary in interest, indeed, but that are a noble monument to his own nation and that, alone, would have made him famous.\n\nAs a novelist Freytag is often compared with Charles Dickens, largely on account of the humor that so frequently breaks forth from his pages. It is a different kind of humor, not so obstreperous, not so exaggerated, but it helps to lighten the whole in much the same way. One moment it is an incongruous simile, at another a bit of sly satire; now infinitely small things are spoken of as though they were great, and again we have the reverse.\n\nIt is in his famous comedy, The Journalists, which appeared in 1853, that Freytag displays his humor to its best advantage. Some of the situations themselves, without being farcical, are exceedingly amusing, as when the Colonel, five minutes after declaiming against the ambition of journalists and politicians, and enumerating the different forms under which it is concealed, lets his own ambition run away with him and is won by the very same arts he has just been denouncing. Again, Bolz's capture of the wine-merchant Piepenbrink at the ball given under the auspices of the rival party is very cleverly described indeed. There is a difference of opinion as to whether or not Bolz was inventing the whole dramatic story of his rescue by Oldendorf, but there can be no difference of opinion as to the comicality of the scene that follows, where, under the very eyes of his rivals and with the consent of the husband, Bolz prepares to kiss Mrs. Piepenbrink. The play abounds with curious little bits of satire, quaint similes and unexpected exaggerations. \"There is so much that happens,\" says Bolz in his editorial capacity, \"and so tremendously much that does not happen, that an honest reporter should never be at a loss for novelties.\" Playing dominoes with polar bears, teaching seals the rudiments of journalism, waking up as an owl with tufts of feathers for ears and a mouse in one's beak, are essentially Freytagian conceptions; and no one else could so well have expressed Bolz's indifference to further surprises—they may tell him if they will that some one has left a hundred millions for the purpose of painting all negroes white, or of making Africa four-cornered; but he, Bolz, has reached a state of mind where he will accept as truth anything and everything.\n\nFreytag's greatest novel, entitled Soll und Haben (the technical commercial terms for \"debit\" and \"credit\"), appeared in 1856. Dombey and Son by Dickens had been published a few years before and is worth our attention for a moment because of a similarity of theme in the two works. In both, the hero is born of the people, but comes in contact with the aristocracy not altogether to his own advantage; in both, looming in the background of the story, is the great mercantile house with its vast and mysterious transactions. The writer of this short article does not hesitate to place Debit and Credit far ahead of Dombey and Son. That does not mean that there are not single episodes, and occasionally a character, in Dombey and Son that the German author could never have achieved. But, considered as an artistic whole, the English novel is so disjointed and uneven that the interest often flags and almost dies, while many of the characters are as grotesque and wooden as so many jumping-jacks. In Freytag's work, on the other hand, the different parts are firmly knitted together; an ethical purpose runs through the whole, and there is a careful subordination of the individual characters to the general plan of the whole structure. It is much the same contrast as that between an old-fashioned Italian opera and a modern German tone-drama. In the one case the effects are made through senseless repetition and through tours de force of the voice; in the other there is a steady progression in dramatic intensity, link joining link without a gap.\n\nBut to say that Debit and Credit is a finer book than Dombey and Son is not to claim that Freytag, all in all, is a greater novelist than Dickens. The man of a single fine book would have to be superlatively great to equal one who could show such fertility in creation of characters or produce such masterpieces of description. Dickens reaches heights of passion to which Freytag could never aspire; in fact the latter's temperament strikes one as rather a cool one. Even Spielhagen, far inferior to him in many regards, could thrill where Freytag merely interests.\n\nFreytag's forte lay in fidelity of depiction, in the power to ascertain and utilize essential facts. It would not be fair to say that he had little imagination, for in the parts of The Ancestors that have to do with remote times, times of which our whole knowledge is gained from a few paragraphs in old chronicles and where the scenes and incidents have to be invented, he is at his best. But one of his great merits lies in his evident familiarity with the localities mentioned in the pages as well as with the social environment of his personages. The house of T.D. Schröter in Debit and Credit had its prototype in the house of Molinari in Breslau, and at the Molinaris Freytag was a frequent visitor. Indeed in the company of the head of the firm he even undertook just such a journey to the Polish provinces in troubled times as he makes Anton take with Schröter. Again, the life in the newspaper office, so amusingly depicted in The Journalists, was out of the fulness of his own experience as editor of a political sheet. A hundred little natural touches thus add to the realism of the whole and make the figures, as a German critic says, \"stand out like marble statues against a hedge of yew.\" The reproach has been made that many of Freytag's characters are too much alike. He has distinct types which repeat themselves both in the novels and in the plays. George Saalfeld in Valentine, for instance, is strikingly like Bolz in The Journalists or Fink in Debit and Credit. Freytag's answer to such objections was that an author, like any other artist, must work from models, which he is not obliged constantly to change. The feeling for the solidarity of the arts was very strong with him. He practically abandoned writing for the stage just after achieving his most noted success and merely for the reason that in poetic narration, as he called it, he saw the possibility of being still more dramatic. He felt hampered by the restrictions which the necessarily limited length of an evening's performance placed upon him, and wished more time and space for the explanation of motives and the development of his plot. In his novel, then, he clung to exactly the same arrangement of his theme as in his drama—its initial presentation, the intensification of the interest, the climax, the revulsion, the catastrophe. Again, in the matter of contrast he deliberately followed the lead of the painter who knows which colors are complementary and also which ones will clash.\n\n[Illustration: GUSTAV FREYTAG. STAUFFER-BERN]\n\nWhat, now, are some of the special qualities that have made Freytag's literary work so enduring, so dear to the Teuton heart, so successful in every sense of the word? For one thing, there are a clearness, conciseness and elegance of style, joined to a sort of musical rhythm, that hold one captive from the beginning. So evident is his meaning in every sentence that his pages suffer less by translation than is the case with almost any other author.\n\nFreytag's highly polished sentences seem perfectly spontaneous, though we know that he went through a long period of rigid training before achieving success. \"For five years,\" he himself writes, \"I had pursued the secret of dramatic style; like the child in the fairy-tale I had sought it from the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars. At length I had found it: my soul could create securely and comfortably after the manner which the stage itself demanded.\" He had found it, we are given to understand, in part through the study of the French dramatists of his own day of whom Scribe was one just then in vogue. From them, says a critic, he learned \"lightness of touch, brevity, conciseness, directness, the use of little traits as a means of giving insight into character, different ways of keeping the interest at the proper point of tension, and a thousand little devices for clearing the stage of superfluous figures or making needed ones appear at the crucial moment.\" Among his tricks of style, if we may call them so, are inversion and elision; by the one he puts the emphasis just where he wishes, by the other he hastens the action without sacrificing the meaning. Another of his weapons is contrast—grave and gay, high and low succeed each other rapidly, while vice and virtue follow suit.\n\nNo writer ever trained himself for his work more consciously and consistently. He experimented with each play, watched its effect on his audiences, asked himself seriously whether their apparent want of interest in this or that portion was due to some defect in his work or to their own obtuseness. He had failures, but remarkably few, and they did not discourage him; nor did momentary success in one field prevent him from abandoning it for another in which he hoped to accomplish greater things. He is his own severest critic, and in his autobiography speaks of certain productions as worthless which are only relatively wanting in merit.\n\nFreytag's orderly treatment of his themes affords constant pleasure to the reader. He proceeds as steadily toward his climax as the builder does toward the highest point of his roof. He had learned much about climaxes, so he tells us himself, from Walter Scott, who was the first to see the importance of a great final or concluding effect.\n\nWe have touched as yet merely on externals. Elegance of style, orderliness of arrangement, consecutiveness of thought alone would never have given Freytag his place in German literature. All these had first to be consecrated to the service of a great idea. That idea as expressed in Debit and Credit is that the hope of the German nation rests in its steady commercial or working class. He shows the dignity, yes, the poetry of labor. The nation had failed to secure the needed political reforms, to the bitter disappointment of numerous patriots; Freytag's mission was to teach that there were other things worth while besides these constitutional liberties of which men had so long dreamed and for which they had so long struggled.\n\nIncidentally he holds the decadent noble up to scorn, and shows how he still clings to his old pretensions while their very basis is crumbling under him. It is a new and active life that Freytag advocates, one of toil and of routine, but one that in the end will give the highest satisfaction. Such ideas were products of the revolution of 1848, and they found the ground prepared for them by that upheaval. Freytag, as Fichte had done in 1807 and 1808, inaugurated a campaign of education which was to prove enormously successful. A French critic writes of Debit and Credit that it was \"the breviary in which a whole generation of Germans learned to read and to think,\" while an English translator (three translations of the book appeared in England in the same year) calls it the Uncle Tom's Cabin of the German workingman. A German critic is furious that a work of such real literary merit should be compared to one so flat and insipid as Mrs. Stowe's production; but he altogether misses the point, which is the effect on the people of a spirited defense of those who had hitherto had no advocate.\n\nFreytag has been called an opportunist, but the term should not be considered one of reproach. It certainly was opportune that his great work appeared at the moment when it was most needed, a moment of discouragement, of disgust at everything high and low. It brought its smiling message and remained to cheer and comfort. The Journalists, too, was opportune, for it called attention to a class of men whose work was as important as it was unappreciated. Up to 1848, the year of the revolution, the press had been under such strict censorship that any frank discussion of public matters had been out of the question. But since then distinguished writers, like Freytag himself, had taken the helm. Even when not radical, they were dreaded by the reactionaries, and even Freytag escaped arrest in Prussia only by hastily becoming a court official of his friend the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha—within whose domains he already owned an estate and was in the habit of residing for a portion of each year—and thus renouncing his Prussian citizenship. Even Freytag's Pictures from the German Past may be said to have been opportune. Already, for a generation, the new school of scientific historians—the Rankes, the Wattenbachs, the Waitzs, the Giesebrechts—had been piling up their discoveries, and collating and publishing manuscripts describing the results of their labors. They lived on too high a plane for the ordinary reader. Freytag did not attempt to \"popularize\" them by cheap methods. He served as an interpreter between the two extremes. He chose a type of facts that would have seemed trivial to the great pathfinders, worked them up with care from the sources, and by his literary art made them more than acceptable to the world at large. In these Pictures from the German Past, as in the six volumes of the series of historical romances entitled The Ancestors, a patriotic purpose was not wanting. Freytag wished to show his Germans that they had a history to be proud of, a history whose continuity was unbroken; the nation had been through great vicissitudes, but everything had tended to prove that the German has an inexhaustible fund of reserve force. Certain national traits, certain legal institutions, could be followed back almost to the dawn of history, and it would be found that the Germans of the first centuries of our era were not nearly so barbarous as had been supposed.\n\nAnd so with a wonderful talent for selecting typical and essential facts and not overburdening his narrative with detail he leads us down the ages. The hero of his introductory romance in The Ancestors is a Vandal chieftain who settles among the Thuringians at the time of the great wandering of the nations—the hero of the last of the series is a journalist of the nineteenth century. All are descendants of the one family, and Freytag has a chance to develop some of his theories of heredity. Not only can bodily aptitudes and mental peculiarities be transmitted, but also the tendency to act in a given case much as the ancestor would have done.\n\nIt cannot be denied that as Freytag proceeds with The Ancestors the tendency to instruct and inform becomes too marked. He had begun his career in the world by lecturing on literature at the University of Breslau, but had severed his connection with that institution because he was not allowed to branch out into history. Possibly those who opposed him were right and the two subjects are incapable of amalgamation. Freytag in this, his last great work, revels in the fulness of his knowledge of facts, but shows more of the thoroughness of the scholar than of the imagination of the poet. The novels become epitomes of the history of the time. No type of character may be omitted. So popes and emperors, monks and missionaries, German warriors and Roman warriors, minstrels and students, knights, crusaders, colonists, landskechts, and mercenaries are dragged in and made to do their part with all too evident fidelity to truth.\n\nWe owe much of our knowledge of Freytag's life to a charming autobiography which served as a prefatory volume to his collected works. Freytag lived to a ripe old age, dying in 1895 at the age of seventy-nine. Both as a newspaper editor and as a member of parliament (the former from 1848 to 1860, the latter for the four years from 1867 to 1871) he had shown his patriotism and his interest in public affairs. Many of his numerous essays, written for the Grenzboten, are little masterpieces and are to be found among his collected works published in 1888. As a member of parliament, indeed, he showed no marked ability and his name is associated with no important measure.\n\nNot to conceal his shortcoming it must be said that Freytag, at the time of the accession to the throne of the present head of the German Empire, laid himself open to much censure by attacking the memory of the dead Emperor Frederick who had always been his friend and patron.\n\nIn conclusion it may be said that no one claims for Freytag a place in the front rank of literary geniuses. He is no Goethe, no Schiller, no Dante, no Milton, no Shakespeare. He is not a pioneer, has not changed the course of human thought. But yet he is an artist of whom his country may well be proud, who has added to the happiness of hundreds of thousands of Germans, and who only needs to be better understood to be thoroughly enjoyed by foreigners.\n\nEngland and America have much to learn from him—the value of long, careful, and unremitting study; the advantage of being thoroughly familiar with the scenes and types of character depicted; the charm of an almost unequaled simplicity and directness. He possessed the rare gift of being able to envelop every topic that he touched with an atmosphere of elegance and distinction. His productions are not ephemeral, but are of the kind that will endure.\n\n* * * * *\n\nGUSTAV FREYTAG\n\n* * * * *\n\n#THE JOURNALISTS#\n\nDRAMATIS PERSONÆ\n\nBERG, retired Colonel.\n\nIDA, his daughter.\n\nADELAIDE RUNECK.\n\nSENDEN, landed proprietor.\n\n_\n\nPROFESSOR OLDENDORF, editor-in-chief. |\n\n|\n\nCONRAD BOLZ, editor. |\n\n|\n\nBELLMAUS, on the staff.. |\n\n|\n\nKÄMPE, on the staff. } of the newspaper\n\n| The Union.\n\nKÖRNER, on the staff. |\n\n|\n\nPRINTER HENNING, owner. |\n\n|\n\nMILLER, factotum. _|\n\n_\n\nBLUMENBERG, editor. |\n\n} of the newspaper\n\nSCHMOCK, on the staff. _| Coriolanus.\n\nPIEPENBRINK, wine merchant and voter.\n\nLOTTIE, his wife.\n\nBERTHA, their daughter.\n\nKLEINMICHEL citizen and voter.\n\nFRITZ, his son.\n\nJUDGE SCHWARZ.\n\nA foreign ballet-dancer.\n\nKORB, secretary for Adelaide's estate.\n\nCARL, the Colonel's man-servant.\n\nA waiter.\n\nClub-guests.

HENDERSON, PH.D., L.H.D.\n\nACT I\n\nSCENE I\n\nA summer parlor in the COLONEL'S house. Handsome furnishings. In the centre of rear wall an open door, behind it a verandah and garden; on the sides of rear wall large windows. Right and left, doors; on the right, well in front, a window. Tables, chairs, a small sofa.\n\nIDA is sitting in front on the right reading a book. The COLONEL enters through centre door with an open box in his hand in which are dahlias.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nHere, Ida, are the new varieties of dahlias our gardener has grown. You'll have to rack your brains to find names for them. Day after tomorrow is the Horticultural Society meeting, when I am to exhibit and christen them.\n\nIDA.\n\nThis light-colored one here should be called the \"Adelaide.\"\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nAdelaide Buneck, of course. Your own name is out of the running, for as a little dahlia you have long been known to the flower-trade.\n\nIDA.\n\nOne shall be called after your favorite writer, \"Boz.\"\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nSplendid! And it must be a really fine one, this yellow one here with violet points. And the third one—how shall we christen that?\n\nIDA (stretching out her hand entreatingly to her father).\n\n\"Edward Oldendorf.\"\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nWhat! The professor? The editor? Oh no, that will not do! It was bad enough for him to take over the paper; but that he now has allowed himself to be led by his party into running for Parliament—that I can never forgive him.\n\nIDA.\n\nHere he comes himself.\n\nCOLONEL (aside).\n\nIt used to be a pleasure to me to hear his footstep; now I can hardly keep from being rude when I see him.\n\nEnter OLDENDORF.\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nGood morning, Colonel!\n\nIDA (with a friendly greeting).\n\nGood morning, Edward. Help me to admire the new dahlias that father has grown.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nBut do not trouble the professor. Such trifles no longer interest him; he has bigger things in his head.\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nAt all events I have not lost my ability to enjoy what gives you pleasure.\n\nCOLONEL (grumbling to himself).\n\nYou have not given me much proof of that. I fear you take pleasure in doing the very things that vex me. You are doubtless quite busy now with your election, Mr. Future Member of Parliament!\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nYou know, Colonel, that I myself have less than any one else to do with it.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nOh, I don't believe that! It is the usual custom in such elections, I imagine, to pay court to influential persons and shake hands with the voters, to make speeches, scatter promises, and do all the other little devil's tricks.\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nYou yourself do not believe, Colonel, that I would do anything discreditable?\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nNot? I am not so sure, Oldendorf. Since you have turned journalist, edit your Union and daily reproach the State with its faulty organization, you are no longer what you used to be.\n\nOLDENDORF (who up to this point has been conversing with IDA about the flowers, but now turns to the COLONEL).\n\nDoes what I now say or write conflict with my former views? It would be hard to convince me of that. And still less can you have noticed any change in my feelings or in my conduct toward you.\n\nCOLONEL (obdurate).\n\nWell, I don't see what reason you would have for that. I am not going to spoil my morning by quarreling. Ida may try to straighten things out with you. I am going to my flowers. [Takes the box and exit toward the garden.]\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nWhat has put your father in such a bad humor? Has something in the newspaper vexed him again?\n\nIDA.\n\nI do not think so. But it annoys him that now in politics you again find it necessary to advocate measures he detests and attack institutions he reveres. (Shyly.) Edward, is it really impossible for you to withdraw from the election?\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nIt is impossible.\n\nIDA.\n\nI should then have you here, and father could regain his good humor; for he would highly appreciate the sacrifice you were making for him, and we could look forward to a future as peaceful as our past has been.\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nI know that, Ida, and I feel anything but pleasure at the prospect of becoming member for this town; yet I cannot withdraw.\n\nIDA (turning away).\n\nFather is right. You have changed entirely since becoming editor of the paper.\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nIda! You too! If this is going to cause discord between us I shall indeed feel badly.\n\nIDA.\n\nDear Edward! I am only grieving at losing you for so long.\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nI am not yet elected. If I do become member and can have my way, I will take you to the capital and never let you leave my side again.\n\nIDA.\n\nAh, Edward, we can't think of that now! But do spare father.\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nYou know how much I stand from him; and I don't give up hope of his becoming reconciled to me. The election once over, I will make another appeal to his heart. I may wrest from him a favorable answer that will mean our marriage.\n\nIDA.\n\nBut do humor his little foibles. He is in the garden near his dahlia bed; express your delight over the gay colors. If you go at it skilfully enough perhaps he may still call one the \"Edward Oldendorf.\" We have been talking of it already. Come! [Exeunt both.]\n\nEnter SENDEN, BLUMENBERG, CARL, SCHMOCK.\n\nSENDEN (entering).\n\nIs the Colonel alone?\n\nCARL.\n\nProfessor Oldendorf is with him.\n\nSENDEN.\n\nTake in our names. [Exit CARL.] This everlasting Oldendorf! I say, Blumenberg, this connection of the old gentleman with the Union must stop. We cannot really call him one of us so long as the professor frequents this house. We need the Colonel's influential personality.\n\nBLUMENBERG.\n\nIt is the best-known house in town—the best society, good wine, and art.\n\nSENDEN.\n\nI have my private reasons, too, for bringing the Colonel over to our side. And everywhere the professor and his clique block our way.\n\nBLUMENBERG.\n\nThe friendship shall cease. I promise you that it shall cease, gradually, within the next few weeks. The first step has already been taken. The gentlemen of the Union have fallen into the trap.\n\nSENDEN.\n\nInto what trap?\n\nBLUMENBERG.\n\nThe one I set for them in our paper. [Turning upon SCHMOCK who is standing in the doorway.] Why do you stand here, Schmock? Can't you wait at the gate?\n\nSCHMOCK.\n\nI went where you did. Why should I not stand here? I know the Colonel as well as you do.\n\nBLUMENBERG.\n\nDon't be forward and don't be impudent. Go and wait at the gate, and when I bring you the article, quickly run with it to the press—understand?\n\nSCHMOCK.\n\nHow can I help understanding when you croak like a raven?\n\n[EXIT.]\n\n[Illustration: Permission F Bruckmann, A -G, Munich\n\nAT THE CONCERT ADOLPH VON MENZEL.]\n\nBLUMENBERG (to SENDEN).\n\nHe is a vulgar person, but he is useful! Now that we are alone, listen! The other day when you brought me to call here, I begged the Colonel just to write down his ideas on the questions of the day.\n\nSENDEN.\n\nYes, alas! You piled on the flattery much too thick, but the old gentleman did, nevertheless, at last take fire.\n\nBLUMENBERG.\n\nWe begged him to read to us what he had written; he read it to us, we praised it.\n\nSENDEN.\n\nIt was very tiresome all the same.\n\nBLUMENBERG.\n\nI begged it of him for our paper.\n\nSENDEN.\n\nYes, unfortunately! And now I must carry these bulky things to your press. These articles are too heavy; they won't do the Coriolanus any good.\n\nBLUMENBERG.\n\nYet I printed them gladly. When a man has written for a paper he becomes a good friend of that paper. The Colonel at once subscribed for the Coriolanus, and, the next day, invited me to dinner.\n\nSENDEN (shrugging his shoulders).\n\nIf that is all you gain by it!\n\nBLUMENBERG.\n\nIt is merely the beginning.—The articles are clumsy; why should I not say so?\n\nSENDEN.\n\nGod knows they are!\n\nBLUMENBERG.\n\nAnd no one knows who the author is.\n\nSENDEN.\n\nThat was the old gentleman's stipulation. I imagine he is afraid of\n\nOldendorf.\n\nBLUMENBERG.\n\nAnd precisely what I anticipated has come to pass. Oldendorf's paper has today attacked these articles. Here is the latest issue of the Union.\n\nSENDEN.\n\nLet me look at it. Well, that will be a fine mix-up! Is the attack insulting?\n\nBLUMENBERG.\n\nThe Colonel will be sure to consider it so. Don't you think that that will help us against the professor?\n\nSENDEN.\n\nUpon my honor you are the slyest devil that ever crept out of an inkstand!\n\nBLUMENBERG.\n\nGive it to me, the Colonel is coming. Enter the COLONEL.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nGood morning, gentlemen!—[aside] and that Oldendorf should just happen to be here! If only he will remain in the garden! Well, Mr. Editor, how is the Coriolanus?\n\nBLUMENBERG.\n\nOur readers admire the new articles marked with an arrow. Is there any chance that some more—\n\nCOLONEL (drawing a manuscript from his pocket and looking round).\n\nI rely on your discretion. As a matter of fact I wanted to read it through again on account of the structure of the sentences.\n\nBLUMENBERG.\n\nThat can best be done in the proof-reading.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nI think it will do. Take it; but not a word—\n\nBLUMENBERG.\n\nYou will let me send it at once to press. [At the door.] Schmock!\n\n[SCHMOCK appears at the door, takes the manuscript and exit quickly.]\n\nSENDEN.\n\nBlumenberg is keeping the sheet up to the mark, but, as he has enemies, he has to fight hard to defend himself.\n\nCOLONEL (amused).\n\nEnemies? Who does not have them? But journalists have nerves like women. Everything excites you; every word that any one says against you rouses your indignation! Oh come, you are sensitive people!\n\nBLUMENBERG.\n\nPossibly you are right, Colonel. But when one has opponents like this Union—\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nOh, yes, the Union. It is a thorn in the flesh to both of you. There is a great deal in it that I cannot praise; but, really when it comes to sounding an alarm, attacking, and pitching in, it is cleverer than your paper. The articles are witty; even when they are on the wrong side one cannot help laughing at them.\n\nBLUMENBERG.\n\nNot always. In today's attack on the best articles the Coriolanus has published in a long time I see no wit at all.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nAttack on what articles?\n\nBLUMENBERG.\n\nOn yours, Colonel. I must have the paper somewhere about me.\n\n[Searches, and gives him a copy of the Union.]\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nOldendorf's paper attacks my articles! [Reads.] \"We regret such lack of knowledge—\"\n\nBLUMENBERG.\n\nAnd here—\n\nCOLONEL.\n\n\"It is an unpardonable piece of presumption\"—What! I am presumptuous?\n\nBLUMENBERG.\n\nAnd here—\n\nCOLONEL.\n\n\"One may be in doubt as to whether the naïveté of the contributor is comical or tragical, but at all events he has no right to join in the discussion\"—[Throwing down the paper.] Oh, that is contemptible! It is a low trick!\n\nEnter IDA and OLDENDORF from the garden.\n\nSENDEN (aside).\n\nNow comes the cloud-burst!\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nProfessor, your newspaper is making progress. To bad principles is now added something else—baseness.\n\nIDA (frightened).\n\nFather!\n\nOLDENDORF (coming forward).\n\nColonel, how can you justify this insulting expression?\n\nCOLONEL (holding out the paper to him).\n\nLook here! That stands in your paper! In your paper, Oldendorf!\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nThe tone of the attack is not quite as calm as I could have wished—\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nNot quite so calm? Not really?\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nIn substance the attack is justified.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nSir! You dare say that to me!\n\nIDA.\n\nFather!\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nColonel, I do not comprehend this attitude, and I beg you to consider that we are speaking before witnesses.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nDo not ask for any consideration. It would have been your place to show consideration for the man whose friendship you are otherwise so ready to claim.\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nBut, first of all, tell me frankly what is your own connection with the articles attacked in the Coriolanus?\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nA very chance connection, too insignificant in your eyes to deserve your regard. The articles are by me!\n\nIDA.\n\nHeavens!\n\nOLDENDORF (vehemently).\n\nBy you? Articles in the paper of this gentleman?\n\nIDA (entreating him).\n\nEdward!\n\nOLDENDORF (more calmly).\n\nThe Union has attacked not you but an unknown person, who to us was merely a partisan of this gentleman. You would have spared us both this painful scene had you not concealed from me the fact that you are a correspondent of the Coriolanus.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nYou will have to stand my continuing not to make you a confidant of my actions. You have here given me a printed proof of your friendship, which does not make me long for other proofs.\n\nOLDENDORF (taking up his hat).\n\nI can only say that I deeply regret the occurrence, but do not feel myself in the least to blame. I hope, Colonel, that, when you think the matter over calmly, you will come to the same conclusion. Good-by, Miss Ida. Good day to you.\n\n[Exit as far as centre door.]\n\nIDA (entreating).\n\nFather, don't let him leave us that way!\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nIt is better than to have him stay.\n\nEnter ADELAIDE.\n\nADELAIDE (entering in elegant traveling costume, meets OLDENDORF at the door).\n\nNot so fast, Professor!\n\n[OLDENDORF kisses her hand and leaves.]\n\nIDA. }(together Adelaide! [Falls into her arms.]).\n\nCOLONEL. } Adelaide! And at such a moment!\n\nADELAIDE (holding IDA fast and stretching out her hand to the\n\nCOLONEL).\n\nShake hands with your compatriot. Aunt sends love, and Rosenau Manor, in its brown autumn dress, presents its humble compliments. The fields lie bare, and in the garden the withered leaves dance with the wind.—Ah, Mr. von Senden!\n\nCOLONEL (introducing).\n\nMr. Blumenberg, the editor.\n\nSENDEN.\n\nWe are delighted to welcome our zealous agriculturist to the city.\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nAnd we should have been pleased occasionally to meet our neighbor in the country.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nHe has a great deal to do here. He is a great politician, and works hard for the good cause.\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nYes, indeed, we read of his doings in the newspaper. I drove through your fields yesterday. Your potatoes are not all in yet. Your steward didn't get through with the work.\n\nSENDEN.\n\nYou Rosenau people are privileged to get through a week earlier than any one else.\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nOn the other hand, we have nothing to do but to farm. (Amicably.)\n\nThe neighbors send greetings.\n\nSENDEN.\n\nThank you. We must relinquish you now to friends who have more claim on you than we have. But will you not receive me in the course of the day so that I can ask for the news from home? [ADELAIDE inclines her head.]\n\nSENDEN.\n\nGood-by, Colonel. (To IDA.) My respectful compliments, Miss Berg.\n\n[Exit together with BLUMENBERG.]\n\nIDA (embracing ADELAIDE).\n\nI have you at last. Now everything will be all right!\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nWhat is to be all right? Is anything not all right? Back there some one passed me more quickly than usual, and here I see glistening eyes and a furrowed brow. [Kisses her on the eyes.] They shall not ruin your pretty eyes. And you, honored friend, turn a more friendly countenance to me.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nYou must stay with us all winter; it will be the first you have given us in a long time; we shall try to deserve such a favor.\n\nADELAIDE (seriously).\n\nIt is the first one since my father's death that I have cared to mingle with the world again. Besides, I have business that calls me here. You know I came of age this summer, and my legal friend, Judge Schwarz, requires my presence. Listen, Ida, the servants are unpacking, go and see that things are properly put away. (Aside.) And put a damp cloth over your eyes for people can see that you have been crying. [Exit IDA to the right. ADELAIDE quickly goes up to the COLONEL.] What is the matter with Ida and the professor?\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nThat would be a long story. I shall not spoil my pleasure with it now.\n\nWe men are at odds; our views are too opposed.\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nBut were not your views opposed before this, too? And yet you were on such good terms with Oldendorf!\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nThey were not so extremely opposed as now.\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nAnd which of you has changed his views?\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nH'm! Why, he, of course. He is led astray in great part by his evil companions. There are some men, journalists on his paper, and especially there is a certain Bolz.\n\nADELAIDE (aside).\n\nWhat's this I hear?\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nBut probably you know him yourself. Why, he comes from your neighborhood.\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nHe is a Rosenau boy.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nI remember. Your father, the good old general, could not endure him.\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nAt least he sometimes said so.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nSince then this Bolz has become queer. His mode of life is said to be irregular, and I fear his morals are pretty loose. He is Oldendorf's evil genius.\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nThat would be a pity!—No, I do not believe it!\n\nCOLONEL. What do you not believe, Adelaide?\n\nADELAIDE (smiling).\n\nI do not believe in evil geniuses. What has gone wrong between you and Oldendorf can be set right again. Enemies today, friends tomorrow—that is the way in politics; but Ida's feelings will not change so quickly. Colonel, I have brought with me a beautiful design for a dress. That new dress I mean to wear this winter as bridesmaid.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nNo chance of it! You can't catch me that way, girl. I'll carry the war into the enemy's country. Why do you drive other people to the altar and let your own whole neighborhood joke you about being the Sleeping Beauty and the virgin farmer?\n\nADELAIDE (laughing).\n\nWell, so they do.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nThe richest heiress in the whole district! Courted by a host of adorers, yet so firmly intrenched against all sentiment; no one can comprehend it.\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nMy dear Colonel, if our young gentlemen were as lovable as certain older ones—but, alas! they are not.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nYou shan't escape me. We shall hold you fast in town, until we find one among our young men whom you will deem worthy to be enrolled under your command. For whoever be your chosen husband, he will have the same experience I have had—namely, that, first or last, he will have to do your bidding.\n\nADELAIDE (quickly).\n\nWill you do my bidding with regard to Ida and the professor? Now I have you!\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nWill you do me the favor of choosing your husband this winter while you are with us? Yes? Now I have you!\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nIt's a bargain! Shake hands! [Holds out her hand to him.]\n\nCOLONEL (puts his hand in hers, laughing).\n\nWell, you're outwitted.\n\n[Exit through centre door.]\n\nADELAIDE (alone).\n\nI don't think I am. What, Mr. Conrad Bolz! Is that your reputation among people! You live an irregular life? You have loose morals? You are an evil genius?—\n\nEnter KORB.\n\nKORB (through the centre door with a package).\n\nWhere shall I put the account-books and the papers, Miss Adelaide?\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nIn my apartment. Tell me, dear Korb, did you find your room here in order?\n\nKORB.\n\nIn the finest order. The servant has given me two wax candles; it is pure extravagance.\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nYou need not touch a pen for me this whole day. I want you to see the town and look up your acquaintances. You have acquaintances here, I suppose?\n\nKORB.\n\nNot very many. It is more than a year since I was last here.\n\nADELAIDE (indifferently).\n\nBut are there no people from Rosenau here?\n\nKORB.\n\nAmong the soldiers are four from the village. There is John Lutz of\n\nSchimmellutz—\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nI know. Have you no other acquaintance here from the village?\n\nKORB.\n\nNone at all, except him, of course—\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nExcept him? Whom do you mean?\n\nKORB.\n\nWhy, our Mr. Conrad.\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nOh, to be sure! Are you not going to visit him? I thought you had always been good friends.\n\nKORB.\n\nGoing to visit him? That is the first place I am going to. I have been looking forward to it during the whole journey. He is a faithful soul of whom the village has a right to be proud.\n\nADELAIDE (warmly).\n\nYes, he has a faithful heart.\n\nKORB (eagerly).\n\nEver merry, ever friendly, and so attached to the village! Poor man, it is a long time since he was there!\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nDon't speak of it!\n\nKORB.\n\nHe will ask me about everything—about the farming—\n\nADELAIDE (eagerly).\n\nAnd about the horses. The old sorrel he was so fond of riding is still alive. KORB. And about the shrubs he planted with you.\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nEspecially about the lilac-bush where my arbor now stands. Be sure you tell him about that.\n\nKORB.\n\nAnd about the pond. Three hundred and sixty carp!\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nAnd sixty gold-tench; don't forget that. And the old carp with the copper ring about his body, that he put there, came out with the last haul, and we threw him back again.\n\nKORB.\n\nAnd how he will ask about you, Miss Adelaide!\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nTell him I am well.\n\nKORB.\n\nAnd how you have carried on the farming since the general died; and that you take his newspaper which I read aloud to the farm-hands afterward.\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nJust that you need not tell him. [Sighing, aside.] On these lines I shall learn nothing whatever. [Pause, gravely.] See here, dear Korb, I have heard all sorts of things about Mr. Bolz that surprise me. He is said to live an irregular life.\n\nKORB.\n\nYes, I imagine he does; he always was a wild colt.\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nHe is said to spend more than his income.\n\nKORB.\n\nYes, that is quite possible. But I am perfectly sure he spends it merrily.\n\nADELAIDE (aside).\n\nSmall consolation I shall get from him! (Indifferently.) He has now a good position, I suppose; won't he soon be looking for a wife?\n\nKORB.\n\nA wife? No, he is not doing that. It is impossible.\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nWell, I heard something of the kind; at least he is said to be much interested in a young lady. People are talking of it.\n\nKORB.\n\nWhy, that would be—no, I don't believe it. (Hastily.) But I'll ask him about it at once.\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nWell, he would be the last person to tell you. One learns such things from a man's friends and acquaintances. The village people ought to know it, I suppose, if a Rosenau man marries.\n\nKORB.\n\nOf course they should. I must get at the truth of that.\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nYou would have to go about it the right way. You know how crafty he is.\n\nKORB.\n\nOh, I'll get round him all right. I'll find some way.\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nGo, dear Korb! [Exit KORB.] Those were sad tidings with which the Colonel met me. Conrad—immoral, unworthy? It is impossible! A noble character cannot change to that extent. I do not believe one word of what they say!\n\n[EXIT.]\n\nSCENE II\n\nEditorial room of the \"Union.\" Doors in the centre and on both sides. On the left, in the foreground, a desk with newspapers and documents. On the right, a similar, smaller table. Chairs.\n\nEnter BOLZ, through the side door on the right, then MILLER through the centre door.\n\nBOLZ (eagerly).\n\nMiller! Factotum! Where is the mail?\n\nMILLER (nimbly with a package of letters and newspapers).\n\nHere is the mail, Mr. Bolz; and here, from the press, is the proof-sheet of this evening's issue to be corrected.\n\nBOLZ (at the table on the left quickly opening, looking through, and marking letters with a pencil).\n\nI have already corrected the proof, old rascal!\n\nMILLER.\n\nNot quite. Down here is still the \"Miscellaneous\" which Mr. Bellmaus gave the type-setters.\n\nBOLZ.\n\nLet us have it!\n\n[Reads in the newspaper.]\n\n\"Washing stolen from the yard\"—\"Triplets born\"—\"Concert\"—\"Concert\"—\"Meeting of an Association\"—\"Theatre\"—all in order—\"Newly invented engine\"—\"The great sea-serpent spied.\"\n\n[Jumping up.]\n\nWhat the deuce is this? Is he bringing up the old sea-serpent again? It ought to be cooked into a jelly for him, and he be made to eat it cold.\n\n[Hurries to the door on the right.]\n\nBellmaus, monster, come out!\n\nEnter BELLMAUS.\n\nBELLMAUS (from the right, pen in hand).\n\nWhat is the matter! Why all this noise?\n\nBOLZ (solemnly).\n\nBellmaus, when we did you the honor of intrusting you with the odds and ends for this newspaper, we never expected you to bring the everlasting great sea-serpent writhing through the columns of our journal!—How could you put in that worn-out old lie?\n\nBELLMAUS.\n\nIt just fitted. There were exactly six lines left.\n\nBOLZ.\n\nThat is an excuse, but not a good one. Invent your own stories. What are you a journalist for? Make a little \"Communication,\" an observation, for instance, on human life in general, or something about dogs running around loose in the streets; or choose a bloodcurdling story such as a murder out of politeness, or how a woodchuck bit seven sleeping children, or something of that kind. So infinitely much happens, and so infinitely much does not happen, that an honest newspaper man ought never to be without news.\n\nBELLMAUS.\n\nGive it here, I will change it.\n\n[Goes to the table, looks into a printed sheet, cuts a clipping from it with large shears, and pastes it on the copy of the newspaper.]\n\nBOLZ.\n\nThat's right, my son, so do, and mend thy ways.\n\n[Opening the door on the right.]\n\nKämpe, can you come in a moment? (To MILLER, who is waiting at the door.) Take that proof straight to the press!\n\n[MILLER takes the sheet from BELLMAUS and hurries off.]\n\nEnter KÄMPE.\n\nKÄMPE.\n\nBut I can't write anything decent while you are making such a noise.\n\nBOLZ.\n\nYou can't? What have you just written, then? At most, I imagine, a letter to a ballet-dancer or an order to your tailor.\n\nBELLMAUS.\n\nNo, he writes tender letters. He is seriously in love, for he took me walking in the moonlight yesterday and scorned the idea of a drink.\n\nKÄMPE (who has seated himself comfortably).\n\nGentlemen, it is unfair to call a man away from his work for the sake of making such poor jokes.\n\nBOLZ.\n\nYes, yes, he evidently slanders you when he maintains that you love anything else but your new boots and to some small degree your own person. You yourself are a love-spurting nature, little Bellmaus. You glow like a fusee whenever you see a young lady. Spluttering and smoky you hover around her, and yet don't dare even to address her. But we must be lenient with him; his shyness is to blame. He blushes in woman's presence, and is still capable of lovely emotions, for he started out to be a lyric poet.\n\nBELLMAUS.\n\nI don't care to be continually reproached with my poems. Did I ever read them to you?\n\nBOLZ.\n\nNo, thank Heaven, that audacity you never had. (Seriously.) But, now, gentlemen, to business. Today's number is ready. Oldendorf is not yet here, but meanwhile, let us hold a confidential session. Oldendorf must be chosen deputy from this town to the next Parliament; our party and the Union must put that through. How does our stock stand today?\n\nKÄMPE.\n\nRemarkably high. Our opponents agree that no other candidate would be so dangerous for them, and our friends everywhere are most hopeful. But you know how little that may signify. Here is the list of the voters. Our election committee sends word to you that our calculations were correct. Of the hundred voters from our town, forty surely ours. About an equal number are pledged to the other party; the remnant of some twenty votes are undecided. It is clear that the election will be determined by a very small majority.\n\nBOLZ.\n\nOf course we shall have that majority—a majority of from eight to ten votes. Just say that, everywhere, with the greatest assuredness. Many a one who is still undecided will come over to us on hearing that we are the stronger. Where is the list of our uncertain voters? [Looks it over.]\n\nKÄMPE.\n\nI have placed a mark wherever our friends think some influence might be exerted.\n\nBOLZ.\n\nI see two crosses opposite one name; what do they signify?\n\nKÄMPE.\n\nThat is Piepenbrink, the wine-dealer Piepenbrink. He has a large following in his district, is a well-to-do man, and, they say, can command five or six votes among his adherents.\n\nBOLZ.\n\nHim we must have. What sort of a man is he?\n\nKÄMPE.\n\nHe is very blunt, they say, and no politician at all.\n\nBELLMAUS.\n\nBut he has a pretty daughter.\n\nKÄMPE.\n\nWhat's the use of his pretty daughter? I'd rather he had an ugly wife—one could get at him more easily.\n\nBELLMAUS.\n\nYes, but he has one—a lady with little curls and fiery red ribbons in her cap.\n\nBOLZ.\n\nWife or no wife, the man must be ours. Hush, some one is coming; that is Oldendorf's step. He needn't know anything of our conference. Go to your room, gentlemen. To be continued this evening.\n\nKÄMPE (at the door).\n\nIt is still agreed, I suppose, that in the next number I resume the attack on the new correspondent of the Coriolanus, the one with the arrow.\n\nBOLZ.\n\nYes, indeed. Pitch into him, decently but hard. Just now, on the eve of the election, a little row with our opponents will do us good; and the articles with the arrow give us a great opening.\n\n[Exeunt KÄMPE and BELLMAUS.]\n\nEnter OLDENDORF through centre door.\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nGood-day, Conrad.\n\nBOLZ (at the table on the right, looking over the list of voters).\n\nBlessed be thy coming! The mail is over there; there is nothing of importance.\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nDo you need me here today?\n\nBOLZ.\n\nNo, my darling. This evening's issue is ready. For tomorrow Kämpe is writing the leading article.\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nAbout what?\n\nBOLZ.\n\nA little skirmish with the Coriolanus. Another one against the unknown correspondent with the arrow who attacked our party. But do not worry; I told Kämpe to make the article dignified, very dignified.\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nFor Heaven's sake, don't! The article must not be written.\n\nBOLZ.\n\nI fail to comprehend you. What use are political opponents if you cannot attack them?\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nNow see here! These articles were written by the Colonel; he told me so himself today.\n\nBOLZ.\n\nThunder and lightning!\n\nOLDENDORF (gloomily).\n\nYou may imagine that along with this admission went other intimations which place me just now in a very uncomfortable position as regards the Colonel and his family.\n\nBOLZ (seriously).\n\nAnd what does the Colonel want you to do?\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nHe will be reconciled to me if I resign the editorship of this paper and withdraw as candidate for election.\n\nBOLZ.\n\nThe devil! He is moderate in his demands!\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nI suffer under this discord; to you, as my friend, I can say so.\n\nBOLZ (going up to him and pressing his hand).\n\nSolemn moment of manly emotion!\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nDon't play the clown just now. You can imagine how unpleasant my position in the Colonel's house has become. The worthy old gentleman either frigid or violent; the conversation spiced with bitter allusions; Ida suffering—I can often see that she has been crying. If our party wins and I become member for the town, I fear I shall lose all hope of marrying Ida.\n\nBOLZ (vehemently).\n\nAnd if you withdraw it will be a serious blow to our party. (Rapidly and emphatically.) The coming session of Parliament will determine the fate of the country. The parties are almost equal. Every loss is a blow of a vote to our cause. In this town we have no other candidate but you, who is sufficiently popular to make his election probable. If you withdraw from the contest, no matter what the reason, our opponents win.\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nUnfortunately what you say is true.\n\nBOLZ (with continued vehemence).\n\nI won't dwell on my confidence in your talents. I am convinced that, in the House, and, possibly, as one of the ministers, you will be of service to your country. I merely ask you, now, to remember your duty to our political friends, who have pinned their faith on you, and to this paper and ourselves, who for three years have worked for the credit of the name of Oldendorf which heads our front page. Your honor is at stake, and every moment of wavering is wrong.\n\nOLDENDORF (dignified).\n\nYou are exciting yourself without reason. I too deem it wrong to retire now when I am told that our cause needs me. But in confessing to you, my friend, that my decision means a great personal sacrifice, I am not compromising either our cause or ourselves as individuals.\n\nBOLZ (soothingly).\n\nRight you are! You are a loyal comrade. And so peace, friendship, courage! Your old Colonel won't be inexorable.\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nHe has grown intimate with Senden, who flatters him in every way, and has plans, I fear, which affect me also. I should feel still more worried but for knowing that I have now a good advocate in the Colonel's house. Adelaide Runeck has just arrived.\n\nBOLZ.\n\nAdelaide Runeck? She into the bargain! (Quickly calling through the door on the right.) Kämpe, the article against the knight of the arrow is not to be written. Understand?\n\nEnter KÄMPE.\n\nKÄMPE (at the door, pen in hand).\n\nBut what is to be written, then?\n\nBOLZ.\n\nThe devil only knows! See here! Perhaps I can induce Oldendorf to write the leading article for tomorrow himself. But at all events you must have something on hand.\n\nKÄMPE.\n\nBut what?\n\nBOLZ (excitedly).\n\nFor all I care write about emigration to Australia; that, at any rate, will give no offense.\n\nKÄMPE.\n\nGood! Am I to encourage it or advise against it?\n\nBOLZ (quickly).\n\nAdvise against it, of course; we need every one who is willing to work here at home. Depict Australia as a contemptible hole. Be perfectly truthful but make it as black as possible—how the Kangaroo, balled into a heap, springs with invincible malice at the settler's head, while the duckbill nips at the back of his legs; how the gold-seeker has, in winter, to stand up to his neck in salt water while for three months in summer he has not a drop to drink; how he may live through all that only to be eaten up at last by thievish natives. Make it very vivid and end up with the latest market prices for Australian wool from the Times. You'll find what books you need in the library. [Slams the door to.]\n\nOLDENDORF (at the table).\n\nDo you know Miss Runeck? She often inquires about you in her letters to Ida.\n\nBOLZ.\n\nIndeed? Yes, to be sure, I know her. We are from the same village—she from the manor-house, I from the parsonage. My father taught us together. Oh, yes, I know her!\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nHow comes it that you have drifted so far apart? You never speak of her.\n\nBOLZ.\n\nH'm! It is an old story—family quarrels, Montagues and Capulets. I have not seen her for a long time.\n\nOLDENDORF (smiling).\n\nI hope that you too were not estranged by politics.\n\nBOLZ.\n\nPolitics did, indeed, have something to do with our separation; you see it is the common misfortune that party life destroys friendship.\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nSad to relate! In religion any educated man will tolerate the convictions of another; but in politics we treat each other like reprobates if there be the slightest shade of difference of opinion between us.\n\nBOLZ (aside).\n\nMatter for our next article! (Aloud.) \"The slightest shade of difference of opinion between us.\" Just what I think! We must have that in our paper! (Entreating). Look! A nice little virtuous article: \"An admonition to our voters—Respect our opponents, for they are, after all, our brothers!\" (Urging him more and more.) Oldendorf, that would be something for you—there is virtue and humanity in the theme; writing will divert you, and you owe the paper an article because you forbade the feud. Please do me the favor! Go into the back room there and write. No one shall disturb you.\n\nOLDENDORF (smiling).\n\nYou are just a vulgar intriguer!\n\nBOLZ (forcing him from his chair).\n\nPlease, you'll find ink and paper there. Come, deary, come! [He accompanies him to the door on the left. Exit OLDENDORF. BOLZ calling after him.] Will you have a cigar? An old Henry Clay? [Draws a cigar-case from his pocket.] No? Don't make it too short; it is to be the principal article! [He shuts the door, calls through the door on the right.] The professor is writing the article himself. See that nobody disturbs him! [Coming to the front.] So that is settled.—Adelaide here in town! I'll go straight to her! Stop, keep cool, keep cool! Old Bolz, you are no longer the brown lad from the parsonage. And even if you were, she has long since changed. Grass has grown over the grave of a certain childish inclination. Why are you suddenly thumping so, my dear soul? Here in town she is just as far off from you as on her estates. [Seating himself and playing with a pencil.] \"Nothing like keeping cool,\" murmured the salamander as he sat in the stove fire.\n\nEnter KORB.\n\nKORB.\n\nIs Mr. Bolz in?\n\nBOLZ (jumping up).\n\nKorb! My dear Korb! Welcome, heartily welcome! It is good of you not to have forgotten me. [Shakes hands with him.] I am very glad to see you.\n\nKORB.\n\nAnd I even more to see you. Here we are in town. The whole village sends greetings! From Anton the stable-boy—he is now head man—to the old night watchman whose horn you once hung up on the top of the tower. Oh, what a pleasure this is!\n\nBOLZ.\n\nHow is Miss Runeck? Tell me, old chap!\n\nKORB.\n\nVery well indeed, now. But we have been through much. The late general was ill for four years. It was a bad time. You know he was always an irritable man.\n\nBOLZ.\n\nYes, he was hard to manage.—\n\nKORB.\n\nAnd especially during his illness. But Miss Adelaide took care of him, so gentle and so pale, like a perfect lamb. Now, since his death, Miss Adelaide runs the estate, and like the best of managers. The village is prospering again. I will tell you everything, but not until this evening. Miss Adelaide is waiting for me; I merely ran in quickly to tell you that we are here.\n\nBOLZ.\n\nDon't be in such a hurry, Korb.—So the people in the village still think of me!\n\nKORB.\n\nI should say they did! No one can understand why you don't come near us. It was another matter while the old gentleman was alive, but now—\n\nBOLZ (seriously).\n\nMy parents are dead; a stranger lives in the parsonage.\n\nKORB.\n\nBut we in the manor-house are still alive! Miss Runeck would surely be delighted—\n\nBOLZ.\n\nDoes she still remember me?\n\nKORB.\n\nOf course she does. This very day she asked about you.\n\nBOLZ.\n\nWhat did she ask, old chap?\n\nKORB.\n\nShe asked me if it was true what people are saying, that you have grown very wild, make debts, run after girls, and are up to the devil generally.\n\nBOLZ.\n\nGood gracious! You stood up for me, I trust?\n\nKORB.\n\nOf course! I told her that all that might be taken for granted with you.\n\nBOLZ.\n\nConfound it! That's what she thinks of me, is it? Tell me, Korb, Miss\n\nAdelaide has many suitors, has she not?\n\nKORB.\n\nThe sands of the sea are as nothing to it.\n\nBOLZ (vexed).\n\nBut yet she can finally choose only one, I suppose.\n\nKORB (slyly).\n\nCorrect! But which one? That's the question.\n\nBOLZ.\n\nWhich do you think it will be?\n\nKORB.\n\nWell, that is difficult to say. There is this Mr. von Senden who is now living in town. If any one has a chance it is probably he. He fusses about us like a weasel. Just as I was leaving he sent to the house a whole dozen of admission cards to the great fête at the club. It must be the sort of club where the upper classes go arm-in-arm with the townspeople.\n\nBOLZ.\n\nYes, it is a political society of which Senden is a director. It is casting out a great net for voters. And the Colonel and the ladies are going?\n\nKORB.\n\nI hear they are. I, too, received a card.\n\nBOLZ (to himself).\n\nHas it come to this? Poor Oldendorf!—And Adelaide at the club fête of\n\nMr. von Senden!\n\nKORB (to himself).\n\nHow am I going to begin and find out about his love-affairs? (Aloud.) Oh, see here, Mr. Conrad, one thing more! Have you possibly some real good friend in this concern to whom you could introduce me?\n\nBOLZ.\n\nWhy, old chap?\n\nKORB.\n\nIt is only—I am a stranger here, and often have commissions and errands where I need advice. I should like to have some one to consult should you chance to be away, or with whom I could leave word for you.\n\nBOLZ.\n\nYou will find me here at almost any time of day. [At the door.] Bellmaus! [Enter BELLMAUS.] You see this gentleman here. He is an honored old friend of mine from my native village. Should he happen not to find me here, you take my place.—This gentleman's name is Bellmaus, and he is a good fellow.\n\nKORB.\n\nI am pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr. Bellmaus.\n\nBELLMAUS.\n\nAnd I to make yours. You have not told me his name yet.\n\nBOLZ.\n\nKorb. He has had a great deal to carry in his life, and has often carried me on his back, too.\n\nBELLMAUS.\n\nI too am pleased, Mr. Korb. [They shake hands.]\n\nKORB.\n\nWell, that is in order, and now I must go or Miss Adelaide will be waiting.\n\nBOLZ.\n\nGood-by! Hope to see you very soon again.\n\n[Exit KORB; exit BELLMAUS through door on the right.]\n\nBOLZ (alone).\n\nSo this Senden is courting her! Oh, that is bitter!\n\nEnter HENNING, followed by MILLER.\n\nHENNING (in his dressing-gown, hurriedly, with a printed roll in his hand).\n\nYour servant, Mr. Bolz! Is \"opponent\" spelt with one p or with two p's? The new proofreader has corrected it one p.\n\nBOLZ (deep in his thoughts).\n\nEstimable Mr. Henning, the Union prints it with two p's.\n\nHENNING.\n\nI said so at once. [To MILLER.] It must be changed; the press is waiting.\n\n[Exit MILLER hastily.]\n\nI took occasion to read the leading article. Doubtless you wrote it yourself. It is very good, but too sharp, Mr. Bolz. Pepper and mustard—that will give offense; it will cause bad blood.\n\nBOLZ (still deep in his thoughts, violently).\n\nI always did have an antipathy to this man!\n\n[Illustration: Permission Union Deutsche Verlagsgesellschaft,\n\nStuttgart. NATURE ENTHUSIASTS. ADOLPH VON MENZEL]\n\nHENNING (hurt).\n\nHow? What? Mr. Bolz? You have an antipathy to me?\n\nBOLZ.\n\nTo whom? No, dear Mr. Henning, you are a good fellow and would be the best newspaper owner in the world, if only you were not often as frightened as a hare. [Embraces him.] My regards to Mrs. Henning, sir, and leave me alone. I am thinking up my next article.\n\nHENNING (while he is being thrust out).\n\nBut do, please, write very moderately and kindly, dear Mr. Bolz.\n\nBOLZ (alone, walking to and fro again).\n\nSenden avoids me whenever he can. He stands things from me that any one else would strongly resent. Is it possible that he suspects—\n\nEnter MILLER.\n\nMILLER (hurriedly).\n\nA lady I don't know wishes to pay her respects to you.\n\nBOLZ.\n\nA lady! And to me?\n\nMILLER.\n\nTo the editor. [Hands him a card.]\n\nBOLZ (reads).\n\nLeontine Pavoni-Gessler, née Melloni from Paris. She must have to do with art. Is she pretty?\n\nMILLER.\n\nH'm! So, so!\n\nBOLZ.\n\nThen tell her we are very sorry that we cannot have the pleasure, that it is the editor's big washing-day.\n\nMILLER.\n\nWhat?\n\nBOLZ (vehemently).\n\nWashing, children's washing. That we are sitting up to the elbows in soapsuds.\n\nMILLER (laughing).\n\nAnd I am to—\n\nBOLZ (impatiently).\n\nYou're a blockhead! [At the door.] Bellmaus! [Enter BELLMAUS.]\n\nStay here and receive the visitor. [Gives him the card.]\n\nBELLMAUS.\n\nAh, that is the new ballet-dancer who is expected here. [Inspecting his coat.] But I'm not dressed for it!\n\nBOLZ.\n\nAll the more dressed she will be. [To MILLER.] Show the lady in.\n\n[Exit MILLER.]\n\nBELLMAUS.\n\nBut really I cannot—\n\nBOLZ (irritably).\n\nOh the devil, don't put on airs! [Goes to the table, puts papers in the drawer, seizes his hat.]\n\nEnter MADAME PAVONI.\n\nMADAME PAVONI.\n\nHave I the honor of seeing before me the editor of the Union?\n\nBELLMAUS (bowing).\n\nTo be sure—that is to say—won't you kindly be seated? [Pushes up chairs.]\n\nBOLZ.\n\nAdelaide is clear-sighted and clever. How can she possibly fail to see through that fellow?\n\nMADAME PAVONI.\n\nMr. Editor, the intelligent articles about art which adorn your paper—have prompted me—\n\nBELLMAUS.\n\nOh, please!\n\nBOLZ. (having made up his mind).\n\nI must gain entrance into this club-fête!\n\n[Exit with a bow to the lady. BELLMAUS and MADAME PAVONI sit facing each other.]\n\nACT II\n\nSCENE I\n\nThe COLONEL'S summer parlor. In the foreground on the right IDA and ADELAIDE, next to ADELAIDE the COLONEL, all sitting. In front of them a table with coffee set.\n\nCOLONEL (in conversation with ADELAIDE, laughing).\n\nA splendid story, and cleverly told! I am heartily glad that you are with us, dear Adelaide. Now, at any rate, we shall talk about something else at table besides this everlasting politics! H'm! The professor has not come today. He never used to miss our coffee-hour.\n\n[Pause; ADELAIDE and IDA look at each other. IDA sighs.]\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nPerhaps he has work to do.\n\nIDA.\n\nOr he is vexed with us because I am going to the fête tonight.\n\nCOLONEL (irritably).\n\nNonsense, you are not his wife nor even openly his fiancée. You are in your father's house and belong in my circle.—H'm! I see he treasures it up against me that I did some plain speaking the other day. I think I was a little impatient.\n\nADELAIDE (nodding her head).\n\nYes, a little, I hear.\n\nIDA.\n\nHe is worried about the way you feel, dear father.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nWell, I have reason enough to be vexed; don't remind me of it. And that, in addition, he lets himself be mixed up in these elections, is unpardonable.\n\n[Walks up and down.]\n\nBut you had better send for him, Ida.\n\nIDA rings. Enter CARL.\n\nIDA.\n\nOur compliments to the professor and we are waiting coffee for him.\n\n[Exit CARL.]\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nWell, that about waiting was not quite necessary. Why, we have finished our coffee.\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nIda has not finished yet.\n\nIDA.\n\nHush!\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nWhy did he ever let himself be put up as candidate? He has plenty to do as it is.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nPure ambition, girls. The devil of ambition possesses these young men.\n\nHe impels them as steam does a locomotive.\n\nIDA.\n\nNo, father, he never thought of himself in the matter.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nIt does not stand out quite so nakedly as, \"I must make a career for myself,\" or \"I wish to become a famous man.\" The procedure is more delicate. The good friends come along and say: \"Your duty to the good cause requires you to—it is a crime against your country if you do not—it is a sacrifice for you but we demand it.\" And so a pretty mantle is thrown around vanity, and the candidate issues forth—from pure patriotism of course! Don't teach an old soldier worldly wisdom. We, dear Adelaide, sit calmly by and laugh at such weaknesses.\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nAnd are indulgent toward them when we have so good a heart as you.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nYes, one profits by experience.\n\nEnter CARL.\n\nCARL.\n\nMr. von Senden and two other gentlemen.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nWhat do they want? Pleased to see them!\n\n[Exit CARL.]\n\nAllow me to have them shown in here, children. Senden never stays long. He is a roving spirit.\n\n[The ladies rise.]\n\nIDA.\n\nThe hour is again spoiled for us.\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nDon't mind it; we shall have all the more time to dress.\n\n[Exeunt IDA and ADELAIDE on the left.]\n\nEnter SENDEN, BLUMENBERG, a third gentleman.\n\nSENDEN.\n\nColonel, we come on behalf of the committee for the approaching election to notify you that that committee has unanimously voted to make you, Colonel, our party's candidate.\n\nCOLONEL. Me?\n\nSENDEN.\n\nThe committee begs you to accept this nomination so that the necessary announcement can be made to the voters at this evening's fête.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nAre you in earnest, dear Senden? Where did the committee get such an idea?\n\nSENDEN.\n\nColonel, our president, who had previously agreed to run for our town, found that it would be more advantageous to be candidate from a provincial district; apart from him no one of our townsmen is so well known and so popular with the citizens as yourself. If you accede to our request our party is certain of victory; if you refuse, there is every probability that our opponents will have their own way. You will agree with us that such an eventuality must be avoided under all circumstances.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nI see all that; but, on personal grounds, it is impossible for me to help our friends in this matter.\n\nSENDEN (to the others).\n\nLet me explain to the Colonel certain things which will possibly make him look favorably on our request.\n\n[Exeunt BLUMENBERG and the other gentlemen into the garden, where they are visible from time to time.]\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nBut, Senden, how could you put me in this embarrassing position! You know that for years Oldendorf has frequented my house and that it will be extremely unpleasant for me openly to oppose him.\n\nSENDEN.\n\nIf the professor is really so devoted to you and your household, he has now the best opportunity to show it. It is a foregone conclusion that he will at once withdraw.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nI am not quite so sure of that; he is very stubborn in many ways.\n\nSENDEN.\n\nIf he do not withdraw such egotism can scarcely still be called stubbornness. And in such a case you would scarcely be under obligations to him; obligations, Colonel, which might work injury to the whole country. Besides, he has no chance of being elected if you accept, for you will defeat him by a majority not large but sure.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nAre we so perfectly certain of this majority!\n\nSENDEN.\n\nI think I can guarantee it. Blumenberg and the other gentlemen have made very thorough inquiries.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nIt would serve the professor quite right if he had to withdraw in my favor.—But no—no; it will not do at all, my friend.\n\nSENDEN.\n\nWe know, Colonel, what a sacrifice we are asking of you, and that nothing could compensate you for it save the consciousness of having done your country a great service.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nTo be sure.\n\nSENDEN.\n\nIt would be so regarded in the capital, too, and I am convinced that your entering the House would also cause pleasure in other circles than those of your numerous friends and admirers.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nI should meet there many old friends and comrades. (Aside.) I should be presented at Court.\n\nSENDEN.\n\nThe minister of war asked very warmly after you the other day; he too must have been one of your companions in arms.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nYes indeed! As young blades we served in the same company and played many mad pranks together. It would be a pleasure to see him now in the House, drawing his honest face into dark lines. He was a wild devil in the regiment, but a fine boy.\n\nSENDEN.\n\nNor will he be the only one to receive you with open arms.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nIn any case, I should have to think the matter over.\n\nSENDEN.\n\nDon't be angry, Colonel, if I urge you to decide. This evening we have to introduce their candidate to our citizen guests. It is high time, or all is lost.\n\nCOLONEL (hesitating).\n\nSenden, you put a knife to my throat!\n\n[SENDEN, from the door, motions the gentlemen in the garden to come in.]\n\nBLUMENBERG.\n\nWe venture to urge you, knowing that so good a soldier as you,\n\nColonel, makes up his mind quickly.\n\nCOLONEL (after struggling inwardly).\n\nWell, so be it, gentlemen, I accept! Tell the committee I appreciate their confidence. This evening we will talk over details.\n\nBLUMENBERG.\n\nWe thank you, Colonel. The whole town will be rejoiced to hear of your decision.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nGood-by until this evening.\n\n[Exeunt the visitors;\n\nCOLONEL alone, thoughtfully.]\n\nI fear I ought not to have accepted so quickly; but I had to do the minister of war that favor. What will the girls say to it? And Oldendorf?\n\n[Enter OLDENDORF.]\n\nThere he is himself.\n\n[Clears his throat.]\n\nHe will be astonished. I can't help it, he must withdraw. Good morning, Professor, you come just at the right moment.\n\nOLDENDORF (hastily).\n\nColonel, there is a report in town that Mr. von Senden's party have put you up as their candidate. I ask for your own assurance that you would not accept such a nomination.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nAnd, supposing the proposition had been made to me, why should I not accept as well as you? Yes, rather than you; for the motives that would determine me are sounder than your reasons.\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nSo there is some foundation then to the rumor?\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nTo be frank, it is the truth. I have accepted. You see in me your opponent.\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nNothing so bad has yet occurred to trouble our relations. Colonel, could not the memory of a friendship, hearty and undisturbed for years, induce you to avoid this odious conflict?\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nOldendorf, I could not act otherwise, believe me. It is your place now to remember our old friendship. You are a younger man, let alone other relationships; you are the one now to withdraw.\n\nOLDENDORF (more excitedly).\n\nColonel, I have known you for years. I know how keenly and how deeply you feel things and how little your ardent disposition fits you to bear the petty vexations of current politics, the wearing struggle of debates. Oh, my worthy friend, do listen to my exhortations and take back your consent.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nLet that be my concern. I am an old block of hard timber. Think of yourself, dear Oldendorf. You are young, you have fame as a scholar; your learning assures you every success. Why, in another sphere of activity, do you seek to exchange honor and recognition for naught but hatred, mockery, and humiliation? For with such views as yours you cannot fail to harvest them. Think it over. Be sensible, and withdraw.\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nColonel, could I follow my own inclinations I should do so on the spot. But in this contest I am under obligations to my friends. I cannot withdraw now.\n\nCOLONEL (excitedly).\n\nNor can I withdraw, lest I harm the good cause. We are no further now than in the beginning. (Aside.) Obstinate fellow!\n\n[Both walk up and down on opposite sides of the stage.]\n\nYou have not the least chance whatever of being elected, Oldendorf; my friends are sure of having the majority of the votes. You are exposing yourself to a public defeat. (Kindly.) I should dislike having you of all people beaten by me; it will cause gossip and scandal. Just think of it! It is perfectly useless for you to conjure up the conflict.\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nEven if it were such a foregone conclusion as you assume, Colonel, I should still have to hold out to the end. But as far as I can judge the general sentiment, the result is by no means so certain. And think, Colonel, if you should happen to be defeated—\n\nCOLONEL (irritated).\n\nI tell you, that will not be the case.\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nBut if it should be? How odious that would be for both of us! How would you feel toward me then! I might possibly welcome a defeat in my heart; for you it would be a terrible mortification, and, Colonel, I dread this possibility.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nFor that very reason you should withdraw.\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nI can no longer do so; but there is still time for you.\n\nCOLONEL (vehemently).\n\nThunder and lightning, sir, I have said yes; I am not the man to cap it with a no!\n\n[Both walk up and down.]\n\nThat appears to end it, Professor! My wishes are of no account to you; I ought to have known that! We must go our separate ways. We have become open opponents; let us be honest enemies—\n\nOLDENDORF (seizing the COLONEL'S hand).\n\nColonel, I consider this a most unfortunate day; for I see sad results to follow. Rest assured that no circumstances can shake my love and devotion for you.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nWe are drawn up in line of battle, as it were. You mean to let yourself be defeated by an old military man. You shall have your desire.\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nI ask your permission to tell Miss Ida of our conversation.\n\nCOLONEL (somewhat uneasy).\n\nYou had better not do that just now, Professor. An opportunity will come in due time. At present the ladies are dressing. I myself will say what is necessary.\n\nOLDENDORF.\n\nFarewell, Colonel, and think of me without hard feelings.\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nI will try my best, Professor.\n\n[Exit OLDENDORF.]\n\nHe has not given in! What depths of ambition there are in these scholars!\n\nEnter IDA, ADELAIDE.\n\nIDA.\n\nWas not that Edward's voice?\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nYes, my child.\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nAnd he has gone away again! Has anything happened?\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nWell, yes, girls. To make a long story short, Oldendorf does not become member for this town, but I.\n\nADELAIDE} (together.) You, Colonel? IDA } You, father?\n\nIDA.\n\nHas Edward withdrawn?\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nIs the election over?\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nNeither one nor the other. Oldendorf has proved his much-vaunted devotion to us by not withdrawing, and election day is not yet past. But from what I hear there is no doubt that Oldendorf will be defeated.\n\nIDA.\n\nAnd you, father, have come out before everybody as his opponent?\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nAnd what did Oldendorf say to that, Colonel?\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nDon't excite me, girls! Oldendorf was stubborn, otherwise he behaved well, and as far as that is concerned all is in order. The grounds which determined me to make the sacrifice are very weighty. I will explain them to you more fully another time. The matter is decided; I have accepted; let that suffice for the present.\n\nIDA.\n\nBut, dear father—\n\nCOLONEL.\n\nLeave me in peace, Ida, I have other things to think of. This evening I am to speak in public; that is, so to say, the custom at such elections. Don't worry, my child, we'll get the better of the professor and his clique.\n\n[Exit COLONEL toward the garden. IDA and ADELAIDE stand facing each other and wring their hands.]\n\nIDA.\n\nWhat do you say to that?\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nYou are his daughter—what do you say?\n\nIDA.\n\nNot possible!—Father! Scarcely had he finished explaining to us thoroughly what petty mantles ambition assumes in such elections—\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nYes, he described them right vividly, all the little wraps and cloaks of vanity.\n\nIDA.\n\nAnd within an hour he lets them throw the cloak about himself. Why, it is terrible! And if father is not elected? It was wrong of Edward not to give in to father's weakness. Is that your love for me, Professor? He, too, never thought of me!\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nShall I tell you what? Let us hope that they both fail. These politicians! It was bad enough for you when only one was in politics; now that both have tasted of the intoxicating drink you are done for. Were I ever to come into a position to make a man my master, I should impose upon him but one condition, the wise rule of conduct of my old aunt: Smoke tobacco, my husband, as much as you please; at most it will spoil the walls; but never dare to look at a newspaper—that will spoil your character.\n\n[KORB appears at the door.]\n\nWhat news do you bring, Korb?\n\nKORB (hastily, mysteriously).\n\nIt isn't true!\n\nADELAIDE (the same). What isn't true?\n\nKORB.\n\nThat he has a fiancée. He has no idea of it. His friend says he has but one lady-love.\n\nADELAIDE (eagerly).\n\nWho is she?\n\nKORB. His newspaper.\n\nADELAIDE (relieved).\n\nAh, indeed. (Aloud.)\n\nOne can see by that how many falsehoods people tell. It is good, dear\n\nKorb.\n\n[Exit KORB.]\n\nIDA. What isn't true?\n\nADELAIDE (sighing).\n\nWell, that we women are cleverer than men. We talk just as wisely and\n\nI fear are just as glad to forget our wisdom at the first opportunity.\n\nWe are all of us together poor sinners!\n\nIDA.\n\nYou can joke about it. You never knew what it was to have your father and the man you loved oppose each other as enemies.\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nDo you think so! Well, I once had a good friend who had foolishly given her heart to a handsome, high-spirited boy. She was a mere child and it was a very touching relationship: knightly devotion on his part and tender sighings on hers. Then the young heroine had the misfortune to become very jealous, and so far forgot poetry and deportment as to give her heart's chosen knight a box on the ear. It was only a little box, but it had fateful consequences. The young lady's father had seen it and demanded an explanation. Then the young knight acted like a perfect hero. He took all the blame upon himself and told the alarmed father that he had asked the young lady to kiss him—poor fellow, he never had the courage for such a thing!—and the blow had been her answer. A stern man was the father; he treated the lad very harshly. The hero was sent away from his family and his home, and the heroine sat lonely in her donjon-tower and mourned her lost one.\n\nIDA.\n\nShe ought to have told her father the truth.\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nOh, she did. But her confession made matters only worse. Years have gone by since then, and the knight and his lady are now old people and have become quite sensible.\n\nIDA (smiling).\n\nAnd, because they are sensible, do they not love each other any longer?\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nHow the man feels about it, dear child, I cannot tell you exactly. He wrote the lady a very beautiful letter after the death of her father—that is all I know about it. But the lady has greater confidence than you, for she still hopes. (Earnestly.) Yes, she hopes; and even her father permitted that before he died—you see, she still hopes.\n\nIDA (embracing her).\n\nAnd who is the banished one for whom she still hopes?\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nHush, dearest, that is a dark secret. Few persons living know about it; and when the birds on the trees of Rosenau tell each other the story they treat it as a dim legend of their forefathers. They then sing softly and sorrowfully, and their feathers stand on end with awe. In due time you shall learn all about it; but now you must think of the fête, and of how pretty you are going to look.\n\nIDA.\n\nOn the one hand the father, on the other the lover—how will it end?\n\nADELAIDE.\n\nDo not worry. The one is an old soldier, the other a young statesman; two types that we women have wound around our little fingers from time immemorial! [Both leave.]\n\nSCENE II\n\nSide room of a public hall. The rear wall a great arch with columns, through which one looks into the lighted hall and through it into another. On the left, toward the front, a door. On the right, tables and chairs; chandeliers. Later, from time to time distant music. In the hall ladies and gentlemen walking about or standing in groups. SENDEN, BLUMENBERG, behind them SCHMOCK coming from the hall.\n\nSENDEN. All is going well. There is a splendid spirit in the company. These good townspeople are delighted with our arrangements. It was a fine idea of yours, Blumenberg, to have this fête.\n\nBLUMENBEEG. Only hurry and get people warmed up! It's a good thing to begin with some music. Vienna waltzes are best on account of the women. Then comes a speech from you, then some solo singing, and, at supper, the introduction of the Colonel, and the toasts. It can't help being a success; the men must have hearts of stone if they don't give their votes in return for such a fête.\n\nSENDEN. The toasts have been apportioned.\n\nBLUMENBERG. But the music?—Why has the music stopped?\n\nSENDEN. I am waiting for the Colonel to arrive.\n\nBLUMENBERG. He must be received with a blare of trumpets. It will flatter him, you know.\n\nSENDEN. That's what I ordered. Directly after, they start up a march and we bring him in procession.\n\nBLUMENBERG. First rate! That will lend solemnity to his entrance. Only think up your speech. Be popular, for today we are among the rabble.\n\nEnter guests, among them HENNING.\n\nSENDEN (doing the honors with BLUMENBERG). Delighted to see you here! We knew that you would not fail us. Is this your wife?\n\nGUEST. Yes, Mr. von Senden, this is my wife.\n\nSENDEN. You here, too, Mr. Henning? Welcome, my dear sir!\n\nHENNING. I was invited by my friend and really had the curiosity to come. My presence, I hope, will not be unpleasant to any one?\n\nSENDEN. Quite the contrary. We are most pleased to greet you here.\n\n[Guests leave through centre door; SENDEN goes out in conversation with them.]\n\nBLUMENBERG. He knows how to manage people. It's the good manners of these gentlemen that does it. He is useful—useful to me too. He manages the others, and I manage him. [Turning, he sees SCHMOCK, who is hovering near the door.] What are you doing here? Why do you stand there listening? You are not a door-keeper! See that you keep out of my vicinity. Divide yourself up among the company.\n\nSCHMOCK. Whom shall I go to if I know none of these people at all? You are the only person I know.\n\nBLUMENBERG. Why must you tell people that you know me? I consider it no honor to stand next to you.\n\nSCHMOCK. If it is not an honor it's not a disgrace either; But I can stay by myself.\n\nBLUMENBERG. Have you money to get something to eat? Go to the restaurant-keeper and order something charged to me. The committee will pay for it.\n\nSCHMOCK. I don't care to go and eat. I have no need to spend anything.\n\nI have had my supper.\n\n[Blare of trumpets and march in the distance. Exit BLUMENBERG. SCHMOCK alone, coming forward, angrily.]\n\nI hate him! I'll tell him I hate him, that I despise him from the bottom of my heart!\n\n[Turns to go, comes back.]\n\nBut I cannot tell him so, or he will cut out all I send in for the special correspondence I write for his paper! I will try to swallow it down!\n\n[Exit through centre door.]\n\nEnter BOLZ, KÄMPE, BELLMAUS by side door.\n\nBOLZ (marching in). Behold us in the house of the Capulets! [Pretends to thrust a sword into its scabbard.] Conceal your swords under roses. Blow your little cheeks up, and look as silly and innocent as possible. Above all, don't let me see you get into a row, and if you meet this Tybaldus Senden be so good as to run round the corner.\n\n[The procession is seen marching through the rear halls.]\n\nYou, Romeo Bellmaus, look out for the little women. I see more fluttering curls and waving kerchiefs there than are good for your peace of mind.\n\nKÄMPE. I bet a bottle of champagne that if one of us gets into a row it will be you.\n\nBOLZ. Possibly. But I promise you that you shall surely come in for your share of it. Now listen to my plan of operations. You Kämpe—[Enter SCHMOCK.] Stop! Who is that? Thunder! The factotum of the Coriolanus! Our incognito has not lasted long.\n\nSCHMOCK (even before the last remark, has been seen looking in at the door, coming forward). I wish you good evening, Mr. Bolz.\n\nBOLZ. I wish you the same and of even better quality, Mr. Schmock.\n\nSCHMOCK. Might I have a couple of words with you?\n\nBOLZ. A couple? Don't ask for too few, noble armor-bearer of the Coriolanus! A couple of dozen words you shall have, but no more.\n\nSCHMOCK. Could you not employ me on your paper.\n\nBOLZ (to KÄMPE and BELLMAUS). Do you hear that? On our paper? H'm!\n\n'Tis much you ask, noble Roman!\n\nSCHMOCK. I am sick of the Coriolanus. I would do any kind of work you needed done. I want to be with respectable people, where one can earn something and be treated decently.\n\nBOLZ. What are you asking of us, slave of Rome? We to entice you away from your party—never! We do violence to your political convictions? Make you a renegade? We bear the guilt of your joining our party? No, sir! We have a tender conscience. It rises in arms against your proposition!\n\nSCHMOCK. Why do you let that trouble you? Under Blumenberg I have learned to write whichever way the wind blows. I have written on the left and again on the right. I can write in any direction.\n\nBOLZ. I see you have character. You would be a sure success on our paper. Your offer does us honor, but we cannot accept it now. So momentous an affair as your defection needs deep consideration. Meanwhile you will have confided in no unfeeling barbarian. (Aside to the others.) We may be able to worm something out of him. Bellmaus, you have the tenderest heart of us three; you must devote yourself to him today.\n\nBELLMAUS. But what shall I do with him?\n\nBOLZ. Take him into the restaurant, sit down in a corner with him, pour punch into every hollow of his poor head until his secrets jump out like wet mice. Make him chatter, especially about the elections. Go, little man, and take good care not to get overheated yourself and babble.\n\nBELLMAUS. In that case I shall not see much of the fête.\n\nBOLZ. That's true, my son! But what does the fête mean to you? Heat, dust, and stale dance-music. Besides, we will tell you all about it in the morning; and then you are a poet, and can imagine the whole affair to be much finer than it really was. So don't take it to heart. You may think you have a thankless role, but it is the most important of all, for it requires coolness and cleverness. Go, mousey, and look out about getting overheated.\n\nBELLMAUS. I'll look out, old tom-cat.—Come along Schmock!\n\n[BELLMAUS and SCHMOCK leave.]\n\nBOLZ. We might as well separate, too.\n\nKÄMPE. I'll go and see how people feel. If I need you I'll look you up.\n\nBOLZ. I had better not show myself much. I'll stay around here.\n\n[Exit KÄMPE.]\n\nAlone at last!\n\n[Goes to centre door.]\n\nThere stands the Colonel, closely surrounded. It is she! She is here, and I have to lie in hiding like a fox under the leaves.—But she has falcon eyes,—perhaps—the throng disperses—she is walking through the hall arm-in-arm with Ida—(Excitedly.) They are drawing nearer! (Irritably.) Oh, bother! There is Korb rushing toward me! And just now!\n\nEnter KORB.\n\nKORB. Mr. Conrad! I can't believe my eyes! You here, at this fête!\n\nBOLZ (hastily). Hush, old chap! I'm not here without a reason. I can trust you—you're one of us, you know.\n\nKORB. Body and soul. Through all the talking and fiddling I've kept saying to myself, \"Long live the Union!\" Here she is!\n\n[Shows him a paper in his pocket.]\n\nBOLZ. Good, Korb, you can do me a great favor. In a corner of the refreshment room Bellmaus is sitting with a stranger. He is to pump the stranger, but cannot stand much himself and is likely to say things he shouldn't. You'll do the party a great service if you will hurry in and drink punch so as to keep Bellmaus up to the mark. You have a strong head—I know it from of old.\n\nKORB (hastily). I go! You are as full of tricks as ever, I see. You may rely on me. The stranger shall succumb, and the Union shall triumph.\n\n[Exit quickly. The music ceases.]\n\nBOLZ. Poor Schmock! [At the door.]\n\nAh, they are still walking through the hall. Ida is being spoken to, she stops, Adelaide goes on—(Excitedly.) she's coming, she's coming alone!\n\nADELAIDE (makes a motion as though to pass the door, but suddenly enters. BOLZ bows). Conrad! My dear doctor!\n\n[Holds out her hand. BOLZ bends low over it.]\n\nADELAIDE (in joyous emotion). I knew you at once from a distance. Let me see your faithful face. Yes, it has changed but little—a scar, browner, and a small line about the mouth. I hope it is from laughing.\n\nBOLZ. If at this moment I feel like anything but laughing it is only a passing malignity of soul. I see myself double, like a melancholy Highlander. In your presence my long happy childhood passes bodily before my eyes. All the joy and pain it brought me I feel as vividly again as though I were still the boy who went into the wood for you in search of wild adventures and caught robin-red-breasts. And yet the fine creature I see before me is so different from my playmate that I realize I am only dreaming a beautiful dream. Your eyes shine as kindly as ever, but—(Bowing.) I have scarcely the right still to think of old dreams.\n\nADELAIDE. Possibly I, too, am not so changed as you think; and changed though we both be, we have remained good friends, have we not?\n\nBOLZ. Rather than give up one iota of my claim to your regard, I would write and print and try to sell malicious articles against myself.\n\nADELAIDE. And yet you have been too proud all this time even to come and see your friend in town. Why have you broken with the Colonel?\n\nBOLZ. I have not broken with him. On the contrary, I have a very estimable position in his house—one that I can best keep by going there as seldom as possible. The Colonel, and occasionally Miss Ida, too, like to assuage their anger against Oldendorf and the newspaper by regarding me as the evil one with horns and hoofs. A relationship so tender must be handled with care—a devil must not cheapen himself by appearing every day.\n\nADELAIDE. Well, I hope you will now abandon this lofty viewpoint. I am spending the winter in town, and I hope that for love of your boyhood's friend you will call on my friends as a denizen of this world.\n\nBOLZ. In any role you apportion me.\n\nADELAIDE. Even in that of a peace-envoy between the Colonel and\n\nOldendorf?\n\nBOLZ. If peace be at the cost of Oldendorf's withdrawal, then no.\n\nOtherwise I am ready to serve you in all good works.\n\nADELAIDE. But I fear that this is the only price at which peace can be purchased. You see, Mr. Conrad, we too have become opponents.\n\nBOLZ. To do anything against your wishes is horrible to me, son of perdition though I be. So my saint wills and commands that Oldendorf do not become member of Parliament?\n\nADELAIDE. I will it and command it, Mr. Devil!\n\nBOLZ. It is hard. Up in your heaven you have so many gentlemen to bestow on Miss Ida; why must you carry off a poor devil's one and only soul, the professor?\n\nADELAIDE. It is just the professor I want, and you must let me have him.\n\nBOLZ. I am in despair. I would tear my hair were the place not so unsuitable. I dread your anger. The thought makes me tremble that you might not like this election.\n\nADELAIDE. Well, try to stop the election, then.\n\nBOLZ. That I cannot do. But so soon as it is over I am fated to mourn and grow melancholy over your anger. I shall withdraw from the world—far, far to the North Pole. There I shall end my days sadly, playing dominoes with polar bears, or spreading the elements of journalistic training among the seals. That will be easier to endure than the scathing glance of your eyes.\n\nADELAIDE (laughing). Yes, that's the way you always were. You made every possible promise and acted exactly as you pleased. But before starting for the North Pole, perhaps you will make one more effort to reconcile me here.\n\n[KÄMPE is seen at the door.]\n\nHush!—I shall look forward to your visit. Farewell, my re-found friend!\n\n[EXIT.]\n\nBOLZ. And thus my good angel turns her back to me in anger! And now, politics, thou witch, I am irretrievably in thy power!\n\n[Exit quickly through centre door.]\n\nEnter PIEPENBRINK, MRS. PIEPENBRINK, BERTHA escorted by FRITZ KLEINMICHEL, and KLEINMICHEL through centre door. Quadrille behind the scenes.\n\nPIEPENBRINK. Thank Heaven, we are out of this crowd!\n\nMRS. PIEPENBRINK. It is very hot.\n\nKLEINMICHEL. And the music is too loud. There are too many trumpets and I hate trumpets.\n\nPIEPENBRINK. Here's a quiet spot; we'll sit down here.\n\nFRITZ. Bertha would prefer staying in the ball-room. Might I not go back with her?\n\nPIEPENBRINK. I have no objection to you young people going back into the ball-room, but I prefer your staying here with us. I like to keep my whole party together.\n\nMRS. PIEPENBRINK. Stay with your parents, my child!\n\nPIEPENBRINK. Sit down! (To his wife.) You sit at the corner, Fritz comes next to me. You take Bertha between you, neighbors. Her place will soon be at your table, anyway.\n\n[They seat themselves at the table on the right—at the left corner MRS. PIEPENBRINK, then he himself, FRITZ, BERTHA, KLEINMICHEL.]\n\nFRITZ. When will \"soon\" be, godfather? You have been saying that this long time, but you put off the wedding day further and further.\n\nPIEPENBRINK. That is no concern of yours.\n\nFRITZ. I should think it is, godfather! Am I not the man that wants to marry Bertha?\n\nPIEPENBRINK. That's a fine argument! Any one can want that. But it's I who am to give her to you, which is more to the point, young man; for it is going to be hard enough for me to let the little wag-tail leave my nest. So you wait. You shall have her, but wait!\n\nKLEINMICHEL. He will wait, neighbor.\n\nPIEPENBRINK. Well, I should strongly advise him to do so. Hey! Waiter, waiter!\n\n[Illustration: Permission F. Bruckman, A.-G. Munich ON THE TERRACE\n\nADOLF VON MENZEL]\n\nMRS. PIEPENBRINK. What poor service one gets in such places!\n\nPIEPENBRINK. Waiter!\n\n[Waiter comes.]\n\nMy name is Piepenbrink. I brought along six bottles of my own wine.\n\nThe restaurant-keeper has them. I should like them here.\n\n[While the waiter is bringing the bottles and glasses BOLZ and KÄMPE appear. Waiter from time to time in the background.]\n\nBOLZ (aside to KÄMPE). Which one is it?\n\nKÄMPE. The one with his back to us, the broad-shouldered one.\n\nBOLZ. And what kind of a business does he carry on?\n\nKÄMPE. Chiefly red wines.\n\nBOLZ. Good! (Aloud.) Waiter, a table and two chairs here! A bottle of red wine!\n\n[Waiter brings what has been ordered to the front, on the left.]\n\nMRS. PIEPENBRINK. What are those people doing here?\n\nPIEPENBRINK. That is the trouble with such promiscuous assemblies, that one never can be alone.\n\nKLEINMICHEL. They seem respectable gentlemen; I think I have seen one of them before.\n\nPIEPENBRINK (decisively). Respectable or not, they are in our way.\n\nKLEINMICHEL. Yes, to be sure, so they are.\n\nBOLZ (seating himself with KÄMPE). Here, my friend, we can sit quietly before a bottle of red wine. I hardly dare to pour it out, for the wine at such restaurants is nearly always abominable. What sort of stuff do you suppose this will be?\n\nPIEPENBRINK (irritated). Indeed? Just listen to that!\n\nKÄMPE. Let's try it.\n\n[Pours out; in a low voice.]\n\nThere is a double P. on the seal; that might mean Piepenbrink.\n\nPIEPENBRINK. Well, I am curious to know what these greenhorns will have to say against the wine.\n\nMRS. PIEPENBRINK. Be quiet, Philip, they can hear you over there.\n\nBOLZ (in a low tone). I'm sure you are right. The restaurant takes its wine from him. That's his very reason for coming.\n\nPIEPENBRINK. They don't seem to be thirsty; they are not drinking.\n\nBOLZ (tastes it; aloud). Not bad!\n\nPIEPENBRINK (ironically). Indeed?\n\nBOLZ (takes another sip). A good, pure wine.\n\nPIEPENBRINK (relie"
