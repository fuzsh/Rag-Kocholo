FELLOWS OF HARVARD COLLEGE PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 1 dedicate this book to my wife Katie , and to the Boston ( U.S.A . ) Branch of the Dickens Fellowship whose sponsorship of this work has made its publica- tion possible PREFACE It will be gathered from the title of the present volume that it is not a bibliography of the works of Charles Dickens but one devoted ex- clusively to the Ana concerning or connected with his life and works, somewhat on the lines of the w^ell-known and valuable volume by the late F. G. Kitton. Since, however, that bibliography was published more than fifty-seven years ago, it has naturally become more or less obsolete, because of new material which has made its appearance during the period which has elapsed and because of numberless previously unrecorded items which have been brought to light- Many years have been spent in compiling the present volume, and great care has been expended in research in order to make it as complete and up to date as possible. Little or no effort has been made to chronicle articles which appeared in the daily press, for that would obviously have made too bulky a book, but certain of the most important and vital contributions find a place in the following pages. The chief object of the undertaking is to supply a complete list of all Dickensiana, arranged by subjects for easy refer- ence and comprising books devoted to the novelist, books containing chapters devoted to his life and works, magazine articles, plays, poems, songs, plagiarisms, music, etc., published up to the present time. The titles under each subject are arranged in chronological order as far as possible. Where no date appears on the title page and the actual date cannot be ascertained the item appears under the heading “Undated.” At the end of the volume will be found an index to the writers of the books, articles, etc. The student will be aided in finding material on any phase of Dickens, and the collector will be guided in his choice of items he may desire to add to his collection. My sincere thanks are due to Miss Caroline E. Sherrill of Boston for allowing me to take notes of her excellent collection of Dickens music titles, and also to W. R. Anderson of Brighton, England, for his kind cooperation. Miss Jess M. Monger of Boston, Massachusetts read the galley proof and Mrs. George S. Amsbary made the index.

Bibliographical 275 Works devoted to recording the writings of Charles Dick- ens and the Ana relating thereto Index 283 INTRODUCTION From time to time during a period of several years, I used to see Mr, Miller working about the Harvard Library. First, I heard that he was a “Dickens expert” ; then, I learned that he had been Honorary Librarian to the Dickens Fellowship in London from 1903 to 1925, and, finally, it came to my knowledge that he was preparing for publication a bibli- ography of the writings relating to Charles Dickens and his works. It seemed that here, by a happy combination of circumstances a scholar was engaged in a production for which he was eminently well fitted. All great writers have their disciples. The devotion inspired by Shakespeare is probably as deep and strong as will be commonly en- countered. Yet, I think it may be said of the Dickens fan that he dis- plays in his attachment an unique zest and fondness for the subject — he is the scholarly counterpart of the armchair detective whose allegiance Is sworn to Sherlock Holmes. In Mr. Miller’s case, this highly special- ized combination of reverence and enthusiasm has borne good fruit. A study of this sort is the definite answer to an outstanding need; reference librarians will be delighted, and students in English literature will be saved many hours of purely technical reference and research labor. When one considers the great popularity of Dickens and the tremendous amount of literature which it has occasioned not only in his native country but in other lands as well, one realizes that some form of tabulation is an acute necessity. Never before have references to these writings been assembled adequately. The only previous bibliography of this sort was compiled by Mr, Fred G. Kitton, and published in 1886; and indeed it is upon this bibliography that Mr. Miller bases his own subject arrangement. By now, Mr. Kitton’s work is obviously outdated, but even for the earlier years it falls far behind Mr. Miller’s in scope. To make just one comparison, it may be seen that in the Music section Mr. Kitton lists twenty-three references, while Mr. Miller provides two hundred forty-eight. And let us not forget the Index, indispensable aid to the researcher, with which Mr. Miller’s book is blessed — and for lack of which Mr. Kitton’s book suffers. Completeness is one of the essentials of a good bibliography, or per- haps we should say a good measure of completeness, for in a large sub- ject like the present one, it is seldom that the ground can be thoroughly covered. Even if a bibliography is deliberately selective, yet it must be reasonably complete within the specified limits. While it would be too INTRODUCTION xii much to expect that no new Dickens material remains to be discovered, yet one who glances over Mr. Miller's compilation will find it hard to believe that many items have escaped his bibliographical net. The group- ing of the references by subjects, which at times may seem annoying to one who is looking for an individual entry, is nevertheless an essential, for it is the only way by which one may survey the whole field within a given category when he has no knowledge of the individual items. The noble index will reveal any given name or title. For achieving his task under somewhat trying conditions, the present compiler is deserving of no small praise. Living and working in this country for the past few years, separated by the Atlantic from his accumulation of materials, the verifying of many of his references has been arduous and, in some cases at least, I fear impossible.
