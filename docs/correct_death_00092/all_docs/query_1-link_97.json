        "text": "I love your Euentha sanderiana Myrle....you should post a thread with pictures and the culture you give the plant.\n\n*gardeningnewbie: since it is warm outdoors, you can take the plant out of the vase and hang it under a tree or somewhere with shaded bright light....the flowing air and the humidity in the atmosphere will heal the roots. Do not remove roots since sometimes you might think it is discolored but it is still functional. You need all the roots doing its work for the plant.\n\nThe leaves have mechanical damage. I don't think that is fungal or bacterial infestation. As long as the leaf damage is not growing big then you don't need to worry.\n\nWhen the frost comes then put it back inside the vase and place it on the brightest window sill\n\nYour tag is correct. They still call it Vanda sanderiana.\n\n\"Called \"Waling-waling\" in the Philippines (sold as cut flower in floral arrangements) and is also called Sander's Euanthe, after Henry Frederick Conrad Sander, a noted orchidologist. The orchid is revered and is worshiped as a diwata(deity) by the native Bagobo tribe in the southern islands.\n\nHeinrich Gustav Reichenbach originally named Euanthe sanderiana as Vanda sanderiana.\n\nIt has two forms, pink and white, also referred to as alba. M. Roebelin discovered the original pink variety in the Philippines in 1881 or 1882. Rudolf Schlechter separated Euanthe from Vanda in 1914 due to structural differences in the flowers. For breeding purposes and registration by the Royal Horticultural Society, however, it is still treated as a Vanda.\n\nThis just bloomed for me this spring but it blasted.\n\nMy thread two years ago:\n\nEuanthe sanderiana blooming in a glass vase\n\nThat is not a sign of bacterial infection on the leaves of your Vanda. It may be physical damage as well as some past damage from either cold, or a very minor past fungal infection that has since healed.\n\nThere are no signs of a fungal infection on the Vanda's roots. That silvery white coloration on the living, healthy roots of an orchid is a layer of dead cells that forms a spongey matrix on the outer surface of the root called velamen. In other words, it is normal.\n\nThe sections of roots that have become a light brown in color are dead, most likely from physical damage or some other kind of damage. That is nothing to worry about, because as you will see later on, (provided you are able to continue having this Vanda around for several years), that the sections of roots that are still alive, will sprout new root tips along any part of the length of the roots, and those will eventually grow out to become full blown roots.\n\nYou can also try growing your Vanda in a clear plastic pot with large grade fir bark.\n\nYou don't need to utilize vase culture.\n\nThe roots can adapt to moderately humid environments, it doesn't have to be extremely humid in order for your Vanda to grow properly. It was just that the Vanda you bought had been used to growing in a consistently humid greenhouse type setting for a long time, so there will be a little bit of an adjustment period to a lower humidity environment before it really takes off.\n\n@gardeningnewbie - What kind of Vanda is it? Do you know the name that's written on the tag of your Vanda?\n\n__________________\n\nPhilip\n\nLast edited by King_of_orchid_growing:); 08-26-2013 at 01:44 AM.."
