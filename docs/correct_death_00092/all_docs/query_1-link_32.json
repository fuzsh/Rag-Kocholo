        "text": "Historical background1\n\nOne will hardly find any scholar who was such an ardent and unconditional defender of Rudolf Schlechter as the late Karlheinz Senghas (1928-2004), who made the study of Schlechter’s work one of the goals of his life. Senghas (2002: 1) answers the question about the most important German orchidologists by using the term “the three Popes” when referring to Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach, or Reichenbach filius (1824-1899), from Hamburg (Fig. 1A), Ernst Hugo Heinrich Pfitzer (1846-1906) from Heidelberg (Fig. 1B) and Friedrich Richard Rudolf Schlechter (1872-1925), from Berlin (Fig. 2).\n\nOf these three, Rudolf Schlechter must be credited with having described the largest number of new orchid genera and species, monographic revisions of genera and subtribes, and national and regional orchid floras. The publication of Die Orchideen (1915) was, years before the end of his scientific work, the crowning moment of his career (Senghas, 2002: 1).\n\nA man of egoistic self-confidence and driving ambition, Schlechter had an enormous capacity for work and a remarkable memory; it is said that at an early age he had set for himself the goal of describing at least one new orchid every day and indeed he proposed in excess of 5,000.\n\nSchlechter was born on October 16, 1872 in Berlin, the third of six children. His father, Hugo Schlechter, was a lithographer. After finishing school at the Friedrich Wilhelm Gymnasium, he started education in horticulture, first at the market garden of Mrs. Bluth and then at the botanical garden of the University of Berlin. There he worked as an assistant until the autumn of 1891, when he left Europe on his first botanical expedition to southern Africa. He was only 19 years of age.\n\nAfter arriving in Cape Town he worked as a gardener and as an inspector of grape vines for phylloxera. He then was employed as an assistant in the private herbarium of Dr. Harry Bolus, where he must have learned quite a bit about the local flora from his employer2. Bolus’ herbarium was later acquired by Cape Town University. From 1891-1892 Schlechter collected plants in the surroundings of the city. After leaving Bolus in 1892, he explored other regions in the southern and eastern Cape, Transkei, Natal and Transvaal until 1895, when he returned to Europe and published his first paper on the plant family to which he would devote the rest of his life, the orchids3.\n\nSchlechter returned to Europe with copious collections of both asclepiads and orchids, on which he worked at the Botany Department of the British Museum in London. There he established a relationship with Alfred B. Rendle (1865-1938) (Fig. 3A). Together they later researched on the Asclepidaceae of tropical Africa4.\n\nIn 1896 Schlechter returned to southern Africa and was joined by his brother Max, with whom he travelled north to the Vanrhynsdorp district, returning to Cape Town that September. Between November 1896 and April 1897, they collected northwards to the Cedarberg and eastwards to Cape Agulhas. In August 1897 the two brothers set out for Namaqualand and reached the Orange River at Ramansdrift. Schlechter was then in Mozambique from late 1897 to early 1898. Dr. S. Schonland, director of the Albany Museum in Grahamstown (Eastern Cape Province), who received plants from Schlechter, described him as the most acute and most successful botanical collector who ever visited South Africa (Schonland, 1897: 5). Schlechter returned to the University of Berlin in April 1898, drained and weakened by dysentery and tropical fevers. This was nevertheles an important period for the young botanist, for he was able to work with such renowned colleagues as Heinrich Gustav Adolf Engler (1844-1930) (who was his tutor while writing his Ph.D. thesis) (Fig. 3B -4), Friedrich Ludwig Emil Diels (1874-1945) (Fig. 4) and Otto Warburg (1859-1938) (Fig. 5A). It was the latter, an economic botanist, who probably saw that Schlechter was hired by the German Colonial Department to lead an expedition to West Africa in search of latex-producing plants (the Westafrikanische Kautschuk-Expedition, 1899-1900) (Fig. 5B).\n\nOver the next decades Schlechter was continuously involved in expeditions, visiting Sumatra, Java, Celebes, Borneo, New Guinea and Australia. In 1901-1903, again under contract with the Colonial Department, he explored Malaysia, Indonesia, German New Guinea and the South Sea islands. He proceeded to Sydney and then New Caledonia in 1902, sailing back to Germany in 1903. After completing his doctoral thesis on the phytogeography of New Caledonia, he made another brief trip to West Africa to assess progress with the cultivation of Silkrubber (Funtumia elastica Stapf).\n\nIn 1906 he embarked on his longest and last expedition, this time back to the Malay archipelago, visiting Hong Kong, the Philippines, Sumatra, Borneo and New Guinea (which served as his base). Although he had been commissioned to establish a rubber research station at the Papuan village of Bulu, it is his botanical collections during this time for which he is best remembered. In 1910 he was back in Berlin, where he began his major work, Die Orchidaceen von Deutsch-Neu-Guinea. Published between 1911 and 1914, its 14 volumes numbered over 1,000 pages, in which he described about 1,500 new orchid species.\n\nSchlechter’s work had been preceded, after the death of Reichenbach, by Ernst Hugo Heinrich Pfitzer. Pfitzer, who since 1872 was professor and director of the Botanical Garden of Königsberg (Prussia), and dedicated himself to the classification of the Orchidaceae and published his Beiträge zur Systematik der Orchideen (Contributions to the Systematics of Orchids) in 1895.\n\nAnother contemporary of Schlechter was Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwig Kraenzlin (1847-1934) (Fig. 6). studied chemistry and botany at Berlin and Königsberg, receiving his Ph.D. in 1867. He later worked as an assistant to Wilhelm Hofmeister in Heidelberg and under Johannes von Hanstein at the University of Bonn. From 1872 to 1906 he was a professor and director of the botanical garden at Heidelberg. In the first edition of Die Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien5 (The natural families of plants), a work by Adolf Engler and Carl Prantl, Kraenzlin collaborated on the treatment on orchids.\n\nKraenzlin’s work was, however, severely criticized by many of his colleagues. Rudolf Schlechter was no exception. Writing to Oakes Ames on September 12, 1910, he gave his opinion on Kraenzlin’s monograph of Dendrobium: “I am very curious to see what Kränzlin’s monograph of Dendrobium will be like; from what I see in the Berlin Herbarium in the way of his determinations there will quite a lot of ridiculousness in it and this work will be the crown of foolishness in a man who really has not given a single usuable work to science in spite of his long years of work. Sometimes it almost appears to me as if he is not actually determinating his plants, but raffling them out.” And Ames was equally critical. On December 4, 1910 he replied to Schlechter on the same subject: “I have just received Dr. Kränzlin’s monograph of Dendrobium. I have not yet put it to the test, but in several places I have detected errors which are unpardonable and in every way avoidable.” Between collecting trips Schlechter continued his visits to London, always stopping in at the herbarium at Kew and the British Museum. He was considered an interesting figure, but being not respectful of persons or things, he was apt to tread on other people’s feelings and sensibilities. He was dogmatic in his convictions, a characteristic which did not assist in making him popular; but on the basis of his achievements and experience, he was accorded great respect (Reinikka, 1995: 294). Frequent visits were also made to the herbaria in Paris, Leiden, Brussels, and Vienna.\n\nShortly after his last expedition, Schlechter married Alexandra Sobennikoff, the daughter of a Russian merchant, with whom he raised two daughters. In 1925 he dedicated the Malagasy orchid genus Sobennikoffia to his wife.\n\nRudolf Schlechter became Secretary of the Orchid Committee of the German Horticultural Society in 1914, and in 1915 editor of the journal Orchis. In the same year he finished the publication of the last fascicle of the first edition of his Die Orchideen6, the work that has made him famous to the present day. The First World War interrupted Schlechter’s botanical career as he served as officer in the German Army during 1916 and 1917 (Fig. 7). After WWI and until his death in 1925 Schlechter focused on expanding his research collection of orchids.\n\nHis production of publications from his orchid research reached its highest point during this period. From a total of 333 publications by Schlechter, 233 were dedicated to Orchidaceae, with the description of some 170 new genera and over 5,500 new orchid species. Among his publications were descriptions of new genera and species, multiple revisions of orchid genera and 20 works about national and regional orchid floras.\n\nSchlechter spent the last 15 years of his career at the Berlin Botanical Museum, where he became a curator in 1921. He died at the relatively young age of 53, in 1925, apparently from the lingering effects of tropical diseases he had contracted during his expeditions. It was, however, fortunate that he did not live to see the destruction of one of his greatest achievements: his collections were destroyed along with the Berlin herbarium by allied bombing on the night of March 1, 1943 (Fig. 8).\n\nRudolf Schlechter’s name lives on in the genera Schlechteranthus Schwantes (Aizoaceae), Schlechteria Bolus ex Schltr. (Brassicaceae), Schlechterella K.Schum (Asclepidaceae), Schlechterina Harms (Passifloraceae) and Rudolfiella Hoehne (Orchidaceae). Forty-one orchid species carry his name.\n\nBibliographical background - Schlechter’s interest in tropical America\n\nRudolf Schlechter’s first contact with the orchids of South America’s vast territory (Fig. 9) was undoubtedly his study of the large collections of orchids by Friedrich Carl Lehmann (1850-1903) held by the British Museum in London. Lehmann began to sell herbarium specimens to the British Museum in 1888, and Robert A. Rolfe was engaged in describing them at Kew. When Schlechter arrived in London in 1898 after his first South- African expedition, the British Museum already had a significant number of Lehmann’s Colombian orchid specimens, although Lehmann’s early collections were buried in Vienna, together with the rest of Reichenbach’s Herbarium. Rudolf Schlechter, in his works of 1920 and 1924 on the Colombian orchid flora, made frequent reference to specimens collected by Lehmann.\n\nSchlechter’s publications on orchids that refer to South American orchids can be roughly divided into four periods: the years before WWI, especially those after his return from Papua & New Guinea in 1909 (21 publications); the war years (1914-1918, 30 publications); the postwar years, from 1919 to his death in 1925 (44 publications). There were, additionally, posthumous publications of his works by his wife, Alexandra, Rudolf Mansfeld and others (17 publications).\n\nSchlechter’s first publication on tropical orchids from the New World was a product of the return to Germany of Robert Knud Friedrich Pilger (1876-1953), who had travelled as a botanist with an expedition to the Matto Grosso, Brazil, led by Dr. Hermann Meyer (1871-1932), in the years 1899 and 1900. Pilger worked at the Botanical Museum in Berlin on the plants collected during his journey, contacting leading specialists in the different plant families to assist him in the determinations. Schlechter was chosen to work on his favorite family, the Orchidaceae, in Pilger’s Beitrag zur Flora von Mattogrosso (Pilger, 1901: 149-150) describing the relatively small number of 7 orchid species, of which only one (Habenaria pilgeri) was new to science.\n\nWe find the next two publications by Schlechter, describing a few new orchid species from Brazil and Colombia, five years later, in 1906. We then have to wait until 1910 to hear from him again. This unusually unproductive period has naturally to be ascribed to Schlechter’s long expeditions to Africa, South-East Asia, Australia, and Papua & New Guinea, which kept him away from Berlin during the best part of the first decade of the 20th century. There was a brief interlude from 1903 to 1906, the time he spent finishing his studies in Berlin and receiving his Ph.D.\n\nCorrespondence between individuals has always been one of the primary sources for those writing on history. In our case, we can count ourselves fortunate for being able to read and study the copious correspondence between Rudolf Schlechter and Oakes Ames (1874-1950) (Fig. 10) over a period of some fifteen years. This treasure is today well kept at the Oakes Ames Herbarium of Harvard University. It is not clear how Schlechter established the first contact with the great Harvard botanist, although it was presumably through common acquaintances at Kew. Ames, when writing about the destruction of the herbarium in Berlin (1944) says that “nearly half a century ago my acquaintance with Schlechter began.” This would have been coincidental with Schlechter’s visit to Kew after his first African expedition, so it must have been sometime between 1898 and 1900.\n\nOver 350 pages of letters -mostly typed in the case of Ames; always in his untidy handwriting by Schlechter- give us an impressive insight into each man’s particular circumstances and constitute a detailed timeline, especially with regard to Schlechter’s publications and his personal, difficult circumstances. Although their relationship grew through the years to one of deep friendship -to a point where the biography of either botanist during this period can only be written with constant mention of the other- the differences in character, as well as in economic and social standing, could hardly be more extreme. Schlechter came from a middle-class family and had to work his way up through untiring personal effort; Ames was born into a family of millionaires, the elite of the high socierty of New England (Fig. 11). Ames’ grandfather has been credited by many historians as being the single most important influence in the building of the Union Pacific portion of the transcontinental railroad. While Schlechter spent the first fifteen years of his mature life in extensive and exhausting expeditions through Africa, Southeast Asia, and Australia, developing a deep understanding of orchids in relation to their natural habitats, Ames hardly ever left the sumptuous comfort of his native Boston and his research on orchids was always based on herbarium specimens of plants which he had seldom seen growing in their natural habitats, or on the few living plants growing in the Harvard Botanic Garden.\n\nSchlechter was an incredibly hard worker who produced an average of over 20 publications per year, including such major works as his Die Orchideen; Ames, in his own words, was an intermittent worker who wandered from the job, ‘a slave of inclination’ as he defined himself, for whom there were months at a stretch when he considereed botanical work ‘a perfected form of torture’. His literary production -compared with that of Schlechter- was relatively meager. Schlechter was the most important orchidologist of his time, while Ames played a relatively smaller role.\n\nHowever, Ames amassed an orchid herbarium which, before being integrated into the larger collection of Harvard University, contained about 131,000 plant specimens, around 3,000 flowers in glycerin, 4,000 specimens in liquid and hundreds of line drawings that supplemented the specimens. Part of this herbarium were hundreds of duplicates and drawings received from Schlechter, and later Mansfeld, before the tragic bombing of the Berlin herbarium in 1943.\n\nWith time, Ames became instrumental in providing his German counterpart with information about tropical American orchids: over fifteen years he exchanged duplicates from his Central and South-American herbarium specimens with Schlechter. One could say that during important periods of their work on orchids, Ames and Schlechter became indispensable to each other.\n\nThe first record of Schlechter’s correspondence with Ames (August 3, 1908, from camp on Mount Komi, in what is now Papua New Guinea) is a letter in which he wrote: “I dare say I will be able to let you have a rather large number of Orchid specimens from here after my return to Europe and hope that you will have to offer some Orchid-material from Tropical- America in return, or perhaps the West-Indies?”. It is the first mention of Schlechter’s growing interest in the orchids of the New World tropics. A few months later, back in Germany, Schlechter wrote again (from Berlin, February 2, 1909) “I wish some American collectors would go to Venezuela and Columbia, there would be a fine harvest to be got. Perhaps they are leaving it to me yet […] If ever you visit Berlin when I am there you will most probably be astonished to find there in my possession an Orchid-Herbarium which as to number of specimens and condition of them especially can well rival with these of big public institutions, as from all my travels I have brought drawings of nearly all species I got hold of. As I got most old world countries pretty well represented now in my herbarium I am very anxious to get especially Tropical-American and am very pleased to exchange with you any material you can spare from Central- and South America as well as the West-Indies. […] Perhaps after a few years I will make a trip to Tropical America myself to get things better from there. However, this is not quite certain yet“ (Fig. 12).\n\nAnd then again (from Berlin, December 2, 1910): “I am very keen on any material from Central- or South America, as these countries are not well represented in my herbarium. […] …you can perhaps get me New- World-Orchids.”\n\nShortly after this letter Schlechter finally started to work on South-American orchids. In yet another letter, this time from Riga (Latvia), on August 27, 1912, he told Ames: “At present I got some larger collections from South-America, Madagascar and Borneo to go through.”\n\nFrom 1910 the years immediately preceding WWI were immensely productive: Schlechter published a total of 22 papers in which he described South American orchids. As to Ames, Schlechter’s last letter to him before the war was dated May 10, 1914. He would not write again until Aug. 31, 1919.\n\nA fortunate event for Schlechter was the publication by botanist Friedrich Karl Georg Fedde (1873-1942) (Fig. 13) of a long series of booklets under the general title Repertorium specierum novarum regni vegetabilis (Fig. 14A).\n\nFedde studied natural sciences, beginning in 1892 and graduating in 1896 in Breslau. After working as a teacher in schools of higher learning in several German cities, he became an associate at the Berlin Botanical Museum in 1901 and a professor there in 1912. Fedde took part in several collecting trips to Southern Europe, Finland, and South Russia. Beginning in 1910, Fedde would publish most of Schlechter’s works until the latter’s death in 1925. Among the first publications by Fedde were Schlechter’s well-known series of articles: Orchidaceae novae et criticae. In 21 of these articles Schlechter described, among others, an important number of new South-American orchid species.\n\nThe second most important journal that published Schlechter’s works was Orchis(Fig. 14B) (published from Vol.3, 1909, as part [Beilage] of the journal Gartenflora), the monthly journal of the German Orchidological Society, from 1906 until its disappearance in 1920, which was edited by Schlechter himself. A total of 31 of his articles were published in this periodical, among them his long series entitled Neue und seltene Garten-Orchideen (New and rare garden orchids), in which he described dozens of new orchids from Tropical America.\n\nBy 1914 Schlechter had already formed a ‘network’ of collaborators who supplied him with orchid species for determination. At first, his relations were with important orchid growers and collectors in Germany, such as Karl Wilhelm John in Andernach-on-the Rhine, Otto Beyrodt in Marienfelde, the Gardens of Herrenhausen in Hannover, Julius Wrede in Berlin- Dahlem, Wilhelm Hennis in Hildesheim and Baron Max von Fürstenberg, owner of an orchid collection and President of the recently founded German Society of Orchidology. From Ireland, he received plants from Frederic W. Moore, curator of the Botanic Gardens in Glasnevin. The legacy of Friedrich Carl Lehmann, the German plant collector in Colombia who had died in 1903, was another important source of research material. Contact with Oakes Ames at Harvard again gave him the opportunity to receive more South- American material through the exchange of his African and Asian duplicates.\n\nAmong the first collectors on American soil from whom he received plants were Ernst Ule, who collected in Brazil, Guayana, Venezuela and Peru, Christian Theodor Koch (Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela), Eugène Langlassé (Colombia), Henrik Franz Alexander von Eggers (Ecuador), Eugene Köhler (Peru), Carl Pflanz (Bolivia), Otto August Buchtien (Bolivia), Robert Statham Williams (Bolivia), Karl August Gustav Fiebrig (Bolivia, Paraguay), Henri François Pittier (Venezuela, Colombia), Theodor Carl Julius Herzog (Bolivia, Argentina), Louis Mille and Luigi Aloysius Sodiro (Ecuador), Per Karl Haljmar Dusen (Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay), Georg Hans Emmo Hieronymus, and H. Wendt (Argentina, Brazil). Quite an impressive number of collectors and botanists, as one can see.\n\nDespite having to serve in the military, Schlechter published an additional 28 papers in the period between 1914 and 1919, a remarkable number under the conditions in Germany during those years. Noteworthy from that time were Schlechter’s monographic treatments on a number of orchid genera, among them Anguloa, Cycnoches, Coryanthes, Laelia, Acineta, Aganisia, Cochlioda, Houletia, and Brasssavola. Of great interest also was his second regional flora (after Mattogrosso in 1901), in which (1919) he determined Per Karl Dusen’s orchid collections from the Brazilian province of Paraná. The Notizblatt des Königlichen7Botanischen Gartens und Museums zu Berlin, edited by A. Engler (Fig. 15A) (in its later years, 1918-1924, after the abdication of Emperor Wilhelm II, simply Notizblatt des Botanischen Gartens und Museums zu Berlin) was another important means for Schlechter to see his works published.\n\nSchlechter complained in several of his writings that because of the war he received very little new material from collectors in America. This explains the relatively small number of new species described by him during that period. Nevertheless, many new names of orchid growers, collectors and botanists appeared in this period among Schlechter’s orchid suppliers to expand his already important ‘network’. Among them, we count orchid growers Paul Wolter in Magdeburg-Wilhelmsburg, R. Blossfeld in Potsdam and Hartmann in Nieder-Höchstadt; and the plant collectors Karl Immanuel Eberhard Ritter von Goebel (Brazil), Johann Heinrich Rudolf Schenck (Brazil), Emil Hassler (Paraguay, Guyana), and Carl Grossmann (Brazil).\n\nImmediately after the war, Schlechter began to work on one of his most ambitious projects regarding the orchids of Tropical America: his series of publications about the orchid flora of the Andean states (Die Orchideenfloren der südamerikanischen Kordillerenstatten).\n\nCommunications across the Atlantic slowly resumed after the end of the war, and on August 31, 1919 Schlechter was once again able to correspond with Ames: “At last there is a chance again to communicate with foreign countries and so I will take a chance to try to send you a letter. […] I expect the enumeration of the Central-American orchids will at present interest you most. But besides there is in print […] an enumeration of the Orchid-Flora of Venezuela … […] The Orchid-flora of Venezuela is an enumeration of all the Orchids until now known from there! A number of new species I have added, and remarks on the features of the Orchid-flora. I have found that such compilations are of the greatest use and especially for the South-American Andes-states they were badly needed. […] For Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia the manuscripts are finished too and are going to be printed in the course of the next months. This work has considerable widened my knowledge of certain types, the more so as I have used the chances to study enormous materials more closely. 8 […] After the publication of the Orchid-floras of the Andes-states we will have a fair knowledge of the distribution of the different types, the more so as I have been making remarks in the general part on the distribution of each species and the affinities of each flora.”\n\nVolume I of Schlechter’s Orchideenfloren der Kordillerenstaaten (Fig. 15B) was finally published at the end of 1919. A number of new names were added to Schlechter’s “network”, among them Paul Rudolf Preuss, O.K.S. Passarge and Selwyn, Salomon Briceño, Everard Ferdinand Im Thurn, and F.V. McConnell and J.J. Quelch.\n\nIn the same letter of August 31, 1919, Schlechter described his personal difficulties in a country that was experiencing the trauma of the lost war: “the difficulties are numerous ones too, because now here in Germany the educated people are in comparison with the cost of daily life altogether underpaid and the costs of printing have risen to about four times the costs of before the war. I actually would best of all like to leave Germany and go somewhere else where one would have the chance to properly continue scientific work under more favorable circumstances. But perhaps things will develop yet again more favorably; until now I can’t see very brightly into the future.”\n\nSouth American orchids became the center of Rudolf Schlechter’s attention during the following months. In further letters to Ames he described the progress and difficulties of his project. So, on September 24, 1919: “For my winter work I had planned to determine the Colombian collections of the U. S. National Herbarium and of the New York Botanical Garden Herbarium. I wanted to do this work in order to get my set of Lehmann orchids ready for inclusion in my Herbarium. If your papers on the Colombian orchids are ready soon, please send them to me at your earliest convenience. They will save me the work of searching the literature for a list of Colombian species. I hope you have included, the numbers of specimens you have examined in these lists of yours and that you worked on the Lehmann collections.”\n\nOctober 22, 1919: “My list of Colombian Orchids is ready for print and I hope to bring the whole volume out before the end of the year. […] I have described over 250 new Colombia Orchids and 5 or 6 new genera. Quite a lot of Lehmann’s things are included and the plants from Sta. Martha collected by H.H. Smith… […] the more we progress with the printing of the work the more difficulties we have got to get sufficient funds for the publications together. […] Could you not perhaps interest some of the botanical circles in your country, that they might supply us with sufficient funds by suscribing for the publication of these lists? […] These lists are going to be published in five parts under the title “Die Orchideenfloren der südamerikanischen Kordillerenstaaten” I. Venezuela, II, Colombia, III Ecuador, IV Peru, V. Bolivia.”\n\nAn important role in Schlechter’s “network” was played by Celestin Alfred Cogniaux (1841-1916) (Fig. 16), the great Belgian botanist and specialist on South American orchids. Cogniaux had worked for years with Adolf Engler (Director of the Berlin Botanical Garden between 1889 and 1921) and Ignaz Urban (1948-1931) (Fig. 4) (Assistant Director of the Berlin Botanical Garden and Museum from 1889 to 1913), being in charge of the Orchidaceae in the monumental Flora Brasiliensis and later the not less important Symbolae Antillanae seu fundamenta Florae Indiae Occidentalis. Engler and Urban also had close working relations with Rudolf Schlechter. Therefore, when Cogniaux had to retire because of his age and health9, Schlechter took over as his logical successor, describing the Orchidaceae in volume VII (fascicle IV, August 1913) and volume VIII (fascicle I, February 1920) of the Symbolae Antillanae. Thus, on November 11, 1919, Schlechter was able to write to Ames: “I have not made a list of the Lehmann determinations, but Cogniaux before he died has sent me, as he wished that I should continue his work on the South- American orchids, a book in which he had entered all the determinations that he has found of the different collectors in literature and that he made himself.”\n\nIn the above-mentioned letter of August 31, 1919, Schlechter proposed to Ames that they take part in a new, ambitious project: a new and updated version of John Lindley’s famous work, Folia Orchidaceae10: “In fact, I very much hope that we will do yet a lot of work under combined authorship. I am much reckoning on you for the eventual cooperation on the ‘Folia Orchidaceae’, because as such I would think it best to bring out a future monograph of the Orchidaceae. This has the advantage that one can choose the genera as one has got material for the work.”\n\nSchlechter wrote to Ames several times about this idea until, after months of impatient pressure, on April 23, 1920, Ames finally replied: “I am very much interested in the new ‘FOLIA’. I would enjoy working with you, although I am afraid that the difference in our speed would throw the bulk of the labor on your shoulders. I am an intermittent worker; that is I am a slave of inclination, and there are months at a stretch when I find botanical work of any kind a perfected form of torture. You might not enjoy collaboration with a man who wanders from the job. […] I have in mind a painstaking, thorough job of each genus or section of a genus we attack. […] Although we would of course work independently on the genera we undertook to do, we ought to agree at the beginning that we would submit our manuscript to the other man before final going to the press […].” This however could not stop Schlechter, who replied on May 9, 1920: “What you write about your own way of working intermittently cannot hinder us. I am myself, this I know, a fairly hard worker and will see to it that the work progresses. It is my ambition, and I hope it will be yours too, that we should be able to finish a monograph of all the Orchidaceae before our lives are finished. […] For the title of the work I would propose ‘Folia Orchidaceae’ by Oakes Ames and R. Schlechter”. And he continued: “… my plans are the following. We could work out the different genera separately, starting of course with the smallest ones, but at the same time bringing out now and then a larger one. The descriptions and the general way of publishing should be similar to the one adopted by Lindley, but each genus gets a systematical number, for which, as they are now fairly known, with slight alteration we could adapt the numbers as they are given in my book ‘Die Orchideen’.”\n\nMeanwhile, Schlechter continued working and publishing on South American orchids. The remaining years of his short life (1919-1925) were at the same time among his most productive. A large number of his publications during that period made reference to South-American orchids. One of his most outstanding accomplishments was the completion of his series about the orchid floras of the Andean states, his famous Orchideenfloren der südamerikanischen Kordillerenstaaten.\n\nThe above-mentioned volume I (Venezuela, 1919) was followed in 1920 by volume II, Colombia; in 1921 by volumes III Ecuador and IV, Peru; and finally, in 1922, by volume V, Bolivia.\n\nAfter finishing volume II, Schlechter ran out of funds for the remaining three volumes. Having received no answer to his petition to Ames of October 1919, Schlechter touched the same subject again on December 17, 1920: “As I have written to you already, my manuscripts with the compilations of the orchid floras of Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia are ready for print since a long time. Printing costs have however got so high here on account of our bad valuta, that Fedde has no funds to go on with the publication. […] …at the present state of our valuta this would roughly cost about 450 Dollars […] Would it not be possible for you to help me in this matter by recommending me perhaps to some firm or by getting the suscriptions together?” On January 8th, 1921 Ames replied: “Now with regard to Dr. Fedde and the monographs of the orchids of Ecuador, Bolivia, etc. I can advance $ 450 out of my own pocket and if this suggestion meets with your approval let me know and I will send you the amount. If you approve of the suggestion perhaps you will see to it that I receive my copies on a very high grade of paper. I will give orders to have one hundred dollars sent to you to-morrow. When you receive this you can start printing and the balance will be forwarded when I hear from you that my suggestion is welcome. I am very anxious to help orchidology in every way and it is a great pleasure to hasten the monographs to which you have referred.” The arrangement was confirmed after Schlechter had promised that the money would be well applied (January. 27, 1921), and so Schlechter was able to write in the epilogue of his Orchideenfloren (Bolivia, vol. V, 1922): “I was fortunate that Prof. Oakes Ames, in Boston, put at my disposal the means which guaranteed the completion of the printing of this work.” Ames finally sent $210 to Schlechter to begin printing, the rest came soon afterwards (Fig. 17).\n\nAmes and Schlechter’s relationship lasted over the years and it was undoubtedly a fruitful one. While Ames had the economic means to pursue his interests, from which Schlechter drew great benefits, Schlechter was the higher botanical authority in this partnership. As an example of this, the International Plant Names Index from Kew Botanic Gardens (status April 2019) cites a total of 7,712 new species and combinations described by Schlechter, while for Oakes Ames it mentions just 1,627. Ames continuously sent orchid specimens to Berlin for determination, and Schlechter profited from Ames, who untiringly made the greatest efforts to procure new orchid specimens: In a letter dated June 25, 1921 Ames wrote: “I have just sent a collector to South America with the Mulford Biological Exploration Expedition to the Amazon basin11. This, I am sure will be good news for you as there will be a set of duplicates for your collection. As the expedition is to be in the field for fifteen months, most of the time in unexplored territory, there should he some new material for us.” At the same time, work on the Folia Orchidaceae continued: on September 12, 1921, Ames sent a draft of his proposed title page for the Folia Orchidaceae: Folia Orchidaceae / Auctoribus / Oakes Ames et Rudolf Schlechter / Boston / MCMXXI (Fig. 18).\n\nIn what would be his last trip outside of Germany, again financed by Ames, Schlechter spent two weeks at the Reichenbach Herbarium in Vienna, studying and making tracings of Reichenbach’s orchid types from the Philippines.\n\nIn March of 1922 Ames made the decision to travel to Europe and meet Schlechter in person: “I want to let you know that I have decided to sail for England on June 28th, and that I am planning to be in Berlin either in July or August. I feel that we must discuss through some better medium than letters the details of our proposed undertaking, therefore I am coming to you, reluctantly on the one hand, eagerly, on the other. To leave home now means many sacrifices. But I cannot see how we can arrive at a working agreement without sitting face to face for a while. And, furthermore, the pleasure and profit of a meeting with you will repay me a thousandfold for the penalties of travel and the loss of results to be obtained by a summer of work at home.”\n\nIn August of 1922, Ames arrived in Berlin and had finally the opportunity of meeting Rudolf Schlechter in person. Ames described the moment with these words: “In the Orchid Herbarium of Harvard University there is a watercolor drawing which represents a flower of Stanhopea Ruckeri. This drawing is, in my estimation, of unusual interest because the original specimen from which it was made was instrumental in introducing Schlechter to me in a crowded railroad station in Berlin (Fig. 19). At this time I lacked knowledge of what Schlechter looked like, and he was in complete ignorance of what I might look like. […] As I walked along the platform I saw a man of medium height coming toward me, pushing his way slowly through the out-going crowd. He held a large spray of Stanhopea Ruckeri in his outstreched hand. It was not necessary for me to say: “Dr. Schlechter, I presume?”, The glorious spray of Stanhopea Ruckeri was a flauntig badge of his identity” (Ames, 1944: 106).\n\nMeanwhile, Schlechter’s ‘network’ continued growing as new names were added to the already long list of purveyors to his herbarium. Worthy of mention are: Albert William Bartlett (British Guiana), F. Schickendanz (Argentina), Wilhelm Gustav Franz Herter, Georg Huebner, Joao Geraldo Kuhlmann (Brazil), Herbert Huntington Smith, Erich (Eric) Bungeroth, H. Hopf, Werner Hopp, Gustav Schmidtchen, K. Sonntag, Richard Schnitter, M.A. Stübel, Wilhelm Kalbreyer (Colombia), E. K. Köhler, A. Köhler, Alexander Weberbauer, and Serafín Filomeno (Peru) and Jose Steinbach (Bolivia).\n\nBack to the Folia Orchidaceae. Progress was seemingly slow. Impatiently, Schlechter wrote on November 25, 1922: “What about our ‘Catalogue of Orchids’, and what about the ‘Folia’? I am very anxious to start.” But Ames did not have good news for Schlechter. On December 14, 1922 he wrote:“[…] the present time seems very unpropitious for any heavy undertaking in the way of printing. […] a few days ago I mailed to you a little pamphlet which I had privately printed because our magazines are very much hampered by the printing conditions in this country and by a falling off of subscriptions with increases in the cost to subscribers.” The situation in the United States as well as in Germany did not improve, and the project of a new Folia Orchidacea was not mentioned again in Ames’ and Schlechter’s correspondence, a correspondence that slowly started to fade away. For the first time there appeared disagree- ment between the two botanists. In a letter dated December 16, 1923, Ames complained12: “I am sorry that your remarks under Epidendrum ionophlebium on page 120, indicate that you regard my treatment of E. Hoffmannii as breach of trust. Before going to Europe in the summer of 1922, 1 devoted the greater part of the winter of 1921 to a critical and bibliographical study of Epidendrum, and it was at this time, not after my return from Europe, that I had arrived at the conclusions published in several numbers of Schedulae Orchidianae. […] 1 have no desire to forestall you or to use your confidences for publication. If that spirit had governed my work I could have rushed into print with Powell’s new species, long before you published your paper, because I had a nearly complete set from the Kew Herbarium in my possession at a time when Powell had given me every reason to be hostile.”\n\nA growing rivalry on Ames’ part can be found in his correspondence with Charles H. Lankester (1879- 1969) (Fig. 20), a British subject who had arrived in Costa Rica in 1900 and stayed in this country (with brief interruptions) until his death. Lankester began collecting orchids, of which Ames described over 100 species that were new to science. The same is the case in Ames’ correspondence with Charles Wesley Powell (1854-1927), an American orchid collector from Panama’s Canal Zone.\n\nA few phrases from Ames’ letters to Lankester give a good idea of how, in Ames’ opinion, German botany in general and Schlechter in particular were endangering the supremacy of U.S. botany in tropical America: “We must work fast if we hope to keep abreast of the Germans. I was surprised to see how far reaching their efforts have been to secure a monopoly of tropical American species” (Sept. 17, 1922) …. “If you decide to make specimens for me, please begin as soon as possible. Time is very precious” (October 10, 1922). “I wish we could get out another number of Sched. Orch. based on your work. We might beat Schlechter and give him food for thought” (May 28, 1923).\n\nAs to his correspondence with Powell, Ames wrote on September 14, 1921: “I understand that, you are now sending specimens to Rudolf Schlechter of Berlin. Although Dr. Schlechter and I are colleagues and at this time are working jointly on a monograph of the orchids of the world, it seems to me too bad that American material should be sent abroad. We surely can do the work in this country and I intend to do my best to handle material that is sent in to me for determination. Now that my poor friend Rolfe has gone I feel that it is my duty to do my best to keep up orchidology for English speaking people, not that I think for a minute that science is national, but that I dread to contemplate the future if our types are to be buried in a foreign land.” To which Powell replied on October 10: “Before replying to the main questions in your letter of the 14th I wish to clear myself of the unsaid, but the implied charge of unpatriotism in sending my specimens to Europe instead of to the U.S. I am a native of Virginia and my forbears have a recorded and traceable history in that State since the year 1635, hence I could not be unpatriotic.”\n\nThe misunderstanding was soon forgotten, but Ames used every opportunity to keep Powell aware of the German competition. December 12, 1922: “I wish we could keep Schlechter out of the American field. Otherwise there is bound to be a great deal of confusion owing to the simultaneous publication of species. I hope you will come to agree with me that it is for the best interests of American science to dissuade correspondents from sending material to Berlin.” Powell replied on December 20: “After about a week I will write Dr Schlechter telling him of our new arrangement, and that under it I feel that I am under the obligation to send all future specimens to you. This will give him time to receive my letter of today with the money, and to put the matter in the hands of the printers. Thus insuring that he will not hold it up. Sub-rosa, I do not trust the Germans, not to engage in a little spite work.” Ames had won the game. Powell enclosed a draft of the letter he intended to send to Schlechter: “My dear Dr Schlechter: I have entered into a contract with Dr Oakes Ames, of Boston, to make a complete orchideological survey of the Isthmus of Panama -- he financing the undertaking. My men are now out going thither and yon in pursuit of this end. As it is incompatible with this contract that I should send any specimens from this time to any other person or garden than to him; specimens in future, can only be procured from him.”\n\nBut these phrases can give us a wrong picture. In spite of the growing rivalry, Ames respected and admired Schlechter throughout his life. Let us see other expressions, again in Ames’ correspondence with Lankester: “From the South of France, Col. Godfrey writes that Schlechter is seriously ill... I have not heard from Schlechter for over four months, and I had begun to fear that he was angry or in some way provoked by some act of mine” (March 23, 1924).\n\nPersonal circumstances on both sides gave additional motives for the lack of communication between Ames and Schlechter, especially during the year of 1924. On April 8, Schlechter explained: “I had already for some time the intention to write to you. My serious illness and feebleness has been preventing me from doing it before now. […] It was not only the sickness that gave me the knock-out, but also the whole financial disaster, which made us loose nearly everything that one has had.” And Ames had reasons of his own, as he made clear on January 20, 1925: “My co-trustee in the estate created by my father, suddenly and unexpectedly, committed suicide, about the middle of September. This sad event threw on my shoulders the full burden of business that is essential to my family. I had to begin the disagreeable task of spending most of my time in the city and in offices.”\n\nFinally, on December 3, 1925 came the tragic news. Ames wrote to Lankester: “I should not have begun this letter with a reference to myself. I should have expressed to you my deep sorrow at the news that came in this noon from Alexandra Schlechter. Schlechter died early in November. I had known of his illness and on the ninth of December I sent aid to Mrs. Schlechter to meet the heavy burden of a hospital bill. But I had been led to believe that there were hopes for recovery. What a place the old world is. There comes a time when death plays round us like heat lightning. And then it begins to thin the ranks of those we called friends. It is a wonder we are able to carry on.”\n\nDuring the last years of Schlechter’s life, Ames received duplicates from Schlechter’s orchids (Fig. 21), and carried the cost of having pencil tracings made from a great number of Schlechter’s orchid types. It is due to this fortunate decision that an important part of Schlechter’s material was preserved and saved from the destruction of the Berlin Herbarium in 1943. Hundreds of drawings were prepared under Schlechter’s supervision. His wife, Alexandra, took over after his death, and continued arranging to have new tracings made according to Ames’ indications (Fig. 22-23A-B). In Oakes Ames’ last letter to Alexandra Schlechter, in the Harvard files, dated February 14, 1926, he wrote: “I can not thank you enough for the tracings of Stelis and Pleurothallis. These are a valuable addition to my herbarium and give me just the information I need to facilitate any work on the Costa Rican orchid flora. I have a long list of other species regarding which I would like to have similar information. Would it be too much to ask of you, that you have tracings of then made? Without tracings it will be difficult to ascertain the finer details which are essential for satisfactory work. Please help me if you can. I have underlined the species which are important so that you can select the ones to do first.” The letter ends with a several-pages-long list containing Ames’ desiderata. In her last recorded letter of June 25, 1926, Alexandra answers: “I am very glad to hear the first tracings reached you safely and have found your approval. I hope by now you received the second letter with the rest of the drawings. I am happy to having been able to do something for you.”\n\nOther images of Schlechter’s herbarium were preserved in a unique type photograph collection housed in the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. The collection originated in 1929, when James Francis Macbride, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, traveled to Europe to photograph herbarium specimens of nomenclatural types. The intent was to make the photographs available to American botanists unable to finance travels to European herbaria; the widespread adoption of the loan process was not as fully developed as it is today, necessitating travel for consultation.\n\nOver a ten years, Macbride photographed type specimens of tropical American plants at the following major herbaria: Berlin, Copenhagen, Geneva, Hanover, Hamburg, Madrid, Munich, Paris, and Vienna, using Berlin-Dahlem and Geneva as bases of operation. His sojourn in Europe resulted in more than 40,000 photographic negatives. Duplicate collections, types, and type fragments of authentic material were selected and sent to The Field Museum as exchange (Fig. 23C-D, 24). The results were of immediate importance to American systematic botany, but acquired added meaning following the destruction of parts of some European herbaria during World War II (Field Museum of Natural History 2018).\n\nFinally, additional photographs and some pages of Schlechter’s original type-written manuscripts with the description of new species have been preserved, i.e. at the Geneva Delessert Herbarium.\n\nAfter Schlechter’s death Rudolf Mansfeld (1901- 1960) (Fig. 25) edited a Figuren-Atlas (Fig. 26-27). It contained 558 analytical drawings in 142 plates of South American orchids new to science and described by Schlechter in the five volumes of his Orchideenfloren der Kordillerenstaaten; a further proof of his incredible capacity of work. Mansfeld was for over twenty years curator of the Botanical Garden and Museum of Berlin- Dahlem, where he specialized in orchids and was responsible for the publication of several of Schlechter’s unfinished works. In 1937 he suggested a revision of Schlechter’s system13. Mansfeld’s ideas were, however, largely ignored by the users of Schlechter’s system.\n\nThe deaths of Celestin A. Cogniaux in 1916 and of Robert A. Rolfe in 1921, followed by that of Schlechter in 1925, marked the beginning of the decline in European orchidology. Europe’s dominant position was slowly replaced by that of the United States, led by Oakes Ames, and by over a dozen formidable botanists and botanical institutions during the rest of the 20th century.\n\nRudolf Schlechter’s publications on South American Orchidaceae\n\nThe following is a list of the complete publications by Rudolf Schlechter on the Orchidaceae of South America. The list is organized by countries, and divided in two sections: 1) national and regional orchid floras, specific collectors; 2) publications on specific orchid tribes and subtribes, genera or species. Within each country, the publications are in chronological order. In addition, Schlechter’s collectors and other members of his ‘network’ are listed. Finally, we show the genera and species new to science described by Schlechter from each of the South American countries. Probably neither list, whether of publications, collectors or plant names, is complete. Although the authors have made all efforts researching in available material, one or the other name, or publication, may have escaped their attention.\n\nBrazil (Fig. 28)\n\nNational and regional orchid floras, specific collectors\n\n1901 Schlechter, R.
