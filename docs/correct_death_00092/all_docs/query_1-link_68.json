[2]\n\nReichenbach in U.S.\n\nThe most Reichenbach families were found in the USA in 1880. In 1840 there were 10 Reichenbach families living in Pennsylvania. This was about 91% of all the recorded Reichenbach's in the USA. Pennsylvania had the highest population of Reichenbach families in 1840. In 1880 there were 175 Reichenbach families living in Pennsylvania. This was about 41% of all the recorded Reichenbach's in the USA. Pennsylvania had the highest population of Reichenbach families in 1880. In 1920 there were 118 Reichenbach families living in Pennsylvania. This was about 38% of all the recorded Reichenbach's in the USA. Pennsylvania had the highest population of Reichenbach families in 1920.\n\nReichenbach Occupations\n\nUnited States:\n\nFarmer 21%\n\nLaborer 11%\n\nKeeping House 6%\n\nCarpenter 5%\n\nIn 1880, a less common occupation for the Reichenbach family was Carpenter. The most common Reichenbach occupation in the USA was Farmer. 21% of Reichenbach's were Farmers. Farmer, Laborer and Keeping House were the top 3 reported jobs worked by Reichenbach. [3]\n\nLife Expectancy\n\nBetween 1948 and 2004, Reichenbach life expectancy was at its lowest point in 1953, and highest in 2002. The average life expectancy for Reichenbach in 1948 was 55, and 74 in 2004. [4] [5]\n\nTown of Reichenbach\n\nReichenbach:\n\nThe name Reichenbach could indicate according to the \"Historical Settlement Name Book of the Palatinate\" by Martin Dolch and Albrecht Greule on a place in water-rich area.\n\nReichenbach had a great importance in Roman times. Witness is the mighty tower of the Protestant church, which was formerly integrated into a diverse defense system. This also includes the so-called \"Burgweg\", which came from the north of the Reichenbacher district coming on the Roman road to Donnersberg.\n\nIt is not beyond doubt whether Celtic or Roman manuscript stands behind the fortification. It is certain that this place with its hill around today's church square was an important place at all times.\n\nOtto I, the son of Ludwig II, who got the Nahegau as inheritance from the empire of Charlemagne, gave 945 Reichenbach ago. The vassal Franko received in his forest \"Lutara\" six royal hooves (these are the smallest peasant property). These were partly well-managed royal farms. The king witnessed his donation with his handwritten signature.\n\nOver time, the village went over again in new ownership. Around 1291, the Counts of Veldenz owned the lands, which included Reichenbach. Reichenbach becomes a sub-office in the Landvogtei in Speyergau.\n\nReichenbach was already since 1346 a Schultheißerei, that is, there was a court with a mayor, several lawyers and a court clerk.\n\nBetween 1794 and 1803 the \"Reichenbacher court\" was constricted under the strict rule of the French. Only the Napoleonic \"Code civil\" brought a new order.\n\n1817 came the \"Reichenbacher office\" under the supremacy of Bavaria. Rheinbayern or the Rhine district experienced a complete reorganization of the state apparatus. In the place of the nobles came a new civil servant status, which was subject only to the state.
