        "text": "One thing I love about orchids is that they are so diverse. One could spend their entire life studying these plants and never run out of surprises. Every time I sit down with an orchid topic in mind, I end up going down a rabbit hole of immeasurable depth. I love this because I always end up learning new and interesting facts. For instance, I only recently learned that there is a genus of orchids that has been given the unbelievably complex name of Aa.\n\nNo, that is not an abbreviation. The genus was literally named Aa. As far as I have been able to tell, it is pronounced “ah” rather than “ay,” but if any linguists are reading this and beg to differ, please chime in! Regardless, I was floored by this silly exercise in plant naming and had to learn more. I had never heard of this genus before and figured that it was so obscure that it probably contained, at most, only a small handful of species. This assumption was wrong.\n\nThough by no means massive, the genus Aa contains at least 25 recognized species. A quick search of the literature even turned up a few relatively recent papers describing new species. Apparently we have a ways to go in understanding their diversity. Nonetheless, this is an interesting and pretty genus of orchids.\n\nFrom what I gather, Aa are most often found growing at high elevations in the Andes, though at least one species is native to mountainous areas of Costa Rica. They are terrestrial orchids that prefer cooler temperatures and fairly moist soil. Some species are said to only be found in close proximity to mountain streams. Some of the defining features of the genus are a tall inflorescence jam packed with tiny inconspicuous, greenish-white flowers. The flowers are surrounded by semi-transparent sheaths that are surprisingly showy. All in all, they kind of remind me of a mix between Spiranthes and Goodyera.\n\nBut what about the name? Why in the world was this genus given such a strange and abrupt moniker? The answer seems to be the silliest option I could think of: to be first. This genus was originally described in 1845 by German botanist Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach who recognized two species within the genus Altensteinia to be distinct enough to warrant their own genus.\n\nAccording to most sources I could find, he coined this new genus Aa so that it would appear first on all taxonomic lists. There is at least one other report that the name was given in honor of a man by the name of Pieter van der Aa, but apparently this is “highly” disputed. However, all of this should be taken with a grain of salt. Though I can find plenty of literature describing various species within the genus, I could turn up no actual literature on the naming of the genus itself. All I could find is what has been repeated (almost verbatim) from Wikipedia.\n\nSo, there you have it. Not only does the genus Aa exist, it is still top of the list of all plant genera. If that truly was the goal Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach was aiming for, he certainly has succeeded!\n\nPhotos via Wikimedia Commons\n\nFurther Reading: [1]\n\nGrowing up, Fraser fir (Abies fraseri) was a fairly common sight in our house. Each winter this species would usually win out over other options as the preferred tree for our living room during the holiday season. Indeed, its pleasing shape, lovely color, and soft needles have made it one of the most popular Christmas trees around the world. Amazingly, despite its popularity as a decoration, Fraser fir is so rare in the wild that it is considered an endangered species.\n\nFraser fir is native to only a handful of areas in the southern Appalachian Mountains. Together with red spruce (Picea rubens), this conifer makes up one of the rarest ecosystems on the continent - the southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest. Such forests only exist at elevations above 4,000 ft (1,200 m) from southwestern Virginia to western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee. The reason for this limited distribution is rooted in both modern day climate and North America’s glacial past.\n\nWhereas anyone hiking through Appalachian spruce-fir forests could readily draw similarities to boreal forests found farther north, the Appalachian spruce-fir forests are nonetheless unique, hosting many species found nowhere else in the world. Indeed, these forests are holdovers from the Pleistocene when the southeast was much cooler than it is today. As glaciers retreated and the climate warmed, Appalachian spruce-fir forests “retreated” up the mountains, following their preferred climate zones until they hit the peaks of mountains and couldn’t go any further.\n\nIndeed, Fraser fir is in large part limited in its distribution by temperature. This conifer does not perform well at high temperatures and is readily out-competed by other species under warmer conditions. Another factor that has maintained Appalachian spruce-fir forests at elevation is fog. The southern Appalachian Mountains host eastern North America’s only temperate rainforest and fog commonly blankets high elevation areas throughout the year. Research has shown that in addition to keeping these areas cool, fog also serves as an important source of water for Fraser fir and its neighbors. As fog condenses on its needles, these trees are able to absorb that water, keeping them hydrated even when rain is absent.\n\nDue to its restricted habitat, Fraser fir has never been extremely common. However, things got even worse as Europeans colonized North America. Over the past two centuries, unsustainable logging and grazing practices have decimated southern Appalachian spruce-fir forests, fragmenting them into even smaller patches with no connectivity in between. In areas where thin, rocky soils were not completely washed away, Fraser fir seedlings did return, however, this was not always the case. In areas where soils were were lost, southern Appalachian spruce–fir forests were incapable of regenerating.\n\nIf the story ended there, Fraser fir and its habitat would still be in trouble but sadly, things only got worse with the introduction of the invasive balsam woolly adelgid (Adelges piceae) from Europe around 1900. Like the hemlock woolly adlegid, this invasive, sap-feeding insect has decimated Fraser fir populations throughout southern Appalachia. Having shared no evolutionary history with the adelgid, Fraser fir is essentially defenseless and estimates suggest that upwards of 90% of infect trees have been killed by the invasion. Although plenty of Fraser fir seedlings have sprung up in the wake of this destruction, experts fear that as soon as those trees grow large enough to start forming fissures in their bark, the balsam woolly adelgid will once again experience a massive population boom and repeat the process of destruction again.\n\nThe loss of Fraser fir from this imperiled ecosystem has had a ripple effect. Fraser fir is much sturdier than its red spruce neighbors and thus provides an important windbreak, protecting other trees from the powerful gusts that sweep over the mountain tops on a regular basis. With a decline in the Fraser fir canopy, red spruce and other trees are more susceptible to blowdowns. Also, the dense, evergreen canopy of these Appalachian spruce-fir forests produces a unique microclimate that fosters the growth of myriad mosses, liverworts, ferns, and herbs that in turn support species like the endangered endemic spruce-fir moss spider (Microhexura montivaga). As Fraser fir is lost from these areas, the species that it once supported decline as well, placing the whole ecosystem at risk of collapse.\n\nLuckily, the plight of this tree and the habitat it supports has not gone unnoticed by conservationists. Numerous groups and agencies are working on conserving and restoring Fraser fir and southern Appalachian spruce-fir forests to at least a portion of their former glory. This is not an easy task by any means. Aside from lack of funding and human power, southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest conservation and restoration is hindered by the ever present threat of a changing climate. Fears that the life-giving fog that supports this ecosystem may be changing make it difficult to prioritize areas suitable for reforestation. Also, the continued threat from invasive species like the balsam woolly adelgid can hamper even the best restoration and conservation efforts. Still, this doesn’t mean we must give up hope. With continued collaboration and effort, we can still ensure that this unique ecosystem has a chance to persist.\n\nPlease visit the Central Appalachian Spruce Restoration Initiative (CASRI) website to learn more!\n\nPhoto Credits: [1][2][4][5]\n\nFurther Reading: [1][2][3][4]\n\nPlants and herbivores are engaged in an evolutionary arms race hundreds of millions of years in the making. As plants evolve mechanisms to avoid being eaten, herbivores evolve means of overcoming those defenses. Our understanding of these dynamics is vast but largely focused on the actual act of an organism consuming plant tissues. However, there is growing evidence that plants can take action against herbivores before they are even born.\n\nTaking out herbivores before they even have a chance to munch on a plant seems like a pretty effective means of defense. Indeed, for a growing number of plant species, this starts with the ability to detect insect eggs deposited on or in leaves and stems. As Griese and colleagues put it in their 2020 paper, “Every insect egg being detected and killed, is one less herbivorous larva or adult insect feeding on the plant in the near future.” Amazingly, such early detection and destruction has been found in a variety of plant lineages from conifers to monocots and eudicots.\n\nThere are a few different ways plants go about destroying the eggs of herbivores. For instance, upon detecting eggs on their leaves, some mustards will begin to produce volatile compounds that attract parasitoid wasps that lay their eggs on or in the herbivore’s eggs. For other plants, killing herbivore eggs involves the production of special egg-killing compounds. Research on cherry trees (Prunus spp.) has shown that as cicadas push their ovipositor into a twig, the damage induces the production of a sticky gum that floods the egg chamber and prevents the eggs from hatching. Similarly, resin ducts full of insect-killing compounds within the rinds of mangoes will rupture when female flies insert their ovipositor, killing any eggs that are deposited within.\n\nOne of the coolest and, dare I say, most badass ways of taking out herbivore eggs can be seen in a variety of plants including mustards, beans, potatoes, and even relatives of the milkweeds and involves a bit of sacrifice on the plant end of things. Upon detecting moth or butterfly eggs, leaf cells situated directly beneath the eggs initiate a defense mechanism called the “hypersensitive response.” Though normally induced by pathogenic microbes, the hypersensitive response appears to work quite well at killing off any eggs that are laid.\n\nOnce eggs are detected, a signalling pathway within the leaf ramps up the production of highly reactive molecules called reactive oxygen species. These compounds effectively kill all of the cells upon which the butterfly eggs sit. The death of those plant cells is thought to change the microclimate directly around the eggs, causing them to either dry up or fall off. These forms of plant defense don’t stop once the eggs have been killed either. There is evidence to suggest that the hypersensitive response to insect eggs also induces these plants to begin producing even more anti-feeding compounds, thus protecting the plants from any herbivores that result from any eggs that weren’t killed.\n\nPlants may be sessile but they are certainly not helpless. Defense mechanisms like these just go to show you how good plants can be at protecting themselves. Certainly, the closer we look at interactions like these, the more we will discover about the amazing world of plant defenses.\n\nPhoto Credits: [1][2][3]\n\nFurther Reading: [1][2]\n\nIn honor of my conversation with Anacardiaceae specialist, Dr. Susan Pell, I wanted to dedicate some time to looking at a member of this family that is in desperate need of more attention. I would like you to meet the dwarf sumac (Rhus michauxii). Found only in a few scattered locations throughout the Coastal Plain and Piedmont regions of southeastern North America, this small tree is growing increasingly rare.\n\nDwarf sumac is a small species, with most individuals maxing out around 1 - 3 feet (30.5 – 91 cm) in height. It produces compound fuzzy leaves with wonderfully serrated leaflets. It flowers throughout early and mid-summer, with individuals producing an upright inflorescence that is characteristic of what one might expect from the genus Rhus. Dwarf sumac is dioecious, meaning individual plants produce either male or female flowers. Also, like many of its cousins, dwarf sumac is highly clonal, sending out runners in all directions that grow into clones of the original. The end result of this habit is large populations comprised of a single genetic individual producing only one type of flower.\n\nResearch indicates that the pygmy sumac was likely never wide spread or common throughout its range. Its dependence on specific soil conditions (namely sandy or rocky, basic soils) and just the right amount of disturbance mean it is pretty picky as to where it can thrive. However, humans have pushed this species far beyond natural tolerances. A combination of agriculture, development, and fire sequestration have all but eliminated most of its historical occurrences.\n\nToday, the remaining dwarf sumac populations are few and far between. Its habit of clonal spread complicates matters even more because remaining populations are largely comprised of clonal offshoots of single individuals that are either male or female, making sexual reproduction almost non-existent in most cases. Also, aside from outright destruction, a lack of fire has also been disastrous for the species. Dwarf sumac requires fairly open habitat to thrive and without regular fires, it is readily out-competed by surrounding vegetation.\n\nLuckily, dwarf sumac has gotten enough attention to earn it protected status as a federally listed endangered species. However, this doesn’t mean all is well in dwarf sumac land. Lack of funding and overall interest in this species means monitoring of existing populations is infrequent and often done on a volunteer basis. At least one study pointed out that some of the few remaining populations have only been monitored once, which means it is anyone’s guess as to their current status or whether they still exist at all. Some studies also indicate that dwarf sumac is capable of hybridizing with related species such as whinged sumac (Rhus copallinum).\n\nAnother complicating factor is that some populations occur in some surprisingly rundown places that can make conservation difficult. Because dwarf sumac relies on disturbance to keep competing vegetation at bay, some populations now exist along highway rights-of way, roadsides, and along the edges of artificially maintained clearings. While this is good news for current population numbers, ensuring that these populations are looked after and maintained is a difficult task when interests outside of conservation are involved.\n\nSome of the best work being done to protect this species involves propagation and restoration. Though still limited in its scope and success, out-planting into new location in addition to augmenting existing populations offers hope of at least slowing dwarf sumac decline in the wild. Special attention has been given to planting genetically distinct male and female plants into existing clonal populations in hopes of increasing pollination and seed set. Though it is too early to count these few attempts as true successes, they do offer a glimmer of hope. Other conservation attempts involve protecting what little habitat remains for this species and encouraging better land management via prescribed burns and invasive species removal.\n\nThe future for dwarf sumac remains uncertain, but that doesn’t mean all hope is lost. With more attention and research, this species just may be saved from total destruction. The plight of species like the dwarf sumac serve as an important reminder of why both habitat conservation and restoration are so important for slowing biodiversity loss.\n\nPhoto Credits: [1][2][3]\n\nFurther Reading: [1][2][3]James Henderson, Golden Delight Honey, Bugwood.org."
