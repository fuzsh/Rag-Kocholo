        "text": "Bernhard Eunom Philippi (1811-1852) (Fig. 1) was born in Berlin and as a young boy, moved with his family to Switzerland in 1818. Together with his brother Rudolph, he attended the school of Heinrich Pestalozzi in Yverdon, where he studied natural sciences and languages. However, more inclined toward the exact sciences, he completed his studies at the School of Engineering in Berlin between 1822 and 1830. After learning the arts of navigation and seamanship in the harbor of Danzig, Philippi took part in two expeditions to Chile and Peru, between 1831 and 1837. In 1840, he was appointed as a traveling naturalist by the Zoological Museum in Berlin and established himself in the village of Ancud, on the Chilean island of ChiloÃ©. In Ancud, he made the acquaintance of Captain John Williams, who in 1843, encouraged him to take part in the Chilean expedition that would take possession of the Strait of Magellan. The schooner Ancud was built especially for this expedition. After securing the Strait of Magellan for Chile (just one day before the arrival of the French warship Le PhaÃ¨ton, which sailed with similar intentions), Philippi played an important role in designing the fortifications that were built on the site of the future city of Punta Arenas (founded in 1848) (Fig. 2).\n\nIn 1848, Bernhard Philippi traveled to Germany with orders of the Chilean President Bulnes to recruit German settlers, a mission he completed successfully. Soon, the first German colonies began to flourish in Valdivia. In 1852, he was called back by the Chilean authorities and was appointed Governor of the province of Magallanes. Only a few months later, he disappeared during an excursion, presumably killed in an attack by the natives.\n\nDuring his 1838 journey to Chile, Philippi had made the acquaintance of a collector of specimens of natural history, the German by the name of Carlos Segeth (1811-1890), who interested Philippi in forming a society to sell botanical and zoological collections in Europe. The society was short-lived, but a few botanical specimens were received by Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach (1823-1889), Germanyâs famous orchidologist of the 19th century, who, amongst Bernhard Philippiâs collections, described four new orchid species: Chloraea philippii Rchb.f. (Fig. 3), C. heteroglossa Rchb.f. (Fig. 4), C. unguis-cati Rchb.f., and Epidendrum philippii Rchb.f. There is no possible confusion as to which of the brothers collected these orchids because they were described in 1849-1850, while Rudolph Philippi did not arrive in Chile until 1851. Furthermore, E. philippii is a native of Peru, where Rudolph Philippi, never collected.\n\nRudolph Amandus and Federico Philippi\n\nâThe second half of the nineteenth century was dominated by the work of Rudolf Amandus Philippi (1808-1904) (Fig. 5), in Chile from 1851 to 1897; he was effectively responsible, along with his son and successor Federico, for the establishment of the present national herbarium in Santiagoâ (Frodin 2001).\n\nIn 1858, Rudolph Philippi wrote to Guillermo Frick (1818-1905), a German friend in Valdivia, to recount a humorous comment that someone else had made about Philippiâs dedication to natural history: âWhat is it that Philippi does? He hunts flies, and then he observes them through a large lens and captures them in a drawing. Itâs surprising the way in which some men can earn their breadâ (Translated from German into English by Schell 2013).\n\nRudolph Amandus Philippi (1808-1904) was born just outside Berlin and studied, together with his brother Bernhard, natural history at Pestalozziâs institution in Switzerland. Until his last days, he spoke with great enthusiasm of his years in Yverdon. Later, he obtained a medical degree in Berlin, but never practiced, completely dedicating himself to the natural sciences (FÃ¼rstenberg 1905). As a young man, Rudolph traveled widely in Europe, mostly in Italy, where Federico (1836-1910), his first son, was born on the last day of his fatherâs stay in Naples. After returning to Germany, Rudolph obtained a position as a professor at the Polytechnic School of Kassel, where he would spend 16 years. During this time, Philippi published numerous articles on the paleontology and geology of southern Italy and became widely known in Germanyâs scientific community. Political upheaval forced him to leave Kassel precipitously. His long conversations with Bernhard, who at that time was in Germany, the attraction of his brotherâs description of the Chilean wildlife, the political unrest in the Duchy of Hesse and his liberal convictions were the determining factors in Rudolph Amandus Philippiâs decision to emigrate to Chile (Chaparral 2010).\n\nAfter arriving in Valparaiso in late 1851, Rudolph went for a few weeks to Santiago (Fig. 6), where he was introduced to the President of the Republic and then, sailed south to the recently founded German colony of Valdivia. He made his first exploring expeditions inland and shortly after that, together with his brother, acquired the Fundo (âEstateâ), San Juan, on Rio Bueno (Fig. 7).\n\nCarl Christian Ochsenius (1830-1906) (Fig. 8), a German geology student of Philippi at the Polytechnic School in Kassel, accepted Philippiâs invitation and joined him in his decision to emigrate to Chile. Ochsenius spent the following twenty years in Chile and became Rudolf Philippiâs lifelong friend. He accompanied Philippi on many of his excursions and took over the administration of the âFundoâ San Juan from 1853 to 1856 after Philippi moved to Santiago following his appointment as university professor. In 1884, he published a book about his experiences in Chile, Chile Land und Leute (âChile, the land and its peopleâ), with a few illustrations by himself (Fig. 9). In 1906, shortly before his death, Ochsenius published what is probably known as the best biography of Rudolph Philippi (Ochsenius 1906). He made important contributions to Chileâs copper and saltpeter industries during his time in Chile. In 1871, Ochsenius left Chile and returned to his native Marburg, where he spent the rest of his life as professor at the local university.\n\nAfter his brotherâs death, Rudolph Philippi became the sole proprietor of the San Juan estate. However, he maintained his scientific activities and, besides numerous excursions in the province of Valdivia, had the opportunity to climb the Osorno volcano. Philippiâs reports to the university in Santiago awoke the interest of the government and he was named as first director of the high school in Valdivia, and then, in 1853, professor of natural sciences at the University of Chile and director of the Natural History Museum. The Museum had been housed in the (new) building of the University since 1863. In 1876, it was moved into a new building on the lands of the School of Agriculture (Fig. 10-11).\n\nRudolph Philippi served as professor of natural sciences until 1874, as director of the Botanical Garden until 1883, and continued as director of the Natural History Museum, until 1897. His successor at the Garden and the Museum was his son Federico, who was active until his death, in 1910.\n\nMany of Philippiâs herbarium specimens were distributed in Europe through Rudolf Friedrich Hohenacker (1798-1874), a member of the âUnio Itinerariaâ (in German âBotanischer Reisevereinâ), a joint-stock company founded in 1827 exclusively responsible for sending botanists on travels to collect herbarium specimens. Thus, many of Philippiâs specimens presently found at the Natural History Museum in Paris were labeled as R. A. Philippi pl. chilens. Ed. R. F. Hohenacker (Fig. 12).\n\nDuring his 44 years of service, Philippi maintained his collecting activities in the field, and as an untiring publisher of scientific articles in all fields of the natural sciences he wrote over 300 articles about zoology, botany, geology, paleontology, mineralogy, geography, and ethnography. âAmong his scientific endeavors, he contributed taxonomic descriptions to the biological diversity of Chile, encompassing organisms in three living kingdoms: plants, animals and fungi. We have examined his contribution to the knowledge of the biological wealth of Chile, quantifying the number and proportion of current valid species he described. Our findings indicate that Philippi described 1670 valid species, equivalent to 5.8% of the recognized biological diversity of Chile. His greatest contributions were in vascular plants with 1017 species descriptions, which represent 19% of the vascular flora of Chile.â (Castro et al. 2006). As to his botanical excursions, those to the desert of Atacama and the islands of Juan FernÃ¡ndez stand out. During his scientific excursions, Rudolph Philippi prepared several highly interesting pencil drawings depicting the Chilean scenery and the life of its inhabitants (Fig. 13-14), later published by his grandson, Federicoâs son, Julio Philippi Izquierdo (1912-1997), as Vistas de Chile (âViews from Chileâ) (Philippi Izquierdo 1973). âHowever, some of those drawings were not Philippiâs originals, but were copied from drawings made by Alexander Simon (1805-1852), a German artist who spent the last few years of his life in Chile with Bernhard Philippi before dying in unknown circumstances in Patagoniaâ (Kabat & Coan 2017).\n\nPhilippi's contribution to Chileâs national science can be summarized as follows: âhis collecting expeditions in most of its territory; his theoretical contribution to the realm of superior education as a professor at the National Institute and later at the University of Chile; his work as director of the Natural History Museum and the Botanical Garden in Santiago; and his large collections of objects in all aspects of the countryâs natural history, which complemented those initiated by Claude Gay in 1830â (Saldivia 2015). Rudolph Philippiâs last recorded collecting excursion took him in March 1896 to the city of ConstituciÃ³n, province of Maule, in Central Chile. At the time he was already 88 years of age.\n\nFriedrich (Federico) Heinrich Eunom Philippi (1836-1910) (Fig. 15-16) began his studies of natural history in Kassel, during his fatherâs direction of the natural history department of the local university. After Rudolph Philippiâs appointment as director of the Natural History Museum and the Botanical Garden in Santiago, Federico and the rest of the family followed him to Chile, where they arrived in late 1853. They brought with them Rudolphâs private library, an invaluable treasure for Chile's scientific world.\n\nFederico, a 17-year-old boy by then, worked at the family estate in Valdivia where he began collecting plants for his herbarium. From 1860 he accompanied his father on his botanical excursions. He was responsible for most of the collections, but it was his father who described most of the new species.\n\nFederico Philippi returned to Germany and studied botany and zoology, from 1871 to 1874, at the University of Halle. After returning to Chile, he became the successor of his father as a professor of botany in Santiago and later as director of the Natural History Museum and the Botanical Garden. Until 1897, he also taught zoology at the Institute for Agriculture, and botany at the Faculty of Medicine, until 1906.\n\nThe earthquake of August 1906 inflicted serious damage on the building of the Museum, and Federico, putting his life at risk, worked for days rescuing what was left of the collections, now buried under the rubble. Nevertheless, the Museum was his passion, and his work there was interrupted only by his death, in 1910.\n\nThe most important legacy of Federico Philippi was the continuation of Claude Gayâs and his fatherâs work, increasing and organizing the botanical and zoological collections of the Museum, which, at the turn of the century, made him the main scientific authority in Chile.\n\nWhen Federico took over from his father as director of the Natural History Museum in 1897, he was already 61 years old. The longevity of Rudolph Philippi and his imposing authority as Chileâs most important scientist in the second half of the 19th century made it inevitable that Federico lived for most of his life under the shadow of his father. In a photograph of father and son, taken in 1902, it is somewhat difficult to distinguish one from the other (Fig. 16).\n\nAn important contribution of Federico Philippi was the publication, in 1881, of his Catalogus plantarum vascularium Chilensium. In this treatise, he enumerated a total of 86 (!) orchid species, a list that is undoubtedly full of synonyms since the total in F. Philippiâs Catalogus exceeds by far the present number of accepted Chilean species of orchids. Federico described a total of 33 new species in different plant families, a relatively small number when compared to that of his father."
