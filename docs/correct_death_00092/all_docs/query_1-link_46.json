Species epithet equestris is the family name of Venus, Roman goddess of beauty. \nThe Latin word leucaspis for this form of Phalaenopsis references white periphery of the pink petals. Frankfurt-born German botanist Johannes Conrad Schauer (1813-1848) who earned his PhD at University of Erlangen-Nuremberg -- is credited with describing and naming Phalaenopsis equestris in the study Repertorium Botanices Systematicae published in 1843 in Germany. (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Conrad_Schauer). The German botanist and preeminent 19th century orchidologist Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach (1823-1889) would reaffirm Schauer's findings during his remarkable career as a professor of botany at Leipzig University in Germany and as director of the botanical gardens at Hamburg University from 1863 to 1889. (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Gustav_Reichenbach). Phalaenopsis Orchid is native to the Philippines particularly in Mindanao and Tawi Tawi in the southwestern Philippines. Genus name Phalaenopsis combines the Greek words \"phalaina\" (\"moth\") and \"opsis\" (\"like\"). Phalaenopsis, thus, means \"Moth-like.\" (merriam-webster.com/dictionary/phalaenopsis). Born in Germany and educated at Leiden University in The Netherlands, German-Dutch botanist Carl Ludwig Blume (1796-1862) is credited with providing a description of Phalaenopsis Orchid in Flora of the Dutch East Indies. (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Ludwig_Blume). Orchid comes from Greek \"orchis\" (\"testicle\") referencing shape of root tubers of species of genus Orchis. (www.brittanica.com/plant/orchid). Photo credit with my heartfelt gratitude to my excellent long-time friend Mrs. Hiroko Uchida Morikawa @uchidamorikawa for this picture of Phalaenopsis equestris var. leucaspis in a well-tended private garden in Metro Manila. A Japanese citizen, Mrs. Morikawa is an outstanding alumna of the Graduate School of Area Studies (Chiki Kenkyukaa) of the University of Tsukuba in Tsukuba City, Japan. Mrs. Morikawa took this picture on December 4, 2023. Date of this posting: December 8, 2023, Quezon City, Philippines\".",
