Such is the case of Frank Merkes, an employee at the sulfite mill who died in St. Vincent's hospital at 4:00 Tuesday afternoon. He was one of the men at the mill who was universally like by the boys who work there. He was industrious and honest, never shirked his duty, and was always willing to help a fellow worker. He was in line for a good promotion had he kept his health.\n\nSo well was he thought of by the men, that sometime ago without Mr. Merkes knowing it, they took up a subscription among themselves and sent him away to the hospital where it was hoped he could recover from his bronchial trouble. At first he seemed to improve, but a relapse brought on his death.\n\nHe was born in Clintonville January 30, 1880. He came here from Tigerton eight years ago. He was married to Miss Zueske and to the couple six children are born Floyd 11, Vernon 8, Lester 6, Leighton 5, Loraine 3 and Arno 18 months.

The correspondent was an eyewitness when the body was taken from the water. It appears that lately misfortune has been with Mr. Angermann. He lost a 14 year old son in death last winter. His oldest son, age 18 is severely ill at the present and it is doubtful that he will survive. Now his youngest was found dead in the water at the age of seven years.

August (4 year old son, daughter age 2, baby 4 months) (Records at Family History Center - Elizabeth, born 1911. Edward born 1910 and Carl born 1913)\n\nLast Thursday three small children of Mr. and Mrs. August Neubauer were burned to death. Two were burned in the building and the third died after it was taken to the Doctor.\n\nThe cause of the fire is not known. A spark from tree stumps and accumulated brush burning near by may have set the house on fire.\n\nThe three children were alone while Mr. and Mrs. Neubauer were wall papering in their new house. The house in which they were living at the time was a small building with tar paper. This building was on the farm located near the Germania Town Hall, which Mr. Neubauer had recently purchased.\n\nIt was around one o'clock when they discovered the building in flames. Mr. Neubauer raced to the building to rescue the children. However, he could only find the little girl and after he had earned her out, he threw sand on her to extinguish the fire from her clothes. Mrs. Neubauer was lightly burned on her neck and arms as she searched the burning building. Mr. Neubauers hand was burned. When all hope of rescuing the other children seemed hopeless, the father hurried to the neighbors for help. The first two had no horses. He then hurried to Herman Spieth who hitched up his team and took the mother and child to town. He almost killed his horses in his rush to save the child's life.\n\nHowever there was no Doctor in the area. Dr Hunt was in Marion and Dr Gates was called to assist someone in Hunting. After some time Dr Mulvaney from Marion was reached by phone. He took his car and shortly after Dr Gates came. They did all they could for the child but she died at 5 o'clock. The bodies of the other two children were found that same evening and were completely burned in the ruins of the house.\n\nMr. Neubauer' s condition is serious and is under Doctor's care. His greatest suffering is the mental anguish, for his burns could heal. The boy was four years old, the girl was two and the youngest was four months old. The funeral has held Saturday at the Lutheran Church.\n\nV.W.\n\nThurs 19 June 1913,\n\nPage 69\n\nHAUT, Leonard died last Sunday, 15 June.
