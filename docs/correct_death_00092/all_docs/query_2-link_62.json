In\n\ngest (literature)\n\ngest, a story of achievements or adventures. Among several famous medieval collections of gests are Fulcher of Chartres’s Gesta Francorum, Saxo Grammaticus’s Gesta Danorum, and the compilation known as the Gesta Romanorum. The term was also used to refer to a romance in verse. The word is\n\nGesta annalia (work by John of Fordun)\n\nJohn Of Fordun: …of book 5 is his Gesta annalia (Scotland, 1153–1363). These were all completed by 1363; thereafter John travelled until 1383, wrote books 1–3 (legendary) and book 4 (814–1057), and brought the Gesta annalia down to 1384. Walter Bower’s Scotichronicon, completed 1447, is in part an expansion and continuation of John’s…\n\nGesta Collationis Carthaginensis (work by Augustine)\n\nSt. Augustine: Controversial writings: …most effectively, but the stenographic Gesta Collationis Carthaginensis (411; “Acts of the Council of Carthage”) offers a vivid view of the politics and bad feelings of the schism.\n\nGesta Danorum (work by Saxo Grammaticus)\n\nHamlet: …story is narrated in the Gesta Danorum, Saxo Grammaticus’s late 12th-century history of Denmark. But the character’s famous hesitation—his reluctance or unreadiness to avenge his father’s murder—is central and peculiar to Shakespeare’s conception of Hamlet. This hesitation has fascinated critics, but none of the explanations offered, such as unconscious Oedipal…\n\nGesta Dei per Francos (work by Bongars)\n\nJacques Bongars, seigneur de Bauldry et de La Chesnaye: …by the far more important Gesta Dei per Francos (“God’s Work Through the Franks”), a collection of contemporary accounts of the Crusades. An edition of his letters, in Latin, appeared in 1647, a French translation in 1668–70. His diary of his journey to Constantinople was printed in 1874.\n\nGesta Francorum Jherusalem peregrinantium (work by Fulcher of Chartres)\n\nFulcher Of Chartres: His Gesta Francorum Jherusalem peregrinantium (written in three installments, 1101, 1106, and 1124–27) is a vivid and reliable account of the First Crusade, Baldwin’s journey to Jerusalem, and the kingdom of Jerusalem to 1127.\n\nGesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum (work by Adam of Bremen)\n\nGermanic religion and mythology: Early medieval records: …Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum (History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen), which included a description of the lands in the north, then part of the ecclesiastical province of Hamburg. Adam’s work is particularly rich in descriptions of the festivals and sacrifices of the Swedes, who were still largely pagan in…\n\nGesta Innocentii III (Roman Catholic literature)\n\nInnocent III: Early pontificate: …registers and in a chronicle, Gesta Innocentii III (“The Deeds of Innocent III”), written about 1208 by an anonymous member of Innocent’s curia who apparently knew the pope very well. In one of his first letters, Innocent ordered King Philip Augustus of France to take back his wife, whom the…\n\nGesta Karoli magni (work by Notker of St. Gall)\n\nCharlemagne legend: A Gesta Karoli magni, written by the monk Notker of St. Gall (in Switzerland) in 884–887, seems to owe as much to popular anecdotes and oral tradition as to Charlemagne’s biographer, Einhard. By the 12th century, lives of Charlemagne were attributing miracles to him before and…\n\nGesta Philippi Augusti (work by Rigord)\n\nRigord: The first section of the Gesta Philippi Augusti (1196; “The Deeds of Philip Augustus”) began with Philip’s coronation in 1179 and showed enthusiastic partiality toward him. An addition to the work, continuing to 1207, marked a shift in Rigord’s attitude to one of rather severe censure, probably a result of…\n\nGesta regum (work by Gervase of Canterbury)\n\nGervase Of Canterbury: A second history, the Gesta regum, traces in less detail the political and military fortunes of Britain from the 1st century bc to 1209 or 1210. The earlier portions of both works are derivative, but Gervase is an independent authority for events from 1188 or 1189.\n\nGesta Romanorum (Latin literature)\n\nGesta Romanorum, Latin collection of anecdotes and tales, probably compiled early in the 14th century. It was one of the most popular books of the time and the source, directly or indirectly, of much later literature, including that of Chaucer, John Gower, Thomas Hoccleve, Shakespeare, and many\n\nGestalt psychology\n\nGestalt psychology, school of psychology founded in the 20th century that provided the foundation for the modern study of perception.
