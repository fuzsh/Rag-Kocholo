        "text": "One thing I love about orchids is that they are so diverse. One could spend their entire life studying these plants and never run out of surprises. Every time I sit down with an orchid topic in mind, I end up going down a rabbit hole of immeasurable depth. I love this because I always end up learning new and interesting facts. For instance, I only recently learned that there is a genus of orchids that has been given the unbelievably complex name of Aa.\n\nNo, that is not an abbreviation. The genus was literally named Aa. As far as I have been able to tell, it is pronounced “ah” rather than “ay,” but if any linguists are reading this and beg to differ, please chime in! Regardless, I was floored by this silly exercise in plant naming and had to learn more. I had never heard of this genus before and figured that it was so obscure that it probably contained, at most, only a small handful of species. This assumption was wrong.\n\nBut what about the name? Why in the world was this genus given such a strange and abrupt moniker? The answer seems to be the silliest option I could think of: to be first. This genus was originally described in 1845 by German botanist Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach who recognized two species within the genus Altensteinia to be distinct enough to warrant their own genus.\n\nAccording to most sources I could find, he coined this new genus Aa so that it would appear first on all taxonomic lists. There is at least one other report that the name was given in honor of a man by the name of Pieter van der Aa, but apparently this is “highly” disputed. However, all of this should be taken with a grain of salt. Though I can find plenty of literature describing various species within the genus, I could turn up no actual literature on the naming of the genus itself. All I could find is what has been repeated (almost verbatim) from Wikipedia.\n\nSo, there you have it. Not only does the genus Aa exist, it is still top of the list of all plant genera. If that truly was the goal Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach was aiming for, he certainly has succeeded!\n\nPhotos via Wikimedia Commons\n\nFurther Reading: [1]\n\nNot just any bumblebee will do. For the ruse to work, it requires freshly emerged workers that are naive to the orchid’s deception. Bumblebees are not mindless animals. They quickly learn which flowers are worth visiting and which are not. Because of this, the Calypso has only short window of time in which bumblebees in the vicinity are likely to fall for its tricks. As a result, pollination rates are often very low for this orchid.\n\nThe most interesting aspect of all of this is that the so-called \"male function\" of the flower - pollinia removal - is more likely to occur than the \"female function\" - pollen deposition. The reason for this makes a lot of sense in context; male function requires a bumblebee to be fooled only once whereas female function requires a bumblebee to be fooled at least twice.\n\nThe caveat to all of this deception is that a single Calypso, like all other orchids, can produce tens of thousands of seeds. Each orchid therefore has tens of thousands of potential propagules to replace itself in the next generation. Despite that fact, the Calypso orchid is on the decline. Habitat destruction, poaching, deer, and invasive species are taking their toll. If you care about orchids like the Calypso, please consider supporting organizations like the North American Orchid Conservation Center.\n\nHistorically, non-photosynthetic plants were defined as saprotrophs. It was thought that, like fungi, such plants lived directly off of decaying materials. Advances in our understanding have since revealed that parasitic plants don’t do any of the decaying themselves. Instead, those that aren’t direct parasites on the stems and roots of other plants utilize a fungal intermediary. We call these plants mycoheterotrophs (fungus-eaters). Despite recognition of this strangely fascinating relationship, we still have much to learn about what kinds of fungi these plants parasitize and where most of the nutritional demands are coming from.\n\nIt is largely assumed that most mycoheterotrophic plants are parasitic on mycorrhizal fungi. This would make them indirect parasites on other photosynthetic plants. The mycorrhizal fungi partner with photosynthetic plants, exchanging soil nutrients for carbon made by the plant during photosynthesis. However, this is largely assumed rather than tested. New research out of Japan has shown a light on what is going on with some of these parasitic relationships and the results are a bit surprising. What’s more, the methods they used to better understand these parasitic relationships are pretty clever to say the least.\n\nBy looking at the ratios of 14C in the tissues of parasitic plants, scientists reasoned that they could assess the age of the carbon being utilized. If more 14C was present, the source of the carbon could not come from today’s atmosphere and therefore not from recent photosynthesis. Instead, it would have to come from older sources like decaying wood of long-dead trees. In other words, if parasitic plants were high in 14C, then the scientists could reasonably conclude that they were parsitizing wood-decaying saprotrophic fungi. If the plants were high in 12C or 13C, then they could conclude that they were partnering with mycorrhizal fungi instead, which were obtaining carbon from present-day photsynthesis.\n\nThe researchers looked at 10 different species of parasitic plants across Japan, most of which were orchids. They analyzed their tissues and ran analyses on the carbon molecules within. What they found is that 6 out of the 10 plants contained much higher levels of 12C and 13C in their tissues, which points to mycorrhizal fungi as their host. However, for the 4 remaining species (Gastrodia elata, Cyrtosia septentrionalis, Yoania japonica and Eulophia zollingeri), the ratios of 14C were considerably higher, meaning their host fungi were eating dead wood, not partnering with photosynthetic plants near by.\n\nOrchids are really good at tricking pollinators. Take, for instance, this strange looking orchid from South Africa. Satyrium pumilum is probably obscure to most of us but it is doing fascinating things to ensure its own reproductive success. This orchid both smells and kind of looks like rotting meat, which is how it attracts its pollinators.\n\nIt is a bit strange to think of orchids living in arid climates like those found in South Africa but this family is defined by exceptions. That is not to say that Satyrium pumilum is a desert plant. To find this orchid, you must look in special microclimates where water sticks around long enough to support its growth. Populations of S. pumilum are most often found clustered near small streams or hidden under bushes throughout the western half of the greater Cape Floristic Region.\n\nSatyrium pumilum blooms from the beginning of September until late October. As is typical in the orchid family, S. pumilum produces rather intricate flowers. Whereas the sepals are decked out in various shades of green, the interior of the flower is blood red in color. Also, unlike many of its cousins, S. pumilum doesn’t throw its flowers up on a tall stalk for all the world to see. Instead, its flowers open up at ground level and give off an unpleasant smell of rotting meat.\n\nThis is where pollinators enter into the picture. It has been found that carrion flies are the preferred pollinator for S. pumilum. By producing flowers at ground level that both look and smell like rotting meat, the plants are primed to attract these flies. The plants are tapping into the flies’ reproductive habits, a biological imperative so strong that they simply do not evolve a means of discriminating a rotting corpse from a flower that smells like one. This is the trick. Flies land on the flower thinking they have found a meal and a place to lay their eggs. They go through the motions as expected and pick up or deposit pollen in the process. Unfortunately for the flies, their offspring are doomed. There is not food to be found in these flowers.\n\nWhat is most remarkable about the reproductive ecology of S. pumilum is that not just any type of fly will do. It appears that only a specific subset of flies actually visit the flowers and act as effective pollinators. Amazingly, this provides insights into some long-running hypotheses regarding carrion fly ecology.\n\nApparently there has been a lot of debate in the fly community over why we see so many different species of carrion flies. Rotting meat is rotting meat, right? Probably not, actually. Fly ecologists have comes up with a few hypotheses involving niche segregation among carrion flies to explain their diversity on the landscape. Some believe that flies separate themselves out in time, with different species hatching out and breeding at different times of the year. Others have suggested that carrion flies separate themselves by specializing on carrion at different stages of decay. Still others have suggested that some flies specialize on large pieces of carrion whereas others prefer smaller pieces.\n\nBy studying the types of flies visiting the flowers of S. pumilum researchers did find evidence of niche segregation based on carrion size. It turns out that S. pumilum is exclusively pollinated by a group of flies known as sarcophagid carrion flies. These flies were regularly observed with orchid pollen sacs stuck to their backs and plants seemed to only set seed after they had been visited by members of this group. So, what is it about these flowers that makes them so specific to this group of flies?\n\nThe answer lies both in their size as well as the amount of scent they produce. It is likely that the quantity of scent compounds produced by S. pumilum most closely mimics that of smaller rotting corpses. The types of flies that visited these blooms were mostly females of species that lay relatively few eggs compared to other carrion flies. It could very well be that the smaller brood size of these flies allows them to effectively utilize smaller bits of carrion than other, more fecund species of fly. To date, this is some of the best evidence in support of the idea that flies avoid competition among different species by segregating out their feeding and reproductive niches.\n\nRotting meat smells are not uncommon in the plant world. Even within the home range of S. pumilum, there are other plants produce flowers that smell like carrion as well. It would be extremely interesting to look at what kinds of flies visit other carrion flowers and in what numbers. Like I mentioned earlier, reproductive is such a major part of any organisms life that it may simply be too costly for carrion flies to evolve a means of discriminating real and fake breeding sites. It is amazing to think of what we gain from trying to understand the reproductive biology of a small, obscure orchid growing tucked away in arid regions of South Africa.\n\nPhoto Credits:[1][2]\n\nFurther Reading: [1]\n\nThe botanical world is synonymous with the idea of photosynthesis. Plants take in carbon dioxide and water and utilize light to make their own food. However, not all plants make a living this way. There are many different species of plants that have evolved a parasitic lifestyle to one degree or another. Some of my favorites are those that parasitize mycorrhizal fungi. We call these plants “mycoheterotrophs” and they are fascinating to say the least. Orchids are especially prone to this strategy, with over 1% of all known species having completely lost the ability to photosynthesize.\n\nOur knowledge of the mycoheterotrophic strategy is fragmentary at best. We still don’t fully understand things like how the plants obtain what they need from the fungus nor how they are able to maintain their parasitic lifestyle without the fungus catching on and rejecting the one-sided partnership. This is not to say we know nothing. In fact, as technologies advance, we are unlocking at least some of the mysteries of mycoheterotrophic plants. Some of the best advances come from studying mutant, albino orchids. To understand how, we have to take a closer look at the “average” orchid lifestyle.\n\nOrchids in general make great candidates for understanding the evolution of mycoheterotrophy because all of them start their lives as parasites. Orchids produce some of the smallest seeds in the plant kingdom and without the help of mycorrhizal fungi, they would never be able to germinate. For much of their early life, orchids rely on fungi to provide them with both their mineral and carbohydrate needs. Only after the orchids are large enough to grow leaves will most of them start to give back to their fungal partners in the form of carbohydrates generated from photosynthesis.\n\nStill, many orchids never fully let go of this parasitic lifestyle. This is especially true for orchids living under dense forest canopies. With light in limited supply, many orchids adopt a mixotrophic lifestyle. Essentially this means that although they actively photosynthesize, they nonetheless rely on fungi to provide them with both carbohydrates and minerals. Mixotrphy is likely the most wide-spread orchid strategy and it has been hypothesized that it is also the first step along the path to becoming fully parasitic. This is where the mutant orchids enter the equation.\n\nEvery once in a while, some orchids will germinate and grow into albino versions of their species. Without the ability to produce chlorophyll, these mutants should be destined for a quick death. Such is not the case for many of these orchids. Albino orchids often go on to live full lives, growing and flowering just like their photosynthetic progenitors. Although they do exhibit signs of reduced fitness, the fact that they are able to live at all brings up a lot of questions ready for science to tackle.\n\nRecent investigations into the lives of these albino mutants has revealed some interesting insights into how mycoheterotrophy may have evolved in the first place. By studying the fungal partners of both healthy plants and the albinos, researchers have been able to demonstrate that albinos are doing things a bit differently than their photosynthetic parents. Using isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, scientists are discovering that the albinos have switched their interaction with the fungi in such a way that they more resemble fully mycoheterotrophic orchid species. This is done despite the fact that both albinos and their fully functional parents associate with the same guild of mycorrhizal fungi.\n\nAnother interesting difference between albinos and their photosynthetic parents is the fact that the genes involved both antioxidant metabolism and metabolite transfer (mainly carbon in this case) were more active in the albinos than they were in functioning plants. The uptick in gene functioning related to antioxidant metabolism suggests that the mutant plants are undergoing greater oxidative stress than their functional parents. This may have something to do with how the albinos are able to obtain nutrients from their fungal partners. It is thought that mycoheterotrophs actively digest parts of the fungi, which allows them to access the carbon and minerals they need to survive. This process exposes their cells to reactive oxygen compounds that can be very damaging. Antioxidants would help to reduce such damage.\n\nThe uptick in genes associated with metabolite transfer was more surprising because it suggests that despite being parasites, the plants are actively transferring substances back to the fungi. It has long been assumed that mycoheterotrophy was a one way street, with fungi transferring nutrients to plants only. These genes now suggest that, at least in some species, such transfer is a two-way street. The exact nature of this two-way transfer remains a mystery and certainly brings up many more questions that must be asked before we can better understand this relationship.\n\nAll of this is not to say that such albino mutants are fruitful “next steps” in the evolution of these species. Far from it, in fact. Two things that most albino orchid variants have in common is the fact that they are rare and, of those that have been studied, produce far fewer seeds. There are a lot of anatomical and physiological differences between true mycoheterotrophic species and albino variants and it appears that without those anatomical adaptations, the albinos are a lot less fit than their photosynthetic parents. As authors Selosse and Roy put it:\n\n“non-chlorophyllous variants are likely to represent unique snapshots of failed transitions from mixotrophy to mycoheterotrophy. They are ecological equivalents to mutants in genetics, that is, their dysfunctions might suggest what makes mycoheterotrophy successful. Although their determinism remains unknown, they offer fascinating models for comparing the physiology of mixo- and mycoheterotrophs within similar genetic backgrounds.”\n\nMutants are strange indeed but with the right kinds of questions and approaches, they have a lot to teach us about ecology, evolution, and life at large.\n\nPhoto Credits:[1][2]\n\nFurther Reading: [1][2][3]\n\nIn the northern temperate regions of North America, late June marks the beginning of what I like to call orchid season. If you're lucky you may stumble across one of these rare beauties in full bloom. Their diversity in shape and size are mainly a result of the intricate evolutionary relationships they have formed with their pollinators. I spend much of my time botanizing trying to locate and photograph these botanical curiosities and any time I get to meet a new species is a very special time indeed.\n\nTake the round leaved orchid (Platanthera orbiculata) for example. For years I have only known this species as two round leaves that are slightly reminiscent of the phaleanopsis orchids you see for sale in nurseries and grocery stores. The leaves can be quite large too. With their glossy appearance, they are the easiest way to locate this plant.\n\nWhen conditions are right and the plants have enough stored energy they will begin to flower. Rising from the middle of the pair of leaves is a decent sized inflorescence loaded with greenish white flowers. The flowers are interesting structures. Not particularly colorful, they have a long white lip and considerable green nectar spurs. There are said to be two varieties of this species, each being characterized by the length of the nectar spur. Unlike many orchids that offer no reward to pollinators, P. orbiculata produces nectar. The flowers are pollinated by noctuid moths, which is probably why they are white in color. Whereas most lepidopteran pollinated orchid attach their pollinia to the proboscis of the butterfly or moth, P. orbiculata attaches its pollinia to the eyes of visiting moths.\n\nIf this isn't strange enough, the pollinia themselves have some of their own intriguing adaptations. Visiting moths take a certain amount of time to successfully access the nectar from the nectar spur. If the plant is to avoid wasting precious pollen on itself, then it must find a way to delay this process. The pollinia are the solution to this. When first attached to the eyes, the pollinia stick straight up. This keeps them away from the female parts of the plant as the moth feeds. Only after enough time has elapsed will the stalks of the pollinia begin to bend forward. At this point the moth will hopefully have moved on to the flowers of an unrelated individual. Pointing straight forward, they are now perfectly positioned to transfer pollen.\n\nLike all orchids, P. orbiculata relies on specialized mycorrhizal fungi for germination and survival. At the beginning of its life, P. orbiculata relies solely on the fungi for sustenance. Once it has enough energy to produce leaves it will repay the fungi by providing carbohydrates. However, the relationship is not over at this point. Every spring, P. orbiculata produces a new set of leaves as well as a whole new root system. The fungi supply a lot of energy for this process and if the plant is disturbed (ie. dug up by greedy poachers) or browsed upon, it is likely that it will not recover from the stress and it will die. The mycorrhizal fungi it relies on live on rotting wood so finding well rotted logs is a good place to start searching for this species. With declining populations throughout much of its range, it is important to remember to enjoy it where it grows. Leave wild orchids in the wild!\n\nFurther Reading: [1][2][3][4]\n\nIn the Atlantic forests of Brazil resides a small orchid known scientifically as Dichaea cogniauxiana. Like most plant species, this orchid experiences plenty of pressure from herbivores. It faces rather intense pressures from two species of weevil in the genus Montella. These weevils are new to science and have yet been given full species status. What's more, they don't appear to eat the leaves of D. cogniauxiana. Instead, female weevils lay eggs in the developing fruits and the larvae hatch out and consume the seeds within. In other words, they treat the fruits like a nursery chamber.\n\nThis is where this relationship gets interesting. You see, the weevils themselves appear to take matters into their own hands. Instead of waiting to find already pollinated orchids, an event that can be exceedingly rare in these dense forests, these weevils go about pollinating the orchids themselves. Females have been observed picking up orchid pollinia and depositing the pollen onto the stigmas. In this way, they ensure that there will be developing fruits in which they can raise their young.\n\nLeft unchecked, the weevil larvae readily consume all of the developing seeds within the pod, an unfortunate blow to the reproductive efforts of this tiny orchid. However, the situation changes when parasitoid wasps enter the mix. The wasps are also looking for a place to rear their young but the wasp larvae do not eat orchid seeds. Instead, the wasps must find juicy weevil larvae in which to lay their eggs. When the wasp larvae hatch out, they eat the weevil larvae from the inside out and this is where things get really interesting.\n\nThe wasp larvae develop at a much faster rate than do the weevil larvae. As such, they kill the weevil long before it has a chance to eat all of the orchid seeds. By doing so, the wasp has effectively rescued the orchids reproductive effort. Over a five year period, researchers based out of the University of Campinas found that orchid fruits in which wasp larvae have killed off the weevil larvae produced nearly as many seeds as uninfected fruits. As such, the parasitoid wasps have made effective pollinators out of otherwise destructive herbivorous weevils.\n\nThe fact that a third party (in this case a parasitic wasp) can change a herbivore into an effective pollinator is quite remarkable to say the least. It reminds us just how little we know about the intricate ways in which species interact and form communities. The authors note that even though pollination in this case represents selfing and thus reduced genetic diversity, it nonetheless increases the reproductive success of an orchid that naturally experiences low pollination rates to begin with. In the hyper diverse and competitive world of Brazilian rainforests, even self-pollination cab be a boost for this orchid.\n\nPhoto Credits: [1][2]\n\nFurther Reading: [1]\n\nImagine a giant vine with no leaves and no chlorophyll scrambling over decaying wood and branches of a warm tropical forest. As remarkable as that may seem, that is exactly what Erythrorchis altissima is. With stems that can grow to upwards of 10 meters in length, this bizarre orchid from tropical Asia is the largest mycoheterotrophic plant known to science.\n\nMycoheterotrophs are plants that obtain all of their energy needs by parasitizing fungi. As you can probably imagine, this is an extremely indirect way for a plant to make a living. In most instances, this means the parasitic plants are stealing nutrients from the fungi that were obtained via a partnership with photosynthetic plants in the area. In other words, mycoheterotrophic plants are indirectly stealing from photosynthetic plants.\n\nIn the case of E. altissima, this begs the question of where does all of the carbon needed to build a surprising amount of plant come from? Is it parasitizing the mycorrhizal network associated with its photosynthetic neighbors or is it up to something else? These are exactly the sorts of questions a team from Saga University in Japan wanted to answer.\n\nTo ensure that these wood decay fungi weren't simply partnering with adult plants, the team decided to test whether or not the wood decay fungi were able to induce germination of E. altissima seeds. In vitro germination trials revealed that not only do these fungi induce seed germination in this orchid, they also fuel the early growth stages of the plant. Further tests also revealed that all of the carbon and nitrogen needs of E. altissima are met by these wood decay fungi.\n\nThese results are amazing. It shows that the largest mycoheterotrophic plant we know of lives entirely off of a generalized group of fungi responsible for the breakdown of wood. By parasitizing these fungi, the orchid has gained access to one of the largest pools of carbon (and other nutrients) without having to give anything back in return. It is no wonder then that this orchid is able to reach such epic proportions without having to do any photosynthesizing of its own. What an incredible world we live in!\n\nHybridization is an often overlooked mechanism for evolution. We are taught in high school that hybrids such as mules and ligers are one-off's, evolutionary dead ends doomed to a life of sterility. Certainly this holds true in many instances. Species separated by great lengths of time and space are simply incompatible. However, there are instances throughout the various kingdoms of life in which hybrids do turn out viable.\n\nIf they are different enough from either parent, their creation may lead to speciation down the line. Such events have been found in ferns, butterflies, and even birds. One particular example of a hybrid species only recently came to my attention. While touring theAtlanta Botanical Garden I came across a fenced off bed of plants. Inside the fence were orchids standing about knee height. At the top of each plant was a brilliant spike of orange flowers. \"Ah,\" I exclaimed, \"the orange fringed orchid!\" The reply I got was unexpected - \"Sort of.\"\n\nWhat I had stumbled across was neither the orange fringed orchid (Platanthera ciliaris) nor the crested yellow orchid (Platanthera cristata). What I was looking at were a small handful of the globally imperiled Chapman's fringed orchid (Platanthera chapmanii). Though there is some debate about the origins of this species, many believe it to be a naturally occurring hybrid of the other two. In many ways it is a perfect intermediate. Despite its possible hybrid origins, it nonetheless produces viable seed. What's more, it readily hybridizes with both parental species as well as a handful of other Platanthera with which it sometimes shares habitat.\n\nDespite occasionally being found along wet roadside ditches, this species is rapidly losing ground. The wet meadows and pine savannas it prefers are all too quickly being leveled for housing and other forms of development. Although it once ranged from southeast Texas to northern Florida, and southeast Georgia, it has since been reduced to less than 1000 individuals scattered among these three states.\n\nThere is a light at the end of the tunnel though. Many efforts are being put forth to protect and conserve this lovely orchid. Greenhouse propagation in places like the Atlanta Botanical Garden are helping supplement wild populations while at the same time, maintaining genetic diversity. New populations have been located in Georgia and are now under protection. Though not out of the woods yet, this species serves as a reminder that a little bit of effort can go a long way.\n\nFurther Reading: [1][2][3][4]\n\nOne of the biggest challenges these plants face starts before they even germinate. This is especially true for orchids. Orchid seeds are more like spores than they are seeds. They are so small that thousands could fit inside of a thimble. Upon ripening, the dust-like seeds waft away on the slightest breeze. In order for epiphytic species to germinate and grow, their seeds must somehow anchor themselves in place on a trunk or branch. Inevitably most seeds are doomed to fail. They simply will not land in a suitable location. It stands to reason then that any adaptation that increases their chances of finding the right kind of habitat will be favored. That's where the strange coils on the tip of Chiloschista seeds, a genus of leafless orchids native to southeast Asia, New Guinea, and Australia, come in. For these orchids, this process is aided by some truly unique seed morphology.\n\nUnlike most orchid seeds that are nothing more than a thin sheath surrounding a tiny embryo, the seeds of Chiloschista have additional parts. These \"appendages,\" which are specialized seed coat cells, are tightly wound into coils. Upon contact with water, these coils shoot out like tiny grappling hooks that grab on to moss and bark alike. In doing so, they anchor the seed in place. By securing their hold on the trunk or branch of a tree, the seeds are much more likely to germinate and grow. This is one of the most extreme examples of seed specialization in the orchid family.\n\nPhoto Credit: [1][2]\n\nFurther Reading: [1]\n\nNorth America's terrestrial orchids seem to have mastered the disappearing act. When stressed, these plants can enter into a vegetative dormancy, existing entirely underground for years until the right conditions return for them to grow and bloom. Cryptic dormancy periods like this can make assessing populations quite difficult. Orchids that were happy and flowering one year can be gone the next... and the next... and the next...\n\nHow and why this dormancy is triggered has confused ecologists and botanists alike. Certainly stress is a factor but what else triggers the plant into going dormant? According to a recent paper published in the American Journal of Botany, the answer is fungal.\n\nOrchids are the poster children for mycorrhizal symbioses. Every aspect of an orchid's life is dependent on these fungal interactions. Despite our knowledge of the importance of mycorrhizal presence in orchid biology, no one had looked at how the abundance of mycorrhizal fungi influenced the life history of these charismatic plants until now.\n\nBy observing the presence and abundance of a family of orchid associated fungi known as Russulaceae, researchers found that the abundance of mycorrhizal fungi in the environment is directly related to whether or not an orchid will emerge. The team focused on a species of orchid known commonly as the small whorled pogonia (Isotria medeoloides). Populations of this federally threatened orchid are quite variable and assessing their numbers is difficult.\n\nThe team found that the abundance of mycorrhizal fungi is not only related to prior emergence of these plants but could also be used as a predictor of future emergence. This has major implications for orchid conservation overall. It's not enough to simply protect orchids, we must also protect the fungal communities they associate with.\n\nResearch like this highlights the need for a holistic habitat approach to conservation issues. So many species are partners in symbiotic relationships and we simply can't value one partner over the other. If conditions change to the point that they no longer favor the mycorrhizal partner, it stands to reason that it would only be a matter of years before the orchids disappeared for good.\n\nPhoto Credit: NC Orchid\n\nFurther Reading: [1]\n\nWhen we think of bird pollination, we often conjure images of a hummingbird sipping nectar from a long, tubular, red flower. Certainly the selection pressures brought about from entering into a pollination syndrome with birds has led to convergence in floral morphology across a wide array of different plant genera. Still, just when we think we have the natural world figured out, something new is discovered that adds more complexity into the mix. Nowhere is this more apparent than the peculiar relationship between an orchid and a bird native to South Africa.\n\nThe orchid in question is known scientifically as Disa chrysostachya. It is a bit of a black sheep of the genus. Whereas most Disa orchids produce a few large, showy flowers, this species produces a spike that is densely packed with minute flowers. They range from orange to red and, like most other bird pollinated flowers, produce no scent.\n\nTake the time to observe them in the field and you may notice that the malachite sunbird is a frequent visitor. The sunbirds perch themselves firmly on the spike and probe the shallow nectar spurs on each flower. At this point you may be thinking that the pollen sacs, or pollinia, of the orchid are affixed to the beak of the bird but, alas, you would be wrong.\n\nCloser inspection of the flowers reveal that the morphology and positioning of the pollinia are such that they simply cannot attach to the beak of the bird. The same goes for any potential insect visitors. The plant seems to have assured that only something quite specific can pick up the pollen. To see what is really going on, you would have to take a look at the sunbird's feet.\n\nThat's right, feet. When a sunbird feeds at the flowers of D. chrysostachya, its feet position themselves onto the stiffened lower portion of the flower. This is the perfect spot to come into contact with the sticky pollinia. As the bird feeds, they pick up the pollinia on their claws! The next time the bird lands to feed, it will inevitably deposit that pollen. The orchids seemed to have benefited from the fact that once perched, sunbirds don't often reposition themselves on the flower spike. In this way, self pollination is minimized. A close relative, D. satyriopsis, has also appeared to enter into a pollination with sunbirds in a similar way.\n\nThough it may seem inefficient, research has shown that this pollination mechanism is quite successful for the orchid.The pollinia themselves stick quite strongly so that no amount of scuffing on branches or preening with beaks can dislodge them. Once pollination has been achieved, each flower is capable of producing thousands upon thousands of seeds.\n\nPhoto Credit: Johnson and Brown\n\nFurther Reading: [1]"
