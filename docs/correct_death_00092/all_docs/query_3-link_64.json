        "text": "George's mother was Elizabeth Kappel and always reported that she had been born in Germany. Unlike her husband's unknown background, the passenger list that includes her family's names has survived. Her parents were Jacob and Christiana Kappel. They arrived in Baltimore in Oct. 1853 with five children - Elizabeth (“Betta”, 15), Carl (9), Philip (6), Ludwig (4), and Michael (2); son John was born not long after they arrived. Jacob gave the birthplace of all of them as Konigstetten, which is in Austria, about 25 or 30 km west of Vienna and declared himself to be a farmer. In the 1850s there was no “Germany”, but there was a German Confederation, which included two powerful “states”, Prussia and Austria, and a large number of smaller and weaker principalities, like Hesse. So “Germany”, until the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, actually included Austria.\n\nGeorge was the eldest of his parents' eight children, but only four of them survived until 1880 (and they all survived to 1900 or later). In 1870 he had four siblings: Carl, Philip, John and Margaret.\n\nCarl died sometime in the 1870s. At the tender age of one, George was living with his parents in Ellicott's Mills. His Kappel grandparents lived virtually next door along with the rest of their children, his aunts and uncles. By that time, Ellicott's Mills was a prosperous community, both in farming and manufacturing.\n\nThings changed drastically for the local people (Dolles and Kappels included) with the start of the Civil War. In the fall of 1862 Ellicott Mills became a defended community. The town was greatly stirred again two years later when defeated Union troops, retreating from their loss at the Battle of Monocacy, passed right through Ellicott Mills on their way to Baltimore.\n\nGeorge's father joined the 1st Maryland Cavalry in the fall of 1862. Either then, or later, after he had been discharged and rejoined the newly formed Veterans Reserve Corp, the whole Kappel-Dolle clan, moved into Baltimore, to the Canton district. As a boy of four or five (in 1863 and 1864),\n\nGeorge lived with his parents, his grandparents and his Kappel aunts and uncles, all together at the same address on Burke Street (now called Montford Street). His father was a soldier and his grandfather a laborer.\n\nThis living arrangement didn't last. The houses on Burke Street were small and the extended family was large (six Kappels and six Dolles), and growing. Anyway, in 1865 the Kappels were living elsewhere in Canton and the Dolles seem to have left Baltimore City, probably for a more rural location in Baltimore County. In 1870 this location was along the O'Donnell Street extension, just outside the city, where four cemeteries were located (Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church Cemetery, Mount Carmel Cemetery, St. Matthew's Church Cemetery, and First United Evangelical Church Cemetery). George's father was employed as a cemetery attendent at one of them.\n\nTheir surrounding neighbors in 1870 were mostly farmers and gardeners, so it was a more open place than Burke Street in Canton. Their closest neighbors belonged to the growing family of Cyrus Copper. He seems to have been a jack of many trades – farmer, gardener, smith's helper, streetcar driver, sexton. Moreover, he was a stockholder in the Mount Carmel Cemetery Company from its founding in 1854 and for many years was a superintendent at that cemetery (almost to his death in1910). George grew up with John Copper, Cyrus' firstborn, who was just six months younger. They were sure to have shared many adventures and scrapes.\n\nIn 1876 these two friends enlisted in the Apprentice program of the US Navy – they signed on as Apprentice Boys to train and serve until they turned 21 (in 1880). Sometime about then, between 1870 and 1880, George's father died. This began an important period in George's life, but apparently one that wasn't mentioned to later generations.\n\nAt that time the training of Apprentice Boys took place at the Brooklyn Naval Yard in New York. It took about six months for boys to be trained to the point where they were capable and safe aboard a cruising sailing ship. At that point they would be assigned to a regular cruising ship of the Navy. For George (and John) that assignment took place in early 1877 and the ship was the USS Trenton. In March, 1877 the Trenton set sail from New York for the Mediterranean where she was to spend the next few years as the flagship of the European US Naval Squadron. George spent the next two and a half years on the Trenton as an ordinary seaman as the ship visited various Mediterranean ports and made two cruises out of the Mediterranean to Northern European waters.\n\nIn late 1879 the Trenton's crew (George and John included) returned to New York as the crew of the USS Constellation. Before George's enlistment expired, however, he completed another cruise. The Constellation sailed in late March, 1880 to carry supplies to Ireland to help relieve the condition of the Irish who were suffering again from famine. This turned out to be a stormy and dangerous crossing, but successful and with little serious damage to the ship. She returned to New York in June 1880 and George became an adult and a civilian at the same time. Today, the restored USS Constellation is docked at Baltimore's Inner Harbor and, as a National Historic Site, can be visited by the public.\n\nWithin two years of his return to Baltimore, George began working as a laborer in various foundries in the Canton district. He also married Ida Buttner, who had migrated with her parents from Germany (Bavaria) in 1862. Their first two children, George John and Christina Eva, were born while they were living in Canton. By the time their third child, Andrew, came along, George had taken a job with the Baltimore Car Wheel and Foundry Company. Although it had begun its industrial life in Canton, the company had re-located to the northwest corner of the city, at Fulton Station, where the freight depot for the Western Maryland Railroad was sited. George moved their expanding family to a new home closer to his new job. This was followed by moves to a succession of other homes along Liberty Road near the developing neighborhood of Easterwood. They finally settled into the block of Presstman Street between Payson and Pulaski. They lived there with and among most of their children and grandchildren until the early 1920s when George retired from the foundry. Then they moved to the Baltimore Highlands, south of the city. This area was very rural in character in comparison with Easterwood.\n\nGeorge found some work nearby as a machinist. He worked at that right up to his death in December, 1930. Some of his children had also moved to Baltimore Highlands, while some remained in Easterwood. One of his grandchildren who lived nearby in remembers him less than fondly. When he was summoned to his grandparents' house around the corner to cut the grass, they always spoke in German, to each other seemingly and not to him, and showed him no affection. He was never given any explanation by his mother, but he certainly never felt welcomed by them. This is a very strange and sad legacy. Ida Dolle survived her husband by eleven years, continuing to house a few of their adult children until her death in 1941. It seems she could not, or chose not to speak English, a very sad postscript to this story.\n\nMr. Gessert was born in Hamburg, Germany, the son of Friedrich and trained there in sheet metal fabrication. In 1941 he enlisted in the navy rather than being drafted and given no choice. He spent most of his military career on patrol along the west coast of Germany and France. He took advantage of schools in boilers/engine room, machining and fire control. These skills allowed him, following the war, to get a job on a tugboat out of Hamburg, Germany. This was a prized position and he could live on board saving both room and meal expenses. His next position was on a ship that sailed on the Oder River making roundtrips from Hamburg to then Czechoslovakia. Here he rose to the position of Top Fireman.\n\nWaltraut was born in Stettin in Pommern (now a part of Poland), daughter of Albert Grunsdorf. She was not yet 14 years old when she began working as a mothers’ helper/nanny in 1943 as part of the war effort. Then in 1944 and ’45 she was put to work in a war factory making gaskets for machinery until the town was overrun by the Russians. On March 9, 1945, Waltraut, her mother and sister with her infant child were on the last train from Stettin to Greifswald (a town to the west in Pommern but still occupied by Russians). They left with what they could carry. They had already heard that her sisters’ husband was dead; they had no idea of the fate of whereabouts of her father and brother – both serving in the military.\n\nThree months of terrible conditions in Greifswald left them desperate enough to try to return to their home in Stettin. They were able to stay only 10 days; the Russians had given the land to the Poles and the Polish Army drove them out. On June 19, Waltrauts’ 16th birthday, the 3 generations endured a 17 hour forced march that ended in a farm village – also under Russian control. Fifteen families shared a farmhouse; Typhus ran rampant. There was no food: they boiled grasses and scavenged roots for something to eat. In a 5 month period, nearly half of the people died, including her sister’s infant. Waltraut was terribly ill and in and out of consciousness for 4 months and not given much chance for survival. In late November they heard that her father was in Hamburg! They went to the railroad tracks (there was no station) and climbed on a train as it slowed down in the village; the train was packed with people desperate to get out of the area. It took them back to Greifswald.\n\nThis time the Red Cross was there; it was now midwinter 1945/46. The Red Cross found them an unheated room with 1 bed while they were processed for relocation. They worked their way west, from camp to camp through scenes of incredible destruction, finally arriving in Hamburg in late spring. She found her father on a tugboat owned by the Portland Cement Co. Waltrauts’ sister went to live with her in-laws and Waltraut and her mother were able to share a small room on the tugboat with her father. They had family, a roof over their heads, heat and food; they were much more fortunate than most!\n\nThis of course, is where she met Fritz..they both moored in the same harbor. They were married in April 1947 and spent the first several months of their life together on a houseboat barge as Fritz worked the rivers. There were several other couples on board. Later that year, they were able to buy a one room summerhouse set in terraces on the outskirts of Hamburg. When their daughter Hannelore was born, they enlarged it and finally seemed to be returning to normalcy.\n\nIt was then the borders closed and shipping took a huge blow. It was then the family left from Bremerhaven in the middle of winter. They sailed on the SS United States and arrived on January 22, 1953. The stories of “gold in the streets” actually happened – Fritz found a dollar on the street in New York right after disembarking!!\n\nAfter spending a couple months with Fritzs’ uncle, the couple settled in an apartment on Hilton Street and began English language lessons. The German community was welcoming and soon they met others. It was one of their little German community that recommended Fritz apply at TipTop Bakery on Edmondson Avenue. Fritz worked there for 16 years, until the business was sold. He was responsible for the operation of all the machinery and later became a licensed engineer. He then worked Western Electric from 1969 to 1986. This business closed when Fritz was only two years from retirement.\n\nThe Gesserts lived in Linthicum in the home they purchased in 1957. They have two daughters, Hannelore and Karen and one son, Winfred (deceased).\n\nThe Gessert’s are Honorary Life members of the Baltimore Kickers. Fritz served as 2nd Vice-President. They were members of St. Johns Lutheran Church\n\nThe Gruber Family\n\nSource: Written by Lynn Thomas Gruber\n\nGruber, Johannes (1718 to)\n\nHans Jacob Gruber (1757 to 1847)\n\nMartin Gruber (1789 to 1871)\n\nThe Gruber family of Maisprach, Baselland, Switzerland immigrated to the then new United States in what we believe to be two waves. There could have been others, both earlier and later, but we have yet to find any records of them. In fact, the Kummler family of Maisprach, Baselland, Switzerland is documented to have immigrated to Pennsylvania in the ship Crown, arriving at the Port of Philadelphia in August of 1749 and being registered in Philadelphia on August 30, 1749. In the ship’s list, only the father, Hans Kummler, is named, with his name written in old script as “Hans Cumler.” We do not currently know of any connection between the two families but clearly they would have known each other coming from such a small village.\n\nBoth Gruber family groups arrived in Philadelphia after traveling up the Rhine River (which is very close to Maisprach) to Amsterdam and taking ship first to a port in England and then to the United States. After arriving in Philadelphia they soon found their way to the Baltimore and Hagerstown, MD. areas.\n\nThe family originated in the Gemeinde of Masiprach, Sissach District in the Basel-Landshaft Canton of Switzerland which is in the North Central part of Switzerland very near the city of Basel and the German and French borders. The family appears to have lived in this area at least from the early 16th century (1520s) and probably well before that. Grubers continue to live in Maisprach today. The village of Maisprach is tiny, with only about 950 inhabitants currently and in the late 18th century, when the Grubers immigrated, was probably no more that 300. The town was first mentioned in 1180CE, but the place was already populated in the Neolithic era and there was a Roman villa in the 2nd century CE. The village was a property of Farnsburg in Medieval times, until it was sold to Basel in 1461. A fire destroyed almost the complete village in 1546, and it suffered a lot in the Thirty Years War (1618-1648).\n\nViniculture has always played an important role in Maisprach. It had the first vineyards in Roman times and winegrowing is documented without interruption since 1328. Due to an excellent climate and geological conditions, Maisprach wine has a high quality and a good reputation in Switzerland, but is hardly known abroad.. Apart from winegrowing, the population was engaged in other forms of agriculture and some textile manufacturing in the 18th and 19th Centuries.\n\nThe first known to arrive in the United States was Johannes Gruber (Sr.) (b 1718. – d?. ) the son of Hans Jacob Gruber (b. 1689 – d?) and Anna Oberly Gruber (b. 1690 - d?) along with his son also called Johannes (b. 1746 - d.? ). While Johannes Sr., a locksmith by trade, was released from paying a manumission tax, his son Johannes Jr., had to pay a manumission fee along with a letter due and 10% tax that in total amounted to about 15% of his net worth in order to leave Switzerland. The tax was to allow him leave and to take his remaining assets out of the country. His occupation is shown as a \"turner\" which was most likely a woodworker. This “manumission” indicates that the Grubers were held in a serf –like state with obligation of service to the community and/or church hierarchy. Johannes Jr. also brought along his wife Anna Keller Gruber and five children, Anna (baptized 11/3/1783), Anna Maria (baptized 2/6/1785), Hans Georg (baptized 2/20/1787), Ursula (baptized 1/17/1790), and Johannes III (baptized 1/1/1781).They arrived in Philadelphia (or possibly the Carolinas) in 1790. (Per “List of Swiss Emigrants in the 18th Century to the American Colonies” Volume II) At some point before the turn of the 19th century they moved to the Baltimore area.\n\nThe second wave arrived on September 10, 1803 on the ship Commerce captained by Nathanial Ray and originating from Amsterdam. While they came into the port of Philadelphia, they soon followed their family to Maryland settling in Baltimore. According to the book “Passenger Arrivals - Port of Philadelphia” by Tepper, on the Commerce were Hans Jacob Gruber (b. 1757 – d. 1847) the son of Johannes Sr. (shown as Jacob). and brother to Johannes Jr. both of whom came in 1790. In addition were his wife Maria Mangold Gruber (b. ca 1760 – d.?), and children Elisabeth Gruber (1796.? – d.?), Anna Gruber (b1798 – d?), Anna Barbara Gruber (b. 1801 – d.?), Anna Maria Gruber (b. 1787 – d?), Eva Gruber (b.1799 – d?) and Martin Gruber (b. 1789- d. 1871) Martin Gruber is the Great, Great Grandfather of the author of this document, Lynn Thomas Gruber.\n\nAlso on the ship Commerce in 1803 were Hendrick Mangold, Anna Mangold (wife of Hendrick), and their children Anna Maria Mangold and Hendrick Mangold Jr. It is not known if this is the father or brother of Maria Mangold Gruber and his family or if there is any relationship with Maria Mangold Gruber and these Mangolds. It is highly likely however that there is and that both families came to the US together. Maria Mangold was a native of the town of Buus, not Maisprach, so it is possible that this family was also from Buus.\n\nAn interesting reference to a Gruber in Baltimore is noted in the book “America Experienced – 18th and 19th Century Swiss Immigrants” on page 210. In one of the letters documented in the book, a Swiss immigrant, Arnold Howard, a naturalist who was traveling from Baltimore, MD. to Athens, OH., notes in a letter written on January 30th, 1825 after arriving in Baltimore…”When we first came to town, it seemed to us that everything was all English. But after finding one German, we soon found Germans and Swiss aplenty. The sailors had guided us to a German woman innkeeper from Bremen who has been there already for some 20 years. Although her fare was plentiful, good, and cheaper than at the ins in Havre, we soon found a Swiss by the name of Gruber from the Basel region, a locksmith who lives on Uhlers Ally [Alley} where the printing press from the Mariland (sp) German newspaper of Hanzsche was located at the corner of the intersection with Charles Street.” This could not be Johannes Gruber, Sr. as he would have been well over 100 by 1825 if alive. In the 1814-1815 edition of the Baltimore Directory, a “Gruber, Jacob, locksmith” is listed residing in Uhlers Alley. Thus it was most likely Hans Jacob Gruber (b. 1757 – d. 1847) who arrived on the ship Commerce in 1803 that is mentioned in Howard’s letter. Swiss records show him as a locksmith like his father Johannes (b. 1718).\n\nUhlers Alley no longer exists but would have run on a Northwest/Southeast line from just beyond the Baltimore Basin about halfway between S. Charles St. and Light St. starting on East Pratt St and ending somewhere near the current Baltimore St. & Light Railway Station on S. Howard St. near The Baltimore Arena. The corner where it intersected with Charles St. would be very close to today’s Bank of America Center in downtown Baltimore. Unfortunately the family did not hold on to land in what is now the heart of downtown Baltimore, today worth millions of dollars!\n\nWhile many Grubers continue to live in Maryland, others moved far and wide within the United States. The line of Martin Gruber (b. 1789-d 1871), my great, great grandfather, is no exception. Martin married two times, his first wife Elisabeth (Stud?) dying in an August, 1832 “plague” (probably a cholera epidemic) in Baltimore. A family letter indicates that “she was healthy in the morning and dead by the evening…”. The children of that marriage, with the exception of the youngest, Sarah Ann (b.1832 –d. 1922), quickly moved away from Baltimore upon their mothers death and Martin’s remarriage in 1836 to Elizabeth Schroder (or Shroder). With 9 children from the first marriage and 7 more to come in the second, there was probably little room at home and who knows what the relationshop was with their stepmother. My great grandfather, Lewis Henry Gruber (b. 1823- d. 1911) left home at age 13 in 1836, and traveled by foot to Cincinnati, OH., Lousiville, Kentucky, and then Shelbyville, Kentucky in 1840 where he finally settled and prospered, setting the roots for this branch of the family for many years. The author’s grandfather, also named Lynn Thomas Gruber (b. 1859- b. 1912) and father, Herbert Calvin Gruber (b. 1901- d. 1979), were both born in Shelbyville. Martin (b. 1789), along with his daughter Sarah Ann from his first marriage and all of the children then born from the second marriage packed up and moved to Plum, PA. (outside of Pittsburgh near the current town of Oakmont, PA.) in the early 1840’s (probably 1843 or 1844) where he and his second wife lived out their lives leaving many Gruber relatives in that general area.\n\nHenning, Brigitte (2-17-1929 to )\n\nMs. Henning was born in Breslau Germany (then Schlesien (Silesia). From 1951 to 1953, she trained as a pediatric nurse in Kinderklinik, in Hannover, Germany. Her training led her to the profession of a child caretaker or ‘nanny’. She began that career caring for a young infant in Instanbul, Turkey, where she remained until 1956. She then came to the United States and to Glyndon, Maryland, where she cared for two children until 1958. She returned to Germany in June of 1959 and worked as a nurse in a children’s hospital for 10 months. An offer she couldn’t refuse lured her back to the US and to Glyndon. Here she took a position as a Governess, with nursing and housekeeping duties. Her charges were four boys. The boys had been left without a mother. Upon the father’s remarriage, she left that employ and worked for another family for 2 ½ years. She then attempted to try Europe again, but realized she had not only become a US citizen, she became Americanized. She returned in 1968 and began working for a family with 3 children. She stayed there for 45 years.\n\nBrigitte now lives happily in a Retirement Home. She is still active in the Zion Church community.\n\nBrigitte wrote the story below and has given us permission to reprint it here.\n\nA Day I Will Remember Forever\n\nBy Brigitte Henning\n\nJanuary 23, 1945, the day my life was uprooted and changed forever.\n\nMy hometown Breslau, capital city of Silesia, the far eastern province of Germany, lay in the path of the advancing Russian army. Its citizens were encouraged, better, ordered, to leave the city. The order came by radio loudspeakers in the streets at six o’clock in the evening. The temperature was below 0 degrees F. Some people left into the frigid night.\n\nMy family consisted, besides my mother who had just turned 40, my brothers 6 and 13, and myself, almost 16, of my maternal grandmother and her 80-year-old brother-in-law, my great-uncle, who had been married to Grandmother’s sister, who recently had died in Frankfurt/Oder. My great-uncle, not having any other family, had moved to Breslau to live with Grandmother.\n\nIt was my mother to whom the burden fell to be responsible and in charge of the six of us. My heart still aches for her. However human beings are resilient, so, not knowing what lay ahead, we started to think what to take. Mother refused to go into the night, exploring other possibilities during the next day. The city grew more quiet, almost eerie, when we were told about meeting places from where people would be transported out of the city.\n\nWe had been packing our rucksacks, being told only to take as much as we could carry. After six years of war and hunger, we all were feeble and weak. Grandmother, frail Uncle Max, my little brother, who had only known hunger and deprivation, what could they carry? I can’t remember much of what everyone ended up taking, but I took three books, German classic ballads, Goethe’s Faust, and a small New Testament. We wore several layers of clothes, but had no good shoes or boots. There were no snow jackets, nothing of the warm outer clothing one has now. Then we were told about a place to go to the next morning.\n\nNot having a sister, I loved my childhood friend, Renate, dearly. Since 1938 we had been inseparable, even though going to different schools after 1939, but being at home in each other’s families. Now, we had to part, her family having different plans. We hugged and cried, fearing we were all going to die, never seeing each other again. However, I gave her an address of my aunt in Berlin, the only family member to have stayed in the same place, we hoped.\n\nThe next morning we took our bundles and rucksacks to leave everything behind that so far was our life. The things we loved, the warmth of the apartment that had sheltered us, the life that we had believed would go on and on.\n\nWe closed the front door, trudged into the snow, carrying our few possessions and holding onto each other.\n\nComing to that gathering place, big open trucks waited for us. We climbed onto one; when it was full with standing people it took off. We drove for hours along country roads clogged with people fleeing in all directions, many on foot, pushing baby carriages piled high with their possessions that were later discarded by the side of the road out of exhaustion, just like horses that died after not being able to pull their loads anymore. By the evening our group was deposited in a country inn. No one knew what was to become of us.\n\nWe would be on the road for seven months. My father, his younger brother, and cousin would be killed not long before the war ended in Berlin. The Russians occupied half of Germany, and we learned that we would never be able to get back to Breslau. At the Yalta Conference the Allies ceded ¼ of Germany to Poland; with that 12 million Germans losing their homeland, becoming refugees for years to come. I was one of the 12 million.\n\nHofstetter, Lawrence (1823 to )\n\nLawrence was born in Germany, the oldest son of Joseph and Mary Hofstetter. Joseph and Mary were farmers in Baltimore County, specifically on Furley Avenue in Gardenville. Joseph was married three times and Lawrence was a product of the first marriage, along with seven other sons.\n\nLawrence was educated in the public schools. He purchased his home in 1847. He transformed the home into a beautiful garden with large shade trees and ornamental hedges. He married Catherine Lutz in October of 1846. Catherine was the daughter of Valentine and Mary Lutz. They had four sons and three daughters.\n\nHe was a member of the Gardenville Lodge No. 114, I.O.O.F.\n\nImwold, John A. (10-29-1847 to )\n\nJohn was the son of John B (6-15-181 to 1873) and Catherine Weltner (to 1894), natives of Germany. John B. was a farmer by trade. John B. immigrated to the US at the age of eighteen and began to work as an agriculturist. He purchased a farm in Baltimore County\n\nJohn A. was educated at a German Lutheran school in Baltimore. He was a member of the shield of Honor and the Junior Order of American Mechanics.\n\nThey spent their entire life farming and were well respected in their Baltimore county community.\n\nJoh, Louis (9-29-1864 to 11-16-1947)\n\nLouis was the son of Adam W. Joh (1816-1895), a German that settled in the area in the 1870s. He purchased land to farm and found that the estate of the Duchess of Leeds, granddaughter of Chrarles Carroll was being sold off. St. Agnes purchased a huge piece, as did St. Mary’s Industrial School. John purchased 70 acres at the time. This area was later called Violetville because the caretaker of the local cemetery raised only violets in his greenhouse. When Adam died his sons Louis and Adam inherited the land. Both were farmers.\n\nLouis Joh was a magistrate and handled traffic cases that occurred in the area known as Violetville. A little neighborhood bounded by Wilkins Avenue and St. Agnes Hospital. He sat on the bench before World War I. It was then in Baltimore County. He quit his job as magistrate when he became conflicted over whether or not true justice was being served. He returned to his former job working for the building and loan association and a real estate firm, in the process of laying out a development. Joh Avenue in the area was named after him.\n\nLouis died November 16, 1947 and is buried at Loudon Park Cemetery.\n\nJuergensen, Werner (1928-2011)\n\nWerner Juergensen was born on April 16, 1928 in Westerland on the Island of Sylt. Werner played in the amateur league with Schleswig-Holstein. He came to the United States in 1952. He met a Ukranian who introduced him to the soccer team with whom he played his first season. During that year, he met many different Germans, among them Eddie Thau. After a discussion about soccer with Eddie in 1953, the Baltimore Kickers Club was created. In the beginning, he served as financial secretary until becoming president from 1964 to 1965.\n\nThe highlights of his term in office were instituting the Alcazar Dances, taking part in bringing back the Max Blob team, and securing a clubroom for the Kickers at the Deutsches Haus. Still active in the club, he also held the title of First Vice-President.\n\nAlong with wife Irene, who passed away February 8, 2010, they assisted with our popular Schlachtfest, held twice a year. Long-time participants in the Oktoberfest, he and Irene, for many years, chaired a bratwurst stand at our annual German Festival.\n\nWerner and Irene had one daughter. Werner passed away in November 27, 2011.\n\nKirschenhofer, George (8-23-1842 to)\n\nMr. Kirschenhofer was a self made man. He was one of the leading wagon and carriage manufacturers in the city. He was born in Regensburg, Bavaria, Germany. His father and grandfather were both carpenters and builders. His mother, Barbara (Bauer) was born in Sessenbach, Bavaria. She died in 1891. They had eight children.\n\nGeorge received his early training at Straubing, where at the age of twelve, he was apprenticed to the wagon and carriage trade under his uncle Casper Bauer. He remained with his uncle for three years and then worked as a journeyman in Austria and Germany for six years. He returned to Bavaria and entered the army as a member of the Third Mounted Artillery Regiment and served for five years in the Bavarian Battery and in the Austro-Prussian war. He participated in the battles of Rosbrunn and Kissingen.\n\nHe wanted to earn his fortune in the new world and left his native land in 1868. He arrived in the U.S. aboard the steamer Berlin after a twenty day voyage. He landed in Baltimore on October 20, 1868. He worked his trade in Baltimore until May 1869 and left to go west, spending a year in Cincinnati, St. Louis and Chicago before returning to Baltimore where he worked for two more years.\n\nHe joined Rhein & Duncan in 1874 and became a member of the firm of Nicholas Foustich & Co. He stayed with them for eight years when the partnership dissolved.\n\nHe moved then to Eager and Bond Streets where he operated a blacksmith shop on the first floor a wheelright and trimming shop on the second and a paint shop on the third floors. Here he made all types of high grade wagons and carriages but his specialty was the large wagons he made for the Germania Brewing Company. He patented a number of useful inventions for improving wagons and carriages including an ‘anti-roller’ shaft coupling.\n\nHe married Mary Rheinhart who was born in New York. Together they had six children, Anton, George, Charles, Catherine (Kate), Mary and Fredericka. In 1900, the family lived at 1427 Preston Street. The 1906 Baltimore Directory has his business listed as George Kirschenhofer & Sons (and lists George, Jr. and Charles).\n\nMr. Kirschenhofer was a Democrat and served as a judge of elections. He belonged to the King David Lodge, A. F. & A. M., with the Ancient Order of United Workmen, Vorwaerts Turnverein, the Kriegerbund and for the six years has been president of Arion Singing Society. He was well loved and well respected in the community.\n\nLeinemann, Manfred ‘Fred’ (5-23-1938 to 8-30-2014)\n\nFred was born in Klein Ilsede, Germany and immigrated to the US in 1966. He began his own business in 1969, the Lanham Construction Company, which is still in operation. He was a member of the German Arminius Lodge #25, the DC Rotary Club in Bladensburg, the Washington Sängerbund, the Concord Club and the Baltimore Kickers. He enjoyed travelling, gardening and spending time with his family especially his grandchildren.\n\nHe married Elisabeth, born also in Germany, and together they have three sons, Andrew, Oliver and Mark.\n\nFred passed away after a freak accident during a family ‘Labor Day’ celebration.\n\nModro, Rosa (1935)\n\nI was born in 1935, in the city of Nuremberg, Germany. I was the youngest in a family of three girls. My father left soon after I was born and we were raised strictly by our mother. For the first 5 years of my young life I had a fairly happy childhood.\n\n1942 started a new chapter for me, it was my first year of school. Suddenly I became aware that there was a war going on. Everyone was talking about air raids. Because of the imminent attacks we were trained in school about safety rules , behavior and how to proceed to the nearest shelter in case of an air raid. My first experience with such an attack came in the spring of 1943. I was horrified but little did I know what was yet to come. Next to Dresden, Nuremberg was the city with the greatest destruction in Germany. The biggest air raid on the city came on January 2, 1945.Within hours 90% of the old and most beautiful part of the city was destroyed. I lost schoolmates, friends and neighbors and my oldest sister was very badly hurt and never fully recovered from it.\n\nWe were very happy when the war finally came to an end, in April of 1945.Nobody thought Germany was ever coming back from all that devastation. Everything was destroyed and lay in ruins and ashes. Food was scares and so was everything else, including my education.\n\nFinally in 1947, I could go back to school and things started looking up for me. Also, food wise! As we lived in the US occupied zone, the US Forces supplied school children daily with a warm meal .Lunchtime didn’t come around fast enough for me.\n\nI graduated in 1952. As it is customary in Germany, I was trying to continue my education with a mandatory 3 year apprenticeship. I was trying very hard to find a place in the commercial sector or where ever else possible. But to no avail! There were to many young people and not enough jobs. So I went to enroll for 1 year of Home Economic School. Following that year, I finally started my apprenticeship. Along with learning your trade, you also attend 3 years of trade school. The pay was very low, approximately $40.00 a month and my income was not exactly great after I finished and past my examination requirements.\n\nIn 1956 , I decided to try my luck in Australia. Through friends which had migrated to this continent in 1953 I heard that the Australian Government was looking for workers and would pay for the fare as long as you agreed to stay for at least 2 years. It was a long trip of 6 weeks. Our ship had to sail around the Cape of Horn, since the Suez canal was blocked due to the war between Egypt & Israel, I arrived in Sidney in January of 1957.\n\nI quickly found work with Lever Brothers, a subsidiary of Uniliver and I worked there for my entire stay. I grew very fond of this lovely country with it’s beautiful Beaches, natural Harbor and of course the Australian people. But it was so far from home and I missed my family. So after a stay of 4 years I decided to return home. It was April of 1961.\n\nOnce more I was looking for work! But now I was in the command of the English language and I tried to use it to my advantage. I was lucky! The 7th US Army was hiring German people with knowledge of the English language. I applied and was hired. I worked in the office of the 7th US Army QM 106. This time I decided not leave my family again. During my absence things had changed for the better in Germany. The economy had taken off, (Wirtschaftswunder) and there was now plenty of work and a lot of rebuilding going on.\n\nBut in 1964 I changed my mind and came to the United States to get married. We lived in Cape Canaveral, Florida for 9 month because my husband’s step-father worked for NASA there. Work was not easy to find, so when he was transferred to Sacramento, California we moved with them. Not much better there, so we came east and settled in Baltimore. We both were working now but he grew more and more restless and decided to reenlist in the army. After training in Ford Brag he was promptly deployed to Vietnam and then Korea. We drifted apart and the marriage ended. For me it was once more decision time\n\nI had a good job, made friends of my own and grown close to a family I rented from . I had joined a church I was very active in and generally was happy with my life. Germany was not too far away I could go and visit my family when I wanted too. So I decided to stay. Two years after my divorce I met my current husband. We have been married now for 36 1/2 years and still going strong.\n\nAfter my decision to stay in the USA, I became a naturalized citizen and I am proud of it. When I remarried in 1974 I became a member of the Zion Church of the city of Baltimore. The church, build in 1755 by German emigrants, is the only church left in Maryland today, that still holds a German service on Sunday morning. At one time there were 43 in Maryland. Zion Church still cherishes a lot of German customs and its’ members faithfully keep up some of the traditions. For instance, Sour Beef and Dumpling Dinners in October and the annual Christmas Market the end of November.\n\nI still make trips to Europe to visit my family but I also like to travel in the United States. After all those years living here, I am still mesmerized by the vastness of this country. I would like to see more of it before it is too late to travel.\n\nWritten by Rosa Modro 2012\n\nPerlitz, Elsbeth Emma (2-28-1912 to 1-13-2009)\n\nAs provided by her granddaughter, Ilka Knüppel\n\nElsbeth Emma Perlitz was born in Alvensleben, Germany, on February 28, 1912. Elsbeth was raised mostly by her grandparents, Christian and Luise Kastner Perlitz, who had five other children. Her childhood seemed full of happy memories although there must have been deprivation during the Great War. Elsbeth told me that during the war there was nothing to eat but potatoes.\n\nAfter the war, in February 1920, her mother, Emma, married Paul Mühlmann. While they married in Alvensleben, they lived in Magdeburg on Nachtweide Strasse 31A where Paul’s print shop was located. It appears Elsbeth continued to reside with her grandparents in Alvensleben. Elsbeth soon got a sister and two brothers in 1920, 1921, and 1928.\n\nAt the age of 18, Elsbeth boarded the ship, Stuttgart, for the United States and landed in NYC on August 10, 1930. Her sponsor was an uncle, William Perlitz, who lived in Annapolis. My grandmother worked as a house cleaner to earn money.\n\nIn 1935, Elsbeth went home to visit family. Her Reich Pass shows that she came to the Hansa Haus in Baltimore where the German Consulate was located to obtain her necessary paperwork. The pictures show a happy visit to see her siblings, mother, stepfather, and grandmother. This would be the last time she ever saw her family. Her brother, Heinz, would die at Stalingrad at the age of 21 in January 1943 his last letters home were captured when the Russians overtook the Germany Army airfields and exist at the Volvograd Museum in Volvograd, Russia. Her sister, Ruth, who had contracted Scarlet Fever at the age of two leaving her intellectually disabled, would die in the gas chamber at Bernburg Euthanasia Center on March 31, 1941 under Hitler’s secret euthanasia program.\n\nElsbeth would meet my grandfather, another German immigrant, Henry August Julius Knuppel, at a dance at the Indian Springs Country Club sponsored by the German Singing Society. They would marry on October 17, 1936, at St. Paul’s Lutheran Church in Baltimore, Maryland. While they lived in Washington DC, they came to Baltimore to get married because St. Paul’s at that time was a German speaking Lutheran church. St. Paul’s was located at Saratoga and Fremont Streets in 1936 but the building no longer exists.\n\nElsbeth and Henry would have two children and raise them in a house, first on Belmont Street in Washington DC, and then on Piney Branch Road in Silver Spring, Maryland. Elsbeth continued to clean houses for people and save her money. My grandparents bought 25 acres in the early 1960’s and retired to Berkeley Springs, WV, where they raised steers, chickens, and geese. Their seven grandchildren loved to come to the farm for visits and would often stay weeks in the summer. They kept a garden and lived there until the 1990’s when my grandfather’s declining health caused them to move in with my father at his place in Woodbine, Maryland. My grandfather passed in 1995 but Oma would almost reach her 98th birthday in 2009. In her last years, she would ask me to buy money orders to send to her only surviving sibling who lived in East Germany.\n\nI never truly realized and appreciated my grandmother’s strength until I became an adult. She was an example of quiet strength, good humor, caring for others and the famous German tenacity that got her through two world wars, near starvation, immigrating to a foreign country, and raising a family.\n\nHans Michael Reisner (aka: Risner) (3-11-1706 to UNK)\n\nFarmer & Carpenter\n\nSource: Robert W. Whittaker, Descendant & Family Researcher\n\nA Memorial Marker for Hans Michael Reisner was placed in Maryland on October 25, 2007. In 1738 Hans Michael Reisner patented 200 acres about 3 miles south of present Thurmont Maryland and called it Green Spring. It is today a cattle farm and still called Green Spring.\n\nAll the Risners of Eastern Kentucky are descended from this German immigrant. A small group joined together, combined funds and our time to research the life of Hans Michael in Germany and America. It has taken several years and continues yet today. This involved visits to Maryland and paid USA and German research. This work will be documented and donated to the Magoffin County Historical Society.\n\nHans Michael Reisner was born 11 March 1706 in the village of Gemmingen Germany. This is in southwest Germany, a few miles west of Heilbronn, in the present state of Wurttemberg-Baden Germany. He is the son of Johann Michael Reissner b. 1675 d. 1759 and Marie “Barbara” Besch b. 1676 d. 1720. He is the grandson of Michael Arnold Reussner b. 1648 d. 1713 and Unk Metzger [pending research]. We have found these siblings of Hans Michael:\n\nAnna Catharina b. 1700\n\nMaria Margaretha b. 1701 died young\n\nMaria Magdalena b. 1704 died young\n\nMaria Elisabetha b. 1708\n\nMaria Sabina b. 1711\n\nJohnann Frederick b. 1713\n\nGeorge David b. 1714 died young\n\nJohann Tobias b. 1705 immigrated to Maryland\n\nJoachim b. 1718 died young\n\nGotlieb b. 1720 mother died and the child lived\n\nHans Michael Reisner married 3 January 1729 to Margaretha Catharina Hammel b. 1702 d. 1754-58 in MD, the daughter of Johann “Hanns” Hammel b. 1695 d. 1721 and Margaretha Hoffer b. 1699 d. 1744/45. Their children born in Germany are:\n\nJohann Frederick b. 1730\n\nAnna Catharina b. 1731\n\nThe southwestern part of Germany is called Palatine. In feudal times it was Roman Catholic. With the advent of Protestant Reformation, war rage between these groups from 1618 to 1648 [The 30 Years War] and conflict continued for many years. This result was half the population killed, villages burned and major relocation of populations. The largest immigration to the Colonies was of German extraction. The immigration route was down the Rhine River to Rotterdam Holland and via ship to the Colonies.\n\nHans Michael Reisner sold property in Gemmingen Germany for 20 Florins in 1732. He paid “every third penny on houses/barns and every tenth penny on land for tax” for permission to export to Philadelphia. The ship Dragon under Master Charles Hargrave sailed from Rotterdam stopped in Plymouth England and arrived in Philadelphia 30 Sept 1732. There were 55 Palatines, who with their families numbered 170. Hans Michael Reisner swore the Oath of Allegiance at the Philadelphia Court House.\n\nThe Quaker William Penn obtained a charter for Pennsylvania in 1681. Penn established the Colony in 1682 with the “First Frame of Government”. It provided for secure private property, free enterprise, a free press, trial by jury, religious freedom and low taxes/tariffs. There was a flood of immigrants and when Hans Michael Reisner arrived in 1732, good land was scarce and expensive. Lancaster Pennsylvania is due west of Philadelphia about 40 miles and Hans Michael went there. South of Pennsylvania is Maryland. There is an area of 40-50 miles wide and stretching westward dividing the two Colonies and was in “dispute” between Maryland and Pennsylvania. The Susquehanna River flows across southern Pennsylvania and empties into the head of Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. West of the Susquehanna River and in this “disputed” area there was little settlement by Indian or Whites in the 1730s.\n\nThomas Cresap settled in this “disputed” area and claimed it for Maryland. In 1734 Hans Michael Reisner was working on the farm of Thomas Cresap, when he and others were arrested by Pennsylvania authorities and taken to the Lancaster Pennsylvania jail. This was the beginning of a 2-3 year bloody conflict. Hans Michael Reisner was in the middle of these fights. This border was settled 50-60 years later and marked by two men named Mason and Dixon.\n\nIn 1738, in this “disputed” land, Hans Michael Reisner surveyed and deeded 200 acres in north central Maryland. He called it Cat Tail Marsh. Today it is rural farm land and horse farms. It is in Carroll County, north of Winchester Maryland. George Bare was a passenger with Hans Michael on the ship Dragon. Bare had bought the rights to 200 acres in Maryland, when the ship Dragon stopped in Plymouth England. 8 Feb 1738 Bare signed the grant to Hans Michael with no comment. 9 Aug 1738 Hans Michael surveyed and deeded these 200 acres. He called it Green Spring and this became his home.\n\nGreen Spring is in north western Maryland, about 3 miles south of Thurmont in Frederick County Maryland. This area became the “Monocacy” and was almost all Germans. Hans Michael was a carpenter and farmer. His father had farmed vineyards. Sometime in the 1738 to 1743 period the old log Monocacy Church was built “one short mile north of Reisner’s Plantation”. Hans Michael was an active member of the church. Reisner bought 50 acres in 1743 about a mile north of Green Spring and called it Smiths Lot. It was probably here that the log church was built. The Monocacy Church, with its 8- 10 graves, has never been found.\n\nMonocacy was a German settlement in an English Colony. Few Germans could read or write English, understand the English laws and customs and they had a different religion. Hans Michael Reisner was a respected leader and spokesman for his German community. His conflicts with the English authorities were many and recorded in the Colonial Court records. As one said “he was no shrinking violet”. Hans Michael Reisner/Risner was in debtor’s prison from 1758 to 1761. I believe he lost many wagons and supplies, as a contractor, when the English General Braddock was defeated by the French in 1755. His son Michael Risner Sr. probably served later in the French and Indian War.\n\nAfter Braddock’s defeat, the French encouraged Indian attacks on the frontier. The Monocacy was in the center of these of these Indian raids. Most of the frontier population moved east as England and the Colonial government provided no protection. The devastation in cruelty, lost of life and property was great. There is a rock structure built on a hill on Green Spring. In the late 1800s, it still had a heavy log structure on top with slits in the logs for firing guns. I believe this was built for defense against these Indian attacks. But, Hans Michael was in debtor’s prison from 1758 to 1761 during these attacks. We know from a record that Hans Michael’s wife was dead by 1758. It is possible Catharina Reisner stayed at Green Spring and was killed in these raids.\n\nIn 1762 Hans Michael Reisner sold Green Spring and disappeared from proven records. There was a 50 acre grant by Virginia in 1763 to a Michael Risoner. There are some records of a Michael Risner after 1763 in old Augusta County VA. I believe this was probably a grant to Hans Michael for his service at Braddock’s defeat in 1755. These 50 acres are under the manmade Claytor Lake in central Virginia. Hans Michael probably lived out his elder years and is buried there. His son Michael Risner Sr. married Catarina “Catharina/Caty” Seches/Six and died in then Knox County Kentucky. He is buried on Brownies Creek in present Bell County Kentucky. His grandson Michael Risner Jr. married Sarah Howard and moved to Floyd/ Magoffin County Kentucky. His grave is lost to time and a Memorial Marker is in the Risner/Gose Cemetery in Magoffin County Kentucky in his honor.\n\nWith the help of Ray and Louise Ediger, the owners of Green Spring, Betty and I placed this marker to honor an old ancestor and record a little history in granite. I found it moving and rewarding to trace his life, walk on his land and mark his memory in granite. May my two Magoffin County Risner grandmothers know our ancestor has not been forgotten.\n\nTo read more:\n\nHans Michael Reisner-Speculation\n\nNews Article: ‘1728 Outline Still Visable Today’ THE POST, Frederick, Maryland\n\nAhnentafel of Sir Arnoldt Reusner\n\nAlfred Zeller was born on May 21, 1924 in Stuttgart, Germany.\n\nLife was good-the worst of the post-war hard times were over, soccer was King and he was its’ Prince! Alfred had hoped to make his mark in the world on the soccer field. Unfortunately, the world had other plans. He was drafted into the army at 17, even though he had only 1 more year to finish his mechanical apprenticeship. In 1942, with only 4 weeks basic training, he was sent to the Russian Front; the entire regiment was young and green. It was an absolute rout. The few survivors were hospitalized; Alfred with neck and shoulder wounds. Back to the war….this time in southern Hungary; his unit was overrun and in the retreat and crossfire of unexpected SS replacements he was severely wounded-in the legs and the muscle in his left arm was nearly severed. He was captured and imprisoned. Because the prison was somehow connected to an American, it was spared bombing. While recuperating, he came upon the same Doctor who had patched him up the first time. He took an interest in him and worked to restore his arm, which by this time, had been nearly useless for almost 2 years. He was released from prison in 1946; he was 1 of only 3 from his town that made it home from the war. Stuttgart had been nearly destroyed; there was no work for him-very hard times.\n\nMore recuperation and eventually he was given his old type job back, but because of his injuries, he did mostly supervision and quality control. Gradual reconditioning and the ability to play a little music again certainly improved his lifestyle and outlook. (Alfred’s father had given him a small accordion when he was a teenager-he taught himself to play by ear…he did not read music). He started playing a bit of soccer and attempted to build a normal life.\n\nAlfred’s mother’s best friend, Anna, had immigrated to the US prior to the war; she had joined her brother who was a gardener at Notchcliff in Glenarm, MD. The friends had kept in touch over the years, even after they married and started their families. After the war, THE MOTHERS got a pen-pal thing going so that Anna’s daughter Marlene (Haupt) could ‘improve her German’, and Alfred would have ‘something to do’ while he was recuperating. She was 14 and a ‘kid’. He was 22 and had been to war. So, he corrected her letters and went about his life.\n\nIn 1951, five years and many corrected letters later, the family came to Germany for a visit. Somehow, Alfred had offered to ‘show the kid around a little’ when she came over; he was ‘detailed’ to meet the train. The ‘kid’ was now 19 and now a grown woman. A whirlwind courtship ensured; they were married-he was a war groom!! This was no easy feat. Alfred fondly remembers all of his friends and relatives bending over backwards to provide a beautiful wedding for them and the generosity of German Organizations, which gave money towards his passage. Then to American by ship-14 days-from Genoa, through Gibraltar, Halifax and into New York Harbor.\n\nThey immigrated to the United States in 1951. He played soccer professionally with the Baltimore Rockets and later with the Baltimore Kickers from 1954 to 1965. He became the Kicker’s president in 1966. He initiated many new ideas for the betterment of the Club. His wife and son were both very active for many years."
