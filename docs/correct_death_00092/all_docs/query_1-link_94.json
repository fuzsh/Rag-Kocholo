Three detailed reference works on orchids, containing detailed lists on orchids and their hybrids.Detailing the many different species of orchids found around the world, including one volume focusing solely on orchid hybrids.This is an important guide to orchids which was re-edited and amended for decades after its first publication, an essential reference for orchidologists.This set includes two copies of 'Sanders' Orchid Guide', one volume bringing the text up to date to the 1st January 1901. The differences in the text show the expansion of the orchid growing industry and how many new hybrids had been cultivated.Compiled by Henry Frederick Conrad Sander, an orchidologist and nurseryman. He also published a monthly magazine on orchids named 'Reichenbachia'.'Orchid Hybrids' dated 1906 from Jisc, from a copy held at Kew Gardens. Interleaved with blank lined pages for notes.

For international/expedited customers, please inquire for rates]. The extraordinary magnum opus of Henry Frederick Conrad Sander, a German-born orchidologist who spent much of his career in England. Sander named the collection after Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach, a fellow German and fellow orchidologist, and drew heavily on Reichebach's work for the text in this collection. The majority of the life-size plates are based on watercolors by Henry George Moon, who eventually became Sander's son-in-law. Although Reichenbachia was not the first collaboration between Moon and Sanders (they first met in 1884, when Moon visited Sander's orchid nursery to make drawings for another publication), it is the work for which they are both most famous. The blocks on Moon's watercolors were hand-made out of wood, and the chromolithographs produced from them sometimes required as many as twenty inks; once the printing was completed, many of the plates were individually hand-finished. As a result, the work was fantastically expensive to print, reportedly costing well over £7,000 (over $1.2 million today). 1348849. FP New Rockville Stock.\n\nFIRST EDITION. 545 x 406 mm.

Occasional light scattered foxing internally (including a handful of plates), several plates with expert (virtually indistinguishable) repairs to small patches of color (where the tissue guards were sticking--a common problem with this work), but overall AN EXTREMELY APPEALING COPY of a work often found in very disagreeable shape. Imposingly large and impressively illustrated, the present volumes reflect the collective efforts of one of the most successful nursery owners in England, a leading 19th century orchidologist, and a devoted landscape and botanical artist. German émigré Henry Sander (1847-1920) was the owner of a highly successful nursery located in St. Albans that catered, above all, to the orchid market. At the height of his business, Sander was the royal orchid grower to Queen Victoria, built over 60 greenhouses to house his orchid imports, and employed collectors in remote areas across the globe, including parts of Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Mexico, Madagascar, New Guinea, and Burma. Sitwell calls the present work \"an important and authoritative work for orchid growers,\" while Swinson goes into further detail about the monumentality of the undertaking: \"By modern standards the work was of monstrous size. . . . Where the orchid was concerned, Sander never spared himself, but even so, the care lavished on the Reichenbachia still provokes astonishment. Apart from the elegance of Moon's drawings, the technical standards would have been a tribute to any large printing house. The blocks were hand-made, out of wood; and the chromolithographs were produced by the use of as many as twenty inks. The cost to Sander was enormous, and it is said to have been well over £7,000 [about £850,000 today]. . . . It is no wonder that Sander often remarked in later years that the project almost ruined him.\" Although Sander is considered the \"author\" here, most of the descriptions for this work were provided by the eponymous Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach (1824-89), considered to be the greatest orchid taxonomist of his day and the possessor of one of the finest herbariums in Europe. Reichenbach died before the publication was finished, leaving the project to be finished by Sander and his chief artist, H. G. Moon. The \"Reichenbachia\" was delivered to subscribers in monthly parts and took seven years to complete due in large part to the meticulous level of detail involved, including hand finishing of many of the chromolithographs; the resulting effect sets it apart as one of the finest botanical productions of the period. There was also an Imperial Edition of this work printed at the same time, limited to 100 copies; it was signed by Sander and the plates mounted on oversized sheets, but it is otherwise identical to the present edition. The beauty of the plates here also means that this is a work often found disbound and broken up. Our copy is complete, save for a single leaf of text, and is also advantageously priced in comparison to the Imperial Edition, which fetches substantially more.\n\n4 volumes in 8, large folio.

Contemporary full morocco gilt Provenance: John Pierpont Morgan (morocco booklabel) Very rare deluxe Imperial Edition on card of this truly imposing and authoritative work on orchids illustrated with life-size plates: Sander's great monument and one of the greatest of all flower books, this copy from the library of J. P. Morgan. It was named in honour of Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach (1824-1889), ornithologist, botanist and celebrated orchidologist. After a lifetime largely devoted to Orchids, Reichenbach's death during the publication of the present work caused controversy when it was revealed that he had left his herbarium and library to the natural history museum in Vienna, on the condition that the preserved orchids and orchid drawings were not to be consulted for 25 years after his death. Born in Bremen in 1865, Sander came to Britain in 1847 and worked in nurseries in Forest Hill. He had started his own independent business by 1874 and opened the famous St. Albans establishment in 1881. The firm was later expanded with establishments in both America and Belgium. The present work covers the period when the firm was at its most active: a contemporary work notes that in the spring of 1894 Sander's had twenty orchid collectors working simultaneously in Brazil, Columbia, Peru Ecuador, Mexico, Madagascar, New Guinea, Burma and Malaya. (see Hon. Mrs. Evelyn Cecil, A History of Gardening in England, 1910, pp. 281-282.) In the introduction Sander explains that \"the growing popularity of Orchids, and the ever-increasing demand for information respecting them, is sufficient reason for issuing the present work. It will be our aim to represent truthfully the natural aspect of the plants, which will be drawn life size.Some of the plant portraits will be coloured by lithography, others will be hand painted when found expedient.It is our intention to illustrate all classes of the Orchid family.\" The majority of the plates are from originals by Moon, and most are orientated vertically (165 portrait plates) as opposed to horizontally (26 landscape plates). Henry George Moon (1857-1905), born in London, spent much of his career working for William Robinson at The Garden and later at Flora and Sylva. \"His most celebrated illustrations were made for Frederick Sander's great orchid book Reichenbachia.[His] drawings were intended to help the gardener determine what effect plants would have in cultivation, rather than to help the botanist in identification. His work had a great impact on British plant drawing in the early twentieth century; artists such as E.A. Bowles, Dorothy Martin, and Lillian Snelling in her early days all show his influence.\" (B. Elliott, Treasures of the Royal Horticultural Society, 1994, p. 114.) \"By modern standards the work was of a monstrous size.the care lavished on Reichenbachia still provokes astonishment. Apart from the elegance of Moon's drawings, the technical standards would have been a tribute to any large printing house. The blocks were hand-made, out of wood; and the chromolithographs were produced by the use of as many as twenty inks. The cost to Sander was enormous.It is no wonder that Sander often remarked in later years that the project almost ruined him\" (A.

Leutzsch and J.L. Macfarlane after Henry Moon, W.H. Fitch, A.H. Loch and C. Storer, heightened with gum arabic, wood-engraved illustrations in the text (one plate adhered to original tissue guard, some other plates affected in one or two places where gum arabic has previously adhered to the tissue guard).

FIRST EDITION, BOUND FROM THE ORIGINAL MONTHLY PARTS, OF THIS \"IMPORTANT AND AUTHORITATIVE WORK FOR ORCHID GROWERS\" (Great Flower Books). Sander named this superb book of life-sized, vibrantly coloured images of orchids after Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach (1824-1889), the celebrated botanist who was renowned for his collection and study of orchids. Tragically Reichenbach died before publication of the original parts was complete, and he did not go quietly. Dying at the height of orchid mania Reichenbach bequeathed in his will his entire herbarium and library to the natural history museum in Vienna, on the condition that the preserved orchids and orchid drawings in his collection were not to be consulted for 25 years after his death. So adamant was he on this point, that his will states that should Vienna refuse the collection that a short list of subsequent institutions must comply with the same condition. So a generation of orchidologists was denied all the opportunities that studying Reichenbach's lifetime's achievements should have provided. Sander, originally from Germany founded an extremely successful horticultural business Sander & Co, specialising in orchids in St. Albans in 1881, \"which would become the most important nineteenth century orchid nursery in England. Sander was joined by his sons and the company was known by several names, the most frequent being Sander & Sons. At its peak it employed some twenty orchid collectors in South and Central America, New Guinea, Myanmar and Malaysia, and opened branches of the firm in the United States and Belgium. The cost was enormous and Sander later remarked that the project almost ruined him. Most of the plates were prepared by H.G. Moon (1857-1905), who would later marry Sander's daughter. Euanthe sanderiana (Rchb. f.) Schltr. is one of many orchids named in Sander's honour and the eponymous Calathea sanderiana (Sander) Gentil was originally published in the commercial catalogue (1894) of Sander & Co. as Maranta sanderiana Sander. Faced with the problem of rapidly growing numbers of names for orchid hybrids, chaotic usage and lack of standards, the company was innovative in introducing an international registration system for grex nomenclature in 1895, one of the earliest such nomenclatural standards in the world. From 1961 the system was transferred to the Royal Horticultural Society and managed as The International Orchid Register, containing over 100,000 grex names. The company sent specimens of cultivated or wild-collected plants to BM and K over many years, for identification or as voucher specimens, and numerous live plants went to Kew (1880-1910)\" (Natural History Museum online).\n\nCouverture rigide.

Ce dernier consacra une grande partie de sa vie au culte des orchidées et sa mort survint durant la publication de ce présent ouvrage. Sander se forma à la culture des orchidées dans les nurseries de Forest Hill. Un ouvrage contemporain mentionne ainsi qu'en 1894 Sander avait sous ses ordres 20 collecteurs qui exploraient simultanément le Brésil, la Colombie, le Pérou, l'Equateur, le Mexique, Madagascar, la Nouvelle Guinée? Il explique dans sa préface son souci de représenter toutes les classes d'orchidées en les replaçant dans leur aspect naturel et en respectant leurs dimensions.

The edition, dédicated to her Majesty Maria Feodorouna, Empress of Russia, was printed in only 100 copies, all signed by Sander. This glorious treatise praising the beauty of orchids bear the name of Reichenbach in honor of Heinrich Gustav Reichenbak (1824-1889), a botanist and a famous orchidologist. The latter dedicated a great part of his life to the cult of orchids and his death happened during the publication of the present work. Sander trained to the culture of orchids in the Forest Hill's nursery. A contemporary work mentions that in 1894 Sander had under his orders 200 collectors who were simultaneously exploring Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Mexico, Madagascar, New Guinea? He explains in his forward his care to represent all the classes of orchids by replacing them in their natural aspect and by respecting their dimensions. The text in English, French and German retraces both the historical and the conditions of culture of each orchid. The iconography of great beauty includes 192 fines chromolithographs, most of them hand-retouched, mounted on strong cardboard, by Joseph Mansell, G. and J.L. Macfarlane after Henry Moon, W.H. Fitch, A.H. Loch and C. Storer. \"His most famous drawings were executed for the great book of Orchids by Sander? It was supposed to enable gardeners to perceive the natural effect of each plant replaced in its habitat, more than helping the botanist in their identification.\" \"His work had a great impact on British plant drawing in the early twentieth century\".
