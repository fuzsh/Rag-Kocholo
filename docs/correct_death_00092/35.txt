Town of Reichenbach

Reichenbach:

The name Reichenbach could indicate according to the "Historical Settlement Name Book of the Palatinate" by Martin Dolch and Albrecht Greule on a place in water-rich area.

Reichenbach had a great importance in Roman times. Witness is the mighty tower of the Protestant church, which was formerly integrated into a diverse defense system. This also includes the so-called "Burgweg", which came from the north of the Reichenbacher district coming on the Roman road to Donnersberg.

It is not beyond doubt whether Celtic or Roman manuscript stands behind the fortification. It is certain that this place with its hill around today's church square was an important place at all times.

Otto I, the son of Ludwig II, who got the Nahegau as inheritance from the empire of Charlemagne, gave 945 Reichenbach ago. The vassal Franko received in his forest "Lutara" six royal hooves (these are the smallest peasant property). These were partly well-managed royal farms. The king witnessed his donation with his handwritten signature.

Over time, the village went over again in new ownership. Around 1291, the Counts of Veldenz owned the lands, which included Reichenbach. Reichenbach becomes a sub-office in the Landvogtei in Speyergau.

Reichenbach was already since 1346 a Schultheißerei, that is, there was a court with a mayor, several lawyers and a court clerk.

Between 1794 and 1803 the "Reichenbacher court" was constricted under the strict rule of the French. Only the Napoleonic "Code civil" brought a new order.

1817 came the "Reichenbacher office" under the supremacy of Bavaria. Rheinbayern or the Rhine district experienced a complete reorganization of the state apparatus. In the place of the nobles came a new civil servant status, which was subject only to the state. [6]
