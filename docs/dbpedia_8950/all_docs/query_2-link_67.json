        "text": "Workers at an Alabama electric bus plant have unionized and inked a contract with significant pay raises, another win for the US labor movement in the emerging green economy and the union-scarce South.\n\nThe roughly 600 workers at the New Flyer factory formed a union with the Communications Workers of America earlier this year, joining a string of US organizing victories at its parent NFI Group Inc., North America’s biggest manufacturer of transit buses. The contract, ratified this week, will raise most employees’ pay by 25% to 38% by 2026, according to CWA. The contract also restricts forced overtime and expands paid time off to include more parental leave and a Juneteenth holiday."
