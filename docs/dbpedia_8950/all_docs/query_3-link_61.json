        "text": "Welcome Aboard the Fleet of the Future (Gen2 BART cars)\n\nBienvenido a bordo de los Trenes del Futuro\n\n​​​​歡迎登上未來車隊「Fleet of the Future」\n\nNew Train Car Delivery Update (as of 07/23/24):\n\nCars ReceivedCertifiedIn Service775769400\n\nOn September 11, 2023, BART began to run only new cars for the base schedule, marking a historic moment for the new fleet. All 55 trains in service are made up of new cars.\n\nOn March 4, 2024, BART removed the last of the legacy cars from the Ready Reserve Fleet.\n\nThe Fleet of the Future project is coming in hundreds of millions of dollars under budget thanks to tight project management. Get more details here.\n\nProject Manager John Garnham joined our \"Hidden Tracks: Stories from BART\" podcast to share all kinds of insider nuggets about the new train cars including what BART is doing to respond to challenges posed by wheel flats. Listen to the podcast.\n\nA New Era Begins\n\nThe first of 775 new BART train cars went into service January 2018 and are ready to take you on a quieter, cooler, and more comfortable ride. The new cars will help relieve crowding on the BART system. Here are some tips to help you navigate the Fleet of the Future.\n\nIs that my train? Exterior digital signs on the side and front of the train show the train destination and line color.\n\nWhere to hold? Can’t reach the overhead bars? Try an overhead strap, or a vertical pole near any end door.\n\nWhere am I? See digital display near door for next stop and map with “You Are Here” bubble, glance at LED sign at end of car, or listen for announcement.\n\nPriority seats? Notice the green priority seats on your left as you enter the train. Please yield to people with disabilities, seniors, and pregnant women.\n\nWhere's the hearing loop? The center of each car has a ­hearing loop system for riders who use ­hearing aids or cochlear implants. Consult your audiologist for optimal device settings.\n\nLuggage? Put carry-ons under the new, higher seats, keep larger luggage close to you, and please don’t forget them when you exit.\n\nSustainable? Aluminum bodies are lightweight, energy efficient, and recyclable. LED lights and regenerative brakes help save energy too.\n\nAre you prepared? Find evacuation info posted at the ends of each car, emergency features shown with red signs, intercoms near each door area, and security cameras throughout.\n\nAccessibility Tips for the Fleet of the Future\n\nTrain Destination\n\nAs the train pulls in, you may notice digital signs on the side and front of the train. These signs use high contrast amber text to show the train destination, and a blue, red, orange, ­yellow, or green block of color to indicate the route of the train—using the same colors as the BART system map. BART will also continue to ­display train destinations on the ­electronic signs above the platform and via audio announcements.\n\nNavigating the System\n\nOnce on-board, check out the digital screen next to each side door. It has a dynamic system map and a “You Are Here” bubble that shows your train’s current position. The right-hand side of the screen shows next stop information and customer service messages. You may also see next stop information on an overhead digital sign at the end of the car, or hear it via new automated ­announcements.\n\nMore Priority Seats\n\nNotice the green priority seats on your left as you enter the train. BART asks passengers to yield these seats to people with disabilities, seniors, and those who are pregnant. With the addition of the third door, the new trains have approximately 50% more priority seating.\n\nMore Doors\n\nNew trains have 50% more doors for easier boarding and ­exiting. Decals on the train exterior mark doors that have ­wheelchair areas, ­multi-purpose space, and bike areas. Note that the location of the first and third door on each car will align with existing black tiles or door markers on the platform and middle door markers are being added, which are the locations with extra area for passengers with wheelchairs.\n\nTactile Directional Bars\n\nBlind or low vision customers may continue to use existing “directional bars” at the ­center of the platform to identify a boarding location. At these locations, blind or low vision ­customers can board the first or third door of the new cars. (Middle door locations do not yet have directional bars. BART plans to seek input from the BART Accessibility Task Force on how best to mark these additional locations for blind customers at a future date when all the train cars have a middle door.) When boarding, turn left for the priority seats or grab the floor-to-ceiling pole that is straight ahead.\n\nTraveling Together\n\nThe two wheelchair areas in each car are both located near the middle door to make it easier for passengers who use wheelchairs to travel together. Note that there are no ­floor-to-ceiling poles in this area to provide maximum accessibility for customers who use wheelchairs. Wheelchair areas are marked on the floor with the international disability ­symbol.\n\nDifferent Riders, Different Needs\n\nBART knows that different riders have different needs. Seat back ­handles and vertical poles help riders stand up or lower themselves into the new, higher seats. These new seats have more room underneath for service animals or carry-on luggage. Overhead straps are available to support standing passengers. And ­vertical bars and floor-to-ceiling poles provide a place to hold on to as the train starts or stops for passengers who are unable to reach ­overhead straps.\n\nAssisted Listening Hearing Loop\n\nThe center area of each car has a hearing loop system (indicated by a decal on the train interior) for riders who use hearing aids or cochlear implants. The range of this system covers approximately the center 1/3 of the train car. This system is one of the first of its kind in a moving public transit vehicle. Please consult your audiologist for optimal device ­settings.\n\nEmergency Information\n\nEvacuation information is posted at the ends of each car. In the event of an evacuation, the train operator will make an announcement and information may also ­appear on the digital displays. Emergency features, located throughout the car, are ­indicated by red signs that can glow in the dark. Please note the location of emergency features such as fire extinguishers and ladders near car ends, and manual door release ­handles and intercoms near each door area.\n\nDigital cameras, onboard all cars, help deter crime, but alert riders are always the best ­defense. Please report any suspicious packages or activity to BART Police: (510) 464-7000 or through the BART Watch app available for your mobile device.\n\nBike Space\n\nThere are two bike areas on each new Fleet of the Future train car, the same as on BART’s older legacy cars. Each bike area has a horizontal leaning bar and strap that bicyclists can use to stabilize their bikes. BART selected this leaning bar option instead of bike racks based on bicyclist preference in the survey.\n\nThe bike space will also accommodate more standing passengers, luggage, and strollers when not used by bikes. A decal on the wall notes it is a bike priority area.\n\nMeet the Fleet: An In-depth Look at New Car Features\n\nCheck out recent articles on the Fleet of the Future:\n\nNew BART wheel tech shushes screeching rails\n\nOnsite testing begins for BART’s first new train car\n\nMeet the Fleet: BART's new car arrives\n\nMeet the Fleet: Three doors on new train cars to reduce noise, improve reliability, increase capacity\n\nMeet the Fleet: Passenger information systems get a big upgrade on new trains\n\nMeet the Fleet: Improved climate control highly anticipated on new trains\n\nMeet the Fleet: Behind the scenes, BART's new train cars undergo extensive testing for safety, reliability\n\nMeet the Fleet: New train car gets ready to head West\n\nMeet the Fleet: All about the seats, a firsthand report\n\nFor more information, click on a topic you'd like to read more about:\n\nPDF Brochures\n\nAccessibility | Sustainability"
