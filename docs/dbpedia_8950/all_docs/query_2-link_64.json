        "text": "Welcome to MILANO, the new compact car that brings Alfa Romeo sportiness back into the largest segment in the European market. A symbolic ‘welcome back’ to fans of the Giulietta and Mito, and a warm welcome to a new generation of Alfisti enthusiasts.\n\nMILANO redefines the canons of beauty in the segment. Italian design by the Alfa Romeo Centro Stile (Turin): emotional connection at first sight, based on a reinterpretation of the brand’s typical stylistic features.\n\nBest-in-class driving dynamics. MILANO brings Alfa Romeo's typical driving pleasure to the compact segment, by means of specific technical solutions resulting from a development process coordinated by the same team that designed the Giulia GTA.\n\nSegment-leading comfort and practicality, as shown by the largest trunk among premium bev competitors (400 L), and the Alfa Romeo Cable Organizer solution.\n\nMILANO is “ELETTRICA”, with a 54-kWh battery, available in two power variants: 156 hp, and the top-of-the-range VELOCE at 240 hp.\n\nMILANO ELETTRICA offers over 410 km of range, courtesy of the excellent aerodynamic performance from the ‘truncated tail’ design and the lowest weight among premium compact cars.\n\nMILANO VELOCE is the epitome of Alfa Romeo sportiness: mechanical self-locking differential, the most direct steering ratio in its class, widened wheel track with specific front and rear anti-roll bars, sports suspension and braking system, 20-inch wheel rims.\n\nMILANO is “IBRIDA,” with 136-hp 48-V Hybrid VGT (Variable Geometry Turbo), the only car in the premium compact class to also offer the Q4 all-wheel drive variant with automated rear-wheel drive axle management.\n\nOrders are now open for the “MILANO SPECIALE” launch edition, available in both electric and hybrid versions, with the exclusive “Ready to drive, Anywhere, Anytime” commercial offer.\n\n“Ready to drive, Anywhere, Anytime,” the electric car the Alfa Romeo way: reassuring and simple, it supports the customer in their everyday driving experience. MILANO ELETTRICA is equipped with an exclusive connected navigation system (EV Routing) for access to over 600,000 charging stations, the largest charging network in Europe, the exclusive Free2move charge E-Card, and a wallbox as standard.\n\nSporty at heart, compact in size and Italian style at first sight. The wait is over. Alfa Romeo presents the new MILANO to the international press right in Milan, at the historic headquarters of the Automobile Club Milano, in an unconventional way and with a dual purpose: on the one hand, to demonstrate Alfa Romeo’s new language; on the other, to confirm that visceral and proud partnership with the city where Alfa Romeo was founded in 1910 as an emblem of the perfect balance between innovation and tradition, founding characteristics that bind the brand to its hometown.\n\nOrders are now open for MILANO in the “SPECIALE” launch version, the new gateway to the Alfa Romeo world for everyone, Alfisti fans and beyond, who has been awaiting the brand's return to the segment. To play a leading role, Alfa Romeo offers the sportiest and most exciting compact car to drive in the entire class, the only one that can enter into conversation with enthusiasts for the Giulietta and Mito and attract a new generation of Alfisti fans.\n\nMILANO is inclusive and offers everyone the opportunity to access a distinctive and attractive car. Its mission is to win over a new generation, through a new design language. Remaining steadfast is its innate aptitude for sportiness, a trait that has animated Alfa Romeo since 1910, with ‘sportiness’ intended as an engaging driving experience in everyday life.\n\nIn a segment populated by sporty versions derived from generalist models, MILANO is proposed as a cool and unique object, combining a captivating style with the most advanced technology in terms of comfort, connectivity, and driving dynamics. Uncompromising comfort, as evidenced by the largest trunk among premium competitors (400 L). MILANO is also available in hybrid and electric, without distinctions in terms of aesthetics or equipment, because the only thing that matters is the fact it is 100% Alfa Romeo.\n\nMILANO is available in “IBRIDA” configuration, the first in the segment to also offer the Q4 all-wheel drive variant with automated rear-wheel drive axle management, and as “ELETTRICA,” in two power variants with 156 hp and a range of up to 410 km, as well as the sportier 240-hp VELOCE, the epitome of Alfa Romeo's sporting DNA. The design evolves in the distinctive features that create an immediate emotional connection. After all, an Alfa Romeo has always been aimed at those looking for a car not only to be a ‘means of transport,’ rather for a symbiosis, a bond that can bring out ‘authentic emotions.’\n\nDestined to profoundly change the concept of sportiness in the largest segment in Europe, the new MILANO is based on the precise desire to produce a compact car, just over 4 meters long, with an all-new, up-to-date sporting spirit, which goes beyond performance alone and is taken ahead towards a distinctly Alfa Romeo and ideally sporty positioning. Of course, this is a bold and ambitious goal, only authoritatively achievable by a brand with over a century of sporting history, forged on racetracks and on everyday roads. In a nutshell, MILANO is a sort of ‘handbook’ for an Italian brand devoted to the satisfaction of the sensory faculties, because the car is and remains an exciting product to be experienced with passion and involvement.\n\nEXTERIOR DESIGN\n\nThe Alfa Romeo Centro Stile redefines the canons of design in the segment\n\nAn Alfa Romeo is based on the perfect balance between functional beauty and an unparalleled heritage, making it the epitome of Italian style in the automotive field. The new MILANO is definitely no exception, as its compact dimensions – a length of 4.17 meters, width of 1.78 m and height of 1.5 m – encompass the uniqueness of the Alfa Romeo Centro Stile's original and modern Made in Italy design, typical of the brand, expressed in balance of proportions, purity of lines and attention to the quality of the surfaces. Alfa Romeo's stylists have modeled this 'skin’ with artisanal care on the mechanical parts, completely detaching themselves from the concepts of cold rationality in vogue in the class, to breathe life into a sinuous and exciting design that catches the eye at first sight. This creates a genuine emotional connection between the driver and the car, even going as far as resulting in a strong desire to caress it. The proportions are set out with stylistic features relating to tradition, such as the limited overhangs, the muscular wheel arches, and the iconic ‘truncated tail,’ a reference to the legendary Giulia TZ. The ‘simplicity’ of Italian style, especially Alfa Romeo's, conceals one of the most complex creative processes in the industry: car design. Alfa Romeo MILANO boasts a strong identity, made up of a limited number of features that include the legendary shield, in the Leggenda and Progresso variants, perhaps the most famous and recognizable signature in the automotive world. A contribution is made to its powerful personality by the bold ‘look’ of the front, with ‘3+3’ and adaptive Full LED Matrix headlights. Finally, the Alfa Romeo style is characterized by the quality of the surfaces, which create rich and harmonious reflections through distinct volumetric contrasts.\n\nINTERIOR DESIGN\n\n‘Driver-oriented’ for an authentic and engaging driving experience.\n\nThe same inspiration of pure sportiness can be found inside the car, where the standout features are the Italian attention to every detail, the use of the finest materials and the placement of all the controls within the driver’s reach, as demonstrated by the compact steering wheel, to adapt to all driving styles. Most of all, the instrument panel and its historical ‘telescope’ design creates that direct visual connection and persuades you to wrap your hands around the steering wheel, start the engine, and make the best of a unique driving experience. In the middle of the cluster, the standout feature is a fully digital 10.25” TFT screen, to access the car’s data and the settings for the driving technologies. In the middle of the dashboard and oriented towards the driver, a 10.25” touchscreen system developed to work with widgets, graphic components designed for intuitive interaction with all the features, which can be customized via quick and easy drag and drop. Every user can create their own homepage, where each of the car’s features is an app in itself. To further embellish the interior, the air conditioning vents in the shape of a quadrifoglio (four-leaf clover), the symbol par excellence of Alfa Romeo sportiness. Finally, to catch the eye and welcome the driver, Sabelt sports seats featuring an enveloping backrest that combines high mechanical resistance, perfect ergonomics and structural lightness.\n\nCOMFORT & SAFETY\n\nMILANO comes in at the top of its class. The most spacious trunk in the segment.\n\nIncludes Level 2 autonomous driving.\n\nChoosing MILANO equates to an unwillingness to compromise between solutions based on the centrality of the person sitting in the driver’s seat and on the utmost well-being of all the passengers. According to Alfa Romeo, comfort means making every travel experience simple, extremely pleasant, organized, and safe. And that’s why, when getting into the passenger compartment, you immediately perceive the meticulous attention to detail, the high quality of the upholstery, and the enveloping feeling of being in your comfort zone, with a sporty nature and distinctly Italian quality. Despite its compact size, MILANO boasts the largest trunk in its class (BEV) with a load capacity of as much as 400 liters, accessible using handsfree technology. MILANO also comes with exclusive features such as the convenient “Alfa Romeo cable organizer” storage compartment located under the bonnet, as a handy place to store the charging cable. To increase the comfort even further, MILANO offers a series of driver assistance features, to help with the longitudinal and lateral control of the vehicle (level 2 autonomous driving). Together with the 360° parking sensors, the 180° rear camera monitors the surrounding area, for an innovative and practical semi-autonomous parking system.\n\nFinally, MILANO can also include proximity access technology, to open and close your car quickly and easily by coming closer to or moving away from the vehicle, with no need for the customer to take any action.\n\nDRIVING DYNAMICS\n\nMILANO delivers best-in-class driving dynamics.\n\nBuilding on the lowest weight in the segment and optimal mass distribution, MILANO enters the world of electric cars like a true Alfa Romeo. The team that coordinated the development of the driving dynamics is the same one that developed the Giulia GTA at the Balocco testing center in Vercelli province, with the clear aim of the new MILANO achieving best-in-class road holding, made possible by specific technical solutions: it has the most direct steering in the segment (14.6), specially calibrated to be extremely precise, to enhance its exceptional road holding qualities; in the VELOCE version, the sports suspension has been lowered by 25 mm; the front and rear anti-roll bars are extra sporty to guarantee quick cornering with a high level of grip; the braking system has front discs of over 380 mm with four-piston monobloc calipers; the Torsen differential offers the best possible traction in all conditions. The high-performance 20” tires are also specific to electric vehicles and offer extensive levels of grip. All this forms the basis of a one-of-a-kind compact car with a pure, recognizably Alfa Romeo sportiness.\n\nThe MILANO can also include the Alfa D.N.A. system. “Dynamic” mode, partly made possible by specific steering and accelerator calibration, offers the utmost performance and driving pleasure. In a careful balance between performance and comfort, “Natural” model is designed for everyday use, while “Advanced Efficiency” is calibrated for maximum energy efficiency by reducing consumption without affecting driving pleasure. Finally, on the Q4 hybrid version only, a fourth mode known as Q4, for low-grip conditions.\n\nCONNECTIVITY\n\nEV ROUTING: Connected Navigation\n\nAlfa Romeo interprets the use of software and connectivity to enhance the driver's experience, which is and remains the focus. MILANO therefore comes with the most advanced connected technology, to ensure maximum comfort. EV Routing is an innovative connected system built into the navigator that manages the customer's charging needs, automatically and stress-free. All customers need to do is set up their destination, then the navigation system automatically calculates any charging stops needed along the route, with access provided to over 600,000 charge points, the most extensive network in Europe, made possible by Free2Move charge. Real-time traffic, battery and driving style monitoring makes it possible to rely on EV Routing for a driving experience free from charging anxiety.\n\nAlfa Connect Services, the suite of connected services.\n\nAlfa Romeo MILANO is equipped with “Alfa Connect Services,” the tool that offers advanced onboard connectivity and a range of services for maximum safety and comfort. Thanks to over-the-air (OTA) technology, the car's maps and software are always kept up to date. The various functions that make the onboard experience the best ever include “My Navigation,” consisting of apps to remotely search for destinations and points of interest (PoI), as well as real-time alerts on traffic, weather and speedcams. Via the My Alfa Connect smartphone app, customers can also interact with the car using “My Remote,” with various services such as: remote control of the car’s functions (opening/closing doors or flashing the lights) via smartphone or smartwatch; vehicle location; control of certain parameters (speed and area) and notifications if these are not respected. E-Control also offers the option to remotely manage start-up and stopping, to schedule charging, or if necessary, to heat or cool the interior before getting into the vehicle.\n\nAnother major innovation is the integration of the Hey Alfa virtual assistant and ChatGPT (A.I.) which use voice recognition to give you a useful, discreet ‘copilot’ on your travels, for information, advice and to meet all the driver’s needs.\n\nMILANO ELETTRICA\n\nA new concept of sportiness.\n\nIn the electric version of the MILANO, Alfa Romeo has selected a new-generation power source, combining an electric motor (“Hybrid Synchronous Motor”) and a latest-generation battery. With its high power, torque, and specific calibration of the electric powertrain, the new compact sports car offers uncompromising driving pleasure with segment-leading dynamics. Available in two power versions, 156 or 240 hp, the new car ensures excellent performance and an engaging and sporty drive, like every Alfa Romeo. The 54-kWh battery offers high energy density and a very good ratio of rated to usable energy. Specifically, in the 156-hp version the lithium-ion battery pack provides 410 km of range in the WLTP cycle, or 590 km in the urban cycle. Charging up the new MILANO is very straightforward: at 100-kW DC fast charging stations, it takes less than 30 minutes to charge the batteries from 10 to 80%.\n\nMILANO IBRIDA\n\nthe emotions of electric mobility with no need for charging\n\nThe new MILANO offers two traction solutions for the Ibrida version: front-wheel drive or Q4 all-wheel drive, a first in the premium segment, which will be available at a later stage.\n\nMILANO IBRIDA adopts a 136-hp 48-V Hybrid VGT (Variable-Geometry Turbo) architecture.
