The country registered approximately 524,219 new fully electric cars, an 11.4% increase from 2022, but a slowdown from the previous year‚Äôs one-third growth rate. This trend aligns with the gradual phasing out of state support for electric vehicles, according to specialist publication Electrive. The reduction of buyer‚Äôs premium in early 2023 and the subsequent elimination of electric company car support significantly impacted new registrations. #autoindustrytrends #automotivecompetition #CO2emissions #electriccargrowth #electricvehicles #Germancarbrands #Germanyautomotivemarket #hybridcars #SUVpopularity #vehicleregistrations Follow F&L Asia Ltd. for more industry updates here: https://lnkd.in/fGDzetn Subscribe here: https://lnkd.in/g2PczSmRe\n\nAs EV technology continues to evolve and become more integrated into daily life, prices are beginning to stabilise, making them more accessible to a broader range of consumers. This trend is bolstered by governmental policies aimed at promoting cleaner transportation options, including subsidies and tax incentives that make EVs more financially attractive. The increase in EV sales not only reflects changing consumer preferences but also a larger shift towards sustainability in response to environmental concerns. As infrastructure for electric vehicles improves, including more widespread and efficient charging stations, the adoption of EVs is expected to continue growing across Australia.
