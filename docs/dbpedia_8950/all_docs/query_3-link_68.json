        "text": "Deciding whether to buy a new or used car comes down to many factors and is a very personal decision based on an individual's finances and needs. Some important factors to consider include the cost, available financing deals, current interest rates, depreciation, insurance costs, and mileage. Below, we discuss some of the advantages and disadvantages of buying new or used cars to help you decide.\n\nAdvantages of Buying a New Car\n\nThere’s no denying the curb appeal of a brand-new car, from that new-car smell to the shiny paint, the clean interior, and the “oohs” and “aahs” when your friends see it for the first time. In our consumer culture, a new car is an undeniable status symbol that lets the world know you’ve arrived (literally). Cosmetics aside, a new car also has some other advantages.\n\nReliability and warranty protection. Most new cars have good reliability records, and if anything goes wrong, it’s probably covered by the manufacturer’s warranty. Buying new also means you don’t need to be concerned about how the vehicle was treated before you bought it.\n\nFree roadside assistance. Many new cars come with roadside assistance. This can save you the cost of paying for coverage on your own or being stuck with a towing bill if your car breaks down.\n\nThe latest features. New cars will likely meet the latest fuel efficiency standards and have the most up-to-date safety features.\n\nAttractive financing deals. Many carmakers and dealers offer financing programs with low or no interest if you have good credit. That can make it less expensive to finance a new car than a used one.\n\nDisadvantages of Buying a New Car\n\nOf course, new cars also have a few things going against them.\n\nExpensive to buy. Buying a new car is hard on the wallet. If you’re using an auto loan to finance the purchase, you’ll most likely borrow more than you would with a used car and end up paying more interest over time.\n\nQuick to depreciate. New cars depreciate more quickly than their used counterparts. A vehicle loses the most value in the first few years of ownership—and a huge chunk of that in its first few seconds off the lot. By some estimates, the instant loss can be 10% of the car’s value. That’s because when you purchase a new car from a dealer, you pay the retail price. As soon as you’re off the lot, the car is only worth its lower, wholesale price. This is the amount that the dealer would be willing to pay if you turned around and tried to sell it back.\n\nCostlier to insure. New cars also have higher auto insurance costs than used models because their replacement values are higher.\n\nNot new forever. Finally, new cars don’t stay new for long. You’ll get your first scratch or nick in a day, a week, or a month. By the end of the first year, the floor may be stained, the doors dinged, and that sweet new-car smell will be just a memory. Of course, the monthly payments will linger for years.\n\nAdvantages of Buying a Used Car\n\n“Pre-owned vehicles,” to use the marketing jargon for used cars, may lack the mystique of new cars. But they have some advantages.\n\nLower prices. By the time a vehicle comes on the used-car market, much of its depreciation has already happened (and has been paid for by the prior owner). So, buying used is an opportunity to get more car for your money.\n\nWarranties available. Some vehicles now come with warranties that cover the most expensive components of a car’s drivetrain for 200,000 miles. If you buy a certified pre-owned car from a dealer, then you’re likely to get a warranty that extends the manufacturer’s original warranty. (Certified pre-owned cars tend to be more expensive than other used cars, but they also have been rigorously inspected and spruced up, as needed.) Of course, if you’re handy with a wrench, then buying a car that needs a little time and attention can dramatically reduce your cost.\n\nCheaper to insure. While a dealership may require full insurance coverage for a new vehicle you’re financing, you may be able to spend less on insurance if you’re paying cash for a used car.\n\nDisadvantages of Buying a Used Car\n\nWhether or not they’re under warranty, used cars still come with some potentially pricey unknowns. Because you don’t know how the last owner treated the car or why it was traded in, there is always the danger of buying somebody else’s problems.\n\nHigher mileage. A used car is likely to have higher mileage, which can reduce its lifespan. If you buy a higher-mileage car, you may need to replace it sooner rather than later, which can add to your vehicle-buying costs.\n\nLimited selection. It can be challenging to find a used vehicle with the exact options and features that you want.\n\nFewer consumer protections. If you’ve purchased a lemon, you may have less recourse than you would with a new car because lemon laws often apply only to vehicles under a certain age and with less than a particular number of miles on the odometer.\n\nShould You Buy a New or Used Car?\n\nWhen considering whether to buy a new or used vehicle, consider both the up-front price and the ongoing costs. Some of the things that you may be responsible for paying with a new or used car include:\n\nDown payment\n\nTaxes, title, and fees at closing\n\nProperty tax\n\nCar insurance\n\nMaintenance\n\nRepairs\n\nGas and oil\n\nInterest\n\nA new car may cost you less in terms of repairs, at least for the first few years. By the time the vehicle starts to need major repairs and upkeep, you may be ready to trade it in. If you pay cash, a used car may cost you more for maintenance but less in interest charges on a loan. So, consider all the variables when calculating the cost of buying a new car versus a used one.\n\nAnd remember that whether to buy a new or used vehicle isn’t entirely a financial decision. While used cars tend to be cheaper—at least initially—you may not be able to get all the features you want without making some compromises. Unless you’re in a hurry to buy, it can pay to look at both. See what’s available on the used lot as well as in the new-car showroom, compare the price differential, and ask yourself which option you, and your finances, would be most comfortable with down the road.\n\nThe current interest rate environment will also be a factor in determining whether you should buy a new or used car. In general, when interest rates are high, buying a new car costs more if you finance part of the cost because you pay more interest. When interest rates are lower, a car costs less.\n\nIn general, new cars have lower interest rates on loans while used cars have higher rates; however, used cars also cost less. Additionally, because new cars have a higher principal, the loan term is usually longer than for a used car, so doing the math to figure out what the actual cost would be in the end between the two is crucial to decide.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhether or not you should buy a new or used car will depend on various factors. Set aside time to determine what's right for you and do the research to ensure you're picking the best option and cost for your budget and needs."
