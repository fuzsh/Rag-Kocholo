        "text": "Ann M. Fagan is a dedicated automobile hobbyist with over a half century of experience in collection acquisition and management. Ann's early addiction to automobiles started in her childhood neighborhood when she would ask her parents \"what was that?\" -as a Citroen or a Mercedes SL sped past. Neither parent could answer, and this ultimately led to her learning about many makes and models by washing the most interesting cars within her neighborhood. The highlight of this childhood passion was the discovery of both a 1954 Rolls Royce Silver Dawn and a 1959 Mercedes-Benz Adenauer 300d. Ann’s first automotive acquisitions in high school included a Chevrolet Malibu and Nova Chevy II. Those two cherished vehicles were traded up in college for a Datsun 280Z and shortly thereafter for a Mercedes-Benz 380SL. The addiction was clearly ignited early!\n\nToday, Ann’s automobile club affiliations include the Antique Automobile Club of America (AACA), BMW Car Club of America (BMWCCA), BMW Classic Car Club of America (BMWCCCA), Datsun Z Club of America (CTZCC), Gull Wing Group International (GWG), Hagerty Drivers Club, Jaguar Clubs of North America, Inc. (JCNA), Mercedes Benz Club of America (MBCA), National Corvette Restorers Society (NCRS), Pogoda SL Group, Porsche Club of America (PCA), Vintage Sports Car Club of America (VSCCA),Volvo Sports America (VSA), and others. Prior memberships and ownership included Ferrari Club of America (FCA) and Metropolitan Owner's Club of North America (MOCNA). She is currently and has been a Silver Arrow Member of the Saratoga Automobile Museum for several years. Ann served two consecutive terms on the Board of Directors of the GWG and she is presently President of the East Coast Chapter of the organization. Ann enjoys participating in multiple rallies, concours events, and tours throughout the year. Notably, she has driven in every 300SL Classic rally since inception. Recently, Ann drove the New England 1000 in her 1973 BMW 3.0Cs. Although her collection has been as described as eclectic, Ann’s collection currently emphasizes German marques.\n\nDream Ride is Happening, In a new Modified Version\n\nDear Dream Ride Family,\n\nFor the past 20 years, The Dream Ride Experience has been the signature event of The Hometown Foundation, Inc., which represents communities and participants of Special Olympics from around the globe. With the ongoing health and safety concerns directly related to COVID-19, The Hometown Foundation, Inc. has modified this year's Dream Ride Experience to ensure those who can safely attend are able to do so under appropriate social distancing guidelines. For those unable to join us in person, we will be providing a virtual viewing and participation experience, so that Dream Riders around the globe can still join in on the fun. So mark your calendars and join us on Friday, August 21 - Sunday, August 23, 2020 in Farmington, CT as we celebrate our Dream Riders and their year-long achievements in a new format.\n\nWhile we will have to wait until next year to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of The Dream Ride Experience in its traditional format, we are still prepared to showcase the bond and friendships we have been cultivating over the past twenty years with our Summer of Dreams!
