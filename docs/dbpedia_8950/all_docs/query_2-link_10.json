        "text": "WOLFSBURG, Germany — This sturdy, workaday city in northern Germany has long been known as the birthplace of the “people’s car” — the Volkswagen.\n\nBut even though the Volkswagen Group’s hulking plant and headquarters still dominate the skyline and local economy, city planners in recent years have tried to forge a more modern identity for Wolfsburg and its 125,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe gritty downtown near the railway station has been given a makeover, crowned by a futuristic science center by the Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid. A gleaming soccer stadium was erected, home to VfL Wolfsburg, the 2015 German Cup winners. There is now a water park, an indoor ice arena and an annual international dance and music festival. There are more than a dozen new commercial and industrial parks that have nothing to do with the manufacture of cars or auto parts."
