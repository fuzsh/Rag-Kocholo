        "text": "The United States federal regulations define light-duty trucks as trucks and vehicles that have a gross vehicle weight up to 8,500 pounds and payload capacities up to 4,000 pounds. These vehicles can include vans, pickup trucks, minivans, and sport utility vehicles (SUVs). The government set this vehicle classification for the regulation of fuel economy. These vehicles are typically used for utility rather than personal use, so these vehicles have lower fuel economy standards.\n\nThis regulation started in the 1970s when fuel economy regulations were starting to form and the United States government determined that trucks should not be held to the same standards as passenger cars. As the number of trucks sold increased, the initial regulation for trucks was now split into light-duty trucks and heavy-duty trucks.\n\nLight Duty Trucks Today\n\nMany Portland, CT, Middleton, CT, East Hampton, CT, Cromwell, CT, and Middlesex County, CT residents use light-duty trucks for both recreational use and work.
