You can identify it by its:\n\nshell that:\n\nis serrated and pentagon-shaped\n\nhas five sharp spines on the side of each eye and three rounded lobes between the eyes\n\nback leg tips that are:\n\nhairy\n\npointed\n\nslightly flattened\n\ndifferent sized front claws\n\nsize, which can be up to ten centimetres\n\ncolour that varies from green to red or yellow\n\ntemperament that is:\n\nterritorial\n\naggressive\n\nIf you think you have seen a European Green Crab, report it.\n\nNearshore native crabs found in eastern Canada that look similar to the European Green Crab include:\n\nRock Crab (Cancer irroratus), which:\n\nis larger (up to fifteen centimetres)\n\nhas a broad oval shaped shell that can be red/brown or purple\n\nhas nine rounded lobes on either side of the eyes\n\nJonah Crab (Cancer borealis), which:\n\nis larger (up to eighteen centimetres)\n\nhas a scallop-shaped shellÂ\n\nhas nine rounded lobes on either side of the eyes\n\nLady Crab (Ovalipes ocellatus), which:\n\nhas oval tips on its hind legs\n\nhas five spines on either side of the eyes, like the European Green Crab\n\nis white to yellow/grey, with red/purple spots\n\nNearshore native crabs found in western Canada that are green in colour and can be mistaken for European Green Crab include:\n\nNorthern Kelp Crab (Pugettia producta), which:\n\nhas a pronounced pointy nose\n\nhas a shell that is longer (front to back) than it is wide\n\nHelmet Crab, also called Hairy Helmet Crabs (Telmessus cheiragonus), which:\n\nare covered with bristles and bumps\n\nhas a diamond shaped shell\n\nHairy Shore Crab (Hemigrapsus oregonensis), which:\n\nhas three spines on either side of the eyes\n\nhas a square shell\n\nWhere is the species invasive\n\nIn Canada, European Green Crab has invaded:\n\nNew Brunswick in 1951\n\nNova Scotia in 1953\n\nThe Gulf of St. Lawrence in 1994\n\nPrince Edward Island in 1997\n\nBritish Columbia in 1998\n\nThe Magdalen Islands, QuÃ©bec in 2004\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador in 2007\n\nAlthough they look the same, there are different populations of European Green Crab found in eastern Canada. The first population spread into Atlantic Canada in the early 1950s, moving north from the eastern North Atlantic seaboard and are not cold tolerant.\n\nA second population arrived in the 1980s and 1990s in northern Nova Scotia and are better suited to survive colder waters as they originated from populations in northern Europe. These two populations have mixed and reproduced forming a third cold tolerant hybrid population that is also rapidly spreading both north and south in Atlantic Canada.\n\nEstablished populations of European Green Crabs have been found on the west coast of Vancouver Island. Since 2018, new detections of European Green Crab have been found on: northern Vancouver Island (Port Hardy); southern Vancouver Island (Esquimalt Lagoon, Witty’s Lagoon); the Gulf Islands (Salt Spring Island); Haida Gwaii and, in southern British Columbian waters (Boundary Bay).\n\nDistribution\n\nThe European Green Crab is native to Europe and North Africa. It likely arrived in North America around 1817 carried in the holds of wooden ships.\n\nEuropean Green Crabs are thought to spread during their long larval stage (up to 90 days) through shipping (ballast water transfers) or by drifting on ocean currents. They can also move from one area to another by hitchhiking unseen on boats and gear or in packaged shellfish.\n\nHabitat\n\nThe European Green Crab are found near shore, usually in shallow waters less than 6 metres. They can tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities (salt content of water). They are found in:\n\nsalt marshes\n\nvegetation, including eelgrass beds\n\nrocky coasts\n\nsandy beaches\n\nsheltered areas\n\nshallow water on bottoms that are sandy, muddy, or pebbled\n\nThe adult European Green Crab is very hardy and can survive out of water for five or more days. Its hiding places include:\n\ncrates\n\nboats\n\nbuckets\n\nfishing gear\n\naquaculture gear\n\nequipment\n\nImpacts\n\nThe European Green Crab is highly resilient and can upset the balance of estuarine and marine ecosystems, impacting biodiversity. European Green Crab:\n\nlive 4 to 7 years\n\ncan eat a wide variety of plants and animals\n\nfemales can release up to 185,000 eggs once or twice per year\n\nEcological impacts\n\nEuropean Green Crab impact native ecosystems by:\n\ndestroying beds of shellfish\n\nfeeding on native animals, including:\n\nclams\n\noysters\n\nmussels\n\nsmall fish\n\njuvenile crabs\n\nother crustaceans, including juvenile lobster\n\nout-competing native crab species for food\n\ndisrupting eelgrass beds, which are habitats for many juvenile fish species\n\nSocio-economic impacts\n\nEuropean Green Crab impact the fishing and aquaculture industries by:\n\ndamaging eels when they enter the traps\n\nreducing the abundance of harvested species by:\n\nout-competing native crab and lobster for food and shelter\n\nfeeding on shellfish, including juvenile lobsters, as well as small and juvenile fish\n\nResponse\n\nOnce European Green Crab have established a population in an area, it is practically impossible to eradicate them. However, we can limit their spread and the damage they cause.\n\nFisheries and Oceans Canada is collaborating with many partners including:\n\nacademia\n\nfish harvesters\n\nIndigenous Peoples\n\nconservation groups\n\ncommunity members\n\nprovincial and territorial departments\n\nUnited States\n\nWe provide training on proper identification, sampling methods and data collection standards. Appropriate licencing to detect early invasions and to control populations of European Green Crabs are available in some areas. If your organization is interested in partnering, please contact us.\n\nWhere sustained removal of European Green Crab has taken place, the catch rate for these crabs has decreased considerably and native species have regained their territory.\n\nPhoto gallery\n\nMaps"
