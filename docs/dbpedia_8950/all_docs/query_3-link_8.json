        "text": "Welcome to 2024, glad you're here. With the new year in full swing, now's the time to take a look at some of the most exciting new cars you'll be able to buy in 2024. There's a bevy of SUVs and EVs on the horizon, and even a few sports cars, with brands like Acura, Chevrolet, Mercedes-Benz, and many more all represented on this list. So take a look and tell us which cars you're most looking forward to taking home in 2024.\n\n2024 Acura TLX\n\nOn-Sale Date: Now\n\nPrice: $45,245\n\nAcura very lightly updated the TLX sedan for 2024. Squint and you'll notice the new frameless grille and 19-inch wheel design. More importantly, Acura ditched last year's base model for a new entry-level Technology trim with additional features and an A-Spec option with all-wheel drive at no extra cost. All versions of the 2024 TLX get an updated AcuraWatch safety and driver-assistance suite. The 2024 Acura TLX starts at $45,245 and the A-Spec model with AWD costs $50,195.\n\n2024 BMW X2 / iX2\n\nOn-Sale Date: Now\n\nPrice: $42,995 / TBD\n\nThere's a new BMW X2 in town. The 2024 model has a bold design and a bevy of powertrain options – including electric. The gas X2 has a base turbocharged 2.0-liter engine with 241 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque, while the M35i model has 312 hp and a 0 to 60 mph time of just 5.2 seconds. The electric iX2, meanwhile, has 279 miles of range (WLTP), but it won't be available in the US until later in the year.\n\n2024 Chevrolet Blazer EV\n\nOn-Sale Date: Now\n\nPrice: $56,745\n\nThe new Chevrolet Blazer EV isn't without controversy. Still, the electric SUV has an 85.0-kilowatt-hour battery pack with 288 horsepower and 333 pound-feet of torque, or a 102.0-kWh battery with up to 340 hp. The maximum driving range is 320 miles, and if you wait for the SS model (which goes on sale later in 2024), you'll be rewarded with 557 hp. In the meantime, the base Blazer EV starts at $56,745.\n\n2024 Honda Passport\n\nOn-Sale Date: Now\n\nPrice: $43,275\n\nThe Honda Passport has an updated TrailSport trim for 2024 with a revised suspension with tweaked spring rates, altered damper valve tuning, upgraded stabilizer bars for articulation, and General Grabber A/Tx all-terrain tires wrap around 18-inch wheels. The Passport TrailSport is even available in a beautiful new ​​Diffused Sky Blue paint. The base Passport starts at $43,275 and the TrailSport model costs $49,345.\n\n2024 Honda Ridgeline\n\nOn-Sale Date: Now\n\nPrice: $41,125\n\nThe second-generation Ridgeline turns seven for the 2024 model year and receives some nice updates. Honda updated the cabin and added a new, rugged TrailSport trim with unique damper tuning, 18-inch wheels, and all-terrain tires. Honda touts it as its most capable truck ever. The Ridgeline starts at $46,355.\n\n2024 Tesla Cybertruck\n\nOn-Sale Date: Now\n\nPrice: $60,990\n\nIt took some time, but the Cybertruck is finally on sale. Tesla offers its new electric pickup in three configurations – rear-wheel drive, all-wheel drive, and Cyberbeast. The Cyberbest packs all the bells and whistles with 845 horsepower and a 2.6-second 0-60 time. It can also tow 11,000 pounds and travel 320 miles on a single charge for $99,990. If that's too much, the AWD version for $79,990 comes with 600 hp, a 4.1-second 0-60 time, and 340 miles of range.\n\n2024 Acura ZDX\n\nOn-Sale Date: Early 2024\n\nPrice: $60,000 (est.)\n\nAcura is reviving the ZDX nameplate in the form of its first electric SUV. Scheduled to go on sale early this year, the new Acura ZDX will have a more traditional shape than its wacky predecessor, as well as a Google-based infotainment system, and a 500-horsepower Type S model that will be Acura's \"most powerful and quickest accelerating SUV\" ever. The ZDX starts at “around $60,000,” and it has up to 325 miles of range.\n\n2024 Audi Q8 / SQ8\n\nOn-Sale Date: Early 2024\n\nPrice: $74,895 / $97,705\n\nThe Audi Q8 and SQ8 offer updated looks for 2024. The SUVs adopt a new version of Audi's octagonal Singleframe grille with larger intakes and a honeycomb pattern, plus Matrix-design LED headlights standard across the range. The base model gets 335 horsepower and 369 pound-feet from its updated 3.0-liter inline-six engine while the SQ8's twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 has 500 hp and 568 lb-ft. The base Q8 starts at $74,895 for 2024 and the SQ8 costs $97,705.\n\n2024 Cadillac Celestiq\n\nOn-Sale Date: Early 2024\n\nPrice: $340,000\n\nThe stunning Cadillac Celestiq will hit the road in 2024. With a higher-than-expected price of $340,000, the luxury EV should make around 600 horsepower with a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive setup, giving it an estimated 0-60 mph time of 3.8 seconds. Expect the total driving range to be just over 300 miles.\n\n2024 Chevrolet Traverse\n\nOn-Sale Date: Early 2024\n\nPrice: $36,000 (est.)\n\nThe Traverse got a major glow-up for 2024. The updated SUV has a handsome exterior design with a rugged new Z71 trim for (light) off-roading duty, and a more premium interior with a huge 17.7-inch touchscreen. Pricing details won't be available until later in the year, but the 2024 Traverse goes on sale early in 2024.\n\n2024 Genesis G70\n\nOn-Sale Date: Early 2024\n\nPrice: $40,525\n\nA light facelift has the Genesis G70 looking better for 2024, while a new base model gets 300 horsepower and standard Brembo brakes. The turbocharged 2.0-liter engine offers up 48 more hp than the outgoing model. You can still get the G70 with the twin-turbo V6, but the base model starts at $40,525 and the V6 costs $48,125.\n\n2024 Honda Prologue\n\nOn-Sale Date: Early 2024\n\nPrice: $45,000 (est.)\n\nHonda will bring its first electric SUV to the US in the form of the Prologue. Sharing an Ultium platform with GM, the new Prologue could have north of 300 miles of range (depending on the spec), with an estimated starting price of around $45,000. Expect to see it on sale by early this year.\n\n2024 Hyundai Santa Fe\n\nOn-Sale Date: March 2024\n\nPrice: $35,000 (est.)\n\nHyundai only recently pulled the wrap off the 2024 Sante Fe, which trades the current vehicle's generic crossover look for a more rugged Land Rover vibe. It has up to 277 horsepower with the turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine option and a base hybrid model with 177 hp. No pricing details are available yet, but expect the SUV to start at around $35,000 when it goes on sale in March.\n\n2024 Kia Sorento\n\nOn-Sale Date: Early 2024\n\nPrice: $32,000 (est.)\n\nThe facelifted Sorento debuted late in 2023 and will go on sale in a few months. But there's a catch. You will have to settle for the pure gas model if you want the new look and updated interior, as the 2024 Sorento Hybrid will be a carryover of the current generation until the new version debuts for the 2025 model year. There's still no pricing for the new 2024 Sorento yet, but expect it to start at around $32,000 when it goes on sale.\n\n2024 Lexus GX\n\nOn-Sale Date: Early 2024\n\nPrice: $64,250\n\nThe Lexus GX was overdue for a makeover. The 2024 model arrives with an excellent boxy design and new features that make it more capable off-road. It comes with a twin-turbo V6 engine with 349 horsepower, an electronically controlled two-speed transfer case, and a locking rear differential on certain trims. The Lexus GX doesn't go on sale for a few months still, and it starts at $64,250.\n\n2024 Mercedes-Benz CLE / CLE53\n\nOn-Sale Date: Early 2024\n\nPrice: $60,000 (est.) / TBD\n\nRather than having a C-Class Coupe and E-Class Coupe in the same lineup, Mercedes combined the pair into one big-ish two-door dubbed the CLE. The base model has a twin-turbo inline-six good for 375 horsepower with a handsome 12.3-inch touchscreen running MBUX software. The more powerful CLE53 has an upgraded inline-six with 443 hp and a 0-60 mph time of 4.0 seconds. You'll still have to wait a few weeks to get your hands on either of these models.\n\n2024 Mercedes-Benz E-Class\n\nOn-Sale Date: Early 2024\n\nPrice: $60,000 (est.)\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz E-Class is new for 2024, with an EQ-inspired exterior design, a cabin flush with lavish materials, and a massive center display. The base model gets a turbocharged 2.0-liter engine with 255 horsepower while the optional inline-six offers up 375 hp. The new E-Class will go on sale in just a few months, but no pricing details have been released yet.\n\n2024 Mini Countryman / John Cooper Works\n\nOn-Sale Date: May 2024\n\nPrice: $39,895\n\nMini made some big changes to the Countryman for 2024. All-wheel drive is now standard, with the John Cooper Works variant packing a 312-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter engine. The peppier version starts at $47,895. Mini will also offer an all-electric version of the model that will begin deliveries in the fall of next year, but we don't have complete details for the US-bound model.\n\n2024 Nissan Rogue\n\nOn-Sale Date: Early 2024\n\nPrice: $30,000 (est.) / TBD\n\nNissan updated the Rogue's looks for 2024. The popular crossover features a revamped grille with a more intricate design and modified taillight graphics. The automaker launched the third-generation Rogue over three years ago, with more substantial changes hiding inside the refreshed vehicle. It now comes with Google built-in, meaning buyers can access Google Maps, Assistant, and the Play Store without pairing their smartphone to the car. The tech is available in conjunction with the upgraded 12.3-inch infotainment screen for the SL and Platinum grades. The Rogue continues to soldier on with a 1.5-liter three-cylinder unit.\n\n2024 Subaru BRZ tS\n\nOn-Sale Date: Early 2024\n\nPrice: $36,465\n\nSubaru added the new tS trim to the 2024 BRZ. The variant has an STI-tuned suspension with Hitachi dampers. Based on the BRZ Premium, the car also has bigger brakes – four-piston Brembos in the front and two-piston units in the back. Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tires wrap around 18-inch wheels. The new variant, which comes standard with Subaru's EyeSight driver-assist tech, will sit at the top of the BRZ lineup\n\n2024 Subaru WRX TR\n\nOn-Sale Date: Early 2024\n\nPrice: $42,775\n\nThe Subaru WRX TR is a new trim for the performance sedan. Under the hood is a turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder boxer engine making 271 horsepower and 259 pound-feet of torque – but it's not cheap. The new WRX grade starts at $42,775, and it features stiffer springs, a re-tuned steering rack, and Brembo brakes. All-wheel drive is standard, but it'll go on sale with an integrated rear deck spoiler instead of the massive fixed wing seen on the Australian market model.\n\n2024 Toyota Land Cruiser\n\nOn-Sale Date: Early 2024\n\nPrice: $55,000 (est.)\n\nThe Toyota Land Cruiser is back in the US. The retro-tinged off-roader packs a turbocharged and hybridized 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine with 326 horsepower, plus 8.7 inches of ground clearance, and up to a 31-degree approach angle. Toyota says the new Land Cruiser will cost somewhere in the mid-$50,000 range when it goes on sale in just a few months.\n\n2024 Mercedes-AMG SL63 S E Performance\n\nOn-Sale Date: Summer 2024\n\nPrice: $200,000 (est.)\n\nThe current Mercedes-AMG SL63 debuted in 2021 with V8 power, followed by a four-cylinder SL43 model in 2022. Now the most potent Mercedes SL63 S E Performance goes on sale in 2024 with 816 horsepower from a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 with hybrid power. There's no official pricing yet, but expect an MSRP north of $200,000 to start.\n\n​​2024 Porsche Panamera\n\nOn-Sale Date: Summer 2024\n\nPrice: $101,550\n\nThe third-generation Porsche Panamera debuted late in 2023 with new styling, improved handling, and more power. Porsche will offer the sedan with four different E-Hybrid powertrains, with the Turbo E-Hybrid delivering 670 horsepower and 685 pound-feet of torque. The car has a new two-chamber, two-valve air suspension system that separates the dampers' compression and rebound control. The 2024 Panamera also gets a revamped design that looks similar to the model it replaces. It has additional front-end air inlets and a rejiggered center console.\n\n2024 Polestar 3\n\nOn-Sale Date: Summer 2024\n\nPrice: $85,300\n\nThe Polestar 3 debuted in late 2022, and production for the US market is expected to begin early next year. It'll have an estimated 300 miles of range from its 111.0-kilowatt-hour battery pack (107 kWh usable). A Performance Pack can increase the crossover's output to 517 horsepower and 671 pound-feet of torque but also lowers the expected range. It can hit 60 miles per hour in a claimed 4.5 seconds."
