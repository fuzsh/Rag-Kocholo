        "text": "Carly E. - 2018 Honda CR-V\n\n\"My husband we're on the search for a new car in 2017. We bank with east country federal credit union and learned they also had a great car buying service! We decided to look into it and ended up with the best customer service, an amazing price, no hassle of going to the dealership, and a brand new 2017 Honda CRV sport! A year later, we were in need of another car for our growing family. It was an easy decision to go with the credit union and New Card Inc again. The process and customer service didn't disappoint once again and we love our new 2018 Honda CRV! A big thank you to New Cars Inc and ECSC!\"\n\nElena S. - 2015 Subaru Forrester\n\n\"I had the BEST experience with New Cars Inc.\n\nI was a first time car buyer who was overwhelmed and frustrated. I had been driving a 1992 Volvo Station Wagon since I was 16 so I didn't even know what a good car consisted of. Cup holders and AC were on the top of my list and wouldn't you know it, those are available in literally every type of modern car in the market.\n\nSo after months of research I had my heart set on a Subaru Forrester. I looked for this car for what felt like forever. I am a full time college student with a full time job who had a broken down car and was in desperate need of a new one. With a full plate finding a car, though very much needed, was not my top priority. I was irritated with car shopping and just began feeling like wanting to settle for a car I really didn't want so it could all just be over.\n\nThat's when I came across New Cars Inc through Cal Coast Credit Union and started working with Chris Wedelake via email. The whole process took about 4 days!! He found my dream car I'd been researching and searching for for months and he found it in 2 DAYS. He was also able to work the price down about $1000. Chris made an overwhelming experience easy and enjoyable. The day I went in to sign the paperwork and pick up the car in total took about 45 minutes.\n\nI got my car for a great price with low mileage and all the bells and whistles! I have had my Subaru since March and it has been an absolute dream. It's an amazing car and it's mine all thanks to Chris and New Cars Inc! Their service is fast, friendly, and fantastic! If I could give them 10 stars I would in a heartbeat! I would recommend their services to anyone and everyone, and if I ever need to buy another car I'll be working with New Cars Inc. again! I am so thankful!\""
