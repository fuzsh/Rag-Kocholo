        "text": "Tesla has introduced an upgraded Model 3 sedan in North America, which was previously available only in China, the Middle East, and European markets.\n\nThe Model 3, which was codenamed “Highland” during its development, has undergone several visible changes, making it a better entry-level EV option. These features include a new backseat screen, ambient light, and more. The revamped model is now taking orders for deliveries.\n\nTesla optimized the latest model’s aerodynamics by redesigning the exterior with a slimmer hood and low-profile headlamps. The EV maker removed the recognizable bulge on the front end, which could potentially improve the range. Moreover, the new model also offers four color options, including Ultra Red and Stealth Grey.\n\nThere are now just two models available instead of three in Tesla’s configurator: the more affordable Rear-Wheel Drive model or the longe-range AWD option with dual motors. For now, there’s no longer an option to order the former top-of-the-line Performance model.\n\nWhile the rear wheel model’s EPA estimated range remains at 272 miles, the 2024 Long Range Tesla Model 3 boasts an estimated range of up to 341 miles, an increase from the 333 miles of its predecessor.\n\nBoth variants have the same starting price as last year’s models, but there is one additional difference. According to Tesla’s website, the peak speed for both versions of the new 2024 Model 3 is 125 mph, while the 2023 rear-wheel model tops out at 140, the Long Range model tops out at 145, and the Performance model could reach 162 mph."
