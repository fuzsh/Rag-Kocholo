        "text": "It’s not easy to name a new vehicle. At Volkswagen, we consider language differences, customer perceptions, originality and more, going through hundreds of options before finding just the right fit for a model’s personality.\n\nWe’re sharing the art and science of the names behind Volkswagen models. Take a look and learn how today’s Volkswagens and some of their classic predecessors got their monikers.\n\nThe Arteon takes its name from the Latin word for art (artem) and alludes to the emphasis VW placed on its design. The four-door coupe includes features such as chrome strips on its frameless side windows and a wraparound grille.\n\nOriginally known as the Passat CC, CC can be taken to mean “comfort coupe.” Although coupes are generally two-door cars, among modern designers the word “coupe” can also describe cars with the sloping roofline of a coupe, regardless of how many doors they have.\n\nSeveral VW models take their names from winds, a pattern that’s more of a historical accident than a planned strategy, and many think that trend continued with Golf. But “Golf” isn’t a type of wind – it’s the German word for the Gulf Stream ocean current. It also happened to be the name of a key manager’s horse, which appears to be the real inspirationOpens an external link.\n\nAnother in the Greek mythology series, Phaeton was a god who almost lost control of the chariot that pulled the sun across the sky. In the 19th century, a phaeton was a specific type of carriage, one with large wheels and an open body designed for speed. In the early days of the auto industry, the name was sometimes applied to open-topped, powerful vehicles – and while the Phaeton has never been built as a convertible, the powerful sense of the name made it a natural for a luxury sedan and wagon.\n\nAhead of its launch in 2009, Volkswagen teamed with a German automotive magazine to poll readers about what the new compact SUV should be named. The choices included Namib, Rockton, Samun, Nanuk and Tiguan – a portmanteau of the German words for tiger and iguana. It’s also the latest in a series of animal -inspired names, along with Rabbit and Fox."
