        "text": "The council of my hometown ‘s-Hertogenbosch has announced the publication of a traffic plan for its city core which the local press hailed as “historic”. The upcoming plans to redesign especially the ring of streets around the historic heart and the area around the railway station mark a significant milestone in the development of this city. Drivers will be banned from using parts of the ring!\n\nAccording to the city’s website, the call for a more livable and accessible inner city has become increasingly urgent as ‘s-Hertogenbosch experiences an important growth in population, employment opportunities, and tourism. With new homes, workplaces, and more visitors coming into the area, the pressure on its infrastructure and public spaces has reached unprecedented levels.\n\nTo tackle these challenges, ‘s-Hertogenbosch plans to adopt a comprehensive approach to mobility. The city seems to fully recognise that sustainable growth and improved quality of life can go hand in hand. Therefore, the focus extends beyond simply reducing traffic congestion to creating a city that is cleaner, greener, and more enjoyable for its residents and visitors alike.\n\nHow the city wants to do this was summarized in three keywords, all starting with a V in Dutch: “verminderen, verschonen, veranderen”, which means “reducing, cleaning up, and changing. This will need some extra clarification.\n\nReducing means fewer short car trips to and from the city center and less car traffic cutting through this area.\n\nBy cleaning up, the city means reducing CO2 emissions and noise pollution through cleaner modes of transportation.\n\nChanging traffic patterns means that people are more likely to choose public transportation, shared mobility options, cycling, or walking.\n\nFewer car trips can only be achieved by drastic measures and therefore the alderman for traffic, Roy Geers, called the plan an “earth-shaking event”. The local newpaper called it a “historic change”. Banning cars from using parts of the ring road is indeed novel for ‘s-Hertogenbosch (although one street was closed in 2022). I must admit that I am pleasantly surprised! When I told this alderman – half jokingly – that he just needed to get to work, when he took up his position in May 2022, I had not expected this major change in the city’s policies!\n\nQuite novel as well, are the plans for the community engagement. From residents to businesses and tourists, everyone is invited to contribute their ideas and feedback. Through public consultations and innovative tools, such as recorded conversations converted to text, the city aims to harness the collective wisdom of its population and visitors.\n\nKey Initiatives\n\nTo summarise: the mobility plans for the “broad inner city” (the historic center and the railway area combined) encompass a range of initiatives designed to transform ‘s-Hertogenbosch into a place for sustainable urban living:\n\nEnhanced Public Spaces: Improvements to pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure will make it easier and safer for people to navigate the city center on foot or by bike.\n\nReduced Car Dependency: Measures will be implemented to discourage short car trips and prioritise cleaner modes of transportation, such as public transit, shared mobility, cycling and walking.\n\nSelective Access: Restricted access to motorised vehicles in key areas will enhance safety and enhance the overall quality of the urban environment.\n\nIntegration with Development Projects: Mobility improvements will be integrated with other major developments, minimising disruption and maximising benefits for residents.\n\nOriginally the website announced that the detailed plans would be made public on 6 May, but unfortunately that was postponed to 15 May (later today!). Based on what we know now, from some websites and a newspaper article (covering the offical press announcement), I was able to make a video. These plans are really big for this city and this council. If these plans are indeed as impressive as they now appear this will truely change the city and its traffic management. I live in this area, so this will have a direct and major impact on my living environment. I am really looking forward to the publication of the detailed plan. Until then you can watch the video to see what we know now, and to see that these streets around the historic city center do indeed need a redesign!"
