        "text": "New Rearendia, officially the Republic of New Rearendia, is a Nordic independent country that used to be an European colony and got its independence around 2011.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe country used to be a colony of one of European empire, getting its independence around 2011. However, it wasn't recognized in the world at the time. In 2011, Rip Clutchgoneski represented it in the World Grand Prix.\n\nOne of the cities in the country is Wheeli which is the hometown to Rip Clutchgoneski.\n\nFlag[]\n\nThe flag of New Rearendia is red, orange and green. It is divided by an orange Nordic cross in four parts, with opposite sections of the same color, red or green. In the upper left section is an orange symbol shaped as a gear.\n\nHowever, there is an inconsistency on the disposition of the red and green colors. All flags and insignia scattered in the film have the upper left square green (with the other squares colored accordingly), while Rip Clutchgoneski's WGP insignia painted on him is arranged with the upper left square red.\n\nLocations[]\n\nWheeli\n\nResidents[]\n\nRip Clutchgoneski\n\nBrian Gearlooski\n\nTerrell Geartry\n\nAppearances[]\n\nCars 2\n\nSources[]\n\nMeet the Cars\n\nNames in other languages[]\n\nPolish: Nowa Spoilerina\n\nBrazilian Portuguese: Nova RearÃªndia\n\nTrivia[]"
