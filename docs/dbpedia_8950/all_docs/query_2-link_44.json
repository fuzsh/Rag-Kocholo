        "text": "The plant in the center of Bavaria is not only the production site of AUDI AG, but also the headquarters of the Group and Technical Development. The Audi A3, Audi A4 and Audi A5 model series as well as the Audi Q2 are produced here. Audi has also been producing the all-electric Audi Q6 e-tron model series at its main plant since the end of 2023. The site, which has had carbon-neutral production since January 2024, is the first German Audi site with its own battery assembly facility. Thanks to a comprehensive flexibilization of the production lines, the site is ideally prepared for the gradual transition to electric mobility and the production of further all-electric models. In 2023, 403,874 cars will have rolled off the production line at the Ingolstadt site. With around 40,000 employees, Audi is the largest employer in the region.\n\nAutomobiles have been produced at Audi's Neckarsulm site for more than 100 years. With its small- and large-series expertise and variety of derivatives, the site masters the greatest product diversity in the Volkswagen Group. Not only the Audi A4, Audi A5 Cabriolet, Audi A6, Audi A7 or Audi A8 model series are produced here. Audi Sport GmbH (formerly quattro GmbH) has been based here since 1983.\n\nThe all-electric Audi e-tron GT is being built in the Böllinger Höfe industrial park around six kilometers away in the Heilbronn area.Neckarsulm also plays a key role in future-oriented projects for digital production and logistics in the Volkswagen Group and is continuing to develop into a smart factory.\n\nVarious VW models have been built at Volkswagen Sachsen in Zwickau since 1990. In recent years, the site has been converted to the production of electric vehicles – and thus to a balance sheet-neutral multi-brand plant. Production of the Audi Q4 e-tron all-electric SUV began in March 2021. Zwickau is the birthplace of Audi, as founder August Horch registered \"A. Horch Motorenwagenwerke AG\" here in 1904."
