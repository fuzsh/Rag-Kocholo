        "text": "Chapter Four. “I’m in Love with a Guy Who Flies in the Sky”: The Path to Hollywood Stardom\n\nOn August 24, 1941, the Chicago Tribune announced that Dale Evans, “the Chicago girl who has had considerable success in both radio and night clubs,” would make a guest appearance on one of WGN’s evening shows to sing “More Than You Know.”\n\n(WGN Radio headquarters, 1935.)\n\nA lot changed in Dale Evans’s life between the mid-1930s and the beginning of the 1940s. While she once identified with the sentiment of “I Can’t Get Started,” she finally moved ahead with her career, moving from Dallas to Chicago. Dale became so well-known in the Windy City that locals embraced her as one of their own, a “Chicago girl.” She sang on WGN and WBBM, appeared at swanky nightclubs with popular bands, and even toured for a while with a nationally known big band. All of these performances laid the foundation for the next step in Dale’s career, which she assumed would be Broadway.\n\nBut the next big opportunity came knocking from the other coast: Hollywood, California. Dale Evans arrived there in the late summer of 1941, with a one-year film studio contract. Instead of becoming a theater star, she would become a movie star.\n\n(Twentieth Century-Fox back lot, c. 1940s.)\n\nAs Dale prepared for her screen debut, the film project was put on hold. The Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, drawing the United States into World War II. Over the next months, Dale scrambled to make sure her big break didn’t fall to pieces.\n\nChapter Three. “I Can’t Get Started”: Struggling for Singing Stardom\n\nThe late 1936 move to Texas, where Frances’s parents lived in Ellis County, near the town of Italy, proved the right thing for nine-year-old Tommy Fox.\n\n(A more recent image of a street in Italy named for Dale Evans.)\n\nAt the end of 1936, Frances Fox/Dale Evans was still chasing stardom, was still determined to have it all: a fabulous career and a happy home life. But every time she thought she found true love, something went wrong and the relationship failed. Dale’s decision to move from Memphis back to her home state of Texas reflected her sense of responsibility to her son. She believed Tommy would thrive on her parents’ farm, and she was right.\n\nCareer-wise, Ellis County offered nothing for Dale Evans. Her parents agreed to take care of their grandson while she moved forty miles north to Dallas, where radio station WFAA hired her as a singer. It was a good job in a sizeable market. Dale also regularly appeared as a featured vocalist with two local orchestras.\n\nSometime in 1939, Dale Evans probably made her first recording, the Vernon Duke/Ira Gershwin tune “I Can’t Get Started.” Her career had picked up, she was well-known locally, but there was no sign yet of the stardom she longed for.\n\nThe song has been recorded by numerous artists over the decades, though it’s most closely connected to Bunny Berigan and his orchestra (it was their theme song in the 1930s) and jazz singers Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald.\n\nIt’s Fitzgerald’s recording that is heard in the season two finale of the television show Gilmore Girls, which aired in May 2002. The episode is also called “I Can’t Get Started.” Sookie St. James, the fabulous chef and best friend of Lorelai Gilmore, is planning her wedding and contemplating playing the song at the beginning of the ceremony.\n\nLorelai tries to convince Sookie that it might not be the best choice, that the lyrics are depressing and morbid. It’s “about a woman who can’t make her relationship work, whose life is filled with emptiness, regret, and pain.” Sookie’s response? “Who listens to the lyrics?” And “I Can’t Get Started” plays at her wedding.\n\nSookie cared for the music more than the lyrics, and she also may have picked up on the underlying message of the song. (Luckily she also understood that Lorelai almost always gives bad advice.) After getting stuck, no matter for how long, you get unstuck and start to move again. Dale Evans knew that. Even when she became impatient, when she thought it was taking too long to achieve her goal, she moved forward. Closer to stardom.\n\n(Dale Evans, before she was Queen of the West.)\n\nChapter Two. The Sweetheart of Song: Becoming Dale Evans\n\nWith one dream dashed, another was about to come true.\n\nWell, that’s a pretty short first sentence! When combined with the chapter title, it’s clear that it didn’t take too long for Frances to become successful enough as a singer that she needed a stage name. The chapter delves into what it took to make that happen.\n\nFor her debut performance, Frances sang “Mighty Lak’ a Rose.” Written in 1901 by lyricist Frank Lebby Stanton (who later became Georgia’s first poet laureate) and pianist/composer Ethelbert Nevin, the sentimental piece, utilizing a white interpretation of Southern Black dialect, imagined a Black “mammy” caring for a white baby. The song was a hit during the early twentieth century, performed and recorded several times by different vocalists. Later on in the century, singers dropped the dialect. Here’s Petula Clark’s 1955 version.\n\nFrances still lived in Memphis when her singing career started. She dedicated the song to someone very special during that first performance, which was carried over the radio airwaves. In the 1920s, radio rapidly developed into the most modern and popular news and entertainment source in the country. More and more Americans bought at least one radio.\n\n(The Brox Sisters, popular Broadway singers, listen to their radio in the mid-1920s, via Wikimedia Commons.)\n\nFrances thought she had it made in Memphis radio. But it was 1929. The stock market crashed not long after her debut, dragging the United States into the Great Depression, and forcing Frances to alter her plans. It would take her a while longer to become Dale Evans.\n\nI grew up in the Chicago suburbs in the house my parents bought when they got married in 1956.\n\n(2912, sixty years after it was built.)\n\nOn Saturday mornings, when we were young, my siblings and I got up early, sprawled out on the family room floor, and turned on the television. It was cartoon time. How long we got to watch depended on when my parents woke up and if they decided there was something more productive we could or should be doing with that time. Still, we could usually count on an hour or more before we might get pulled away.\n\n(This isn’t us. It’s a Getty image. We were two girls, two boys, and almost always in pajamas.)\n\nIt was hard to get four children to agree on what to watch. Most of the time, though, it was probably three, because our youngest brother wasn’t born until 1963 so he didn’t get much of a say. Our sister, the eldest, probably had the most authority over the channel dial.\n\nThere was so much to choose from in those years that stretched from the mid-1960s to the end of the decade: Mighty Mouse, Casper (the friendly ghost), Underdog, The Jetsons, and even The Beatles. We could all usually agree on Batman, The Archies, Scooby Doo, Where Are You?, and of course, Jonny Quest.\n\n(Mighty Mouse–here he comes to save the day.)\n\nWe loved the commercials, too, because that’s where we got the scoop on the latest toys and breakfast cereals. Sometimes we would dash into the kitchen and get bowls of cereal to eat while we watched the rest of the cartoons. My favorite was Cap’n Crunch. But cereal could cause a problem, especially if we poured milk into the bowl, because of the spill factor. It could create a mess.\n\nSo the best Saturday cartoon mornings were the ones when we had Pop-Tarts. These deliciously sweet breakfast pastries came out in 1964, though I can’t remember when my mother first bought them. But the brown sugar cinnamon ones were the best, first the unfrosted kind, one of the original flavors, then the frosted after 1967.\n\n(Yes, they really were so popular that Kellogg’s initially couldn’t keep up with the demand. And I remember that diagonal crease for breaking them in half.)\n\nCartoons and Pop-Tarts. That’s how I remember those Saturday mornings. But every once in a while, we broke the cartoon tradition and turned on a live-action program, usually at my suggestion. And the show I wanted to watch? The Roy Rogers Show, which co-starred a woman I never forgot, not even long after those blissful Saturday mornings in front of the tv with my siblings ended. Dale Evans."
