Stanton once told CA: \"My primary motivation for writing is to examine myself and others on the edge of things, events, and time. Therefore, my scholarly work has been on British and American novelists and poets, including Gore Vidal and Truman Capote. My poems are about madness, death, intense love; my novels are about serial killers, death, and insanity.\n\n\"My writing process is always concerned with discovery. I enjoy becoming one with the minds of madmen and other twentieth-century rejects. My poems explore the modern art forms of post-impressionism, surrealism, abstract mood paintings, and expressionism. (Most of my poems involve the existence and exploration of paradoxes.)\n\n\"In The Devil's Rood: A Group Novel about America's First Serial Killer, I led four of my creative writing students in creating a group novel, mainly written in dramatic monologue form, a form I have used extensively to create my most recent poetry. Dramatic monologue is a wonderful vehicle to reveal the character and personality of the poem's narrator.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nCommonweal, December 4, 1981, Saul Maloff, review of Views from a Window: Conversations with Gore Vidal, p. 696.\n\nFirst Coast Entertainer, December 16, 2000, Carol Elliott, review of Collected Word Paintings: Wordstroke Impressions and Portraits, Surreal Brainscapes, Abstract Moods, and Mono-dramatic Expressions.\n\nForbes, March 1, 1982, review of Views from a Window, p. 27.\n\nMiami Herald, April 30, 2000, review of The Devil's Rood: A Group Novel about America's First Serial Killer.\n\nNation, March 21, 1981, J.D.
