        "text": "When the ol’ man got religion things sorter changed aroun’,\n\nThe house wuz topsy-turvy, the worl’ wuz upside down;\n\nWe didn’t know what hit us; ’peared like we’d stared wrong;\n\nLife had to be made over to his halleluia song!\n\n’Twuz in the winter season? He lit in thisaway:\n\nHe pulled the kiver off us long ’fore the break o’ day;\n\nStir roun’! stir roun’! he’d holler all up an’ down the stairs—\n\nThis life’s too short fer sleepin’; rise up fer family prayers!\n\nWe crawled out from that kiver with mournful sighs an’ groans,\n\nThe teeth of us a-chatterin’ like minstrels beatin’ bones!\n\nAn’, ranged aroun’ the fireplace—a mighty mournful ring—\n\nHe’d holler: Hymn Two Hundred: Let ever’body sing!\n\nAn’ you never heard such singin’ sence life an’ time begun;\n\nThe angels couldn’t stand it, an’ stopped their ears an’ run!\n\nFer the music, comin’ zig-zag from them new singin’ ranks,\n\nWuz worse than storm-winds howlin’\n\nRoun’ Jordan’s stormy banks!\n\nHe kept the whole house hustlin’:\n\nWork while it’s called To-day!\n\nAn’ pray whilst you’re a-workin’; but work an’ work away!\n\nBut ever’ youngster of us—with sad an’ sollum face,\n\nWuz prayin’ fer the ol’ man to fall away from grace!\n\nLong years have passed an’ left us still with our work to do;\n\nAn’ the ol’ man, bein’ weary, went Home an’ left us, too;\n\nLed by his homely counsel safe to the shelterin’ fold—\n\nSightin’ the fur-off city with shinin’ streets of gold.\n\nAn’ evermore we’re praisin’ of the Providence on high\n\nThat the ol’ man got religion in the happy days gone by;\n\nAn’ we hope to hear him shoutin’,\n\nWhen we reach the heavenly stairs,\n\nIn the bright, Celestial mornin’—\n\nRise up to fam’ly prayers!"
