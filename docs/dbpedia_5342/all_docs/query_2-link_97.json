Pretty good world with its hopes and its fears — Pretty good",

Let us sing it that way —\n\nPretty good world, good people!\n\nMake up your mind that you're in it to stay —\n\nAt least for a season, good people!\n\nPretty good world, with its dark and its bright —\n\nPretty good world, with its love and its light;\n\nSing it that way till you whisper, \" Good-night! \" —\n\nPretty good world, good people!\n\nTranslation:\n\nLanguage:\n\nRate this poem:\n\nReviews\n\nNo reviews yet."
