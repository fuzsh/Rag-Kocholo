Guard it with your life, as Tuits are hard to come by, especially the round ones. This is an indispensable item. It will help you become a more efficient worker and help you lead a more fulfilling life. For years, you have heard people say, “I’ll do it as soon as I get a Round Tuit.” Now that you have one, you can accomplish all those things you have been putting aside until you got a Round Tuit of your very own. Please feel free to send a Round Tuit to all of your friends and family members who also make it a habit to procrastinate.\n\nBy Author Unknown\n\nContinue scrolling down this website page to read the next article, or click or tap on these words to read “Humor And Inspiration And Learning About Procrastination And Procrastinating” Gathered By David Hugh Beaumont.\n\nHappy Thoughts And Their Power\n\nThe power of thoughts should not be underestimated. In an average day it is estimated that we have around 60,000 thoughts.\n\nIt is known that happy people think more happy thoughts than unhappy people.\n\nHappy thoughts connect us with the clarity, confidence, and courage to act . . . to know what to do. To travel down our own path rather than the same trail everyone else follows.\n\nJealous, angry, or fearful thoughts take us away from our own path . . . our own purpose. They strip us of our power and ability to act effectively.\n\nIf we think happy thoughts . . . we create happy perceptions . . . which lead us to happy events. And so we create a blissful circle (where we become ever happier) as opposed to a vicious circle.\n\nIf we think fearful thoughts we become afraid and act defensively. This pushes away other people and other possibilities away from us. And so we become lonelier and more afraid.\n\nThe route to a happier life is through happy thoughts. Not just because they make you feel better immediately . . . but because happier thoughts give you a stronger and more stable foundation to your life. You are in control rather than being bounced around by life.\n\nThink happy thoughts!\n\nBy Author Unknown\n\nContinue scrolling down this website page to read the next article, or click or tap on these words to read “Fun and Learning about How to Be Happy” gathered by David Hugh Beaumont.\n\nInstructions For Life\n\n1.

Learn the rules so you know how to break them properly.\n\n6. Don’t let a little dispute injure a great friendship.\n\n7.

Remember that silence is sometimes the best answer.\n\n11. Live a good, honorable life. Then when you get older and think back, you’ll be able to enjoy it a second time.\n\n12. A loving atmosphere in your home is the foundation for your life.\n\n13. In disagreements with loved ones, deal only with the current situation. Don’t bring up the past.\n\n14. Share your knowledge. It’s a way to achieve immortality.\n\n15. Be gentle with the Earth.\n\n16. Once a year, go someplace you’ve never been before.\n\n17. Remember that the best relationship is one in which your love for each other exceeds your need for each other.\n\n18. Judge your success by what you had to give up in order to get it.\n\n19. Approach love and cooking with reckless abandon.\n\n20.

He had almost nothing to work with, but accomplished great things.\n\nWhether the task was to build a fire underwater or stop a waterfall from falling, it seemed he could take care of it. I was so amazed to see the things he could do, I finally asked him how he did it.\n\nHe told me that a long time ago, he had found a magical solution to nearly all challenges that came along. He said it was all contained in a single, ancient word that had mystic powers. When you understand the meaning of the word, it unleashes immense strength and abilities; it makes your mind more clear; it makes your imagination run wild with ideas.\n\nWell, of course, I could hardly contain myself and I just had to know what this powerful magic was. I pleaded with him to tell me and he finally agreed.\n\nHe said the word is ‘yagottawanna.’\n\nIn order to accomplish anything, whether it is small or big, easy or difficult, trivial or of utmost importance, in order to be successful, you have to want to do it. To earn good grades, yagottawanna earn them. To become an Eagle Scout, yagottawanna be one. The main reason people do not succeed at something is because they do not really want it bad enough. By really wanting something, you come up with ideas, make plans, and then do it.\n\nRemember, to do something, yagottawanna do it.\n\nBy Author Unknown\n\nThe Be Attitudes\n\nBe understanding to your perceived enemies.\n\nBe loyal to your friends.\n\nBe strong enough to face the world each day.\n\nBe weak enough to know you cannot do everything alone\n\nBe generous to those who need your help.\n\nBe frugal with that you need yourself.\n\nBe wise enough to know that you do not know everything.\n\nBe foolish enough to believe in miracles.\n\nBe willing to share your joys.\n\nBe willing to share the sorrows of others.\n\nBe a leader when you see a path others have missed.\n\nBe a follower when you are shrouded by the mists of uncertainty.\n\nBe first to congratulate an opponent who succeeds.\n\nBe last to criticize a colleague who fails.\n\nBe sure where your next step will fall, so that you will not tumble.\n\nBe sure of your final destination, in case you are going in the wrong way.\n\nBe loving to those who love you.\n\nBe loving to those who do not love you; they may change.\n\nAbove all, be yourself.\n\nBy Author Unknown\n\nContinue scrolling down this website page to read the next article, or click or tap on these words to read “Humor And Inspiration And Learning About Attitudes And Expectations” Gathered By David Hugh Beaumont.\n\nFritillaria Meleagris, or Checkered Lilies, flowering plants with bell-shaped, two-toned deep purplish-red blossoms.\n\nThings Work Out\n\nBecause it rains when we wish it wouldn’t,\n\nBecause men do what they often shouldn’t,\n\nBecause crops fail, and plans go wrong -\n\nSome of us grumble all day long.\n\nBut somehow, in spite of the care and doubt,\n\nIt seems at last that things work out.\n\nBecause we lose where we hoped to gain,\n\nBecause we suffer a little pain,\n\nBecause we must work when we’d like to play -\n\nSome of us whimper along life’s way.\n\nBut somehow, as day always follows the night,\n\nMost of our troubles work out all right.\n\nBecause we cannot forever smile,\n\nBecause we must trudge in the dust awhile,\n\nBecause we think that the way is long -\n\nSome of us whimper that life’s all wrong.\n\nBut somehow we live and our sky grows bright,\n\nAnd everything seems to work out all right.\n\nSo bend to your trouble and meet your care,\n\nFor the clouds must break, and the sky grow fair.\n\nLet the rain come down, as it must and will,\n\nBut keep on working and hoping still.\n\nFor in spite of the grumblers who stand about,\n\nSomehow, it seems, all things work out.\n\nBy Edgar A. Guest\n\nEdgar Albert ‘Eddie’ Guest was born on 20 August 1881 in Birmingham, England. He immigrated with his family to the United States of America in 1891. From his first published work in the “Detroit Free Press” until his passing in 1959, he penned some 11,000 poems that were syndicated in 300 newspapers and collected into more than twenty books. Mr. Guest is reputed to have had a new poem published in a newspaper every day for more than thirty years. He became known as ‘The People’s Poet,’ writing poems that were of a sentimental and optimistic nature. Edgar Albert ‘Eddie’ Guest passed on at 77 years of age on 5 August 1959 in Detroit, Michigan, United States of America.\n\nContinue scrolling down this website page to read the next article, or click or tap on these words to read “Humor And Inspiration And Learning About Continuing And Progressing” Gathered By David Hugh Beaumont.\n\n​Winner’s Blueprint For Achievement\n\nBelieve while others are doubting.\n\nPlan while others are playing.\n\nStudy while others are sleeping.\n\nDecide while others are delaying.\n\nPrepare while others are daydreaming.\n\nBegin while others are procrastinating.\n\nWork while others are wishing.\n\nSave while others are wasting.\n\nListen while others are talking.\n\nSmile while others are frowning.\n\nCommend while others are criticizing.\n\nPersist while others are quitting.\n\nBy William A.
