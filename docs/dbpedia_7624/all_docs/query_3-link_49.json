        "text": "While spending several days in Berlin last week to take part in the Critics’ Week sidebar to the Berlin Film Festival, I took a few hours to make up for an omission of long standing. Back in 2012, I visited that city’s Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe and wrote about the fact-free emptiness of the memorial’s array of black stelae. I found (and still find) its high-design tastefulness nonspecific and pristine, both shame-free and victimless. (Among the improvements I suggested were six million speed bumps scattered throughout the roads of Germany, both rendering memory constant and daring drivers to curse “the Jews” as they slowed down.) I later learned that, at the far edge of the array, there is a staircase leading down to a subterranean Information Center that fills in the historical background, and last week, when I took a short break from the movies, that’s where I went. And yet, somehow, I didn’t get far from the movies at all.\n\nThe first part of the exhibit, the Foyer, is a sort of textual and visual chronology of the Holocaust, from 1933 to 1945, illustrated by a strip of images approximately a foot in height that are captioned to describe or contextualize the events. Some show the living (Jews being publicly humiliated by German officials, Jews being deported by train, Jews penned together in the Warsaw Ghetto, Jews being lined up in front of a pit, and—much later—Jews who have survived the atrocities), and some show the dead (the corpses in the pit where, moments earlier, people had been lined up; victims of heat and dehydration removed from a deportation train; victims of Bergen-Belsen being bulldozed into a mass grave after the camp was liberated). At the end of this chronological hall are portraits of six victims of the Holocaust—archival photographic closeups, blown up to about four feet in height, with a brief biographical sketch of each victim beneath the images.\n\nThe proportions were off. First, the documentary images of Nazi crimes are too small for their captions. At such a small size, the photographs are turned into mere samples or swatches of history rather than its embodiment; they seem like illustrations of the captions rather than the focus of attention. Moreover, the well-intentioned humanistic focus on the individuality of the victims further draws attention away from the horror. Rather, they suggest a generic message of sympathetic decency beside which the horror of the archival photographs is minimized. Scale matters. If an image of corpses in a ditch had been reproduced at not one foot tall but eight—or as large as necessary for the dead to appear life-size—the Information Center would have risen above the merely informative to become an aptly monstrous avowal of monstrous crimes. Of course, to display photos of such size, the subterranean space would have to be as vast as the array of stelae—or, better, would have to take its place at street level.\n\nThe adjoining room, the so-called Room of Dimensions, is the emotional and aesthetic core of the Information Center. It’s a darkened space featuring about a dozen texts from victims of the Holocaust—fragments of a diary written over the printed pages of a novel; another diary written on toilet paper; a final telegram from a Jewish man in Berlin to his family in England just before he committed suicide; a poem, on a scrap of paper, by Miklós Radnóti about a mass shooting that he survived; a memoir by Marcel Nadjary of what he observed as a member of a Sonderkommando in Auschwitz; a letter from a Jewish woman in Poland warning relatives that Jews were being deported not, as authorities claimed, to do work but to be murdered by poison gas. Each physical fragment of texts is reproduced twice, once at actual size and once in a large blow-up several feet wide, and the texts are transcribed and translated beside them, in German and English.\n\nInstead of being encyclopedia-style compendia of information, these texts are personal accounts of the Holocaust, the bearing of witness that simultaneously describes events and conjures the individuality of the writers. For that matter, the documents themselves are a physical form of witness, enduring fragments of the Holocaust. The Room of Dimensions isn’t just a collection of words: the combination of the life-size documents, the blow-ups for examination purposes, and the transcription beside them has the authority of images, transforms these texts into images. These first-person documents are the most powerful sources of information in the Information Center. The Room of Dimensions is, by far, the most imaginative memorial at the memorial; it would be better had the 4.7-acre site of the array of stelae been replaced instead with dozens, hundreds, thousands of such original texts by Jews who were murdered or survived the slaughter.\n\nThe question of presenting memory and history isn’t one of responsibility and thoroughness, of supposed factual objectivity in lieu of emotional experience. On the contrary, it’s an aesthetic matter, a question of art. On Wednesday, I took part in the opening-night conference of Critics’ Week, with Charles Tesson, of the Cannes festival, and Sergio Fant, of the Locarno festival, in a discussion moderated by the critic Carmen Gray, about the current state of the German cinema. One thing we agreed on is the prevalence of bland, distinction-less historical dramas—mainly about the Holocaust, but also about the Cold War. (One such recent film is “Labyrinth of Lies.”) They’re not so much reëxaminations of history as the packaging of pre-programmed responses to it. They may, by the very nature of drama, be built from specific details, but their unquestioned naturalistic representation of history leads to a distancing of that history from the present day, and the standardized arc of these scrupulously professional dramas boils those details down to a familiar and empty ruefulness.\n\nThe contemporary German cinema is of a piece with the Holocaust memorial, works of tastefulness and dignity that signify a collective national acknowledgment of the crimes of the past without incarnating the terrifying process of memory or the leaching of their revelations into the present day. They insulate the present from the past. On Friday night, a Critics’ Week screening of another new and yet-unreleased film, “Coma,” directed by Sara Fattahi, showed what’s missing from the German cinema. (I wrote notes on the screening for the Critics’ Week Web site. New Yorkers will soon be able to see for themselves: “Coma” will be shown next Sunday and Monday, Feb. 21 and Feb. 22, in MOMA’s Doc Fortnight series.)\n\nFattahi (who does her own camera work) films (or, rather, records on digital video) her mother, her grandmother, and herself, in the family apartment in Damascus. And that, for the most part, is the movie—it’s the war in Syria, experienced by three generations of one family, mainly at home. Which is to say that it’s not a comprehensive view of the war, not a history of the war, not a visual documentation of battles or atrocities, not a rhetorical effort at advocacy. “Coma” is an incarnation of war in daily life, a mental image of war that is embodied in a repertory of actual images that don’t seem to be borrowed from the familiar realm of audiovisual communication but instead seem to be invented from the state of things, wrenched from the horror to incarnate the horror without depicting it expressly.\n\nFattahi’s mother is divorced from a man—a Syrian officer—whom she was pressured to marry and regretted marrying, and who, while the three women live in fear and isolation in Damascus, does nothing to help. Fattahi’s grandmother, recently widowed, is still openly grieving. Fattahi herself misses her friends, with whom she communicates via e-mail, in scenes that render the pixels of her computer screen nearly alive with a tactile, grosgrain intimacy.\n\nIn their near-carceral isolation, broken only by occasional errands—particularly a trip by Fattahi and her grandmother to her late grandfather’s grave—and visits from neighboring women for a remarkably vivid game of cards, the three women are visited by the Syrian past, in the form of home videos of popular movies from bygone years, of recordings of older generations’ popular songs. Fattahi’s selection of these clips is an ingenious curation, a form of cultural archeology that extracts from their modern-classic entertainments lines of dialogue and dramatic situations that reflect with a jolting precision the situation at hand, that come off as deep historical foreshadowings of the new conflict in the political and personal conflicts of the past—or, rather, the reflections of decades-long continuities of traumas and troubles.\n\nPrivate lives scarred by the political history that’s smothered in the past and the history that’s being made in the present (which Fattahi presents in local television and radio news reports as well as in hints and rumors that the women pick up and discuss) are probed and transfigured in images of haunted, premonitory intimacy. Fattahi is, on the basis of one film, one of the world’s most audacious cinematographers and image-composers. She devises urgently intimate closeups, oblique compositions, impressionistically out-of-focus shots, and exquisitely and ironically canny framings to wrest her family’s life in wartime away from familiar and unquestioned modes of representation and to render it as pure creation and mystery. An exquisitely, bitterly comical sequence of a couple on an amusement-park ride during a time of battle turns the screen into a mirror and the couple into reflections of the movie’s own spectators, who are looking at a distant war as if with a blank fun-house gaze. The subject of “Coma” is the very possibility and inadequacy of attempting to represent the war in a movie.\n\n“Coma” reminds me of the late Chantal Akerman’s “No Home Movie” (which played at the New York Film Festival last October), in which Akerman films her aged and ailing mother at the family apartment in Brussels and records their discussions about the traumas suffered by her parents and extended family during the Second World War (her mother was a survivor of Auschwitz). Even more, it reminds me stylistically of Akerman’s 2006 film about her visit to Israel, “Là-Bas” (Over There), in which Akerman remains in one sublet room and records the spectres of history and politics that haunt her.\n\nLike Akerman, Fattahi thinks in images, creates images that are themselves experiences, that don’t merely reflect history but become part of history by the mnemonic power of their own fiercely inventive style. All great political documentaries are radical acts of memory—works of imagination in which the past isn’t transparently accessible as a static archive but has to be re-created through ongoing and unresolved effort directed both toward the events and at one’s own experience of them. They’re works in which the filmmakers’ own standpoint and perception is integral to the process of reporting and documentation.\n\nAt the opening-night conference of Critics’ Week, I responded to a fellow-panelist’s praise of German filmmakers’ effort to consider the country’s past with the charge that looking at the past is easier than looking at its present. What’s missing from the German cinema today is the power to film in the first person, to see the crimes of the past in the present tense, to admit that, in some inescapable way, they’re one’s own—or, for that matter, to declare brazenly that they’re not. But doing so isn’t only a matter of good will, of readiness to take on such moral risks; it’s a matter of artistic audacity that arises from a confrontation with the matter of the medium. For the most part, the German film industry displays a fundamental lack of aesthetic daring, of reconsideration of the physical and practical means of filmmaking. It’s burdened with an assembly-line system of financing and production into which each individual director’s scripts are plugged—with a lack of independence, both economic and artistic.\n\nFreely inventive creation brings its own politics, is inherently political, because it renews a viewer’s perception of the world. Filming herself and her family in an apartment, Sara Fattahi has made a great political film, not only because the subjects that they discuss are political but because her filmmaking is itself the invention of an original, personal, and transformative political way of seeing. Neither the German film industry nor its grand-scale commemorative urbanism is, at the moment, up to her level of achievement.\n\nFrance’s film industry has at least as much of a centralized administrative infrastructure as Germany’s, but France has maintained an unbroken string of artistic filiation, from the French New Wave through generations of artists that lead up to the present day, including Akerman, Philippe Garrel, Leos Carax, Bruno Dumont, Sophie Letourneur, Serge Bozon, Antonin Peretjatko, and others. Germany had its own New Wave in the nineteen-sixties and seventies, but Rainer Werner Fassbinder died in 1982, at the age of thirty-seven; Wim Wenders and Werner Herzog emigrated; and young German filmmakers are, in effect, orphans. Yet it’s one of the signal merits of the Berlin festival’s Critics’ Week programs to submit the present state of German cinema to discussion and scrutiny while also showing films that may provide the basis for a new artistic reconstruction. As the exemplary art of the age, the cinema can launch an intellectual and aesthetic reconstruction far beyond movies into the arts overall, including the art of public memorials. It’s easy to imagine a generation of daringly original filmmakers setting into motion an aesthetic sensibility, one sufficiently shared and collectively motivating to have superseded in advance the bland and blank refinement of the memorial’s array of stelae."
