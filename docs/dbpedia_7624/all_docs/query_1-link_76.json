        "text": "M. Night Shyamalan and his wife Bhavna Vaswani have three children together\n\nM. Night Shyamalan’s daughters are entertainers in their own right.\n\nThe critically acclaimed filmmaker and his wife Bhavna Vaswani are parents to three daughters, Saleka, Ishana and Shivani. His family has supported him throughout his career, and his work has clearly inspired them in their own professional pursuits.\n\nAs his daughters have gotten older, Shyamalan has made his business a family one, enlisting them to work on his projects in the filmmaking and music arenas.\n\nHis middle daughter Ishana is a filmmaker like her dad, who made her directorial debut with the horror film The Watchers. Meanwhile, his eldest daughter Saleka is a musician who has provided music for her dad’s films, recently starring in his horror film Trap.\n\nAdditionally, being a father has heavily influenced Shyamalan’s scripts. “I'm a girl dad with three girls, and it's just the way I see things,” he told Screen Rant while promoting Trap. “I see the world through their eyes. My fear of the world is for them; protecting them or overprotecting them, and then wanting them to look up to me and be proud of the things that I say and do.”\n\nHere’s everything to know about M. Night Shyamalan’s daughters and how he’s worked with them through the years.\n\nSaleka Shyamalan, 28\n\nSaleka Shyamalan, known professionally as Saleka, is Shyamalan’s oldest child whom he welcomed in August 1996. While Saleka watched many horror movies with her father growing up, she ended up developing a passion for music at a young age.\n\n“I studied classical piano very seriously and was prepping to be a concert pianist and study at a conservatory,” she told The Hollywood Reporter of her early career as a musician. “But then, when I was 16, I started feeling a desire to write and compose for myself and to use a different type of creativity, so I shifted my path.”\n\nAfter releasing her first single \"Clarity\" in September 2020, she released her debut album Séance in 2022. Additionally, her music has been featured in several of her father’s projects, including Servant and Old.\n\nSpeaking with PS in 2021, she talked about writing \"Remain” for Old at her father's request.\"He gave me the script to read and told me that one of the characters in it sings a song, and he wanted me to write it,\" she said. \"The script was such a masterpiece, suspenseful, emotional, chilling, there was so much to draw from artistically.”\n\n\"This was one of my favorite songs to write because the script of Old was the most inspiring prompt I could ever ask for,\" she continued. \"We talk about film, music, [and] art a lot in my family, and often help each other with ideas for projects we are working on. So collaboration with my dad actually felt very natural.\"\n\nIn August 2024, Saleka made her acting debut in her father's film Trap, in which she plays a pop star named Lady Raven. Additionally, she wrote 14 songs for the film which are featured on Lady Raven (Original Music from the Motion Picture Trap), including one track with Kid Cudi.\n\nFor the role, Saleka told PEOPLE she channeled Taylor Swift, noting how she’s such a global icon. “She’s not just a singer and an entertainer you see on stage, she’s a boss,” she explained. “So I think we thought a lot about that.”\n\nIshana Shyamalan, 24\n\nIshana Shyamalan, known professionally as Ishana Night Shyamalan, is Shyamalan’s second child born in November 1999. Speaking with PEOPLE about the 25th anniversary of The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan noted that the film is dear to his heart as it was released right before he welcomed Ishana. “I was close to her age when I wrote Sixth Sense,” he said of Ishana. She noted that her mother was pregnant with her when she attended the red carpet premiere in August 1999.\n\nIshana has directly followed in her father’s footsteps, becoming a filmmaker in her own right. Speaking with Variety in 2021, she noted that she developed a passion for horror movies early on, at the movie nights her dad hosted.\n\n“From the time I was able to watch a movie, we were watching horror movies,” she told the publication. “I remember in my elementary school in the library, I would come in every time and they would say, ‘We have a new scary story for you.’ I formed a sense of identity based on that when I was pretty young.\"\n\nDuring a joint interview with The New York Times, Shyamalan recalled witnessing Ishana’s passion for movies early on, though he let her find her own way in the movie industry. “I knew she would be a filmmaker, but I never pushed her into it,” he told the publication. “We’d watch a movie and she would really connect with what we were watching. She was able to discern what was exceptional about what we had watched.”\n\nIn addition to directing a handful of her sister Saleka’s music videos, she has regularly teamed up with her father on projects. Notably, she served as the second unit director for his films Old and Knock at the Cabin and wrote and directed several episodes of his series Servant.\n\nSpeaking with PEOPLE about the series, Shyamalan said Isana \"grew into” the show’s “main director and main writer” in season 2. “That I didn't expect, that she would direct more episodes than anybody including me, and she would write more episodes,” he said. “It was astonishing. We ended up relying on her.”\n\n“Over those three years of growth for her — both for her and us — it was a trial by fire, and it worked out,” he added. “It was something else. She's totally ready to destroy her first movie, and the muscles from Servant, all those hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages she wrote for us and all those hours on set, just amazing. I couldn't be more proud of her and admire her.”\n\nIn June 2024, Ishana made her directorial debut with the supernatural horror film The Watchers, which was produced by her father. At the premiere of the film, Ishana talked with PEOPLE about her dad’s support and the advice he gave her early on in the process.\n\n\"He said at the very beginning, he was like, 'If you have any question that this is what you wanna do, don't do it. It's hard, and you need to be sure that you can't survive without it,'\" she said, noting she “always took that very seriously.”\n\nAt the film's N.Y.C. premiere, Ishana thanked the cast and crew as well as her father for his continuous support. She noted how he has \"led by example and continuously pushed me to become the best version of myself and the best possible artist.\"\n\n\"Your presence in my life is more impactful than you could know,\" Ishana said to her dad in the audience. \"And because you have paved the path with such grace and fierceness, I get to do what I love.\"\n\nShivani Shyamalan, 19\n\nShivani Shyamalan is Shyamalan’s youngest daughter, who was born in September 2004. Though Shivani leads a more private life than her older sisters, she has supported her dad and sisters at many premieres through the years, with one of her first red carpets being in 2013 for the After Earth premiere.\n\nAdditionally, Shivani’s mom has given occasional glimpses of their family life. For Shivani’s 16th birthday in 2020, Bhavna wrote a sweet tribute to her youngest sharing a number of throwback photos and videos of her.\n\n“Shivi you are a rare being; feeling, thinking, compassionate, cool, easy in your skin, funny, sharp, loyal, thoughtful and beyond your years,” she wrote in the caption. “You have taught me so much and push me to be a better mom, and better person. You have so much to offer the world. I love you so very very much and I’m so proud of who you are becoming.”\n\nOn Mother’s Day in May 2024, she posted another tribute to her girls, noting she was “so proud” of the women they were becoming. “In admiration of these three, who they are, who they are becoming, their talents, their courage & resilience, their hearts, their compassion, and the secure bond they nurture between themselves,” she wrote. “Profoundly grateful to be their mom.”\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
