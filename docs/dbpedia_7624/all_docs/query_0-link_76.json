        "text": "1. The Last Exorcism: Part 2 hits theaters today, and if that seems strange to you, it's for good reason â€” we were promised, after all, that we were watching the last exorcism when The Last Exorcism came out in 2010. But this is far from the first time that Hollywood has dropped a movie with a patently false title...\n\n2. Silent Hill: Revelation 3D (2012)\n\nThe main character spends most of the movie running around screaming. It also doesn't seem to take place on a hill.\n\n3. One for the Money (2012)\n\nGrossed $26.5 million on a $40 million budget.\n\n4. Don't Be Afraid Of the Dark (2011)\n\nThey should totally be afraid of the dark. It's full of monsters.\n\n5. Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist (2008)\n\nSoundtrack actually clocks in at about an hour.\n\n6. The Longest Yard (2005)\n\nTakes place on a regulation football field with perfectly normal-sized yards.\n\n7. Not Another Teen Movie (2001)\n\nYes, another teen movie.\n\n8. Happiness (1998)\n\nArguably the most depressing movies in cinematic history.\n\n9. Mission: Impossible (1996)\n\nThe mission was very possible. So possible, in fact, that they've done three more since then.\n\n10. Batman Forever (1995)\n\nBatman for 121 minutes.\n\n11. The NeverEnding Story III (1994)\n\nThe last whimper of a franchise that ended after three Stories.\n\n12. The Untouchables (1987)\n\nContains plenty of touching.\n\n13. Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984)\n\nFollowed by seven sequels, a three-season TV series, and a 2009 reboot."
