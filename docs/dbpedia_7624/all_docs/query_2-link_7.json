        "text": "Controversial, flamboyant, and spontaneous are probably the best words to describe Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes. Born in Philadelphia, and raised throughout the world as the daughter of a U.S. Army serviceman, Lisa Lopes became one of the most important trendsetters in the 1990s music scene. After relocating to Atlanta during her young adult years, Lopes became heavily involved in that city's thriving music industry that produced many top name acts such as Cameo, Jermaine Dupri, Xscape, and Kelly Price. However, it was Lopes and her two bandmates, Tionne \"T-Boz Watkins\" and Rozonda \"Chilli\" Thomas who put Atlanta on the map. Originally starting as a trio called 'Second Nature', Watkins and Lopes were soon joined by Thomas to form 'TLC', the best-selling girl group of all time. TLC, which stood for the first initial of each member's nickname, were discovered at an Atlanta club by singer Pebbles, who immediately signed them to her label.\n\nAfter breaking into the scene, TLC went on to great success under Arista's new LaFace label, which was managed by superstar producers, Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds and L.A. Reid, Pebble's former husband. After snatching them away from Pebbles, TLC became one of the 1990s greatest success stories due to their creative style and flamboyance. Utilizing condoms on their colorful, baggy clothes, TLC scored three major hits on their 1992 debut album, \"Ooooooooh on the TLC Tip\". With success at hand, Lopes ventured off into the world of stardom, and doing so brought her major headlines. In 1995, Lopes made national and international headlines after she set the home of her boyfriend, Andre Rison, ablaze after a major fight. Lopes, who was sentenced to 5 years probation and therapy at a halfway house, never was able to shake that incident from her personality, and along with Lil' Kim, became one of hip hop music's bad girls. Along with her TLC bandmates, Lopes filed for bankruptcy that same year claiming that poor royalties and an outstanding debt that was owed to Pebbles after she sued the group for breach of contract caused them to take this action.\n\nWith the release of their sophomore album, \"Crazy Sexy Cool,\" Lopes and her TLC bandmates underwent a change from their childlike antics to a sense of maturity that represented their metamorphosis as major recording stars. That album, which became sold 11 million copies became one of that decade's biggest selling albums, netted the group two Grammy Awards, and produced three hit singles.\n\nAfter promoting that album was over, Lopes decided to venture into a variety of projects that showcased her excellent ability to spot talent. She became the mentor and producer of the R&B trio Blaque, whose members saw TLC-like success with several hit singles and starring roles in the film \"Bring it On\". Along with Blaque, Lopes worked with other major artists who sought her talents in producing. Working with singers such as Montell Jordan, Melanie \"Sporty Spice\" Chisolm, and NSYNC, Lopes became one of the music industry's highly sought stars due to her unique vocals and amazing style.\n\nHowever, Lopes who sought a fresh new start in life after a difficult childhood, began to involve herself in holistic and spiritual practices that brought her a sense of peace and tranquility. It was during a trip to Honduras, that Lopes saw a world different from what she saw in the United States, and began to get herself involved in several projects that benefited many victims of Hurricane Mitch, which struck Central America in 1997. Building a healing hut and a child center, Lopes connected with a world that was innocent and new to her. Her sense of pride and duty were reflected by the numerous trips she took to Honduras since her encounter with an African healing doctor in the mid 1990s.\n\nAfter the release and promotion of TLC's 1999 album, \"Fanmail\", Lopes started to shun away from her bandmates in order to develop an identity independent from that of her bandmates. Often disputing with them in public, Lopes worked hard on a solo debut album, \"Supernova\" which was released internationally but never released in the United States due to poor radio play. That album, produced the top 20 hit, \"The Block Party\" which was a big hit in the United Kingdom and Japan.\n\nIn her continuation for a change, Lopes signed a deal to release an album under the alias N.I.N.A. (Not Into Name Alternatives) with controversial producer Suge Knight. That project never came about. On Thursday, April 25 while returning from the village where she called home for the past few years, Lopes was the only fatality in a car crash that occurred when her car swerved off the road near the town of Roma, Honduras. Lopes, who was to celebrate her 31st birthday the next month, died instantly while four of the seven others who were riding in the sports utility vehicle she was driving were rushed to a local hospital in critical condition. Lopes, who adopted a young girl several years ago, left her motherless and left a legion of grieving, distraught fans crying for another life taken so quickly.\n\nJohn Wilkes Booth was an American theatrical actor from Maryland. He was a member of the prominent Booth theatrical family. Booth assassinated president Abraham Lincoln, and was killed shortly after. He was the first of four presidential assassins in United States history.\n\nIn 1838, Booth was born in Bel Air, Harford County, Maryland. It was a small town with less than 200 residents. Booth's father was Junius Brutus Booth (1796 -1852), a British Shakespearean actor who had migrated to the United States in 1821. Booth's mother was Mary Ann Holmes, Junius' long-term mistress. His parents could not be legally married, as Junius had left his wife back in England when he migrated.\n\nBooth was named after the British radical politician John Wilkes (1725 -1797), a member of the Hellfire Club (an exclusive club for high-society rakes). Wilkes happened to be a cousin of Booth's father, though they never met. Junius chose to emphasize their relation.\n\nIn 1851, Junius Booth finally secured a divorce from his first wife, following 30 years of separation. On May 10, 1851 Junius married Holmes. This allowed him to legitimize his children by her. Also in 1851, Junius started building Tudor Hall as a new summer home for his family. It would serve as John Booth's main residence from December 1852 to 1856.\n\nIn 1852, Junius Booth died during a steamboat trip from New Orleans to Cincinnati. He is thought to have been accidentally poisoned through drinking impure river water. John Booth became an orphan at age 14, and was forced to drop out of school. He had previously attended the \"Milton Boarding School for Boys\" and the military academy \"St. Timothy's Hall\". Booth was reportedly an indifferent student. A former teacher thought that Booth was intelligent, but not particularly interested in his studies.\n\nAs a teenager, Booth aspired to become an actor. His older brothers Junius Brutus Booth Jr. (1821-1883) and Edwin Booth (1833 - 1893) had already started their own acting careers. In preparation for an acting career, Booth practiced elocution daily and studied the works of William Shakespeare.\n\nIn August 1855, Booth made his stage debut at the \"Charles Street Theatre\" of Baltimore. He was playing the Earl of Richmond in Shakespeare's \"Richard III\". He missed some of his lines, and the audience jeered at him. At about that time, Booth started performing regularly at the \" Holliday Street Theater\" of Baltimore. This theater had previously hosted performances by other members of the Booth family.\n\nIn 1857, Booth joined the stock company of the \"Arch Street Theatre\" in Philadelphia. He used the alias \"J.B. Wilkes\" to avoid comparison with his father and brothers. He gained a reputation as a scene stealer, and the audience reacted positively to his enthusiasm. In February, 1858, Booth played the role of Petruchio Pandolfo in the opera \"Lucrezia Borgia\" by Gaetano Donizetti. He developed stage fright, and accidentally turned his opening lines into a comedic monologue. The audience reacted with roaring laughter.\n\nLater within 1858, Booth started performing in Virginia. He joined the stock company of the \"Richmond Theatre\" in Virginia. He became popular due to his energetic performances, and the audience singled him out for praise. By the end of 1858, Booth had appeared in 83 plays in a single year. His favorite role was playing Marcus Junius Brutus, because he was \"the slayer of a tyrant\".\n\nBy the end of the 1850s, Booth had a yearly income of 20,000 dollars. Critics described him as \"the handsomest man in America\" and a \"natural genius\", and female audience members idolized him. His performances were often acrobatic in nature, with him leaping upon the stage. He was passionately gesturing as he spoke his lines. He regularly practiced swordsmanship to use its movements in his performances. He reportedly \"cut himself with his own sword\" on several occasions.\n\nIn 1860, Booth started his first national tour as a leading actor. He performed in major cities, such as New York City, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, St. Louis, Columbus, Georgia, Montgomery, Alabama, and New Orleans. Critics praised his lively performances, though they noted that Booth was less cultured and graceful than his brother Edwin. Walt Whitman commented that Booth had flashes of real genius as he performed.\n\nIn 1861, the American Civil War started. Booth publicly expressed his admiration for the Southern United States secession. Several people wanted him to be banned from the stage for his supposedly treasonous statements, but no official action was taken against Booth. In 1862, Booth regularly performed in the Union states of the war, despite his Confederate sympathies. He also performed in the border states, the small group of slave states who refused to secede from the Union (Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, and Missouri).\n\nBy 1863, Booth won more acclaim for portraying villains on stage. He frequently performed as Richard III, King of England (1452 - 1485, reigned 1483-1485) in Shakespeare's tragedy \"Richard III\". He also played the villainous Duke Pescara in \"The Apostate\". By the autumn of 1863, Booth was regularly performing in Boston, Providence, Rhode Island, and Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nIn November 1863, Booth first performed on \"Ford's Theatre\" in Washington, D.C. The theatre building was new, debuting in August 1863. It was owned by John Thompson Ford (1829-1894), an old friend of the Booth family. Booth was among the first leading men to appear in the theatre. Among the audience in Booth's original performance was Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln and his family noted that Booth frequently glared at the president throughout the performance. Booth declined an invitation to meet Lincoln in person. Booth gained a new fan in Tad Lincoln (1853 -1871), Lincoln's youngest son, who was thrilled with Booth's performances. Booth delivered a rose to Tad as a gift, in appreciation of the boy's vocal admiration for him.\n\nBooth continued regularly performing in 1864 and early 1865, making his final theatrical performance on on March 18, 1865. In 1864, Booth helped raise funds for the erection of a statue of William Shakespeare for Central Park. Also in 1864, Booth invested part of his income in Fuller Farm Oil, a Pennsylvania-based oil drilling company. Their oil well reportedly yielded 25 barrels (4 kl) of crude oil daily. Booth withdrew his financial support of the company by the end of the year, possibly in reaction to an industrial accident involving explosives.\n\nIn February 1865, Booth was engaged to the famed socialite Lucy Lambert Hale (1841-1915), daughter of the Republican senator John Parker Hale. Booth's mother approved their relationship, though Holmes warned her son that his romantic infatuations tended to be short-lived. Booth reportedly had never explained his hatred of Lincoln to his fiancee.\n\nBy late 1864, Booth had formed a small network of Confederate sympathizers. They plotted to kidnap Abraham Lincoln. But in April 1865, Booth heard the news that Robert E. Lee had surrendered at Appomattox Court House. He decided that the kidnapping plot was no longer feasible, and started plotting to assassinate Lincoln instead.\n\nBy April 14, Booth had finalized his plan to personally assassinate Lincoln while the President attended a performance at Ford's Theatre. Booth's fellow conspirators were supposed to also assassinate vice-president Andrew Johnson and secretary of state William H. Seward, the two men at the top of the presidential succession order. Their plan was to throw the Union into a state of panic and confusion, in hopes of prolonging the civil war.\n\nOn the night of April 14, Booth shot Lincoln in the back of the head with with a .41 caliber Deringer pistol. Major Henry Rathbone (1837-1911) then attempted to apprehend Booth, but Booth stabbed him with a knife. Booth then jumped on the state, loudly proclaiming \"sic semper tyrannis\". (Latin for \"Thus always to tyrants\"). He was quoting a phrase attributed to Marcus Junius Brutus, in reference to Julius Caesar's assassination. His fellow conspirators failed in their own assassination tasks. Johnson was left unharmed, while Seward received non-fatal wounds in the attack targeting him.\n\nAfter leaving Washington, D.C on horseback, Booth fled into southern Maryland. By that time, Booth had injured his leg in uncertain circumstances. His leg was briefly treated by Dr. Samuel Mudd (1833 - 1883). Booth spend days hiding in the Maryland woods, waiting for an opportunity to cross the Potomac River into Virginia. By April 26, Booth was located by Union troops while hiding in Richard H. Garrett tobacco barn in Virginia. When Booth refused to surrender, the soldiers set the barn on fire. Booth was shot by sergeant Boston Corbett (1832-c. 1894), who was acting against orders.\n\nBooth was fatally wounded in the neck, with the bullet partially severing his spinal cord. He was left paralyzed, and had to be transported to Garrett's farmhouse. He died there three hours later, at the age of 26. His last request was for the soldiers to tell his mother that he died for his country. His final words were \"useless, useless\", in reference to his paralyzed hands.\n\nBooth's corpse was transported by ship to the Washington Navy Yard for identification and an autopsy. The body was then buried in a storage room at the Old Penitentiary. In 1867, Booth's remains were moved to a warehouse at the Washington Arsenal. In 1869, his remains were released to the Booth family, and buried in the family plot at Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore.\n\nBooth's legacy has remained controversial in the 150 years that followed his death. Confederate veterans and their families praised him for years as a martyr to their cause, while Northerners cursed him as the madman who killed the \"savior of the Union\" (Lincoln). By the early 20th century, Booth was popularly blamed for supposedly causing all the mutual hostility and violence associated with the Reconstruction era (1865-1877). But he remains one of the most famous figures associated with the American Civil War. His tomb annually attracts visitors.\n\nOne of the leading European newspapers, Le Matin of Paris, describes G. Gordon Liddy as \"a man of fantastic intelligence and complexity.\" Educated privately by Benedictines and Jesuits, Liddy earned a B.S. degree from Fordham University and an Ll.D. from the Fordham Law School, graduating as an editor of The Fordham Law Review. After two years service as an Army artillery officer during the Korean War, Liddy entered the FBI as a Special Agent, rapidly earned multiple commendations from the late J. Edgar Hoover and, at age 29, became the youngest Bureau Supervisor at FBI national headquarters in Washington, DC, where he served during the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations. Liddy resigned from the FBI in 1962 to practice international law in Manhattan. Thereafter he served as a prosecutor, ran unsuccessfully for Congress from the 28th district of New York, then in 1968 ran the presidential campaign of Richard Nixon in that district. In the Nixon administration Liddy served first as Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury, was then appointed Enforcement Legislative Counsel, authored the Explosives Control Act and, in 1971, was sent to the White House as Staff Assistant to the President of the United States. At the White House Liddy had oversight responsibility for Treasury policy on firearms and explosives and authored the memorandum that led to the creation of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Subsequently he was assigned additional special duties as a member of the top-secret White House Special Investigations Group. He resigned his White House post to accept the positions of General Counsel of the 1972 Republican presidential campaign and the campaign finance committee, with additional duties as campaign political intelligence director. The rest is history. For his role in Watergate, and for refusing to testify against co-conspirators, Liddy was sentenced to over 20 years in prison. He served nearly five years, many in maximum security, including 106 days of solitary confinement, before his release by President Jimmy Carter \"in the interests of justice\". Rated by the Treasury Department as a pistol expert whose draw and hit was timed electronically by the FBI at 60/100 of a second, Liddy was once assigned by the Secret Service to protect President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He is an FAA licensed pilot and a life member of the Special Operations Association. Today he is the host of \"The G. Gordon Liddy Show\", a radio program syndicated to 600+ markets that is now in its 13th year. His books have appeared on the \"New York Times\" best-seller lists and has written four book reviews for the newspaper, in addition to authoring numerous magazine articles, has lectured extensively, from Berkeley to The Oxford Union, and is an actor in motion pictures and television, including guest-starring roles in Miami Vice (1984), Airwolf (1984), Macgyver (1985), Feds (1997), several \"Perry Mason\" TV movies and and Highway to Hell - 18 Räder aus Stahl (2000). He is also a frequent guest on Fox Television's Hannity & Colmes (1996) and MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews (1997). In 1992 Liddy enrolled at the Israeli Defense Force Paratroop School at Tel Nov, qualified for and was awarded his wings. He has re-qualified and jumped twice more since, and was given the honor of leading the stick out of the aircraft on his jump in January 2003, with the elite IDF parachute regiment. In August 2003 he rode his Harley-Davidson motorcycle the full 1,846 miles from Washington, DC, to Sturgis, SD, for the 63rd Annual motorcycle festival. He's also ridden with the Los Angeles chapter of Hell's Angels and is a member of the Honor Legion of the New York City Police Department. Liddy and his wife have three sons and two daughters. Four of the five have served as officers in the military. One son is a lawyer who is a two-war combat veteran reserve Lieutenant Colonel in the US Marine Corps, just returned from Baghdad. Another is a career Commander in the US Navy SEALs who is currently assigned to the Pentagon, holds a masters degree from Johns Hopkins and is a Ph.D. candidate at Tulane. Liddy's lecture audiences have ranged from an association of independent over-the-road truck drivers to the Oxford Union and, according to \"The Wall Street Journal\", he is \"one of the most sought-after speakers in the nation.\""
