        "text": "Contrary to what is shown in Jim Caviezel's movie, most child trafficking victims know and trust their traffickers.\n\nOne of the most coveted screening spots for any film is in the U.S. Capitol with some of the world's most powerful people filling the audience. Important films such as \"Harriet\" (the biopic about Harriet Tubman) and \"Lincoln\"(the film chronicling the last few months of President Abraham Lincoln's life, including the passage of the 13th Amendment outlawed slavery) have secured this prized location.\n\nOn Tuesday, the film\"Sound of Freedom\" was shown in the Capitol Visitor Center as part of an event hosted by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. \"Sound of Freedom,\" a new feature-length thriller starring Jim Caviezel, tells the story of a former U.S. Department of Homeland Security agent who works to rescue children from sex trafficking in Colombia.\n\nLike \"Harriet\" and \"Lincoln,\" \"Sound of Freedom\" has the opportunity to draw audiences in and help them better understand significant moments in time and crises in American history.\n\nSince its release on July 4, the film has injected into many Americans' summer-time conversations the important topic of human trafficking, and child sex trafficking in particular.\n\nFilmmakers took 'creative liberties' with story about trafficking\n\nUnfortunately, what many don't realize is that although \"Sound of Freedom\" is advertised as a “true story,\" that story is highly fictionalized, with even Angel Studios, the film's distributor, acknowledging that it took \"creative liberties.\"\n\nIn the film, Tim Ballard, the main character played by Caviezel, embarks on a mission through the Colombian jungle to rescue two siblings from a well-organized, machine gun-firing cartel.\n\nNo one should question the importance of raising awareness of human trafficking or of working creatively and diligently to keep kids safe from the horror of sexual exploitation. What all moviegoers – especially our nation's top lawmakers – must know, however, is that the depictions of child trafficking and the rescue tactics celebrated in this film are highly sensationalized, misleading and do more harm than good.\n\nKnow this before going to the movies: Our nuclear weapons are much more powerful than Oppenheimer's atomic bomb\n\nContrary to what is shown in this film, most child trafficking victims know and trust their traffickers. They are not kidnapped by shadowy strangers off street corners. A Baylor University study found that less than 10% of child trafficking cases involved kidnapping.\n\nBy highlighting false narratives and reinforcing inaccurate stereotypes, we condition ourselves to be on high alert for things like windowless vans, failing to notice actual signs of exploitation. In doing so, we may miss the economically and socially vulnerable young person lured into trafficking by offers of meals, gifts, shelter or simple companionship.\n\nMoreover, while movies like this heighten our anxiety about perceived threats to children in public spaces, we may unwittingly ignore the online dangers young people face.\n\nIn addition to problematic depictions of child trafficking, it is also troubling how \"Sound of Freedom\" glorifies rescue missions, disregarding decades of research and experience showing that international sting operations are dangerous, sometimes illegal, often unethical, and fail to dismantle or discourage human trafficking. While rescues and raids make for an action-packed movie, they are far from the preferred response to any kind of human trafficking.\n\nCongress has power to help real-life child trafficking victims\n\nInstead of buying into false narratives of child trafficking or promoting outdated responses, Congress has the unique ability to help create a safer world for all kids.\n\nThis means leading a global coalition of governments that commits to sharing information and increasing funding for survivor protection, prevention and perpetrator prosecution – real solutions that the McCain Institute is focused on advancing.\n\nChild trafficking: From Balenciaga to Disney, companies profit by sexualizing kids – at a horrific price\n\nIt also means adopting new protections for children in the child welfare system, partnering with those who have lived experience (the real-life heroes of the anti-trafficking movement) in policymaking and investing in technology to detect all forms of exploitation.\n\nWhile that kind of work won't make for a box office hit, it will mean fewer children are victimized by human traffickers, a goal we can all get behind."
