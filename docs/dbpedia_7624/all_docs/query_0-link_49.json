        "text": "Grace Van Patten has already established herself as one of the most impressive young actresses with a wide array of critically acclaimed performances for film, television, and the stage. The actress recently landed the coveted lead role of Lucy Albright in Hulu’s book-to-series adaptation, “Tell Me Lies.” Produced by Emma Roberts and based on Carola Lovering’s novel of the same name, the series follows a tumultuous but intoxicating relationship as it unfolds over the course of 8 years. When Lucy and Stephen meet at college, they are at that formative age when seemingly mundane choices lead the way to irrevocable consequences. Although their relationship begins like any typical campus romance, they quickly fall into an addictive entanglement that will permanently alter not only their lives, but the lives of everyone around them. “Tell Me Lies” is the first project to get the TV-adaptation treatment under Roberts’ Belletrist TV banner, which focuses on adapting books for television.\n\nVan Patten can most recently be seen starring in David E. Kelley’s Hulu limited series, “Nine Perfect Strangers,” based on Liane Moriarty’s acclaimed novel. The series, which also stars Nicole Kidman and Melissa McCarthy, was released on Hulu on August 18th. The actress can also recently be seen in Karen Cinorre’s independent feature “Mayday,” which premiered at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nIn 2017, Van Patten was named one of Variety’s 10 Actors to Watch for her performance in Noah Baumbach’s “The Meyerowitz Stories” opposite Ben Stiller, Adam Sandler, Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson. “The Meyerowitz Stories” premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, and had its US domestic premiere at the New York Film Festival. Peter DeBruge of Variety called Grace’s performance “a luminous discovery.”\n\nThe actress can be seen in the Shawn Levy produced feature “The Violent Heart” opposite Jovan Adepo and Mary J Blige, as well as in the independent feature “Good Posture” opposite Emily Mortimer, an official selection of the 2019 Tribeca Film Festival. Her breakout performance was the lead in Adam Leon’s “Tramps,” which premiered at the Toronto Film Festival, and is currently streaming on Netflix. She also co-starred in the ensemble comedy “The Wilde Wedding” opposite Glenn Close, John Malkovich, and Patrick Stewart, as well as in David Robert Mitchell’s “Under the Silver Lake” opposite Andrew Garfield.\n\nOn stage, Van Patten starred as Joan of Arc in the Public Theater’s critically acclaimed production of Jane Anderson’s play “Mother of the Maid” opposite Glenn Close. She previously starred in The New Group’s production of Hamish Linklater’s play “Whirligig” opposite Zosia Mamet. She also recently starred in “This Is Our Youth” opposite Lucas Hedges and Paul Mescal. This play, which is part of Jeffrey Richard’s virtual reading series Broadway’s Best Shows, was directed by Lila Neugebauer. On television, she has appeared in recurring roles on Netflix’s “Maniac” and HBO’s “The Sopranos” as well as guest star roles on HBO’s “Boardwalk Empire” and NBC’s “Law & Order SVU.”\n\nVan Patten is a graduate of LaGuardia High School of the Arts with a major in Drama."
