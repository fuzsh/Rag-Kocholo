        "text": "Let me say up front that no one from GLAAD asked me to write this, and I did not run its content by them or coordinate in any way. These are my independent observations based on my experience as Vice President and Chief Programs Officer under the leadership of Sarah Kate Ellis for five years. I was there for much of what is detailed in the recent New York Times story, and I feel compelled to provide a counterpoint to the imbalanced — and perhaps libelous — story put forward by the Times.\n\nBefore I get into the content of the piece, it’s incredibly relevant to point out that the writer of this piece, Emily Steel, signed an open letter last year criticizing GLAAD and more than 100 other organizations and leaders who spoke out against The New York Times’ coverage of transgender people. That alone should have disqualified her from investigating and writing this story. I won’t speculate about her motives or those of her editors, but the fact that she had taken a public position against GLAAD’s work speaks volumes.\n\nBeyond that, the piece is riddled with bad reporting, innuendo, lies, mistruths, facts out of context, and misinformation. I know because I was there — but no one at the New York Times bothered to call any of us (and there are many) who could have instantly debunked this nonsense.\n\nSo let’s get into it — facts first.\n\nSarah Kate Ellis’s salary is not $1 million per year. It’s not even close. It’s easily searchable and publicly available on GLAAD’s IRS 990 forms, which are filed annually. The most recent documents indicate a salary of roughly $575,000 and a bonus of about $27,000 — a lot of money, yes, but a far cry from $1 million and very much in line with the leadership of nonprofit organizations with similar budgets.\n\nMuch has been made of GLAAD’s work at Davos, so let me offer some context there as well. The World Economic Forum meets in Davos each year and is composed of leaders from government, business and international organizations, civil society, academia, and media to tackle the world’s most pressing challenges. Until GLAAD entered the frame in 2017, LGBTQ issues were not on the agenda. Today, they are a centerpiece.\n\nWhile I did not attend any of GLAAD’s trips to Davos, I was privy to the strategy, logistics, and other details related to those activations. Here’s the truth. Those trips are funded by a donor who specifically designated those funds for that purpose in order to provide GLAAD an opportunity to have a seat at the table with world leaders, Fortune 100 CEOs, and global influencers in order to make progress on criminalization of LGBTQ identities, HIV medication access, and reform in the Catholic Church. You don’t do that with events and meetings at the local Hampton Inn. If you want to have a seat at the table with world leaders, you go where they are.\n\nGLAAD is not a direct services organization — it is an agent of culture change, and culture change is a long and expensive game. When you show up to Davos, Cannes Lions, the Emmys, Sundance, and other places of elite influence, you must show up as their equal in order to earn a place in the conversation and be trusted to co-create the change we are advocating for. And what is the change that has happened, exactly, from GLAAD’s presence in Davos?\n\nA simple Google search will produce a laundry list of impact for the LGBTQ community from GLAAD’s work there, especially critical at a time when DEI and other inclusive programs are under attack in the corporate world. It’s also worth noting that GLAAD’s fingerprints are all over many things that never are acknowledged publicly because to do so would damage the work and the end goal.\n\nNonetheless, here are just a few headlines tell the tale:\n\nWashington Blade: GLAAD, HRC Presidents Attend World Economic Forum\n\nAssociated Press: Pope Approves Same-sex Blessings For Couples\n\nAssociated Press: Pope Says Homosexuality Not A Crime\n\nWorld Economic Forum: What Davos Taught Me About Supporting My Transgender Child Partnership for Global LGBTQIA+ Equality: Davos Promenade Lights Up Rainbow\n\nNew York Times: Vatican Says Transgender People Can Be Baptized and Become Godparents Here’s the bottom line.\n\nSarah Kate Ellis has taken the organization from literal bankruptcy to the stages at Davos, the Emmys, Cannes Lions, the Super Bowl, and countless other places to represent our community and make change. She has made GLAAD a juggernaut with a place at the table at the world’s most influential cultural moments and among the globe’s leading decision makers and culture shapers. That’s why Time magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2023 and why she commands the respect of the team she leads at GLAAD, the board of directors who hired her, and the leaders of the industries in which she is making change every day. On a personal level, she is one of the most honorable, visionary, judicious, and impactful leaders I have ever worked with.\n\nIt’s a shame to see the New York Times stoop to petty vindictiveness and shoddy reporting for clicks and revenge. It’s not just an attack on Sarah Kate Ellis — it’s an attack on all of us who have been a part of turning GLAAD around and making it a leading global voice for equality and acceptance. My only demand of GLAAD’s leadership would be to go even bigger, even louder, even harder, and even faster. Stay the course. The world needs you now more than ever.\n\n(Editor’s note: Charlie Stadtlander, a spokesperson for the New York Times, disputes Stokes’s characterization of the open letter. He wrote in an email to the Blade: “The letter was not critical of GLAAD. It was signed by over 80 members of our newsroom opposed to the NewsGuild of New York engaging in or taking sides in public debates over internal editorial decisions at The Times. The letter stated: ‘Our duty is to be independent. We pursue the facts wherever they may lead. We are journalists, not activists. That line should be clear.’”)\n\nZeke Stokes is former Vice President and Chief Programs Officer at GLAAD and an executive producer of the award-winning documentary ‘TransMilitary.’\n\nBy Chad Meyerhoefer, Bingjin Xue, Anna Poznańska & Nic Johnson\n\nAnti-LGBTQ bills are being introduced in extraordinary quantities in the United States and abroad. According to the ACLU, as of Aug. 5 more than 525 bills seeking to curtail LGBTQ rights are currently under deliberation in 40+ states.\n\nWhile some of these proposed policies are largely symbolic and may seem to lack substantive day-to-day implications, each one poses the threat of real harm to LGBTQ individuals.\n\nOur data-driven assertion is based on the analysis of anti-LGBTQ legislation that took hold in Poland after the political rise of the far-right Law and Justice (PiS) party in the late 2010s.\n\nMany of these resolutions sought to create “LGBT-free” zones that lacked clearly enforceable tenets, but succeeded greatly in further marginalizing LGBTQ individuals in their home communities.\n\nThe analysis demonstrated an alarming 16% surge in suicide attempts in LGBT-free zones. Moreover, deaths from external causes that include suicide increased by 10%.\n\nThis finding, while heartbreaking and disturbing, does not come as a surprise. In keeping with the minority stress model, negative mental health outcomes may be expected from efforts to further deprecate members of the LGBTQ community, who already face higher levels of stigma, discrimination, and mental health challenges.\n\nThe minority stress model states that external stressors, such as discrimination, contribute to internal experiences of stress, such as self-hatred, which in turn explain adverse mental health outcomes among minority populations, including LGBTQ individuals. This model has extensive research support, highlighting the urgent need for intervention.\n\nBy providing official sanction to generalized discrimination against LGBTQ individuals, these resolutions, even if they are not passed, lead to stress, feelings of isolation and hostility among members of the LGBTQ community. For those already suffering from mental health problems, the social stigma associated with laws targeting their identities can lead to suicide attempts.\n\nAt the national level in Poland, much rhetoric was directed toward restrictions on LGBTQ rights, including a “family charter” signed in 2020 by President Andrzej Duda as part of a re-election campaign pledge to promote family values and assert parental control over child care and extra-curricular school activities and, limit schools’ teaching about LGBTQ issues and “ban the propagation of LGBT ideology.”\n\nWhile relatively little substantive national legislation passed, similar anti-LGBTQ rhetoric spurred a host of legislative efforts at the local level.\n\nBy 2019, a total of 91 powiats (counties), gminas (municipalities), and provinces had enacted some form of anti-LGBTQ legislation. That total rose to more than 100 in 2020, ultimately covering approximately a third of the country and some 10 million of its citizens.\n\nOur analysis compared areas that passed anti-LGBTQ resolutions with others that deliberated but did not pass resolutions or never introduced such legislation. Controlling for other factors that might influence mental health outcomes, our findings were startling: exposure to anti-LGBTQ legislation significantly increased suicide attempts and deaths by external causes.\n\nUnfortunately, Poland is not an isolated case.\n\nIn many other countries, the situation is arguably even more dire, with rampant anti-LGBTQ sentiment spreading and extreme punishments being codified into law. Human Rights Watch has tallied 67 countries with national laws criminalizing same-sex relations between consenting adults, and nine others with laws against the expression of transgender or nonconforming identities.\n\nA wave of anti-LGBTQ legislation in many African countries is expanding the scope of anti-LGBTQ laws and deepening the resulting punishments, which in some cases include the death penalty.\n\nEncouragingly, in Poland, a combination of activism, court rulings, and economic pressures from the EU has led to the reversal of most of the initial LGBT-free zones.\n\nIn the country’s 2023 elections, a centrist coalition formed to push PiS out of power and install Donald Tusk to the prime minister’s office. Tusk, a former prime minister, emphasized LGBTQ and women’s rights during his campaign.\n\nPoland’s state-affiliated television station recently issued an on-air apology to the LGBTQ community for its past broadcasting of anti-LGBTQ propaganda in alignment with the PiS platform.\n\nThese developments are points of hope for a more inclusive future in Poland and a larger movement to restore liberal democracy.\n\nUnfortunately, for many members of the Polish LGBTQ community, these remedies come too late.\n\nWe urge members of legislatures at all levels to consider the potential impacts of anti-LGBTQ legislation before introducing them to the public. Some harms can’t be reversed.\n\nChad Meyerhoefer and Nic Johnson are on the faculty of Lehigh University, where Meyerhoefer is the Arthur F.

The recent near-miss assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump has exacerbated fears and heightened anxiety levels across the nation. We stand on the brink of a potential second Trump administration. With that as a looming storm, LGBTQ communities and those working in governmental agencies, think tanks, and nonprofits are grappling with a unique set of stressors that could impact their daily lives.\n\nThe LGBTQ community faces distinct challenges during periods of political instability. The prospect of policies that threaten hard-won rights and protections can trigger deep-seated fears and anxiety. As a psychotherapist, I see the noticeable uptick in clients seeking help for political anxiety. Clients express concerns about the future, safety, and the potential rollback of LGBTQ rights, reflecting a broader trend of heightened political stress that feels permanent.\n\nGrounding in Facts vs. Fear\n\nOne of the first steps in managing political anxiety is to ground oneself in facts rather than fear. The 24-hour news cycle and social media can amplify anxiety through sensationalist and fear-mongering content. I encourage readers to seek out reliable and diverse news sources. Staying informed with accurate information can help maintain a sense of control and perspective. It’s crucial to differentiate between legitimate concerns and exaggerated threats, allowing for a more balanced and less anxious outlook.\n\nStrengthening Community Ties\n\nDuring times of political uncertainty, the strength and unity of the community become paramount. For LGBTQ folks, fostering solidarity can be a powerful antidote to anxiety. Engaging positively with the community through volunteering, supporting local LGBTQ businesses, or attending events can reinforce a sense of belonging and mutual support. Building these connections not only provides emotional support but also strengthens the collective resilience against the inevitable moments of pain and struggle.\n\nThe importance of seeking professional mental health support cannot be overstated. Therapy can offer a safe space to explore fears, develop coping mechanisms, and prevent anxiety from taking a toll on daily life and overall well-being. Engaging with a trained professional can help individuals navigate their emotions and maintain mental health amidst political unknowns.\n\nIn these uncertain times, it is crucial to take proactive steps to safeguard our mental health. Grounding oneself in facts, strengthening community ties, and seeking professional mental health support are vital strategies in managing political anxiety. The LGBTQ community, along with allies, can face these challenges head-on through unity and strength. We are not alone even when it feels like we are.\n\nJason Nicholsen is a licensed psychotherapist at Within Reach Therapy, dedicated to serving the D.C. and Virginia areas during times of need.

There is no news about their fate. And the severity of repression and increased violence against LGBTQ people by the Taliban has, unfortunately, been away from international attention and their situation is deliberately ignored.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the Taliban over the last three years has published several rulings regarding the punishment of LGBTQ people for “lawat,” a reference to sexual relations between two men in Sharia law, and most punishments of LGBTQ people has taken place in public in five provinces: Kabul, Parwan, Sarpul, Zabul, and Kandahar.\n\nA court in the Saidkhel district of Parwan province on July 1 announced it had tried and punished four people for “lawat.”\n\nThe Supreme Court of the Taliban in a newsletter said the Seyed Kheli district’s primary court sentenced three defendants to a year in prison and 39 lashes. Another defendant received a 2-year sentence and 39 lashes.\n\nThe Taliban in June publicly punished dozens of LGBTQ people in Sarpul, Parwan, and Kabul provinces.\n\nSome of the LGBTQ people who the Taliban freed from their prisons told the Rainbow Afghanistan Organization that they were subjected to sexual exploitation, gang rape, and all kinds of torture, including electric shocks, physical beatings, and fingernail removal that caused severe pain and suffering.\n\nOn the other hand, the spreading of hatred and the issuing of harsh punishments for LGBTQ people by the Taliban is not hidden from public view. The Taliban, for example, continues to execute LGBTQ people by toppling walls on top of them.\n\nThe Taliban in May 2023 published a declaration that emphasized the implementation of Sharia law in Afghanistan. The Taliban issued dozens of final verdicts of “Islamic retribution and ‘hudud’” (“hudud” are Islamic penal codes under Sharia law) and punishments that included stoning. Four people were reportedly executed when walls fell on to them.\n\nGul Rahim, a Taliban judge, told the German newspaper Bild in July 2021, just before Afghanistan fell, there are “two punishments for homosexuals: Either stoned, or they have to stand behind a wall that falls on their head. The height of the wall should be 2.5 to 3 meters.”\n\nThe Taliban used this method to punish LGBTQ people when they were in power between 1996-2001.\n\nTaliban member Mohammad Khel said on Afghanistan International TV on March 28, 2024, that those who are of two sexes — and it is not clear whether they are male or female — should be killed immediately, should be killed tomorrow, and should have been killed yesterday. He continued the program host’s answer, and said he is a Muslim and the Quran has ordered him to kill. The Supreme Court of the Taliban two days before the interview ordered the flogging and punishment of an LGBTQ person in Khaf Sefid district in Farah province for “lawat.”\n\nLGBTQ people have always been excluded from U.N. Security Council declarations and resolutions, despite the Taliban’s public punishment of LGBTQ people and the Taliban’s increased violence against them.\n\nEach Security Council resolution — Resolution 2679, and Resolution 2721 — the U.N. Security Council adopted over the last three years has ignored LGBTQ Afghans.\n\nWe, the LGBTQ community of Afghanistan, see the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan has adopted this wrong approach, which has completely excluded the experiences of LGBTIQ people in its human rights reports from 2021 until now. This omission in UAMA reports for the past three years shows gender-based violence that LGBTQ Afghans face is being ignored.\n\nThe U.N. has unfortunately not adopted any new, more inclusive approaches in the implementation of its resolutions, declarations and meetings for Afghanistan; despite Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International’s declarations and concerns to the U.N. and the international community regarding the unfortunate situation of LGBTQ people and women in Afghanistan and requests to pay more attention to it. The U.N. and the international community always excludes a vulnerable group — such as the LGBTQ community, which experiences the most violence in Afghanistan and has been sidelined and ignored for years from all resolutions and declarations — and deliberately ignores their situation.\n\nThe U.N., the U.N. Security Council, and UNAMA’s disregard for the unfortunate situation of LGBTQ Afghans is a slap in the face to the concept of human rights in Afghanistan.\n\nLGBTQ Afghans today are bewildered that the same international community that championed free elections and LGBTQ rights is willing to compromise its own moral values to cave in to an extremist ideological group that represents an armed clerical regime that has established gender apartheid in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Taliban have succeeded in silencing the voices of LGBTQ people in Afghanistan by using repression, violence, torture, and punishment in public. The U.N. and others in the international community have given this opportunity to the Taliban and their supporters by ignoring the situation of LGBTQ people, by silencing the voice of the Afghan LGBTQ community outside of Afghanistan.\n\nWe, and Afghanistan’s LGBTQ community are deeply concerned about the Security Council and UNAMA’s neglect of these serious violations. We believe that what is happening in Afghanistan is a clear example of gender apartheid and human crime.\n\nWe condemn every U.N. meeting, declaration, and resolution on Afghanistan that excludes the LGBTQ community. We consider it a violation of the human rights charter.\n\nAli Tawakoli is an Afghan LGBTIQ rights activist and director and founder of the Rainbow Afghanistan Organization."
