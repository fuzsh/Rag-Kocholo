She emphasized the breaking of “prescribed reality” and how the film engages with these changing norms.\n\n“It’s kind of one of those things you don’t want to talk about too much because you want to be afforded the kind of gift of not having to hang a lantern on obvious things. Like not having to be the mouthpiece for notions that should be given the way that we take up space, who we are to ourselves, who we want to fuck. I don’t know, maybe don’t think about it. Maybe don’t consider that so deeply, man.\n\n“I’m so happy to be asked the question and then say, watch the movie. Instead of hearing me talk about being a girl or a boy… it feels like movies are kind of doing that for us ladies lately. It feels nice.”\n\nA Movie That Pushes Limits\n\nRose highlighted how Love Lies Bleeding blends thrilling elements with a love story at its core. The film doesn’t shy away from exploring dark themes, balancing them with the light of romance. According to Rose, love acts as the “guiding light,” steering the narrative through its twists and turns.\n\n“I knew I wanted there to be a lot of violence in it and I guess falling in love kind of brings up a lot of those sorts of feelings.”\n\nWhy Watch Love Lies Bleeding?\n\nLove Lies Bleeding isn’t just a film; it’s a statement. With its bold take on love, identity, and self-expression, it encourages viewers to question and cross the boundaries set by society. As Kristen passionately advised, “watch the movie” to see a reflection of contemporary discussions about gender and identity.\n\nLove Lies Bleeding promises to be a cinematic journey that resonates with today’s audiences, from its vibrant characters to the pressing themes it explores.\n\nA Cheeky and Insightful Chat\n\nThe interview with the cast of Love Lies Bleeding was not just entertaining but also enlightening, offering a glimpse into the minds behind the characters.
