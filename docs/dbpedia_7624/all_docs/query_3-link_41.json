        "text": "Filipino director Quark Henares’ return to the director’s chair with this year’s “Where is the Lie?” (Filipino: ‘Marupok AF’) begins with a title card to inform the audiences that the movie was inspired by true events. In true Henares fashion, though, a follow-up appears at the bottom.\n\n“…depending on who’s telling the story.”\n\nThe movie follows the story of Janzen Torres (EJ Jallorina), a transwoman who couldn’t seem to get out of a funk as far as romantic relationships are concerned. Vignettes show Janzen sharing the whole short cycle of her relationship with a recent boyfriend—from social media posts depicting euphoria in romance to the ugly-crying denial stage post-breakup.\n\nSwiping through a dating app one night, as is her wont, Janzen matches with a man named Theo Balmaceda (Royce Cabrera). Finding in Theo a perfect, all-around guy who seems to have taken a genuine interest in her, Janzen feels the rush of blood to the head. For her, it’s her chance at last for the one true love that has seemed to elude her in the past.\n\nFor a jaded mind, this has the makings of ‘catfishing’ written all over the wall, in shouty, bloody capitals. Janzen, however, seems to have missed the memo. Alibis after alibis, punctuated by Theo’s ghosting of her on the day of their meetup, finally drive Janzen to do a deeper search on who Theo really is.\n\nBut does he exist in the first place? Is someone else behind the deceit, lies, and catfishing?\n\nOn the Pervasive Perils of Online Dating\n\nEven when the act had a proper name, we can trace ‘catfishing’ way back in time. A Vice article even stated that as early as 1837, lies and deceit were already on the table if those meant a woman could win over a hopeless romantic man.\n\n‘Where is the Lie?’ lays everything out in plain sight for tis protagonist to see. Unfortunately, Janzen is lovestruck as heck that she couldn’t differentiate her left hand from the right even if her life depended on it.\n\n“He shows you one good quality, [and]you love him right away?” Her friends try to talk sense to her; especially given her history of falling for the wrong men and by hastily jumping the gun on other occasions.\n\nBut as one knows, once emotions take over, logic takes a backseat, and ultimately escapes through the rear door. As audiences, we get to share with the frustration.\n\nRelated Read: ‘Bad Match’ and ‘Love Hard’ Both Wrestle with the Perils of Online Dating. But who Delivers Better Punches?\n\n‘Where is the Lie?’: A Film Based on a Real-Life Story\n\nIn 2020, a Twitter post gained traction when the poster recounted in a long thread how she got catfished. That viral post caught the eyes of Henares and the filmmakers, who decided to make a movie based on it. In fact, several details and elements of the story in the Twitter post made it to the film, save for the names of the characters, which the filmmakers changed out of respect.\n\nANIMA Studios, the film’s production company, hopes that ‘Where is the Lie?’ would shed light on the importance of a community coming together in real time to protect the victim and hold the perpetrators accountable.\n\nThe makers of this movie acknowledge that the LGBTQIA+ community remains a target of constant bullying in the Philippines. Add to this that there’s no law currently in place in the country that penalizes a catfisher, and the struggle for the community continues not only in the real world, but also in the virtual realm.\n\nOn the Film’s Merits and Whatnot\n\nThere’s so much to like about ‘Where is the Lie?’ that it becomes an enjoyable, if at times tonally uneven, cautionary tale about the dangers of whirlwind relationships, especially in today’s technology-driven world.\n\nThe film understands the importance of telling the whole story, and its attempt to tell the story in three narrative points of view might be a little jarring at first. Eventually, though, audiences would warm to the “she said, they said” approach of the movie’s storytelling.\n\nOn the other hand, Henares’ decision to base the film on a serious topic that hits close to home for many people and make it a dark comedy might be a mixed bag—in fact it adds to the tonal shifts that take the audience’s attention away.\n\nNevertheless, at its core, ‘Where is the Lie?’ is a gentle film that focuses on one’s insistence of wearing rose-tinted glasses because they make her feel special. By doing so, however, all the red flags she’s supposed to spot from the get-go end up looking just like any other flag.\n\nBecause, as Janzen herself reflects at the end of the movie, “I hope we all find what we’re looking for.\n\n“Don’t we all?”\n\n‘Where is the Lie?’ had its world premier at the Breakouts selection in this year’s Slamdance Film Festival."
