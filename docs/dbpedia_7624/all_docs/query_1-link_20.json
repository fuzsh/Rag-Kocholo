        "text": "This post is updated regularly as movies leave and enter Hulu. *New additions are indicated with an asterisk.\n\nStill considered largely a streaming service for television fans, Hulu has struggled to carve out its own reputation as a home for movie lovers too. To that end, they have become one of the most prominent supporters of recent arthouse cinema, particularly critical darlings like The Banshees of Inisherin, Broker, All of Us Strangers, and more. They also have an interesting revolving door of beloved recent films of all genres, mostly from 2010 and beyond. Take the time you were going to use to catch up on your latest sitcom and check out one of the films below in this list that will be updated as titles come and go, starting with our pick of the week.\n\nThis Week’s Critic’s Pick\n\n*Raising Arizona\n\nYear: 1987\n\nRuntime: 1h 34m\n\nDirector: Joel Coen\n\nLong before they won Oscars, Joel and Ethan Coen made one of the best comedies of the ‘80s about a babynapping. Of course, this Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter vehicle is about way more than the stealing of one of the Arizona children. It’s about redemption, maturity, partnership, and, of course, the advice to not put a panty on your head. It’s also somehow even funnier now than it was when it was released.\n\nHow We Pick Our Films\n\nCritic Brian Tallerico watches and writes about movies and TV every day. To curate this list, he dives into Hulu’s catalogue to surface acclaimed, surprising, or otherwise noteworthy titles — using his taste and a lifetime of cinema study as his guide, instead of whatever the algorithm happens to be pushing. After triple-checking to make sure they’re still available, he watches each, organizes them by category, then writes his recommendation. We highlight more than just Oscar winners or popcorn flicks: These films present interesting ideas, made an impact on cinema, and changed our culture. Read on to find something to watch.\n\nDrama\n\nAll of Us Strangers\n\nYear: 2023\n\nRuntime: 1h 45m\n\nDirector: Andrew Haigh\n\nOne of the best films of 2023 is exclusively available on Hulu thanks to the relationship between the company and Fox Searchlight—both owned by Disney, essentially. Andrew Scott is stunning as a man who essentially travels in time to visit the parents (Jamie Bell & Claire Foy) who died when he was young, all while starting a relationship with one of his neighbors (Paul Mescal). Imagine getting to say what you never could to those you lost and allowing them a chance to see how you’ve changed too. It’s a beautiful, moving piece of work.\n\nAnatomy of a Fall\n\nYear: 2023\n\nRuntime: 2h 31m\n\nDirector: Justine Triet\n\nThe latest Oscar winner for Best Original Screenplay is already exclusively on Hulu thanks to their relationship with Neon. The great Sandra Huller stars as a woman whose husband dies from a fall at their home. Was it suicide or murder? More than a mere courtroom drama, this is a dissection of a marriage that’s raw, brutal, and real.\n\nFerrari\n\nYear: 2023\n\nRuntime: 2h 10m\n\nDirector: Michael Mann\n\nMichael Mann’s first film in eight years wasn’t given nearly the theatrical attention it deserved, which means people can now catch up with it on Hulu! A masterful dissection of obsession and ego, Ferrari stars Adam Driver as Enzo Ferrari, captured here in 1957 as he juggles a collapsing personal life with a drive to win the 1957 Mille Miglia. Driver is underrated here, but that’s because Penelope Cruz drives off with the movie, giving one of the best performances of the last few years.\n\nMaster Gardener\n\nYear: 2023\n\nRuntime: 1h 47m\n\nDirector: Paul Schrader\n\nOscar nominee and living legend Paul Schrader closes out a trilogy about lost men (with First Reformed and The Card Counter) in this underrated drama starring Joel Edgerton and Sigourney Weaver. Edgerton plays Narvel Roth, a horticulturist for a wealthy woman played by Weaver. He falls for her grandniece, who struggles with Narvel’s former identity as a White supremacist. Of course, it ends in violence, but Schrader is more interested in recovery than vengeance this time.\n\nNomadland\n\nYear: 2020\n\nRuntime: 1h 48m\n\nDirector: Chloe Zhao\n\nThe Oscar winner for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actress, this 2020 drama is one of the most moving films of the young decade so far, and it’s exclusively on Hulu thanks to the company’s relationship with Fox Searchlight (they’re both owned by Disney). Frances McDormand stars as Fern, a woman displaced by the loss of her husband and job, sending her out on the road. Blending non-fiction filmmaking choices like the use of non-actors telling their own stories with a deep sense of character-building, this is a phenomenal film.\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\n\nYear: 2019\n\nRuntime: 2h 42m\n\nDirector: Quentin Tarantino\n\nIt’s hard to believe it’s already been almost a half-decade since Quentin Tarantino’s last movie, one of the last greats of the 2010s. Wildly misunderstood during production (and even a bit after release), it’s way more than just a reclamation of the Sharon Tate murders, it’s a funny, scary, smart alternate version of Hollywood history with some of the career-best performances from Leonardo DiCaprio, Margot Robbie, and Oscar winner Brad Pitt.\n\nOrigin\n\nYear: 2023\n\nRuntime: 2h 21m\n\nDirector: Ava DuVernay\n\nNeon inexplicably buried this movie at the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024, which means most Hulu subscribers probably haven’t seen it. Correct that oversight. The director of Selma daringly adapts Isabel Wilkerson’s Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents in a new way, essentially unpacking the themes of the non-fiction book through a feature film about the research that went into it. Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor is stunning as Wilkerson in a film that provokes conversation more than nearly anything on Hulu.\n\nPoor Things\n\nYear: 2023\n\nRuntime: 2h 21m\n\nDirector: Yorgos Lanthimos\n\nEmma Stone took home a second Oscar for her fearless portrayal of a Bella Baxter in the latest mindfuck from the director of The Lobster and The Favourite. Bella is the Frankenstein-esque creation of a mad scientist (Willem Dafoe), who teaches her the way of the world, until she discovers sex and her own identity. Visually stunning, it’s like nothing else on Hulu. Or anywhere really.\n\nThe Promised Land\n\nYear: 2024\n\nRuntime: 2h 7m\n\nDirector: Nikolaj Arcel\n\nDanish filmmaker Arcel introduced this film at TIFF by saying that his country doesn’t usually get to make epics like this one. The truth is that no one makes historical, David Lean-inspired period pieces with this kind of impressive scope anymore. The fantastic Mads Mikkelsen stars as a retired Danish officer who is forced into action by a corrupt magistrate who is basically trying to take his land.\n\n*Rachel Getting Married\n\nYear: 2008\n\nRuntime: 1h 53m\n\nDirector: Jonathan Demme\n\nJonathan Demme’s character drama contains arguably Anne Hathaway’s best performance as Kym, a recovering alcoholic dealing with trauma over the course of her sister Rachel’s wedding weekend. This is a beautiful film, full of both joy and regret, and anchored by Demme’s deep humanism and skill with performers. It’s one of the best films of the ‘00s.\n\n*Zero Dark Thirty\n\nYear: 2012\n\nRuntime: 2h 37m\n\nDirector: Kathryn Bigelow\n\nIts legacy has been a bit tarnished by history, but there’s no denying the craft at work in Kathryn Bigelow’s retelling of the hunt for Osama bin Laden, featuring one of the career-best performances from Jessica Chastain. Bigelow reunited with her The Hurt Locker writer, Mark Boal, to detail how the United States caught one of history’s most vile murderers in a film that was nominated for Best Picture, Best Actress, and Best Original Screenplay.\n\nDocumentaries\n\nBad Axe\n\nYear: 2022\n\nRuntime: 1h 42m\n\nDirector: David Siev\n\nThis charming documentary about a family living in Michigan during the pandemic and all the things that came after it is one of the most empathetic and moving pieces of filmmaking about the 2020s to date. The Siev family own a family restaurant in Michigan, but it threatens to go under after the restrictions put in place by the pandemic. That is followed by divisions within the community that arise during the Black Lives Matter movement that same summer. Bad Axe is a phenomenal piece of work that you probably haven’t seen.\n\nSummer of Soul\n\nYear: 2021\n\nRuntime: 1h 58m\n\nDirector: Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson\n\nIt’s unfair how talented Questlove is. The drummer for The Roots proved to have an incredible touch with documentaries, too, when this future Oscar winner premiered at Sundance 2022, where it won the Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award. It’s the story of the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival, an unforgettable display of creativity and passion that was almost forgotten, the footage buried in a basement for generations. Watch this one loud.\n\nComedy\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin\n\nYear: 2022\n\nRuntime: 1h 54m\n\nDirector: Martin McDonagh\n\nOne of the best films of 2022 and a multiple Oscar nominee last year, this dark comedy is already on streaming services, less than a year after its release. Colin Farrell does career-best work as a hapless Irishman who discovers that his best friend, played by Brendan Gleeson, doesn’t want to talk to him anymore. A film about how neighbors become enemies feels particularly timely in the currently fractured world, and this one is brilliant, funny, and moving.\n\nForce Majeure\n\nYear: 2014\n\nRuntime: 2h\n\nDirector: Ruben Ostlund\n\nForget that mediocre remake with Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Will Ferrell, just stick with this 2014 dramedy about a man who makes a very bad decision when the life of his family is threatened by an avalanche. Instead of trying to save them, he flees in the other direction, and it changes everything in his marriage and family from that day forward. Funny and insightful, this is a great movie.\n\nRye Lane\n\nYear: 2023\n\nRuntime: 1h 22m\n\nDirector: Raine Allen Miller\n\nThe best romantic comedy in years premiered at Sundance in January 2023 and is now on Hulu. David Jonsson and Vivian Oparah star in a film that’s reminiscent of Before Sunrise in the way it captures two people meeting and walking through a city as they slowly fall in love. Heartbroken, creative people, these characters are so incredibly likable in this film that has a sharp, brilliant screenplay, and stunning use of setting. The world around these people comes so vibrantly to life that it almost feels like a character.\n\nTriangle of Sadness\n\nYear: 2022\n\nRuntime: 2h 29m\n\nDirector: Ruben Ostlund\n\nA Best Picture nominee and Palme d’Or winner, Triangle of Sadness is the one of the biggest international critical darlings of 2022. From the writer/director of Force Majeure, this is the story of a model couple on a boat trip from Hell, a journey that goes so disastrously wrong that social lines are blurred forever. It’s a sharp commentary on the haves and have-nots with fun performances from Harris Dickinson, Dolly de Leon, Woody Harrelson, and more.\n\nThe Worst Person in the World\n\nYear: 2021\n\nRuntime: 2h 8m\n\nDirector: Joachim Trier\n\nThe partnership between Neon and Hulu continues to pay off for subscribers as the streamer is the exclusive home of one of the most acclaimed films of 2021 in this Best Original Screenplay and Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nominee. Renate Reinsve is stunning as a young woman named Julie who navigates career, love, and life in a film that’s funny, moving, and true.\n\nHorror\n\nCrimes of the Future\n\nYear: 2022\n\nRuntime: 1h 47m\n\nDirector: David Cronenberg\n\nThe master of body horror returned to the form for the first time in a generation and delivered one of the most mesmerizing films of 2022. Viggo Mortensen plays a man in a future where evolution has gone awry, creating new organs in human bodies. His is particularly active, and it draws the attention of characters played by Kristen Stewart and Lea Seydoux. It’s a fascinating film. You won’t be able to turn away.\n\n*The First Omen\n\nYear: 2024\n\nRuntime: 1h 59m\n\nDirector: Arkasha Stevenson\n\nThere’s no reason for The First Omen to be as good as it is. First off, most studio horror films don’t take anywhere near the kind of risks that this daring genre flick takes. Second, horror prequels are very rarely good. Nell Tiger Free (Servant) plays an American novitiate in Rome who discovers a vile plan to bring the antichrist to life. With stunning use of practical effects and an incredible lead performance, director Arkasha Stevenson crafted one of the best horror films of the 2020s.\n\nGet Out\n\nYear: 2017\n\nRuntime: 1h 45m\n\nDirector: Jordan Peele\n\nThis is the one that really changed the current state of horror, reminding studios how acclaimed and popular it could be if treated with the right respect. It also won its creator an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, launching one of the most interesting careers of the current era. It’s held up remarkably well, and it’s hardly ever available on streaming services, so take this chance while you can to rewatch a movie whose influence is still shaking the industry.\n\nAction\n\n*Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes\n\nYear: 2024\n\nRuntime: 2h 25m\n\nDirector: Wes Ball\n\nThe director of Maze Runner picks up the saga of Planet of the Apes for the start of another planned trilogy of films to continue the brilliance of Rise/Dawn/War. Set a couple centuries after the end of that last trilogy, Kingdom is a world in which different ape factions are fighting for dominance, most of them using the teachings of Caesar as a guide. When a young ape (voiced perfectly by Owen Teague) meets a human (Freya Allen), they discover they may have common goals. It’s a smart, ambitious blockbuster filmmaking that’s exclusively on Hulu.\n\nTrue Lies\n\nYear: 1994\n\nRuntime: 2h 21m\n\nDirector: James Cameron\n\nRemember when James Cameron made kick-ass action movie that weren’t set on Pandora? Those were the days. Cameron directed Arnold Schwarzenegger in this influential action pic about a family man who also happens to be a G-man. Co-starring Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Arnold, and Bill Paxton, it’s a perfectly paced film that’s easy to watch over and over again.\n\nFor Kids\n\nThe Fantastic Mr. Fox\n\nYear: 2009\n\nRuntime: 1h 28m\n\nDirector: Wes Anderson\n\nThe director of The Royal Tenenbaums and The Grand Budapest Hotel adapted the 1970 children’s novel of the same name in this delightful stop-motion animated classic with one of the best voice casts in history. George Clooney, Meryl Steep, Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe, and Owen Wilson star in the tale of the titular character as his family is hunted by three farmers. It’s a visual marvel for the whole family.\n\nIf you subscribe to a service through our links, Vulture may earn an affiliate commission."
