        "text": "Movie Review\n\n“We didn’t know that the world was big, that it was different from us.”\n\nWhen Mamere, his friends Jeremiah and Paul, and his sister Abital were little, all they knew was their tiny village—a collection of dirt-floor huts and a livestock pen or two. But then the war came. Their families were killed by soldiers. Their huts burned to the ground. And as they hid and barely escaped with their lives, this group of frightened, weeping children was suddenly made aware that there was indeed something else out there.\n\nAnd sometimes that something is horrible.\n\nNow, more than a decade later, the makeshift family these children have formed is heading toward another something that’s big, different, but this time hopefully good: a place called America. It’s all part of a resettlement effort that plucks handfuls of the homeless, dubbed “Lost Boys,” out of thousands in the refugee camps, giving them hope for a new beginning.\n\nAll of them are grateful. Together they praise God for His blessings. And even when they learn the sad news that Abital must go to a village called Boston while they head to one called Kansas City, they stay positive. “I will go to school and work very hard,” Mamere promises his sister. And they vow to reunite soon.\n\nAmerica is indeed a strange but wonderful place. It’s a land of cars, busses and huge buildings full of individual … huts? Each room has a switch on the wall that causes lights to shine in the dead of night. “Phones” ring out alarms of some urgent need, but the brothers aren’t sure of what quite yet. There are tubs that fill with warm water, large enough for a man to sit in and clean himself. And there not a single lion to be leery of, even in the open pastures.\n\nIn this land of plenty there are also white people who give of themselves to help. Carrie is one such person. She is helping the three Sudanese transplants find “jobs.” And she helps Mamere begin school so that someday he can be a doctor. She’s a wonderful woman who can survive on her own, even without a husband!\n\nMamere is impressed with her great skills. Jeremiah and Paul both agree that they should give her the vaunted name of Yaardit—which in English translates, roughly, to “Great White Cow.”\n\nPositive Elements\n\nThe men mean this, of course, as a term of respect. And though some of their fish-out-of-water actions are played for a laugh, it’s the first-world-vs.-third-world cultural differences that are chuckle-worthy, not the men themselves. Mamere and Co. are always portrayed as sincere, earnest, appreciative and godly: individuals who deserve help and respect as they shoulder their burdens of adjusting to this new world.\n\nIn fact, it’s Carrie and some other Americans, such as Jack, her boss, who come off as a tad callous at times. But that changes as the cultural barriers fall. Carrie eventually becomes so attached to the guys that she goes quite far out of her way to help them circumnavigate yards of governmental red tape and reconnect with Abital.\n\nThese Sudanese guys are always ready to help one another and those around them—from pooling resources to send Mamere to school, to offering orange slices to strangers on the public bus. When they first head to America, Paul gives his shoes to a friend who remains behind. Jeremiah gets a job in a local market and begins giving away old discardable food to the homeless rather than throwing it out. He quits the job when his boss complains about what he’s doing, saying, “‘Tis a sin not to give to those in need.” When the guys first meet an American police officer, Mamere quickly tells him, “We appreciate any person who puts his life at risk to uphold the law. God bless you.”\n\nAs children, Mamere and his friends struggle mightily—sharing whatever they find, binding one another’s wounds and even carrying the weak when needed—in an attempt to get as many as possible to a place of safety. Forced to drink urine to stay alive, they still give a dying man some of what little gathered food they have.\n\nDuring his studies of Mark Twain’s writings, Mamere learns about “good lies,” untruths told to help others. He realizes that as children, this is what his older brother Theo did to save him. Theo stood up and lied about who he was—getting taken away by vicious soldiers in the process—in order to protect the others who were hiding. Ultimately Mamere makes a similar choice to sacrifice his advancement for another family member’s well-being."
