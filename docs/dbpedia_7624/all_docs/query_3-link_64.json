        "text": "The Farewell is based on actual events drawn from the life and experience of writer and director Lulu Wang. After writing the script Wang struggled to finance the film because of the Mandarin dialogue, the all-Asian cast and the unconventional narrative. Both American and Chinese investors were confused about the target audience: Was this film for Chinese or American viewers? It was only after Wang scripted her story for radio and presented it on This American Life that she found a producer interested in helping her get the funds together to shoot the film.\n\nListen to “What you don’t know”, the story Wang told in an episode of This American Life.\n\nTo get an idea of the challenges Wang faced getting her film financed, check out some of the interviews she gave when The Farewell was first released.\n\nWang speaks Chinese fluently but does not write it, so she wrote her script in English and then had it translated into Mandarin. However, in the process of being translated, the story lost its naturalness and authenticity and Wang asked her parents to make it more conversational and real: “They were of great help because they not only know the language, they also know all the real people involved and what they sound like in real life.\"\n\nWatch Lulu Wang’s fascinating account of the complexities of writing a Chinese script without being able to read or write Chinese. (You will also learn how a script is formatted in Chinese.)\n\nNora Lum/Awkwafina who plays the main character, Billi, does not speak Chinese fluently and her character’s limited vocabulary and stilted speech became one of the ways that her struggle with her Chinese identity was communicated.\n\nThe Farewell is set in both New York and Changchun. Changchun is the actual city that Lulu Wang’s grandparents come from and where she spent time living with them when she was a child. Wang and her team initially thought it would be easier to film in Beijing, but they decided the changing cityscape of Changchun is so central to the story the film needed to be made there. Wang filmed scenes inside and outside her real-life grandmother’s actual apartment, the cemetery scene took place at her grandfather’s grave and the wedding banquet was filmed at the same venue as her cousin’s actual wedding.\n\nFind out more about Changchun:\n\nFor Lulu Wang, the story is ultimately about accepting different approaches and perspectives:\n\n“It's about having the strength to have your own opinions, but also having the grace to acknowledge that others have theirs.\"\n\nNote down visual elements:\n\nthe use of light and colour\n\ndifferent shot choices\n\nand the way that people are positioned in the shot\n\nthe way that people are positioned in relation to each other\n\nthe actors’ facial expressions, gestures and movements\n\nDo you think the trailer does a good job of communicating what the film is about? Explain your answer.\n\nLulu Wang has worked very hard to publicise her film and has given many great interviews that provide further background to the story she is telling and the creative decisions she made as writer-director.\n\nTo learn more about how Wang created the look and feel of The Farewell through lighting and camera choices, read to the end of this in-depth article.\n\nRead this article to find out about the thinking behind the scene that takes place outside Nǎinai’s apartment the day after Billi arrives."
