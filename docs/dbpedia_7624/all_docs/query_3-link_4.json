        "text": "The 1945 film noir Detour is told from the perspective of an unreliable protagonist who may be trying to justify his actions.\n\nThis movie is the best case of use of an Unreliable Narrator, which upon repeated viewings increases the charm of the movie.\n\nThe 1995 film The Usual Suspects reveals that the narrator had been deceiving the characters in the movie, and hence the audience, by the story he is telling. The character Keyser Soze has something to do with the unreliable narrative.\n\nIn Rashômon (1950), a Japanese crime drama film directed by Akira Kurosawa, adapted from \"In a Grove\" (1921), uses multiple narrators to tell the story of the death of a samurai. Each of the witnesses describe the same basic events but differ wildly in the details, alternately claiming that the samurai died by accident, suicide, or murder. The term \"Rashômon effect\" is used to describe how different witnesses are able to produce contradictory accounts of the same event, though each version is presented with equal sincerity and each is plausible when considered independently of the others. The film does not select the \"authentic\" narrator from the differing accounts: at its conclusion, all versions remain equally plausible and equally suspect.\n\nThe 1950 Alfred Hitchcock film Stage Fright (1950) uses the device of unreliable narration by presenting the aftermath of a murder in a flashback, as told by the murderer. The details of the flashback provide an explanation which helps convince the innocent main protagonist of the film to help the murderer, believing him innocent.\n\nIn Possessed (1947), Joan Crawford plays a woman who is taken to a psychiatric hospital in a state of shock. She gradually tells the story of how she came to be there to her doctors, which is related to the audience in flashbacks, some of which are later revealed to be hallucinations or distorted by paranoia\n\nIn the movie version of Forrest Gump (1994), the title character narrates his life story, and in the process naïvely refers to Apple Computer as a \"fruit company\" while also assuming that sustaining a \"million dollar wound\" meant that one would get paid for it. He also states that Jenny's dad treated her well because \"he was always kissing and touching her and her sisters.\"\n\nIn the 2002 film Hero, the protagonist is identified as an unreliable narrator by the antagonist, who responds by constructing his own alternate version of the false story. In the last part of the film, the protagonist tells the real story, which explains his presence in the current situation.\n\nPatrick Bateman makes \"Money's\" John Self look even more out of shape, when it comes to commenting on the big brands and applying his murderous hands to the unsuspecting and the vulnerable. Yet Ellis's great comment on consumerism and the death of high culture could just be a mirror to our own deluded thoughts, and Bateman nothing more than a sickly funny fantasist.\n\nIn the 2013 film The Lone Ranger the narrator, Tonto (Johnny Depp), is identified quickly as potentially unreliable by a child attending a 1930s carnival sideshow during extensive questioning about the events leading to the origin of the Wild West character the child emulates. The child is wearing the costume identified with the fictional Western hero of radio, comics, films, and television. The events related by the narrator vaguely follow an alternative version of character development that occurred during its radio dramas and the beginning of its television series, but with novel disclosures of graphic details that occur as a series of flashbacks portraying the elderly Tonto's memories of the events. Along with the child, the audience is left to make their own judgments about the memories of Tonto.\n\nThe title Amarcord apparently translates in Roman dialect as \"I Remember\", yet this chaotic film is in no way a straightforward recollection of childhood experiences. As Fellini himself once commented: \"My films from my past, recount memories that are completely invented.\" The scatological jokes about belching, and farting coexist with an air of melancholy that's maintained by Nino Rota's evocative music. Fellini constantly draws our attention to the fact that we're watching a piece of fiction: the residents' stories are far from reliable, actors deliver their lines to camera, and the elderly narrator (Luigi Rossi) is interrupted by off-screen disruptions.\n\nAs William retraces his father's steps, revisiting his old stomping grounds and seeking out witnesses to what may or may not have happened, the truth is revealed to be anything but the simple black-and-white affair that any of us expected. What William discovers is that even his father's most over-arching conceits and purely fantastic fictions contain an essence of truth, an essence more valuable than what might be gleaned from a more literal version. Dad, of course, was right: reality is overrated. And all of those impossibly tall tales told over the course of the movie eventually come to resemble some enormous, sweet onion, with endless layers of story to be peeled away before getting to a core of meaning.\n\nThe deranged mind in Caligari was revealed through flashback. Cinema moving backwards and forward in time, a quantum leap that thrust the oneiric engagement of the viewer within the frame of flickering images from passive observer to a participant who must engage actively in constructing a narrative. The revealed unreliability of the narrative throwing the viewer into an abyss of incomprehension and confusion in movies like Un Chien Andolou. A fractured kaleidoscope where meaning is continually undone and rewoven before the audience’s eyes.\n\nWe watch this story through the eyes of Marie (Cécile de France), who goes to stay with Alex (Maïwenn) and her family in a remote French house.\n\nWhich is when a serial killer turns up.\n\nSpoiler :- In the film's shocking final twist, Marie is revealed as the serial killer – she merely created a separate persona in her mind to carry out her killings.\n\nIn this classic Agatha Christi story there are multiple unreliable narratives. The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was hailed as a cornerstone in the genre and is still known as “one of the most influential crime novels ever written,” as said by Howard Haycraft in 1941.\n\nIs it a ghost story, or the tragic tale of a young woman undergoing a breakdown? Believing her two young charges are communing with the spirits of her two dead predecessors, the prim governess of Bly House becomes increasingly panic-stricken and erratic, until she's left with a dead boy in her arms.\n\nRight at the start we're told that Marlow likes to spin yarns. However, his tale of journeying up the Congo, in search first of ivory, and then the infamous Kurtz, is one of the most powerful stories in literature. Whether his story is strictly faithful becomes irrelevant, as Marlow ends up highlighting the moral corruption at the heart of all humans."
