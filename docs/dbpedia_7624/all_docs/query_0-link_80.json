        "meta_description": "The Vietnam War has been dubbed the world’s first “television war”. No war had been broadcast as widely before, leading to numerous documentaries both during and after the war. Moreover, no war has triggered as much protest from civilians around the world, which also generated a number of films that documented these protest movements. At first sight Tell Me Lies may seem one of them, documenting some of the counterculture movement in the UK at the end of the 1960s. However the film is quite unique in both subject and formal approach. As its subtitle “A film about London” indicates, the film is not so much about Vietnam as about the impact that news and images of a war can have on the lives of ordinary people in a country far removed yet indirectly involved in the conflict. The film’s originality also lies in its kaleidoscopic aesthetics, blending documentary techniques with fiction, the immediacy of newsreels and pieces to camera with musical interludes, staged performances, Brechtian “alienation effects” and self-reflexive comments. Interestingly the film was based on Peter Brook’s own play US (1966), which caused quite a stir among the audience. However, Brook did not want to just ‘adapt’ his play for the screen but wanted to find purely cinematographic devices to achieve the same effect, which he defined as “confrontation”. This paper aims to analyse how Tell Me Lies not only provides a challenging reflection about the power of art and film in particular to represent the horrors of war, but also questions how to mediate the emotional impact that these representations can have.",

        "text": "11 Text accompanying the disk of the film’s musical soundtrack, USA edition, 1968.\n\nOur aim is to present as sharply, strikingly and deeply as possible the Vietnam war quite precisely as it is reflected by Londoners living their lives today. We want to follow very closely the factors that make a horror like Vietnam both a burning issue and yet one easy to lay aside. This is not a documentary on Vietnam, it does not try to explore the causes or the course of the war in south east Asia. The filmmakers of the film did not want to go for sequences to Vietnam. They wanted to photograph the problem where it exists for most people – at home – and raise the questions in the only field where they are applicable – at home.\n\n5This chapter aims to analyse the thematic and aesthetic originality of Tell Me Lies. I will first expound the genesis of the film which accounts for much of its specificity. Then I will examine how the film addresses its central contention of confronting the viewers. To do so, I will focus on one picture in particular that not only opens and closes the film but for me is emblematic of the film’s overall conception as performative.\n\nFrom Stage to Screen\n\n26 Albert Hunt, “Narrative One,” in Peter Brook et al., Playscript 9, US, 12-30, 23, my emphasis.\n\nBrook had said, again and again, that we must somehow find a language of communication that went beyond our deadened responses to the newsreels and television documentaries. Yet how could these actors begin to compete with those shots of the children whose faces had been turned to crust? All we had to offer in this show was ourselves – ourselves in London, not being burnt with jellied petrol. We – or rather the actors – could not convincingly simulate bombed villagers. They could only confront a particular audience on a particular night with their own, unblistered body. Whatever was communicated finally would come, not through a skillful imitation of pain, but through that confrontation.\n\n10Brook’s play US thus combined techniques of agit-prop, physical and verbatim theatre, punctuated by satirical songs reminiscent of Joan Littlewood’s theatre workshop and her famous musical satire against the First World War Oh, What Lovely War! It consisted in a series of tableaux evoking the history of Vietnam, the official discourse of the U.S military command at press conferences, testimonies from ordinary GIs, forms of protest against the draft in the US, the staging of the self-immolation of a Buddhist monk in Saigon and of the American Norman Morrison in front of the Pentagon. It concluded by the provocative image of the burning of what appeared to the public to be a butterfly (actually a piece of paper after the release of actual butterflies). Then in a prolonged silence, the actors remained silent and motionless on the stage until the last of the spectators had departed. The play received very mixed reviews, some saluting its urgency and audacity, many others regretting it did not offer any elucidations on the issues at stake or any clear standpoint.\n\nConfronting the Viewers\n\n13However, it soon appears that this narrative line in the documentary mode is just one element within the film design. In order to achieve the confrontation that Peter Brook was aiming for in his play, the film uses a series of disruptive effects that give viewers recurrent jolts and ultimately creates an unstable position for the spectators. The first shock is certainly the most effective. As the main protagonist Mark is browsing a magazine, the next shot discloses his point of view with an insert of the photograph he is looking at [2:59]. The picture itself is arresting: a mother and her child are sitting on a bed in a hospital, the child’s head entirely bandaged except for the eyes and the mouth which appears as a gaping wound in the middle of his/her burnt face. First introduced as a point-of-view shot in the economy of the narrative, the insert, because of the harrowing nature of the photograph, its frontal view and the length of the shot, departs from the inner circulation of gazes within the diegesis to involve the spectators themselves.\n\n15But the spectators’ position is challenged further, beyond the duration of the insert of a still photograph, however harrowing it may be, when the picture is reincorporated into the flow of film. It first creates a very disturbing contrast in tone when the photograph overlaps with a jazz tune that introduces the first musical interlude [3:06], showcasing the artificiality of performance and therefore of the film itself, thus reminding the spectators of their status of image consumer.\n\n16Then another shock effect occurs when, at the end of the sequence, the still photograph starts moving [5:33]. The sideration that usually accompanies freeze frames is here inversed. The moving image restores an immediacy of presentation that its status as photographic evidence of the past may obliterate. Moreover, movement retrieves the picture from any iconic status like, at least for western spectators, a Madonna with her martyred child. It reinstates vulnerability into the image that its status as representation would avoid engaging. But it also provokes a troubling reversal of perspective: when movement resumes, the life that it mimics appears monstrous and even deadly, the shot ending on the extreme close up of the gaping mouth of the disfigured child – as if frozen again in a silent scream [5:44].\n\nExposing the Tensions and Limits of the Medium\n\n19Most significantly, the same picture of the mother and her burnt child occurs again near the end of the film. Once again, the shot is a striking one, with the photograph appearing projected on Mark’s stomach after he has pulled up his shirt [1:22:49]. The photograph is literally embodied, turned into flesh and blood, evoking the uncanny apparition of a Christic face on a living shroud. At the same time the scene comments on how the image has been incorporated into the film itself, epitomising its shock-inducing collage of incompatible regimes of expression. What is also striking is that this scene of introjected embodiment, conveying physical and ethical acknowledgement of the pain of others, occurs in what is the most abstract sequence of the film, in which bodies in a nightclub are transfigured through psychedelic lighting and fast editing. What becomes unbearable is no longer the image of suffering itself but the fact it is used to create an aesthetic effect as well.\n\n21The result is a highly reflexive narrative which constantly draws attention to the artificiality of its filmic construction, which in turn challenges the viewers’ participation in the film’s consumption. This acute self-reflexivity may at times seem self-indulgent, as when one of the technicians, playing the part of an injured GI, is lying on a hospital bed and looking at a monitor in which he is “watching himself watching himself.” [1:19:49] However, the two technicians, who look like a Stoppardian Laurel-and-Hardy-like couple or Pirandello characters in search of a meaning, are first and foremost mirror-images of the audience. Throughout the film, they are shown popping up out of nowhere to provide metafictional comments on the film itself. In their first apparition, they actually question the very nature of the film, looking straight at the camera after a wipe effect that suggests they have inversed the filmic apparatus outside in. To one of the characters’ question, which then becomes the viewers’ interrogation, “what is a semi-documentary?”, the other answers: “Well, let’s take an example. You’re making a film about the effect of Vietnam on the English, that’s a documentary. Now here we are in the middle of the screen talking about Vietnam.” [14:45-15:11].\n\n22Jacques Rancière’s body of work has consistently engaged with the politics of aesthetics in an attempt to redefine regimes of representation, what he calls the distribution of the sensible, and to open up new possibilities of ethical and political agencies. In The Emancipated Spectator, he raises the question of what makes a picture intolerable:\n\n39 Jacques Rancière, Le spectateur émancipé, Paris: La fabrique éditions, 2008, 108. my translation.\n\nThe question is not whether we can or cannot show the horrors suffered by the victims of such and such violence. It concerns the construction of the victim as an element of a certain distribution of the sensible. An image is never alone, it belongs to a regime of representation that regulates the status of the bodies that are represented and the type of attention they deserve. The question is, what kind of attention does this or that regime provoke?\n\nConclusion\n\n24I would like to conclude by commenting on a last shot from the film, taken from a very brief scene that seems completely disconnected from all the rest. However, it may very well sum up the whole filmic enterprise. In this scene [22:08-22:20], a line of people are slogging through wet sands that literally illustrate the quicksands that the Vietnam war had become at the time. Just as the film’s structure defies any consistent narrative line, viewers are at a loss as to whom exactly the characters are or represent and where they’re going next. Nonetheless, like the film, they are walking a fine line on a most thorny issue, attempting not to get bogged in any dogmatic points of view."
