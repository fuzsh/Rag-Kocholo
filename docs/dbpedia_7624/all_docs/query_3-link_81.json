        "text": "Imagine living for more than a decade in a refugee camp in a desert, where your prized possession -- your only possession, really -- is a pair of worn-out shoes. Then imagine giving your only possession away to someone else. There is a moment in The Good Lie when a young man does just that. His motive? He's finally been granted political asylum in the U.S., and now instead of having nothing he has everything, because he has hope. So he gives away his shoes to a shoeless man who must remain in the refugee camp. This theme of giving what you have for someone else, in the name of hope, is the driving narrative of the film. Even the film's title and important moments it relates to are in fact extensions of the more fundamental concept of giving of yourself for the sake of others in the name of hope.\n\nA lesser movie might've found voice for that narrative easily in sweeping moments that put a finer point on it, but failed to let it thrive throughout even the smaller moment of the film in subtle and remarkable ways as it does in The Good Lie. From the civil war in Sudan, to the refugee camp in Kenya, to their new home and jobs in the U.S., this story of children orphaned by war never loses sight of the simple idea that mercy and grace are meant for those who need it, such a simple idea and yet too often absent in this world. It's refreshing to see a movie that knows where its heart lies and remain so faithful to that premise.\n\nThat heart, the compelling truths found in the story of the so-called \"Lost Boys of Sudan,\" and the strong performances that bring the story to life are more than enough to make The Good Lie worthy of finding an audience. Being worthy, however, doesn't necessarily translate into being likely, and the 461 theater count plus the lack of significant advertising for the film make it hard to expect more than something in the range of maybe $2,000+ per screen for the weekend.\n\nWaiting for awards season attention to perhaps provide a boost, if it can get its name into the running for acting categories and possibly some attention for Margaret Nagle's screenplay, wouldn't be a bad strategy. But it'd be a risky one, obviously, from a purely business perspective. Whether that's the plan or not, I don't know, but we'll see how it plays out.\n\nThere has been media attention for the film's subject matter, not to mention the long journey the film took to finally make it to the screen (the Los Angeles Times article detailing that history is a fascinating read, so give it a look after you finish my review), so that free press might help raise awareness of the film in the cities lucky enough to have screenings. And reviews have thus far been overwhelmingly positive, which is always helpful for a film that's relying so much on word of mouth.\n\nThe main nod toward financial considerations is of course the casting of Reese Witherspoon and Corey Stoll. The marketing has focused a great deal on Witherspoon, and the star casting will no doubt attract at least some additional attention and viewership. Do a Google image search for \"The Good Lie\" and what you see is a great deal of Reese Witherspoon -- posters, production stills, interview shots, you name it. That Witherspoon is just a supporting character who doesn't show up until about 40 minutes or so into the film isn't obvious from this marketing.\n\nI'm not complaining, mind you, as I know getting a film like this made and released is made possible in part by Witherspoon's involvement and her face being prominent in the marketing. It's great she's part of the project, as she's a consistently fantastic performer who is great in this movie, and she has a long history of advocacy for children, including her work with Children's Defense Fund and Save the Children. I'm merely highlighting the necessary nature of the marketing, although I personally feel marketing focused more on the film's narrative about the war in Sudan, the children's fight to stay alive, and their adult lives as immigrants to the U.S. is pretty powerful and nobody should underestimate modern audiences' taste for unique stories of this sort.\n\nThe audience for The Good Lie will inevitably be reduced by this weekend's release of a few wide-release heavy-hitters, particularly Gone Girl (on which, as an interesting aside, Reese Witherspoon is a producer) and Annabelle, not to mention a probable strong hold for The Equalizer. Adult audiences seeking dramatic viewing will probably head for Gone Girl and The Equalizer, but with those two films selling out in many areas, The Good Lie could pick up additional viewership as an alternative adult drama.\n\nI can't help wondering if The Good Lie might've actually performed stronger as good counter-programming had it had a wider release and stronger marketing push highlighting the film's span of time and global scope. It's unlike anything else in theaters, and is just flat-out a great film that's getting very positive reviews and buzz. It could've been particularly heavily marketed via social media toward non-white audiences and immigrant viewers, and pushed strongly for female audiences via the narrative about Witherspoon's character and her life choices (which is a recurring topic in her arc, and there's an important direction it takes regarding women reaching out to help one another that is intentionally understated to nice effect), as part of a broader marketing approach as I mentioned earlier.\n\nI fear that the posters are too vague, and the tagline -- \"Miracles are made by people who refuse to stop believing\" -- is nice enough but combined with a simple image of Witherspoon smiling and the kids walking doesn't connect strongly with viewers. If I seem like I'm harping on the marketing of the film a bit much, it's simply because I fear potential audiences won't realize just how compelling this film really is and why they need to see it, and that it could make a difference between an opening weekend in the $1 million range versus something closer to perhaps $2 million territory.\n\nFilms focusing on social-political issues in Africa don't honestly tend to enjoy large audience attendance, except when the stories are filtered through the prism of white main characters who witness the events and experience valuable lessons and insights that lead them to help save the non-white characters. When the story centers on the actual Africans themselves, western and global audiences in general tend to offer only modest or weak support, unfortunately.\n\nWe should take a moment to consider how much that reflects the much larger problem of the world tending to ignore Africa except when a problem or tragedy becomes so extreme it either threatens our self-image of moral righteousness (as the situation in Sudan has sometimes done, getting so bad that many people in the rest of the world were forced to acknowledge it was really happening and that it was indeed really bad, before feeling they'd paid enough attention to ignore it again) or when it threatens (factually or merely due to fear-mongering) our sense of actual personal safety (as Ebola has done, after eventually enough Africans were dying that the rest of the world noticed the infection rate and death toll might suggest it could spread to other continents).\n\nFor comparison, we can look at films such as Blood Diamond or The Constant Gardner, which dealt with the humanitarian issues in Sierra Leone and Kenya, respectively. Those were much larger wide-release productions with thriller elements, and whose well-known stars played the (white) main characters, which all made them more \"mainstream\" in their appeal. Invictus was likewise set in Africa and dealt with social issues in South Africa's changing political climate, but it was also a sports film that split main character status between white and black characters, with significant star power and a couple of Oscar nominations to give it an added lift. It also enjoyed wide-release and significant marketing. Don't expect The Good Lie to match these films' bigger box office performances, in other words, unless it gets an Oscar nomination for Best Picture and a few acting nods as well, leading to a wider release post-nomination.\n\nInstead, the more likely comparisons are films like Hotel Rwanda, The Last King of Scotland, and Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. This is good company to be in, but none of them lit the box office on fire. All made less than $50 million, with an average in the $35-40 million range. Assuming it gets enough audience love and awards buzz to earn wider release, The Good Lie is likely to fit into this box office territory, but without such buzz and eventual wider release it's obviously going to fall way short of those numbers as well. The realistic range seems to be anywhere between $1 million and $2 million for opening weekend, but beyond that it's hard to predict without knowing for sure whether the film will gain wider release based on relatively strong holds and awards contention.\n\nIf box office were purely based on merit, The Good Lie would be high on the list of the weekend's top performers. And I sure wish that were possible, because it's a heartbreaking story full of powerful performances and fundamental truths. If audiences really care about Hollywood making smaller, high-quality films about serious important subjects, then audiences need to reward films like The Good Lie by voting with their ticket purchases and putting their butts in the right seats.\n\nI don't usually say much in my reviews to reveal what films are about, but it's important that you understand what this film has to offer, so I'll avoid anything spoilerish and stick to a synopsis that you can sort of get from the trailer anyway. During Sudan's two decades of civil war, millions of children were driven from their homes and/or orphaned, ending up either kidnapped and turned into child soldiers, or living in refugee camps in other nations. Many of these children were granted political asylum in the U.S. and other countries. The Good Lie tells the story of four siblings (well, some are blood relatives and others aren't, but it's complicated) whose family and village is massacred, and who must walk thousands of miles to escape the warfare. Ending up at a refugee camp across the border, they grow up and wait, hoping to some day win asylum in the U.S. When that day finally arrives (this isn't a spoiler, it's revealed at the very start), they face a whole new set of struggles while trying to come to grips with the traumas they endured in Sudan and what -- and who -- they left behind.\n\nWitherspoon is a job placement caseworker for recent immigrants, and her interest in the newly arrived Sudanese refugees is at first shallow and impersonal. Over time, however, she learns their history and develops a friendship with them, and begins to change her own life. This, however, is as I said a supporting role and it never overshadows the primary focus of the story on the three children from Sudan. I kept fearing that it was going to turn into a typical bait-and-switch where the white American's life story took over the narrative, or that a romance would be shoehorned in, or that the \"fish out of water\" immigrant aspects would become fodder for jokes and a quirky lighthearted uplifting story direction that ignored what came before. Thankfully, all of those fears were baseless.\n\nNot that the film isn't offering an uplifting message of hope, but rather it's not trite or disingenuous. It is uplifting in the context of its truths about what happened to these people and their difficulties going on with their lives after so much horror and loss. And the uplift doesn't come without plenty of setbacks and pain, and sometimes there are frankly no easy answers offered. Difficult predicaments sometimes have only messy answers, and the film's title speaks to the imperfection of our options in life at the hardest of moments. But we still have options, we still make our choices, and we must make the right ones -- give, so that others may live, and so that all can find hope. It's not really about offering promises of outcomes, but rather the promise of hope, if you are willing to fight for it for yourself and offer it to others when you can.\n\nThese are children who know what it means to stare hopelessness in the eye, to lose everything and stand in front of the world with nothing but a refusal to give up and a willingness to hold onto hope when anyone else might've let go. When you think of heroes and strength, do you think of children who have nothing and whose power comes from staying alive and having faith that one day their lives will matter to someone else? Probably not, but that's why you need to see this film, so you'll understand children who endure the unimaginable are stronger heroes than any action hero with biceps and guns.\n\nAs good as the story is, it is the performances that make this a must-see film. Arnold Oceng plays the main character, Mamere, a young man who became \"chief\" of a small band of surviving children by simple nature of being oldest -- he is about ten or eleven years old when this happens. Even in adulthood, the others look to him for leadership, and the weight of this burden becomes heavier by the day. The events leading to his becoming chief of the surviving children haunt him, while he struggles to bring his sister to stay with the rest of the family and fights to keep another sibling from sinking into despair. Mamere balances self-doubts and some degree of self-loathing with a certainty that there must be answers to the problems before him. It's an excellent performance, mixing tenderness and idealism with darker emotions and eventually an anger that can find no suitable outlet. In real life, Oceng's father was killed in the Sudanese civil war, and he was raised by his Ugandan mother in the U.K.\n\nCo-stars Ger Duany, Emmanuel Jal, and Kuoth Wiel likewise bring tremendous emotion and authenticity to their performances. Duany's Jeremiah is soft-spoken and spiritual, and he has a wonderful scene that speaks back to the film's central narrative, when he must choose between the rules at his new workplace and his sense of mercy for those in need. When he explains his choice, his statement of self is pure and simple, but rings off the screen as one of the most important moments and best scenes of the film. Jeremiah speaks of his obligation to help those in need, with the moral certainty of someone who has suffered on the receiving side of that equation, and who understands deep within his soul that we as a people won't be long for this earth if we stop meeting that obligation to do what is right.\n\nJal as Paul suffers more overt symptoms of PTSD, often acting insolent toward Mamere and the defying the expectations of his family. But his behavior is motivated in part by the same fears and anger that eat away at Mamere, for the same reasons -- albeit from somewhat different perspectives. When coworkers offer him marijuana, Paul gladly takes advantage of the opportunities to dull his pain and escape from his memories of fleeing Sudan. Again speaking to the narrative, Paul explains a scar to his coworkers and reveals a terrible moment in his childhood that haunts him and serves as a metaphor for a later malevolence that tore apart his life and took someone away from him, just as if reflects the sequence with Jeremiah, two statements of self tied to a choice to risk something of one's own self to save another person -- one is successful, the other not, and the very different emotional states for Jeremiah and Paul as they relate their choices are significant. Duany and Jal were actual child soldiers in the Sudanese civil war.\n\nWiel's Abital spends part of the film away, since the separation of the siblings after their arrival in the U.S. is one of the obstacles they face. Her arc is often about overcoming the narrow perspectives of her brothers when it comes to her proper role in the family and what she's capable of as a woman in society. But she also misses her brothers and wants to be with the family, and it is through Witherspoon and Sarah Baker's character Pamela that the women's arcs converge and instead of leading toward romantic entanglements or lacking personal arcs, we see the biases in our own society that subtly or not-so-subtly mirror some of the same expectations Abital faced in Sudan and continues to face in the U.S.\n\nHow this is overcome, and the fact it's handled by the women together, is only a minor subplot and gets far less screen time than the primary examination of the brothers' relationships; but I'm at least glad it was dealt with in a way respectful of these women and didn't treat them as props merely to serve the men's own arcs. It passes the B echdel test to the point I'm actually not sure if the women ever directly discuss (with one another) the men in the film at all -- I think their conversations are almost entirely about themselves, each other, other women, work, and social fairness. It would've been better, though, to see more time taken to show Abital's adjustments to this country, and tying her arc to the brothers' arcs. Maybe there's some of that on the cutting room floor, allowing a chance for it to make an appearance on the home release. In real life, Wiel's family fled the war in Sudan, but her father ended up killed in the violence, after which her family came to the U.S.\n\nThe way the story ties the character arcs together thematically and to the titular event giving the film its name, without exposition to explain the connections and purely by letting it play out and showing the characters living and interacting, is an example of masterful use of subtext. I've seen some reviews of the film claiming it doesn't have enough emotional depth of character and goes light on really exposing the horrors the Sudanese children experienced, but I disagree -- it doesn't feel a need to linger its eyes directly over bullets piercing bodies in every instance (but it does show that, too), but the film finds more power in revealing the impact of the events and their long-lasting trauma and scars on the survivors by showing us their lives after those events in Sudan, not merely during the events. It plays throughout the entire film, scene after scene, and you feel it resonating in every character.\n\nI'd dispute any claim that the film glosses over the violence or the characterizations -- it doesn't need closer camera shots of dead bodies and buckets of blood to relate the human experience of these children or to seem \"realistic,\" it shows enough death and blood to make those realities more than clear, and is interested instead in the reality of living after such tragic experiences. Those who seem annoyed that they didn't see enough kids being shot, or enough blood in the river as the bodies float by, are perhaps looking in the wrong places for the emotional truth of the story.\n\nDirector Philippe Falardeau made the right choices in those regards, and gets remarkable performances from his cast. He's working with a great script from Nagle already, but it works because all of that subtext is so visceral on the screen, you feel it hanging in the air in scene after scene. There's no over the top melodrama, even during a few scenes where it would've been easy to go for a more heavy handed approach to jerk the audience's emotional chain more forcefully instead of showing restraint.\n\n\"Restraint\" is in fact a consistent aspect of The Good Lie's approach. Falardeau lets even enormous moments transpire with a matter-of-factness that makes them set heavier on your heart precisely because such moments don't need flourish or excessive presentation to hold power and meaning, they have it by nature of the events themselves. A child's death happens suddenly, we glimpse his corpse as almost an afterthought, and the single raw expression of remorse that comes from another character is brief because the war doesn't grant time to grieve. There's no goodbye, no holding of hands or soaring musical score, just a dead child and a scream of sorrow. It happens in a matter of seconds, and it is only our reaction as viewers that lingers. By understating the moments, it forces our own reactions to draw us deeper into the film.\n\nWitherspoon's performance as Carrie is likewise an example of restraint and understatement. There's no attempt to make Carrie larger than life, despite the character's fast pace and strong personality, and her transformation isn't in extremes but in increments and rooted in basic human decency. She comes to know these people, and like any of us knowing someone makes her invest in them and care about them. She realizes someone needs to help them, and that she can't just hope some other person shows up magically to do it so she won't need to.\n\nThere's no on-the-nose moment where her own luck and privilege in life are juxtaposed directly alongside what these Sudanese immigrants have faced and overcome, but their devotion to one another and their immense gratitude to her -- and the revelation of what precisely they endured before coming to the U.S. -- is an absolute subtext to Witherspoon's relationship with the siblings and helps compel her transformation in an unspoken but self-aware manner. Her desire to help them becomes not merely a choice, it is a need, she is compelled and obliged by the nature of knowing them and knowing what has happened to them. Like Jeremiah, she can help so she knows she must. What she eventually does is one more example of the story's theme, of course, but her arc is especially reflective of Jeremiah's, much the way Paul's is reflective of Mamere's.\n\nThe Good Lie is a small film that feels very big. It's not literally a true story, yet it also is, in the sense it's based on true events and stars people touched by or involved in the real events to various degrees playing characters who reflect fundamental realities about what happened and the people it happened to. It's an engrossing film with some of the year's best characters and performances, and one of the few films so far this year that's actually important for people to see."
