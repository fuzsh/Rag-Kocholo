Couches are available on the ground level (all cinemas) and balcony level (Rathmines) There are a limited number of couch seats so they may not be available for your chosen screening.\n\nBed (Seats 2)\n\nBeds are available to book in Rathmines only where there are 5 comfy double beds lining the front row of the auditorium. Beds allow you to lie back and watch your film in maximum comfort.
