        "text": "Oh not, not ANOTHER “pretend we’re getting married” rom-com, tricking the relatives so that somebody can fake his way to an inheritance.\n\nA “bet” is sure to be involved. The lies will pile on top of lies, as more and more people are either drawn into the deceit, or are fooled by it. And of course, the liars will eventually find themselves falling in love “for reals.”\n\n“Miles and Lies,” the clumsy retitling of the Mexican comedy “Tangos, Tequilas y algunas metiras, (Tangos, Tequilas and some lies)” is a remake of “Spanish Affair (“Ocho apellidos vascos,” “Eight Basque Surnames”).\n\nBut this formula — with assorted variations — crosses many borders and turns up in many films. A lot of them starred Kate Hudson and/or Matthew McConaughey, back in the day.\n\nIt begins with a pathological liar who lies her way into a fake relationship with a rich, spoiled grumpy drunk. The narrative slowly passes through the digestive system already pre-digested. It overstays its welcome because the poor director doesn’t know how to grab that “drop the mike” moment.\n\nAnd then…Espera por ello, amigos. Just wait for it. Damned if this ungainly, lumbering Mexican-Argentinian rom-com romp doesn’t almost romp. And play.\n\nThere’s a buy-in with rom-coms, a “give yourself over to it” that kicks in when enough ingredients gell. For me, that begins to happen when our mismatched couple — played by Cassandra Sanchez Navarro and David Chocarro — lean into cultural stereotypes.\n\nThe story’s about a scrambling, lie-on-the-fly bartender named Lu (Navarro) who bets her business “partners” in the bar which she never ponied up her third of the cash for that she can make a tipsy hunk (Chocarro) “fall in love with me.”\n\nTati (Pilar Santacruz) and Fer (Ximena Sariñana) will forget about what Lu-short-for-Guadalupe owes them if she succeeds. If she fails, well… As Lu is an old hand at “faking it until you make it,’ as the gringos say” (in Spanish with subtitles, or dubbed into Englosh), staging shots for a social media life that in no way resembles reality, how hard can it be? No, the ensuing “one night stand” doesn’t count.\n\nMost importantly, they’re all Mexican, and their bar is in Mexico. And the dude is Argentine. Uh oh.\n\nYou don’t have to know the tsunami of stereotypes that Latin Americans hold about each other’s cultures — what the Chileans think of Colombians, why everybody hates Cubans, etc. — to be tickled by where “Miles and Lies” goes. But knowing a few common digs at Argentines is a help.\n\nWhen Lu desperately cheap-flights her way to Buenos Aires to stalk this stranger she only slept with, she is confronted by the “arrogant,” “argumentative,” futbol-obsessed, carnivorous tango-dancing vermouth drinkers that the rest of Latin America recognizes as Argentinian.\n\nDiego — Lu learns — is a a spoiled, ill-tempered trust fund 30something wandering from business to business and passion to passion. He’s in a mood at the moment because his fiance bailed on their planned nuptials. As Diego was “rushing” to the altar to placate his rich mom, who expects him to grow up, you can see his problem. And when the chips are down, so can Lu.\n\nThe guy needs a pretty, agreeable woman with mad lie-on-the-fly skills. If only Lu could do something about her “accent.”\n\nWhen we meet the mom (Soledad Silveyra), we get it. She’s a steamrolling bully who inherited a meat-packing business and who had to butcher and gut her way to credibility. God forbid poor vegetarian Lu has to eat out with this woman.\n\nFortunately, she has one confederate in her side of this hastily-tossed-together scheme with Diego. Tona (Emilio Guerrero) is a relative of one of her partners, an elderly Mexican actor in Argentina.\n\nCan he do the accent, put on the haughty air, discuss Argentine futbol and the finer points of the tango in polite conversation with his future “in-laws?” Of course he’ll play Lu’s dad.\n\nCharacters stumble into Mexican slang and Argentines break into their favorite stadium songs, and nobody is wholly fooled-by or wholly accepting of anybody else.\n\nThe “buy in” here is the great chemistry between Navarro and Chocarro. We believe her as a poseur and him as an unfocused, dreamy trust fund bro. Sileveyra and Guerrero are largely the icing on the cake.\n\nDirector Celso Garcia and screenwriters by Marco Lagarde and Patricio Vega, adapting the 2014 comedy this is based on, leave entirely too many laughs on the table for my taste. You’ve got a theatrical old Mexican actor “playing” Argentine. You’ve got a Mexican woman trying to “pass.”\n\nAnd you’ve got Argentine arrogance, ready-made to go on display.\n\nPlaying this all more broadly, loudly and briskly would have been a BIG help. This is a 95 minute comedy trapped in a 115 minute movie. There aren’t really enough gags to make the 95 minute version pay off, either.\n\nBut a couple of scenes just kill. The eating-out gag reminded me of every Argentinian restaurant I’ve ever eaten in — meat, meat, meat. The only thing in the joints not dripping with blood was your napkin, and that was a temporary state.\n\nA touristy “history of the tango” stage show sets up a lovely bit of camp, and a Big Romantic Moment. There are a couple of those, with maybe one of them working.\n\nThis almost comes off. If Garcia had the sense to end “Miles” on a lovely mariachi moment, and made that moment come 15 minutes sooner and hit his big jokes harder, all involved would have had a winner on their hands.\n\nRating: TV-16, sexual situations, near nudity, profanity\n\nCast: Cassandra Sanchez Navarro, David Chocarro, Soledad Silveyra, Emilio Guerrero, Ximena Sariñana and Paulina Patterson\n\nCredits: Directed by Celso Garcia, scripted by Marco Lagarde and Patricio Vega, based on the film “Spanish Affair/”Ocho apellidos vascos.” A Sony International release on Amazon Prime.\n\nRunning time: 1:54"
