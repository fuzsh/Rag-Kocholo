        "text": "“The Holdovers” takes place in New England somewhere, in 1970, at a tony, all-boys boarding school called Barton, where the students who can’t go home for Christmas wind up spending their breaks in the care of Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), the sourest, most pompous instructor the movie can find. He teaches ancient civilizations and prides himself on being the sort of principled educator who flunks senators’ kids and says stuff like, “Such are the vicissitudes of life” and “Listen, you hormonal vulgarian!” He smells bad, and breaks into Greek and Latin as much out of spite as bonhomie. The man can read everything but the room.\n\nIn fairness, the kids are no picnic, either. They set little traps for Hunham’s arrogance and sic their daddies on the administrators, who then bear down on him. Certainly, the glass eye he uses has made him only more risible to them. Now here he is, as stuck as the five castoffs he’s forced to oversee. And the minute it looks as if the movie’s set to be a deft prep-school caper that pits wily brats against a lemony know-it-all, it introduces a surprise. It’s a ritzy, laugh-out-loud Christmas miracle that whisks away four of the boys at the end of the first act. But one of them, an almost cool only-child named Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa), can’t go because nobody can reach his parents. (He was ready to lounge on St. Kitts, but his mother takes off without him.) So the movie stays behind, too, and I knew I was in very good hands because, even though that meant almost two more hours with this moody, quarrelsome duo, I didn’t mind.\n\nThe hands are Alexander Payne’s. He directed this movie — from a script David Hemingson wrote — and moody, quarrelsome people are his specialty. “The Holdovers” is crackling well before Barton empties out. There’s a sharpness to the comedy, some attitude and freshness, some wisdom. That maybe comes, in part, from the kids looking a little older than their characters are. It also comes from Payne’s emotional finesse. Whatever it is studio technicians do seated at those knobby soundboards, Payne achieves with acting and characterization.\n\nThis is his eighth feature-length movie — “Citizen Ruth,” “Election,” “Sideways,” “About Schmidt,” “The Descendants,” “Nebraska” and “Downsizing” precede this one. And there’s an easy confidence to it. Even as the story accrues the heft of personal tragedy, each scene seems to float or bob. That’s touch, and Payne’s always had it, this knack for crudeness and discourtesy, for pleasing whiffs of sweetness that can take the form of wit or revenge, pettiness or justice. But it’s never just one group of emotions with him. I’m talking about crudenesses and discourtesies. Sweetnesses. So Hunham is curmudgeonly as opposed to a curmudgeon; the difference is a matter of disposition rather than vocation, meaning Giamatti gets to stop playing an archetype (tweedy intellectual) and inhabit a figure of contour and surprise. We can savor how much Hunham, like his surname, is a tricky jumble of a human."
