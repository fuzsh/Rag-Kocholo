Mihm's 19th retro-styled feature in as many years, The Wad: The True Story Behind the Phantom Lake County Chewing Gum Disaster!\n\nIn Mr. Mihm's his first faux-documentary and homage to the B-movie classic, The Blob, KPHL Channel 6 Nightly News anchor Daniel Johnson hosts a hilarious \"look back\" at one of the most shocking events ever to transpire in Mihmiverse history. Through interviews with survivors and major players involved in the crisis, re-enactments, and never-before-seen archival footage, Mr. Johnson presents the complete and unabridged story of a wad of chewing gum that mutated, became sentient, grew to gargantuan proportions, and threatened the lives of every man, woman, and child in Phantom Lake County!\n\nAdvance tickets are now on sale @ wadmovie.com!\n\nHEIGHTS 2024 CELEBRATION OF CINEMA\n\n10TH ANNIVERSARY SCREENING.\n\nTHE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL\n\nSept. 16, 2024, 7:30 p.m.\n\nALL SEATS $12.00\n\nGet Tickets\n\nA drab hotel owned by the charming Zero Moustafa is the basis for this story-within-a-story, as the older Zero recounts his life to a mysterious Author. The Grand Budapest Hotel, high in the mountains of Zubrowka, is the backdrop for the story of the great concierge Gustave H. Gustave ran a tight ship, and on this side seduced the old women of the hotel, one of whom may or may not have left him a priceless painting in her will. But her evil son doesn't like this, and so heists, romance, jailbreak, and other unbelievable plot twists, played by one of the most star-studded casts in modern cinema, make The Grand Budapest Hotel Anderson's most ambitious and successful film (by far). Nominated for nine and winner of four Academy Awards.\n\nDCP - Walt Disney Co.\n\nHEIGHTS 2024 CELEBRATION OF CINEMA\n\n105TH ANNIVERSARY SCREENING!\n\nDIE PUPPE - THE DOLL\n\nSept. 29, 2024, 7:30 p.m.\n\nALL SEATS $20.00\n\nGet Tickets\n\nWith live accompaniment by Dreamland Faces.\n\nWhen Lancelot, the nephew of the Baron of Chanterelle, is told by his uncle that he must marry, he balks. He is not in the least bit interested in having little Lancelots running underfoot, and so when the Baron puts out a reward to local maidens to wed his nephew, the poor fellow flees! But then he gets an idea...in the forest lives a man whose mechanical dolls are so true to life they fool everyone. He'll marry one of them. But when the dollmaker's daughter falls for the timid Lancelot, she switches places with his doll of choice, with hilarious, and sexy, results. Ernst Lubitsch's THE DOLL (DIE PUPPE) is one of the funniest sex comedies ever made, a riotous look at love and marriage, and one of the director's most sophisticated films.\n\nWith the short film \"THE DOLL'S REVENGE\"\n\nPresented in Partnership with Archives on Screen Twin Cities, Syncopated Silents, and University of Minnesota Imagine Fund\n\nTHE SEARCHERS in 70MM\n\nOct. 7, 2024, 7:30 p.m.\n\nALL SEATS $18.00\n\nGet Tickets\n\nNEW 70MM PRINT!\n\nWhen Comanches abduct Ethan Edward's niece, he goes on an obsessive, brutal and years long quest to find her. Without question the most influential Western ever made, THE SEARCHERS is a personal favorite of Martin Scorsese, influenced Star Wars, and was ranked the greatest film of all time in the latest Sight and Sound poll.\n\nThe Searchers was filmed in VistaVison an 8 perf horizontal 35mm film format that created a large format negative comparable to 70mm. Warner Bros Motion Picture Imaging scanned the original 8 perf 35mm VistaVision camera negative in 13k with all restoration work completed in 6.5k. The new 70mm print was created at Fotokem by filming out a new 65mm negative from this 6.5k restoration.\n\nPresented by The Heights Theater and The Trylon cinema.\n\n70mm print - Park Circus\n\nTHE HEIGHTS THEATER PRESENTS IT'S ANNUAL HOLIDAY EXTRAVAGANZA!\n\n\"WHITE CHRISTMAS\" - HEIGHTS HOLIDAY SHOW\n\nClick for all show times.\n\nALL SEATS $20.00\n\nGet Tickets\n\n70TH ANNIVERSARY SCREENING!\n\nA Heights Theater tradition! One of our most popular events! An event that sells out year after year. You will not want to miss the perennial TECHNICOLOR favorite, WHITE CHRISTMAS, on the big screen!\n\nPlus.....ON OUR STAGE! The big show starts with a special 20 minute concert by the wonderful MAUD HIXSON, singing a stocking full of your favorite holiday classics! Accompanied by Rick Carlson on the piano.\n\nAlso... A fantastic pre show concert by ED COPELAND and LOU HURVITZ at the Heights Mighty Wurlitzer!\n\nWHITE CHRISTMAS FAQS\n\nQ: I have an MPR 2 for 1 coupon, can I use these for White Christmas?\n\nA: No, since this is a special event we do not accept any 2 for 1 coupons or other discounts.\n\nQ: When does the singer start and when does the movie start and when do I need to be there?\n\nA: The show, which starts with Maud Hixson performing at either 2:00pm or 7:00pm with the movie following immediately after her performance. So you need to be here at the ABSOLUTE LATEST by 2:00pm or 7:00pm because that is when the show officially starts and we do not seat after that.\n\nQ: When does the organist start?\n\nA: The organist will start playing 30 minutes before the start of the show.\n\nQ: When do your doors open?\n\nA: Our doors open an hour before the start of the shows and we encourage you to arrive early so you can get seated and have plenty of time to get refreshments and relax before the show. We have a pianist playing the lobby piano at 1:00pm and 6:00pm and the Organist starts to perform at 1:30pm and 6:30pm, so there is plenty to keep your and your guests entertained before the show starts.\n\nQ: Is the seating reserved seating?\n\nA: All the seating for these performances is not assigned and is general seating, so the earlier you arrive the better selection of seats you will have, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A LARGE GROUP. Your advance ticket purchase guarantees you a seat at the performance, but with a sold out show there may be a chance, especially if you arrive late, that you may not be able to sit with your guests, so arrive early as refunds are not given if you cannot sit together.\n\nQ: Something has come up and now we are unable to attend, can we get a refund.\n\nA: Refunds are not given on advance ticket sales."
