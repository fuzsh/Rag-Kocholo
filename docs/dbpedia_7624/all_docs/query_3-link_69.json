        "text": "Certain films have the potential to upend any expectations you have going into the theater, and may be the latest to bludgeon its way into that category. Part lesbian love story, part 80s throwback, part psychological rodeo, the Neo-noir film is an untamable beast with a sharp thriller edge lying in simmering wait.\n\nPumped up by its A24 pedigree, the film by writer-director Rose Glass is certainly in the same dark and twisted universe as her 2019 feature film debut,The main difference between the two - apart from time and setting - is that \"Love Lies Bleeding\" does not alienate audiences from its characters, widening the breadth and depth of their world without forgoing emotional resonance. Maud's small life as a religious fanatic and invalid caretaker was insular, a contributing factor to her manic meltdown; in \"Love Lies Bleeding\", there is still a psychological component to the film's unraveling, but there is also juicy tension that slides down through its crime thriller spine, perpetuated by physical actions, not just emotional ones.\n\nThe connections between its imperfect characters focus our gaze toward the two at the film's center. Kristen Stewart stars as Lou, a reclusive gym manager in a small New Mexico town. Her head is perpetually stuck in the sand, avoiding the burly, macho-masculine regulars and a former flame, turned stage five clinger Daisy (Anna Baryshnikov) who passes through her establishment. When she isn't unclogging the facilities' toilets, Lou is visiting with her sister Beth (Jena Malone), despite Lou's obvious disdain for her brother-in-law JJ (Dave Franco), a narcissistic abuser and habitual cheater. With his wholesome good looks, Franco has a knack for these scum-of-the-earth roles. Alongside Malone, who plays the demure victim with wonderfully blind aggrievement, Franco is easy to hate and even easier to enjoy from his first scene to his very last.\n\nBut it's the arrival of a strange new girl Jackie (Katy O'Brian) that sets Lou's life in a tailspin. Jackie is passing through with no money and fewer resources. She trades sexual favors for an interview at a local shooting range owned by a long-haired crypt keeper, Lou Sr. (Ed Harris). Harris does his best impersonation of a regenerated Vecna, back from ruling the Upside Down, a pack of cigs deep and ready to find the next small town to terrorize. Harris is a dirty, rotten, scene stealer, and it will be tough to forget him in this.\n\nJackie wants to continue her nomadic lifestyle to Vegas for an upcoming bodybuilder competition that, in her eyes, is the ticket to fame and fortune. She's ripped, and she knows it. O'Brian, who submitted a video of her workout to garner the attention of the film's casting directors, is intimately familiar with the role. She is a queer bodybuilder from the Midwest both on and off screen, and her comfort level in the role is immediately apparent. She's had a few acting credits to her name, but none as big as this one. Even so, she holds her own alongside a veteran of the craft Stewart, and their chemistry is dangerous. It's hard to tear your eyes away from O'Brian when she's on screen.\n\nKStew has long ditched her reign in tween roles for more subversive indie films, a sweet spot for her to transform into a character and avoid the pretty love interest mold into which, for many years, she was crammed. This isn't a comedy, but Lou is the \"straight\" character in the film, the one to normalize Jackie's uncontrollably erratic moments and more frequent psychotic breaks with a determined brow and can-do attitude. Stewart is right to seek out these types of roles. She is Lou, and it's been a minute since we've seen her shine like she does in this one.\n\nTheir love story intensifies - Jackie moves in, a welcome reprieve from sleeping under highway passes and whatever protected piece of concrete she can find - and then it shows signs of imploding. Jackie is still determined to make it to Vegas; Lou has never left town, and her ties to this one run deeper than is first let on. Then someone is killed. There won't be any spoilers as to who is killed or how. That is very much part of the shocking fun in \"Love Lies Bleeding\". As the cogs begin to turn and one decision leads to the next, Lou and Jackie find themselves up against a rigged system overseen by Lou's criminally vague father. As strong women, they won't let the patriarchy win without one helluva fight. Jackie does make it to the competition where her mental collapse reaches peak psychotic meltdown. Jackie's past is implied, though never explicitly explained, and a few points could be expanded to further connect viewers with Jackie. Lou's previous work alongside her father is also a hazy point of contention, one that could use some screen time to feather out.\n\nThe real shock in the film is in one of the final scenes. Lou sends Jackie away to save herself, facing probable death as punishment for going against her father's crime syndicate when the impossible happens: Jackie inflates, expanding from her already bulked-out physique to a bonafide giantess, two stories tall and swooping in to save the day. I'm still not sure if this scene is meant to be literal - that she literally grew into a she-behemoth - or if the habitual steroid use Jackie initiated under Lou's tutelage and supply has sprouted her self-worth, given her drug-induced mammoth strength. Either way, it's a bit of a laugh-out-loud moment, and at first, it may seem like it negates the fear and trauma that this journey has brought them. Once the initial shock wears off, the scene morphs. The more thought I put into it in retrospect, the more I like the fever twist as it brings a fantastical end to a story that is, in many ways, a poignant fable and blood-soaked fairytale.\n\n\"Love Lies Bleeding\" is in theaters now."
