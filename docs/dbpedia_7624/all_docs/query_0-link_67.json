        "text": "From cheating on taxes and in romance to telling the police officer who pulled us over that we didn't realize how fast we were going, we are all lying all over the place all the time. Beyond our personal experiences, a cursory glance at public scandals ranging from Enron to Bernie Madoff to the recent \"Deflategate\" shows the prevalence of lies in our culture. However while we are simultaneously lying and repelled by lies, we are also fascinated with falsehoods given the variety of TED Talks on lies, films (“The Invention of Lying”) and all those country songs about those damn cheatin' liars. Behavioral economist and psychologist/Duke University professor Dan Ariely and filmmaker Yael Melamede's new documentary \"(Dis)Honesty - The Truth About Lies\" is not only an engaging exposé and somewhat cautionary tale, but also it shows that there is hope for us liars.\n\nNow before you berate yourself and vow never to lie again, relax and take a breath. Not all lies are equal or damaging. According to Ariely, who has been researching dishonesty for ten years (ever since he took a Mensa test on a flight and noticed that he was cheating and justifying his bad behavior to himself), there is nothing wrong with telling white lies now and again so long as they benefit others. In the documentary, a man recounts a story about having comforted a terrified woman on a turbulent flight when he lied and told her that he was an aeronautics engineer. Speaking over the phone for our interview, Ariely says not to use white lies, however, for exclusively selfish reasons. \"Some lying is socially useful, but we do it too much in an undiscriminating way. We lie, socially, way too much,\" says Ariely. \"When we don't admit to our shortcomings, it prevents our learning and self-improvement.\" For example, Ariely encourages us to be accountable and honest instead of blaming the subway or traffic when we are late.\n\nAccording to the documentary, most lies start out fairly innocently before falling victim to a slippery slope that ends in a consequence ditch. What's more, we tend to rationalize our lies. Using first person testimonials, the documentary shows a wide range of lying folks who were caught and forced to face the consequences. From former professional cyclist Joe Papp, who was caught doping (\"I never would have imagined myself doping, but when you think that everyone else is doing it, even if you don't know that to be true, it makes it a lot easier to consider what you've done is legitimate.\"), to Erika Nelson, who fixed her troubled marriage only once her husband discovered her extramarital affair (\"Even when you know it's wrong, the immediate gratification suffocates what you know is right.\"), each person had a unique justification for lying.\n\nWhile most of the liars shown in the documentary paid a price for their untruths, publicist and marketer Ryan Holiday is an exception. To market the film \"I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell,\" based upon author Tucker Max's bestselling book, most of the press campaign orchestrated by Holiday was predicated upon publicity stunts and manipulating the media and blogosphere into believing that public protests and defaced billboards were a direct result of public anger towards the controversial film. However, the initial outrage, though it ultimately caught on with, included and was perpetuated by the public, was carefully conceived of and manufactured internally from the Tucker Max camp. Melamede says, \"Lots of people look at Ryan and think he's a smart and talented marketer. People want to emulate him. They don't see the cost. He's one of the most dangerous stories. He didn't pay a price for his dishonesty. Almost everyone else in the film does. In many ways, he's lauded for it.\" Ultimately, the furor and controversy strengthened Tucker Max's brand.\n\nAn especially compelling aspect of the documentary is the light it sheds upon the physiological effects of repeated lying. The more we lie, the more our brains adapt to accommodate our deception. The first time we lie, we feel its impact in our amygdala and insula which are the parts of our brains that are connected to emotion. As we lie more, however, our brains don’t become significantly aroused. Further, if we find an acceptable justification for our lies, we can lie to ourselves without discomfort from our bodies. The documentary shows an experiment created by Ariely in which a group of test subjects, having justified their cheating under the guise of having done so for charity, passed a lie detector test due to their bodies not having registered any emotional uneasiness in connection with their lies.\n\nAs to what deters lies, it turns out that the threat of punishment is an ineffective behavioral modifier. What seems to be instrumental in maintaining and eliciting society's truthfulness, however, is to remind people of their moral fiber. In experiments conducted by Ariely, self professed atheists were not prone to cheating once they swore on the Bible that they'd be truthful. When university students were asked to list the Ten Commandments, even when they didn't remember all of them, they didn't cheat. After having signed honor codes before taking tests, students did not cheat.\n\nSince the making of this film, is Ariel lying less than he has previously? He says he has definitely become more conscientious. \"Once you understand, you try to cut down ambiguous aspects of life. I do it in terms of conflicts of interest. I've become fanatic about it. Where can we work? Who can we take money from? What kind of projects can I and can't I do? Should I get research money from tobacco companies? There are so many moral dilemmas. That has been worrisome to me and I've changed a lot.\" On a lighter note, he says that he has made a pact with himself always to tell people when they have spinach caught in their teeth.\n\n\"(Dis)Honesty - The Truth About Lies\" plays in LA at Laemmle's Playhouse 7, Pasadena, in NYC at IFC Center and is available on iTunes and VOD."
