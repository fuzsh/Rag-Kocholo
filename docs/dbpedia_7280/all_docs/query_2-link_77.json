        "text": "24 Hour Party People > HMV Limited edition DVD\n\nThe full UK retail double DVD was released on 27 January 2003. HMV offered the UK double dvd in a numbered limited edition special sleeve with a design similar to that of the book 24 Hour Party People by Tony Wilson and also the legendary Fac 1 poster. This version is now unavailable but the discs it contains are identical to those featured in the regular UK retail edition.\n\nThis is a double dvd set (catalogue number FACDVD 424) and features audio commentary from Tony Wilson, another commentary with Steve Coogan / producer Andrew Eaton and a third one with Factory band stars Rowetta (Happy Mondays), Hooky (New Order), Martin Moscrop (A Certain Ratio), Bruce Mitchell (Durutti Column) plus the journalist Miranda Sawyer (who curated the 'Pop' cd from NewOrder Retro, Bobby Langley (ex-Hacienda DJ who bought the Hacienda DJ booth when it was auctioned off) and Leroy Richardson (ex-manager of the Hacienda).\n\nAlso features the Peter Saville Gallery which includes the man himself in conversation with Tony Wilson discussing some of the designs Saville has done for Factory Records. This is similar to one of those picture galleries which are quite common these days but with the added bonus of an audio soundtrack\n\n24 Hour Party People HMV numbered limited edition dvd; back cover detail"
