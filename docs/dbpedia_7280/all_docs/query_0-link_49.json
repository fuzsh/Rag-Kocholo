        "text": "If you lived in the north-west at any time after 1973, it was impossible to ignore the indefatigable broadcaster, music mogul, social activist, proud northerner, football fan, writer and exhibitionist Tony Wilson, who has died aged 57 of a heart attack after being diagnosed with cancer earlier this year. For years, he was known as plain Tony Wilson, both as an extremely opinionated, populist Granada television presenter and as an idiosyncratic Manchester music impresario who dedicated his life to making the city internationally famous for its music, nightlife and pop culture. From the moment he appeared on television, and especially after he combined his daily Granada duties with his antics as self-appointed ringleader of the Manchester music business, he was someone you loved, or hated, or loved and hated at the same time.\n\nIn the 1990s, typically writing his own history as he went along, he made it clear he preferred to be known as Anthony H Wilson. The pompous self-publicist part of him, enjoying the fact that the bigger name sounded grander and would take up more space, announced that this was because he wanted \"to wind up all the people in Manchester who think I'm a flash cunt\". The more reflective Wilson admitted to me that: \"I never liked Tony. I was always Anthony to my mum. I just wanted to be Anthony again.\"\n\nWilson was born in Salford, Lancashire. His German grandfather came to Salford in 1901, and his family ran three jewellers' shops before moving, when he was five, to the leafier Marple, near Stockport. His mother felt it would be a better place to bring him up, but he kept in contact with the grittier, more darkly romantic Salford. After passing his 11-plus, Wilson won a place at the Catholic boys De La Salle grammar school in Salford. He developed a love of literature and language after he saw a performance of Hamlet at Stratford-upon-Avon.\n\nHe felt, as someone who understood the accelerating importance of popular culture, that he was always in the right place at the right time. He was 13 \"in the school playground when the Beatles happened\" and he was studying English at Jesus College, Cambridge, \"when the revolution in drugs happened\". A flirtation with anarchic politics possibly contributed to his underperforming 2.2 degree, but certainly infected his unique, often haywire approach to life, work, art, music, family and business; the way he would take everything ridiculously seriously, and not seriously at all.\n\nAfter Cambridge, he began his career in journalism as a news reporter for Granada television. Granada was at the time one of the great northern institutions, and he found a home there, one that could, occasionally - only just - indulge his tendency for a naughtiness that in the bland context of a tea-time magazine show was almost dangerous. With schoolboy long hair and a hippy/glam twist to his newsreading suit, he exploited his sweet side and became a teenybop hit and grandma's favourite. Many in the north never forgot when he was a cross between David Cassidy and David Frost, when he would be not so goodnaturedly booed as he arrived at rock concerts, and this contributed to suspicions later when he pursued more provocative activities.\n\nWilson, though, quick to adopt new personas, and adapt to new circumstances, adored the attention, and shrewdly exploited his role as local minor celebrity when it came to what he was really interested in - helping Manchester to recreate itself as a major city, with its radical, inventive and progressive traditions intact.\n\nAs a now respected mainstream broadcaster, in 1975 he accepted a job on the BBC's Nationwide magazine show. He was driving down to London to a new life when he had misgivings. A few miles outside the capital he rang his boss at Granada and asked if his old job was still open. It was. He turned back. He would never entertain the idea of leaving the north again.\n\nThe first sign of Wilson's interest in the counterculture and in radical ideas was when Granada allowed him to present his own What's On section of Granada Reports. This covered the local arts and music scene, and in 1976 it turned into his own pop music show, So It Goes. His suit replaced by a leather jacket, his hair still heart-throb long, the overeager Wilson looked out of place, as he did as one of the 40 or so people who turned up to see the Sex Pistols play at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in June 1976.\n\nEveryone in the audience was inspired by this incendiary performance to react in some creative way. Many formed bands - Buzzcocks, Magazine, Fall, Smiths, Simply Red, Joy Division members were all present. Others became designers, writers or took up roles in the music business. Wilson was galvanised by the event, by the combination of anarchy and music, philosophy and pop, danger and delight, image and protest, and it changed his life, as it did Manchester itself. He immediately invited the Sex Pistols on to the second and final series of So It Goes, which was never shown in more than three ITV regions. Taking pop culture seriously as a social and political force, it was ahead of its time. It still would be today.\n\nBy 1978, still a grinning Granada personality, Wilson formally entered the music business by opening the Factory Club in Hulme to showcase new local music talent. Factory then became a record label. Wilson ran it with fellow northern Catholic grammar school boys, the designer Peter Saville, the producer Martin Hannett, actor and manager Alan Erasmus and Joy Division manager Rob Gretton. Inevitably the label was like no other; deeply northern, stubborn and disorganised, it released records with a reckless anarcho-capitalist verve and an indifference toward profit that verged on performance art. It became the great Manchester label despite not signing Buzzcocks, Magazine, The Smiths, The Fall or The Stone Roses. What it did have was Wilson, part glib newsreader, part cultural curator, part exuberant nuisance, part revolutionary warrior, inspiring, or needling, those around him. The subversive Factory Records became the link between Manchester's reforming radical past, the Sex Pistols' legendary performance and the new modernised Manchester that Wilson had in mind.\n\nFactory's best-known group, Joy Division, became New Order after the 1980 suicide of singer Ian Curtis. Wilson fed off even this dark energy, confirming the views of those doubting his motives. He blithely carried on with his great plan. With Joy Division/New Order money, Factory \"gave back to the community\" by opening the Hacienda Club in a textile showroom turned yacht salesroom. Beautifully and wittily designed by Ben Kelly, it looked like something you found only in New York, and anticipated a new, bold 21st-century Manchester filled with canalside apartments and boutique hotels. After a shaky few years, by the mid 80s it found its function as a dance club importing experimental house music from Detroit and New York.\n\nFactory's Happy Mondays bound together the exotic new dance rhythms with a groggy Lancastrian verse, and in the movement known as Madchester was born the commercialisation of the abstract, agitating spirit of Factory, and the spirited postmodern skittishness of Wilson. Wilson, as the self-appointed public face of the movement, became the tabloids' Mr Manchester, and enthusiastically presided as militant marketing mastermind over the transformation of the city into a global brand.\n\nFactory farcically collapsed in 1991 with debts of Â£2m. The Hacienda was eventually shut down in 1997 by order of the police after a frenetic decade of being the night-time home of hedonism and a magnet for thrill-seekers. Wilson was still a now slightly more weather-beaten Granada pin-up. He claimed to be the man who bought loft living to the city. He became increasingly vocal in his only slightly ironic call for regional self-government in the north-west, fancying himself as chairman of the north, to the horror of Liverpudlians. He was played by Steve Coogan in the 2002 film 24 Hour Party People, which represented his life as chaotic comedy and Wilson as daft Dada daredevil. He attempted new versions of Factory, endlessly curious for the next new thing, the next pop-culture revolution, but he never managed to follow his great innovations, Factory, or the Hacienda, or So It Goes. The history he had written for himself as post-punk saviour of Manchester was too powerful to improve upon.\n\nHe lived out his final months after having a cancerous kidney removed with typical restlessness, curiosity, anger, good humour and fearlessness. His enormous impact on his beloved Manchester over the last 35 years is undeniable. To some extent, even if he did say so himself, this compelling, unique hybrid of selfish visionary, TV hack, charming bully, generous tyrant, commissioning editor, playful philosopher, inconsistent genius and down-to-earth intellectual regenerated a declining city both economically and culturally.\n\nHe was married twice, to Lindsay, and Hilary, who was the mother of his two children, Oliver and Isabel. In 1991, with his partner, Yvette Livesey, who also survives him, he set up the In The City Music Conference, another enterprising attempt to put Manchester on the world map. \"I am the boss,\" joked Yvette. \"He's just the mouth.\""
