        "text": "The cult pop history movie released for the first time on Blu-ray, and re-issued on DVD, now with a massive 4.5 hours of bonus material.\n\nA witty and compelling portrait of the 80s music scene following the rise and fall of Manchester's Factory Records label (Joy Division, New Order, Happy Mondays) from the birth of punk to '90s electronica.\n\nFirst released: Monday 3rd June 2019\n\nFear not! Many items can still be ordered. Amazon in the UK delivers to many international territories, whilst their Australia, USA and Canada stores also supply many equivalent or imported items.\n\nIf you are in the North America, look out for US/Canadian flag icons on popular product listings for direct links.\n\nIf you order from a UK store, please note that the UK is in Region 2 and B, respectively, for DVDs and Blu-rays - check your player's compatibility, or look for multi-region products if you are located in another region.\n\nIf you are in Australia or New Zealand (DVD Region 4), note that almost all DVDs distributed in the UK by the BBC and 2entertain are encoded for both Region 2 and Region 4. The UK and Australasia are in the same Blu-ray region (B).\n\nFurther information & advice on importing"
