        "text": "I saw this film when I was 13 and it marked me. I became obsessed with a passionate and devoted fanaticism that only happened to me at that time in my life, mainly with music. But this film felt like mine. It was something about the humour of that protagonist, Tony Wilson, talking to the camera. The whole form of the film is inspired by the idea of a TV show, with a host guiding us, and this overlaps with the fact that this is the métier of the protagonist and also of the real person on whom the character is based. The Tony Wilson of the film is both intelligent and half-witted, a genius and yet ridiculous. \"He took himself seriously in a way that is totally impossible to take seriously.\" The tone blew my mind. The universe the film narrated also fascinated me: Manchester's underground music scene, from punk to electronic music to rave culture. The music and its creators were fundamental places of identification for me, as for so many teenagers. That mixed with the imaginary of nightlife, partying and drugs ended up dazzling me. Finally, there is the formal aspect of the film and its difficult to classify nature. The film takes what it can from documentary and fiction and mixes it shamelessly, close to a collage idea. The film conveys a freedom and a spirit of playfulness that appealed to me. At the time I wasn't aware of the formal aspect, but today I can see that some of that cheekiness marked me. The humour was not only in the characters, in the tone of the acting and the dialogue, but also in the form and the approach to the materials.
