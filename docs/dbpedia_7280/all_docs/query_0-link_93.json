When Van Morrison said ‘Music is spiritual; the music business isn’t’ he was merely replying briefly to a journalist’s question but in doing so identified a central issue for any study of music and the way it is marketed, distributed and mediated. Television, for example, is born to be sold, no matter how aesthetically pleasing or expertly made it may be. Likewise, film exists because there is a demand for movies. Music, however, does not depend on its economic value in order to exist – it may well depend on commercial ‘realities’ to remain in the marketplace or to form part of the narrative arc of a career, but music has a primal connection to human experience. It existed long before ways were devised to sell it. The relationship between music and the processes via which it is mediated set it apart from other media forms with which it is routinely grouped. We explore, via a number of case studies, the ways in which creativity is brought to the marketplace – how the deep human urge towards music meets the demands of industrial economics (Bourdieu 1987: 6). The book covers the mediations of popular music on British television and radio, and in a range of publications from daily newspapers to specialist magazines; it also looks at the role of the independent label in keeping the roots of music developing and how such labels mediate that music. These categories allow us to explore the role of the cultural gatekeeper in constructing the way that music and musicians are understood by their actual and potential audiences. We do this by talking to professionals who work in the industry. The growth of Popular Music Studies since the late 1960s reflects the development of the form post-1945 and the willingness of the generation who grew up listening to pop to take it seriously. That mix of the serious and the frivolous is key to the soul of popular music of any form, genre or culture – it is something fit for love and dancing but also has the power to move, galvanise and disseminate ideas within a society via the unstoppable force of the remembered song. 1\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 1\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\n2\n\nMEDIA AND POPULAR MUSIC\n\nA link between music and its social power is not confined to a single generation. Thanks to the changing technological mediations of music, the post-Second World War generation could access music and musicians in ways that were previously impossible. For example, on 9 February 1964, more than 73 million people simultaneously watched the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show. Likewise, recording technologies make it possible for us to listen to Enrico Caruso or Frank Sinatra, Nick Drake or Kurt Cobain any time we like, though all have long since departed. Through such examples, this book explores how popular music is mediated in practice. It places professional and artistic practice in a new theoretical framework. Music does not exist separately or in isolation from the society or culture that produces it. So while considering how music is mediated by TV, radio and print we also acknowledge that these elements are connected. We might assume that cultural production is, in Wernick’s phrase (Wernick 1991), ‘promotional culture’ but surely the mediation of popular music is also doing something else – it enables the music to endure beyond the moment of its performance. Recording technologies have allowed the ‘capture’ of the momentary and made it permanent. This has changed the dynamics of the human relationship with music and our own creativity. Thus the secret of music’s significance in contemporary culture lies in the mediating technologies which catch, record and recreate the unique moment. This applies equally to the pages filled with writing about music. Indeed writing about popular music is something of an enigma; perhaps even more than writing on film or television, it produces all kinds of writing in different registers, tailored to address different readers. Some say it is impossible: polymath Martin Mull infamously likened writing about music to ‘dancing about architecture’ and 1960s countercultural icon Frank Zappa described music journalism as being ‘written by people who can’t write for people who can’t read’. Others say it is essential. We shall consider both viewpoints. Writing about music falls broadly into one of two categories: on one side consumer writing, scholarly and academic on the other. The former is assumed to focus upon personalities and ephemera, including fan writing and coverage in mainstream newsprint. Writing in the specialist music press (titles like Q or NME) feels less engaged in promotion yet is in its own way just as closely allied to the processes of the music industry, built to promote and sell product. Scholarly work on popular music tends to set aside the ephemeral and concerns itself with the canon, focusing upon artists and works the cultural value of which has passed beyond mere ‘taste’ and ‘opinion’ and is effectively a\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 2\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\ncultural norm. There is consensus in both fields about the value of, say, the Beatles, Bob Dylan or the Sex Pistols but the differences lie in the manner in which they are written about. These recordings still sound the same as they did when newly issued; it is the way in which they are discussed which has changed. Thus what remains to be explored in writing about music is the way in which such works can be shown to be exceptional: this is the role of the cultural gatekeeper (see Becker 1992; Hesmondhalgh 2007) as much as the technological mediator. It’s true to say that writing about popular music has been distinguished from – and kept at some remove from – traditional musicology, or writing about classical or ‘serious’ music. To some extent these boundaries are breaking down as rock and pop develops a canon of high cultural value – the Beatles or the blues – while classical music is marketed more aggressively to a younger, wider audience. This process began with violinist Nigel Kennedy in the 1990s and is currently best embodied by ‘pop-opera’ singers such as Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins and Paul Potts who was discovered on ITV’s Britain’s Got Talent show. Likewise, artists such as 1960s band the Kinks and 1980s act Madness are seen as equally expressive of ‘Englishness’ as the work of classical composers such as Sir Edward Elgar (1857–1934) or Ralph Vaughan-Williams (1872–1958). The renowned music scholar Richard Middleton considered the ways popular music is understood by musicologists, noting that ‘there is a rich vocabulary for certain areas [he cites harmony, tonality, certain part-writing and forms], which are important in musicology’s typical corpus’ yet there is ‘an impoverished vocabulary for other areas, such as rhythm, pitch, nuance and gradation, and timbre, which are less well developed’ (Middleton 1990: 104–6). In the same way that much of the rock and pop catalogue is, directly or indirectly, influenced by the work of the once-obscure 1930s bluesman Robert Johnson (see Guralnick 1998; Wald 2005), it is undoubtedly the case that all scholarly writing about popular music is indebted to Theodor Adorno’s essay ‘On Popular Music’ (see Leppert 2002). Adorno was part of the famous ‘Frankfurt School’ of thinkers (see Bottomore 2002) and the essay was written in 1941 after the German Jewish intellectual had arrived in New York after fleeing Nazi persecution in his homeland. It shudders with the shock of the new, describing the impact of jazz and big band music – that is the popular music of 1941 – upon his senses, after he had left the Europe of Beethoven and Wagner. After Adorno, there were isolated examples of early writing about popular song in socio-cultural terms, in works such as Richard Hoggart’s The Uses of Literacy (1957) and a prescient piece on\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 3\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\n4\n\nMEDIA AND POPULAR MUSIC\n\nthe Beatles by a young Terry Eagleton (1964), but effectively it took scholars nearly three decades to catch up with Adorno’s thoughts on the nature of popular music. The subject, and the search for a new descriptive vocabulary, arguably began in earnest through the free journalism of the late 1960s in magazines like Rolling Stone and Creem in the USA and Time Out and Oz in the UK, which then fed into in the early work of writers like Greil Marcus and Lester Bangs in the US. Marcus’s Mystery Train (1972) is rightly a standard work of pop criticism and his professionalism contrasts starkly with the wilder stylings of Bangs, a more intuitive writer but preyed upon by his own weaknesses for drink and narcotics; his work is gathered in several anthologies such as Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung (2001). Marcus is currently a professor at Berkeley in California; Lester Bangs died of an accidental drug overdose in April 1982. In the UK the innovators included Richard Middleton and Simon Frith, who both began to write about pop in British publications in the early 1970s. Middleton could be argued to be the ‘father’ of Popular Music Studies, introducing the subject to serious study and founding the influential journal Popular Music. Middleton is a musicologist who argues for the presence of a dedicated field of popular music studies to be accommodated within the wider field of musicology. This has been explored and argued in works including Pop Music and the Blues: A Study of the Relationship and Its Significance (1972), Studying Popular Music (1990) and a collection of work from Popular Music published as Voicing the Popular: On the Subjects of Popular Music (2006). As a sociologist Simon Frith has tended to look at popular music and its ebbs and flows as sociological phenomena as much as artistic or aesthetic creativity. Books like Sound Effects (originally published as The Sociology of Rock, 1978), Performing Rites and Music for Pleasure (both 1998) have all worked away at this particular seam to illuminating effect. Key works by subsequent scholars include Bennett (2000, 2001), Hesmondhalgh (2002, 2004), Inglis (2003, 2006), Moore (2009), Negus (1996, 1999), Shuker (2001, 2007), and Whiteley (1993, 2000, 2005); all have made a substantial contribution to the teaching of the subject in the UK while American scholars such as Grossberg (1992) and Reising (2002, 2006) have set the topic in a wider context of public life within a consumer culture. Major monographs on the work of major artists such as the Beatles (see Macdonald 1994), Bob Dylan (see Shelton 1986/2011), Van Morrison (see Mills 2010) and Marvin Gaye (see Ritz 2005) have all expanded the popular music studies bookshelf. Surveying the field, we note how frequently key texts have been edited collections – where\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 4\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nthere are many voices addressing the topic (see Inglis 2010), or ‘users guides’ which aim to act as primers for study (see Shuker 2007, revised 2011). Both are useful approaches; the ensemble effort of the edited volume is somehow appropriate to the socialised and socialising power of popular song. Structure and logic Each section has an introductory essay which considers the specific field and its history as well as considering the key theories which have been influential upon the subject. This is followed by the case studies which seek to test the theory against the actual experience of those who write about, broadcast and make the music. The first part of the book is arranged through studies of three key media forms to which music finds itself subject: press, television and radio. First, we look at mainstream rock and pop magazine publishing with Mark Ellen, who has been at the forefront of this field since the late 1970s and whose professional biography is effectively a history of UK music magazine publishing, taking in editorships at Smash Hits, Q, Select, Mojo and Word magazines. His insights are illuminating and generous. Following this we consider how popular music finds its way into a daily newspaper through a discussion with Laura Barton, music writer for The Guardian and author of the highly regarded ‘Hail, Hail, Rock’n’Roll’ column; there is a sample edition of this column in the book’s Appendix I. Specialist or ‘niche’ magazine publishing is explored via a discussion with Simon Broughton, editor of the ‘World Music’ magazine, Songlines. Finally we look at an odd one out – a magazine for the trade. Where the previous three writers have been involved in consumer publications, Music Week is the trade paper for the British music industry and as editor Paul Williams observes, it is ‘the village paper’ for the business. This presents us with a different model of the mediation of music and we consider how this reversed polarity changes the way music is thought of and understood in this specific context, alongside a case study of a single issue of the paper. Where consumers can choose to read or not to read the printed word, it might seem that music on television is harder to escape – after all MTV licensed a sample from Kraftwerk’s 1986 track ‘Musique Non Stop’ to promise (or threaten) exactly that – music, non-stop. Yet as satellite channels delivered music and pictures around the clock, popular music coverage on terrestrial television became much rarer. Content in contemporary British television, for example, is either historical-contextual documentary such as seen on BBC4 or, in rare oases,\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 5\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\n6\n\nMEDIA AND POPULAR MUSIC\n\nlive performance such as the BBC’s coverage of the Glastonbury festival. Since BBC1’s Top of the Pops was cancelled in 2006 the idea of the competitive chart has disappeared as a structural device for presenting popular music on British television. This has democratised much of the visual mediation of pop but has arguably taken some of the pleasurable heat and light out of the process. Mark Cooper has produced the BBC’s flagship music show Later . . . with Jools Holland for twenty years and through his expertise we consider the role of television in the mediation of popular music. With equally illuminating observation, Jeremy Lascelles, CEO at music and media company Chrysalis, discusses the relationship between music and advertising. What is being ‘sold’ here? Music, product, or both? ‘Borrowed interest’ seems to be part of the connection between music and advertising, but we discover that it is not the whole story. His choice examples, from cult hero Nick Drake to electro dance act Leftfield, come from his extensive experience in the industry and make for an eye-opening exploration of this topic. Finally we examine two BBC specialist music shows, one for national broadcast and one for local. BBC Radio 3’s Late Junction provides a model for how an individual original idea can influence the directions in which the mediation of music can head and also how those same mediations can impact upon individual musical reputations; the show’s first and longest-term presenter Fiona Talkington offers a range of insights into the nature of music radio and what it takes to get a piece of music on the air. The second case study is a show produced for BBC Radio Leeds, Down in the Grooves. Host and originator James Addyman discusses how and why a show like this is able to get on air, become successful and then maintain that success despite being moved around the schedules and occupying an unpromising timeslot. This leads to a consideration of whether, with the advent of ‘Listen Again’ platforms such as the BBC iPlayer, the concepts of ‘national’ and ‘local’ radio broadcasting are breaking down. The powerful streak of originality of ambition and purpose which runs through these two radio shows links us into the second part of the book. In the book’s final chapter we examine, through two case studies, the nature of independent musical production and mediation. The subjects of these studies, ‘Pure Records’ and ‘Buzzin’ Fly’, are excellent examples of both the struggles and successes experienced by labels which stand outside the commercial mainstream yet which are very successful in both commercial and creative senses. How do they ‘manage’ such success without outgrowing their own roots and sense of identity with which each is strongly identified? Pure is the home of\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 6\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nEnglish folk singer Kate Rusby, and is a very successful independent label, with sales figures and balance sheets which would be the envy of many mainstream companies. That the label has remained effectively a family-run operation while managing great commercial success is most remarkable and the discussion with the Rusby family reveals much about the difficulties as well as the rewards of running a label in this way. Buzzin’ Fly operates in another ‘niche’ market, that of dance music, and as such is obliged to deal with many of the economic realities that face a label like Pure even though their musical catalogues could hardly be more diverse. The label’s founder, Ben Watt, best known as half of the band Everything but the Girl, discusses how the label began and how the day-to-day realities of running a label according to aesthetic as well as economic criteria can impact upon the way the music is made, distributed and understood. We also learn how a label might expand into other media forms, such as ‘branded’ club nights and radio programming. Both examples represent a faith in the wider meaning of music as an art form which can exist for other reasons than just to be sold and embody a resolution to maintain some genuine independence in a marketplace which seeks to force creativity into the centre ground. In their mediations, then, they are seeking to foreground the music itself, for itself. In the space between such level-headed business sense and the creative forces which drive music lies a fascinating tension. This book seeks to explore that tension between creativity and industrial process, and how music survives its multiple mediations.\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 7\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 8\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\n1 Dancing about Architecture? Mediating Popular Music Through the Written Word\n\nIntroduction The music press in the UK is long-established and yet essentially modern (see Gorman 2001; Jones 2002). It needs to be connected to the historical contexts of the music it discusses, with all the connoisseurship and ‘gatekeeping’ this implies, but also needs to reflect what is happening now, today, and furthermore to spot the trends of tomorrow. It is required to perform a kind of balancing act, holding these elements together. The old weekly titles, with their remarkable turnover of copy and subject matter, dealt with this directly: who was in, who was out. These magazines functioned more as an information exchange than a consumer guide and this is a key difference between the newsprint weeklies of the past and the monthly glossy magazines which, since the advent of the compact disc in the mid-1980s, have replaced them. The oldest music weekly in the world, the Melody Maker, was founded in London in 1926, as a paper for working musicians, a kind of trade paper. It kept this function until well into the 1980s, with the rear section of the paper given over to ‘classifieds’ where bands looking for players or players looking for bands would advertise. This set it apart from the other weeklies in the period after the arrival of the Beatles which were chiefly consumer or ‘fan’ publications while the Melody Maker was the paper read by musicians, the people who actually played as opposed to simply listened – the producers rather than the consumers. The paper was published without interruption, even surviving the London Blitz, recording the musical life of the country even in the deepest days of the Second World War (1939–45). At first the paper included scores, competing with the established sheet music business, and developed the idea of popular song as being a subject worthy of critical scrutiny, effectively inventing the idea of music journalism. It had been in print for over twenty-five years before New Musical Express (note the claim on novelty in its very title) was even published, and the 9\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 9\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\n10\n\nMEDIA AND POPULAR MUSIC\n\neclectic mix of jazz, folk, blues, country, classical and rock and roll all treated equivocally continued until it closed in 2000. To meet the demand for pop writing, the Musical Express and Accordion Weekly had been bought by music promoter Maurice Kinn in 1952. Renamed New Musical Express (NME) from November 1952 it followed the example of the leading American music publication Billboard by publishing charts, initially of sheet music sales. This was the first time such figures had been made public in Britain. The paper thrived, according to Kinn, precisely because of this new, competitive dimension which it added to the marketplace – the chart changed the way people looked at pop and it snapped into clear focus the new postwar dynamic between art and the market. In acknowledgement of this Melody Maker felt obliged to introduce its own chart in 1958. The new world of the pop star and the chart rundown drove a burst of highly coloured magazine titles: Record Mirror, launched in 1953 by Isidore Green, embraced the new conditions even more rapidly than the NME, being the first weekly to assume the reader as non-musician and furthermore to be as interested in the lives and preferences of the performers as the music. It became a respected if more lightweight companion to the NME, the ‘poppiest’ of the weeklies, with the distinction of being the first national to publish an article on the Beatles. Another weekly, Disc, arrived in 1958, catching the waves of the 1960s and 1970s before eventually being absorbed into Record Mirror in 1975, which itself disappeared in 1991 by which time the musical and publishing landscapes had changed completely. It was the arrival of the Monkees on television in late 1966 that really opened up the music press, making a divide between the pop and rock papers which has never really been restored – suddenly there was music for kids and music for more sophisticated readers/listeners. The writing about the music inevitably reflected this. So for the fans of this new serious or ‘heavy’ music, a weekly called Sounds was launched in October 1970 by United Newspapers. This was expressly targeted at the new, proven to be literate audience who had made American magazines like Rolling Stone (1967–), Creem (1969–89) and Who Put the Bomp (1970–9) a success even at import prices. Never as left-field as the NME but more fan-based than the Melody Maker, Sounds shadowed the musical policies of the period closely, not unlike that of the BBC’s ‘heavy’ television programme, the Old Grey Whistle Test (see Mills in Inglis 2010), favouring American boogie bands of the early 1970s, then jumping on board punk quite quickly, then latterly talking up the ‘New Wave of British Heavy Metal’, a sort of heavy Britpop which gave us Def Leppard, Iron Maiden, Girlschool and others. The magazine also\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 10\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\nDANCING ABOUT ARCHITECTURE ?\n\n11\n\nunwisely got involved with the Oi! Punk offshoot in the early 1980s and never really recovered its reputation before being shut down in April 1991. Tellingly, the most enduring and successful spawn of Sounds was Kerrangg! magazine, a monthly niche title launched in 1981 by Bauer Media, targeted at the most loyal readers of Sounds, the heavy metal fans – the title of the magazine being an onomatopoeic invention, suggesting the sound of a highly amplified guitar chord of the type favoured by heavy rock players. Kerrangg! is now a global brand and franchise, alongside various media outlets on television and radio. It was not until 1986 that a mainstream rock and pop monthly arrived. Q magazine opened the floodgates for similar titles, all monthly magazines (Vox, Select, Mojo), which quickly became the dominant force in the marketplace for mediating popular music in print. Unlike the weeklies, which had focused firmly on this week’s news and events, the monthlies had the whole of music history to work with, and were well placed to present CD reissues as ‘rediscoveries’. The idea of a magazine that covered only what was happening this week became anachronistic, especially since the daily press was by now taking such an interest in pop. The successful monthlies combined humour and authority. This mix was partly borrowed from superior fanzines such as Zigzag (1969–86) which trumped the weeklies and led the way between the post-1960s comedown and the arrival of punk: such specialism survives in luxurious niche publications such as Shindig! (2007–). However, what really changed the landscape of music journalism in the UK was the arrival in 1978 of a glossy fortnightly magazine called Smash Hits; it successfully drew together disparate and even tribal musical forms by simply presenting them as what was fashionable and successful at that particular moment – in this its model was not unlike that of Top of the Pops, the BBC’s most famous music television show which would simply present what was popular each week regardless of genre. I spoke to Mark Ellen, the magazine’s most well-regarded and influential editor about his views on the business of writing about music. The mainstream pop and rock magazine editor – Mark Ellen of Word magazine The narrative arc of Mark Ellen’s career is effectively that of the post-punk British music magazine publishing industry. He began writing pieces for Record Mirror (1954–91), the NME (1952–present) and London listings magazine Time Out (1968–present) before\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 11\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\n12\n\nMEDIA AND POPULAR MUSIC\n\njoining Smash Hits (1978–2006) in 1983. He went on to found Q (1986–present), Select (1990–2000), Mojo (1993–present) and Word (2003–present) magazines, effectively indexing the growing-old of the original audience for writing about popular music in the UK. This was in addition to a stint of presenting the Old Grey Whistle Test for BBC2 between 1984 and 1987, including being one of the presenters for the BBC’s Live Aid coverage on 13 July 1985. I spoke to him about his work and how he saw the role of the music magazine as mediator of pop. PM: I’m interested in the lineage of the British pop magazine from Smash Hits to the Word. ME: Well I’ve been involved in all of those, so it’s a personal lineage, I’m not sure whether they’re part of the same family tree . . . they might be, I’m not sure, I’ve never really thought about that! Certainly there are people who started out reading Smash Hits when they were 12 or so, when I was working for it in the early 80s, then graduated to Q magazine, Select, Mojo and maybe Word now . . . I know this because people write and tell me! So I suppose people seem to like a certain sensibility about the things I’ve been involved with, which obviously must be something to do with my character coming through . . . [laughs] . . . they like the general feeling of the magazines, some kind of warmth or humour that they connect with. So here we see how, while the magazines were reflective of the musical output and ‘product’ of their time, the magazine was a kind of creative space in which responses to that ‘product’ could be shaped, played with, even manipulated. This has much to do with the nature of the approach to that task – Mark Ellen coins it as ‘a warmth and humour’ which comes through, and which exists as a kind of line of continuity running through the various titles and their responses to their subject, be that a one-hit wonder like Plastic Bertrand or the Beatles’ White Album. We spoke about how his connection to this lineage started out: PM: I remember my sister buying a magazine called Disco 45, which simply contained the lyrics to current pop songs and Smash Hits had a bit of that, didn’t it? ME: Well Smash Hits was launched off the back of the success of Disco 45 by a man called Nick Logan who had worked at the New Musical Express and had left the NME and was about to start The\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 12\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\nDANCING ABOUT ARCHITECTURE ?\n\n13\n\nFace from some offices off Carnaby Street, and the idea was to go into that pop market which he saw as a major, burgeoning area, off the back of disco really: the Bee Gees, Olivia Newton John, and all those disco songs that were such a great success in the 70s. You realised that there was an appetite for people wanting the actual song words, as there was no way of getting them . . . you couldn’t ‘Google’ the lyrics, and it seemed like a very important accompaniment to the single, if you were 12 or 13 and a girl probably – it was felt to be a girl’s market really – he used that idea as the basic structure for the launch of Smash Hits. So Smash Hits had its roots in the sense of such a magazine being a kind of mediator between an audience and the product – building on Disco 45’s utilitarian provision of song lyrics and capitalising upon shifts in mediation and the flow of information about individual songs and artists. ME: What happened was SH did incredibly well, it got lots of advertising, and it was able to expand in its pagination. However, we kept the number of lyrics the same and developed the amount of editorial, that was just humorous, interviews, reviews and observations and just created this whole club, really, for teenagers who were obsessed with buying pop singles and watching Top of the Pops. It was really aimed at people who weren’t old enough to go out . . . I always had this theory about it, it was like an electrical circuit, which started with the buying of the record, and then hearing the record on the radio and maybe watching the group on TOTP, and all you needed to link up the circuit was the printed lyrics, a poster or an interview . . . an encounter with the person making the record, and those were the three things we supplied to the circuit, and that’s what would turn the magic fairy lights on! It seemed to work . . . but a lot of the success of SH was that it had a rather psychedelic sense of humour I think. It looked at the pop landscape as being like a huge cartoon, and it managed to exaggerate the characteristics of the people who were the main players in that picture, so Morrissey was important, this English eccentric with a hearing aid and NHS glasses and gladioli stuffed into his back pocket, or Madness, these boys with their little cars . . . Simon Le Bon was this bulky character with a tea-towel swept across his face! We played them up into being these characters . . . which worked for and against the artists’ view of themselves of course, but let the readers in a bit.\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 13\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\n14\n\nMEDIA AND POPULAR MUSIC\n\nSmash Hits succeeded by acknowledging the new appetite for information about the personalities both of and behind the pop product. This it did by deliberately injecting humour into the process – this is something which the NME and Sounds had done at the margins, but only occasionally allowed into the actual text, when it could be a blunt instrument – as Chris Salewicz and Charles Shaar Murray recalled (Gorman 2001: 183), Bryan Ferry in particular became a target for the NME – all this being an offshoot of the ‘new journalism’ which came in on the coat-tails of punk. Prior to this, the press as a rule took its subject very seriously – this is why the earnest interviews with bands like Uriah Heep from 1973 in the weeklies now seem so arcane. This barbed humour was a development of certain aspects characteristic of writers like Nick Kent and Charles Shaar Murray pre-punk, and borrowings from the Lester Bangs school of music writing on publications like Creem. All of this still retained the sense that the journalist was ‘superior’ to the reader – a cultural gatekeeper’s role in effect – but the difference Smash Hits made was to bring the audience on board with the in-jokes – as Mark Ellen said, it ‘let the readers in a bit’. Clearly the sense of a readership in on the joke and belonging to a community was central to the magazine’s success – the escapist nature of pop, directly codified by the music and presentation of bands like Adam and the Ants, was echoed in the playful fantasies and high silliness spooled out in the pages of Smash Hits. This represented a dramatic shift in tone for the mainstream British music press, away from the seriousness of the monochromatic weeklies and into the brilliant candy-colours of the early 1980s scene, with videos and TV at the centre. Mark Ellen recalled such differences as being ones of temper as well as tone: PM: The weeklies, such as the NME and the Melody Maker, were built to do a different job . . . the psychedelic, brightly coloured humour of SH was refreshing in comparison and yet the two complemented each other very well. Do you think the style of SH as you’ve been describing it actually changed the way pop music was written about, in the British press at least? ME: Well that’s a really good point . . . I think maybe it did, for a number of reasons. One was that it wasn’t judgemental in the way the weeklies were because obviously it was aimed at a much younger audience, and I felt personally very strongly that you didn’t want to put all that in there necessarily . . . I’d come from NME when I was about 23 or 24, so I was surrounded by people writing 8,000 word articles about Devo, the overture to which\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 14\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\nDANCING ABOUT ARCHITECTURE ?\n\n15\n\nbefore they met the band in Los Angeles would be 4,000 words of conjecture and cant about themselves or their ridiculously illinformed views on the city . . . stuff that had nothing to do with the group at all! Now obviously that was a different readership but I felt that you should remove those obstacles and try and connect the people reading it as immediately as possible with the subject. They wanted to read about Madness, or Culture Club, they didn’t want us getting in the way, really. Another thing was that the magazine was quite funny and also very affectionate, it sent them [the acts] up and allowed them to send themselves up, and I think that was quite refreshing. So the weeklies were very ‘grey’ in content as well as look, printed in black and white while SH was printed in colour on good quality paper, so that was a fantastically revolutionary thing because the music that we wrote about only existed in colour, I think. The New Romantics in particular was a colour concept . . . a black and white picture of Spandau Ballet or Culture Club was meaningless! So to return to your question I think it did change things because SH also influenced the language a lot, not only in how musicians could be described but it started to invent its own language for its readers . . . idiosyncratic spellings and names for people, Simon Duran and the like, so that the act and the person became indivisible but very lightly so. Ellen suggests that the combination of humour and colour both reflected and created a strong sense of identity among the audience who followed these acts and, thereby, increased awareness of and emphasis on such aspects of representation within promotional mediation for the acts themselves – so if a black-and-white picture of Culture Club or Spandau Ballet was ‘meaningless’, in what way was meaning created? Ironically, Spandau Ballet’s roots were in the New Romantic or ‘Futurist’ club scene, in places like ‘Blitz’ in Covent Garden, ‘Heaven’ at Charing Cross and later in the ‘Rum Runner’ in Birmingham and the ‘Warehouse’ and ‘Le Phonographique’ clubs in Leeds where the monochromatic, high-intensity shadows and overtones of Weimar German decadence were a very important part of ‘the look’ and the attendant self-mediation – club-going as theatre. Here, black and white was most ‘meaningful’ indeed. However, by the time the ‘faces’ of this scene such as Boy George, Steve Strange and, more briefly, Marilyn were in Smash Hits as fully-fledged popstars the ‘colour splash’ was key. The colour harmonised with the new medium of the promotional video which, even in the pre-MTV landscape, was\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 15\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\n16\n\nMEDIA AND POPULAR MUSIC\n\nfast becoming the dominant promotional tool and which could make a substantial difference to the fortunes of a song and an act. Likewise, a group like Madness captured lightning in a bottle by matching their onstage personae perfectly to the new media – Madness existed as ‘characters’ both in and out of their videos, record sleeves and magazine interviews. This issue of intention and attitude is pertinent to the journalists themselves of course – they may have occasionally written like smirking teens but as Ellen confessed: ME: The thing was that at SH we were all over-qualified. We’d all been to high-ranking universities, all English literature graduates, ridiculously over-educated to be writing magazines for 12 year olds, but a lot of the best things are written by people who are pitching way over the heads of the people they are writing for . . . Neil Tennant was the assistant editor when I was editor, a fantastically clever and educated person, who worked literary and cultural references into his writing, political references, treating the audience as adults almost, even though it was written in a very straightforward way, simply even . . . this was probably as close as a lot of readers came to literature, they probably didn’t read much else apart from SH, and I thought that was quite good. We were up against NME, which was written by people a lot younger than us a lot of the time and I think while we were making quite complex things simple and legible, they were often making quite simple things extremely complicated, and overacademic . . . there was a great tendency at the NME to overdignify some substandard music, granting tremendous levels of cultural reference and authority to stuff which didn’t really merit it. If Ellen seems to underestimate his audience’s reading habits, he also makes an important point about how Smash Hits took a chance on contextualising complex ideas against the apparent simplicities of the pop formula while the traditional job of the music press was to talk things up – to make the simple thing seem complex. This connection of supposed ‘high’ and ‘low’ cultures was in itself innovative. It is partly a generational issue – these writers had grown up in the 1950s and 1960s, being both sure of the cultural significance of pop music while also being amused and entertained by it. This new style of analysis, double-edged with affectionate praise and reductive satire, was a consequence of these two approaches. So who were these writers and where did they take these innovations?\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 16\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\nDANCING ABOUT ARCHITECTURE ?\n\n17\n\nME: A lot of the people who worked on The Face, a very influential magazine, came from the Smash Hits stable – The Face was launched out of our office – Nick Logan didn’t have the money to hire an office so because he’d started SH and we were by then very successful we just let him have ‘the room at the end’ and that’s where The Face was launched and it was designed by the designer of SH, and it was written by people like myself, David Hepworth, Dave Rimmer, Neil Tennant, so a lot of that writing then graduated into a slightly older readership, so the influences spread in that kind of way too. PM: So writing about the same music but with different emphases? ME: Yes that’s quite right – Ian Birch, who was the other editor, went on to become the most successful editor, you might say, in the world as he was editor of the American TV Guide, the biggest circulation publication on the planet, and launched loads of magazines at EMAP while I was working with him there so I suppose we were quite an interesting bunch of people who went on to do a phenomenal range of things! Thus the success of Smash Hits, and indeed the production of it, mirrors that of the music it chose to spotlight – a reader might assume that the writer shared their enthusiasm for the music yet to some extent this was a confidence trick. To the writers, this was just another job to try and make a success of. Almost by accident, they succeeded spectacularly. One way in which music magazine publishing mirrors the industry it documents is the emergence of the copycat title – just as within twelve months of Amy Winehouse’s breakthrough success with Back to Black there were a dozen similar female vocal acts being marketed by competing companies, so an innovative successful magazine will swiftly spawn imitators even more quickly. Thus titles such as Number One and Flexipop soon arrived. The latter anticipated the advent of the free covermount CD, and the commercial advantages that that offers, by including a free ‘flexidisc’ featuring an exclusive track by a popular act every week – Soft Cell, XTC and the Jam all had tracks issued with Flexipop. Clearly there was a large market for this new kind of writing about pop, but by 1985 Mark Ellen had had another idea. PM: So how did Q come to develop out of the success of Smash Hits? ME: In some ways they were related because they were produced and edited with the same sensibilities and a lot of the same writers\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 17\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\n18\n\nMEDIA AND POPULAR MUSIC\n\nbut the basic difference was that the unit of currency of SH was the single, built around the idea that the reader – and acts – concentrated all their efforts and interests around the hit single. In 1985 the feeling was there was going to be a boom in the albums market, and there wasn’t actually a monthly music magazine at the time, amazing as it sounds. A whole generation of people had grown up with the weekly music habit so we knew the appetite was there, but what if there was a monthly magazine, which would give you the various advantages of higher quality paper, more durable photographic images, a little more conjecture, a lot more reviews? Q was originally based round a review section of over 140 reviews a month, that was going to be the chassis and everything else was to be the icing on the cake, all the stories and the interviews and the humour was just a bonus – we thought we were going to sell to an audience who would buy it because they felt they needed the review section. So the unit around which the whole thing was based was the CD, which was the other really important thing that happened, the invention of the compact disc. The shift in the main unit of currency from the single to the compact disc was the surface detail of a massive technological revolution not only in how popular music was packaged and consumed but also in how it was produced – the move from analogue to digital. A short piece in Sounds in 1974 reported that scientists at Sony in Japan were working on a system that would enable an album’s worth of music to be placed on a disc the size of a single (‘Don’t tell Yes’ was the sign-off line) and while discs by Abba and the Bee Gees were pressed up for demonstration purposes in the late 1970s and early 1980s, it wasn’t until 1983 that the system was launched onto the marketplace, in an excellent example of ‘vertical integration’, with Billy Joel’s album for Sony 52nd Street alongside Sony’s CDP-101 player. This changed the way people listened to music, how they stored it and what they expected from the source material. As a teenager I never listened to my second-hand copies of albums such as the Beatles’ Revolver, Bob Dylan’s Blonde on Blonde and the Young Rascals’ Groovin’ and thought ‘this would be so much better if that hi-hat cymbal was a little brighter’. I just loved the sound, pumping out of my cheap record player’s speakers. With the advent of digital audio, the consumer was suddenly obliged to take into consideration the perceived quality of that sound – in an old-fashioned term, the elevation of high-fidelity had been reset on the mountain top. Thus such sonic verities became a marketing angle – this is a superior product, with a superior price tag. CDs initially retailed in the\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 18\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\nDANCING ABOUT ARCHITECTURE ?\n\n19\n\nUK at anything up to £15, at a time when vinyl equivalents cost around £5. So the promise of much-improved sound quality became central to persuading people to buy their favourite albums all over again. No forty year old was going to be excessively interested in Adam and the Ants, so if a music magazine wanted to draw in those whom Mark Ellen described as having grown up with their ‘weekly music habit’ then here was something of an open goal – a valid way of writing about old music, rendered fresh by a new technology and of interest to an older readership with a disposable income. ME: We figured out – not that it was hard to figure it out – that what would happen is that people were going to go back and re-buy records they already owned on vinyl in this incredible new format and in so doing would reactivate their interest in the life stories and career arcs of these particular people. So I used to run a lot of editorial every month which would be ‘the Big Interview’ with Eric Clapton, Elton John, Van Morrison, Paul McCartney . . . all these people who were absolutely dead in the water, nobody wrote about them, because they didn’t fit into the scheme of things at the NME or the MM, for whom these characters were well past their heydays and headed for ignominious retirement. So these acts were fantastically cooperative . . . you can’t get interviews with many of them now, but then . . . Elton John was falling over himself to give us an exclusive, for someone to take him seriously. So we really made hay, and it succeeded in a very short time, and it [Q] took off very quickly. Mark Ellen’s claims about the status of the 1960s peer group of musicians might seem somewhat far-fetched in 2012 but are true at least as far as the music press goes; none of this generation were getting any coverage in the weeklies – why should they? – and pre-Internet, pre-digital communications, and long before the mainstream daily newspapers took an interest in pop beyond gossipy material, they were still wholly dependent upon the printed music press for such publicity. I wondered if this all somehow tied in with the growing narratives surrounding older musicians as their careers and back catalogues grew: how popular music – the postwar quicksilver celebration of the ‘now’ – had acquired a history. PM: So where the weeklies had a necessary emphasis on what’s happening right now, or what might be interesting in the immediate future if you want be a little ahead of the game, a\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 19\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\n20\n\nMEDIA AND POPULAR MUSIC\n\nmagazine like Q, which takes the current scene on via reviews and so on, also illuminates the stories of where all this stuff came from makes those connections and gives the subject a history? ME: That last point, about history, is an excellent one and the most important one to make about Q or any of the other titles I’ve worked on since, really. I was at the NME when punk happened, in 76/77. Then, a completely artificial line was drawn in the sand and it was said that ‘everything starts now’. So I’d go out and interview the Clash and I was well aware – we were the same age – that they all had musical histories, grown up listening to 60s music, glam rock, Krautrock, whatever, they didn’t just come out of the box fully formed . . . you were actively discouraged from not making any genealogical connections, no family tree style references to the old age of rock music as it was seen then, with a few exceptions – you were allowed to write about Iggy Pop as he was deemed to be the Godfather of Punk. Lou Reed, David Bowie . . . but no one else seemed to have a future. What Q did was to open up this idea that rock history was this glorious story with all these chapters started in 1955, and that everything was interconnected, so that what happened in 1962 influenced what happened in 1968 which then impacted upon events in 1972 . . . no one had looked at this that way before. We also looked at the career arcs of these people which I found fascinating. Bob Dylan had to make his mediocre, directionless albums in the 80s in order to reach Oh Mercy. It was a complete fiction to take his backstory and narrow it down to a very limited number of records that the NME decided to adopt and pronounce worthy, where they fit into their own philosophy and where they don’t they just ignore them all! One of the features of the digital music market was the co-presence of a whole range of an artist’s material – David Bowie was the first artist to have his whole back catalogue reissued in this new format, as early as 1985, the 1968 and the 1984 albums sitting beside each other on the rack – the complete works on the shelf. It was an invitation to explore that whole ‘arc’ as described by Mark Ellen. The CD also made a great volume of hard-to-find material current and freely available in a way that vinyl did not. PM: The CD’s impact was also about stuff simply being available wasn’t it . . . suddenly you could find all this stuff, all in the same place, no more scouring second-hand vinyl shops . . .\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 20\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\nDANCING ABOUT ARCHITECTURE ?\n\n21\n\nME: That’s so true, and you can imagine how I felt . . . it was the best job in the world! Who am I going to write about? Is it Richard Thompson? Or XTC? Or even a then-relatively new band like the Jesus and Mary Chain? They’ve all got a history, and all benefited hugely one way or another from the compact disc. Also, to be a little more tetchy if I may, people were initially mesmerised by the sonic quality of the CD, the whole thing was that it took out the crackle, the surface noise, and we wrote pieces about what you could hear on them, I remember David Hepworth wrote a most marvellous piece on how you could hear the buzz on the string of Keith Richards’ guitar, you felt like you were in the room with them, and that old fashioned idea of putting the headphones on and listening to music very closely and acutely reawakened people’s interest in those musicians and how that music was made. This level of attentiveness to the actual technical details of the sound was important – Q had for several years a ‘hi-fi’ review section – and the magazine understood that this new market rested in some way on the technical details as much as the musical content. This, as Ellen notes, made Q the transitional publication for the UK music market. ME: We were just making hay, while others were still struggling with this other agenda, as to how this fits in with our world view, on the campus, which is where all that was aiming, still. I felt we had an open goal really, I didn’t feel like we had any competitors. Although we fairly soon did actually, every time we launched a magazine IPC would launch a rival a few months later, we launched SH they launched Number One, we launched Q and they launched something called Vox, then Uncut which was their answer to Mojo . . . I’m waiting for their response to Word actually [laughs], it’s been going for years now I don’t know what’s the matter with them! I think a lot of the success of Q came from us crediting the readership with the intelligence and appetite for something different. Ellen’s claims to ‘credit the readership with intelligence and the appetite for something different’ echo his earlier feeling about the inclusiveness of the signature style of Smash Hits. This is a central element in the publications in which he is involved – a kind of connoisseurial encoding which fosters a sense of loyalty to the title, the style, the writers. Hence over time a reader will migrate and follow these aspects\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 21\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\n22\n\nMEDIA AND POPULAR MUSIC\n\nfrom title to title as the editors and writers do likewise. Ellen tried to buck this trend somewhat with his next move, a title called Select (1990–2000) which spanned the 1990s, not quite knowing where to lay its money down – rock? Dance? “Indie-Dance”? Modern or heritage acts? It had the disadvantage of launching at a time notable only for the fairly low-ebb era of pop it was obliged to document. Ellen described it as ‘like the B-side to Q, a totally different thing, an early 90s alternative to Q really’. It clung feverishly to Britpop, but the magazine is the one failure in this story, and when the editorship was passed to John Harris Select went down fast and it barely survived the decade of its inception. Meanwhile, Mark Ellen had founded another title which took the universal heritage aspects of Q onto a yet more connoisseurial level: Mojo. First published in 1993, it was unashamedly historical in content, featuring the Beatles, Bob Dylan, the Who and Bruce Springsteen on its cover many times, displaying sound business sense as ABC figures (which record magazine sales) show clearly that these front covers sell their respective issues. But what was the logic behind launching a title like this in the days of grunge and very early Britpop? ME: Well with Mojo, the difference there was that Q was a mainstream publication and when we launched Mojo at EMAP there was a lot of pressure on us to have some commercial success, they were very much driven by the idea of something which was going to bring a return – Q made a lot of money, still does actually – so when we went to present Mojo, I was asked to present it to the board and the idea was that this was going to be a cult magazine. I can remember saying ‘this will cost you £4million’, which it did, and also that ‘we will pay that money back quite quickly, but it will never be a mainstream success like Q magazine, and shouldn’t be judged against Q. It was in a parallel universe to Q – what it was intended to do, in terms of the company’s profile, was to cover EMAP with glory because this was going to be very credible, and very cool, and very authoritative and a very critically respected publication which would make EMAP as publisher look pretty good, rather like the image of Condé Nast supplied by the New Yorker. It cost £4m to launch, which is very little money actually, and I can remember them saying to me when I presented the magazine to them, the board of EMAP said ‘who are these readers?’ and I said ‘I know all of them personally, their names and addresses!’ and they thought this was very encouraging. In fact they got their money back very quickly indeed – it broke even in thirteen\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 22\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\nDANCING ABOUT ARCHITECTURE ?\n\n23\n\nmonths which was phenomenal you know? And the great irony of all this is that for a little cult magazine which is meant to be aimed at people with a very specialist interest in rock music . . . so by the time the CD catalogues had really developed it wasn’t just a case of going back and buying records you really liked it was going back vertically, exploring right back to the beginning, with some artists you’d maybe never heard of before . . . so people were going back and looking at things that had a certain aesthetic quality to them, very singer-songwriter, mainly cult acts I suppose, some are mainstream now, but not then . . . so it was for people who’d followed the career paths of these artists but also newcomers . . . really in depth. We ran a piece on Frank Zappa . . . Zappa died actually just as we’d finished the third issue, and I’d decided to put him on the cover of the fourth issue and it was an unbelievable runaway commercial success, because nobody else was doing that, recognising Frank Zappa as being significant in 1994 . . . so it was quite different. And it was designed differently, by a brilliant graphic designer called Andy Cowells – when we were working on the early layouts he asked me ‘what sort of a magazine do you think this is?’, and I replied ‘it’s kind of handcut’. I was working on this piece about The Band so showed him this picture of them, around the time of their second album, backwoodsmen kind of thing, in the mountains. PM: Sepia toned . . . ME: Sepia toned, exactly, and he said, oh, right and disappeared, and came back about half an hour later and started busying himself in the corner, he’d been out and bought a load of lino, and he was physically handcutting from the lino patterns and headlines to print onto the page! It was a handcrafted thing, a real labour of love. We used to call it the most expensive fanzine on the block. Of course Mojo was not a fanzine – had it been so, it would not have had the advantages of the colour pictures, the luxurious paper – the first issues of the magazine are a tactile treat, silken paper, deep and saturated colour photographs, the aesthetics of luxury realised in a magazine. Mojo addressed the apparently boundless availability of music as the CD catalogues Ellen cites were growing way beyond the guaranteed sellers and the mainstream market for rebuying worn vinyl. It also facilitated the embedding of a rock canon beyond the usual special cases of Beatle, Dylan and Rolling Stone recordings.\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 23\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\n24\n\nMEDIA AND POPULAR MUSIC\n\nPM: It seems to me these magazines do provide a way in for acts on the margins to get a way in, a foot in the door as it were, via these magazines which have this connoisseurial gloss to them, and that transfers itself to the act so that someone like Tom Waits who would never be mainstream in the broadest sense is still now a commercial success and a publication like Mojo, initially at least, helped these people get their reward, the recognition, the status and also the sales. ME: Well you’re absolutely right . . . Jeff Buckley is a good example, perhaps. Grace was a masterpiece, out of nowhere! But a rock press had been invented that could take those fringe artists seriously and devote time and space to them . . . one of the differences between these titles we’re talking about is that Q was there to reflect the commercial hierarchy, so that means if someone sells a lot of records, you have an obligation to cover them, so that, for example, Queen would get as much coverage as, say, Dylan or a more cult artist and ultimately I learned from that experience that that was probably the wrong way to do it, even for Q. If an act sells 300,000 albums, then there should be an available pool of people who might want to read about them, but that isn’t how it works. Phil Collins sold hundreds of thousands of records in that era but his audience were only slightly interested in him as a person, he didn’t have a specialist audience, whereas Tom Waits or the Smiths, who didn’t sell many records in the early days, had a level of interest that was absolutely enormous! So I very soon discovered that while certain people may not have an enormous commercial draw, they are the ones with the most devoted followings – those are the ones who are going to be the big commercial engines for magazines. It was only at the end of my time at Q that I worked this out, I felt like I had a moral obligation to write about Fleetwood Mac or Tracy Chapman or whoever was flavour of the month because they were just so popular I felt duty bound to do it! Yet you didn’t get much return from that kind of thing . . . I kept going back to the people who sold. That was what happened at the NME when I was there . . . The Clash didn’t actually sell many records at the beginning, you’d go to see them on the south coast and they weren’t even filling their venues, but they were selling 200–250,000 copies of a weekly newspaper, so they were selling five times as many papers as they were records! This tells you that the folklore of the Clash was somehow more marketable than their music!\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 24\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\nDANCING ABOUT ARCHITECTURE ?\n\n25\n\nThe rewriting of history is pertinent – the UK’s biggest selling acts of 1977 were the Bee Gees, Abba and Leo Sayer but you’d never know that from the cultural histories made of that year. Yet as Ellen notes, acts such as these had in the main audiences who were satisfied with the pleasure the music provided and did not necessarily have a hunger for deeper analysis or personal details of the sort craved by Smiths or Tom Waits aficionados, for example. Ellen’s example, the Clash, illustrates the transformative power of writing about music, in that acts who were not particularly revered in their own time come to assume great retrospective significance. This can also be said of Nick Drake, Joy Division and, further back, the Velvet Underground. Mark Ellen had a sensitive observation to make about this phenomenon: ME: Yes I always think there’s a connection with some of the 70s people, people like Roy Harper [1970s singer-songwriter] and so on, their presence in the press and perceived significance was totally unrelated to their record sales which were always very low, but these guys are now burdened with enormous fame, but very little financial reward for it. Same for members of the Damned. This icily illustrates the difference between the type of cultural value placed upon an artist and their work by the mediation of the music press and how that critical acclaim translates (or not) into commercial reward. We are reminded of Nick Drake’s late song ‘Hanging on a Star’, a tune which Joe Boyd has several times asserted was a direct response to the shortfall Drake saw between what people told him about his musical talents and the almost complete indifference of the record buying public to his work in his lifetime (see Boyd 2006). There is little virtue in the high praise of a journalist when one is penniless. By the time he left Mojo, Ellen really had nowhere left to go in terms of chasing down the traditional routes of music writing and publishing – his innovations had become standard practice, adopted right across the growing music magazine market – consider how closely magazines covering classical music or jazz or folk resemble the models he laid down at Q and Mojo. Five years divided the end of his tenure at Mojo and the launch of his next project, The Word, in September 2003. I asked him about the purpose of his returning to the magazine market and his ambitions for the title. PM: The Word began trying to offer a wider cultural view rather than just being a music magazine – am I right?\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 25\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\n26\n\nMEDIA AND POPULAR MUSIC\n\nME: Definitely, and I’ll tell you the reason for that – or one of the many reasons for it – this is a magazine aimed at people over 30, 35, right up to their 50s and 60s even, and it’s aimed at people with a very clear understanding of what they like and what they don’t like . . . you can sell NME to a load of people who are suggestible, really, they’re impressionable and you can convince them to like something because it’s fashionable. The readers of Word are older and wiser and they kind of know what they like, grumpy old men and women if you like, and they know what conforms to their tastes and standards and what doesn’t, and part of the reason that it’s not just about music is that in order to interest and entertain them then music is probably not going to be able to supply everything every month, and also that much of the music we write about is informed by the broader popular cultural landscape . . . the books that people are writing, the films that are being made. . . so that’s one of the reasons. The Word was indeed initially pitched as a kind of latter-day Rolling Stone, taking in a wider cultural range – ironically, just as the NME had done before punk – such as film, books and observations of popular culture in general: its original strapline was ‘At last . . . something to read!’, emphasising the writing rather than the promotional content. It was good, but often read like a trade publication – the ‘insider’ model which had yielded such great rewards at Smash Hits, Q and Mojo had here been reduced down to a language which often felt as if it were directed toward a small group of media professionals – not unlike a consumer version of Music Week. This limited its appeal as a commercial concern and the magazine struggled for a while until it shifted toward music as its core concern and is now firmly a music title. Surprisingly, it sometimes bears an aggressively conservative tone, appearing suspicious of innovation. Perhaps this is appropriate, however, as Word is possibly the logical end-point for this kind of print-based music journalism – the original generation of writers and consumers are now well into middle age and freer mediations of responses to popular music are firmly established – the blog, free of editorial control, being merely the most obvious example. I asked Mark Ellen how he envisaged the future for his own magazine and for the wider industry: PM: What’s your view of Word’s virtual presence? The website is very busy with podcasts, message boards and so on – which way\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 26\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\nDANCING ABOUT ARCHITECTURE ?\n\n27\n\ndo you see the magazine going? Will there be a stereo separation of hard copy and online versions? ME: One of the reasons so much effort was put into the website is that a monthly frequency just seemed slow, it always did in a way but now seems even slower in a world where there isn’t any news. This is the problem for the monthly market in the last ten years or so . . . the monthly market was powered by the fact that you were publishing news – facts that people didn’t know. Now of course, every single fact is leeched out of the source very early on and there’s nothing that people don’t already know . . . if the Smiths are reforming they already know that, they’re not going to find that out from the cover of a magazine! So a month seems like a very long time, when during that month the readership of a magazine like ours have just soaked up vast amounts of knowledge and opinion, so the effort was put into the website to try and create this community, where the magazine fed into the website and the website fed back into the magazine and so it goes on, keeping that whole idea of a community and debate alive, kindred spirits connected in this virtual world. It keeps them in touch with the world of the magazine and keeps their interest in the magazine up, and we then hope they will carry on buying the paper version of it. I say virtual world, we’ve had two instances of contributors to the website organising parties in pubs where they all meet up and occasionally invite us along – it used to be the other way round, a magazine would have a party and a lucky reader might get to go . . . now the readers arrange parties and we’re lucky if we get to go! That’s got to be a good sign! Here we see the natural endpoint of the line of continuity that has run through all the titles we have examined here – the effort to keep readers loyal by creating a community. Now the competition isn’t a handful of similar titles but the unceasing flow of information, from the individual artists’ websites to MSN News. The core readership now claim not only membership of an elite club – just like the kids poring over their Duran Duran posters and composing letters to Smash Hits – but also a kind of proprietorial claim, a form of ownership of the ‘idea’ of the magazine and a shared belief system as to what is important. I asked whether he would ever consider publishing a magazine exclusively online: ME: Well I don’t know if that’s a decision that’s particularly up to us really . . . it’s up to the way things are going to pan out. I’d\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 27\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\n28\n\nMEDIA AND POPULAR MUSIC\n\nlike to ask that question to Rupert Murdoch! He’s investigating paying millions to put tons of stuff online and charge for it, it’s a huge subject, but obviously if people are getting vast amounts of information and entertainment they used to pay for in print free online then by rights it should be possible to try and monetise that; but as far as I personally am concerned, I think this system [as employed by The Word] works really well and I appreciate that ALL magazines are under pressure because there’s a bit of an advertising drought at the moment but I also firmly believe, in fact I can be tiresomely evangelical about this, that print media offers you various characteristics that are absolutely inimitable, unique and irreplaceable. It’s pretty obvious what they are; you can edit your reading of a magazine anyway you want to, you can publish an editorial with depth and perspective that you just can’t take on board if you’re reading off a screen or if it’s coming to you via other broadcast media, such as TV or radio. These magazines are the only medium for substantial, three-dimensional journalism I think. You can read it and re-read it twice if you want to, here’s the diagram, look at the picture, construct the whole story in your head . . . there’s also something very attractive I think about the paper product! Mark Ellen’s final comment is important – the old-fashioned media has survived not only because of its convenience or otherwise, but because of its apparently infinite adaptability, and the tactile pleasures of holding and exploring a three-dimensional artefact as opposed to an image on a screen. Just as a box of love letters beats a bundle of printed e-mails or the memory of a text message, they are cherishable and tangible evidence that the past once was. As Ellen said to me, ‘you can collect them, re-read them, they have a real value and a real place in our lives, and I fondly hope that isn’t going to disappear.’ The next few years will prove this to have been true or the final phase of this kind of writing about popular culture. What’s certain is that the way popular music is written about in the UK publishing market would have been very different without the influence and input of Mark Ellen, and readers, writers and the music industry itself all have reason to thank him for that. The daily newspaper journalist – Laura Barton, The Guardian Laura Barton is a journalist who joined The Guardian in 2002. She has written about a whole range of topics, both musical and non-musical\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 28\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\nDANCING ABOUT ARCHITECTURE ?\n\n29\n\nin content, but is perhaps best known for the fortnightly column ‘Hail, Hail, Rock’n’Roll’. She left the paper as a full-time employee in early 2010, although she still contributes to it on a regular basis including ‘HHRNR’. She has also made programmes for BBC Radio 4 and is a Contributing Editor to Q magazine. In July 2010 she published her first novel, Twenty One Locks. I asked her about her career and the relationship between popular music and the daily, mainstream news press. PM: How and where did you begin writing about music? LB: I did little bits and bobs of writing about music when I was at school and sixth form – I remember answering the essay topic of ‘How I Spent My Summer Holidays’ with a detailed account of how I had spent the six-week stretch of holiday falling in love with the Pixies’ song ‘Hey’. Later I edited the sixth-form magazine and occasionally wrote pieces on music, and I wrote for a couple of trifling things for fanzines, and later for my university student paper [Barton attended Worcester College, Oxford]. But largely I viewed music as too precious to write about, or perhaps I felt I wasn’t quite ready to write about something so dear to me, and so it wasn’t until I joined The Guardian that I began writing about it properly. PM: Was music part of your remit when you arrived at The Guardian? LB: No, not at all. I joined The Guardian straight after university – in fact I was offered my job before I sat my finals, and the editor who hired me was the Features editor. He had very specific ideas about what I should and shouldn’t write about, and for some reason he saw writing about music as a kind of waste of my writing. I did odds and sods of course, because they knew that I knew a lot about music. And then I think his opinion began to change when I did an interview with Johnny Borrell of Razorlight. Barton’s observation that someone the paper thought highly of – being hired as a journalist before even graduating – would be regarded as wasting their talent on writing about music is startling, given how much space popular music occupies in the contemporary British mainstream press. It reveals something of how such a publication is constructed – that they might prioritise material that they feel they ought to include to ‘appease’ their readership rather than believing it worthy of skilful scrutiny. The mixed reputation of music journalism\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 29\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\n30\n\nMEDIA AND POPULAR MUSIC\n\nmay also have something to do with this – we recall that Frank Zappa referred to music journalism as being ‘written by people who can’t write for people who can’t read’. So when a talented writer like Laura Barton is sufficiently interested in such a subject then something interesting may well begin to happen. PM: How did you come to be asked to write the fortnightly column ‘Hail, Hail, Rock’n’Roll’? LB: Around 2003/4 I became good friends with Michael Hann, an editor on another section of the paper, and a large part of our friendship was based on a shared love for rock’n’roll. He worked in another building, and we would often e-mail one another at great length about favourite lyrics, or our passion for Jonathan Richman, and the like. Occasionally we made one another mix CDs. And a while after we started going to gigs, or first discovering that we’d been at the same gigs. And then we began a club night together. A couple of years later, Michael was appointed editor of the Guardian’s Film & Music section, and he set about implementing a redesign, which would include a new music columnist. I remember we discussed this column at length, with me making suggestions for people who might be good, and he tried out an awful lot of people. It never occurred to me that I might even be a contender, since I never saw myself as a columnist, plus I knew there were many other music writers who had written for the section for a lot longer. However, shortly before the redesign Michael begged me to write the column, since unbeknownst to me what he had been hoping to launch was a column that was very much like our e-mails about music – very intimate, and less cynical than most music columns, something that could convey the joy we feel about rock’n’roll. Barton’s good fortune was to connect with a like-minded fellow journalist and between them they were able to make something new happen – as she says, ‘Hail, Hail, Rock’n’Roll’ is distinguished by its approach to the subject, which owes little to the tone or vocabularies of established music journalism. There is a sense of freedom of form and a lightness even when the topic feels ‘heavy’. The example reproduced in the appendix of this book is a good example of this process. I wondered whether her obligation as a mainstream journalist to write about a whole range of topics helped her to write in this new way about music.\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 30\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\nDANCING ABOUT ARCHITECTURE ?\n\n31\n\nPM: Do you consider yourself a journalist who writes occasionally about music, or a music writer who also works on a wider range of subjects? LB: Increasingly the latter. I generally tell people that about 50 per cent of what I do is music writing, but in truth it’s where my heart lies. I’m happy to write about other subjects, but it never makes me as happy as writing about music. I think the only thing that comes close is when I’m writing about nature. I feel a similar sense of awe for both subjects. PM: Do you have to negotiate for your music-based content in The Guardian or can you submit ideas as you wish? LB: For my column I can write whatever I please really. For bigger articles it really works both ways – sometimes I get asked to do things, and other times I pitch them. It’s sometimes tricky to keep G2 sweet at the same time as writing music articles. They get a bit grumpy about it. But they also ask me to write any music pieces that come up – though they tend to be foisted upon me rather than the music I love. Clearly there is a trade-off here, where the writer has a certain ‘space’ in which she can ‘write whatever I please, really’ but also finds that material is ‘foisted upon’ her. Furthermore her employer wished that she would place more emphasis on her non-musical output. Her mentioning of nature as something which inspires a ‘similar awe’ to music points to both her view of music as something fit for celebration (‘Hail, Hail . . .’) rather than cynicism but also connects it to the wider world of experience and not confined to a prescribed corner where it is kept in its place. Her 2009 Guardian series ‘Barton’s Britain’, which also had an online life as a series of short films which developed and complemented the written pieces, is a good example of how her writing reaches up under the influence of nature as powerfully as it does when focusing upon music. I wondered if in order to write well about a piece of music she had to like it a good deal. PM: Is there a style or manner of music which appeals to you as a subject in particular? LB: To be honest I love a really broad selection of music – 50s rock’n’roll to punk to pop. I mean I’ll happily dance to Girls Aloud and Chuck Berry played back to back. But I readily admit that I have some kind of natural affinity for slightly melancholic and what you might call lyrically-governed music, often with a more acoustic leaning – Van Morrison, Bob Dylan, Bill\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 31\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\n32\n\nMEDIA AND POPULAR MUSIC\n\nCallahan, Bon Iver, Bonnie ‘Prince’ Billy, Cat Power, Joanna Newsome. But I love garage rock and a nice bit of AC/DC too. Some of these names appear in her columns and some don’t but what is clear is that what interests her isn’t necessarily governed by genre or indeed age. Her working definition of ‘slightly melancholic . . . lyrically-governed music . . . with an acoustic leaning’ covers a lot of ground, from the blues onward. This can be of benefit to artist as well as listener and reader, of course – for example, as she notes later, her eloquent advocacy of the work of Justin Vernon who records as ‘Bon Iver’ had a great impact upon his success in the UK. So I wondered how this new way of writing about pop related to what she had read in the press and magazines as a consumer rather than a producer. PM: Did you read music magazines or weeklies while you were growing up? LB: Oh yes! First Look-in, and then Smash Hits, in its heyday, which I loved. Then Q, because it was written by all the Smash Hits bods. And Select, and then Mojo and many, many others. I pretty much spent all my pocket money/Saturday job earnings on music magazines and records. Interestingly, perhaps, I never liked the NME. Maybe it was just the time – it was particularly gnarly then, but it was the cynicism and the vitriol I couldn’t stand, or indeed relate to how much I loved music. I read it to know the bands, but that was really all. In this reply her enthusiasm and wide reading in the form seems to have both grounded her writing in the styles available to the pop writer but also showed her clearly what she didn’t want to do – that is, the model of rock and pop journalism as embodied by the NME of the early to mid-1990s. What grew out of this mediocre era was an increased presence of popular music in the daily mainstream news press as a subject fit for consideration and focus, and allowed journalists like Laura Barton to mix specifically music-related work with more traditional newspaper topics. PM: In the 1970s and 80s pop music was largely only covered by specialist publications – how and why do you think dailies now offer such comprehensive coverage, and what impact has this had on the specialist market? LB: I’m not sure when exactly . . . probably in the mid-90s, and I would imagine it had to do with a generational shift, with the fact\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 32\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\nDANCING ABOUT ARCHITECTURE ?\n\n33\n\nthat now this generation of men and women who were perhaps the first to grow up thoroughly steeped in popular music had become the writers and editors of mainstream publications. That may not be true. But I think it definitely has something to do with popular music becoming acceptable and widespread while these people were growing up, and so it would be hard to keep it as an underground ‘youth’ phenomenon. Maybe also punk in that way had a lot to do with it – that generation which came of age and documented the punk movement in the late 70s and early 80s would probably be reaching positions of authority by the 90s. Barton is correct in identifying this generational shift and evidence is everywhere; for example, Courtney Love was asked to chair an editorial meeting at The Guardian in 2009 and musicians are frequently consulted on matters of the day in the press or on television shows such as the BBC’s Question Time. Following on from this, we might consider how a writer might switch between registers of expertise and those suited to a more general readership; there is a range of assumptions of reader knowledge – musical styles, personal narratives – which a writer for a specialist magazine can draw upon which are not necessarily present in the audience for a daily paper. PM: Do you change register between publications, so that you write one way for, say Q or The Word, another for The Guardian? What is the difference between writing for a specialist publication and a daily newspaper? LB: In a lot of ways, yes I do change my voice, if we can call it that. It’s nice writing for specialist press because you don’t have to explain everything. I remember writing an interview with the Kings of Leon for the Guardian Weekend magazine, and the editor called up and asked me who the Allman Brothers were. That kind of thing is frustrating. There are frustrations writing for magazines too – they tend to be staffed by men, and particularly men of a certain generation. It’s quite boys clubby, and the kind of writing favoured is probably that heyday Q-era style, which I love, but it’s not what I do really. However, I know that’s more what they want me to deliver. The writing that I enjoy most and that feels the most ‘me’ is the HHRNR column, and in part that’s because I have an editor I trust. Here, via the unlikely case of 1970s US rockers the Allman Brothers, we see the distance between the domains of specialist music writing\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 33\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\n34\n\nMEDIA AND POPULAR MUSIC\n\nand the perceived obligation of the dailies to offer coverage of the same music. Yet as she notes, the music magazine world has its own rules and essentially conservative infrastructures too. It is the task of the journalist, much of the time, to deal with and write about topics which aren’t necessarily ‘me’, as Laura Barton puts it. How does a writer deal with this? PM: Some writers have mentioned to me that occasionally they struggle while interviewing/writing about music they do not care for – how do you deal with this apparent difficulty? LB: Oh lord, it’s difficult. I don’t have to do it too often, thankfully, but sometimes I just run out of things to say or ask or whatever. It’s a lot easier in a funny way if they’re some sort of pop phenomenon, because then it becomes a bit of a dance, or there’s more to play with, or it can be a comedy. I find it hardest if they’re some hip new band, some next big thing, and you have to speak to the whole band en masse, and they’re deadly earnest, but you don’t really passionately love their music and it’s hard to muster enthusiasm, somehow, you know? Traditionally the British music press did not need to make these leaps of the imagination – indeed part of the point of papers like the NME in the 1970s and 1980s was to deflate and denounce as much as it was to praise or promote. So the kind of sustained campaigns mounted by the NME against the likes of Bryan Ferry in the 1970s and Morrissey in the early 1990s simply could not happen in the pop coverage provided by the daily press. There is a changed dynamic between the music industry and the people who write about it. Furthermore, this kind of negative campaigning cannot be conducted in the monthlies, who unfailingly give positive write-ups to their interviewees. A contemporary writer on pop has to be ready to formulate and express considered opinions on music they do not necessarily like. This reins in of some of the most passionate writing that has distinguished pop journalism, but also seems like a good thing too – the music, not the journalist, has to be the focus. I wondered how this shift in the power balance toward the consumer and the producer, with the journalist now functioning as a kind of mediator rather than arbiter of taste, has altered the cultural status of the music writer: PM: Can music journalists working today be as powerful as taste makers and ‘cultural gatekeepers’ as writers in the 1970s/1980s undoubtedly were?\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 34\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\nDANCING ABOUT ARCHITECTURE ?\n\n35\n\nLB: Well, I suppose readers, listeners and watchers have more options now, more things to read, the whole Internet at their fingertips, giant record stores, iTunes, Amazon, a million publications, an increased quantity of reader-generated content . . . and in some ways that’s great and massively exciting. In others it means it’s a lot of voices to listen to. I think music writers still can be very important though – you know, Pitchfork maybe proofs that pudding. And I think great authoritative, intelligent criticism still stands and has an important role. I don’t know how powerful my role makes me, but I do know I get a phenomenal response when I write something, and I know it does generate sales . . . Bon Iver is, I guess, a case in point in my own career. The rise of a great clamour of voices is in direct opposition to the music weekly model where the journalist’s voice was unchallenged and the readers’ letters page was the only place in which the consumer could have a say. Presently, as Laura Barton notes, there is an almost unlimited array of places to read about popular music and one could read a score of wildly differing opinions on any recording with a single Internet search. This idea of ‘reader-generated content’ has destabilised the authoritative assumptions surrounding the music journalist and, as Mark Ellen noted, this can extend to the point where a magazine like The Word seems to be more about being a meeting place, virtually or in the real world, for consumers than it does about actual scrutiny of content. Yet Barton is quite correct in asserting that ‘authoritative, intelligent criticism’ still has ‘an important role’, citing the online magazine Pitchfork. Art is not entirely understood through the assessment of market value or whether we feel we have had our money’s worth. This issue came up again when I asked about the limits of writing about as opposed to listening and experiencing the music. PM: Have you ever been defeated by a piece of music while trying to write about it? LB: Hmmm. No. But I tend to only really tackle a subject if I know what I feel about it, roughly. There’s nearly almost always a ‘revelation moment’ while I’m writing – somehow my brain works better when I’m in the thick of writing, I think, but generally I sit down to write about a piece of music because I want to tell you something about it. So there is a kind of missionary zeal behind Barton’s work which lies at the root of all great critical writing. This ‘revelation moment’, where\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 35\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\n36\n\nMEDIA AND POPULAR MUSIC\n\none discovers and extrapolates an idea simply by concentrating on it and writing it down connects with novelist E. M. Forster’s renowned maxim from The Art of the Novel ‘How can I know what I think until I see what I say?’ (Forster 2009: 24), that is in order to understand what you think about something, you need to write it down – it is not just a case of knowing everything already and just ‘downloading’ it onto the page. The writing is a creative act, a form of discovery; the mediation is both observation and creativity. Having made this observation, what might be the music journalist’s view of other music writing? PM: What is your favourite piece of writing about music? LB: It might be something by SFJ [Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker]. I loved a piece he wrote about R Kelly in the New Yorker a while back. I love how damned thorough he is. I was actually reading another piece of his lately, about Bruno Mars, and trying to pinpoint what I love about his writing. SFJ is a musician himself and I think you can tell that in the rhythm of his writing – rhythm is such an important thing for me in writing, and I love the rhythm he has. But also I think it’s a certain precision he has that I admire. He has this obvious vast wealth of knowledge which makes his writing have weight, and seem so unhurried, and his sentences so finely-turned. Plenty of music writers can do that, I know, but SFJ marries it to something else – he’ll suddenly deliver a single line that has a warmth or a humour or a particularly arresting image, or something that just seems very human rather than encyclopaedic. The R Kelly piece was a prime example, because it never took the easy route or chose the cheap gags, but rather discussed Kelly’s musical contribution while never losing sight of its fundamental amusingness. He writes quite differently to me – I’m more about the sensual effect of the music, a sort of immersion technique or something, I’m more messy and emotional, so I really savour that precision he has. The other candidate might be the bio Peter Robinson wrote about Girls Aloud, in which he linked conveyor-belt pop to Britain’s manufacturing history. That was just spectacularly British writing, to me, very different to that SFJ style of broad strokes and precision. It was such a mingling of pride and humility, which I think of as a very British state, and it was funny and moving in a really understated way. I think it might have been because Peter Robinson gets how important pop music is to people – not just to critics and music aficionados, but to the people going out on a Saturday night in Doncaster, the people\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 36\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\nDANCING ABOUT ARCHITECTURE ?\n\n37\n\nwho make requests on the local radio station, just how pop – in its purest, unapologetically manufactured state – is what soundtracks people’s lives. His piece about Girls Aloud was really such a celebration of that, the antithesis of the intellectualised New Yorker writing, perhaps, but just as effective, just as heartwinning. So the combination of writers here is an intriguing one – Sasha FrereJones is a critic, free to say what he wishes in theory, and works in the rarefied environment of the New Yorker magazine while Barton’s other nominated writer, Peter Robinson, performs a PR function. Here we have two distinct worlds of music writing – the cultural gatekeeper and the salesperson. Distinct, yet inextricably linked – the latter may sway the former, and the former may control the levels of success of the latter. They are two aspects of the same process of selling. Barton acknowledges this in her closing observation that both can be ‘just as effective’ in the process of winning hearts. I wondered if, like musicians, music writers find themselves submitting to their influences and allowing their style to reflect this. PM: Are you aware of any strong influences upon your writing? They could be other writers or not. LB: I’m not massively influenced by other music writers. I’m in total awe of other music writers of course, but I don’t feel especially influenced by them or in competition with them either. I’d say I’m influenced by certain novelists or poets, and indeed certain lyricists, and funnily I find I can write best to certain songs, which in some way must be an influence. If I’m writing, I’ll often listen to one song on repeat, regardless of whether that is the song I am writing about. Recent-ish examples might be James Blake’s version of ‘A Case of You’ or ‘Beauty’ by the Shivers. I can listen to Bon Iver’s For Emma, Forever Ago, and quite a few Van Morrison songs, as well as Bob Dylan singing ‘You’re a Big Girl Now’ (the Biograph version). I also have this playlist called ‘Stolen Car’ on my iTunes, which consists only of three songs – Bruce Springsteen’s ‘Stolen Car’, Cat Power’s ‘I Found a Reason’ and Smog’s ‘Left Only With Love’. If I can’t find a song that soothes and settles me enough to write I put that playlist on, on repeat. They’re three perfect writing songs, for me. I think actually, looking at the songs I have named the perfect writing songs are all quite melancholy and quite soulbaring, and they all have a point in them, to me, where they kind\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 37\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\n38\n\nMEDIA AND POPULAR MUSIC\n\nof reach an emotional peak, and when I get to that point in listening I feel myself unlocking a little, or giving way, or opening up, and that’s the state I like to be in when I’m writing. This probably sounds ridiculous, I realise, but it’s as if they are songs capable of penetrating the layers, or getting to the raw bit of you, and I think that’s where the interesting thoughts, the interesting writing comes from. The notion that it might cost the writer something – emotionally as well as in time and energy – to produce their copy is, surprisingly, an unusual one in music journalism, which has frequently struggled with a culture of jaded cynicism. There is still that connoisseurial dimension here, specifying a particular version of a Bob Dylan tune, and the repeated use of a certain selection of tunes seems to act as a kind of charm or spell which, as she says, opens up and unlocks the possibilities of responding properly to the music that is under discussion. It’s worth noting, too, that the music she listens to at such points is not the music she is writing about. As the mediation of the written text spread, there was a spillage of the better writers into other media, as the same generational shifts described by Barton have led radio and TV schedules to begin to reflect the history and narratives of popular music cultures – not only in the expected places, such as music stations like the BBC’s dedicated channels, but also in the cinema, as subject for documentary and socio-cultural analysis, and talk radio. Barton has written and presented a couple of short shows for BBC Radio 4 discussing lyrics and matters arising with the likes of Jarvis Cocker, and I asked how this had impacted upon the mediation of music via her writing style: PM: You have also begun contributing music journalism-based programming to BBC radio – how has this new form of delivery changed your writing style? LB: In a funny way it has reinforced it. I’ve always been really conscious of rhythm in my writing – I want it to sound beautiful, even if you’re reading in silence. If that makes any sense at all. One of my biggest complaints in fact when someone edits my work badly is that they lose the rhythm. Writing for radio therefore seems a bit of a gift. The lack of the internal gatekeeper of the editor or sub-editor seems one of the things which enables her broadcast work to, paradoxically, most closely approach her original ambition and meaning for her\n\nMILLS PRINT.indd 38\n\n29/03/2012 16:38\n\nDANCING ABOUT ARCHITECTURE ?\n\n39\n\nwriting. The rhythmic sense of a work may well be opaque to someone simply looking for ways to reduce a word count and hence carefully constructed phrases may often be simply pulled apart. In this sense the writing"
