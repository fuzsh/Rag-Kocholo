(NYSE: ASPN) (\"Aspen\" or the \"Company\"), a technology leader in sustainability and electrification solutions, today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2024, and discussed recent business developments.\n\nTotal revenue for the second quarter of 2024 was $117.8 million, compared to $48.2 million in the second quarter of 2023. Net income was $16.8 million, compared to a net loss of $15.4 million in the second quarter of 2023. Net income per share (diluted) was $0.21, compared to a net loss per share (diluted) of $0.22 in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2024 was $28.9 million, compared to $(10.8) million in the second quarter of 2023. A reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA is provided in the financial schedules that are part of this press release. An explanation of this non-GAAP financial measure is also included below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\n\nRecent Business Highlights & Quarterly Performance\n\nCompany revenue of $117.8 million, up 25% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) and 145% year-over-year (YoY)\n\nThermal Barriers: $80.8 million of revenue, up 24% QoQ and 540% YoY\n\nEnergy Industrial: $36.9 million of supply constrained revenue, up 27% QoQ and 4% YoY\n\nEnergy Industrial segment remains on path to deliver over $150 million of revenue in 2024; shipped $28.3 million of revenue from our external manufacturing facility in Q2, an increase of 94% QoQ. Carbon capture projects are beginning to present additional market opportunities.\n\nDelivered gross margins of 44%, a 7-percentage point improvement QoQ and 26-percentage point improvement YoY\n\nNet income of $16.8 million, an $18.7 million improvement QoQ and $32.2 million improvement YoY\n\nAdjusted EBITDA of $28.9 million (25% margin), a $16.0 million or 124% improvement QoQ and $39.8 million improvement YoY\n\nOperating income of $20.0 million, a $17.6 million improvement or 720% QoQ and $37.0 million improvement YoY\n\nCash generated from operations of $6.8 million in the quarter\n\nEnded second quarter of 2024 with cash and equivalents of $91.4 million\n\n\"This quarter's results demonstrate the significant operating leverage of our business model as we continue to utilize a higher percentage of our current capacity and effectively execute our strategy,\" commented Don Young, Aspen's President and CEO. \"We saw strong revenue and profitability growth across both of our business segments. Our Thermal Barrier segment revenues continue to accelerate as our customers ramp production to capture demand. The supply for our Energy Industrial business is increasing, as we nearly doubled our revenues from our external manufacturing facility. We remain confident in our ability to capture the significant excess demand in this segment.\"\n\nUpdated 2024 Financial Outlook\n\nAspen updated its 2024 full year outlook as follows:\n\nThe Company's 2024 outlook assumes depreciation and amortization of $30 million, stock-based compensation expense of $14 million, other (income) expense and income tax expense of $9 million, and diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 79.3 million for the full year.\n\nRicardo C. Rodriguez, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer noted, \"We remain ready to capture additional revenues as our automotive OEM customers win their fair share of the market and as we increase our Energy Industrial product supply. Providing additional context to our updated outlook, we continue planning objectively around the production track record of our OEM customers, the tightening global emissions regulatory environment, and an EV market that favors recently launched models, many of which are equipped with PyroThin®. We believe that delivering results as demand presents itself, versus attempting to calculate outsized upside expectations, makes the most sense.\"\n\nA reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the 2024 financial outlook is provided in the financial schedules that are part of this press release. An explanation of this non-GAAP financial measure is also included below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\n\nAspen may incur, among other items, additional charges, realize gains or losses, incur financing costs or interest expense, or experience other events in 2024, including those related to the planned capacity expansion, supply chain disruptions, or further cost inflation, that could cause actual results to vary materially from this outlook. See \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\" below.\n\nATVM Department of Energy Loan Status Update\n\nLate last year, we announced that the U.S. Department of Energy Loan Programs Office invited Aspen into the formal due diligence and term sheet negotiation stage of the process. The Company continues to progress with the Department of Energy during this process. In June 2024, after a public notice period, the Department of Energy released a Final Environmental Assessment and issued a \"Finding of No Significant Impact.\" While the DOE's determination is not an assurance that the DOE will issue a loan, the Company remains deeply engaged with the Loan Programs Office and its advisors and continues to believe that Aspen is a strong candidate to partner with the DOE Loan Programs Office in this program.\n\nLast Twelve-Month Financial Comparison\n\nA comparison of key financial metrics for the trailing twelve-month periods ended June 30, 2023 and 2024:\n\nConference Call and Webcast Notification\n\nA conference call with Aspen management to discuss second quarter 2024 results and recent business developments will be held on Thursday, August 8, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. ET. During the call, management will respond to questions concerning, but not limited to, Aspen's financial performance, business conditions, and financial outlook. Management's discussion and responses could contain information that has not been previously disclosed.\n\nShareholders and other interested parties may call +1 (833) 470-1428 (domestic) or +1 (929) 526-1599 (international) and reference conference ID \"517793\" to participate in the conference call. In addition, the conference call and an accompanying slide presentation will be available live as a listen-only webcast hosted at the Investors section of Aspen's website, www.aerogel.com.\n\nFollowing the live event, an archived version of the webcast will be available on Aspen's website for convenient on-demand replay for at least a year. A copy of this press release is posted in the Investors section on Aspen's website.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIn addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), Aspen provides an additional financial metric that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP (\"non-GAAP\"). The non-GAAP financial measure included in this press release is Adjusted EBITDA. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as a measure of operating performance because the non-GAAP financial measure does not include the impact of items that management does not consider indicative of Aspen's core operating performance. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA (i) for planning purposes, including the preparation of Aspen's annual operating budget, (ii) to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of its business, and (iii) as a performance measure under its bonus plan.\n\nManagement believes that this non-GAAP financial measure reflects Aspen's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in its business, as it excludes expenses and gains not reflective of Aspen's ongoing operating results or that may be infrequent and/or unusual in nature. Management also believes that this non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating Aspen's operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. This non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measure does not replace the presentation of Aspen's GAAP financial results and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, Aspen's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. In this press release, Aspen has provided a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Management strongly encourages investors to review Aspen's financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure.\n\nAbout Aspen Aerogels, Inc.\n\nAspen is a technology leader in sustainability and electrification solutions.
