The most popular song in the US that same year? You guessed it, \"Physical\" by Olivia Newton-John. \"Eye of the Tiger\" by Survivor came in second followed by Joan Jett with \"I Love Rock 'n Roll\" which came in third. https://thestranglers.co.uk/ 06/22/2024 01:06 PM\n\nDJ: Morgan This song, written by Rod Argent, has a lot of distinct elements that made it a rock classic and landed The Zombies in the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame in 2019. For starters, the lead instrument is Rod Argent's electric piano, which was very unusual at the time - in the UK it was the first hit song with that lead instrument. And then there's the breathy vocals of lead singer Colin Blunstone. Check out KEXP's video of The Zombies playing SXSW in 2013: https://bit.ly/3wC0iTH"
