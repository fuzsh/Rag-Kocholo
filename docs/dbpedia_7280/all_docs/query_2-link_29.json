        "text": "Peter Brown (1) provides this shot with the explanation that the Baker Street set was in this building at the back of the Granada Studios site. He adds that it currently houses the 'Crystal Maze' experience but plans are afoot to return the building to TV production once more. (RL)\n\nTo take this shot Pater walked down the location of the old Coronation St (tarmac now, not cobbles), turned left just after Rosamund St, and ended up at the back of the Baker Street studio and tells us that the building in the background is the 1830s Warehouse which was built at the terminus of the world's first intercity railway between Manchester and Liverpool. (RL)\n\nPeter Brown (2) continues his dedication to providing comparison shots for this film with a visit to Salford where he found that the building that stood in for the Russell Club has been demolished. However, Magnolia Court is still standing in the background having had a refurb. The fencing and bollards are still present! (RL)\n\nTony, Lindsay (Shirley Henderson) and Alan Erasmus (Lennie James) follow club owner Don Tonay (Peter Kay) after striking a deal for the use of the venue. The Staff Car Park of the Salix Homes Housing Office located by Andrew Jackson, who was a caretaker for Salford Council and Salix Homes for 17 years. The building is now disused and stands opposite Paddington Close on Churchill Way.\n\nPeter moved over to the other side of Manchester to Longsight, where the Santley Street area has been remodelled to give a modern take on inner-city living. With it, though, comes cars! The telegraph pole, however, tells us that he was in the right spot. (RL)\n\nAnother replacement shot from Peter for a Neil Rigby Google Earth View. Looking north up the A34 Princess St from underneath the Mancunian Way. The former offices of Factory Records is just out of sight in the middle distance. Peter Hook, bassist with Joy Division/New Order, has converted this to a club called, unsurprisingly, Factory. As with all Factory endeavours, it has been given a catalogue listing, in this case FAC251. (RL)\n\nObtaining a photo from the top of the warehouse is now impossible as an apartment block has been built on top of it and is shrouded in scaffolding. So Peter took this reverse shot from ground level. The old roof-line can be established by following the top windows. (RL)\n\nLooking at Manchester through the window of a studio as New Order rehearse 'Blue Monday'. Whilst providing the 'now' shot for this capture Peter Brown (1) explains that this was filmed from the top floor of the Boardwalk (see next capture). In consequence, he explains, the Haçienda is just out of sight on the left behind the railway arches. The grey building on the right was built on the site of the Gaythorn Gas Works. The semi-derelict building in the foreground once housed T J Davidson's studios where Joy Division used to rehearse, the interior of which can be seen in the 'Love Will Tear Us Apart' video. (RL)\n\nOnce again Peter could only obtain a ground level shot but here it can be seen that T J Davidson's has been replaced by the Ropework's apartments on the left, and the grey building, behind the pointed white canopy, has been reclad red/green and is now called Number One First Street. A public square called Tony Wilson Place has been built in front of this building and the nearby 'HOME Manchester' arts centre. (RL)\n\nTony discusses the sleeves for New Order's first release with Peter Saville (Enzo Cilenti) in a split screen showing, to the left, what was the 'New York Street' of the Granada Studios Tour in Manchester following its closure to the public. Identified by Mark Mark, 'Starlight is the entrance to the 'Starlight Theatre' which was formerly the entrance to the New York DeVere Hotel when the tour was open. At the start of the sequence an American style yellow fire hydrant can be seen below the bus stop! Mark Mark adds that \"Interestingly, the whole area has been consumed by Manchester's new arts and culture venue 'The Factory' which is named after Factory Records, the subject of the movie!\"\n\nAs per the screen capture, Peter has skilfully provided a split-screen. The left shows The Factory arts centre under construction on the site of the Granada Studio Tour, Water St. This will be the permanent home for the Manchester International Festival whose aim is to develop new work of international renown. It is, of course, named in honour of Tony Wilson who had his day-job at Granada TV, and was a fantastic ambassador in promoting new cultural talent in Manchester. On the right is the Boardwalk which, along with the Hacienda, was at the centre of the 'Madchester' music scene of the late 80s/early 90s. This was a multi-functional space comprising club, rehearsal studios, and gig venue that, amongst many other things, hosted the first gig by Oasis. The scene in previous capture was filmed from the window by the chimney stack. Tony Wilson's flat was opposite the Boardwalk at No. 10a, Little Peter St. (RL)\n\nThis area of Salford has also been remodelled for modern city living, and is now known as Chimney Pot Park due to the rows and rows of chimneys that can be seen from a nearby elevated park. Thank you Peter. (RL)\n\nWhen Neil Rigby provided his confirming Google Earth View he said \"Bear with me a second on this. There have been a lot of redevelopments especially to the row of shops to the right. This is an entirely new building.\" Providing this shot, Peter adds \"The shops have been replaced by the Emmanuel Church, just out of shot on the right.\" (RL)\n\nPeter Brown found some changes to the shrubs and trees but the view is more or less the same. He acknowledges that he should perhaps have been a little further back but fencing, gates and security made it all rather challenging.\n\nShaun Ryder and the Happy Mondays travel to Barbados to write and record music. Neil Webster advises that the film's DVD commentary states that this was shot on an island off the south coast of France when the crew were in Cannes.\n\nAfter their return from the Caribbean, the Happy Mondays head to The Haçienda. Facing east on Whitworth Street West. Phill Gatenby advises that interior scenes of Haçienda were shot on a set built inside an old warehouse on Pollard Street in Ancoats M4 which has since been demolished and replaced by, you guessed it, apartments. How does he know? He was an extra!\n\nAnother scene filmed from the roof of the Haçienda, so Peter had once again to resort to ground level work. The building in the screen capture with the pointed turret is the City Road Inn, being unable to gain access to the roof, he took this reverse shot from the City Road Inn showing the Haçienda apartments which replaced the (in)famous club.
