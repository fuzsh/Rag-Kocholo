        "text": "The city of Manchester is known for its music life and post-punk movement including bands such as Buzzcocks, the Smiths, the Stone Roses, and Joy Division. At that time, Manchester has been all about deindustrialization, Thatcherism and the youthful refusal. Joy Division with Ian Curtis as the frontman are nowadays still linked to the urban environment and social history of the city in the 1970s. Anton Corbijn’s Control is just one film of a series of biographical films that explores Ian Curtis’s life in Joy Division and the imprint of Manchester’s legacy on his lyrics, way of thinking and presence. This essay aims to identify and highlight certain indicators and images within the film Control that frame the idea of a “broken down, bleak and spacious Manchester taunted down by the ghosts of the Industrial Revolution” (Morley, 2008, p. 13). Therefore, the essay generates a new reading of Anton Corbijn’s film and discusses different forms within it: industrial aesthetics, the representation of Manchester and its culture, cinematographic means, fashion, mindsets, voices etc. All in all, the aforementioned aspects should generate a statement of how the post-punk movement and Manchester’s 1970s are depicted and visualized in Corbijn’s Control from 2007.\n\nThis work is centred on four different documentaries: Hype! (1996), Made in Sheffield: The Birth of Electronic Music (2001), High Tech Soul (2006) and 7 ages of rock: What the world is waiting for, British Indie (2007).They focus on four different music scenes which gave rise to specific music genres: grunge in Seattle, British indie in Manchester, electronic pop in Sheffield and techno in Detroit. These music scenes took place during the eighties and nineties.\n\nThe question of how rock is narrated in cinema raises very interesting issues in the context of the current scientific debate concerning audiovisual communication and the methodologies of its analysis. Gaining an understanding of the configurations taken on by the relationship between form and substance, content and container, can open up useful perspectives in the analysis of a range of materials which have not yet been the subject of a specific enquiry into the structural organization of sound and image. In spite of the heterogeneity of genres and directing techniques, these films do seem to represent a category possessing unitary features; the values they express, as indeed the similar narrative and formal procedures, lay the foundations for a shared language based on recurrent situations and strategies.\n\nThis special issue aims at pushing the discussion on the relationships between avant-garde arts and popular culture far beyond traditional scholarship on the topic, stressing the concept of cultural history more than the specificity of film, media and music histories. By adopting a global perspective, the authors will elaborate useful analytical and. theoretical tools to re-assess the “avantpop connection” as a dynamics of two-way exchanges across several artistic and media domains and different geographical and historical contexts."
