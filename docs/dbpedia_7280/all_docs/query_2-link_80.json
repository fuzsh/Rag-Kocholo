        "text": "Undoubtedly amazing work!!! Undoubtedly amazing team!!! Experiencing dailies and get inspired by our amazing supervisors and the directors was mind-blowing!! But...hear me out. And this is NOT Sony targeted or anything . I just wonder about the sustainability of our industry as a whole.... I just can't wrap my head around it. Can someone please shed some light on why there are so many incredibly talented individuals out there who are struggling to make ends meet? It's mind-boggling to think that they are grappling with this madness. I mean, the whole excuse of \"no project available\" during a strike just doesn't make sense to me. Aren't there countless studios bidding for numerous shows every year, causing us all to work overtime just to meet the deadlines? Could someone please enlighten me on why the shows we pour our hearts into are celebrated worldwide and raking in millions, yet so many artists are left drained, burnt out, and desperately searching for work to make ends meet? It's disheartening to see some of the most talented people I know struggling. How are they even managing to keep going? How does anyone find the strength to carry on after facing such challenges? We all know it, we all live it. The conditions in most studios are far from ideal, to say the least. But as passionate artists, we soldier on, driven by our love for what we do. However, in the end, all we're left with is a pizza or a little gift and a thank you, as so many have pointed out. But these conditions are simply not sustainable. And now, to add to our worries, AI is threatening to take over some roles as well. How can we ensure that this art, this industry, doesn't wither away due to the lack of support and enthusiasm we once had when watching movies like this? Someone, please, tell me... CAN we, as a collective, come together and make it sustainable for ALL of us? . . . . . . . #thoughtoftheday #layoffs #discussion #collectivegrowth #pleaseshare\n\nWhat IF your imagination could come to life? Kids know something that we donâ€™t as adults. They see possibility. They discover and solve problems through this overlooked thing called play. We KNOW for a fact that kids learn and implement better through play. Itâ€™s science. So why do we make adults do the same tasks with grit, hustling, and beating their head against the wall in the praise of productivity? What if play could make your team, and you, more productive, innovative, and actually enjoy work again? â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Want to discover how to make your team more productive through play in 2024?
