        "text": "24 Hour Party People takes the same punk approach to storytelling as its subjects did to music, playfully throwing off the dull constraints that often make based-on-a-true-story movies feel like uninspired celluloid translations of a Wikipedia page.\n\nFull Review | Nov 25, 2023\n\nTony Wilson's and \"24-Hour Party People's\" tossed-off philosophy was that the worst of times, like the best, pass away - never truer than in the fickle music industry. A free-form view of a freefall where artifice and artistry tumbled head over heels.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/4 | Sep 25, 2010\n\nThose wishing for a full-on, comprehensive look at the era will be disappointed, but Winterbottom, Coogan, and Boyce serve up a vivid and lively thumbnail sketch.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Jan 7, 2005\n\nWhen it comes to capturing music in a visual medium, 24 Hour Party People ranks right up there with Martin Scorsese's 1978 rock documentary, The Last Waltz.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/4 | Jun 25, 2004\n\nIt is probably entertaining if you are at least remotely interested in, or knowledgeable about, punk music or the rave scene. If not, forget it.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: C | Dec 22, 2002\n\nFrom a pure structure standpoint, 24 Hour Party People is extremely interesting and original. Surprisingly slow moving, however.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Dec 18, 2002\n\nThis is Cult Movie Central -- and there's no livelier tour guide than Michael Winterbottom.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Dec 8, 2002\n\nSteve Coogan makes a likeable enough narrator, and director Michael Winterbottom uses enough cinematic tricks to keep things interesting. Still, for those not in the know, 24 Hour Party People can seem 24 hours long.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5 / 5 | Dec 4, 2002\n\nDirector Michael Winterbottom has pulled off an inspired act of self-referencing, post-modern filmmaking that does these people, their attitude, their home, their music, and their legacy proud.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/4 | Dec 4, 2002"
