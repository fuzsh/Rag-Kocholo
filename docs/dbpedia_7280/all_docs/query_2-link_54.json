        "text": "Our live coverage has ended. Follow the latest 2024 election news here or read through the posts below.\n\nFact check: Trump falsely claims that \"nobody was killed on Jan. 6\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump falsely claimed at a Mar-a-Lago news conference Thursday that “nobody was killed on Jan. 6.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true.\n\nAshli Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran from Maryland, was fatally shot by a US Capitol Police employee as a mob tried to force its way toward the House Chamber. Three other people died of “medical emergencies” during the riot. In addition, Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who was attacked with pepper spray during the riot, died after suffering strokes the next day; the medical examiner found that Sicknick died of natural causes, but also told The Washington Post that “all that transpired played a role in his condition.”\n\nTrump downplays abortion as election issue\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he believes abortion “has become much less of an issue” ahead of the November election.\n\n“I think it’s actually going to be a very small issue,” Trump said.\n\nTrump repeated that he believes in abortion exceptions for instances of rape, incest and the life of the mother.\n\n“I believe strongly,” he said Thursday in Palm Beach, Florida, at a news conference. “I think that that’s a very important thing.”\n\nCampaigns spent more than $82 million on presidential advertising last week\n\nWhile the spotlight has been on both parties’ vice presidential nominees in recent weeks, it’s the top of the ticket that has remained in focus on the airwaves as presidential ad wars continue to escalate.\n\nAcross the country and a series of key battleground states in particular, ad spending soared to the highest single-week total of the presidential campaign so far last week, seeing a combined total of more than $82 million in presidential advertising. Democrats outspent Republicans during that stretch from July 30 through August 6 by about $50 million to $32.6 million.\n\nSince President Joe Biden withdrew from the race, Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign and its allies have launched a mix of ads, both promoting her record and biography and attacking former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Trump campaign and its allies, meanwhile, have poured millions into amplifying concerns about immigration and crime, assigning equal blame to Biden and Harris.\n\nThese are the states that saw the most presidential ad spending last week, according to AdImpact data:\n\nPennsylvania: $24,877,707\n\nMichigan: $13,020,410\n\nGeorgia: $10,922,648\n\nWisconsin: $9,488,567\n\nArizona: $7,286,918\n\nNorth Carolina: $3,864,215\n\nNevada: $2,628,978\n\nHow Harris is having to navigate the war in Gaza on the campaign trail\n\nVice President Kamala Harris tackled the angst within her own party over the conflict in Gaza head-on at a campaign rally in Detroit Wednesday night, moving quickly to shut down protests interrupting her event.\n\n“Because we believe in democracy, everyone’s voice matters, but I am speaking now,” she said as a group of about eight women interrupted the event with pro-Palestinian messages.\n\nAs the shouting continued, Harris grew blunter, saying, “If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking.”\n\nThe episode highlights how Harris is navigating the complex dynamics of the Israel-Hamas war on both the diplomatic level and a political one as she now leads the Democratic ticket.\n\nThe conflict in Gaza has proven to be a key issue for progressive and young voters as well as Arab American and Muslim communities. That includes those in the critical battleground state of Michigan, which is home to significant Arab American and Muslim communities including in cities like Dearborn.\n\nLike Biden, Harris is confronting a political and diplomatic tightrope not entirely in her control. While the White House holds out hope for a hostage and ceasefire deal that would bring an end to fighting in Gaza and lower regional temperatures, the power to reach such an agreement rests with Hamas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — neither of whom has given final sign-off.\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters have pressed for the United States to wield pressure on Israel using arms sales and other assistance as leverage — decisions that, for now, are not Harris’ to make. While Biden has said he would withhold some weapons shipments to Israel, he has so far stopped short of major steps that would cut off American assistance to its ally.\n\nIn substance, her positions have not been at odds with Biden’s. Behind the scenes, however, she has advocated for a more empathetic approach to the Palestinians and in public has sometimes struck a more forceful tone than Biden when discussing the situation in Gaza.\n\nAnalysis: Trump stays home, leaving Vance to challenge Harris and Walz for the Midwest\n\nIt was the first big day of the wrestle for the Midwest that is likely to decide the 2024 election, and someone important was missing — former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Republican nominee left it to his vice presidential pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, to troll the newly minted Democratic ticket through the critical swing state territory Wednesday as a fresh 90-day race for the White House burst into life.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and her new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, held two high-energy rallies in Wisconsin and Michigan that showed the euphoria inside a once-despairing Democratic Party for its two new candidates.\n\nThe Democratic nominee borrowed a trick from Trump’s playbook, performing a dramatic arrival scene aboard Air Force Two in Michigan that mirrored his past use of the bigger presidential jet before a packed airport rally.\n\nFor the second day in a row, Harris appeared before thousands of excited supporters who spelled out a collective warning sign for Trump — who is known to obsess over crowd sizes. She appeared to be quickly settling into her novel role as her party’s official candidate, displaying flashes of charisma and increasing confidence as her political honeymoon showed no signs of ending.\n\nRead the full analysis.\n\nTim Walz’s political evolution: From moderate Democrat to progressive champion\n\nThe Trump campaign is eager to define Tim Walz as a far-left liberal on the wrong side of the culture wars, particularly when it comes to his support for transgender youth.\n\nHis backers, however, call him a “prairie populist,” focused on meeting the everyday needs of working Americans, as demonstrated by policies like free school meals for kids and paid family and medical leave. They say that if he’s changed, it’s because his constituents have, too.\n\nDemocrats say they think Republicans will struggle to paint Walz as an ultra-liberal, and that many of the criticisms the Trump campaign is launching at Walz – from his handling of the protests in the wake of George Floyd’s murder by a police officer to raising questions about his military service – already fell flat during the governor’s 2022 reelection bid. Walz won by nearly 8 percentage points.\n\nHow it started: Walz’s political career began when he flipped Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District – a red, rural seat that had only been held by one other Democrat in 100 years – in 2006, a wave midterm year for his party. Walz went on to serve six terms in the seat, which is now represented by a Republican.\n\nDespite his more conservative voting record in the House, there have been several through-lines in Walz’s policies. Healthcare has been a key part of his platform since 2006, when he campaigned on lowering costs. He later voted for the Affordable Care Act, which made him a target during the Tea Party wave of 2010.\n\nHow it’s going: His biggest shift has been on gun control. Though he’d previously received an A rating from the National Rifle Association and is an avid hunter, he donated his NRA contributions after the October 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting. In February 2018, following the Parkland shooting, he wrote a Star Tribune op-ed seeking to clarify his stance in support of “common sense” gun reforms.\n\nWalz faced blowback on the issue during his 2018 gubernatorial campaign, particularly in his Democratic primary.\n\n“I’m a staunch supporter of Second Amendment rights to own firearms,” Walz said in an interview explaining his about-face. “But I also recognize the need to have some common-sense changes in this. I reject the notion that it’s one or the other. Those folks out there who are responsible gun owners ― their hearts are breaking every time you see one of these shootings.”\n\nRead more about Walz’s political journey here.\n\nToday's campaign schedule: Harris and Walz in Michigan as Trump holds news conference\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris will speak at a campaign event in Detroit, Michigan, around 3 p.m. ET on Thursday.\n\nHarris will appear with her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz before they travel to Phoenix, Arizona, for an event.\n\nThe duo were welcomed by a massive crowd in an airplane hangar in Detroit during their first joint rally as the presumptive Democratic ticket in the battleground state of Michigan on Wednesday.\n\n“It’s been a pretty interesting 24 hours for me, I have to be honest. I don’t know how I can explain to you walking into that arena in Philly or that field out in Wisconsin or right here, to what I have been told is the largest rally of the campaign,” Walz remarked to the thousands of Michigan voters crowded into an airplane hangar, many standing for several hours packed together on a sunny day.\n\nMeanwhile, former President Donald Trump announced he would be holding a news conference at Mar-a-Lago at 2 p.m. ET Thursday.\n\nCNN’s Ali Main contributed reporting to this post."
