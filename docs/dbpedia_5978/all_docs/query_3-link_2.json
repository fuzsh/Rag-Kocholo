A little boy encounters an old man who tells him he and his friend were the first people who landed on the Moon, and all the news of Neil Armstrong being the First Man is a lie.\n\nThen he tells his story. In a flashback he is convinced by a scientist and inventor to go on a journey to the Moon with him. On the Moon they encounter aliens and so on.\n\nThe movie ends with the old man finishing his story.\n\nWhat was the name of the film? Was it also based on the novel the 1964 movie was based on?"
