        "text": "You may not know this, but Jim Carrey kinda went completely insane when he was playing Andy Kaufman in the biopic Man Made Moon. Jim Carrey pretty much became Andy Kaufman in every way when he was making the movie and even when cameras weren't rolling, he was still going all out Kaufman. It was so bad and the studio was so embarrassed by his behavior that they never wanted to the on-set footage to be released.\n\nWell, we have a very entertaining trailer for an upcoming documentary called Jim and Andy: The Great Beyond – With a Very Special, Contractually Obligated Mention of Tony Clifton. The film focuses on Carrey's madness during the shoot and the actor himself even talks about his experience shooting the film as he examines the behind the scenes footage of himself inhabiting the role of Kaufman for the first time. Carrey says in the trailer:\n\n“Universal didn’t want the footage we took behind-the-scenes to surface so that people wouldn’t think I was an asshole.”\n\nThis doc looks absolutely fascinating. I loved Carrey's performance in Man on the Moon, but I had no idea that he took it this far! It's pretty amazing. It also looks like he was extremely difficult to work with. Here is Netflix’s official synopsis for the film:\n\nDirector Chris Smith’s fascinating deep dive into actor Jim Carrey’s time spent portraying famed and complicated comedian Andy Kaufman. Using approximately 100 hours of footage shot on the set of Man on the Moon documenting Carrey’s transformation into Kaufman for four months.\n\nJim Carrey earned critical acclaim and a Golden Globe for the performance, but many of the production’s most Kaufmanesque moments played out behind the scenes, thankfully captured on video by Andy’s former girlfriend, Lynne Margulies and former writing partner, Bob Zmuda. In Jim & Andy, Carrey looks back at the resulting footage 18 years later, reflecting on how he and Andy came up in oddly parallel universes, his experience channelling Andy and Tony and more broadly the spiritual journey of his career.\n\nJim and Andy: The Great Beyond will premiere on Netflix on November 18, 2017."
