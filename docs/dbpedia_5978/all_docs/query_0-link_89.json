        "text": "In any genre, or really anything at all there are classics, classic cars, books, and of course, of importance here classic movies. I have probably seen fewer than most of these classics. Star Wars I would guess is pretty high up the list, but I haven’t seen for instance Titanic. Well that’s not strictly true, I acted in a production of it, so I do at least know the plot outline and I’ve seen the drama played out on stage. Ok fine. I’ll watch it at some point, along with Gone With the Wind, Casablanca, It’s A Wonderful Life and many more films besides, that I’ve yet to see. But how and why does something become a classic? What determines that? And how about Sci-Fi and the classics of that movie genre?\n\nIt seems to me that ‘classic’, at least in the case of films, boils down to a movie that can stand the test of time, and that has hallmark qualities which make it emblematic of other films (usually less successful) of its type. Now, I’m aware that the concept of a classic is complex, and one many have been up in arms over, so my simplistic explanation may be far from adequate. Nevertheless, it’s useful to have some concept at least in mind to refer to. Classics of course don’t just appear from nowhere, and usually tend to bear some debt, despite often breaking away from, their predecessors. Star Wars is no exception.\n\nNow, the origins of sci-fi whether in terms of literature or film are contested, such is the way with emergent genres. As George Slusser details in his essay concerning Science Fiction literature, ‘The Origins of Science Fiction’, the term Science Fiction emerged for a genre which was already beginning to exist but was as yet not allotted a particular term:\n\nHugo Gernsback, in the inaugural issues of Amazing Stories (1926), let readers give a name to the stories they were reading – Verne, Wells, and Poe primarily. The name they came up with was “scientifiction”\n\nWhat a great term, and one I wish we could bring back. But alas, it was Science Fiction that took off. But what exactly is science fiction and where does this term fit in terms of films? As Krzywinska and King point out, using Rick Altman’s theory, in their study Science Fiction Cinema: From Outerspace to Cyberspace (2000) a genre may either be defined semantically or syntactically. That is to say the elements which make up sci-fi so that we can recognise it as a genre, such as space, setting etc. and then taking that a step further and analysing the purpose of these elements. Leading to the argument that Star Wars is in fact a Western – but key elements have been altered i.e. the horse becomes a spacecraft and so on. But really, as with anything genres are fluid and there are many films which are of no particular genre but are merely hybrids of many genres. But King and Krzywinska suggest that it is just this genre hallmark, that is to say its fluidity, which has ensured its longevity.\n\nIt is precisely Science Fiction’s diversity and flexibility, through its ability to absorb ideas from other domains, that has kept the genre alive for more than a century\n\nI’ll be taking a look later this week a bit more at the big bang beginnings of Science Fiction, particularly Science Fiction cinema, but now I’d like to turn briefly to a couple of films which are seen by many to mark the beginning of Science Fiction films: George Méliès’s Le Voyage Dans la Lun (A Trip to the Moon) (1902) and Fritz Lang’s Metropolis (1927). They’re both silent and in black and white. Méliès’s film clocks in at just over twelve minutes, which, in the light of the recent Lord of the Rings/Hobbit films trend for maximum length, would barely classify as a film in todays terms. Méliès’s was a magician turned filmmaker and boy can you tell watching A Trip to the Moon. There’s a Dumbledore-esque professor figure, a collection of wizard looking types, complete with star adorned cloaks and pointy hats, and even a canon propelled mission to the moon. You can have a look for yourself here, amusing though it was to watch it seemed a far cry from the sci-fi we’re perhaps more used to in the modern world. That said the desire to explore new grounds (“To boldly go where no man has gone before..”), to investigate life forms, and to bring them back (as occurs in A Trip to the Moon) certainly crop up in one form or another in Sci-fi films today. Though our knowledge of science has certainly had an impact on our representation of it on screen, for instance I was surprised to see that no space suits are worn in this film.\n\nMy favourite moment of the film was the landing, as they hit The Man on the Moon’s eye. Star Wars, you’ve got a lot to live up to!\n\nWatching Fritz Lang’s Metropolis on the other hand I felt the fear which had been missing from the almost slap-stick comedy of A Trip to the Moon – not that fear is integral to Science Fiction, but I think the powerful pieces tend to unite moments that induce fear with comic interludes, although Metropolis majored on the fear, with surprisingly little comedy. Perhaps it is because of how close to modern life aspects of it were that it induces fear in the modern audience member, fear that perhaps was different for viewers in the late 1920s. Now, whether or not I’m a scaredy-cat is besides the point what I particularly enjoyed about Metropolis (besides the storyline and cinematic experience – if you haven’t seen it do, it’s excellent) was noticing elements that have clearly had a huge impact on modern cinema, like the creation of Maria’s Maschinenmensch by Rotwang (who incidentally was like a more vindictive Back to the Future Doc) which gave us Robocop, Terminator, and maybe even to some extent Ironman and Blade Runner is of course hugely indebted to Lang.\n\nBut the influence extends beyond Sci-Fi and the Batman movies also have a touch or two of Metropolis and Lang’s vision about them. Because it is a silent film a large amount of the tension and emotion integral to the plot is displayed not only in body language but also in the powerful and emotive soundtrack. I’m talking about the original soundtrack, for there have since be several alternatives released.\n\nBut what struck me most of all was the modernity of the film. It was powerful because it seemed so contemporary in its painting of characters, its thematic concerns, particularly it’s consideration of identity and what make’s us human as captured in the visions of eyes which haunt Freder.\n\nWhile there were certainly elements that dated it, not least in terms of special effects (which were phenomenal for its time but in the post Avatar world seem more artistic less filmic) and mass biblical allegories (though that’s not to say they don’t appear in films today), it was a powerful piece of film and it captured the essence of what, to me, is great about Science Fiction cinema. Lang has set the bar high, bring on May the fourth."
