        "text": "Prepare for lift off, courtesy of a soon-to-be-released romantic comedy starring the dream team of Channing Tatum and Scarlett Johansson, set against the space race of the 1960s.\n\nAcquired by Apple in a $100 million deal following a bidding war in 2022, Fly Me To The Moon is described by the network as a \"stylish comedy-drama set against the high-stakes backdrop of NASA’s historic Apollo 11 moon landing. Sparks fly in all directions as marketing maven Kelly Jones (Johansson), brought in to fix NASA’s public image, wreaks havoc on launch director Cole Davis’ (Tatum) already difficult task. When the White House deems the mission too important to fail, Jones is directed to stage a fake moon landing as backup, and the countdown truly begins.\"\n\nFull of historical drama, 1960s costumes (if Palm Royale hasn't proved enough to satiate your appetite for vintage looks) and an A-list cast, Fly Me To The Moon is set to be one of this summer's most popular films. Here's what we know about it so far...\n\nWhat is Fly Me To The Moon about?\n\nThe film tells the story of marketing genius Kelly, as her world collides with that of Cole Davis, a NASA employee who has been given the difficult task of keeping America's mission to put a man on the moon afloat. With public support for the programme at a low, Kelly is brought in to help \"sell the moon\", a venture Cole thinks is pointless. As the two prepare to undertake a monumental task – filming a back-up to the moon landing in case the real mission fails – they find that they may just have more in common than they first thought.\n\nIs it based on a true story?\n\nThe movie definitely has all the hallmarks of a 'true story' dramatisation – but is it? That rather depends on which version of history you choose to believe. Some still think the moon landings were falsified and, though the film is loosely based on real life events, it takes plenty of creative liberties.\n\nWho is starring in Fly Me To The Moon?\n\nAcademy Award nominee Scarlett Johansson, who has been attached to the project from the beginning, is taking on the leading role of Kelly Jones, opposite Channing Tatum as Cole Davis. They'll be joined by other Hollywood heavyweights such as Woody Harrelson (as NASA top-dog Moe Berkus), Ray Romano and Jim Rash, to name a few.\n\nIs there a trailer?\n\nYes! And it gives a great flavour of the film. The trailer starts with Kelly and Cole meeting by chance in a diner – before launching into the troubles of the space mission. \"Every day, something is breaking,\" sighs Cole. \"NASA needs a marketing specialist and you are the very best,\" Berkus tells Kelly, bringing her on board to help with the programme. She takes on the job with enthusiasm, placing adverts and fixing TV slots, and saying at one point: \"When I'm done, these men are going to be bigger than The Beatles.\"\n\nThe trailer takes a darker turn when Berkus explains, \"the whole world will be watching – we can't afford to lose to the Russians. We need to shoot the back-up version of the moon landing.\" Can Kelly and Cole work out their differences, and make the mission a success – one way or another?\n\nWhen will Fly Me To The Moon be released, and how can I watch it?\n\nThe film is scheduled for a 12 July release date. Because Fly Me To The Moon is a co-production between Sony Pictures and Apple Studios, the film will be available on Apple TV+ after it leaves theatres – so if you don't manage to catch it in the cinema, you can watch it at home."
