        "text": "Films about great comics have a similar problem to films about (fictional) painters. You can show the painter being brilliant and drunk in a cafe, or brilliant and angry with agent or gallery-owner, or brilliant and inspired in his at√®lier. But sooner or later the camera has to peep, however cursorily, at what is actually on the canvas, and risk all that assumed brilliance looking a bit thin. The problem arises with the short and troubled life of Andy Kaufman, the subject of Man On The Moon. A volatile stand-up-comedian-cum-situationist-hoaxer, Kaufman is now remembered here, if at all, for his squeaky-voiced Latka in the early 80s TV show Taxi.\n\nBut he was also a cult figure in the US for his anarchic performances on Saturday Night Live, Letterman, Johnny Carson and playing live on the lucrative college circuit or in Vegas as his alter ego, the appalling lounge singer Tony Clifton. Jim Carrey, in a solemn and conspicuous act of ancestor worship, plays Kaufman, and Milos Forman directs: a return to his familiar themes of madness and creative inspiration. But we never get much more than a few seconds' continuous showing of Kaufman's act, his \"comedy canvas\", and maybe that is as it should be.\n\nThe film does an efficient sleight-of-hand job of suggesting comic genius: Kaufman dying on stage at the Improv club; cut to shot of audience looking baffled and irritated; cut to shot of Kaufman ploughing on; cut to audience smiling, shrugging, starting to laugh. And afterwards,Kaufman's agent George Shapiro (Danny DeVito) chuckles prescriptively: \"You're insane! But you might also be brilliant!\" QED.\n\nMan On The Moon cannot risk attempting to be funny on its own account; it has to establish a complementary tone of respectful, bittersweet drama as a showcase for the implied comic genius. And considering how profoundly conservative American network television was and is, it is remarkable how far Kaufman was allowed to go: mad stunts on air, attacking and humiliating the audience, \"a single-minded pursuit of anarchy\" from which he appears never to have been spiritually seduced by a parallel career in a top-rated middle-of-the-road network TV show. (Judd Hirsch and most of the original cast of Taxi appear in the film, unsmilingly enduring once again the trial of looking like pedestrian schmucks compared to Kaufman's mercurial talent, but not DeVito, who has interestingly promoted himself out of the Taxi cast to play someone in on the gag.) But this wild and crazy guy died from lung cancer at the age of 35, a career move which took him into the realm of legend and away from playing, say, the silver-haired lead in Father of the Bride 2.\n\nWhat could and should have been interesting about Andy Kaufman's life is how he reacted to failure: he had hardly reached the top when public and fellow artists alike wearied of being his straight man, and turned against him. He was getting a bad press and was voted off Saturday Night Live in a viewers' phone poll that Kaufman clearly believed he would win: a rare stunt of which he was not in control.\n\nBut Carrey plays Kaufman the same throughout, in good times and bad, with no growth and no progression, with the same blinking, moon-faced detachment, a sort of halfway-house between Kaufman's weird, deadpan live act and an assumed professional backstage reserve. One of the most incredible things about Kaufman is his self-appointed position as World Inter-Gender Wrestling Champion, challenging women, quite genuinely, to wrestle him.\n\nAt the time, this was considered the nadir of jarring unfunniness: the very quintessence of being on the comedic skids. But now, in its magnificent lack of taste, it looks like an inspired take on the sex wars: with Kaufman as a cross between Norman Mailer and Bobby Riggs. It is a pity that Forman didn't expand this gloriously offensive part of Kaufman's career. And it only hints at the final irony: when Kaufman had to tell his family he was dying of cancer, his furious sister contemptuously suspected him of staging the ultimate, bad-taste stunt. In real life, Kaufman claimed to have met Elvis Presley by smuggling himself into the kitchen of the Las Vegas Hilton. This meeting is not dramatised on screen: perhaps because that might overload the Troubled Genius quotient.\n\nBut in his final scene, Forman hints at an Elvis-style resurrection for Andy, suggesting that he might actually have faked his death after all. Well, let's assume Andy Kaufman is up in Valhalla with John Belushi, while Robin Williams, Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy labour in the world of mediocrity below, what is the point of Kaufman's career?\n\nThe family is shown to be upset at what they suspect is Andy's Ultimate Cancer Put-On, but the next thing we know they have come to terms with it, and uncomplicatedly embrace Andy's career in its tragic final act: a tear-jerking final concert in Carnegie Hall: a very tame ending for his comedy guerrilla, like Che Guevera joining the Liberal Democrats. Milos Forman opts for a very easy, cloying sentimentality to close his film about a difficult, bloody-minded comedian."
