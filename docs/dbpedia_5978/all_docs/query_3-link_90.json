        "text": "Portions of this were published previously in the March 3, 2019, article “Want More After ‘Apollo 11’? Here Are 5 Space Documentaries to Stream.”\n\nFifty years ago, on July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to set foot on the moon. Their mission, Apollo 11, was the culmination of over a decade of space exploration by the United States and the Soviet Union: a “space race” that captivated the world, introducing laypeople to concepts in advanced rocketry and astrophysics while producing images and moments that still awe.\n\nIn the decades since, filmmakers have revisited the heyday of space travel in documentaries and dramatizations, trying to put these remarkable achievements into their proper human context. In honor of the Apollo 11 anniversary — an event depicted recently in the feature film “First Man” and the documentary “Apollo 11” — here are 11 of the best movies about real-life space exploration, all available to stream.\n\nHow to watch: Buy or rent it on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube.\n\nTom Wolfe’s lively 1979 nonfiction best seller, “The Right Stuff,” about NASA’s “Mercury Seven” — America’s first astronauts — is at once mythopoetic and lightly satirical. The writer-director Philip Kaufman adapted the book into an equally energetic and sly movie, with an outstanding cast that includes Ed Harris as John Glenn, Fred Ward as Gus Grissom, Scott Glenn as Alan Shepard and Sam Shepard as the pioneering test pilot Chuck Yeager. “The Right Stuff” captures the boys’ club quality of early outer-space exploration and shows how these cocky adventurers fought to retain their dignity and humanity amid the red tape and media frenzy.\n\n[Read the New York Times review.]\n\n‘For All Mankind’ (1989)"
