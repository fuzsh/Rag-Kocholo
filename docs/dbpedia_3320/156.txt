American actress Kim Hunter(1922-2002) had her breakthrough in the cinema with the classic British film A Matter of Life and Death (1946). In 1952 she won an Oscar for her part as Stella in A Streetcar Named Desire (1951). In the McCarthy era, she was blacklisted as being a Communist sympathizer, but in the 1960s she was cleared of the unjust accusations.

José Ferrer (1912- 1992) was an American actor and film director, who was born in Puerto Rico. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his title role in Cyrano de Bergerac (1951). Ferrer was frequently used as a villain in his later film career.
