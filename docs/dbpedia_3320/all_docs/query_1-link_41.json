She was 79.\n\nHunter died in her Greenwich Village apartment from an apparent\n\nheart attack, said her daughter, Kathryn Emmett.\n\nA shy, modest person, Hunter enjoyed a long and busy career in\n\ntheater and television, less so in films, partly because she was\n\nblacklisted during the red-hunting 1950s and didn't fit the sexpot\n\npattern for female Hollywood stars.\n\n``A Streetcar Named Desire'' provided the highlight of her\n\ncareer. The play was cast with Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski,\n\nKarl Malden as Mitch, and Jessica Tandy as the tragic Blanche\n\nDuBois. Director Elia Kazan admitted in his autobiography, ``A\n\nLife,'' that he had trouble casting Stella ``because I enjoy\n\nlooking at girls.''\n\nHe added of Hunter: ``The minute I saw her I was attracted to\n\nher, which is the best possible reaction when casting young\n\nwomen.''\n\nBrando, Malden and Hunter played their roles in the somewhat\n\nsanitized film version (Hollywood still adhered to a strict moral\n\nself-censorship). Because Warner Bros. need a movie star for\n\nmarquee value, Vivien Leigh, who had appeared as Blanche in London,\n\nrepeated the role in the film.\n\nLeigh, Malden and Hunter won Academy Awards; despite his\n\nunforgettable performance, Brando did not. Humphrey Bogart was\n\nawarded a long overdue Oscar for ``The African Queen.''\n\nHunter told the New Orleans Times-Picayune in 1999 that after\n\nshe left ``Streetcar'' she tried to avoid seeing the play with\n\nother casts.\n\n``It's simply that I have no objectivity about it,'' she said.\n\n``It was so much a part of my life, it would be unfair to the\n\nproductions and performers.''\n\nOscar's legendary golden touch didn't seem to apply to Hunter.\n\nHer subsequent films were few, and they lacked the luster of\n\n``Streetcar.'' Among them: ``Deadline U.S.A.,'' as newspaper editor\n\nHumphrey Bogart's estranged wife; ``Anything Can Happen,'' as\n\nRussian immigrant Jose Ferrer's wife; ``Storm Center,'' a minor\n\nfilm starring Bette Davis; also ``The Young Stranger,'' ``Bermuda\n\nAffair,'' and ``Money, Women and Guns.''\n\nHer screen career entered a lull in the late '50s, after Hunter,\n\na liberal Democrat, was listed as a communist sympathizer by Red\n\nChannels, a red-hunting pamphlet that influenced hiring by studios\n\nand TV networks.\n\nHer return to film was ``Lilith'' (1964), which starred Warren\n\nBeatty, Jean Seberg and Peter Fonda. Four years later came ``Planet\n\nof the Apes.''\n\nHunter was cast as Dr. Zira, a chimpanzee psychiatrist in the\n\nscience fiction classic about a group of astronauts from a ruined\n\nearth who discover a future world ruled by apes, with humans as\n\nslaves. The actress spent hours as the makeup and monkey suit were\n\napplied and later removed.\n\n``It was pretty claustrophobic and painful to a certain\n\nextent,'' she told a reporter in 1998. ``The only thing of me that\n\ncame through was my eyeballs.''\n\nShe was enough intrigued with the character and the plots that\n\nshe appeared in two sequels, ``Beneath the Planet of the Apes''\n\n(1970) and ``Escape from the Planet of the Apes'' (1971).\n\nHunter was born Janet Cole in Detroit on Nov. 12, 1922; her\n\nmother had been a concert pianist. She recalled later that she was\n\na lonely child who ``picked friends out of books and played `let's\n\npretend' games, acting out their characters before a mirror.''\n\nAt 17 she joined a traveling stock company, then gained more\n\nseasoning in regional theaters and went to California for a role in\n\n``Arsenic and Old Lace'' at the Pasadena Playhouse.\n\nShe obtained a contract with David O. Selznick, whose first move\n\nwas to change her name. She made her film debut in a low-budget RKO\n\nhorror film, ``The Seventh Victim,'' and followed with secondary\n\nroles in other features, but eventually returned to the New York\n\ntheater.\n\nIrene Mayer Selznick was producing ``A Streetcar Named Desire''\n\nin 1947, and Selznick, her ex-husband, recommended Hunter to play\n\nStella Kowalski.\n\nAfter the ``Planet of the Apes'' movies, Hunter appeared on\n\nBroadway in ``Darkness at Noon,'' ``The Children's Hour'' and ``The\n\nTender Trap'' and toured extensively in regional theater.\n\nHer television appearances included the soap operas ``The Edge\n\nof Night'' and ``As the World Turns'' plus numerous miniseries, TV\n\nmovies and series.\n\nHunter was married to William Baldwin in 1944; they had a\n\ndaughter, Kathryn, and divorced in 1946. In 1951, she married actor\n\nand producer Robert Emett, with whom she sometimes costarred in\n\nplays. Their son was named Sean Robert.\n\nAssociated Press Writer Bob Thomas in Los Angeles contributed to\n\nthis report."
