        "text": "If you could cut to the core of Xavier's struggles during last season's 16-18 campaign, it was health.\n\nXavier was left behind the eight-ball last summer, long before the season filled with expectations after a Sweet 16 run tipped off with season-ending injuries to a pair of starters.\n\nWith another roster restructuring out of the way, Xavier concluded summer workouts last week on the healthier side, though they have two valuable members on the mend.\n\nJerome Hunter, who is recovering from a torn Achilles tendon, was cleared for non-contact activities in July. When the team comes back to campus later this month, Hunter should be nearing a full return to the Musketeers.\n\n\"I believe really at the beginning of September he'll be cleared and ready to go,\" Xavier head coach Sean Miller told The Enquirer. \"Jerome has progressed and has done a great job. He has to have one more really great month to really solidify it.\"\n\nIn July, Miller told Jon Rothstein on the College Hoops Today podcast that Hunter, when cleared, would have \"a good runway of a couple months to get ready, play 5-on-5 and get back where we're optimistic he can be ready for our season-opener (Nov. 4 vs. Texas Southern).\"\n\nA key cog in Xavier's tournament run in 2023, the 24-year-old forward has averaged 6 points and 3.7 rebounds per game over two seasons with the Musketeers.\n\nXavier struggled with inconsistency in the frontcourt last season and a cure to that ailment looks to be the return of Hunter and Zach Freemantle, who is healthy after foot surgery and is coming off a nice summer session. Xavier added depth at frontcourt with the addition of two forwards and a center.\n\nOne of those additions, Florida State transfer Cam'Ron Fletcher, is recovering from knee surgery. Fletcher suited up for just 17 games with the Seminoles over the last two seasons due to injuries in the same knee. He had surgery in February and was a limited participant in summer workouts.\n\nXavier is practicing patience with the former four-star forward.\n\n\"One of the promises that we made Cam and his family was just making sure that coming off two injuries and surgeries that it's one thing to be cleared, but we're going to go to the extreme level that he's strong and has the most support that we can,\" Miller said. \"We really are patient. He's made great progress.\"\n\nMiller gave a hopeful timetable for Fletcher's return.\n\n\"I look at more of October/November where he'll be cleared and be like everyone else. That's probably optimistic,\" Miller said. \"In terms of functionally, he looks the part. He's more and more confident every day, he's worked hard in the weight room and his strength is maybe ahead of where we wanted it to be. We're gonna air on the side of caution so that his best days are ahead of him, even beyond this year.\""
