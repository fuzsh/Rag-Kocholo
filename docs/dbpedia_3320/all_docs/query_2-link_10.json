        "text": "The comical and wistful adventures of a Russian immigrant in getting acquainted with America and winning for himself an American wife are played with a curious passivity by the talented José Ferrer in \"Anything Can Happen,\" which came to the Mayfair yesterday. But Mr. Ferrer's performance, directed by George Seaton, is only one of several disconcerting aspects of this rambling and sentimental film.In the first place, the casual projection of the twenty-year-old memories of George and Helen Papashvily into the present day presents certain obvious contradictions the logical mind finds hard to take. The Papashvilys, in writing their memoirs, upon which this picture is based, were reflecting on times and conditions much different from those of today, so that their tale of a youthful South Georgian emigrating to these shores was reasonable. The prospect of such a young fellow arriving today is nigh absurd.Likewise, the parallel assumption, which Mr. Seaton and George Oppenheimer have made in writing the script for this picture, that a strong and gregarious colony of South Georgians is currently thriving and being chauvinistic in this land is beyond the range of acceptance of all but the lovers of romance. Thus the cozy picture Mr. Seaton presents of a band of genial eccentrics singing songs and having feasts in old-country style, as of the present, is in the realm of pure myth.Myth—or idealism—accounts for much else in this film, as for instance the cozy reminiscence of the time that the hero goes to court and insists upon pleading \"not guilty\" rather than avoid complications by paying a fine or the time that he frightens the riders on a Madison Avenue bus with a package of dough. (The dough starts rising when it gets warm and the riders think it is an atomic bomb.)Mr. Seaton has borrowed and invented a series of episodes that are quaintly sentimental and romantic but they have the strong flavor of myth. Furthermore, they are strung together in such a loose and suspenseless way and are played with such calculated cuteness that the monotony of of them palls.The diffident and almost weary manner in which Mr. Ferrer plays the role of the immigrant hero—his gentle piety—is in marked contrast to the wild ebullience and ostentation of other characters. Kurt Kasznar, as an immigrant from Turkey; Eugenie Leontovich, as a Russian emigre, and Oscar Beregi, Mikhail Rasumny and Nick Dennis, as old South Georgians, are all lots of fun but they give the odd impression of being fugitives from a Second Avenue cafe. And Kim Hunter, as the young lady whom the hero discovers, woos and weds, is sweet and ornamental but disturbingly unreal.It looks as though Mr. Seaton, in making this Paramount film, has let himself be distracted by wishful thinking and an undramatic book.\n\nANYTHING CAN HAPPEN, screen play by George Seaton and George Oppenhelmer, based on the book by George and Helen Papashvily; directed by Mr. Seaton; produced by William Perlberg for Paramount Pictures.
