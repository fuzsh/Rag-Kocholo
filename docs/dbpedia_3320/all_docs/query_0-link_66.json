Rae was on The Facts of Life for the first seven seasons and a special two-part season 8 episode. She was nominated for a Primetime Emmy award for her role.\n\nRae died on Aug. 5, 2018, at the age of 92.\n\n02 of 09\n\nKim Fields (Tootie Ramsey)\n\nKim Fields played the lovable Tootie on The Facts of Life, the youngest student at Eastland Academy. Fields already had other acting credits to her name by the time she booked the sitcom, including playing Janet Jackson's best friend Kim on Good Times and having already played Tootie (Arnold Jackson's girlfriend) on Diff'rent Strokes.\n\nHer mom, Chip Fields, played her onscreen mother on The Facts of Life.\n\nContinuing in show business after the series ended, Fields is an actress and producer who starred on many popular shows of the time, including Mork & Mindy, 227, Martin, and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. She's best known for starring on another hit show featuring an all-female cast: Living Single.
