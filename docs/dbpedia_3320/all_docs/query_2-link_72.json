Bodily Harm is the sad tale of a young woman’s desperate fight for survival and the price she is ultimately forced to pay.\n\nSINS OF THE FATHER\n\n​\n\nHaving the sad misfortune of not only being forced to live on Brick Lane but also being the eldest illegitimate child of Shamus O’Mara, a violent Irish drunk, Grace Wilson’s mere existence was simply beyond comprehension. Never expecting more than she'd been dealt, Grace's young life was totally devoid of love, kindness or any of the niceties that life seemed to bestow upon others. Her sole role was to merely raise her two younger brothers in the best possible way that she could, however, she could. Money was tight, actually more than tight it was almost non-existent but for most of the time, she somehow\n\nmanaged to feed her siblings, even if that food was often scavenged from the numerous dustbins located at the rear of the small stores and Indian restaurants that were dotted along Brick Lane. With her sixteenth birthday fast approaching Grace had one wish, to simply spend an evening, just one, with\n\nher only friend Linda and for once not have to think about her sad life or worry about what her two little brothers were getting up to. The Carpenters Arms held a teenage disco in the upstairs room on Friday nights and the two friends had made a date to celebrate Grace’s birthday but the outing would take more than\n\na little planning if she was to escape the flat without Shamus finding out. Somehow the plans miraculously all came together but the night, didn’t turn out at all as planned, it was actually a complete and utter fiasco but it was also the night that she would meet East End heavy Big Jimmy Kilham and her life would change forever!\n\nGREED!\n\n​\n\nAlong with her mother Bonnie, little Maggie McKay migrated from Glasgow to London in the summer of 1972. It was a very reluctant move by her mother but she was forced to join Maggie’s father after borrowing more money from friends and family than she could ever realistically pay back. Brice McKay had been in the city for just over\n\na year after being made redundant in his native Glasgow. It hadn’t taken him long to gain employment with the Pimms crime firm who worked out of an old railway arch on Pinchin Street in Whitechapel. Brice wasn’t a natural fighter, yes he was more than able to take\n\ncare of himself but the one thing that put him aside from the rest was his business aptitude and that ability saw him rapidly rise through the ranks to become Harry Pimms’ second in command and natural successor. From the tender age of just five years old Maggie had spent time at the arches and had become accustomed to the hard-nosed gangsters that always had a willing smile and a bag of sweets for the boss’s little girl. The years passed swiftly by and with her father’s decline in health, she was almost running the firm and would indeed take over completely by her early thirties. Maggie was a hard boss, violence didn’t bother her in the least as long as she wasn’t on the receiving end and she had the same business aptitude as her father but that was where any similarity ended. Brice had made a good living for himself and his men but had continued in the usual illegal trades of prostitution, pornography, loan sharking and robberies. He had been happy with the money the firm brought in but when his daughter took charge, things began to change, greed was an understatement as far as Maggie was concerned and there wasn’t anything she wouldn’t undertake to see her coffers swell even further. When she began to trade in the unthinkable it caused people in the capital to live in constant fear and the Metropolitan Police to launch a task force to solve these horrendous crimes. How long would it take? Could Maggie get away with the truly unthinkable or would she be brought to justice? ‘Greed’ is the harrowing account of one evil woman’s hideous slide into complete and utter depravation and murder.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nEYE FOR AN EYE\n\n​\n\nTwo highly successful underworld bosses who both live by moral codes but unlike the majority of society, those morals and principles are not for right or fairness but for their own immoral greed. You could presume to tar them both with the same brush but that would be wrong. Their greed for money is where any similarity between them ends!\n\nDel Foster is a true East End gangster running his business out of a small terraced house in Bow East London. Styling himself on Ronnie Kray, Del loves money and all the trappings that a villainous lifestyle provides but more than anything he loves his wife and three grown children. Life is profitable and moving along nicely until he decides that it’s time for his only son Kenan and very much against his wife’s wishes, to join the family firm.\n\nEli Carter runs his firm out of a pub in Romford Essex. He’s a former Romany traveller and is as brutal as any man alive. His two sons Morris and Marcus also work for him but his eldest has dreams of taking over and expanding into the city. The only thing stopping Morris Carter is the fact that he has to wait for his father to die.\n\nTwo notorious underworld gangsters, whose paths only cross because a horrendous and fatal act is carried out on an offspring of one of the men. Who will win in this tale of war and revenge? A story that will shock the underworld, where in their line of work vengeance is key to their credibility but most of all to their survival!\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nCRIME DOESN'T PAY"
