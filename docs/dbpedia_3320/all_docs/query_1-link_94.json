        "text": "Where are the 2 movies hosted: on a local drive attached to a Mac or PC or \"in the cloud\"?\n\nFirst guess is the latter and- once again- the Studios who actually control the movies have released a newly packaged version and yanked the former version from the store. If this is an iTunes purchased movie, you might be able to go into \"purchased\" and locate a new version. If so, delete the old version listing from your library and add the Purchased duplicate to your library.\n\nAnd if this fixes it, let this be a lesson again, that \"trusting the cloud\" is trusting others- complete strangers- to take care of your media. As little as ONE big HDD can be had for a few hundred dollars and hold many hundreds of movies. Download media stored in the cloud to such a drive and then YOU control it instead of the strangers/studios.\n\nA worse case is one of many instances where media just gets yanked entirely from the store and you don't have access to any kind of replacement. This is the ultimate reason to download your media and control it yourself. Just checked: 20TB HDDs on Amazon right now are only about $200. If average size of iTunes movie is 6GB, that's about 333 movies stored on a local \"cloud\" you 100% control... and studios can't touch.\n\nDownload what you buy and you control it. If we go to the grocery store, we don't buy the food and then leave it there. If we go to the shoe store, we don't buy the shoes and leave them there. If we go to the restaurant, we don't buy the food but leave it there. Why do we do this with media we buy? Strangers in complete control of things we buy is only asking for trouble from time to time. Possess it and you control it.\n\nIMO: the cloud is great for short-term temporary sharing of files with other computers you own or other people... like sharing a hard drive in a wired network. Much beyond that use though and we're simply asking for trouble trusting for profit strangers. We do that with banks holding our money but there are many layers of protection against banks misbehaving (and still stuff happens). There's no FDIC-type entity for digital media: Federal Data Insurance Corporation? Federal Digital Media Insurance Corporation? At least the actual FDIC is further backed by the U.S. GOV, motivated against letting it fail by the broad swath of financial disasters that would follow, affecting re-elections of politicians who let it fail.\n\nTrust the cloud and you are on your own if anything happens. Be your own cloud and you can demand your data caretaker (you) takes all measures to preserve and care for your media.\n\nIn the meantime, try my suggestion and that will hopefully get your two movies back again. However, don't assume that works every time. See countless threads of truly LOST media with no way to get it back again without buying it again. And hint: when THAT happens, the Apple crowd blames the person with the problem or the Studios, never Apple.\n\nAnd note: since these are only last week purchases, I'm 100% confident Apple will help you if you need help. Odds are it's not a Studio action but just something else. If you can't resolve it, contact Apple and they should fix a purchase made only last week."
