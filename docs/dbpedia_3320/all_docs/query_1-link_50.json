        "text": "(WASHINGTON) — Vice President Kamala Harris secured enough Democratic Party delegate votes to become the party’s nominee, according to the Democratic National Committee. She announced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate on Tuesday, with the two scheduled to embark on a seven-state trip to some of the biggest battleground states in the election, according to her campaign.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his vice presidential pick, Sen. JD Vance, are set to speak to voters through scheduled rallies and events throughout the week, too. Vance will also be visiting the same battleground states as Harris and her newly minted vice presidential pick.\n\nHere’s how the news is developing:\n\nHarris, Trump tied among Wisconsin voters, poll finds\n\nA poll from Marquette University Law School published Wednesday of voters in Wisconsin found that Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are closely matched among registered voters in a 2024 general election head-to-head matchup.\n\nAmong registered voters, Trump and Harris were split 50% to 49%, respectively, and among likely voters, they were split 49% to 50%, according to the poll.\n\nThe poll shows virtually no change from the split between President Joe Biden and Trump in a Marquette poll that was conducted in June.\n\nWhen a few third-party candidates are added in, Harris and Trump are still about even among registered voters, with Harris netting 45%, Trump netting 43% and independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. getting 8%, the poll found.\n\nThe survey was conducted between July 24 to Aug. 1. It has a margin of error of +/- 4.6 percentage points among registered Wisconsin voters and +/- 4.8 percentage points among likely Wisconsin voters.\n\n-ABC News’ Oren Oppenheim\n\nWalz greeted with ‘Let’s go coach’ chants as he visits campaign HQ\n\nGov. Tim Walz visited the campaign’s Wilmington headquarters Wednesday morning to a cheering crowd.\n\n“I wanted to say thank you myself to the people who have put everything into helping us win. Holy smokes, this team,” he said in a post on X.\n\nSeveral volunteers and staffers were outside holding signs and shook the governor’s hand as he greeted them, according to a video of the visit on his X account.\n\nThe crowd engaged in a chant of “Let’s go coach,” referencing Walz’s time as a high school football coach.\n\n“It’s Friday night lights,” Walz responded.\n\n-ABC News’ Will McDuffie, Gabriella Abdul-Hakim Isabella Murray and Fritz Farrow\n\nHarris-Walz campaign boasts ‘explosion of volunteer interest’\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign issued a memo on Wednesday touting its ground game in battleground states, specifically Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe memo boasted of a “formidable door-knocking operation” in Wisconsin with more than 160 full-time coordinated staffers on the ground, an “explosion of volunteer interest” in Michigan, with more than 9,000 new volunteer sign-ups, and “unprecedented enthusiasm” in Pennsylvania, citing Tuesday’s rally in Philadelphia that the campaign claims brought in more than 14,000 people.\n\nThe campaign said it has more than 600 coordinated staff members on the ground in those three states and plans to add 150 more in the first two weeks of August.\n\n-ABC News’ Will McDuffie, Gabriella Abdul-Hakim and Fritz Farrow\n\nHarris-Walz campaign says it raised $36M in 24 hours since VP announcement\n\nIn the first 24 hours since Vice President Kamala Harris announced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, the Harris-Walz campaign has raised $36 million, according to a campaign official.\n\n-ABC News’ Gabriella Abdul-Hakim\n\n22 Democratic governors, including Shapiro and Beshear, praise Harris’ selection of Walz as VP\n\nTwenty-two Democratic governors are lauding the fact that their colleague, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, has joined the 2024 Democratic ticket.\n\nIn a statement released on Wednesday, they stressed as a group of leaders — which includes some they said were “elected in very challenging races in battleground and red states” — that they were “thrilled” with Harris’ selection.\n\nThe joint statement was notably signed by Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who themselves were on the shortlist of potential Harris vice presidential picks. All three had submitted materials to the Democratic nominee’s vetting team, though only Shapiro had traveled to Washington, D.C., on Sunday for an in-person interview with Harris.\n\n“As America’s Democratic governors, we represent a broad and diverse set of 23 states that make up more than half the U.S. population. Many of us were elected in very challenging races in battleground and red states. We make tough decisions as state executives every day, and know what it takes to win. We couldn’t be more thrilled that Vice President Kamala Harris has selected Governor Tim Walz as her running mate, and will do everything in our power to ensure their success this November,” the statement, first shared with ABC News, reads.\n\n“Overall, there’s no doubt the Harris-Walz ticket is the perfect one-two punch to knock out the GOP’s dangerous agenda and failure to deliver for the American people,” the statement continues.\n\nOther governors who signed on to the letter include California’s Gavin Newsom, Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer, Colorado’s Jared Polis, Maryland’s Wes Moore and North Carolina’s Roy Cooper.\n\nVance targets Harris’ ‘policy choices’ during Michigan stop\n\nGOP vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance delivered remarks following a briefing with the Shelby Township, Michigan, Police Department on Wednesday, where he went after Vice President Kamala Harris on her “policy choices.”\n\nVance’s remarks at the event focused on supporting law enforcement and combating undocumented immigration.\n\n“We’ve got to throw Kamala Harris out of office, not give her a promotion, and that’s what our law enforcement needs,” he said.\n\nWhen asked by reporters about how a Trump administration would actually deport undocumented immigrants (Trump has repeatedly vowed to deport millions of migrants), Vance gave no real plan on how that would happen but stated: “We are going to deport people now.”\n\nVance also took aim at his Democratic VP opponent, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a retired National Guardsman, questioning his military service while providing no facts to back up his claim. Vance also called out Walz for his comment during Tuesday’s rally in Philadelphia, where the governor called out the senator’s Ivy League education and support from tech billionaires.\n\n“And if he wants to criticize me for getting an Ivy League education, I’m proud of the fact that my mama supported me, that I was able to make something of myself,” Vance said.\n\nVance was again asked his thoughts about Trump falsely questioning Harris’ racial identity. Vance said he viewed Trump’s attack on the vice president as her being “a chameleon.”\n\n“I think he was observing the basic foundational reality that Kamala Harris pretends to be something different depending on which audience she’s speaking to,” the senator said.\n\n-ABC News’ Hannah Demissie\n\nTrump says he ‘could not be more thrilled’ about Walz as Harris’ VP pick\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he “couldn’t believe” Vice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, adding he “could not be more thrilled,” when he called into Fox and Friends Wednesday morning.\n\n“I would say my reaction is, I can’t believe it. I never thought this was going to be the one that was picked,” Trump said. “He’s a very, very liberal man, and he’s a shocking pick, and I’m thrilled. I could not be more thrilled.”\n\nAsked if his campaign thought Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro was going to be the VP pick, Trump said he thought Shapiro would’ve been a better choice.\n\n“I would have said it would have been a better choice,” Trump said of Shapiro. “I would have said others were the better, better choice.”\n\nHarris and Walz to hold rallies in Wisconsin, Michigan Wednesday\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are scheduled Wednesday to hold rallies in Wisconsin and Michigan, bringing their “vision for the future” to two battleground states on their first full day of campaigning together.\n\n“Together, they will highlight the choice facing Blue Wall voters between the Trump-Vance agenda to weaken unions and give tax cuts to the wealthy on the backs of the middle class, and the Harris-Walz vision for the future, where everyone has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead,” the Harris campaign said.\n\nAt their midday stop in Wisconsin, the pair will be joined by Gov. Tony Evers and Sen. Tammy Baldwin.\n\nThe pair will then travel to Wayne County Airport in Michigan for an evening rally, the campaign said. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan will join them, the campaign said.\n\n“Their visits come on the heels of over a dozen labor endorsements, including last week’s endorsement from UAW — which represents more than 130,000 members in Michigan alone,” the campaign said.\n\nJD Vance cancels North Carolina rallies due to Tropical Storm Debby\n\nSen. JD Vance will not be making appearances in North Carolina Thursday, due to the forecast of Tropical Storm Debby in the state, the Trump-Vance campaign said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nVance had two scheduled rallies in Raleigh and Oakboro.\n\n“The Trump-Vance campaign will be rescheduling these events in North Carolina as soon as possible,” the campaign said.\n\nHarris-Walz campaign says it raised over $20 million since running mate announcement\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s campaign announcement has proven to be a fundraising success, according to a statement from the campaign Tuesday.\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign says it has raised more than $20 million since this morning’s announcement of Walz joining Harris on the Democratic ticket in November.\n\nWalz says he ‘can’t wait’ to debate JD Vance: ‘These guys are creepy’\n\nGov. Walz came out hard against former President Donald Trump and his running mate Sen. JD Vance during his first campaign rally speech as Harris’ vice presidential pick.\n\n“Donald Trump’s not fighting for you or your family,” Walz said. He never sat at that kitchen table, like the one I grew up at, wondering how we were going to pay the bills. He sat at his country club in Mar a Lago wondering how he can cut taxes for his rich friends,” Walz added.\n\nTurning his attention to Vance, Walz said, “His running mate shares his dangerous and backward agenda for this country.”\n\n“I got to tell you, I can’t wait to debate the guy,” Walz continued, quipping, “That is, if he’s willing to get off the couch and show up.”\n\nCalling out the Republican ticket, Walz added, “These guys are creepy. And yeah, it’s just weird as hell.”\n\nHarris and Walz are officially the Democratic nominees: DNC\n\nAs Harris and Walz took the stage in Philadelphia, the Democratic National Committee announced they are officially the Democratic nominees for president and vice president.\n\n“Vice President Harris and Governor Tim Walz officially accepted the nominations today, following the close of delegate voting on Monday, August 5th and the official certification of the roll call by Convention Secretary Jason Rae. Convention Chair Minyon Moore then certified Governor Walz as her running mate,” according to the statement from DNC Chair Jaime Harrison and DNCC Chair Minyon Moore.\n\nHarris addressed the nomination at the campaign rally, saying, “I stand before you today to proudly announce I am now, officially, the Democratic nominee for president of the United States.”\n\nHarris praises Walz’s background in politics and teaching: ‘Our values are the same’\n\nDuring their first joint campaign rally, Vice President Kamala Harris introduced her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and touted his progressive record as state governor, his background as a high school teacher and football coach and a U.S. military sergeant.\n\n“Since the day that I announced my candidacy, I set out to find a partner who can help build this brighter future. A leader who will help unite our nation and move us forward. A fighter for the middle class. A patriot who believes as I do in the extraordinary promise of America,” Harris of her search for a VP pick.\n\n“Tim is more than a governor. To his wife, Gwen, he is a husband. To his kids, Hope and Gus, he is a dad. To his fellow veterans, he is Sgt. Major Walz, to the people of Southern Minnesota for 12 years, he was congressman. To his former high school students, he was Mr. Walz. And to his former high school football players, he was coach,” Harris said.\n\n“Coach Walz and I may hail from different corners of this great country,” Harris continued, “But our values are the same.”\n\nHarris and Walz take the stage in Philadelphia in first joint campaign rally\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and her newly announced running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, were met with loud applause and cheers in Philadelphia as they made their first joint appearance.\n\nThat massive crowd gave Harris and Walz a long standing ovation as they took the stage to the song “Freedom” by Beyoncé.\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro speaks ahead of 1st joint Harris-Walz rally\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro has taken to the stage and is speaking in Philadelphia ahead of the first joint Harris-Walz rally.\n\nWalz to tout his record, Harris’ strengths as prosecutor during campaign rally: Excerpts\n\nGov.

And — she brings joy to everything she does,” the excepts read.\n\nThe governor is also expected to speak about his experiences from his days as a teacher to legislating as an elected official.\n\n“These same values I learned on the family farm and tried to instill in my students, I took to Congress and the state capital, and now, Vice President Harris and I are running to take them to the White House,” the excerpts read.\n\n“Donald Trump — he sees the world differently. He doesn’t know the first thing about service — because he’s too busy serving himself,” the excerpts read.\n\n-ABC News’ Gabriella Abdul-Hakim\n\nWalz, during vetting process, said he never used a teleprompter before: Source\n\nTim Walz said during the VP vetting process that he had never used a teleprompter before, according to source familiar.\n\nThe governor practiced using one before his remarks tonight to be comfortable using it during the joint rally with Kamala Harris in Philadelphia, according to the source.\n\nCNN first reported the teleprompter detail.\n\n-ABC News’ Selina Wang\n\nWalz arrives in Philadelphia: ‘Hello Philly!’\n\nMinnesota Gov.

Tim Walz, Sen. JD Vance said he wants to but is going to wait until Walz is the official vice presidential nominee.\n\n“I absolutely want to debate Tim Walz, but I want to debate him, actually, after he’s actually officially the nominee, and I did call him and congratulate him and offered him my best wishes. I think that’s the polite thing to do,” he said.\n\n-ABC News’ Soo Rin Kim, Hannah Demissie, Lalee Ibssa and Kelsey Walsh\n\nClyburn says Walz will be a ‘strong partner’ for Harris\n\nRep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., said in a statement that Gov.

Tim Walz] to be my running mate,” Harris wrote on Instagram.\n\n“One of the things that stood out to me about Tim is how his convictions on fighting for middle class families run deep. It’s personal,” she continued.\n\n“He grew up in a small town in Nebraska, spending summers working on his family’s farm. His father died of cancer when he was 19, and his family relied on Social Security survivor benefit checks to make ends meet. At 17, he enlisted in the National Guard, serving for 24 years. He used his GI Bill benefits to go to college, and become a teacher. He served as both the football coach and the advisor of the Gay-Straight Alliance,” Harris wrote.\n\n“I share this background both because it’s impressive in its own right, and because you see in no uncertain terms how it informs his record. He worked with Republicans to pass infrastructure investments. He cut taxes for working families. He passed a law to provide paid family and medical leave to Minnesotan families,” she continued. “He made Minnesota the first state in the country to pass a law providing constitutional abortion protections after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, and as an avid hunter, he passed a bill requiring universal background checks for gun purchases.”\n\n“But what impressed me most about Tim is his deep commitment to his family: Gwen, Gus, and Hope. Doug and I look forward to working with him and Gwen to build an administration that reflects our shared values,” she said.\n\n-ABC News’ Gabriella Abdul-Hakim, Fritz Farrow and Will McDuffie\n\nTrump campaign fundraising email from JD Vance says ‘I will wipe the floor with Tim Walz’\n\nThe Trump campaign sent a fundraising email from Sen.

It’s just not — he’s right down the middle. He is a heartland of America Democrat. He was the chair of our Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and I don’t want anybody to forget that — he made tremendous, tremendous gains for our veterans,” Pelosi said.\n\n“We made more progress that has ever been made in the history of our country since the GI Bill under his leadership,” she continued.\n\nPelosi complimented his background and credentials, including serving in the National Guard.\n\n“So, he brings the security credential. He brings the rural credential. And he will do in rural America,” Pelosi said.\n\n“So it’s really mystifying to me to see someone that I worked with, shall we say, right down the middle characterized on the left in his regard. He has [Harris’] confidence obviously,” she added.\n\n“[Walz] has a great vision for our country. It is about working-class families, about rural America, about our veterans.
