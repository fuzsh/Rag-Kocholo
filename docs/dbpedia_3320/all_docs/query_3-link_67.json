Future programs on Tennessee Williams will include conversations with Cherry Jones, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, and Tennessee Williams' agent Mitch Douglas.\n\nHunter made her Broadway debut as Stella Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on Dec. 3, 1947. She subsequently won Academy and Golden Globe awards for her performance in the film version of Streetcar. Last season, Hunter returned to the Barrymore Theatre, appearing as Lady Markby in An Ideal Husband.\n\nThe Nov. 24 program is at 6:30 PM. Free tickets will be distributed (with a maximum of two tickets per person) two hours prior to the program at the information desk on the plaza level of the New York Library for the Performing Arts, 40 Lincoln Center Plaza.
