She later recalled a lonely childhood, made more tolerable by \"acting out\" characters from storybooks in front of the mirror. After graduating from high school, where she was featured in plays, she took ingénue roles in a variety of stock companies. An appearance in Arsenic and Old Lace at the Pasadena Playhouse brought her to the attention of film producer David O. Selznick, who signed her with Vanguard Films and also changed her name.\n\nAfter an auspicious screen debut in the quality thriller The Seventh Victim (1943), Hunter went on to play in a number of mediocre movies, most on loan to other studios, until English directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger cast her in the English fantasy A Matter of Life and Death, which was selected for the first royal command film performance and released as Stairway to Heaven (1946) in the United States. In 1995, Columbia, in conjunction with Martin Scorsese and the British Film Institute, would release a restored print of the film. Hunter, who had remained good friends with Powell and Pressburger, was on hand for many of the festivities surrounding the film's restoration.\n\nHunter's Broadway break came with her return to America and the opportunity to play Stella Kowalski in the Tennessee Williams' drama A Streetcar Named Desire (1947). Her portrayal won the praise of the critics, including William Hawkins of the New York World-Telegram who thought her \"mellow and philosophical as the devoted Stella, who tries to synchronize two impossible loyalties.\" For her work in Streetcar, which ran for two and a half years on Broadway, Hunter won the Donaldson Award (1948) and the Critics Circle Award (1948) for Best Supporting Actress. Elia Kazan, who had directed the play, dubbed Hunter \"unique among actresses. She is first a person and second a member of the acting profession.\" Kazan, who went on to direct the movie version with Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh , called on Hunter to recreate her role in the film, which was released in 1951. The praise of the critics was once again overwhelming, and Hunter walked away with the 1952 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She also won the Foreign Correspondents Award and a special Achievement Award from Look magazine who cited her as \"standing out in bold normality among the frenetic characters around her.\"\n\nSoon after her movie triumph in Streetcar, Hunter fell victim to the McCarthy hysteria of the 1950s. Listed in the notorious \"Red Channels\" as a communist sympathizer, she was blacklisted by the industry for several years. She made movies only sporadically after that, concentrating\n\ninstead on stage and television. On Broadway, she was particularly notable as Luba in Darkness at Noon (1951) and Karen Wright in Lillian Hellman 's The Children's Hour (1952). Her impressive television credits include most of the \"playhouse\" shows, as well as appearances in such well-known series as \"Mannix,\" \"Gunsmoke,\" \"Columbo,\" \"Marcus Welby, M.D.,\" and \"Ironside.\" Of her later movies, Hunter was particularly proud of the two science-fiction films Planet of the Apes (1968) and Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970), although she called the hours in make-up \"pure hell.\"\n\nKim Hunter's first marriage to William Baldwin ended in divorce in 1946. In 1951, she married writer-director Robert Emmett, and the couple make their home in Greenwich Village, New York. Hunter authored an \"autobiographical\" cookbook, Loose in the Kitchen, in 1975.\n\nsources:\n\nCandee, Marjorie Dent, ed. Current Biography, 1952. NY: H.W. Wilson, 1952.\n\nKatz, Ephraim.
