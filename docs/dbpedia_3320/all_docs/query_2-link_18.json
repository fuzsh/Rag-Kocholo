        "text": "Submitted by Terry Hanstock Kim Hunter\n\nObituaries from various US newspapers\n\n(mainly based quite closely on the Associated Press release) The Advocate (Baton Rouge, LA.)\n\nSeptember 12, 2002, Thursday METRO EDITION\n\n\"Streetcar,\" \"Apes\" star Hunter dies\n\nOscar-winning actress Kim Hunter, who played everything from Marlon Brando's betrayed wife to an ape-woman psychologist in a career spanning more than 50 years, died Wednesday in Manhattan. She was 79.\n\nHunter's death was discovered in the morning by a visiting nurse, according to Lionel Larner, her longtime agent. \"She had been in failing health in the last months,\" Larner said.\n\nHunter was best known for two roles that could not have been more different. In her Broadway debut in 1947, she played Stella Kowalski opposite Brando's brutish Stanley in Tennessee Williams' \"A Streetcar Named Desire\"; Hunter won an Oscar for best supporting actress when she repeated the role in the film version of \"Streetcar\" in 1951.\n\nBut she may be best known to modern film audiences for the role she created in 1968, under a faceful of latex makeup that took four hours to apply: That of the compassionate and rational simian Dr. Zira, in \"Planet of the Apes.\" Hunter repeated her role in two more films, \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\" (1970) and \"Escape from the Planet of the Apes\" (1971).\n\n\"It was pretty claustrophobic and painful to a certain extent,\" Hunter said years later. \"The only thing of me that came through were my eyeballs.\"\n\nStill, Hunter liked the role, liked the series (the first \"Planet,\" especially) and above all, liked acting.\n\nCalgary Herald\n\nSeptember 12, 2002 Thursday Final Edition\n\nStreetcar star Kim Hunter dies\n\nKim Hunter, the versatile actress who won a supporting Oscar in 1951 as the long-suffering Stella in A Streetcar Named Desire and appeared in three Planet of the Apes movies, died Wednesday. She was 79.\n\nHunter died in her Greenwich Village apartment from an apparent heart attack, said her daughter, Kathryn Emmett.\n\nA shy, modest person, Hunter enjoyed a long and busy career in theatre and television, less so in films, partly because she was blacklisted during the red-hunting 1950s and didn't fit the sexpot pattern for female Hollywood stars.\n\nA Streetcar Named Desire provided the highlight of her career. The play was cast with Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski, Karl Malden as Mitch and Jessica Tandy as the tragic Blanche DuBois. Director Elia Kazan admitted in his autobiography, A Life, that he had trouble casting Stella \"because I enjoy looking at girls.\"\n\nHe added of Hunter: \"The minute I saw her I was attracted to her, which is the best possible reaction when casting young women.\"\n\nBrando, Malden and Hunter played their roles in the somewhat sanitized film version (Hollywood still adhered to a strict moral self-censorship). Because Warner Bros. needed a movie star for marquee value, Vivien Leigh, who had appeared as Blanche in London, repeated the role in the film.\n\nLeigh, Malden and Hunter won Academy Awards; despite his unforgettable performance, Brando did not. Humphrey Bogart was awarded a long overdue Oscar for The African Queen.\n\nHunter told the New Orleans Times-Picayune in 1999 that after she left Streetcar, she tried to avoid seeing the play with other casts.\n\n\"It's simply that I have no objectivity about it,\" she said. \"It was so much a part of my life, it would be unfair to the productions and performers.\"\n\nOscar's legendary golden touch didn't seem to apply to Hunter. Her subsequent films were few and they lacked the lustre of Streetcar.\n\nHer screen career entered a lull in the late '50s, after Hunter, a liberal Democrat, was listed as a communist sympathizer by Red Channels, a red-hunting pamphlet that influenced hiring by studios and TV networks.\n\nHer return to film was Lilith (1964), which starred Warren Beatty, Jean Seberg and Peter Fonda. Four years later came Planet of the Apes.\n\nHunter was cast as Dr. Zira, a chimpanzee psychiatrist in the science fiction classic about a group of astronauts from a ruined Earth who discover a future world ruled by apes, with humans as slaves. The actress spent hours as the makeup and monkey suit were applied and later removed.\n\n\"It was pretty claustrophobic and painful to a certain extent,\" she told a reporter in 1998. \"The only thing of me that came through was my eyeballs.\"\n\nShe was intrigued enough with the character and the plots that she appeared in two sequels, Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) and Escape From the Planet of the Apes (1971).\n\nHunter was born Janet Cole in Detroit on Nov. 12, 1922; her mother had been a concert pianist. She recalled later that she was a lonely child who \"picked friends out of books and played 'let's pretend' games, acting out their characters before a mirror.\"\n\nHunter was married to William Baldwin in 1944; they had a daughter, Kathryn, and divorced in 1946. In 1951, she married actor and producer Robert Emmett, with whom she sometimes co-starred in plays. Their son was named Sean Robert.\n\nLos Angeles Times\n\nSeptember 12, 2002 Thursday Home Edition\n\nKim Hunter, 79; Won Oscar for 'Streetcar'\n\nROBERT W. WELKOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER\n\nKim Hunter, the versatile stage and film actress who won 1951's Academy Award for best supporting actress as Stella Kowalski, Blanche Dubois' long-suffering sister in \"A Streetcar Named Desire,\" died Wednesday in New York. She was 79.\n\nHer death, in Greenwich Village, was caused by an apparent heart attack, according to her daughter, Kathryn Emmett.\n\nHunter created the stage role of Stella in Tennessee Williams' towering Broadway play and later rode the character to fame in Elia Kazan's Oscar-nominated film, each time playing opposite an electrifying young actor named Marlon Brando, whose shouted mating call \"Stella!\" has become an enduring part of cinematic history.\n\n\"I had read 'A Streetcar Named Desire' before I read for the part of Stella,\" Hunter would recall in a 1999 interview. \"I knew it was a good play, but I don't think I knew how special it was, what a milestone it would be. I don't think my mind worked that way.\"\n\n\"Doing 'Streetcar' was a joy, needless to say,\" she said in an earlier interview. \"Plays like that don't come along every other year. From the struggle to get everything right in rehearsals through the challenge of sustaining a long Broadway run, it was never easy. But I wouldn't have given up any of it.\"\n\nHunter originated her role on Broadway along with Brando, who played Stanley Kowalski, and Karl Malden, who played Mitch. Jessica Tandy played the tragic Blanche DuBois in the stage version, but the film role went to Vivien Leigh, who had appeared in the play in London. Leigh, Malden and Hunter won Oscars for their roles, but Brando was passed over for Humphrey Bogart in \"The African Queen.\"\n\nHunter's Oscar, however, did not translate into roles of equal stature. Her subsequent films included \"Deadline U.S.A.,\" \"Anything Can Happen,\" \"Storm Center,\" \"The Young Stranger,\" \"Bermuda Affair\" and \"Money, Women and Guns.\"\n\nIn addition to \"Streetcar,\" Hunter expressed fondness for two other film roles: the 1946 British fantasy \"Stairway to Heaven,\" in which she played a young American woman working for the Royal Air Force, and as Dr. Zira, the chimpanzee psychiatrist in the 1968 science fiction classic \"Planet of the Apes.\" She appeared in two sequels, \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\" (1970) and \"Escape from the Planet of the Apes\" (1971).\n\nHunter later recalled the arduous task of getting into makeup and the chimpanzee suit each day. \"It was pretty claustrophobic and painful to a certain extent,\" she told a reporter in 1998. \"The only thing of me that came through was my eyeballs.\"\n\nBorn Janet Cole on Nov. 12, 1922, in Detroit, her father, Donald, was a refrigeration engineer while her mother, Grace, had been trained as a concert pianist and used to accompany choral groups in public performances. Her father died when she was 3, and her mother married Bliss Stebbins, a retired businessman from Miami Beach, where the family subsequently moved.\n\nA shy child, she began to study acting with a drama coach who lived in her neighborhood, spending hours studying voice technique, theater history and theory, when not studying on her own. At 17, she joined a traveling stock company, then got involved with regional theater, auditioning in California for the acclaimed Pasadena Playhouse, where she got the ingenue part in a production of \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" and a similar role in \"The Women.\"\n\nIn 1943, an agent spotted her in Pasadena and she signed a seven-year movie contract with David Selznick. It was Selznick who suggested she change her name since Janet Cole was not theatrical enough and there were already other Janets around, including Janet Gaynor and Janet Blair. Hunter was delighted because she loathed her real name. She tossed out the name \"Kim\" because it was the name of Magnolia's daughter in \"Show Boat.\" A secretary of an RKO producer suggested \"Hunter.\" Selznick put the two together.\n\nShe made her film debut in a low-budget RKO horror film, \"The Seventh Victim,\" and followed with secondary roles in other features, eventually returning to the New York theater.\n\nIn 1947, Irene Mayer Selznick was producing \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and recommended to her ex-husband that Hunter play Stella Kowalski.\n\n\"I had done a lot of theater--summer stock, winter stock--and ... David O. Selznick put me under contract to do films,\" she recalled. \"By the time of 'Streetcar,' I had done about five. I didn't have to come back and read again; I got it. Incredible!\"\n\nIn his autobiography, \"A Life,\" Kazan noted that he cast Hunter because, \"The minute I saw her I was attracted to her, which is the best possible reaction when casting young women.\"\n\nHunter was blacklisted by the film industry shortly after winning the 1951 Oscar. While showing no bitterness, she was concerned that future generations not forget the toll taken on the entertainment industry by McCarthyism.\n\n\"For a long while, I wouldn't talk about it at all,\" she said in a 1985 interview. \"I do now, because there's a whole new generation that doesn't remember. And the more one knows, the more one can see, and not allow history to repeat itself.\"\n\nHer \"sin,\" she said, was agreeing to be a sponsor of a 1949 World Peace Conference held in New York during the time she was in \"Streetcar.\" It so happened that Life magazine came out with a big picture spread of all the celebrity sponsors and that, in her words, \"fanned the flames.\"\n\n\"I was never a Communist, nor even pro-Communist, but I was very pro-civil rights and I signed a lot of petitions,\" she recalled. \"Nobody ever came to me directly and said, 'You are blacklisted,' and I don't think I ever appeared in 'Red Channels' (a Red-scare pamphlet that published the names of those suspected of pro-Communist leanings). \"There were only signals, such as the fact there were no film offers after I won the Oscar, not even from Warner Bros., which simply never picked up on the contract they had with me.\n\n\"At one point,\" she added, \"I called the FBI and asked if I was posing a problem for my country that I was unaware of. Someone called on me and said, 'We have nothing on you. ... our problem's with your industry.' \"\n\nHunter was married to William Baldwin in 1944; they had a daughter, Kathryn, and divorced in 1946. In 1951, she married actor and producer Robert Emmett. They sometimes co-starred in plays, and they had a son, Sean. Robert Emmett died two years ago at age 78.\n\nThe Miami Herald\n\nSeptember 12, 2002 Thursday FL EDITION\n\nPlayed Stella in 'Streetcar';\n\n- Kim Hunter, the versatile actress who won a supporting Oscar in 1951 as the long-suffering Stella in A Streetcar Named Desire and appeared in three Planet of the Apes movies, died Wednesday.

Last year, she acted on the New York stage in a revival of The Madwoman of Chaillot. Hunter is survived by a daughter, Kathryn Emmett, and a son, Sean R. Emmett.\n\nThe Washington Post\n\nSeptember 12, 2002, Thursday, Final Edition\n\nKim Hunter Dies; Won Oscar as 'Stella'\n\nAdam Bernstein, Washington Post Staff Writer\n\nKim Hunter, 79, an actress whose film career peaked with her Academy Award-winning performance as Stella in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" in 1951 but who went on to a prolific career in television and theater after being temporarily blacklisted during the Red scare, died Sept. 11 at her home in New York after a heart attack.\n\nIt was once said of the petite, shy and glamour-less actress that she had \"nothing but talent.\" Ms. Hunter was usually cast in her early films as a fresh-faced ingenue or loyal wife.\n\nShe made her movie debut as the sister of a missing woman in Val Lewton's low-budget suspense classic, \"The Seventh Victim\" (1943). She then co-starred with David Niven in Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's much-heralded British romantic fantasy, \"A Matter of Life and Death\" (1946).\n\nIn 1947, film mogul David O. Selznick, who had discovered Ms. Hunter, recommended her to his former wife, Irene, who was producing Tennessee Williams's \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" on Broadway. It proved the most identifiable role of her life.\n\nAs Stella, she was torn between two powerful forces -- her disturbed and genteel sister, Blanche DuBois, and her sexually powerful, brutish husband, Stanley Kowalski.\n\nIn a cast of powerhouses that included Jessica Tandy as Blanche, Karl Malden as Blanche's suitor Mitch and Marlon Brando as Kowalski in the part that made his career, Ms. Hunter was thrown into sharp relief for her less-explosive technique of displaying a torn conscience.\n\nLook magazine gave her one of its achievement awards for \"standing out in bold normality among the frenetic characters around her.\"\n\nMs. Hunter received a best supporting actress Oscar in the film version, which like the Broadway production was directed by Elia Kazan. Vivien Leigh played Blanche in the film version and won the best actress Oscar.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Ms. Hunter appeared in movies such as \"Deadline U.S.A.\" with Humphrey Bogart, \"Anything Can Happen\" with Jose Ferrer and \"Storm Center\" with Bette Davis.\n\nBut she largely was sidelined from cinema until the early 1960s when her name was among the Communist sympathizers listed in the journal Red Channels, which influenced casting decisions at that time.\n\nHer most notable film appearance after \"Streetcar\" was playing ape scientist Dr. Zira in \"Planet of the Apes\" (1968). She spent the entire film in heavy makeup and quipped that the role was \"the most claustrophobic experience in the world.\"\n\nShe had one of the more memorable lines in the film. When Charlton Heston as the hunted human astronaut asks Zira if he can kiss her goodbye, she says, \"All right, but you're so damned ugly.\"\n\nShe reprised the role in two sequels, \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\" and \"Escape from the Planet of the Apes.\"\n\nMs. Hunter had greater success as an actress on Broadway with shows such as \"Darkness at Noon,\" \"Write Me a Murder,\" \"The Children's Hour\" and \"The Tender Trap.\" She also acted in scores of regional productions, including the Olney Theatre's 1964 production of \"Linda Stone is Brutal.\"\n\nShe also wrote an autobiographical cookbook, \"Loose in the Kitchen.\"\n\nJanet Cole was born in Detroit and grew up in Miami Beach, Fla., after her father's death. She once described her childhood as lonely and awash in \"let's pretend\" games she acted out in front of a mirror.\n\nShe was acting in a repertory company by age 15. She captured Selznick's attention while appearing in \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" at the Pasadena Community Playhouse. A few years later, Alfred Hitchcock recommended Ms. Hunter to Powell and Pressburger for \"A Matter of Life and Death.\"\n\nShe soon began working in television during its earliest days, including the Actors Studio dramatic series, directed by famed acting coach Lee Strasberg.\n\nHer marriage to William Baldwin ended in divorce. Her second husband, Robert Emmett, whom she married in 1951, died in 2000.\n\nSurvivors include a daughter from her first marriage and a son from her second marriage.\n\nBroadcast News (BN)\n\nSeptember 11, 2002 Wednesday\n\n(New York-AP) -- ''A fine actress and a wonderful person.''\n\nThat's how Charlton Heston is remembering Kim Hunter, who died in her New York apartment today at age 79, apparently of a heart attack.\n\nHeston says ''The world has lost a unique talent.'' He and Hunter starred together in the 1968 version of ''Planet of the Apes.'' Hunter was Dr. Zira, the chimpanzee scientist.\n\nHunter enjoyed a long and busy career in theater, but made fewer films, partly because she was blacklisted during the red-hunting 1950s.\n\nIn the highlight of her career, Hunter played the long-suffering Stella to Marlon Brando's Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire.'' She won a best supporting actress Oscar for her work."
