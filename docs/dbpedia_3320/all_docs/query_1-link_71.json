        "text": "Kim Dokja never thought that he would get kicked out of his job just because of some random guy’s antic. He didn’t even know what he did and how he ended up like this. But one thing’s for sure, he doesn’t have a say in that decision and the next thing he knows is that he’s alone on the street, jobless.\n\nThen, as if pitying him, Fate gives Kim Dokja another job. In this ruined world, being a doorman of an apartment is not as easy as it sounds. With doppelgangers running around freely, he can lose his life easily if he fails to recognize the residents of the apartment and accidentally lets one doppelganger inside.\n\nNonetheless, he accepted the job.\n\nKim Dokja’s first day is quite gloomy. Not many residents greeted him. Most of them only looked at him with pity. Kim Dokja knows the reason, it was because the previous doorman died because he failed to recognize a doppelganger and fell victim to it.\n\n“I hope you live a long life.” One of the residents, a grandma named Lee Yolsoon, patted his shoulder.\n\nKim Dokja held his smile and suppressed a shudder. “Thank you, Grandma Lee.”\n\nExcept for Grandma Lee, he also received some encouragement from other residents. Kim Dokja accepts all of that with a kind smile. Then, when someone from D.D.D. called him, Kim Dokja bid his goodbye to them.\n\nThe introduction to his new work was brief and easy to understand. There are a few rules he must follow. Among them was to never play with the clown. D.D.D.'s agent said that even if the clown would never harm the residents, they would surely kill the doorman. So, this is the rule he should follow if he wants to keep living.\n\nWhen Kim Dokja sat down on his chair, nervousness gripped him like a shackle. He clenches and unclenches his palm several times. “You can do it, Kim Dokja. This is your first day, you won’t die on your first day.” They say, beginner luck applies to everyone. It was Kim Dokja’s first time being a doorman, so surely, he will be lucky to survive this day.\n\nMorning time was quite peaceful. No one comes to the apartment, instead, many of the residents go out to do their job or their own business. Every time someone goes out, their name will be added to the list. So, he will know who’s going to arrive later.\n\nAlthough he was quite nervous, Kim Dokja found out that his job was quite easy. It’s his first day and he successfully identified every doppelganger that appeared in front of his door. When his work hour concluded and all residents were back in their houses, Kim Dokja sighed a sigh of relief.\n\n“Aaah... I’m alive.” His voice sounds like he’s about to cry.\n\nNevertheless, that’s how Kim Dokja’s first day went. Should he say that it was really beginner's luck?\n\n“I hope that every day stays like this.”\n\n>>>\n\nIt seems that Kim Dokja really excels in his new work. He did well for the past few days, not letting even one of the residents get killed or letting one doppelganger inside. And maybe, because of that, he gained a lot of confidence, no, too much confidence.\n\nIt happened when it was almost time for him to retire from work. All the residents on the list had already gone inside and enjoyed their evening time in their warm homes. Only 10 minutes more and Kim Dokja’s work hour is over. Kim Dokja was happily cleaning his table when he appeared.\n\n“Hello.”\n\nKim Dokja lifts his head and was greeted by a colorful mask of a clown. The clown wore a cream shirt with a red big tie on his neck. Outside of his cream shirt was a purple cardigan that looked weird. When Kim Dokja lifts his sight higher, his eyes meet the clown’s eyes behind the mask.\n\n“Do you want to play a game?”\n\nAlthough he can’t see his expression, Kim Dokja knows that the clown was smiling, his eyes were curved with his head a bit tilted to the side.\n\n“…”\n\nKim Dokja went silent for a moment. It was his first time seeing the clown.\n\n“Uh...” What did D.D.D. say? Right. Never play with the clown. “No.” Kim Dokja shakes his head.\n\nThe clown’s shoulder slumped. Even without seeing his expression with his eyes, Kim Dokja knows that the clown’s mood was soured. He was looking at Kim Dokja with a sad face. “Are you sure?” He asks with a voice full of sadness.\n\nFor a moment, Kim Dokja was going to say ‘no’ again. But looking at the clown’s eyes, his decision wavered. “Hmm...” He fell into dilemma. D.D.D. said that the clown would never harm the resident although he could lose his life if he lost. But hasn’t he been quite lucky the past few days? Also, this is his first time meeting the clown, so, he should have his beginner luck accompanying him, right? ‘Surely... it will be fine?’\n\n“Hahh,” Kim Dokja lets out a sigh. “Alright. Let’s play.”\n\nThe clown’s eyes were curved ‘till they formed crescent moons. “Excellent!” His voice was energetic. “Okay, first, let me explain the rules. Pay close attention because I will only explain it once.”\n\nGulp. Kim Dokja nodded.\n\n“We will play with cards,” The clown pulled a pack of cards out of his chest pocket. Kim Dokja’s eyes follows the clown’s hand until it put the card cleanly on the table. Handsome was the first thing that appeared on Kim Dokja’s mind when he caught sight of that strong hand. The fingers are long with his skin a bit tan. Veins were protruding on the back of his hand. “We will take turns and can only use one card per turn.”\n\nStill following the fingers that slowly pulled the cards out of its box, Kim Dokja nodded.\n\n“Only a card greater than or equal to the one in play can be used. Wildcard cards like J, Q, K, A can always be played. If you can’t use a card, you must draw one from the deck. Your turns will end if you have six cards in hand. The winner is the one who runs out of cards.”\n\nAfter pulling the cards out of the box, the clown gives Kim Dokja and himself four cards each. “We will play the best of three.” The clown’s head once again tilted to the side, the crescent moon eyes were back. “Good luck.”\n\nKim Dokja’s nod was stiff. He suddenly feels nervous.\n\nKim Dokja glances at his card, one Q club, J heart, 2 spade, and 9 heart. It was quite good. He put down a J heart on the table. Then, when the clown put a K club down, Kim Dokja pulled out his Q club. Everything went well up to this point. But when the clown put down another K card, Kim Dokja’s heart stopped for a bit second.\n\n“Damn.” He can’t help himself but to curse.\n\nHis trembling hand draws a card from the deck. It’s a 3 heart.\n\n‘Ah.’ Kim Dokja’s heart sank.\n\nThen, he draws another card. He got a 7 diamond.\n\n‘Ugh, please.’\n\nHe draws another card and pulls out a 2 diamond.\n\n‘Please, please, please!’ he started praying.\n\nBut… it was another 2, 2 club.\n\n“Huhuhuhu.”\n\nKim Dokja raised his head when he heard a creepy laugh in front of him. The clown’s shoulder was shaking, he was laughing. “I win.” Contrary to what he felt before, there’s a shudder running through Kim Dokja’s spine. The clown’s crescent moon eyes look like that ones of a crazy killer’s. “I hope you good luck on the next round.”\n\nThe clown took all the cards into his hand. Held the deck of cards in one hand. Then, he uses his other hand to lift about a third or so cards and places them atop the one in his hand. He repeated the notions a few more times before giving Kim Dokja and himself another four cards.\n\n“Let’s start.”\n\nDifferent from before, Kim Dokja is now praying to God to give him fortune. When he opens his cards, he cheered. ‘Thank god!’\n\nIt seems that Kim Dokja’s relief was clearly visible on his face. It was because at that right moment, the clown in front of him chuckled. “I guess this round is your victory.”\n\nAnd true to his words, Kim Dokja came out as the victor.\n\nThe score now is 1-1.\n\nThus, round 3 began.\n\nKim Dokja was staring at the cards in his hand and held back a shuddering sigh. He’s fucked. It was bad, worse than the first. 2 club, 5 heart, 5 spade, and one spade.\n\n‘Ah,’ Kim Dokja gulped. ‘I’ll die.’ Although he didn’t show it, his legs were shaking.\n\nBut it seems that their luck was equally bad, even the clown’s cards were not that good.\n\nAfter 3 turns, Kim Dokja only has 2 remaining cards while the clown has 4.\n\n‘Haha.’ Kim Dokja laughed inwardly, full of relief. ‘I will win,’ he thought.\n\nHowever, contrary to his expectation, at the seventh turn, he held 5 cards while the clown only had 2. Kim Dokja’s body was shaking once again. He started praying to God again. His outstretched hand that was going to pick up another card was trembling.\n\nHe closed his eyes and drew the card closer.\n\n‘Please, please!’ he pleaded to the entity above to give him luck. However…\n\n“Ah.” His heart fell when he saw the card in his hand. 3 club. Now, he has six cards in hand. And by the rules explained by the clown prior, if he has 6 cards in his hand, his turn ends. He can’t draw another card from the dock before the number of his cards is reduced. So…\n\nKim Dokja lifts his head with shaking pupils. “No way,” his mouth says unconsciously.\n\nNow, he could only pray to whoever existence out there for the clown’s cards to reach the same six as his.\n\nUnfortunately, the clown’s luck was better than Kim Dokja’s. With his last card put onto the table, there’s no card left on the clown’s hand.\n\n“Haha.” Kim Dokja could hear the eerie laugh sounding out of that clown mask. “I won.” Although the face behind the mask was smiling, Kim Dokja’s instinct was telling him to run.\n\n“Hm, where are you going?”\n\nBut before he could do that, the clown’s question stopped him. When he looked to the front, the clown’s mask was so close. He put his hands on the glass and his eyes were focused on Kim Dokja’s shaking pupils.\n\n“Can you open the door, please?” His voice was soft when he asked.\n\nKim Dokja curses. ‘Damn.’ Now he regrets his overconfidence that led him to play with the clown. If only he rejected him…\n\n“There’s no need to regret spilt milk.” Another voice from the clown drew Kim Dokja’s attention back to him. “Now, open the door.”\n\nBiting the bottom of his lips, Kim Dokja shook his head stiffly. Opening the door means letting the clown kill him. He refuses to do that.\n\nThe clown was silent for a moment. Then, he burst into a fit of laughter. “Hahaha! Are you afraid that I will kill you?” he asks in between his laugh. Instead of stopping, the clown banged his fist on the glass. “Oh, new doorman... Ahahahaha!”\n\nBehind the glass and inside his work place, Kim Dokja sit motionless. His body was shaking uncontrollably. His eyes darted from the glass and the door in worry.\n\n“Huhuhu.”\n\nThe laughter is still there. But strangely enough, the clown turned his body to the left and took steps forward.\n\n“Huh?”\n\nMoments later, the sound of the door opening was heard.\n\n“Huh!?”\n\nKim Dokja jumped from his seat. “No way.” He looked at the open door in horror.\n\n“Surprise, doorman~”\n\nAnd to his horror, the clown was inside his office. He was walking toward Kim Dokja with long strides. “Why so surprised?” In no time at all, the clown arrived in front of him. His fingers are on Kim Dokja’s chin, tipping his head upward so he can see him clearly.\n\nKim Dokja was too consumed with panic that he didn’t realize that the man pressed the closed button. A moment later, the sound of the door closing was heard. Now, Kim Dokja can’t even run outside.\n\n“You-” Kim Dokja’s voice was shaking. Not only his voice, his pupils and body were in the same condition. His mind was in an overloaded stage it almost stopped working.\n\n“Why is your body shaking, doorman? Are you afraid that I will kill you?” Again, the clown’s voice was so soft. It was like he was telling Kim Dokja that he would never do that. “Huhu, silly you. I don’t kill humans. At least, not you.” There’s an eerie mirth that makes Kim Dokja swallowed his saliva, fear crawling inside his skin as if telling him that he won’t come out of this unscathed.\n\nWhen Kim Dokja was stricken with fear, the clown was enjoying himself touching Kim Dokja’s face. At first, it was just a light touch. Then, he cupped his face with care, caressing it as if Kim Dokja was porcelain. “Your skin is soft.” Again, he talks with that eerie tone that makes Kim Dokja's skin crawl. “Can I take a bite?”\n\n“Wha-”\n\nBefore Kim Dokja could utter his question, the clown brought his face closer and lifted the mask he wore. Then, without any warning, he bites Kim Dokja’s cheek until it leaves a mark.\n\n“Soft,” he muttered.\n\nContrary to the amusement the clown felt, Kim Dokja’s body was shaking.\n\n“Hm~” The clown hummed. “Now, I’m curious how your lips would feel.”\n\nKim Dokja’s breath hitched. “What do you-” His voice was shaking, along with his pupils that were looking at the clown’s smiling lips. “Let-let me go.” His body was so heavy. He can’t even put pressure on the hand pushing the clown away.\n\nIt seems that his pathetic attempt was also amusing to the clown. The man chuckled. Instead of being pushed by that weak force, the clown closes the distance between them in a breath. “You’re interesting,” he said. “You’ve piqued my interest since the first time you become a new doorman.”\n\nIn his fear-stricken phase, Kim Dokja was surprised he could catch what the clown was saying. Since the first time he became a doorman? Then, since the first day, the clown has observed Kim Dokja from afar? At that realization, Kim Dokja’s body trembled even more violently.\n\n“Ahaha,” the clown laughed with his heavy tone of voice. “No need to be scared, doorman. Didn’t I tell you I won’t kill you?” His fingers on Kim Dokja’s face felt like a feather, soft and gentle, as if telling Kim Dokja that their owner is not dangerous. But Kim Dokja can’t feel comfort from them. The only thing he could think about was how he would die today.\n\n“Now, why don’t you tell me your name?” Kim Dokja’s face was lifted. Although he can’t see the clown’s eyes, Kim Dokja could see his lips smiling ever so openly.\n\nWhen Kim Dokja closed his mouth, refused to give him an answer, the clown’s hand became rough. He gripped his face roughly. “Answer.”\n\n“Ugh,” Kim Dokja winches. It hurts. “Kim Do-Dokja,” he finally says.\n\nThe lips stretched wide again. Seemingly satisfied, the clown let go of his strong grip. “Good.” He brought his other hand and caressed where it felt hurt. “Then, Kim Dokja, because you lost the game. From now on, you will follow whatever I tell you to.”\n\n“W-what? But there’s no-” there’s no rule like that.\n\n“Ssh.” However, the clown stopped him before he could finish his sentence. “The loser has no right to object. Now,” The man suddenly pulled Kim Dokja closer. “I have been curious about how your lips would feel. Open your mouth.”\n\nKim Dokja stares at the clown in horror. Although he’s worried about whether or not he will be killed today, another fear was stuck in his mind. It left Kim Dokja’s body rigid like a statue.\n\n“Why are you so quiet again? Open your mouth, Kim Dokja.” With a force, the clown gripped Kim Dokja’s face again. And when Kim Dokja opened his mouth to groan in pain, the clown smirked. “What a good boy.” Then, he brought his face closer and kissed Kim Dokja.\n\n“Hng?” Kim Dokja was surprised. Well, who would not? His attacker suddenly grabbed his face and kissed him.\n\nAfter another moment of panic, Kim Dokja struggles with all his might to escape. But to no avail, all his attempts were unsuccessful. The clown put one hand behind Kim Dokja’s head and the other was circled around Kim Dokja’s waist. He locked Kim Dokja’s body while at the same time turning Kim Dokja’s head to the angle he wanted.\n\nWith his nimble tongue, the clown pulled Kim Dokja’s own to dance with his. And when he felt that Kim Dokja’s strength had all left his body, the clown let go of the back of Kim Dokja’s head. Instead, he brought his hand to Kim Dokja’s chin, lifting it upwards, deepening their kisses.\n\n“Engh.” Kim Dokja’s moan was being swallowed by the clown.\n\nIt was not only the moan, even Kim Dokja’s breath was not his own when the clown let go of his swollen lips. “It’s soft and sweet. What did you eat for lunch?” The clown licked his lips. Kim Dokja was so far gone that he couldn’t hear what the clown was saying.\n\nBut it doesn’t matter though. Because the clown closed their distance again and locked Kim Dokja in another heated kiss.\n\n“Hahh,” Kim Dokja sighed in between their kisses. His hands were gripping the fabric of the clown’s clothes tightly, soundlessly begging him to let him go. “Plea-se.”\n\nHowever, the clown acts like he can’t hear him. Rather than distancing their bodies, he brought them closer. “Kim Dokja,” he suddenly says. His hand let go of Kim Dokja’s chin to grab onto his mask and lift it up.\n\nWhen he heard his name being called, it was a struggle for him to open his eyes. Nevertheless, he tried to focus on the clown in front of him. Or, you can say, the man. The clown slowly lifts his mask away from his face. What greets Kim Dokja after the clown throws his mask away is a handsome face. It was so handsome that Kim Dokja thought it was a face crafted by God himself. Momentarily, Kim Dokja forgot the situation he was in and only stared at the man’s face. His jaw was tight, his eyes were sharp, and his lips… when a smirk so smugly appeared on the clown’s face, Kim Dokja was pulled back into reality.\n\n“Like what you see?” the man says.\n\nKim Dokja flinched. Then, fear strikes him back. Kim Dokja raised his leg quickly, slamming it against the clown's side body. It was only for a moment, but the clown staggered. At that moment, Kim Dokja pushed his body up and tried to run.\n\nUnfortunately, his attempt once again failed. When he tried to get up to run, it only took him a second for his body to slam back onto the hard and cold floor.\n\n“Ugh.”\n\nEven so, he tries to get up. He needs to get away from this place. He needs to escape.\n\n‘I have to live.’\n\nHe crawled on the floor, trying to get as far away as possible.\n\nBut…\n\n“Where are you going?” The man grabbed Kim Dokja’s ankle and pulled him back. “Do you think I will let you run away that easily?” There’s a tint of laughter in the man’s voice.\n\n“Kim Dokja.”\n\nThe man turned Kim Dokja’s body easily, like he didn’t have any weight at all. Now, Kim Dokja was coming face to face with that God-carved face again. However, the astonishment on his face was gone, being replaced by bewilderment. His chance to escape was gone and he was afraid of what the crown was going to do to him.\n\nSeeing the horror in Kim Dokja’s eyes, the man laughed. “Dokja,” he called Kim Dokja’s name like they’re close. “You’re so interesting.” There’s a glint in his eyes. And… Kim Dokja be damned. Why did he just realize it now? The man’s eyes were dark and clouded with something.\n\n“Dokja,” the man called again. “Didn’t I say it already? I won’t kill you, no need to be so frightened,” he chuckled.\n\nKim Dokja gulped. He heard it clearly. The man in front of him had said that he won’t kill him. However, Kim Dokja was too nervous and frightened, he can’t just believe whatever this killer clown was saying.\n\n“I-if you’re not gon-na kill me, th-then?” He gathered his courage and asked.\n\nAgain, the man brought his hand to Kim Dokja’s cheek and caressed it so gently, almost lovingly, his mind whispered.\n\n“It’s easy. Let me do whatever I want to you.”\n\n“Huh?” Kim Dokja blinked. He forgot about his fear for a moment. However, before he could utter a question or objection, his lips were once again being sealed by the clown. “Emph!” He once again tried to push him away. But just like before, the answer is the same, it’s a futile attempt. Worst, the man took Kim Dokja’s wrists into his hand and locked it above Kim Dokja’s head.\n\nWhen his hands were out of service, Kim Dokja tried to turn his head to the side. “Engh-nh! You-” Although it’s successful, the man changed his target and licked Kim Dokja’s jaw. He peppered Kim Dokja’s neck with kisses and bites. “Mmh-stop!” He used one of his legs to kick him. But the man didn’t budge at all. Instead, he bit Kim Dokja’s neck hard. Kim Dokja’s sure it left a mark.\n\n“Dokja, why are you so stubborn?”\n\nKim Dokja turns his head left and right, conveying his refusal in action when his words didn’t even get through. “Let me go! Stop! Let me-aah!” However, his action was stopped when he felt a strange sensation on one of his nipples. When he looked down, the man’s hand had already crawled inside his shirt. “N-no…” Kim Dokja’s voice was trembling in horror. “AAH!” He threw his head back when the clown pulled his nipple hard.\n\n“Hmh,” the clown chuckled. “So sensitive, are you?” He lifted Kim Dokja’s shirt and lapped his mouth on one of his nipples.\n\nKim Dokja was shouting and kicking his legs when he felt the wet tongue swept over his nipple. Not only that, the other nipple was being played with as if it was a toy. When the man pulled it hard, Kim Dokja’s shouts changed to a groan.\n\n“Heh,” the clown laughed. He flicked Kim Dokja’s nipple lightly. “You like it like this?” Then, he pulled Kim Dokja’s other nipple with his teeth.\n\nIn response, Kim Dokja’s groans louder. He shakes his head and pleads to be let go, to stop, that it hurts.\n\nBut instead of following what Kim Dokja wished for, the man only let go of Kim Dokja’s nipple for a moment. Then, second later, he pushed the bud until it was flat with Kim Dokja’s chest. When he let go, he played it again like a new toy; flicking, pushing, and pulling it between his fingers. As for the other side, he played it with his teeth; all playful bites and serious ones until it bleeds. Lastly, he chomps hard on Kim Dokja’s chest, leaving another mark he could proudly stare at.\n\n“You look so good with all those marks on your skin,” the man chuckled.\n\nBut Kim Dokja could only stare in fear and disgust. His breathing was hard, the anxiety and panic made it hard for Kim Dokja to breathe. And his body... it was hard for him to move. Just the act of lifting his hand makes Kim Dokja extremely tired. When the clown gives Kim Dokja's skin another bite, he can only whimper in silence. It hurts.\n\nSeeing him being so quiet, the man lets out another laugh. “Why are you so quiet? Have you exhausted your voice? When it hasn’t even started yet?”\n\nKim Dokja wants it to stop. But when the word ‘hasn’t even started’ comes out, tears welling up inside his eyes, flowing out from the corner and raining down the hard floor below. “Please, stop,” he says, voice so weak he's not sure the clown can even hear it.\n\n“Ssh.” The clown wipes the tears flowing out of Kim Dokja's eyes. “Can’t have you run away when I finally got you now, can I?” He closed the distance between their lips and once again caught Kim Dokja’s into a heated kiss.\n\n“Nnh.” Kim Dokja’s moans leaked out between their kisses.\n\nMaybe it was because he had lost all his strength, but the man kiss felt different. It was still hot and difficult to keep up. He still invited Kim Dokja’s tongue into a dance that was difficult for Kim Dokja’s mushed brain to follow. But it felt even more overwhelming. Kim Dokja’s mushed brain turned into water that then evaporated into the air, his mind went blank. He doesn’t even realize that the man’s hand traveled down and down until it slipped inside Kim Dokja’s pants. With no second to waste, the man yanked Kim Dokja’s pants down and threw it to the wall, so far away from Kim Dokja’s hand to reach. Only when the clinking sound of the frame of his belt met the floor that Kim Dokja’s consciousness being pulled back into harsh reality. And when he felt the cold wind caressing his skin like giving a greeting, chills run down Kim Dokja’s spine.\n\n“A-ah no-please, no,” his voice trembled, realizing what would happen after this.\n\nContrary to the horrified gaze in Kim Dokja’s eyes, the man only smiled so handsomely. Then, he gives Kim Dokja’s lips a peck as if asking for an apology. “Didn’t I tell you already? From the moment I laid eyes on you, you’ve piqued my interest. So, isn’t it obvious what I want to do?”\n\nKim Dokja’s body shakes violently. “N-n-no.” Even his voice was not stable enough to speak.\n\nBut the man didn’t care. His hand caresses Kim Dokja’s thigh sensually. His eyes ravage Kim Dokja's naked body like a hunter scanning the prey they finally captured after a long period of effort to catch it.\n\nThe clown's touch makes Kim Dokja's skin tingle. But, instead of feeling lust, there’s only horror and disgust crawling inside him. Once again, he pleads to be let go. And for the umpteenth, the man acts deaf on Kim Dokja’s honest request.\n\nHe keeps his hand streaming down Kim Dokja’s smooth skin, stopping here and there, mapping his skin for him to come back later, before continuing its pace until it reaches its destination. “Huhu, cute.” The man grabbed Kim Dokja’s soft cock and fondle it in his hand. Suddenly, the man moves closer to Kim Dokja. The smile (grin?) was still on his face. “You’re soft.”\n\nAnd you’re crazy.\n\nHe wants to say it. But, he bit back the words that were ready to be spit out. This man, clown, is crazy. It would be much better for him to just die rather than being humiliated like this.\n\nKim Dokja clamped his mouth and eyes shut. Maybe, if he just closed his eyes and retreated to his unconsciousness, this scary situation and this crazy clown would disappear quickly.\n\nUnfortunately, instead of disappearing, the man let go of Kim Dokja’s soft cock and raised his chin softly. “Open your mouth, Kim Dokja,” he said.\n\nKim Dokja, as stubborn as he is, tried to shake his head away from the assailant. It was no use though. Because the man gave strength to his hand and it started to make Kim Dokja hurt.\n\n“Agh.”\n\nIn the end, he couldn’t keep his mouth shut and let out a groan of pain. At that moment, the man shoves two fingers inside Kim Dokja’s mouth. When he pulled Kim Dokja’s tongue, tears formed in the corner of Kim Dokja’s eyes. Kim Dokja struggles against the man’s tight hold to let his hands free. He wants to yank the man’s fingers away from his mouth. But, again, it was for naught. Kim Dokja could do nothing but let the clown do whatever he wants.\n\nOnly when he’s satisfied does the clown pull his hand back. Kim Dokja coughed, saliva flowing down from the corner of his mouth.\n\nThe clown licked the saliva on his fingers and, to Kim Dokja’s horror, muttered “Sweet.”\n\nThen, to Kim Dokja’s another horror, he felt a dull and wet thing prodding on his ass hole. At that moment, he opened his eyes wide, staring at the clown in dread. “I beg you-please, no, please...”\n\nThe answer from Kim Dokja’s dreadful imagination is a thrust of that wet and dull thing. A second later, a painful scream was heard inside the doorman's office. Kim Dokja’s face was stained with tears, his brows were taut in a frown, and his eyes were tightly shut. Kim Dokja was trying his best to breathe, the pain was too much for his virgin hole.\n\nSeeing Kim Dokja’s agony, instead of feeling pity, the clown laughed. Then, without waiting for Kim Dokja to adjust himself, he pulled his finger before slamming it back inside.\n\n“Aa-ugh.”\n\nIt was too painful.\n\nThe clown acts like he can’t hear Kim Dokja scream in pain and pull his body until he’s face to face with the person below him. He licked Kim Dokja’s lower lip and pushed another finger into Kim Dokja’s hole. When Kim Dokja opened his mouth to scream, the man pushed his tongue inside and engaged in a hot and steamy kiss.\n\nKim Dokja’s already difficult breathing became even more difficult with the man kissing him. His tongue was being pulled, his teeth were counted one by one, and when the man took Kim Dokja’s breath away, his strength and mind were completely gone. His mind goes blank. He can’t even feel the pain in his lower back. He doesn’t even realize that the man has let his wrists out of their confinement.\n\nThe clown put one hand behind Kim Dokja’s head and turned his head a bit, deepening their kiss. Saliva dripped down from either Kim Dokja’s or the man’s mouth, mingling together before flowing down Kim Dokja’s cheek and to his neck.\n\n“Haaa.” A sigh escaped Kim Dokja’s mouth.\n\n“Nnh-haah.” The sigh was quickly replaced by moans. Only then did Kim Dokja realized that the pain had already disappeared. When the clown scissored him open and pushed another finger inside, Kim Dokja’s moist eyes were already difficult to open. It was also difficult to keep his mouth shut, moans kept slipping out for the clown to hear.\n\nThe thrusts in and out of the clown’s fingers continued on for some time.\n\nIn the quiet and almost dark room, there’s only Kim Dokja’s moans and the clown’s labored breathing filling the place. Now free of their constraint, Kim Dokja’s hands were busy, confused as to whether to pull the man close or push him away. His body had already lost all its strength and his mind had already succumbed to lust. But in one corner of his mind and heart, there’s a small voice telling Kim Dokja to fight, to struggle, to escape. Unfortunately, the voice was drowned but the waves of pleasure coursing through his body.\n\nThe sensation was foreign, it was the first time for Kim Dokja to feel like this. He has no immune to such pleasure. That’s why, when it suddenly stopped, Kim Dokja’s tightly shut eyes opened and looked at the clown with puzzled expression. That voice that stayed in the corner of his mind was cheering that the nightmare had finally stopped.\n\nIt was only for a moment. The next moment, another deafening scream was heard inside the doorman's office.\n\n\"AAAAH!!\"\n\nKim Dokja’s head was thrown to the back. Both his mouth and eyes were wide open, spitting screams of pain and tears full of agony. It was hot, the pain surging through from his lower back was too much for him to handle.\n\nWhen Kim Dokja was busy of letting the world know that he was in pain, that the pain felt like he’s in hell, the clown was smiling ever so widely from one ear to the other. For him, Kim Dokja’s agony is a sight to behold and Kim Dokja’s scream is music to his ear.\n\n“Ahahahah!” A maniac laughter echoes in the now quiet room.\n\nKim Dokja’s scream had stopped since moments ago, but his mouth was still hung open, his eyes staring wide at nothing, tears streaming down his face. The last fire that was struggling until the end was extinguished at once. Now, there's only dullness in Kim Dokja's wide eyes. He has resigned himself to whatever it is this clown going to do.\n\n“You’re so beautiful, doorman.” The clown brought his hands and gently cupped Kim Dokja’s face. With delicate movement, he brought Kim Dokja’s eyes to look straight at him. Inside the dull and empty eyes, the clown’s insane smile was clearly captured like a photo.\n\nThe clown pushed his cock entirely inside the warm hole with one strong thrust. At the same time, Kim Dokja’s scream was being swallowed by his kiss. “Do you want all residents to come here and witness this? Well, I don’t mind though.” Again, the madness seeped into the clown’s words. The ruthless onslaught continues, he thrusts his cock in and out, not stopping even for a bit.\n\n“N-no… Please…” Even so, Kim Dokja's weak voice is still trying to help him to get out of this situation. He pleads and begs for the clown to stop this. His eyes are looking at nothing, dull and lifeless, but his eyes mouth continues to open and close on its own. “Ple-ngh-sto-”\n\nThe clown enjoyed Kim Dokja’s pitiful act, seeing those beautiful eyes crying gave him chills and excitement. But he can't stand looking at Kim Dokja's dull and lifeless eyes. Although he could see his reflection clearly there, it didn't give him the satisfaction he wanted. Therefore, the man pushes his head closer and bites Kim Dokja's cheek, close to his eyes.\n\n\"AAAKH!\" Kim Dokja screamed. The focus is back, along with the fear and the trembling in his body and eyes.\n\n“Yoo Joonghyuk.” In the middle of this madness, the clown caressed Kim Dokja's cheek, the one he had just bitten, carefully.\n\nFrom the crack of his eyes, Kim Dokja’s teary eyes were locked onto the clown’s lips. “Uh?” he questioned.\n\nThe clown smiled. “My name,” he said. “Say it.”\n\n“…” Instead of following the order, Kim Dokja closed his mouth tightly, feeling unfair that the clown was doing whatever he wanted to do while Kim Dokja couldn't even escape into his mind world.\n\nIt seems that Kim Dokja’s action successfully scratched the man’s, Yoo Joonghyuk’s, patience. He clenched Kim Dokja’s chin with one hand and pulled his face closer. “Say. My. Name.” Each syllable was followed with gained strength.\n\n“Ugh,” Kim Dokja can’t help but let out a hurtful groan. His lower back felt uncomfortable and the hand clenching his chin was sending him another alarm of pain. “Yoo-Yoo Joonghyuk,” he finally says.\n\nRight after that, the clown let his chin go, smiling ever so brightly. “My name sounds so good when you say it. Heheh,” he laughed. Then, his eyes manic eyes bored a hole into Kim Dokja’s frightened ones. “Joonghyuk. Call me.”\n\n“Joo-Joonghyuk.”\n\nThe smile turned even wider. He grabbed the side of Kim Dokja’s head and pulled him into another kiss. “Moan my name, Dokja,” he whispered right in Kim Dokja’s ear.\n\nYoo Joonghyuk straightened his back, put Kim Dokja’s leg on his shoulder, and held the other one tightly in his hand. Yoo Joonghyuk’s action earned him a surprised ‘huh’ from Kim Dokja.\n\nWhen he pulled out his cock, Kim Dokja unconsciously took a deep breath. “Enh?” Even his moan was laced with wonder. And when he slammed it back, Kim Dokja’s breath hitched. “AH!?” he screamed.\n\n“Ah- wa-wait-”\n\nYoo Joonghyuk slammed his cock inside Kim Dokja’s hole, in and out, in and out. Kim Dokja was already a messy mess when he gave another bite onto Kim Dokja’s thigh. The sound of skin slapping another skin was clearly heard and Kim Dokja’s soft cock has already risen to its full length, he’s hard because of Yoo Joonghyuk’s ministration. That detail sent another chill of excitement into Yoo Joonghyuk’s blood.\n\n“Dokja… Ah, my Dokja.” The crazed smile plastered on Yoo Joonghyuk’s face was revealing the extent of the owner’s insanity. His eyes were dark with lust and desire to eat Kim Dokja completely.\n\nThe hunger was intense. Of course, it had appeared since the moment he laid his eyes on Kim Dokja. Since then, the hunger lay low, hiding its presence as to not scare its prey away. Now, when Kim Dokja was laid on the plate that is cold floor of his own workplace, pinned beneath Yoo Joonghyuk’s body, and writhing in pleasure he refused to acknowledge, the hunger jumped onto the surface. It showed its teeth right when it was sure that its prey won’t run away, no, he can’t run away.\n\n“My Dokja. My beloved doorman. It feels good, right?”\n\nKim Dokja can’t answer, his brain has already turned into a mush for him to form any comprehensible words. Although his mouth was opening and closing, following the rhythm of Yoo Joonghyuk’s rough moves, the only thing he could voice out was moan and moan only. He would sob when Yoo Joonghyuk’s cock bumped into his prostate. And sometimes, he would wail or whine when he purposely missed it. It makes him crazy. No, that’s not quite right. He has already gone crazy.\n\n“Joo-Joonghyuk! Ah-please.” Please what? Please stop? Please continue? Kim Dokja can’t think. It was too much. The pleasure, the pain, it feels good, it hurts. “Joonghyuk! Joonghyuk!”\n\nIn his lust-ridded mind, Kim Dokja’s hand moves to his own cock. He wants to cum. But before he could do that, a hand slammed his hand away.\n\n“No can do, Dokja. You will only cum from my cock inside you. So,” Yoo Joonghyuk intertwined their hands and brought the back of Kim Dokja’s hand to his lips. “Don’t do that again, okay?” He kissed gently.\n\nRight after that, Yoo Joonghyuk only pounds at his prostate, sending another pleasure into Kim Dokjaa's blood stream. It makes Kim Dokja’s mind blank and his mouth chants Yoo Joonghyuk’s name like a mantra.\n\nAt one point, Yoo Joonghyuk pulls Kim Dokja's hand until he sits on his lap. Kim Dokja moaned an \"Ah?!\" when Yoo Joonghyuk's cock thrust even deeper. Then, he was mouthing that it was too deep, he can't handle it.\n\nYoo Joonghyuk laughed. He kissed Kim Dokja's ear gently when he pulled his body to get up, he supported Kim Dokja's body using his hand. Kim Dokja's hold on his shoulder was tighter than ever when he started to walk, moaning 'ah ah ah' when his cock was being pulled out and in from his movement. Then, Yoo Joonghyuk stopped right in front of Kim Dokja's chair and put him down.\n\n\"Huh?\" For a moment, Kim Dokja's closed eyes opened. When he cracked open his eyes, Yoo Joonghyuk was standing in front of him. Because of the absence of light inside the room, he can't see his expression clearly. He could only yelp when his legs were suddenly pulled up by two strong hands. He throws his head to the back when Yoo Joonghyuk's cock once again claimed the place inside his ass.\n\n\"Hahah,\" Yoo Joonghyuk laughed. \"Now, you will remember me every time you sit on this chair or when you work identifying those ugly doppelgangers. Right, Dokja?\"\n\nKim Dokja can't give an answer. Yoo Joonghyuk's rough thrust was giving him no time to think. He doesn't even recognize the word coming out of his mouth, is it a plea to let go, begging for him to stop, or that it feels good just like what the clown wanted to hear? Either way, the clown stopped hurting Kim Dokja's body and only focused on his thrust in and out, satiating his own hunger.\n\nYoo Joonghyuk’s rough and harsh thrusts changed their rhythm into erratic ones. He pounds Kim Dokja’s inside as if imprinting the shape of his cock onto Kim Dokja’s wall, as if telling it to always remember the shape of Yoo Joonghyuk’s cock, to not forget because he will surely come back later.\n\nIt was not only the rhythm that changed. Yoo Joonghyuk has stopped biting Kim Dokja’s inner thigh and changed his target to Kim Dokja’s neck. He pushed his head closer to Kim Dokja's, sealing their lips when he hit his climax. Kim Dokja’s warm hole was instantly filled with Yoo Joonghyuk’s semen, planting his seed to the warm cave that finally sated his hunger.\n\nOn the other hand, Kim Dokja’s sperm makes a mess on his chest and Yoo Joonghyuk’s stomach. Kim Dokja cum with a loud scream. His eyes turned wide because of the pleasure and even until Yoo Joonghyuk stared at him with a satisfied grin, Kim Dokja’s mind was still too far gone, he hasn't come down from his high yet.\n\n“That was amazing, my doorman.”\n\nYoo Joonghyuk's eyes glowed when he scanned Kim Dokja’s face, mouth agape with saliva dripping out from the corner. Kim Dokja’s eyes were blank from pleasure.\n\n“Huhu,” Yoo Joonghyuk laughed. “So beautiful.” He brought Kim Dokja’s face closer and kissed him. Then, he pulled out his cock, earning a moan that was quickly swallowed up by the kiss.\n\nWhen he pulled his body back, his eyes followed the way his sperm flowed out of Kim Dokja’s hole, quickly wetting the chair Kim Dokja uses daily at work. The grin turned even wider, the hunger was purring in satisfaction. Kim Dokja won't be able to forget it. And if he does forget, \"Huhu.\" Yoo Joonghyuk will make him remember again.\n\n“Well then, see you later, my Dokja.”\n\nHe bids his farewell, leaving Kim Dokja’s naked body alone on the dark of the doorman's office."
