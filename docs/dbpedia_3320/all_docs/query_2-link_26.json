        "text": "Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Kim Hunter, who won a supporting Oscar in 1951 as the long-suffering Stella in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and appeared in three \"Planet of the Apes\" movies, died Wednesday. She was 79.\n\nHunter apparently suffered a heart attack in her Greenwich Village apartment, said her daughter, Kathryn Emmett.\n\nThe actress enjoyed a long and busy career in theater, but less in films, partly because she was blacklisted during the red-hunting 1950s.\n\n\"Kim Hunter was a fine actress and a wonderful person,\" said actor Charlton Heston, who co-starred in \"Planet of the Apes.\" \"The world has lost a unique talent.\"\n\n\"A Streetcar Named Desire\" was the highlight of Hunter's career. The play was cast with Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski, Karl Malden as Mitch, and Jessica Tandy as the tragic Blanche DuBois.\n\nBrando, Malden and Hunter played their roles in the somewhat sanitized film version. Hunter, Malden and Vivien Leigh, as Blanche, won Academy Awards; despite his unforgettable performance, Brando did not.\n\nHunter's subsequent films were few, and they lacked the luster of \"Streetcar.\" Among them: \"Deadline U.S.A.,\" as newspaper editor Humphrey Bogart's estranged wife; \"Anything Can Happen,\" as Russian immigrant Jose Ferrer's wife; \"Storm Center,\" a minor film starring Bette Davis; also \"The Young Stranger\" and \"Bermuda Affair.\"\n\nHer screen career entered a lull in the late '50s, after Hunter, a liberal Democrat, was listed as a communist sympathizer by Red Channels, a red-hunting pamphlet that influenced hiring by studios and TV networks.\n\nShe returned to film in \"Lilith\" (1964), which starred Warren Beatty, Jean Seberg and Peter Fonda. Four years later came \"Planet of the Apes.\"\n\nHunter was cast as Dr. Zira, a chimpanzee psychiatrist in the science fiction classic. Applying and removing the makeup and monkey suit took hours.\n\n\"It was pretty claustrophobic and painful to a certain extent,\" she said in a 1998 interview.\n\nShe was enough intrigued with the character and the plots that she appeared in two sequels, \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\" (1970) and \"Escape from the Planet of the Apes\" (1971).\n\nCopyright 2002 Associated Press.
