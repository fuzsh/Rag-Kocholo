        "text": "Kim Hunter (born Nov. 12, 1922, Detroit, Mich., U.S.—died Sept. 11, 2002, New York, N.Y.) was an American actress of stage, screen, and television who was perhaps best known for her portrayals of two extremely varied roles: Stella Kowalski in the stage (1947) and film (1951) versions of A Streetcar Named Desire and the sympathetic chimpanzee psychiatrist Dr. Zira in three Planet of the Apes movies (1968, 1970, and 1971).\n\nHunter became interested in acting when she was a young child and at age 17 joined a little theatre group and made her stage debut in Penny Wise. She then acted on tours and in stock companies, and in 1942 her performance in Arsenic and Old Lace at the Pasadena (Calif.) Playhouse attracted the attention of David O. Selznick and resulted in a film contract. Hunter’s first movie role came in 1943 with The Seventh Victim, and that same year she appeared in Tender Comrade. One of her most notable roles was in the British film A Matter of Life and Death (1946; U.S. title, Stairway to Heaven), and upon her return to the United States, she was cast in A Streetcar Named Desire. While performing in that play, she took the opportunity to study at the Actors Studio. In 1951 Hunter starred with Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh in the film version of A Streetcar Named Desire, and she won a best supporting actress Academy Award for her performance as Stanley Kowalski’s anguished wife.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia"
