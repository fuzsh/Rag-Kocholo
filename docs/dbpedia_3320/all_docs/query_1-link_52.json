        "text": "$10,000 Lottery Ticket Sold In Columbia, South Carolina\n\nIf you happened to be in Columbia last week and purchased a lottery ticket before Friday night’s drawing, you might want to double check that ticket. Someone bought a winning lottery ticket that will make them $10,000 richer.\n\nWinning Lottery Ticket Sold\n\nAccording to the South Carolina Education Lottery website, someone purchased a Mega Millions ticket at Lucky Stop, located at 743 Hazelwood Road in Columbia. The player who purchased that ticket matched four white ball numbers and the gold Megaball number, resulting in a $10,000 prize from Friday night’s drawing.\n\nThe odds of matching four white ball numbers and the Megaball number at 1 in 931,001.\n\nThe numbers from the Friday, August 2nd Mega Millions drawing:\n\n6 – 7 – 24 – 44 – 54\n\nMegaball: 13\n\nDouble check your ticket. Currently, more than 11,000 lottery players in South Carolina are holding tickets for prizes ranging from $2 up to $10,000. Players have 180 days from the date of the drawing to claim their prize. All information regarding claiming a prize can be found at sceducationlottery.com.\n\nAs of this writing, the estimated annuitized jackpot for the Mega Millions drawing is $398 million. The Power Ball drawing is at $185 million, and the Palmetto Cash 5 is $170,000.\n\nBenfits From The South Carolina Education Lottery\n\nWhen you play the lottery in South Carolina, you are supporting education. Since the lottery began in 2002, more than $8.3 billion has been appropriated by the General Assembly to benefit education in the state.\n\nThe money goes toward scholarships and grants, other higher education programs, and helps support the Research Centers for Economic Excellence at Clemson University, MUSC, and the University of South Carolina.\n\nFunds from the lottery also help support K-12 education through enhancement programs, educational programs, and the purchase of school buses, including fueling and maintenance costs for the buses.\n\nDistribution of net funds from the South Carolina Education Lottery is the responsibility of the General Assembly of South Carolina. Every year, the Legislature determines how the lottery funds will be distributed. Get more information on the SC Education Lottery legislation here.\n\n“Cody” Blaine Jackson is one half of the Kicks Wake Up Krew on Kicks 99, and also serves as the Digital Program Director for Beasley Media Group in Augusta.
