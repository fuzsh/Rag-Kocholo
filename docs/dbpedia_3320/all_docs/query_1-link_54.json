        "text": "A new approach to solving homelessness in Greeley helped a 40-year-old sign a lease for the first time in his life.\n\nAfter living on the streets for nearly 20 years, the first step in improving his quality of life started with housing. But support remains by his side as he navigates a new world.\n\nOver a year ago, the Greeley City Council approved piloting the Housing First model, an evidence-based approach to assisting people experiencing homelessness.\n\nHousing First is a national model that prioritizes safe, secure and permanent housing without any requirements before clients receive “individualized and client-driven” supportive services, such as community and social integration, employment, reconnecting with family or receiving mental health or substance abuse treatment.\n\nStudies found that 85% or more of the chronically homeless population served under Housing First won’t return to homelessness, according to assistant city manager Juliana Kitten. The Colorado Coalition for the Homeless’ Housing First programs have a housing retention rate of 96% among more than 400 people served.\n\n“I’ve seen people have hope for the first time,” housing case manager Mark Howey said.\n\nOver a year of Housing First\n\nThe city of Greeley has contributed $1.4 million from the general fund to create a Housing Intensive Case Management Team. The team meets and works directly with clients to get them housed and address their individual needs.\n\nUnder the direction of Kitten, the pilot program’s foundation team consists of six case managers and one care specialist. Both Howey and Maria Hernandez, the team’s manager, joined the city about a year ago because they loved the model’s “no-prerequisites-required” approach.\n\nHistorically, solutions to homelessness included proving one was “housing ready,” which involved getting clean or sober, finding employment or living in transitional housing for a few years before clients received a place to live. This method worked for some, but those with the most complex needs often fell out of the step-by-step process and ended up back on the street, Kitten said.\n\nHousing First changes this.\n\nHernandez, who has worked with the homeless population for 14 years in the community, finds that not forcing case managers to interview a person to see if they’re eligible for services makes a difference. Unlike other programs, Housing First involves conversations about a person’s needs and how the team can help, leading clients to become more self-sufficient.\n\n“At the end of the day, this is your program,” Hernandez said about her clients. “This is for you. It’s not for me, but I will be with you along the way.”\n\nFor Howey, Kitten’s passion and vision convinced him to leave behind his previous role as operations manager for the Guadalupe Community Center. Although uneducated about Housing First before he began working with the city, Howey noticed how many other strategies to combat homelessness have been “rule-based,” especially when it comes to addiction.\n\nThese housing initiatives would kick out people if they relapsed no matter the circumstances. That never sat right with Howey.\n\nHousing First does the opposite, bringing in case managers who listen and care without judgment to help build up the confidence among their clients, some of whom have been kicked down by society and have lost the ability to believe in themselves, Howey said.\n\nThe clients, Howey said, are put in the driver’s seat as they work through Housing First.\n\n“I’m just here to support you,” he said. “I’m the training wheels that you think you need, but you really don’t. But if you do hit to the side, I bounce you back up.”\n\nBuilding these strong relationships between clients and case managers to access additional support services starts with a focus on housing.\n\nIn addition to money from the general fund, Kitten applied for grant funding from the state to receive housing vouchers. These allow renters to pay 30% of their income, and the permanent housing subsidy pays the remainder.\n\nThrough the grant, Greeley received 60 housing vouchers to provide support for 60 people. Recently, Greeley obtained 20 more vouchers, Kitten added, which will go toward people requiring ongoing and longer-term support.\n\nKitten, who has experience working with homelessness in larger communities, said Greeley is an amazing place for Housing First because of its smaller population. Unlike much larger cities struggling with a massive chronic homeless population, Greeley still has available apartments that accept vouchers.\n\nSince the inception of the Housing First model in May 2023, the vouchers have helped house 104 people in 74 households, accomplishing the program’s main goal of housing people quickly. This totals $976,800 that goes to private landlords, Kitten reported.\n\nThe Housing First model aims to house people with vouchers within six weeks of initial engagement. The process to acquire a voucher can be lengthy, Kitten said, starting with the application and followed by approval from the state, the administration of local vouchers from North Range Behavioral Health, meetings with clients and case managers and searching and securing places.\n\n“I think we will get better at that quickness,” she said.\n\nDuring the wait for permanent housing, the city secures hotels for especially vulnerable homeless populations like elderly and disabled people. From their hotels, their case managers can continue to conduct visits like they would in clients’ homes.\n\nThe city has since applied for a two-year transitional homeless response grant, which allowed for the creation of an outreach team and a rapid rehousing team. The rapid rehousing team can serve 80 people, focusing on those with more “moderate needs” who will require less support and have more independence in about two years or less. Kitten estimates about 45% of the people in the rapid rehousing program will need permanent subsidies and ongoing care.\n\nSaving lives, costs\n\nThe Housing First model is more than simply placing homeless people into a home and forgetting about them. The program builds foundations of support. This measure has begun to change the stereotypes and stigmas that come with homelessness in the community, according to Howey.\n\nHowey has seen the toughest guys on the streets of Greeley break down and cry when they finally find a place to call home. He said their real selves come out when they no longer have to have their guard up and be in survival mode because they have a safe place to stay. Then, people can really start to focus on themselves.\n\nSome of Howey’s clients initially shared they had no goals for the future, but many have found their purpose since entering the program, whether that’s going back to school, finding a job, volunteering, reconnecting with family or becoming sober.\n\n“The two goals that I always hear as sort of priorities from people that we’re serving is reconnecting with family and getting employment,” Kitten said.\n\nThe initial 60 people housed through the program had been in Greeley for an average of 26 years, Kitten said. Case managers use resources in the community to get their clients reintegrated into the community, including going to the Greeley Recreation Center, the Greeley Active Adult Center and the Frontier House.\n\nFor a 70-year-old client with severe medical issues, there’s less of an interest in getting out into the community and more of a desire to relax at home, Hernandez said, highlighting the importance of individualized care.\n\nSome of the participants in Housing First have never received medical care. Hernandez has seen clients who have lived on the streets with seizures, cancers, strokes and other chronic health issues.\n\nAs a result, in the aftermath of secured permanent housing, case managers will often shift the focus on helping clients get the needed care to improve their quality of life and give them one less thing to worry about.\n\n“They’re getting the proper care,” Hernandez said. “I can’t imagine having that type of illness and living out in the streets. Going to the doctor is not a priority. Surviving and someone taking your belongings is what you’re worried about.”\n\nConnecting clients to services can be challenging, however, due to some people’s hesitancy and fears. This is especially true for people in need of mental health care, and even medical care, because it’s often something they have gone without for such a long time.\n\nHernadez said the case managers must take “baby steps” with clients by offering guidance, support and advocacy. Though case managers give direction, all participants have “consumer choice” in their housing as well as the services they receive, including when to start or stop services.\n\nIn Hernadez’s eyes, the success of Housing First has been treating clients like humans who feel worthy of having a home because she gives them the care and respect she would hope others would give to her brother, parents or grandparents. Because homelessness could happen to anyone.\n\n“We want you to live with as much dignity as possible,” she said.\n\nThe case managers’ present role has also helped secure good relationships with landlords, according to Hernandez and Howey. Property management companies have been understanding and open despite housing people who have never signed a lease, as well as those with mental health issues or past behavioral issues.\n\nThe relationships with landlords have created a strong resource list of housing options that case managers can present to the homeless population, Howey said. But case managers take that support a step further and go with the future tenants to see available places and help them find a good fit.\n\nSince the birth of Greeley’s Housing First program, Hernadez is happy to report that none of the former homeless participants have been evicted. The team has continued to educate and spread awareness to the community on how this program benefits all — homeless people, landlords, businesses, community members and the city of Greeley.\n\n“I think what we’ve accomplished is just bringing hope to the community and finally having solutions to the questions that they have asked,” Howey said.\n\nThe team can also measure success based on cost savings from decreases in ambulance calls, police interactions, shelter stays and hospital visits. Jodi Hartmann, the executive director of High Plains Housing Development Corp., said it’s much more cost-effective to follow the Housing First model than having people live on the streets and utilizing the community’s resources and emergency services.\n\nThe city has partnered with the University of Northern Colorado to do a two-year cost-benefit analysis to showcase any decreases in interactions with police and other emergency services. At this time, Kitten and Kim Priddy, the city’s director of data and analytics, declined to release the data from the first few months of the initial program because it “is not statistically significant.”\n\nKitten anticipates “more solid and statistically significant information” toward the end of the year.\n\nOver the past year, Howey has seen a decrease in numbers at the cold weather shelter and fewer homeless people on the streets. Several business owners also reported to Kitten that they think things have gotten better when it comes to homelessness, she said.\n\n“I think one of the reasons that it (Housing First) really proliferated across the country is that it’s shown to have a lot of cost savings by housing someone, giving them the supports they need to stay housed versus when you leave someone on the street,” Kitten said.\n\nCommunity partnerships are key\n\nOther Greeley agencies have seen Housing First make a difference across the country and in their community, choosing to incorporate it into their work to fight homelessness and create affordable housing.\n\nThe nonprofit High Plains Housing Development Corp. works to develop affordable housing for people living unhoused, precariously housed or just very low-income households, Hartmann said. Through permanent supportive housing, Hartmann believes that Housing First and the model’s supportive services will solve a “big portion” of homelessness in the city.\n\nHigh Plains Housing’s StarRise Apartments at North Weld Village, Phase 1 of a permanent supportive housing project, will help the most vulnerable people living on the streets receive housing and supportive services programming. Tenants will include chronically homeless populations struggling with behavioral health, substance abuse or chronic medical conditions.\n\nThe nonprofit broke ground on the development’s first phase in June and expects it to be complete by November 2025.\n\nHigh Plains Housing modeled StarRise after two permanent supportive housing communities that use Housing First in Fort Collins, Redtail Ponds and Mason Place. Redtail Ponds found that about 85% of people housed remain stably housed eight years later.\n\nThe permanent supportive housing model at StarRise, which will have 58 one-bedroom units, provides on-site supportive services that help tenants remain housed, including case management, behavioral health intervention, frequent visits from medical providers, nutrition, employment and life skills, according to Hartmann.\n\n“It’s just a common-sense approach,” Hartmann said. “What we believe is that you get folks housed … then you begin to work on any of the barriers that are preventing them from staying stably housed. What we like to say about Housing First is that it’s not housing. It’s actually a program.”\n\nOnce the StarRise project begins operations, Hartmann anticipates a strong partnership with the city of Greeley with the city and the nonprofit sending referrals back and forth and both case manager teams working together.\n\nGreeley community members have communicated the need for more outreach when addressing homelessness. If the community sees outreach as a value, then community partners must help support initiatives with funding to keep it going, Kitten said.\n\nSo far, funding for the Homeless Solutions Department sits at 73% from grants and 26% from the city’s general fund. Kitten will continue to look for grants to fund the housing program, but more buy-in from community partners, like nonprofits, faith-based groups, businesses, the city and Weld County will make a greater impact.\n\nMore vouchers, less problems\n\nEven though Kitten and her team have made progress in addressing homelessness, others struggling to find stable places to live feel unworthy or can’t understand why they haven’t been chosen yet, according to Howey.\n\nHernandez’s team has a goal to continue focusing on their 60 households. Though they have helped some of the most vulnerable people in the community, she believes more people need vouchers and support.\n\nEventually, the Housing First team will have clientele who may need the housing voucher but don’t require additional support anymore, Howey predicted.\n\nNo matter the client’s confidence and independence levels, the team will always check in because they don’t want to abandon anyone after building those strong relationships. However, the team predicts the frequency of check-ins may decrease over time depending on the client’s needs.\n\nHowey sees one of his clients, who uses a wheelchair, every day. Howey will likely always need to support this client. But Howey is OK with that, he said with a visible spark of passion for his job.\n\nAs Kitten and the city receive more vouchers and buy-in from community partners, she plans to expand her housing team so they can provide support to more unhoused people.\n\n“We can really make a significant impact and also create a system so that people aren’t homeless for years and years and years,” Kitten said."
