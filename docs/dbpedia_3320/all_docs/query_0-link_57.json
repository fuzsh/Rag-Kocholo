        "text": "Well, some of us arenâ€™t like you rich folks who can just throw your money away whenever you think you might need it. I understand the need to plan ahead, but I also know that making assumptions is never a good thing without having all the facts.\n\nThat's hilarious. Rich is $200 for more RAM? Then yes, I'm rich.\n\nMy posts around here are always \"consumer first\" and I'm usually ripping Apple for blatant robbery pricing on Mac upgrades relative to market rates for commodities like RAM and SSD. I'm chipping into this convo because what I presume is a young computer buyer shopping for \"first Mac\" is seeking help to a worn-out question: is base specs enough? Of course, Apple fans will say YES. \"We\" always push whatever Apple has for sale at the time.\n\nBut even Apple probably thinks that 8GB RAM is not enough in 2024 as M4 in iPad has 12GB (with 6GB just made inactive for that iPad). M4 Macs are probably going to have 12GB base RAM. Does anyone dare call Apple wrong or dumb for putting more base RAM in than \"most people need\"... only a few weeks from now? Com'on people, I dare you. Anyone? Anyone?\n\nNo one can have \"all of the facts\" about the amount of future time OP is likely hoping to use this Mac. Is that 5 years or is that 10 years? Whether 5 or 10, a thousand things can happen to OP to make him need a bit more RAM or SSD in this computer. Apple has engineered Silicon Macs to eliminate all such upgrade possibilities after date of purchase. When one is buying for 5-10 years of potential use, better slap in some \"what if\" assumptions. Else, you need a lot more than $200 to buy the replacement whole Mac sooner than expected.\n\nAnd if they can't scratch up $200 bucks, get a minimum wage job for about a week or so and delay the purchase that long. Besides getting enough RAM to better deal with who knows what years from now, it will also, apparently make you rich. The chicks love \"rich\" so flash that $200 around a bit if you also want to attract some love.\n\nI keep looking at the base configuration for a 15\" MBA with 8gb/256gb. This computer will strictly be a \"sitting on the couch surfing the internet while watching tv\" type computer. I will be looking up sports scores, posting on forums, shopping on Amazon, random google searches, Youtube videos, and reading the occasional email (gmail). I use Safari for my browser fyi. Normally I do this stuff on my Iphone 15 Plus but it would be nicer to do it on a laptop with a 15\" display and with a real keyboard to type on.\n\nI will probably install Adobe Reader to look at the occasional PDF. I may or may not install MS Office for Word, but this won't be a work machine at all.\n\nI will never use it for anything more than what I listed. With that said, is the base configuration enough for me and should last me 5 or more years? I have been reading on the topic of RAM and so many people are saying \"you need 16GB of RAM, you never know what you will want to do on the machine in the future, and you need 16gb for this and that, etc\". All the stuff people mention doing, video stuff etc I will never do.\n\nI just want a laptop that I can have at most 5 tabs of Safari open and that's pretty much it, and the computer run smoothly.\n\nWith that said, should I spend the extra money for 16gb of RAM for the sake of Safari web browsing, or in my situation is that literally a waste of money\n\nIn a word, yes. The base is more than enough. I'd look for a refurbished one.\n\nSo tell us why the base model 8GB RAM M1 Mac is better than 16GB RAM i9 Intel Mac? Or is it the 16GB RAM in the Intel Mac is worse/better than the 8Gb RAM in a M1 Mac? Or, that the M1 chip is better than the Intel i9, whatever the size of the RAM? Or, that Intel i9 couldn't run with 8GB RAM? Or...?\n\nLike I said here, I might be buying a base model M chip 15\" MBA in 2025, so your \"knowledge\" would be helpful proving that 8GB RAM on a M2/M3 chip is not enough for my work.\n\nAh ok so this is where we have to dig a little deeper and things get a little more confusing. Theoretically, the base MX chip with 8GB of RAM could be enough for your workload. It would feel faster to you. But that's because you are leapfrogging to a much faster compute in general, tasks are completed faster hence RAM frees up faster. But the amount of RAM being used by the system in the moment of compute/usage is still the same.\n\nThe main advantage of AS (Apple Silicon M series chips) is that the CPU itself is MUCH faster, AND it's VERY power efficient. This is helped partly by the fact that it shifted to use LPDDRx RAM modules. Which are smaller and faster as well. Which is how they can put it on the chip itself also.\n\nSo let's look at projected performance.\n\nFrom your post: \"I am using a 15\" Intel 2018 (made in April 2019), and it is still doing well after 5+ years. Sure, it has 16GB Ram, but with an older 8th gen i7\"\n\nThis lets me figure out that the CPU in your laptop is an intel Core i7 -8750H. That config came with 16GB DDR4-2400. https://www.anandtech.com/show/13073/apple-updates-macbook-pro-family-for-2018\n\nFor comparison the M1 comes with LPDDR4x-4266. The M2& M3 with LPDDR5-6400. The M4 with LPDDR5x-7500. (grabbed from wikipedia pages)\n\nFor CPU performance since we're talking about more lightweight tasks, let's use Geekbench6 benchmarks. I'll throw in some comparisons to all MX Chips. This will assess both the CPU and RAM at the same time basically.\n\nThis is your laptop processor:\n\nM1:\n\nM2:\n\nM3:\n\nMacBook Air (13-inch, M3, 2024) - Geekbench\n\nBenchmark results for a Mac15,12 with an Apple M3 processor.\n\nSingle Core ScoreMulti Core ScoreRAM Speedi7 8750H129546042400M1233683214266M2257896576400M33065119596400\n\nBefore we even talk about CPU performance, wow, look at those RAM speeds. The M1 RAM is almost 2x as fast. The m2/M3 about 2.5x as fast. Not only that, it's now on the same chip die basically, so stuff can get from the CPU to the RAM even faster than on the intel chip which has to send and receive stuff from a chip that is physically further away on the motherboard. (This physical distance thing isn't going to make as big of a difference compared to the raw speed increases on RAM speed, but it is worth noting as it does contribute to the overall system feeling snappier.)\n\nThe M1 CPU perf wise based on Geekbench is about 2x as fast as your CPU. So yeah even those 8GB models are gonna appear to be much better than your current machine.\n\nHowever, let's say you have MS Excel open with the same spreadsheet on an Intel Mac and M1 Mac. That program and spreadsheet still theoretically should take the same amount of RAM when they're open. (there might be some minor differences here since it's x86 vs ARM though) You can just open them must faster, the application will run smoother, and you can save the file and close the program faster. The minute you load up more than the 8GB can hold, it starts using SWAP from the SSD. which is gonna be much slower, and then it's like well why is my machine doing this one task so much slower now that I'm also doing other things on the machine at the same time.\n\nEdit: Or alternatively, why does it take longer to switch between tasks.\n\nThe thing is though, because the M1 and forward Macs are so much more powerful than the Intel Macs, they sort of kind of make up for this speed loss with raw CPU perf and RAM speed. That doesn't mean you're \"using less RAM\" it just means your computer is faster at getting stuff done.\n\nEdit: Site note, SSD speeds have also gotten faster, so that helps contribute as well.\n\nSo lets answer some of the questions in your first part:\n\nSo tell us why the base model 8GB RAM M1 Mac is better than 16GB RAM i9 Intel Mac?\n\n-- significant raw computing speed increase.\n\nOr is it the 16GB RAM in the Intel Mac is worse/better than the 8Gb RAM in a M1 Mac?\n\n-- The 16 GB of RAM amount is better. The M1 RAM Speed is better.\n\nOr, that the M1 chip is better than the Intel i9, whatever the size of the RAM?\n\n-- Correct.\n\nOr, that Intel i9 couldn't run with 8GB RAM?\n\n-- It could run!\n\nHope this helps, let me know if you have more questions.\n\nEdits: Spelling errors.\n\nNot really, not from someone, who claims as a computer engineer.\n\nWell, if that \"heavy cow\" Windows 11 works quite well with the same work load with just 8GB RAM, why not the newest macOS on a super M chip? The base macOS apps don't change much. GIMP won't change either. Maybe Word and Excel, and Skype. But still, if a merely old-fashioned 8GB RAM can do that with an Intel Windows laptop, why can't the macOS on the top notch M chip?\n\n(I'm sure my Intel MBP will last longer than 2025, so buying date will be even later. It's been there 5+ years!)\n\nTechnically they're right. I can't REALLY prove it, not without constantly monitoring your RAM consumption on your device. I can only provide you with a hypothetical scenario and the tech specs/benchmark results that are easily available.\n\nIf your work load works on a machine with 8GB of RAM as well as 16GB of RAM at the same perceived speeds no matter what else you have running and regardless of OS, than you are set with 8GB. But again, software does tend to creep up in RAM usage over years, also new programs come out that we may start using. So If you plan to keep the machine for a long time, more RAM is good investment IMO.\n\nAlso you say \"The base macOS apps don't change much. GIMP won't change either. Maybe Word and Excel, and Skype.\"\n\nThat's pretty hypothetical. Unless you're a developer on those apps, you can't say that for sure. My take on RAM usage will increase is also hypothetical. But I will predict RAM creep will continue to happen based off looking at computing history trends.\n\nEdit: Continuing response:\n\nYou say:\n\n\"Well, if that \"heavy cow\" Windows 11 works quite well with the same work load with just 8GB RAM, why not the newest macOS on a super M chip? ... But still, if a merely old-fashioned 8GB RAM can do that with an Intel Windows laptop, why can't the macOS on the top notch M chip?\"\n\nWhat windows 11 machine are you using as a comparison?\n\nIf an Intel Windows laptop can do it, sure macOS with a M chip can probably do it yes. (barring x86/ARM software compatibility issues and software availability).\n\nIt's not about whether it CAN do it. It is about whether it CAN do it WELL, right NOW and in the FUTURE.\n\nIf someone is buying a new laptop, they should realize, it's not an appreciating asset. It is an expenditure. If RAM usage goes up and your computer feels slower later on you're gonna want to spend money on a new machine again, which is going to cost more than the cost of getting more RAM in the new machine now.\n\nThe OP question was, is the base model with 8GB Ram enough for his basic needs, not what might happen in the future?\n\nWe disagree. IMO clearly when one is asking about buying a new box it is all about what might happen in the future.\n\nTechnically they're right. I can't REALLY prove it, not without constantly monitoring your RAM consumption on your device. I can only provide you with a hypothetical scenario and the tech specs/benchmark results that are easily available.\n\nIf your work load works on a machine with 8GB of RAM as well as 16GB of RAM at the same perceived speeds no matter what else you have running and regardless of OS, than you are set with 8GB.

But I will predict RAM creep will continue to happen based off looking at computing history trends.\n\nIndeed. After 40 years of Mac RAM demands constantly increasing, IMO anyone thoughtful should expect RAM creep to continue. Three areas that additionally suggest the creep may even accelerate are\n\nâ€¢ UMA\n\nâ€¢ AI\n\nâ€¢ Apple' telegraphing future RAM by offering 128 GB in laptops\n\nI keep looking at the base configuration for a 15\" MBA with 8gb/256gb.
