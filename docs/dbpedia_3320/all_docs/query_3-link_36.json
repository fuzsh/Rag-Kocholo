        "text": "Happy birthday to actress Kim Hunter, born Nov. 12, 1922 in Detroit, MI. Hunter took an interest in acting at an early age, joining a theater group when she was 17, and eventually touring and playing in stock companies. In 1942, while performing in Arsenic and Old Lace, she came to the attention of David O. Selznick, and was subsequently signed to RKO Pictures. Her first film was the Val Lewton film noir The Seventh Victim (1943). In 1944, she appeared in another noir film, When Strangers Mary (aka Betrayed). She won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her portrayal of Stella Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), and in 1953, played opposite Humphrey Bogart in another noir classic, Deadline USA. Unfortunately, like many actors, writers, and directors of the time, Hunter was blacklisted on suspicion of being a Communist because she helped sponsor a world peace conference in 1949. By the late 1950s she was able to resume her acting career, appearing mostly on television. In 1968, Hunter played what would become one of her better known roles, Zira in Planet of the Apes, which she reprised in two sequels, Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) and Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971). Hunter continued to appear on television and in movies up until the late 1990s. She died of a heart attack in 2002 at age 79."
