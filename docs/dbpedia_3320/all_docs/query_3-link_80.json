        "text": "Very lengthy synopsis courtesy imdb as always “The film is about a celebrity medium that gets pulled back into her past and her home town when someone she knows seeks her help with an “apparition” plaguing their family home. She as a Trans woman, moved away many years ago and hasn’t returned, when she does she begins to realize that some of her memories are “missing” and that becomes very apparent once the case gets deeper. The story revolves around her finding the truth about the apparition and herself.”\n\nSo, first of all, this movie was titled “The Entity Within” on Tubi where I watched it, which is where it said it was from 2020. Googling only turned up a short film called “The Entity” from 2020 which was obviously not this movie. So I eventually figured out the film’s original title is Dr. Kim etc etc and it seems to have actually premiered in 2022, it just also says 2023 on imdb.\n\nAH.\n\nThis seems to be another super indie movie, and you know me – I try to go easy on indie movies. So, yeah.\n\nThis movie was exceptionally long but it still seemed as if there wasn’t enough time to fit every single idea into the script. I think this would’ve been better suited to being a book or a short tv series so the ideas would have time to settle. Getting into my critique before outlining the plot!\n\nSo we start off the movie with digital effects that you’ll figure out later are meant to represent the past. 11ish year old boy Mitchell is hanging out with his friend, the 12ish year old boy Jamie. Mitchell’s little brother Cain wants to play with them, but Mitchell refuses, partly because Cain creeps Mitchell out, and I’m just thinking now that Mitchell may have been the ACTOR’S name not the character’s. Oh well. Apparently Mitchell woke up once to Cain holding a knife out, Cain saying it’s “to protect him.” Understandable, have a good day.\n\nJamie heads home, because it’s a school night. And then some… chaos ensues. Ghost chaos! Mitchell sneaks into Jamie’s house and asks if he can spend the night. Jamie’s like “ugh fine” and then Mitchell’s eyes turn luminous green and he says “Now I know TWO of your secrets!” and we pan over to see the ghostly form of Mitchell’s dad.\n\nIn the current day, we see yet another transwoman whose hair is better than mine, in the green room before some tv interview. She’s talking to a flamboyant gay southern guy, who happens to be… a ghost! The reveal of him being a ghost I thought was genuinely good. We see our protagonist, Kim, talking to him while she’s doing her makeup and stuff in a mirror, and then someone comes in to tell her she’s almost on, Kim turns around and nobody is on the couch, then she turns back to the mirror and the guy she was talking to is in the mirror. HE’S A GHOST. I really liked that.\n\nOkay this is going to take a million years to finish, so I’m really going to do what I can to actually summarize things. The host of the show criticizes Kim – Kim has an actual degree in communications but is “wasting it” on talking to ghosts, Kim argues that she is in fact using her communications education in not only helping ghosts with unfinished business, but with helping the living. The set of this tv show is incredibly echoey so I honestly couldn’t hear everything that was being said.\n\nAfter the interview, a youngish man approaches Kim, calling her Jamie – so I guess being a closeted transgender person was one of the secrets Mitchell knew! It turns out this man is Cain, who wants Kim’s help with a ghost that’s currently haunting his mom. Things have been rough ever since Mitchell died – I guess the ghost killed him?\n\nThis is one of the spots where I think this being a tv show or book would’ve made more sense. We only see Kim’s mom once, when she’s taking the person formerly known as Jamie home, and we don’t get any kind of indication of what Kim’s life was like – did she move from home never to return because of transphobia? Or was it because her friend died under weird circumstances? Why does Cain know that she’s Jamie since Kim looks absolutely nothing like she did when she was a 12 year old identifying as a boy. Just seems like some backstory would be helpful.\n\nBy the way we here at Thank God It’s Blogday respect pronouns! It’s just hard with a case like this when you have a fictional character who was identifying one way and now identifies as another, it’s hard to figure out how to refer to the person. I’m trying my best!\n\nSo anyway, Kim and her crew head to Cain’s mom’s house. I’m not sure what the crew DO exactly. Kim seems to imply that two of them can communicate with ghosts and one can merely SENSE them, but apparently that’s the more impressive skill? But I don’t understand why they’re all together in a team.\n\nOn the way, Kim encounters a ghost of a girl who was murdered some amount of time ago – Kim says the ghost is “35 years old” but I don’t know if that means she DIED 35 years ago, or like if she was 12 when she was murdered that means she died 23 years ago? She figures out the ghost is fine not moving on to the afterlife, she apparently enjoys just hanging out and trying to trick people into giving her toilet paper or whatever.\n\nAgain, this is something that would make more sense if this was a tv show or a book. The scene doesn’t seem to matter at all to anything, it’s just a thing that happens, but if the narrative had a much longer, episodic pace this could’ve been something that helped with character development or even let us in on more of Kim’s backstory.\n\nThis movie really does have a lot of things that happen that seem like the start of an idea that never goes anywhere. So I would LOVE if the writers/director/whatever managed to turn this into a miniseries or a book or a graphic novel or something. I think the story overall is interesting, the execution is just too scattered.\n\nThe gang makes it to the house, and I realize I forgot to tell you about the amorous couple who sneak into the house earlier and jfc that was a long scene of them sneaking around until they finally get killed.\n\nCain’s obnoxious ex-girlfriend shows up and calls Kim some rude things, then Cain and the ex have very loud sex (mercifully offscreen), he breaks up with her for good, then she’s like “Okay but let me take a shower” ???? and then she dies.\n\nJesus this is so hard to explain what happens in this movie because there’s just stuff happening all the time.\n\nUh okay so all this time, Kim has been getting random flashes of memory, of things she didn’t remember before, making her realize she’s had some hole in her memory ever since she was about 12 and Mitchell’s father died. One of Kim’s crew gets all pissy and asks if she has a conscience about stealing other people’s stories, which is yet again something that would’ve made more sense with a much longer narrative timeframe. I THINK that may have come up during the interview towards the beginning, but it doesn’t figure into the story AT ALL and since we know Kim is genuinely psychic it doesn’t even make sense why she’d be stealing people’s stories. This doesn’t come to any sort of resolution, either.\n\nUm and then Cain kills? the black member of the crew? and the one who accuses Kim of stealing gets replaced by a ghost but he’s still alive? And the bearded one is also there??\n\nEventually Cain’s mom comes out of her catatonic state and tells Kim that Cain is NOT to be trusted, he’s been weird ever since his father died and it’s just been getting worse. Cain’s mom then explains that she killed her extremely abusive husband, but Jamie actually witnessed it. Cain’s mom didn’t want a child to have to live with that knowledge, so she hired a voodoo witch?? to erase the memories of Cain, Mitchell, and Jamie, although she warns that if any of the kids have “the touch” the memory wipe may not be permanent – which is why Kim has been having these weird flashes of memory this whole time.\n\nCain’s dad is a vengeful ghost and Cain is just crazy or something, idk. Black girl turns out to not be dead and shoots Cain, and Kim banishes Cain’s dad’s ghost to the afterlife with the power of the goddess or whatever.\n\nAnd the movie ends super abruptly, with the one member of the crew being like “Hold on, let me check something” while Kim looks at this stuffed bunny that Mitchell owned as a kid that still somehow looks pristine after 30 years. I guess because he’s dead, idk. THE END.\n\nOne final “see if the narrative had more time like if it was a tv show or book, the ending wouldn’t have just been like SPLAT THE END”.\n\nYeah, so, that’s it.\n\nI thought there were a lot of great ideas in this movie – I mean it’s great to see more stories featuring transgender folks that aren’t ABOUT being trans. This was just about helping ghosts and the main character happened to be trans. It would still be cool if they were able to redo the story in a longer format to actually tie being trans in somehow – they could have a plot twist where we’re led to believe Kim left her hometown because she was trans, but it was actually because people were discriminating against her for being a psychic medium.\n\nAnd stuff like “actual psychic is still stealing other people’s stories for profit” is interesting, as is the part about having holes in your memory because you witnessed a murder as a child.\n\nIt was just… not enough time for any of the ideas to really settle, everything just kept HAPPENING and it was too much to follow.\n\nThis movie isn’t remotely scary, but it doesn’t feel like it was SUPPOSED to be. It’s got ghosts and murder and abuse in it but it doesn’t feel like it was supposed to be a scary movie. I’m honestly not sure what it WAS supposed to be.\n\nI did like director/co-writer/star Chaselyn Wade’s performance. There were some iffy deliveries but overall I liked her. She had some great facial expressions, too. The three child actors were about what you would expect from child actors with no other credits who are appearing in an indie movie. I think the two boys who played brothers Cain and Mitchell were brothers in real life? Anyway like I said, I try to go easy on indie movies, and especially kids in indie movies. I have definitely seen worse, and I wouldn’t say I could’ve done better at that age. They should be proud of themselves for being in a movie and remembering lines.\n\nThe other adult actors were okay. Nothing really blew me out of the water, except Cain’s mom’s actress who out-acted everybody else for some reason.\n\nThis actually doesn’t have an imdb rating. Nobody has rated it. Amazing. Possibly I’m the first person to see it who didn’t go to its film premiere. So I can honestly say I’d rate it higher than imdb’s rating! Haha.\n\nThe plot does actually make sense even though the details meander quite a bit. I’ve seen worse. The camera work was not great sometimes – at the tv studio the framerate was so weird it was like watching a music video, I didn’t like it. I did think the methods they used to indicate the past and to indicate ghosts were good, especially assuming they had like no budget. They did what they could with people’s outfits and toys, but just putting on a sort of weird aged video filter was a good idea. I don’t think it worked GREAT but the IDEA was good, and it worked enough that I figured out what it meant right away. The ghosts all have sort of green highlights on them. It works.\n\nI wouldn’t say overall this movie is worth a watch, but I didn’t HATE IT which is a glowing recommendation compared to some of the stuff I’ve covered so far. I respect the indie grind and I wish only the best for everyone involved as long as they aren’t murderers in real life.\n\nI will conclude by saying if your only response is to say something rude about transgender people, you can leave. 🙂"
