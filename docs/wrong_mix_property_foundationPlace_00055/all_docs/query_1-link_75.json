        "text": "Flaster Greenberg PC announced today that its Intellectual Property Department and Philadelphia office continues to grow with the addition of seven more patent members who have joined the firm this week. The additions include four associates and three paralegals. The vast majority of this second wave that was welcomed to Flaster’s Philadelphia office hail from the same boutique intellectual property law firm that previously employed the four IP shareholders who joined the firm last week. The new patent associates include Benjamin Chalfin, Aakash Patel, Ryan Peddle and Nicholas Rogillio, all of whom represent clients primarily in the telecommunications, electrical devices, software, medical device, pharmaceutical, and manufacturing industries. In total, 11 new team members, including the four shareholders, four associates, and three paralegals have joined Flaster Greenberg since the beginning of 2020, expanding the firm’s Philadelphia office and Intellectual Property Department. Last week, the firm announced the addition of shareholders Ross Alexander, Michael Bonella, Joseph Klinicki, and Michael Piscitelli to the firm, bringing with them a robust international patent procurement and litigation practice and more than 60 years of combined legal experience.\n\n“I am excited to continue growing my patent prosecution practice with my partners at Flaster Greenberg,” said Ross Alexander, patent shareholder who joined the firm last week. “We have been impressed with the support that Flaster Greenberg has in place for maintaining our current patent prosecution clients, as well as the resources to help us grow this part of the practice. It is obviously a great benefit to have our litigators joining us, as we see being a full-service patent practice as benefitting both the prosecutors and litigators to provide the highest value services to our clients.”\n\n“We’re extremely happy to welcome the associates and paralegals this week to complement and support the firm’s booming IP practice and increase our footprint in Center City,” said Jordan LaVine, Chair of Flaster Greenberg’s Intellectual Property Department and Lateral Hiring Committee.\n\nThe addition of the 11-member patent group is part of Flaster Greenberg’s ongoing growth strategy. Over the last two years, Flaster Greenberg has added 25 new attorneys and opened offices in Conshohocken, PA; Jenkintown, PA; Princeton, NJ; and Boca Raton, FL. In January 2019, the firm announced that the attorneys and staff of estate planning boutique law firm Plotnick & Ellis joined Flaster Greenberg, bringing with them a team of six attorneys, two paralegals, and five administrative staff members and a new office location. Additionally, the firm recently welcomed litigation attorney Daniel Epstein. Last December, the firm announced the addition of shareholder Daniel Markind to the Philadelphia office, bringing with him a nationally known Aviation Practice, and business and aviation law attorney Lauren Schwimmer, both formerly of Weir & Partners LLP. Tax attorney Eric Loi and Trusts and Estates attorney Courtney Dolaway also joined the Flaster Greenberg team last fall. Last year, the firm welcomed Elder & Disability Law shareholder Jane Fearn-Zimmer, formerly of Rothkoff Law Group, and Tax shareholder David Neufeld, former name partner at The Law Office of David Neufeld, to the firm’s Cherry Hill office. In 2017, the firm brought on Corporate and Tax shareholder Joseph Hayes, former Principal at Offit Kurman. The firm most recently launched a Cannabis Practice, an Elder & Disability Law Practice, a PFAS practice, an Aviation Law Industry Group, and formalized its Pharmaceutical Industry Group. The firm was also named one of the Best Places to Work in New Jersey by NJBiz in 2018. Most recently, the firm announced the election of Courtney Dolaway, Angie Gambone, Lauren Schwimmer and Damien Tancredi to shareholders effective January 1, 2020.\n\nAs stated in last week’s announcement welcoming the four shareholders:\n\n“We are excited to begin 2020 by welcoming this accomplished and well-respected group of attorneys and staffers,” said Zuckerman. “We truly believe that this will be a great partnership due in part to the similarities and synergies among our strategic paths and values, and also our overall approach to the practice of law. We look forward to the group taking part in the evolution of not only our Intellectual Property Department, but our firm as a whole.”\n\n“The team’s extremely sophisticated practice adds a highly sought after specialty that complements perfectly our existing IP Practice and that will add many blue chip clients to our existing roster of valued clients,” said LaVine.\n\n“We are extremely impressed by Flaster Greenberg’s existing capabilities and their commitment to growth moving forward,” said Joseph Klinicki, Chair of Flaster Greenberg’s Patent Practice Group. “It is clear that the firm’s emphasis on transparency, fairness, and strong advocacy for their clients has driven their success, and we are all very excited about the possibilities that this opportunity creates for both us and our clients.”\n\n“We saw early on that Flaster would provide the perfect platform from which to serve our existing clients and to grow our practices,” commented Michael Bonella, Shareholder and member of the firm’s Board of Directors. “The firm understands both patent prosecution and litigation and we believe being at a general practice commercial law firm will allow us to eventually provide non-IP legal services to our valued and longstanding clients. Flaster’s leadership has been great through our transition and we are excited to hit the ground running.”\n\nBrief biographies for all of our new attorneys follow:\n\nRoss Alexander is a shareholder focusing his practice in patent procurement, trademark procurement and defense, patent licensing, and patent litigation.
