Many of this summer’s blogs are past favorites. May you use them for your own R & R (review and refocus). Hope these R helpful!

Many of this summer’s blogs are past favorites. May you use them for your own R & R (review and refocus). Hope these R helpful! P.S. – What’s a pirate’s […]\n\nRead post »\n\nMoose Hunting Tips and Techniques\n\nMy last few posts drew excerpts and scenarios from the fictional story of Pete Leonard in Moose on the Table: A Novel Approach to Communications @ Work. Pete’s story showed how he avoided, discouraged, and finally encouraged courageous conversations. These difficult discussions identify and address the problems that are reducing a team or organization’s effectiveness. […]\n\nRead post »\n\nWe’re Going to the Zoo, Zoo, Zoo…How About You?\n\nAs I was writing Moose on the Table, I facilitated a retreat at a ranch resort in the foothills of Alberta’s beautiful Rocky Mountains. This was a group of 21 managers and supervisors in a mid-sized family business. They were highly participative and keen to improve their leadership skills and further strengthen their company […]\n\nRead post »\n\nMoose on the Loose: Three Reasons for Using This Symbol of Communication Barriers\n\nDuring a media interview after publishing Moose on the Table: A Novel Approach to Communications @ Work, I was asked if there was any one incident that led me to write the book. Good question. I don’t recall my response. However, since my comebacks usually come back well after the discussion, I later reflected on […]\n\nRead post »\n\nOf Moose and Managers\n\nMy blog, Moose on the Loose: Boeing Panic Over Quality and Safety, explained how I started using the moose-on-the-table metaphor. It also linked to a few excerpts from my only work of fiction, Moose on the Table: A Novel Approach to Communication at Work. The following few excerpts are from Chapter Four: Of Moose […]\n\nRead post »\n\nMoose on the Loose: Boeing Panic Over Quality and Safety\n\nYet another article on the leadership and culture mess at Boeing was recently published in The Guardian. The article reports, “Boeing’s largest factory is in ‘panic mode’…with managers accused of hounding staff to keep quiet over quality concerns. …one mechanic at the complex, who has worked for Boeing for more than three decades, has claimed […]\n\nRead post »\n\nHow Leaders Make or Break Team Effectiveness\n\nAuthoritarian leadership seems to be resurging. The Oxford Review Encyclopedia of Terms gives this definition; “Authoritarian leadership refers to any situation where a leader keeps hold of as much power and authority as possible. Also known as coercive or dictatorial leadership, authoritarian leaders, tend to keep all the decision-making authority to themselves and make […]\n\nRead post »\n\nMaking Teams Work: What’s Your Type and Decision Vision?\n\nIn Working with Emotional Intelligence, Daniel Goleman reports on a study by the Center for Creative Leadership of top American and European leaders whose careers derailed, “the inability to build and lead a team was one of the most common reasons for failure.” He goes on to quote a highly successful Silicon Valley venture capitalist, […]\n\nRead post »\n\nAvoid Being Swamped by the Quitting Tsunami\n\nThe Hays Canada 2024 Salary & Hiring Trends report warns, “Quiet quitting was the dominant theme in 2023, defined as ‘putting in no more time, effort, or enthusiasm than necessary.’ This trend is evident in labor productivity, which has declined nationally in six consecutive quarters. But this quiet quitting trend could be about to turn […]\n\nRead post »\n\nTraining and Development: Top Ten Lessons Learned\n\nI was recently invited to be a guest on a podcast concerning training techniques. That got me reflecting on decades of my journey in this field. Waayyy back in the early days of my career, I was a young door-to-door sales rep and then sales manager with Culligan Water Conditioning. I took Dale Carnegie sales, […]\n\nRead post »\n\nOnly Learning Leaders Can Transform the Extreme Rate of Transformation Failures\n\nAs Yogi Berra would say, “It was Deja vu all over again.” Five years earlier, we’d conducted introductory service/quality improvement workshops for senior management and head office staff of a large company. Culture and feedback surveys gathered input before and during these follow-up workshops. The company clearly had problems with low engagement, faltering customer service, […]\n\nRead post »\n\nUntangling the Accountability, Systems, and Process Management Knot\n\nAccountability is a mess in many organizations. Often good performers are put into bad processes within systems that subvert rather than support them. “The 85/15 Rule” emerged from decades of root cause analysis of service/quality breakdowns. This showed that roughly 85% of the time the failure is caused by the system, processes, structure, or practices […]\n\nRead post »\n\nLip Sync: Does Your Video Match Your Audio?\n\nDoesn’t it drive you nuts to watch a video where the lips don’t quite match the audio track? According to Vocabulary.com, “The verb sync, an abbreviation for “synchronize,” appeared in 1929 to describe the matching of sound and picture in the new ‘talkies.'” Some managers are badly out of sync. For example, a manager once […]\n\nRead post »\n\nWhy Most Change Programs and Improvement Initiatives Fail\n\nI’ve just completed a two-day retreat with a fast-growing leadership team. They scored themselves at the lowest levels we’ve seen on our Team Dynamics Survey. Rarely do we see a leadership team as dysfunctional as this one. Their unique products and growing revenues were papering over many huge cracks and barely holding them together.

His pack gathered around to watch him struggle. “Are you using all your strength?” one of the scouts asked. “Yes!” was the exhausted and exasperated response. “No. You are not using all your strength,” the scout replied. “You haven’t asked us […]\n\nRead post »\n\nWin/Win: Workplace Well-Being Boosts Company-Well Being\n\nHow would you score yourself on these questions: I am happy at work most of the time. My work has a clear sense of purpose. Overall, I am completely satisfied with my job. I feel stressed at work most of the time. How would people on your team or organization answer these questions? These […]\n\nRead post »\n\nReturn to Office Mandates: Destroy Trust, Engagement, and Performance\n\nDecades of psychology experiments show strong links between our sense of control, well-being, and satisfaction. In a classic study by David Glass and Jerome Singer, people were subjected to loud bursts of random noise while they were given difficult puzzles to solve. One group was told they could press a button to shut off […]\n\nRead post »"
