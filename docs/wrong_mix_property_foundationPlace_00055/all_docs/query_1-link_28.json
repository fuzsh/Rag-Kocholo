        "text": "Digital course projects can provide students with opportunities to work collaboratively, explore multiple literacies, write for public audiences, and to effectively present critical, creative, and community-engaged scholarship. Digital project assignments are often offered in addition to more traditional writing assignments and assessments, but can build upon those other activities by allowing students to bring their own backgrounds, interests, and skills into their scholarly work. The development of meaningful digital projects can enhance the sense of belonging to a learning community and provide a departure from the more familiar lecture-study-test routine.\n\nAs with other types of assignments, multimedia assignments should help to further the learning goals of the course. The McGraw Center's Digital Learning & Design group partners with Princeton faculty to develop digital assignments in light of these goals, and to select specific digital tools and software. The McGraw Center's Digital Learning Lab can provide assistance and training to both students and faculty in-class or in the state-of-the-art Digital Learning Lab, a classroom space built specifically to support multimedia and digital course assignments.\n\nThe McGraw Centerâ€™s Digital Learning Lab (DLL) is a technology-rich teaching and learning space in the Lewis Science Library that supports the use of and critical reflection upon digital tools and resources in Princeton coursework. With an experienced staff and community of students, the DLL serves as a flexible space for interdisciplinary dialogues around digital pedagogy, or teaching and learning with technology. The DLL actively supports courses with unconventional formats, innovative course assignments, and/or co-curricular digital learning components, such as podcasting, video production, and other digital projects.\n\nRead more at the DLL website"
