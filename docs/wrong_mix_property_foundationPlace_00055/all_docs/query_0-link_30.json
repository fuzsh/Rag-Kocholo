        "text": "Shoulder\n\nThe shoulder joint is where the upper arm, shoulder blade and collarbone meet. It is a ball-and-socket joint held together by numerous muscles, tendons and ligaments. Impingement, rotator cuff tears and biceps tendon issues are some of the most common shoulder conditions.\n\nNeck\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.\n\nBack\n\nThe back is made of bones called vertebrae and is divided into two sections: the mid back (thoracic spine) and the lower back (lumbar spine). These vertebrae house the spinal cord, which, along with the brain, makes up the central nervous system. Bulging or herniated intervertebral discs and a narrowed spinal canal (stenosis) are common back problems.\n\nElbow\n\nThe elbow is a hinge joint where the upper arm bone called the humerus meets the two forearm bones--the radius and the ulna. A nerve called the ulnar nerve runs through a narrow space in the elbow and creates that electric feeling when the \"funny bone\" is struck. Tennis elbow and golfers elbow--two forms of tendinitis--along with ulnar nerve compression are common causes of elbow pain.\n\nHand & Wrist\n\nThe wrist is more complex than it looks. The wrist joint includes the radius and ulna, as well as eight small bones called carpal bones and numerous ligaments and tendons. Fractures and a nerve compression known as carpal tunnel syndrome are two frequent causes of wrist pain.\n\nHand\n\nThe hands are remarkably dextrous body parts, but their precision comes at the cost of delicacy. Fractures to one or more of the 27 bones that make up the hand, as well as damage to the soft tissue (ligaments and tendons) are common complaints of the hand.\n\nHip\n\nThe hip, a ball-and-socket joint, is surrounded by some of the most powerful muscles in the body (the quadriceps and the gluteus maximus), and one of the hip's component bones, the femur, is the longest and strongest bone in the body. All that strength and power puts tremendous pressure on the hips. Hip osteoarthritis and hip fractures are two of the most common hip conditions.\n\nKnee\n\nThe knee is one of the most often injured joints in the body, and is the most often replaced. A meeting of the femur and the two bones of the lower leg (fibula and tibia), the knee is capped by the patella bone and surrounded by a number of ligaments and tendons. Soft tissue damage like ACL injuries and meniscus tears are frequent causes of knee pain and instability.\n\nFoot & Ankle\n\nThe ankle joint connects the foot with the two lower leg bones, the tibia and the fibula. It also contains numerous ligaments and tendons, the most recognized of which is the Achilles tendon - the body's largest tendon that anchors the calf muscles to the heel bone. Ankle fractures and ligament sprains, as well as strains and tears of the Achilles tendon, are some likely causes of ankle pain."
