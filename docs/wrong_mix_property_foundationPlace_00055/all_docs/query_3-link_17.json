We can say that it is a type of website or blog that is a subset of a website.

Blogs provide information to users where websites provide information as well as some functionality also. The nature of blogs is informal and informative whereas websites are formal and professional.

It’s organized into subject hierarchies, with title, subtitle, and description. It starts when we post a question or comment on the internet as other start to reply to the post which keeps growing as several people answer it. It’s the best way to share our views on any topic according to our interests. Eweka, New hosting, Easynews, Tweaknews, and Giganews are examples of newsgroups. A newsgroup discussion was redistributed through USENET, a WWW (World Wide Web) network of the news discussion groups. It uses the NNTP (Network News Transfer Protocol).\n\nTypes of newsgroups\n\nGenerally, newsgroups are of two types:\n\nModerated Newsgroups: This type of newsgroup is designed to discuss a designated person who decides which postings should be allowed or removed. In this type of group, we can not post directly. Out will be sent to the moderator of the newsgroup for approval. Once it is approved post will be published.\n\nUnmoderated Newsgroups: In this type of newsgroup, everyone is free to post and comment. No one is can remove comments and posts. Our posts do not need approval. It will be published on the newsgroup without a moderator.\n\nHierarchies\n\nNewsgroups are generally arranged in hierarchies so that it is easier to find the related groups. The commonly used hierarchies are known as unset hierarchies. For example, rec.arts.sf.callofduty.games, here, rec.* is the top level hierarchy and asterisk(*) is the wildcard character. The top-level hierarchy is a hierarchy defined by the prefix before the first dot. Some commonly used hierarchies are:\n\ncomp.*:- It represents the discussion of computer-related topics\n\nnews.*:- It represents the discussion of Usenet itself\n\nsci.*:- It represents the discussion of scientific subjects\n\nrec.*:- It represents the discussion of recreational activities (e.g. games and hobbies)\n\nsoc.*:- It represents the socializing and discussion of social issues.\n\ntalk.*:- It represents the discussion of contentious issues such as religion and politics.\n\nmisc.*:- It represents the miscellaneous discussion – anything which does not fit in the other hierarchies.\n\nalt.*:- It represents controversial or unusual topics\n\nbiz.*:- It represents the discussion of business.\n\nHere, comp.*, news.*, sci.*, rec.*, soc.*, talk.*, and misc.* hierarchies are known as Big 7.\n\nBenefits of Newsgroup\n\nSome of the benefits of newsgroups are:\n\nIn newsgroups, people can easily join and leave discussions.\n\nIt generally has a FAQ document.\n\nData of newsgroups are stored on servers.\n\nThe news on the newsgroups are not email-based, so there are no unwanted and redundant emails.\n\nDifference Between Blogs and Newsgroup"
