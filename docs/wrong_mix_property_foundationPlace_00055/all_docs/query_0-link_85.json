        "text": "HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — The Integrated Fires Mission Command Project Office, under Program Executive Office Missiles and Space, received the first complete Integrated Battle Command System delivery as part of the low-rate initial production on April 22, 2024.\n\nIntegrated Battle Command System, or IBCS, is the cornerstone of air and missile defense modernization efforts, providing transformational mission command with increased capabilities to the battlefield faster.\n\n“The completion of this first delivery is the result of unparalleled dedication from amazing professionals. It has been a privilege to lead a team with such a high level of skill and commitment,” said Army Col. Chris Hill, IFMC Project Office project manager. “This accomplishment is an excellent example of what we can achieve when our military, industry partners, government civilians and contractors successfully collaborate on our mission.”\n\nThe Integrated Air and Missile Defense program was among the first Army efforts to enter the DOD agile software pathway process. Agile software development, coupled with warfighter prioritization and hardware development, has enabled faster adaptation to new capabilities and threats, ensuring increased consistency across all aspects of production. The program is at the forefront of the Army’s renewed vision of digital transformation.\n\nIBCS is comprised of three major end items: the Integrated Collaborative Environment, the Engagement Operation Center and the Integrated Fire Control Network Relay. The ICE is a modular shelter that provides a collaborative environment for battlefield mission command. The EOC is an integrated fire control center that provides the engagement operations function for IBCS. The IFCN Relay performs dual functions, providing the interface for the adapted sensors and weapons and serving as a communications relay to extend battlefield operations distances.\n\n“IBCS is the critical mission command component of our Army’s modernized air and missile defense capabilities. It is the cornerstone of our efforts to integrate future components and qualify the architecture within our annual Integrated Fires Test Campaign,” said Army Brig. Gen. Frank Lozano, Program Executive Officer Missiles and Space. “This delivery is the result of excellent work by the entire team focused on modernizing our air and missile defense systems while getting this equipment to our Soldiers as quickly as possible.”\n\nThe IFMC Project Office is helping to modernize the US Army by integration, synchronization and collaboration between all air and missile defense components. Integration efforts leverage legacy and future sensors and shooters, allowing for a single integrated air picture and coordination between fielded assets.\n\nThe fusion between existing joint systems and future developmental programs with IBCS increases overall effectiveness, dramatically enhancing the ability to track, identify, engage and defend against diverse threats. These capabilities not only help modernize the Army’s AMD capabilities, but also the capabilities of our allies across the globe who modernize to the new IBCS architecture.\n\nBy NATHANIEL PIERCE\n\nWith Two Protector RPAs in the UK, GA-ASI Has Delivered a Total of 10 Protectors to RAF;\n\nFirst Four Cadres of RAF Aircrew Complete Training at FTTC\n\nSAN DIEGO – 22 July 2024 – The United Kingdom’s Royal Air Force (RAF) now has two Protector RG Mk1 Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) operating at RAF Waddington. The secondProtector has started its ground trial at RAF Station Waddington with first flight expected in August.Protector is based on the MQ-9B SkyGuardian®RPA developed by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI), and is specially configured for the RAF. The RAF has taken delivery of 10 of their total order of 16 Protectors from GA-ASI, with eight aircraft currently undergoing RAF crew training, test, and evaluation in the United States.\n\n“We’re thrilled to see a second Protector operating at Waddington,” said Chris Dusseault, GA-ASI’s vice president of MQ-9B in Europe. “The Royal Air Force is a great partner for GA-ASI, and we look forward to additional MQ-9B aircraft operating in the U.K. and more broadly across Europe.”\n\nSimon Holford, Uncrewed Air Systems Delivery Team Leader at Defence Equipment & Support, said: “Seeing delivery and assembly of the second Protector aircraft in the UK is yet another measure of the significant progress on this project and testament to the hard work of everyone involved. Together with the three aircraft we have already taken delivery of in the US (which remain in the US for use in trials and/or training), we have now taken delivery of five of the sixteen aircraft we have ordered.”\n\nOfficer Commanding 31 Sqn, Wing Commander Maccoll said, “I’m delighted to see another RAF Protector assembled at RAF Waddington, thanks to the hard work of our Programme team, Defence partners, contractors, and the skill of 31 Squadron personnel. This Summer, Protector will undertake further test and evaluation and we expect more aircraft arrivals before the end of the year. “\n\nIn another program milestone, the first of four cadres of RAF aircrew completed training on April 29, 2024, at GA-ASI’s Flight Test and Training Center (FTTC) in Grand Forks, North Dakota. TheGA-ASI training involved RAF Operational Conversion Units (OCUs), which are comprised of eight crews, including pilots, sensor operators (SOs), and mission intelligence coordinators (MICs) from 31, 54, or 56 Squadrons.\n\nThe scope of the training is focused on foundational skills required to operate the Protector air vehicle and its equipment, including the Multi-Spectral Targeting System (MTS), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Mission Intelligence Station (MIS), and System for Tasking and Real-Time Exploitation (STARE). Training involves building solid foundations for both normal and emergency operations in Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems, instrument flying, and Automatic Takeoff and Landing Capability (ATLC).\n\nWith the completion of the Protector Technicians course at GA-ASI facilities in Southern California on May 16, 2024, Number 31 Squadron now has another 21 qualified maintainers. As part of their training course, the RAF maintainers were able to directly support the training flights for their aircrew counterparts who were completing the live flying element of their Operational Conversion course from North Dakota.\n\nMQ-9B is GA-ASI’s next-generation RPA System (RPAS), delivering exceptionally long endurance and range, with auto takeoff and landing under SATCOM-only control, and will be able to operate in unsegregated airspace using the GA-ASI-developed Detect and Avoid system. In addition to the RAF, contracts have been signed with Belgium, Canada, Taiwan and the U.S. Air Force in support of the Special Operations Command. The Japan Coast Guard is currently operating the MQ-9B for maritime operations, which the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) also selected for its Medium-Altitude, Long-Endurance (MALE) Remotely Piloted Aircraft System Trial Operation Project. MQ-9B has additionally supported various U.S. Navy exercises, including Northern Edge, Integrated Battle Problem, and Group Sail.\n\nHayesville Ohio, USA – [July 2024] – In light of recent news regarding Vista Outdoor’s ammunition division facing potential sale and shareholder uncertainties, HOP Munitions, a trusted U.S.-based ammunition manufacturer, is stepping up to provide American shooters with a reliable and high-quality alternative.\n\nVista Outdoor’s Market Challenges\n\nVista Outdoor, a leading ammunition supplier, is experiencing significant challenges that have led to concerns among shareholders and consumers.

High-Quality Products: HOP Munitions prides itself on producing ammunition that meets stringent quality standards, providing shooters with reliable performance for various applications.\n\n? Domestic Production: By manufacturing ammunition within the U.S., HOP Munitions reduces dependency on foreign suppliers, offering a more secure and stable supply chain.\n\nNavigating the Gun Powder Shortage\n\nThe ammunition industry has also faced a gun powder shortage, affecting many manufacturers. HOP Munitions has navigated this challenge by diversifying suppliers and optimizing production processes, ensuring continued supply even when others face delays.\n\nTransparency and Communication\n\nHOP Munitions values transparency and has kept customers informed throughout the gun powder shortage, building trust and loyalty. This commitment to clear communication further distinguishes HOP Munitions as a reliable partner for American shooters.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force Offensive small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) System Program Office (SPO) has issued a Request for Information to Industry to conduct market research to determine Industry’s ability to provide capabilities supporting the Air Force Special Operations Command’s (AFSOC) Adaptive Airborne Enterprise (A2E) concept within 24 – 36 months.\n\nWhat they are after is a Group 3 sUAS capable of internally carrying and deploying Group 2 sUAS equipped with an Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) payload. Essentially, a drone capable of being launched from a C-130 which carries and deploys a swarm of even smaller drones.\n\nThis is one of three distinct RFIs to be issued that will cover the sUAS platform needs for fielding Adaptive Airborne Enterprise (A2E) capabilities within 24 – 36 months of this RFI.\n\nThe SPO intends to release three distinct RFIs, each covering a specific A2E sUAS capability, detailed below. The SPO is seeking Industry responses to help inform how it can provide AFSOC with air-launched sUAS capabilities that integrate Group 2 Air-Launched ISR systems, Group 3 Air-Launched Swarm Carrier systems, and Group 3 Air-Launched Signature Managed systems within the A2E architecture (see Appendix A, Figure 1) while complying with a Modular Open System Approach (MOSA). Specifically, the SPO will be seeking responses for each of the three capabilities below via three separate and distinct RFIs:\n\n• Group 2 ISR – To be internally carried and air-launched via Common Launch Tube (CLT) from a Group 3 Swarm Carrier.\n\n• Group 3 Swarm Carrier – To be deployed from a C-130 as an air-dropped, palletized effect, internally carrying and able to launch Group 2 ISR sUAS from CLTs.\n\n• Group 3 Signature Managed – To be air-launched from a Group 5 system, act as a C2 node in a network/swarm of sUAS and send data from the contested/denied environment to the Joint Force.\n\nSolutions must align with MOSA design principles and be cost-effective for the government. They must also be compatible with an Autonomous Government Referenced Architecture and the software chosen to support that architecture. Finally, solutions must demonstrate a maturity level and production capacity that confidently conveys the ability to deliver scalable quantity within 36 months.\n\nRFI responses are due no later than (NLT) 1700 EST (sic) on August 09, 2024.\n\nRead the details at sam.gov."
