A new, expanded Branch opened in the municipal center in November 1983. However, rapid population growth and corresponding increase in library use quickly rendered that building inadequate and in August 1997, the Branch moved to its current 23,000 square foot building. The bright and inviting new library is equipped with state of the art technology and comfortable furnishings to support research, quiet study and children’s activities.\n\nDistinctive Aspects of the Collection\n\nIn keeping with our mission to provide materials and services that satisfy the educational, informational, recreational and cultural needs of our diverse community, our Children’s Department, brightened by Ilya Spirin’s colorful “Rain Forest Mural”, houses the largest juvenile book collection in the system, and our International Children’s Book Collection, which encompasses 16 languages. The Chinese Language Collection has nearly 3000 books; the Branch subscribes to several Chinese and Indian newspapers and periodicals, and our rapidly expanding DVD collection includes hundreds of Hindi and Chinese films.\n\nDisplays\n\nGallery space can be reserved for one month at a time for art exhibits or displays; three display cases (locked) can be reserved-also monthly-to display collectibles. (For further information, please contact the Branch manager.)\n\nLibrary Hours\n\nAll Branches, Except Hollowbrook\n\nMonday — Thursday: 9:30 AM — 8:30 PM\n\nFriday & Saturday: 9:30 AM — 5:00 PM\n\nThe Hollowbrook Branch\n\nMonday — Friday: 9:00 AM — 5:00 PM\n\nSundays During the School Year\n\nThe Ewing, Hickory Corner, Lawrence, and West Windsor Branches are open 12:30 PM to 5:00 PM."
