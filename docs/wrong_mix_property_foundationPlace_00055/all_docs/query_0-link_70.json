Adoption and deployment of a technology requires support from researchers who envision and create it, vendors who produce it, and users who install and use it. Bringing these groups and their activities together requires extensive coordination. This is especially true for technology that spans countries, continents, and different engineering cultures. Standards supported by international organizations fulfill that role. This panel discusses the current standards produced and supported by IEEE and IEC that address Synchrophasor Measurement Systems regarding measurement, communication, and some aspects of processing these measurements. The panel also discusses potential evolutions of these standards with respect to the evolving needs of the power grid.\n\nTitle: Introduction of session and IEC/IEEE 60255-118-1, Standard for PMU measurements\n\nKenneth Martin is a principal engineer with the Electric Power Group (EPG).

From one perspective, the nature of physical processes determining the behavior of the system of future is becoming different. For example, both the system fault level and inertia are not only reduced, but also becoming variable in time. From another perspective, the security and dependability of the existing SIPSs starts becoming a challenge. Beyond all that, a need for design of new type of SIPSs is becoming obvious, particularly in line of intensive interactions between e.g. inverter control and the rest of the AC system. Severe requirements for resilient operation of the system is causing a need for scrutinizing the existing SIPSs and design of new schemes capable of coping with severe weather conditions. The panel will explore the opportunities for merging aspects of monitoring, protection and control into resilient SIPSs. We will explore to which extent synchronized measurement technology (SMT) based on PMUs and point of wave-supported applications can contribute to security and dependability of modern SIPSs. We are also ambitious to discuss the nature of cascading events leading to power system blackouts and to demonstrate few representative SIPSs in which benefits and limitations of SMT will be discussed. Considering the use of communication infrastructure, cyber security aspects will be discussed, too. Experience from large-scale UK, EU and USA projects will be used to support understanding of discussed new smart SIPS solutions.\n\nDr. Vladimir Terzija (M’95–SM’00–F’16) was born in Donji Baraci (former Yugoslavia).
