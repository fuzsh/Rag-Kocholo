Is that a good thing?\n\nJune 19, 2024\n\nThe real 10x developer makes their whole team better\n\nSingle individuals make less of a difference to the success or failure of a technology project than you might think (and that’s a good thing).\n\nMay 29, 2024\n\nDevelopers get by with a little help from AI: Stack Overflow Knows code assistant pulse survey results\n\nWe asked when and how often CodeGen tools fall short, what challenges developers face with these tools, and what they are doing with all of the free time these tools purport to offer.\n\nMay 22, 2024\n\nYou should keep a developer’s journal\n\nA developer’s journal is a place to define the problem you’re solving and record what you tried and what worked.\n\nMay 20, 2024\n\nThe Good, the Bad, and the Disruptive: Let us know where you stand in the 2024 Annual Developer Survey\n\nThis year we are asking familiar questions about your experience, but also have some new questions about what embedded programming technology you are using and what AI ethical responsibilities are most important to you.\n\nMay 14, 2024\n\nOverflowAI is now Generally Available! A new era of community-driven AI\n\nWe're excited to announce the general availability of OverflowAI to Stack Overflow for Teams! OverflowAI represents a big step forward in our vision of integrating GenAI offerings within knowledge communities.\n\nMay 1, 2024\n\nUpcoming research at Stack Overflow\n\nAll about the research that the User Experience team will be focused on over the next quarter and how you can help."
