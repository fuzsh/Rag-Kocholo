        "text": "The final day of Seatrade Cruise Global just came to an end. This is typically a very light day on both news and attendance. It’s not surprising to hear packing tape at around noon in some of the quieter areas *caugh* third floor *caugh*.\n\nEven though it’s the last day, there still was some news from the show floor.\n\nDisney Cruise Line released a render of their 2021 newbuild. She’ll fit right in with her fleetmates.\n\nGenting Group has announced that their 204,000gt newbuilds will instead be built for their Dream Cruises. The first ships will come out in 2020.\n\nVolga Shipping Company’s Russian river cruise brand, Vodohod, announced that they will build a new ship that will be launched next year. The ship will carry just under 350-pax. The river ships in Russia tend to be a bit larger than their central European counterparts as the seaways up there have less restrictions. It’ll be built by USC in St Petersburg.\n\nViking Ocean Cruises fourth ship, Viking Sun, was formally named in Shanghai today.\n\nOne final note…..\n\nI’m not 100% sure whether or not I’ll be back but I’ll still cover the event remotely."
