        "text": "Finnish shipbuilding company\n\nThis article is about a shipbuilding company. For shipyards located in Helsinki, see Helsinki shipyard.\n\nHelsinki Shipyard (officially DNY Finland Oy) is a Finnish shipbuilding company based at Hietalahti shipyard in Helsinki, Finland.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nHelsinki Shipyard was established in May 2019 to take over the shipbuilding activities of Arctech Helsinki Shipyard at Hietalahti shipyard in downtown Helsinki.[3][4] The company had become an economic burden for its Russian owners after the European Union and the United States imposed economic sanctions on the shipyard's Russian state-owned parent company, United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC), as a response to the Russian involvement in the unrest in Ukraine. In early 2018, it was reported that USC was looking for a new majority owner for Arctech Helsinki Shipyard which was making heavy cumulative losses and had been unable to attract new orders since 2016.[5] In April 2019, the Russian government finally authorized the sale of the shipyard.[6][7]\n\nThe sale of the shipbuilding operations in Finland was announced on 15 May 2019. In preparation of the transaction, a new shipbuilding company Helsinki Shipyard would be established to take over the assets and operations of Arctech Helsinki Shipyard at Hietalahti Shipyard. It would then be sold to Algador Holdings, a private Russian company owned by Rishat Bagautdinov ja Vladimir Kasyanenko while Arctech would remain as a subsidiary of the United Shipbuilding Corporation and continue shipbuilding operations in Russia as a shareholder of the Saint Petersburg-based Nevsky Shipyard. Victor Olerskiy, the former deputy Russian transport minister and the former head of Federal Agency of Maritime and River Transportation, was appointed as the chairman of the board of the new company.[3][4]\n\nFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the shipyard's future became uncertain even though neither the Finnish company itself nor its Russian owners were targeted by the new international sanctions against Russia. According to the Mayor of Helsinki, Juhana Vartiainen, the city would have to re-evaluate the long-term land-lease agreement for the Hietalahti shipyard, located in central Helsinki, due to the changed geopolitical situation.[8]\n\nIn March 2023, Helsinki Shipyard announced that the Quebec-based shipbuilder Chantier Davie Canada, part of the Inocea Group, had exercised an exclusive option for the potential purchase the Finnish shipyard's assets. The negotiations had reportedly begun already in December 2022.[9][10] The conditional business purchase agreement, subject to approval of the authorities and fulfillment of the terms of the agreement, was signed in April 2023.[11] In June 2023, the City of Helsinki agreed to extend the land lease agreement for the shipyard site by 50 years until 2073.[12] The acquisition was completed on 3 November 2023.[13][14] Although the shipyard will continue using Helsinki Shipyard as the brand name, the legal name of the new company is DNY Finland Oy.[2][15]\n\nOrders\n\n[edit]\n\nShortly after the change of ownership, the new owners hinted that the first shipbuilding order for the new company would be announced within a month from its founding.[16]\n\nIn late May 2019, Hufvudstadsbladet reported that the shipyard had signed a letter of intent for the construction of two 150-to-160-passenger Polar Class 5 expedition cruise ships to an undisclosed buyer.[17] On 27 June, the shipyard confirmed an order for two 113-metre (371 ft) expedition cruise ships with capacity of 157 passengers under the name \"Project Vega\". While Kommersant initially reported that the ships would be built for Vodohod, a Russian shipping company owned by the same people who acquired the Helsinki shipyard,[18] in 2020 it was revealed that the vessels would be operated by the revived British cruise line Swan Hellenic.[19] Steel block production began at Western Baltija Shipbuilding in KlaipÄ—da, Lithuania, on 27 April 2020 and hull assembly of the first vessel, SH Minerva, began with keel laying in Helsinki on 24 September 2020.[20] This was followed by launching on 23 June 2021[21] and delivery of the vessel in late November of the same year.[22] The keel of the second vessel, SH Vega, was laid on 4 February 2021[23] and the vessel was floated out in February 2022.[24] The vessel was delivered in July 2022 following a naming ceremony at the shipyard.[25]\n\nOn 20 October 2020, Finnish media reported that Helsinki Shipyard was about to sign a shipbuilding contract for a third expedition cruise ship for Swan Hellenic.[26][27] On the following day, the shipyard confirmed a 150 million euro order for a Polar Class 6 luxury cruise ship with a capacity of 196 passengers in 96 cabins. The production of the ship began with steel cutting at CRIST in Poland on 10 June 2021[28] and the keel was laid in Helsinki on 8 April 2022.[29] The 125-metre (410 ft) SH Diana, slightly larger than its two predecessors, was floated out from the shipyard's covered dry dock in January 2023 and, after completing sea trials, was delivered on 31 March.[30]\n\nOn 18 January 2022, Helsinki Shipyard announced that it had received an order for a large LNG-powered icebreaker from Norilsk Nickel in late 2021. The construction of the largest and most powerful diesel-electric icebreaker ever built in Finland was planned to begin in 2022 with delivery slated for late 2024.[31] In February 2022, the project was put on hold due to international sanctions following Russia's invasion to Ukraine.[32] On 30 September 2022, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs refused to grant an export license for the vessel.[33]\n\nList of ships\n\n[edit]\n\nShip name Year Type Yard number IMO number Status Notes Image Ref SH Minerva 2021 Cruise ship 516 9895240 In service [20][34] SH Vega 2022 Cruise ship 517 9895252 In service Sister ship to SH Minerva [23][35] SH Diana 2023 Cruise ship 518 9921740 In service [30][36] 2024 (planned) Icebreaker 519 9957804 Cancelled[33] [31][37]"
