They are small ships, with a limited number of passengers but with all the comforts and services of the large cruise ships. Traveling on rivers makes it possible to see many cities in a short amount of time, enjoying the beauty of landscapes and relaxing the entire time while watching the places float by our eyes. Today river cruises are widespread throughout the world. From lots of European itineraries to Russia, the Nile and Vietnam, but also on the rivers of South America, United State and North America. Wherever you want to go, there are marvelous itineraries to discover places and cultures while slowly navigating the beautiful waterways."
