        "text": "From the depths of the Amazon to splendours on the Nile, Sara Macefield selects 30 great river cruises for the months ahead. Get ready to set sail.\n\n1. Danube’s capital attractions\n\nIf you like ticking off European cities, this voyage serves them up in style with a triumvirate of capitals. Budapest sets the bar high, with the illuminated splendour of its Gothic parliament building providing the ultimate night-time vista, while Slovakian capital Bratislava charms with a medieval old town of winding streets and Baroque palaces. Vienna exudes classical splendour at every turn, with grandiose imperial piles and rich musical heritage. Channel your inner Mozart at an exclusive recital before tucking into one of the city’s pastries.\n\nSeven-night cruise, Budapest to Munich, from £2,095pp. Departs Sept 6 (0808 231 5028; emeraldwaterways.co.uk).\n\nThe best hotels in Budapest\n\n2. Cycle through Assam\n\nLittle compares with the thrill of cycling under the shadow of the Himalayas on a biking/boating cruise along India’s Brahmaputra River through the state of Assam. Ride dusty tracks into villages, through tea plantations and across paddy fields – unforgettable highlights of this Grasshopper Adventures trip. It begins in Jorhat, where guests join the Charaidew riverboat to cruise to Guwahati, and along the way are temple visits, cultural displays and the chance to spot tigers and rare one-horned rhinos at wildlife reserves.\n\nSeven-night Bike & Boat Brahmaputra trips cost from £2,950pp, departing on Nov 20 and Dec 21 (0808 1890991; https://www. grasshopperadventures.com/)\n\n3. Dutch bulbfields\n\nWhat a blooming marvellous way to welcome spring – albeit spring 2022 due to current restrictions. Feast your eyes on mesmerising displays of millions of tulips, hyacinths and daffodils as they burst into colourful life. This is flower power at its finest, and the hub of this vivid spectacle is Holland’s Keukenhof Gardens, a must-see on cruises along the waterways of the Low Countries during springtime. Crystal River Cruises’ seven-night voyage combines an obligatory stop here with the Unesco-protected 18th-century windmills at Kinderdijk and the modern cityscape of Rotterdam, plus cheese tastings, bike tours and waffle treats.\n\nRound-trip Tulips & Windmills cruise from Amsterdam departs April 2, 2022. From £3,290pp (020 7399 7601; crystalcruises.co.uk).\n\n4. Cruises to spot Nessie\n\nMysteries of monsters, craggy stone castles and bloodthirsty battles loom large on six-night sailings through the Scottish Highlands with European Waterways. Groups of up to 12 can charter barges to take them in tartan-clad comfort along the Caledonian Canal to Loch Ness, cosseted by the resident crew. En route, they can follow in the footsteps of Bonnie Prince Charlie, famously defeated by English troops at Culloden, and relive the spirit of Shakespeare’s tragic hero Macbeth, forever linked to Cawdor Castle.\n\nThe Scottish Classic Cruise departs between May and October. From £24,500 for eight passengers aboard Scottish Highlander; £3,190pp (01753 598555; europeanwaterways.com).\n\n5. Festive celebrations in Seville\n\nCelebrate the new year in style by catching the sultry spirit of flamenco in its passionate Spanish heartlands along the Guadalquivir and Guadiana rivers. This five-night Croisi-Europe cruise moors overnight in Seville on Dec 31, giving passengers a chance to enjoy the city’s festivities before a five-course celebratory dinner on-board. Stops at Cadiz and Jerez uncover the centuries-old Moorish heritage of grand palaces and graceful cathedrals lining the cobbled streets.\n\nAndalucian New Year cruise aboard La Belle de Cadix departs on Dec 28. From £1,153pp (020 8328 1281; croisieurope.co.uk).\n\nThe best hotels in Seville\n\n6. Discover the Siberian wilderness\n\nRussia’s Yenisei River carries ultimate bragging rights for river cruisers. The little-known waterway through Siberia is the fifth-longest in the world and uncovers a region of forest tundra and Arctic desert, Cossack tribes and remote settlements. Russian river cruise company Vodohod claims to be the first and only line to specialise in Yenisei sailings. Stops include the village of Bakhta, which can only be reached by boat or helicopter, and the town of Igarka, built on permafrost and bathed in the midnight sun each summer, while Yermakovo is the location of the “Death Road’’ unfinished railway, which claimed the lives of 300,000 gulag prisoners under Stalin.\n\n10-night cruises between Krasnoyarsk and Dudinka (reached by flights via Moscow) cost from £6,750pp, departing on Sep 3 (0800 029 1600; vodohod-cruises.com).\n\n7. Egyptian wonders\n\nEvoke the spirit of the golden age of Nile cruising aboard a style of boat favoured by the aristocracy at the turn of the 19th century. The Merit Dahabiya, an elegant twin-masted wooden sailing vessel, takes 16 passengers in cosy house party-style on leisurely five-night sailings between Luxor and Aswan. Passengers can visit ancient sites including Abu Simbel, Edfu and the Valley of the Kings. The cruises are part of a 10-night package that also includes three nights in Cairo and two nights in Luxor.\n\nYear-round departures; from £1,995pp on Sept 9 (020 3583 6089; corinthiantravel.co.uk).\n\n8. Danube passion play\n\nThe Bavarian town of Oberammergau is famed for its Passion Play, usually staged every decade in a tradition dating from 1633, when residents vowed to tell the story of Christ’s death and resurrection if God spared them the worst of the Black Death ravaging Europe. Last summer’s 42nd re-enactment fell victim to the modern plague of Covid-19, but it has been rearranged for 2022. It will run from May to October, with performances featured by Viking on selected Danube sailings.\n\nNine-night packages, including a night each in Munich and Oberammergau and the seven-night sailing from Regensburg to Budapest, from £3,695pp. Flights included (0800 3196660; vikingrivercruises.co.uk).\n\n9. Amazon adventures\n\nPink river dolphins, sleepy sloths and bright-billed toucans are Amazonian residents that can be spotted along the Peruvian stretch of this South American artery. This section of the Amazon is only navigable by smaller boats, including the 28-passenger Amatista Amazon, which explores tributaries and black-water lakes. Passengers can join excursions led by naturalists on small skiffs deep into the jungle on night-time forays, while stops at riverside villages bring interactions with indigenous families and a visit to the local shaman.\n\nAn eight-night package, including two nights in Lima, from £1,614pp, departs June 12 (020 7313 6936; gadventures.com).\n\nThe best hotels in Peru\n\n10.

Not surprisingly, Prague features heavily in this one-week round-trip cruise from the city along the Elbe and Vltava rivers, which is part of Cosmos’s new river cruise programme. But cycle tours also take riders to Baroque imperial towns, craggy castles and through the jagged volcanic peaks of the “Bohemian Gate” valley.\n\nFrom £754pp, departing June 18 (0330 0588237; cosmos.co.uk).\n\n11. Vietnam culture call\n\nLegend has it that the 1,500 limestone karsts scattered like precious gems across Halong Bay evolved from emeralds that fell from the mouths of raging dragons as they battled invaders. Pandaw sailings along Vietnam’s “Red River” combine the ethereal surroundings of this Unesco-protected seascape with the French accented ambience of Hanoi and lush inland environs of paddy fields, pagodas and tribal settlements.\n\nSailings are between Halong Bay and Hoa Binh, both of which are near Hanoi, and run virtually year-round. A Nov 22 departure costs from £2,730pp (0800 988 3369; pandaw.com).\n\n12. Cruise control to Bordeaux\n\nUniworld’s self-drive options for cruises along France’s rivers are just the ticket for anyone wanting to avoid airports and steer their own way to sailings along the Seine, Rhone or waterways of Bordeaux via ferry or Eurotunnel.

Days start with early-morning game drives followed by small boat excursions enabling passengers to get even closer to the animals, while one of the natural wonders of this trip are the spectacular Victoria Falls, where guests can sail away on a sundowner cruise.\n\nThe four-night sailing is part of a nine-night Discover Africa tour, with three nights in Cape Town and two nights at Victoria Falls. From £9,032pp; departs Nov 5 (0800 9883369; fredholidays.co.uk).\n\n14. Yangtze spectacle\n\nPull back the bamboo curtain to discover some of China’s most awe-inspiring landscapes on a three-night Yangtze River sailing through the deep canyons and sheer cliffs of the Three Gorges and Three Gorges Dam. The cruise is part of an 18-day tour that showcases the ancient attractions of Beijing’s Forbidden City and Great Wall with the Terracotta Army at Xi’an and neon metropolis of Shanghai. An endearing highlight is a chance to see baby pandas at the Chengdu Panda Breeding Institute.\n\nThe Grand China tour from £3,599pp including flights; departs April 7 2022 (0808 250 0759; titantravel.co.uk).\n\n15.

From £1,995pp including flights, (01858 435655; arenarivercruises.co.uk)\n\n18. America’s historic heartlands\n\nThere’s nothing like the churning paddle wheel of a traditional steamboat to conjure up images of retro Americana along the waters of the Mississippi. Discover America’s Southern States in grand style aboard Queen of the Mississippi between New Orleans and St Louis.

Between them lie waterways, rivers and lakes that open up the country’s hinterland, where towns and cities such as Uglich and Yaroslavl have their own historic claims to fame. But the undoubted stars are St Petersburg’s grandiose palaces and Hermitage Museum, along with Moscow’s Red Square, dominated by the Kremlin and candy-coloured swirls of St Basil’s Cathedral\n\nThe 11-night Russian Odyssey departs on July 18, from £2,399pp with flights included (01283 742300; rivieratravel.co.uk).\n\n29. Exploring America’s Northwest\n\nPioneering spirit is at the forefront as this cruise delves into America’s Northwest, following the route taken by explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark more than 200 years ago. American Queen Steamboat Company sailings along the Snake and Columbia rivers are all the more evocative thanks to the American Empress paddle steamer that ploughs the waters between Portland, Oregon, and Clarkston, Washington. Expect awe-inspiring views of snow-topped mountains, desert plains and the spectacular Hells Canyon river gorge, best enjoyed with a tipple from one of the local wineries.\n\nNine-night package, departing Nov 7 and including an overnight stay in Spokane pre-cruise and the seven-night voyage from Clarkston, from £2,940pp including flights (01223 568904; lightbluetravel.co.uk).\n\n30. Festive treats in Cologne\n\nFill your festive boots with Christmas cheer on a cruise along the Rhine and Main rivers, where towns transform into winter wonderlands. This five-night sailing with Tui River Cruises, marking its winter maiden season, is full of yuletide spirit as it sails to the seasonal markets of Düsseldorf and Koblenz selling homespun decorations and rustic crafts. But it’s the cathedral city of Cologne and quaint town of Rüdesheim, whose streets and squares twinkle with fairy lights and wooden stalls packed with goodies, which seal a magical escape.\n\nMistletoe & Rhine cruise from Frankfurt, departing on Nov 23, from £790pp including flights (0800 9754477; tui.co.uk).\n\nTravel within the UK and overseas is currently subject to restrictions."
