        "text": "Sitronics Group 11 August 2023 15:17\n\nThe new type of transport of the Vodohod company is in demand in Krasnoyarsk and Nizhny Novgorod. Electric catamarans were built in the Leningrad region at the Imperium shipyard (part of the Sitronics Group).\n\nYenisei was the first to meet new technologies this season. Since June 9, JSC \"Vodohod. Passenger Port\" has launched a two-deck passenger catamaran powered by an electric motor \"Ekohod\". The first ecoâ€”friendly electric-powered vessel in Russia carries out daily passenger transportation on the route Krasnoyarsk - Divnogorsk and sightseeing and pleasure flights in the waters of Krasnoyarsk. In three months, Ecohod carried out more than 170 flights, transported 9,769 passengers, and more than 10 corporate events took place on board.\n\nUnlike diesel analogues, the economical Ecohod practically does not create noise and vibrations when driving, has zero carbon dioxide emissions, there is no smell of recycled fuel on board, which provides passengers with a completely new level of comfort, and also preserves the balance of the river ecosystem.\n\nIn Nizhny Novgorod (operator of Vodohod LLC) to four vessels of the Moscow class/Neva, which carries out walks along the Volga and Oka, has added a new passenger catamaran powered by an electric motor, Ekohod 2, which has completed 178 flights since June 16. The new type of transport is in great demand among Nizhny Novgorod residents and guests of the region. River trips on an eco-friendly vessel have already been appreciated by 14 thousand people. Ecohod 2 carries out up to 6 excursion and pleasure flights daily lasting from 1.5 to 3 hours. There is a guide on board, there are flights with children's animation and a music program. During a walk on the Ecohod 2, tourists can order a light lunch at the bar, take pictures in the stylish interior of the open deck, and, most importantly, enjoy the picturesque views of the historical center of Nizhny Novgorod and Strelka with a new level of comfort, without noise and vibrations.\n\n\"It is pleasant that the innovative vessels with electric propulsion produced by us have proved to be in demand not only in Moscow, but in other cities of the country. They are comfortable, economical in maintenance and are best suited for the development of river tourism and urban river transport,\" said Andrey Gurlenov, CEO of Sitronics Electro.\n\nThe Emperium shipyard was the first in Russia to launch mass production of electric vessels. The company develops and builds vessels of different navigation classes with a capacity of 50 to 200 passengers on board. There are several types of vessels in the line: Ecobus river trams, single-deck and double-deck Ecovolt and Ecocruiser cruises, two more new models are being developed.\n\nPlease note that this press release is based on materials provided by the company.
