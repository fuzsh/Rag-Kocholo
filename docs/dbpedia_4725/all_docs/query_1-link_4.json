Here you'll also find concise info on the largest Russian cruise companies, including Vodohod, Mosturflot, Infoflot, Doninturflot-Orthodox, Imperial River Cruises Russia.\n\nIn the \"Fleet\" section you will find an extensive list or Russian cruise ships. By following each ship link you will find the ship's review, deck plans, scheduled itineraries and cruise pricing information. Live ship tracking is also provided on a digital map. It shows the vessel's current location, cruising speed and course.\n\nIn the \"Itinerary\" section you will find maps and day-by-day scheduled activities planned by Europe's largest cruise companies, also operating in Russia via chartered riverboats.\n\nVolga River Cruises in Russia\n\nVolga river cruising in Russia places you in another time. The longest and largest river in Europe stretches from Ivan the Terrible to Catherine the Great. Today, live along the central artery of Russia looks like it always has - the villages, the churches, the people, just like an old painting you have seen in a gallery.\n\nThe Volga flows through central Russia into the Caspian Sea and is often called the national river of Russia. 11 of the 20 largest cities of the country, including the capital Moscow, are in Volga's watershed. Some of the world's largest reservoirs can be found along the river, which has a symbolic meaning in Russian culture, referred to as Mother Volga (Volga Matushka) in Russian folklore and literature.\n\nExplore the land of the Tsars while sailing down the historic Volga river, typically between Moscow and St Petersburg, the traditional homeports (of embarkation and debarkation). Tour landmarks are the Red Square and Kremlin in Moscow, the Hermitage and Catherine Palace in St Petersburg.\n\nOnce unthinkable as a cruise vacation destination, Russia is today more accessible than ever, with stops along its largest European lakes and rivers. For river travel lovers accustomed to European itineraries, the Russian experience will be quite different. Russia has a special feel of uniquely designed riverboats. Built to handle larger lakes (Lake Ladoga for example, is the largest European freshwater body of water), these vessels usually feature larger size and capacity (up to six decks), deeper draft, and most of them are refurbished instead of being newbuild.\n\nThe itineraries offered are activity-intensive in Moscow and St Petersburg, with long periods of cruising and less ashore time in the middle. Smaller \"Golden Ring\" cities (so named due to their historic significance) are full of icon-riddled monasteries and Orthodox churches. Most cruise lines hire local experts and fill the days of sailing along the river with lectures on country's history, cooking demonstrations and language lessons.\n\nMost of the tours offered by the companies sailing along Volga River are identical, so customers choosing between the different itineraries should look at how the river ships spend the time within Moscow and St. Petersburg. Some lines have their guests stay onboard, which can be as far as 1 hour out of both cities. Others put their clients up at hotels near the center of the city, with several meals at customer's expense.\n\nCompared with other river routes, Russia features a short season, between early May and late October, with high season in June (known as White Nights because of the endless daylight), July and August. Even if the weather is chilly, there are some advantages to sailing early or late: you'll beat the crowds which can make a visit to the Hermitage a bear. Most Russian museums lack air-conditioning, and while the climate is generally temperate, in the summer Moscow often experiences high humidity heat waves.\n\nRemember to think about your Russian visa at least 2 months before your voyage, to have enough time to fill out the paperwork, including a lengthy online application. And don't forget that the Russian language uses the Cyrillic alphabet. Even in the cities, you'll rarely find signs in English, so learning some letters and a few phrases will help you get around.\n\nList of largest Russian river cruise companies\n\nVodohod\n\nVodohod (\"ВодоходЪ\", 2004-founded) is Russia's largest river cruise line, and a fully-owned subsidiary of \"Volga Shipping Company\".

All these vessels were built during the USSR (Soviet Union) times, roughly in the period between 1950-1990. Depending on class and series, these boats differ in terms of size, equipment (different engine designs), passenger capacity, onboard facilities and venues, cabins (types and number). Amenities additionally differ by shipowner (cruise company).\n\nAll these old-design Russian ships were completely refurbished and rebuilt for their new shipowners, Some of these ships are operated (via partnerships or under charter) also by foreign companies (like Viking, CroisiEurope, Uniworld, AMAwaterways, Grand Circle, Nicko). During their multi-million-dollar drydock refits, vessels passenger capacities were considerably reduced to improve travel comfort and safety.\n\nMost boats are of the following classes:\n\n\"Rossiya\" (Project 785, 36 vessels built 1952-1958)\n\n\"Baykal\" (Project 646, 15 units built 1953-1956)\n\n\"Rodina\" (Project 588, 49 vessels built 1954-1961)\n\n\"Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya\" (Project 26-37, 14 units built 1957-1962)\n\n\"Dunay\" (Project 305, 47 vessels built between 1959-1964)\n\n\"Kuybyshev\" (Project OL400, 9 units built 1975-1983)\n\n\"Vladimir Ilyich\" (Project 301, 22 vessels built between 1975-1983)\n\n\"Dmitri Furmanov\" (Project 302, 27 vessels built between 1983-1991)\n\nRegardless of their age, all these motor ships undergo regular drydock refurbishments, machinery and safety checks, scheduled repairs (including annual surveys). Drydocks are every 5 years and include repairs, hull inspection, propulsion-steering inspection, general maintenance works.\n\nEach ship is equipped with life-saving appliances (lifeboats and rafts) in amounts exceeding the boat's max passenger and crew capacity. Each cabin is equipped with lifejackets with illustrated instructions in several languages. All ships are equipped with modern fire-fighting systems. Crew and staff are experienced and highly professional certified employees.\n\nNew Russian cruise ships\n\nIn August 2016, at Lotus Shipyard (Astrakhan Russia) part of USC (United Shipbuilding Company) started the construction of the first Russian passenger ship after the USSR times. Support for the new PV300-class cruiser came from Russian Federation's President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Marine Engineering Bureau office engineers developed the PV300VD cruise ship design, the first of which was completed/launched in 2019 (Pyotr Velikiy/Пётр Великий). The project belongs to Saint Petersburg team of Marine Engineering Bureau SPb, working in Russia since the year 2000. Its other branch is in Odessa Ukraine.\n\nThe first USSR-built river cruise ships (MS Soviet Union, and MS Lenin) were constructed at Gorky Plant in 1959-1960. As with its ocean ships, the Soviet Union bought foreign-built riverboats - until 1989-1990. However, these were not entirely foreign as they were created to order and developed for operation in Russian conditions only (seasonal navigation on large/wide rivers and lakes). These vessels were built mainly in Austria, East Germany, and Czechoslovakia. After 1990, Russian riverboats were no longer ordered and the business was carried on for years utilizing old tonnage. The same happened with the Russian passenger fleet as the ships were banned in North America after Russia's invasion in Afghanistan (1979-1989).\n\nRussia's new passenger ships are planned to be \"river-sea\" cruisers. The PV300 class was specifically developed for waterways with max waves 3 m (inland seas and large lakes). The new Russian cruisers are much more powerful than the typical Danube and Rhine deployed riverboats. Dimensions for the new 310-passenger ships are 141x17 m (463x56 ft). The PV300VD concept emerged in 2010-2015 by order of Russia's Federal Marine Agency. Program's state customer and coordinator was country's Ministry of Industry and Trade. The shipbuilding cost varies between RUB 2,5-3,5 billion (USD 37-52 million) with payback period 5-20 years. Next photo shows the design of Mosturflot-Vodohod's new project PV300VD.\n\nNext photo combo shows the design of Mosturflot's PV300 ship project.\n\nThe routes foreseen for the new Russian ships are in season (May to October) between Moscow and Saint Petersburg, then taking travelers from Moscow to Samara and Rostov-on-Don. In the winter the ships cruise in the Eastern Mediterranean (and even further south to Red Sea), with call ports like Rostov-on-Don, Taganrog, Novorossiysk, Sochi, Trabzon Turkey, Istanbul Turkey, Alexandria Egypt. Also scheduled are Black Sea cruises visiting the largest ports in Crimea (Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia, Kerch, Yevpatoria), as well as ports on Azov Sea and Caspian Sea.\n\nThe newbuilds could carry about 500,000 passengers annually, of which about 100,000 foreign tourists. The number of foreigners declined by nearly a half in 2014 as western tour operators cut Russian programs and westerners stayed away. According to the Ministry of Industry and trade, buyers of the new ship would be operators like Mosturflot (GK Sea and River shipping company), Vodohod and Orthodox. Given the high cost of the vessels, it is planned to lease them to operators. The main difference of this 4-deck ship is that it will be able to navigate not only rivers but seas as well. The vessels will also be more luxurious than past ships and will include western amenities, such as French balconies and comfortable large suites.\n\nVolga River cruise port terminals\n\nNext are shown VODOHOD's ship terminals (dock sites / berths) adresses in ports:\n\nMoscow - North River Station (Metro \"Rechnoy Vokzal\", Leningradskoye Str 51) - Северный речной вокзал, метро \"Речной вокзал\", Ленинградское 51)\n\nSt Petersburg: - Utkina Zavod pier (Oktyabrskaya Naberezhnaya Str, 31 (free shuttle bus service is provided from Proletarskaya metro station to the dock) - причал \"Уткина Заводь\", Октябрьская набережная, 31\n\nNizhny Novgorod - Nizhne-Volzhskaya embankment (berth 14) located in front of \"The Hero\" monument, Markin Square, 15A, berths 5-6 (Нижне-Волжская набережная, причал 14, площадь Маркина, 15А., причалы 5-6), \"River Station\" (berths 5-6, Markina Square 15A) - Причал \"Речной Вокзал\" 5-6 (пл Маркина 15А), Причал 14\n\nSamara - Maxim Gorky Str, 82 (berths 3-4) - Максима Горького, 82 (причалы 3-4).\n\nKazan - Devyataev Str, 1 (Девятаева, 1)\n\nAstrakhan - River Station berth (Admiralteyskaya Str, 1, pier 17) - Причал \"Речной Вокзал\", Адмиралтейская 1, пристань 17)\n\nPerm - River Station berth (Ordzhonikidze Str 2) - Причал Речной Вокзал (Ул Орджоникидзе 2)\n\nNote: You can see the CruiseMapper's list of all river cruise ships and riverboats in the \"itinerary\" section of our River Cruises hub.

In the 19th century, Nizhniy became the trade center of the whole state as it was the place of the biggest fair in the Russian Empire. A proverb of that time says: \"Moscow is the heart of Russia, St. Petersburg is its head, and Nizhniy Novgorod - its pocketbook\". The city was renamed \"Gorky\" in Soviet times, in honor of the writer Maxim Gorky, born there. Until 1990, Nizhniy Novgorod was “closed” to foreigners as USSR protected its military secrets.
