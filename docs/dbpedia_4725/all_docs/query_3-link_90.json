        "text": "It goes without saying that this liner will be extremely small.\n\nAlthough there is a fair amount of skepticism about transport powered by electric motors, the energy for which is stored in batteries, the development of this industry is still underway. Electric buses and even electric river “trams” run around the country, at least in the big cities, and it seems that the latter example has greatly inspired shipbuilders, and they have decided build Electric cruise ship “Baikal” for traveling around the largest lake on Earth in terms of fresh water reserves.\n\nThe project will be implemented by the Perm Shipyard of the Emperium company, commissioned by the well-known Russian river transportation operator OOO Vodohod.\n\nThe construction of the vessel will take two years: its commissioning is planned for September 2026, which, of course, is not very good for cruises on Lake Baikal, but such is the harsh reality.\n\nAccording to the plan, the electric ship “Baikal” will consist of three decks, and all amenities will correspond to a five-star hotel. The maximum number of passengers on board the vessel can be up to 68."
