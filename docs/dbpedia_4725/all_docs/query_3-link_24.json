        "text": "Deliveries include a Swedish-owned autonomous ferry, a Russian river tour boat, and a shuttle ferry for a French operator. The first large cruise ship to be built in China is launched into the water. Finally, a Norwegian cruise company unveils the first images of one of its future vessels that will be equipped with fossil fuel-free propulsion systems.\n\nNamed Estelle, the ferry commenced operational sailings in Stockholm on Monday, June 12. Four departures are scheduled for each of 15 hours that the vessel is in operation every day, though Torghatten expects the number of hourly departures to increase to eight in the coming months.\n\nAn operator will be on board during the vessel's initial sailings. The long-term objective is for sailings to be conducted autonomously under the supervision of shore-based personnel.\n\nEkokhod has a length of 31, a beam of nine metres, battery propulsion, and capacity for 130 passengers on two decks. The interior spaces can also be configured to accommodate a variety of private events such as corporate gatherings and live musical performances.\n\nThe vessel's initial sailings will be along the Yenisei River in the city of Krasnoyarsk in Siberia.\n\nDesigned by Mer et Design, Marie-Therese has a length of 25 metres and capacity for 40 passengers and 40 tonnes of freight. Power is provided by two Volvo D16 IMO Tier III engines fitted with selective catalytic reduction systems.\n\nAdora Magic City will be operated by CSSC Carnival Cruise Shipping. Once completed, it will have an LOA of 323.6 metres and 2,125 staterooms to house a total of 5,246 guests. Power will be provided by diesel generators with a total output of 62.4 MW.\n\nNorwegian cruise company Hurtigruten has unveiled the first images of its future vessel that will be fitted with a propulsion system promising zero emissions."
