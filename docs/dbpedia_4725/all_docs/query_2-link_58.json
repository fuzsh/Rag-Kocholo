This is reported in the Telegram channel of the United Shipbuilding Corporation.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation - Minister of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation Denis Manturov announced the conclusion of an agreement on the construction of three cruise ships of the Karelia project between the Krasnoe Sormovo plant and the Vodohod company. Financing of the construction will be carried out through the STLC.\n\n\"The construction of civilian vessels will help to upgrade the country's flotilla and increase the volume of passenger traffic. This requires serious state support. The government has allocated 15 billion rubles to launch the construction of seven vessels of the civil fleet. Part of this amount will be used to finance three cruise ships of the Karelia project. This is a development of the Vimpel design bureau, and the vessels will be built at the Krasnoe Sormovo plant,\" said Denis Manturov, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation – Minister of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation.\n\nAccording to USC, all vessels have a river-sea class. They will run along the Caspian, Black and White Seas and be used on inland waterways. It is planned that the first vessel will begin navigation in 2025, the second and third – in 2026.\n\nRead more interesting news in our Telegram channelAuthor: Anton Yakovlev\n\nMade in Russia // Made in Russia\n\n#made by Russia"
