        "text": "Swan Hellenic, the heritage British cruise brand, is to be relaunched with two new expedition ships.\n\nThe company will be run by the same executives that are behind Vodohod, the Russian river line. However, while the companies share some shareholders it is understood that there are other investors involved.\n\nG Adventures, which acquired Swan Hellenic in 2017, sold the brand and database to the new owners.\n\nAndrea Zito, Swan Hellenic’s CEO said: “I am proud to announce the rebirth of Swan Hellenic a pioneering iconic travel brand with the mission to be the leader in cultural expedition cruising The new Swan Hellenic, retains its British heritage whilst being international in outlook. Aimed at the traveller, who wishes to explore, experience and enrich whilst the infinite beauty of the world and its inhabitants in a safe and sustainable way”.\n\nThe two ships are being built in the Helsinki Shipyard Oy, Finland. Both will carry 152 guests and 120 staff. The first ship will sail in Antarctica from November 2021 and the second will launch in April 2022.\n\nThe company will launch with offices in Monaco, the UK and Germany. The senior management team will be led in the UK by John Warner and Mario Bounas. Alfredo Spadon will lead the company in Germany (Silversea/MSC) and Andrea Zito will be based in the Monaco headquarters.\n\nZito also said that the line was keen to work with the trade. “Swan Hellenic was always a family brand and we want to continue along the same line by inviting all cruise industry partners to become part of the new Swan Hellenic community”.\n\nAll interested agents can register their interest at swanhellenic.com/partners.\n\nFor now, the website is live, and Andrea Zito added: “over the course of the next few weeks and months we’ll be releasing more information about a number of exciting developments from Swan Hellenic. We are back and we’re bigger and bolder than ever”."
