        "text": "KELD NAVNTOFT/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTime for part two of our coverage of the jewels worn at Prince Joachim and Princess Marie of Denmark’s wedding, which took place nine years ago today in Mogeltonder. This post features the jewels worn by the families of Princess Benedikte and Queen Anne-Marie; head over here for more jewels from the Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian royals!\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nPrincess Benedikte, aunt of the groom, wore jewels inherited from various lines of the family. Her tiara, Queen Sofia’s Star and Pearl Tiara, comes from one of her mother’s Swedish ancestors, Sofia of Nassau. Her necklace, which can be worn in various lengths and forms, belonged to her grandmother, Queen Alexandrine of Denmark. The diamond and sapphire brooch, which can also be worn as a pendant, once belonged to Princess Thyra of Denmark. She inherited the diamond earrings from her mother, Queen Ingrid of Denmark.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nOn her right wrist, Benedikte wore an intriguing bracelet; she also wore a ring on her right hand that appears to be set with a pearl.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nPrincess Alexandra, Benedikte’s elder daughter, borrowed her mother’s Floral Birthday Tiara for the wedding. She paired it with diamond earrings, a diamond necklace, and a diamond bow brooch.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nAlexandra fastened a sparkling bracelet around her right wrist.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nOn her left wrist, she wore the golden bracelet given to all of Queen Ingrid’s female descendants on their fifth birthdays. Her wedding and engagement rings glittered on her left hand.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nHere’s a look at the purple gown that Alexandra wore to the wedding. She was escorted by her husband, Count Jefferson von Pfiel und Ellguth. Alexandra and Jefferson, who married in 1999, recently announced their separation.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nCarina Axelsson, partner of Princess Benedikte’s son, Prince Gustav, wore a diamond floral tiara to the wedding. She paired the sparkler with a yellow gown, plus a brooch and earrings set with diamonds and turquoises.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nAnother aunt of the groom, Queen Anne-Marie, wore the family’s wedding tiara: the Khedive of Egypt Tiara. She inherited the elaborate Cartier tiara from her mother, Queen Ingrid. After Anne-Marie took possession of the tiara, she had the base adjusted so that the tiara sits higher on the wearer’s head. On this occasion, she wore the tiara with diamond earrings, a diamond necklace, and a diamond and pearl bow brooch. The brooch comes from the collection of her mother-in-law, Queen Friederike of the Hellenes.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nAnne-Marie wore bracelets on both wrists; on her left wrist, you can see her golden family bracelet.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nHere’s a look at the stack of thin bracelets on Anne-Marie’s right wrist, plus the ring she wore on her right hand.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nBoth of the Danish royal sisters wore the family order of their father, King Frederik IX and the insignia of the Order of the Elephant. Benedikte also wore the Order of the Dannebrog, and Anne-Marie wore the commemorative badge of the Centenary of the Kingdom of Greece.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nAnne-Marie’s elder daughter, Princess Alexia of Greece and Denmark, wore her diamond tiara with the diamond drop earrings she wore on her own wedding day. The diamond and ruby bow brooch that she has pinned to her jacket originally belonged to her great-grandmother, Queen Alexandrine of Denmark. You can also spot her golden family bracelet on her left wrist and a ring with a green stone on her left hand. Under her jacket, she’s wearing the insignia of the Order of the Redeemer.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nPrincess Theodora, Anne-Marie’s younger daughter, wore her mother’s Antique Corsage Tiara with a pair of modern pendant earrings. She wore a black choker necklace decorated with a sparkling butterfly, and she secured the sash of her order with a round brooch.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nTwo bracelets — one in shades of gold and blue, and a more delicate chain bracelet — were visible on Theodora’s right wrist.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nTheodora, who is wearing the Order of Saints Olga and Sophia, was escorted by her brother, Prince Philippos, who wears the Order of George I. Two years after this wedding, Theodora moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career. Under the name “Theodora Greece,” she is best known for a role on the television soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful. (Prince Philippos works as a hedge fund analyst in New York.)\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nPrincess Tatiana was still Tatiana Blatnik in 2008 — she married Anne-Marie’s second son, Prince Nikolaos of Greece and Denmark, in 2010. She wore glittering drop earrings to this wedding.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nTatiana wore a large cocktail ring on her left hand.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nHere’s a look at Tatiana’s bright purple gown. She’s escorted here by her now-husband, Prince Nikolaos, who wears the Order of the Redeemer.\n\nWhich jewels from this royal wedding were your favorites?\n\nJENS NOERGAARD LARSEN/AFP/Getty Images\n\nNine years ago today, Prince Joachim of Denmark married Marie Cavallier in Mogeltonder. Today, we’ve got two flashback posts on tap full of jewels from this royal wedding. Enjoy this look at jewels worn by the main line of the Danish royal family, plus the Norwegian and Swedish royals, and stop back for even more royal jewels later today!\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nMarie Cavallier, who became Princess Marie of Denmark after her wedding, wore Princess Dagmar’s Floral Tiara on her wedding day. The tiara is on long-term loan to Marie from her mother-in-law, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark. Although she has acquired another tiara to wear during her marriage, this remains her primary diadem today. A press release from the Danish court on the wedding day noted that Marie also wore “a pair of diamond earrings from Genève.”\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nMarie’s lace wedding gown was designed by the firm Arasa Morelli. Her tulle and lace veil had a floral design that echoed the diamond flowers in her wedding tiara.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nJoachim’s mother, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, wore a tiara that she often dons at weddings: the Baden Palmette Tiara. The palmette motifs of the tiara form heart shapes, making it particularly appropriate for the occasion. She paired the tiara with diamond earrings, a diamond necklace, and a diamond brooch.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nShe also wore the insignia of the Order of the Elephant, the Order of the Dannebrog, and her father’s family order.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nCrown Princess Mary of Denmark wore the parts of the grand ruby parure for the occasion. This wedding happened not long before she had the tiara remodeled to better fit the shape of her head. She’s also wearing part of the earrings from the suite.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nThe large brooch was pinned to Mary’s bodice, and she wore the ruby bangle on her right wrist. A diamond ring is visible on her right hand, and her wedding and engagement rings are on her left.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nMary also wore the Order of the Elephant and her mother-in-law’s family order.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nThe Swedish royal family was represented at the wedding by Crown Princess Victoria. She wore the family’s four-button tiara, as well as the drops from the Connaught Diamond Tiara on a necklace. Her earrings came from Queen Josefina’s grand diamond stomacher.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nOn her left wrist, she wore two diamond bracelets…\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\n…and she wore an evening watch on her right wrist. A diamond ring is also visible here on her right hand.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nVictoria pinned her father’s family order to the sash of the Order of the Elephant.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nCrown Princess Mette-Marit of Norway wore her own wedding tiara, the Diamond Daisy Bandeau, for this royal wedding. She paired it with the diamond earrings that belonged to her husband’s grandmother, Crown Princess Martha.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nMette-Marit secured the sash of the Order of St. Olav with a diamond and pearl brooch. (In 2008, she didn’t have the Order of the Elephant yet; she does now.)\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nA bracelet set with diamonds and green stones can be seen here on her right wrist.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nMette-Marit, who was escorted by Crown Prince Haakon, also wore her father-in-law’s family order.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nPrincess Martha Louise also attended from Norway. She wore King Olav’s Gift Tiara with a suite of jewels — earrings, necklace, and ring — set with diamonds and milky blue stones (possibly moonstones?).\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nOn her left hand, she also wore a ring set with a blue stone (possibly a star sapphire). She secured the sash of the Order of the Elephant with a small brooch; her father’s family order was also pinned to the bodice of her gown. Martha Louise was expecting her third child, Emma, at the time of this wedding. Sadly, she and her husband, Ari Behn, are now in the process of divorcing.\n\nCLAUS FISKER/AFP/Getty Images\n\n…and in a non-royal bonus, here’s a glimpse of some other wedding guests, Sir Roger Moore and his wife, Kiki Tholstrup. As I was finishing up edits to this post, I learned that Sir Roger had just passed away at the age of 89. Moore popped up occasionally at royal events, thanks to friendships with Prince Joachim of Denmark, Prince Albert II of Monaco, and the late Princess Lilian of Sweden.\n\nStay tuned later today for the rest of the jewels from this royal wedding flashback!"
