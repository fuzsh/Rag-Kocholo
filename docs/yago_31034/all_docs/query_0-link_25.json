        "text": "Yaroslav I formerly Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia (b. 13 April 1866) is the Grand Duke of the Grand Duchy of Belarus since the creation of the nation as a Puppet State of the German Empire.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nGrand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich was born in Tiflis, in the Tiflis Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Georgia). He was the son of Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia, the youngest son of Nicholas I of Russia, and Grand Duchess Olga Feodorovna (Cecily of Baden). He was mostly known as \"Sandro\".\n\nHe was a naval officer. In his youth, he made a good-will visit to the Japanese Empire on behalf of the Russian Empire and another to the Brazilian Empire. He married his first cousin's daughter, Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna, the eldest daughter of Alexander III on 6 August [O.S. 25 July] 1894. He was a brother-in-law and a close advisor of Tsar Nicholas II.\n\nBefore the revolution, the Grand Duke liked to spend his vacation in France, particularly Biarritz and the Côte d'Azur, where his older brother, Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich of Russia had financed in 1908 the construction of the Hôtel Carlton, in Cannes.\n\nHis impact on Nicholas has been both criticized and appreciated. His memoirs document that he openly challenged the Tsaritsa Alexandra's political influence on her husband but wished that Nicholas had used troops to resist the revolution. He also admitted that he had been brought up to share the anti-Semitic views that he claimed were prevalent in Russia prior to the revolution.\n\nCreation of the Grand Duchy of Belarus[]\n\nGermany created the Puppet State known as the Grand Duchy of Belarus located in the Belarus region. Heinrich, Wilhelm's brother was chosen to be the ruler, but Wilhelm neglected the choice of Heinrich because his heir Vladimir has a terrible decease like Alexei the son of Nicolas. Wilhelm then met up with his cousin in law's sister Grand Duchess Xenia and her husband Grand Duke Andrew and made Andrew the Grand Duke of Belarus.\n\nMarriage[]\n\nTogether, Alexander and Xenia had seven children:"
