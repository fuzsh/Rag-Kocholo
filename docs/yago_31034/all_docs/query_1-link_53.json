        "text": "On this day -18th May 1896 – Russia’s first cinema opened at No. 46 Nevsky Prospekt (now the Neva restaurant is located here), in St. Petersburg.\n\nOne of the spectators wrote:\n\n“Today, we visited Nevsky … The electric light goes out, the hiss of the cinematograph is heard in the hall, and a moving photograph appears on the screen in front of the eyes of the audience… The scenes we have seen, were an approaching train, a quarrel between two men and their struggle, a game of cards, workers leaving the Lumière factory, a group of children quarreling, and an acrobat playing with a ribbon.”\n\nFrom 1900 to 1918, Russian cinema developed rapidly, and was very widespread and popular in many large cities, including St. Petersburg, Moscow, Kiev, Odessa, Nizhny Novgorod, Baku, Tiflis, and Yekaterinburg; foreign cinema was also popular.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the Holy Coronation of Emperor Nicholas II also took place in Moscow in May 1896. The entire solemn procession was captured on film, by French cameramen from the Lumiere Brothers in Paris. The 1 hour and 33 minute documentary became the first documentary film shown in cinemas across the Russian Empire. A copy of the film was presented by Lumiere to Emperor Nicholas II.\n\nThe cinema with it’s “moving pictures” became very popular in Russia, therefore, it should come as no surprise, that Emperor Nicholas II took a keen interest in the cinematograph [an early motion picture projector].\n\nDuring Nicholas II’s reign, the Alexander Palace underwent many modern upgrades: it was wired for electricity, and equipped with telephones and a cinematograph. A “screening booth” was built in the Great Library where the Imperial Family gathered to watch films. The Tsar even wrote down his favorite “cinematic pictures” in his diary.\n\nAs a rule, film screenings were held once a week, and Empress Alexandra Feodorovna selected the films as follows: first, they showed newsreels shot by the court photographers during the week, then an educational film, and finally a comedy for children.\n\nNicholas II enjoyed English and French newsreel films about the First World War, as well as documentary films about officers, service in the navy and daily life in the armed forces. The Tsar also paid particular attention to foreign news, which he watched with great interest, even taking notes. Interestingly, the Tsar himself, was often the central figures in many of these foreign newsreels.\n\nHe later equipped the Imperial Yacht Shtandart with a cinematograph. In 1913, the Tsar noted in his diary, that he had watched a Russian documentaries “The Tercentenary of the Reigning House of Romanov” and “The Heroic Feat of Private Vasily Ryabov”, as well as an Italian production “Ballerina from the Odeon”.\n\nPHOTO: Maurice Paléologue (1859-1944)\n\nOn one occasion, the French ambassador to Russia Maurice Paléologue was invited to the Alexander Palace, to watch a film with the Emperor and Empree. That evening, he recorded the event in his diary:\n\n“I arrived at Tsarskoye Selo at five o’clock. The cinema was installed in a large round hall [the Semi-Circular Hall]; three chairs were placed in front of the screen; there were a dozen chairs around them. Almost immediately the Emperor and Empress came out with the Grand Duchesses and the Heir Tsesarevich, accompanied by the Minister of the Court Fredericks and his wife, the Oberhoffmeister Count Benckendorff and his wife, Colonel Naryshkin, Madame Buxhoevden, the tutor of the heir Gilliard and several officials of the palace administration. In all the doors, stood maids and palace servants, all crowded and peeping out. The Emperor is dressed in a marching uniform; the Empress and the Grand Duchesses wore simple woollen dresses; the other ladies in day dresses.\n\n“Before me is the Imperial Court in all the simplicity of its everyday life. The Emperor seats me between himself and the Empress. The lights are turned off, and the film begins.”\n\n© Paul Gilbert. 18 May 2024\n\nPHOTO: 10-year-old Tsesarevich Alexei Nikolaevich, driving his motorcar, a Peugeot BP1 Bebe, accompanied by driver Adolfe Kegresse in front of the White Tower, situated in the Alexander Park, near the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo in 1914\n\nAmong the fleet of more than 50 motorcars that were used only by Emperor Nicholas II and members of his family was a fully functional, gasoline-powered Peugeot BP1 Bebe. The Peugeot Bébé was a line of the smallest cars that Peugeot produced between 1901 and 1919.\n\nIn 1912, the famous French automaker Peugeot released the Peugeot Bebe, designed by Ettore Bugatti, complete with a four-cylinder engine with a displacement of 855 cm3 and power of 10 hp. The model was first presented to the public at the Paris Motor Show in 1912.\n\nThe Peugeot Bébé came to Russia in May 1913 at the IV International Automobile Exhibition in St. Petersburg, an event that was attended by the Tsar. Its price was 4000 francs (with bodywork). In 1913 one franc was worth 0.37 kopecks, thus the pricetag for this motorcar worked out to 1900 rubles including taxes.\n\nPHOTO: Tsesarevich Alexei riding along the pathways of the Alexander Park in the back seat of his Peugeot Bebe, 1914\n\nAlexei’s paternal grandmother Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, bought a Peugeot BP1 Bebe motorcar for Tsesarevich Alexei on his nameday[1] – 18th October.\n\nAlexei received the car on Sunday, 18th (O.S. 5th) October, 1914, and on Thursday, 22nd (O.S. 9th) October, Emperor Nicholas II wrote in his diary: “I took a brisk walk with Maria and Anastasia todat. We saw Alexei in the park, riding in a small motorcar presented to him on 5th October”.\n\nPHOTO: 10-year-old Tsesarevich Alexei Nikolaevich, accompanied by driver Adolphe Kegresse in his Peugeot BP1 Bebe, near the White Tower in the Alexander Park. In the back seat is Grand Duchess Anastasia. Standing next to the motorcar is the French tutor Pierre Gilliard. 1914.\n\nPHOTO: Tsesarevich Alexei taking his aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna for a spin around the Alexander Park in his Peugeot BP1 Bebe. Standing in the background are Alexei’s sisters Grand Duchesses Anastasia and Maria Nikolaevna. 1914.\n\nSince all members of the Imperial Family were avid amateur photographers, each of them had their own camera. Thousands of their personal photographs have survived to the present day, including several photographs in which Tsesarevich Alexei is photographed behind the wheel of his Peugeot Bebe.\n\nDespite the fact that the motorcar was very light (350 kg) and had a length of about two and a half meters, the 10 hp engine allowed it to reach speeds of up to 60 km per hour.\n\nOf course, Alexei did not “drive” his motorcar very often. His parents could not risk the safety of their hemophiliac son, since any injury received in an accident could be fatal for him. Therefore, they assigned the Tsar’s personal chauffeur Adolfe Kegresse (1879-1943) to accompany Alexei while he was out driving. His drives were restricted to the tree-lined alleys of the Alexander Park at Tsarskoye Selo, and he was only permitted to drive in first gear. According to witnesses, Alexei drove “quite confidently”. He often took his sisters and tutors on short drives.\n\nPHOTO: after the 1917 Revolution, the Alexander Palace became a museum. Tsesarevich Alexei’s Peugeot BP1 Bebe was put on display, bext the wooden slide in the Marble Hall [aka the Mountain Hall]\n\nFollowing the February 1917 Revolution, Tsesarevich Alexei’s Peugeot Bébé stood ownerless for a very long time. After Emperor Nicholas II’s collection of more than 50 motorcars housed in the Imperial Garage’s at Tsarskoye Selo, St. Petersburg, Moscow, Livadia and Mogilev were “confiscated” by the Provisional Government, the Peugeot Bebe remained at Tsarskoye Selo, where it was placed on display in the Marble Hall [aka the Mountain Hall] of the Alexander Palace, and removed from the lists of the Provisional Government Motor Depot.\n\nIn photographs taken in the 1920s of the Marble Hall in the Alexander Palace, Alexei’s motorcar is clearly visible, sitting next to the wooden slide, constructed in 1833, at the behest of Emperor Nicholas I and his wife Empress Alexandra Feodorovna.\n\nPHOTOS: after the 1917 Revolution, the Alexander Palace became a museum. Tsesarevich Alexei’s Peugeot BP1 Bebe was put on display, bext the wooden slide in the Marble Hall [aka the Mountain Hall]\n\nThere is no doubt that the Bolsheviks considered Tsesarevich Alexei’s Peugeot Bébé as nothing more than an extravagant “toy” and of no historical value. The motorcar stood in the Alexander Palace until 1929.\n\nIn 1930, Alexei’s Peugeot BP1 Bebe was transferred to the collection of the Leningrad Palace of Pioneers, also housed in the Alexander Palace. During the 1930s, pioneers who were members of the motoring club learned to drive in the Tsesarevich’s motorcar. In 1942 – during the Great Patriotic War – a bomb hit the Anichkov Palace [where the Peugeot Bébé jad been moved], and Tsesarevich Alexei’s motorcar was irretrievably lost.\n\nNOTES:\n\n[1] Russians celebrate name days separately from birthdays. Celebrations range from the gifting of cards and flowers to full-blown celebrations similar to birthday parties. Such a celebration begins with attendance at the divine services marking that day (in the Russian tradition, the All-Night Vigil and Divine Liturgy), and usually with a festive party thereafter. The Russian Imperial family followed a tradition of giving name-day gifts.\n\nBefore the October Revolution of 1917, Russians regarded name days as important as, or more important than, the celebration of birthdays, based on the rationale that one’s baptism is the event by which people become “born anew” in Christ.\n\n© Paul Gilbert. 27 April 2024\n\nPHOTO: view of the Western Wing of the Alexander Palace, Tsarskoye Selo\n\nAccording to the TASS News Agency, the Western Wing of the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo is now scheduled to open to the public in 2025.\n\nRecall that the Eastern Wing of the palace, which houses the private apartments of Emperor Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra Feodorona, reopened to the public in 2021, after an extensive restoration which began in the autumn of 2015.\n\nThe Soviet navy in the Western Wing\n\nIn 1951, by a government decree, the Alexander Palace was transferred to the Ministry of Defense of the USSR. The Naval Department used the building as a top-secret, submarine tracking research institute of the Baltic Fleet. As a result, the former palace would be strictly off-limits to visitors for the next 45 years.\n\nWhen it appeared that the Soviet Navy intended to vacate the complex, the Alexander Palace was included in the 1996 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund (WMF).\n\nIn the summer of 1997, a permanent exhibition dedicated to the Nicholas II and his family was opened in the Eastern Wing of the palace. It was at this time that my annual Romanov Tour became the first group from the West to visit the interiors of the Alexander Palace.\n\nThe rest of the palace, including remained under the administration of the Naval Department, who continued to occupy the Western Wing. It is due to their occupancy of this section of the palace, that very few of the original interiors and their elements survived.\n\nIt was not until October 2009, according to the order of the Federal Property Management Agency, that the Alexander Palace was placed under the administration of the Tsarskoye Selo State Museum Reserve.\n\nCurrent restoration of the Western Wing\n\nDuring her recent press conference, the Director of the Tsarskoye Selo Museum-Reserve Olga Taratynova told the Russian news agency, that “restoration work continues in the Alexander Palace. A huge effort is now being made to complete work on the interiors of the Western Wing of the palace.” She further noted, that “the largest part of the work will be completed by the end of this year, and that the opening of the entire Alexander Palace will not take place until next year (2025).\n\nUpon completion, the Alexander Palace will become a multifunctional museum complex. The Western Wing will include exhibition halls, halls for temporary exhibitions, halls for research work and conferences, as well as a library and a children’s center.\n\nThis latest development will be welcome news to those who have been following the progress of the restoration of the Alexander Palace, and anxiously awaiting it’s completion. It is my understanding, that future restoration projects include a restoration of the the Children’s House and Island, and the restoration of the Children’s Rooms, situated on the second floor of the Eastern Wing of the palace. No time frame has been given for these projects, therefore, we could be waiting years before their completion.\n\n© Paul Gilbert. 8 April 2024\n\nPHOTO: the IRMHS conference was held in the\n\nLarge Library Hall of the Alexander Palace\n\nOn Tuesday, 27th February 2024, the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo hosted a conference dedicated to the history of the creation of the Imperial Russian Military Historical Society (IRMHS). The event was a joint effort between the local branch of the IRMHS of the Leningrad region, the Directorate of the IRMHS in Moscow, and the Tsarskoye Selo State Museum.\n\nThe organizers chose the Alexander Palace deliberately, since it was here at the beginning of the 20th century that a meeting was held on the creation of the Imperial Russian Military Historical Society took place. The conference was held in the Large Library Hall of the palace.\n\nVladimir Kazakov, Executive Director of the Regional Branch of the Russian Military Historical Society in the Leningrad Region, read out a welcome address from Vitaly Martynyuk, Executive Director of the Russian Military Historical Society:\n\n– It is symbolic that the conference is being held in such a historic place – in the Alexander Palace, where in 1907 Emperor Nicholas II read the Journal of the Council of the Russian Military History Society and wrote on it: “Deeply sympathizing with the goals of the Society, I willingly accept the title of its Honorary Chairman and bestow on it the title of Imperial.” The activities of the organization fully corresponded to such a high title,” Vitaly Martynyuk emphasized.\n\nHe recalled that the Imperial Russian Military Historical Society made a significant contribution to the anniversary celebrations dedicated to the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Lesnaya (1708) and the victory in the Battle of Poltava (1709), as well as the 100th anniversary of the Patriotic War of 1812. With the participation of IRMHS, monuments to Alexander Suvorov in Izmail and Rymnik, Mikhail Skobelev were installed in Moscow, Peter the Great in Kexholm, and Mikhail Kutuzov in the Crimea were created.\n\nOne of the key events of the conference, was the presentation of two new paintings by Andrei Romasyukov, a Russian military artist, an expert in Russian military history of the 19th and 20th centuries were presented in the Working and New Studies of Emperor Nicholas II, located in the eastern wing of the Alexander Palace.\n\nThe first painting depicting Emperor Nicholas II granting his consent to the Russian Military Historical Society on 20th October 1907, was unveiled in the Tsar’s Working Study. The second painting depicting the Emperor hosting a reception of the IRVIO Deputation on 22nd November 1907, was unveiled in the Tsar’s New Study.\n\nPHOTOS: Nicholas II in the Tsar’s Working Study by Andrei Romasyukov\n\n***\n\nPHOTOS: Nicholas II in the Tsar’s New Study by Andrei Romasyukov\n\nThe conference was attended by researchers from the Tsarskoye Selo State Museum, the A.V. Suvorov Museum, the Museum of Artillery, Engineers and Signal Corps, and the Russian National Library. Historians from the St. Petersburg, Leningrad and Vologda regions presented papers based on their research on the activities of the Imperial Russian Military Historical Society. In addition, archival documents dating from the early 20th century, relating to the creation of the Russian Military Historical Society were presented.\n\nParticipants of the conference were given a tour of the former private apartments of Emperor Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, including the State Halls of the Alexander Palace, which were recreated between Autumn 2015 and August 2021.\n\n© Paul Gilbert. 28 February 2024\n\nThe former Imperial palaces of the Russian Imperial Family take on a whole new beauty in the winter months when they are covered and surrounded with a fresh blanket of snow. The favourite residence of Nicholas II and his family, the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo in particular. The elegant Neo-Classical edifice, painted a soft pastel yellow, blend perfectly with the surrounding winter landscape. A glorious sense of peace and tranquility are felt while walking around the palace and park at this time of year.\n\nI have assembled the following collection of photos of the Alexander Palace and Park, all of which evoke a breathtaking Russian winter wonderland. After viewing these images, I am sure that you will agree that it is quite understandable why the Imperial Family so loved this place – PG\n\nPHOTO: The main gate leading into the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo. The gate was installed in 1898, based on the design of the Russian architect (of Italian origin) Silvio Amvrosievich Danini (1867-1942). The view from the street has remained virtually unchanged since the early 20th century.\n\nFollowing his abdication on 15 March (O.S. 2 March) 1917,”Colonel Romanov” passed through these gates to be reunited with his family. Together, they lived here under house arrest, until their exile to Tobolsk on 1st August of the same year.\n\nPHOTO: A lovely panoramic view which shows the expanse of the Alexander Palace from the opposite side of the pond.\n\nThe Alexander Palace was constructed in the town of Tsarskoye Selo, 30 miles south of St. Petersburg. It was commissioned by Empress Catherine II, who reigned 1762–1796, for her favourite grandson, Grand Duke Alexander Pavlovich, the future Emperor Alexander, who reigned 1801–1825), on the occasion of his marriage to Grand Duchess Elizaveta Alexeievna (1779-1826), born Princess Luise Marie Augusta of Baden in 1793.\n\nThe edifice was constructed between 1792 and 1796, by the foremost and most prolific practitioner of Neoclassical architecture in Imperial Russia, Giacomo Quarenghi (1744-1817). It was agreed that the architect had excelled himself in creating a masterpiece. In 1821, a quarter of a century later, the architect’s son wrote:\n\n“An elegant building which looks over the beautiful new garden in Tsarskoye Selo, was designed and built by my father at the request of Catherine II, who shaped it with greatest simplicity, combining both functionality with beauty. Its dignified façade, harmonic proportions, and moderate ornamentation are also manifested in its interiors without compromising comfort in striving for magnificence and elegance.”\n\nEmperor Nicholas II and his wife Empress Alexandra Feodorovna always loved this palace. After the events of Bloody Sunday in 1905, the August Coupled decided to make it their permanent residence.\n\nDuring the reign of Nicholas II, the palace underwent many modern upgrades: it was wired for electricity and equipped with a telephone system. In 1899, a hydraulic lift was installed connecting the Empress’ suite with the children’s rooms on the second floor. With the advent of motion pictures in the early 20th century, a screening booth was built in the Semicircular Hall where the family gathered to watch films.\n\nPHOTO: The eastern wing (left) is where the former private apartments of Nicholas II and Alexandra Feodorovna are located. The wing was closed in autumn 2015 for an extensive restoration.\n\nFifteen interiors situated in the eastern wing of the palace, are now scheduled to open to visitors in 2021. Among the recreated interiors are the New Study of Nicholas II, Moorish Bathroom of Nicholas II, Working Study of Nicholas II, Reception Room of Nicholas II, Pallisander (Rosewood) Living Room, Mauve (Lilac) Boudoir, Alexandra’s Corner Reception Room, the Imperial Bedroom, among others. This wing of the palace will become known as the ‘Museum of the Russian Imperial Family’.\n\nPHOTO: Situated facing the Alexander Park are the windows of the Semi-Circular Hall. It is through these doors on 1st August 1917, that the Imperial Family and their retinue departed the Alexander Palace for the last time. They were transported to the Alexandrovsky Station, where an awaiting train took them into exile to Tobolsk in Siberia. It was in Tobolsk that the Imperial Family were held under house arrest in the former Governor’s Mansion – renamed the “House of Freedom” until April 1918, when they were transferred to Ekaterinburg and subsequently murdered by the Bolsheviks on 17th July 1918.\n\nPHOTO: The warm glow from a winter sun simply adds to the beauty of the Alexander Palace surrounded by snow. During the winter months, Nicholas II took time to enjoy outdoor activities with his family. Together, they build snow fortresses, went skating on the ice covered ponds, and partook of sleigh rides through the park, a pastime in which the Empress also participated. In his zest for physical activity, the Tsar was often seen shoveling snow from the paths, chopped ice for the cellar, cut dry branches or old trees, storing firewood for the long, dark and cold winter months.\n\nPHOTO: This aerial view of the Alexander Palace, taken by a drone, shows the size of the building. The photo was taken last year, during the ongoing restoration of the palace. The surrounding park offers pathways leading to the parks numerous pavilions, as well as ponds and canals, which were often used during the summer months by Nicholas II and his children for boating.\n\nThe Alexander Palace is within walking distance of the nearby Catherine Palace, which can be seen in the upper left hand corner of the photo above.\n\nPHOTO: The Kitchen Building of the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo. Meals were prepared in this building, and taken to the palace through an underground tunnel.\n\nWhen the restoration of the palace is completed in 2024, the former Kitchen Building will serve as the main entrance to the multi-museum Alexander Palace complex.\n\nPHOTO: the Children’s Island, which features a tiny house built for the children of Emperor Nicholas I, and later enjoyed by the children of three successive monarchs: Alexander II, Alexander III and Nicholas II. To the left of the house is a small cemetery, where the Tsar buried his favourite dogs. The cemetery has survived to this day.\n\nThe island was reached by a pull-ferry, whereby sailors would pull ropes sending the ferry over to the island and back from the park’s shore.\n\nDuring two winter visits to the Alexander Palace, the author of this article managed to walk across the frozen pond to explore the island, and photograph both the house and the cemetery at close hand.\n\nAccording to the Tsarskoye Selo State Museum, there are plans to eventually restore the Children’s Island and Pavilion, once funding has been secured.\n\nPHOTO: Just a short walk from the Alexander Palace is the Feodorovsky Sovereign Cathedral, with its beautiful Russian national-style edifice and magnificent interiors, including the Cave Church.\n\nOn 2 September (O.S. 20 August) 1909, Emperor Nicholas II laid the first foundation stone for the Feodorovsky Sovereign Cathedral, which later served as the household church of the Imperial Family.\n\nAfter the 1917 Revolution, the cathedral was closed, it was badly damaged during the Great Patriotic War (1941-44). In 1991 the cathedral was transferred to the Russian Orthodox Church, restoration of the Cathedral lasted nearly 20 years..\n\nOn 17th July 1993, hundreds of Orthodox Christians and monarchists gathered for the official opening and consecration of the first monument to Emperor Nicholas II (seen on the left in the photo) to be established in post-Soviet Russia.\n\nThe monument was consecrated on the day marking the 75th anniversary of the murder of Nicholas II, on the grounds of the Feodorovsky Sovereign Cathedral. The monument is the work of St. Petersburg sculptor Victor Vladimirovich Zaiko (born 1944).\n\nPHOTO: A walk through the snow covered Alexander Park at Tsarskoye Selo offers many surprises for visitors. Over the course of the past decade, numerous pavilions have been beautifully restored, including the Sovereign’s Martial Chamber, the Arsenal, the Chapelle, and the White Tower.\n\nIn addition, some people may want to visit the gravesite of Grigorii Rasputin (1869-1916). His body was buried on 2 January (O.S. 21 December) 1916, at a small church (has not survived) that Anna Vyrubova (1884-1964) had been building in the Alexander Park. His body was exhumed and burned by a detachment of soldiers shortly after the Tsar abdicated the throne in March 1917.\n\nThere are future plans to restore the Children’s Pavilion and Island, the Chinese Theater, the Pension Stable, the Farm as well as the reclamation of the Alexander Park. There are plans to charge for entry to the park, the funds of which will help restore these historic buildings and maintain the grounds, however, this additional cost has yet to be implemented.\n\nPHOTO: western (foreground) and eastern (background) wings of the Alexander Palace\n\nClick HERE to view Summer Views of the Alexander Palace and Park, published on 29th July 2021\n\n© Paul Gilbert. 1 February 2024\n\nPHOTO: the Alexander Palace set against the backdrop of autumn colours\n\nThe first day of autumn officially arrives in Russia on 1st September. It seems only fitting that we celebrate one of the loveliest seasons of the year with these beautiful photos of the Alexander Palace and Park at Tsarskoye Selo.\n\nAutumn is my favourite time of year to visit Russia. During a visit to St. Petersburg in October 2007, I decided to spend an entire week in Pushkin [Tsarskoye Selo].\n\nStaying in Tsarskoye Selo was a refreshing change from the hustle and bustle of St. Petersburg. I stayed at the Hotel Natali which is situated in the city’s historical district, with nice rooms, and a hearty breakfast included. The main reason I chose this hotel was that the Alexander Palace is literally at the top of the street!\n\nThe hotel’s location was ideal for visiting the Alexander and Catherine Palaces, but also the Alexander Park daily on foot at my own leisure. One day, I actually walked to Pavlovsk Palace, a distance of 7.3 km. [4.5 miles]!\n\nThe Alexander Park offers pathways leading to the parks numerous pavilions, as well as ponds and canals, which were often used during the summer months by Nicholas II and his children for boating.\n\nOver the course of the past decade, numerous pavilions have been beautifully restored, including the Sovereign’s Martial Chamber, the Arsenal, the Chapelle, and the White Tower. The next restoration project in the Alexander Park will that of the Chinese Theatre.\n\nPHOTO: autumn view of the Alexander Palace from the pond\n\nThe paths throughout the Alexander Park are now blanketed in beautiful red, yellow, gold\n\nleaves that crunch under your footsteps. Cool autumn breeze gently flow through the trees spiriting loose leaves from their branches, allowing each one to dance in the air before falling gently to the ground, adding yet another element to the sprawling carpet of autumn colours. The setting is truly magical.\n\nIn addition, I had a wonderful opportunity to explore the town itself. While much of Pushkin was destroyed by the Nazis during the Great Patriotic War (1941-45), it still retains some beautiful architectural gems from the Tsarist period, including a number of palaces and churches – the Feodorovsky Sovereign Cathedral is a must!\n\nNumerous restaurants and cafes are within walking distance of the hotel, as well as a burgeoning souvenir market, where you can buy beautiful hand painted lacquer boxes, lace, and other items made by locals.\n\nFor any one planning a future visit to St. Petersburg, I highly recommend Tsarskoye Selo as an alternative place to stay. My autumn 2007 visit remains one of my most memorable visits to Russia, and it was the the season itself which enhanced the beauty of the Alexander Palace and the surrounding park.\n\nNOTE: the first 15 interiors of the private apartments of Emperor Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, situated in the eastern wing of the Alexander Palace, opened to the public on 14th August 2021. Since that date, nearly 17,000 people have visited the palace.\n\nClick HERE to read my article Alexander Palace reopens for first time since 2015 + 30 colour photos and 2 videos, published on 13th August, 2021; and HERE to read my article First stage of Alexander Palace restoration cost $30 million published on 23rd August 2021 – PG\n\nPHOTO: the Alexander Palace as it looked before the 2015-2021 restoration\n\nPHOTO: view of the western wing of the Alexander Palace\n\nPHOTO: one of the many paths in the Alexander Park carpeted with autumn leaves\n\nPHOTO: memorial to the Russian Imperial Family, erected in the Alexander Park in 2007\n\nPHOTO: the Children’s Island and House situated in the park near the Alexander Palace\n\nPHOTO: the Feodorovsky Sovereign Cathedral is a short walk through the Alexander Park\n\nPHOTO: Russia’s first monument to Nicholas II was established in 1993, on the grounds of the Feodorovsky Sovereign Cathedral\n\nClick HERE to read my article Winter Views of the Alexander Palace and Park + 11 colour photos, published on 1st February 2021; Click HERE to read my article Summer Views of the Alexander Palace and Park + 10 colour photos, published on 29th July 2021\n\n© Paul Gilbert. 4 October 2023\n\nOn 21st September 2023, a new exhibition ‘Imperial Visits to the Crimea: 1900, 1902, 1909‘ opened in the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo.\n\nNOTE: during their visits to Crimea, Nicholas II and his family stayed in the Small (Maly) Palace, until 1911, when the iconic white stone palace was constructed on the site of the Large (Bolshoi) Palace, by the Russian architect Nikolai Krasnov (1864-1939).\n\nThe Small Palace survived until the Great Patriotic War (1941-45). While there is no exact information about the destruction of the palace, some say it was the work of the Nazis, while others cite evidence from local eyewitnesses that it was the Soviets who set fire to the historic wooden palace – PG\n\nPHOTO: early 20th century postcards depicting palaces along the Black Sea coast, including the wooden palaces at Livadia – the Large (Bolshoi) and Small (Maly) Palaces are depicted above the photo of the Rotunda at Oreanda (bottom)\n\nThe exhibit is a joint project of the Tsarskoye Selo State Museum and the Alupka Palace Museum (Crimea), which showcases photographs from the private albums of Emperor Nicholas II and his family, as well as imperial memorabilia from the Tsarskoe Selo collection.\n\nThe albums with photographs capturing Emperor Nicholas II and his family during their visits to the Crimea in 1900-1909 were made for the Romanovs by K.E. von Gan & Co., a famous photography atelier in the town of Tsarskoye Selo, who were licensed to photograph the imperial family.\n\nTheir photographer and cinematographer Alexander Karlovich Yagelsky (1861-1916) used a then-innovative approach by printing still frames from film reels and thus getting more real, ‘live’ photos instead of stiff, staged shots.\n\nThe photographs on display show the Imperial Family in Livadia, Yalta, Oreanda and Sebastopol, visiting infirmaries, regimental celebrations, the ship Rostislav and cruiser Pamiat’ Merkuria (Memory of Mercury), meeting with veterans and sisters of mercy of the Crimean War, as well as walking around or playing ball and lawn tennis.\n\n“This is not just a series of photographs from beautifully designed albums with impeccable artistic taste. Before us are documents of the era that allow us to look into the past and see the people and events of the early 20th century through the eyes of the last Tsar and his family,” said Iraida Bott, Deputy Director for Research at the Tsarskoye Selo State Museum-Reserve.\n\nAn interactive touch table at the exhibition gives access to other over 130 digitized photos from the imperial albums.\n\nAmong the items of imperial memorabilia on display are Tsesarevich Alexei’s hat of a lower-rank officer from the imperial yacht Standart, Emperor Nicholas II’s jacket of a Naval Captain 1st rank, Empress Alexandra Fiodorovna’s dress, worn during their visits to Crimea in the early 20th century.\n\nThe exhibition runs until 20th November 2023.\n\n***\n\nIn 2013, the photographs from this exhibition were published in a large 240-page hardcover album – *Августейшие визиты в Крым. 1900, 1902, 1909 (Imperial Visits to Crimea. 1900, 1902, 1909). Only 1000 copies were printed.\n\n*I regret that I do not know how to obtain copies, or where copies can be obtained. Current financial sanctions imposed on Russia by the West, it is impossible to order from Russian booksellers in the Russian Federation – PG\n\n© Paul Gilbert. 27 September 2023\n\nPHOTO: view of the eastern wing of the Alexander Palace\n\nOn this day – 13th August 2021 – the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo reopened, after an extensive restoration which began in the autumn of 2015. The Russian media were invited to tour the recreated apartments of Emperor Nicholas II and Empress |Alexandra Feodorovna, located in the eastern wing of the Alexander Palace. The palace welcomed its first visitors the following day on 14th August.\n\nDuring the past 2 years, the Tsarskoye Selo State Museum restored one additional interior and recreated a number of items lost from the Alexander Palace during the Second World War . . .\n\nIn September 2022 – a luxurious 100 square meter French-made Savonnerie carpet was recreated for Empress Alexandra’s Corner Reception Room.\n\nIn February 2023 – the Marble [Mountain] Hall – which is part of the ceremonial enfilade – officially opened it’s doors to visitors for the first time in 80 years. The restored interior also includes the recreated wooden slide, which was enjoyed by members of the Russian Imperial Family.\n\nIn May 2023 – a large stand for palm tree and other large plants was recreated for the Maple Drawing Room. In addition, an L-shaped desk and ottoman were recreated for the Working Study of Nicholas II.\n\nIn June 2023 – an ottoman was recreated for the Working Study of Emperor Nicholas II. The large Persian Farahan carpet has been recreated by modern Iranian craftsmen using traditional technologies.\n\nThe price tag for the first stage of the Alexander Palace restoration was $30 million USD. The project is the result of the colossal work of hundreds of people, including designers, architects, restorers, museum workers and dozens of organizations.\n\nThe Western wing is scheduled for completion no earlier than 2024. After the completion of the work, the Alexander Palace will become a multifunctional museum complex, which will include exhibition halls, halls for temporary exhibitions, halls for research work and conferences, as well as a library and a children’s center. The basement floor will house a ticket booth, a museum shop, a café, a cloakroom, a tour desk, as well as technical and ancillary facilities.\n\n© Paul Gilbert. 13 August 2023\n\n***\n\nDear Reader: I have written more than 100 articles and news updates on the history and restoration of the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo.
