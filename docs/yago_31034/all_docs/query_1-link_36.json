        "text": "ï»¿\n\n* boys clothing : Russian royalty -- Tsar Nicholas I\n\nRussian Royalty: Nicholas I (1825-55)\n\nThe imperial succession was uncertain upon the death of Alexander I who left no heirs. The French Revolution had introduced radical new udeas to Russia. Alexander had embraced many of these ideas, but held back from graning a Contitution and introducing parlimentary democracy. A group of young, reformist military officers attempted to force the adoption of a constitutional monarchy in Russia by preventing the accession of Nicholas I and staged the Decembrist revolt in 1825, They failed utterly. Nicholas shard none of Alexander's ideals from the Enlightenment. He grew up during the Wars against the French Revolution and Napolon. He bcame the the most reactionary leader in Europe. He was a dominating figure. His policies in Russia were autocratic while his policies abroad were hostile. He was a manipulative personality strongly believing in censorship and strict control over the university. He forced the Russian language and religion upon the general population. In 1830, he abolished the Polish constitution due to an uprising. He used the Russian army to suppress the Revolutions of 1848 and became known as the policeman of Europe. Next Nicholas turned on the Ottoman Empire in a drive to obtain a warm water port. He was viewed as the cause of the Crimean War of 1853-56 as he wanted to expand Russian territory south toward the Dardinelles by seizing Turkish territory--describing it as \"Sick man of Europe\". Britain and France were concerned about Russia expanding further. The Russian armies which has conquered Napoleon had changed little. They were able to subdue street mobs in Europe, but war with modern industrial states was a very different matter. Britain and France changed by the Industrial Revolution were able at great cost to defeat Russian armies. The Russians were shocked.\n\nParents\n\nNicholas' father was Tsar Paul I Petrovich (1754- ). His mother was Maria Sophie Feodorovna von WÃ¼rttemberg (1759- ).\n\nSiblings\n\nNicholas grew up in a large family. There were ten children in all. Two of whom would becom tsars, Alexander and Nicholas, each with with long reigns. Alexander would become the sucessful war rime Tdarm palying a central role in the defeat of Napoleon, Ncholas would eign in more tranquil times. e Alexander I, Emperor of All Russia (1777 â 1825), married Luise of Baden (Elizabeth Alexeievna), had two daughters who both died in childhood Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich (1779 â 1831), married (1) Juliane of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (Anna Feodorovna), no children, marriage annulled (2) Joanna GrudziÅska, no children, a morganatic marriage that cost Constantine the crown Grand Duchess Alexandra Pavlovna (1783 â 1801), married Archduke Joseph of Austria, Count Palatine of Hungary, had one daughter who died at birth, Alexandra died of childbirth complications a week later Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna (1784 â 1803), married Friedrich Ludwig, Hereditary Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, had two children Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna (1786 â 1859), married Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, had four children including Augusta who married Wilhelm I, German Emperor, King of Prussia Grand Duchess Catherine Pavlovna (1788 â 1819), married (1) Georg of Oldenburg, had two sons (2) King Wilhelm I of WÃ¼rttemberg, had two daughters including Sophie who married King Willem III of the Netherlands Grand Duchess Olga Pavlovna (1792 â 1795), died in early childhood Grand Duchess Anna Pavlovna (1795 â 1865), married King Willem II of the Netherlands, had five children including King Willem III of the Netherlands Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich (1798 â 1849), married Charlotte of WÃ¼rttemberg (Elena Pavlovna), had five children\n\nChildhood\n\nNicholas was born at Gatchina Palace in Gatchina (1786). He was the third of Tsar Paul I's four sons. Nicholas was the ninth of the ten children. As the next to the youngest in a large family, he was npt given much attention. We have been unable to find many paintungs of him as a boy. In addition, the Emperess Catherinr detested his father, much preferring his son Alexander. With two healthy older brothers, Nicholas as a boy was not seen a likely to ever become Tsar. His grandmother Tsarina Catherine had vasically kidnapped his two older brothers (Alexander and Constantine) and raise them in her apartments. Catherine died 4 months afrer his birth so he was raisedvby his parents. They e=ntrusted his care to a governess, the Russian noble Countess Charlotte Karlovna Lieven, for his first 7byears. Countess Lieven been entrusted with the education of Nicholasâ older sisters, Now that Catherine had died, the Countess would also be responsible for Nicholas and his younger brother Michael.\n\nEducation\n\nHis parents selected Matvey Ivanovich Lamsdorf, an army general, to be his tutor when he was 4 years old. The General remained with Nicholas for 17 years.\n\nMarriage\n\nPrince Nicloas before it was clear he would be Tsar in 1817 married Alexandra (Charlotte) Hohenzollern, Princess of Prussia and daughter of King Friedrich Wilhelm III. It was a felicitous union. Nicholas and Alexandra were devoted to each other and to their large brood which followed. They are decribed as warm and affectionate parents, but despite great wealth and power did not overindulge them. [1] The Tsarina in the evenings ould play games with the children such as riddles and charades. [2] The Tsar enjoyed singing choral us music with them. The children grew up in a close knit family, and remained in touch and friendly troughout their adult lives. .\n\nChildren\n\nTsar Nicholas and Tsarina Alexandra had seven children. The eldest boy became Tsar Alexander II (1818- ). The other children were: Maria Nicholiava (1819- ), Olga of Russia Nicolaievna, Grand Duchess (1822- ), Alexandra Nicholaievna (1825- ), Constantine Nikolaievitch, Grand Duke of Russia (1827- ), Nicholas Nicholajievic, Grand Duke (1831- ), and Michael Nicholaievic (1832- ). Their titles were Grandedukes and grandduchesses. Several have interesting histories. Unforrtunately all were born before the advent of photography and thus the photographic record is limited.\n\nTsar Alexander II (1818-81)\n\nThe eldest boy was Alexander born just after the Napoleonic Wars (1818). He became Tsar Alexander II. Nicholas' successor, Alexander II, who in contrast to his father was amenable to reform. It was Alexander II who abolished serfdom (1861), though the emancipation didn't in fact bring on any significant change in the condition of the peasants. The action earned him the title of \"The Liberator\". As the country became more industrialized, its political system experienced even greater strain. Attempts by the lower classes to gain more freedom provoked fears of anarchy, and the government remained extremely conservative. As Russia became more industrialized, larger, and far more complicated, the inadequacies of autocratic Tsarist rule became increasingly apparent. By the 20th Century conditions were ripe for a serious convulsion. At the same time, Russia had expanded its territory and its power considerably over the 19th century. Its borders extended to Afghanistan and China, and it had acquired extensive territory on the Pacific coast. The foundation of the port cities of Vladivostok and Port Arthur there had opened up profitable avenues for commerce, and the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway (constructed from 1891-1905) linked the European Russia with its new eastern territories. Alexander II in 1841 married Maria of Hessen-Darmstadt (Maria Alexandrovna). The royal couple had seven seven children. He was mortally wounded when a student, I. Grinevitskii who belonged to the revolutionary organization 'The National Will', threw a bomb (1881). A cathedral was erected on the site of the murder. Alexander II was buried in the Cathedral of the St. Peter and St. Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg.\n\nMaria Nicholiava (1819-76)\n\nGrand Duchess Maria Nikolaievna (ÐÐ°ÑÐ¸Ñ ÐÐ¸ÐºÐ¾Ð»Ð°ÐµÐ²Ð½Ð°) was born before her father rose to the throne. She was a elest daughter of Tsar Nicholas I and sister of Alexander II. She was educated with her sisters Olga and Alexandra. Their education was standard for girls at the time and focused on dance, music, and drawing, Maria became quite a competent artist in hrr own right doing water colors. They grew up in the water palace, but their childhood was by no means luxurious. They were had a rgime of fresh air in ll sesons and their diet was cloely rgulated. She married Maximilian, Duke of Leuchtenberg, not a very prestigious match for the elder daughter of a tsar and sister of another tsar. Leuchtenberg was a princely title created twice by the monarchs of Bavaria for their relatives. It is based on a town in Bavaria. And of all things, the dUke had Nonapartist family connections. Maria had, however, fallen in love with him and society or nobl rank meant very little to her. The Tsar this decided to give permission to his taented and strong-willed daughter. And theDuke's limited resources mean that he had no problem living in Russia on which Maria insisted. He did not remain faithful which was not uncommon for weathy men at the time. They had seven children. The Duke was interested in science and contracted tunerculosis because of his mining activities (1852). The Granduchess was an avid art collector and President of the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg.\n\nOlga of Russia Nicolaievna, Grand Duchess (1822- )\n\nAlexandra Nicholaievna (1825- )\n\nConstantine Nikolaievitch (1827-92)\n\nGrand Duke Constantine Nikolaevich of Russia was born in in St. Petersburg (1827). While not the oldest boy, he was the second in line to the crown and thus of some dynastic importance. He was 8 years younger than his older brother and as a result they did not have a close boyhood association. Friedrich von Lutke was entrusted with Prince Constantine's education. He was educated as a naval cadet and because he was treated like other cadets, he learned more about the Russian people than most other members of thge royal family. He spoke Russian fluently at aime when many other Russian royals saw Russian as an inferior language and often spoke French. He also spoke English, French, and German. Constantine at a very young age married Alexandra von Sachsen-Altenburg, daughter of Duke Joseph. They had dsix children: Nikolai Konstantinovich (1850-1918), Olga Konstantinovna--Queen of Greece (1851-1926), Vera Konstantinovna (1854-1912), Konstantin Konstantinovich (1858-1915), Dmitry Konstantinovich (1860-1919), and Vyacheslav Konstantinovich (1862-1879). Constantine began an affair with the ballerina Anna Vasilyevna Kuznetsova and they had several children together. As a young Russian officer, he participated in crushing the revolutions of 1848-49. He participated in the Hungarian campaign and was awarded the St. George's Cross. His father died and his brother Alexander became Tsar (1855). His brother included him in his government, making Constantine responsible for naval affairs. The two developed an intimate relationship. Constantine supported his brother's reformist program. This included the abolition of serfdom (1861) and Russia's first Constitution (1881). His brother appointed him viceroy of Poland (1863). One day after arriving in Warsaw, he was wounded in an assassination attempt. In response to a Polish revolt, he declared martial law. After returning to Russia, his brother president of the government, somewhat similsar to a primeminister. He served in that capacity for 16 years until his brother was assainated (1888). He resigned when his nephew Alexander became tsar. Alexander III believes that his father and uncle had been way too liberal. He abolished the new Constitution and attempted to crush all dissent, both democratic reformers, and domestic revolutionaries, he also supressed national minorities as well as Jews and purued apolicy of Russification. Constantine thought this a great mistake, but in Tsarist Russia he had to accept autocratic nephew's decesisions. Constantine withdrew from political life. His final years were spent in the warm climate of the Crimea. He suffered a stroke (1889) and died 2 years later (1992).\n\nNicholas Nicholajievic, Grand Duke (1832-1909)\n\nGrand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia was norm (1832).
