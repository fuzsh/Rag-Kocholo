He succeeded his very distant cousin Karl Theodore as Elector of Bavaria in 1799, culminating as the first King of Bavaria on 1 January 1806 following the signing of Treaty of Pressburg on 26 December 1805. 32.13 Princess Luise of Baden 1779 1826 Emperor Alexander I of all the Russias 1777 1825 See 4.1 - Luise took the name \"Elisaveta Alexeievna\" on her marriage. 32.14 Princess Friederike of Baden 1781 1826 King Gustaf IV Adolf of Sweden 1778 1837 Gustaf was forcibly dethroned on 29 March 1809 having been arrested by Generals on 13 March following futile campaigns in which Sweden lost Finland to Russia. In December 1809 Gustaf and his family were transported to Germany. In exile Gustaf used several titles, Count Gottorp, Duke of Holstein-Eutin, and finally settled at St. Gallen in Switzerland where he lived in great loneliness and indigence, under the name of Colonel Gustafsson. It was there that he suffered a stroke and died. Gustaf was succeeded by his Uncle King Carl XIII 32.141 Crown Prince Gustaf of Sweden (Prince of Vasa) 1799 1877 Princess Luise Amalie of Baden 1811 1854 See 32.171 - Gustaf was created Prince of Vasa in 1829 by Emperor Franz I(II) of Austria 32.1411 Princess Karola Frederikke of Sweden (Vasa line) 1833 1907 King Albrecht of Saxony 1828 1902 See 26.662\n\nThere were reports in 1852 that Karola was to be married to Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte at that time President of France and later Emperor Napoleon III of the French.\n\nNew York Time Report on the death of Dowager Queen Karola.\n\nObituary of King Albrecht. 32.142 Princess Sophie of Sweden 1801 1865 Grand Duke Karl Leopold of Baden 1790 1852 See 32.5 32.143 Prince Carl Gustaf of Sweden (Duke of Finland) 1802 1805 32.144 Princess Amalia of Sweden 1805 1853 32.145 Princess Cecilie of Sweden 1807 1844 Grand Duke August of Oldenburg 1783 1853 See 31.1 32.15 Princess Marie of Baden 1782 1808 Duke Friedrich Wilhelm of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel 1771 1815 Friedrich Wilhelm was killed in action in Quatre Bas at the battle of Waterloo.\n\nHis sister Duchess Auguste of Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel was married to the future King Friedrich I of Württemberg 32.151 Duke Karl III of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel 1804 1873 Karl III was extremely unpopular and was deposed in 1830 and driven out of the country. He was extremely rich and just a \"bit\" eccentric.\n\nIt was reported in 1824 that there was no doubt that Karl was to marry Princess Luise of Prussia. Obviously this report was off target since Luise married Prince Frederik of the Netherlands in 1825.\n\nKarl had a liaison with Lady Charlotte Colville with whom he had an illegitimate daughter Elisabeth Wilhelmine (1826-1880) who he created Countess of Colmar.\n\nElisabeth married Pierre Antoine Eugene du Collin, count of Civry (1821- ?) on 10 July 1847.\n\nMarriage registration of Elisabeth and Pierre 32.152 Duke Wilhelm of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel 1806 1884 The death of Wilhelm brought this line of Brunswick to an end. In theory the Duchy should have passed to the Kings of Hanover, but as George V (King of Hanover) was strongly anti-Prussian a delaying tactic was employed by Prussia until 1913 when the Duchy finally passed to Prince Ernst August of Hanover (Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg).\n\nThe duchy was governed by regents between 1885 and 1913.\n\nA report on the death of Wilhelm and details of his duchy Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel 32.16 Prince Karl Friedrich of Baden 1784 1785 32.17 Grand Duke Karl Ludwig of Baden 1786 1818 Princess Stephanie de Beauharnais 1789 1860 Stephanie's father Claude de Beauharnais was a first cousin to Alexandre, Vicomte de Beauharnais. Napoleon Bonaparte adopted Stephanie and named her \"Princesse Française\" (Princess of France) this was to enable Napoleon to secure an alliance with the Prince-elector of Baden 32.171 Princess Luise Amalie of Baden 1811 1854 Crown Prince Gustaf of Sweden (Prince of Vasa) 1799 1877 See 32.141 32.172 Prince \"Son\" of Baden 1812 1812 There's a rumour this child was kidnapped and raised as Kaspar Hauser. The rumour also implicates his step-grandmother Countess von Hochberg in this supposed kidnapping. 32.173 Princess Josephine of Baden 1813 1900 Prince Karl Anton of Hohenzollern 1811 1885 See 6 32.174 Prince Alexander of Baden 1816 1816 32.175 Princess Marie Amalie of Baden 1817 1888 William Douglas Hamilton (11 th Duke of Hamilton and Brandon) 1811 1863 William Douglas Hamilton died after falling down the stairs of the Maison Doree on the Boulevard des Italiens in Paris 32.1751 William Alexander Douglas-Hamilton (12th Duke of Hamilton and Brandon) 1845 1895 Lady Mary Louise Montagu 1854 1934 William Alexander Douglas-Hamilton was succeeded as 13th Duke of Hamilton and Brandon by his fourth cousin Alfred Douglas (1862-1940) 32.17511 Mary Louise Douglas-Hamilton 1884 1957 James Graham (6th Duke of Montrose) 1878 1954 Birth Registration of Mary Louise Douglas-Hamilton\n\nMarriage Registration of Mary Louise Douglas-Hamilton and James Graham 32.1752 Charles George Douglas-Hamilton (7th Earl of Selkirk) 1847 1886 32.1753 Lady Mary Victoria Douglas-Hamilton 1850 1922 Prince Albert Honoré Charles of Monaco 1848 1922 See 46.211 - Albert Honoré and his wife Mary Douglas-Hamilton separated one year after their marriage in 1869 which was not annulled until 1880.\n\nThe Pope appointed a special commission to look at the case for the annulment of the marriage, due to an unsatisfactory conclusion the Pope appointed a second commission which finally annulled the marriage.\n\nPrince Albert had a great interest in science including that of oceanography and was instrumental in devising a number of techniques and instruments used for measurement and exploration of the oceans.\n\n32.1753 Lady Mary Victoria Douglas-Hamilton 1850 1922 Count Tassilo Festetics von Tolna 1850 1933 Tassilo was created Fürst Festetics von Tolna in 1911.\n\nA somewhat off target article on the supposed marriage of Mary Victoria to a gipsy violinist named Myary and her supposed disinheritance by her father the 11 th Duke of Hamilton 32.17531 Countess Maria Mathilde Festetics von Tolna 1881 1953 Prince Karl Emil zu Fürstenberg 1867 1945 See 32.842 32.17532 Prince Georg Tassilo Festetics von Tolna 1882 1941 Countess Marie Franziska von Haugwitz 1900 1972 32.17533 Countess Alexandra Olga Festetics von Tolna 1884 1963 Prince Karl of Windisch-Graetz 1871 1915 Karl's grandfather Weriand (1790-1867) was created Fürst zu Windisch-Graetz (Line II) on 18 May 1822.

There is one genealogical error in the article, which mentions Karl Leopold's father Grand Duke Ludwig I was a younger brother of Grand Duke Karl Ludwig (who was married to Stephanie de Beauharnais). In fact Ludwig I was an uncle to Karl Ludwig. 32.51 Princess Alexandrine Luise of Baden 1820 1904 Duke Ernst II of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha 1818 1893 See 28.41 - Ernst was succeeded as Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha by his nephew Prince Alfred of Great Britain (Duke of Edinburgh) 32.52 Prince Ludwig Karl of Baden 1822 1822 32.53 Grand Duke Ludig II of Baden 1824 1858 Ludwig II succeeded his father as Grand Duke of Baden in 1852 but due to a mental illness his brother Friedrich acted as Regent from 1852 to 1856. Ludwig II was succeeded as Grand Duke by his brother Friedrich on 5 September 1856 as there was no hope of Ludwig II making a recovery. 32.54 Grand Duke Friedrich I of Baden 1826 1907 Princess Luise of Prussia 1838 1923 See 11.22 - A sensation caused in Germany when the Czar of Russia declined to meet Grand Friedrich I.\n\nAn article attributed to Marquise de Fontenoy in 1894 was suggesting that Grand Duke Friedrich I was converting from Lutheran faith to the Roman Catholic faith.\n\nThe New York Times report on the death of Grand Duke Friedrich I 32.541 Grand Duke Friedrich II of Baden 1857 1928 Princess Hilda of Luxemburg 1864 1952 See 34.6 - A report on an attempted knife attack on Friedrich.\n\nFriedrich abdicated his throne on 22 November 1918 32.542 Princess Viktoria of Baden 1862 1930 King Gustaf V of Sweden 1858 1950 See 3.131 - Viktoria being the great granddaughter of King Gustaf IV Adolf of Sweden (Vasa line) reunited the Vasa line of Sweden with the Bernadotte line.\n\nReport on the death of Viktoria, Queen of Sweden 32.543 Prince Ludwig Wilhelm of Baden 1865 1888 32.55 Prince Ludwig Wilhelm of Baden 1829 1897 Princess Maria Romanovsky 1841 1914 See 18.272 32.551 Princess Sophie Marie of Baden 1865 1939 Duke Friedrich II of Anhalt 1856 1918 See 24.7332 32.552 Margrave Maximilian \"Max\" of Baden 1867 1929 Princess Marie Louise of Hanover (Duchess of Brunswick-Lüneburg) 1879 1948 See 25.111 - Maximilan \"Max\" was appointed German Chancellor on 3 October 1918 and placed in charge of obtaining a negotiated peace with the allies. He resigned his office on 9 November 1918. Max who was Heir Apparent to the Throne of Baden, renounced all claims to the Succession for himself and his heirs on 22 November 1918, coincidentally with the Abdication of Grand Duke Friedrich II of Baden.\n\nIt was reported in early 1919 that the German Democratic parties were going to nominate Prince Maximilian of Baden as the first president of the German Republic.\n\nAn interesting article on the betrothal of Max and Marie Louise.\n\nA genealogical biased article on Max 32.5521 Princess Marie Alexandra Louise of Baden 1902 1944 Prince Wolfgang of Hesse-Cassel 1896 1989 See 45.41454 - Princess Marie was killed in an Allied bombing raid in Frankfurt-am-Main.\n\nPrince Wolfgang was the last surviving descendant of Queen Victoria who was born during her lifetime. 32.5522 Margrave Berthold of Baden 1906 1963 Princess Theodora of Greece and Denmark 1906 1969 See 16.72 32.55221 - QVD Princess Margarita of Baden 1932 2013 Prince Tomislav of Yugoslavia 1928 2000 See 7.542\n\nA near escape by Prince Tomislav from death when he fell from the Palace balcony when aged 2 years.\n\nA report on the wedding of Princess Margarita and Prince Tomislav.\n\nArturo Beéche provides a fitting tribute to Princess Margarita of Baden in his blog report on her death.\n\n\"The Telegraph\" obituary of Princess Margarita of Baden 32.55222 - QVD Margrave Maximilian \"Max\" of Baden 1933 2022 Archduchess Valerie of Austria (Tuscany Line) 1941 See 20.38339 - Report on the death of Margrave Maximilian 32.552221 - QVD Princess Marie Louise of Baden 1969 Richard Baker 1936 32.5522211 - QVD Sofia Baker 2001 32.552222 - QVD Margrave Bernard of Baden 1970 Stephanie Kaul 1966 Bernard is the present head of the Grand Ducal House of Baden.\n\nWho is Bernhard, Prince of Baden, guest at Prince Philip's funeral? 32.5522221 - QVD Hereditary Prince Leopold Bernard of Baden 2002 32.5522222 - QVD Prince Friedrich Bernhard of Baden 2004 32.5522223 - QVD Prince Karl-Wilhelm Bernhard of Baden 2006 32.552223 - QVD Prince Leopold of Baden 1971 32.552224 - QVD Prince Michael of Baden 1976 Christina Höhne 1977? 32.55223 - QVD Prince Ludwig of Baden 1937 Princess Anna Maria \"Marianne\" of Auersperg-Breunner 1943 Anna Maria is a sister of Prince Heinrich of Auersperg-Breunner 32.552231 - QVD Princess Sophie of Baden 1975 32.552232 - QVD Prince Berthold of Baden 1976 Nina Schröder ? 32.5522321 - QVD Princess Hilda of Baden 2021 32.552233 - QVD Princess Aglaë of Baden 1981 Wolf von Trotha ? 32.56 Prince Karl Friedrich of Baden 1832 1906 Baroness Rosalie Luise von Beust 1845 1908 Rosalie was created Countess von Rhena on 8 May 1871 by the Grand Duke of Baden 32.561 Baron Friedrich Maximilian von Rhena 1877 1908 32.57 Princess Marie \"Molly\" of Baden 1834 1899 Prince Ernst of Leiningen (4th Prince of Leiningen) 1830 1904 See 39.21 - Ernest was an Admiral in the British Royal Navy.\n\nIt was reported in 1853 that Ernest whilst serving as a midshipman on the British ship-of-war Hastings accidently shot and killed a fellow midshipman Marquis de Lisbod.
