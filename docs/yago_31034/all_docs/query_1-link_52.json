        "text": "Grand Duchess Olga, 1914. Olga and her sisters would often receive letters from not only friends, but complete and utter strangers from around the world. Some of them were kind, shy or poetic (one of my favourite quotes was from a 16 year old American girl ‘Be kind, be kind, for fame dies and honour perishes, but loving kindness is immortal.’) Unfortunately, not all of them were so nice. They would also receive many ‘love’ letters from people (some of whom were much older than the girls).\n\n“Dear Sweetheart Olga\n\nI am writing to you the story of my heart. Leting [sic] you know that you are the real germ of my heart. So you can see my trouble, Olga you are the only medical that I have hope for. I ask you Olga, please write tell me you love me, I love you Olga, love you with all my heart, you are the only girl I have hope for, I can have other girl's here in New York also Jersey City, but the reason I love you, I do not know but I do love you. Be so kind and correspond with me. The picture I am sending with the story represent you in my heart, as you see in the magnifying glass. So please put me in your dear little heart, as I have put you in to my heat [...].\n\nI am crying for your love, and you Olga dear. This is the only hope, I have to write to you, be good, kind to me, and reply, please, please, please. I ask you don't be mad, if you don't like this letter, for when a man is in love, he is insane, all I ask from you is to reply of love to me, or reply that you don't want to do anything with me so, I will shoot myself. That will be the end to my worrying. If you only new how I love you, I have been reading newspaper about you, seeing your picture in the paper, which made me love a girl I don't know.\n\nI ask you with all my heart, save me, save me, which is write and oblige your's Ever Thine Peter the Great II (PS) Some day I will be Peter the Great II, hope I do, have hope for me also. My name is Peter J Dankoskiy. Please don't let anyone know of this please don't.”\n\n- Peter J Dankoskiy (from the United States) to Olga, 1914\n\n“These dispatches, evidently sent by one and the same person, were full of love confessions to Grand Duchess Olga, ecstatic words, requests begging for meetings, etc. In the dispatches addressed to the grand duchess [Elisabeth Feodorovna] there were insistent requests for audience, asking to assist with setting up a meeting with Olga Nikolaevna and even threats that otherwise he will kill himself at her front door, etc. The grand duchess was very disturbed by this, and asked me on her own behalf and that of the Empress to try to find out who wrote these, meet with this person, and having spoken with him, convince him to stop this correspondence.”\n\n- V. Dzhunkovsky (trans: Helen Azar)\n\nNicholas I by Joseph Lee [commissioned by Queen Victoria], 1844 - 1845\n\n“He kissed my hand & I embraced him, as I had also done the King. The Emperor's appearance is very striking; though 48, he is still very handsome, very tall, & with a very good figure. His features are quite classical, & regular. We took him to the rooms intended for him & there sat down. He kept on making all sorts of fine phrases, & kissing my hand. After a little while the King of Saxony joined us & we went to luncheon. The Children were presented & much admired. They really behaved admirably.”\n\n- Queen Victoria on Nicholas I of Russia, 2nd June 1844\n\n“He is certainly a very striking man; still very handsome; his profile is beautiful, and his manners most dignified and graceful; extremely civil—quite alarmingly so, as he is so full of attentions and politesses. But the expression of the eyes is formidable, and unlike anything I ever saw before. He gives me and Albert the impression of a man who is not happy, and on whom the weight of his immense power and position weighs heavily and painfully; he seldom smiles, and when he does the expression is not a happy one. He is very easy to get on with. [...]\n\nThe children are much admired by the Sovereigns—(how grand this sounds!) —and Alice [future mother to Alexandra Feodorovna] allowed the Emperor to take her in his arms, and kissed him de son propre accord. We are always so thankful that they are not shy. [...] The Emperor praised my Angel very much, saying: ‘C'est impossible de voir un plus joli garçon; il a l'air si noble et si bon’; which I must say is very true. The Emperor amused the King and me by saying he was so embarrassé when people were presented to him, and that he felt so ‘gauche’ en frac, which certainly he is quite unaccustomed to wear.”\n\n- Queen Victoria, 4th June 1844\n\n“I had to force the Emperor forward, as he never would come forward when I was there, and I was obliged to take him by the hand and make him appear; it was impossible to be better bred or more respectful than he was towards me. Well, on Sunday afternoon at five, he left us (my Angel accompanied him to Woolwich), and he was much affected at going, and really unaffectedly touched at his reception and stay, the simplicity and quietness of which told upon his love of domestic life, which is very great. [...] I was extremely against the visit, fearing the gêne, and bustle, and even at first, I did not feel at all to like it, but by living in the same house together quietly and unrestrainedly (and this Albert, and with great truth, says is the great advantage of these visits, that I not only see these great people but know them), I got to know the Emperor and he to know me.\n\nThere is much about him which I cannot help liking, and I think his character is one which should be understood, and looked upon for once as it is. He is stern and severe—with fixed principles of duty which nothing on earth will make him change; very clever I do not think him, and his mind is an uncivilised one; his education has been neglected; politics and military concerns are the only things he takes great interest in; the arts and all softer occupations he is insensible to, but he is sincere, I am certain, sincere even in his most despotic acts, from a sense that that is the only way to govern; he is not, I am sure, aware of the dreadful cases of individual misery which he so often causes, for I can see by various instances that he is kept in utter ignorance of many things, which his people carry out in most corrupt ways, while he thinks that he is extremely just.\n\nHe thinks of general measures, but does not look into detail. And I am sure much never reaches his ears, and (as you observed), how can it? He asked for nothing whatever, has merely expressed his great anxiety to be upon the best terms with us, but not to the exclusion of others, only let things remain as they are.... He is I should say, too frank, for he talks so openly before people, which he should not do, and with difficulty restrains himself. His anxiety to be believed is very great, and I must say his personal promises I am inclined to believe; then his feelings are very strong; he feels kindness deeply—and his love for his wife and children, and for all children, is very great. He has a strong feeling for domestic life, saying to me, when our children were in the room: ‘Voilà les doux moments de notre vie.’\n\nHe was not only civil, but extremely kind to us both, and spoke in the highest praise of dearest Albert to Sir Robert Peel, saying he wished any Prince in Germany had that ability and sense; he showed Albert great confidence, and I think it will do great good, as if he praises him abroad it will have great weight. He is not happy, and that melancholy which is visible in the countenance made me sad at times; the sternness of the eyes goes very much off when you know him, and changes according to his being put out (and he can be much embarrassed) or not, and also from his being heated, as he suffers with congestions to the head. My Angel thinks that he is a man inclined too much to give way to impulse and feeling, which makes him act wrongly often. [...]\n\nPour finir, I must say one more word or two about his personal appearance. He puts us much in mind of his and our cousins the Würtembergs, and has altogether much of the Würtemberg family about him. He is bald now, but in his Chevalier Garde Uniform he is magnificent still, and very striking. I cannot deny that we were in great anxiety when we took him out lest some Pole might make an attempt, and I always felt thankful when we got him safe home again. His poor daughter is very ill, I fear. The good King of Saxony remains another week with us, and we like him much. He is so unassuming. He is out sight-seeing all day, and enchanted with everything. [...] Our motives and politics are not to be exclusive, but to be on good terms with all, and why should we not? We make no secret of it.”\n\n- Queen Victoria, 11th June 1844\n\nShe would later say about Nicholas’ grandson, Alexander III, in a letter to her granddaughter Victoria in 1886:\n\n“I have such a dislike for the fat Czar. I think him a violent Paul-like Asiatic full of hate, passion & tyranny.”\n\n1: (From left to right) Princesses Irene, Elisabeth and Victoria with their father Louis IV, 1883\n\n2: Queen Victoria by Karl Rudolf Sohn, 1883\n\n“Darling Victoria,\n\nMay affe[ctionate] thanks for your dear letter of the 27th & let me wish you all possible happiness in this New Year. It is always a very serious thing to bid goodbye to the old one with all its anxieties, trialsm sorrows & joys, & to look forward to what is unknown & to what may happen before this day comes round again. But we must trust & rely on God’s merciful protection & help - & the more we do that the more easily shall we be prepared to meet all the trials of this very uncertain world. Always think of that, dear Child - & you will find Life far more real & far easier.\n\nI am glad you are going to Berlin. Do tell me what you think about Ella [Elisabeth of Hesse] & Fritz of Baden? He is excellent? & I hear from all sides did his work admirably & with great selbst ständigkeit [independence]. Ella sh[oul]d not marry for a year or 2 - but it w[oul]d be a v[er]y nice & comfortable position for her. Russia, I c[oul]d not wish for any of you & dear Mama always said she w[oul]d never hear of it.*\n\nWhen shall we meet again? The Season is not a good time for you - & especially not for Ella - Do you think Irene and Alicky [Alix of Hesse] c[oul]d come together to Scotland or better not together? I consult you as I know dear Papa [Louis IV] talks to you about all these things. How I sh[oul]d like to see Papa trying to blow the Pipes. He must bring them with him when he next comes over & get Ross or Campbell to give him a lesson. It is wrong that the people at Darmstadt dislike his coming here. Really he is never here more than 3 weeks or a month at a time & this last year was a great exception. Let me know what dresses you are going to wear at the Fancy [Dress] Ball. I hope you go on with your modelling? Is Louis Battenberg quite well again? How are the dogs?\n\nNow with many loves & good wishes to the others-\n\nEver your devoted Grandmama\n\nV.R.I”\n\n- Queen Victoria to Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine, 1st January 1883 (135 years ago today)\n\n*In 1884 Ella married GD Sergei of Russia while in 1894 Alicky married Tsesarevich (later Emperor) Nicholas\n\nNicholas II and Alexandra Feodorovna, 1894\n\n“My sweet darling beloved Alix!\n\nOh! it was too awful saying goodbye like that, with a lot of people looking on from all sides! I shall never forget the sweet sad and yet smiling expression of your angelic face looking out of the window as the train was beginning to move! To know that you had to spend 9 hours in that small compartment nearly by yourself - was cruel to me and especially the thought that I was of no help any more! The coming home was more than unpleasant and when I came into my room, where you had been just a few minutes before, I could not keep back my tears. But then oh! what a delightful surprise - on my table in the bedroom there lay a note from you, my darling little girl. Thank you and thank you for the soothing comforting words that you wrote in it. Oh! really those few lines did me good!\n\nCertainly, my love, I shall speak with Papa about that question and I beg you always to remember that in everything where you shall need my help, you may be sure that I shall be there by your side and that also a deeply loving and thankful heart wherever it is, will always beat in time with yours my sweet one!\n\nAll these days I was so overcome with joy and happiness, being by my darling’s side, that I could not say or tell you the hundredth part of what I might have spoken. I feel very deeply and then I cannot get the words out; it is stupid and tiresome, but so it is. I hope that that this shyness or whatever it is will pass, for the next time we meet we shall know more of each other than in the beginning.\n\nOh! how impatient I am for the moment when I can press my lips to your sweet soft face! Alix, my own darling, you don’t know how you have changed me by stretching out a fond hand and by making me rise up to you - the emblem of real pure love and faith! No! Do not think that these are vain words, no they come from my innermost feeling of admiration, trust and love that you have inspired me with. I must repeat again the same words I told my precious little girl, the day of our engagement, that all my life belonged to you and that I could never be enough thankful to you dearest, for all you have done, are doing and are going to do, for me! May God help and protect you on the difficult beginning of your path! My prayers, blessings and thoughts are constantly with my darling little thing!\n\nOf course they all went to Rosenau and I was dragged with the rest. Ella and Sandro drove in our pony-carriage. We drove up our nice road along the hill down to Rosenau where we took tea. Before that we took a walk, I saw our bench where the hare came once, then I went along the stream, looked at the grotto, found these primroses on the side of the hill - and felt suddenly that I loved that pace dearly! The weather was too fine for the occasion, the sun was bright, but I was so lonely!!!\n\nI do hope the passage was a smooth one and that sweet little owl did not suffer and is not too much tried by her journey. Give my best love to Granny. And now good-bye my own darling beloved Alix. God bless you once more!\n\nFrom ever your own deeply loving and thankful Nicky”\n\n- Nicky to Alix, 20th April 1894"
