Almost an impossibility, you say. Yes, it was almost, but not quite. I got over the difficulty to a large extent by keeping a sort of Almanach de Fabergé and against each name, I put a photograph if I could get one, and any other useful information I managed to collect, such as their particular like and dislikes, whether they preferred yachts to steam engines, the names of their friends, when they travelled and where they were likely to stay. It helped me enormously.” (Twice Seven, 1933, 161)\n\nThis compilation of a modern-day Fabergé almanac includes those who have gone before and those connoisseurs who still appreciate the art of Fabergé.\n\nFascinating stories about Fabergé collectors beginning with Tsars Alexander III and his consort Marie Fedorovna and Tsar Nicholas II and Alexandra Fedorovna, can be gleaned from these reference tools:\n\nSelected Fabergé Bibliography (1930 to the present)\n\nMcCanless, Christel Ludewig.

The couple entertained Edward VII and his mistress Mrs. Alice Keppel, at Clivenden in Buckinghamshire, the country estate given to them by his father. From 1910 to 1918 Astor was a member of Parliament for Plymouth, and on the death of his father he became a peer.

Bliss. Educated in Paris, Mildred married her stepfather’s son, the diplomat Robert Woods Bliss (see R. Woods Bliss) in 1908. She probably made her Fabergé purchases in the spring of 1908, when she returned from abroad. In a 1914 settlement she received over $4 million of the family fortune, made from her father’s patent medicine. Bliss was a noted horticulturist, collector, patron of the arts and generous philanthropist.

He maintained three homes, in France and in America, including a villa in Newport, Rhode Island, and spent much time on his yacht, Lysistrata. He was involved in both the world of sports and European society. In 1914, in Paris, he married the former Maud Potter of Philadelphia, widow of Baron George de Reuter. Among his known peculiarities was his love of owls. His only purchase from Fabergé was an owl. (GvH 341)\n\nDaniel Bibb, lender of Fabergé silver and other art objects to the New Orleans Museum of Art, is also an icon enthusiast.

After the death of her husband, she married George Cornwallis-West in 1900. They were divorced in 1914. She then reverted to her title, Lady Spencer Churchill, which she retained after her 1918 marriage to Montagu Porch. Many important men were enamored of her, including Edward VII. (GvH 342)\n\n“Colonel” Charles Templeton Crocker (1884-1948) was the son of Charles Frederick Crocker of San Francisco and Jennie Easton. He was the grandson of Charles Crocker, one of the “Big Four” who built the Central Pacific Railroad. Crocker was known as a yachtsman, explorer, author, composer, and patron of the arts. In 1911, he married Hélà Irwin, and the couple (Mr. and Mrs. C. T. Crocker) are thought to have voraciously collected artworks during their two-year honeymoon in Europe. Part of the “ultra-fashionable” class of San Francisco, they took first place as hosts to nobility. Between 1912 and 1917 the Crockers built Uplands, a $1.6 million, thirty-nine room mansion at Rancho Las Pulgas, California, designed by Willis Polk in the neo-Renaissance style. The Crockers were divorced in 1925. (GvH 342)\n\nCunard, Lady Bache (Mrs. Emerald Cunard). Maude Burke (d. 1948) was born in San Francisco.

(GvH 342-3)\n\nD\n\nDavis, Florence see Dufferin (& Ava), Marchioness of Dr. George Dean, a family physician, and his wife Vivian, are avid collectors of chess sets. Among their treasures is a Fabergé set shown in the 2003 Art of Chess venue at the Gilbert Collection in London, and it was the feature selection in the “Ultimate Gifts Guide” of The Robb Report, December 2004. Provenance: The chess set was commissioned as a gift to the recipient during the ill-fated invasion of Manchuria in 1904, and is inscribed, “To warmly beloved and dear Commander General Adjutant Alexei Nikolaevich Kuropatkin in memory of Manchuria 1904-05 from those devoted and grateful to him.”\n\nDr. Dean enjoys telling about the purchase of this set from the late A. Kenneth Snowman in 1977. It seems the set had just been placed in a display case at Wartski, the adverts were ready to appear in two distinguished art journals (Apollo and Connoisseur, December 1977, ad pages 105 and 11, respectively) … and to this day the Fabergé set has been the pride and joy of these two collectors, along with a multitude of tearsheets from the two journals. Dr. Dean states that much to his dismay unauthorized reproductions made in Paris are on the market for $25,000. (03.08 | Summer 10)\n\nSir Esler Dening (1897-1977) had a long and distinguished career as a diplomat, and was the first post-war British Ambassador to Japan (1951-57).

In 1893, he married Marie Louise (1870-99), eldest daughter of Robert, Duke of Parma. The king adhered to the Roman Catholic faith in which he had been brought up, but his son and heir, the young Prince Boris, was changed to the Orthodox Greek Church in 1896 for political reasons. In 1908 Ferdinand married Eleanor (1860-1917), a princess in the house of Reuss. Later that year Ferdinand I proclaimed the independence of Bulgaria.\n\nA Fabergé Imperial presentation table snuff box with the cipher of Tsar Nicholas II first shown in an 1975 advertisement for Wartski (London) is accompanied with the often-repeated interchange between King Ferdinand, one of Fabergé great patrons, and Henry Charles Bainbridge, London Fabergé representative: ‘My dear Fabergé’, said King Ferdinand, ‘if you were in Bulgaria I would make you my minister’, and the reply ‘No, no, your Majesty, not politics, I beg of you; but minister of the goldsmith’s art, why yes, Sire, if you will it.’ (Bainbridge, 1949, 27)\n\nLater auction catalogs state that Tsar Nicholas presented the snuffbox to a Bulgarian diplomat for services leading to the declaration of Ferdinand I, King of Bulgaria. Fabergé used muted colors of the Bulgarian flag in the enamel on the box, and it sold for SFr 85000 (Christie’s Geneva, May 11, 1982, lot 340) and again a year later, for SFr 55000 (Sotheby’s Geneva, May 11, 1983, 315).\n\nHe abdicated in favor of his son Boris in 1918, and left for Coburg, Germany, where he died in 1948.

A Fabergé miniature stand with a portrait miniature of Ferdinand sold for SFr 66600 in the Thurn and Taxis sale.
