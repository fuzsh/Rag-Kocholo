Numerous historical high ranking political and armed forces figures are set within an audacious plot during the background of WW1.\n\nLenin, in 1918, encouraged the assassination of the only Romanov who undoubtedly could have changed the shape of 20th century history. The weaving of history into a credible ‘what if’ of the brother of the assassinated Tsar Nicholas II, which could have changed the whole order through his perilous two week round trip to the UK in 1918… and but for his assassination, the dream of freeing Russia from the early days of Communism… was ended.\n\nIt fulfils the readers need for a powerful story that transports us into the life and world of a tragic yet heroic figure in history. He was the very first of the Romanov Dynasty, preceding the fate of the ex-tsar Nicholas II and his family, to be assassinated…\n\nRumours, theories and tales of torture have echoed through the years, inspiring wild speculation, and fantastic claims of the ‘truth’ of the final days of Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovitch Romanov.\n\nThe Two lives of Grand Duke Michael is a unique epic novel that takes place in the first half of 1918 and challenges fact over fiction in this interplay of a historical drama, a tragic love story and an account of espionage and shocking state duplicity. It questions the accepted views in a compelling and entertaining read.\n\nThis novel draws on historical fact and imaginative thinking which creates his two lives and two wives in a ‘what if’ drama. The Grand Duke’s heroic attempts to defeat the emergence of Bolshevism and his subsequent assassination whilst under house arrest in the near Siberian city of Perm are a tragic ending to a life which could have changed the world order and avoided millions of deaths in those dark decades to come. Now this, the first comprehensive account, draws attention to the Grand Duke, who is understood to have briefly reigned as the last Tsar of Russia.\n\nAccording to contemporary accounts, Michael was seized from a hotel in Perm where he was sent into exile, and bundled into a carriage along with his secretary, loyal friend and confidante, Nicholas Johnson. They were then taken to a clearing in a forest outside the city. There they were assassinated.\n\nCrucially, the only undisputed fact is that no remains have ever been found, despite extensive searches in this century. The novel challenges the accepted account and paints a much different picture, with a careful and detailed revealing of Michael II’s survival against the odds, helped by British secret service officers, including Sidney Reilly of MI6 – the ‘Ace of Spies’ ‒ and the new life he built in the United Kingdom. He was given a new identity, and closely monitored by MI6, for whom he eventually worked at Bletchley Park.\n\nDrawing from historical documents and extensive research, the author makes interesting, controversial challenges to commonly held beliefs. He reveals the duplicity of Michael II’s first cousin, King George V of the United Kingdom and the government headed by David Lloyd George. The vivid narrative uses the author’s imagination, to construct a credible and exciting story of one of the greatest adventures in history.\n\nAntecedent\n\nWinter 2016. I am sitting at the bay window of a caravan which is sited on the east coast of Yorkshire, overlooking one of nature’s most beautiful bays. To the right I can see the rugged thirty four metre high limestone cliffs of Speeton towering over the rock-strewn beach below. To the left I can see the charming and unspoilt old fishing town of Filey, which today is a haven for thousands of discerning tourists each year, often accompanied by children and dogs.\n\nThe two hundred metres of soft golden sands at low tide, bordered by cobalt-coloured waters and blue skies from the left… scanning towards the right and seeing the thrashing waves on the defending Speeton Cliffs is a dichotomy of vibrating senses which excite the spirit.\n\nI am holding a pen in one hand and a 1912 nickel silver egg-shaped wristwatch in the other.\n\nI am about to reconstruct a story of monumental proportions, revealing events that took place in the early part of the last century which held the balance of fundamental and radical changes of the world order, played out by the younger brother of Tsar Nicholas II, the emerging fledgling Bolshevik regime and the Western Powers of the First World War.\n\nMy mind is slowly transported to the year of 1917… one hundred years ago.\n\nPrologue\n\nRussia in the New Year of 1917 was in anarchy and the threats to the existence of the Romanov Dynasty were becoming greater each day. The Russian Front in the war with Germany was collapsing, and food and munitions shortages were causing the people to demonstrate in the streets and outside Imperial buildings.\n\nA provisional government was formed in March 1917, due to the rising unpopularity of the Tsar and the Romanov Dynasty, and the consequence of Soviet and Bolshevik tendencies for a change of power in Russia. The intention was to exert sufficient pressure on Tsar Nicholas II to abdicate.\n\nHe did so on the evening of 15 March, in favour of his younger brother Grand Duke Michael who was at that time the commander of a very successful fighting division on the German‒Russian Front. Michael awoke the following morning to this news and was very concerned, as he had no previous knowledge or consultation with his brother Nicholas about any transfer of power. He firmly rejected this title, but did qualify this: he would only accept and carry out the duties of becoming the new Tsar if he were supported by a vote from the people and the acceptance of the interim government under the leadership of Alexander Kerensky.\n\nMichael was a popular choice as could be seen by the early rumours which quickly circulated the streets of Petrograd and filtered into Russia and the world. He was loved and feted by the population at large, especially as he had the confidence and support of the army and some other armed factions appearing in the discontented Russia. He was a unifying force for good even outside Russia; many Western Governments would have approved of his accession and certainly deemed him a man with whom they felt they could do business with.\n\nEvents however that day overtook the implications of Michael’s proposed accession, as the new government would not accept the handover of royal authority. Michael was relieved of his command in April 1917 and spent the rest of the year under surveillance or house arrest with his wife Natasha and their son George, always assisted by his faithful friend and secretary of the past five years, Nicholas Johnson, who was also a British citizen.\n\nAppendix I\n\nIntroducing the characters\n\nSir George Buchanan\n\nThe British Ambassador to Russia 1910–1917. Sir George Buchanan had developed a strong bond with Tsar Nicholas II and attempted to convince him that granting some constitutional reform would stave-off revolution. Buchanan actively supported the Duma in its efforts to change Russia’s stately system during wartime. He also facilitated activities of British spies, Reilly and Lockhart, in Russia..\n\nTsar Nicholas II\n\nNicholas II or Nikolai II was the last reigning Emperor of Russia, ruling from 1894 until his forced abdication on 15 March 1917 in favour of his brother, the Grand Duke Michael. His reign saw the fall of the Russian Empire from being one of the great powers of the world to one of economic and military collapse. Nicholas approved the Russian mobilization in 1914, which led to the causes of the fall of the Romanov Dynasty. He eventually took command of the armed forces after a series of catastrophic defeats. However, his influence had a negative effect, as he was neither a tactician nor a popular leader, and shortages of arms and food supplies soon led to the near-destruction of the forces in the field. Their saviour was the suing for peace with Germany at the hands of Lenin in 1918.\n\nFollowing the Revolution of 1917 and his abdication, the tsar and his family were imprisoned. In the summer of the following year, he and his family were eventually executed by the Bolsheviks on the night of 16–17 July 1918 in Ekaterinburg, a remote town in Central Russia.\n\nTsarina Alexandra Feodorovna\n\nShe was Empress of Russia as the spouse of Tsar Nicholas II, and a granddaughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. Alexandra was the last Tsarina of Russia. She was appalled at the declaration of war in 1914 and foretold that this would be the downfall of the delicately balanced Russian state, which had been fraught with revolutionary attempts to overthrow imperial rule. When Nicholas became head of the armed forces, he entrusted his wife with the governing of Russia in his absence.\n\nAlexandra had no experience of government and constantly appointed and reappointed incompetent ministers, which meant the government was never stable or efficient and led to the troops and civilian population being denied essential supplies of food and material. She paid attention to the self-serving advice of Grigori Rasputin, a Russian mystic, and their relationship was widely, though falsely, believed to be sexual in nature.\n\nHer reputation for influencing her husband’s resistance to the surrender of autocratic authority over the country severely damaged her popularity and that of the Romanov monarchy in its final years. This resulted in the Bolshevik revolutionaries murdering her, her family and her entourage in the summer of 1918 during their captivity in Central Russia.\n\nAlbert Stopford\n\nAlbert Henry Stopford, known as Bertie Stopford, was a British antiques and art dealer, who also specialised in the manufactured jewellery from the houses of Fabergé and Cartier. He was well known to the three British monarchs of the first part of the twentieth century.\n\nHe was an emissary for the British spy organisation M16 becoming the eyes and ears of Petrograd during the First World War. During the years leading to, and the war, he forged friendships with several high-ranking members of the Russian royal family, becoming an intimate friend of the Romanovs. He carried out many courier activities under the guise of his diplomatic immunity, transporting out of revolutionary Russia, vast quantities of wealth in antiques and jewellery.\n\nHe also assisted the British MI6 in intelligence gathering and supported Sidney Reilley in his clandestine Russian endeavours, implementing the Churchill plan to invade northern Russia.\n\nBruce Lockhart\n\nBruce Lockhart joined the British Foreign Service and was posted to Moscow as British Consul-General in early 1917, but left in October that year. He soon returned to Russia as the United Kingdom’s first envoy to the Bolsheviks in January 1918 and was also working for the Secret Intelligence Service. He set up a secret service agents system in Petrograd working with Sidney Reilly, his MI6 colleague where both were paving the way for the Allied invasion of Russia.\n\nIn 1918, Bruce Lockhart and Sidney Reilly were dramatically alleged to have plotted to assassinate Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin. He was arrested but he escaped trial due to an exchange of ‘secret agents‘.\n\nAlexander Kerensky.\n\nWhen the February Revolution broke out in 1917, Kerensky was one of its most prominent leaders in the newly formed Russian Provisional Government.\n\nAlexander Kerensky was a Russian lawyer and politician who was also serving as the Minister of Justice in the Provisional Government. He eventually became the Minister of War, and leader of the Socialist Revolutionary Party. Kerensky was a key political figure in the Revolution of 1917, but later in that same year his government was overthrown by the Lenin-led Bolsheviks during the October Revolution.\n\nGrand Duke Michael Alexandrovitch Romanov\n\nHe was the youngest son and fifth child of Emperor Alexander III of Russia and youngest brother of Tsar Nicholas II. In 1912, Michael shocked Nicholas by marrying the unpopular Natalia (Natasha) Wulfert, who had two previous marriages behind her. Nicholas, in anger, accused Michael of disloyalty to the pledges of the line of succession and exiled Michael to England and removed him from the line of succession.\n\nAfter the outbreak of World War I, Michael returned to Russia, assuming command of the ’Savage Division‘, which was a cavalry regiment. When Nicholas abdicated on 15 March 1917, Michael was named as his successor instead of Alexei. Michael, however, deferred acceptance of the throne until ratification by an elected assembly. He therefore became emperor for twelve hours. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, he was imprisoned and murdered in Perm in June 1918.\n\nNicholas Johnson\n\nNicholas Johnson was born in Russia in 1878. His father, a British citizen, was a captain in the Imperial Army being posted to the Royal Courts. He shared a love of music with the Anglophile Grand Duke Michael, who, like Nicholas, was also a graduate of the Mikhailovsky Artillery School. These connections and shared interests led to a deep friendship with Michael and he was given the nickname ‘Johnny’.\n\nSpeaking three languages, he was sociable, smiling, and an accomplished pianist, and would accompany the very musical Michael, who played several instruments, notably the guitar. In late 1912 the Grand Duke Michael chose Nicholas as his private secretary. He devoted himself to serving his master, and even in the face of certain death his loyalty never wavered. Thus, after the Revolution, Michael pleaded with his faithful servant to flee to Britain, as he was a British citizen, but Nicholas refused to leave his side.\n\nArrested at Gatchina outside St Petersburg on 7 March 1918, both were soon exiled to the city of Perm. On 13 June 1918, they were shot by a bloodthirsty rabble, probably by order of Lenin. As Nicholas lay dying, the wounded Michael went to his aid, begging the execution squad, ‘Let me say goodbye to my friend.’ Moments later, he too was dead, killed at point-blank range in the head. Their remains have never been found. Michael and Nicholas Johnson were canonised in 1981.\n\nCountess (Natalia)\n\nNatasha Brasova\n\nNatalia Brasova was a Russian noblewoman who married Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovitch of Russia. They were both exiled from Russia in 1912 and eventually, after a year of living in European hotels, went to England and lived there until the start of the war.\n\nAt that point Michael asked his brother if he could return and partake in duties of the war. This was accepted and in September 1914 he left Paddockhurst in Sussex and returned with Natasha and their son George, eventually settling back in the family home at Gatchina.\n\nNatasha founded two military hospitals and embarked on a mission of caring for wounded soldiers during her husband’s absence at the warfront. Now people in Russia started to accept her as a member of the Royal family. As the war began to go badly for the Russians, Natasha was dismayed by the change in Michael’s appearance; he abandoned his smart uniforms and decorations and wore a plain uniform with his muddy boots. Michael was upset by criticisms of his decision to be in the frontline of the war. He wrote to her, ‘the present time is so hard for Russia that my conscience could not allow me not to join the frontline service – and I am convinced that having done that, I also brought you some good in terms of public opinion, which, unfortunately, we can’t totally ignore.’\n\nDuring the Revolution in 1917, she endured the hardship of deprivation, house arrest and imprisonment from time to time with her husband. She continually fought Lenin for her husband’s release from house arrest in Perm, but was unsuccessful. After his murder in June 1918 she went into exile in England and then France to look after her son George and daughter Tata. Natasha never accepted that her husband had been murdered and chose to believe the accepted reason at that time for his disappearance in that he had escaped from imprisonment in Perm and was formulating plans to oust the Bolshevik government. Later in the early 1920s she at last accepted that he had not survived the imprisonment.\n\nShe died in poverty in 1952.\n\nGeorge Mikhailovich, Count Brasov\n\nGeorge Mikhailovich, Count Brasov was a Russian noble and a descendant of the House of Romanov through a morganatic line. His parents were Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovitch of Russia and his wife, Countess Brasova. He endured a great deal of movement and disturbance during the early Bolshevik years due to the harassment of his parents. He fled Russia in 1919 with his mother into exile in England to escape the dangers of the Revolution.\n\nHe was educated at Harrow. As he matured, many remarked at his strong resemblance to his father, and became heir apparent to the throne of Russia upon his father’s murder in 1918.\n\nOn a holiday in France he was involved in a car accident where he crashed into a tree. He sustained massive internal injuries and died without regaining consciousness in 1931.\n\nAlthough he had no succession rights due to the morganatic marriage of his parents, George was the last male-line descendant of Alexander III of Russia.\n\nSidney Reilly ‘Ace of Spies’\n\nSidney George Reilly, commonly known as the ‘Ace of Spies’, was a secret agent of the British Secret Service Bureau, the precursor to the modern British Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. He is alleged to have spied for at least four different powers. Reilly was heavily involved in the revolutionary years, in the main to facilitate and support the overthrow of the Bolshevik regime via the planned invasion of Russia by the Western Powers.\n\nReilly was a Russian Jew originally named Georgi Rosenblum and born in Odessa in 1873. He arrived in London in 1895, and was recruited into secret intelligence work for the Special Branch of the British Police. When Rosenblum married a wealthy heiress in mid-1898, he crafted a new identity for himself as Sidney Reilly.\n\nReilly was soon put to work spying in the Far East and in Russia, and after over twenty years of service he was formerly inducted into the Secret Intelligence Service, the forerunner to MI6, in 1918. During this period of secrecy and subterfuge Reilly very much fed into his own legend, claiming to have spied for several different countries across four continents and listing numerous supposed wives and mistresses. He certainly loved the high life, fast women, adventure, deception and gambling, and as such he became a very talented spy, in spite of his fabrications and exaggerations.\n\nDuring his covert operations and important information gathering, he also helped the Imperial families to escape whilst securing a wealth of their treasures. He was imprisoned with his colleague Sir Bruce Lockhart, but escaped. He was murdered on the orders of Stalin in 1925 in Russia.\n\nLater Ian Fleming used Reilly as a model for James Bond. Today many historians consider Reilly to have been the first twentieth-century ‘super-spy’. Much of what is thought to be known about him could be false, however, as Reilly was a master of deception, most of his life is shrouded in legend.\n\nThe Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna\n\nGrand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia was a cousin of Grand Duke Michael. She was a prominent hostess in St Petersburg in Russia and lived at the Vladimir Palace. Socially ambitious, it was there that she established her reputation as being one of the best hostesses in the capital. A family friend, Albert Stopford, rescued the jewels from her palace safe and smuggled them out of Russia.\n\nThe Grand Duchess held the distinction to be the last of the Romanovs to escape revolutionary Russia, as well as the first to die in exile. She made her way from Venice to Switzerland and then to France, where her health failed. Staying at her villa, she died on 6th September 1920 aged sixty-six.\n\nThe Grand Duchess had a passion for jewels, and her collection was renowned of which many were favoured pieces and some being owned by Catherine the Great. After the Duchess’ death, many were sold by her children to support their lives in exile. Amongst the new owners of distinction were Queen Mary of the United Kingdom and Queen Elizabeth II. Some of her emeralds were purchased by Barbara Hutton, and later by actress Elizabeth Taylor, who had them recut.\n\nJoseph (Novel Character)\n\nJoseph was a very trusted and long-serving member of the Vladimir Palace where the Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna resided during her married life. When the palace was vacated after Maria fled to the Crimea, the palace was put under guard and Joseph was required to stay on as caretaker. He noted that the palace was being used as a secret store for the Bolsheviks misappropriation of Imperial treasures, and assisted Albert Stopford in his quest to rescue the jewels of Maria Pavlovna.\n\nPeter Polotsov\n\nSenior officer in the Savage Division of the Russian Imperial Army and a close friend of Grand Duke Michael. He was transferred to the new Bolshevik-controlled army and posted to Petrograd as a commander in 1917. He arranged Michael’s exile with full permits for himself and family to travel to Finland. They packed valuables and prepared to move, but their escape was seen by Bolshevik sympathisers and they were placed once more under house arrest. He continued to help the family during 1918.\n\nWinston Churchill\n\nParliamentary Minister for Munitions to the British Government, Secretary of State for War and Air during 1917–1919. A major preoccupation of his tenure in the War Office was the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. Churchill was a staunch advocate of foreign intervention, declaring that Bolshevism must be ‘strangled in its cradle’. He created a plan to organise an Allied invasion of Russia in 1918.\n\nHe secured, from a divided and loosely organised Cabinet, intensification and prolongation of the British involvement in Russia, beyond the wishes of any major group in Parliament or the nation and in the face of the bitter hostility of the Labour party.\n\nDavid Lloyd George\n\nBritish Prime Minister from 1916. He was the last Liberal to serve as Prime Minister.\n\nLloyd George welcomed the fall of the tsar in a message to the new Russian Prime Minister Kerensky. Lloyd George gave a cautious welcome to the suggestion of the Russian Foreign Minister Pavel Milyukov that the toppled tsar and his family be given sanctuary in Britain. In April 1917, the British Government withdrew its consent under royal pressure. Eventually the Russian Royal Family were moved to the Urals where they were executed in 1918. Lloyd George was often blamed for the refusal of asylum.\n\nEthel Voynich\n\nEthel Lilian Voynich was an Anglo-Irish novelist and musician, and a supporter of several revolutionary causes. She was born in Cork, but grew up in England. Voynich was a significant figure, not only on the late Victorian literary scene, but also in Russian émigré circles. She is best known for her novel The Gadfly, which became popular in her lifetime, especially in Russia. It is said that she had an intense relationship with Sidney Reilly in 1895, and subsequently wrote the book with him as the main character in 1897.\n\nHowever, a noted biographer of Reilly, recalls that these were romanticised versions of such events and very doubtful, and counters instead that Reilly was perhaps informing on Voynich’s radical, pro-émigré activities to the Metropolitan Police Special Branch.\n\nThe novel was hugely popular in Soviet Russia, Communist China and Iran, and its study by educationalists and its compulsory reading exerted a cultural influence on these countries. By the time of her death, around 2.5m copies had been sold. An opera was created by a Russian composer, and later in 1955 Dmitri Shostakovich wrote the score for a major Russian film based on the novel. In Italy where the plot takes place, the book and opera are by and large unnoticed.\n\nShe died in New York in 1960 and was very much unaware of the popularity of her book until 1955 when she was visited in America by a Russian diplomat.\n\nPeter Carl Fabergé\n\nWhen Peter Carl took over the House, there was a move from producing jewellery in the then-fashionable French eighteenth-century style to becoming artist-jewellers. Fabergé’s production of the very first so-called Fabergé egg, the Hen Egg, given as a gift from the tsar to his wife Maria Fyodorovna on Easter of 1885, so delighted her that the Emperor assigned Fabergé the title Goldsmith by special appointment to the Imperial Crown of that year.\n\nIn light of the Empress’ response to receiving one of Fabergé’s eggs on Easter, the tsar commissioned Fabergé to make an Easter egg as a gift for her every year thereafter.The only stipulation was that each one should be unique and each should contain a surprise.\n\nUpon the death of Alexander III, his son, the next tsar, Nicholas II, followed this tradition and expanded it by requesting that there be two eggs each year, one for his mother (who was eventually given a total of thirty such eggs) and one for his wife, Alexandra (who received another twenty).\n\nIn 1916, the House of Fabergé became a joint-stock company with a capital of three million roubles.\n\nThe following year upon the outbreak of the October Revolution, the business was taken over by a ‘Committee of the Employees’. In 1918 the House of Fabergé was nationalised by the Bolsheviks and the stock was confiscated. The House of Fabergé was no more.\n\nAfter the nationalisation of the business, Carl Fabergé left St Petersburg on the last diplomatic train for Riga in Latvia. The Revolution soon reaching Latvia, he fled to Germany and later travelled to Switzerland.\n\nPeter Carl Fabergé never recovered from the shock of the Russian Revolution. He died in Switzerland on September 24, 1920 in relative poverty and ignominy from his past status. His family believed he died of a broken heart.\n\nCollenius Johannsen aka\n\nGrand Duke Michael\n\nThis was the undercover name used by Grand Duke Michael during his travels around Europe in disguise with Sidney Reilly and Olga Bystrovia. His disguise was complemented by wearing a wig which altered his receding hairline and dark glasses to subdue glare (and hide nerves) He was posing as a Finnish diplomat working with the new Bolshevik regime. His papers were forged and supported that covert guise.\n\nBoris aka Nicholas Johnson\n\nThis was one of the names used by Nicholas Johnson during his travels around Europe in disguise as a low-ranking soldier with little or no papers; he took the guise of a support and ‘gofor’ to Reilly and Olga Bystrovia. It was important that he seemed to have no connection with Michael as, if it was discovered by the Cheka, Russian State Secret Police that they had left Russia, then the lookout would be for two people, tall and short. This dissemination of the link between both would aid the deception they were casting.\n\nOrlov Volkov Revieski aka\n\nSidney Reilly\n\nThis was the undercover name used by Sidney Reilly during his exploits in Russia in aiding Grand Duke Michael and Johnson to escape from and return back into Russia in February 1918.\n\nOlga Bystrovia (Novel Character) aka Hannah Chudasama\n\nShe was working for MI6 in 1917 and her guise was that of a Senior Commander Commissar possessing authority based on party ideology with powers to arrest from suspicions of non-conformity to ideology and doctrine.\n\nShe was an expert in several European languages, and was adept in mathematics and creative thinking. Known for her coolness under stress she could marginalise aggression in opponents through her wit and charm. Together with her planning and strategic thinking, Hannah was key in assisting Sidney Reilly in his Russian theatre of operations and post settlement of Imperial families in exile. In her post-war years, after decommissioning from MI6, she chose to continue using her covert operational code name, Olga Bystrovia.\n\nOlaf (Novel Character)\n\nHe was a chief engineer with a team of contractors from Sweden. The revolutionary government employed them to supply and install the very latest development of marine engines into the reconstruction of the Royal Yatch Standart. This boat was misappropriated by the Bolsheviks to destroy any reflections and emblems of Imperialism, but also to convert the boat into a minesweeping frigate.\n\nAble Seaman, Basil Baldric (Novel Character)\n\nThis was his name as an undercover agent with MI6 who was commissioned to travel with Jack Blackman on board the HMS Iron Duke to rendezvous with Grand Duke Michael in the Barents Sea.\n\nBaldric was a very intelligent strategist and his unassuming character, as a low-ranking navel recruit would disarm Michael and Johnson. His understanding of several languages also allowed him to listen in on the bugged cabin which they shared.\n\nHis prime responsibility was to monitor their views and intentions. A major issue was to discover if they had been able to bring with them the quantity of Romanov treasure which Reilly and Stopford had reported on, as a contribution to the prosecution of the coming invasion by the Allies at Archangel.\n\nJack Blackman – Adderley (Novel Character)\n\nThis was his name as an undercover agent with MI6 who was commissioned to travel with Basil Baldric on board the HMS Iron Duke. He was the official face of"
