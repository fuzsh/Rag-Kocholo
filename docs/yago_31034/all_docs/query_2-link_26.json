The image, taken by an unknown photographer, is preserved in the Russian State Archive of Film and Photo Documents, Moscow. The grand duke is seated facing forward, dressed in military uniform and holding a young child on his left knee. Mikhail Nikolaevich was governor-general of Caucasia for almost 20 years, with his seat in Tbilisi. He was a field marshal and chairman of the State Council of Russia from 1881 to 1905. His marriage to Olga Feodorovna, formerly Princess CaÌˆcilie of Baden, took place in 1857 and resulted in seven children.",
