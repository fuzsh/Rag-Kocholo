Blues best post-war players from north of the border rated

The road south of the border from Scotland to Goodison Park used to be a well-trodden path but while the conveyor belt has slowed down in recent years, Everton have always enjoyed a rich heritage for Caledonian imports.

Anyone who witnessed the recent World Cup qualifier against the Auld Enemy at Wembley will appreciate how dramatically the well has dried up for the Scots but many of their most gifted individuals have swapped navy blue for royal blue to shine on Merseyside.

‌

The captain of Everton's first title-winning side in 1891 was Dumbartonshire-born Andrew Hannah whose team-mates included the likes of compatriots Alec Brady and Dan Doyle.

The Blues first FA Cup-winning side in 1906 was skippered by 456-game club stalwart Jack Taylor who hailed from Dumbarton while the trophy was secured by a goal from a fellow Scot, the original Alex Young, known as 'Sandy'.

Glaswegian Bobby Parker was top scorer in the 1915 title-winning campaign while the Inter-War period produced legends such as Hunter Hart, Alec Troup, Jimmy Dunn, Jimmy Stein, Jock Thomson and Torry Gillick.

Comparing the merits of stars from such a distant bygone era is always difficult but to mark St Andrew's Day we've compiled a Top 10 Tartan Talents of post-war Everton players.

Honourable mentions go to the likes of Steven Naismith, Pat Nevin, George Wood, Stuart McCall, Gary Naysmith and the late Alex Scott who was part of the 1966 FA Cup-winning side who all missed out on the cut.

The rest of the sporting world associate the name David Weir with the prolific gold medal-winning Paralympian of the same name but Everton's version was one of Walter Smith's best bargain buys.

Running his contract down at Hearts when the Blues plucked him for just £250,000 in February 1999 – reputedly under the noses of neighbours Liverpool – Weir became the mainstay of Everton's defence for over seven years, playing 269 games.

‌

One of Scotland's most talented midfielders of his generation, Asa Hartford is perhaps best remembered for failing a medical to join Leeds United from West Brom in 1971 due to a condition known as 'a hole in the heart'.

Hartford would eventually quit the Hawthorns for Manchester City in 1974 but arrived at Goodison in 1979 via an ill-fated three-game stint at Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest.

‌

Skilful and industrious, Hartford became a popular figure with Blues supporters but in truth he wasn't fully able to produce his top form for them and after 98 appearances and seven goals, new boss Howard Kendall sent him back to Maine Road in 1981.

If only Everton had signed Richard Gough a decade earlier.

‌

A natural leader, he captained Rangers to their nine Scottish titles in a row but after a short but after a couple of stints in the USA, a short but successful loan spell at Nottingham Forest convinced his former Ibrox boss Smith that Gough still had enough left in the tank for an English top flight comeback at the age of 37.

With Goodison veteran Dave Watson alongside him on the opening day of the 1999/2000 season, Everton's centre-back partnership had a combined age of over 75 years.

‌

Gough made 32 appearances throughout his first campaign and was appointed skipper but time finally caught up with him the following season when he was restricted to just nine outings.

7.

A granite hard wing-half who Alex Young claimed would “walk through a brick wall and just blink”, Jimmy Gabriel turned out 301 times for the Blues in the 1960s.

‌

Snapped up from home town club Dundee, he collected both a League Championship and FA Cup winners' medal while with Harry Catterick's side.

Later in his career he moved to Seattle Sounders and he is now based in the Pacific North West region in retirement but in between he had a couple of spells as caretaker manager at Everton either side of Howard Kendall's second stint in charge.

A fist-pumping, chest-thumping icon of Everton in the nineties and noughties, Duncan Ferguson came second in an ECHO poll this month to name the Blues best player of the Premier League era.

Virtually unbeatable in the air, the man from Stirling was the perfect centre-forward on his day but the problem was coaxing out those performances on a regular basis for a player who often lacked consistency.

‌

Hampered by injury problems, Ferguson who totalled 72 goals in 273 appearances over two spells, only twice hit double figures in a season for Everton but his passionate approach, especially in Merseyside Derbies, ensures he remains a hugely-popular figures with many supporters.

5.

Despite playing in an era of great wingers such as Tom Finney and Stanley Matthews, Alex Parker was known for his terrific composure at right-back.

‌

The man from Irvine was lauded as elevating the sliding tackle into an art form with his impeccable sense of timing compensating for any lack of pace.

A member of Everton's 1963 title-winning side, playing 291 games in total, off the pitch he was a long-time close friend of Liverpool manager Bill Shankly.

One of many stars Evertonians muse that the Blues let go too soon, 'Pocket General' Bobby Collins went on to collect the Football Writers' Association Player of the Year award with his next club Leeds United.

The 5ft 4in inside forward could have been an Everton player as a youngster but returned 'homesick' to his native Glasgow as a 16-year-old and was forced to serve a six-week ban by the Scottish FA.

‌

When Collins finally returned to Goodison from Celtic aged 27 it made front page news in the ECHO who declared: “He can go a great part of the way in restoring Everton's glamour.”

Collins' two full seasons with the Blues produced goal returns of 14 and 17 respectively but after 48 strikes in 147 outings he made way for Dennis Stevens when he was 31 in March 1962.

He would later feature in an iconic photo alongside Brian Labone during the infamous 'Battle of Goodison' in November 1964 when the referee took both sides off the field for a 'cooling off period'.

The mere written record of 22 goals in 68 appearances doesn't do justice to the enormous impact at Everton that Andy Gray had between 1983-85.

Many observers felt that the Braveheart striker – who was born on St Andrew's Day in 1955 – had his best days behind him when Howard Kendall paid Wolves £250,000 for his services but he helped transform the Blues into winners.

‌

His strike partner and fellow Glaswegian Graeme Sharp said: “He was just the sort of character we needed, He was terrific, a breath of fresh air and you could hear him long before you saw him.

“He had an unbelievable will and a desire to win football matches.”

Gray scored in both the 1984 FA Cup final and 1985 European Cup-Winners' Cup final as well as netting iconic headed goals against Sunderland and Notts County – virtually on the ground.

‌

His popularity at Goodison was such that there was uproar when Kendall replaced him with a certain Gary Lineker in the summer of 1985.

2.

Only Dixie Dean who scored 383 times for Everton (more than any other player has netted for any English club) has bagged more goals for the Blues than Graeme Sharp .

‌

Intelligent on and off the field, Sharp netted 160 times in 447 outings for Everton and was top scorer with 30 in 1984/85, the first of his two League Championship-winning seasons.

He also netted in the 1984 FA Cup final success and was part of the 1985 European Cup-Winners' Cup winning side.

‌

Sharp's adaptability for over a decade's service at Goodison saw him strike up fruitful partnership with a series of different frontmen and he is also fondly remembered for scoring arguably the greatest goal of all-time in a Merseyside Derby to beat Liverpool 1-0 at Anfield in October 1984.

There were spells at Oldham Athletic and Welsh club Bangor City in the mid-1990s but for the most part, Everton, who Sharp now serves as a club ambassador, have been part of the Glaswegian's life since 1980.

Has there ever been a player as adored by a set of supporters as Alex Young , the footballing deity dubbed 'The Golden Vision' by Evertonians?

‌

Such was the Goodison hero worship of Young that he became the subject of a Ken Loach television film several decades before football entered the national consciousness of popular culture.

Although he wasn't the typical blood and thunder type of centre-forward that Blues had grown to love in the mould of Dean, Tommy Lawton or Dave Hickson, Young transfixed Goodison crowds with the clever, artistic beauty of his play.

‌

Despite suffering chronically throughout his career with blisters, Young netted 87 times in 273 games for Everton and there were famously calls for manager Catterick's head when he dropped him in favour of teenage debutant Joe Royle.

Delicate health prevents Young from making many journeys far from his Edinburgh home these days but only this month he was back at Goodison in conjunction with a commemorative DVD that had produced in his honour over 38 years after he departed Merseyside.

‌

A humble genius, Young says: “I left Everton Football Club in 1968 but I can honestly say that Everton has never left me.”
