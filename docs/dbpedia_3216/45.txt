Courier columnist Rab Douglas and four other Dark Blues legends were inducted into the Dundee FC Hall of Fame on Friday night.

Fans joined current and former players and club officials at the Invercarse hotel, and were entertained by speakers Alan Rough and Peter C Brown.

The four former footballers joined 39 other club grandees, including Jocky Scott, Barry Smith and Sir Bobby Cox in Dundee’s Hall of Fame 2017.

Shot-stopper Douglas was joined in the club’s hall of greats by Alec Troup, league winner Alex Stuart, League Cup winner Thomson Allan and 1991 Challenge Cup winner Keith Wright.

Troup, who played for the club in the 1920’s, was born in Forfar and played for the Dees and Everton as a winger and was awarded the club’s heritage award

Alex Stuart spent a decade with Dundee, having joined the club as a youngster in 1958. Stuart received a Golden Era award at the Hall of Fame event, recognising the part he played in the Dens Park side’s most successful squad.

Goalkeeper Thomson Allan played in the side which beat Celtic to the League Cup final in 1973. Allan was also the last Dundee keeper to be capped for the Scotland national squad, and was awarded one of two Legends awards on the night.

Fellow Legends award inductee Keith Wright played for the team in the late 1980’s and the early 1990’s, winning the Challenge Cup in 1991 and scoring 75 goals in 197 appearances for the Dark Blues.

Fan favourite Rab Douglas was given the Modern Hero award, in recognition for his two spells with the club, and the part he played in the club’s “Deefiant” season in the 2010-11 campaign – which saw the Dees stave off relegation after a points deduction with a 23-game unbeaten run.
