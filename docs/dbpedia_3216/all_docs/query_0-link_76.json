        "text": "Monday, January 22 – 1923\n\nNeil McBain, the Scottish centre half-back of Manchester United, who was transferred from Ayr United last season at a cost of £4,500, was last night transferred to Everton, for whom he will appear on Saturday against Stoke.\n\nThe amount of the transfer fee has not transpired, but it may be taken for granted that he United officials have not lost anything on the deal. McBain was placed on the transfer list at his own request a few days ago.\n\nThe transfer has created a great deal of indignation among the people who follow the fortunes of Manchester United, and the Supporters’ Club – said to be several thousand strong – are holding a meeting tonight to discuss the departure of McBain and the events that led up to it.\n\nUntil the recent trouble arose McBain had rendered yeoman service at half-back and forward for the United. He played for Scotland against England last season.\n\nWhen Frank Barson came to Manchester United McBain relinquished the captaincy to him, and for several matches played at left half. At the request of the directors, he agreed to play in the forwards for a time, but expressed a desire to return to the half-back line as soon as possible.\n\nLast week it was rumoured that McBain would go to Manchester City, but this proved incorrect. Since then several leading clubs have been in negotiation for his transfer."
