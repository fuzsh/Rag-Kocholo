Ex-Spur Nick Barmby glanced a shot against the bar and Spurs were further hampered, when the injured Campbell had to be replaced before half-time.\n\nSpurs had a good opportunity in the 56th minute, when Ramon Vega headed over when well-placed from Scales' header back into the box at Ginola's corner. Fortunately, he was more accurate in the 72nd minute, when he was on hand to put Andy Sinton's cross into the net. When David Ginola ripped a shot past the keeper following a mazy run to make it 2-0, Spurs had the points sewn up.\n\nTeams :\n\nEverton : - Neville Southall, Nick Barmby, Duncan Ferguson Spurs : - Walker, Carr, Wilson, Vega, Campbell (Scales), Sinton, Fox, Calderwood, Ginola, Ferdinand (Iversen), Nielsen (Anderton)\n\nUnused Subs. : - Baardsen, R.

Allan Nielsen's effort was saved acrobatically by Neville Southall. At the other end, Ian Walker saved from Duncan Ferguson and Graham Stuart, while Nick Barmby hit a shot into the side-netting.

Everton scored with goal from Daniel Amokachi 2, Graham Stuart and Matt Jackson, while Spurs' consolation goal came from a Jurgen Klinsmann penalty.\n\nJackson opened the scoring with a header from a 35th minute corner, getting across Stuart Nethercott to beat Ian Walker at his near post. It was into the second half that Graham Stuart doubled the lead on 55 minutes and although Dave Watson pulled down Teddy Sheringham for Klinsmann to score from the spot, substitute Daniel Amokachi scored twice in the last twenty minutes to see the Toffees through to the final.\n\nTeams :\n\nEverton : - Neville Southall, Matt Jackson, David Watson (c), David Unsworth, Gary Ablett, Anders Limpar, Andy Hinchcliffe, Joe Parkinson, Barry Horne, Paul Rideout (Daniel Amokachi 71), Graham Stuart Unused Subs. : - Jason Kearton, Tony Grant\n\nManager : Joe Royle\n\nSpurs : - Walker, Austin, Calderwood, Mabbutt (c), Nethercott (Rosenthal 84), Popescu, Howells, Anderton, Barmby, Sheringham, Klinsmann\n\nUnused Subs. : - Thorstvedt, Cundy\n\nManager : Ossie Ardiles\n\nRef. : - Robbie Hart\n\nCrowd : - 38,226\n\n17.12.1994 -\n\nTeams :\n\nEverton : Southall, Jackson, Burrows, Watson, Unsworth, Horne, Ebbrell, Parkinson (Limpar), Rideout, Barlow, Hinchcliffe\n\nUnused Subs. : - ,\n\nSpurs : Walker, Austin, Campbell, Howells, Calderwood, Mabbutt, Anderton, Popescu, Rosenthal, Sheringham, Barmby\n\nUnused Subs. : - ,\n\nCrowd : - 32,809\n\n24.08.1994 Another outstanding goal-scoring master-class by Jurgen Klinsmann saw off Everton in this Premier League match.\n\nTeddy Sheringham nearly gave Spurs the lead when he reached Kerslake's cross and diverted the ball up onto the bar and then reacted quickly, but his header just went over the bar. In the 27th minute, David Kerslake broke down the right wing to cross into the box. The ball fell at the far post, where Sheringham knocked it back, Nethercott headed down and Klinsmann leapt to scissor kick the ball past Southall with great power.\n\nWith 35 minutes gone, another Kerslake cross flicked off Sheringham's head and Klinsmann reacted well to the speeding ball to direct it just inside the post to give Tottenham a 2-0 advantage. Just before the break an Unsworth handball in the box gave Sheringham the chance to make the lead even greater, but his penalty kick was blazed over the top.\n\nEverton did get back into the game in the second half, when a quick free-kick was played to John Ebbrell, who bent the ball round the Spurs defence for Paul Rideout to slide in at the far post to narrow the lead.\n\nTeams :\n\nSpurs: Walker, Kerslake, Nethercott (Mabbutt), Campbell, Anderton, Barmby, Dumitrescu (Hazard), Calderwood, Klinsmann, Sheringham\n\nEverton: Neville Southall, David Unsworth, John Ebbrell, Vinny Samways, Paul Rideout\n\nCrowd : - 24,553\n\n26.03.1994 -\n\nTeams :\n\nEverton : - , , , Unused Subs. : - ,\n\nSpurs : - , , , , , Sedgley, , ,\n\nUnused Subs. : - ,\n\nCrowd : - 23,580\n\n03.10.1993 A stirring end to this match saw Spurs grab a late winner to disappoint a spirited Everton side in the Premier League at White Hart Lane.\n\nPaul Rideout's 16th minute goal was equalised by Teddy Sheringham's firm header from Danny Hill's 59th minute cross, but the lead for Everton was regained by Cottee's 68th minute penalty. The penalty detracted from Gary Mabbutt's day, as it was his 500th appearance for Tottenham and it was him who brought the former West Ham United striker to the ground to concede the spot-kick.\n\nThe game seemed to be slipping away from Tottenham, but Darren Anderton grabbed what seemed to be a point in the 89th minute with a finish to Sedgley's cross and Sheringham's nod down. However, the Spurs fans in the crowd (and the Sky TV audience in front of their TVs) went wild when Darren Caskey shot home through a crowd of players in the area at the Paxton end to net the winner in the second minute of added time.\n\nTeams :\n\nSpurs : - Thorstvedt, , , Mabbutt, , , , Anderton, Sedgley, Hill, Caskey, Sheringham\n\nEverton : - Neville Southall, , , , , Paul Rideout, Tony Cottee\n\nCrowd : - 27,487\n\n10.02.1993 Spurs edged a Premier League meeting with Everton at Goodison Pak by two goals to one.\n\nGary Mabbutt gave Spurs a 26th minute lead when his good run found him unmarked to head in Darren Anderton's left wing corner. The home side pulled level just three minutes later when the ball was played across to Kenny Samson on the left and his cross-shot beat Thorstvedt from the edge of the box.\n\nBut Spurs hit back to score the winning goal that started with a Pat van den Hauwe long throw in the 69th minute. It was headed on by Anderton and Paul Allen found himself eight yards out to slice a volley past Neville Southall to give Tottenham a 2-1 victory.\n\nTeams :\n\nEverton : - Neville Southall, Alan Harper (Mo Johnson 62), Kenny Samson, Matt Jackson, Dave Watson (c), Gary Ablett, Billy Kenny (Preki Radosavljevic 30), Peter Beardsley, Tony Cottee, Paul Rideout, Barry Horne\n\nUnused Subs. : - ,\n\nManager : - Howard Kendall\n\nSpurs : - Thorstvedt, Austin (van den Hauwe 51), Edinburgh, Samways, Ruddock, Mabbutt (c), Howells, Andy Gray (Nayim 67), Anderton, Sheringham, Paul Allen\n\nUnused Subs. : - Walker\n\nManager : - Doug Livermore/Ray Clemence\n\nCards : - Ruddock (yellow) 58\n\nCrowd : - 16,164\n\nRef. : - Keren Barrett (-)\n\nLinesmen : -\n\n05.09.1992 Tottenham's captain for the day Paul Allen was on the mark to pull Spurs back into this first ever Premier League meeting with Everton at White Hart Lane.\n\nPeter Beardsley scored to give Everton a 1-0 lead in the 42nd minute when he ran away from the Spurs defence down the left, to slot home past Ian Walker, who got a hand to the ball, but could not stop it.\n\nThings looked black for Spurs with only 11 minutes left, but a long throw from Andy Gray led to Gordon Durie having a cross-shot that was touched on by Sheringham, with Neville Southall saving, but Paul Allen hit the loose ball past Southall to level the scores and a point looked the likely outcome for Tottenham. The introduction of Andy Turner from the bench to make his debut changed the course of the game. As Spurs pressed forward and won a few late corners, one dropped just inside the box at the far post and Turner struck the ball as it bounced up, waist-high and it ripped into the net for a late winner gave Spurs the points and made him the youngest scorer in the Premier League at the time aged 17 years and 166 days - a record that stood for five years.\n\nTeams :\n\nSpurs : - Walker, Austin, Cundy, Tuttle, van den Hauwe, Anderton (Turner), P.

The goal took Everton top of the table, while Spurs were down in 13th place.\n\nTeams :\n\nEverton: Neville Southall, Gary Stevens, Pat van den Hauwe, Kevin Ratcliffe (c), Neil Pointon, Trevor Steven, Peter Reid, Paul Bracewell, Kevin Richardson, Graeme Sharp, Gary Lineker\n\nSpurs: Clemence, G.

Although Graham Roberts scored a pile-driver from 25 yards out in the 73rd minute, Tottenham could not force an equaliser and finished the game on the attack, but with no reward.\n\nTeams :\n\nSpurs: , , , Gary Stevens, Roberts, , , , Falco, ,\n\nEverton: Neville Southall, Gary Stevens, Andy Gray, Trevor Steven\n\nCrowd : - 48,108\n\n25.08.1984 A sparkling win on the opening day of the season saw Spurs stun the European Cup Winners Cup holders.\n\nNew manager Peter Shreeves threw new signings Clive Allen and John Chiedozie into the side and they made an immediate impact. Adrian Heath's penalty put Spurs behind in the 16th minute, but Tottenham pulled level with Mark Falco scoring in the 39th minute.\n\nWithin two minutes, Clive Allen had opened his goalscoring account for the club and then was joined in the debut scoring six minutes after the interval, when Chiedozie hit the net to make it 3-1 to Tottenham. When Allen hit the fourth Spurs goal, it rounded off a fine first afternoon of the season for the side against the side who won the title at the end of the season.\n\nTeams :\n\nEverton: Neville Southall, , , Gary Stevens, , , Trevor Steven, Andy Gray, Graeme Sharp\n\nSpurs: Thorstvedt, Bergsson, Sedgley, Mabbutt, Tuttle, Nayim (Howells), Stewart, Samways (Hendon), P.

He held off two players and turned to smash a low bouncing shot past the keeper from 25 yards out.\n\nTeams :\n\nSpurs : - Clemence, Hughton, O'Reilly, Roberts, Price, Perryman (c), Mabbutt, Falco, Galvin, Brooke, Crooks (Brazil)\n\nEverton : - Jim Arnold, John Bailey, Kevin Ratcliffe, Mark Higgins, Alan Harper, Peter Reid (Kevin Richardson), Kevin Sheedy, Trevor Steven, Adrian Heath, David Johnson, Graeme Sharp\n\nRef : -\n\nCrowd : - 27,487\n\nEverton kicked towards the Park Lane end in the first half.\n\n19.02.1983 Spurs slipped to a 0-2 defeat at Goodison Park in the Fifth Round of the FA Cup.\n\nTeams :\n\nEverton : - Jim Arnold, John Bailey, Gary Stevens, Kevin Ratcliffe, Mark Higgins, Alan Irvine, Andy King, Kevin Richardson, Kevin Sheedy, Adrian Heath, Graeme Sharp\n\nSpurs : - Clemence, Hughton, Lacy, Price, Villa (Hoddle), Perryman, Galvin, Mabbutt, Gibson, Hazard, Crooks\n\nRef : -\n\nCrowd : - 42,995\n\n10.04.1982 - 04.04.1981 Everton took the first half and Spurs the second as the spoils were shared in this First Division match.\n\nAsa Hartford gave Everton the lead at White Hart Lane after fourteen minutes, with Imre Varadi returning to the club where he was a junior to double the Toffees lead on the half hour.

John Pratt put Spurs ahead in this match, which Tottenham should really have won. 25 minutes were on the clock when Hoddle chipped the ball through for Conn, but he was baulked off the ball by McNaught. It ran loose to Bernard, whose loose pass was blocked by Pratt, who was first to the rebound and slotted into an empty net from the 18 yard line.\n\nEverton looked to get back into the game with McNaught's ball into Lyons laid off on the volley for Hamilton to drive at goal, but Jennings caught it at full length on the dive to his right. Dai Davies was brought into action to tip over Peter Taylor's 25 yard shot that was arrowing into the top corner, but he couldn't stop Don McAllister netting the second goal on 36 minutes, as Pratt's corner from the left saw him run in unmarked to head home from six yards out.\n\nIt was into the second half when Everton pulled a goal back, with McNaught's chipped ball forward chested down for King by Lyons and the midfielder's shot was heavily deflected past Jennings. McNaught was on defensive duty when Conn played a one-two with Perryman and was only denied a good opportunity by the Everton centre-half. Naylor broke up an Everton attack and then played it to Conn, who put Duncan away on right, hitting an early shot that Davies kept out with his legs, but Alfie was there again to get on the end of McAllister's ball through the middle and pushed it past Davies before being brought down for a penalty. The spot kick was scored by Keith Osgood with a fierce shot just to Davies' right in the 73rd minute.\n\nHowever, a late flurry from Everton saw them net two goals in the last few minutes to secure a point at 3-3. Lyons had gone close before Latchford flicked on a free kick at the near post to allow McNaught to head in from close range with four minutes remaining. McNab had a chance to put the game beyond Everton's reach, when Perryman brought the ball forward and put the youngster down the right side. He jinked inside and shot, but the ball flashed across the six yard box.\n\nTrying to run the clock down, Taylor and Pratt were playing keep ball high on the left wing, until they lost possession and it was quickly played through the middle by King to Latchford, who lifted over the diving Jennings as he came out to meet him to grab a share of the points with all but the last kick of the game.\n\nTeams :\n\nSpurs : - Jennings; Naylor, Willie Young, Osgood, McAllister; Hoddle, Pratt, Perryman (cpt), Taylor; Duncan (McNab), Conn\n\nEverton : - Dai Davies, Micky Bernard, Mick Lyons, Ken McNaught, David Jones, Andy King, Martin Dobson, Bryan Hamilton, George Telfer, Bob Latchford, Ronnie Goodlass\n\nSub : Terry Darracott\n\nRef : - Ray Toseland (Kettering) Linesmen : Mr. - (-) - Red flag; Mr. - (-) - Yellow flag\n\nCrowd : - 26, 047\n\nGoal times\n\nFirst goal  25m 32s\n\nSecond goal - 35m 45s\n\nThird goal  55m 49s\n\nSpurs attacked the Paxton Road end in the first half.\n\n..19 .\n\nTeams :\n\nEverton : - , ,\n\nSpurs : - , , , , , , , , , ,\n\nRef : -\n\nCrowd : - ,\n\n24.02.1976 .\n\nTeams :\n\nEverton : - , ,\n\nSpurs : - , , , , , , , , , ,\n\nRef : -\n\nCrowd : - ,\n\n10.12.1975 Goals from John Pratt and John Duncan cancelled out those from George Telfer and Bob Latchford to earn a point in this First Division encounter at the Lane.\n\nJohn Pratt had given Spurs the lead and John Duncan headed home Tottenham's second goal at the Paxton Road end, coming in at the far post to a left wing cross.\n\nWillie Young went close with a diving header after Dai Davies had been caught out of position by a cross.\n\nTeams :\n\nSpurs : - Jennings, Naylor, Knowles, Pratt, Young, Osgood, Coates (McNab), Perryman (cpt), Duncan, Chris Jones, Neighbour\n\nEverton : - Dai Davies, Terry Darracott, Steve Seargeant (Mick Buckley), Mick Lyons, Mike Bernard, Roger Kenyon, Dave Clements, Bryan Hamilton, Martin Dobson, Bob Latchford, George Telfer\n\nManager : Billy Bingham\n\nRef.

The Buckle goal set Spurs back, but Sonny Walters played a cross into Les Medley, who took the ball around goalie to score the winning goal in the 64th minute.\n\nTeams :\n\nEverton : - Burnett, Fielding, Buckle\n\nSpurs : - , , , , , , , Baily, Medley, , Walters\n\nRef : -\n\nCrowd : - 47,125\n\n11.02.1950 Everton edged this FA Cup Fifth Round tie at Goodison Park, with the only goal of the game taking them through.\n\nWhile at the bottom end of the table, Everton were facing the Spurs \"Push and Run\" side, but caused an upset when Eddie Wainwright scored from the penalty spot to give the home team an early lead.\n\nWhile Tottenham began to put some good moves together, it was the back line of the Toffees who came out on top, with Jackie Grant, Dave Falder and Peter Farrell performing staunchly in defence.\n\nTeams :\n\nEverton : - Burnett, Moore, Hadley, Grant, Falder, Farrell, Buckle, Wainwright, Catterick, Fielding, Eglington\n\nSpurs : - Ditchburn, Ramsey, Withers, Nicholson, Clarke, Burgess, Walters, Rees, Duquemin, Baily, Medley\n\nRef : -\n\nCrowd : - 72,291\n\nReceipts : £9,760\n\n..19 .\n\nTeams :\n\nEverton : - , ,\n\nSpurs : - , , , , , , , , , ,\n\nRef : -\n\nCrowd : - ,\n\n22.02.1937 Torrential rain left the pitch sodden, so the ground-staff worked wonders to get the game playable for Second Division Spurs to face up against Everton - lingering in the lower reaches of Division 1 - in a Fifth round FA Cup replay.\n\nWithin 20 minutes, Everton took a 2-0 lead with goals from Tommy Lawton and Dixie Dean. Johnny Morrison grabbed a goal seven minutes later to give Spurs a way back, but a linesman helped even further just after half time. Dean was fouled in the box and the referee pointed to the penalty spot, but on conferring with his colleague, overturned his decision to give a foul throw against Everton in the build up to the incident. Spurs were also denied, this time when an equaliser was ruled out for a foul by Morrison on the keeper before netting.\n\nIt looked as though Spurs were out of it, as Everton broke to the other end of the pitch in the 63rd minute and Dean scored to give the Toffees a 3-1 lead. A couple of minutes later, Joe Meek set Morrison away to beat an offside trap and close the gap to one goal again. With five minutes remaining, Morrison returned the favour and Meek scored to make it 3-3 to send the 46,972 crowd wild. The momentum was now in Spurs' favour and when Morrison headed home Miller's cross with barely enough time to restart the match, his hat-trick had completed an amazing comeback to go through to the 6th round.\n\nSpurs: J.
