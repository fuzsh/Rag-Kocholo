But don’t shower next to Taffy or you’ll get fag ash between your toes.\n\nAlex Young\n\nFOREWORD BY\n\nBill Kenwright\n\nLIKE MANY SCOUSERS, LIKE MANY KIDS OF THE 1950S, LIKE MANY Evertonians, my world is full of memories. Dave Hickson will always be the greatest centre-forward of them all; Alan Ladd’s Shane will always be the greatest Western of them all; Elvis will always be in a different stratosphere. All three, plus a small elite few, will live with me until the day I say goodbye to this world and its memories. Royston will always be amongst that hallowed group.\n\nI was just into my teens when he signed for us, in that wonderful period from the late 50s to the early 60s when we seemed to add another gem every other month. Roy was a part of the first group, alongside Tommy Ring and ‘Angel’ Gabriel, that earned Everton the nickname ‘The Mersey Millionaires’, thanks to the inestimable John Moores. It’s difficult to fully convey the feelings of a lad in the Boys’ Pen as he and the other new Everton greats took us up the table after what seemed like an eternity in the wrong half.\n\nThe inside-left wasn’t a typical striker – to be honest he wasn’t a typical footballer – but he enjoyed five wonderful years at Goodison during which he scored in over 50 percent of the games he played. Can you imagine what would be his value, and in his wage packet, if he had a ratio like that these days? But maybe it wasn’t just the goals that made him a legend. He undoubtedly had a huge belief in his abilities – an arrogance, even. Along with his skills and his slight frame, there was toughness, a courage that made him stand out from the rest. I will never forget that little lift of the heel as he set off on one of his forays into the opponents’ defence – a run that was nearly always followed by a strike of the ball that few could equal.\n\nAnd I will always remember that moment when Alex ‘Chico’ Scott took a penalty in an FA Cup tie against Leeds, presumably because he had converted from the spot in the previous home game against Ipswich when Roy didn’t play. Scott’s spot kick was saved, but the referee blew for an infringement. All of us in the away end breathed a massive sigh of relief. There are few things worse than losing at Elland Road. As Alex picked up the ball to retake the penalty, Roy walked up to him and gently pushed him aside, as if to say: ‘I gave you one, but you’re not going to have another go’. He literally smashed the ball into the net to equalise and we won the replay at home, where he scored again. In that season, and indeed all the seasons that he wore the beautiful blue, he was a goalscoring machine. In each season that he made thirty appearances or more for the club – which happened on four occasions – he found the net over twenty times.\n\nAnd then there was Royston and Alex. What Evertonian wouldn’t think he’d died and gone to blue heaven when he watched those two? So different, yet so special. The Electric and the Magnifico. Memories that will live forever.\n\nRoy was Everton’s top scorer in each of his four full seasons at Goodison Park. He was one of the greatest footballers I’ve ever seen in an Everton shirt. Taffy was, and is, an Everton legend.\n\nThank you, Royston.\n\nBill Kenwright\n\nChairman\n\nEverton Football Club\n\nPrincipal References\n\nTHE MOST COMMONLY USED REFERENCE MATERIAL IS CREDITED IN superscript wherever possible.\n\n1.

Over several exercise books he documented the highs and lows of his spells playing for Blackburn Rovers, Everton, Stoke City and the Wales team. Honest and forthright, the memoir gave an insight into the man behind the sports headlines. As Roy’s wife Norma confessed, her husband was ‘an all or nothing personality’. Sadly, he abandoned interest in the project before it came to fruition and the notes lay unseen by all but his wife for nearly five decades. We are grateful to Norma for sharing them. There is no better starting place for this biography than the words of the great man himself.\n\nWell, here we are again: the start of another season. But this time I will be missing it. Missing that first day when suntanned, healthy-looking athletes report back to start yet another gruelling grind through, what will inevitably be, an even harder campaign – both mentally and physically – than the one that has just finished. For, make no mistake, football is getting brutal: not only on a Saturday – which is probably the only knowledge of the game that the average football supporter has – but also in its preparation and training. Quite soon these suntanned heroes will be reduced to vomiting exhaustion, their legs will turn to rubber, their hearts will be thumping, their lungs bursting. Without the physical condi tion that training gives them, they won’t be able to earn the salaries they receive.\n\nMr Average Fan would say: ‘I’d do it for their money, they like what they’re doing.’ Well, let’s be honest, I’d do it too, but Father Time has slowed me down. Last year I played in the Northern Premier League for my local club, Great Harwood. I vividly remember one remark made by a youngster as we left the pitch one afternoon. ‘You’re a has-been’ he said. ‘Yes son,’ I replied, ‘but it’s great to have been. I doubt whether you’ll ever go.’\n\nLooking back, I still think that I have been lucky to have enjoyed so many moments that make up so many memories for me. So, let’s start at the beginning ...\n\nRoy Vernon\n\n1972\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIT’S OCTOBER 1962 AND EVERTON FOOTBALL CLUB SITS PROUDLY atop the First Division. Inside a deserted Goodison Park, the club captain stands in his royal blue and white kit, shod in gleaming Puma football boots. With the famous Gwladys Street Stand as his backdrop, he repeatedly volleys the orange Slazenger Zig-Zag ball for the benefit of the photographer. When published on the cover of World Sports magazine, this iconic image captured the mercurial North Walian at the height of his powers. One of the most prolific forwards in the country at that time, he was not one for false modesty, demonstrated by a quote – perhaps allegorical – which has regularly been attributed to him over time. When asked about the best strikers in the land, Vernon’s response went: ‘There’s Jimmy Greaves, Denis Law … and then there’s me.’\n\nCome the final match of the 1962/63 league season, a campaign blighted by the harshest winter in living memory, Roy led out his teammates at a sun-bathed Goodison knowing that victory would clinch the title. The stage was set for ‘Taffy’ to give the most memorable display of his life. At the final whistle he was the hat-trick hero, Fulham had been swept away 4-1 and Everton’s first post-war crown had been secured. A lap of honour and a champagne toast from the directors’ box followed. This would be the zenith of the Flintshire-born inside-forward’s fifteen-year career with Blackburn Rovers, Everton, Stoke City and Wales.\n\nRoy was not your typical athlete; he was stick-thin in build – or as his Stoke City teammate Terry Conroy eloquently put it: ‘If he turned sideways you would mark him as absent.’ Yet his frame belied immense power and toughness which, when blended with his confidence – bordering on cockiness – and innate football intelligence, made him unstoppable on his day.\n\nAs a teenager, he had slipped through Everton’s grasp to blossom at Ewood Park under the tutelage of ex-Manchester United and Ireland star, Johnny Carey. On the international stage he helped Wales to reach the 1958 World Cup Finals, staged in Sweden. He had followed Carey to Merseyside in 1960 – one of the first big-money purchases made by the Toffees with the financial backing of John Moores, the Littlewoods magnate.\n\nLeaving Blackburn with something of a reputation as a loose cannon, Roy’s comment upon joining Everton was illustrative of his sardonic sense of humour: ‘I am greatly looking forward to playing in front of that wonderful crowd. Some folk say the Goodison crowd are bad lads. Some have said I’m a bad lad. We should get on well together.’\n\nWith a strike rate of better than a goal every other game, the sinewy number ten went on to become Everton’s leading scorer in each of his four full seasons there and remains one of only six men to have scored 100 or more league goals for the club. With devastating acceleration, balance, breathtaking body swerves, a keen sense of anticipation, rapier-like shooting and more than a bit of the devil, he dovetailed beautifully with the artisanal Alex Young. Those that saw them in action insist that they were the most intuitive striking partnership ever to have graced Goodison.\n\nA chain smoker, a night owl, a gambler, a joker and no respecter of authority, Roy would test the mettle of all his club managers. He felt closest to Carey, yet the uncompromising Harry Catterick was able to channel his energies positively, for a period at least. Awarded the club captaincy, his infectious personality and match-winning goals drove the team to glory. Yet within two years, he was out of form and favour, with manager Catterick less inclined to overlook the transgressions that he might have turned a blind eye to previously. A parting of the ways suited both parties, if not the Goodison faithful.\n\nAt Stoke City, Roy enjoyed a fresh lease of life, thriving in the laissez-fare atmosphere engendered by Tony Waddington. After this Indian summer, however, injury and disciplinary issues saw him become a peripheral figure and he left the Victoria Ground, almost unnoticed, upon expiry of his contract in 1970. After a dalliance with South African and non-league football, he walked away from football in 1972, never to return. His love for the game had dissipated as the maverick element was overtaken by regimentation and onerous tactics. Instead he helped in the family business back in his wife’s home town of Blackburn. A lifetime affiliation with Senior Service cigarettes took its toll and he succumbed to lung cancer in 1993, aged just 56.\n\nTo those that saw him in his pomp for clubs and country, Roy Vernon is one of the most exhilarating players they have had the pleasure to behold. However, at his three clubs he has, in retrospect, been somewhat overlooked. At Rovers he departed before he could be elevated to the status of Bryan Douglas and Ronnie Clayton. At Goodison, the sublimely skilled Young stole the limelight. Had he still been alive to be lauded at the famous Gwladys Street Hall of Fame dinners, maybe things would have been different. Stoke City fans rarely saw the best of the forward and had Gordon Banks, George Eastham and Jimmy Greenhoff to idolise. On the international front, it was his misfortune to be competing with the legendary Ivor Allchurch for the number ten shirt, hence his relatively meagre haul of 32 international caps.\n\nWhile neither of the authors interviewed the man from Ffynnongroyw, the older wordsmith attended the vast majority of the matches he played for Everton and did meet him fleetingly: ‘It was on the Wednesday afternoon before a game against Bolton in 1964 when a school pal and I travelled to Goodison early to collect our tickets for the European Cup game scheduled for the following week. With our Inter Milan tickets in hand, we were killing time waiting for the turnstiles to open when we spotted two stars leaving the massive wooden doors at the club’s reception. Roy Vernon was dressed immaculately in a grey Italian suit, whereas Sandy Brown resembled an underpaid school teacher.\n\n‘Instantly, I sprinted across the road into the path of a Hillman Imp. While the vehicle was undamaged, I was bloodied and flattened. Sandy ran to assist me, while Roy confronted the driver as if he had disallowed his goal against the Reds. The club captain – with fag dangling from his mouth – berated him and appeared to disagree with the consensus that it had been my fault. Sandy got me onto my feet and helped me into the club’s foyer where he watched a commissionaire in a military uniform clean me up and massage my ego. For his part, Roy reminded me of basic curb drill for pedestrians. Before going on their way, both stars put a smile on my face by autographing my ticket. Little did I realise that I would have to surrender it to attend the match against the champions of Italy. It was my only interaction with Roy. However, I was fortunate to befriend Sandy after his playing days were over and was delighted to reciprocate and help get him back onto his feet in his hour of need.’\n\nWe believe it is time to put right the omission of Roy Vernon from footballing folklore and bring his considerable achievements and colourful story to a wider audience. We have adopted a novel approach and drawn on first-hand recollections elicited from around 120 teammates and supporters, painstaking research of archive material and access to the Welshman’s own unpublished memoir notes to chronicle the life of a unique talent and a true football giant. We hope to do him justice.\n\nRob Sawyer and David France\n\nSeptember 2019\n\nAuthors’ Footnote:\n\nIt should be noted that the title of this book, Blue Dragon, has no connection with the popular purveyor of delicious fish and chips and mouthwatering Chinese takeaway meals, of the same name, located on Goodison Road.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nFfynnongroyw\n\nPOINT OF AYR, THE MOST NORTHERLY POINT OF MAINLAND WALES, was for many decades home to one of the largest and advanced collieries in the land. It drew workers from surrounding villages in this predominantly rural area of Flintshire. One such small settlement, Ffynnongroyw, was home to Thomas and Phyllis Vernon who resided in a two-up, two-down terrace house in the deceptively luxurious-sounding Williamson Square. Thomas, a quiet man who enjoyed visiting the bookmakers for a flutter every Saturday, was employed as the colliery pilot – helping coal boats to navigate the so-called ‘gutter’ from Liverpool Bay.\n\nThe couple had five children, four daughters – Vivienne, Sylvia, Ethel and Janet – and one son – Thomas Royston, who was born at home on 14 April 1937. He attended the village primary school along with his friend Ray Jones who was aware that, even at a tender age, his pal had a strong personality and sporting skill to compensate for a lack of inches: ‘I was ten months older and a school year ahead of him. We went to the village school down by the church. He was a real character and had he had an answer for everything. There was no football team in the village, so we played in the schoolyard with a little tennis ball. It became crowded once you had seven or eight-a-side but that’s when you knew Roy was gifted. He could dribble – you needed two players to tackle him. After we got a proper football, we played in a farmer’s field. If there was an odd number of us, the opposing team to Roy’s always claimed the extra player as he was so good. We used our coats for goalposts and the goalie at the end that Roy was attacking would narrow them a bit to handicap him. We mostly played football and a bit of cricket. He also liked a game of snooker in a local shop which had a table and table tennis at the church youth club. When a miners’ club opened in the village, we could get away with nipping in there in the afternoon.’\n\nMel Jones was another local boy impressed by his pal’s natural talent: ‘He could run, twist, turn and do everything – I think that you are born with that gift. Roy used to make a fool of us – he would start at one end of the pitch and dribble all the way to the other end and we would be trying to kick him. He just laughed at us. I always thought that he would have been a good politician as he was a ‘Cheeky Charlie’ – quick-witted and not afraid to talk to anybody.’\n\nHis sisters thought that their football-obsessed brother spent too much of his childhood kicking a ball outside – or inside the house if he was feeling lucky. ‘He was very good and easy-going as a brother, he was happy as long as he had a football,’ elder sibling Sylvia confirmed. ‘As a young teenager he had a part-time delivery job for a grocery store, but such was his passion for football that he paid another lad to do his round whilst he went off to play football.’\n\nRoy’s talents were not confined to sport – he was an intelligent and capable student and possessed a decent singing voice. Along with Ray Jones, he was co-opted into the All Saints parish choir: ‘We were in the church choir together – I think the vicar only put us in to make up the numbers. I couldn’t sing but Roy didn’t have a bad voice.’ His sister, Ethel, remembers that Roy, ever the deal-maker, was ‘bribed’ by the vicar to sing in return for the gift of a new football. The angelic voice would be compromised by the lifelong smoking habit for which he would become infamous. Ray Jones called to mind how it came about: ‘He was smoking when he was twelve or thirteen. You could buy packets containing five Woodbines and some shops would sell single cigarettes to the less affluent schoolboys.’ By adulthood Roy was a fully-paid up member of the chain smokers’ club.\n\nBeing the only boy in the family, Roy enjoyed his special status and was, according to his sisters, the apple of his mother’s eye. It helped that Phyllis, like her son, enjoyed football. Wherever his career took him she followed to watch, be it in Cardiff, East Lancashire, Merseyside or Staffordshire. With no major Football League team in the vicinity, the schoolboy – like many other young North Walians – had been seduced by the soccer giants of Lancashire. If he had any football allegiance it was to Everton Football Club although, in truth, he was far more interested in playing than following the fortunes of the Toffees.\n\nYoung Vernon was very capable academically when he put his mind to it. Having passed his Eleven-Plus examination, he attended Rhyl Grammar School, and he soon made his mark on the football pitch at outside-right. A fellow pupil in Rhyl, two academic years his senior, was Billy Russell, who would go on to combine teaching with a successful career at Sheffield United: ‘I was football-mad. At school there was a junior team plus a first team for the older boys. I was in the juniors when Roy arrived. He was a little shrimp, the tiniest lad you had ever seen. Seriously, you would never have pictured him as a football player, but he was brilliant right from the start. When you saw him I action, it was a case of Wow. Of course, he joined the junior team straight away. Obviously, he wasn’t slow but his skill factor – the control that he had over the ball at such an early age – was the important thing.’\n\nLoyalties to his school were tested when he enlisted with local team, Mostyn YMCA. After a year with its junior XI, he progressed to the senior side which competed against the likes of Denbigh YMCA and Rhyl YMCA in the Dyserth League. Roy represented the club for two seasons, generally at inside-right forward or on the wing. Others associated with the club included Elfed Ellis (the future FAW President) and the father of Mike England (the future Blackburn, Tottenham and Wales star). Russell outlined his schoolmate’s dilemma: ‘There was a bit of a conflict because our headmaster wanted him to play for the school team whilst he had established an association with Mostyn YMCA. I understood completely that he wanted to play for his local team. There were many occasions that he turned out for Mostyn rather than the school team, so he ran into a bit of trouble.’\n\nIndependent, spirited and distrustful of authority, Roy stuck to his guns and continued to represent Mostyn. He was rewarded with selection for a representative Welsh YMCA team, and in a game against Irish YMCA opponents he netted twice, with Ray Jones also on the scoresheet in a 4-4 draw. Soon Roy was picked to play for"
