        "text": "Follow Tony on Twitter\n\nFollow Liverpool Pals on Twitter\n\nTony Wainwright\n\nIn November 2018, the Remembrance article for the Everton v Brighton matchday programme was written by EFC Heritage Society member Tony Wainwright. He reflected on the lives of over 13,000 men from the city of Liverpool and hinterland who gave their lives for their country. Tony knows this history more than most, as his work and dedication came to fruition on 31 August 2014, when the memorial to the Liverpool Pals was unveiled by the Earl of Wessex in Lime Street station.\n\nJust a few weeks after the Brighton fixture, it was formally announced in the London Gazette that Anthony Wainwright had been awarded the British Empire Medal in the New Years Honours List of 2019, for ‘his services to the Liverpool Pals Memorial Fund’. Yet Tony’s work was still not finished, and in September 2019 a website dedicated to the memory of the Liverpool Pals went live. This has been an immense undertaking by this life-long Blue, who, with his team of researchers, have made the records of the Pals available to the public.\n\nThe Liverpool Pals website Tony also made a valuable contribution to the Remembrance booklet produced by the EFC Heritage Society – ‘The Fallen of Everton Football Club’, which is available as a free download below.\n\nAn interview with Tony:\n\nHow long have you supported Everton?\n\nAll of my life.\n\nWho or what was responsible for being an Evertonian – or were you ‘chosen’?\n\nMy family are all massive Evertonians so there was only ever one choice!\n\nFirst Everton game attended:\n\nStoke City at Goodison in 1971. I had watched the World Cup in Mexico and was obsessed with the Gordon Banks save from Pele. When my Dad showed me the fixture list for 1970-71 season, I picked the Stoke game to see my new hero. Everton won 2-0 and were reigning Champions. If we could score twice past Gordon Banks when Pele couldn’t, well what could go wrong!!! I had to wait until 1984 to see us lift silverware.\n\nMost memorable match attended:\n\nBayern Munich without any doubt.\n\nWhere do you generally sit at Goodison?\n\nGwladys Street.\n\nWhat aspect of being an Evertonian do you like most?\n\nI treasure the camaraderie of fellow Blues and the shared experience of our ups and downs.\n\nIn what year did you join EFCHS?\n\n2016.\n\nWhat is your particular area of interest or expertise in Everton’s history/heritage?\n\nGiven my background in First World War research I am able to assist particularly, but not exclusively, with the Remembrance aspect of the Society.\n\nWhat is your main activity/involvement with the Society?\n\nSee above.\n\nIn your opinion, what is the best thing about the Society?\n\nThe collective knowledge of the membership is probably second to none and the inherent will of helping to spread the heritage of our great Club.\n\nYour favourite Everton-related book?\n\nJames Corbett: Everton The School of Science. A wonderful eulogy of the Club and all it stands for.\n\nIf you could travel in time, what match, before your lifetime of attending matches, would you choose to attend?\n\nArsenal at Goodison May 1928. To be there to see Everton as Champions and witness Dixie’s hat trick which led to his record breaking 60th goal would be incredible.\n\nThe best player you have seen in Everton’s colours?\n\nNeville Southall\n\nThe player you wish that you could have seen, from the past?\n\nAlex Young. My dad’s favourite and I was brought up on tales of the Golden Vision.\n\nAnything else to add?\n\nI hope to see the Heritage Society continue to flourish and in particular to be able to assist Everton Football Club during the transition in moving from Goodison Park to our new home at Bramley Moore."
