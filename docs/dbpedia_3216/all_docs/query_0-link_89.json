That can’t be true, can it?​\n\nDavid Potter24 April, 2021\n\nLast night we had the Scottish Cup Final of 2015 on BBC Scotland’s Scottish Cup Final Classic. It featured Falkirk and Inverness, and was won 2-1 by Inverness after a dreadful goalkeeping error when Falkirk were becoming the better side and had a man advantage.\n\nTo be fair, it wasn’t a bad game, and it was well enough presented. Those of us who admire Michael Stewart as a pundit saw him at his best with his incisive comments and pithy remarks, (Michael had been the commentator in 2015) and Chris Iwelumo is also beginning to make an impact as a regular, sensible kind of a chap. As I predicted, Celtic were mentioned as having been defeated by Inverness in the semi-final with a certain amount of pretending to forget the controversial nature of that defeat until Michael Stewart reminded everyone of the hand ball.\n\n19.04.2015. Scottish Cup. Semi Final. Inverness Caledonian Thistle versus Celtic. Josh Meekings blocks Leigh Griffiths header on the line with his hand\n\nThe cause of women was hardly helped however by the two ladies. One of them seemed to support whichever team scored, the other had, presumably, been told that she was funny by someone with the best of intentions, while the guy sitting in the middle, who seemed to be wearing one of those old-fashioned Celtic scarves of the 1960s, thought that the highlight of the night was telling everyone that he had been to school with Willie Collum, who had from an early stage, apparently, wanted to be a referee.\n\nOn the field, one’s sympathies were with Falkirk for whom Peter Grant junior, (as Peter Grant senior had been) was a whole-hearted trier, and one had to feel sorry for their goalkeeper at the end. John Hughes (Yogi Bear II who played for Celtic in the 1990s) was the Manager of Inverness and was seen at the start chewing gum in a relentless, ferocious, threatening sort of way that made the ladies uncomfortable. One had to be a little happy, however, for the Inverness supporters, who like that of Ross County, are decent, civilised and, contrary to some people’s perceptions, very welcoming and friendly.\n\n30.05.2015. Scottish Cup Final. Falkirk versus Inverness CT – Ryan Christie celebrates with his former ICT teammates…\n\nHowever, there have now been three Scottish Cup Final Classics on BBC Scotland – Rangers v Aberdeen, Rangers v Queen of the South and Inverness v Falkirk. Is it just me, or has anyone else noticed a significant omission here?\n\nIs there not one team which deserves at least a mention some week? Especially when there are 40 Scottish Cup wins to choose from! We await next week’s choice with some interest. I would hate to think that BBC Scotland have a bias against a certain team. That can’t be true, can it? Good heavens, no! No, I am not believing that!\n\nDavid Potter\n\nPotter is the fud who wrote a bio on Scottish winger, Alex Troup. One of Scotland's great left wingers apparently.\n\n'Troupie' played for Dundee and then Everton.\n\nTo put Troup's skills into persepective against Alan Morton for instance vying for that left wing berth.\n\nIn 1919, Scotland played two 'Victory' internationals against England. Alan Morton, then of Queens Park, played in both.\n\nIn 1920, Alex Troup played against England at Sheffield.\n\nIn the years 1921, 22, 23, 24 and 25, Alan Morton was on the left wing.\n\nIn 1926, Alan Morton was injured and was ruled out of the England fixture. In fact 1926 became known as; 'the year Morton did not play'.\n\nAlex Troup, then of Everton took his place.\n\nNormal service was then resumed.\n\nIn the years 1927, 1928 (The WWs), 1929, 1930, 1931 and 1932 Alan Morton was on the left wing.\n\nI've often wondered why Potter singled out Alex Troup, so far out of the Scottish left wing loop, he'd have needed a hit taken out on Morton to get in the team, for a bio?\n\nPerish the thought it was an attempt by an utter moron to try and take the shine and lustre off the legend that was Alan Lauder Morton?\n\nThey are now genuinely deranged. Several year of ‘success’, followed by one bad year, and they have completely lost any sliver of reason and logic they ever had. It is like a petulant angry spoiled child multiplied by 100. Our fans like a moan like most fans, and we are not slow to be petty or paranoid on occasion, but they are on a different level to any group of people in the world, sporting or otherwise.\n\nThere were a few of them the other day complaining that one newspaper had a headline with the words Rangers & Celtic as opposed to Celtic & Rangers. Apparently it should be the latter as it is 1) is in alphabetical order, and 2) it rolls off the tongue better.\n\nOn one hand it is amusing to watch, but also quite worrying in seeing the extreme frailties of the human condition."
