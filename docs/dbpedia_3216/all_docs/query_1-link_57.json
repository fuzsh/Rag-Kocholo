To avoid confusion \"IRELAND (IFA)\" is used in the matches from 4th March 1922 to 3rd October 1953 inclusive. \"(Ireland - IFA)\" is added after the names of IFA referees who officiated at matches from 26th October 1929 to 4th November 1953 inclusive. A more detailed explanation is included at point 1 in the notes on the overview page of \"Scotland - International Results\".

Despite exhaustive research it has proven impossible to say which is correct. The sixth Scotland goal is credited here to Alexander James but the Scottish Football Museum gives it to Hugh Gallacher (his fifth goal in the match). This is supported by some accounts including Gallacher's own. It is not clear whether the Scottish FA officially agrees with this.
