We once again made the playoffs in 2023 and are poised to be a Top 5 team in 4-AAAA this coming year. Our goal is to have BT Football at that level of excellence on a consistent basis, but more importantly our goal is to produce first class young men. Come be part of the Titan tradition! - Coach Dudley\n\nGAMES BEGIN AUGUST 24, 2024\n\nNo player may participate in any activity until all paperwork is complete."
