        "text": "About the Hall of Fame\n\nGwladys Streetâs Hall of Fame means different things to different people. Some Evertonians associate the name with Peter Kingâs grotesque caricatures; others associate it with intoxicating celebrations when Hall of Fame dinners were the greatest night in the Everton calendar that paid tribute to the clubâs golden history and the men who made it.\n\nMore than anything, all Evertonians should associate Gwladys Streetâs Hall of Fame with the names of its members with dating back to the days St Domingo and their contributions to the welfare of Merseysideâs first club.\n\nThe Hall of Fame started as a modest concept. As way of background for younger Blues, the initial inductees were elected by a panel of former-players, journalists, shareholders and season-ticket holders who assessed the accomplishments of the candidates during their careers at Everton. Since then, Hall of Fame inductees have been elected by supporters via postal ballots and internet polls.\n\nIn 2009, David France elected to bring down the curtain on these legendary evenings of celebration that had created so many misty-eyed memories but now, seven years on, âDr Evertonâ is reviving the Hall of Fame and welcoming input from supporters in selecting four new inductees into the celebrated group of club legends."
