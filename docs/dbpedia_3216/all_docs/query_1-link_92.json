        "text": "[1] The bodies of Lieutenant K.A. Stewart and about ten men of the platoon he had so gallantly led were not recovered on the night of the battle, and for months it was uncertain where they had fallen. But in July, when the grass had grown two or three feet long, Major Wauchope and Sergeant MacDonald proceeded on a search of No Man’s Land, choosing the hour of 2 p.m. when German sentries were least watchful. Under the cover of the grass it was possible to go over the ground which the attacking troops had covered on the 9th May. There were a few bridges over the stream, and many bodies lay in its channel, about six feet deep, but at this time with little water in it. Lieutenant Stewart’s body was found not far from the German trenches, with eight of his platoon beside him. A few articles were taken from the bodies for the relatives of the fallen men, and the patrol returned safely.\n\nAdrian Bristow (A Serious Disappointment) also says something about this (in chapter 13):\n\n\"Owen Buckmaster was a company commander in the 7th Battalion of the [DCLI]. In August 1915, he found himself in the line in front of Rue du Bois... he wrote:\n\n'Outside the trenches was another story. Just over the parapet were the bodies of many of the 2nd Battalion of the Sussex Regiment, killed in the attack on Aubers Ridge on the 9th May, 1915. There they lay, facing the enemy, mummified, packs squared, bayonets fixed as if on parade, shot down and wiped out before they had hardly been able to get through our own wire; their lives squandered by the folly and incompetence of the staff. Anyone with any commonsense could have seen that no man could have done what they were asked to do. In front of the trenches the terrain was flat, without a particle of cover. In the spring only the blades of young corn would have been growing on it. To reach the German lines they would have had to cross several hundred yards of this ground in the face of withering fire from machine guns concealed in deep emplacements, and skillfully sited so as to support each other and rake every yard of ground with fire.'\"\n\nThe fact that the sector remained relatively static (but not peaceful) for most of the war meant there was little opportunity to do anything about the remains lying out.\n\nAnother possiblity for the lack of burials is that some men were buried but subsequent shell fire destroyed the graves.\n\nWauchope’s history of the Black Watch, page 7, recounts the tale of the first fatal casualty sustained by the 4th Battalion. Corporal Ralph Dick was shot while at an advanced post in no man’s land at 2 o’clock in the afternoon of 5 March 1915. Wauchope recalls that “Near the entrance to the Crescent and Port Arthur trenches, Corporal Dick was laid to rest, and a wooden cross was raised above his grave.”\n\nYet Corporal Dick’s grave is lost. He is instead commemorated on the Le Touret Memorial.\n\nAnother man mentioned by Wauchope - Corporal Archie Troup, 4th battalion (mentioned at page 13) – was also buried but his grave appears to have been lost or destroyed, as he is again listed among the missing on the Le Touret Memorial. Wauchope recounts:\n\n“Shortly after the action of May 9th a pathetic ceremony took place. This was the erection of memorial crosses for some of the fallen. The fact that Sergeant-Major Pyott, who lost his son in the action, and Private John Troup, whose father was also amongst the fallen, took part in the ceremony renders it almost unique in the annals of the Regiment. ... Sergeant-Major Pyott put up a white cross for his boy, and Private John Troup erected a cross on his father’s grave. It bore the simple inscriptions:\n\n'456 Sergeant, H. Coy., 4th Black Watch, killed in action 9th May, 1915.'\n\nOn the stand of the cross was the one word 'Archie,' by which name Sergeant Troup was known to all.”\n\nSo, even where men were buried, 3 years of shelling will have taken its toll. I doubt that was a feature unique to this battlefield, however.\n\nCheers, Ian\n\nRembering my great-grandfather, Private Charles Carmichael, S6070, 1st Battalion, Black Watch, killed in action, 9 May 1915, near Rue du Bois"
