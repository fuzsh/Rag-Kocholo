They are currently members of the East Division of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the National Football League (NFL). They play their home games in the suburb of Orchard Park, and since 2008 have played one home game per season in Toronto. The Bills began competitive play in 1960 as a charter member of the American Football League and joined the NFL as part of the AFL-NFL merger in 1970.\n\nPLAYERS COACHES SCORES IMAGES SEASONS\n\nThe Bills won two consecutive American Football League titles in 1964 and 1965, but the club has not won a league championship since the merger. Buffalo is also the only team to win four consecutive American Football Conference Championships, and the only team in either conference to play in (and lose) four consecutive Super Bowl games.\n\nThe Bills were named as the result of the winning entry in a local contest, which named the team after the AAFC Buffalo Bills, a previous football franchise from the All-America Football Conference that merged with the Cleveland Browns in 1950. That team, in turn, was named after William Frederick \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody. The Bills' cheerleaders are known as the Buffalo Jills. The official mascot is Billy Buffalo; Cody is not used in the team's iconography at all.\n\nThe Bills conduct summer training camp at St. John Fisher College in Pittsford, New York, a suburb of Rochester.\n\nThey are the only NFL team to play their home games within New York state. Both the New York Jets and the New York Giants play in East Rutherford, New Jersey, nine miles outside of their headquarters in New York City. The Bills actually play their home games further away (11 miles) from their headquarters in the city of Buffalo. On October 2, 2005, the Bills played the New Orleans Saints in the first NFL regular-season game held in San Antonio, Texas. With the inception of the 5-year Bills Toronto Series deal in 2008 that is good through 2012, they are also the only team to play a home game in Canada.\n\nHistory[]\n\nLogos and uniforms[]\n\nIn 1962, the standing red bison was designated as the logo and took its place on a white helmet.[1] In 1962, the team's colors also changed to red, white, and blue. The team switched to blue jerseys with red and white stripes on the shoulders. the helmets were white with a red center stripe.[2] By 1965, red and blue center stripes were put on the helmets.[3]\n\nThe Bills introduced blue pants worn with the white jerseys in 1973, the last year of the standing buffalo helmet. The blue pants remained through 1985. The face mask on the helmet was blue from 1974 through 1986 before changing to white. Buffalo sporadically wore white at home in the 1980s, but has not since 1986.\n\nIn 1974, the standing bison logo was replaced by a blue charging one with a red slanting stripe streaming from its horn. In 1984, the helmet's background color was changed from white to red, reportedly in part to distinguish them more readily from three of their division rivals at that time, the Indianapolis Colts, the Miami Dolphins, and the New England Patriots, who all also wore white helmets at that point. (The Patriots now use a silver helmet, the Colts have since been realigned to the AFC South, and the New York Jets, who wore white helmets until 1978, have since switched back to white helmets.)\n\nIn 2002, under the direction of general manager Tom Donahoe, the Bills' uniforms went through radical changes. A darker shade of blue was introduced as the main jersey color, and nickel gray was introduced as an accent color. Both the blue and white jerseys feature red side panels. The white jerseys include a dark blue shoulder yoke and royal blue numbers. The current helmet is red with one navy blue, two nickel, two royal blue, two white stripes, and white face mask. A new logo, a stylized B consisting of two bullets and a more detailed buffalo head on top, was proposed and had been released (it can be seen on a few baseball caps that were released for sale), but fan backlash led to the team retaining the running bison logo. The current helmet logo adopted in 1974- a charging royal blue bison, with a red streak, white horn and eyeball- remains unchanged.\n\nIn 2005, the Bills revived the standing bison helmet and uniform of the mid-1960s as a throwback uniform.\n\nThe Bills usually wear the all-blue combination at home and the all-white combination on the road when not wearing the throwback uniforms. They have not worn blue on white since 2006, while the white on blue has not been worn since 2007.\n\nPlayers of note[]\n\nCurrent players[]\n\nBuffalo Bills current roster\n\nQuarterbacks\n\n10 Levi Brown\n\n14 Ryan Fitzpatrick\n\nRunning backs\n\n30 Jehuu Caulcrick FB\n\n22 Fred Jackson\n\n38 Corey McIntyre FB\n\n21 C.

The Bills had stationery and various other team merchandise showing a running player wearing that number, and it was not supposed to represent any specific person, but the 'spirit of the team.' The tradition was broken in 1969 when reserve running back Preston Ridlehuber was issued number 31 for one game while his normal number 36 jersey was repaired by equipment manager Tony Marchitte. The number 31 was not issued again until 1990 when first round draft choice James (J.D.) Williams wore it for his first two seasons. The number has since been released for use by any player and is currently being worn by starting free safety Jairus Byrd.\n\nAll-time first round draft picks[]\n\n1960s[7]\n\nYear Player College Position 1960 Richie Lucas Penn State Quarterback 1961 Ken Rice, 1st Overall Auburn Tackle 1963 Dave Behrman Michigan State Center 1964 Carl Eller Minnesota Defensive End 1965 Jim Davidson Ohio State Tackle 1966 Mike Dennis Mississippi Running Back 1967 John Pitts Arizona State Safety 1968 Haven Moses San Diego State Wide Receiver 1969 O.J.

John Murphy is the team's current play-by-play announcer; he was a color commentator alongside and eventually succeeded longtime voice Van Miller after Miller's retirement at the end of the 2003 NFL season. Mark Kelso serves as the color analyst. The Bills radio network has over twenty affiliates in upstate New York and one affiliate, CJCL 590AM (The Fan) in Toronto.\n\nBuffalo is also one of eight teams that is contracted with Compass Media Networks to syndicate selected games nationwide.\n\nDuring preseason, most games are televised on Buffalo's ABC affiliate, WKBW-TV channel 7, with several other affiliates in western New York. These games are simulcast on sister stations WTVH in Syracuse, WICU in Erie, WHAM-TV in Rochester, and beginning in 2008, CITY-TV in Toronto. Ray Bentley, a former Bills linebacker and current AFL on ESPN analyst, does play by play, while CBS analyst and former Bills special teams player Steve Tasker does color commentary on these games. WHAM-TV sports anchor Mike Catalana is the sideline reporter. Since 2008, preseason games have been broadcast in high definition.\n\nIn the event that regular season (or preseason) games are broadcast by a cable outlet (ESPN or NFL Network), WKBW-TV carries the ESPN or NFL Network feed.\n\nTraining camp sites[]\n\n1960-1962 Roycroft Inn, East Aurora, New York\n\n1963-1967 Camelot Hotel, Blasdell, New York\n\n1968-1980 Niagara University, Niagara Falls, New York\n\n1981-1999 State University at Fredonia, Fredonia, New York\n\n2000–present St. John Fisher College, Pittsford, New York[15]\n\nMascots, cheerleaders and marching band[]\n\nThe Bills' official mascot is Billy Buffalo, an eight-foot tall, anthropomorphic blue American bison who wears the jersey number BB.\n\nThe Bills' cheerleaders are the Buffalo Jills. The Jills are not owned by the Bills, but instead are a separate organization funded primarily by the Buffalo Bills Radio Network, a subsidiary of Citadel Broadcasting.\n\nThe Attica High School Marching Band is the official marching band of the Buffalo Bills. Along with the Baltimore Ravens and the Washington Redskins, the Bills are one of only three teams in the NFL to designate an official marching band.\n\nIn popular culture[]\n\nIn the X-Files episode \"Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man\", the titular character, a member of a shadowy government cabal, states that the Buffalo Bills will not win a Super Bowl while he lives.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills were featured on the direct-to-TV movie, Second String and in the Vincent Gallo drama Buffalo 66.\n\nGallery[]\n\nNotes and references[]\n\nSee also[]\n\nList of American Football League players\n\nList of Buffalo Bills seasons\n\nMajor North American professional sports teams\n\n[]"
