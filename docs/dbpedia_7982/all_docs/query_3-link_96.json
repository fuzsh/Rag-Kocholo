The Latin West succumbed, he contended, to the spread from within of an increasingly intolerant monotheism, namely Christianity, and it failed, in the end, to repulse the barbarian invasions of the Goths, Vandals, and Huns. The Greco East, on the other hand, was assailed from without by barbarian Arabs and later, from without by the barbarian Turks who had converted to another monotheism, Islam. Thus, both halves of the Roman Empire were destroyed by barbarism and monotheism.\"\n\nIvan Illich\n\nIntro: Ivan Illich on the Transition Towards an Age of Systems\n\nBio: David Cayley: 'Ivan Illich: An Intellectual Journey': a magisterial synthesis and interpretation of his late friend and colleague\n\nPodcast: David Cayley on Why Ivan Illich Still Matters\n\nKarl Jaspers:\n\nJohn David Ebert on Karl Jaspers's The Origin and Goal of History\n\nBook: The Origins and Goal of History\n\nUpdate: From the Axial Age to the Moral Revolution: John Stuart-Glennie, Karl Jaspers, and a New Understanding of the Idea by Eugene Halton (2014)\n\nCarl Jung\n\nJohn David Ebert on Carl Jung\n\nMarshall McLuhan\n\nVideos: John David Ebert on Marshall McLuhan ; John David Ebert on Marshall McLuhan's Culture Without Literacy\n\nBooks:\n\nUnderstanding Media: The Extensions of Man\n\nThe Gutenberg Galaxy: understanding the revolution of the printing press\n\nCo-Authored Books:\n\nMarshall and Eric McLuhan.

The Green History of Religion.\n\n\"\"Our findings showed that from about 12,000 BCE, the planet went through a warming trend causing extreme climate changes all across the globe. It disrupted primal societies and their ways of life and successively displaced ancient pastoral and agrarian communities. The warming trend intensified rapidly quickening the rise and fall of ancient civilizations at the core centers. The tumultuous social and ecological ethos of the pre-axial times became conducive for the formation of world-denying motifs that became the bedrock of all post-axial religions and philosophies. This, in a nutshell, is the thesis of Green History of Religion.\"\n\nBook: Ecological Revolution: The Political Origins of Environmental Degradation and the Environmental Origins of Axial Religions; China, Japan, Europe. by Mark D.

By Ian Morris. Princeton University Press, 2013. [10]\n\n\"Morris’s index breaks social development into four traits—energy capture per capita, organization, information technology, and war-making capacity—and he uses archaeological, historical, and current government data to quantify patterns. Morris reveals that for 90 percent of the time since the last ice age, the world’s most advanced region has been at the western end of Eurasia, but contrary to what many historians once believed, there were roughly 1,200 years—from about 550 to 1750 CE—when an East Asian region was more advanced. Only in the late eighteenth century CE, when northwest Europeans tapped into the energy trapped in fossil fuels, did the West leap ahead.\"\n\nBook: Foragers, Farmers and Fossil Fuels: How Human Values Evolve. By Ian Morris. Princeton University Press, 2015\n\n[11]\n\n\"Presents a provocative alternative: human culture gradually evolves towards whatever system of organisation allows a society to harvest the most energy, and we then conclude that system is the most virtuous one. Egalitarian values helped hunter-gatherers hunt and gather effectively. Once farming was developed, hierarchy proved to be the social structure that produced the most grain (and best repelled nomadic raiders). And in the modern era, democracy and individuality have proven to be more productive ways to collect and exploit fossil fuels. On this theory, it’s technology that drives moral values much more than moral philosophy.\" [12]\n\nEconomic World History\n\nBook: World Civilizations and Economic Cycles. Mamikon Airapetian.\n\nBook: The Destiny of Civilization. Michael Hudson. [13]: “There are essentially two types of society: mixed economies with public checks and balances, and oligarchies that dismantle and privatize the state, taking over its monetary and credit system, the land and basic infrastructure to enrich themselves but choking the economy, not helping it grow.”\n\nBook: The Measure of Civilization: How Social Development Decides the Fate of Nations. By Ian Morris. Princeton University Press, 2013. [14] : \" Morris’s index breaks social development into four traits—energy capture per capita, organization, information technology, and war-making capacity — and he uses archaeological, historical, and current government data to quantify patterns.\"\n\nBook: Long Cycles: Prosperity and War in the Modern Age. By Joshua S Goldstein.\n\nHistory of the Commons\n\nCommons, Markets and Associations in the European Middle Ages. JEAN-FRANÇOIS DRAPERI. Associations in the Medieval West. From the emergence of the commons to the supremacy of markets. Le fait associatif dans l’Occident médiéval. De l’émergence des communs à la suprématie des marchés. Le Bord de l'Eau, [15]: \"Associations dominate the economy of the central Middle Ages: monasteries, parishes, guilds, brotherhoods, communes, found the renaissance of the 12th century. Acting on the medieval associative fact invites us to pose the hypothesis that associations and the social economy are not an invention of contemporary society, but rather a discovery. The social economy was not born in reaction to capitalism, but the capitalist economy was born from the transformation of trade associations and the seizure of power by merchants and bankers over the commons and communes in the 13th and 14th centuries.\"\n\nHistory of Gender and Power\n\nSex and Power in History: How the Difference Between the Sexes Has Shaped Our Destinies. Amaury de Riencourt; traces the changing historic roles of women, especially Western women. He reaches back to remote sources to explain—and suggest solutions to—the current predicament of the sexes. When some three of four thousand years ago men revolted against the myth of the Great Earth Goddess and set up dominant male gods, it was a psychological event of the first magnitude. This shift to the masculine principle, claims de Riencourt, marked the beginning of history proper and led to the male-oriented societies of Greece and Rome.\"\n\nHistory of Media and Interconnective Webs\n\nArticles\n\nThree Stages in the Evolution of Culture and Cognition: from mimetic, to mythic, to theoretic cognitive transmission between humans. See the book: Origins of the Modern Mind. By Merlin Donald. 1991\n\nBooks\n\nEmpire and Communications. By Harold Innis. Dundun, 2007 (1950).

[17]: see: World History of the Webs of Humankind\n\n\"A cohesive, single-author world history built around the webs of interaction that stitched together regions and over time, the globe. .. McNeill uses connective webs—along which trade, religious beliefs, technologies, pathogens, and much else traveled—to organize details and keep the big picture in view.\"\n\nThe Alphabet vs. the Goddess: The Conflict Between Word and Image. by Leonard Shlain: \"when a critical mass of people within a society acquire literacy, especially alphabet literacy, left hemispheric modes of thought are reinforced at the expense of right hemispheric ones, which manifests as a decline in the status of images, women's rights, and goddess worship...\"\n\nEisenstein, Elizabeth L.

Routledge, 1982.\n\nReligious History\n\nCosmos, Chaos, and the World to Come. By Professor Norman Cohn. Yale University Press, 2001\n\n\"Until around 1500 B.C., it was generally believed that once the world had been set in order by the gods, it was in essence immutable. However, it was always a troubled world. By means of flood and drought, famine and plague, defeat in war, and death itself, demonic forces threatened and impaired it. Various combat myths told how a divine warrior kept the forces of chaos at bay and enabled the world to survive. Sometime between 1500 and 1200 B.C., the Iranian prophet Zoroaster broke from that static yet anxious world-view.\"\n\nThe Pursuit of the Millennium: Revolutionary Millenarians and Mystical Anarchists of the Middle Ages. by Norman Cohn. Oxford University Press, 1970.\n\n\"This fascinating book explores the millenarianism that flourished in western Europe between the eleventh and sixteenth centuries. Covering the full range of revolutionary and anarchic sects and movements in medieval Europe, Cohn demonstrates how prophecies of a final struggle between the hosts of Christ and Antichrist melded with the rootless poor's desire to improve their own material conditions, resulting in a flourishing of millenarian fantasies. The only overall study of medieval millenarian movements, The Pursuit of the Millennium offers an excellent interpretation of how, again and again, in situations of anxiety and unrest, traditional beliefs come to serve as vehicles for social aspirations and animosities.\"\n\nWar\n\nWar in Human Civilization.
