        "text": "I’ve been struggling with how to fit Jimena Canales’ Bedeviled: A Shadow History of Demons in Science into the themes of this blog. It’s an intriguing but strangely elusive book, at least for me. I came across it at the same small shop where I’d purchased Tim Parks’ Out of My Head, the one about Riccardo Manzotti’s ideas.\n\nThe other day I went back to Friction Books for something else to read, and there to my surprise was a selection of works by Owen Barfield, whose name keeps cropping up (notably at Perilous Resonance). Hoping for advice about which title to take home, I struck up a conversation with the fellow behind the counter. He introduced me to the shop’s owner and curator, Joel Plaskett, whom you may know as a recording musician.\n\nAs we stood talking beside the shelves, Plaskett’s enthusiasm for Barfield brimmed over. He kept pulling out other volumes with related themes, drawing the connections between them. In the end, for my explorations, I chose Barfield’s Saving the Appearances and Gary Lachman’s Lost Knowledge of the Imagination. I haven’t started either of them yet, because I have a fascinating library book to read first: What We See When We Read: A Phenomenology, by Peter Mendelsund.\n\nBut this is not about my reading list. What struck me about Plaskett’s recommendations was the way he characterized them as “mystical,” rather than “philosophical” in the sense we mean when we think of Wittgenstein or Whitehead or Nietzsche (whose names, I must admit, I brought up). An admirer of Iain McGilchrist, Plaskett is among the many critics of modernity who hope and expect that there is more to the cosmos than is offered by the usual materialist story. His emphasis on the mystical has given me a foothold on Canales’ Bedeviled.\n\nI’m not completely innocent of the mystical. Back in the day, I owned and occasionally used Tarot decks (Waite’s and Crowley’s), poked into Mme. Blavatsky’s Theosophy (inherited from a brother-in-law), expressed mild curiosity about Teilhard de Chardin, read Linda Goodman’s Sun Signs, explored the stranger corners of Carl Jung’s thought. Jung’s ideas seemed at least partly reasonable; he straddled a line between a rational, reflective approach and the wide-eyed excitement of true believers. But I was never “all in” (even though I did have some disturbing experiences at the edge of the occult). For me, the mystical movement was not quite respectable. It had about it something of the charlatan, some infusion from what I took to be the nonsense of seances, auras, crystals, vortexes, and at the worst, spoon-bending. It was, in a word, the arena of the supernatural. However peculiar Whitehead might seem, however gripped by religion Kierkegaard, however cryptically visionary Wittgenstein, by and large they stuck to a world free of ghosts and spirits and spooky invisible forces; they did not dabble in the outlandish.\n\nI realize not everyone would agree with this assessment. Some would lump God and panpsychism, and even the limits of discourse, with astrology and phrenology and the reading of tea leaves, and never look back. Nevertheless, in the Western tradition, it’s one thing to reflect in an open-minded way on the metaphysics of the cosmos, and another to enthuse reflexively over the healing powers of ley lines. Perhaps that’s simply where the rubber meets the road, but wherever this cultural difference lies exactly, it’s where I tend to draw the line.\n\nIt was this division, I suspect, that hampered my assimilation of Jimena Canales’ Bedeviled. Canales is not by any means a mystic or supernaturalist. She is a careful, thorough historian of science, albeit one who brings fresh and remarkable perspectives to the discipline. In Bedeviled, she explores the link between demons as frequent imaginary aids to scientific thought (consider Maxwell’s, or Laplace’s, or Descartes’, or Searle’s, to name a few) and demons in their traditional role as supernatural beings. It’s a connection we barely notice, but as Canales explores its nuances, something unexpected emerges. She traces a continuity of science and the imagination, as the one shades vaguely into the other. In the last chapter, “Philosophical Considerations,” she explores the ontology of the nonexistent (a concept playfully deconstructed in the novel Dr. No by Percival Everett, which I also happen to have read recently). Her claim is that the nonexistent, the imaginary, drives science much more powerfully than the plodding Popperian hypothesis-experiment model. According to her, even Popper amended his older views. “Science needs these pictures,” she quotes him as saying in his later work Metaphysical Epilogue. “A new picture, a new way of looking at things, a new interpretation may change the situation in science completely.” That sounds similar to Kuhn’s “paradigm shift,” of which this blog makes much.\n\nDemons and the supernatural are, on the face of it, nonsense. Yet when our understanding falters, philosophers and scientists often posit a demon to personify the unfathomable. It might be Laplace’s demon, able to foresee every cause and effect in the universe; Maxwell’s demon, able to undo entropy; Descartes’ demon, able to deceive our understanding; Searle’s demon, able to substitute mechanism for meaning. In personifying the unknown as a demon, we personify a threat to our current reality. Demons are the mysterious. They lie just beyond our comprehension, both for what they do, and for what their activity implies. When we invoke demons, even in the soundest methods of our science, we gaze into the mystic.\n\nIn this way, we further our understanding. Perhaps, when we reach the edge of our reality, this is just what we need.\n\nRelated Topics"
