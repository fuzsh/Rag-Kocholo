        "text": "In his 1957 Saving the Appearances, Owen Barfield writes:\n\nThe extremity of idolatry towards which we are moving renders the attainment of this dual relation to nature a necessity for both art and science. (p. 171)\n\nThere’s a lot to unpack here, but what stands out for me is the suggestion that we need two modes of relating to the world. That’s a major theme of this blog. How does Barfield’s thought fit in?\n\nOn page 37, drawing a parallel with Francis Bacon’s “four idols of the mind,” Barfield suggests that our modern conception of prehistory is tainted by “idols of the study.” It’s an odd juxtaposition, since Bacon’s observations are considered foundational for the very way of thinking Barfield intends to critique. Be that as it may, on page 61 he begins expanding his idea of idolatry: the substitution, in our experience, of objects for the far more complex phenomena from which we distill them. These phenomena involve the engagement of the human subject in creating reality. Barfield makes occasional gestures toward contemporary physics in this connection, but he is more concerned with the idea of “figuration,” or experience as a construct involving a holistic world (although he doesn’t use the word “construct”); and with “representation,” or the rich relation of what is constructed to an equally rich “unrepresented,” corresponding roughly to Kantian noumena, but with a more spiritual or cosmic aspect. Idolatry, in Barfield’s sense, is the modern failure to appreciate figuration and representation, and to think of the world in terms of simple, isolated objects with which we have no “participation.”\n\nIn a wider frame of reference than that hitherto adopted, idolatry may be defined as the valuing of images or representations in the wrong way and for the wrong reasons; and an idol, as an image so valued. More particularly, idolatry is the effective tendency to abstract the sense-content from the whole representation and seek that for its own sake, transmuting the admired image into a desired object.—p. 125\n\nThis concept of idolatry is related to Whitehead’s “misplaced concreteness,” as well as Weber’s “disenchantment” (on page 149, Barfield uses the near-equivalent “dis-godded”). But for Barfield’s theology, the concept of participation is crucial. He argues that our current consciousness of the world in terms of self-sufficient and indifferent objects has evolved away from a primitive awareness of unity with the cosmos, which he calls “original participation.” Here he references the ideas of Emile Durkheim and Lucien Levy-Bruhl, although not Mircea Eliade, whose The Sacred and the Profane, also published in 1957, makes similar claims.\n\nThe middle chapters trace this evolution through ancient Greek and late-medieval philosophy, and their need to “save the appearances” of the observed world by reconciling them with more abstract “fundamental principles.” (pp. 47–48). This tension gradually resulted in the complete loss of our increasingly vestigial sense of original participation, and the triumph of “idolatry.”\n\nThe earlier awareness involved experiencing the phenomena as representations; the latter preoccupation involves experiencing them, non-representationally, as objects in their own right, existing independently of human consciousness. This latter experience, in its extreme form, I have called idolatry.—p. 165\n\nAs Barfield goes on to make plain, “Idolatry is an ugly and emphatic word and it was deliberately chosen to emphasize certain ugly features, and still more certain ugly possibilities, inherent in the present situation.” But, as he has stated on page 45, “it is no part of the purpose of this book to advocate a return to original participation.” On the contrary, as a Christian thinker, Barfield equates the “nostalgic hankering after original participation” found, for example, in the poetry of Wordsworth, with the doctrine of pantheism (p. 149). He advocates instead the reconciliation of our idolatry with what he calls “final participation.” This is the growing recognition of participation itself—the figuration and representation surrounding our relationship with the unrepresented—as a fact of our existence and our consciousness. We have come to recognize this in an abstract, academic way (Barfield’s observations in 1957 anticipate the development of postmodernity), but we must learn to embrace the reality of our participation, in order to develop a proper relationship with the world.\n\nIf idolatry is allowed to proceed in its current manner, it poses the danger of eliminating “all meaning and all coherence from the universe. . . science, with the progressive disappearance of original participation, is losing its grip on any principle of unity pervading nature as a whole and the knowledge of nature.” (p. 168) To redress this, and to achieve final participation, we must add “imagination.” Here, as I understand, Barfield is appealing to “Goethean science” and the “anthroposophy” of Rudolf Steiner.\n\nBut imagination alone also presents dangers. The examples Barfield offers on pages 169–170 are, by his own admission, strained: the destructive effect on Switzerland of our romanticizing of its mountains in an age of tourism; the decadence and repulsiveness of modern art (in his opinion); the heresy of pantheism. Still, his point, “taking the long view,” that “we could very well move into a chaotically empty or a fantastically hideous world” seems borne out by the more serious early 21st-century excesses of imagination exemplified by QAnon and similar dislocations.\n\nThe systematic [emphasis added] use of imagination, then, will be requisite for the future, not only for the increase of knowledge, but also for saving the appearances from chaos and inanity. Nor need it involve any relinquishment of the ability which we have won to experience and love nature as objective and independent of ourselves. Indeed, it cannot involve that. . . to be able to experience the representations as idols, and then to be able also to perform the act of figuration consciously, so as to experience them as participated; that is imagination.—p. 171\n\nWith this we have arrived at the “dual relation” that connects Barfield’s thought to my own interests in the Mi’kmaw concept of Two-Eyed Seeing, and my musings on the metaphor of stereopsis, and my Castalian comedy of the Doctrine of the Two Eyes of the Divine. At its core, it is the “Goethean science” of immersion in the world blended with abstraction from it. These are the two perspectives, in this case, to be merged into what I have suggested as the experience of depth.\n\nThere is more to Saving the Appearances. For one thing, Barfield touches briefly on the question of depth perception, and the postponement of perspective techniques in art until the arrival of the scientific revolution (p. 106). There may be enough in this for a separate blog post, especially since Iain McGilchrist has also considered the question.\n\nIt would be extremely remiss not to mention, at least in passing, Barfield’s efforts to weave into his celebration of Goethean science a theology of the intersection of History and the Eternal, involving the Jewish rejection of original participation on spiritual rather than scientific grounds (pp. 123ff), and the related invention of history as a replacement for cyclical time (p. 175). This complex of ideas, which I’ve encountered elsewhere, occupies a considerable part of the book. It informs his view of consciousness as evolving, and—startlingly—of the phenomena as evolving with it, the two being inseparably intertwined by considerations of figuration and representation. Here I think I begin to understand the “anthro-” in “anthroposophy.” But for the moment, neither anthropocentrism nor its embodiment in Christian apologetics is my topic, and on these aspects of the book I’ll remain silent, more or less.\n\nRelated Topics\n\nThe Doctrine of the Two Eyes of the Divine\n\nEliade, McGilchrist, and Two-Eyed Seeing\n\nPlant Intelligence and the Imaginal Realm: Part I—Perceiving Gaia\n\nYou Can’t Make This Stuff Up\n\nOn Properties\n\nA Perspective on Depthlessness\n\nAdditional Resources"
