        "text": "In the realm of clean energy and sustainability, we’re witnessing a collective awakening to the importance of living in harmony with our planet. We’re paving the way for a greener, more sustainable future through innovative technologies. But this transition goes beyond physical solutions and reaches deep into the spiritual realm.\n\nSpirituality, at its core, is about aligning our energy and vibration with the higher frequencies of love, unity, and oneness. It nurtures our connection to ourselves, to others, and to the Earth. As we embark on this journey, we come to realize the profound impact our actions can have in shaping a better world. By aligning our energy with the intention of uplifting the collective consciousness, we become catalysts for transformative change.\n\nStepping into the Light: A Personal Transformation\n\n2012 marked a period of inner turmoil and growth for me—a “dark night of the soul.” In this period of deep introspection, I confronted the illusions of the world and society, peering beyond the surface to uncover a truth that had eluded me before. Though I battled moments of depression during my awakening, I also got inspired to transmute parts of my identity that were no longer working. It was during this time that the connections between technology, marketing, creativity, and consciousness illuminated my path, sparking a fire within me that would guide my journey towards integration and alignment.\n\nI learned how to balance my right and left brain not only for content strategy for my clients – but also to achieve inner harmony. I entered into heightened states to see beyond the surface and gain deeper insights. Through intense introspection and self-reflection, I recognized that my journey was not only about external change – but also about diving inward and aligning my vibration with Source.\n\nClimate Change as Reflection: The Inner and Outer Symbiosis\n\nThe climate crisis that our world faces is not merely a consequence of environmental factors alone. It is also a reflection of the chaotic inner lives of humans, torn apart from their connection to Source and their personal intuition. It arises from the the unconscious projection of shadow aspects deeply ingrained in our conditioning (I interview Paul Levy about this topic on Episode 65 of my podcast here).\n\n“Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” – Carl Jung\n\nThis quote holds significant relevance to the climate crisis we face today. Just as our individual unconscious drives and shadow aspects influence our lives, the collective unconscious of humanity has manifested in the form of environmental devastation and climate change.\n\nTo embody this quote is to explore our own unconscious beliefs and behaviors that contribute to the ecological crisis. By unraveling the hidden forces within ourselves, we can take responsibility for our actions and make conscious choices that align with our values and the well-being of the planet. As we individually transform, our collective awakening can lead to a paradigm shift towards sustainable practices, regenerative systems, and a harmonious coexistence with nature.\n\nHow do clean energy, sustainability, technology, and spirituality intersect?\n\nBoth the scientific advancements in clean energy and our spiritual practices acknowledge the fundamental truth that everything is energy. When we harness the power of clean energy, we tap into a force that resonates with the natural cycles and harmony of the Earth. We align our physical world with the energetic vibrations of love and sustainability.\n\nSpirituality invites us to expand our awareness, to see beyond the material realm and embrace the interconnectedness of all things. As we embark on this inner journey, we radiate a higher vibrational frequency—one that aligns with the intentions of clean energy and sustainability. It becomes a seamless dance of energy and intention, where our actions in the physical realm echo the intentions we set in the energetic realm.\n\nAt the heart of Clean Energy initiatives lies empathy for Earth, reverence for resources, and technological innovation for a sustainable future. Aligning this with Spirituality, we understand that we, as a collective consciousness, vibrate at the frequency of empathy, love, and profound respect for our shared cosmic home. Our work in the clean energy industry is, therefore, not just a technological endeavor but a spiritual journey towards higher consciousness.\n\nThe clean energy technologies, by their very nature, are designed to exist in concert with the natural world, harnessing the power of the wind, sun, and water. This harmonious relationship closely correlates with the spiritual teachings of universal symbiosis which are critical to us vibrating at our highest potential.\n\nEverything is energy & vibration\n\nEnergy flows through us, connecting us to one another and to our shared Earth. This fundamental principle is what clean energy technology encapsulates. It takes the very vibes of our planet – the rushing water, the glowing sun, the sweeping wind – and turns it into a renewable source of power. When sustainability harmonizes with the spiritual journey, we can see the interconnectedness of these seemingly distinct domains.\n\nWhether you’re on the path of technological innovation or undertaking the spiritual journey towards higher vibrations or both, remember: these paths intertwine. They both strive for a sustainable future and resonate with the rhythm of Earth.\n\nSign up for more of my insights below.\n\nComplete with blog posts, resources, and tools\n\nExciting projects in the NFT world got the best of me at the end of 2021 and I didn’t whip together a book reading list at the end of the year like I usually do. So here we are about halfway into 2022 and I’m finally compiling my reading list. It’s no secret that books fuel creativity which is why every year I reflect on how I’ve incorporated books into my life. Here are the 50 books I read in 2018, the 11 books I read in 2019, and the 30 books I read in 2020.\n\nEven though I wrote a book about “humanizing your brand,” I still sometimes feel like I have an image to maintain – and that I will be judged for not reading more books about business or marketing. A part of me is also hesitant to share just how fascinated I am about realms and energies unseen. The truth is that these books impact my work with my clients more so than any “marketing” book. Plus these are my interests and my fascinations and I’m not here to apologize.\n\nAs an ENFP I notice how I want to study the intuition and subjective nature of my left brain -but I analyze with my right brain. Both the right and left brain is needed for strategy and it’s interesting that as an ENFP, it’s a paradox in that we often try to understand something unexplainable through “logic.”\n\nAnyway, here’s my reading list for 2021:\n\n1. The Book of Secrets by Osho\n\nI read this on my Kindle in 2015 and didn’t realize how big the book was until I saw it in a book store. It’s enormous so I finally bought the hard copy and pick it up whenever I need a bit of inspiration.\n\n2. The Alphabet vs. the Goddess: The Conflict Between Word and Image\n\nby Leonard Shlain\n\nThis book explores the connections across brain function, myth, and anthropology. It explains why pre-literate cultures were mainly informed by holistic, right-brain modes that venerated the Goddess and feminine values. While writing drove cultures toward linear left-brain thinking. This shift upset the balance between men and women, initiating the decline of the feminine and ushering in patriarchal rule.\n\n3. Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money\n\nI’ve been immersed in decentralized finance world for the past decade. I got involved in projects before anyone even had the ability to write books about the topic. This book is a solid foundation on decentralization.\n\n4. Recapture the Rapture: Rethinking God, Sex, and Death in a World That’s Lost Its Mind\n\nMy friend Robbe gifted me this book and I’m so glad he did. In a world where nihilism is filling our void, what are the consequences that affect us all? How can we be at our best when despair, tribalism, and disaster fatigue are leaving us at our worst? This book has some of the answers.\n\n5. The Art of Contemplation: A gentle path to wholeness and prosperity by Richard Rudd\n\nI’m highly influenced by Richard’s work. I interviewed Richard on my podcast in Episode 35. His other book, The Gene Keys, inspired me to become a Gene Keys facilitator.\n\n6. Productivity is for Robots: How To (re)Connect, Get Creative, And Stay Human In The New World by my friend Corey McComb\n\nHe also has an amazing TedX talk. You’re really not a productivity expert until you give a TedX talk about the downfalls of…productivity.\n\n7. Future Poetry by Sri Aurobindo\n\nI love everything Aurobindo wrote. This book explores futuristic architectures as well as poetic vistas of the past, present, and future.\n\n8. The Hidden Forces of Life by Sri Aurobindo\n\nI’m fascinated with Aurobindo’s relationship with the Mother. This book is a compilation from the works of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother on hidden forces and how they influence our thoughts, feelings, and actions and determine the course of events in life.\n\n9. Poetic Diction: A Study in Meaning by Owen Barfield\n\nThis book is dense and it’s the only book on my list that I haven’t read in its entirety. Maybe it’ll resonate with me more in the future.\n\n10. The Archaic Revival: Speculations on Psychedelic Mushrooms, the Amazon, Virtual Reality, UFOs, Evolution, Shamanism, the Rebirth of the Goddess, and the End of History by Terence McKenna\n\nMcKenna is one of my biggest inspirations and this book encapsulates the new wave of neo-shamanism.\n\n11. Letting Go: The Pathway of Surrender by David Hawkins\n\nHawkins is one of my favorite spiritual teachers. This book is a classic.\n\n12. The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran\n\nA collection of poetic essays that are philosophical and spiritual.\n\nJoin me on the adventure of consciousness, creativity, decentralized finance, and collaborative business.\n\nSubscribe to get my articles in your inbox here.\n\nDAOs are a community with a shared bank account (this is the most simple/best definition I’ve seen from Invisible College). While NFTs provide ownership for creators, DAOs provide governance. DAOs are decentralized communities; they work toward a specific goal with no hierarchy and token-based decision-making.\n\nDAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) caught attention when an organization known as ConstitutionDAO, made up of 17,437 people formed a “flash mob” to raise almost $40 million to acquire an authentic copy of the US Constitution. A higher bidder eventually surpassed ConstitutionDAO, but the DAO completed its job and showed the world how autonomy could replace the old hierarchical structure of leaders, managers, and employees.\n\nAutonomous: (adjective) / ɔːˈtɒnəməs / – Having the freedom to govern oneself or control ones own affairs.\n\nThe History Of DAOs\n\nSlock.it established ‘TheDAO’ on Ethereum in 2016 as a method to coordinate investment in, and control of, a treasury of $theDAO tokens. $150 million in $ETH had been deposited by the end of the four-week sale in exchange for 1.2 billion tokens, each worth 0.01 $ETH.\n\nIn retrospect, this was an unfathomable burden to impose on such little shoulders: TheDAO smart contract was written in Solidity, which was just a few months old and required the documentation and battle-testing needed for production.\n\nOn June 17, 2016, hackers utilized a recursive call to carry out a’re-entrance exploit, draining 30% of the treasury cash. Following the breach, the Ethereum community agreed to fork the blockchain at block 1,920,000 to learn from the event.\n\nSolidity has accumulated years of developer time and is used in millions of smart contracts to manage over $100 billion in funds five years after the TheDAO attack.\n\nThe area’s sophistication already transcends traditional finance on a protocol level, in the sense that certain activities like flash loans have no equivalent outside of Decentralized Finance (DeFi).\n\nDemocratic and transparent decision-making is the goal of DAOs.\n\nDAOs could one day replace your current employer, and it won’t be a surprise if they do.\n\nSo let’s start with the nitty-gritty of DAOs first.\n\nDecentralized autonomous organizations are:\n\nWithout a centralized leadership structure, member-owned communities\n\nA secure haven for charitable donations.\n\nSafe method to work with strangers on the internet\n\nDAOs are all about building communities. But people only contribute to communities if they trust that their time and energy are going to be put to good use.\n\nWhat Is a Dao?\n\nDAOs, which stand for decentralized autonomous organizations, are the next generation. They are groups of people who work together to achieve a common goal without a single person in charge.\n\nDAOs are a convenient and secure method to collaborate with people worldwide who share your values. It is a non-hierarchical organization. A community forms around a set of rules upheld on a blockchain to make decisions from the ground up. Think of them as a collaboratively owned and managed internet-based enterprise. They have funds that can only be accessed with the group’s consent. Voting is used to ensure that all organization members have a say in making decisions.\n\nFor example, PleasrDAO members chose to buy the Wu-Tang Clan CD together. They then drafted an NFT to serve as a legal document transferring ownership of the album. PleasrDAO’s members co-own the NFT deed and, therefore, the album.\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nTeams with elected leaders may form in larger DAOs to address various parts of the organization. In this approach, not all members are required to vote on every aspect of the proposal.\n\nTransparency is the most crucial feature of DAOs. Every decision made by the DAO is proposed, reviewed, voted on, and published in the public domain for future reference.\n\nNeither a corrupt CEO nor a shady CFO has the power to authorize spending based on their whims. The DAO’s code includes spending regulations and every aspect of the DAO’s operations is publicly accessible.\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nDAO can be used for a wide range of purposes. These organizations make it feasible for freelancer networks to pool their finances to pay for software subscriptions, charitable groups to authorize gifts, and group-owned venture capital firms.\n\nOne of the Dao’s most important aspects is that they allow businesses and institutions to work together toward a common goal without knowing one another. To ensure that no shareholder can alter the rules of a DAO in the future—at least not without a majority vote—the rules are recorded on a visible, secure, and open-source blockchain ledger.\n\nBut you might wonder what is the hype and how does a computer program know what’s in the organization’s best interest?\n\nDAOs Employ Game Theory\n\nComputer code operating a DAO employs complex economic principles, such as game theory, to ensure that its interests and future direction are aligned with its stated purpose. Shareholders of the DAO also participate in the decision-making process by submitting and voting on proposals. Stakeholders use governing tokens to vote. The more tokens a stakeholder has, the greater the impact of their vote on the network will be. For a proposal to take effect, it must be supported by most governance tokens and adhere to the DAO’s consensus rules.\n\nDAO Compensation\n\nDAOs can stream payments to contributors via Sablier or Superfluid,\n\nbulk-distribute tokens through Roll or disperse.app\n\nfund grants through its Gnosis Safe multisig,\n\nand keep track of payments via treasury management tools like Parcel and Multis.\n\nDAOs can even offer something akin to an employee stock option plan (ESOP) by locking tokens in an options contract and streaming call options to contributors over some vesting period.\n\nTools like SourceCred quantify and assign “cred” to activities like Github issues, PR commits, and Discourse posts.\n\nDrawing inspiration from SourceCred, Govrn takes this a step further and works with individual DAOs to create a “Movement Model,” in which the community assigns weight to different types of contributions depending on its priorities.\n\nFrameworks (such as the example below) for evaluating different types of contributions for the DAO are helpful to ensure their success:\n\nDAOs come in a variety of types.\n\nIt’s vital to remember that DAO is a broad term that refers to various organizations and corporations. Even if the two collectives are substantially different, they are also DAOs. On this are a few well-known DAO examples:\n\nPleasrDAO: It invests in other assets and collects other NFTs.\n\nHerStory DAO: It is a non-profit organization that gathers and sponsors initiatives by Black women and non-binary artists.\n\nKomorebi Collective DAO: It supports women and non-binary crypto entrepreneurs.\n\nFriendswithBenefits DAO: It is a private social club that requires a fee to join.\n\nMetaCartel Venture DAO: It is a for-profit company that invests in decentralized applications in their early stages.\n\nWhat’s Goin’ On with DAOs?\n\nSmart contracts govern the DAO and are written by core community members. The DAO’s functional architecture is laid out in these smart contracts. Every stage of the process is laid out so that anyone who wants to join may see exactly what’s going on at all times.\n\nOnce these rules are in place, it’s time for the next DAO development phase, which revolves around finance and governance. By selling tokens to raise money and fill the DAO’s treasury, this is often how the protocol accomplishes its goals. Some voting privileges are granted to token holders in exchange for their fiat currency.\n\nThe DAO is ready to be deployed once financing has been secured. Once the code is sent into production, it can no longer be altered by any other method than a unanimous vote by the organization’s members. The community of token holders can only change the DAO’s rules; no one else can change them.\n\nLayers Of DAOs\n\nDAOs communicate with each other over a range of coherence and trust levels. Patrick Rawson, who is Financial Controller at Staxo, says,\n\n“Distributing ownership to squadlike units with more specific aims is the key long-term difficulty to address.”\n\nSquad-like entities are smaller teams with trust relationships, similar to the gaming guilds that work alongside DAOs to complete missions consistent with their core values and goals. An in-depth analysis reveals that effective DAOs behave more like teams than the loosely coordinated swarm intelligence they appear to be, such as the network of 100 connected cooperatives that makes up the MONDRAGON Corporation. It is possible to sketch three layers of a DAO, based on Rawson’s analysis:\n\nToken: multi-organizational networks that are aligned by the ownership of a token.\n\nTeam: Token ownership represents teams, guilds, and squads.\n\nMission: Token ownership funds missions, milestones, and raids.\n\nA heterarchical network or system capable of being ranked in numerous ways emerges from these levels. It shows how tokens, teams, and tasks are spread among several DAO networks, which may be ranked or sorted in various ways.\n\nDAO networks that use tokens are more likely to be run democratically for those ecosystems that place a high value on sharing ownership. While teams and objectives aren’t restricted to the quasi-institutional limits of a single DAO, token ownership in several DAOs can and should represent them in a meaningful way for the control network to become genuinely decentralized.\n\nIn What Ways Does A DAO Generate Revenue?\n\nDividends from the organization’s investments are typically how a DAO makes money. People beginning a DAO can also make money by persuading people to invest in them based on their business concept.\n\nAfter the fall in 2016, DAOs are making a victorious comeback with the growth of NFTs and cryptocurrencies. DAOs have been dubbed “the ideal mix of capitalism and progressive” by billionaire Mark Cuban. Entrepreneurs may make a lot of money with DAOs but only if their community “excels at governance” and if they can make a collective choice.\n\nThe Impact of DAOS on the World\n\nThe DAO market is evolving at a rapid rate. It can only cover a fraction of the existing projects and even fewer new use cases are being developed daily.\n\nDAOs are mini-parties with integrated treasuries and responsible civic services. To reduce the complexity of administering several domains, DAOs usually specialize in a particular vertical. DAOs have more diversity, meritocracy, and complex voting systems.\n\nOrganization Design\n\nThe names and details of these groups vary across DAOs, but we can roughly group them by their operational functions:\n\nHow DAOs Are Beneficial\n\nDAOs have the potential to enable a wide range of previously unimaginable business models. This opens the door to all kinds of autonomously structured and run organizations, such as distributed venture capital firms, decentralized hedge funds, decentralized governments, decentralized public utilities, and basically any other decentralized entity your imagination can conjure up.\n\nDAOs directly benefit consumers in the following ways:\n\nComplete ownership of your investments; entities are held programmatically liable for any creations that result from a DAO crowd sale, increasing the likelihood of a return for consumers (no more canceled KickStarters who simply “couldn’t make it happen”).\n\nAllows individuals worldwide to compete on an equal footing when deciding which businesses or organizations to invest in.\n\nComplete transparency reduces the risk to consumers’ investments, and individuals can be better informed about strategic business decisions made in real-time.\n\nAbility to peer-to-peer trade and sell your unique DAO tokens to others without requiring complex technical or financial knowledge.\n\nDAO investors can participate in a project from start to finish without dealing with complicated regulatory hurdles or paperwork.\n\nIndividuals can create “templates” or “smart contracts,” allowing these types of DAOs to function.\n\nWhat Challenges Do DAOs Face?\n\nPolitics\n\nThe typical bipolar oppositions of collectivism and individuality can impede growth (to put it mildly…)\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nLegal\n\nThe regulatory context in which DAOs operate is completely unknown. It remains evident how different countries will build regulatory frameworks for these new forms of organizations. A constantly unpredictable regulatory landscape, on the other hand, could be a big impediment to DAO adoption.\n\nCoordinated Attacks\n\nDAOs have substantial performance and security costs due to their desirable qualities (decentralization, immutability, and trustlessness). While some of the possible companies that can emerge as DAOs are undeniably intriguing, they also bring a significant amount of risk that isn’t present in traditional organizations.\n\nCentralization points\n\nDecentralization is more of a spectrum, with each level suited to a distinct type of use case. Full autonomy or decentralization may not be practicable or desirable in some instances.\n\nCulture\n\nTwo things are true when it comes to culture with DAOs:\n\nContent catalyzes cultural change.\n\nInternet-native influencers define what culture looks like from the bottom-up. Asynchronous work is only as strong as the culture – which means that everything needs to be codified and nothing is done by default. DAOs that put care into setting up how things work will thrive.\n\nDAOs have no hierarchy which allows more people to interact than ever before. This is a blessing or a curse depending on how the DAO is set up. For example, it might be more difficult to coordinate and move quickly compared to centralized leadership like a CEO making quick decisions when necessary.\n\nStill, the protocol’s governance rules will always be a source of centralization. It might be argued that centralized organizations can operate more efficiently while sacrificing the benefits of open participation.\n\nWhile DAOs are growing in prominence, it’s still too early to predict what DAOs will become in the future. Despite this, leaders can learn some valuable lessons from this emerging form of organization.\n\nYou can collect this article as an NFT on Mirror.xyz.\n\nFollow my writing on decentralized finance by subscribing below.\n\nDisclaimer: The content covered in this article is NOT to be considered investment advice.

Do NOT trade or invest based purely upon the information presented in this article.\n\nOne of the most inspiring commencement speeches is by one of my favorite writers, David Foster Wallace:\n\nThere are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says,\n\n“Morning, boys, how’s the water?”\n\nAnd the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, “What the hell is water?”\n\nMany business owners today don’t see the water right in front of their faces. They’re following the “school” of fish with their outdated marketing tactics, not able to see the bigger picture of what’s really happening.\n\nToday:\n\nConsumers can spot your sales funnel. And they’re not buying.\n\nWhat worked just a year ago no longer works today.\n\nSpending thousands of dollars on a “launch” doesn’t work (we’re launching in every connection that we make).\n\nIt’s easy to not see something when it’s everywhere and right in front of your face.\n\n“Content marketing is the only marketing that’s left.” — Seth Godin\n\nSeth Godin clarifies this point in Episode 40 of my podcast. He says that “the content of what we do — the essence of the change that we make — that’s marketing. The spin and the hype and promotion is not marketing.”\n\nWhat is Embodied Marketing?\n\nThe definition of Embodiment is “the representation or expression of something in a tangible or visible form.” Embodied Marketing is marketing that’s embodied in actions, beyond the GIF humor and clichéd quotes. It allows you to build your own unique sales funnel because it steps away from the one-size-fits-all approach to marketing. And it takes marketing one step further: It offers you the techniques, encouragement and feedback to guide your business into the right currents.\n\nEmbodied Marketing is a conversation that swims with the school of innovation, technology, and ideas. It’s:\n\nFluid instead of static\n\nMore about the soul instead of the ego\n\nEnergy tunnels instead of sales funnels\n\nEmbodied Marketing rebels against the static of the online noise in a quiet, sincere way.\n\nIt calls out the status quo so that you can start not just seeing the water, but feeling the water too.\n\nWhat’s disembodied marketing?\n\nIt’s a cover-up for not engaging more deeply. It doesn’t have meaning, purpose or soul. The failed luxury music festival, Fyre Festival, is an example of disembodiment in our culture today. Influencer Marketers were posting for the ego. The entire marketing strategy was focused on promotion without even knowing what was at the core of the festival. Instead of the luxury villas and gourmet meals for which festival attendees paid thousands of dollars, they received prepackaged sandwiches and FEMA tents as their accommodations. The Fyre Festival is an example of how the pursuit of fame puts a strain on our time, energy and resources.\n\nEmbodied Marketing exudes a sense of meaning and stimulation; it adds a new dimension to who and what you are, through using the peaks and valleys of our human experience.\n\nContent marketing is the tactic. And consciousness is the strategy.\n\nIn other words, content creates your reality — but your experiences need to be embodied first and foremost.\n\nEmbodied Marketing creates marketing with more meaning. It allows you to become more mindful of your emotions and patterns and, in turn, use this internal GPS as “data” and guidance to create self-expression in your marketing.\n\nWe’ve evolved past creating content that simply checks a box. We need marketing that communicates the essence of the change that we make.\n\nEmbodied Marketing is how it’s done.\n\nEmbodied marketing is all about reflection before you post anything. When your post is based on your perception, your audience will see their own reflection through you. Your perception causes greater awareness. And awareness is what summons your new reality, removing the mystery to your content strategy.\n\nCompanies can no longer walk around with masks and hope to be seen. We need to cut to the core, to be more fully understood — and create from this place. Embodied Marketing intersects consciousness and content marketing.\n\nWho is Embodied Marketing for?\n\nIt’s for CMOs, digital marketers, entrepreneurs and transformative leaders who are seeking a more effective way to connect with their customers. Embodied Marketing is for you if you want to be proud of your content that you publish and distribute. Embodied Marketing will help you to create content that’s aligned and invigorating.\n\nIt’s a co-creative content strategy with soul-aligned entrepreneurs and visionaries.\n\nI’ll be walking you through how to do this in a 7-day #embodiedmarketingchallenge.\n\nSign up here to learn more."
