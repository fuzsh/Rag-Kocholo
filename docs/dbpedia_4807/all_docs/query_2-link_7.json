Let’s see what effect this has. No other direct oddities. All 13 forwards will get playing time, Linus Öberg who waited in the stands together with Otto Stenberg. As for Filip Hasa, it is still unclear when his neck allows play, when the symptoms (dizziness, nausea) are so rare that he is deemed okay. Quick recap otherwise for those who haven’t followed along:\n\nNoah Dower Nilsson has undergone yet another shoulder operation in Detroit, USA. The season is thus over. He should be in action when next season starts. Gustav Rydahl’s back surgery was successful, the nerve pain in his leg is gone, he has been on ice for some time; Rydahl should be able to join sometime in August when training starts following the holidays. Mats Rosseli Olsen, you know the situation, he is far from playing hockey but is said to be feeling a little better now.\n\n***\n\nSkellefteå is still missing star defender Jonathan Pudas, he is on ice, but not yet in team training. Nor does tonight start Linus Söderströmeven though he was in Friday’s warm-up. The team, according to norran.se (however, of course Skellefteå does not play with fives but chains and back pairs:\n\nScreenshot\n\n***\n\nA bit fast:\n\n## Hard to get over Frölunda’s power play breakdown on Wednesday, it was a mental collapse that might have cost the team the match, which probably would have if Lasse Johansson didn’t save everything and Tom Nilsson shot sharply. Frölunda does not need to get a PP game that gives goals, on the other hand, it is of the utmost importance that it is not so self-confident, so darkly weak that the players lose momentum, give this away to Skellefteå. Interesting to see what kind of corrections Frölunda’s coaching team made, if they managed to get the players to relax. In the Thursday text below, I addressed Jörgen Pettersson’s advice from last year, i.e. to play with regular back pairs/chains. Of course it won’t happen, I thought it was interesting anyway.\n\nPP is Rönnberg’s main concern, time to listen to the NHL legend\n\n► Something needs to be done in Frölunda. Something drastic. Otherwise, Skellefteå wins the semi-final series. ► Here you read regarding what. Frölunda must solve the PP puzzle. And it’s not easy – it’s all in the players’ skulls. – I thought regarding playing the second goalkeeper, said Roger Rönnberg. I myself remember Jörgen Pettersson’s words. Maybe time to listen to the legend. YOU WHO WATCHED Frölunda’s semi-final 3 once morest Skellefteå (2-0) know what it’s all regarding. The power play wasn’t bad – it was completely action-crippled. We have seen the trends for some time, actually since the end of the regular season (Frölunda finished with 20 PP minutes without a goal). Glimpses good once morest Leksand, often […]\n\nREAD MORE\n\n## Andreas Johnson has gotten into some verbal duels with Frölunda players, most recently Tom Nilsson. Here you meet ex-Frölundaite Johnson.\n\nEx-frölundaite Johnson in focus: “A fun series for me”\n\n► Andreas Johnson – the Gothenburger who wants to win SM gold with Skellefteå, but first it’s regarding knocking out old club Frölunda. ► There has been some talk. Here he talks himself. Skellefteå–Frölunda – quite a lot with Andreas Johnson in a leading role. “Chasing legs”, he accused Frölunda of following match 1. In match 3 he scolded Tom Nilsson. – He pulled his leg once more. He’s done it twice now, on Max (Lindholm) as well, Johnson said spontaneously following Thursday’s practice in Scandinavium. NOT THAT he made a world of it, Andreas Johnson, not at all, but given the TV pictures that showed how […]\n\nREAD MORE\n\n## Skellefteå has not yet netted in PP once morest Frölunda in this series, this despite almost twelve minutes in numerical superiority. Given that Robert Ohlsson’s gang created chances, even if Frölunda worked hard and well – discipline feels like a key for Roger Rönnberg’s gang.\n\n## In semi-final 1 it was Oscar Lindberg which got away with a slew foot-type story on it Mikael Ruohomaa. In semi-final 3 it was Max Friberg who escaped punishment even though he clearly hit Pär Lindholms head. Not at all that I screamed for a match penalty and suspension that time either (you know I rarely do that), but it might be appropriate to point out that there really is a difference between the regular season and the playoffs. Credit to Skellefteå’s players who stand up, by the way. Pär Lindholm in this case, the names Max when he went down the hill following Tom Nilsson’s missed hip tackle in game 2.\n\n## Otto Stenberg is back from his time in Bik Karlskoga where he was loaned out because it was difficult to get playing time in Frölunda. Stenberg’s PP qualities have made some supporters want to see the 18-year-old go straight into Frölunda’s semi-final team, however, coach Roger Rönnberg said in this text:\n\n– I don’t think it’s a player (who is the problem). If it had been the case that (Mikael) Ruohomaa is really bad in the power play, that the solution had been to replace Ruohomaa, then I would have done it, but I don’t think that is the case. I think they take turns playing less well.\n\n## This is what Skellefteå’s Robert Ohlsson said on Thursday ahead of Friday’s semifinal 4:\n\n– I think we had good things in the third period that we can build on. Then it’s another match, 0-0 on the board, but absolutely, the feeling is good, we have faith in what we’re doing. It’s an even series, it’s regarding being on the right side of those small, small, small margins, the bounces, maybe poking in a goal on the power play. That’s what it’s all regarding.\n\n## Don’t miss drop time 19.30. This is because TV12 is now broadcasting. Upcoming matches with times:\n\nSunday: Skellefteå–Frölunda 18.30.\n\nIf necessary:\n\nTuesday: Frölunda–Skellefteå 19.30\n\nThursday: Skellefteå–Frölunda 19.30.\n\n## You who ask regarding Champions Hockey League: in order for Frölunda to qualify for next season, it is necessary to win SM gold. Sweden has three places, Färjestad and Växjö are already qualified, they will be joined by Rögle, Skellefteå or Frölunda.\n\n***\n\nHit Gustav Rydahlyou who have not yet read.\n\nRydahl has to settle for watching: “Damn hard, actually”\n\n► The star center was brought home to lead Frölunda. All that will have to wait until next season. ► How is Gustav Rydahl? What is it like to sit next to it? What does he think regarding his team’s chances once morest Skellefteå? Here you get answers. Semi-final. Scandinavium sold out. This is when Gustav Rydahl would have been at his best. Instead: on the sidelines, long rehab. – It’s damn hard, actually, admits Rydahl. But he believes in his Frölunda once morest Skellefteå: – It leans in our favor. THE BACK SPOILED THE HOMECOMING to Sweden for the powerful center; hard and painful autumn, surgery last winter, long rehab time, right now mostly gym […]"
