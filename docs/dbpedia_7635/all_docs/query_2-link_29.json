        "text": "W.W. Jacobs creates suspense using a mysterious monkey’s paw. Ricky Lewis Jr. attempted to create similar suspense using different techniques. As told in the story in the book,”He took the paw, and dangling it between his forefinger and thumb, suddenly threw it upon the fire. White, with a slight cry, stooped down and snatched it off. ”Better let it burn,” said the soldier solemnly. “If you don’t want it, Morris,” said the other, “give it to me.”.”I won’t said his friend doggedly.”I threw it on the fire. If you keep it, don’t blame me for what if happens. Pitch it on the fire like a sensible man.”(Jacobs,108) Therefore, W.W. Jacobs fundamentally builds suspense with the dialogue between Morris, who owned the paw initially, and Mr. White, who was interested and curious on what the paw had to offer.\n\nThe author Truman Capote reconstructs the slaying in 1959 of a farm family in Holcomb, Kansas which created a media frenzy and the investigation that led to the capture, trial, and execution of the killers, Capote generates suspense and empathy, the Clutter family is murdered by Dick Hickcock and Perry smith. A majority of the book is primarily about how they go on a run together, get arrested, and spend their time in jail. Dick and Perry are actually quite opposite. Perry had an unfortunate childhood; his mother was an alcoholic who died when he was young. His father was quite abusive, and he had been moved around a lot.\n\nIn my analysis I will be looking at a scene near the end of the film where Bud White and Ed Exeley take part in a shootout at the victory motel. The narrative conveys very common noir aspects here; the shootout takes place in a very dark room. The only light comes from outside. This shows the mood of the scene to be sinister and bleak. It puts the audience in a scared state as the shadows can conceal anything. It is also hard to see what White and Exeley are doing. The shadows are very menacing because they use a chiaroscuro lighting effect. This means that the rooms, people and settings are hidden from view by shadows. The blinds over the window cast strong grid shadowing over the characters showing uncertainty and anxiety. This lighting is very common in film-noir films as it shows the seediness of the settings. The\n\nOver the past few weeks we have watched a few horror movies “Jaws, “The Others”, “Signs” and “Frankenstein” but today we are just focusing on these three movies: “Jaws”, “The Others” and “Signs”. “Frankenstein” was just a flat out boring movie because it was a movie that was black and white and it showed portrayed nothing about how it made the movie suspenseful and scary. “Jaws” was a movie that was made in 1975 which had nothing to scare people of this generation but at least they used appropriate techniques to make the movie suspenseful. “The Others was a movie that was made in 2001 and they did a excellent job of foreshadowing by stating the obvious at the beginning of the movie but the weird part was nobody got what they meant but with this said I don’t think that the movie had used better techniques than “Signs”, in “Signs” I think their techniques standed out the most primarily because of the special effects they used to make the movie jaw-dropping, blood curdling and eye-catching with this said I think the movie “Signs” did the best job in using the proper techniques to create suspense and fear in addition the director of the movie “Signs”, M. Night, Shyamalan, has been nominated for 2 Best Screenplay awards and 1 Best Director award for the movie “Signs” alone.\n\nStephen King’s The Shining has maintained its cult status since its release in 1977. The Shining begins with Jack Torrance receiving a position as the winter caretaker for The Overlook Hotel, an isolated hotel in the Colorado Rockies. Jack hopes the stay will be therapeutic and allow him to focus on writing, family, and less on alcohol. As time progresses, unsettling events begin to transpire for Jack, his son Danny, and his wife Wendy. The intensity of the gothic novel came to life by the legendary Stanley Kubrick in 1980. The book was admired by fans, but Kubrick’s reimagining made it the iconic classic that it is today. Stephen King was not as fond of the movie. Although some of Kubrick’s take on The Shining complements the book, King\n\nIn Alice in Wonderland, while Alice is falling down what seems to be a never ending hole, the lighting changes to a frightening darkness to an eerie yellow. This causes the mood to change because it is not exactly terrifying but it is not at all happy. It makes the mood a bit terrifying but it is also a bit overwhelming. With the lighting changing quickly since she is falling so fast it just makes the mood just a little too much. A similar effect is created in Charlie in the Chocolate Factory. At one point in the tour, the guests were all on a dragon boat going through a tunnel. While in the tunnel there was just enough light to see the characters and quite a few ominous shadows. This sets the mood to be very anxious and suspenseful. In something as fun as riding a dragon boat on a chocolate river, it starts to look like a horror movie. In his other film, Edward Scissorhands, there was a scene of the house Edward grew up in. The lighting had been manipulated to a point where it was not dark but it was not quite bright either. This placed the mood at secured yet anxious feeling because you could see everything but it was still dark. Although this cinematic technique is very effective, the most noticeable technique is\n\nFirst and foremost, The Shining uses setting as a main factor to help portray America and its instability. The film starts out with a deep winding road along with the Rocky Mountains that can be taken to pursue the idea of the struggle that lay ahead for the characters in the film or for the Natives that this film tries to implicitly show. The scenery can represent America and as it is shown in a continuous shot, it also displays the endless opportunities America is known for, however as the camera continuously pans for a few more seconds, a sense of despair comes across you and the long twisty road suggests the impossibility of escape. The manager of the Overlook, Ullman suggests that the Hotel is haunted which ties in with the fact that the Hotel and America has had a very aggressive history that may still haunt us today. Reporter Bill Blakemore pointed out in Room 237 that Kubrick’s team had to research the town and hotel’s history, which showed Navajo tribe tensions with the the white men in the early 1900s. Blackmore also writes about how the name of the hotel connects with the fact that this film addresses the fact that America overlooks the Native American genocide or even the racism in the country.\n\nSuspense is when the author makes the reader, or audience excited or scared for what might happen in the story, or even what will happen to the character next in the story. Suspense might even be something you see or hear that will make you have questions about what will happen next. If there is a cliffhanger at the end of a story, it will leave you with questions wondering what will happen to the characters next. The mood, tone, setting, emotions of character, sound and sight might affect how the story is suspenseful. We all enjoy watching suspenseful movies and reading stories, because they are exciting. It leaves us with questions that the author won't have the answers to in the end, so the author gives us as the audience, the chance to make up their own ending to the story or movie. The author will give you clues throughout the story, to help you fill in questions you might have in the end. This makes it more exciting for the reader and the audience because we get to engage with the characters in the book or movie. The tv series, Stranger Things, is about 4 kids who have to fight off monsters in a little town in Indiana. This TV show is a great example of suspense, and it shows it effectively because, of Foreshadowing, Dilemma, and Dramatic Irony presented throughout the show. With just using those four examples, Stranger Things is a great example of suspense.\n\nHorror films are known for their ability to scare audiences, to get the audience’s hearts racing, their blood rushing. A good horror film will cause viewers to be on the edge of their seats and having their perception of reality distorted as they attempt to understand the unraveling plot of the horror film. The tone of the film aides in the amount of suspense that a horror film produces, since a much darker film will create a more suspenseful atmosphere than one that is more focused on campy monster makeup. But the tone of a film is determined by the sound of the film, or in other words, the score. Sound or music in a horror film, or the lack thereof, make the intense scenes and without the addition\n\nBased on Stephen King’s horror novel of the same name, Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining features hallways filled with butchered daughters, and their guts and blood splashed down the hall. Horror and realism fuel Kubrick’s notoriously disturbing films and The Shining stands clear-cut amongst them. Although in the case of this movie, Kubrick shifts emphasis from visual horror to psychological fear and instills mounting dread from the sequence of disturbing events. Kubrick states, “one of the things that horror stories can do is show us the archetypes of the unconscious; we can see the dark side without having to confront it directly.” Never falling flat, The Shining provides a psychological horror masterpiece complete with brilliant acting, tight camera angles, haunting score, and unanswered questions."
