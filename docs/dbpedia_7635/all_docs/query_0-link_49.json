        "text": "This article is incompatible with the Visual Editor. Please edit with the source editor instead.\n\nUltraman Victory (ウルトラマンビクトリー, Urutoraman Bikutorī) is an ancient Ultra who first appears in Ultraman Ginga S. He is the guardian of an underground race of people called the Victorians and the guardian of the Victorium Stone. He transforms using the Victory Lancer and uses Spark Dolls to access the power of monsters via his signature ability of Ultlance.\n\nConception[]\n\nDesign[]\n\nThe most notable feature of the Ultra is that Victory has a large V-shaped crystal on his head and a V-shaped Color Timer. He shows some resemblance to Ultraman Ginga because he also has crystals/glowing parts on his head, arms and legs. Ultraman Victory also has black and red markings on his body. This is unique because previously, black was a color associated only with Dark/Evil Ultras, with Ultraman Nexus being an exception. Since then, the color black has been appearing more frequently in Ultra Heroes.\n\nHistory[]\n\nUltraman Ginga S[]\n\nIn ancient times, Ultraman Victory came from space and gave the Victorians the Victory Lancer, which a \"chosen one\" used to seal the Victorium Stones due to their potential to be used for nefarious desires if they fell into the wrong hands. However, when a civil war ensued over the use of Victory Lancer, Shepherdon, a peaceful monster that coexisted with them was influenced by the battle and rampaged until a Victorian used the item and becomes Ultraman Victory to stop it. Eventually, Shepherdon returns back to its former self but in the aftermath of the battle, several Victorians were banished to the other dimension, among them was Hiyori. While the remained ones forgot, Shepherdon still remembers it.\n\nAfter Alien Chibull Exceller sent his armies to steal the stones, Sho, a Victorian Prince was given the Victory Lancer by his mother to retrieve it and allowed him the ability to transform himself into the ancient Ultra.\n\nDuring the Ultra's first fight against Android One Zero as EX Red King, Hikaru/Ginga came to help him by defeating the monster but as he was about to claim the Spark Doll, Sho/Victory stole it from him and Ultlance with the item to utilize EX Red King Knuckle, confronting the red Ultra for unknown reasons. The Opening Force\n\nAfter Sho was saved by Hikaru from the falling rocks from the buildings destroyed by Eleking, he tried to repay Hikaru's sacrifice by transforming to stop Eleking. However, he was overpowered by the beast's tail. Hikaru transformed into Ginga, saving Victory by slowing Eleking down, but he too was overpowered. As the Ultras were being beaten, Victory leapt to the sky, performing the Victory Hyper Kick on Eleking. He then used the Victorium Slash five times on the beast before he Ultlance using the EX Red King doll. Using EX Red King Knuckle, he punched Eleking, knocking the kaiju back. He then finished Eleking off with his Victorium Shoot. Though Sho had finally reconciled with Hikaru, he still adopted his aloof persona until his battle with Sadola and Gudon, where he realized that he had been fighting with hesitation and thus he completely changed his heart towards humanity. Ginga VS Victory\n\nWhen Alien Chibull Exceller Monslive on his own with the Spark Dolls of Fire Golza, Melba, Reicubas, Gan-Q, and Super C.O.V. he became the powerful gestalt, Five King and killed Ultraman Ginga and Victory. However, they were revived by the UPG members, both of the Ultras' human hosts transformed and fought Five King in round two. Victory distracted the chimera monster with his Victorium Slash so Ginga could get close to destroy his Victorium crystals with his Ginga Spark Lance, reducing Five King's power. Victory uses the same plan while Ginga Strium injured Five King. As the monster tried to escape, both of them attacked its wings, leaving unable Exceller to retreat. Ginga then put an end to Five King by using Ultraman Taro's Strium Beam, causing the monster to explode. With the battle over, the Ultras flew toward the morning sunrise. Activate! Magnewave Strategy Fight to the Death of the Morning Glow\n\nExceller successfully revived Dark Lugiel, combining it with the UPG Live Base (mainly for their Victorium Cannon) and turning it into Vict Lugiel. Both Hikaru and Sho transform into Ginga Strium and Victory. They planned an attack by striking his Victorium cannon and swapped each other per battle but failed. Later, One Zero faked her betrayal by setting up the Earth core to release Victorium energies but by the time she revealed her betrayal, Exceller banished her and the Ultra Hosts Hikaru and Sho from Vict Lugiel with the two Ultra hosts transformed and prepares to battle. Before another beam from Victorium Cannon could be fired, One Zero removed Shepherdon's Spark Doll and quickly return it to Sho/Victory, who quickly Ultlance it into Shepherdon Saber to destroy Victorium Cannon. Exceller quickly met his demise at the hands of Lugiel when he reveals himself, with Exceller returned to his Spark Doll state.\n\nLugiel regains control over his body and restarts his plan to froze all lifeforms on Earth in order to create an ultimate paradise. He easily defeated the two Ultras and turn them into stone statues. With the surviving humans regains their spirit and the Victorians gave Hikaru and Sho their necklace, they managed to revive the two Ultras and resume fighting Vict Lugiel. One Zero (whom still inside Vict Lugiel) hack and weakened Vict Lugiel. Victory used his Sadola Scissors to slam the monster's chest, followed by a combo electric attack from his Eleking Tail and Ginga's Ginga Thunderbolt. One Zero fully weaken the monster and the duo Ultras finish Vict Lugiel with the Cosmo Miracle Especially and Victorium Especially at the cost of the android's life. The Adventure Called Life The Fight for Tomorrow\n\nUltraman Ginga S The Movie: Showdown! The 10 Ultra Warriors![]\n\nWhen Etelgar approached the UPG base, Victory quickly rushed over to hold him off. He was soon joined by Ultraman Ginga but even with their combined effort they barely proved to be a challenge for the interdimensional threat. The two Ultras later fused to form Ultraman Gingavictory and defeat Etelgar and his Eteldummies along with the past 8 Ultra Heroes. Ultraman Ginga S The Movie: Showdown! The 10 Ultra Warriors!\n\nUltra Fight Victory[]\n\nLater, Sho and Sakuya had joined UPG. At some point, the two were attacked by the Terrible-Monster Aribunta, who was attempting to steal the Victorium Stone. Sho transformed into Victory to fight the Terrible-Monster. Unknown to him, it was all a plan made by Yapool to collect every piece of his abilities and combat skills. While fighting the Terrible-Monster with the Sadora Scissors, Sakuya was attacked by Yapool who stole her Victorium Necklace. Victory protected her from Aribunta's flames at great cost to himself, but was saved by the arrival of Ultraman Hikari. After Hikari explained himself, he recharged Victory, granting him a special Ultraman Hikari Spark Doll, the allowed him to summon the Knight Timbre. Victory transformed into Victory Knight and attacked the Terrible-Monster with several slashes Knight Victorium Flash.\n\nAfterwards, while helping the tired Hikari, Victory/Sho and his siblings were told by Hikari, of his mission from Ultraman King, and Yapool's plans. With Hikari tired, the task now fell to Victory to stop the Space Emperor's revival.\n\nVictory made his way across space to Satellite Golgotha (the asteroid like moon of Planet Gua) in time to assist Ultraman Ace in his battle against Ace Killer who had been upgraded with his Ultlance abilities to become Victory Killer. With Ace worn from battle, Victory transformed into his Knight form and proceeded to attack the Terrible-Monster, but when Lunaticks appeared to kill Ginga, Shepherdon's Spark Doll shined, whereby Victory used his Knight Timbre to bring it back to life, having remembered the words of Hikari. While Shepherdon fought Lunaticks, Victory weakened Victory Killer and then both of them finished off both Terrible-Monster with their signature beams. Ginga and Ace were then healed thanks to Shepherdon, and they then went to Planet Gua to assist Leo and Astra who were fighting Vakishim, Doragory and Verokron.\n\nGiant Yapool joined his Terrible-Monster, with Leo fighting Vakhishim, Astra fighting Doragory, Ace fighting his sworn enemy Verokron and Ginga and Victory fighting Yapool. Under Ace's advise, Ginga and Victory merged into Gingavictory and killed Yapool but it did not end as expected. Yapool's lingering darkness, flew up into the distortion and and Juda was successfully revived. His first act was to summon Super Grand King Spectre to fight the Ultramen. After being overpowered and separated by Super Grand King Spectre, Ace, Leo and Astra told Victory to fight Juda Spectre while they distracted the Kaiju. Victory uses the Knight Timbre to transform into his Knight form and battled Juda Spectre.\n\nEven with his new power, Victory could not match up to Juda's swordsmanship, however, he refused to give up and eventually, he UITrans Shepherdon's Spark Doll to summon the Shepherdon Saber. He also changed the polarity of the dimension by connecting to the Victorium Energy within it, weakening Super Grand King Spectre and Juda long enough for Victory and the other Ultras to destroy them once and for all.\n\nAfter that, Victory used the Knight Timbre to return the Victorium Core's energies back to Earth, where he returned with Ginga. He tried to return the Knight Timbre to Hikari, but he suggested that he keep it to ensure the future of the planet. Ultra Fight Victory\n\nUltraman X[]\n\nIn Shizukugaoka from his world, Ultraman Victory fights Juda's brother, Mold Spectre, who wants to avenge his brother's death. But then, the black giant kidnaps Victory and Arisa (by accident) and enters the Ultra Flare Universe where his sister, Gina Spectre called from.\n\nAfter escaping from his imprisonment from the Gua Army and helped trained Ultraman X's host Daichi Oozora, Sho, along with Daichi transformed into Ultraman Victory and X respectfully and battled Mold Spectre and Alien Magma as Xio members and Arisa fight Alien Shaplay and Gina. X and Victory used their strongest forms and the results of their training to turn the tables and Victory killed Magma with his Knight Victorium Flash followed by the Knight Victorium Shoot. Mold tells them that the Gua Army is nearing arrival but instead Ultraman Ginga approached from the space distortion after he destroyed the armada and exploited Mold's space distortion as a ride. Sword of Victory\n\nSoon afterwards, Ginga joined Victory and X in taking down Mold until he, along with Gina and Shaplay, decided to retreat after the odds were too much for them and then the Ultras closed the rift with a combination of Ginga's Ginga Comfort, Victory Knight's Victorious Melody, and Exceed X's Purify Wave. After Ginga and Victory's hosts stopped by to rest and talk about Mold and Gina and talked to Daichi about how they share the same dream with Daichi about coexistence with monsters and to never give up on that dream with Sho talking about Shepherdon.\n\nAfter the Ultra hosts stall Gina Spectre and kill Alien Shaplay with a King Joe charged bullet from the Victory Lancer, they all change into their Ultra forms to deal with the newly combined Gua Spectre and start off the fight with an electric attack combo and lead off with an epic brawl. X then saved Ginga and Victory after they were stuck from a strong dark attack and the two of them then merged into Ultraman Gingavictory while X turned into his Exceed X form to even the odds. While X kept Gua busy, Ultraman Gingavictory used his finishers to destroy Gua's weapons and then used another one, along with X's, to finish off Gua Spectre once and for all after X relinquished the Dark Thunder Energy from the entity's body.\n\nAfter saying their farewells, Victory, along with Ginga and Arisa, went back to their own dimension thanks to Ultraman X's Zero Armor. The Shining Sky, and the Land Beneath It\n\nUltraman X The Movie: Here He Comes! Our Ultraman[]\n\nIn this film, Victory battled a Tsurugi Demaaga in Buenos Aires, Argentina and ended up destroying him with his Victorium Shoot after being empowered by Beta Spark Armor Ultraman X's Cyber Wings. After saying their thanks to Ultraman, Tiga, and X, Victory left Earth with the other Cyber Card Ultramen. Ultraman X The Movie: Here He Comes! Our Ultraman\n\nUltraman Orb The Movie: Let Me Borrow the Power of Bonds![]\n\nAfter mysteriously disappearing from his world along with Ultraman Ginga, Ultraman Zero headed to Hawaii. Where Gai Kurenai, Ultraman Orb, was at that time to inform him on the matter after defeating a newly rebuilt Galactron. It was later revealed the both Ginga and Victory had been converted into jewels for Murnau's collection.\n\nAfter Darebolic was released, Ultraman Orb and Ultraman X arrived to combat the threat. Later on, Ginga and Victory were able to escape the imprisonment via currently unknown means and aided the other Ultras against Darebolic and the newly released Seijin. After a full day of battle, Ginga, Victory, X, and Ultraseven left the scene. Ultraman Orb The Movie: Let Me Borrow the Power of Bonds!\n\nUltraman R/B[]\n\nAn apparition of Victory appears alongside the other New Generation Heroes firing their signature beams when Ruebe is activating the New Generation Barrier to counter an enemy attack. Enshrined by Extremity\n\nUltra Galaxy Fight: New Generation Heroes[]\n\nWhen Ultraman X Darkness and Ultraman Geed Darkness are about to drain Orb's light energy, Victory comes in to protect him. He holds them off just long enough for the both of them to escape and regroup with the other New Generation Heroes at the Land of Light. When everyone was gathered, they had a group talk to discuss what had happened to them. Ultra Dark-Killer uses a projection to inform the New Generation Heroes that Ultraman Zero and Ultrawoman Grigio are being held in the Dark-Killer Zone on Planet Tenebris, and to come and face him if they want to rescue their comrades.\n\nUpon arriving, Ginga and Victory face off against Dark Lugiel and Etelgar respectively, but are unable to defeat them. Remembering the training they received from Zero, they fused into Ultraman Gingavictory and used the Wide Zero Shot to defeat them both.\n\nHowever, Ultraman Tregear revives Ultra Dark-Killer and Ultraman Zero Darkness, the former growing to gigantic size due to his overflowing power. To help Zero defeat his Darkness copy, Geed uses the energy of Ginga, Victory, X and Orb to transform Zero into Zero Beyond. They then transform into their strongest forms to battle Ultra Dark-Killer, with Victory changing into Victory Knight. After the New Generation Heroes assault Dark-Killer, Taro arrives and advises them to lend their power to the Strium Brace. Upon doing so, Ginga performs the New Generation Dynamite and destroys Dark-Killer and the Dark Palace. The New Generation Heroes and Zero regroup, but were confronted by Ultraman Tregear, who admits he was the mastermind behind these events. The New Generation Heroes decide to go after Tregear. Ultra Galaxy Fight: New Generation Heroes\n\nUltraman Taiga[]\n\nThe New Generation Heroes faced off against Tregear near the Land of Light, but were defeated easily. When the Tri-Squad arrived, Ginga and Victory gave Ultraman Fuma their lights as a gift, which manifested in the form of Bracelet-type Ultra Taiga Accessories. Buddy Go!\n\nUltraman Taiga The Movie: New Generation Climax[]\n\nAfter Tregear was defeated by Ultraman Taiga, a part of Grimdo escaped from his body. The New Generation Heroes tracked down Grimdo in space and sealed it away in a crystal, at the cost of their Ultraman powers. In their human forms they descended to Earth to protect Hiroyuki Kudo from the approaching Grimdo. Once Sho regained his powers from the Victory-let, the New Generation Heroes face off against Tregear, the Grimdo-possessed Taro and Tregear's monsters, with Ginga and Victory fighting against Hellberus. After their opponents receive power ups from Grimdo, Ginga and Victory fuse into Ultraman Gingavictory to finish off Hellberus. Initially being trounced by Grimdo after it had absorbed Tregear, the New Generation Heroes fused with Taiga into Ultraman Reiga and defeat Grimdo. The New Generation Heroes give their parting words to the Tri-Squad and Hiroyuki and return to their home worlds. Ultraman Taiga The Movie: New Generation Climax\n\nUltra Galaxy Fight: The Destined Crossroad[]\n\nFollowing Tregear's defeat, the New Generation Heroes were dispatched across the universe to track down the Devil Splinters, the fragmented remains of Ultraman Belial, which could be used for nefarious purposes in the wrong hands. In their hunt for them, Ginga and Victory found themselves on Planet Penol, where an infected Bemstar was. The berserk beast proved tough for the duo before Ultraman Taiga arrived to lend a hand. After battling further, Victory created an opening for the others, with Ginga transforming into Ginga Strium and firing the Strium Beam in conjunction with Taiga Photon-Earth's Aurum Strium to defeat their foe and collect the Devil Splinter it left behind.\n\nThe New Generation Heroes regroup in the Monster Graveyard, where Absolute Tartarus, Alien Bat, Reibatos, Ultrawoman Grigio Darkness and Gina Spectre were attacking Ultrawoman Grigio, Ultraman Zearth, Ultraman Nice and Ultraman Boy to take the Devil Splinter they found there. Ginga and Victory fuse into Gingavictory while Rosso and Blu fuse into Ruebe to fight Tartarus. However, Tartarus uses the gathered Devil Splinters to empower Reibatos, who recreates the Giga Battlenizer, and fuses Gina with the souls of her brothers to create Gua Spectre before he dies of an overdose. Gua Spectre's new perfect form proved to be too powerful, forcing the New Generation Heroes to fuse into Ultraman Reiga, who easily defeats Gua before defusing into his components. Just after the battle, Geed and Taiga are struck by Belial and Tregear who retreat shortly after, stealing the Beliarok from Z in the process.\n\nNow knowing of the Kingdom's location thanks to Astra's efforts, a rescue team was formed with its members being Astra, Xenon, Seven 21, Andro Melos, Hikari and Victory, guided by Sora from the Galaxy Rescue Force using technology and the Max Galaxy's powers to open a gate to the Kingdom. They were later joined by Justice, sent to them on the order of Delacion. The team infiltrated the Kingdom and split up to search for Yullian, agreeing to rendezvous back at the Eldora Tower later, but unfortunately came across some resistance.\n\nWhile searching around, Hikari and Victory paired up but were attacked. Belial fought Victory in a clash between the Beliarok and the Shepherdon Sabre while Tregear battled Hikari wearing the Hero's Armor. Each of them fought rather evenly with their opponents until Astra managed to find and rescue both Yullian and Ultraman Regulos, with Victory and Hikari managing to escape from the duo when the former used his Ultlance to access the EX Red King Knuckle, blowing Belial and Tregear back. The team waited for Astra to arrive, delayed by an attack from Absolute Diavolo. With the Absolutians closing in and their way home shrinking by the second, things seemed grim until Astra arrived with both Yullian and Regulos with him. Despite all their hardships, the team managed to leave the Kingdom and their mission was a success.\n\nAfter the rescue squad managed to escape, they arrived on Planet Blizzard pursued by the Absolutians and their forces, only for them to be met with a large gathering of Ultras. The rescue team escaped with Yullian, leaving Astra and Regulos on the planet to join the other warriors in their battle against the Absolutians.

This event happened sometime prior to the series, so he is presumbly currently deceased from old age.\n\nSho: Ultraman Victory's current host, the prince of an underground race called the Victorians. Sho was sent by his mother to prevent the Victorium Stones from being stolen by Alien Chibull Exceller and his forces, and to get the stones back. To complete this mission, Sho was given the power of Ultraman Victory.\n\nHiyori: Though she never transformed, she was able to use the Victory Lancer as a gun while non-selected Victorians are incapable of, hinting her as another potential user.\n\nTransformation[]\n\nBy turning the Victory Lancer into Lancer Mode, Victory's Spark Doll will appear and Sho will place it on the item's transformation spot, causing the face to appear and a voice to declare \"Ultlive: Ultraman Victory\". Sho's body will then light up and Victory's glowing form is seen flying away, Sho follows as light, merging with his Color Timer and completing the Ultra, from there a normal Rise Scene is shown with crystal and a red background.\n\nForms[]\n\nOther Media[]\n\nUltraman Hit Song History: New Generation Chapter[]\n\nIn this music album, Victory alongside the other New Generation Heroes were sealed by Etelgar. However, Victory was freed from his captive after Ultraman Zero recruited Ultraman Rosso and Ultraman Blu to fight against Etelgar. Ultraman Hit Song History\n\nTrivia[]\n\nVictory has five yellow V Crystals on his body: one on his forehead, two on his arms, and other two on his legs. This is likely referring to the letter \"V\" also stands for the number 5 in Roman.\n\nVictory's battle with Alien Guts Vorst/Gan-Q is a reference to Ultraman Gaia V2's battle with Kijuro Mato/Gan-Q Code No.2. As shown, both Ultras had the same color scheme though reversed and were overpowered by Gan-Q's aides (Eye probes for Gan-Q Code No.2 and Gan-Q Code No.1's clones).\n\nVictory is...:\n\nThe second Ultra Warrior to feature black as the main color of his body, after Tiga Dark.\n\nThe first Ultra to have a V-shaped Color Timer.\n\nThe first Ultra that can wield a Kaiju or Alien's weapon such as the King Joe Launcher. Due to this, he is also considered as the first Ultra to wield firearm-type weapons.\n\nVictory's Ultlance ability was stemmed from the fact that EX Red King's arms were separate parts of the suit and not part of the body.\n\nWhile Ginga is supposedly an Ultra from the future, Victory is an ancient Ultra. Despite this, they both share similar traits, primarily their crystals.\n\nWhereas Ginga fights with patience (considering how he previously used to fight against Lived opponents), Victory is purposely made to be more violent.\n\nUltraman Victory is simultaneously designed with Ultraman Gingavictory during the early planning.\n\nVictory's Color Timer's sound is a modified and high pitched version of Ultraman Tiga's.\n\nOddly enough, unlike Ginga, Victory never spoke beyond grunts. The speaking has been done by Sho, his human host. This may mean that he is the only ultra Spark Doll in Ultraman Ginga S that is not sentient.\n\nHowever, he does appear to be somewhat sentient, as in the fights against Five King and Vict Lugiel, when he was killed by them he cancelled the Ultlive himself in order to protect Sho's life.\n\nSince his power is already associated with the Spark Doll system, Victory does not destroy his enemies, but revert them into Spark Dolls.\n\nVictory could be considered the Ultra Warrior who began the trend of letter-shaped Color Timers, this is because after Ultra Fight Victory came Ultraman X and in that show X has an X-shaped Color Timer and after that in Ultraman Orb, Orb has an O-shaped Color Timer.\n\nIn Ultraman Orb The Movie, Victory was meant to assume his Knight form but was scrapped due to time constraints.\n\nAt the time of Victory's announcement, the Ultra was joked by certain fans for his similarity to the title mecha of Mazinger franchise. Masayuki Gotoh took noticed of this and even acknowledges the joke.[2]\n\nReferences[]"
