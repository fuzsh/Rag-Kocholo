        "text": "In Us (2019), Jordan Peele appropriates and remobilises various visual and narrative aspects of Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining (1980). He reimagines The Shining, which is mainly about whiteness, from an African American perspective. Peele thus forms part of a movement Robin R. Means Coleman describes in Horror Noire: “Reinventing the [horror] genre from the vantage point of Blackness often mean[s] reimagining the classics” for political purposes.⁠1 Us is a remake—most directly of a Twilight Zone episode called “Mirror Image,”2 but it also borrows from several feature films about spooky doubles, haunting, home invasion, and mass uprisings.3 Of these, it was The Shining that most influenced Peele: “I really love The Shining. You ask me any day of the week what’s my favorite horror movie and 2 out of 3 times, I’ll say The Shining.”4 There is an undeniable boldness in repurposing or remaking a cultural icon like The Shining, even by way of reverential homage. Jeremi Szaniawski acknowledges that such postmodern play by directors who come after Kubrick has “an empowering, liberating side–a sense that nothing is sacred … [Kubrick…] belongs to all of us, for better or for worse.”5 Peele is undoubtedly making himself as an auteur by remaking Kubrick, so Peele’s relationship with Kubrick is one of dependence as well as an assertion of his own imprimatur. Peele’s film is, as Us would have it, “tethered” to Kubrick’s film: remodelling it without entirely shedding its support. Us references a Biblical passage: “Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.” (Jeremiah 11:11) There are three things to note about this scriptural citation: inescapability, symmetry, and doubling. These characteristics are evident in Us and Peele’s approach to Kubrick. Peele doubles, refracts, and recasts The Shining, so that Kubrick’s film becomes an inescapable intertext for Us.\n\nThomas Leitch says, “Remakes seek to mediate between the contradictory claims of being just like their originals only better.”6 Peele remakes Kubrick’s film “only better” for Black audiences. This is subversive and has the potential to be liberatory from the point of view of race. In terms of class, Peele also significantly widens the lens of the allegory: from the Overlook hotel as a synecdoche of American class relations in the twentieth century, to the entire urban and ex-urban landscape of the US as a nation. I ask two questions of Us: “Does Peele put his own stamp on the material and make it his own?” And “does it represent a liberatory discourse from a social justice point of view?” The expectation that horror be progressive is possibly unreasonable, but Peele’s work with race and representation in Get Out (Jordan Peele, 2017) and Us suggests that that is on his agenda. Derek Johnson coined the term “social justice reboot.” 7 I borrow and modify it to encompass the “social justice remake.” According to Johnson, the social justice reboot, “articulates the industrial management of change with political struggles to transform exigent inequalities of representation, access and privilege within consumer society.”8 As Johnson says, intrinsic to such reworkings are both promises and threats because “the ultimate stakes are a question of who will hold, gain or lose cultural power.”9 However, there is a limit to how disruptive reboots or remakes can be to the established order:\n\nFilm reboots … allow media industries to deliver change, but in a managed way that need not fully disrupt the status quo. Reboots, in this sense, are conservative in nature, even as they might also be celebrated by activists and other forces who see them as a battleground for reimagining familiar images and narratives to be more inclusive. The social justice reboot, in this sense, reveals how the variations in successive entries in a film series…take shape in response to activist pressures (and resistance to them) – but in ways that allow industry to manage that change without disrupting existing power structures. … When conceived through the film reboot, social justice becomes a commodity to be purchased…. In this way, … social justice … [is delivered] alongside its denial 10\n\nIn many places in Us, Peele successfully remodels The Shining to serve his own vision, liberating him to represent Blackness on screen. However, the film’s effects in terms of more general liberation are equivocal when one considers class and gender. This is partly because of the off-screen intractability of the issues of race and class with which Peele deals and partly because of the tropes of gender he has inherited from the horror genre in general, and The Shining in particular. Of relevance to this discussion is Chuck Tryon’s discussion of racialized recasting in the Rocky/Creed franchise,11 which can be read, as Get Out can, against the Black Lives Matter movement. Claire Perkins’s analysis of the gender-swap remake is also useful. This can be read against the background of popular feminist movements like #Metoo and #Timesup.12 However, one area of social justice that is left conspicuously unrepresented by these scholars is class, with which I will deal.\n\nThis paper contributes to the critical discussion of Peele’s evolution as an important contemporary filmmaker in several ways. Much has been written about Get Out; much less about Us. Much has been written about Peele and race. Less has been written about Peele, class, and gender, as I propose to do. The paper also contributes to the discussion of directors who come, as Jeremi Szaniawski’s book title has it, After Kubrick. In discussing directors who come after Kubrick and emulate his filmmaking, particularly The Shining, Rick Warner formulates something he describes as “Kubrickian dread.” He focuses on the works of Jonathan Glazer. Paul Thomas Anderson, and David Lynch—all white filmmakers. In a footnote, he notes intertextualities between Peele’s Get Out (2017) and Kubrick’s The Shining and A Clockwork Orange (Stanley Kubrick, 1971), 13 but he does not expand on this insight in his text. He does not consider Us (and could not have done so, given the date of publication of the volume in which he writes). My analysis expands on Warner’s parenthetic insight to elaborate on the connections between Kubrick and Peele as horror auteurs, and extend the discussion to encompass what it means to come after Kubrick as an African American filmmaker.\n\nSynopsis\n\nUs begins with a childhood vignette. A little Black girl, Adelaide (Madison Curry), wanders away from her father at the Santa Cruz boardwalk and emerges traumatized from the hall of mirrors. Flashforward to an adult Adelaide (Lupita Nyong’o) and her family of four — Gabe (Winston Duke), Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex) Wilson— going on vacation in their beach house near Santa Cruz. They meet their white friends, the Tylers (Elizabeth Moss, Tim Heidecker), who are ever so slightly better off than the Wilsons and who have twin daughters (Cali Sheldon and Noelle Sheldon). Adelaide is uneasy about returning to the scene of childhood trauma, and as it emerges, her paranoia is entirely justified. There is a violent home invasion by a family of spooky doppelgangers— Red (Lupita Nyong’o), Abraham (Winston Duke), Umbrae (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Pluto (Evan Alex). These are the ‘tethered,’ who are, as Red explains, the Wilsons’ underprivileged counterparts from an underworld network of subterranean tunnels. A battle for survival ensues. The Wilsons run to the Tylers’ house only to discover that the Tylers, too, have their tethered. Unlike the Wilsons, the Tylers’ tethered succeed in killing them. The Tylers’ murders are played for uncomfortable laughs, while Wilsons’ home invasion immediately preceding it is played entirely for horror and suspense. The Wilsons ultimately escape their doubles, although the tethered have arisen en masse and taken over the country. And there is a twist. The child that emerged from the hall of mirrors at the beginning of the drama was not Adelaide but her tethered twin. She has been leading a stolen life ever since, passing as her more privileged double. The final frames of the film show a chain of the tethered, hands joined, stretching across the country as far as the eye can see.\n\nUs and The Shining\n\nLike The Shining, Us is a horror show about a family, but Peele swaps the white Torrances for the Black Wilsons. As in The Shining, horror is represented by uncanny doubles: the murdered Grady girls in The Shining, the tethered in Us. There are many mise-en-scene echoes. The butchered bodies the Tyler daughters are posed exactly like the murdered Grady twins. The network of underground tunnels in which the tethered live recalls the architecture of the Overlook. Ina Diane Archer calls this network “national ‘sunken place,’” alluding to Peele’s previous film Get Out.14 But as Elaine Roth points out, in Get Out, the sunken place “registers as an excavation of Black power for white benefit, whereby Black bodies are subsumed and consumed for white pleasure while ... Black identities are silenced and sidelined.”15 However, Red and her family are, like the Wilsons, Black. What distinguishes them is not race but class. Where the Wilsons have enjoyed relative privilege, their doubles have lived half-lives of compulsion rather than choice. Even their bodies are not their own,16 as is demonstrated when Jason methodically walks Pluto into a fire that kills him. Us is about a relationship of slavery beyond race, but not beyond class.\n\nFigure 1:\n\nFigure 2:\n\nFigure 3:\n\nFigure 4:\n\nFigure 5:\n\nFigure 6.\n\nSeeing double\n\nWatching Us involves rewatching The Shining, but as if seeing double. Seeing and not seeing are at the heart of The Shining and Us. Danny (Danny Lloyd) can see more than he should by virtue of the shining. The first time we are introduced to this capacity, he is standing on a step stool in front of the bathroom mirror, looking at his reflection but talking to Tony, the little boy who lives in his mouth. Danny asks Tony about the Overlook Hotel. Tony, reluctantly, shows him visions of elevators disgorging blood, of twins. The blood engulfs the camera, and the screen goes black. Danny is overwhelmed by these visions and passes out. On waking, he refuses to talk about what he has seen. In the case of the young Adelaide, her first trauma occurs in the mirror maze, which recalls Danny’s mirror and the maze outside the Overlook in The Shining. She enters this structure under a sign that says “Vision Quest: find yourself.” As she goes deeper into the maze, it becomes darker—so dark we can hardly make her out but for her white collar. She becomes frightened and disorientated. She backs up to a mirror. She whistles to reassure herself and tries again, more calmly, to explore the space. There is an answering whistle—not quite an echo. She backs up to another mirror. Although we see a little girl just like her, the reflection does not move with her. As strings reminiscent of The Shining gather to a crescendo on the soundtrack, she turns and faces the back of the reflection’s head—an impossible image. This is, of course, a precursor to her being abducted into Red’s underworld, after which Red swaps places with her, and passes for Adelaide in the world above.\n\nFigure 7:\n\nFigure 8:\n\nFigure 9:\n\nFigure 10:\n\nIn The Shining and Us, Danny and Adelaide are children who see too much, who know too much. They become “uncanny” children who mediate between worlds.17 Danny is often seen as losing his innocence in The Shining, but Danny never was an innocent, thanks to his history of abuse at Jack’s (Jack Nicholson) hands and thanks to the shining. Danny’s knowing extends to his capacity to divine and screen his father Jack’s worst impulses for the extra-diegetic audience. It is through Danny’s consciousness that Jack’s encounter with the hag in the bath in room 237 is filtered, after all. The shining also allows Danny to mediate temporally between past, present and future and between races to commune with Hallorann (Scatman Crothers). Young Adelaide, who becomes Red, first sees her impossible reflection, and then comes to know about the occult underworld of the tethered, of which her parents are oblivious. Where Danny sees all in the mirror, including future violence, Adelaide is confronted with the blind spot her position of class privilege involves. 18 Alison Lansberg describes Peele’s practice as “horror verité,” discussing “certain cinematic conventions of the horror film – a specific set of formal and narrative strategies – [that] are uniquely suited to render everyday, endemic and chronic horror – a horror that many in US society do not, or perhaps more accurately refuse, to see.”19 In the case of the Wilson family at the heart of Us, the horror they do not see is the underprivilege their position of privilege assumes. In remodelling these encounters between children and their mirror images, Us repurposes The Shining’s motifs of seeing to render the unseen horror of US society visible. Danny’s and Adelaide’s visions expose systems of power that govern their parents’ worlds: structured by patriarchal and genocidal violence in The Shining, structured by class in Us, structured by race in both.\n\nAtmosphere\n\nThe climax of the suspense in Us is a pas de deux between the teenager Red and Adelaide (Ashley McCoy), which is intercut with the final confrontation between their adult counterparts. In this sequence, Peele effectively evokes Warner’s “Kubrickian dread,” in that “atmospheric suspense ... thickens insofar as the precise relations between music, character behavior, and environment evade us.”52 On the soundtrack, an atonal choral theme intensifies as Red explains the tethereds’ origins and her role in the uprising: she and Adelaide are both “special.” Teen Red and Adelaide perform their dances—Adelaide’s graceful and Red’s angular and muscular. Drums and strings intensify. The music becomes an orchestral arrangement of the title track, “I got 5 on it,” which features a low, throbbing beat. As the adults’ fight intensifies, the orchestration’s bassline thickens. A crescendo builds to the point where Adelaide finally skewers Red on a poker. Then all extradiegetic sound abruptly ceases, leaving only the diegetic sounds of the struggle. The dying Red whistles a parody of the tune young Adelaide whistled to reassure herself in the hall of mirrors. Adelaide brutally strangles her. A low orchestral hum arises as Adelaide searches for and finds Jason. Uneasy instrumentation injects doubt into the reassurance she seems to offer before it resolves as the family reunites and drives away. In his atmospheric synthesis of performance and music in the pas de deux/duel scene, repurposes Kubrickian motifs, images, and ideas to suit his own vision.\n\nPeele’s filmography\n\nIt is important to understand where Us falls in Peele’s filmography: after Get Out and before Candyman (Nia Da Costa, 2021), on which Peele worked as screenwriter and producer. In Get Out, Peele deals with the “absurdity of the idea of race”53 and demonstrates the problem of imagining liberation. Peele shot two endings. In the original ending, the black protagonist Chris strangles his monstrous white girlfriend, Rose (Allison William), to death. A police cruiser approaches. Chris is incarcerated. Of this ending, Peele said that he wrote it to reveal the “post-racial lie” inaugurated by the Obama presidency. The Black man might escape the white house of horrors, but he couldn’t escape the larger structures of racism in the United States. As Ryan Poll points out, the original ending for Get Out posited that horror for Black audiences extends beyond the cinematic screen. Poll says: “to be Black in America ... is to be trapped within an unending narrative of racialized terror. For African Americans, horror is not a genre, but a structuring paradigm.”54 The Black man can never get out. By the time Peele came to finalise the film, however, Obama was out of office, and he felt people needed a hero. In the theatrical ending, Chris recovers his relents before killing Rose, and Chris’s friend Rod (Lil Red Howery) arrives to rescue him. By contrast with this happy ending, Us does not necessarily offer magical solutions on-screen to issues that so insistently persist off-screen for the extra-diegetic audience, particularly the structuring inequalities of class. Us takes up where the original ending of Get Out left off: with the return of the oppressed, in carceral attire, to take revenge on the free. As discussed, they eventually conquer the US “from sea to shining sea.” The inescapability of race and class inequality insist themselves.\n\nFigure 14:\n\nFigure 15:\n\nFigure 16:\n\nFigure 17:\n\nCandyman, like Us, is a remake of a white director’s work (Candyman, Bernard Rose, 1992), which was itself an adaptation of white author Clive Barker’s “The Forbidden,” a short story about class.55 Da Costa’s Candyman starts by acknowledging its predecessor through a shadow puppet dumb show. Like Peele’s Us, it is reverential in its homage to canonical entries in the horror genre but refracts and repurposes them through a Black lens. Instead of the white female middle-class graduate student, Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen), studying the projects, we have the Black male middle-class artist, Anthony McCoy (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), looking for material for his art, which represents Black oppression. He is explicitly interrogated about the effects of his middle-class aspirations: the gentrification of the project to make way for his comfortable modern apartment block is critiqued. But where Rose’s Candyman was a monster who ended up causing the death of the white protagonist, Da Costa’s Candyman figures the Black Candyman as a saviour. The film ends with a Black woman, Brianna Cartwright (Teyonah Parris) invoking a Black supernatural being to escape a white policeman. This is remaking as literal liberation from racially oppressive forces. Its social justice aspirations are underscored by its marketing via a website entitled the “Social Impact Initiative.” This features panel interviews in which “experts discuss how Candyman goes beyond trauma to celebrate the resiliency and creativity of Black culture.”56 And possibly because Candyman was directed by a woman, it escapes some of the horror genre misogyny of Get Out and Us. Comparing Candyman with Us reveals what is possible if the aspiration is the social justice remake.\n\nAuthor Biography\n\nJoy McEntee SFHEA is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of English, Creative Writing and Film.
