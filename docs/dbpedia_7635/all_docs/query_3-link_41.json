        "text": "There are many complicated terms and phrases used to describe aspects of court cases. We have compiled the glossary below to help you get to grips with some of the lesser-known terms.\n\nWhat is an Arraignment?\n\nAn arraignment is usually the first court date in a criminal case. The judge will read the charges to the defendant, along with their constitutional rights. If they cannot afford a lawyer, the court will appoint one for them at this stage.\n\nThe defendant will enter a plea – usually guilty or not guilty. The judge will then address the bail conditions and any other orders, before setting the next court date.\n\nWhat is Bail?\n\nBail is a sum of money that defendants must pay in order to be released from custody during their trial. Once the trial is over, that sum of money is returned to the defendant if they attended all of the court dates.\n\nIt is a system designed to ensure that the defendant does not flee and observes the court’s rules. The bail amount will depend on the type of crime and the means of the defendant. Bail may not be granted if the defendant is considered to be a flight risk or a danger to others.\n\nWhat is a Commuted Sentence?\n\nA commuted sentence is when the punishment for a criminal conviction is changed. Typically, it might involve a sentence being reduced or the convict being released.\n\nA sentence could be commuted due to good behavior, illness, old age, or if the sentence was considered to be harsh, among other reasons. It is not a pardon – the subject is still guilty. Commutation can be granted by the President (for federal charges) or a state governor (for state charges).\n\nWhat is a Conviction?\n\nIn terms of a trial, a conviction is the judgment of a criminal defendant’s guilt. It is the act of formally declaring that the defendant is guilty.\n\nWhat is Cross-examination?\n\nCross-examination is the process of a witness being questioned by the opposing legal team. During a trial, witnesses will take the stand. Once they have provided their testimony, the opposing legal team has an opportunity to ask them questions, expose inconsistencies, and potentially discredit their testimony.\n\nWhat are Damages?\n\nDamages are monetary awards made by the court to a person harmed by negligence. For example, a court could order a reckless driver to pay a crash victim’s damages. Actual damages and punitive damages are usually only awarded in civil cases, not criminal cases.\n\nWhat is the Defense at a Trial?\n\nThe defense is the term used for the legal team representing the defendant at trial. It can also be used to describe the legal strategy used by the defendant in court.\n\nWhat is a Deposition?\n\nA deposition is a witness statement that is taken and recorded before a trial starts. The person will make a statement under oath, often at an attorney’s office. It allows both sides to establish facts and strategies before the trial begins. The statements can then be used during trial proceedings.\n\nWhat is Discovery in a Trial?\n\nDiscovery is the process of gathering evidence prior to and sometimes during a trial. Specifically, it involves the exchange of evidence between the prosecution and defense teams. The two sides have an obligation to provide non-privileged material, such as witness lists.\n\nWhat is the Court Docket?\n\nThe docket is a record featuring all of the cases that are due to be heard in a specific court. Even if they are delayed or continued, the case will remain on the docket.\n\nWhat is a Grand Jury?\n\nA grand jury is a group of citizens assembled to examine potential criminal conduct and decide whether there is enough evidence to charge an individual and go to trial. Unlike trial juries, a grand jury does not decide if a party is guilty. They only determine if a case should move to trial.\n\nThe grand jury is instructed by prosecutors, and the discussions are held in secret. If the grand jury finds enough evidence, it can issue an indictment. At this point, the individual will be charged with a crime by prosecutors.\n\nWhat is Habeus Corpus?\n\nHabeus Corpus, also known as the Great Writ, is a constitutional right that prevents people from being illegally imprisoned. It has nothing to do with whether the person is guilty or innocent, only that the sentence is unlawful.\n\nHabeus Corpus can be used as a legal remedy to challenge the legality of imprisonment. For example, if a conviction is based on illegally obtained evidence, the prisoner might be released based on Habeus Corpus.\n\nWhat is a Hung Jury?\n\nA hung jury is a jury in a trial that cannot reach a verdict. In most criminal trials, a jury is required to come to a unanimous verdict. The voting margins might be different in some states and in civil trials.\n\nIf the jury cannot come to an agreement, there is no conviction or acquittal. It will usually result in a mistrial. At this point, the prosecution can choose to start a new trial or to drop the charges.\n\nWhat is an Insanity Plea?\n\nAn insanity plea is a type of defense in a criminal case. It means that the defendant admits committing the crime, but their level of responsibility is lessened due to mental illness.\n\nA successful insanity plea might mean that the defendant is confined in a mental health facility, rather than a prison. Sentences in these cases often have an unspecified length, so the person may end up imprisoned for longer.\n\nWhat is Incarceration?\n\nIncarceration is when a person is imprisoned. In terms of a criminal trial, a person would be incarcerated (put in prison) after being convicted and sentenced. They may also be held in custody in a jail while their trial is ongoing.\n\nWhat Does it Mean to be Indicted?\n\nAn indictment is a formal accusation of a crime. It is usually issued by a grand jury after an investigation of the facts of a case. If the grand jury believes there is probable cause to file charges, the person suspected of committing the crime can then be indicted. This usually means that they are charged and will face a trial.\n\nWhat is a Jury?\n\nA jury is selected to decide on the facts of a case during trial. Taking part in jury service is a civic duty. Ordinary citizens are called up to serve, and the prosecution and defense decide who will form a particular jury through a selection process at the start of a trial. A jury usually consists of 12 people, often with two alternates.\n\nWhat is a Mistrial?\n\nA mistrial occurs when the trial process cannot be completed. There are several reasons why this could happen. If the jury cannot make a decision, it will likely lead to a mistrial and a new trial.\n\nA mistrial could also be declared if there is a procedural error or an instance of misconduct that makes it impossible to complete the trial fairly. Mistrials can occur in criminal and civil cases.\n\nWhat is a Motion?\n\nA motion is an application made to the court. It can be made by either the defense or the prosecution, and essentially asks the judge to issue a decision or ruling. Typically, when one side files a motion, the opposing legal team will have the chance to issue a response in writing. The judge can weigh up the arguments before issuing a ruling.\n\nWhat is an Objection in a Trial?\n\nAn objection is raised in a trial when the defense or the prosecution believes that the opposition has violated a rule of procedure. For example, either a defense or prosecution attorney could object if they believe the other side’s question, evidence, witness, or testimony should not be allowed.\n\nThe objecting lawyer will say “objection” and state why they believe it should not be allowed. The judge will say “sustained” or “overruled,” depending on whether they consider the objection to be valid.\n\nWhat is a Plea?\n\nWithin a trial setting, a plea is the defendant’s response to the charges against them. When the charges are read at the beginning of the trial, the defendant will enter a plea. The most common options are guilty, not-guilty, or no contest. A defendant might also enter into a plea bargain.\n\nThis is when the defense and the prosecution negotiate the charges and potential punishment before or during a trial. For example, the defense might agree to plead guilty in exchange for a lighter sentence.\n\nWhat is the Prosecution?\n\nThe prosecution is the case brought against a defendant and is the name given to the legal team presenting the case. The prosecution case is brought by state or federal prosecutors.\n\nWhat Does it Mean to be Sequestered?\n\nWhen a jury is sequestered, it means it is isolated. The jurors are housed together at a hotel and are not allowed to contact anyone outside of the court for the duration of the trial.\n\nIt is a rare action to guard against potential tampering and press coverage biasing the jury. This step is usually reserved for high-profile criminal trials that might be subject to intense media scrutiny.\n\nWhat is a Subpoena?\n\nA subpoena is a court order that requires a person to provide evidence at trial. It is presented as a formal written order that forces the subject to take part in legal proceedings by law.\n\nFor example, you could subpoena a potential witness to compel them to provide documents or evidence for a trial. A subpoena is a legal order. If you ignore it, you could face court punishments."
