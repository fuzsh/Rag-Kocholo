The following essay will outline a series of theories about the meaning embedded within the film, drawing most heavily from Freudian and Jungian thought, but also noting textual allusions, elements of different artistic eras (such as postmodern theories), and formalist observations. We will not move through the film chronologically, but rather focus on different theoretical lenses individually. This film offers its viewer a glimpse into the psychological hell of one family, and in so doing it shows us something deeply uncomfortable about the human collective psyche. It tells a subtextual story about a family trapped in a cycle of recurrent violence, ossified by the forces of emotional inertia and Stockholm-Syndrome-esque attachment, warning us against apathy in the face of evil.\n\nFreudian Theory\n\nFirstly, it’s useful to reconceptualize the plot of The Shining in psychological terms. This story about a family trapped at a remote ski resort with an increasingly insane and murderous father figure works strikingly as a unidimensional narrative. It provides all the familiar thrills, shocks and horrific imagery of an effective horror film. Reading the film on an allegorical or symbolic level opens up the allegory and symbolic representation within the plot and characters to surprisingly deep proportions.\n\nClassic psychoanalytic thinking focused quite heavily on the pathologies born in the cradle of dysfunctional families. Within this context, The Overlook Hotel’s claustrophobic environment represents a dysfunctional household dominated by a dictatorial patriarch who holds sway over a helpless mother and child. Seen in this light, the setting draws us into the insulation and increasingly unhealthy psychological landscape of that family.\n\nThe spirits which dominate The Overlook represent the projections of individual characters’ fears and dysfunctions. Freud specifically postulated this defense mechanism, which was meant to shield a person from psychic harm, as an externalizing process: “Projection is a form of defense in which unwanted feelings are displaced onto another person, where they then appear as a threat from the external world. A common form of projection occurs when an individual, threatened by his own angry feelings, accuses another of harbouring hostile thoughts (The Editors of Encyclopeadia Britannica).” This projection can be seen operative mostly in Jack’s interactions with the ghosts, but to a lesser degree with Wendy’s and Danny’s as well. Jack’s violent tendencies, his rage and cold, calculating thoughts, are too difficult for him to bear, and therefore must project onto their environment in order to shield Jack’s psyche from the full measure of its own pathology.1\n\nThe Shining walks its viewer through the layers of the Torrance family’s dysfunction and delineates their mechanisms of operation. There are decidedly Freudian undertones to Jack’s relationship with his son. He occupies the position of the violent patriarchal figure who features prominently in Freud’s Oedipal theory which suggests that: “The super-ego2 represents the introjection into the psyche of an external authority figure3, especially the father or the parents in general. This thesis is consistent with what Freud theorizes in the context of his discussion of the Oedipus complex and its dissolution”(Gray).\n\nIn accepting the dominant role of his father in the sexual dynamics of the family4, a boy essentially instantiates the voice of conscience into his psyche. This then develops into the superego.\n\nThere are hints early in the film of something gone terribly wrong in the process of the formation of Danny’s superego. There are clearly pathologies driving latent forces at work beneath the surface of the familial psychology. For example, in the beginning of The Shining, Danny Torrance has a seizure while seeing visions of a river of blood at The Overlook (a critical, recurring, visual motif). The doctor who examines Danny afterwards has the following interaction with him:\n\n“Danny: “Tony is a little boy that lives in my mouth.”\n\nDoctor: “If you were to open your mouth could I see Tony?”\n\nDanny: “No.”\n\nDoctor: “Why not?”\n\nDanny: “Because he hides.”\n\nDoctor: “Where does he go?”\n\nDanny: “To my stomach.”\n\nDoctor: “Does Tony ever ask you to do things?”\n\nDanny: “I don’t wanna talk about Tony any more.”” (Ager).\n\nAccording to an analysis of the film done by popular YouTube film critic and analyist Rob Ager, who has written on the film extensively, this scene contains a strong sexual undertone suggesting sexual abuse by Jack perpetrated on his son. Ager also notes, as evidence, the presence of Danny’s stuffed teddy bear in the scene which is very similar to a costume worn by a ghost towards the end of the film who performs felatio on another man, as well as a magazine headline Jack reads while waiting in the lobby which reads: “Incest: Why Parents Sleep With their Children”(Ager).\n\nThese clues taken in aggregate suggest the presence of sexual abuse5. Like much of the carefully crafted thematic elements of The Shining, they appear subtly and at times ambiguously. As the film progresses, however, the abusive elements of Jack’s personality become more and more readily apparent.\n\nIn a truly disturbing fashion, Kubrick invites his audience to share the denial surrounding Jack’s abuse which has so dominated the family’s psychology. For example, the viewer also learns during this interaction with the doctor that Jack once, accidentally, Wendy claims, dislocated Danny’s shoulder in a drunken rage. The typically upbeat Wendy waves this incident away telling the doctor that: “Anyway, something good did come out of it all because he said: ‘Wendy, I’m never gonna touch another drop and if I do you can leave me’, and he didn’t and he hasn’t had any alcohol in, eh, five months’”(Kubrick 00:17:20).\n\nThis language of denial is typical of victims of domestic abuse and is consistent with Freudian theories on denial as a psychological defense mechanism. We see Wendy return to this strategy as a crutch numerous times throughout the course of the film. Notably, after Danny returns, ostensibly, from Room 237 and with marks on his neck, Wendy suspects Jack instantly, and hurls abuse at him. Yet, later on, when Danny tells her that it was an old woman who had strangled him, she puzzlingly accepts this account despite no evidence as of yet to support the proposition that The Overlook contains supernatural elements, and the extremely unlikely possibility of a break-in at a remote ski resort in the off season (Ager).\n\nAt times, Jack treats Wendy with outright hostility, such as when she interrupts his “writing” (which, as we later find out, isn’t really writing at all). She demurely accepts this abuse, though is clearly unnerved by it. We see no evidence that she explicitly acknowledges that such behavior constitutes abuse. Just as Jack’s psyche required protection from its dark hostility, Wendy’s requires a haven from that hostility and finds it in the form of denial. Such expressions of tyrannical control seem to form the basis for much of their relationship. And, while Wendy is undeniably a victim, in these ways, by not fighting back, she becomes complicit in her family’s pathology.6 The symbolic narrative of the film takes a decidedly darker turn at this point.\n\nJungian Theory\n\nDenial and Tyranny In the Soviet Union\n\nHaving come to the topic of denial, we must now return briefly to the original problem of the framework within which we interpret The Shining. At the familial level of analysis7, there are powerful and disturbing themes. For the individuals subjected to this sort of experience, they are self-evidently agonizing and heart-wrenching. But, the hell into which the Torrances are dragged doesn’t serve merely as a warning for families or individuals.\n\nThis behavior can be seen at the national level. Whole nations can be gripped by a tyrannical patriarch, and societies frequently find themselves in thrall to charismatic figures who tap into our darkest instincts.\n\nAs we have discussed, the father figure in psychoanalytic thinking plays an important role in the formation of the superego. Parents (both the mother and father, but with a special emphasis on the father in Freudian thought) serve as a proxy for what society deems acceptable and thereby become a symbol for society’s precepts. The symbolic meaning of the father figure, therefore, is deeply tied to the authoritative power of society and the State.\n\nThis is also partly what Carl Jung was trying to explain in his theories on the collective unconscious:\n\n“The [dictator] State takes the place of God [who is the purest archetypal father figure in our culture8]; that is why, seen from this angle, the socialist dictatorships are religions and State slavery is a form of worship…The policy of the State is exalted to a creed, the leader or party boss becomes a demigod beyond good and evil… There is only one truth and beside it no other. It is sacrosanct and above criticism…Only the party boss, who holds the political power in his hands, can interpret the State doctrine authentically, and he does so just as suits him” (“The Undiscovered”).\n\nOne such example is the violence perpetrated under the Soviet regimes of Lenin and Stalin. Their hold on the national psyche is exemplified in their propaganda:\n\n(Efimov) (Soviet propaganda)\n\nThe posters’ captions translate to: “The captain of the Soviet country guides us from victory to victory” and “The red army organized, fostered, and made the unbeatable party of Stalin and Lenin.” In these striking pictures, which venerate mass murderers, we can see the man raised “above criticism” who so frightened Jung. This is the same terror which was visited on the Torrances. Entire States can become, for a time, an embodiment of the psychological elements of The Overlook Hotel.\n\nEven more disturbing is the faith in the government which was held by those sentenced to the infamous Gulags. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, in his thick volumes on the history of the Soviet legal system: The Gulag Archipelago, describes meeting such people:\n\n“Enlightened Marxists! Theoreticians! And how did they cope with this ordeal?… Dragged roughly for years down a false trail, they offered explanations astonishing in their profundity: …the message was: that we ourselves were to blame for relaxing our vigilance! Stalin doesn’t know anything! Stalin doesn’t know about these arrests!! When he finds out, he will destroy them all and free us!! …no one, of course, accused Stalin — he remained an uneclipsed sun!”(Solzhenitsyn 330–331).\n\nSuch was the fate of those who identified so totally with the father figure in their unconscious that they believed no evil could be perpetrated by him. Gulag is replete with stories of such people, but also those of heroes who refused to participate in the system, whether by refusing to name names (in a real life embodiment of Arthur Miller’s famous line, “I have given you my soul; leave me my name!” (Miller)) or retaining their humanity in the labor camps. Repeatedly, throughout the course of his indictment of the Soviet system, Solzhenitsyn emphasizes and reemphasizes the fact that the entire populace was paralyzed with terror, and thus did not resist. Those who did, in ways large and small, become the heroes of the narrative, and one walks away from Gulag, through the stories of some of their successes (through hunger strikes, refusal to work and actual armed resistance), with a tremendous faith in the power and efficacy of righteous struggle against tyranny. This could be part of the symbolic meaning of Wendy Torrance: a stark warning of the terrors that can result from the individual unwillingness to stand against such tyranny.9\n\nThe Labyrinth and Mythology\n\nThe symbol of the maze which stands in front of The Overlook is important to view in the context of its mythological significance. The following images:\n\n(Tabletopmazecloseup.jpg) (The Shining)\n\nare striking from the metaphorical perspective. Carl Jung wrote about the archetype of the maze in Man and His Symbols:\n\n“The maze of strange passages, chambers, and unlocked exits in the cellar recalls the old Egyptian representation of the underworld, which is a well-known symbol of the unconscious with its unknown possibilities. It also shows how one is “open” to other influences in one’s unconscious shadow side, and how uncanny and alien elements can break in” (Jung).\n\nWith this in mind, this surreal transition, which appears to show Wendy and Danny as tiny figures in the model maze and Jack standing over them, giant in relative size, seems to represent the influence Jack holds over their unconsciouses. For people subjected to domestic abuse, the abuser can indeed grow to such proportions in their psyches. The image also evokes comparisons to a divine or supernatural being, harkening back to Jung’s observation about the status of a tyrant within a given society. However, a less disturbing interpretation could also suggest that the image is indicative of the normal formation of the superego, as outlined above.\n\nThe climax of the film occurs within the maze as well, with Jack chasing Danny while brandishing a fire axe. That is an even more striking representation of this psychological process. As Jack engages Danny in pursuit, he emits a guttural groaning which some have likened (Room 237), along with his physical appearance at different points in the movie, such as:\n\n(Kubrick) (The Shining)\n\nto that of the Greek Minotaur (pictured below. Note the similarity of their facial expressions and the placement of Jack’s eyebrows with the creature’s horns).\n\n(Minotaur.jpg)\n\nDanny’s method of escape from the labyrinth (i.e. retracing his steps in order to confuse Jack) also alludes to that of Theseus in the legend (Room 237).10 In addition, the Minotaur appears in Dante’s Inferno as a guardian of the river of blood that constitutes the seventh circle of Hell, which is reserved for those who commit violence against their fellow man. This suggests that Danny’s visions of the river of blood partly foreshadow Hallorann’s later death.11(Darkmatters) (“Dante: The Divine Comedy”).\n\nDante’s Inferno, Hell and the Devil With Three Faces\n\nAlong with the tangentially applicable myth of the Minotaur and its connection to the classic epic Inferno is a more substantial and powerful allusion which occurs towards the end of The Shining. After Danny escapes the maze (both physically and psychologically freeing himself from Jack’s persecution) the viewer is shown an image (below, on the left) of Jack frozen to death, ostensibly some significant length of time afterwards.\n\nThis image bears a striking resemblance to the top level of the ninth circle of Dante’s Hell. In this circle, people who have betrayed members of their own family are frozen\n\n(The-Shining_0.jpg) (Interior_Dante_Divinecomedy_Ing_32_301.jpg)\n\nup to their necks in a lake of ice. They are allowed freedom of movement only from the neck upwards (“Dante: The Divine Comedy”). The camera angle in this shot is notably cut at about the midpoint of Jack’s chest, paralleling the Inferno’s damned sinners as does Nicholson’s inhuman grimace. Considering the subtextual abuse outlined previously, and the explicit violence Jack perpetrates against his family, that is precisely the part of Dante’s Hell in which he would end up.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, “hell” could represent that place a family occupies when it becomes a tyranny. There is not necessarily any judgement associated with the term, as the Judeo-Christian tradition would assert. But, consider what The Overlook as a place of punishment might mean. Jack and Wendy, in some sense, are both complicit in the family’s collapse. We’ve already seen how Wendy’s denial contributed to it. Abuse does not appear out of a vacuum, and is often intensified in stages. This does not mean that Wendy is to blame for her own abuse: victim-blaming is hardly ever a useful enterprise (see footnote 6). But, it does demonstrate, chillingly, what extreme obedience can lead to.\n\nIt is interesting to note how the Devil is portrayed in Inferno:\n\n(Dante’s three)\n\nHere, Satan is imagined as a winged beast with three faces, eternally chewing on Brutus, Cassius and Judas, considered the three worst traitors in human history.12 It is also noteworthy that Satan himself is frozen, and suffers as well. Perhaps Dante wanted us to consider the possibility that even the Prince of Darkness fares badly in the hell which he created. People who devote themselves to evil (such as Jack) may find the allure of unshackling themselves from morality irresistible, but will quickly find themselves suffering as well.\n\nBut it is the Devil’s three faces which are primarily relevant to this section. Jack’s descent into madness appears at first glance to be a characterological change, i.e. a dramatic shift in personality which creates an entirely different man from the one we saw in the beginning (unnerving and unpleasant as he was to begin with). But, from a psychological standpoint, it seems as if we’re really seeing different elements of the same psyche. Jack isn’t changing he’s revealing aspects of himself which were previously hidden.\n\nThroughout the course of The Shining we see three levels of Jack’s psyche, mirroring Dante’s three-faced devil. From the Jungian perspective, these appear to be: his persona, the process of his possession by his shadow, and, finally, his shadow in its purest form.\n\nThe persona was defined by Jung as: “a complicated system of relations between the individual consciousness and society. It is a relatively suitable kind of mask which, on the one hand, is calculated to make a definite impression upon others, while, on the other,\n\nit cloaks the true nature of the individual. That the latter function is superfluous could be maintained only by the man who is so identified with his persona that he no longer knows\n\nhimself ; while the former could be regarded as unnecessary only by the man who is almost wholly unconscious of the real nature of his fellowmen. Society expects, and indeed must\n\nexpect, that every individual should play the role assigned to him as completely as possible” (Jung 207).\n\nJack’s persona is most evident in his job interview with Ullman. In that interaction, Jack portrays himself as a mild-mannered family man, even appearing relatively unfazed when he learns of The Overlook’s gruesome past13:\n\n“JACK: Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman, that’s not going to happen with me, and eh as far as my wife is concerned, I am sure she’ll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it. She’s a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict” (Kubrick, Johnson). Jack is the quintessential family man during this interview, going so far as to suggest that isolation with his family for this length of time won’t be an issue. He’s quiet, reserved and eminently polite. He is, in essence, playing the part for the benefit of Ullman. In this scene, Ullman is a stand-in for society at large and the public face Jack presents here is indicative of the persona Jack presents to the world.\n\nAs Jung notes, the persona is necessary in its function of mediating the interactions between a person and society, but in the case of individuals with unpleasant or pathological personalities it can also serve as a sort of camouflage, concealing their true nature. This is especially the case in abusive families in which the stakes for revealing that nature are so high.\n\nJack’s “second face” comes in the form of his encounter with his Jungian shadow. The shadow was described by Jung in Man and His Symbols:\n\n“Sometimes, though not often, an individual feels impelled to live out the worse side of his nature and to repress his better side. In such cases the shadow appears as a positive figure in his dreams. But to a person who lives out his natural emotions and feelings, the shadow may appear as a cold and negative intellectual; it then personifies poisonous judgments and negative thoughts that have been held back. So, whatever form it takes, the function of the shadow is to represent the opposite side of the ego and to embody just those qualities that one dislikes most in other people” (Jung 173).\n\nThe shadow contains all of the elements of the personality14 which aren’t consciously recognized. As Jung points out, the shadow is not universally negative. People often repress positive aspects of their personality. But, it is the “cold and negative intellectual” (Jung 173) character of the shadow which is interesting to consider with regards to The Shining. Two of the spirits Jack encounters at The Overlook, Lloyd, the bartender, and Delbert Grady, the waiter with whom he speaks in the bathroom, seem to be projections of Jack’s shadow.15\n\nLloyd’s interactions with Jack16 are characteristically detached. Lloyd isn’t overtly rude and, in fact, encourages him from time to time. But, Lloyd demonstrates almost no emotion whatsoever even in the face of fairly disturbing commentary. For example, he glibly replies to Jack’s complaints about “the old sperm-bank upstairs” (Wendy), with the cliche line: “Women, can’t live with ’em, can’t live without ‘em” (Kubrick, Johnson). As Jack continues to complain about how Wendy won’t allow him to forget the time he dislocated Danny’s arm, Lloyd remains relatively unfazed.\n\nJack is also strikingly dissimilar to the persona he was projecting to Ullman earlier in the film. We’re beginning to see the opposite of that aspect of his psyche — the violent, misogynistic drunk who stands in opposition to the family man he projects to the world. Precisely because Jack wants to be seen as that sort of person, and because of his efforts at reform after hurting Danny, his shadow embodies the opposite qualities. In these ways, this scene appears to be a symbolic representation of Jack’s alcoholism, and the encounter it forced him to have with his own shadow.\n\nLloyd has captured the attention of Shining analysts mostly for another reason, though. A few lines of strange dialogue between them seem to parallel another classic work of fiction: Faust.17 When Jack arrives at the empty bar, he says, to himself: “JACK: God, I’d give anything for a drink… My goddamn soul, just a glass of beer” and then Lloyd appears in front of him, tending the bar. Later on, he says: “ JACK: Say, Lloyd, it seems I’m temporarily light… How’s my credit in this joint anyway? LLOYD Your credit’s fine, Mr. Torrance” (Kubrick, Johnson). And then, a few scenes later, Jack is back in the bar and has this interaction with Lloyd: “LLOYD: No charge to you, Mr. Torrance. JACK: No charge? LLOYD: Your money’s no good here. Orders from the house” (Kubrick, Johnson).\n\nThis dialogue seems to suggest that Jack sells his soul to Lloyd for alcohol in lieu of monetary payment. Even more ominous is Lloyd’s strange assertion that the reason has to do with “orders from the house,” suggesting, in this context, the involvement of The Devil/Mephistopheles (Shmoop Editorial Team). It is also interesting to note the double meaning of “spirits” in the scene, with the alcohol being one and Lloyd’s ghostly personage being another. Jack having sold his soul to the spirits could refer psychologically to the sort of mental slavery alcoholism has imposed on him.18\n\nThe Faustian theme is paralleled in a subplot of the book on which The Shining is based, which is discussed in Shmoop’s analysis: “The martinis and other alcoholic beverages that magically appear at the Overlook [or, in our case, which are given by Lloyd] might also have some roots in Goethe’s Faust. In a rather early passage, Mephistopheles demonstrates his ability to create alcohol… One reason Jack doesn’t want to leave the Overlook is because it’s feeding him forbidden knowledge, which is kind of every artist’s dream. If Jack can write a book about the Overlook’s hidden secrets, he can be a successful novelist. Unlike Dr. Faustus, Jack doesn’t consciously trade his soul, because he doesn’t even know the devil is a part of it” (Shmoop Editorial Team). [See “Postmodern Theory” for more on the relationship between the book and movie and Jack’s repetitive writing.]\n\nThe other part of Jack’s shadow is embodied in Delbert Grady19 with whom Jack converses directly after Lloyd. The dialogue which occurs between them in the bathroom is some of the most deliberately ambiguous and symbolically rich of the entire film, surpassed only, perhaps, by the Room 237 scene.\n\nGrady speaks to Jack in the same cold tone that Lloyd did. With stereotypically British indifference, he describes his murder of his own family, saying: “My girls, sir, they didn’t care for the Overlook at first. One of them actually stole a packet of matches and tried to burn it down. But I corrected them, sir. And when my wife tried to prevent me from doing my duty I corrected her” (Kubrick, Johnson). The same “cold and negative intellectual” (Jung 173) voice that is characteristic of the Jungian shadow is very much at play here. Again, we see the polar opposite of Jack’s persona. Where Jack in his interview was warm, Grady is cold, where Jack was devoted to his family, Grady is overtly hostile to his and obsessed with duty (an obsession that Jack will later manifest in the staircase scene).\n\nGrady’s superficially perplexing line: “You’ve always been the caretaker,” (Kubrick, Johnson) is positively chilling from the symbolic perspective. If we consider Jack to be representative of the pathological forces which drive a family to abuse, his status as eternal caretaker of The Overlook (which, as we’ve discussed, is a representation of hell and the insulation of the abusive family) suggests that the possibility of violence in families which have been abusive in the past may be latent, but is always present and threatening to recur.\n\nThat is the meaning of the picture which is shown in The Shining’s final shot:\n\n(The-Photograph-At-The-End-Of-Stanley-Kubricks-The-Shining-Explained-By-Screenwriter-Social.jpg)\n\nThis image indicating that Jack was present at The Overlook in the 20s20 is included because we are supposed to conclude the possibility of the film’s psychological horrors to be perpetrated again and again. This parallels, as well, the Stockholm Syndrome-like behavior of many battered women who become psychologically attached to their abuser and return to him repeatedly.\n\nThen, as Jack enters the final stage of his madness and becomes overtly homicidal, we see him totally possessed by his shadow. Gone entirely is the mask he presents to society. He has surrendered absolutely to the influences of Lloyd and Grady.21\n\nThe scene on the staircase, in which Jack chases Wendy up the stairs with a baseball bat, is the first in which we see Jack’s untempered shadow. Embodying Grady and Lloyd’s coldness, his mocking tone and eerie calm provide a disturbing contrast to his actions. Jack’s sanity has totally left him as he descends into the darkest parts of his own psyche, embracing all of the violent tendencies he had repressed. He manifests Grady’s strange sense of loyalty to his work asking Wendy:\n\n“Has it ever occurred to you that I have agreed to look after the Overlook Hotel until May the first? Does it matter to you at all that the owners have placed their complete confidence and trust in me, and that I have signed a letter of agreement, a contract, in which I have accepted that responsibility? Do you have the slightest idea what a moral and ethical principle is? Do you?” (Kubrick, Johnson).\n\nAt the same time, he mocks Wendy’s suggestion that Danny be taken to a doctor. In short, he totally abandons any personal connection he once had with his family, and with a cold, ironic tone (again characteristic of the shadow) tells Wendy that he’s “Not going to hurt ya… I’m just gonna bash your brains in. Bash them right the fuck in!”(Kubrick, Johnson). The Jack in this scene is not, as we’ve discussed, characterologically different from the man we see at the beginning of the film. This violence and cruelty is an inherent aspect of his psyche, always lurking and threatening to reemerge, manifesting in further abuse. Abusive men can often be pushed into violence at seemingly miniscule provocation.\n\nThe music that accompanies this scene is also relevant, and will be discussed in the formalist section.\n\nRoom 237\n\nThere is one more scene of special note with regards to this psychological, and specifically Jungian, analysis of The Shining: the Room 237 scene. The events which occur in Room 237 appear relatively straightforward, even though they leave the viewer with the distinct sense that he does not truly understand what is going on. Jack, having been told by Wendy that Danny was strangled by an old woman, goes to investigate despite calling Wendy “out of [her] fucking mind”(Kubrick, Johnson). Once there, he discovers a beautiful woman stepping out of the shower in the bathroom, with whom he begins to kiss passionately. She morphs into an elderly woman — a rotting corpse — and chases him from the room.\n\nThere are two main psychological significances to this series of events. The first is related to another Jungian concept: the anima. Jung thought of the anima as an archetype within the male psyche, containing a man’s feminine characteristics. She appears as an actual woman, in dreams for example, but is also a force within his mind. The anima was considered responsible for creativity, warmth and many important aspects of that psyche (Jung 71). Jung’s description of what the loss of the anima entails sheds tremendous light on this scene:\n\n“Younger people … can bear even the total loss of the anima without injury. The important thing at this stage is for a man to be a man. … After the middle of life, however, permanent loss of the anima means a diminution of vitality, of flexibility, and of human kindness. The result, as a rule, is premature rigidity, crustiness, stereotypy, fanatical one-sidedness, obstinacy, pedantry, or else resignation, weariness, sloppiness, irresponsibility, and finally a childish ramollissement [petulance] with a tendency to alcohol.”(Jung 71)\n\nWe see Jack embodying all of these qualities throughout The Shining. That is what is so significant about the image of the beautiful woman transforming into the rotted corpse. She represents the corruption of Jack’s anima, and its eventual destruction. It is also noteworthy that the anima tends to embody the opposite nature of the persona (Luton). Because Jack’s persona is so emphatically kind and family-oriented, his anima has become cold, disturbed, and finally destroyed.22\n\nWhat is astounding about this observation is how much of the film’s plot and Jack’s individual character it explains. Jack’s alcoholism, his abusive behavior towards Wendy, the public face he displays to Ullman, even his repetitive writing (“All work and no play make Jack a dull boy”) can be understood through the lens of the corruption of his anima.\n\nA second possible interpretation is that Room 237 represents the deepest subjective fears of each person who encounters it (similarly to the infamous Room 101 in Orwell’s 1984) (Orwell 357). Danny is the first to encounter the room, and when Wendy sees the marks on his neck, ostensibly from the old woman, she immediately suspects Jack to be the perpetrator. This indicates Wendy’s subconscious, and, perhaps, even unconscious, fear that Jack’s character is indeed as abusive as he has demonstrated in the past.\n\nThe beautiful woman that Jack encounters in the room could also represent his psychological perceptions of Wendy, and her decay into the rotted corpse the dissolution of their marriage. Danny’s psychic sense of the events occuring in Room 237 could represent his unconscious realization of that process and his fear that his own family will soon collapse.23\n\nFormalist Theory\n\nThe titles of the pieces which comprise the film’s score seem to have a strong connection with the underlying symbolic narrative. During the scene on the staircase, for example, as Jack chases Wendy up the stairs, the piece Polymorphia plays. The literal translation of polymorphia is “one meaning in many forms”(Polymorphia). This is surprisingly applicable to the theories presented earlier about Dante’s three-faced devil. This could be an allusion to Jack’s character embodying different elements of his own psyche across the course of the film.\n\nThe name of the piece which accompanies the recurring image of the elevator and the river of blood24, as well as the piece that plays as Jack wakes from his nightmare about murdering Wendy and Danny, is commonly translated as “The Awakening of Jacob,” but its original German title is the bible verse “Jacob woke from his sleep and said: Truly the Lord is in this place, and I did not know it”(“The Dream of Jacob”). The full verse reads: “Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, ‘Surely the LORD is present in this place, and I did not know it!’ Shaken, he said, ‘How awesome is this place! This is none other than the abode of God, and that is the gateway to heaven’” (Genesis 28:16–17). But, this line is commonly mistranslated from the original Hebrew which uses the word: “וַיִּירָא֙” meaning “terror” or “panic” So, the second sentence is better translated as “Panicked, he said, ‘How terrifying is this place!”\n\nThe dread attached to this scene, therefore, is connected with Jack and his future violence, with the music becoming a leitmotif representing the intensifying of Jack’s violent impulses. The reference to God, as well as demonstrating the fear that grips Jack as he wakes from his nightmare, is a direct allusion to Jack himself. As we’ve already discussed, Jack occupies a quasi-deified place in Danny’s and Wendy’s psyches. Appropriately, this biblical verse emphasizes the frightening and overwhelming aspects of God. At the same time, the piece indicates that Jack’s shadow is “waking up.”\n\nIn the final scenes of the film, another Penderecki piece titled Ewlangia plays. It is part of a larger work called Utrenja, which has two sections, with Ewlangia being the first movement of the second section titled Zmartwychwstanie Pańskie (English:The Resurrection of Christ) (“Utrenja”). This is related to the symbolic explanation of the significance of “The Picture.” At the end of the film Jack Torrance is a pure manifestation of his shadow and his own worst, violent impulses, and becomes a symbol of the abuse which recurs in the Torrance family; when he becomes overtly homicidal, we are witnessing the “resurrection,” so to speak, of that aspect of his psyche. This allusion to the resurrection of Jesus, an unambiguously positive event in the Christian canon, takes on an ironic meaning in this light.\n\nOne of the elements of The Shining’s ambiguity is related to the inclusion of mirrors: “Much of The Shining is presented from Jack’s point-of-view, and it becomes apparent that Kubrick wants us to become mired in the maelstrom of his disintegrating sanity. It has been pointed out that there’s a mirror in every scene in which Jack sees a ghost, causing us to wonder whether the spirits are reflections of a tortured psyche”(Beradinelli). The color red also seems to appear in all of these scenes, which could subtly connect the ghosts and the river of blood, which, again, is strongly tied into Jack’s increasing manifestation of violence. The fact that the ghosts could, in a sense, be a “projection” into which Jack is speaking, is perfectly understandable within the context of the Freudian theories outlined previously.\n\nThe film’s transitions are a major aspect of its emotional atmosphere. Often, scenes are cut short without warning, or the camera angle changes suddenly, establishing an atmosphere of uncertainty which keeps the viewer off balance. In the scene in which Jack comforts Danny, assuring him “I’d never do anything to hurt’cha”(Kubrick, Johnson), the transition is done in such a way as to cut the conversation off, seemingly prematurely, to leave its impact “hanging in the air” for the viewer. This gives the impression of a question not quite answered, and the unsettling sense that something deeply sinister has just occured. The strongest and most blatant example of this technique occurs in the scene in which Danny sees the Grady girls beckoning him to “come play”(Kubrick, Johnson) with them25, and is shown rapidly oscillating images of their murdered corpses.\n\nFinally, the question of the mechanisms of “creepiness” seems apropos at this point. Especially with regards to the Grady girls, the issue of the exact nature and origin of the emotional response to this scene and the film in general is important to consider. Our emotional reactions are often so deeply ingrained that questioning them at any level seems absurd. These images are disturbing and “creepy” for self-evident reasons, we might feel. But, beyond the visceral reaction we feel at seeing blood and overt violence, it is worth asking why we have such a disquieted sensation upon seeing scenes with content such as the Grady girls, even before the violence is displayed, standing at the end of the hallway, speaking in uniformity. Why, also, do we get such an unsettled feeling upon observing Jack’s not-quite-normal interactions with his family?\n\nThe scientific literature on the subjective sensation of creepiness is rather sparse, but at least one serious study into the phenomenon has yielded interesting results:\n\n“The results are consistent with the hypothesis that being ‘creeped out’ is an evolved adaptive emotional response to ambiguity about the presence of threat that enables us to maintain vigilance during times of uncertainty.\n\nBut what exactly is it that our creepiness detector is warning us about? It cannot just be a clear warning of physical or social harm. A mugger who points a gun in your face and demands money is certainly threatening and terrifying, and a rival who threatens to destroy your reputation by revealing secret information about you fills you with dread. Yet, most people would probably not use the word ‘creepy’ to describe these situations. It is our belief that creepiness is anxiety aroused by the ambiguity of whether there is something to fear or not and/or by the ambiguity of the precise nature of the threat (e.g.,sexual, physical violence, contamination, etc) that might be present. Such uncertainty results in a paralysis as to how one should respond. In the mugging and reputation-savaging situations, there is no ambiguity about the presence or nature of threat. It may be that it is only when we are confronted with uncertainty about threat that we get ‘creeped out,’ which could be adaptive if it facilitates our ability to maintain vigilance during periods of uncertainty”(McAndrew and Koehnke 2).\n\nThis seems to be consistent with the emotional reactions which accompany watching The Shining. The filmmakers have gone to great pains to craft scenes, dialogue and an atmosphere that is just on the edge of frightening. They’re attempting to hit the infamous “uncanny valley” and leave us unsure of exactly how to respond. Of course, there are elements of the film that are unambiguously frightening.\n\nPostmodern Theory\n\nInterestingly, Kubrick’s version of Jack Torrance produces nothing but repetitive nonsense in his writing, whereas in the Stephen King book, Jack is largely successful in his efforts. This was one of the many significant departures from the source material Kubrick built into the film. While he was widely criticised for this, at least one Shining interpreter has suggested26 that his changes weren’t simply due to laziness or some sort of artistic pedantry, but an explicit reversal of almost every aspect of the book. Examples include changing Wendy’s hair color from blonde to brunette, and her personality from strong to weak. The color of the tractor is changed from yellow to red, Danny’s imaginary friend is external in the book and completely internal in the movie. The list continues. The validity of this theory on an explicit inversion of the source material is questionable, but it is certainly plausible given the attention to detail and incredible fastidiousness of Kubrick’s work on this and all his films.\n\nThis idea of inversion, however, does seem to play a critical role in the emotional resonance of The Shining. Inversion and “overturning” the relationship between two opposite concepts is a central element of the postmodern method of analysis known as Deconstruction: “A deconstructive analysis exposes figures and oppositions that privilege particular positions and meanings. For example, deconstruction notes how binary oppositions (nature/culture, literal/figurative, male/female, self/other) demonstrate a particular logic or philosophy of meaning …Once the hierarchy is questioned and even reversed, the opposition may be displaced into a different context to challenge the function of the opposition itself”(Stephan).\n\nMany concepts are juxtaposed against their opposites in The Shining. For example: hospitality vs violence [with regards to The Overlook itself, as a hotel which is a place where hospitality would be expected], family and love vs cruelty and hatred, “redrum” as a literal inversion of “murder,” work vs futility, conscious vs unconscious, etc.\n\nThe Overlook appears to be a place of inversion, an environment in which all of the normal expectations of human interaction break down. The primary purpose of this effect is to highlight to the viewer that he is seeing the aspects of the family’s collective psyche that are normally hidden. We have gone “through the looking glass,” so to speak (which is likely the symbolic significance of the “redrum” mirror scene, which occurs before all hell breaks loose in The Overlook, literally and metaphorically).\n\nWe will conclude the body of this paper with the topic of point of view. Postmodern theories, and postmodern thought in general, are largely hostile to the notion of objective truth. Subjectivity and individuals’ interpretations of the world’s multifaceted complexity are given a high status in the postmodern worldview. This is reflected, for example, in the common injunction to give precedence to people’s “lived experiences” and not pass objective judgement on them.\n\nThe Shining embodies this hostility in its cinematography27 and overall treatment of point of view. There are shots, for example, from the perspective of Danny and Danny alone, like when he first encounters Room 237. As discussed above, Jack’s conversations with ghosts are often mediated by mirrors, calling into doubt the objectivity of the whole scene. Because of Jack’s obvious instability, as well as Danny’s and Wendy’s, there is no way of knowing for certain if any of the character’s interpretations of reality are in fact accurate. The Grady girls, who are seen by Danny, the woman in Room 237, Grady in the bathroom, all of these are seen only by one character at a time, though both Danny and Jack hypothetically see the woman in Room 237 individually. Thus, as many analysts have noted previously, The Shining lacks essentially any degree of objectivity and represents the individual truths of three unreliable individuals. Perhaps that distance between them and their inability to agree on a shared truth is another dimension to their collective pathology.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis essay has enumerated a number of theories regarding the meaning embedded within The Shining, making use of Freudian, Jungian, Formalist and Postmodern theories. It has further included noted allusions to works such as Dante’s Inferno, Orwell’s 1984, the Bible, Faust and Greek mythology. The plot has been reconceptualized in psychological terms, for the purposes of the psychoanalytic and analytical analyses, as an extended allegory for familial abuse and the pathologies that led to its formation. By examining the influences of denial, projection, and the increasing embodiment of the Jungian shadow, we have seen how The Shining demonstrates how a family can collapse, and how abuse can recur within the familial and domestic contexts.\n\nBy noting several allusions to Dante’s Inferno, we established a threefold psychological model of Jack’s character arc throughout The Shining, mirroring Dante’s three faced Devil. This included an examination of his persona, his encounter with his own shadow, and finally his shadow in its purest form. Alongside, and complementary to this, was the corruption and destruction of Jack’s anima, represented in imagistic metaphor by the scene in Room 237, which also represented the subjective fears of each of the Torrances.\n\nWe discussed the symbol of the maze and what it means in the context of the Torrances’ psyches. Jack’s influence on Danny’s and Wendy’s psyches was examined in this light. By noting the allusions to Inferno and Faust we considered the implications of The Overlook as an embodiment of hell and how this could be relevant to the Torrances’ psychological health. Using Jungian theory, we connected these analyses to the process of the corruption and tyranny of societies and their governments, specifically the Soviet Union. Within this context, we noted how a patriarchal figure, raised above criticism and protected by the denial of the citizenry, can perpetrate terrible evil.\n\nWithin the context of formalist theory, we looked at some of the music used in The Shining, as well as touching on cinematographic elements of the film, including transitions, and some of the scientific background for the efficacy of some of the crucial elements of horror.\n\nFinally, utilizing postmodern theories, we discussed the elements of binary oppositions which are at play in The Shining, as well as the lack of objective truth and reliable observers.\n\nCollectively, we took a comprehensive, holistic and broad approach, elucidating some of the richest elements of a film that has been of academic note for several decades. Hopefully, some of these interpretations and theories have added something of value to an already extensive body of work surrounding The Shining.\n\nThe Shining is a kind of mirror into which any man may look and see the collective evil of the human race reflected back at him. It draws us into the dark psyche of the abuser and the harrowing plight of his victims. Stanley Kubrick’s masterpiece rings out across time as a salient warning against complicity or inaction in the face of evil."
