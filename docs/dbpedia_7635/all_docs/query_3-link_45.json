        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn the summer of 1975, moviegoers lined up to get a good scare. Jaws was a runaway hit. But the film did more than freak out people with a rompin’, chompin’ mechanical Great White shark. It also demonstrated the power of scary music. The accelerating musical theme—bah-dump…bah-dump…bah-dump…BAH-DUMP, BAH-DUMP, BAH-DUMP... BAH-DUMP…—warning the shark was closing in for a snack—was enough to make the audience crawl under the seats and cancel the trip to the beach. Listen below and see if you agree:\n\nJohn Williams: “Main Title” (excerpt) from Jaws (1975)\n\nThe theme from Jaws is one example of scary movie music at its horrifying best.\n\nScary music has a long, bone-chilling history in symphonies, plays, ballets, and operas, as well as movies. Most listeners automatically recognize when music sends clues that something creepy is hiding under the bed, in the basement, or behind the mask. And the creators of spooky tunes know exactly what they are doing to send shivers down the spines of listeners.\n\n“Music contributes a lot to the overall emotional experience of an audience,” says Neil Lerner. Lerner is a professor of music at Davidson College in Davidson, North Carolina, and an expert in horror film music. Music composers and arrangers have a variety of ways to add eeriness, ramp up suspense, or help deliver the shock people love to fear, according to Professor Lerner.\n\nA favorite scary music technique is sound and music that hints a character is being chased. For example, the music may speed up and grow louder to suggest the danger is closing in. “My hunch is that our brains hear that music in terms of being hunted,” suggests Lerner. “Our instincts tell us a creature is upon us and we need to run away or turn and fight.” That was the technique the Jaws theme used to such terrifying effect.\n\nWhat are other ways composers craft their music to scare us?\n\nMaking Scary\n\nRhythm\n\nA heartbeat, ticking clock, footsteps, a galloping horse—these are familiar sounds a composer may echo in the beat of a song. By changing the pace—speeding up the rhythm or slowing it down—the composer sends a signal that can put listeners on the edge of their seats. Accelerating tempo (speed of music) might suggest a chase or the heavy breathing of a frightened character. Slowing down the beat might indicate lurking evil or a fading heartbeat. Using an unsteady beat often hints that something is out of whack or out of control. Bringing back a steady rhythm helps ease the tension.\n\nEdvard Grieg: “In The Hall of the Mountain King” (excerpt) from Peer Gynt (1875)\n\nDynamics\n\nRefers to how loud or soft notes are played, and how the volume changes during the course of a song. Soft, eerie music can raise suspense by suggesting danger in the distance. Getting louder may hint that something or someone is about to pounce. Listen:\n\nCarl Orff: “O Fortuna” (excerpt) from Carmina Burana (1936)\n\nPitch\n\nEver notice how people’s voices often get higher when they feel nervous? Composers may build this behavior into their music, raising tension by having the instruments or voices shift upward in pitch to higher notes. In the art song “The Erlkonig,” for example, composer Franz Schubert has the voice of the young son get higher and higher as a forest spirit pursues him. Listen:\n\nFranz Schubert: “Der Erlkönig” D.328 (excerpt) (1821)\n\nDissonance\n\nSome musical notes sound good together, creating harmony. Other combinations produce friction, making us wince and feel uncomfortable. An example of a creepy combination is the tritone—a musical chord that can annoy the ears and suggest something is terribly wrong. Long ago, church leaders labeled the tritone “Diabolus in Musica”—“The Devil in Music.” In Saint-Saëns’ Danse Macabre, Death raises skeletons to a graveyard dance by playing his violin in sinister tritones. Listen:\n\nCamille Saint-Saëns: Danse Macabre (excerpt) (1874)\n\nWhen composers want to signal that the coast is clear, they will often return to a pleasant-sounding harmony.\n\nStrange Instrumentation\n\nHearing a strange, unfamiliar sound can stop us in our tracks to listen for trouble. In a similar way, arrangers of scary music will sometimes use unusual instruments or play instruments in unusual ways to give a song freaky weirdness. Composers John Cage and George Crumb wrote music for a specially-prepared piano that might have screws, hair clips, and playing cards attached to the strings so the instrument sounded bizarre. Listen to the two examples in the audio player below:\n\nJohn Cage: Sonata II for prepared piano (excerpt) (1946)\n\nGeroge Crumb: “The Phantom Gondolier” (excerpt) from Makrokosmos (1972)\n\nStingers\n\nIn suspenseful TV shows, bursts of music that deliver a shock usually blare just before a commercial break. Buffy the Vampire Slayer, for example, often punctuated a scary scene with screeching violins that sound like a rising scream. Stingers can even be turned on their heads to make us laugh, as in the clip of the “dramatic prairie dog.” Watch and listen:\n\nPlaying with Expectations\n\nWant to know when a movie monster is about to attack? Listen for the silence or a sweet, gentle tune. A music arranger will often try to get the audience to relax before delivering the big “AAARGH!” Another tactic is to increase tension by performing a familiar song in eerie ways, like a baby’s lullaby played out of tune. Listen:\n\nLudwig Van Beethoven: Mvt. II from Piano Sonata No. 14 in C♯ minor “Quasi una fantasia,” Op. 27, No. 2 (1801)\n\nThe Scary Music Hall of Fame\n\nThese audio players contains a few of the scariest pieces of music ever written. When you listen, try to pick out techniques from this article the composer used. Most importantly, listen to your feelings. What are they telling you about the music?\n\nSubtitled “Thirteen Images from the Dark Land,” George Crumb’s Black Angels is an avant-garde work for electric string quartet. It was featured on the soundtrack of the 1973 film, The Exorcist.\n\nGeorge Crumb: “Threnody I: Night of the Electric Insects” From Black Angels (1970)\n\n“Ave Satani” is the theme song to the film The Omen (1976) composed by Jerry Goldsmith. The Omen won an Oscar for Best Score with “Ave Satani” nominated for Best Song, one of the few foreign language (Latin) songs ever to be nominated.\n\nJerry Goldsmith: “Ave Satani” (excerpt) from The Omen (1976)\n\n“The Murder” was composed by Bernard Herrmann for the horror-thriller film Psycho (1960) directed by Alfred Hitchcock. The score is recognized as arguably one of the most famous in movie history.\n\nBernard Herrmann: “The Murder” (excerpt) from Psycho (1960)\n\nBernard Herrmann also composed the soundtrack for the science fiction film The Day the Earth Stood Still. Herrmann chose unusual instrumentation for the film, including violin, cello, and bass (all three electric); two theremin electronic instruments; two Hammond organs; a large studio electric organ; three vibraphones; two glockenspiels; two pianos; two harps; three trumpets; three trombones; and four tubas. Unusual overdubbing and tape-reversal techniques were used as well.\n\nBernard Herrmann: “Prelude/Outer Space/Radar” (excerpt) from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)\n\nTubular Bells is the debut record album of English musician Mike Oldfield, released in 1973. The opening piano solo was used as a soundtrack to the William Friedkin film The Exorcist (released the same year).\n\nMike Oldfield: “Tubular Bells” (excerpt) from The Exorcist (1973)\n\nA big reason for the success of the 1978 film Halloween is the moody musical score, particularly the main theme. Lacking a symphonic soundtrack, the film's score consists of a piano and synthesizer melody played in a 10/8 or “complex 5/4” meter composed by director John Carpenter.\n\nJohn Carpenter: “Main Title” (excerpt) from Halloween (1978)\n\nThe “Ewangelia” movement of Krzysztof Penderecki’s Utrenja was used to great effect for the “jump scare” moments in Stanley Kubricks’ 1980 horror classic, The Shining.\n\nKrzysztof Penderecki: “Utrenja: Ewangelia” (excerpt) from The Shining (1980)\n\n“Kanon Paschy” is another Utrenja excerpt featured in The Shining. The stylistically modernist art-music chosen by Kubrick is similar to the repertoire he first explored in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). Although the music was selected by Kubrick, the process of matching passages of music to motion picture was left almost entirely at the discretion of music editor Gordon Stainforth.\n\nKrzysztof Penderecki: “Utrenja: Kanon Paschy” (excerpt) from The Shining (1980)\n\nThe soundtrack to Dario Argento’s 1977 horror film Suspiria was composed and performed by the Italian prog-rock band Goblin. It uses a nursery rhyme-like melody and menacing vocals to great effect.\n\nClaudio Simonetti: “Suspiria” (excerpt) from Suspiria (1977)\n\nThe Haunted Mansion in Disney’s theme parks uses several variations of the playfully spooky song “Grim Grinning Ghosts,” written by Buddy Baker and X Atencio, as you ride through the different rooms of the attraction.\n\nBuddy Baker: “Foyer Music” (excerpt) from The Haunted Mansion (1969)"
