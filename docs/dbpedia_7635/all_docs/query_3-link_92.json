        "text": "Jojo Moyes knows where I’m going with this. When I ask her, “What was the hardest part about writing a screenplay?” she’s ready—maybe because I told her I read her book, Me Before You, which she adapted for the major motion picture starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin. Or maybe because journalist-book reader-combos before me have brought it up too—after all, this is one of the last stops of an exhaustive press tour for the film. Or maybe she’s just ready to talk about it, because she’s got an answer queued up for the tough question I hadn’t even asked, about a major moment from the book that’s missing onscreen:\n\n“Letting go of scenes that you felt were important, she says. “For example, the scene that relates to the sexual assault.”\n\nMoyes is the author of 12 novels. Eight of them flew under the radar, receiving some praise from small papers but tepid sales. Her ninth, Me Before You, however, sold over a million copies, thanks, in part, to positive review in The New York Times.\n\nIt was the rising tide that lifted all boats— her other books grew popular retroactively and her future ones did well too, swarmed with Amazon purchases by Jojo Moyes superfans who bought anything with her name emblazoned on the cover. Moyes was now not just an author, but a beloved author. And now probably a wealthy one—movie rights were optioned and a sequel, After You, followed soon after.\n\nThe (abridged) plot of Me Before You is this: A small town girl from the English countryside, Louisa, is fired from her job, and in a fit of desperation, becomes a caregiver for a handsome former master of the universe, Will, who is paralyzed from the neck down. He’s jaded, rude, and pretentious. She’s zany, chatty, and kind. At first, they clash, but then they fall in love. She teaches him to find slivers of joy in his existence. He teaches her to expand her horizons. To avoid a major spoiler alert, suffice it to say that things get complicated—as Sam Claflin told me, “It’s a love story, at the heart of the story, but there are some very difficult issues.”\n\nThe book sounds like a collection of tropes, a knock-off Pygmalion. But when you read it, it’s not. It’s an existential work that’s masquerading as a beach read, a novel with beautiful characters whose complicated, textured souls are far more interesting.\n\nHer heroine Louisa Clark is a working-class girl with gumption. Many of Moyes’s female characters are. When I bring it up, she becomes animated. “[My books have] a slightly feminist element. I’m not really interested in girls who buy things; I’m interested in girls who do things,” she says. “I’m not interested in girls reading books about how one man is going to fix your life.”\n\nLouisa’s depth even goes beyond that of a struggling middle-class hero. She may be light and airy and chipper, but there’s an unshakeable tinge of tragedy about her. She’s never really ventured beyond the small town she lives in. There are economic restraints, but it’s more than that. It’s a phobia, a fear of not playing it safe.\n\nThe flashback—one of many elements that sets Me Before You at the front of the romantic novel class—reveals why. Louisa was sexually assaulted by a group of men, and in an emotional moment in the novel, she returns to the scene of the assault with Will and explains her trauma. It’s this plot line, arguably over any other in the novel, that gives the most insight to Louisa as a character.\n\nBut movie-goers will never know that side of Louisa Clark. Because it never made it into the film.\n\nThey tried to keep it, Moyes said. She thinks they must have rewritten it 10 times over six months. But she says it didn’t make sense.\n\n“What we found was that every time we came back to that scene—in the book, it’s almost like a throwaway line, it’s quite opaque, so when you’re reading it you almost go back and go ‘what did she just say happened?’ There’s no way of doing that visually. And every time we tried to write the scene where you have the flashback, and the men and the kind of horror of it, it became a far weightier thing.”\n\nThey tried really hard, she assures me. But it just didn’t work.\n\n“You can’t approach that topic in a throwaway manner on film.”\n\nI ask her if she’s sad that moviegoers will never see that side of Louisa. She sighs.\n\n“No. When you are a writer and you sign over your baby—give it to a movie studio—you have to accept that they are quite different beasts. Personally I’m amazed that the two have remained as close to each other as they have, because you kind of give up your right to that story. You accept that, in some cases, they are going to adapt the hell out of it. In my case, as I said, I think we were lucky that we wanted something to remain very much the same. No, I'm not sad.”\n\nI bring up her earlier comment, that she wants her books to be feminist. Did that part of her feel any guilt about cutting the assault?\n\n“No. It was purely technical. The one that I felt really strongly about is that Louisa should not be saved by Will anymore than he should be saved by her,” she said. “I think she is just as valid a character as he is.”\n\nThere’s a common saying that the book is always better than the movie, that there’s no way it can live up to readers’ expectations. But there’s a second question that most people don’t think about: is this going to live up to the author’s expectations?\n\nThere are famous examples of when it doesn’t work. E.L. James clashed with 50 Shades of Grey director Sam Taylor-Johnson, who she thought wasn’t staying true to the heart (or erm, loins) of her X-rated novel. Saving Mr. Banks chronicled the particularities of P.L. Travers, the length Walt Disney went to woo her, and in the end, how it still may not have been enough for her. Authors can’t help it. They micromanage. It’s their baby, after all.\n\nMoyes says Me Before You was not like a 50 Shades or a Mary Poppins. This production was a collaboration, a “happy ship.” She alludes to these cases in a hushed tone. “There was a lot of horror stories about writers and Hollywood going around at the time.”\n\nShe says has a great relationship with Me Before You’s director Thea Sharrock. “I felt consulted with and referred back to at all times,” she said. “There were few egos in the room.” She was kept in the loop about casting, and Sharrock would often ring her 6 a.m. before a scene was shot, asking her opinions on lines. She thought Emilia and Sam were perfect (Emilia, she jokes, is a lot more like Louisa in real life than she is Khalessi.) And yes, she agreed with all cuts from the novel.\n\nEven the sexual assault.\n\nIt appears that JoJo Moyes really is at peace as her novel—her golden child—comes to the screen. But she has been checking Twitter after each screening to see what people have being tweeting about the movie. “It’s mostly positive, so far,” she says. A trace of anxiousness creeps across her face."
