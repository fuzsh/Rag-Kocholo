        "text": "Every two years, we are rewarded with another rendition of the Olympic Games. Whether it be summer or winter, we can expect a slew of amazing and inspiring stories from athletes around the world as they represent their countries and compete for the gold medal. These tales are often so compelling that they warrant a cinematic recreation—with the results sometimes being legendary. Over the years, many films have originated from the Olympics, but a select few have stood above the rest. From dramatic features to landmark documentaries, these revered tales have recreated and immortalized the momentary magic we witness from the historic event. It’s an amazing feat to pull off, and this list aims to honor the best of the best.\n\nBelow, you’ll find what I believe to be the 20 greatest Olympic movies ever made. Throughout this journey, you’ll not only gain insight into some of cinema’s most compelling sports stories, but you’ll also learn about some journeys you never knew and athletes you’ve never heard of. If you’re a novice to the genre, or even if you’re a connoisseur, then this list can server as your end-all-be-all to the most important cinematic moments in Olympic history.\n\nTop Olympic Movies\n\nBefore we get to the official rankings, let’s review what you can expect to find from this list. While there are a couple fictional stories mixed in here, the narrative features largely focus on true stories from some of the most famous athletes of our time (or were at least inspired by real-life athletes). For the feature films, the most famous athletes featured include Jim Thorpe (the first Native American to win a gold medal for the United States), Steve Prefontaine (who set numerous American track records in the 1970s) and Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams (runners who famously competed in the 1924 Paris Olympics). For the documentaries, the most prominent athletes include Michael Phelps (a swimmer who holds the all-time record for most gold medals), Tommie Smith and John Carlos (runners known for their iconic protest during the 1968 Mexico City Olympics) and Kevin Pearce (a snowboarder who suffered a career-ending injury).\n\nDozens of countries are represented on this list, from both a narrative and directorial standpoint. It should be no surprise, given that Hollywood produced many of these films, that the United States is most represented. But you will also find numerous stories from other nations, including a Best Picture winner that centers on Great Britain, a revered documentary about a water polo match between Hungary and the Soviet Union and a famous comedy about a Jamaican bobsledding team—as well as features directed by filmmakers from Japan, Germany, France and Russia (as well as several other countries).\n\nWhile Olympic movies don’t generally smash at the box office, there have been a handful of winners. The highest grossing Olympic movie of all time is the family-friendly film Cool Runnings with its $154.8 million worldwide gross, which just ekes out the absurdist comedy Blades of Glory’s $145.7 million. When it comes to domestic gross, however, Chariots of Fire holds the record. While its $58.9 million gross doesn’t match Blades of Glory’s $118.5 million earnings, when adjusted for inflation that total jumps to $198.7 million. Other top grossing movies include Miracle ($64.4 million worldwide), I, Tonya ($53.9 million) and The Cutting Edge ($25.1 million).\n\nAnd now for the rankings. Below I have gathered together 20 films—ten of which are narrative features, ten of which are documentaries. Those two categories will switch off one by one as we move closer towards the #1 movies. This way, you’ll get a nice variety of Olympic movies that can satisfy your tastes at any given moment. These rankings are purely based on my personal tastes, with some historical significance taken into account. So without further ado, let’s rank the top Olympic movies of all time.\n\n20. The Weight of Gold (2020)\n\nYou’ve done it. You’ve reached the pinnacle of your athletic career. You’re standing at the starting line of the racetrack, or at the center line of the hockey rink or on the starting block of the swimming pool. Seemingly, this is the height. But, mentally, it’s also too much to bear for many athletes. Cue the 2020 documentary The Weight of Gold, which features candid interviews with prominent Olympians like Michael Phelps, Lolo Jones and Shaun White. Directed by Brett Rapkin, this collage of personal stories offers a frank look at the anxiety, the depression, the immense pressure these world-class athletes face in their quest to succeed. This raw, honest portrayal of the often-overlooked psychological toll of sports makes it a poignant and necessary watch for fans of the Olympic Games.\n\nHere’s where you can stream The Weight of Gold.\n\n19. Cool Runnings (1993)\n\nWhile it’s tempting to think of Cool Runnings as nothing more than a comedy—and it is, indeed, a very funny and entertaining movie—at its heart the film is a tale of sheer determination and unyielding spirit. This beloved flick tells the incredible true story of the first Jamaican bobsled team to compete in the Winter Olympics. A charming comedy-drama directed by Jon Turteltaub, who gave us other family-friendly features like National Treasure and The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, the film stars John Candy as the disgraced coach who leads the team, with Leon Robinson, Doug E. Doug and Malik Yoba playing the plucky bobsledders. An entertaining blend of humor and heart, Cool Runnings earned acclaim for its feel-good story and became a cherished family classic by openly and sincerely embracing the power of perseverance and teamwork.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Cool Runnings.\n\n18. Freedom’s Fury (2006)\n\nIn the midst of the Hungarian Revolution, a water polo match against the Soviet Union became a contumacious and necessary symbol of defiance and national pride. Produced by Hollywood heavies like Quentin Tarantino and Lucy Liu, Freedom’s Fury captures this dramatic, historic event that’s often referred to as the \"Blood in the Water\" match, as the contest quickly became ugly. This compelling documentary about a story largely lost to time was directed by Colin Keith Gray and Megan Raney Aarons, featuring insightful interviews with players and historians, shedding light on the intense political climate that hung overhead and every emotional stake involved. The film proved that war movies can be approached in different ways, as Freedom’s Fury was lauded for its gripping portrayal of how sports can intersect with and shine a spotlight on and bring catharsis to global conflicts.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Freedom’s Fury.\n\n17. International Velvet (1978)\n\nA sequel to the 1944 film National Velvet, which starred Elizabeth Taylor as a girl named Velvet Brown who trains her raucous horse for England's Grand National race, International Velvet ups the stakes as Velvet’s niece Sarah inherits her aunt’s horse and dreams of becoming part of the British Olympic team. Directed by Bryan Forbes, this equine-themed film stars Tatum O’Neal (who famously co-starred with her father Ryan O’Neal in Paper Moon), Christopher Plummer and Oscar winner Anthony Hopkins. While the film received mixed reviews, it remains an unpretentious, encouraging look at just how far ambition and perseverance can take you when trying to honor your family’s legacy. The strong performances from its trio of powerhouse actors make it a memorable watch.\n\nHere’s where you can stream International Velvet.\n\n16. Fists of Freedom: The Story of the '68 Summer Games (1999)\n\nThe 1968 Summer Olympic Games in Mexico City were filled with politically charged moments and unforgettable stories, but above them all was the resistance shown by John Carlos and Tommie Smith. Set against a backdrop of global upheaval, director George Roy’s documentary Fists of Freedom: The Story of the '68 Summer Games explores the powerful protest by these two legendary track athletes as they each audaciously raised their fists on the medal podium, symbolizing the fight for civil rights that gripped their nation—and the rest of the world, for that matter—at the time. Through interviews with Smith, Carlos and other key figures, such as boxer George Foreman and activist Dr. Harry Edwards, as well as archival footage, the film examines the immortal intersection of sports and politics.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Fists of Freedom: The Story of the '68 Summer Games.\n\n15. The Cutting Edge (1992)\n\nSports films are often inspiring because they re-enact real-life events in dramatized fashion. But, as The Cutting Edge showed, sometimes the power of fictional storytelling—intimate, unassuming and downright charming in its delivery—is all you need to capture the power of sports. A favorite film of mine growing up, this romance directed by Paul Michael Glaser stars Moira Kelly as Kate Moseley, a world-class, prima donna figure skater who can’t find the right skate-mate for the 1992 Winter Olympics, and D.B. Sweeney as Doug Dorsey, the no-nonsense captain of the U.S. ice hockey team who is forced to retire from the sport after an injury, and eventually becomes Kate’s unlikely partner. Anyone who isn’t afraid of a little humor and romance being part of their sports flicks will find that The Cutting Edge charismatically mixes all those flavors for a winning story that captures the spirit of the Olympic Games.\n\nHere’s where you can stream The Cutting Edge.\n\n14. 9.79* (2012)\n\nIn the world of competitive athletics, the 1988 Seoul Olympics 100-meter final stands out as a race that changed the sport forever. As part of the 30 for 30 documentary series from ESPN, 9.79* dives into the story behind this infamous race, where Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson shattered records but was later disqualified for doping. Directed by Daniel Gordon, this fascinating documentary examines the fallout and the subsequent revelations about the prevalence of performance-enhancing drugs in athletics. Through interviews with Johnson and his competitors, 9.79* provides a comprehensive and gripping look at the scandal, earning praise for its thorough and balanced exploration of a dark chapter in Olympic history that potentially tainted the legacy of who many consider to be the greatest sprinter of all time.\n\nHere’s where you can stream 9.79*.\n\n13. The Boys in the Boat (2023)\n\nThere aren’t many narrative-based features from the 21st century that have earned a spot amongst the “greatest Olympic films ever made,” but The Boys in the Boat made a compelling case upon its release last year. Based on Daniel James Brown's bestselling book, this historical drama produced and directed by George Clooney recounts the inspiring true story of the University of Washington's rowing team, which overcame immense odds to win gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. This story whose screenplay was written by Mark L. Smith, who penned films like The Revenant, The Midnight Sky and the upcoming Twisters, highlights the personal and collective struggles of these rowers, set against the backdrop of the Great Depression and the rise of Nazi Germany. The film, which stars Joel Edgerton as coach Al Ulbrickson, as well as Callum Turner and Peter Guinness, wins out with its compelling story and strong performances.\n\nHere’s where you can stream The Boys in the Boat.\n\n12. Visions of Eight (1973)\n\nOften, sports movies are fairly unostentatious in their approach, free from stylistic flourishes that could potentially take away from the grit of the game. But Visions of Eight stands as a unique cinematic exploration of sporting events, offering eight distinct perspectives on the 1972 Munich Olympics. With the various segments directed by acclaimed filmmakers from various countries—Miloš Forman (Czechoslovakia), Claude Lelouch (France), Yuri Ozerov (Russia), Mai Zetterling (Sweden), Kon Ichikawa (Japan), John Schlesinger (England), Arthur Penn (United States) and Michael Pfleghar (Germany)—this revered anthology captures the intense competition and moments of personal struggle and triumph that come with the Olympic Games. Each director brings their unique style and vision to the forefront, creating an unforgettable mosaic of the experience.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Visions of Eight.\n\n11. Downhill Racer (1969)\n\nAn Olympics-themed film is one thing—an Olympics-themed film starring Academy Award winners like Robert Redford and Gene Hackman and directed by sports film connoisseur Michael Ritchie is another entirely. A gripping portrayal of just how high the stakes of competitive sports can go, Downhill Racer stars Redford as an arrogant but talented skier named Chappellet aiming for Olympic glory and Hackman as his rough-and-tough coach Claire who continually pushes Chappellet to the brink. This critically adored film, which was ultimately a box office failure, depicts the cost of the relentless pursuit of victory, embracing an intense and authentic portrayal of the competitive world of skiing that’s more dangerous than it appears. Downhill Racer is a great example of old-school Hollywood movies perfectly navigating the genre formula, as film critic Roger Ebert called it “the best movie ever made about sports.”\n\nHere’s where you can stream Downhill Racer.\n\n10. White Rock (1977)\n\nWhen producer Michael Samuelson was tasked with making a film about the 1976 Winter Olympics, he enlisted director Tony Maylam to help. They agreed that, up to that point, only two films had truly captured the nature of the Games: Leni Riefenstahl’s Olympia and Kon Ichikawa’s film Tokyo Olympiad (considered by many to be the greatest Olympics documentary ever). With those inspirations in mind, they paired up to create White Rock, which aimed to feel less like a documentary and more like a feature film. This visually stunning documentary captures the excitement and drama of the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria, combining breathtaking footage of various winter sports backed by the inimitable James Coburn’s gripping narration. Rarely do documentaries have this much energy, as White Rock brought the Winter Olympics to life like few others have.\n\nHere’s where you can stream White Rock.\n\n9. Jim Thorpe – All American (1951)\n\nWhen it comes to legendary Hollywood directors, few have earned the respect and accrued the prestige that Michael Curtiz has. Helming classics like Casablanca, White Christmas and Mildred Pierce, as well as underrated gems like The Mystery of the Wax Museum and Doctor X, Curtiz has made a career of directing both dramatic and genre movies to perfection, and Jim Thorpe – All American was no exception. Starring Burt Lancaster, this biographical drama tells the inspiring story of one of the greatest athletes of the 20th century. The film chronicles Thorpe's journey from his humble beginnings to his triumphs at the 1912 Olympics and beyond, all the while facing racial discrimination for being a member of the Sac and Fox Nation. While the cast is unfortunately predominantly white, including its main star, Jim Thorpe – All American nonetheless does an admirable job capturing the story of the first Native American to win gold for the United States.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Jim Thorpe – All American.\n\n8. The Crash Reel (2013)\n\nRarely do Olympic documentaries have this sort of intense following right out of the gate. But as soon as The Crash Reel released back in 2013, it was met with fervent praise from both critics and audiences alike. Currently one of the highest rated documentaries on Letterboxd and the owner of a 96% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, this gripping story of snowboarder Kevin Pearce poignantly explores the highs (winning numerous competitions as a teenager) and devastating lows (a traumatic injury that ended his career) of extreme sports. Directed by Lucy Walker, the documentary covers Pearce’s career-ending brain injury and his ultimate recovery, all the while highlighting the risks athletes take for their greatest passion. Featuring interviews with Pearce’s family and friends, The Crash Reel has been celebrated since its release for its raw portrayal of Pearce’s struggles and triumphs.\n\nHere’s where you can stream The Crash Reel.\n\n7. Foxcatcher (2014)\n\nRarely do films offer such a cynical look at the Olympic Games. But given just how cutthroat some of the athletes can be, given how ruthless some of the coaches have historically been, it’s worth considering a chilling tale of ambition and tragedy Foxcatcher as an important addition to the Olympic cinematic canon. Directed by Bennett Miller, who also gave us the esteemed sports film Moneyball, this Oscar-nominated biographical drama delves into the dark side of Olympic dreams. Starring Steve Carell, Mark Ruffalo (both of whom were nominated for an Academy Award) and Channing Tatum, the film follows the true story of Olympic wrestler Mark Schultz and his brother Dave as they become entangled with eccentric millionaire John du Pont, whose obsession with coaching an Olympic-winning team leads to unforeseen (and, not to mention, deadly) consequences. Lauded for its haunting performances, especially Carell's transformative role, and its tense, atmospheric direction, Foxcatcher is an important document of the perilous intersection of power, manipulation and sport.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Foxcatcher.\n\n6. Icarus (2017)\n\nWhat began as an experiment by director and producer Bryan Fogel to understand the effects of performance-enhancing drugs quickly turned into a shocking exposé of one of the biggest doping scandals in sports history. Icarus follows Fogel’s journey as he uncovers a major doping operation with the help of Russian scientist Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, a whistle-blower who had to go into hiding following his involvement in the state-run doping program in Russia. This wildly interesting and ultimately consequential documentary reveals just how deep the extensive state-sponsored doping program in Russia went and how secretly it was kept, which ultimately led to stricter overwatch by the World Anti-Doping Agency and the International Olympic Committee. Icarus was praised for its investigative approach, becoming the only Olympic film to win the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Icarus.\n\n5. Without Limits (1998)\n\nThanks its its star, Jared Leto, Prefontaine became the most famous depiction of the life of Steve Roland “Pre” Prefontaine, an American long-distance runner who set numerous records. But I would argue that Without Limits is the truly definitive record of this legendary athlete’s celebrated and tragic life. Produced by Tom Cruise and directed by Robert Towne, this biographical drama stars Billy Crudup as Prefontaine and Donald Sutherland as his coach, Bill Bowerman (who would later co-found Nike). The film chronicles Prefontaine’s journey from his early days in Oregon to his remarkable performances at the 1972 Munich Olympics to his untimely death as he prepared for the 1976 Games. With its strong performances and insightful look into the athlete’s dedication and rebellious spirit, Without Limits captured the essence of a sports icon like few others have.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Without Limits.\n\n4. 16 Days of Glory (1986)\n\nHonestly, this entire list could be filled with Olympic documentaries from Bud Greenspan, who famously compiled 22 hour-long documentary specials on the Olympics called The Olympiad, for which he received the Olympic Order award in 1985. But if we’re choosing just one of director’s works, it’s hard to top 16 Days of Glory. Capturing the grandeur and spirit of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, this comprehensive document showcases the most memorable moments and athletes of that year’s Games, including the likes of Carl Lewis and Mary Lou Retton. Greenspan’s signature storytelling method blends personal athlete narratives with the broader social context of the competition, offering a uniquely human look at the Olympics. You’ll just know it when you see it: nobody else could make you care about the Olympics this much, could move you quite like Greenspan could.\n\nHere’s where you can stream 16 Days of Glory.\n\n3. Miracle (2004)\n\nThere are few stories in the history of the Olympics—heck, in the history of sports period—that carry the weight and power of the U.S. men’s hockey team winning gold at the 1980 Winter Games. Even crazier? That a film was able to effectively capture such transcendence. Recounting one of the greatest underdog stories in sports history, Miracle tells the tale of that legendary hockey team’s unexpected victory over the heavily favored Soviet team. Directed by Gavin O'Connor, who has given us films like Warrior and The Accountant, this famous sports film stars Kurt Russell as coach Herb Brooks, who led the young American team to an improbable gold medal, while also featuring memorable performances from Patricia Clarkson and Noah Emmerich. Teamwork, perseverance and national pride are all at the forefront of this beloved sports experience, as Miracle was praised for its thrilling and inspirational depiction of a historic moment.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Miracle.\n\n2. Tokyo Olympiad (1965)\n\nWhile compiling the greatest Olympic documentaries ever made, many films went on and off my list as I narrowed down the ten best—but the #1 documentary was never in doubt. A masterpiece of sports documentary filmmaking, Tokyo Olympiad offers a stunning and poetic portrayal of the Olympic Games like no other feature has in the history of cinema. Directed by Kon Ichikawa, the film eschews traditional narrative for a more artistic and contemplative approach, focusing on the beauty and drama of the athletes’ performances in the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Featuring hair-raising cinematography and an eclectic collection of both celebrated and obscure moments, this documentary captures the essence of the Games more than any other. Tokyo Olympiad was acclaimed for its innovative style and remains a landmark in sports filmmaking, offering a timeless, humanistic view of the quadrennial event.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Tokyo Olympiad.\n\n1. Chariots of Fire (1981)\n\nIcarus may have won Best Documentary Feature at the Academy Awards, but only one Olympic film has earned the top prize of the night: Best Picture. The winner of that prestigious award was, of course, of one of the great dramas of our time, the enduring classic that transcends sports, the inspiring true story of two British athletes who competed in the 1924 Paris Olympics amidst religious convictions: Chariots of Fire. Directed by British filmmaker Hugh Hudson, this monumental film won three other Oscars—most notably the award for Best Original Score, as Vangelis’ otherworldly electronic theme has arguably become the most memorable movie music ever. Starring Ben Cross as Harold Abrahams and Ian Charleson as Eric Liddell, this powerful film offers a profound exploration of the moral dilemmas faced by these historically significant figures, contrasting motivations of Abrahams, a Jewish athlete confronting anti-Semitism, and Liddell, a devout Christian who views running as an expression of his faith. In the end, Chariots of Fire touches on the politics and personal motivations that make the Olympic Games so important.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Chariots of Fire.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhether you’re looking for a narrative feature or a documentary, this list provides the best and most important cinematic stories in Olympic history. By watching these movies, you’ll gain a better appreciation and deeper understanding of the historic event."
