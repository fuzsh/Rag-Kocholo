        "text": "Spoilt heiress Judith Traherne (Davis) leads the life of a glamorous socialite, but her carefree existence takes a drastic turn when she begins experiencing severe headaches and impaired vision. She receives a devastating diagnosis of a brain tumour, but initially refuses to accept the severity of her condition, and even begins a romantic relationship with her doctor, Frederick Steele (George Brent). However, as her health deteriorates, Judith’s denial gives way to fear and despair.\n\nA poignant exploration of mortality, love, and the human spirit, Dark Victory features one of Davis’s most nuanced, heart-breaking performances.\n\nScreening as part of Fasten Your Seatbelts: The Films of Bette Davis.\n\nNotes by David O’Mahony"
