Restraint in the telling of a story and perfection in the acting of it turn up so seldom in pictures that the coincidence of the two in the Warners' "Shining Victory" makes for a film which seems much better than it actually is. Perhaps that is tossing the damn somewhat bluntly in a bouquet of praise but that is the most gentle way we know to deliver this report. And gentle we do want to be. For the truly superior performances of James Stephenson, Geraldine Fitzgerald and Donald Crisp; the integrity of Irving Rapper's direction and the polish of a literate script do so much to offset a poor story that objections seem almost violent.Yet objections are bound to intrude. For this slow and generally unimpassioned tragedy, which came yesterday to the Strand, is basically meretricious and makes no dramatic point. It is derived (the drama department informs us) from A. J. Cronin's play, "Jupiter Laughs," which was seen here briefly last Fall and which has obviously not been improved. And the story is simply that of the strange love which slowly grows between a brilliant but bumptious nerve specialist and his lovely young research assistant—a love which is cruelly shattered when the girl sacrifices her life in a fire to save the doctor's precious data.Such a thing could happen, all right. But what in heaven's name does it prove? That the medical profession is filled with modestly self-effacing heroes—and heroines? That love conquers all? Or merely that research laboratories should be properly fireproofed? No, we rather think it proves nothing, except that a tiny plot which permits two differing people to come together, fall in love and be torn apart is considered sufficient for a film.And in this case, by golly, it almost is. For Mr. Stephenson makes of the doctor a crisp, cool and sharply direct man who you can actually believe is a scientist; Miss Fitzgerald is beautifully reticent and unaffected as the girl and Mr. Crisp is sage, benign and reliable as an elderly doctor and friend. The supporting cast is likewise uniformly good. But still the fact remains that they suffer to no avail. Neither do they nor the picture have much to show for time spent at the end.
