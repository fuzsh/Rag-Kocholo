Introduction

As of 2019, there are eighty-six national universities, ninety-three public universities and 607 private universities. The definition of each type of university is detailed below, as per the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT):

National universities, which have been established in all local prefectures as organizations targeting the improvement and well-balanced development of Japanese higher education and academic research, have played important roles as local research centers etc.

Public universities, which have been established and managed by local public entities or public university corporations, have also played important roles in providing higher education opportunities to local people and as intellectual and cultural centers in the local community.

Private universities are institutions of higher education, not operated, owned, or institutionally funded by governments.

Zachary Harden, 29 August 2023 [Ed. note; As of 18 February 2024, the number of active universities (along with designation) has changed since the above list was put out by MEXT. This list maybe be incomplete or include universities that have since been merged, renamed or closed entirely.]

National Universities

Designated National Universities

In April 2017, an amendment to the National University Corporation Act enabled the classification of national university corporations as âDesignated National University Corporationsâ, with the stated aims of significantly improving the education and research levels of Japanese universities. As of 2021 a total of 10 national universities have been thus selected by the MEXT. (Wikipedia)
