        "text": "JAPAN!\n\nKonnichiwa!\n\nJust wanted to let you know that I made it safely and will be in the mission home for a few days and am loving it! President and Sister Welch are awesome. Tomorrow I will meet my trainer and get sent to my first area. I’ll write more on Monday!\n\nArigatou and aishitemasu,\n\nPoelman Shimai\n\nAshley arrives in Japan\n\nIt’s Wednesday afternoon in Japan and Ashley’s plane touched down in the last hour at the Kansai International Airport (KIX) near Osaka.\n\nShe and 25 other missionaries headed for the Japan Kobe Mission began the journey by flying from Salt Lake City to San Francisco. The missionaries were hard to miss on the small jet. While in San Francisco she used a pay phone to call her parents and say HI.\n\nTo her surprise, Ashley ran into one of her mother’s friends, Noriko, at the gate for the United flight to Osaka. Noriko, who lives in Utah, was on the same flight to visit family in Japan.\n\nAfter arriving in Japan, Ashley used her brand new, first ever Japanese passport to clear customs, picked up her luggage, and is now (presumably) on a train bound for Kobe. We’ll hear more about her trip when she writes on her next Preparation Day, which is expected to be Monday.\n\nWeek 8 (Ashley’s e-mail dated Oct 16, 2014)\n\nKonnichiwa kazoku to tomodachi! [Hi family and friends!]\n\nFirst off, we got FLIGHT PLANS this week!! We are actually going to Nihon after all! I can attach a picture of the flight plans but basically we go from Salt Lake to San Francisco to Osaka! WE ARE SO STOKED! Our flight doesn’t actually leave until Tuesday 10/21 though (all of the missionaries except the ones going to Kobe leave on Monday at 6am) but we are still really, really excited. We have to meet at the travel office at 2:30am so that should be exciting too haha. I’ll attach a picture of the exact plans but make note of the times for the layover in SF because I’ll be calling sometime during then. Do you want me to call you at work dad and then mom at home? Or could you make it a conference call or something? Let me know maybe via DearElder sometime soon – that would be great!\n\nWe are all really excited and ready to go. It still all feels like a dream though! Only 4 more full days in America! Next time I e-mail you, it will be from Nihon. 🙂\n\nSome more exciting news- we got new kohai [juniors, i.e. newly arriving missionaries]! No one was expecting them so on Sunday it was a big shock but a nice surprise. It was one district so we have 4 new shimaitachi [sisters]. We were able to do orientation for the [new missionaries] on Wednesday which was fun.\n\nDevotionals this week were by Brother Douboy (?) and Elder Lawrence. Brother Douboy is in charge of the media for the church so it was a really cool fireside. We got to see the rough cut for a new video coming out on Youtube in December for Christmas – it was really cool! He talked about how the gospel is sweeping the earth and how big of a role technology plays in spreading this gospel. Also, have you seen Meet the Mormons? We can’t see it here but I really wish we could! I did hear it was one of the top 10 opening movies or something like that the day it came out.\n\nElder Lawrence gave a really good fireside on the adversary and his negative influences in our life. He shared with us the 4 tactics Satan uses on us and despite his power, we will always have more power than him because we have Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ on our side. We have angels round about us and help from the other side. (D&C 84:88) [D&C 84:88: And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.] We are winning the battle against the adversary and we as missionaries are at the frontline of the battlefield. It was a really awesome [talk].\n\nAlso at choir this week, Brother Eggett shared an awesome scripture that has really been one of my favorites this week! Isaiah 41:10,13 [(Verse 10) Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness. (Verse 13) For I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.]\n\nSkype TRC [practice teaching] this week was really, really amazing. Her testimony and spirit were so strong! Her name was Yoko and she is in the Kobe Stake so hopefully we can meet her in Nihon sometime during our mission! It’s amazing the technology we have nowadays to be able to talk to Nihonjin and share testimonies with them from across the world!\n\nI don’t have much time but I truly am thankful for this opportunity to serve a mission. I love it with all my heart and am thankful for the opportunity to go and share what I love with others!\n\nAishiteimasu! [Love you!] (and talk to you soon!)\n\nPoelman Shimai\n\nWeek 7 (Ashley’s e-mail dated October 9, 2014)\n\nKonnichiwa!!\n\nHow is everyone?! Minasan wa genki desu ka?\n\nWe have 11 days left!!! How crazy is that?! Tomorrow we get our flight plans and I am stoked. I am hoping we fly through SF but we’ll see. I guess you won’t find out until next Thursday and then the week after I will be in Nihon!! I also am probably going to be able to call you at the airport but I’ll let you know.\n\nI got a package from [Aunt] Carol this week which was such a nice surprise!! Eric also colored a picture of Snoopy which I LOVE. It’s hanging up in the classroom, I’ll try to attach a picture of it. She also sent some sweet tarts which were a big hit for me haha and among all of the missionaries in the district so I really really appreciated that! Hopefully on the plane, I’ll have time to catch up on all of the letters I have to send. Everyone has been so nice in sending letters! As always, thank you so much for your weekly letters. It was also fun to see Thomas in his white coat [from starting dental school]. Hope that’s all going well!\n\nHere are a few quick things from this week:\n\n1. General Conference. It was phenomenal! I have never sat in such hard chairs for such a long period of time but it was so worth it. I think Saturday Afternoon session was my favorite but Sunday afternoon was also really good. I liked that Jorg (?) guy’s talk a lot and Scott, Ballard, Tad R Callister, Bednar, and of course Holland gave excellent talks as well. We also got to watch the General Women’s Meeting which I loved and saw the Priesthood Session too. It was so fun to see a ton of people I recognized/knew in the choir! Also, it was kinda crazy how many people that spoke in conference/the women’s meeting that we had already heard from here at the MTC. It was such an amazing experience watching conference as a missionary because it really made the talks a lot more meaningful and I found lots of new meaning in things. It was also really cool because we had our kyudosha [investigators] watch conference too. I know that they are all men of God and were called by Him to serve as His servants and be instruments in His hands. They truly speak with God’s power and give messages directly for us and everyone across the whole world. I am so thankful for a living prophet and apostles on the earth today and I know that God’s words never cease.\n\n2. The Tuesday devotional this week was by Brent Nielson of the Seventy and it was SO good! He and his wife spoke of how to become better missionaries and better people. It was interesting because he started his talk saying it’s not about us at all and that we need to serve but at the end he said that it’s all about us and we need to go and become. This mission is a time to really lose ourselves and our lives serving others but in doing so really find our self. I am so excited for the next 16 months to give my all to the people of Japan! Also, I gave the closing prayer at the Tuesday Devotional which was pretty exciting but mostly really scary haha. My doryo [companion, Sister Johnson] and I were able to sit on the stand in front of all 2000 missionaries so it was a really neat experience. Also, this guy came up to me beforehand and said he knew Ronald Poelman and Lloyd Poelman from Salt Lake [great uncles, Ronald and Lloyd are brothers] and also knew them when he was doing his MBA at Stanford and living in Palo Alto so that was cool.\n\n3. The Sunday devotional was by Vai Sikahema. You should look him up because he has had a pretty cool life, playing for BYU and also in the NFL. He was seriously hilarious and shared a lot of missionary experiences he’s had throughout his life. Apparently, he gave the same devotional a few years ago at the mtc during conference weekend too because our teacher heard the same devotional which was kind of funny haha.\n\n4. The Japanese/Nihongo is coming slowly but surely. It’s been really frustrating and cool at the same time to see how far we’ve come. I am pretty good at understanding but speaking with good grammar is sometimes a struggle. It really teaches me to rely on my Savior though and Heavenly Father because I know they will provide and are always by my side helping me. We also had Skype TRC last night for the first time! (we weren’t able to do it last week with orientation) We were able to skype a Nihonjin who lived in the Nagoya dendobu/mission area. It was such an awesome experience talking with a Nihonjin and teaching him about prayer. We were only able to teach for 20 minutes though which was a bummer but it was still a really, really cool experience.\n\nHere is a challenge for all of you (Mom, Dad, Jared, Thomas): Read the Book of Mormon starting as soon as you can from cover to cover. And before reading it, have a question you want answered and write it somewhere in the front or back maybe and read it with that question in mind. It’s amazing how many new insights pop out when you read it with real intent and for a specific purpose. It will be fun to hear where you all are in your reading so let me know!\n\nHope all is well with everyone and I am thinking of everyone mainichi [every day]!\n\nAishiteimasu, Poelman Shimai [Love, Sister Poelman]\n\nPictures\n\n1-me w/ Eric’s masterpiece\n\n2-not sure how well you can see it, but the clouds looked so cool last night!\n\n3-I am in love with the fall colors on the mountains\n\n4-Machado Choro is from Brazil and here is his interpretation of “I am a Child of God and He has sent me here with parents kind and deer” 🙂\n\nWeek 6 (e-mail dated October 2, 2014)\n\nKonnichiwa! Minasan wa genki desu ka? [Hi! Everyone, how are you?]\n\nOnly 18 more days until we head out to Nihon! It’s crazy to think since it seems like yesterday our countdown was at 60 something days.. time flies! Also it’s so weird to think that it’s already October.\n\nI see Matthew from time to time here and I saw Cassidy on Sunday which was really fun! It’s nice to see familiar faces from the Foothill ward. 🙂 Peyton also comes soon too which will be exciting! [Matthew, Cassidy, and Peyton are from Ashley’s congregation in San Jose.]\n\nHere are some highlights from the week:\n\n1. KOHAI! [Junior missionaries!] We got 2 new districts in our zone yesterday (Wednesday)! There are 10 in each district and of the 20 new senkyoshi [missionaries], we got 4 new shimaitachi [sisters]. 🙂 They are all so so awesome and it’s so fun to have new people here. One of them is from Perth, Australia which is really cool too! As STLs [Sister Training Leaders], we got to have orientation with them on Wednesday with the ZLs [Zone Leaders] and it was awesome. I am so excited for all of them. Also, idk [I don’t know] if I mentioned this earlier, but a few weeks ago, we also got to do orientation for the missionaries going to Italy/Romania since they didn’t have any missionaries older than them in their zone. So having this calling has been such a blessing and I’ve loved getting to know so many different people here at the mtc!\n\n2. Our Tuesday Devotional was by Gregory Schwitzer of the Seventy and it was fantastic! He talked about commandments and the importance of them. Commandments are truly a blessing and they should never be seen as restrictions because they honestly bless our lives so much. They also help us strengthen our relationship with our Heavenly Father because we can show our love for Him by keeping His commandments. “If ye love me, keep my commandments.” He also pointed something out about the 10 Commandments that I’ve never noticed to help us memorize them: The first 4 have to do with our relationship with our Heavenly Father. The 5th one has to do with our relationship with our parents and 6-10 have to do with our relationship with others. Also, the frequency in which the last 5 occur starts from the bottom and goes up (so from 10-6) if that makes sense. Anyways, it was really really cool and he made some really good observations and comments about the commandments. I am grateful for them because them truly do give my life more freedom, allow me to come closer to my Heavenly Father, and give a sense of direction in my life. (Mom-here’s an analogy that a shimai gave in my class about art: When her art teacher gave an assignment without any rules or guidelines or anything, she had a really really hard time trying to figure out what to do or where to begin and felt all over the place but when the art teacher gave some basic structure or guidelines to the assignment, she found it a lot easier to choose a direction to follow in her art. It’s like commandments. They guide us and help us throughout life and gives us a sense of direction.)\n\n3. Elder Wada (I think?) is the Tokyo South’s mission president’s son who is at the MTC right now and he is going to San Jose on his mission (speaking English)! So look for him in a few weeks!\n\n4. We got our katakana nametags! But we can’t wear them since other people can’t read them. They did my name wrong though.. But don’t worry – we will also be getting new katakana nametags once we get to Kobe and I emailed them the right kana spelling. [Katakana are Japanese phonetic characters used for words borrowed from other languages, and used for the names of non-Japanese persons. Ashley’s last name “Poelman” became five katakana “Po-e-ru-ma-n” on her name tag. When she says her name is “wrong”, she means that the letter ‘e’ in Poelman is not pronounced so she would prefer the katakana read “Po-o-ru-ma-n”.]\n\n5. Funny nihongo from lessons by Johnson Shimai. 🙂 1. “Yuichi-san you are Jesus Christ’s Savior” 2. Instead of “will you pray” she said “will you read this?” 3. Also she almost gave our kyudosha [practice investigator] her ego Morumon Sho [English Book of Mormon] and then was like “oh jk” and our kyudosha said “JK wa nan desu ka/What is jk?” so then we clarified and said “Jodan/Joke” instead. Haha. Overall, our lessons are going really awesome though! Both of our investigators have baptism dates and as of right now, are set to get baptized Oct 11!\n\n6. Pamphlet- There’s this new pamphlet their using in Japan called “What to Expect” to help people get an idea of who the missionaries are and what their purpose is. They just developed a newer version of it and we were the first missionaries at the mtc to be able to see them and we got to practice using them. It was soo weird teaching in English haha.\n\n7. There’s this really cool story called ‘Find Me’ about missionary work and the pre-existence. You should look it up!\n\n8. The other day, we looked watched all of the mormon.org‘s on Nihonjin. They were awesome! You should watch them. I think the youtube channel is mormonjapanese. One of the guys was the one who came up with Ruby which I think Jared and Dad should know since it’s something with computers haha. It’s awesome cause they end with “Soshite, watashi wa Morumon desu.” [And, I am a Mormon.] Haha so now we say that all the time. 🙂\n\nI love all that I am learning and doing here and I can’t imagine a better place to be right now in my life! Of all the places I’ve been and all the places we’ve traveled too, I have to say that one of the happiest places on earth is here in Happy Valley, UT. [“Happy Valley” is a nickname for Utah Valley.] The MTC has such a special spirit here and the Holy Ghost/Seirei is so strong all the time. I love being a missionary!\n\nLove you all and keep me updated on anything exciting or anything in the news! (i.e. I heard there was a volcano in Nagoya area of Japan?) Gotta go but hope all is well!\n\nAishiteru [Love], Poelman Shimai\n\nWeek 5 (Ashley’s e-mail dated September 25, 2014)\n\nKonnichiwa! こんにちは!\n\nThis week was such an awesome week! So many great things happened so I hope I don’t forget to mention anything.\n\nLast Saturday was our hump day/halfway mark at the MTC!! And last Monday was our “only 4 weeks left at the MTC” mark! We are so excited to go to Nihon but are also so sad to leave the MTC.\n\nHighlights of the week:\n\n1. One of the shimai in our zone got pink eye last week and sure enough, I ended up getting it too. I have been having a pretty bad cold and cough for the past few weeks (as does everyone else in the mtc) and so I was just going to tough it out but I had a ton of eye boogers when I woke up Saturday so I decided to go get it checked out just in case. The MTC health clinic is closed on Saturdays so we got to take a van to the BYU Health Center which was really exciting and weird. The doctor that helped me’s son married Welch Kaicho’s [President Welch, the current mission president of the Japan Kobe Mission] daughter so that was a cool coincidence. Anyways, I sure enough had pink eye so I had to get eye drops. Since the clinic at the mtc was closed, we got to take another van to go to the pharmacy at CVS! It was so exciting haha. BYU was also having a football game against Virginia that day so we saw lots of people heading to the stadium. We were so excited to be in the real world and everyone who saw us at cvs got so excited to see missionaries! One person who talked to us thought we were in a Japanese-speaking mission in Provo haha. But yeah, I think my pink eye is better for the most part so you don’t have to worry!\n\n2. On Sunday, I spoke in kyokai [church]! They don’t announce who is speaking until after the sacrament is passed so it’s pretty nerve-wracking. I wasn’t actually that nervous to give my talk though! It was actually pretty fun. I didn’t think I would be speaking since I was sick but oh well. 🙂 I spoke on Morumon Sho [Book of Mormon] and I think it went pretty well!\n\n3. For General Conference, none of the shimaitachi [sister missionaries] will be singing unfortunately. Only some of the elders get to sing since it will be for Priesthood Session. All of us shimaitachi were really bummed but are so excited for the chorotachi [elders]! We have I think 7 or 8 from our zone in the choir.\n\n4. We were able to watch the Ogden Temple Re-dedication on Sunday! One of the buildings in 18M served as an extension of the temple. It was my first time seeing a temple dedication so it was so cool. President Monson spoke as well as Bednar Choro. We got yellow recommends and had white hankerchiefs [Mormons have a tradition of waving white handkerchiefs at temple dedications] and it was subarashii [wonderful]!\n\n5. Otsukasan wa baputesuma o ukemasu!! [Mr. Otsuka will be baptized!!] One of our kyudosha [investigators] is getting baptized on October 11! Johnson Shimai and I were SO excited!! It was such an amazing keikan [experience] to be able to saw the baputesuma ketsui [baptism challenge] to Otsukasan and have him say Hai, Michiron [yes, of course]! He said he wanted to get baptized now! How cool is that. One problem: we have to work on his sake [alcohol] problem.. he is really struggling with Chie no Kotoba no Rippo [Word of Wisdom] but we are trying our best to help him. Also, keiji [inspiration] is real. Johnson Shimai and I were struggling with how to help Otsukasan and what to teach him next. We were just sitting outside talking and going all over the place with how we wanted to approach our next lesson. We then realized we hadn’t said an inori [prayer] yet. So we prayed and sat in silence for a good minute. Johnson Shimai turned to me and said I think we should talk about Sukui no Keikaki (Plan of Salvation). And no joke (jodan ja nai haha) I was thinking the exact same thing. It was crazy. I started laughing because I couldn’t believe it! Kamisama [God] really does help us, all we have to do is simply ask. He gives us personal revelation and knows us individually and knows our kyudosha [investigators] individually. We aren’t going to know everything about them or how to best help them demo watashitachi no Ten no Otoosama wa kanzen desu [but our Father in Heaven is perfect].\n\n6. We heard from M. Russel Ballard for the Tuesday devotional!! It was a phenomenal talk. He didn’t have any notes and said he just wanted to talk to us as a grandpa would give his grandchildren advice. He talked to us on how to be better missionaries and the whole talk was just so good. Everyday we need to get up and do our best! Also, he told us to let our families be on this mission with us so I hope that I can do that throughout my mission. Another cool quote on of our teachers shared was along the lines of- you know you enjoy life fully when your alarm clock is no longer your enemy and is a friend. Kinda cool haha. The choir sang an arrangement of “Joseph Smith’s First Prayer” which was amazing.\n\nThomas-how is dental school??? [Ashley’s brother Thomas left for UCLA on Sep 18] I haven’t heard anything and wanna hear all about it! Also, what’s your new address?\n\nJared-how is your new job?! [Ashley’s brother Jared started a new job Sep 22] What does your new company do? Also what is your address?!\n\nMom-how is school?? [Ashley’s mother is taking classes at San Jose State] are you still making ceramic plates and cups and everything? Does school take up all of your time or are you doing other new house projects?\n\nDad-how is work?? [Terrible] Thank you for your letters-they are always fun to read. Also, thanks for the pictures with Watanabe Choro! I showed them to Watanabe Shimai and she got so excited and took a picture of the pictures haha. It was really fun.\n\nKeep me updated on any other exciting things going on! I miss you all and love you.\n\nSaigo ni akashi o wakachiaitai to omoimasu.

God loves everyone. God wants to help everyone. Like a parent, God also helps me. We have a need to pray. The Spirit of the Lord is really wonderful. I receive guidance through the Holy Ghost. Everyone can receive guidance through the Holy Ghost. I know the Book of Mormon is true. The Book of Mormon is the word of God. The Book of Mormon is evidence of God’s love. The Book of Mormon has every answer. When we read the Book of Mormon, we receive answers from God. As a missionary, I am Jesus Christ’s representative. Through Jesus Christ, I can do difficult things. Thanks to Jesus Christ, we can return to the presence of God. I am grateful for this restored gospel. I know this gospel is really true. This gospel blesses everyone.]\n\nI love this dendo/mission and I haven’t even gotten to the field yet! My Nihongo is not anywhere near kanzen [perfect] or parapara [fluent] but I am trying my very best mainichi [every day]! I have seen so many kiseki(miracles) everyday and I know the Lord is on our side. He is on our team and is rooting for us and will help us if we but ask. The Mitama/Spirit is so strong here and I can feel it so strongly every day and am grateful to have Seirei no tamamono [Gift of the Holy Ghost]. Baputesuma [baptism] is important but really what matters is sukui/salvation. To help them saigo made taeshinobu/endure to the end is so important so they too can live again with Kamisama [God]. He is our Father and is the most powerful being in the universe but still knows us one by one and knows our individual needs. Of all the names he could have been called, he chose to have us called him our Heavenly FATHER. He is closer than we know and will help us anytime or anywhere.\n\nAishiteimasu!\n\nPoelman Shimai\n\nWeek 4 (Ashley’s e-mail dated September 18, 2014)\n\nKonnichiwa!!\n\nYesterday was our 1 month mark so that was exciting! The 22nd is our halfway mark so that’s pretty exciting.\n\nMom and dad – thank you SO so much for the package and letters!! Also for those pictures!! They seriously made my whole week so much better and I was just so excited. I also got a letter from Ecuador from Katie [friend of Ashley] so that was fun! The Buntings [Ashley’s cousins] also mailed me a letter which was so nice of them! I don’t have time to respond to all of the letters but know I got them and am grateful for them and will try to write back next Pday!\n\nSome highlights of the week:\n\n1. Elder Richard G. Scott came and spoke to us on Tuesday at the devotional and it was SO good! We pretty much knew an Apostle was coming because of what the choir director told us on Sunday so we got there extra early for choir practice and were able to be a part of the choir. We sang Be Still, My Soul which was beautiful. This devotional was also broadcast to all of the MTCs around the world so that was pretty cool! As soon as Elder Scott walked into the room, you could immediately feel the Spirit and the power in the room and it was so evident that he is an apostle called by God. He spoke on communicating with God and prayer. We need to remember that even though He has created countless worlds and is so powerful, He is still our father and He is still close to us and knows us personally. He told us about the 3 answers to prayers: 1. peace and comfort 2. unsettled feeling 3. no response. This is a sign that He trusts us to act for ourselves and means that we need to be proactive. This also helps our faith in Him grow. It was an amazing devotional and it was awesome to hear from an Apostle! Speaking of apostles, I am so excited for general conference! (I doubt I will be able to sing in the mtc choir for conference because they choose who is going to be in the choir based on past choir experience and I haven’t done much but that’s ok! I am still excited to watch it in the mtc. I think the talks will have new meaning as a missionary.)\n\n2. We had an amazing lesson with one of our investigators, Yuichi-san last week. We were really struggling with teaching him since he is so stubborn and quiet and doesn’t talk much. He didn’t seem super receptive to our messages and we felt like we weren’t progressing with him. We decided to just have a “heart-to-heart” (kokoro ni kokoro? haha) type lesson with him and just see where he was at, what he felt, and what kind of help he wanted from the missionaries. We didn’t have much prepared going in except that we knew he wanted to help him. It was am amazing lesson! The Seirei [Holy Spirit] was so strong. I think that since I’ve been at the MTC, this was definitely the most amazing and spiritual lesson we’ve had. Afterwards, during one of our breaks, our teacher (who played our investigator) pulled us aside and told us how great our lesson was. He said that he felt Seirei not even as an investigator but as himself, he felt the Spirit in the room. He told us that this is why we were here and lessons like that are why we are here. It was so cool to have that experience and for him to tell us that! It’s amazing what the Spirit does because I can definitely tell you it was not my Nihongo that did that.\n\n3. Cougar tails. Richardson Chorro’s mom sent us a few trays full of cougar tails, which are basically these giant maple donuts from BYU. So so yummy. Not sure if I’ve gained any weight yet but maybe I should weigh myself soon.. Creamery ice cream twice a week and chocolate milk in the morning may not be the best idea… Luckily I’m going to a biking mission!\n\n4. Temple. I love going to the temple twice a week! It is so amazing. Last week we did initiatories [initial temple ordinance] and it was a great experience. Since we finished earlier than those that did a session [a “session” is a temple ordinance that lasts about 2 hours] , we were able to sit and relax on the lawn behind the temple and it was so peaceful. I love the temple and how much of a blessing it is.\n\n5. TRC was so amazing this week! We taught Emi-san again about the Book of Mormon and she said she wanted to share our testimonies with her friends! She is so sweet. I love Nihonjin! She also wrote such a sweet note on our evaluation sheet – I took a picture so you can see it. 🙂\n\nOk well speaking of the temple, we have to go now!\n\nLove you all and miss you!\n\nAishiteimasu!\n\nLove, Poelman Shimai\n\nWeek 3 (Ashley’s e-mail dated September 11, 2014)\n\nKonnichiwa!\n\nTime flies here… We are quickly approaching our halfway mark here at the MTC. On Monday, the senpai [missionaries who finished their training at the MTC] all left to Nihon so it has been pretty lonely without them!\n\nAlso, this week I got a letter from Aunt Christine/The Ballards which was so nice!! Sister Erskine [Ashley’s Zion’s Choir director] also sent me a letter a few weeks ago which was a nice surprise. Lindy [former BYU roommate] also wrote me this week which was so so awesome. And dad, thank you so much for all of your letters!! It’s awesome hearing all of the updates and learning new Nihongo. I used barabara [scattered] in a lesson the other day and I say tokidoki [time to time] all the time so thanks haha. It is always so fun to get mail here at the mtc so thanks everyone for all of the mail!!\n\nOn Tuesday, we had a devotional by Brother and Sister Sitati of the Seventy from Kenya which was so cool. Funny thing was, a rumor started on Sunday that the devotional speaker on Tuesday was going to be an Apostle so everyone was freaking out and got to the devotional suuper early. But I thought it was still an amazing devotional. They told us to remember who we are, remember our divine potential, and remember where we’re going. If we don’t have an end goal in sight, we don’t really have a purpose in life. Also, it’s human nature to naturally walk in circles if we don’t have a point of reference. It’s important to remember that our purpose in life is to have joy and strive to someday return to live again with our Heavenly Father.\n\nWe got a new teacher this week, Watanabe Shimai. And guess what! She is Elder Watanabe’s cousin! [Elder Watanabe is a missionary Ashley knows who recently served in the San Jose Mission.] Didn’t we have a picture with him? If you do, can you please send it to me? Thanks haha, it would be fun to show her. She is so awesome and is such an amazing teacher. It’s nice to have her there since our class is huge.\n\nSpeaking of huge, did I mention that we have another elder in our district?! That means we have 13 total people in our district – 4 shimaitachi and 9 chorotachi. (Also: I realized I have been spelling choro as chorro this whole time.. I think it’s because I just kept thinking of churros. Whoops) Maciado(?) Chorro was in the senpai district in our zone but couldn’t go to Nihon yet because he broke his arm while he was here. He is from Brazil and is super good at Nihongo and is really spiritual. He is now part of a three-some that are our zone leaders. Hopefully he will be able to go to Nihon as soon as his arm is better!\n\nAlso on Monday, all of the Nihonjin [Missionaries at the MTC from Japan] left [to go to their assigned areas] which was really sad. They were so fun to (try to) talk to in the hallway and were the sweetest people ever. We all loved them so much! Especially Kinjo Chorro who always had a fun tucked into his belt. 🙂 [See picture with Elder Kinjo below.]\n\nThis week we talked about Morumon Sho [Book of Mormon] and it’s importance. It really is an amazing book. It’s pretty much a book full of testimonies and testifies of Iesu Kirisuto [Jesus Christ] and has answers to any question we have! It is so simple and easy and I know that if we liken them unto ourselves, our lives will be so much better. A choro in our district compared the Morumon Sho to the Liahona [a divine compass described in the Book of Mormon] and how it is a tool we can use to guide our lives. Watashitachi wa kanzen ja nai kedo Morumon Sho wa kanzen. [A am not perfect but the Book of Mormon is perfect.] Combined with Seirei [Holy Ghost], it is going to be our most powerful dogu/tool in kaishu/conversion. I love being able to study it everyday and learning more and trying to become better mainichi [every day]!\n\nOk well I don’t really know what else to write.. This week was great though. Let me know if you have any questions or anything. Hope everything is great at home and in the ward! I miss you all.\n\nAishiteimasu!! [Love you!!]\n\nPoelman Shimai\n\nWeek 2 [Ashley’s letter dated September 4, 2014]\n\nKonnichiwa!!\n\nCrazy week! I always forget what all has happened but I will try my best to update you.\n\nSo first of all, on Sunday, my doryo [companion] and I were just studying in the classroom and Butler Kaicho [President Butler] comes in and asks us to come out in the hallway to talk. We thought we were in trouble or something haha. But he asked us to be the new Sister Training Leaders! (the girl equivalent of a zone leader kinda) Our senpai [current Training Leader sisters] leave to Nihon this coming Monday so we are now in charge of all of the shimaitachi [sister missionaries] in our zone. We have 10 shimaitachi (not including us) and 2 of them are going to Fukuoka so my doryo and I will be in charge of 8 other shimaitachi. We had to go to all these meetings on Sunday and it was pretty overwhelming but I am so so excited for this new calling. It will be an awesome opportunity to get to know all of the shimaitachi in our zone and I am excited to serve them and help them and love them. Like I said, all of our senpai leave to Nihon next week and so we will be the new senpai! Pretty exciting.\n\nIn Relief Society on Sunday, we heard from Carole M Stephens who is first counselor in the Relief Society General Presidency which was awesome. On Tuesday, we heard from Don R Carke of the Seventy. He was incredible! He talked a lot about inactives and less actives and converts and how to keep them in the fold. We watched the clip from President Hinckley about the 3 things a convert needs: a friend, a responsibility, and nourishment from the word of God. Also, this morning, all of the missionaries going to Nihon got to have a special devotional! It was a guy named Nobuake Irie from Osaka. He is apparently a “famous” singer/songwriter in Nihon. He went to BYU, went on a mission when he was 23, and taught at the MTC. He now teaches at Kyoto University. He gave an awesome taught and had such an amazing conversion story!! His brother also had an amazing conversion story. He had his brother, who was a smoker and kinda crazy guy, come visit him while he was going to school in Provo. He had his brother come listen to the missionaries at the MTC so they could practice their Nihongo with him. At the end of the lesson, the missionaries invited him to pray. Then, they invited him to be baptized! Haha. His brother thought about it and then decided that he would go back to Nihon and take the lessons from the senkyooshi [missionaries] and then decide. He was baptized in Nihon and then went on a mission a year later. So cool. Irie Kyodai [Brother Irie] sang 2 songs for us which was awesome. His voice sounds like a typical Japanese karaoke-type singer hahah but he was really good!\n\nI love my district. They’re really fun and we are all really close! We do spotlights each week and it is really cool to hear and learn about their life and the trials they went through to be where they are now. Also, our new zone leaders are Frish Chorro and Richardson Chorro from our district. Richardson Chorro’s dad used to be the 2nd counselor in the Sunday School General Presidency so we watched a general conference talk from his dad in class which was awesome! His dad is now one of the VPs of BYU [see link]. Also, we got a new chorro in our zone! Hughes Chorro is from Chicago. He is super cool and has a waterpolo scholarship to Princeton which is crazy. We are all really close and eat our meals together and it’s been really fun! My companion Johnson Shimai is awesome too. She is getting better and better at Nihongo and it’s so exciting for me to watch her grow and learn!\n\nRandom fun things from the week: We got to host the new missionaries yesterday! I hosted a girl from my Nihongo class at BYU who is going to Sendai and one of Lindy’s friends [Lindy was a BYU roommate] that stayed with us in Provo but I didn’t see Emily [another BYU roommate] or Julia [a cousin] which was a bummer! I will keep an eye out for them.\n\nThe MTC Choir is amazing. I wish we could go around and more people could hear us because there’s something so amazing about a giant group of senkyooshi singing about the fukuin [gospel]. We are always asking if we’ll get to sing at general conference but they don’t know yet since they haven’t invited us so we’ll see! I really hope we get to though! Also, the other day in the gym, they have these movies going and one of them was from the conference session where the UVU institute choir sang. I noticed that we had the same choir director as them and I also saw Bethany [a cousin, sister of Julia mentioned earlier] a few times which was cool! It’s nice to see a familiar face even when it’s just through a screen haha.\n\nNothing else too exciting happened. We are teaching investigators and the lessons are going really well. We pretty much rely completely on the Seirei [Holy Ghost] and don’t have to prepare things line-by-line anymore which is nice. The Nihongo is coming slowly, but I think it’s coming.\n\nHow is everyone doing?? Has anything crazy or exciting happened in the news?! I hope everything is subarashii [wonderful] and I miss you all! Keep me updated on everything and life back in San Jose. Thank you for all of the letters you have sent!! They make my day and my week!\n\nHere is an awesome video we watched that Ill leave you with: http://www.mormonchannel.org/video/mormon-messages?v=1839005837001\n\nKono kyokai wa shinjitsu desu. Watashi wa Kamisama to Iesu Kirisuto o ai shite imasu. [This church is true. I love God and Jesus Christ.]\n\nLove, Poelman Shimai\n\np.s. Dear Elders are much appreciated. 🙂 The amount of letters the chorrotachi [guy missionaries] get is a little ridiculous so us shimaitachi are needing some ai [love] too haha."
