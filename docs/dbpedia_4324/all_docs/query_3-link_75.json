Our purpose was to clarify the behavioral patterns of Japanese PHNs in response to these conflicts. Methods: Sixty-six PHNs who worked in the health and welfare departments of multicipalities in a prefecture responded to a questionnaire that included forced-choice and open-ended questions. Thirty-three out of 66 described the conflicts they had with other professionals. The data were analyzed using content analysis. Results: PHNs come into conflict with other professionals because of differences in obligations, priorities, approaches, and understandings of their roles. There were five types of response to conflicts: 1) negotiation with the other professional directly, 2) negotiation with the other professional indirectly using other human resources, 3) negotiation aimed at achieving mutual understanding and agreement through meetings, 4) suspending the conflict and providing direct client care without further consultation, and 5) following the direction of the other professional without negotiation. These patterns were further split into two categories: one aimed at solving the conflict and the other avoided solving the conflict, giving priority to providing the clients with continuous care. Conclusions: Japanese PHNs often prefer harmonious resolution of conflicts with other professionals and collaboration to provide continuous community care. Research is needed to identify the effective approaches to resolve different types of conflicts.\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\n�P�DIdentify the five behavioral patterns of Japanese Public Health Nurses (PHNs) in response to conflict with other professionals.\n\n�Q�DRecognize that Japanese PHNs prefer harmonious resolution of conflicts with other professionals.\n\n�R�DDiscuss necessity to develop better systems and approaches to collaboration, including PHNs.\n\nKeywords: Community Collaboration, Ethics\n\nPresenting author's disclosure statement:\n\nNot Answered"
