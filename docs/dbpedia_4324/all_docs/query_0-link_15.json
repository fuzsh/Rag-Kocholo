The definition of each type of university is detailed below, as per the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT):\n\nNational universities, which have been established in all local prefectures as organizations targeting the improvement and well-balanced development of Japanese higher education and academic research, have played important roles as local research centers etc.\n\nPublic universities, which have been established and managed by local public entities or public university corporations, have also played important roles in providing higher education opportunities to local people and as intellectual and cultural centers in the local community.\n\nPrivate universities are institutions of higher education, not operated, owned, or institutionally funded by governments.\n\nZachary Harden, 29 August 2023 [Ed. note; As of 18 February 2024, the number of active universities (along with designation) has changed since the above list was put out by MEXT. This list maybe be incomplete or include universities that have since been merged, renamed or closed entirely.]\n\nNational Universities\n\nDesignated National Universities\n\nIn April 2017, an amendment to the National University Corporation Act enabled the classification of national university corporations as “Designated National University Corporations”, with the stated aims of significantly improving the education and research levels of Japanese universities. As of 2021 a total of 10 national universities have been thus selected by the MEXT.
