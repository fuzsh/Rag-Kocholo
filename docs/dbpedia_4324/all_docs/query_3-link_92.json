        "text": "“Tsukiuta. is a project by the original characters on the theme of 12 months. Please enjoy the story decorated with music and voice!”\n\nSo goes the blurb on the official site for the Tsukiuta. project, a series of CDs about anthropomorphized months that began in 2012. Each CD features mini-dramas and songs written by Vocaloid producers and performed by the male/female seiyuu in charge of the respective months. A TV anime adaptation for Tsukiuta. was greenlit in late 2014 and is scheduled to air sometime this year.\n\nThe male and female versions of Tsukiuta. have different settings – the boys’ is an idol face-off between Six Gravity (December-May) and its rival unit Procellarum (June-November), while the girls are goddess candidates in an alternate world – Fluna (Dec-May) and Seleas (Jun-Nov). The boys have seen a lot more activity with unit CDs, accessories, a comic anthology, events and a spin-off stage play, while the girls’ series is only starting to click into gear: at the recent Valentine’s Day Tsukiuta. Spring Fan Festival 2016~Girl’s Valentine~ event, a 2nd series of solo CD releases and a Girls Live event in June 2016 were announced.\n\nObviously I’m into Tsukiuta. mostly for the music but the drama parts are pretty fun too. I suppose we’ll get more updates on the anime leading up to Anime Japan next month. I somewhat doubt the girls will be in the show beyond cameos/supporting roles; I do think it’d be better for them to stick to showing Six Gravity and Procellarum given that the fanbase is mostly girls.\n\nThe seiyuu cast involved:\n\nSixth Gravity: Kaji Yuki (Shiwasu Kakeru), Toriumi Kosuke (Mutsuki Hajime), Masuda Toshiki (Kisaragi Koi), Maeno Tomoaki (Yayoi Haru), Hosoya Yoshimasa (Uzuki Arata), KENN (Satsuki Aoi)\n\nProcellarum: Aoi Shota (Minazuki Rui), Hatano Wataru (Fuzuki Kai), Kakihara Tetsuya (Hazuki Yo), Kondo Takashi (Nagatsuki Yoru), Ono Kensho (Kannazuki Iku), Kimura Ryohei (Shimotsuki Shun)\n\nFluna: Kanemoto Hisako (Hijiri Kurisu), Imai Asami (Hanazono Yuki), MAKO (Kisaragi Ai), Okubo Rumi (Momosaki Hina), Nonaka Ai (Togawa Chisa), Uchiyama Yumi (Wakaba Yuki)\n\nSeleas: Satou Rina (Terase Yuno), Ishigami Shizuka (Himegawa Mizuki), Otsubo Yuka (Motomiya Matsuri), Fukuhara Kaori (Asagiri Akane), Kurosawa Tomoyo (Ichisaki Reina), Uesaka Sumire (Tendoin Tsubaki)\n\nThe Vocaloid producers involved: Yuyoyuppe, UtataP, ChouchouP, Hitoshizuku x Yama△, Nem, Yuuyu, Nijihara Peperon, Machigerita, John, takamatt, Kikuo, TsukinoP and Satsuki ga Tenkomori.\n\nPreceding the girls’ individual CD releases and event, the two groups got together for the first time to record mini-dramas for the Fluna and Seleas best of CDs that are out on March 11. Animate.tv interviewed both girl groups.\n\nFluna\n\nQ: This is the first album where the girls get together as a group for the drama portion – tell us your thoughts about the new recordings.\n\nKanemoto Hisako: It’s a drama that’s a lot of fun with all of us gathered together and making so much noise. Kurisu is a hyper girl so I hope I can show the difference in excitement levels between her and the other girls in an interesting way.\n\nImai Asami: I was glad to see how Yuki becomes a lot softer when in the company of girls. She’s serious and seems to have been a very stiff person since birth so it fills me with warmth to see her behaving more like her 18 years of age.\n\nMAKO: All the characters are so pure and earnest and diligent in their work and I became a fan of all of them as we progressed through recording. This is a drama CD that captures the hearts of these (goddesses).\n\nOkubo Rumi: We’ve been recording on our own all this time so it was refreshing to have a chance to engage in conversation with Yayoi (Haru), who’s my counterpart in charge of the month of March! It was fun to get a feel for the other characters’ as well as a glimpse of their daily lives. It looks like the world of the female characters is going to expand rapidly, so please look forward to their activities!\n\nNonaka Ai: It’s the first time that we’re getting involved with the other girls and I had a lot of fun voicing the character! You’ll get to find out more about Chisa-chan as a character; things like her position (in the group) and her personality. I’m glad that I got to learn about the other female characters in more detail as well.\n\nUchiyama Yumi: I hadn’t had a single chance to meet with any of the other characters ‘til today’s recording and I can honestly say it was so much fun. I feel like it was a wonderful chance to be able to see a lot of different sides to Wakaba that have not been apparent until now.\n\nQ: Please leave a message for the fans.\n\nKanemoto: As always, I had fun voicing the role. I hope that you will show much love to these uniquely different goddesses. Please also look forward to when the characters for all 12 months get together, and what is in store for them in the future.\n\nImai: ‘Finally, the goddess series is taking a step forward!’ is what was going through my mind and I’m feeling glad about it. Please continue supporting Tsukiuta., Fluna and Hanazono Yuki in the future!\n\nMAKO: As we were recording the drama CD I started to think, “Perhaps there are still many of the goddesses’ charms that are hidden deep within them…?”. I hope that you will look forward to their growth through their activities in the future. My brother (Kisaragi Koi) is also working really hard so please support him too.\n\nOkubo: It’s the first time the girls’ groups are gathering for a drama CD so there were a lot of new aspects; I’m sure everyone who listens will find it enjoyable! I believe there will be various activities to come in the future so please support Tsukiuta.. I too, will do my best to bring joy to everyone!\n\nNonaka: I’m in charge of April! A ‘rabbit’ followed by a ‘river’, ‘thousand’ followed by ‘sakura’ flowers – that’s how you write Togawa Chisa’s name! Please show your support from now on!!!\n\nUchiyama: This was the first time I get to voice a Wakaba who interacts with the other characters and holds conversations with Chisa-chan – it was harmonious and very enjoyable! It may have been our first recording together as a group, but the cast is made up of such wonderful people.\n\nI was able to act out my character in a very peaceful mood from start to finish and I hope that such an atmosphere is reflected, in a good way, in the drama as well. I would be grateful if you would take a listen (to the CD).\n\nSeleas\n\nQ: This is the first album where the girls get together as a group for the drama portion – tell us your thoughts about the new recordings.\n\nSatou Rina: I’m very happy that the members of Seleas were able to record together. It was a lively, colourful recording studio where I could enjoy the playfulness and adorability of my partner Mizuki, as well as the refreshing nature of the dialogue with each of the other characters~ ♪\n\nIshigami Shizuka: It was really fun to have all 6 of us interacting with each other! I was able to learn about what kind of personalities of the 5 girls apart from Mizuki-chan had. All of them were so unique and cute; if there is such a school in existence I would like to enrol now! (laughs) The partner to my July girl is June’s Yuno-chan, and I was glad to have plenty of interactions with her.\n\nOtsubo Yuka: The first recording involving all the Seleas members was very lively and a lot of fun! Above all, I am happy to get another chance to voice my beloved Matsuri-chan. I want all of you fans to hear the Seleas girls’ rich boke-tsukkomi drama as soon as possible.\n\nFukuhara Kaori: We have been recording the songs and dramas alone all this while, so it was really fun and refreshing to be able to engage and act with the other (girls)! I was excited during recording, thinking ‘Ah, so this is how it is when the Seleas members all get together ♪’.\n\nKurosawa Tomoyo: It was a lot of fun and over in the blink of an eye. We got to interact with each other during recording so there were quite a lot of ad-libs flying around.\n\nThat’s why I think you’ll enjoy this work. Lots of people picked up on the ad-libs so I’m filled with hope that we’ll be able to get together and record again sometime.\n\nUesaka Sumire: ‘A noisy girls’ talk session!’ something close to, but not exactly like that…?\n\nIt was fun to get a peek at the wonderful daily lives of the quirky goddess candidates.\n\nWith 6 people it was already so lively – if the 12 goddesses were to gather together it might turn into a chaotic situation!\n\nQ: Please leave a message for the fans.\n\nSatou: As always, thank you for the support! We’re finally bringing to you a long hoped-for drama CD~!! I have this dream where someday, the boys’ and girls’ teams will get together to record ♪Please support Tsukiuta. in the future!!\n\nIshigami: Thanks to all your support, the Seleas team is able to bring to you the release of its best album Hoshitsuki! Thank you so very much!! This freshly-recorded drama CD is a must-listen so please get your hands on it. I’d be grateful if you could take good care of the Seleas girls!\n\nOtsubo: I am happy to be able to record this long-awaited new drama featuring Seleas. It’s made possible thanks to the support of the passionate fans of Tsukiuta.! Thank you!! Please enjoy the interactions between Matsuri-chan and the quirky Seleas members!\n\nFukuhara: All of you Tsukiuta. fans are always very kind and really cherish the series; that makes me so happy and spurs me on to work harder. Please cheer on Akane-chan in the future as well!!\n\nKurosawa: I’m really happy that we’re finally able to deliver a drama CD of the Goddesses Team (of the 2nd half of the year) to all of you. It’d be great if the fun atmosphere (that we had) could be conveyed to you through this CD. Look forward to it~~\n\nUesaka: I hope that you enjoy the many sides of the goddesses – how wonderful and cute they are, but also how they can sometimes cause explosions within explosions. If you wish to be healed, if you wish to be cheered up, we goddesses will always be by your side…\n\nCheck out the trailer above for the Fluna & Seleas discs (trailer for the guys here).\n\nPt.2. Read translation of Pt.1 here.\n\nKikuko-neechan ruins a grand occasion!?\n\nQ: What were your school-friends’ reactions to the news of your début?\n\nHonoka: People around me were surprised. But they did give me a lot of words of encouragement, like “Do your best” or “I’ll be cheering you on”.\n\nQ: We hear that you have taken voice lessons before – have you had any chances to sing at your school’s cultural festivals or anything similar?\n\nH: I have. During the cultural festival in my 3rd year of high school, I sang on stage on the 1st and 2nd days – the 2nd day stages were open to the public so parents etc. were allowed to come and visit. My mother came as well, and some of my male classmates went up to her and asked “Can I have your autograph?” which made other people wonder, “Er, is this person a celebrity or something?”. It made me think, “Ah, it’s me who’s supposed to be singing on stage today but mom is the one stealing the audience’s attention instead”….\n\nQ: Is that jealousy? (laughs)\n\nH: Yes it’s jealousy!\n\nKikuko: Oh no~ I’m so sorry~ (laughs).\n\nQ: It’s quite remarkable though, that you would think “my mom is stealing the audience’s attention!” instead of “isn’t my mom amazing!?”\n\nH: Really? But I’ll probably never be like my mother. You could never be the same as someone close to you, I think. So for the fans (of my mom), you’ll probably be disappointed….\n\nK: You always say that, don’t you? It makes me feel a little sorry for you….\n\nH: From my point of view, you are my mom whom I’m really proud of. You’re cute, you have a great personality and you’re so gentle – people can’t help but notice you. You’re considerate of your fans, and you’re always firm with things like greetings.\n\nK: Noo stop ittt! Ahh, so embarrassing. I’m not like that at all~.\n\nH: As for me – my voice, my face, my looks – everything is different from my mom…\n\nQ: I do think that both of you are quite similar though. The two of you do make me think, “Ah, they’re mother-and-daughter after all”.\n\nK: You think so too, right!?\n\nH: I’m happy to have been able to make my début, but I do worry about disappointing people who are thinking “I thought she’d be a bit more of a gentle person like (Kikuko)-Oneechan”…\n\nQ: It can’t be helped – Oneechan’s fans have been hearing her on stage, talking about you for 17 years after all. Thanks to that we all feel like we’re like your neighbourhood uncles. We may be deeply moved, thinking “Hocchan has been raised so well,”, it probably never occurs to us to think “She’s not like Onee-chan at all”.\n\nK: You’re all so kind.\n\nH: Also, I’m not good with my words yet. ‘Sparkling’ or ‘fluffy’ is all I know.\n\nK: On the other hand I think that’s quite typical of kids these days, I find the kanji mistakes they make to be amusing. Just the other day, when discussing her future she confused ‘socchoku’ (frankly) with ‘chokkaku’ (right angle) and ‘suichoku’ (vertical). She makes such amazing mistakes sometimes that I can’t help but laugh. But I guess it’s my fault that it’s become like this – when my daughter first started learning words, I would find the little mistakes she made to be so cute~.\n\nQ: We’ve heard a lot of stories about Hocchan; you’ve ended up relating quite a few disastrous anecdotes thinking that ‘it’s interesting so it’s okay’.\n\nH: Are you going to continue talking about Hocchan from now on? If so, I’ll tell stories about you too, mom. Your fans will be delighted to hear them, won’t they!?\n\nQ: That could become a series of surefire jokes for you. So let’s hear it in your first ever interview, #1 in your ‘Stories About my Mom’ series.\n\nH: Once upon a time, my mom brought me along in her car to a newly-opened local department store. After making her purchases, she started to drive home but got lost, suddenly burst into tears and said to me “Hocchan, why don’t you recognize the way home!?”\n\nK: I had no idea where I was and kept going around in circles and got sad, thinking that we might never ever make it home.\n\nH: It’s not like she even asked me to ‘please try to remember the route’ or anything like that, I had to wonder why she said all that to me, while there were tears in her eyes.\n\nK: From my point of view it was as if ‘we can’t go home because Hocchan didn’t bother to memorize the roads!’. I don’t even know the reasoning behind that (laughs).\n\nMom breaking out in a sweat when her daughter shines\n\nQ: How are you planning on guiding her in the future?\n\nK: It would normally take a couple of years for somebody to début but since her mother is doing this kind of work, she has gotten her chance already. As a parent I feel thankful, but also truly apologetic to the rest of society.\n\nHence, I believe that is imperative to repay this good faith through meticulously practising the basics of acting and never forgetting to put in the hard work. I’d like for her to not get carried away, to always work at things honestly. I’m not hoping for her to burst on to the scene and make a huge splash; instead, I think it would be better for her to start out with small roles, build upon that and grow, little by little.\n\nQ: It’s normally quite tough to even gain junior affiliation with Office Anemone, isn’t it?\n\nK: The offer for Taiko no Tatsujin only came thanks to another Anemone junior Ishiguro Chihiro. She spoke to one of the Taiko no Tatsujin staff and introduced Hocchan to him.\n\nThus it’s truly because of Chihiro-chan that (Honoka) was able to début – Anemone is a small agency and I do want to repay everyone who has shown faith in (us). Everyone treats my daughter like their little sister and has helped to train her up. They’re always teaching her lots about acting practice as well. Ah~, (I’m) so blessed.\n\nQ: She has so many older sisters at the agency, plus she’s also surrounded by loads of neighbourhood uncles.\n\nK: Ahahaa! That’s why I have to return all these kind deeds or else karma will hit me.\n\nQ: Honoka made her début at age of 17 and you have now taken part in a 17 vs 17 interview – what are your impressions of it all?\n\nK: I have nothing but gratitude. It’ll be a lifetime memory. I’ve been saying that I’m 17 for a long time now so I was wondering how I could use that long-time joke in relation to my daughter. We’ve been given wonderful opportunities; she’s been able to make her singing début and take part in this commemorative interview – it’s like a dream come true.\n\nH: It’s because mom has been saying that she’s 17 that I’ve been able to début at 17, plus there’s Chihiro-chan who helped introduced me as well as the fact that the fans have helped to get my mother where she is today – thanks to all of these factors, I could make my début. I can’t say that my début came about as a result of my own powers, so what I have left is honest gratitude.\n\nK: You know that well, don’t you (laughs).\n\nH: Still, I do have a sense of pride in the corner of my mind so I want to let loose soon. I want to change my brain-\n\nK: You’re like Anpanman. Do you want to swap your head out?\n\nH: No.\n\nK: ………….\n\nH: What I mean is that I want to take that pride out of my head and change it all to ‘effort’.\n\nQ: What are your plans for the future?\n\nK: Actually, her seiyuu début has already been confirmed – she’ll be in the ‘Shimajiro and the Picture Book Country’ movie that hits cinemas on March 11. This was made possible by the fact that I also did Shimajiro 20+ years ago and the director said to me ‘Let your daughter’s début be in Shimajiro’.\n\nThe final decision was made after listening to her voice sample, and she just recently completed recording for a character called ‘White Phosphorus 2’! It’s a realllly interesting story so I hope that many children and of course adults, will enjoy watching it!!\n\nH: I grew up watching Shimajiro myself so it was great fun, and a dream come true to actually appear in the movie. I’m just living a normal life but I realize I’ve had such great luck. I’m too blessed.\n\nQ: But, such happiness did not last for very long…\n\nH: What, no way~~~~!\n\nK: Yeah that’s true. Things do not always go the way you want them to (laughs).\n\nQ: Now that you’re finally taking steps towards becoming a seiyuu, how do you feel about your senior seiyuu Inoue Kikuko-san?\n\nH: Since I made the decision to pursue acting properly, I do once again realize just how amazing my mother is.\n\nK: No no, I’m not amazing at all but I do think that I’m surprisingly strict when I’m giving acting lessons~. Isn’t it strange!?\n\nH: You may be strict but I don’t find you that scary.\n\nK: Eh~, I did my best to be strict though~…\n\nQ: Ah, you had to go and say that… so what is it that you find amazing about your mom?\n\nH: She works on anime, foreign dubs and games, provides narration work as well as appears on stage shows like for Sakura Wars – when it comes to the ‘voice’, she has so many weapons in her arsenal.\n\nK: Nooo~just stop, don’t say anymooore~~~! It’s so embarrassing sitting here listening to that! Stopppppp~~~!\n\nH: I can only wonder just how much effort she has put in to get to this point; she’s normally so stoic at home so (her acting) is really amazing to me.\n\nK: I can’t take it any more! This is so so so embarrassing ! Stop it stop ittttt~~~!!\n\nQ: How about you, how do you feel about the daughter you raised?\n\nK: Hmm, let’s see. It seems that she has a lot to talk about every day, mountain-loads of stuff in fact. She’s always slept by my side since she was young and even when I’d drifted off to sleep she’d go “Listen mom, listen!” and talk about everything that went on at school that day. Even when I was tired and fast asleep she’d say “Don’t go to sleep mom!”, use her fingers to pry my eyelids open and tell me lots about “so-and-so” doing “something-or-the-other”. Bringing her up, I truly felt just how interesting children are.\n\nTo be honest, I don’t know what the future will bring – she’s already been undergoing voice training for as long as I can recall, and is in possession of a voluptuous voice that I’m jealous of. She’s got the stamina to sing for hours on end and has a strong passion for music; I do hope that she’ll keep putting in good, hard work so that she can have a long-lasting career.\n\nQ: Last of all, please leave a message for your fans.\n\nK: To all of you who have always been supporting me, thank you. My daughter is making her début now and is the same age as I am – it makes my heart beat faster! Still, the first thing I want to say is this: “Sorry!”.\n\nSomehow I am filled with this sense of ‘contrition towards society’. Though it seems interesting to have a mother-and-daughter pair where both are 17, I wonder if it’s really okay to be doing this? Even as I’m thinking that, I have a shameless request – both mother and daughter will be working hard to bring smiles to as many people as possible in the future, so please continue to support us for many years to come!\n\nH: There are so many people who love my mother, so I want to apologize for using her as a springboard. Just the other day, I received a very delightful letter. It went something like, “I’ve been a fan of Kikuko-san forever; now that you have made your début, it feels like I have found the reason that I followed her for so long”; so maybe there will be many of these people who’ll come over to my side instead-\n\nK: …Eh, what should I do. Isn’t that being rather shameless? Hang on a minute, can we redo this? (laughs)\n\nH: I’m sorry! I’m just so mouthy, but I swear that I’m a full-fledged adult – I do understand that there are people cheering me on so I’m sincerely grateful! I don’t think they have become my fans as yet but I’m going to send out lots of sparkly beams in the future so please bathe in their light.\n\nK: Eh, what do you mean?\n\nH: Mom, I want your fans to be filled with pride, thinking “We’ve know all about this kid since she was a tiny tot. She’s really amazing” – I want to become such an ultra-amazing person so please watch over me until that happens. I’m gonna send out all these sparkling beams—\n\nK: You just wanted to mention sparkling beams somewhere, didn’t you (laughs)\n\nH: B-but! I just want to send out sparkling beams so guys! Get ready to receive them. People who get hit by the sparkling beams will make me extra sparkly too – that’s like killing two birds with one stone.\n\nK: I haven’t a clue what you’re talking about (laughs)\n\nH: Honoka will become a happy person and then send out her happiness to all of her fans – that’s killing two birds with one stone!\n\nK: Okay then. I’m sorry!\n\nName: Furukawa Toshio (古川 登志夫)\n\nDoB: 16 July 1946\n\nHometown: Tochigi\n\nWife: Kakinuma Shiho\n\nAgency: Aoni Pro\n\nSNS: Twitter, Personal site\n\nFurukawa Toshio is a legend of the seiyuu industry. If you’ve been watching anime long enough you will need no introduction to his work – Piccolo in Dragon Ball, Portgas D. Ace in One Piece, Kai Shiden in Mobile Suit Gundam, Shinohara Asuma in Patlabor, Ataru in Urusei Yatsura.\n\nRecently, he started doing a radio show with fellow child actress-turned-seiyuu Hirano Fumi, called Furukawa Toshio & Hirano Fumi’s Legend Night. This series of interviews is related to the programme. The interviewer is the writer Fujii Seido.\n\n#1: We were the first generation to call ourselves ‘seiyuu’\n\nQ: To start off, tell us how you first came across this profession of an ‘anime seiyuu’.\n\nA: I got my start in acting when I joined a child theatre company. I was initially hoping to get into the entertainment industry and become a tarento, something like that…I was around 11 then.\n\nAt that point I was mainly doing dramas; when I was old enough, I decided that I wanted to take up acting full-time and set up my own theatre company during my college days. Some time later I joined another acting group led by a famous seiyuu (Nakata Koji-san) and that was the reason I started pursuing the voice acting route.\n\nSo I wasn’t actually aiming to become a seiyuu from the start. I do think that most people in my age group were quite similar to me.\n\nQ: Yes, most other seiyuu of your generation didn’t start off aiming to become seiyuu either.\n\nA: I would think that it applies to most, if not all.\n\nGenda Tessho-san was in Baraza (a troupe led by Nozawa Nachi) and I got the impression that most of the people who joined the group would end up doing voice work.\n\nIt would depend on the individual, but there were people whose ‘core business’ was acting but didn’t make enough money that way, so they got into voice-acting with the intention of treating it as a “part-time job”.\n\nThere were some of our prominent seniors who would get mad if you called them ‘seiyuu’ too.\n\nQ: So acting was their day job, and voice work was just a side attraction.\n\nA: Maybe you could say I was just like all the others.\n\nLots of people start out acting as part of a theatre company, move on to doing dramas, and then branch out into voice work.\n\nQ: When did you begin thinking that “Hey, I’m now a seiyuu”?\n\nA: It never really occurred to me since I had only doing anime and foreign dub work on a one-off basis. To me it felt more like an offshoot of acting work.\n\nHowever, when I began working on regular series with shows like the anime Magne Robo Gakeen (1976) and the foreign drama CHiPs (1977), both in which I was voicing the hero, I started to refer to myself as a ‘seiyuu’.\n\nAt the time, Kamiya Akira-san said “There are some of our seniors who may get angry at this, but since we mainly do voice-related work – about 90% of our work, in fact…isn’t it fine for us to call ourselves ‘seiyuu’?”\n\nWe were the first generation who accepted ourselves as being ‘seiyuu’.\n\n#2: Why Furukawa Toshio takes on so many different challenges\n\nQ: You have acted in a lot of different shows – over the course of your career, which one of those would you say is publicly acknowledged as being a national treasure?\n\nA: That would probably be Urusei Yatsura (1981). I’d been doing quite a few lead roles up to that point but the one that people remember me most for would be this particular work.\n\nThe TV series went on for four-and-a-half years and there were films as well; as a long-running show, you could say that it’s the closest to being what I’d consider a ‘signature role’.\n\nQ: Did you ever feel like it was a show that was like a ‘national treasure’ while you were doing it though?\n\nA: I was just absorbed in my work at the time (laughs). But I did start to get a lot more fan letters and chocolate on Valentine’s Day so I was kind of aware that things were starting to change. I suppose you could think of (Urusei Yatsura) as the show where (I) accepted my identity as a seiyuu.\n\nAt the time, I had hoped to work on such (nationally recognized) shows as soon as possible – Urusei Yatsura turned out to be the first. That was followed by Dragon Ball with Piccolo and more recently, One Piece’s (Portgas D) Ace.\n\nThey may not be leading roles but they’re characters that are widely recognized, so I’m lucky in that sense.\n\nQ: The amazing thing about Furukawa-san is that you can voice characters in such popular anime but at the same time devote much energy to doing other things. For example, you set up your own theatre company. How is it possible?\n\nA: At one point, as I was growing up from my days in the child theatre company through to adulthood, I had thought about trying to become a stage actor. It’s somewhat related to my current job as a seiyuu but at the same time, I thought of it as being my ‘starting point’. The setting up acting plans, or the essence of role creation – those were things that were drilled into me through the theatre. That too, is the reason why I continue to do theatre work today.\n\nQ: Continuing to do theatre work also means that you’ll never forget the starting point of your seiyuu career.\n\nA: There is no such thing as a one-sided piece of paper – it will most certainly have a front and a back. It means that you don’t necessarily have to trade-off between two things; rather, they are both inseparable parts of who you are.\n\nI do think it was the stage that influenced me to always be conscious of things such as my personal performances. I could watch something and say, “it’s a performance that has that little something extra*”, but at the back of my mind I would always be thinking ‘What would it be like if it was Furukawa Toshio doing the role instead?’. As there are many skilled people around, it is a necessity to bring in all the qualities that are unique to Furukawa Toshio.\n\nIf 10 out of 10 people have the same acting plan, it would be boring. It’s okay to be different.\n\n*the original term used here is +α (plus alpha)\n\nQ: On top of that, you were in a band (Slapstick was formed in 1978 & also featured Nojima Akio & Furuya Tohru) and so on. Was that a comedy band or something? (laughs)\n\nA: Saying that might make my bandmate Furuya Tohru react angrily & say “We were a rock band”, but the rest of us still think of Slapstick as a comedy band (laughs).\n\nIt wasn’t as if we were thinking of becoming musicians or anything like that…back then, once you won the leading role on a show, you’d start off by working on its radio programme and then record and release the theme song and ending song, participate in events – lots of different work would be generated from there.\n\nThe formation of the band was just another one of those related activities – it’s not like we planned the whole thing ourselves. At the time, singers started to get into voice work as well and you can see that we’ve continued that slide into the current era of mixed media (works). It was all a natural course of events (laughs).\n\nQ: But the band lasted quite a long time. About 10 years?\n\nA: I enjoyed the band activities. Of course it was fun being solo, but there are things you can only do when you’re in a band.\n\nWe’d do things together – even stuff like waking up at the same time. I feel like I had formed very strong bonds with this group of buddies. The experiences of those days have proved useful even now, as well as forming fond memories.\n\n#3: I shudder to think of what I would’ve become had I not walked down the seiyuu path\n\nQ: I’m a little hesitant to ask this but I’ll go ahead anyway – what difficulties or troubles have you faced as a seiyuu?\n\nA: Actually, I’ve never faced anything that I would consider as such. Halfway through, I did start to think of this as a ‘calling’ for me. However, when I look back at the times when I was a child actor & appearing in dramas and I see myself wearing that wig on TV, I just think, “that’s horrifying” (laughs).\n\nThere are certain types of heads that just don’t look good with wigs on them. Putting a wig on a potato won’t make it look like a samurai. I did a lot of other things back then but when I look at the other child actors of my age, for example Hirano Fumi-san who appeared in ‘Fly away! Youth’ (1972) – I could never match up to them.\n\nQ: Nah, that isn’t true at all (laughs).\n\nA: Also, actors would be tied up in a single piece of work for days on end and we just couldn’t make ends meet. If it started raining all we could do was to sit there and wait for it to stop.\n\nOn the other hand, voice work can be carried out in all seasons, whether it’s raining or snowing. Add to that the fact you only need to spend a few hours in the studio and you’re done, so you can schedule a couple of jobs on the same day. Once I started doing seiyuu work on a full-time basis, I saw my income increasing dramatically (laughs).\n\nThus, I started to believe (that I could make a career out of voice work) which led to my founding of a theatre company, where most of the audience members were anime fans. I would never have been able to start the company up if I wasn’t a seiyuu. That’s why I can honestly say that there hasn’t been anything I’ve found troubling ever since I became a seiyuu.\n\nIn fact, I’ll venture that I would’ve been miserable if I had not become a seiyuu.\n\nQ: Conversely, what is the most fun experience you’ve had as a seiyuu?\n\nA: Just being able to do a variety of roles. It’s something I truly enjoy. After all, I can play many non-human role; from fish to aliens.\n\nFirst of all, even a potato-faced guy like me can voice an ikemen. Nobody gets offended when I voice somebody like Ace from ONE PIECE (laughs). When you’re an actor, the range of roles you get will inevitably be limited by your visual appearance.\n\nBut when you’re a seiyuu you can voice the archetypal Romeo and above all, you can still voice 20-year olds even at my age. In fact, most of my work now involves voicing young characters.\n\nOn the other hand I haven’t done as many older roles as I would’ve liked to and it doesn’t seem like that situation will change any time soon, so I might never get to fulfil that wish.\n\nQ: Now that you mention it, I’d never actually heard Furukawa-san doing an old man’s role.\n\nA: Villains, transvestites, perverts, suave guys, comedians – I’ve done a lot of those but for some reason, very few old men.\n\nI guess it’s because there are veterans like Nagai Ichiro-san and Yanami Joji-san at my agency so even though I’m at a good age (for older roles), I’ll still be asked to take on younger roles instead.\n\nSo of late, I’ve wanted to do older roles…but having said that, I was recently asked to voice the role of a several-hundred year old man in Ushio and Tora (laughs). I’m having fun with that right now.\n\nQ: I think it’s wonderful that you want to expand your range even at your age. Do you have anything to say to today’s generation of young seiyuu?\n\nA: To tell the truth, I have no real, frank advice to offer. I actually think the young people these days are doing rather well.\n\nI’ve observed through recordings, how the advancement of recording equipment has resulted in changes in acting theory so I can’t be too critical of the performances of the younger kids.\n\nRather, I feel that my generation has the opportunity to learn from them. If there’s only one thing for me to say however, it would be that it’s pointless for one to think that just because it’s acting, that you’re a genius for merely being able to keep up.\n\nThis is what I’d say if the question was put to me. You need to have a basic grasp of acting theory; a performance that doesn’t have an acting plan at its root is useless. You can’t just say “I’ll just wing it like this”.\n\nQ: In other words, you can’t be just going through the motions with the dialogue – you’ve got to infuse your own qualities into the role.\n\nA: Our prominent seniors like Takiguchi Junpei-san and Yamada Yasuo-san; they all had their own unique way of expressing themselves. You could never hope to imitate them.\n\nThat’s why people couldn’t help but attempt to impersonate their voices. It’d be really amazing if they could get anywhere close though.\n\nAfter all, there is no other narrator in the world like Takiguchi-san. He’s like the Egg of Columbus.\n\nQ: Didn’t people have any bad feelings (towards him) at all back then?\n\nA: There might have been. But I think that there were people amused by it as well.\n\nQ: The famous announcer Nakanishi Ryo who did shows like Japan’s Melodies, amongst other things, was also well-known for his unique narration. He’d do things like switch up the positions of the punctuation in the manuscripts he had been given, and that gave birth to his peculiar style. When a colleague asked him why he did that, (Nakanishi) reportedly replied, “‘cos it’d be boring if I sounded the same as everyone else”.\n\nA: When I first received an offer to do narration work, I thought that I might as well do it in my own unique way. And I ended up getting out of control during certain parts (laughs).\n\nQ: But as a seiyuu, you’d definitely want people to be able to recognize your voice by hearing a single word you say.\n\nA: Hence, when I’m working on TV infomercials and requests are made for me to scream beyond my limits, I begin to think that there is no sense in doing such things. There is definitely a limit to what I’d say is the ‘comfort zone’ for my voice – anything beyond that and it wouldn’t sound like me at all.\n\nObviously I’d still do it since it’s a job, but inwardly I’d be thinking ‘I shouldn’t be doing this – they should be getting Chiba-chan [Chiba Shigeru] in instead’ (laughs).\n\nI’d also like to ask them ‘Why did you even bother to use me?’\n\nQ: Well, you could also blame the writer (laughs).\n\nName: Yuki Kana (優木 かな)\n\nDoB: 10 March 19xx\n\nHometown: Kanagawa\n\nAgency: Vims\n\nSNS: Blog\n\nI got to learn of Kanashi around 2014 through Ai Tenchi Muyo and as part of Kneesocks for Blade Dance. She hasn’t done too much since then anime-wise so I kind of forgot about her until a couple of months ago when I started picking up some of her shows – FgG radio with Komatsu Mikako (they both voice characters in the upcoming Shinobi Nightmare) and the Youtube show PhanKill-sensei where both programmes are related to Fuji&gumi Games.\n\nYeap, Kanashi is quite the gamer and accordingly, most of her activities have been game-related. Most recently, she’s been reunited with her Kneesocks colleague Ishigami Shizuka for the yet-to-be-released Shadowverse, which has an ongoing radio show too. Personality-wise she is a bit of a boke but she’s also a good talker, which is why she’s been doing quite a lot of web radio & TV. She has pretty nice assets too (which Mikakoshi is quite jealous of w).\n\nDa Vinci’s interview with Kanashi was 2014, around the time of Blade Dance.\n\nQ: So let’s talk about why you wanted to become a seiyuu.\n\nA: Yeah! To be honest I don’t really remember the ‘one’ reason, but I do know that I wrote ‘I want to be a seiyuu’ in my elementary school yearbook. When I was a child I was a bit of a little demon – when people praised me I’d respond with things like “Nope I’m nothing like that!!”; I was that kind of sassy kid. The type that would be cute in 2D but annoying in 3D (laughs). For some reason though, I was happy when people praised my voice and received such compliments gratefully. Maybe that was what made me think about becoming a seiyuu. I did like anime at the time as well.\n\nQ: And after you graduated from elementary school…\n\nA: I got into junior high and that was when I evolved into a full-fledged otaku. My friends and I would zealously discuss our favourite shows, and I’d draw art (of them). When I think about it now, I was an unabashed otaku then (laughs).\n\nQ: How about when you entered high school…?\n\nA: My otakuness got worse. This time, I was obsessed with games. I’d go to game centres after school and play until it was dark outside. And that was on a daily basis.\n\nQ: Everyday!?\n\nA: Yeah. I kept a diary in those days so I could keep track of how often I went. And it turned out that I’d gone to the game centre 500 days in a row (laughs). That included the times where I just stopped by for a while, but I went on New Year’s Eve, New Year’s Day, Christmas as well. I’d mostly play the music games in my local game centre. Oh, I did study properly too too, if you’re curious about that (laughs).\n\nQ: So the game centre was like your ‘backyard’?\n\nA: Yeah! You’d treat your favourite hangout spots like they were your own home and I became really friendly with the uncle working at the game centre, it was truly a second home for me.\n\nQ: So how did you get on the path to becoming a seiyuu after that?\n\nA: Let me see. Even as I was dashing down the otaku path, I did have it in mind to try to become a seiyuu once I’d graduated from high school. However, I had once tried out for an audition for those wanting to become singers or seiyuu and was told by one of the judges on the committee that “it is impossible for you to become a seiyuu”. My singing was praised; I had received voice training and sung before and I was already in half a mind to give up on becoming a seiyuu. After some time, I came to the realization that I had yet to put in the effort needed to achieve my dream of becoming a seiyuu. With the thought that I would only give up once I had studied properly and found out whether I truly possessed no talent, I enrolled in and started attending Nichinare.\n\nQ: What was your first job as a seiyuu?\n\nA: It was for a certain game. I didn’t need to audition for the role so I was filled with nothing but surprise when I found out I had been chosen. When I got home, I looked at an illustration of the character and finally realized, “I’m gonna voice this girl”, and my heart was filled with joy. The tears just started flowing as I thought, “I really am a seiyuu”.\n\nQ: Seirei Tsukai no Blade Dance represents your first regular acting role in a TV anime. Can you tell us more about your character Rinslet Laurenfrost?\n\nA: Rinslet appears to be quite the haughty princess but in truth, is also a caring, kind girl. None of the Kneesocks members will accept it, but I do think she resembles me a little. Stuff like how she can’t be honest with herself. She was the character I loved most when I read the original novel, as well as being the only role I auditioned for.\n\nQ: Why won’t the other members accept that? (laughs)\n\nA: Apparently, the other members believe that the only thing I share in common with Rinslet is that we both “have long hair” (laughs).\n\nQ: You must’ve been happy to pass the audition, having placed all your bets on the role of Rinslet.\n\nA: Yeah. It was the first ever role I had been chosen for through audition so I was really happy when I got the news. To be honest, there was a point in time where I had been failing audition after audition and was worrying about whether I should quit the business. So when my manager informed me about passing the audition, I had no idea what he was talking about (laughs). But I was in the train on the way home, and ended up crying. Ah, I’m always crying aren’t I (laughs).\n\nQ: Yeah (laughs). But you always try to hide it when you’re crying, don’t you (laughs).\n\nA: It’s embarrassing to be crying tears of joy in public after all (laughs). But when I’m being scolded I cry immediately, even in front of my manager (laughs). Just recently he had to tell me “Don’t cry~” (laughs).\n\nQ: By the way, which of Kneesocks’ songs is your favourite?\n\nA: That would have to be our first recording Shukusai no Elementaria, which I’m strongly attached to. It was the first time we had to practise dancing together and the first song we performed in public. My heart still skips a beat when I recall the excitement I felt when I first learned that I had been chosen for the role.\n\nQ: Do you have any favourite lyrics?\n\nA: When it comes to favourite lyrics, there is one phrase in the ending theme Seirei Blade Dance that I particularly like. The part that goes “‘I will keep on believing’ as I ready my strengthened arrow of ice”. Rinslet-chan has another name, “The Ice Demon Rinslet”. I had been going through my own troubles but thanks to meeting Rinslet-chan, I gained resolve and vowed not to lose my way and to keep going down this seiyuu road. When I sing these lyrics, I realize just how important of an encounter it was.\n\nQ: Next up, let’s talk about Yuki Kana.\n\nA: So, is it okay if we talk about mahjong?\n\nQ: Mahjong! When did you first start playing mahjong?\n\nA: I started thanks to my chancing upon a certain mahjong anime. I didn’t know much about mahjong before that but it was really cool to hear some of the terminology like “Riichi!”. ‘I have no idea what that means! But it sounds cool!’ It really tickled my chuu2 heart (laughs). ‘I want to try saying “Riichi!” too!’ (laughs). I went on to download an online mahjong game and despite not knowing the rules I tried my hand at it, picking it up over the course of 3 months. One of my acquaintances is a pro female player and when she let me handle her mahjong tiles for real, I got addicted to it immediately and ended up buying a cheap mahjong set for myself (laughs). I often play ‘one-man mahjong’ in my room (laughs).\n\nQ: Mahjong is a game as well.\n\nA: So it is. I think I basically love games. At one point I was addicted to online games, I’d play a variety of things like Fantasy Earth: Zero, Phantasy Star Online 2 and Red Stone. When my real-life friends would invite me out, saying “Shall we go for a meal now?”, I’d reply “Sorry, my guildmates are waiting for me…” (laughs). My friends scolded me, “You’re an idiot” (laughs).\n\nQ: What games have you been obsessed with lately?\n\nA: Recently, some of my acquaintances formed a table games club. It’s a club where they play cards and UNO, or any other analog games. At first there were 2-3 members but it’s expanded to about 30 people now. On days off we’ll say, ‘let’s get together and play games!’ (laughs). A huge group of us gathered the other day in a certain park to play ‘outdoors Werewolf’ from mid-morning ‘til the last train! We spread out a vinyl sheet on the ground (laughs). Werewolf is a table “talk” RPG so hearing my senior seiyuu acquaintances putting on voices while they played the game was great (laughs).\n\nQ: By the way, are there any seiyuu whom you admire?\n\nA: Yes, there are a lot. First of all, my agency senior Horie Yui-san. I respect her not only as a seiyuu but as a person too. Also, Hayami Saori. I just love Hayami-san’s personality and her acting. Apart from that, my former teacher Sawaki Ikuya-san. He was my instructor during my 2 years in training school and the person who opened up my career path for me. If it wasn’t for Sawaki-san, I would not be here today. I’d be happy if even a little bit of Sawaki-san’s acting could be heard in my own performances.\n\nQ: Which of Sawaki-san’s lessons do you hold most dear in your heart?\n\nA: He would keep saying ‘you have no charms’. Even if your performances are adequate, you have to keep showing your charms at every moment in order to impress people. People can only get hooked through such things, so it is pointless if you can’t get them to fall in love with you. And after 2 years, I finally received words of praise from him. I was so happy that I cried.\n\nQ: Lastly, please tell us what kind of seiyuu you want to become in the future.\n\nA: Through Rinslet, I feel that I was able to take my first step as a seiyuu. In the future, I would love to take on a variety of roles and challenge a number of genres. My lifelong dream is to have no regrets at the end of my life. Even if it’s a struggle right now, I will continue to do what I think I should do so that someday, I can see that my efforts have paid off. Though an individual act may seem fruitless, each one of those experiences has helped make me who I am today; I want to become a person who can say ‘I’ve lived a good life because of what I went through’. Also, you could say that this is a more realistic dream, but I want to hold a solo event (laughs)!\n\nWhether it is a handshake meet or an autograph session, I would love to have a chance to speak to everyone who has supported me. I want to be able to experience more of this feeling; that ‘Today, I am here, because all of you are here’. I will work harder so that I can have an opportunity to express that.\n\nName: Inoue Kikuko (井上 喜久子), Inoue Honoka (井上 ほの花)\n\nAge: 17 (oi! oi!), 17 (real)\n\nBirthday: 25th September, 9th February\n\nAgency: Office Anemone\n\nInoue Honoka generated a bit of buzz last year when she made her singing début under the name HONOKA for the Taiko no Tatsujin game, mostly for the fact that she was revealed as being the daughter of Inoue Kikuko. Her mother’s profile is certainly helping her get a leg up the corporate ladder but I hope that she will be like Han Megumi, who is making her way in the industry based on her own merits.\n\nAnimate has an interview with the mother-daughter duo.\n\nThe first & last interview between the two when they’re both 17\n\nThe Inoue mother-and-daughter pair; both at the age of 17 right now!\n\nKikuko: Inoue Kikuko, 17 years old!\n\nAll: Oi, oi!\n\nHonoka: Inoue Honoka, 17 years old!\n\nQ: Young..so young!\n\nK: Hahaha!\n\nQ: Now that you’re starting to appear in public, do you realize the convenience of having a ready-made joke for when you do your greetings?\n\nH: Yes I do. Thanks to my mother always saying that she is 17 years old I was able to make my debut at 17 as well; it’s amazing joke material to have.\n\nK: Joke!? I’ve been reduced to a joke (laughs).\n\nQ: Prior to your début, what did you actually make of that ‘I’m 17 years old!’ joke?\n\nH: I was thinking, “Mom’s cute!”.\n\nQ: When did you start being conscious of the fact that ‘mom’ wasn’t just ‘mom’, but that she was ‘the seiyuu, Inoue Kikuko’?\n\nH: My perspective has never changed. She’s the same at home after all. The Inoue Kikuko that the fans see is the mom that I see at home.\n\nQ: So you don’t feel that uncomfortable about hearing your mom’s voice coming out of the TV?\n\nH: I don’t really feel uncomfortable when I hear her voicing motherly types or characters like Belldandy & Amatsu Kanata from Girlfriend (Kari) but when it comes to types like Lobelia from Sakura Wars or Grace from Macross F I just go “Woahh….”.\n\nK: Now that you mention it, you came to watch the Sakura Wars musical when you were a little girl and exclaimed “That’s not mommy~!!” with a look of great sadness on your face. It was only when you were in high school that you started to think “Lobelia’s cool!”. It seems girls go through many changes as they grow up.\n\nQ: Does the Kikuko at home use such scary voices?\n\nH: Nope.\n\nK: Whoops.\n\nQ: That means you’ve only ever heard your mom’s scary voice through the TV?\n\nH: Yeah, I guess I’ve never heard her use it otherwise.\n\nK: I see~. I think I’m the type who ends up crying instead of angry. Like, “Ohhh~, Hocchan! (cries)”.\n\nH: So when I don’t study even when I’ve been warned to, she’ll go “Why won’t you do it!? (cries)” instead of “Why aren’t you doin’ it!? (anger)”.\n\nQ: So you only see that side of her through her roles. I can see why you were indeed scared to have seen her play Lobelia when you were a child.\n\nK: It seems that she was rather shocked.\n\nH: She wore things like chains on her arms as well. I was in such shock that I felt sick and you had to accompany me home. That was at the Budokan live for Sakura Wars. Do you remember that?\n\nK: Eh, really?\n\nH: Our house is quite far away so you had to call a taxi and we went home together. Sometime later, there was an after-party I went to that we had to travel to Tokyo for.\n\nK: Ah, you’re right. That happened.\n\nQ: We hear that you’re good at doing imitations.\n\nH: Yes, I can do them! I imitate a lot of different characters, such as Crayon Shin-chan.\n\nQ: Let’s hear it then.\n\nH: “Hey hey, sis~~~~ I’m Nohara Shinnosuke~. My beat is heartingg~~!”\n\nQ: That’s pretty good (laughs)\n\nK: Really!? I’m glad! Also, I’m trying to practise a ‘one-man Love Live!’ act at the moment. It’s really low quality though. Would you like to hear it?\n\nH: Hmm, why don’t you just do Nishikino Maki? Since you voice her mom anyway. “What do you mean, I don’t understand!”\n\nQ: Yeah that sounds similar.\n\nH: It does, doesn’t it?\n\nK: I’m kinda sorry. I’m really practising all the other members as well. They don’t sound alike at all but would you like to hear it?\n\nH: It’s okay, go ahead!\n\nK: Okay, so let’s try Honoka-chan. “Fight on!”…ah, I did it after all (laughs).\n\nQ: Can’t you imitate your mom?\n\nH: It wouldn’t sound similar even if I tried. Because our voices are different in tone. (tries) “Shimajiro, it’s snack time”…See?\n\nQ: The quality of voice is different but I think the two of you do share similarities in terms of mood and speech habits.\n\nK: When we’re at the karaoke she goes all out in terms of power. Me – I’m on the weak side.\n\nH: The way we bring out our voices is totally different. My mother has a crystal clear voice. Doesn’t hearing it heal you?\n\nK: No, there’s no such thing! Geez really, I’m so sorry! It’s no good for parents and children to keep complimenting each other, isn’t it?\n\nH: But I think that if you keep listening to my voice you’ll think it’s annoying. My mother’s voice is something that you can listen to forever.\n\nK: No, no, no, no! This is one of those answers that sounds too good to be true, did you guys set this up behind the scenes!? Ahhh~ I’m so embarrassed!!\n\nQ: Is there anything else you’re good at? We hear you also write lyrics and compose your own songs.\n\nH: Yes! I do write lyrics quite often. As for composing, there are times when the tunes flow and times when they don’t.\n\nQ: You will be entering music college this spring and begin going down the road of a full-fledged musician. Kikuko-san has released many albums of original songs – how do you feel about Kikuko-san’s songs?\n\nH: Style-wise, I feel we’re very different.\n\nK: My daughter made a song recently about the feelings of a dog that’s being kept by the health authorities. The lyrics showed a sense of social awareness.\n\nH: My mother’s songs are just what you would expect to hear from Inoue Kikuko, aren’t they? I’m the total opposite.\n\nQ: What sort of music do you like to listen to?\n\nH: Mostly Western music. I’m totally in love with Ariana Grande!\n\nQ: Have you listened to (Ariana), Kikuko-san?\n\nK: I have, but I don’t get it at all (laughs). But it’s true that she’s always singing English songs. Her pronunciation is good as well, which I find strange since she’s my daughter.\n\nH: I really love Mizuki Nana too! I also read her autobiography Shin’ai and her wonderful personality comes across really well; you can tell just how much effort she’s put in – I can truly empathize with that.\n\nQ: Have you met (Nana) yet?\n\nH: No, not yet! I’ve gone to watch her lives before but I’ve always had school the following mornings so I had to hurry home once the live was over.\n\nK: I talk about my daughter quite often so Nana-chan has been saying “I’d love to meet Hocchan!” all the time but somehow, the timing is never right.\n\nH: I also often listen to anisong as well as idol-type songs. I like stuff like Morning Musume. or Hello Pro too! I feel inspired when I see girls of my age working so hard, it makes me want to cheer them on.\n\nK: It’s strange to see her grinning to herself while watching Hello Pro videos (laughs).\n\nQ: Do you dance?\n\nH: I did ballet back in elementary school and was also in the dance club in junior high, but I haven’t danced since then. Not for many years.\n\nQ: How did you decide upon the stage names Inoue Honoka and HONOKA?\n\nH: I’d always liked the Disney Channel and foreign dramas since I was young so I developed an admiration for foreign things. Because of this admiration, I had always wished to use the English spelling of my name HONOKA as my stage name if I were ever to début. When you’re in elementary school you’re always trying to design your own signature, aren’t you? I would always write mine in English.\n\nQ: Will you be separating your activities from now on – HONOKA for your singing activities and Inoue Honoka otherwise?\n\nH: I’m still not quite sure about that yet (laughs). I am an Inoue after all so I thought I’d just use ‘Inoue Honoka’ but my singing voice is quite powerful and somehow, ‘Inoue Honoka’ doesn’t really fit. I was hesitating over what to do but since I received a work offer for music first, (I) decided to go with HONOKA to start with. But I’ll probably go with ‘Inoue Honoka’ for voice acting work.\n\nQ: You want to do voice work as well?\n\nH: Yes I do.\n\nQ: So you want to do voice work as “Inoue Honoka”?\n\nH: Yes!\n\nQ: Using ‘Inoue’ – that means the fact that you’re “Inoue Kikuko’s daughter” will follow you around forever. Do you not mind people viewing you that way?\n\nH: If ultimately, people can stop raising objections ‘because I’m Inoue Kikuko’s daughter’ then that would be great. The truth is that I am using her as a springboard right now…\n\nK: You’re using me as a springboard!? What do you mean!?\n\nH: I’m sorry (laughs). But hey, it’s because of you that I’ve been given a chance. Still, my personality, voice and singing are totally different from my mother’s so I hope people will get to know the real me in the end.\n\nRealizing the dream of the 17-year old mother-and-daughter pair working together on (her) début song!\n\nQ: What type of activities would you like to be involved with in the future?\n\nH: It’s a little embarrassing but I always wanted to be a real magician since I was young. When I told my mother she would always say to me “Your smile is what magic is”. I even thought about writing ‘I want to be a magician’ in my junior high yearbook, but people would definitely think I was a chuu2 if I did that.\n\nSo I thought about bringing happiness to people all around the world by singing my favourite songs and through my smile – maybe I could be a magician too through such activities. That’s why I want to travel abroad and meet people from various countries and let them know lots and lots about anime; to be able to do that, I want to become a seiyuu.\n\nQ: Kikuko-san is always wishing for ‘world peace’ as well – so mother and daughter do think alike after all.\n\nK: All I do is pray for world peace but my daughter is taking a more practical approach.\n\nH: Like the story about the dog at the health authorities, I wish to spread specific messages through my songs to raise awareness of, and aid in certain issues. I’d like to go out into the world and teach music. It’d be great if my songs and my smile could bring happiness to everyone. That’s why I’m always smiling while showing all my teeth.\n\nK: Ah, I understand the feeling of wanting to smile with your teeth and gums out (laughs).\n\nQ: When you attend music college starting spring, what do you wish to learn?\n\nH: Lyric-writing and composing classes are a must. I want to tell stories to other through my own words and music, so I have to learn to write and compose by myself. Also musicals, and I want to take dance as well.\n\nK: It’s a music college but there are ballet and musical classes; it looks like you can freely choose from a variety of courses. Seems like it’ll be fun.\n\nH: Also, I want to learn English properly. I probably won’t take proper tests or anything, I just want to be able to speak the language well.\n\nQ: How about instruments?\n\nH: I started playing piano when I was about 4 and still play now, but I don’t think I’m that good at it. I’m still just a bud. Like a flower that won’t bloom.\n\nK: Hahaha! That turn of phrase is interesting~!\n\nH: But if I wanted to compose my own songs I’d have to know proper chords and so on. I also tried out guitar for 2-3 years but got frustrated, so I think I’ll have to set my mind to it. I want to master at least 1 instrument properly.\n\nQ: Like the castanet?\n\nH: Yeah I’d probably be great at the castanet! Or the maracas. Mom, you’re good at the tambourine aren’t you?\n\nK: Yes, the tambourine (laughs)\n\nQ: You made your début with the song Koi Genso (Love Fantasy) for the Taiko no Tatsujin game. Isn’t it a rather difficult song? Don’t you think so too, Kikuko-san?\n\nK: Yeah, I was surprised. It’s a reaaally nice song and I thought at first “(She) can’t sing this~!”. It was hard~.\n\nH: The lyrics and the song’s mood had me thinking “Eh, am I good enough for this!? Is it alright for me to sing such a cute song!?” at first. But having listened to my own voice and found out that the song was written especially for me, I was a little embarrassed but really grateful.\n\nK: The director had a chat with (Honoka) and asked her lots of things like “What sort of songs do you like to sing?” and then came up with the song; seeing that, as a parent, brought tears of joy to my eyes.\n\nH: Actually, at the time, my mother was also in the studio for recording. After hearing her sing I wondered whether it’d be better to have her sing instead of me. My mother’s voice has ‘colour’, doesn’t it? When I listened to my own singing, I heard no colour in it.\n\nK: That’s fine because you’ll find it in the future.\n\nH: Also, this is something that’s being revealed for the first time – the ‘ru-ru-ru♪’ harmonies in the song are sung by my mother.\n\nQ: Ah, so the 17-year old mother-daughter combo has already worked together. What did you think about the finished song?\n\nK: I was there for her recording and when I heard my daughter sing I began thinking “Ah, she should do it like this instead!” but I didn’t want to be one of those stage moms moaning at the side and I said apologetically to the director “Ahhhh I don’t want to say this….but~!”. But I think the result is really beautiful and I am both thankful and inspired.\n\nH: I’d like to show people the live version as soon as possible. I am confident that this song will definitely ‘sound amazing in the flesh!’.\n\nK: Did you just say ‘amazing’!?\n\nH: I am confident that I will get that across. I think I’ll be able to bring out my ‘colour’, just like mom does when she sings. During recordings, I was singing it in a straightforward manner. From now on I want to sing with passion and be like mom, being able to bring out my own ‘colour’.\n\n—————————————————————————————\n\nTo be continued in part.2 when it comes along…\n\nI used to do this kind of crystal ball post (please excuse the chuu2ness) back in the day – it seemed easier to predict 10 years ago because, rather ironically, there wasn’t so much media and industry info available back then so all I could do was to try to analyze casting trends.\n\nI’d always used the ‘2/3-cours after’ thing (refer below) to spot potential stars – it was a very apparent trend/pattern to me even 10 years ago so yeah, I suppose everyone else noticed it too and it’s not something new or surprising…\n\nHowever, nowadays there are a lot more parties that have interest in, and influence over seiyuu castings that it’s kind of a crapshoot to predict first-time breakout stars especially with those idol tie-ups/gorioshi happening all the time – at best, what people can do now is to predict which seiyuu will ‘consolidate’ their success and turn it into a longer-term thing where they’re still steadily doing voice work into their 30s.\n\nHere, I will translate three articles featuring an anime magazine writer (A), an anime site editor (B) and an anisong insider (C) looking back at the trending seiyuu of 2015, and predicting the next big things for 2016. I read the first one way back when it was published, but only decided to translate now because we have the results to go with their predictions. There’re some pretty crude comments in there, you’ve been warned.\n\nFirst is the article written at the start of 2015. Not that every time they say ‘this year’, it’s referring to 2015.\n\nThe important period for a seiyuu is the 2nd cour after their first hit\n\nQ: In 2014, we had Uchida Maaya, who did a gravure shoot for Weekly Young Jump as well as Amamiya Sora who got a lot of buzz for her looks – you could say both of them were breakout stars for the year. What’s the outlook for 2015 like?\n\nA: Hard to say. No matter what we say, seiyuu fans would be like “No way!”.\n\nQ: You don’t have to bother about what the fans say. Just talk about it from the viewpoint of an industry insider.\n\nA: Okay then (laughs).\n\nB: In that case, how about Taneda Risa. If this was baseball, she’d have racked up 10 wins already.\n\nC: Her first heroine role was in 2012’s Shin Sekai Yori, and it was for 3 cours. Last year she was in the 2-cour Strike the Blood and 2 cours following that, she started getting popular doing anime work and this year, has been much sought-after. Her growth as an actor has been the most apparent.\n\nB: She was in countless things in 2014. The goddess of fortune was shining upon her. If she repeats that this year you could say she’s made it.\n\nC: It could be Yoshimura Haruka. She’s one of the pillars of Idolmaster Cinderella Girls and on top of that, she did SHIROBAKO and Sora no Method this year. She’s definitely in a good position since the Idolmaster Cinderella Girls anime starts next January. Now will be the time for auditioning for the shows starting in April and July so it’ll be interesting to see how many regular roles she can snag.\n\nA: Seiyuu who’ve had a hit anime will get audition offers coming in so what’s important is the 2-cours that follow that good role they got. It’s easy to see that I’m [Ent] pushed Yoshimura hard in 2014. Auditions, events, CDs; she got all of them, what’s left is to see whether she can sustain it next year.\n\nC: Since we’re talking about agencies, how about the force that is Horipro?\n\nYou can tell a seiyuu’s agency by looking at their face\n\nB: So that’d be Tadokoro Azusa. We did an article on her back in 2011 when she won the Grand Prix in Horipro’s Seiyuu Idol Audition and if I’m being honest, there were other people at the audition who sang and acted better than she did. Yet, she’s got that something where you just look at her & it gets you thinking “I wanna support her”.\n\nA: She’s well received by the industry people as well. Someone like Nakamura Eriko’s taking good care of her and even calls her ‘Koroazu’. Her face totally changes once she’s got make up on too (laughs). In that sense I’ve got high hopes for her. What’s best is that she can sing.\n\nB: Her singing is outstanding. She made her artist début in July last year and before her live concert that May she’d already done about 100 lives so she had thorough preparation. If she can get an OP/ED theme tie-up to one of her shows than she could potentially blow up. How about Terui Haruka? When I interviewed her I was impressed by how ambitious she was.\n\nC: That girl really ‘feels’ like Aoni [Pro]. Also she’s got big boobs.\n\nA: Yeah she looks like an Aoni girl. Plain but cute. I wonder why Aoni doesn’t take in flashy, cute girls. But yeah her boobs are big.\n\nB: It could be scary ‘cos Aoni really puts big effort into their juniors. You don’t see too much of someone like Ito Kanae these days after all. It used to be that every show had Ito Kanae in it. Same for Sugar [note: Sato Satomi] too.\n\nA: They push ‘em when they’re young, then leave it to them when they’ve made it. That’s why they get fewer jobs from that point onwards.\n\nQ: So for juniors, who do you think is showing signs of breaking out this year – the potential ‘Rookie Award Candidates’, so to say?\n\nThe Rookie Award Candidates – Lining up those who are well received by the industry\n\nC: Vims’ Hashimoto Chinami might take flight this year. She landed her first regular role in last summer’s Saikin, Imoto no Yousu ga Chotto Okasshindaga, and has been doing some other anime and a radio with Yoshimura Haruka. She’s got momentum.\n\nA: I’d say Ozawa Ari is looking good to be I’m’s next big ‘it’ girl. She had Gekkan Shojo Nozaki-kun in summer 2014 and staff will be thinking ‘let’s get her in to audition’. That’s why she hasn’t got much going on for this autumn or winter but starting next spring, she’ll be coming on strong.\n\nB: Kurosawa Tomoyo too. She’s not from seiyuu school, she’s a child actor. Since she’s used to having to deal with the adults, she’s good at handling herself and has gotten a good reception from the industry. Plus she looks cute.\n\nA: In terms of good industry reception, there’s Aoki Ruriko as well. She’ll give a wave even at small events. Staff love her too.\n\nC: It’s a natural gift to be liked by other people. If we’re talking about those with unusual beginnings, then there’s someone like Fujii Yukiyo who used to do stage lighting. It’s been 1-2 years since she converted into a voice actor and she’s been getting good roles. She’s still a junior but as she’s in Aoni, she might get a real push.\n\nB: Maybe Tanezaki Atsumi too. She did stuff like Karashi in Houzuki no Reitetsu last year. Her acting’s great. You can’t tell that she’s actually so young but she’s still not too well-known; if she gets the right roles then she could go far.\n\nThese 3 will be the male seiyuu to look out for\n\nQ: Finally, how about the male seiyuu?\n\nA: The guys are harder since they basically tend to use the same people over and over. That’s why you’ve only got someone like Matsuoka Yoshitsugu of late. Maybe also Hanae Natsuki. He had Aldnoah Zero and Tokyo Ghoul last year. Both shows have sequels this year.\n\nB: For me it’ll be Aoi Shota. He may be 27 but I think he’ll get a break. He’s originally a musician so it’s a given thing, but he can really sing. He did most of the guide vocals for UtaPri as well. He may be an ikemen but his persona is the scary, unpopular type. That’s the reason he’s grabbing many female fans. I think people can cheer him on with confidence. I just watched his live the other day and his fans were going “Shota, look at me~~” and he’s like an idol that way.\n\nC: I’ll say Murase Ayumu. He was the lead in Gatchaman Crowds and followed it up with Haikyuu!! so he’s in the midst of breaking out. He’s getting a load of roles lately. Also, Saito Soma who’s also in Haikyuu!! He’s 81[produce]’s next big thing.\n\n——————————————————————————————-\n\nSecondly, the follow-up article published on 30 Dec 2015 talking about the outcome of their predictions.\n\nThe unexpected big success of M.A.O\n\nQ: So this was the New Year 2015 project that surprisingly gained a lot of feedback. First of all, let’s look back at the year for the seiyuu industry including the predictions that were made initially.\n\nA: I’ve nothing to reflect upon about my previous forecasts. As expected, Ozawa Ari appeared in an increasing number of shows in 2015. Taneda Risa was in Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso and continued that 10+ baseball match winning run. B also hit the target with his prediction about Kurosawa Tomoyo.\n\nB: Yeah, she was the lead in Hibike! Euphonium after all.\n\nC: It’s a plus point for Kurosawa that she’s in college now, which makes it easier for her to work. Looks like she’ll be getting more jobs in the future. I think I got it right with Murase Ayumu and Saito Soma for the guys.\n\nA: On the other hand we had the unexpectedly prolific M.A.O [Ichimichi Mao]. According to this sheet she had more than 30 shows so that makes her the number one seiyuu in terms of the number of performances. I got the impression that her name would always be there if you looked at the staff credits roll.\n\nC: As the number of shows you work on increases you get to appear at events and stuff like that as well, so that means you can make money as a seiyuu.\n\nB: You make more from event performance fees than you do from working on anime episodes after all.\n\nQ: It’s a rare success case for a tarento-turned-seiyuu. Why do you think she earned so much work?\n\nA: Isn’t this what those seiyuu otaku are always deludedly talking about – the pillow business thing? (laughs)\n\nC: Totally not the case here. She’s the type who rushes home at the speed of light when the after-parties are done. Instead, her manager will be the one sitting there forever, drinking (bitter laugh). It seems she doesn’t really talk to her female co-stars either. She’s getting more work because her acting is great and she’s found favour with the sound directors.\n\nWill this year finally be Tadokoro Azusa’s year?\n\nQ: On the other hand Amamiya Sora didn’t manage to sustain (her success) following the high expectations of her.\n\nA: They pushed TrySail hard so her solo work took a bit of a back seat. I wonder if they’re trying to sell both as a ‘combo deal’.\n\nB: For TrySail, I’ve got the impression that the balance of sales between the 3 members is quite bad. There’s a huge difference between Amamiya and Asakura Momo + Natsukawa Shiina in terms of popularity.\n\nC: But M-san who’s in charge here will definitely turn up at Asakura Momo events (laughs).\n\nA: I mentioned Tadokoro Azusa as a potential breakout star last year, and for 2016 she’s singing the ending theme for Kyoto Animation’s Musaigen no Phantom World plus she’s appearing as mascot characters in anime so it looks like she might make it this year instead.\n\nC: Terui Haruka’s in a bit of a lull. Though she’s working quite a lot.\n\nB: Terui’s a bit similar to Kanetomo [Note: Kaneda Tomoko] and when you do events or radio there’s got to be a bit of a trade-off with the other performers, which makes it kind of hard to utilize her. She did actually do a radio show with Suwa Ayaka – Suwa herself is a natural airhead but Terui was even more of an airhead so Suwa quite sadly lost her flavour in the process (laughs).\n\nQ: Looking at the overall picture, and using last year as an example – it’s quite difficult to understand exactly what type of seiyuu sells.\n\nB: This year [2015], there weren’t many seiyuu who you’d see as a batter who could hit a home run with just one shot – instead, there were a lot of average hitters. Going by numbers alone, the I’m Enterprise (girls) Hayami Saori, Hikasa Yoko, Sakura Ayane and Ozawa Ari performed strongly.\n\nC: For dubbing, 81produce did well. On the other hand, Aoni Production was quiet.\n\nA: Perhaps they’re readying a curveball right now. Aoni’s training school Aoni Juku is crazily tough. Even getting through to Junior is a huge task. Lead roles aren’t something that come along later in life.\n\nC: I get the impression that they’re always late in coming though. (laughs)\n\n——————————————————————————————-\n\nPart 3 – predictions for 2016.\n\n2016 predictions: Female Seiyuu\n\nQ: Your predictions for 2016’s breakout seiyuu?\n\nA: I have someone that I have absolute confidence in. So you two go ahead first.\n\nC: I’ll go with Hanamori Yumiri. She’s an 18-year old signed to Swallow formerly known as Pony Canyon Artists and she’s starring in Garasu no Hana to Kowasu Sekai that hits cinemas in 2016. She’ll be in UnHappy which starts in January*. Also, Ueda Reina. She’s the lead in January’s* Bakuon!!. She’s a real nice girl and the type who’s loved by both her fellow actors as well as staff. In 81produce, she’s close in age to the Wake Up Girls! and i ☆Ris and I think the agency will give her the big push this year. She was also in the news recently for that crowdfunded project** that hit 2 million yen when it’s target amount was 600,000 yen.\n\n*note = both will actually air in April 2016 instead.\n\n**Idol Recollection, a project to get a themesong for a mobage recorded\n\nB: I think highly of Ueda too. My prediction though, is Hondo Kaede. She’s I’m Enterprise’s big hope. Her baby-faced visuals are something that would be well-received by the otaku. If we talk about this in terms of horse racing… using a rather outdated example, but she’d be Fuji Kiseki.\n\nQ: Maybe she should retire early then (laughs).\n\nB: No no, what I mean is that she’s the most amazing of her generation. Apart from Hondo there’s Kouno Marika from the seiyuu unit Earphones. Mausu Promotion’s putting a bit of effort into her. She shines brightly at events. In terms of horse racing she’d be Twin Turbo.\n\nQ: The one that never seems to win?\n\nC: She’s popular but doesn’t appear in anime that much, instead she has a lot of events.\n\nA: Finally it’s my turn. I have total confidence in my pick. Cast-iron confidence. If this was baseball then this person would play as huge a role as Akiyama Shogo of Seibu [Lions].\n\nQ: Ah, the Akiyama who set a record with 216 hits in a single season. That’s some confidence you have.\n\nA: My pick is Takahashi Rie! Definitely. She’s on the verge of her big break. She was in 3 shows in summer ’15 – Gakkou Gurashi, Ranpo Kitan & Sore ga Seiyuu! and she won all of those through auditions. What’s more, they were all different types of roles. She’ll grow even more as she continues to work with veterans. She’s the leadoff batter for 81[produce].\n\nC: It’s true that her agency is pushing her super hard.\n\nA: Apart from Takahashi I’d say Asai Ayaka. Her agency* isn’t that strong but I’ve this image that her foundations are solid. In baseball, she’d be Yokohama’s Kuramoto Toshihiko.\n\n*Seinenza Film Broadcasting\n\nQ: We can stop it with the baseball comparisons now.\n\n2016 predictions: Male Seiyuu\n\nB: Work for male seiyuu is increasing thanks to the emergence of social games. Stuff like Ensemble Stars! and Idolmaster Side M. There’s this new generation of male seiyuu who appear in nothing but social games and get popular off them – they’re called the ‘Socia-ge Generation’.\n\nC: For the new generation, in the lead would be Uchida Yuuma, who had the main role in the TV anime Classroom☆Crisis. He’s the younger brother of Uchida Maaya and he’s well taken care of by the people around him too. Probably will be the biggest breakout star of 2016. There’s also Chiba Shoya. He does the voice for the leader of the most popular unit High x Joker in Side M and he’ll be voicing the lead male role in 2016 anime ALL OUT!!.\n\nB: It’s hard to predict the guys. If I said Ume-chan [Umehara Yuichiro] people would complain “But he’s already made it big.\n\nQ: That’s okay. You don’t have to bother about those kinds of otaku who only know how to point out other people’s faults (laughs).\n\nA: I’ll say Shirai Yusuke, who was in Binan Koukou Chikyuu Bouei-bu LOVE! alongside Umehara. He’s the type who’s a bit dirty…or should I say, helps to make events livelier. He’s the least famous one in Boueibu so if they want to push him they’ve got to do it now.\n\n——————————————————————————————-\n\n[end]\n\nAs for me? Well, you can probably tell which seiyuu I am vouching for by the articles I choose to translate (so I apologize to the idols who I have zero interest in w).\n\nFor me, here’s what I’m thinking about going into 2016:\n\n1.The I’m Enterprise girls: I have always been fond of I’m Ent girls, from the days of Ueda Kana & Nakahara Mai through to Saito Chiwa, Hikasa Yoko and Hayami Saori, and now to people like Ozawa Ari and Onishi Saori. Their next three big things will be Hondo Kaede, Naganawa Maria & Senbongi Sayaka.\n\n2.Aketagawa Jin’s girls: Jin has helped the likes of Taneda Risa break out in recent years; it’s worth nothing who his current favourite girls are – Ozawa Ari, Ishigami Shizuka, Takahashi Minami, Kimura Juri, Takahashi Rie. Ozawa Ari is on fine footing already as is Takahashi Rie (new Precure lead), but it remains to be seen whether Ishigami and Takamina can start getting hired by other sound directors. The key cours to gauge their long-term career outlook will be spring/summer 2016.\n\n3.Ponycan is the new Muray/SME/Aniplex: So it’s funny that I have no problems with Aketagawa’s casting business yet I do have a bone to pick with Ponycan. In fact, I get exasperated whenever I see that Ponycan is producing any new series or movie ‘cos I’m almost convinced that they’ll stick one of their kids to lead the show or sing the theme song. For Jin-kun I have no real issues because he hires people who can at least do their day job properly. For Ponycan we get stuck with Taketatsu Ayana in ill-fitting roles and breaking my eardrums with her ‘singing’, and now it looks like we’ll get tons of Hanamori Yumiri. I’m not sure whether I should be jumping with joy about that…maybe I’ll just wait for her swimsuit photobook or something.\n\n4.Speaking of Muray: I can’t stand Amamiya Sora any more. There, I said it. She was a great turn-off for me in 2015, voice-acting wise (Plamemo, Monmusu). And she just kicked off 2016 in a bad way with Konosuba. Stop annoying me with the DAAARRRLINNNGSSS guys, it just makes my ears bleed faster.\n\n5.Blur the lines, moar!: Just like the lines between the mainstream idol/talent world and the seiyuu industry are getting ever the fainter, I’d like to see more seiyuu being on both the ‘dark’ (eroge) and ‘light’ sides. KenPro and Pro-Fit are amongst the agencies who encourage/allow their charges to do the dirty – we’ve seen Ito Shizuka and Nabatame Hitomi do that over the years with KenPro. Pro-Fit has got girls like Nagatsuma Juri, Takamori Natsumi and now Ishigami Shizuka who do the ero stuff as well. The pay is nice too! Obviously I want this to happen cos it spares me having to play eroge on mute..but yeah, wishful thinking.\n\n6.The halfs: I’ve been doing a bunch of articles on half-Japanese, half-Caucasian seiyuu – Ishii Mark, Lynn, Sarah Emi Bridcutt, and Arthur Lounsbery to come at some point. It’s an interesting niche to be in. 3/4 of them have sizable roles this season – Lynn is the female lead in Saijaku, Sarah the female lead in Haruchika, Mark is Lev in Haikyuu. We’ve also got Kimura Subaru who is already a star in Doraemon. Will definitely be interesting to watch their progress, and that of other halfs in the future.\n\n7.The guys: Oh yeah this is hard. These guys really come from nowhere sometimes, and as mentioned in the third article there are some who get hot from doing mobage and I’m all ??? when it comes to those. I’ll just throw some potential names out there now so let’s see how they’ve done by year-end: Hatanaka Tasuku (KenPro), Amasaki Kohei (I’m), Yashiro Taku (Vims), Uemura Yuto (Himawari). I consider people like Uchida Yuuma, Kawanishi Kengo and Murata Taishi as having ‘made it’ already.\n\n8.The other girls: Thinking purely in terms of voice acting roles – there’s Kito Akari (Pro-Fit). I’d like to see Tanezaki Atsumi get more roles. Yamamura Hibiku might be getting a break, as is Fukuhara Ayaka (beyond Imas). There’s the Macross girl Suzuki Minori. I like Tomita Miyu and Waki Azumi from Galko-chan and uhh…I don’t know. I’m actually really bad at remembering the younger girls and wouldn’t know a potential star until she hit me in the face; there are just too many of them and they all sound the same….only Yoshida Yuri’s voice is super distinct to me (sweat drop;;;)\n\nPt.2 of her Nichinare interview. Read Pt.1 here.\n\nQ: Please tell us why you wanted to become a seiyuu.\n\nA: First of all – back when I was in junior high, I took part in a campaign to promote non-smoking and my group did shout-outs on the street. We’d each say a word, one by one, and as I said my part there was a bit of commotion amongst the crowd. Someone said to me, “Your voice is amazing”. My classmates always imitated the way I spoke when I answered teachers’ questions and that made me wonder if my voice was something that was unusual.\n\nSecondly, I loved listening to radio shows that seiyuu appeared on – the ‘gap’ between their normal and acting voices surprised me. They could be so articulate on the radio yet play gentle, cute characters on screen. I was impressed, thinking “Seiyuu are amazing! So cool!” and though I was unsure whether I could be a seiyuu myself, I thought that I would just try my best and aim towards becoming one.\n\nQ: Did you often watch anime?\n\nA: In those days, I used to watch the shows that were being broadcast in the evening or at night such as ONE PIECE, Naruto and Detective Conan together with my family. I gradually became more interested in anime from then onwards.\n\nQ: When did you actually start taking action in your bid to become a seiyuu?\n\nA: When I was in my 2nd year of high school I enrolled in the Nagoya branch of Nichinare. I’d already looked up voice training schools in my 1st year and had my heart set on Nichinare. I was thinking that I would enrol when I was less busy with club activities. However, due to my horrible tendency to be overly laidback, I missed the deadline for signing up for trial lessons (laughs). Thus in the following year, I signed up right at the start of the application period.\n\nQ: It’s still remarkable that you had already planned to enter Nichinare by your first year of high school. Why did you choose Nichinare?\n\nA: Because classes were only held once a week, so I could attend it while still schooling.\n\nQ: Did you take up the free trial lesson prior to enrolling?\n\nA: Yes! I had absolutely no acting experience in plays or anything; I’d never even raised my voice before so it was an eye-opener for me. My fellow participants were already familiar with voice projection and had acted before. I got worried, wondering “can I really do this?”\n\nQ: How did your family react to your desire to enrol in Nichinare?\n\nA: I hadn’t even taken a single (acting) lesson up ‘til then, so I never actually talked to them about wanting to enrol. When I eventually discussed it with them, they were OK with it and said “Go ahead and try it out”.\n\nQ: What were your thoughts and impressions of Nichinare once you were actually enrolled?\n\nA: I got a bit of a culture shock, just like when I went for the free trial lesson – each of my classmates seemed to have a really huge presence (laughs). It was all I could do to keep up with the lecturers, as well as the rest of my class.\n\nQ: What sort of classes did you take in Nichinare?\n\nA: For the first year it was all basics – the foundations of vocalization, abdominal breathing, etudes. I had to learn first of all, to express myself in a commanding voice without getting embarrassed. Since classes were only once a week I’d practice what I’d learnt at home, as well as do the Nichinare-style of stretching..in my room and in the bath. It’d be embarrassing doing that in front of my parents (laughs).\n\nQ: What exactly is Nichinare-style stretching?\n\nA: They’re actually yoga-style stretches and it’s painful to do them properly. You’ll break into a sweat even doing it briefly. I think it’s beneficial to do not just as a seiyuu, but for health maintenance as well. I feel like it’s helped made my body more flexible…though I haven’t been doing it recently, so I’m probably back to being stiff (laughs).\n\nQ: Did you advance steadily through the regular course in your second year?\n\nA: To tell the truth, I thought it would be impossible for me to progress on to the regular course so I had told my mom, “Just let me do this, even if it’s for 1 year”. I knew it wasn’t going to be easy to become a seiyuu and on top of that I was a very shy person, so I took the lessons with the hope of curing my shyness. I was surprised that someone like me could advance to the regular course…though of course, I did feel strongly about wanting to become a seiyuu.\n\nQ: What did you learn on the regular course?\n\nA: There were formal lessons on acting and voice acting, recitals using scripts and dialogue recitations. As an example, there was a lesson where we had to, create and act out a story within 1 minute & 30 seconds, based on the lyrics of your favourite song. There were many new experiences for me and I had great fun thinking about them. “Just what kind of lessons will I have next week?” or “I wonder what we’ll do next time?” – I was really looking forward to it. I recall that it was during my time in the regular courses that I stopped being nervous about speaking in public. I was able to talk to people while looking them in the eye; I think I grew up a bit from my time in the basic course.\n\nQ: What were the circumstances that led to you joining your (current) agency?\n\nA: Actually, as the affiliation auditions were carried out at the same time as the promotion examinations, I did not only advance to the regular course but also passed the I’m Enterprise admission tests. It was just an unbelievable thing to happen – while wondering, “What the heck should I do now!?”, my parents gave me the push on the back I needed, saying “Since you’ve already gotten the chance to join the agency, you might as well just give it your best shot and see what happens”.\n\nQ: It’s amazing that you got signed up by an agency so quickly!\n\nA: After my attachment to the agency was confirmed, one of the staff members said to me “You’re still in high school so you should prioritize your education for now” and I was very grateful for those warm words. If I had not been admitted into the agency, I was thinking of going on to a local college so I was happy to have my career path decided early on. My parents did say to me that they hoped that I could get something to fall back on as well, so for the 1 year after I graduated high school I went to a vocational school to acquire a professional qualification. I was staying in a dorm during that period and it was tough to have curfews. Whenever I had jobs come up, I was always afraid that I wouldn’t make it back in time before the doors closed.\n\nQ: You’re still attending training programmes right now even as you’re working in the field. What sort of lessons are you taking?\n\nA: In the week leading up to this feature, I was mostly doing dialogue work similar to what you hear on drama CDs while this week, I’ll be working on afureko lessons. The content of the lessons represents a step up for me – some of my classmates who I’m studying with have already started working in the field and there are some others who are really talented as well, so it’s a great opportunity for me to learn. In the studio, you’d always feel a bit tense for fear of messing up but in lessons there are no such worries and I have fun going all out and challenging myself.\n\nQ: Incidentally, your début anime was as one of the main characters, Theiamillis Gre Fortorthe in Rokujoma no Shinryakusha!?.\n\nA: It was the 2nd ever audition that I had taken, during the gap between my advancement from the basic to the regular course – it was actually my first time auditioning in a studio. What’s more, it was the first time in my life standing in front of a mic; I was so nervous!\n\nQ: Who would’ve expected a home run right off the bat! What was your reaction when you found out that you would be making your debut?\n\nA: I was shocked, thinking “It’s a miracle!”. When I relayed the news to my parents they were both surprised and very happy. The studio recording represented one of many firsts for me as well, so I was nothing but a bundle of nerves. Every week (in the studio) was an opportunity to learn for me and taking on the advice I got from everyone there, I gave my absolute best in voicing Tia.\n\nQ: What did you learn in your time at Nichinare that was helpful, and that you still utilize in your work now?\n\nA: Everything I learned has been of use! What left the biggest impression though, was what I was taught by Sakamoto Chika-san, to be conscious about wanting to try out various things. Don’t just try to keep things normal and stay in your safety zone; when the chance to do something interesting comes up, do it – I always have these thoughts in mind when it comes to decision-making when I’m on the job.\n\nQ: What do you think are the merits and the attractions of a place like Nichinare?\n\nA: First of all, the variety of courses available allows people to learn at their own pace based on their own situations, whether you are a student or are working. Also, there are 10 schools located throughout the country so it’s great to be able to easily attend one that is near where you live. You get to learn together with people who are highly knowledgeable and share advice, helping each other to grow while strengthening your bonds. The friends I made from my time spent in the lessons remain treasures to me. I believe that you too, will surely meet such great companions.\n\nQ: What are your future goals as a seiyuu?\n\nA: I want to voice mascot characters. Being a mascot character means you can cheer along (for whatever it is that you’re a mascot for) as well as be much loved by many people regardless of age, for a long time. Also, I’d like to try out the type of characters that are on charge of giving the explanations in shows. I’m not 100% confident in my ability to recite (lengthy) lines smoothly yet, but such roles require the actor to speak clearly in a voice that can easily be transmitted to listeners; if I could have such a role it’d help me to improve my line recitations. Right now, I’m having a lot of fun meeting the new characters I voice with each new show I work on, so I’ll focus on giving my best for each and every job I get.\n\nQ: Lastly, please give some advice and a message to those who are aiming to become seiyuu.\n\nA: Nichinare is a place where many seniors have gone on to achieve great success and that is the proof of the effectiveness of its lessons and its achievements. Also, it is a place that allows those who are like me and do not live in Tokyo, yet desire to become seiyuu, to easily learn. I was able to début while still studying (at Nichinare) so do not give up and take on the challenge. For those who are interested in Nichinare, just request for information and sign up for that free trial lesson. Take action as soon as you think of doing something! That’s advice from me, based on my own experiences (laughs). I myself am just a fresh, new rookie so for all my future roles and works, I will use what I have learned in Nichinare in order to further grow. Let’s do our best together!\n\nName: Kanemoto Hisako (金元 寿子)\n\nDoB: 16 December 1987\n\nHometown: Kurashiki, Okayama\n\nAgency: Production Baobab\n\nSNS: Blog\n\nKanemoto, nicknamed Hii-chan, originally joined an affiliate company of Production Baobab in 2008 before winning a public audition for the Sword World 2.0 Tanodan table-top RPG. From 2009, she joined the Baobab main agency and made her debut in Sora no Manimani using the stage name Aikawa Juri, before switching back to her real name later that year. By the following year she was landing lead roles in So.Ra.No.Wo.To and Shinryaku! Ika-musume and she also won a Best Female Newcomer award at the 5th Seiyuu Awards.\n\nIn 2012 however, Kanemoto was implicated by netizens for her role in the Kokoro Connect bullying incident and her public image took a bit of a beating. After issuing a public apology, she kept her head down and continued to work hard and the upshot is that her career has survived pretty much unscathed. Some of her recent high-profile works includes Gundam Iron-Blooded Orphans, the Durarara!! Series, Assassination Classroom and the Sailor Moon reboot.\n\nHii-chan is the 100th seiyuu to feature in Da Vinci’s 声優図鑑 feature.\n\nQ: You’ve been cast in a lot of works but first of all, allow us to ask us about your currently airing anime. What kind of girl is Atra, the character you voice in Mobile Suit Gundam Iron-Blooded Orphans, which has been airing since last October?\n\nA: There are a lot of scenes in the show featuring conversations about life in general; in the midst of that is (Atra), a warm, gentle child who never lets the heavy atmosphere burden her. She may be young but she tries extremely hard to be a pillar of support for everyone – she’s a girl who is very strong at heart. I get a bit nervous during recording since she’s operating at a different pace compared to those around her (laughs) but that in itself, may be (one of) her strengths.\n\nQ: In Gate: Jieitai Kano Chi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri, you voice a character named Tuka. The 2nd cour is finally going on air – is there anything in particular people should look out for?\n\nA: Actually, there’s a really important scene that will show how Tuka overcomes a certain incident. It’s a powerful scene so please look forward to it.\n\nQ: You have voiced a variety of roles up until this point – which one of your works did you see as being a turning point?\n\nA: I’d say So.Ra.No.Wo.To (2010), the show in which I voiced my first ever leading part. The role of Kanata was the start of my life as a seiyuu. I think it’s fair to say that without So.Ra.No.Wo.To, I wouldn’t have gotten anywhere. There was work in front of the camera, there were interviews. It also gave me my first opportunity to sing a chara song – really, it was this show that brought me to the realization that seiyuu work is in reality, different to what I had imagined it to be – it wasn’t enough to be merely good at acting, you had to be able to do a lot of other things as well (laughs). Thanks to So.Ra.No.Wo.To, I started getting more chances to work on anime and a lot of aspects [of my life] changed.\n\nQ: What was your original reason for wanting to become a seiyuu?\n\nA: I only decided upon it during my third year of high school, when it was time for us to choose our career paths. I was relatively late in making my decision, compared to other people. I loved anime and foreign dramas so I had a bit of interest in the seiyuu profession but I was aware that I was really bad at speaking.\n\nQ: That doesn’t seem so apparent now.\n\nA: I was a lot worse at it back then (laughs). What’s more, I was a shy person and had a tendency to hesitate in everything. But my desire to take up voice acting studies grew stronger, and I enrolled in a vocational school in Kobe. That means that I only started acting once I was in training school.\n\nQ: Were there any shows that influenced you in the times before you became a seiyuu? I hear that you liked Hikaru no Go?\n\nA: I think that I was mostly influenced by the kind of shows aimed at kids that aired in the evening slots. Anime that I really love include Turn A Gundam and Sherlock Hound. I really love the music in Turn A Gundam composed by Kanno Yoko-san, that was the first time I felt compelled to chase after anime music (laughs). I used to record music on Mini Discs to listen to in those days.\n\nQ: So you became interested in anisong from that time as well?\n\nA: That’s right. It made me start to think “Wow, anisong is cool~”. I really loved those theme songs from battle girls’ anime like Magic Knight Rayearth as well. I think it was my love for such things that over time, gradually developed into an interest in seiyuu work.\n\nQ: Having gone through such experiences, what were your impressions of actually singing a character song for So.Ra.No.Wo.To?\n\nA: For So.Ra.No.Wo.To, I just sang normally in my natural voice. It was to be my first time singing on record, so before I received any information about the recording, I went along to karaoke with some of the staff members and performed a couple of tunes in front of them. I was insanely nervous (laughs). So yeah there was that, and the finished chara song ended up sounding quite natural. One song that I was really conscious of singing in character for was for Shinryaku! Ika-musume (2010), The lyrics featured all her speech nuances, plus it was my first time performing a musical interlude.\n\nQ: Your character’s voice in Shinryaku! Ika-musume left quite the impression!\n\nA: As it was a role that involved quickly switching between her ‘laughing’ and ‘angry’ modes, I found it a bit of a challenge back then. Also, after you’ve spent some time away from the role it can be slightly difficult to click into gear once again. But I remember watching my seniors and being amazed at how they weren’t fazed by that. Ika-musume was a pretty powerful work and the characters had great impact as well and to me, it’s an established title. If the opportunity ever arises, I’d like to reprise the role (laughs).\n\nQ: I’ll definitely have to check that out when it happens! (laughs) You’ve appeared in numerous other interesting shows apart from that so I’m thinking that you do find acting fun after all, don’t you?\n\nA: To tell the truth, I’m always thinking that acting is a tough job (laughs). Of course acting has its fun aspects but there is no ‘right answer’ so trying to tackle the question seriously would be hard. What I find the most fun is when I’m engaging in dialogue with other people. However, there are always challenges in front of me – just when I think I’ve cleared one hurdle, there’s always another one waiting ahead. I don’t think I’ll ever successfully eliminate all these obstacles (laughs).\n\nQ: Last year, you released a private album titled Fantastic Voyage. What did you learn from the process of making the record?\n\nA: As it was a memorial album, I was happy to be able to sing songs that I liked and to decide on what kind of mood I wanted for it. I’m originally from Okayama Prefecture so there’s a song included that introduces Okayama. Thanks to this album, I was able to hold an independent event in my hometown in Okayama. I felt that there was a ‘connection’ there, so to speak.\n\nQ: This is the independent event that was held on 6th December 2015 in Okayama, right?\n\nA: I serve as the ‘Ambassador of the Sunny Nation of Okayama’ so I had been thinking about doing something in Okayama.I had a desire to try organizing an event so alongside my older sister who works as a manicurist in our hometown, I made the decision to hold an event.\n\nQ: Did you get any feedback on your first independent event?\n\nA: The intention was to showcase songs from my private album and I had always wanted to give something back to my fans, so I had thought that it’d be great if such an event could bring "
