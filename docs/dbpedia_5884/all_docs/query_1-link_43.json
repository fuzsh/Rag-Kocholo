Woody printed this in a lyric booklet in the 1930s:\n\n“This song is Copyrighted in U.S., under Seal of Copyright # 154085, for a period of 28 years, and anybody caught singin it without our permission, will be mighty good friends of ours, cause we don’t give a dern. Publish it. Write it. Sing it. Swing to it. Yodel it. We wrote it, that’s all we wanted to do.”\n\nThat said, I do have bills to pay, so if you’re able to contribute to my work, you can do so below.\n\nThe songs I have made available here are free for you to sing and share. Please do. If you publicly perform any of my songs (with choirs as well as solo), please remember to log the info to PRS so that I can get the royalties – every little helps!"
