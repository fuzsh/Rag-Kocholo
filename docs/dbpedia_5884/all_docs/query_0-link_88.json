        "text": "Graphene is extracted from graphite and is made up of pure carbon.\n\nIt is 200 times more resistant than steel and five times lighter than aluminum.\n\nIt conducts electricity better than any other material at room temperature.\n\nIt is thought that graphene could boost the useful life of batteries by 10 per cent.\n\nGraphene can also detect cancer cells in the early stages of the disease.\n\nThe material was first discovered when Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov were 'playing' with graphite at the University of Manchester in 2004.\n\nIn addition to the Emirates and Etihad programmes, there is the Air Miles Middle East card, which offers members the ability to choose any airline, has no black-out dates and no restrictions on seat availability. Air Miles is linked up to HSBC credit cards and can also be earned through retail partners such as Spinneys, Sharaf DG and The Toy Store.\n\nAn Emirates Dubai-London round-trip ticket costs 180,000 miles on the Air Miles website. But customers earn these ‘miles’ at a much faster rate than airline miles. Adidas offers two air miles per Dh1 spent. Air Miles has partnerships with websites as well, so booking.com and agoda.com offer three miles per Dh1 spent.\n\n“If you use your HSBC credit card when shopping at our partners, you are able to earn Air Miles twice which will mean you can get that flight reward faster and for less spend,” says Paul Lacey, the managing director for Europe, Middle East and India for Aimia, which owns and operates Air Miles Middle East."
