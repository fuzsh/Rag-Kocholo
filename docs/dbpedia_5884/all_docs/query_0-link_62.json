This year, Sing Out Loud has partnered with the Live Wildly Foundation, whose mission is to raise public awareness of the importance of preserving Florida’s natural landscapes and wildlife. Their first priority is the Florida Wildlife Corridor, an 18-million-acre wildlife superhighway providing safe passage for some of Florida's most endangered species, including the Florida panther. A portion of ticket sales from the Live Wildly Showcase will be dedicated to conservation efforts within St. Johns County.\n\n\"Our team is committed to using the platforms of our programming like Sing Out Loud and the Fort Mose Jazz & Blues Series to make a meaningful community impact,\" said Gabe Pellicer, CEO & President of SJC Cultural Events. \"Our shared values with the Florida State Parks Foundation naturally led us to a partnership with Live Wildly. It's an honor to collaborate with them, merging art with action to champion land conservation and preserve the environment we all treasure.\"\n\n\"We are incredibly excited to partner with the Sing Out Loud festival, which showcases not only Florida's vibrant culture but also our unwavering commitment to preserving its wild beauty,” Lisa Shipley, Live Wildly’s Chief Executive Officer. “At Live Wildly, we believe in creating a balance between our ecology and economy. By harmonizing with nature, this festival provides the perfect platform to inspire environmental protection while celebrating the wild beat that resonates throughout our state. Together, we aim to amplify the need to safeguard Florida's natural resources for future generations.\"\n\nSing Out Loud Festival will also feature free local artist showcases, ticketed events, artist development programs, the St. Augustine Record Fair, the St. Augustine Songwriters Festival and more throughout September.
