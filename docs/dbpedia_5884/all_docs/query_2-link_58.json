        "text": "Updated 6/11/2024\n\nWhat is a Bass?\n\nA Bass voice has the lowest-pitched singing voice of all the categories.\n\nThe word comes from the late Latin word Bassus, meaning thick or low.\n\nAccording to The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, a Bass voice is typically classified as having a vocal range extending from E2 to E4.\n\nThis covers the entire Bass Clef on the musical staff.\n\nIt also covers a few notes below (E2) and a few notes above, stretching all the way up to the bottom line of the Treble Clef (E4).\n\nLet's unwrap how to sing as a Bass vocalist.\n\nHow do I determine if I’m a Bass?\n\nRange\n\nThe first way to determine if you are a Bass voice is to see if you can sing comfortably in the middle of this range from G2 to C4.\n\nCheck out a vocal range chart for help in determining this.\n\nThis is often referred to as your tessitura.\n\nYour tessitura where your voice has the best and most natural sound quality in a particular range.\n\nThis usually excludes the very extreme edge of your range on either side.\n\nEssentially where your voice sits most comfortably.\n\nTone\n\nA Bass typically has a rich and full timbre.\n\nThere's usually a deep rumbling quality as well.\n\nYou can often check to see if your lowest notes open up into a loud bellowing chest voice sound.\n\nPassaggio\n\nThe other way to determine if you are a Bass is to determine where your “break range” is.\n\nAlso known as \"passaggio.\"\n\nThis is where your voice cracks or, with proper training, transitions smoothly from chest voice to head voice.\n\nA Bass is typically going to be transitioning out of chest voice into head voice through their passaggio around C4 or D4.\n\nThese transitional notes are much lower than all the other voice types.\n\nWhat is a Basso Profundo?\n\nLike all other voice types there are a number of subcategories or “Fachs” within the Bass range.\n\nThese voice types are divided up by vocal range, tessitura, tone, volume, and even based off of famous Operatic roles.\n\nA Basso Profundo refers to the lowest Bass singer with at least a C2 on the bottom.\n\n'Profound bass,' right?\n\nIn some cases an exceptionally deep-ranged basso profondo is called an Oktavist.\n\nYou can hear some great examples of this in Russian Orthodox Choral music.\n\nAn Oktavist can extend down to A1, and sometimes even to F1.\n\nThis is an entire octave below the bass staff, hence the famous name Oktavist.\n\nSome famous Oktavists such as Mikhail Zlatopolsky or Alexander Ort have reached extreme lows down to C1!\n\nA Bass-Baritone on the other hand can sing in a higher tessitura like someone with a Baritone range, but still has the warm chesty quality of a Bass.\n\nThere is also Comic Bass (Basso Buffo).\n\nThis refers to a lighter sounding Bass with lots of agility.\n\nIt gets its name from the clownish characters that a Comic Bass often plays in Opera.\n\nA Lyric Bass, sort of like the Italian Basso Cantabile, often refers to a lighter or higher singing Bass similar to the Bass-Baritone.\n\nThe opposite of a Lyric Bass would be a Dramatic Bass, refering to a louder and more full sounding Bass voice.\n\nLyric and Dramatic can often be combined with other Bass voice types for a more specific description.\n\nFor example: A Dramatic Basso Profundo would be characterized as a very low AND loud often booming sounding Bass with a VERY full tone.\n\nIf you want to learn how to sing, the 30 Day Singer singing lesson program will take you step-by-step through everything you need to know!\n\nWho are some famous Basses?\n\nMany Basses are more famously known for singing in Classical music.\n\nSome examples are Borsi Cristoff, Nicolaï Ghiaurov, Jerom A. Hines, Kurt Moll, and Cesare Siepi.\n\nHowever, there are some notable Bass singers in contemporary music as well including Johnny Cash, Barry White, and Leonard Cohen as higher Bass-Baritones.\n\nTim Storms is a great example of a contemporary Basso Profundo or Oktavist.\n\nI would recommend using nice headphones to listen to this exceptionally low singer!\n\nTechnique Tips for Basses\n\nWorking on hitting lower notes can be a challenge since many people lose their lowest notes the more active their body gets throughout the day.\n\nTrying to push down to sing lower causes tension just like reaching for high notes.\n\nWhile it may not be the most typical way a singer can damage their voice, it can certainly fatigue the voice almost just as much when we try to press too much beyond our lowest notes.\n\nA singer trying to sing super low should watch for tongue tension.\n\nHere are some tips for how to get better at singing low notes.\n\nMake sure your tongue doesn't retract back into your throat creating a characteristic froggy sound like a very back placed “L” sound.\n\nYou should also watch for locking or pressing the larynx too far down to reach for these notes.\n\nMany Bass voice singers use brighter vowels to help maintain these lowest pitches and I would encourage any Bass to look into this technique to maximize your lower range with ease.\n\nJust remember there is a bottom to every range!\n\nThe most important aspect of finding your range is to make sure that you are singing in a comfortable Tessitura.\n\nThis also impacts how you select material for repertoire and auditions to fit this range\n\nIt's always about what both feels and sounds the most authentic.\n\nIf you want to test out your low range with songs, check out these karaoke songs for low voices.\n\nBe sure to check out 30 Day Singer for additional vocal training online.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is the voice range of a bass?\n\nA bass voice typically ranges from E2 to E4, sometimes even lower, making it the lowest male voice type.\n\nIs bass vocal range rare?\n\nYes, a true bass vocal range is quite rare compared to other voice types, making bass singers a special find.\n\nWhat is the true bass voice?\n\nA true bass voice has a rich, deep tone with a range that comfortably hits low notes, often extending down to E2 or even lower.\n\nIs bass the lowest singing voice?\n\nYes, bass is the lowest singing voice, sitting below baritone and tenor in the vocal range spectrum.\n\nWhat is the rarest voice type?\n\nThe contralto is often considered the rarest female voice type, while the true basso profundo is the rarest for males.\n\nHow do bass singers sing so low?\n\nBass singers naturally have longer and thicker vocal cords, allowing them to produce those deep, resonant tones.\n\nWho is the lowest bass singer in the world?\n\nTim Storms holds the record for the lowest note produced by a human, making him the lowest bass singer in the world.\n\nWhat is a low bass singer called?\n\nA low bass singer is often referred to as a basso profundo, which means \"deep bass\" in Italian.\n\nWhat modern singer has a bass voice?\n\nA modern singer with a notable bass voice is Avi Kaplan, formerly of Pentatonix, known for his deep and resonant tone."
