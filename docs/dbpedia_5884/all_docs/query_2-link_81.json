        "text": "What are vocal cords (vocal folds)?\n\nYour vocal cords are two bands of muscle inside your voice box (larynx) that allow you to vocalize, or make sounds. Your voice box sits atop your windpipe (trachea), the tube that allows air to flow to and from your lungs. When you breathe in (inhale) and breathe out (exhale), your vocal cords open so air can flow freely. When you speak, your vocal cords close by meeting in the middle of your exhaled airstream and vibrate. The vibration creates the sound of your voice.\n\nMost healthcare providers refer to vocal cords as vocal folds. The difference relates to structure. People once thought that vocal cords were like two strings (cords) of a musical instrument that vibrated when strummed or plucked. Now we know that each band consists of multiple folds. These folds aren’t isolated structures, like cords or strings. Instead, they connect to various muscles and cartilage inside of your voice box.\n\nWhere are the vocal cords located?\n\nYour vocal cords are inside your voice box (larynx), which is on top of your windpipe, directly behind your Adam’s apple. Your Adam’s apple is the bony protrusion in the front of your throat at the midpoint. If you place a finger or two on this spot and swallow, you should feel the protrusion move up. If you yawn, you should feel the protrusion move down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is the structure of your vocal cords?\n\nYour vocal cords are two pearly white bands of tissue in the center of your voice box. A vocal cord on the right and one on the left meet to form a shape like an upside-down “V” when your vocal cords are open. When they’re closed, they come together to form a slit.\n\nYour vocal cords stretch from the left to the right side of your voice box and from front to back. They connect to muscles and cartilage inside of your voice box that help control the movement of your vocal cords.\n\nWhat are vocal cords made of?\n\nA moist, protective lining called a mucous membrane covers your vocal cords. Underneath the lining, vocal cords consist of three basic layers:\n\nAn outer layer of cells called the epithelium.\n\nA middle layer called the lamina propria, which helps your vocal cords move.\n\nAn innermost muscular layer that includes the vocalis muscle and the thyroarytenoid muscles.\n\nWhat size are vocal cords?\n\nWhen you’re born, your vocal cords are about 6 to 8 millimeters long. They grow as you age into adulthood. The length and thickness of your vocal cords help determine how high or low your voice is, or your pitch. Thicker vocal cords produce a lower pitch, or a deep voice.\n\nMen and people assigned male at birth (AMAB): The hormone testosterone thickens and lengthens vocal cords during puberty, producing deeper voices. The average vocal cord length is 1.75 to 2.5 centimeters. These changes are irreversible. This means that people who are transgender and AMAB who receive feminizing hormone therapy continue to have deeper voices unless they work with a speech-language pathologist to adjust their pitch and/or receive voice feminization surgery.\n\nWomen and people assigned female at birth (AFAB): Vocal cords grow somewhat during puberty, so the average length is 1.25 centimeters and 1.75 centimeters. People who are transgender and AFAB who receive testosterone as part of masculinizing hormone therapy experience changes in their vocal cords, like thickening and lengthening. As a result, their voices deepen.\n\nFor some people, vocal cords and other muscles inside their larynx shrink and grow weaker with age, making it harder to talk.\n\nWhat conditions and disorders affect your vocal cords?\n\nThe most common conditions that affect your vocal cords include:\n\nLaryngitis: Laryngitis is swelling, or inflammation, of your vocal cords. It may cause you to lose your voice, or your voice may sound weak, hoarse or raspy. Overusing your vocal cords, infections, smoking and chronic acid reflux (GERD) are all possible causes of laryngitis.\n\nVocal cord nodules, polyps and cysts: Vocal cord nodules, polyps and cysts are benign (noncancerous) growths. Nodules and polyps are solid lumps or bumps, and cysts are fluid-filled. They can cause your voice to sound weak or hoarse, or you may completely lose your voice. Benign growths on your vocal cords often result from straining your voice (overusing or misusing your vocal cords). They can have other causes, too, like smoking, sinusitis and allergies.\n\nVocal cord paralysis: Vocal cord paralysis prevents you from being able to open and close your vocal cords normally. As a result, you may have trouble speaking, breathing or swallowing. Multiple conditions can cause nerve damage that prevents the muscles in your vocal cords from moving as they should. This may leave your voice sounding breathy or make it hard to cough and clear your throat normally.\n\nLess common conditions include:\n\nLaryngeal cancer: Laryngeal cancer can form in the structures in your voice box, including your vocal cords.\n\nLaryngospasm: Laryngospasm happens when your vocal cords suddenly spasm, making breathing or talking difficult. These spasms are unpredictable and usually last less than a minute.\n\nMuscle tension dysphonia: Muscle tension dysphonia happens when there’s increased muscle activity in your head and neck. You tighten your muscles either inside of your voice box, outside of your voice box, or both. The tightness prevents your vocal cords from moving freely and easily, and can lead to strain and discomfort in your throat and/or neck. This can happen alone (primary MTD) or as a response to another issue in your voice box (secondary MTD).\n\nReinke’s edema: Reinke’s edema occurs when fluid collects in the part of your vocal folds called Reinke’s space, causing them to swell. This can make your voice hoarse and lower in pitch.\n\nSpasmodic dysphonia: Spasmodic dysphonia is a long-term condition that causes your vocal cords to tighten or spasm when you try to talk.\n\nInducible laryngeal obstruction (ILO):This condition makes it difficult to open your vocal cords, making breathing hard. It’s also called vocal cord dysfunction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat are common signs and symptoms of conditions affecting your vocal cords?\n\nSymptoms depend on the specific condition affecting your vocal cords. They may include:\n\nHoarseness.\n\nLosing your voice.\n\nA weakened or quieter voice.\n\nVoice changes, especially going from a higher to a lower pitch or developing a rasp.\n\nFrequent coughing, swallowing or neck pain.\n\nTrouble swallowing, talking or breathing.\n\nWhat common tests are used to check your vocal cords?\n\nVisit a healthcare provider if you have voice changes that last longer than two weeks, like hoarseness or fatigue. Depending on your symptoms, you may need to see a voice specialist or an ear, nose and throat specialist (ENT) for a diagnosis. You may need to see a laryngologist, a specialist who treats disorders affecting the voice box. You may also see a voice-specialized speech-language pathologist.\n\nDuring your visit, a healthcare provider will ask about your medical history and perform a physical exam. Additional tests and procedures may include a:\n\nCT scan or MRI: These imaging procedures can reveal structures inside your throat like nodules, polyps or cysts.\n\nBacteria culture test: A healthcare provider may swab your throat and test the sample for bacteria that cause infections.\n\nLaryngoscopy: During this procedure, a provider inserts a thin, lighted instrument called a laryngoscope into your voice box to inspect your vocal cords.\n\nVideostroboscopy: This procedure is like a laryngoscopy. It involves a special light that allows your healthcare provider to see how your vocal cords vibrate.\n\nBiopsy: A healthcare provider may remove a tissue sample from your vocal cords to test for abnormal cells.\n\nLaryngeal electromyography (LEMG): This test can help diagnose vocal cord paralysis. It measures how your nerves control the muscles in your voice box.\n\nWhat are common treatments for conditions affecting your vocal cords?\n\nCommon treatments include:\n\nResting your voice by not speaking or singing (vocal rest).\n\nMedicines that reduce inflammation and pain.\n\nSurgery to remove growths.\n\nVoice therapy to help your vocal cords heal or to teach you how to use them properly.\n\nVoice therapy can help you speak more confidently and with greater control. It can also be a treatment for those whose gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth. This voice therapy is called gender-affirming voice modification training or gender-affirming voice therapy."
