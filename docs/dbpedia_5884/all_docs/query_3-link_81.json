        "text": "Céline Dion performed for the first time at the Paris Olympics 2024 opening ceremony since revealing her health issues in late 2022. The singer has been diagnosed with stiff person syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that causes stiffness and muscle spasms and can make it difficult for her to sing.\n\nShe took the stage and serenaded the crowd with “L’Hymne à L’Amour” by Edith Piaf.\n\nDion performed at the very end of the Olympics opening ceremony, perched on the Eiffel Tower in a silver gown, stunning fans with her strength amid her health battle.\n\nShe later released a statement on Instagram, sharing how much the night meant to her.\n\n\"I’m honored to have performed tonight, for the Paris 2024 Opening Ceremony, and so full of joy to be back in one of my very favorite cities!\" she wrote.\"Most of all, I’m so happy to be celebrating these amazing athletes, with all their stories of sacrifice and determination, pain and perseverance. All of you have been so focused on your dream, and whether or not you take home a medal, I hope that being here means that it has come true for you! You should all be so proud, we know how hard you have worked to be the best of the best. Stay focused, keep going, my heart is with you!\"\n\nThe next day, she posted about her sadness over leaving Paris after the emotional performance: \"Wow, what a night. Thanks to everyone at @paris2024, @olympics and @dior who helped make this dream come true. And now, it’s already time to go! I will miss you Paris!\"\n\nThere had been much speculation that Dion was going to perform leading up to the kickoff of the Games. She arrived in Paris a few days before the rumored performance, according to her Instagram account.\n\nEarlier this year, Dion, 56, alluded to the fact that she would be performing in the near future during an exclusive sit-down with TODAY's Hoda Kotb, aired in June. The interview was tied to the release of a new documentary, \"I Am: Céline Dion,\" about her journey to perform again despite her stiff person syndrome.\n\nRELATED: Céline Dion suffers ‘unimaginable’ medical crisis in documentary: Her doctor explains what happened\n\nHere's everything the singer has shared about her health and efforts to return to the stage.\n\nHow is Céline Dion's health today?\n\nDion had been saying for months that she was working on building up her strength, despite her stiff person syndrome diagnosis, to be able to perform again. The singer did just that at the opening ceremony of the 2024 Paris Olympics on July 26.\n\nReactions from fans were incredibly emotional.\n\n\"Triumphant comeback!!!!! We were crying,\" Hoda commented on Dion's Instagram post after the event.\n\n\"Whenever I see you, the word 'royalty' comes to mind. Keep going, Queen! You got this!\" added Tyra Banks.\n\n\"The greatest moment I’ve ever seen on TV,\" another fan wrote.\n\nBefore her Olympics performance, her most recent public outing was in late June, a surprise appearance at the NHL draft to announce the Montreal Canadiens' first pick of the night.\n\nDion also attended the premiere of her documentary in New York City in mid-June and posed on the red carpet. When speaking to the audience, she shared how glad she was to find herself in front of a crowd for the first time in years.\n\nIn her first TV interview since revealing her stiff person syndrome diagnosis, aired in mid-June 2024, Dion told Hoda that her voice is getting stronger and that she believes she will be healthy enough in the near future to return to the stage — but she didn't specify exactly when.\n\n\"I believe in myself, in my bravery,\" she said, adding that she may still need to call off performances from time to time: \"I know that I have a good team right now (who will say), ‘No show tonight.' It’s going to be hard. It will probably happen.\"\n\nStill, she will not let her disease \"control my life,\" she said. \"I’m going to come onstage because I’m ready. And my vocal cords will not scare me because I’m going to be ready, and I’m going to hit those notes.\"\n\nDion’s physician, Dr. Amanda Piquet, also told Hoda that Dion has made \"significant progress\" with her treatment since the documentary was made.\n\nDion previously told Vogue magazine in May that her \"happiness has come back\" in recent years since publicly revealing her diagnosis. \"It has been a big burden on my shoulders, and a lot of that weight’s gone ... because now I can just focus on reality. That’s wonderful,\" she said.\n\nIn a Vogue France interview published the prior month, she shared that she's \"(learning) to live with\" her illness, adding that she's been receiving vocal, physical and athletic therapy five days a week.\n\nIn February, Dion presented the last award of the night and received a standing ovation at the 2024 Grammys. “When I say, I’m happy to be here, I really mean it from my heart,” she said.\n\nDion also sang behind the scenes at the award ceremony, harmonizing with singer Sonyae Elise in a video on Instagram. Dion was all smiles as she performed, even if it wasn't on the main stage.\n\nWhen first announcing her documentary in January 2024, Dion's team shared a short update on her health, writing that the singer is \"on the road to resuming her performing career.\"\n\n“This last couple of years has been such a challenge for me, the journey from discovering my condition to learning how to live with and manage it, but not to let it define me,” Dion said in the release.\n\nWhat is stiff person syndrome?\n\nStiff person syndrome is a progressive, neurological disorder with features of an autoimmune disease. It causes muscle stiffness in the torso and limbs, and a heightened sensitivity to noise, touch and emotional stress, which can set off painful muscle spasms, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.\n\nThe condition can have a severe effect on quality of life. People with stiff person syndrome may develop hunched posture and struggle to walk or move. They may also fall more frequently because they lack the muscle reflexes to catch themselves, which can lead to injury.\n\nStiff person syndrome is rare, affecting only one or two people in a million, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. It affects twice as many women as men, according to the National Institutes of Health.\n\nIt’s a “very serious condition,” Dr. Desimir Mijatovic, a pain medicine specialist at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, tells TODAY.com. “People can have difficulty with movement and difficulty with living their lives.”\n\nSpeaking about Dion specifically, he notes there are many muscles involved with singing, especially in front of a huge audience. “Those muscles are prone to spasm or tightening up, and I’m sure it can affect the way that she sings and performs,” Mijatovic says. “If those muscles aren’t working properly, that can make it very difficult.”\n\nDr. Scott Newsome, director of the Stiff Person Syndrome Center at Johns Hopkins Medicine, called it “a devastating disease” in a video explaining the disorder.\n\n“It’s quite painful, so people will go around with these chronic pain syndromes, go from one doctor to another trying to figure out what’s causing these really bad spasm pain syndromes. Sometimes they get labeled crazy.”\n\nBecause stiff person syndrome is so rare and can mimic other conditions, it takes about seven years on average for people to get diagnosed, Newsome added.\n\nThere is no cure for stiff person syndrome, though symptoms may be kept under control with certain drugs, as well as physical, occupational and aqua therapy, according to Yale Medicine.\n\nStiff person syndrome symptoms\n\nPatients may initially feel an aching discomfort, stiffness or pain, especially in the lower back or legs, but also in the shoulders, neck, and hips, according to the National Organization for Rare Disorders.\n\nWith time, the leg muscles stiffen, with one leg often more affected than the other, leading to a stiff walking gait and a hunched over posture, it noted.\n\nPatients also develop muscle spasms, which can be triggered by common sounds, such as a car honking, “causing people to freeze like a statue and fall,” according to the Stiff Person Syndrome Research Foundation.\n\n“Just walking down the street, they could have a spasm and fall,” Newsome said.\n\nNot being able to get regular sleep, loud noises and stressful situations can worsen the symptoms, Mijatovic notes.\n\nThe director of Dion's upcoming documentary, Irene Taylro Brodsky, described to Hoda what it was like to witness one of the singer's medical attacks.\n\n\"Her body was enduring something that was unimaginable. And I wasn’t sure if she was aware of it. And I wasn’t sure if she was going to survive it,” Brodsky said.\n\nWhat causes stiff person syndrome?\n\nThe exact cause is still a mystery, but it appears to be an autoimmune response gone awry in the brain and spinal cord, according to the NIH.\n\nThe disorder is frequently associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as diabetes, thyroiditis, vitiligo and pernicious anemia, the NIH added.\n\nStiff person syndrome treatment\n\nDion's condition is being managed with IVIG, or intravenous immunoglobulin, which helps manage the autoimmune aspects of the condition. She also sees a vocal therapist and physical therapists and takes medication. She told Hoda about relying on high doses of Valium to control her muscle spasms.\n\nGenerally, Piquet says treatment for stiff person syndrome usually involves immune treatment, which includes IVIG, and symptom-focused treatment, which includes medication, such as muscle relaxers, and various physical therapies.\n\nCeline Dion’s stiff person syndrome diagnosis\n\nIn December 2022, Dion revealed she’d been diagnosed with stiff person syndrome and would be postponing tour dates due to the condition. Five months later, in May 2023, she canceled all remaining tour dates.\n\n“We now know this is what’s been causing all of the spasms that I’ve been having,” she in the emotional video posted on her Instagram page.\n\n“Unfortunately, these spasms affect every aspect of my daily life, sometimes causing difficulties when I walk and not allowing me to use my vocal cords to sing the way I’m used to.”\n\n“I’m working hard with my sports medicine therapist every day to build back my strength and my ability to perform again, but I have to admit it’s been a struggle,” she continued. “All I know is singing. It’s what I’ve done all my life, and it’s what I love to do the most.\"\n\nWill Celine Dion be able to perform again?\n\nDion is rumored to be performing for the first time since announcing her stiff person syndrome diagnosis at the Paris Olympics 2024 opening ceremony.\n\nIn her June 2024 interview with Hoda, asked about performing again, she said: \"I’m going to go back onstage, even if I have to crawl. Even if I have to talk with my hands, I will ... not just because I have to, or because I need to. It’s because I want to and I miss it.\"\n\nShe did not reveal a specific timeline for performing again and previously opened up to Vogue France about the roller coaster of deciding when she may be ready.\n\n“For four years I’ve been saying to myself that I’m not going back, that I’m ready, that I’m not ready. ... As things stand, I can’t stand here and say to you: ‘Yes, in four months,'\" she told the magazine.\n\nIn the past, the singer and her team have said they expect her to be able to perform again at some point.\n\nOn March 15, Dion wrote in the caption of an Instagram post for Stiff Person Syndrome Awareness Day that \"I remain determined to one day get back onto the stage and to live as normal of a life as possible.”\n\nIn May 2023, Dion stressed that she was trying to regain her strength, and at the time, her team also said they “have every hope that someday soon” she’ll be able to tour in Europe.\n\nWhile every person’s situation is different, some people are able to manage the symptoms of stiff person syndrome \"to the point that their condition is stable (and) they can continue to live fairly mobile (lives),\" Mijatovic, who is not involved in Dion's care, says.\n\n“People like Céline are oftentimes able to overcome a lot of amazing things, and I definitely think it’s something that’s possible,” he adds.\n\nA timeline of Celine Dion's health\n\n2008: Dion notices stiff person syndrome symptoms on tour\n\nWhile in Germany in 2008 for the Taking Changes World Tour, Dion remembers realizing something was wrong, she told Hoda.\n\n“I was fine, and I had breakfast, and then my voice started to go high and then I ... felt like I could not control it. I was skidding. I was like, I could not control anything,\" she recalled.\n\nGetting ready for her next show in another city, she had to cut her soundcheck short. \"I had to find a path. (My vocal cords were) squeezed,” she said. “So I said, ‘I’m just going to do two songs.’ Normally I sing, like, almost an hour to 45 minutes for a sound check.”\n\nDion described trying to sing with stiff person syndrome as “somebody is strangling you.” Eventually, she also started experiencing muscle spasms, balance issues and trouble walking.\n\n“It feels like if I point my feet, they will stay in a (stuck position), or if I cook — because I love to cook — my fingers, my hands, will get in a position,\" she told Hoda. \"My feet — it’s cramping, but it’s like in a position of, like, you cannot unlock them.”\n\n“Sometimes, when it’s very severe, it can break some ribs as well,” she added.\n\n2019: Dion relies in Valium to manage her undiagnosed muscle spasms\n\nDion told Hoda that she was taking high doses of diazepam, also known as Valium, to relax her body and be able to perform when she was struggling with muscle spasms — which had not yet been diagnosed as stiff person syndrome.\n\n\"I did not know, honestly, that it could kill me,” she said. “I would take, for example, before a performance, 20 milligrams of Valium, and then just walking from my dressing room to backstage, it was gone already.\"\n\n\"You get used to it. It doesn’t work,” she recalled, adding that she then needed more. She was taking 90 milligrams a day at one point, an amount that can be lethal.\n\nShe said she weened herself of the medication and others with the help of doctors during the pandemic.\n\n2020: Dion starts to seek answers for health issues\n\nFor many years, Dion didn’t understand what was causing her symptoms and was also juggling the responsibility of caring for Angélil, who died in 2016 of throat cancer.\n\n“We did not know what was going on. I did not take the time. I should have stopped, take the time to figure it out,” she told Hoda. “My husband as well was fighting for his own life. ... I had to raise my kids. I had to hide. I had to try to be a hero. \"\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, she started to search for answers. “It probably sounds very strange to say this to you, but when I was diagnosed, I was happy. I was finally able to move with the wave, not against it,” she told Vogue.\n\n2021: Dion delays reopening her Las Vegas residency\n\nDion announced in October 2021 that she was delaying the opening of her new Las Vegas residency show due to medical issues.\n\nA press release explained that she was “experiencing severe and persistent muscle spasms which are preventing her from performing.\"\n\nJanuary 2022: Dion cancels the remaining shows in the North American leg of her world tour\n\nA few months later, Dion had to cancel the North American leg of her world tour. A statement posted on her website attributed to the change to ongoing muscle spasms and her recovery \"taking longer than she hoped.\"\n\nApril 2022: Dion postpones her world tour again\n\n“Well, here we are again, and I’m so sorry we have to change our tour plans for Europe one more time,\" Dion said in a video posted to her Instagram announcing the scheduling change.\n\n\"First, we had to move the shows because of the pandemic, now this is my health issues that is causing us to postpone some shows and unfortunately we have to cancel some too.”\n\nShe added that the “good news” is she’s “doing a little bit better.”\n\nDecember 2022: Dion publicly shares her stiff person syndrome diagnosis\n\nDion shared the news that she had been diagnosed with stiff person syndrome with fans for the first time in an Instagram video posted Dec. 8, 2022. At the time, Celine Dion also rescheduled her spring 2023 shows to 2024 and canceled eight of her summer 2023 shows.\n\nExplaining why she decided to share, she told Hoda: “I didn’t want to live in this bunker anymore ... because the burden was so heavy. And I was like, ‘OK, I need to just do what I need to do to do the best. But I need to also tell the world what’s happening.”\n\n2023: Dion officially cancels the remainder of her world tour\n\nOn May 26, 2023, she officially canceled the rest of her world tour due to her health issues.\n\n“I’m so sorry to disappoint all of you once again,” she said in a statement. “I’m working really hard to build back my strength, but touring can be very difficult even when you’re 100%. It’s not fair to you to keep postponing the shows, and even though it breaks my heart, it’s best that we cancel everything now until I’m really ready to be back on stage again. I want you all to know, I’m not giving up… and I can’t wait to see you again!”\n\nApril 2024: Dion opens up about her stiff person syndrome treatments\n\nShe shared some of her stiff person syndrome treatment plan in an interview with Vogue France, including various therapies five days a week.\n\n“I work on my toes, my knees, my calves, my fingers, my singing, my voice,” she said. “Either I train like an athlete and work super hard, or I switch off and it’s over, I stay at home, listen to my songs, stand in front of my mirror and sing to myself.”\n\n“I’ve chosen to work with all my body and soul, from head to toe, with a medical team. I want to be the best I can be. My goal is to see the Eiffel Tower again!”\n\nJune 2024: Dion sits down for her broadcast interview since announcing her diagnosis\n\nDion gave an in-depth look at her journey with stiff person syndrome, from her earliest symptoms to her efforts to perform again, when speaking with Hoda for the June 11 primetime special.\n\nHer intimate documentary came out on June 25 on Prime Video.\n\nJuly 2024: Dion performs for the first time since 2020\n\nDion surprised fans with an emotional performance from the Eiffel Tower at the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics. She sang a stunning rendition of Edith Piaf's “L’Hymne à L’Amour.” The song was originally released in 1950 following the 1949 death of Piaf’s lover Marcel Cerdan in a plane crash."
