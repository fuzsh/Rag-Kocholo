        "text": "Often referred to as \"The Black National Anthem,\" Lift Every Voice and Sing was a hymn written as a poem by NAACP leader James Weldon Johnson in 1900. His brother, John Rosamond Johnson (1873-1954), composed the music for the lyrics. A choir of 500 schoolchildren at the segregated Stanton School, where James Weldon Johnson was principal, first performed the song in public in Jacksonville, Florida to celebrate President Abraham Lincoln's birthday.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Johnson's lyrics eloquently captured the solemn yet hopeful appeal for the liberty of Black Americans. Set against the religious invocation of God and the promise of freedom, the song was later adopted by NAACP and prominently used as a rallying cry during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nLift Every Voice and Sing Lyrics\n\nLift every voice and sing,\n\n'Til earth and heaven ring,\n\nRing with the harmonies of Liberty;\n\nLet our rejoicing rise\n\nHigh as the list'ning skies,\n\nLet it resound loud as the rolling sea.\n\nSing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,\n\nSing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us;\n\nFacing the rising sun of our new day begun,\n\nLet us march on 'til victory is won.\n\nStony the road we trod,\n\nBitter the chastening rod,\n\nFelt in the days when hope unborn had died;\n\nYet with a steady beat,\n\nHave not our weary feet\n\nCome to the place for which our fathers sighed?\n\nWe have come over a way that with tears has been watered,\n\nWe have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered,\n\nOut from the gloomy past,\n\n'Til now we stand at last\n\nWhere the white gleam of our bright star is cast.\n\nGod of our weary years,\n\nGod of our silent tears,\n\nThou who has brought us thus far on the way;\n\nThou who has by Thy might\n\nLed us into the light,\n\nKeep us forever in the path, we pray.\n\nLest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee,\n\nour hearts drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee;\n\nShadowed beneath Thy hand,\n\nMay we forever stand,\n\nTrue to our God,\n\nTrue to our native land."
