An exhortation to praise God for his mercies\n\n7. for his care of the church\n\n19. for his great works\n\n(4) Sing praises . . .--Better, play on the harp.\n\nExtol him that rideth upon the heavens.--Rather, cast up a highway for him that rideth on the steppes. (Comp. Isaiah 40:3, of which this is apparently an echo.) The poet's voice is the herald's who precedes the army of God to order the removal of all obstructions, and the formation of cairns to mark the road. Isaiah 57:14; Isaiah 62:10, are passages alluding to the same custom.\n\nThe translation, \"upon the heavens,\" rests on a rabbinical interpretation of 'araboth.\n\nBy derivation it means \"a dry sandy region,\" a \"steppe.\" The singular of the noun forms with the article a proper name designating the Jordan valley. (In the poetical books, however, any wild tract of country is called 'Arabah--Isaiah 35:1; Isaiah 35:6.) The plural often designates particular parts of this region, as the plains of Moab or Jericho (2Kings 25:4-5). Such a restricted sense is quite in keeping with the allusions to the early history which make up so much of the psalm. . . .\n\nVerse 4. - Sing unto God, sing praises to his Name (comp. Psalm 64:4): extol him that rideth upon the heavens. This passage is now generally translated, Cast up a highway for him that rideth through the deserts (Hengstenberg, Kay, Dean Johnson, Professor Cheyne, Revised Version). The image is that of a king travelling through a waste, for whom a way was made beforehand (comp. Isaiah 40:3; Isaiah 49:11). By his name Jah; rather, Jah is his Name. \"Jah\" - the shortened form of \"Jehovah\" - occurs first in the Song of Moses (Exodus 15:2). It is repeated here in ver. 18, and recurs in Isaiah 26:4. Dr. Kay suggests that \"it represents the concentration of God's redeeming power and love.\" And rejoice before him (comp. ver. 3).
