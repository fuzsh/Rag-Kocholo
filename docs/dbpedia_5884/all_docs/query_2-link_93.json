That got me to singing this.....anyone remember it?? (My Dad was an Eastern pilot in those days)\n\nIf you had wings!\n\nIf you had wings!\n\nIf you had wings..had wings..had wings....\n\nOh, I remember it. A great attraction from the early days - because it didn't require a ticket. And from that same era:\n\nNow is the time.\n\nNow is the best time.\n\nNow is the best time of your life.\n\nLife is a prize, live every minute.\n\nOpen your eyes and watch how you win it.\n\nYesterday's memories may sparkle and gleam,\n\ntomorrow is still but a dream.\n\nRight here and now,\n\nyou've got it made.\n\nThe world's forward marching and you're in the parade!\n\nNow is the time.\n\nNow is the best time.\n\nBe it a time of joy or strife.\n\nThere's so much to cheer for, be glad you're here.\n\nFor it's the best time of your life."
