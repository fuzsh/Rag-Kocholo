        "text": "Its official title is “Hey! Baby,” but Bruce Channel’s 1961 chart-topper is probably more easily recognized in print if you write it like this: “Heeeeeeeeey Baby!”\n\nYou’re singing it in your head now, aren’t you? “Hey, baby/ I wanna know/ If you’ll be my girl.”\n\nBefore it became a high school and college marching band staple, “Hey! Baby” was a fixture of John Lennon’s personal jukebox. The record’s long “Hey!” and the harmonica playing by a young Delbert McClinton inspired several early Beatles songs, including “Love Me Do.\"\n\nAnd before all that, Channel and co-writer Margaret Cobb were a couple of friends in Texas “just trying to write everything we could write,” unwittingly crafting a song that’s still being shouted out loud, nearly 60 years later. Channel told the Story Behind the Song to Bart Herbison of Nashville Songwriters Association International.\n\nBart Herbison: Well, I don’t know how else to start off this interview other than to say, “Hey, baby.”\n\nBruce Channel: “Hey, baby.”\n\nBH: Well, take us back. You and a co-writer wrote this song — (her name was) Margaret Cobb — in 1961. Take us back and tell us the story behind “Hey! Baby.”\n\nBC: My brother worked for a company called Texas Tank, a manufacturer of butane tanks. I went over there, and he talked to his boss and they gave me a job. I was about 17. I worked there for a while and I met a guy named Buddy Combs. Buddy was a guitar player and we would pick together.\n\nHe said, “I want you to meet my sister. Her name is Margaret and she's a songwriter.” He took me over to Margaret's house and I met her. I started going there and hanging out. Buddy would come play guitar sometimes and I'd do little gigs here and there. Buddy would play guitar with me. He was an excellent guitar player. Margaret and I were trying to write songs, so that's how our association started. We tried 20, 30 songs together over a few years. “Hey! Baby” was one of those.\n\nBH: But how do they get from you and her writing one of 20 songs &mldr; (to where) you ended up getting (“Hey! Baby\")? I think first (there is) a local record deal, then a big record deal, and then pretty soon in 1962, the whole world knew about the song. How did that part happen?\n\nBC: After about a year, Barbara Montgomery says to me, “Look, I've been working in the studios with a lot of different people — I worked with this guy in Fort Worth who is a retired major in the Air Force who dabble(d) in the record business. He had some success with a (song) called ‘Peanuts.’ \"\n\n(Bruce sings) “Peanuts, ah-ah-ah” by the Teen Kings. Anyway, she said, \"Take two or three songs and go over on Saturday and play them for him. And I’m telling you, he’ll cut them.”\n\nThat Saturday, I took my guitar and went to Bill's house. &mldr; I played him \"Hey! Baby” and he liked it. I played him “Dream Girl” and other songs that I'd written. He said, “Yeah, I like those. We’ll get some studio time and do them next week.” So, I was happy, but I didn't exactly know what was going to happen going in the studio next week.\n\nWhen we showed up at the studio the next week, I met Delbert McClinton with the Straight Jackets. They played with all the great blues players that covered Fort Worth. &mldr; I showed the other guys what I was going to do with my guitar and then we did a take. Marvin (Montgomery, musical director) said, “Let's try it one more time.” So, we did it again. Then Marvin says, “Wait a minute. It needs a spine. It needs a piano.” He came in and played the piano with us. He played those really straight parts that made the rest of the looseness really jell together later. The feel of it was different because the bass in the band and the beat was right on. Everybody else wants to (sing) “Hey, hey,” but he's the straight beat.\n\nBH: I'm so glad y'all did that last tape because then we get “Hey! Baby,” that we know as one of the greatest records ever.\n\nBC: It came out in November of ‘61. I played a New Year's Eve gig with Delbert in the Straight Jackets in a big club in Fort Worth. During the times of the New Year's Eve, it took it from November of ‘61 to March 10 of ’62, it was No. 1.\n\nBH: I think it was a three- or four-week No. 1, wasn't it?\n\nBC: Yes, and that's when I was booked for the national tour. It was about No. 47 with a “bullet,\" they used to say. I got booked to do this tour with the band, Fats Domino and all these people. When I got back they said, “OK, we need you to go to England.” I said, “OK, I'm more than willing to go to England and play, but Delbert has got to go with me.” They agreed he could, but we couldn't take the whole band.\n\nBH: Wow.\n\nBC: It was too expensive back in that day. Nobody would haul in a whole band anywhere.\n\nBH: Now when you're in England, don't you meet The Beatles? Here's the story I always heard. I think y'all were playing a show together or maybe you just met them, you tell me, but that John Lennon learned how to play harmonica from Delbert. Then pretty soon you started hearing that on a couple of Beatles records.\n\nBC: We played this one place and I'd been on the BBC and did an interview. These guys showed up and there wasn't enough time for them to be on, and I apologized for taking up so much time. Anyway, so we go on and this (Bruce shows a poster to the camera), it says, “Bruce Channel with Delbert McClinton direct from America.”\n\nBH: I love that your name's bigger than The Beatles on that thing.\n\nBC: They didn't have any records and certainly not written any of the songs that they did. But everybody knew they were a good band and they already had a riff with the kids, and it was packed where they would play anyway. But here (we are) in the dressing room (Bruce shows photo) that night at that show.\n\nBH: Wow, look at you guys. I certainly see you and I see Delbert.\n\nBC: That's (original Beatles drummer) Pete Best.\n\nBH: I was going to say that's Pete before Ringo. This is amazing, man.\n\nBC: This is about two weeks or so before Ringo.\n\nBH: Now the song, Bruce, has had a shelf life now of 60 years. Every time I see you play it, I don't care if somebody in the audience is 14 or they’re 80, they just know that song. It's one of those handful of songs that everybody in the world knows. Did that surprise you back then? And does it still surprise you today?\n\nBC: It surprised me then, and it still surprises me now. High school marching bands do it. I’m so honored that the different generations have liked it so much. I couldn't ask for more, you know, and I won't. It was too much to ask for anyway.\n\nThat song was No. 1 three times. One by me first, then by Anne Murray, and by D.J. Otzi. It was in “Dirty Dancing” and 10 or 11 other movies. &mldr; That song had legs that nobody knew about.\n\nBH: I know you'd written a lot of songs. Did you have any idea how special this one was?\n\nBC: No, because we were just trying to write everything we could write. I mean, it felt good. &mldr; My brother and I would sing it with a friend of ours. We’d get in his car and drive around to help him throw his papers. We’d act like we was one of the groups off the \"Dick Clark Show\" or something. (Bruce sings) “Baby, would you be my girl?”\n\nAbout the series\n\nIn partnership with Nashville Songwriters Association International, the \"Story Behind the Song\" video interview series features Nashville-connected songwriters discussing one of their compositions.
