        "text": "Sure, you can spend your Friday night getting drunk at a\n\nfraternity and hooking up with some random person, but\n\nwouldn’t you rather sing cheesy pop in front of\n\nstrangers?\n\nThe UCLA Karaoke Club has been belting out the hits since the\n\nbeginning of the quarter. The erstwhile crooners have been meeting\n\nevery other Friday night in Ackerman 201A.\n\n“We just do it for fun,” said Sandra Chen, a\n\nsecond-year biochemistry student and president of the Karaoke Club.\n\nHer favorite song to sing in front of her friends is R.\n\nKelly’s song “I Believe I Can Fly.”\n\nAfter receiving sponsorships from companies such as Fuji Link,\n\nDTS Karaoke, Ace Karaoke, and Sing Young rental store, the founders\n\ndecided to establish their UCLA Karaoke Club on campus to avoid the\n\nlaborious task of performing at bars.\n\n“(Karaoke clubs) are expensive, and there’s no\n\nfood,” Chen said.\n\nThe UCLA Karaoke Club, which usually attracts about 20 people to\n\nits gatherings, offers a mellow atmosphere so people to feel free\n\nand comfortable to perform their favorite songs and not be vexed by\n\nan intimidating crowd.\n\n“No one needs to sing alone, or sing well, or at\n\nall,” said Chen.\n\nFeaturing both popular American singles and hit Chinese songs,\n\nthe club offers a diverse selection of music for anyone willing to\n\nstep up and embrace their inner Frank Sinatra.\n\nThough singing in front of as many as 20 people may seem\n\ndaunting, the Karaoke Club seeks to create a low-stress\n\nenvironment. Only one of the members, undeclared second-year\n\nstudent Emily Lin, has any experience performing seriously.\n\nMost simply enjoy singing with their friends and generally\n\nhaving a good time, though according to Chen they have yet to\n\n“see anyone get crazy.” Often participants split time\n\nsinging and laughing along with their chosen track if they\n\ndon’t know all of the lyrics.\n\nFor additional entertainment options the club offers several\n\nkaraoke-related games to accompany the typical musical performance.\n\nIt has musical Pictionary, during which the chosen person has to\n\nact out the title of a song, and, if he fails to get people to\n\nguess correctly, sing it. In addition there is musical charades, in\n\nwhich one person listens to a song on headphones and has to act out\n\nthe lyrics and try to get the rest of the club to get the song.\n\nThough such public performance might be easier for some after a\n\ncouple of drinks, the officers of the club frown upon consumption\n\nof alcohol at their events.\n\n“You can bring your own; we’ll pretend we\n\ndidn’t see it,” Chen said.\n\nThe Karaoke Club has yet to find that perfect romantic pair to\n\nsing a song like “A Whole New World.” In fact, the\n\nmembership is almost entirely female, though the members would\n\nwelcome more Aladdins to sing with their Jasmines.\n\n“There are a lot more girls than guys,” said Chen.\n\n“Nevertheless there are plenty of enticements for any\n\ninterested male singers.”\n\nSuch enticements may include videos that play behind the lyrics\n\nof the songs and consist mostly of young, attractive women\n\nattempting to look sensual at places like the beach.\n\nThough it hasn’t yet nailed down dates for next\n\nquarter’s meetings, and although spending money and public\n\ninterest remain pressing concerns, the club remains optimistic\n\nabout the future and is planning events for the near future.\n\n“We might have a club dinner,” Chen said. “We\n\nplan on continuing regular meetings every two weeks next\n\nquarter.”\n\nWhile the regular membership remains low, the members’\n\nspirits remain high."
