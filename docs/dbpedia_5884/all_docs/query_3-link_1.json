        "text": "“ Sometimes in life you got to, sing it louder! ”\n\n— Theme song for the show.\n\nSing It Louder ! !\n\nLogo of the show\n\nCast\n\nLiv Rooney\n\nRuby\n\nPriya\n\nGenre\n\nMusical, comedy-drama\n\nPreceded by\n\nSing It Loud!\n\nFilmed\n\nLos Angeles\n\nSing It Louder!! (sometimes abbreviated as SIL!!) is a spin-off to Sing It Loud! that Liv Rooney and Ruby star in, in season 4. It is filmed in Hollywood, Los Angeles like Sing It Loud! was. Just like Voltage, it is directed by Gemma Nimbus.\n\nTo see more fictional movies and TV shows, see Filmography.\n\nPlot[]\n\nThe plot seems to involve a therapeutic boarding school in which children who broke the law were sent to the school to rehabilitate themselves. Based on the pilot episode and the fact in Sing It Louder!!-A-Rooney, Liv (as Stephanie Einstein) said when she went to that school, it appears Stephanie Einstein graduated from this school and returned home, but returned to serve as a mentor for the main protagonist, Sasha who was sent here for breaking an unknown law which she refuses to tell about.\n\nFeatured Songs[]\n\nOne Second Chance\n\nPower Of Two\n\nMy Destiny\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThis is a spin-off to Sing It Loud!.\n\nLiv stars in this show with her cousin, Ruby, in season 4.\n\nThis is the fourth show Liv has starred in after, Sing It Loud!, Space Werewolves, and Voltage.\n\nJust like Voltage, it's directed by Gemma Nimbus.\n\nThe main show's laugh track does not interrupt scenes of Sing it Louder\n\nIt is on the same network as Linda and Heather, according to Linda and Heather-A-Rooney.\n\nStephanie is the mentor to Sasha, who is the main character in the show.\n\nRuby was cast as Sasha.\n\nMuch like Sing It Loud!, the name of the show is always sung, except it takes longer to sing and has more notes.\n\nSasha is Stephanie Einstein's long-lost younger sister.\n\nThe series revolves around the driving question as to why Sasha was sent to the boarding school.\n\nThe cast did a live episode in Sing It Live!!!-A-Rooney, where Johnny Nimbus played a character and spoke directly to the live audience during filming as the host. This is a reference to Grease Live!, a live TV production of the movie, Grease, where Mario Lopez hosted the show and also played the role of Vince Fontaine.\n\nSince Stephanie and Sasha are long lost sisters, Sasha said she had a necklace with half a heart on it, saying the other half belonged to Stephanie. Sasha also said the necklace was given to her by her dying mother, which hints that Bree DuMont's character Alberta Einstein was possibly killed off in 'Sing It Loud!'.\n\nCast[]\n\nRuby as Sasha\n\nLiv Rooney as Stephanie Einstein\n\nPriya as Priya\n\nJohnny Nimbus as Larabee Peasley\n\nGallery[]"
