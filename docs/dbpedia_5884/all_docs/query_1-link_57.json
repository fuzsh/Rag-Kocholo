        "text": "Scared to Sing?\n\nThere was this girl.\n\nShe was young, pretty, and quite insecure about herself.\n\nSinging was her biggest passion in life, consuming her mind at all hours of the day. All she wanted to do was sing.\n\nShe fought many voices in her head telling her she wasn’t good enough, that nobody wanted to hear her sing. Most days, she let those voices dictate her choices about her singing.\n\nPerhaps you are all too familiar with this scenario.\n\nMany people that I know who love to sing are scared to sing out. They are scared to learn the necessary skills to overcome any fears they may have about singing.\n\nThere might be a science behind it, but you may also just be psyching yourself out. Oftentimes stress before or during singing is linked back to a traumatic event in your life. Other times it’s simply holding on to negative feedback you may have gotten at one time or another.\n\nIf you have ever heard the song “Shy” from Once Upon a Mattress, you know it’s unusual. As a listener, you fully expect the song to be quiet and timid, and then it turns out to be the complete opposite.\n\nThat is exactly where you want to be when you find yourself ready to perform. But it’s not that easy, is it?\n\nScared of Singing in Front of People\n\nHow do you know if you have stage fright? A description from this article sums up what it feels like:\n\n“Stage fright is a phobia that produces a symphony of coordinated biological reactions. Muscles contract, priming the body with bursts of energy. Blood vessels in the extremities constrict, resulting in tingling and numbness. An increase in heart rate produces sweat. Stage fright is the body’s natural alarm response to emergency situations”\n\nWhile there is not a specific word to describe the fear of singing (in front of people or not), glossophobia refers to a fear of public speaking. This fear is quite similar in that you put yourself and your ideas (or in this case, your voice) out in public for others to scrutinize.\n\nDoes this sound like you?\n\nSome people love to sing, just not in front of people. There is something extremely intimidating about pairs’ of eyes watching you. It might make a difference for you if it’s a small crowd or a large gathering. For some singers, it could be just one person that throws them off.\n\nYou are wondering if they are judging how you sound, or if you spilled something on your shirt and they are silently laughing at you.\n\nI guarantee that’s not what they are thinking. Chances are, they are jealous of your ability. They admire your courage for being able to sing in front of people because that is something they would never dare to do.\n\nIt is hard to believe that people really think like that. But it can also be a reason we sing quieter than our natural voice allows us to."
