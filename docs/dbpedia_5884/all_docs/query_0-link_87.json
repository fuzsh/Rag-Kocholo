        "text": "Try These Songs When You Want to Get Loud\n\nAre you ready to get loud? Singing along to your favorite songs can be unbelievably liberating and satisfying, whether you’re hollering in the confines of your bathroom, banging on the desk while waiting for the work day to end, or bumping the car radio on your way home in traffic.\n\nSuch is the power of music, but all songs aren’t created equal. There are those that you can’t do justice to unless you’re seriously extending your vocal chords, never mind the fact that you might be sounding off key. You know those songs, right? Sure you do. Just in case you need help coming up with a playlist of scream-your-head-off songs, here are 22 that we guarantee you have to sing at the top of your lungs.\n\n1. Tubthumping (I Get Knocked Down) – Chumbawamba\n\nWe begin with an all-time classic from this British pop/rock group. “Tubthumping” landed on the airwaves in 1997 and became a global smash and club banger although there aren’t much lyrics to go on. Well, when you’re shouting “I get knocked down / But I get up again / You’re never gonna keep me down,” you don’t have to say much else to get the crowd rocking.\n\n2. Since You Been Gone – Kelly Clarkson\n\nA better-after-breakup anthem for many, this number by Kelly Clarkson is bound to leave you feeling liberated as you rip through lyrics such as “Since you been gone/ I can breathe for the first / I’m so movin’ on, yeah, yeah!”\n\n3. Boom Clap – Charli XCX\n\nA lighthearted love song, “Boom Clap” is the perfect teenage sing-along song for any occasion. Sounds pretty explosive too, with lyrics like “Boom! Clap! The sound of my heart / The beat goes on and on and on and on…”\n\n4. So What – P!nk\n\nFresh from her marriage breakup, P!nk was in quite a stormy mood and let it all hang out in this rant of a song. Whether you’re going through similar heartbreak or not, it’s a great tune for an excuse to get noisy. Best lyrics: “Na-na-na-na-na-na-na I wanna start a fight/ Na-na-na-na-na-na-na I WANNA START A FIGHT!”\n\n5. I Hate Everything About You – Three Days Grace\n\nSo, this song is probably a bit confusing with lyrics such as “I hate everything about you / Why do I love you,” but it quickly comes together after screaming out the chorus one or two times.\n\n6. 24K Magic – Bruno Mars\n\nBruno Mars did start this song by saying “Tonight, I just want to take you higher” and that’s just what he does with “24K Magic.” Whether you’re singing or talking along, you just have to do it loud to “keep up.”\n\n7. My Songs Know What You Did In The Dark (Light Em Up) – Fall Out Boy\n\nWith this song, it’s all about bringing what’s in the dark out into the open – and being pretty loud about it at the same time.\n\n8. I Write Sins Not Tragedies – Panic! At The Disco\n\nThis satirical track is not just upbeat; it gets you to think about conversations that you’d have preferred not hearing. Whether it gets you to remember an awkward situation or not, it’s a fun, sing-along track.\n\n9. Fire Meet Gasoline – Sia\n\n“Fire meet gasoline / I’m burning alive” are two of the passionate lines from this combustible track from Sia that she sings at a rather high octave. It’s a song about an intense love, forcing you to sing it with a matching heat.\n\n10. Poker Face – Lady Gaga\n\nOne of Lady Gaga’s huge breakout songs, “Poker Face” is a genuine club anthem that is great for long drives and just letting your hair hang out.\n\n11. Only Girl (In The World) – Rihanna\n\nRi-ri is demanding that she be treated like she’s number 1…sorry…like she’s the 'only one' with this playful number. It’s a song that you can really sing aloud to when you want to feel like the \"only girl in the world.”\n\nBE SURE TO FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR SIMILAR ARTICLES AND ADDED ENTERTAINMENT WHEN YOU’RE PRETENDING TO WORK. ;-)\n\n12. Bring Me To Life – Evanescence\n\nIt’s hard not to get lost in just how awesome Amy Lee’s voice is on this track. It’s also hard not to sing it with all your might, especially with all the passion of the choruses and bridge.\n\n13. Numb – Linkin Park\n\nLinkin Park is known for songs that are deep and personal but yet you can’t help screaming the words out loud. That’s the effect presented with lyrics like “I’ve become so numb / I can’t feel you there…” Also, check out the remix with Jay-Z if you’re looking for a different flavor that gives similar results.\n\n14. Yeah! – Usher feat. Lil Jon, Ludacris\n\nBack when Usher was the prince of R&B, he teamed up with loud rapper, Lil Jon, and Ludacris to create this club banger. It’s really about flirting on the dance floor (Usher’s famous for those type of songs), but it’s also a song that you can’t help screaming out “Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah…yeah!” to.\n\n15. Not Afraid – Eminem\n\nAn overdose of lyrics and fast-spitting is guaranteed from ace rapper, Eminem, on many of his tracks, but “Not Afraid” takes his craft to another level. In addition to turning you into a ‘rap god,’ singing/rapping along to this track is potent enough to give you the courage to say enough is enough if needs be.\n\n16. We Will Rock You – Queen\n\nThis 1977 hit by Queen is one of those songs that are guaranteed to get a crowd moving. No wonder why it’s often played in stadiums at big sporting events. So if the party’s dead, just start stomping and screaming “We will, we will, rock you!”\n\n17. It’s My Life – Bon Jovi\n\nCall it self-empowerment or self-assurance, but this track “ain’t a song for the broken-hearted.” It’s about living your life to the fullest (and singing your heart out while you’re at it).\n\n18. They Don’t Care About Us – Michael Jackson\n\nMJ did a number of songs that spoke out against unjust world happenings and “They Don’t Care About Us” was probably the most vocal. It’s hard not to feel a sense of purpose (and rebellion) when you’re chanting “All I want to say is that / They don't really care about us” when you really have something to say against whatever is going on in your neck of the woods.\n\n19. Hey Ya! – OutKast\n\n“Hey Ya!” is not just a song that you want to sing out loud to, it also makes you want to just dance and act crazy. Plus, it’s really simple to sing along to with a chorus that just repeats “Hey ya! Hey ya!” and with lyrics such as “So why you, why you why you, why you, why you are we so in denial.” A good way to have loads of fun singing, wouldn’t you agree?\n\n20. Mr. Brightside – The Killers\n\n“It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss.” That’s one of the simple but potent lyrics that make up this sad, yet up-tempo song by The Killers. It has lyrics that most people can relate to. No wonder why “Mr. Brightside” is also a song that you can’t help but rock out to.\n\n21. Zombie – The Cranberries\n\nA protest song that was released in 1994 after an incident of war that left two children dead in England, “Zombie” is all anguish and passion and powerful vocals. But it is also quite poetic and appropriate for many of the seemingly senseless acts that are caused by wars.\n\n22. Love Me Again – John Newman\n\nJohn Newman is all heart as he asks “I need to know now, know now / Can you love me again?” As such, there’s only one way to sing it to get the same effect: loud.\n\nThat’s it; your list of tracks that you can’t help but sing loud. Obviously, there are many other songs you could add when you're creating or expanding your own playlist, but this is a start you can build on."
