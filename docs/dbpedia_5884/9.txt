Sing it Loud Choir - what to expect as a member!

We aim to be a friendly, inclusive choir and do our best to welcome and support new members to feel at home in the choir

We don't ask you to audition, however to find your natural place in the choir you will be asked to sing a few notes with our Musical Director at the piano at your first or second rehearsal.

An ability to read music, or previous choir experience is helpful, but not necessary

Singing technique is taught in the course of rehearsals

We memorise our songs over the course of the season and perform without sheet music

To support you with learning the songs we provide sheet music (on loan), electronic guide tracks and CDs (if required), to help with memorising the songs

These learning aids along with all rehearsal and performance costs are included in your membership fees - see below

Extra (optional) singing practice is offered in small groups, usually in a member's home, a few times each season

As a new member you can expect to get support and guidance from the Section Captain of your voice part in the choir, and from a friendly group of singers around you

We support a local charity chosen by choir members - this takes the form of fundraising events, choir socials and public donations at our performances

We have chosen the Friendship Project for Children as our local charity for 2024. Find out more about the charity on The Friendship Project website.
