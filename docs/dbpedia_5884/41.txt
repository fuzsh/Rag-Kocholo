Sing it Louder!!!!! Ah ah ah~

When I went Monahan Academy I was a scared little girl who needed help but now a scared little girl needed my help

~ Stephanie

"Hey!.... It's Stephanie I brought Coco"

Giggles

"Come on talk to me Sasha" As Stephanie Worried

Sasha arises from the bush

"Did you bring marshmellos?"

"We were out" Stephanie says sadly

"Then I'll be in my plant" Sasha says

"Why are you hiding?"asks Stephanie

"Because... I'm new and I don't want people to know what I did to make the judge send me here" Sasha Explained

As Stephanie helps Sasha get up from the bush

"Sasha everyone here has done Somthing wrong

So come on we don't you tell what it is what you did"

"I cant..."

Sasha immediately says

"I don't want people to know I'm bad"

"You know what Sasha...

Somtimes all you need is one second chance" Stephanie says

[Stephanie:]

I should never have tagged the principal's car

And surely not signed my name

How I hated this place when I first arrived

But now I'm glad I came

Found out that I'm not alone

People make mistakes

Make amends, find new friends

One second chance is all it takes

Yeah

One second chance is all it takes

He stole a backpack, a bike and a boat

Just wanted some souvenirs

She sold all her mom's shoes

Ditched the seventh grade

He pierced his parakeet's ears

[Sasha:]

What they did was not so bad

[Stephanie:]

Did I mention a car full of snakes?

[Both:]

Realign, you'll be fine

One second chance is all it takes

Yeah

[Both:]

One second chance is all it takes

[Stephanie:]

Whatever happened, we'll understand

Here we're judgement-free

[Sasha:]

I just can't tell my tale

[Stephanie:]

Your secret's safe with me, safe with me

Girl, you need a hand or a shoulder, a knee

Something to help you feel strong

[Sasha:]

I'm not gonna talk, see these lips are sealed

Now everyone run along

[Stephanie:]

You are not a rotten kid

[Sasha:]

And I've made some humongous mistakes

Yeah

[Stephanie:]

I got through, you can too

[Both:]

One second chance is all it takes

Yeah

One second chance

[Stephanie:]

Is all it takes

"So what you do?" Stephanie says sighly

"Still not telling" As Sasha walks away

~~~~~The Next Day~~~~~

Fitting in any school is hard the good news about Monahan Academy we wear uniforms atleast we blend in the bad news there's always that one girl who singles you out ~Sasha

As everyone at the tables looks as Sasha

As Priya stands up

And talks to Sasha "Ok new girl now's your chance to prove your one of us"

As one of the girls passes a chest to Priya "This is a months worth of toenail clippings"

"Gross.." Sasha Says in disgust

"Put them in Stephanie's soup!" Priya says

"Why would I do that?" Stephanie asks

Priya answers

"Every new kid punks the dorms big sis and the girl who tells you what to do tells you to do it"

As Sasha says to her self

Do I punk Stephanie Einstein the one person who's been nice to me? or do I tell Priya the head of the Hoover hall hoolangins to STICK IT IN HER EYE!

"Give me the toenails" Sasha says sadly

Sasha sighs

Come on people it's only for survival

Sasha says to herself

-------Later------

"Mhmm" Stephanie says eating the soup with toenails

Mhmm woah crunchy croutons today"

Stephanie says

As the other girls smile

As Stephanie's Face became confused while eating she says "Wait- a second these aren't crotons! IVE BEEN TOENAILED!"

As the girls laugh Stephanie laughs aslo
