        "text": "Biography Overview\n\nFrederick “Ricky” Pye III is an attorney with our Insurance Recovery Group. He focuses his practice on First Party Property Damage claims.\n\nRicky was born and raised in South Florida. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Central Florida and obtained his law degree from Nova Southeastern University College of Law. He began his practice of law with a defense firm representing homeowners insurance carriers.\n\nIn early 2018, Ricky began working on behalf of policyholders, representing individuals in an effort to challenge underpaid and denied claims. Ricky is a passionate advocate for his clients. He is cognizant of the power dynamics involved in any insurance claim and is well aware of the tactics that insurance claims often deploy to intimidate policyholders into accepting underpaid and denied claims. He takes pride in fighting for those who may not be able to fight for themselves – for the people.\n\nOutside of the office, Mr. Pye spends his time practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, golfing and with his beautiful wife Nicole and dog Kali."
