        "text": "A Letter from the President\n\nLast year I had the opportunity to visit all of the food pantries in DMARC’s Network. I sat outside most of them before I went in, just to watch the people going in and out. That experience reminded me of a quote from former General Mill Executive David Nasby:\n\n“Tonight, thousands of your neighbors will go to bed hungry. It may be your child’s schoolmate who is undernourished and has difficulty learning on an empty stomach. Or it could be a co-worker, a working mother whose low-wage job doesn’t make ends meet. Perhaps it’s an elderly neighbor who must make a decision whether to delay filling a prescription or buying groceries. The faces of hunger are as broad as the faces of America.”\n\nI saw those faces in our neighbors going into our pantries, but because of your support, what I saw coming out were people with healthy food to eat, and my hope is a better life because of it. I believe that when we provide healthy food to our neighbors that may otherwise go without, we are also building a stronger, safer, and healthier community for everyone.\n\nLooking ahead, the growth in demand we are experiencing to meet people’s most basic food needs is sobering, but it also allows us the chance to grow as a community.\n\nTo quote James Beard, “food is our common ground.” We all need it. From an interfaith perspective, bringing people together to fight food insecurity gives us the opportunity to use that common ground to create a greater spirit of empathy and collaboration in what is otherwise too often a divided and troubled world.\n\nWe can build a greater sense of community that we all benefit from through the spirit of empathy, giving, and collaboration demanded of us to ensure that none of our neighbors go hungry. Thank you for the opportunity to serve as part of that effort.\n\nJohn Whalin\n\nPresident, 2018-2019\n\nEngaging Corporate Partners\n\nCorporate engagement is an important part of any nonprofit’s work, including that of DMARC. But what does corporate engagement really mean? In today’s work environment, employees are looking for more than a “job.” They are looking for a work experience that includes an employer that is active in their community and that also provides opportunities for them to give back, often during the work day.\n\nSavvy employers know this well and understand that employee retention is important to their bottom line, so providing these opportunities and experiences is important to them, too. Not only do they want to help the communities in which they reside succeed, but they also want to be a caring member of their community. They also want to foster an active and engaged employee base, knowing that nonprofit experiences can build both camaraderie and leadership skills – both good things.\n\nLike many things, corporate engagement should not be viewed as a “one and done” type of exercise; rather it should be viewed as a continuum with many options for an organization to consider involvement with DMARC. A few include:\n\nCorporate volunteers – senior or staff level service to a committee, board, or special project\n\nGrant support – DMARC Food Pantry Network or other projects\n\nSponsorship – DMARC event or special need\n\nFund & food drive – special or seasonal promotion (holiday drive, Iowa vs. Iowa State tailgate drive, or other activity)\n\nMatching gifts – matching a personal gift by the corporate partner\n\nDMARC has long enjoyed support from the corporate community. Nearly 100 corporate partners provided over $100,000 in support to the DMARC Food Pantry Network. In total, nearly 70,000 volunteer hours were contributed to the DMARC Food Pantry Network, a value of $1.6 million.\n\nWhether building a putt-putt golf course with cans, having an Iowa vs. Iowa State friendly tailgate competition, or volunteering in our warehouse or at Stamp Out Hunger®, fun was an element in all.\n\nBut fun is just the beginning! DMARC is committed to building a positive relationship with our corporate partner’s one that helps them achieve their goals and one that provides an element of learning, too. We also want to build meaningful opportunities for our partners.\n\nOften the first thought that comes to mind when considering volunteer involvement is helping to sort food, but did you know that that is only one of many ways that corporate volunteers can help DMARC?\n\nSuccessful corporate engagement is not a one-sided endeavor. It means that both organizations know and understand what success looks like, from the other party’s view.\n\nThe landscape of corporate engagement is changing, and we believe for the better. We are always pleased when corporate partners want to understand more about the root causes of food insecurity in our community and what they can do to help in innovative ways. Because when we have a discussion, we can provide a more full understanding of the complexities of the issue. And we can learn about the unique ways they might be able to help.\n\nWant to learn more about how your company can begin a relationship with DMARC? Contact Leslie Garman, Director of Development & Outreach at (515) 277-6969 or lgarman@dmarcunited.org. We’d be excited to explore ways that work for you!\n\nStill Struggling to Make Ends Meet\n\nFor too many central Iowans, the economic recovery has never arrived. Even as our state reaches “full employment,” nearly 40% of people in Polk County are struggling to make ends meet, according to the United Way’s most recent ALICE report.\n\nAnd while wages are finally starting to see an increase, they are not keeping up with inflation. Essentials like housing, child care, energy, transportation, and health care have all risen in cost at a pace that has not been matched by increasing wages.\n\nIowa’s minimum wage currently sits at $7.25, and has not seen an increase since 2008. For Iowans who are facing increasing costs with no rising pay, the future looks uncertain.\n\nAccording to the ALICE report, Polk County has seen an increase in households struggling to meet their basic needs, from 26% of the population in 2012 to 36% of the population in 2016.\n\nIt’s something we’ve been seeing first-hand at DMARC. Since 2012, total visits to the DMARC Food Pantry Network have increased by 73%.\n\nOne of the major driving factors of this is lack of affordable housing. Currently, Polk County is about 8,000 homes short of affordable housing. In the Des Moines-West Des Moines metropolitan area, 17.8% of renters pay more than half of their monthly income in rent.\n\nIf the issues of rising costs of basic essentials and slow-growing wages are left unaddressed, those struggling economically in our community have a bleak future ahead of them.\n\nThat’s why reframing the narrative on poverty in our state and country is so important. Poverty exists because people don’t have enough money. Individual choices don’t keep people in a cycle of poverty, an unjust system does. And until that system is corrected, the DMARC Food Pantry Network will continue to see more and more people using food pantries to help feed their families."
