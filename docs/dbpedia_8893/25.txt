Howard Dietz, who put words to more than 500 songs, including such popular classics as ''Dancing in the Dark,'' ''That's Entertainment,'' and ''You and the Night and the Music,'' died of Parkinson's disease Saturday at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 86 years old.

Starting in 1918, Mr. Dietz became a regular supplier of lyrics for revues and musicals through the 1930's and the postwar years.

He collaborated with such composers as Jerome Kern, George Gershwin, and Vernon Duke. But after 1929, he wrote most of his songs with Arthur Schwartz. They collaborated on ''I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan,'' ''If There is Someone Lovelier Than You,'' ''Moanin' Low,'' ''Something to Remember You By,'' You and the Night and the Music'' and many other standards.

Last March, Mr. Dietz was honored as the first recipient of an annual Richard Rodgers award from ASCAP, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. The scroll was presented to him by Dorothy Rodgers, the widow of the composer.

The ceremony drew Lillian Gish, Betty Comden, Al Hirschfeld, Mr. Schwartz and other prominent artists. But it had to be held in Mr. Dietz's apartment because he was confined to bed, having suffered from Parkinson's disease for many years.

In 1919, Mr. Dietz joined the Goldwyn Pictures Corporation as its director of publicity and advertising, and continued in that position when a merger turned it into Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1924. Writing his lyrics chiefly in his spare time, he became a vice president of M-G-M in 1940.
