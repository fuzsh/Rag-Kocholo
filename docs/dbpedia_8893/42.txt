Howard Dietz (born Sept. 9, 1896, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died July 30, 1983, New York City) was an American motion-picture executive and songwriter.

After graduating from Columbia University in 1917, Dietz joined the Philip Goodman Advertising Agency, where he was assigned to devise a trademark for Goldwyn Pictures. Dietz used Columbia’s lion mascot as an inspiration for the Goldwyn studio’s “roaring lion” trademark, which thereafter appeared at the beginning of each film, including those made after Goldwyn Pictures merged with two other studios in 1924 to become Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) Corporation. Dietz also suggested the lion’s accompanying Latin motto, “Ars Gratia Artis”—“Art for Art’s Sake.” Dietz himself joined Goldwyn Pictures in 1919 and soon became director of advertising and publicity, a post that he retained in MGM until his retirement in 1957.
