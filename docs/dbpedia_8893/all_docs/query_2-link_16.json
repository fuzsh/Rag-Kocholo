        "text": "Here is the cherries jubilee of theatrical autobiographies. Howard Dietz has written, in the leanest of prose, a witty and at times most touching bridge between the Broadway stage and the Hollywood screen. He was there, he saw it all, he heard it all, he lived it all and he tells the stories like Scheherazade in “A Thousand and One Nights.”\n\nIn a volume that is thoughtfully and economically tight, as only a lyricist might turn out, the author of “Dancing in the Dark” tells the short story of his long life. New York born, New York bred, he has remained fairly consistently resident of this city from his early days in Yorkville until today where his apartment overlooks the new home of the performing arts in Manhattan, Lincoln Center.\n\nFirst, he writes of his meetings with the great newspapermen of his day, Arthur Brisbane, Herbert Bayard Swope Sr., Alexander Woollcott, F.P.A., and Harold Ross. Then he brings out the Broadway folk: the Marx Brothers, the Barrymores, the Gershwins, Helen Hayes, Charles MacArthur, Ben Hecht, George Kaufman, Marc Connelly, George Abbott, and of course, his own favorite tunesmith, Arthur Schwartz. Next come the little giants of Tinseltown U.S.A., the Schenks, Louis B. Mayer, Irving Thalberg; then Goldwyn, DeMille, Lubitsch, Tracy, Hepburn, Garbo—all of those one‐word ‐ one ‐ name people. Dietz's association with Hollywood came when the newly transplanted California film producers made it worth his talent as chief of the M‐G‐M publicity and advertising department.\n\nUnique as he is, Dietz leaves all of his wit unprotected on every page of this book. Thieves will be stealing it for the next 50 years. To do so here and now would be like taking that same old candy from that forever vulnerable baby.\n\nDietz does not allow himself the luxury of digging deeply. He slips in and out of his marriages to Betty Hall, a Barnard girl, and Tanis Guinness, British heiress, with the facility and ease of rhyming, “June” with “moon.” His third marriage to Lucinda Ballard, the theatrical designer, is a more permanent arrangement. Her two children by a previous marriage and his daughter Liza got along so well that the three of them planned Lucinda's and Howard's wedding.\n\nWorld War I and World War II are, to Dietz, outer layers of a sandwich, the meat of which is the Great Depression. It was a lark. Even the crippling Parkinson's disease that Dietz is presently fighting is made to seem a breeze with the drug L‐dopa.\n\nWith Libby Holman to sing his songs and Fred Astaire to dance to them, who in his properly and well‐ordered mind could conceivably ask for anything more? His book advises its readers that Dietz knew Samuel Goldfish when Goldfish was thinking of changing his name to fit that of his new partner, Arch Selwyn. To change it one way would have made the name Samuel Selfish. To change it another way made it Samuel Goldwyn!\n\n“A list of those who visited my house at various times sounded like ‘Who's Who.’ The names were so heavy you couldn't fail to drop them,” is a typical Dietzean line. “A day without Tallulah is like a weekend in the country,” is a typical Dietzean wisecrack.\n\nThe man who made Garbo's five words “I want to be alone” world‐famous is also the man who wrote the words to “The Band Wagon,” “The Little Show,” “Three's a Crowd,” and “Flying Colors.”\n\nAlan Jay Lerner penned an affectionate introduction to this book. He credits Dietz with being a walking reservoir of charm. “A warmer, wittier, more life‐loving, more life‐giving human being never came down the pike,” says the author of “My Fair Lady” and “Camelot.”\n\nIn reply, Dietz wrote, “Dear Alan, When I received your introduction to my book, I was in the hospital. When I finished reading the introduction, I went home.”\n\nThose two sentences are no more than almost any two lines in Mr. Dietz's book. As a theatrical memoir, undoubtedly it will be compared with Moss Hart's now classic “Act One.” It will not suffer in the test. Mr. Hart's book, according to its own title, served his readers only a portion of his life. Mr. Dietz offers us two and a half delicious acts.\n\nLater readers will be in position to compare “Dancing in the Dark,” with John Houseman's brilliant theatrical autobiography “Run‐Through.” Both Hart and Houseman wrote in a narrative style while Dietz chooses to reveal his work in an anecdotal manner.\n\nMore comparisons must be made. Dietz is not a great modern poet. Ezra Pound, Robert Frost and his friend Archibald MacLeish, to select three of his contemporaries, stand above him in the use of words. Still, in his own milieu, Dietz remains at the top. During the so‐called Golden Age of the American theater, when Oscar Hammerstein, Irving Berlin, and Cole Porter were writing the words for the music, Dietz admittedly was one of the four sides of the quadrangle."
