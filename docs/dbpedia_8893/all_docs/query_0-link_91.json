        "text": "William Koski Sr., age 76, of Jerome, MI, passed away on August 5, 2024. William was born on February 22, 1948 in Hartford, CT to James and Julia (Yeschanin) Koski.\n\nWilliam loved being outdoors and fishing, especially at his cabin in the Upper Peninsula, where he loved to go and spend time with his family. After his grandchildren were born, he spent countless hours drinking coffee and visiting with his family in the shade of the sugar maple tree he planted in Laura and Kyle’s backyard as a housewarming present 10 years ago.\n\nWilliam was a US Army veteran who served in the Vietnam War. After serving for our country, he relocated to Michigan where he enjoyed working for the Jackson County Sheriff’s Department for over 30 years. He was a member of the Eastern Michigan Camaro Club. He enjoyed working on and taking his Chevy Camaros to local car shows with fellow EMCC members.\n\nWilliam will be missed by his daughter, Laura (Kyle) Oberdorf; grandchildren, Juliann and Allison Oberdorf; also their grandmother, Diane Koski. He was preceded in death by his parents and a son, William Koski Jr.\n\nThe family will hold a private service at a later date.\n\nArrangements by Staffan-Mitchell Funeral Home."
