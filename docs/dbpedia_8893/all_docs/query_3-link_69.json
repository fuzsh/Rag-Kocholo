        "text": "This Dietz/Schwartz ballad has the same dark, romantic ambience and slow-moving, graceful melodic lines as their other well-known work, âDancing In the Dark,â but the tunes are very different in harmonic construction. This tune has a simple I – V7(b9) – I progression for the first eight measures, until the V becomes minor, turning into a ii of iv as the piece changes key temporarily (A7 – D7 – Gm in the original). This new key soon drops a minor third, however, leading into an unusual, but pleasing, harmonic sequence with a descending inner voice that makes it work from a voice-leading standpoint. In the original key, this is (from measure 9): Esus4 – E7 | Gm7 – C7 | Fmaj7 – Bbmaj7 |A7| Dmaj7|. On a keyboard, it will be noted how the suspended 4th of the initial E chord begins a line that descends in an exotic mode–one note change per chord change, this is A – G# - F – E – D –C#. âAâ also ends on the âpicardy third,â a parallel major chord.\n\nâBâ changes key to G minor by way of the dominant turning minor and thus into a ii7 of the new key (actually a iim7(b5) in which the b5 becomes the b9 of the new V7 chord – in this case, D7). The fifth of the new key of G minor drops a half step, turning it into yet another ii7 of the chord one step below (in the original F major.) Since the melody note is A here – the third degree of the key of the moment – a smooth common tone modulation is easily created by raising 5 and lowering 1 a half step. Because few melody notes land on chord extensions, jazz players have added many exotic harmonies and used different chord substitutions to this piece over the years.\n\nComment Policy\n\nYour comments are welcome, including why you like this tune, any musical challenges it presents, or additional background information.\n\nJazz musicians, fans, and students of all ages use this website as an educational resource.
