        "text": "By Scott Ross\n\nNote to my new “followers” in the Mossad and SBU who are unusually interested in a more or less harmless blog about old movies, presumably scheduling their visits here in between making threats to reporters, commentators, college students and international criminal courts: There is nothing in the installment below concerning either American-funded Banderite Nazis or Zionist psychotics, so you needn’t bother visiting this month… but thank you as always for your splendid interest.\n\nAs ever, click on the highlighted links for longer reviews &cet.\n\nThe Bohemian Girl (1936) For those of us who love Laurel and Hardy, the largest stumbling block to full enjoyment of their feature-length movies is pace. I don’t mean the comedians themselves. We accept that Stan and Ollie’s brand of humor, the way their characters react to each other, operates on a plane vastly different from most screen comics, particularly in their sound work; next to Laurel and Hardy and W.C. Fields, the Marx Brothers look like a band of delinquents hopped up on speed. With their feature-length pictures, it’s that everything else around L & H is enervated which detracts from the full appreciation of their genius.\n\nI’m not sure where the blame for this lies, although I strongly suspect it originates with their producer. Those of us who grew up watching the old Our Gang shorts (renamed “The Little Rascals” for television) recognize the long takes and reaction shots, the dead spaces that drag on unto infinity, or until the last moron in the house has gotten the joke, not to mention the stock LeRoy Shields and Marvin Hatley tunes playing endlessly and without the slightest recourse to syncopation with the action or dialogue. One can accept that this sort of filler was perhaps necessary (or deemed necessary, anyway) in the very early talkies, but by 1936 it reeked of laziness, and even incompetence. These seem to me the very hallmarks of the Hal Roach house-style, as is the repeated featuring of Roach’s biggest stars in numbingly outmoded 19th and very early 20th century operettas: The Rogue Song (1930; no complete prints of which exist), Fra Diavolo (1933), Babes in Toyland (1934) and this, the weakest of these titles still extant. It isn’t, this time out, merely the leaden pace that sinks the movie, or the terrible songs, but the constant tampering with the material and the death (a possible murder) during production of Thelma Todd, briefly seen lip-syncing to a typically maudlin ballad. Mae Busch is on hand, and that’s to the good, as is James Finlayson’s presence as an overzealous palace guard and charming little Darla Hood’s, then in her first year with “Our Gang,” as the landed child Busch kidnaps and leaves with Ollie, her cuckolded husband.\n\nVery little else works in The Bohemian Girl, and even Stan and Ollie’s routines fail to raise more than the occasional smile. (I laughed out loud exactly once, but the prospect of running the picture a second time, even in fast-forward, to see what elicited that response would tax a well man, and I’d been under the weather for a week.) Worse, the ending involves one of those grotesque sight-gags so beloved by Stan which would be horrible enough glimpsed quickly or obliquely but which is extended in case that prototypical moron I cited above didn’t catch the meaning at first glance. Laurel often had to be talked out of these things by others, and the frequent recurrence of cruelty toward these two characters in their pictures is baffling. It’s one thing when gruesome things happen to the Three Stooges; they’re live-action cartoon characters anyway, so the pain and discomfort (and even, at an extreme, the deaths) they experience don’t hurt. But didn’t Stan understand by 1936 that he and Ollie were, however silly their actions might be, real, and beloved? You don’t want to see the heads of gentle, cherished comedians mounted on a hunter’s wall just for the sake of a laugh. That’s a gag Laurel was dissuaded from including in one of the team’s two-reelers, but the one here is nearly as horrid.\n\nEarthquake (1974) Pauline Kael generously observed of this by-the-numbers ’70s disaster movie that it was “swill, but not cheap.” She was wrong. It’s both swill and cheap. Universal had watched while Irwin Allen raked in millions on The Poseidon Adventure (1972) and was determined to beat him at his own game. An increasingly ludicrous series of Airport sequels was in the works and this utter lox of a movie, calculated to rival Allen’s The Towering Inferno in the Christmas box-office sweepstakes, played very successfully on the national mood. Perhaps, had Mario Puzo been able to work longer on the screenplay he originated for it (he was contractually obligated to The Godfather Part II and had to leave the project before it was completed) Earthquake might have been less pointless and absurd, but I doubt it. (The other credited screenwriter, George Fox, was a magazine writer who had never written a play or movie.) I don’t know why Kael was so forgiving about them but what’s shocking to me, at a 50-year remove, is seeing now just how shoddy the special effects were. Aside from his usual painterly matte shots, Albert Whitlock’s “visual effects” could scarcely have passed muster on an ABC Movie of the Week of that era: Big obvious blocks of Styrofoam fall on screaming victims in the streets, the violent deaths of people in a high-rise elevator is represented by a sudden splash of animated blood across the field of vision and as the buildings burst open and fall apart you’re aware of precisely how calculated, and essentially phony, every move is along the way.\n\nEven the cast, compared to Poseidon and Inferno, feels second-rate, as if they’ve wandered in from the Universal TV movie they were shooting on an adjacent lot. Aside from Charlton Heston and Geneviève Bujold, who provide the only conviction the picture can work up as hapless lovers, Ava Gardner alternately rages and swoons as Heston’s appallingly needy, termagant wife; the one-time child evangelist Marjoe Gortner snarls at everyone as a ticking-bomb psycho who is either a) a closet-case, b) a mass-killer, c) a would-be heterosexual rapist, or all three at once; George Kennedy as an LAPD cop has either to rage at the human condition or perform acts of saintliness; Richard Roundtree and Gabriel Dell storm around in desperate search of characters to play; Victoria Principal is asked to thrust out her alleged 36-inch bust and pretend to be flattered as a bunch of men drool over her; Lloyd Nolan as a doctor corralled to aid the injured of downtown L.A. barks out orders and seems roughly as compassionate toward his charges as the Orkin man would be to a nest of cockroaches; while Lorne Greene and Barry Sullivan exude, respectively, kindness and concern as… no, it’s too boring even to tell you. One of the few “A”-list stars, Walter Matthau, has an entirely unfunny extended cameo as a bewildered bar drunk wearing what looks like one of Bella Abzug’s cast-off hats.\n\nJohn Williams, whose previous assignment was composing the superb score for The Towering Inferno, came to Earthquake utterly spent creatively: His music is so dispirited it depends on wholesale lifts from Inferno and contains nothing like that score’s breathtaking highs. The gifted Philip H. Lathrop could apparently do little for the look of the picture but its direction, by that hack Mark Robson, has even less flavor and flair than a typical episode of “Columbo.” Not that any of this mattered: Made on a budget of $6,675,125, the picture pulled in $167.4 million at the box-office, representing something like $154 million profit on the initial investment. Everyone must have been happy, except the stars, and the unfortunate ticket-buyers who sat through this abortion.*\n\nBlue Sky (1991/1994) Usually when a movie sits on the shelf as long as this one (four years) it’s either because it’s a mess, or the financing studio has no confidence in the picture and doesn’t know what to do with it, or even whether to bother releasing it at all, but although Blue Sky went unreleased due to the collapse of Orion, it’s also a mess. The original screenwriter, Rama Laurie Stagner, based the characters and situation on her family and the movie has the weirdly bifurcated feel of clear-eyed reminiscence grafted onto sheer wish-fulfillment. (The credited re-writers were Arlene Sarner and Jerry Leichtling.) Blue Sky works best when it concentrates on the marriage between Carly and Hank Marshall (Jessica Lange and Tommy Lee Jones), their relationships with their teenage daughters (Amy Locane and Anna Klemp) and the way Carly’s overpowering sexuality causes seemingly endless problems for the four. It is much less successful when it turns around and tries desperately to turn Carly into a heroine fearlessly taking on all comers in an effort to clear Hank’s name when he is unceremoniously dumped in a psych ward and kept insensible on forced psychotropic medication. A military scientist in the early 1960s whose field is monitoring radiation at nuclear testing ranges, Hank is outraged when a test is not called off despite a pair of civilians wandering into the field. His insubordination is the excuse for locking him up but what really rankles his married C.O. (Powers Booth) is his own abortive affair with Carly. The narrative’s mix of personal and political is not integrated — it’s schizophrenic, as if two different sorts of movies had been squeezed together so that the result is neither the fish of personalized drama nor the fowl of social activism. Additionally, and despite its often effective adult content, Blue Sky most resembles an idealization of a “good” parent (Hank) and the excoriation of a “bad” one (Carly). Worse, while the Marshalls, young and old, are depicted with precision, nearly everyone else comes off as a type, bloodless and not living so much as fulfilling basic dramatic requirements, the sort a first-time writer with an axe to grind is prone to. The schematism affects and detracts from everything, including the splendid performances by Lange and Jones, the good one by Locane and the direction by Tony Richardson, whose last picture this was. (He died, of, as they say, “AIDS-related complications,” in 1991, long before the movie was released.) Booth, like his character, is so unpleasant it’s nearly impossible to credit Carly’s attraction to him, and poor Carrie Snodgress, as his long-suffering wife, instead of a character is given attitudes to play, all of them eminently predictable. The icing on the cake is the typically awful score by Jack Nitzsche, complete with his usual hokey riffs on glass harmonica. Nitzsche, a fine arranger of other people’s music, was an object lesson in elevating to composter status someone whose bag of tricks was of extremely limited interest.\n\nOn a note of bizarre coincidence, Nitzsche once beat Snodgress with a handgun, threatening to kill her and, in quintessential Hollywood fashion that would never apply to you or me, got off with three years’ probation.\n\nLet’s Dance (1950) Topic for a master’s thesis in film history: “Why Betty Hutton?” Aside from Preston Sturges’ subversive comedy The Miracle of Morgan’s Creek (and she can be a trial there as well) I find that even minimal exposure to her extreme mugging and overblown vocalization causes the muscles in my jaw to tighten automatically… that is, when it doesn’t make my eyes glaze over entirely. Although she can be relatively inoffensive dramatically her basic persona, brash when not shrill, is repellant, like a distaff Jerry Lewis. My aversion to Hutton has kept me, despite my near-reverence for Fred Astaire, from seeing Let’s Dance but a new Blu-ray edition from Kino Lorber effectively cancelled my long-standing eschewal. Having finally seen it I dislike Betty Hutton as much as I ever have, but I found Let’s Dance itself surprisingly painless, if entirely inconsequential and, two good routines by him notwithstanding, a title that in no way burnishes Astaire’s filmography. He made worse musicals before this one — You’ll Never Get Rich, Blue Skies and Second Chorus are genuinely bad and only one of them has an Astaire dance worthy of his time and ingenuity — but never, I don’t think, was he paired with a female co-star with whom he had less sympathy. Although he spoke highly of Hutton (amazingly, to me, he was much more discomfited by Kay Thompson, with whom he had one of his best duets, in Funny Face) and her adeptness as a dancer is comparable to that of Judy Garland, there is not a trace of chemistry between the pair and in only one number (the comic “Oh, Them Dudes,” which she plays in cowboy drag) do they express, briefly and joyously, a sense of teamwork or real pleasure in each other’s company.\n\nThe plot, which seems rather obviously inspired by the 1930s custody battle between her mother and aunt over the child Gloria Vanderbilt, is complicated for a screen musical, and turns on a dime at the end when the condescending aunt by marriage suddenly and inexplicably relents. (That the old Boston dragon is played by the likeable Lucile Watson at least mitigates some of her character’s appalling snobbery, and she gets a brief, charming waltz with Astaire to an old-fashioned tune.) For a picture called Let’s Dance, there is very little dancing, and Fred’s best number is the “Piano Dance,” with lively music by Tommy Chambers, Van Cleave and Astaire himself, during which he performs over, under and all around an upright and a baby grand, the latter of which, when the music segues to “Hold That Tiger,” explodes with cats.\n\nAllan Scott, Astaire’s frequent RKO scenarist, wrote the often witty screenplay, with, as they used to say, additional dialogue by Dane Lussier and the pleasing songs are by Frank Loesser, fresh off the shockingly successful Guys and Dolls on Broadway. The period Technicolor is rather more subdued than usual, although Let’s Dance indulges in the hoariest of movie-musical clichés: The theatre (or in this case, nightclub) with the impossibly large performing space on which unfold activities never seen this side of a Hollywood soundstage. Norman Z. McLeod, who in palmier days directed the peerless It’s a Gift for W.C. Fields and for the Marx Brothers, Monkey Business and what I consider the team’s funniest picture, Horsefeathers, keeps the nonsense moving at a crisp pace and the good supporting cast includes Roland Young and Melville Cooper as Watson’s attorneys, Ruth Warrick as her sympathetic daughter, George Zucco as a judge and little Gregory Moffett as the widowed Hutton’s little boy, around whom the legal machinations whirl. Moffett gives a lovely performance, entirely free of guile, at least until the final moments when he’s made to look silly.\n\nThe Unsinkable Molly Brown (1964) If you accept that it bears, aside from her experience as a survivor of the Titanic and the fact she was married to the wealthy miner J.J. “Johnny” Brown, virtually no relation to the facts of Margaret Tobin Brown’s biography, the picture represents one of the few 1960s Hollywood musicals that is engaging and not just big. Tammy Grimes, who originated the role on Broadway — and was, absurdly, given a Tony as Featured Actress for her starring performance† — had no chance of reprising her role on film, and Molly Brown was planned for Shirley MacLaine, until Hal Wallis put the kibosh on that by claiming she was still under contract to him. The director, Charles Walters, didn’t want her but Debbie Reynolds got the role, for which she had campaigned strenuously, and was subsequently nominated for an Academy Award. (She lost, to Julie Andrews, for what Reynold’s daughter Carrie Fisher wittily called Andrews’ “stunning, multi-layered and moving portrayal of Mary Poppins. Ibsen’s Mary Poppins.”) MacLaine would almost certainly have given a better dramatic (and dancing) performance but her singing voice, good in its way if belty, lacked the warmth, variety and emotional vulnerability of Reynolds’. In any case, the star is well-matched by Harve Presnell’s likeable performance (and his classical baritone) as Johnny and the Meredith Willson score, although its songstack was eviscerated in the transfer from the stage is, even in abbreviated form, beautifully conceived and idiosyncratically realized, the way his The Music Man was. (He composed Johnny Brown’s arias with Presnell’s voice in mind, and it shows.) Only five of the Broadway songs made it to the movie, with an additional three (“Beautiful People of Denver,” “Dolce Far Niente” and “Up Where the People Are”) heard as underscore and a sixth vocal number (“He’s My Friend”) added by Willson to the soundtrack.\n\nHelen Deutsch’s screenplay, based on the Broadway book by Richard Morris, occasionally indulges in bathos, and a little inconsistency, as when Molly encounters her Denver, Colorado nemesis Mrs. McGraw (Audrey Christie) in Europe just before securing a berth on the Titanic, yet McGraw is somehow in Denver to greet her at the finale, or when Johnny is introduced with the exuberant “Colorado, My Home” before we have any idea who he is. Interestingly, the number that provides the greatest audience pleasure, as the kind of elaborate song-and-dance set-piece that can work so well on stage but which seldom replicates that performance excitement on the screen, is the one Willson wrote for the movie. MGM, however, was siphoning so much money to Doctor Zhivago that “He’s My Friend” nearly went un-filmed until the cast agreed to shoot it in a single day, with three cameras. When it’s not being limited by matte shots and indifferent rear-projection (and, during the sinking of the Titanic, black-and-white clips from two pervious movies) Daniel L. Fapp’s cinematography is frequently luscious, Peter Gennaro’s choreography is lively and inventive and Morton Haack’s fulsome costumes include a rich, red ballgown for Reynolds that nearly rivals the one Walter Plunkett designed for Vivien Leigh in Gone with the Wind. The unusually fulsome supporting cast includes Ed Begley as Molly’s adoptive father, Hermione Baddeley as his inamorata with the wonderful name Buttercup Grogan, Hayden Rorke as a prissy society columnist, and George Mitchell in a pleasant performance as a monsignor. Grover Dale and Gus Trikonis as Molly’s old friends dance energetically, and the wonderful Martita Hunt provides one of her beguiling extended cameos as a grand duchess who befriends the Browns. As a bittersweet reminder of what befalls yesterday’s darlings, the gifted silent comedienne Minta Durfee appears briefly in a party scene.\n\nLook, by the way, for a photo of the real Molly Brown and you’ll realize instantly just how apt the casting of Kathy Bates was in Titanic.\n\nThe Incredible Journey (1963) Sheila Burnford’s 1961 novel about three pets making an impossible homeward trek across the Canadian wilderness is one of the loveliest of all fictions about animals, and while the Walt Disney adaptation loses a great deal of what makes it special, its essentials remain. James Algar’s screenplay attempts to compensate for the elimination of authorial voice with narration spoken by Rex Allen and while it is only partly successful, Burnford’s empathetic prose, her keen appreciation of the human/animal bond, and of the ways of cats and dogs, remains, in posse if not in esse; the entire project is lit with the special grace that attends movies made with loving kindness, particularly movies about animals. The trio at the center of the story (the young golden retriever Luath, the Siamese cat Tao and the elderly English pit bull terrier Bodger) are devoted to each other, especially Tao and Bodger, and that unusual affection suffuses the movie and gives it its unemphatic emotional power. Humans make their requisite appearances throughout the story, but they do so unobtrusively for the most part, at least until the satisfying finale, where the love of a boy for his lifelong pet gives the conclusion a depth of feeling that has exactly the right resonance.\n\nBanjo the Woodpile Cat (1979) This animated short (27 minutes) directed by Don Bluth and executed by his fellow Disney animators Gary Goldman and John Pomeroy as a personal protest against recent trends at the studio is, like most of Bluth’s later pictures, attractive to the eye, annoying to the ear and insulting to the brain. (Of those I’ve seen, only his feature debut, the vivid Robert C. O’Brien adaptation The Secret of NIMH, was wholly satisfying, perhaps because unlike Bluth’s many originals, it was based on a solid, well-plotted literary source.) The story is by Bluth and his gifted brother Toby, and to a weird degree reflects their Mormon background: Early on a nasty old feedtruck driver headed for the Big Town cackles to an equally unsavory friend about the “good times” he’s going to have in… Salt Lake City, that well-known Utahan hell of fleshpots and loose women. Bluth also wrote the numbingly bad title song, which he pushes relentlessly throughout the action, and the designs of his cat characters voiced by the black actors Scatman Crothers and Beau Richards have, in contrast to all the other felines in the picture, fat, underslung lower lips. And they call Dumbo racist!\n\n13 Washington Square (1928) Hitherto unknown to me, this comic thriller from the year that saw the end of silent pictures has been beautifully restored by Kino Lorber in gorgeous sepia tone and proves, if nothing else, that ZaSu Pitts was as funny a silent comedian as she was a sound comic. The story, adapted by Harry O. Hoyt and Walter Anthony from a novel and play by Leroy Scott, is purest late-Victorian gossamer: A wealthy widow (Alice Joyce) desperate to stop her young son (George J. Lewis) from marrying the daughter of a >>gasp!<< shopkeeper(!) becomes, inadvertently, involved with a thief (Jean Hersholt) posing as a Deacon who, unknown to her and her dizzy maid (Pitts) has plans to steal her art masterworks. (Got it?) Meanwhile… but you’re way ahead of me, or should be. 13 Washington Square is unusually complicated for a silent comedy, and more dependent on intertitles than any silent picture I can recall, suggesting that it probably should have been a talkie. Yet that would have robbed it of the pictorial beauty of John Stumar’s cinematography, half the reason for watching it. The other half is Pitts’ hilarious performance as the wide-eyed, malaprop-prone housemaid, whose solecisms would have made Archie Bunker proud… although a reliance on word-play in a silent movie says something about the material.\n\nAlice Joyce may remind you, as she did me, of a shorter-haired Gillian Anderson, whom she strongly resembles, particularly in three-quarter profile.\n\nThe Greatest Show on Earth (1952) A typically overblown, fatuous and hilariously melodramatic piece of self-regard by Cecil B. DeMille that, as usual with that shameless purveyor of spectacle, also provides a hefty dose of genuine excitement. This is mainly confined to the aerial sequences with Cornel Wilde and Betty Hutton perpetually attempting to outdo each other on trapeze and high-wire and which are so successful they ultimately gave this acrophobe a tension headache. I mean that as a compliment. The picture is, essentially, a two-and-a-half hour, intermissionless advertisement for the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, with a glowering Charlton Heston as the general manager trying to keep the show rolling amid professional rivalries, competing libidos and perennially simmering catfights. This is not to mention the presence in the center ring of a fugitive mercy-killer (James Stewart) disguised as a clown, a psychopathic elephant trainer (is there any other kind?), a thief in the employ of a big-time gangster and, for extra thrills, a climactic train-wreck that permits Hutton to prove her love to Heston. All popular movies are of course products of their time, and The Greatest Show on Earth depicts the 20th century love for trained-animal acts whose gradual phasing out has seemed to me for once a wholly admirable outcome of social agitation. Even as a child taken to his first and only circus I was uneasy about elephants, those most community-minded and sensitive of large land mammals, being made to dance around the ring, balance on balls and form pyramids for my entertainment; had I known with what sadistic cruelty these animals were trained, I suspect I would have been inclined to set a match to the sawdust. (I used secretly to wish the lions and tigers would gang up on and eviscerate their whip-wielding trainers, which I suppose tells you more about the limits of my personal benignity than I meant to.)\n\nThe movie periodically dwells, with dismaying Technicolor rapture, on crowds of all ages in the stands stuffing their faces with every imaginable comestible, from peanuts, popcorn and ice-cream cones to hot dogs, candy bars and cotton candy; it’s almost a pocket depiction of the expanding American waistline. Then there are the musical numbers, warbled either by Hutton or Dorothy Lamour, performed without amplification under enormous circus tents with brass bands blazing away and which in defiance of all the principles of sound reproduction we are expected to believe are perfectly audible to everyone in the crowd. And when the action flags, as it frequently does, we are treated to fleeting pipsqueak cameos by the likes of Arthur Q. Bryan‡, Bob Hope, Bing Crosby and even Bob Crosby in the audience, and all-too-brief three-ring bits by circus eminences such as Emmett Kelly as Weary Willie and Lou Jacobs, complete with tiny clown car; at least the young midget acrobat Cucciola gets a specialty number, although why he performs much of it in drag I leave to the psychologists in the audience. Somewhat astoundingly, it took four credited writers to concoct this sawdust mulligatawny, and I suspect there were also legions of uncredited scribes adding reams of DeMille-approved hokum. There are moments of amateurishness that defy credulity, as when DeMille cuts from two actors in front of a bad back-projection of monkeys clambering over an enclosure to the same pair closer to the camera while the rear-screen image exactly remains the same size. Still, it must be said that when one of the show’s principals falls from a great height, the action is achieved with shocking realism, and without a cut. DeMille himself narrates, with that patented sanctimonious/stentorian gasbaggery of his, made even more insufferable by the lines he speaks, which seem to imply that the Ringlings are closer to God than you or me and a lack of enthusiasm for their circus just might be subversive.\n\nBilly Wilder got off one of the great back-handed compliments in movie history when after seeing the picture at the premiere he bowed to DeMille and proclaimed, “Mr. DeMille, you have made The Greatest Show on Earth.” Such are the ways of Hollywood, however, that, in the year of The Quiet Man, The Member of the Wedding, The Bad and the Beautiful, Come Back Little Sheba and Singin’ in the Rain, this was the Motion Picture Academy’s choice for “Best Picture.”\n\nCabin in the Sky (1943) Speaking of products of another time, this exceptionally tuneful musical fantasy preserves the work of a cast of black performers at the peak of their energy and ingenuity.\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark (1981) Forty-three years have not withered, nor repeated custom entirely staled, the finite variety inherent in this highly enjoyable collaboration between George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Lawrence Kasdan. Watching it again in the 4K UHD edition over the Memorial Day weekend I was struck by two things: That the first quarter of the picture is, as is so often the case with 4K transfers, entirely too dark, and that Karen Allen was and remains the most delightful heroine of a popular action picture in the past five decades. No one since has matched her combination of freckled beauty, spunky independence and amiable combativeness and I cannot imagine anyone, aside perhaps from the young Shirley MacLaine, negotiating the line between passionate determination and riant silliness as Allen does. That she did not become, after Raiders, one of the more important American actresses is one of those eternal mysteries, such as why Tom Cruise is still in any way relevant to life on the planet.\n\nAirport (1970) When it comes to certain things in life, initial impressions made at an early age can, however undiscriminating they may seem to you later, carry through succeeding decades with very little change. This movie, first encountered on commercial television when I was 12, is one of those things.\n\n*Actually, to generate those sorts of profits, even world-wide, I presume that Earthquake had many return customers. But what sort of person would want to see a thing like like twice? Even at age 13 I instinctively avoided seeing it once.\n\n†A few other howlers in the long Tony Award history of nominating leading players in musicals as featured or supporting actor/actress, presumably based on billing: Isabel Bigley as Sarah Brown in Guys and Dolls; Yul Brynner in The King and I; Cyril Ritchard as Captain Hook and Mr. Darling in Peter Pan; Carol Lawrence as Maria in West Side Story (ditto Josie de Guzman in the 1980 edition); Sandra Church as Gypsy Rose Lee in Gypsy (the same thing happened to Zan Charisse and Christa Moore, respectively, in the 1975 and 1990 revivals); Theodor Bikel as Captain Von Trapp in The Sound of Music; Jerry Orbach as Sky Masterson in Guys & Dolls; Maureen Brennan as Cunegonde and Mark Baker (as Candide!) in the 1974 Candide; Patti LuPone in The Robber Bridegroom; David Kernan, Millicent Martin and Julia McKenzie, the entire singing cast of Side by Side by Sondheim; Lenny Baker, one of only four cast members in I Love My Wife; Alyson Reed as Sally Bowles(!) in the 1988 Cabaret; and, with Grimes as Molly Brown, the all-time jaw-droppers, Barbara Cook as Marian the librarian in The Music Man, Dick Van Dyke and Chita Rivera, the stars of the show, in Bye, Bye, Birdie and William Daniels in 1776. Daniels, quite rightly, refused the nomination.\n\n‡The voice, if not the mind or spirit, of Elmer Fudd.\n\nText copyright 2024 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nThere is a belief, now tiresomely accepted as fact even by people who should know better, that an enjoyment of musicals, either theatrical or on film, is somehow an especial provenance (if not a genetic imprimatur) of gay men. That there was once a time when musicals were part of the broader popular culture, consumed and enjoyed by millions, is never considered. I’ll get to my thoughts on that in a moment, but I am reminded by the current artificial divide of something Alan Jay Lerner observed in his “Lyrics and Lyricists” evening at the 92nd Street YMHA anent a similar late 1960s/early 1970s shibboleth suggesting that the young did not attend live theatrical productions and that the old were subsidizing them: “Theatre isn’t for the young. It isn’t for the old. It’s for people who like the theatre.” Musicals aren’t for any particular segment of the population; they’re only “for” people who like musicals. And while that includes many (but by no means all) gay men this, as with any demographic, is not monolithic. Some gay men like theatre, and hate musicals. Some hate theatre but like movie musicals. Some love both musicals and theatre generally, and some have no use for either.\n\nThat, beginning in the ‘70s, the larger American culture had turned its back on musicals as a form of entertainment which had once been ubiquitous in American life, and the font for much of popular music, is attributable to a number of things: The rise of rock and the concurrent decline of Broadway and Hollywood as a source of pop hits, the much- (if not over-) commented upon gap between generations and the concomitant over-extension (and overselling) of budget-busting movie musicals. Rather than legitimizing the spurious “Gay = Musical Aficionado” equation, let’s first acknowledge the obvious fact that many gay men are drawn to the performing arts, largely I would say due to a heightened sense of appreciation for the qualities traditionally associated with them. This was especially true in more socially repressive times than ours, when a desire to perform on stage may have been related to a need to break out of constrictive social or familial norms, or to a yearning by homosexual adolescents to act out freer scenarios than those they were forced to accept as their own. And although I don’t think this is especially true of young gay men in the 21st century — you’ve only to look at the garbage so many of them embrace to know that they are not arbiters of higher culture for anyone any longer — gay men were and are often taken with physical beauty and grace (dance generally and ballet specifically), color and form (set and costume design and photography), the creation of narrative alternatives (writing and direction), harmonic craft and expression (music and songs) and, of course, imaginative fantasy and interpretation (acting and singing). And when those avenues of creativity became less central to the culture young gay men, no strangers in the past to marginalization, may have been drawn even more fiercely to them, as practitioners and as curators.\n\nI bring this up because I’ve never known what makes me partial to musicals any more than I know what draws me to physical comedy, or fully hand-drawn animation, or ’30s comedies, or newspaper movies, nor do I care. I suspect my appetite for screen musicals is related to my early exposure to them (my initial movie memories involve seeing, first Mary Poppins and later The Sound of Music, and one of the most influential movies I saw in early adolescence was the film of 1776) but I do know what drew me to stage musicals: Appearing in one. Playing Linus in a youth theatre production of Clark Gesner’s You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown at 12 made me seek out original cast recordings of other shows at the public library. I watched a number of adaptations of stage musicals on television in those years (The Music Man, Oklahoma!, South Pacific, Sweet Charity, My Fair Lady, Hello Dolly!, Oliver!, Funny Girl, How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, West Side Story, Fiddler on the Roof), a few screen originals (White Christmas, An American in Paris) and, on an especially memorable birthday weekend, the musical play Cabaret and, the next day, a theatrical reissue of the movie. But I also saw dozens of other types of movies then, and there is no pattern I can discern in my TV viewing or moviegoing of the time. I saw what appealed to me, and it didn’t really matter what the genre was; I certainly don’t see how my nascent or emergent sexuality had a thing to do with my early love for Irma La Douce, The Great Race, Pinocchio, What’s Up Doc?, Dumbo, The Gold Rush, Lady and the Tramp, The Glass Bottom Boat, Gone with the Wind, Around the World in 80 Days, Planet of the Apes, Goldfinger or The Man with the Golden Gun.\n\nIf there is a seminal event during that time that whetted my appetite for movie musicals, I suppose it must be our mother taking my sister and me to see the celebration of MGM musicals That’s Entertainment! during its original release in the summer of 1974. I was a bit surprised, seeing it again recently on Blu-ray, how vividly I recalled many of the excerpts — and how equally vividly I now recall how it felt seeing them then: How derisively amused I was by Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald bellowing the “Indian Love Call” at each other (those absurd, repeated “oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo”s) in the Rose Marie clip, by Eleanor Powell spinning and twirling her way through the outrageously over-populated title number from Rosalie (not to mention all that cellophane), and by the determinedly opulent (and seemingly endless) “A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody” from The Great Ziegfeld, which made me leery of Irving Berlin for years afterward. I also remembered the anonymous moviegoer down front who applauded at the end of every single clip throughout the two-hour-and-fourteen-minute running time and how my heart sank as I realized that she (I strongly suspected it was a she, and someone’s grandmother) was not going to recognize her social faux pas, or be corrected by her companions, and was going to annoy us without surcease. (She did.)\n\nOn balance, though, there was much more to love in That’s Entertainment! than there was to deride, and that’s still the case. Indeed, I think some of the clunkier early talkie bits are more enjoyable now than they were 48 years ago when they were greeted largely as bits of unintentional camp and now seem more like amusing artifacts rescued from the cultural dustbin. I knew Fred Astaire at that time almost solely from talk-show appearances, or as the stop-motion narrator of the Rankin-Bass “Santa Claus is Coming to Town,” and seeing him in his natural métier, on a big screen, was as revelatory as the bliss with which we regarded Gene Kelly singin’ in the rain and dancing with Jerry Mouse, Donald O’Connor making ‘em laugh,* Frank Sinatra looking young and beautiful (I’d only ever encountered him before on contemporary television, where he was older and considerably more well-padded), William Warfield’s thrilling bass-baritone rendition of “Ol’ Man River” and Judy Garland, whom I had seen only as Dorothy Gale every spring on TV, getting happy with Harold Arlen’s music in that marvelous fedora and upper half of a tux. There did indeed seem to be, as Howard Dietz’s lyric had it, a world of entertainment and I wondered if, or how, I could ever catch up to it.†\n\nSome of the editorial decisions made by Jack Haley Jr., who wrote, produced and directed That’s Entertainment!, are baffling. The extended tribute to Ester Williams’… what shall we call it? narcissistic athleticism?… makes my eyes glaze over, and I would be equally happy without all that footage of Eleanor Powell, whose popularity and reputation utterly stymie me. As much as her love of masculine attire annoys me, in a dress (as in her challenge dance with Astaire to “Begin the Beguine”) she somehow seems like an imposter. Whenever I see her, grinning at the audience and stamping away I am reminded of Roy Scheider in All That Jazz admonishing Deborah Geffner that she’s not dancing in the high school play. I know a lot of people love Powell’s dancing, including other dancers, but I can’t fathom why they do; you can’t fault her technically, but she’s as impersonal as a dancing automaton. With a little less of Powell and Williams (and the young Judy Garland singing that cloying “Dear Mr. Gable” number, which Gable also hated) Haley might have made room in his movie for more than six minutes of the 17-minute American in Paris ballet.\n\nJust as the tottering edifices of MGM, already sold to developers before the movie opened, carried the nostalgia of decay in 1974, it’s moving now to see the movie’s rotating gallery of hosts since, with the exception of Liza Minnelli (who was then many decades their junior), all of them are dead now: Sinatra, Kelly, Astaire, Peter Lawford, Debbie Reynolds, Bing Crosby, James Stewart, Elizabeth Taylor, Mickey Rooney and Donald O’Connor. The narrative segments were variable, and occasionally embarrassing, even then, and those that were embarrassing are still embarrassing, especially Taylor trying to look demure and humble and Reynolds twittering away with her particular patented air of wholesome chirping phoniness. What’s moving is not the ageing flesh of movie idols whose youth and pulchritude were fixed in the amber of film but the fact that we can no longer see Sinatra and Astaire and James Stewart at all except in their old movies. In 1974 they were, even if not working much (Sinatra always excepted) still around, and familiar.\n\nSinatra comes off extremely well in his clips, where he shows off his remarkable skills as a show business adept. Like Judy Garland, who was said to have needed to be shown a step, or a dance, only once before she got it, he is exceptionally game — relaxed and accomplished, even when dancing with a trained hoofer like Gene Kelly. He has a charming duet with Jimmy Durante in which he sings his lines in imitation of his co-star, a spirited tap dance with Kelly to “Take Me Out to the Ball Game” and, best of all, trades musical quips with Bing Crosby in the deliciously arch Cole Porter number “Well, Did You Evah.” Ever since my mother passed along her 45, 78 and EP collection to me when I was eight and I began to listen to him I’d been a fan of Sinatra’s voice. Seeing at 13 what a splendid all-around entertainer he had once been made me that much fonder of him.\n\nNearly 49 years after seeing That’s Entertainment! I’m struck both by what I underrated then and what bugs me now. In the former category: June Allyson, Jane Powell, Kathryn Grayson, and James Stewart singing Porter’s “Easy to Love” in a slightly tremulous but curiously endearing high tenor. In the latter (and aside from Eleanor Powell and Esther Williams) Ann Miller, especially in the gruesomely conceived Busby Berkeley number “I Gotta Hear That Beat” with its disembodied limbs sprouting from the floor and “playing” a variety of musical instruments while she grins like a moron and taps her little heart out around them. (The chiefest condescending laugh of 1974 is still the movie’s best bit of unintentional hilarity: Joan Crawford clodhopping her way through “Got a Feelin’ for You” in 1929. I’m amazed she had a career at all after that.) As I indicated above, the worst decision made by Haley was to pare the exhilarating American in Paris ballet down to a third of its original length. If you’re going to disembowel a classic production number like that, why include it at all, let alone as your grand finale?\n\nI missed That’s Entertainment, Part 2 (1976) when it opened largely because, unlike That’s Entertainment! it was a flop at the box-office (it made a sixth of what its predecessor raked in) and played a single week in a single theater in Raleigh, NC, to which our bedroom-community town was adjacent. The people behind this aesthetic mess (Saul Chaplin and Daniel Melnick were the producers) made two major mistakes that sunk it. The first was trying to include too much, and too many mediocre second-and-third tier musical numbers. The second was hiring Gene Kelly to co-star in and direct it.\n\nHaving the movie narrated by only two hosts this time could be considered a come-down from the starry aggregation of the first picture but the fact that these hosts are Kelly and Fred Astaire mitigates the loss. (It was allegedly Astaire’s idea that the two dance together in it, for the first time since their “Babbitt and the Bromide” number 30 years earlier in Ziegfeld Follies.) Or it might have, if Leonard Gershe’s wan screenplay didn’t constantly make the pair alternatively sarcastic, gushing or fake-humble. You could always tell when Astaire was embarrassed; his voice took on a chuckling, aw-shucks quality completely at odds with his usual demonstrative mien. Gershe also misidentifies the dance to Kiss Me, Kate‘s “From This Moment On” as being choreographed by Hermes Pan when Bob Fosse not only appears in it (along with Tommy Rall, Ann Miller, Bobby Van, Carol Haney and Jeanne Coyne) but famously staged his and Haney’s portion of the number. You’ve only to watch what he and Haney do for a few seconds to recognize the moves as quintessential Fosse. Sadly, Howard Dietz’s new variations on his original “That’s Entertainment” lyrics, while occasionally clever, are more often TV-special obvious and irritating — a thing no one ever had cause to say about Dietz’s best work.\n\nWorse, having celebrated MGM musicals in the first movie, the producers of this one celebrate MGM itself, expanding the picture’s running time by cramming in comic and dramatic sequences from 20 years of the studio’s product. And while it’s always a pleasure to see Laurel and Hardy and the Marx Brothers, or Marie Dressler doing a double-take, what their clips are doing in a compilation of musical numbers is anyone’s guess, as is the sheer clunkiness of John De Cuir’s modular production design. All I could think of while gazing at those lousy sets as Kelly and Astaire cavorted over them was the Julie Andrews “Polly Wolly Doodle” number at the beginning of Blake Edwards’ 1981 Hollywood satire S.O.B., deliberately ugly and simultaneously both spare and overproduced.\n\nA perfect example of the ennui that sets in early with this largely unnecessary compilation is the extended clip of Kelly’s “Sinbad the Sailor” sequence from his ill-advised 1956 fiasco Invitation to the Dance, with sub-par Hanna-Barbera-animated Arabian guards and which goes on, each dismally unfunny sight gag leading to another, for what feels like an hour. Both Kelly and Hanna-Barbera did finer work a dozen years earlier when Gene danced with Jerry Mouse in Anchors Aweigh; “Sinbad” is a giant leap backwards, in CinemaScope. The brightest element of That’s Entertainment, Part 2 is Saul Bass’ main title sequence, in which the names of dozens of stars are yoked together, wittily; the note in a bottle on the beach, for example, announces Esther Williams, Johnny Weissmuller, Ethel Waters and W.C. Fields.\n\nAs with That’s Entertainment!, too many numbers are butchered unnecessarily. Even Kelly’s “I Got Rhythm,” charmingly performed with a gaggle of delighted French children, is cut by half, as are his trio with O’Connor and Reynolds to “Good Morning,” Bing Crosby’s “Now You Has Jazz” number with Louis Armstrong and His All-Stars, the “Triplets” trio from The Band Wagon, Astaire’s “I Wanna Be a Dancin’ Man” and Waters’ exuberant “Taking a Chance on Love.” Yet we do get the full versions of the idiotic “Tales from the Vienna Woods” sequence from The Great Waltz, the gimmicky Astaire “Steppin’ Out with My Baby,” the ludicrous Bobby Van hopping number “Take Me to Broadway” (one of those overdone specialties that illustrate just how limited a “choreographer” Busby Berkeley really was) and the equally mind-numbing Esther Williams specialty “Cypress Gardens Water Spectacular.”\n\nThere are some nice compensations, however, not the least is watching the 76-year old Astaire doing his last bits of screen dancing; Robert Taylor, of all people, performing a more than creditable version of “I’ve Got a Feelin’ You’re Foolin'” with June Knight in Broadway Melody of 1936; Crosby’s searing rendition of “Temptation,” which reminds those who may have known him only as a relaxed, pipe-smoking middle-aged crooner that he was the first popular American male singer in the 1930s to exude sex; Doris Day’s impassioned “Ten Cents a Dance” is fascinating if only to hear the Production Code being flouted — she has to substitute “dandies” for “pansies,” but somehow they let her get away with “Sometimes I think/I’ve found my hero/But it’s a queer romance…”; Georges Guétary’s exhilarating “I’ll Build a Stairway to Paradise” with its imaginative Vincente Minnelli-inspired design is presented in full; there are two clips from the 1934 Ernest Lubitsch-directed The Merry Window that whet one’s desire to see the full movie; and we get a nice long look at Gwen Verdon doing the can-can in the 1952 remake.\n\nAlthough Kelly introduces the sequel’s Astaire clips while Astaire returns the favor for Kelly, it was probably not a wise idea, for appearances’ sake, to have either of them also direct the picture. Whether it was merely a matter of perception or one of inside intelligence, Kelly was seen as a narcissist by the movie’s critics: One contemporary magazine review, I remember, called the inclusion of a Kelly roller-skating number from It’s Always Fair Weather called “I Like Myself” too true to be good, and Pauline Kael got off one of her best contemporary lines when she referred to That’s Entertainment, Part 2 as “The Gene Kelly Memorial Service, conducted by Gene Kelly.”\n\nAfter the debacle of Part 2, we felt reasonably certain the series was over — that is, if we thought about it all. But a funny thing happened on the way to Time-Warner gobbling up everything in its path: A narcissist billionaire named Ted Turner purchased the MGM, RKO and pre-1948 Warner Bros. libraries and began to exploit them, first on his Atlanta cable channel TBS (and on his subsequent movie station TNT), then on video cassette and finally as part of a premium service he called (with characteristic modesty) Turner Classic Movies. Much as I loathe having to credit that creepy eugenicist with anything, Turner, once mad for the barbarity of “colorizing” classic black-and-white titles, somehow became a film preservationist. Granted the films in question belonged to him, but aside from showcasing them on TCM his company worked to salvage many (the necessarily incomplete restoration of Greed was a Turner project… one Time-Warner has never deigned to release on DVD or Blu-Ray). He also produced, through his Rhino/Turner Classic Movies Music record label, a series of marvelous compact disc releases, the soundtrack albums those of us who had long been frustrated by the truncated old MGM records had long been waiting for, and had begun to despair of ever hearing.‡ (Singin’ in the Rain and North by Northwest by themselves would have justified the label’s existence.) As Turner branched out into the occasional theatrical release (Gettysburg and Gods and Generals) his people revisited That’s Entertainment! as well. In doing so the producers of the third installment in the series nearly obliterated the bad taste left by the second and, in emphasizing outtakes and returning to the multiple host format of the initial movie, gave themselves reasons for people to watch their movie.\n\nPut together by the directors Bud Friedgen and Michael J. Sheridan and intelligently written by them, That’s Entertainment! III includes as co-hosts Kelly, June Allyson, Cyd Charisse, Lena Horne, Howard Keel, Ann Miller, Reynolds, Rooney and (alas) Esther Williams, insuring yet another brace of her (to quote Fanny Brice) “wet she’s a star, dry she ain’t” movie clips… but not, almost shockingly, the best song she ever got; Frank Loesser’s beguiling “Baby, It’s Cold Outside” — now stupidly deemed “rapey” by the easily offended among the younger generations. There is also (again, alas) more Eleanor Powell here than can be reasonably well digested, at least by me, and one Ann Miller routine (“Shakin’ the Blues Away”) is one too many. The only thing more disturbing than the young Ann Miller is seeing the old Ann Miller with her jet-black dye-job seemingly plastered to that big head of hers. Fortunately, her memory is obliterated later in the movie by Doris Day’s rendition of the same song, from Love Me or Leave Me. The same cannot be said for Betty Hutton’s caterwauling her part of the “Anything You Can Do” duet with Howard Keel from Annie Get Your Gun, and the inclusion, even truncated, of Debbie Reynolds’ version of “You Are My Lucky Star,” sung to Gene Kelly’s image, gives a good indication why it was cut from Singin’ in the Rain. It’s not a comment on her rendition to imagine that, left in, the number would have stopped the movie cold, although seeing it does explain both why Kelly sings it to her at the end of the movie and why that picture ends with the two of them in front of a billboard. A contortionist routine performed by a group called the Ross Sisters (no relation!) is the most gruesome display since Harriet Hoctor’s ballet to “They Can’t Take That Away From Me” in the Astaire/Rogers Shall We Dance. And if the producers had to include something from the incredibly overrated movie of On the Town, did it have to be that rotten title song by Comden and Green and Roger Edens? This brash, strutting number, shot on MGM’s patently phony city street sets, exemplifies everything I hate about the cheerful artificiality of 1940s movie musicals and the cavalier manner with which the studios so often threw out the scores of the Broadway shows they were allegedly honoring and replaced them with pap. (That Comden and Green were the original lyricists for On the Town just makes the terrible songs they wrote with Edens for the movie more dispiriting.)\n\nMost of That’s Entertainment! III, however, is joyous. We not only get June Allyson’s “Cleopatterer” from ‘Till the Clouds Roll By but Allyson, Gloria De Haven and the young Nancy Walker’s hard-charging “The Three B’s,”§ Joan McCracken doing “Pass That Peace Pipe” with Ray MacDonald, Dolores Gray’s “Thanks a Lot But No Thanks” and even Elvis Presley’s “Jailhouse Rock,” one of the most weirdly if inadvertently homoerotic songs of the early rock ‘n’ roll era. (What — you expected they had co-ed prisons in those days?) Among the previously uncollected gems are batches of numbers by Kelly (“Slaughter on Tenth Avenue” with Vera-Ellen and the delightful “Newspaper Dance” from Summer Stock), Astaire (“Stereophonic Sound” with Janis Paige, Easter Parade‘s “Drum Crazy” and the famous, hot pas de deux with Cyd Charisse from The Band Wagon, although the last is too brief and “Drum Crazy” stupidly edited), Lena Horne (a lovely “Where or When” and a sexy, soignée “Just One of Those Things”) and a veritable clutch of Judy Garland.¶ Her duet with Mickey Rooney on “How About You?” is splendid but “I Wish I Were in Love Again” from the specious Rodgers and Hart “biopic” Words and Music, with the exuberantly heterosexual Rooney an absurd choice for the dour homosexual Hart, is execrable; the idea that Lorenz Hart would perform his own songs in a manic fashion is absurd, and insulting enough to the poor man’s memory. But that Hart could, in the 1920s, sing a duet with “guest star” Judy Garland, as herself, is utterly risible. Also on the debit side is the weird “Minnie from Trinidad” number from Ziegfeld Girl in which Garland wears Light Egyptian and is lifted by what looks like the proverbial 10-foot poles, and the lachrymose, self-pitying “In Between” from Love Finds Andy Hardy. Much better is “Swing Mr Mendelssohn” and a lovely rendition of the Jerome Kern-Oscar Hammerstein ”Who?”\n\nGarland comes in as well for the lion’s (Leo the Lion’s?) share of the outtake material that chiefly differentiates That’s Entertainment! III from its predecessors. Harry Warren and Johnny Mercer’s “March of the Doagies,” filmed for The Harvey Girls but cut from the release print, is lively and rather beautifully filmed, and there’s an interesting juxtaposition of her later “Get Happy” with the previously unseen “Mr. Monotony,” both with identical costumes. (Trivia note: After it was cut from Easter Parade, Irving Berlin attempted to place it in his stage musical Miss Liberty. It was cut a second time. He made a third attempt with Call Me Madam. It was removed again. Berlin gave up after that.) Garland was famously fired out of MGM during the production of the movie of Annie Get Your Gun, and the two numbers she completed (“I’m an Indian Too” and “Doin’ What Comes Natur’lly”) are here, for better or worse. Decades ago, DRG Records released her pre-recorded vocal tracks from Annie on an LP, and Rhino/Turner later issued them on a Garland anthology CD, and while her voice is a little thin her musicality is intact as it always was. What we see in the clips is that she was overly thin, and strained-looking, as she also was in Easter Parade, and clearly not well. But when you hear her replacement, Betty Hutton, trying to compensate for her lack of vocal range (and on a score, don’t forget, that was written for and made famous by Ethel Merman) you understand what was lost to the picture when Garland was not allowed to complete it.\n\nThe best of the outtakes in That’s Entertainment! III is Lena Horne’s reprise of Harold Arlen and “Yip” Harburg’s delicious “Ain’t it the Truth”, cut from Cabin in the Sky allegedly because it depicted a black woman in a bubble-bath. Since the movie, cast entirely with black performers, was one many white audiences — especially in the South — were unlikely to see, I don’t understand why it mattered, especially since all we see of Horne is her shoulders, but according to Hugh Fordin in his book on Arthur Freed, the Hays Office did indeed hector the producer until he cut the scene. It should be noted that an earlier version of “Ain’t it the Truth?” performed by Louis Armstrong as one of Lucifer’s imps in Hell was also excised from the movie, leaving his non-musical presence in the picture as it stands a puzzler and leading the viewer who doesn’t know of this outtake (the production number is on the Turner Classic Movies Music Cabin in the Sky soundtrack and on the Armstrong compilation CD Now You Has Jazz) to ask why MGM hired Louis Armstrong for a musical and then didn’t let him sing or play his horn. I suspect that Freed noted that this somewhat extraneous number was slowing down the story, and deleted it accordingly. As illustrative in their way of period racial tensions are the clips of Horne performing “Can’t Help Lovin’ Dat Man” in Till the Clouds Roll By, which she considered her audition for the role of Julie in Show Boat, and the Ava Gardner vocal outtakes from the subsequent 1951 movie, for which the actress’ voice was eventually removed. Again, I take some issue with Horne’s assertions. Her belief that she must play Julie seemed almost designed to be thwarted since the point of Julie in Show Boat is that her skin is so light her mixed-race status is known only to her and her husband Steve. The problem with casting light-skinned black actresses as Julie (Cleo Laine in London, Lonette McKee twice in major U.S. revivals) is that it gives the game away immediately and causes an intelligent audience member (always assuming such an animal exists now) to wonder how on earth anyone employed with the Cotton Blossom could not know Julie is at least mulatto. But that’s the way of logic in the “post-racial” world of American musical theatre, where as everyone knows Alexander Hamilton was Latino and John Adams a black woman.\n\nThere are several other interesting juxtapositions in That’s Entertainment! III: A cut sequence from The Band Wagon showing Cyd Charisse lip-synching to India Adams’ recording of the Schwartz and Deitz “Two Faced Woman” with Joan Crawford doing the same for a later number in Torch Song, a low-rent affair featuring a glowering Crawford in dark tropical make-up (it’s not “black-face,” despite what the usual gang of online idiots aver — if you want actual blackface, take a look at Garland singing “FDR Jones” in Babes on Broadway sometime) and, for some reason, ripping off her ethnic wig at the end and staring daggers at the audience like an angry Victor/Victoria avant la lettre. Despite my aversion to her, a “backstage look” at Eleanor Powell’s tap routine to “Fascinating Rhythm” as the stage crew shifts the scenery for the moving camera is instructive, as are the clips of Fred Astaire in two different costumes for his “I Wanna be a Dancin’ Man” number in The Belle of New York; Astaire’s dancing is so precisely worked out that the only thing different about him in either clip is the clothing. The producers of this compilation also had the happy notion of removing the opening credits from The Barkleys of Broadway so that we can actually see Astaire and Ginger Rogers dancing the “Swing Trot.” If nothing else, their routine serves as a reminder of what Ginger sacrificed when she embraced tennis in the 1940s: Her once enviably thin, supple body had become more muscular, especially in her arms and shoulders, and in her backless gowns she almost resembles a linebacker in drag. Calling Roberta Muldoon!\n\nMy final word on these movies comes in the nature of a personal plea. While working on this piece I ran across, on Google, something which purported to be a transcription of Howard Dietz’s lyrics for the song “That’s Entertainment!” in The Band Wagon. Everything was going fine until near the end of it I hit this couplet, which stopped me the way a brick wall ends an automotive suicide:\n\nThe gag might be waving the flag\n\nThat began with a mystical hand…\n\nIt’s discouraging enough that the person who transcribed this lyric had never heard of George M. Cohan, the “Mr. Cohan” Dietz invoked in his original lyric. Did he or she have also to make up an idiot phrase like that one? Just what the hell did they think “a mystical hand” was?\n\nPeople — please! If you can’t figure out what a lyric is on hearing it… look it up. Take your mystical hand to a goddamned library if you have to and use it to pull down an actual book. Stop making up utter codswallop out of sheer ignorance and then passing it along for other ignoramuses to replicate.\n\nThose who forget the past are not only doomed to repeat it, they’re doomed to misspell it.\n\n*If you know Cole Porter’s “Be a Clown” number from The Pirate you will recognize, as Irving Berlin did when he heard it, that “Make ’em Laugh” was a direct plagiarism by the MGM musical producer (and one-time lyricist) Arthur Freed, who when called on it stammered that it was just a little something “the kids” came up with. He meant the screenwriters Betty Comden and Adolph Green, neither of whom had a thing to do with the song but onto whom he was trying to shift the blame. Ironically, except for Porter aficionados, “Be a Clown” is now almost completely forgotten while for millions of Singin’ in the Rain acolytes “Make ’em Laugh” is evergreen.\n\n†I couldn’t, in 1974, have anticipated the home video revolution, or premium cable, nor how each was going to make filling in the gaps of the movie past so much easier than the catch-as-catch-can experience of seeking out old movies on commercial television, even as it also killed the theatrical revival of old movies. Video tape was certainly being employed then, largely in America on news programming (sharp eyes also recognized its use on television comedy shows like “All in the Family”; in Britain at the time nearly all series were in the video format) and old issues of magazines such as Film Comment and American Film contain both feature articles about the coming home-video boom and advertisements for the (then wildly expensive) studio titles just then beginning to be sold. But the concept was largely unknown to most Americans, at least until the late 1970s, and if we thought about the commercial availability of old movies at all it was only as related to the relatively rarefied film collectors world of 8-and-16mm.\n\n‡Although my own library is stuffed with such Turner Classic Movies Music wonders as The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind (lushly-produced 2-disc sets) as well as Singin’ in the Rain, Meet Me in St. Louis, Easter Parade, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Royal Wedding, The Bad and the Beautiful, An American in Paris, The Band Wagon, Lust for Life, It’s Always Fair Weather, Gigi, North by Northwest, King of Kings, The Unsinkable Molly Brown and Victor/Victoria, compilations of scores (by Korngold, Morricone and Rózsa) and of songs (Harry Warren and Al Dubin’s output for Busby Berkeley, George and Ira Gershwin, Fred Astaire, Astaire and Rogers, Doris Day, Judy Garland, Lena Horne, Mel Tormé, Louis Armstrong) I have my small quarrels with some of them. Occasionally these TCMM CDs contain a little too much fealty to their sources to make for satisfying listening. In their zeal for completeness, the otherwise estimable producers often include long instrumental introductions to the songs which ought ideally to have been on tracks separated from the songs themselves, and if in the movie the vocal was abruptly halted in mid-verse (Astaire’s “By Myself” is a good example) the CD replicates that screeching halt as well. Completeness is nice, if you can achieve it, and faithfulness has its virtues, but there’s something to be said for records produced with the listener’s pleasure in mind. There is a science, or at least a craft, to good listening presentation, and the TCMM disc producers didn’t always acknowledge or work toward it. When they issued their six-disc boxed set of That’s Entertainment!, for example, they did not include, even as a bonus CD, the original MCA double-LP soundtrack from 1974, which largely contains the songs as heard in that movie and is a model of a well-crafted listening experience. Since no previous CD reissue of that record set exists the best you can do is haul out your old LPs and if they happen to be in decent enough condition, digitize them. (Naturally, the original set was made available on CD in Japan but not in America, where the music originated…) As soon as Time-Warner took control of the Turner empire, of course, it disbanded the Turner Classic Movies Music label. The more money an entertainment corporation has, the less it will spend to maintain, much less restore, its library.\n\n§Among other things, seeing Walker as a young woman explains why it took her so long to become photogenic; despite the obvious talent she evinced, hers was not only a face she had to age into but one which, in her 20s, was almost militantly unattractive, especially when coupled with her aggressive performance style.\n\n¶Friedgen and Sheridan were luckier than the people who put together the 1992 Turner documentary series When the Lion Roars, which completely elided any mention, or clips, of Astaire. This utterly flabbergasting omission was later explained as being entirely due to the usurious (and for documentary and film festival producers, often ruinous) financial compensation demanded by Astaire’s widow Robin for any use of his image. What was okay with Mrs. Astaire? Clips from Fred’s musical numbers in which various props such as the coatrack he danced with in Royal Wedding were digitally altered into representations of Dirt Devil vacuum cleaners. Not since the similarly misguided “protection” of Tennessee Williams’ estate by his executor Maria St. Juste has such a major American cultural figure’s legacy been so badly served, or so needlessly damaged. Where St. Juste was simply over-protective of Williams’ legacy, Astaire was in danger of becoming entirely forgotten for purely mercenary reasons. Fortunately, the Widow Astaire eventually relaxed her inflexibility, but her manipulative control over her late husband’s very image is illustrative of how utterly irrational American copyright laws, dictated by corporations and directed by the grasping heirs and sub-heirs of creative talent, have become.\n\nText copyright 2023 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nOklahoma! (1955) [Todd-AO version / CinemaScope version] The first film adaptation of a Rodgers and Hammerstein show, and the finest.\n\nHe’s never seen anything like it: A delightfully exuberant Richard Attenborough as Blossom, with Rex Harrison’s Dolittle and the Pushmi-Pullyu.\n\nDoctor Dolittle (1967) That this was the picture 20th Century-Fox pinned most of its hopes on in 1967 is as difficult to fathom now as that same studio’s earlier devotion to the money-pit known as Cleopatra was in 1962. That one nearly bankrupted them. Dolittle didn’t do as much damage but it didn’t bring much honor (let alone profits) either. I well remember the picture’s release; I was in precisely the age-group Fox was aiming it at. It was the first non-Disney movie I recall seeing so many commercial product tie-ins for — the sort of thing that we would, a decade later with George Lucas’ Star Wars merchandising, become blasé about was a big deal in ’67. There were children’s cereal tie-ins, toys, games, storybooks, paperback reprints of the Hugh Lofting originals bearing Rex Harrison’s likeness… and records. O, how they had records! The score existed as a soundtrack album, of course, but also in LPs by everyone from Anthony Newley and Sammy Davis, Jr. to Alvin and the Chipmunks. The only thing Doctor Dolittle didn’t get, surprisingly, was a Gold Key comic book. How did Arthur P. Jacobs miss that one?\n\nI don’t think Richard Fleischer’s direction is more than merely competent, and the movie as a whole has more size than real charm. (The original Lofting books, whatever their racial… “limitations,” shall we say?… are almost entirely charming.) Perhaps if it had been conceived, not as a big, sprawling musical but as a smaller and more inventive non-musical fantasy Doctor Dolittle might have been a minor classic of its kind. The presence of Harrison also makes Dolittle rather too Henry Higgins-like for comfort. (Reportedly re-written that way at the star’s insistence… after he first insisted the character be as far from Higgins as possible. That’s what you get when you hire an insecure megalomaniacal drunk as your star.) If it hadn’t been a musical, however, Doctor Dolittle would have lost the one aspect that lifts it above the norm of original musical movies: The Leslie Bricusse score.\n\nIf his screenplay is less sparkling — you can sense the prints of too many fingers on it, and the pushing of a one-sided romance that never takes flight feels weirdly like an exercise in masochism — Bricusse’s songs have a nearly unerring grasp of character, time and place that, combined with their melodiousness, their feeling for mood and their gentle humor, make them almost ideal musical-comedy numbers. Sadly, three of his prettiest ballads (“Beautiful Things,” “Where Are the Words?” and “Something in Your Smile”) were either cut after the premiere or, in the case of the first, cut in half. The footage apparently no longer exists, making the otherwise lovely Twilight Time Blu-ray a bit of a disappointment. I know there are those who hate these songs (when “Talk to the Animals” won the Oscar for Best Song cries of “Oh, no!” were heard in the auditorium) but as I have often said of the Sherman Brothers’ work, if you think it’s easy to compose a clutch of engaging and melodic songs with witty lyrics that can amuse an adult and that a child can also comprehend and appreciate, you write one.\n\nThis was the era of the big “road show” musical, and the second such movie my mother took my sister and me to (the first was The Sound of Music a year or so before) that had an Intermission; a big deal for a seven-year old in 1968. Is the movie any good? It seems to me better than its reputation would suggest, but I lack perspective on it: When a picture enchanted you as a child and holds up generally on adult re-viewing, who knows? It’s entirely possible that I feel about Doctor Dolittle the way younger people do about what I regard as the meretricious garbage they grew up with; Willow comes to mind, and The Goonies, and the movies of John Hughes. Before we trash the taste and pleasures of others’ youths, we would do well to examine our own.\n\nThe Lion in Winter (1968) The movie adaptation by James Goldman of his 1966 play, one of those rare pictures whose wit, and spectacular performances, make it a pleasure no matter how many times you’ve seen it.\n\nJulius Caesar (1953) This moderately engaging Shakespeare adaptation benefits almost entirely from its actors, and from its typically expert Miklós Rózsa score. Certainly Joseph L. Mankiewicz’s direction is merely workmanlike, when it isn’t altogether poor, and its special effects would be inadequate in a high school production. (The storm sequence is almost hilariously bad; I pictured Tom Courtenay off-stage, frantically pounding on kettle-drums and sheet-metal.) James Mason makes a splendid Brutus, acting entirely on principal and haunted by his own deeds, and although she has one scene only, Deborah Kerr as Portia matches him, her warm voice and understated anguish the perfect compliment to his brooding. John Gielgud, long absent from the screen, made a superb return as Cassius, that mellifluous bassoon of a voice first seducing Brutus, then hectoring him and, finally, locating the character’s latent sense of honor. Best of all is Marlon Brando’s Anthony. Although the play is really Brutus’, to Anthony was given the great funeral oration, with which the character subtly alters the mood of the all-too-pliable mob through irony and rhetoric. (Brando creates a nice moment when, his back to the Roman crowd, he smiles briefly, knowing he has them. Mussolini would surely have approved.) Brando went to Gielgud for advice on diction and phrasing, but the approach is unmistakably his own. He makes each phrase sound natural, as if it just occurred to him. He’s not imitating Gielgud; he’s not imitating anyone.\n\nOn the far side of these splendid players are the gaseous Grande Dame posturings of the appalling Greer Garson. Her acting epitomizes what used to be meant by publicists and newspaper writers when they trotted out the word “distinguished.”\n\nDemon Seed (1977) An effective, although not exceptional, adaptation of Dean Koontz’s creepy, truly disturbing cyber-horror novel, arguably more relevant now than it was in 1977, what with transhumanist maniacs like Yuval Harari urging on the mating of humans with machines. Fritz Weaver is an A.I. expert who has created a living computer, and Julie Christie is his estranged wife, who becomes its first victim. The picture suffers from its modest budget and the limitations of the 1970s special effects (about to be rendered altogether redundant by George Lucas) and from a lack of interior logic in its Robert Jaffe/Roger O. Hirson screenplay: When Gerrit Graham as one of Weaver’s employees goes to check on Christie and is murdered by “Proteus IV,” his disappearance is ignored by everyone for the crucial month the computer requires for Christie to carry and give birth to its progeny. Donald Cammell directed competently, although with very little style; but for Bill Butler’s rich cinematography, Demon Seed could almost have been a made-for-TV movie. Jerry Fielding’s musique concrète score is effective in context, although I can’t imagine wanting to listen to it in isolation. Butler, who two years earlier shot Jaws, brings warmth to a cold story with his supple lighting and color. Almost unreservedly grim, the picture has one good in-joke: The chilly, unemotional voice of Proteus IV was provided by the equally frigid Robert Vaughn.\n\nThe Mouse on the Moon (1962) A mildly amusing adaptation of Leonard Wibberly’s satirical novel, itself a sequel to his enormously popular The Mouse That Roared and its inevitable movie. As with the film adaptation of that book, The Mouse on the Moon is more twee than funny, although it manages a few laughs. Margaret Rutherford is charming as the Grand Duchess, but her role is shorter than one would like and she is, curiously, less sweetly moving than Peter Sellers was earlier, in the same part! A lot of good farceurs are in this one, including Ron Moody as the corrupt Prime Minister, Bernard Cribbins as his earnest son, Terry-Thomas as a less than efficacious English spy, the Broadway actor Tom Aldredge (husband of the costume designer Theoni V.) as a hapless Pentagon assistant and David Kossoff as the preternaturally cheerful and unhurried scientist whose discovery that the tiny Duchy’s combustible wine can be used as fuel for a space capsule sets the plot in motion. Michael Pertwee (brother of Jon) wrote the script, and Richard Lester directed in a style that is rather sedate for him — but A Hard Day’s Night was just around the corner.\n\nThe Importance of Being Earnest (1952) Only a true auteurist (or anyway an auteurist home video company) could seriously attach a possessive credit to The Importance of Being Earnest other than Oscar Wilde’s. Yes, Anthony Asquith wrote the adaptation and directed it, but I suspect he would be appalled at being named, as Criterion does, the “creator” of this movie. Thus does the viral insanity of Andrew Sarris infect everything.\n\nWilde’s “Serious Comedy for Trivial People” is one of the great pleasures the English-speaking theatre affords, its torrent of polished witticisms and dizzying aperçus piling up in a manner so intoxicating that in addition to laughing, often, we sit in the theatre smiling in perfect bliss for the play’s three delirious acts. The 1952 movie is briefer than the play — it runs a fast 95 minutes — yet somehow we miss nothing. And if both Michael Redgrave (as Jack) and Michael Denison (Algernon) are a good decade older than their roles, Asquith’s framing device of a theatrical performance is superfluous and Denison’s perennial mode of expression is something between a smirk and a sneer, rendering him less impish than unpleasant, everything else is absolutely right. Asquith’s pitch and pacing are exactly correct, and his cast is nearly perfect. Redgrave, with his dashing mien and rich, plummy voice, is an ideal Jack Worthing, perfectly matched by the serene imbecility of Joan Greenwood’s Gwendolen and Dorothy Tutin’s Cecily. Margaret Rutherford and Miles Malleson are, as always with these two sublime comedians, oases of hilariously unflappable British reserve. And if it does nothing else, the movie preserves Edith Evans’ peerless Lady Bracknell. Her performance is so perfectly calibrated, her characterization so utterly certain of the rightness of its extreme rectitude and absurd traditions, her memory must present a formidable hurdle to any actor assaying the role. How do you make it your own when she got every line so magnificently right before you? And yes, everything you may have heard about her reading of the outraged line “A handbag?” is correct; no matter how many times I hear it, Evans’ exquisite comic phrasing always elicits from me a gale of explosive hilarity. As an added fillip, Desmond Dickinson’s rich photography, like the delicious British light music score by Benjamin Frankel, makes the thing like a colorful bonbon, as charming to look at as to ingest.\n\nJohn Simon always maintained that intelligent laughter was the very best sort. There are fewer pure fonts of it than this.\n\nSatchmo (1988) The superb jazz (and, lately, movie) critic Gary Giddins’ heartfelt 1988 tribute to one of his idols, and mine. Written by Giddins and co-directed by him and Kendrick Simmons, Satchmo charts the astonishing youthful rise of one of the few undisputed musical geniuses of the 20th century, illustrating just why he, more than anyone of his time, defined the parameters of the form and the place of the great solo artist within it; his sometimes troubled middle-age; and his transcendent emeritus years, when the taint of Uncle Tomism, never fair, began to fall away and Armstrong’s importance could be more broadly understood. When his great Hot Fives and Hot Sevens recordings from the late 1920s were reissued on LP around the time Giddins’ documentary was airing on PBS, they were a revelation: While Armstrong was hardly the first jazz performer — the genre predated his arrival in it by decades — those records made it feel as if he was inventing jazz right on the spot. Next to an astonishment like “West End Blues,” almost everything that came before was literally marking time.\n\nDespite Hattie Winston’s passionless and undistinguished narration, Satchmo does for Armstrong, in 90 minutes, what it takes Ken Burns, in Jazz, 10 episodes to do. The live footage of Armstrong in Copenhagen in 1933 alone justifies the entire event.\n\nDivorce American Style (1967) Few things date faster than topical humor. Divorce American Style was old-hat two years after its release, when no-fault divorce became the law of the land in California, where the movie is set, and its then-scathing satire instantly devolved from amusingly au courant to hopelessly passé. So if you like the picture as I do and have since seeing it on television in the mid-‘70s, you have to approach it as a period-piece — even though its Norman Lear/Robert Kaufman screenplay has infinitely more bite to it than William Rose’s Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, the script that bested it at the 1967 Oscars. This was one of Dick Van Dyke’s few non-family friendly projects of the ‘60s, and one of his best. He’s the husband impoverished by his state’s punitive divorce laws, although I would think being married to Debbie Reynolds was punishment enough.\n\nWhile there is some sharp dialogue and several cleverly conceived and executed sequences, usually set to Dave Grusin’s inspired faux-Baroque music (the opening titles, in which the evening’s suburban arguments are orchestrated by a conductor; the scene in which each warring spouse attempts to thwart the other’s abilities to strip their joint bank holdings; the Sunday-fathers’ gathering of the clans; and a prolonged silent fight between Reynolds and Van Dyke, punctuated entirely by slamming doors and sliding cabinets) much of the humor of the picture lies in its canny casting: Jason Robards, Jr. as the tragi-comic divorcée hoping to pair his ex (Jean Simmons) with Van Dyke, to get him off the financial hook that is literally destroying his heath; Shelley Berman and Richard Gautier as overly pally divorce lawyers; Joe Flynn as an ethical philandering husband; Martin Gabel as a humorless couples’ therapist; Lee Grant as an insulted call-girl; Tom Bosley as a divorced man explaining the intricacies of weekend fatherhood to a bewildered Van Dyke; Van Johnson as a square, mother-ridden car dealer; and in smaller roles, Emmaline Henry, the “hip hypnotist” Pat Collins (as herself), Shelley Morrison, Eileen Brennan as Robards’ girlfriend (this was her first movie) and, as Van Dyke and Reynolds’ knowing sons, Gary Goetzman and Tim Matheson, the once and future Jonny Quest.\n\nConrad L. Hall’s muted color photography and Ferris Webster’s often effective editing make this one of the rare ‘60s comedies that has more in common with the kineticism of The Graduate than with the glorified Universal television look of a Doris Day vehicle. After a second bracing Van Dyke black comedy (Cold Turkey in 1971) and the 1973 Ryan O’Neal caper The Thief Who Came to Dinner the director Bud Yorkin and his writer and co-producer Norman Lear would develop All in the Family for television and pretty much turn their backs on the movies for good. Interesting too that the fruits of their TV empire, the rather pointedly-named Tandem Productions, which encompassed All in the Family, Maude, Good Times and Sanford and Son, should now be referred to solely as Norman Lear’s. There’s nothing like having good P.R.\n\nLady and the Tramp (1955) The first Disney animated feature in widescreen and among the most pleasing of all full-length cartoons.\n\nHearts of the West (1975) is one of those puzzlers that occasionally crop up: A bright, funny little movie about a hapless Candide in the early days of cheap talkie Westerns with a charming script and a wonderful cast that went by the wayside when it was released and, for reasons that absolutely defy logic, bombed at the box office. What were its “must-see” competitors in the marketplace in October, 1975? Tom Laughlin in The Master Gunfighter? Diana Ross in Mahogany? The “Blaxploitation” Western Take a Hard Ride? That last is not a slur, by the way; I like Take a Hard Ride enormously. I’m simply saying that Hearts of the West had very little real competition for moviegoers’ bucks, and none remotely as good.*\n\nSharply and wittily written by Rob Thompson and efficiently directed by Howard Zieff, it’s a breezy, quirky fable of a Western-obsessed youth (Jeff Bridges), determined to become a novelist, who after inadvertently foiling a pair of con artists (Richard B. Shull and Anthony James) and accidentally absconding with their loot, takes refuge with the cowboys at a Poverty Row studio. Thompson, who later wrote for Northern Exposure and Monk, has a gift for the unexpected; his characters don’t always act the way we think they will, and his narratives veer off into avenues that, while perhaps puzzling at first, eventually resolve themselves, within the gentle madness of the conception, in ways that are eminently reasonable. And, unlike with Richard Rush’s far more highly lauded The Stunt Man, Thompson respects the physical realities of filmmaking. Everything about the picture works, from the soft, lovely cinematography by Mario Tosi and the sometimes hilariously accurate art direction by Robert Luthardt and set decoration by Charles B. Pierce to the cunning period costumes by Patrick Cummings and Ron Talsky. Zieff’s direction is clean and uncluttered, and he gets the most from Thompson’s script and from his actors, who aside from a typically wonderful Bridges include Alan Arkin as an excitable director, the sublime Blythe Danner as his practical assistant, and Andy Griffith as a Western gunfighter with a secret. It was the best screen role Griffith had lucked onto since the 1957 A Face in the Crowd, and you can well understand why he was still bitter about the movie’s financial failure a decade later.\n\n*It appears the Bill Cosby-Sidney Poitier comedy Let’s Do it Again was the big winner in October of 1975 — presumably on the strength of Jimmy “J.J.” Walker, then the inexplicably popular star of Good Times, in a co-starring role — along with the Walter Hill period bare-knuckle boxing picture Hard Times and the belated True Grit sequel (and African Queen rip-off) Rooster Cogburn starring the unlikely duo of John Wayne and Katharine Hepburn.\n\nAfter the apocalypse: Helen Mirren and River Phoenix look to Harrison Ford for a sane reaction to their latest disaster. They won’t get it.\n\nThe Mosquito Coast (1986) Harrison Ford gives what may be his finest performance, in a very good movie almost no one has seen.\n\nThe Weavers: Wasn’t That a Time! (1982) Jim Brown’s absolutely wonderful documentary, ostensibly on the final Carnegie Hall reunion concert by The Weavers but really about American values in adversity and defiance in the face of repression is especially relevant now, as hundreds of millions behave like sheep over a winter influenza virus and gratefully permit their various versions of Big Brother to squeeze yet more liberty from their already diminished lives.\n\nFar from the Madding Crowd (1967) John Schlesinger and Frederic Raphael’s gorgeous but frustratingly flawed adaptation of Thomas Hardy’s wonderful novel.\n\nText copyright 2020 by Scott Ross"
