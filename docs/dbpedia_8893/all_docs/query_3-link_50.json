As the curtain-raiser for a series of antinuclear events, 160 nongovernment delegates from 31 nations and 13 international organizations begin today the 1983 World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs in Tokyo .\n\nThe 30-member American delegation included Benjamin Sanders, director of intelligence evaluation at the United Nations Disarmament Issues Bureau.

U.N. projections point to an increase in worldwide urbanization in the next four decades, and Professor Paul Bairoch of the International Labor Organization says that is not good news .\n\nIf you want a decent place to live with good job prospects and housing, better schools, and generally healthier surroundings, pick a city with no more than 600,000 inhabitants, an ILO report says. Bairoch found that there are population thresholds beyond which serious urban problems arise. \"Traffic congestion starts to strangle a city when its population reaches the 200,000 mark,\" he said, and at that point city authorities \"should start investing in mass transit.\" Pollution becomes a major threat in temperate-zone cities with more than 600,000 people and when the population tops the 2-million mark, the would-be town-dweller should look elsewhere, he said. \"Both life and work are very difficult in any place that big,\" Bairoch said. \"Not only does the job market get worse, but crime rates soar and the quality of housing and education is lower.\" ."
