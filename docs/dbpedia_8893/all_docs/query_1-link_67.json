        "text": "In a hamlet in the Tyrol an old lady is not virile, She is languishing and heavy is her heart.\n\nFor she thinks about her baby who, had he been\n\nchristened Abie,\n\nMaybe might have never played the monster’s part. If her son had only married, if her lust had not\n\nmiscarried,\n\nWho can say for certain what might not have been. In her somber weeds of sorrow she is hopeful some\n\ntomorrow\n\nWill undo the passion that produced a sin.\n\nSchickelgruber! Schickelgruber!\n\nYou were born a child of shame.\n\nYou have always been a bastard,\n\nEven though you changed your name.\n\nCame the headlines, then the breadlines, As your will to power grew. Schickelgruber, Schickelgruber!\n\nWhat a pretty how-dy-do. Though a mother, I can smother Mother love at thought of you.\n\nIn his youth his one obsession was to practice a profession,\n\nAnd he dabbled with the palette and the paint.\n\nBut the art he couldn’t master, so he went from paint\n\nto plaster,\n\nAnd today he calls himself a plaster saint.\n\nIs he good or evil fairy? All his pals have now\n\ngrown wary,\n\nThat is, those of them who didn’t rate the purge. And the scent will ever linger, how he gave his\n\nfriends the finger\n\nJust to gratify and culminate an urge.\n\nSchickelgruber! Schickelgruber! Once the dew was on the rose.\n\nWhere you’ll end up in the wind-up, Schickelgruber, Heaven knows.\n\nEver ruthless, ever truthless,\n\nWhen the judgment day is due. Repercussions from the Russians, Schickelgruber, say you’re through. Every village that you pillage\n\nIn revenge will turn on you."
