He seems not to have realized this, for by his last will and testament he bequeaths the use of these to his wife, Anna Catharina, for her lifetime. She died before March 28, 1812, for on that day, a second inventory of the personal property of Christian Metzger (in the use of his wife) was filed at Easton. Up until this date she had occupied the Mill, and it had been operated by Christian Metzger's heirs. On March 28, 1812, the actual owner came from under cover, and by indenture, conveyed the Mill and the thirty- five acres of land to Abraham Yeakel of lierford Township, Berks County. The consideration was Four Hundred xwenty- five Pounds, lawful money. The title still rests in the Yeakel family. In the frontispiece Mr. L. F. Yeakel, a grandson of Abraham, stands in the foreground, he was born in the residence quarters of this Mill.

Metzger daughters who marry have a complete lineage of their descendants set under their name where it appears in the list of their father. These descendants are in¬ dexed in the \"Other Names\" Index. All daughters are in¬ dexed in the \"Metzger Index.\" An unusual device has been used for numbering addi¬ tional pages which must be set in for Metzger Families who were discovered after this book was paged, indexed, and regarded as completed. l'his device numbers a page, then puts in additional pages of the same number with the index a, b, c. For example, additional pages may follow 164 by being numbered 164a, 164b, 164c, etc., ad lib.

One should not add \"Germany. This Kingdom, Wiirttemberg, had been an independent constitutional monarchy since the days of riartin Luther, and rrotestant. So it remained for a century and a quarter longer, or until absorbed into the German Empire, 1871, at a time when the people of the American Commonwealth, whom Christian Metzger had joined, were planning their first National Centen¬ nial. Born in Lorch, Kingdom of Wiirttemberg, Christian was the youngest of eight brothers and one sister. Justin Metzger, his father, died when Christian was fourteen. He remained by his mother until her death. Then with no tie or responsibility he came to the Colony of Pennsylvania. Christian Metzger's family rated as members of the Official Class » of Lorch. When Christian was a baby, too young to recall it later, his father had gone as a Delegate, for four consecutive years, to sit in the Lower Chamber of the National Assembly at Stuttgart, the Capital. Christian's grandfather, Johann Georg Metzger, was Mayor (Burgomaster) x of Lorch for fifteen years, a wealthy and influential man. Christian's mother was the daughter of the Head of Public Schools of Lorch. There was a Protestant College at Lorch. The musician, Schumann, received his education in this college. It must be understood that the young Christian Metzger had had such associates before coming to America. All his brothers and his sister, as well as he, had been baptized with a long list of prominent local people as sponsors, standing by the font in the Established (Lutheran) Church of his home town. And so had his an¬ cestors for two hundred years back. These functions were carefully re¬ corded in the Seelregister by the Curate of the Parish. This was the background Christian Metzger brought to Pennsylvania on October 23, 1752. He lived up to his background as nearly as a German-speaking man could in an official English-speaking community, pioneering in a raw, new world on a new Continent. His first five years in America were lived in Germantown, now a part of Philadelphia, but then an aristocratic suburb for the English, and a lively center for all German immigrants coming to the Colony and going on further for land. He attended the (now historic) German Lutheran Church St. Michael's, and married, at its altar, a girl from Alsace, Catharine Haiisser. In 1757 he and his young wife moved to Zionsville, (now \"Old Zionsville\") where Peter Htittel had started a village on the famous \"King's Highway.\" Peter Httttel was in the real estate business, and ex¬ pected Christian would buy some land when he had looked things over, and made a choice. Christian did make a choice, but to a thrifty tiller of the soil his selection was the poorest in all peter Htittel had to sell. It lay on Indian Creek, beyond Bald Hill, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge, where xi . -• ......... this picturesque stream tumbles down over a cliff. He took 113 acres here, but with no intent of agriculture. He was looking for water-power. Christian Metzger was a millwright. He planned to build and operate a mill. He was a dreamer, and he dreamed of constructing his home-town industry at Lorch, here, on Indian Creek, in Pennsylvania. Christian had grown up by a mill on a lake made by a dam in the snow-fed, tumbling Hems River, racing around Lorch, as it came down the western slopes of the Alps. When grown he had worked in this mill on the lake. In fact, the owners of the mill, the Hohenstauff en Family, had given a concession to Justin Metzger to build his new house on the grounds by the mill, and so this lake and mill had become the very substance of / the young Christian Metzger's life. By the year 1782, Christian was building the dream mill. The re¬ sult was the historic landmark, the fine stone structure, still standing (1941) on Indian Creek, called by the present generation \"Yeakel's Mill.\" Fine engineering is exhibited in the structure of this mill. He built a dam which created a good deep pond. He carried the mill-race through the mill so that the huge water wheel could be under roof inside the mill protected from the weather. The arch in the substructure of the building through which the sluice waters are returned to the stream is a piece of masonry equal in structural beauty to the famous \"Cloaca Maxima” at Rome. The entire building has symmetry as well as durability, and even the living quarters are planned with charm of arrangement. However, Christian's imagination over-leaped his purse, apparently. At any rate, at the time of his death in 1803 his mill was being bandied about in a series of clandestine court-actions, although his heirs, with some claim to title, operated it for a decade longer, or until Christian's wife, too, had died. xii qu ■ On the next day after her death the mill end thirty-four acres of land with it, source of the water power, were openly transferred to a neighbor, who, in 1816, sold it to Abraham Yeakel, whose heirs still hold the title. Christian Metzger’s estate was in Court fifteen years, pending settlement, Lsing the measuring stick devised for changing values between 1800 A.D. and 1940 A.D., made by Arthur found the Yale Economist, Christian would be worth *10,000.00 today. He lived well, according to the stand¬ ards of his time. His ten-plate stove (the \"Bible-in-Iron\" ) and his master’s bedstead were inventoried, on his death, at the highest price. He had a bath tub and a gold inkwell. His store of household linen, and his linen shirts and handkerehief s , were much above the usual quota. His imported German Bible rated at a higher value than any in six inven¬ tories of deceased heads of families during the same decade in Northamp¬ ton and the adjoining Counties, Bucks, Lancaster, or Montgomery, embracing such names as Kern, Landis, Nickey, Strassburger and Schleiffer. He was a charter member of the Lutheran Church at Old Zionsville. The pastors of this church taught his seven children, baptized, cate¬ chized, and married them. The Kev. John Paul Frederick Kramer, pastor 1797-1803, signed Christian's Last Will and Testament, and conducted his funeral rites. Although no stone marks his grave his body lies buried in this spacious churchyard. But his name did not perish in his unmarked grave. By his Last Will and Testament, after providing for his wife, leaving her his entire estate, undivided and unchanged for her lifetime, he orders, on her death, that his property real, personal and movable, shall be rendered into cash or bonds and divided into seven equal portions to be given to his seven children whom he then names in chronological order: xiii To Elizabetha, joined in marriage with Philip Witman, but now a widow; To Catharina, joined in marriage with Abraham Meyer, but now deceased; l'o Friedrich Metzger, his only son; To Anna Margarita, joined in marriage with Jacob Schiffert; To Anna Maria, first joined in marriage with Nicholaus Koch, but after his death married, second, to Friedrich Miller; To Anna Eva, joined in marriage with John Adam Schiffert; To Anna Cristina, joined in marriage with Heinrich Harttman. Christian’s will was exhibited and proved at Easton October 18th, 1803. An inventory of his personal property and movables was sworn to and filed on the same day by Philip Walter and Frederick Kramer. The posterity of Christian constitutes a distinct lineage of Metz¬ gers, now residing in every section of the United States. A few of the many outstanding men in this lineage, in active life 1930-1940, may be listed here: Dr. Oliver P. Medsger, naturalist and author, recipient of the John Burrough's medal award; Alton T. Medsger, Radio Engineer R.C.A. Communications, Inc., New York; Oren Metzger, author, and President of the Crossville Tennessee Housing Corporation; Daniel A.

Heu'e ist das a lies nicht mehr : diemittelalterlichenBefestigungensind g efa lien, das Sch loB steht nicht mehr, nur einige sparliche Ruinen finden wirauf dem Berge und von den vierToren ist nur noch das Hacktor zu sehen. Aber auch die beiden Turme der Stiftskirche ha- ben weichen mussen und muBten der Kuppel Platz machen (1749). Herrenberg wird im Jahre 1228 zum erslen Male erwahnt, doch ist die Stadt zweifellos viel alter. Sie kann aufeine reicheVergangenheitzurucksehen. Im Jahre 1368 kam sie durch Kaufans HausWurtlemberg. Im Bauernkrieg 1525 wurde Herrenberg von den Bauern sechs Stunden lang gesturmt und dann eingenommen. Schwer litt Stadt und Amt Herrenberg im dreiBigjahrigen Krieg durch Ein- quartierungen u. Kriegslasten, auch legte 1635 ein furcht- barer Brand fast die ganze Stadt in Schutt und Asche. Dasselbe Schicksal war ihr schon 1466 widerfahren. Her¬ renberg ist der Geburtsort einer groBen Reihe beruhmter Mdnner : wirnennen Valentin Andrea, dann den herzogl. Bau- meister Heinrich Schickhardt.

I find also the record of a baptism: Elizabetha, daughter of Christian Metzger and Anna Catharine Metzger, born July 22, 1756, was baptized on the 29th of August 1756. Sponsors were Heinrich Bamberger and Elizabetha Bamberger. Two or three notes, which may be clear to you, if you know the German: I take it that the word burtig is a corruption of geburtig. \"Hausserin\" you will recognize as a feminine form of Hausser. I am unable to decipher the name of the town in the Pfalz where she was born. ' The records of the Church have never been published, so that no copy is available.

I i > Old Zionsville Lutheran Church Photograph by Oliver Perry Medsger, 1941 41 INTRODUCTION The dramatized history of CHRISTIAN METZGER, the mill-wright, has been built out of a box of jack-straws. The \"straws\" have been collected during forty years of search, working from the known to the unknown. The far-flung sources are listed below. All names of persons, all place names, all dates, all historical incidents, buildings, ships, publications or any item used in this story, are actually factual and were or are existent. Christian Metzger did not come to the Colonies in 1752 seeking relief from religious persecution, as did the Pilgrim Fathers of New England, or the Swiss Mennonites of Pennsylvania. Neither did he carry a land-grant in his pocket nor a colonization scheme in his head, as did many a founder of an American Family in the South, or in Pennsylvania. It must be confessed that nothing more serious than a desire to see the New World and try his luck induced him to break away from well-established family and church connections, and a government in which the people had a voice. The Kingdom of Wiirttemberg, land of his birth, it must be under¬ stood, lay in the \"Heart of the World\" as defined by Ralph Adams Cram, in his discussion of the source of all modern culture. It lay on the western slope of the Alps and reached to the Rhine. It had been a Con¬ stitutional Monarchy since the day of Duke Ulrich ana Lutheranism. It had two Houses in its National Assembly. Christian's own father had been a member of the Lower House. This government existed when Christian left Wilrtterberg for America, and still existed for almost a century after the Independence of the Colonies in America was established. Not until the \"iron hand\" of the Prussian, Bismarck, appeared (1370) did Wtirttem- 42 II berg beoo me a part of the Gorman Enpire. In Wurttemberg literacy, health, the arte and architecture rated high — higher than in any Ger- rAn-ep ea. king small State. Chrietian Metzger's constructive imagination ran away with his horse sense. Or did it? He wanted to try his hand at developing, in the Kew World, a fine stone mill with water power like the fine stone mill near which he had lived all his young life on the tumbling Rems, at Lorch, beautiful and old historic town of Lorch, on the western slopes of the Alps. Opportunity seemed to be in the New World. Christian realized his dream, built his mill, and lost it, through strained and helpless financing apparently, to real estate sharks; but it is probable that his inability to grasp the intrioacies of the Eng¬ lish language and the English law of the land he had sworn allegiance to was a prime factor in his financial failure. Nevertheless, he lived well — above the level of many wealthier colonists, his contemporaries. He reared seven children to maturity, American citizens, six daughters and one son. This son entered the War for Independence at Valley Forge, age seventeen, and remained in service until its close. Ghristian left a secured livelihood to his wife who survived him nine years, and a decent residue to his children. Hie contribution to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and through it to the Democracy of these United States of America, which had been es¬ tablished before his death, may be estimated simply in the amazing achieve¬ ment and distinction of his descendants living today, in the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Generations and residing from Coast to Coast, from Puget Sound to the Gulf. 43 Their attack and progress in the conquest and development of the Public Domain, their contribution to taxes, their support of education and public works, reflect the ambition, the imagination, the dogged per- severence of Christian Metzger the Founder. It is a historical tale to be taken into account now in these days when democracy is called to prove itself. 44 TEE MILL-WEIGHT Time: Place: Sotting: Soene : _ o First Episode The Funeral May 17, 1752. Late afternoon. Lorch, once a fortress on the limes of the Eoman Empire; now a town of 5000 or more people, lying along the banks of the tumbling Rems in the foothills of the Alps where they slope northwesterly into the Kingdom of Wurttenberg, Germany. A two-storey half-timbered house near the Mill on the Lake. The living-room of this house, with late 17th century furniture; a window overlooking the lake. Christian Metzger stalked into the living-room from the street door; placed his formal black hat on the carved console-table, where, under the top, lay the imposing Family Bible; stirred the embers' in the fireplace, giving them some pine boughs, for the evenings were chilly. Then he slumped into one of the two worn easy-chairs, before the blaze. From his mother's funeral Christian had walked home from the Es¬ tablished Church, where his family had been communicants for three gener¬ ations. He needed to collect his thoughts. The last few days had been full of tension — in fact, the last two years had been continued stress ended in sorrow. Christian was a young man, tall, slender, with brown hair curling above a high, rather square brow, beneath which his hazel eyes looked at you with a merry twinkle, but blazed yellow fire if angered. He stroked his youthful beard, carelessly parted into two points, and finally rested his head against his hand. 45 He was reviewing the events just closed, As he pictured the scene of the last rites for his mother, at the altar of her church, he thought: \"The soft light of the apse seemed like a halo about her, there, by the altar-rail where she had often knelt for the communion, where she had knelt in marriage, my clever mother, her head now resting in her cof¬ fin near the baptismal font, where, nine times, she, Barbara tfolt, the schoolmaster’s daughter, had stood with her proud husband, Justin Metzger, son of Burgomaster Johann George, and the company of sponsors who appeared at the christenings of her sons and daughter.” This last service had been read by gray-haired Curate Jahn, now forty years his mother’s pastor. The Herr Doctor Johann Wendel Bullfinger, Superior Prelate of the Diocese, had presided. Forty years earlier Herr Bullfinger had stood as god-father to her first son, named Johann Georg, for his pompous grandsire. They had laid her in a grave by her husband's in the ancient church¬ yard while official dignitaries of Lorch and her friends waited sorrowfully. \"Beautiful, as she deserved,\" Christian said, aloud. The emptiness of the room reminded him that it had been but a year since his brother, .Albrecht, had been buried there by the church, and that the earth was yet fresh and brown over the grave of Friedrich, his favorite brother, placed there only three months ago. After that, his aging mother had failed rapidly, and now she, too, was gone; Only Ludwig and Eannes were left — of his seven brothers! \"Death comes not single handed:\" he felt the weight of the old adage. Vivid, still, was his memory of the passing of his gay, society- loving oldest brother, Johann Georg, in the very prime of life, and then of his father who had weakened and died, leaving him to be brought up by his mother, \"I was only fourteen, thenl Well, she did it well'. I am twenty- 46 . five now, -- and single, a freeman, the world and life still before! \" A glint of rosy light, reflected from the Lake through the window, caught his eye. The sun was setting. Into his mind flashed the word, \" America.\" Over at the Hart Inn, the Inn his grandfather had built, he had heard much talk of the opportunity in America, especially in Penn’s Colony. It had stirred his fancy -- but then he had his mother to staff in her declining years o Now, - ? He would set out for America’ From now on, it should be America^ Buoyantly he stood up, as if he would start that minute i! The noise of things being moved in the kitchen recalled him to the present. \"Magda’ - Magdalena! 1\" he euramondd. The complacent face and iron-gray hair of the housekeeper appeared in the doorway. \"Magda, I am going up to the Hart for supper, tonight. I want to talk with Uncle Michael. But, listen, Magda; order the butcher's boy to bring you a fresh-ares sed fowl for tomorrow’s dinner. It is Sunday, and after the service I shall bring Ludwig and Hannes with their wives to dinner with me, here at home!\" \"Ach, sehr gut, Herr Christian! \" answered the devoted Magdalena, and returned again to her kitchen. Christian lit his pipe and began moving about. Every gesture seemed to confirm his decision to go to America. Up in his own room he took off his formal black, and put on his smock and cap. This room looked d out over the fine Lake, where he had always played, and the Mill, com¬ pletely a part of his life. But the sun had set. The darkness had closed down over familiar scenes, and so strengthened his vision of America, 47 At The Hart Inn Upon the Eerberg, the Hart Inn, the most stately hostelry in Lorch, was aglow with light, .Apart from the guests in the great room with its elaborate plaster-work ceiling and huge open fires, at the upper end on a low dais, the Host, Michael Metzger, and his wife were enjoying their supper with their nephew, Christian, This young man wanted to tell his uncle his decision, but, he reasoned, it were better to lead gradually to the plan that was absorbing him, \"I think Ludwig will want to take mother's house,\" he said, rtIf he thinks of it, will you finance him, so that I may have my inheritance in ready cash?” No response from Uncle Michael, \"It would seem only fair that Elizabeth should be given mother's movables. She is her only daughter, and she would cherish these family things, even if they are old and worn by the rough usage of so many boys,\" he continued, \"Would you come up here and lodge with your Uncle, at the Inn?\" asked Uncle Michael's wife, \"I think not, ioant. I have no bonds now, and I think I will make my future in .America,\" -- He turned to his uncle — In Penn's Colony, Uncle Michael, I plan to make a place for myself,\" Uncle Mike dropped his knife by his plate. He rested against the high-backed dining chair. He gazed at his good-looking nephew, \"In Gottes N&menl Das ware mir nicht im Schlafe eingef allenl 1 - \" But, soon, he declared that were he twenty-f ive instead of sixty-four, he would go alongll The steps necessary to be taken for so momentous a change, somewhat vague, were discussed, and having been gone over, Christian rose to go 48 ' hone. \"What would you work at in Penn's Colony, Christ?\" \"What Metzger cannot weave? — or bake, in a pinch. Uncle Mike? Wasn't Grandfather, Johann Georg, head of the Bakers' Guild, as well as Mayor of Lorch? They certainly eat bread in Rmericai But I was born by the Mill on the Lake. There I played as a boy. Naturally I love the Mill. I chose to work in the Mill when I picked a trade. 1 think they will need mill-wrights in America. Whatever else, the land. Uncle Michael! There will be land to be had everywhere, ns soon as I have my bearings there, I will buy land. I will make a plantation!\" \"But the passage across the ocean will cost much!\" replied Uncle Michael. \"The journey down the Rhine is long and hard.\" \"In Stuttgart, first, I will get information from the ships' agents — what ships are sailing, when, and hew much the passage money. Young men, with no family may work their way down the Rhine, down to Rotterdam, on a lumber-barge from the Black Forest. I night do that,\" said the hopeful Christian. Walking arm in arm with his nephew, nichael Metzger accompanied him to the door. . \"Should Ludwig decide to take your mother's house, I will see what can be done about financing him. ochlafen Sie wohl ! * * * 49 Second Episode i The Snow Hawley Anchors on The De lew are Time: October 22, 1752. Evening. Place: Delaware Kiver, harbor of Philadelphia, Colony of Penn. Setting: The Snow Hawley in foreground, riding at anchor, sails furled, being a nifty little two-masted sailing vessel. Other vessels and river boats in background. Scene: Upper deck of the Hawley. Sunset Light. Captain George Grove stands it foreground, the Kate near. The ship's clerk seated at a small table, ship's list before him. The men of the passenger list come up through the hatchways and stand about at attention, but seeing much by the side vision of their eyes. They seem travel-weary, but their sober, expectar. faces reveal a sense of being in possession of themselves, as though the earth once more were under their feet. Captain to Clerk: \"Call the roll.\" (Clerk calls off the names cn | the list; 138 men say \"aye.\") II Captain: \"1 have called you on deck to instruct you as to procedure in disembarking, tomorrow morning. First, the mate will read the Oath of Allegiance to Xing George of England and the British Empire, whose subjects you become when allowed to leave this ship and settle in Penn’s ' Colony. You will be sworn to this allegiance at the Court House which you see, yonder, on the ship's left. (He points.) The Kate will read | in German.\" * The Kate: (Heads Oath of Allegiance.) Captain: \"All your boxes and paraphernalia which you have with yo fcr your convenience while crossing must be well packed, and your women and children with this freight will be on this upper deck, ready, at 9 50 - . o'clock. The men will be landed first, to go to the Court house. After taking the oath, they will return to the ship and help with disembarking the women and children, along with the freight.” Captain Grove retires to the forecastle. The 138 men slowly drift back down the hatchways to their families, chatting in small groups, be¬ fore going, and feasting their eyes on the land and skyline. Last to leave the deck is the tall and slender young Christian Metzger, unencum¬ bered, who, fascinated, has lingered on deck till the darkness has faded out the last vestige of a roof-line or a church steeple of the New World, no w at his feet. This Christian we saw last at supper with his uncle Michael Metzger at the hart Inn in the small town of Lorch, WiUrttemberg. he is still buoyant, self-contained, and carries an air of self-assurance. The Snow Cawley is not as big as some of the sailing vessels carry¬ ing passengers across the Atlantic in the 18th century, but because she carried a try-sail abaft her main-mast, and because the skill and honor of her captain, George Grove, were rumored around, a large \"cargo\" of emi¬ grants had \"shipped\" who, without much sickness, had endured the miseries of a tedious voyage, and who, now, were tensely organizing their effects with the hope of setting foot on solid ground, in the morning. The Raw- ley had left Rotterdam more than a month ago, had called at Plymouth, and now, safe at anchor on the Delaware, was preparing, too, to disembark her cargo of ambitious German and Swiss people, whom she had brought in safety across the Ocean — the vast expanse of the Atlantic, now stretch¬ ing backward between them and their Fatherland. These nervous, excited people will be up before the sun, carrying their baggage to the upper deck, dressing themselves for the changes of the forthcoming landing, and new transportation by land, and new shelter for themselves and their belongings. ♦ * * 51 1 4 I 3 Third Episode The Oath of Allegiance ~ * 'L _ \" ) ;; Time: Next raorningo Place: Philadelphia,, Setting: The Court House and Square, Second Streeto To the left the Delaware River; right, early Colonial houses; background, the pretentious steeple i t] i of Christ Church. Scene: Rectangular Court Room, forty by seventy feet. At the long side, facing the door, is a high dais and desk for the presiding officer. On a lower dais, with a balustrade, is a table on which lies a Bible, the huge lea- i ther-bound Court kegister, quills and an inkwell. Through the high, wide, j ') round-headed windows of the Court Room, to the east, is visible the river, \\ 1 where the vessel Rawley rides at anchor. In the background, the brig Two-Brothers, arrived two days earliep, is now lying at anchor waiting I for orders to return. Sloops, scows and river boats lie about. On the - strand a group of \"foreigners” are seen, huddled, who slowly form into f line and march, single file, toward the Court House. On the side, at in- tervals, ship's officers act as marshals. The men are pale, some look half sick. There is suspense, little conversation. Although it is early, some casual loafers are about the strand and square. Agents from the coffee houses parade, with billboards hanging fore and aft, calling out i' German the helps they can furnish for fresh arrivals from overseas. Inside, seated on the high dais, is Edward Shippen Esq. Standing below are attaches of the Court. As the line of men enters the Count Room, eleventh to come in is the brown-haired, hazel-eyed Christian Metzger, alert, , unaware of anything to fear. When perhaps twenty men have come inside the door, it is closed. M attache reads the Oath of 52 ^legianoe to the British Crown, and the men are sworn en masse* Then each signs his name on the Court Register, or makes his mark. Having done this, he leaves from a side door, to return to the ship. This procedure continued until the entire number, one hundred thirty-eight men, have subscribed to the oath. Who is this Christian Metzger who, so whole-heartedly, has added him-. self to the people of America? what does he bring to the Hew World? Let us read, here0 Lorch, his hometown, is situated in the heriditaments of the Hohen- r-tauffen Lords, noted Homan Catholic nobility. On the Marienberg, lying above the town, are the buildings of the former Benediotine Monastery founded by Frederick of Hohenstauffen. However, after 1517 Luther's Refor¬ mation spread through Wurttemberg. In 1534, Duke Ulrich put the Reforma¬ tion through and made Lutheranism the established church. In the taxlists of Duke Ulrich's realm, at Stuttgart, the Metzger ancestors of Christian are recorded as taxpayers and his loyal subjects. In 1563, the Benedic¬ tine Monastery was changed into an Evangelical College, thus adding to the town a contingency of both students and professional teachers. Christian could trace his ancestors back through the Established Church Records at Lorch, Goppengen, and Herrenberg to Ulrich's time. a His grandfather, Johann Georg Metzger, became a judge of the Court of Common Pleas at Lorch in 1690. In 1697 he was chosen Burgomaster (Mayor) of Lorch — a position he held for fifteen years. Christian's father, Johann Justin, represented Lorch, as Selectman in the Lesser Council of Wurtt, at Stuttgart, for over four years. AH Germans not of the nobility, have a trade. What were the trades of Christian's ancestors? Fcr generations they were cloth -weavers, cloth-makers of Herrenberg 53 and of GSppengen. Johann Georg chose to be a baker. He followed this trade for over seven years. He was long the Head of the Bakers' Guild. But he became an Inn-keeper at Lorch and built the Hart, still the most stately Inn at Lorch, Into this official and financial rating, Christian, his youngest grandson was born. Christian's mother was Barbara, the daughter of Jacob Molt the schoolmaster. Who were the friends of the Justin Metzgers? Simple things reveal social standings. In vlirttemberg, in Lorch, the christening ceremonies register one's social connections perfectly. Whom do the father and mother dare invite with assurance to stand as god-parents of their offspring? In the \"Seel-Register\" of the fine old Protestant Church of Lorch carefully recorded by the Curate, Herr Jahn, are the nine christenings of Johann Justin's children with the names of four or even five persons who stood as sponsors for each. On two occasions stood the Very Reverend Johann Wendel Bullfinger, High Prelate of the Biosceae, much esteemed; six times stood Susanna Helena Jahn, sister of the Curate, a lifelong friend of the mother; Frau -Anna Barbara Miller, wife of the present Mayor appeared as sponsor four times; Jacob Weller, farmer from Bruckh, nine times. What a lasting friendship! Frau Katharina Margaretha Jahn, wife of the Curate, is named three times, and Herr Johann Friedrich SchBnleber, landlord of \"The Lamb\", came to stand as sponsor for four of these children. This is the background that Christian Metzger brought with him, as \\ he loses himself in the crowd of the young City, Philadelphia, and its suburb, Germantown, regarded the haven of German immigrants in 1752. Germantown This suburb, almost co-existent with the City of Brotherly Love, was located six miles beyond, on an old Indian trail along the interesting Wissahickon Creek. Here Francis Daniel Pastorius, as early as 1683, set- 54 tied his Colony of Religionists, some called Mennonites, some called Dun- kfirds later, some called English Quakers, but all in sentiment, one and the same. Pastorius, who received the L. L. D. degree from Nuremberg, na¬ turally became the leader of educated Germans and Swiss, and attracted highly skilled men in the hand-crafts. Things quickly took on permanent structure in this Colony. The weavers here set the pace for all colonies, and created the background for Germantown yarn, and for the famous carpet- looms of the present day. By 1708 the Mennonites had built their church, which stands today on Germantown -avenue, (the old winding Indian trail). The existing Quaker Meeting House, on this Avenue, was built in 1693 . The Dunkard's Church, at 6613 Germantown Avenue, dates from 1719. And t5ie German Lutheran Church to which Christian Metzger attached himself, the St. Michael, had been built in 1737. It is very probable that Christian, having been put in possession of his strong-box by the officers of the Pawley, left it in the care of a coffee-house, and then walked to Germantown over the six-mile highway already known as the \"King’s Road.\" /aid before evening of October 23rd, 1752 he would have registered at the \"Green Tree\" tavern kept by the son of Francis Daniel pastorius. As he walked along Germantown Avenue he could see many a substantial house, which is still standing today, and famous, now, historically. The houses were not log structures, but built of the rough native stone. The characteristic pattern had overhanging hipped roofs and a projecting pent over the doorstep. More pretentious houses were rectangular, two-storey, with deep cornices which were car¬ ried horizontally across the gable ends. The windows were broad and deep with many small panes. Huge chimneys, centrally placed, belched forth signs of comfort and cheer. ALready by 1728 here on Germantown Avenue, James Logan, Secretary to William Penn, had built \"Stenton.\" 55 . Christopher Saur was here with his house and printing office by 1724, and had started the first German newspaper by 1739, a dozen years before Chris¬ tian walked along the Avenue. As he passed Saur’s, he would come to \" In¬ dian Queen Tavern,\" near, and soon to the house 'which had been occupied by Zinzendorf and the \"first sea congregation\" before they set out for Bethlehem, 1742c Before he would reach the \"Green Tree Tavern\" he would pass \"Wyck, \" now the oldest house in Germantown, which was built in 1690, likewise the new stone residence erected in 1744 by John Hister, father of the charming belle, Sally. In such a young American Colony Christian began, and made a place for himself* Probably he worked with the weavers. Certainly, in a few years, he was ready to think of marriage, and it Is on his wedding-day that we next see him* * * * 56 1 Time: Place: . citing: Scene: Fourth Episode The Wedding Day November 18, 1755. Germantown, corner of Germantown Avenue end Phi] Ellena Street, St. Michael's Lutheran Church, A rectangular stone structure with a steeple in the Colonial style of the Atlantic Seaboard, called \"Georgian, Interior of church, congregation seated,1 at close of the sermon and ritu service. The organ in the gallery which surrounds three sides of the church, is playing softly. The pastor, the Rev, Johann Friedrich Handschuh, comes down from the pulpit, steps to the railing which separates the chancel from the pews, and says: \"After the three announcements of their banns, Herr Christian Ketz- ge^nd Fraulein anna Catharine Hausserin, both residing in Germantown anc both communicants of St, Michael's Church will, today, be joined in holy wedlock. Will the candidates for holy matrimony now come forward to the altar rail,\" Attention was paid to sex in 1755, But it was to separate and dis¬ tinguish the sexes, rather than to throw them together indiscriminately. As a consequence, in the Churches, quite generally the men occupied the pews on one side, and the women on the other side. In many churches there were tvrc portals or main entrances, one used by the men, exclusive ly, the other by the women. On this particular Sunday, her wedding-day, it is very probable that the bride entered by the women's door, 8r.d sat with her women friends during the tedious sermon and service, while the bridegroom entered and waited with the men. There is no mention in the ^P ews were installed in this church 1750. Also an organ, 57 i Archives of St. Michael's about the parents of the bride being present or participating in the ceremony. It is recorded in the \"Seelregis ter \" that Christian was born in Wurttembergchen, (beautiful little Wurttemberg^), and Anna C atharina in the rfals, (Alsace;. At the invitation of Pastor Handschuh, we may suppose that Christian had proceded toward the altar, waiting on a front seat with his friend, Heinrich Bamberger, and that he with his friend rose promptly to stand at the rail and v/ait for his bride's approach from the other side of the church. As readily may we suppose that the brice, Anna Catharina, was in the remotest part of the women's side, and that, preceded by her matron-friend, Frau Elizabetha Bamberger, blushingly, she advanced to the altar. When the ritual wedding ceremony of the Lutheran Church had been re¬ cited and each had repeated the vows of chastity, obedience, and devotion to the other, with the pastor's benediction and prayer, the newlyweds pro¬ bably left the altar to the mellow strains of Mendelsohn's wedding-march, and then, in the porch waited for the congratulations of the congregation as it passed out, also. Accustomed as was Christian to good living and naturally at home in an Inn, one may suppose that the wedding ceremony at the Church was fol¬ lowed by a wedding dinner and other merrymaking at the Green Tree Tavern. The First Christening Once more and the last tine, we see Christian Metzger and his wife V in St. Michael's German Lutheran Church. Pastor Eandschuh made this entry in the \"Seelregis ter ' s\" list of baptisms: \"Elizabetha, daughter of Christian Metzger and Anna Catharina Metzger, born July 22, 1756, was baptised on the 29th of August, 1756. Sponsors ______ __ . \" Wurttemberg, about shape and size of the State, Indiana. 58 were Heinrich Bamberger and Elizabetha Bamberger.\" Land Luring his years in Germantown it is plain that Christian worked every day, that he enjoyed his married life, and that he was saving some money, ho doubt he read Christopher Saur's German newspaper each week. But, just as likely, he learned to read the English weeklies of the Colony, he was making contacts, every week, with people crowding into Germantown, end going on from there, people from England, Holland, Germany, Switzer¬ land, and trance. He found the Germans moving from Germantown out in two directions. Some took the Lancaster Turnpike on to land beyond New Goshen- hoffen, on to the tributaries of the Lehigh river in Northampton County, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge. Which route Christian would take pro¬ bably depended on personal contacts, but he was coming to the time when he, too, would seek land. There dwelt in Germantown, a certain Martin Sh&ffer, of some mesns. In 1754 he had received from the Honorable Proprietors a Warrant for a large tract of land in Upper Milford Township, Northampton County. The King's Road continued to, and roughly on through this tract, on to Macungie Creek, in the Blue Ridge, and to a Lutheran Congregation started there by Lutheran settlers. Martin Sh&ffer sold quite a large section of this Warrant to Peter Hiittel, a communicant of St. Michael's Church, and Chris¬ tian knew Pe+'-er Hiittel personally. Peter Hiittel moved to his tract of land and began to develop it. He started a store, and a post-office, on the Ring's Road, entertained travel¬ ers at his house and lodged them overnight. He wanted Lutheran settlers for his land and tiny village. The Mennonites were there, having come as early as 1730. They had organized a Congregation there by 1740, and now 59 . had a Church a half mile from Klittel's store0 he wrote to his promising young acquaintance, Christian Metzger, and offered to sell him some of his land, he invited him to come up and look it over for himself. All the histories of the County show that whristian did thisa They show that he was there in heter fiiittel's community in 1757 and with some twenty-five other men organized a Lutheran congregation, ana built a sub¬ stantial church, -- though a log building -- which lasted them until 1819 when it was rebuilt in stone. This building was erected on a plat of fifty acres, given to the Congregation by Peter Kuttel. ihe Church stood on the left of the King's Road on a fine eminence, and was named \"Zion's\" while the village now became known as \"Zionsville . \" To move from. Germantown to Peter Mattel's community, Christian pro¬ bably bought him a horse and wagon, for the distance was fifty miles, and a journey of several days, he probably resided in the tiny village at first, and worked at weaving, until he could select a pleasing tract of the land and build him a house for his wife and baby daughter. The Church Record for the new Zion's German Lutheran Church was begun that year, 1757, and is intact to the present day. One of the first baptisms recorded in the new Register is that of \"Anna Catharina, daughter of Christian and Anna Catharina Metzger.\" By March of 1757 Christian and Anna Catharina were settled on their land. ihis must have been altogether the most strenuous year of all, and they were now experiencing real pioneering. Their house, probably more or less of a temporary structure, was set in the forest which clothed the hills, and the banks of Indian Creek, a roaring stream, scenic, and historic of Indian legend and massacre. Christian's imagination had now run away completely with his horse sense. Here he had bought, and made the first payments to Peter Rdttel, 113 acres, lying either side of this Indian Creek, southwest from Zionsville more than two miles, on the hilly 60 read to Powder Valley. Why did the Germans prefer the hill country to the alluvial valleys? The explanation given by Dr. Preston A. Laury in his History of this Region is the most convincing. He says, \"They (the Ger¬ mans) seemed to prefer the gravelly surface of the hillsides to the rich soil of the valley, because it was similar to the soil of the district they had come from in the homeland. \" Certainly Christian’s 113 acres were similar to the hillsides of Lorch, in Wurttemberg, with the Rems rumbling through. But there was another reason, more deeply seated in Christian’s mind. It was the splendid water-power in the roaring Indian Creek. Christian was mill-wright by training. Had he not been born by the nill on the Lake at Lorch? Played there as a boy, worked there as a man? He dreamed of building a mill on Indian Creek, of operating it as a source of wealth, end giving play to his actual training and his imagination. Added to the excitement of getting settled on his land in 1759 was the birth of another child, the birth of a son, on the 4th of March, 1759. * ♦ * 61 Time: Place : Setting : Scene : u . :i ■i 4 Fifth Episode The Son is Christened j 31 ! : August 23, 1759.

The Church and Churchyard of Zion's German Lutheran Church, situated on a commanding site to the left of the King's Highway. The Church buildiir is a well-built structure of logs hewed square, well pugged. It is about thirty by seventy feet including the apse which is formed by con¬ structing one end like the half of a hexagonal log-school-house customer;, in the Province; a hipped roof over the apse joins .with the pitched clap¬ board roof above the main building. Two doors give entrance, one at the side, the other at the end opposite the apse. Each door is protected by a small porch over the door-step. The six windows . are of small panes, and have strong plank shutters, which are now open. The interior has a sanded earthen floor and plastered walls. In the center is a huge stone fire-place with open hearth facing two ways and a stone chimney to the roof. The pews are plain benches with backs made of dressed lumber. In the apse on a raised platform, stands the altar end communion service, against the wall. Before the pulpit, at the right, stands a new carved-stone baptismal font. Pastor J. L. BchRfer -- in the pulpit. The congregation remains seated, after the sermon. Pastor Sch&fer steps down from the pulpit and takes his stand by th? new baptismal font. He says: 62 \"The congregation is honored, today, by the gift of this fine new baptismal font, presented by brother Christian Metzger, who drove to Ger¬ mantown this week and fetched it here. It is our joyful privilege to dedicate it, today, by the baptism of his first son, born to him and his wife, Anna Catharina, on March 4, 1759, Will the parents and sponsors step forward,\" Chri&tian and Anna Catharina come forward, Anna Catharina has on a new gray delaine dress with blue sprigs in it, and a neat brown straw bonnet, Christian is in his good black clothes and frock coat; he carries the infant, which looks back pertly from his shoulder.

Amen.\" He returns the infant to its father as it breaks out in a loud wail, * * * 63 Sixth Episode The Revolutionary War Time: November 18, 1776. Evening. Place: Zionsville, Upper Milford Township, Northampton County. Setting: The home of Christian Metzger near Indian Creek. Exterior: a good sized two-storey log structure. There is a full length lean-to on one side. A neat fence of cedar palings surrounds the enseir.bl Tall spruces, snow-laden, make a background, in the moonlight. Scene: Inside; a large kitchen. There is an open fireplace with cooking uten¬ sils on the hearth and on the shelf above. Candle light and firelight reveal the family at supper, seated at a long table. In a high slat-back chair, at the head, sits Christian. At the opposite end is Anna Catha- rina. All the children are present, seated on long benches on either side. At her mother's left, sits Elizabetha, the eldest, a grown woman now, with masses of brown hair, hazel eyes, rosy cheeks, attractive in a snug-fitted dress of blue homespun. Opposite her, at the mother's right sits Elizabetha's young husband, Philip Witman. Beside Philip sits Catharina, also grown to womanhood, but thin and delicate. Anna Maria and Anna Margaretha occupy seats on the same side, while opposite them sits Anna Christina, the youngest daughter, seven, next her fond father. The stripling son, Friedrich, next. Anna Eva, the tomboy and romp, oc¬ cupies the space between Friedrich and Elizabetha. There has been a delicious supper, for this is the wedding anniver¬ sary of Christian and Anna Catharina, their twenty-first anniversary. There has been roast wild turkey, a plum pudding with brandy sauce and many sorts of small cakes. The supper has been eaten. Christian has 64 lighted his pipe. Philip Witman then has also lighted his pipe. Address¬ ing his father, Friedrich makes bold to ask: \"May I have the horse and sled tonight? I want to go over to the school-house, with Philip.\" \"What's going on?\" counters his father 0 \"Captain Kechlein of the Easton militia is going to be there. He hopes to organize a Company from Upper Milford. The Macungie boys are coming and some men from Heidelberg, too. Colonel Henry Geiger lives up there, you know,\" explained the anxious Friedrich, and looked over at Philip for expected support. But before Philip could speak Christian exploded in protest: \"Fritz, I forbid you to goi You are too young! That meeting is no place for boys. Let the able-bodied men do the fighting!!\" and he pounded the table with his fist. Friedrich’s mother bowed her head and hid her face in her folded arms resting on the table. Little Christina climbed up and put her arm around Friedrich’s neck. All waited, silent. Then Philip Witman spoke to his father-in-law, quietly, looking at his wife, first, with an under¬ standing glance. \"Father, the country is in woeful need of men to support the cause of liberty. The British have brought the war right into Pennsylvania. Across the Delaware they are practically in control of Jersey. They plan to occupy Philadelphia. Will we men of Penn's Colony sit still 'and let them put a halter on our necks and swing us to a tree? or shackle us hand and foot? Elizabetha and I have talked it over, and I am going to enroll tonight.\" \"But Fritz is only seventeen! He is not grown yet', \"blustered Christian. 65 The mother was audibly sobbing. Little Christina asked: \"Fritz, if you go away to war who will take us girls to school?\" and she kissed her big brother. Then Friedrich put in this appeal: \"Father, think'. Captain Christian Fisher, last year, could report only 64 men, rank and file from Upper Milford, all of the white inhabi¬ tants between the Ages of 18 and 53, Only 64 menl Would you want me to be a slinking skunk, hiding behind a few months of age? 1 am able to use a rifle; able to train in the ranks; I can play the drum. They want me to be a drummer!\" All laughed. Plainly Christian was giving in a little, \"Well, I suppose you will go to the meeting; but it is not with my consent,\" The supper party broke up. Each one tried to find something to do in order to break the tension. The mother brought a new pair of mittens to her son, budding into a man, Philip Witman kissed his pretty wife goodbye, and the boys were off. But before leaving, Friedrich had sorted / out a newspaper from a stack of them on a stand near a window. This he thrust into the hands of his father, pouting, sitting in a corner of the settle before the fire. It is a July issue of the Philadelphia \"Staats- bote,\" and Friedrich pointed to a report of the Declaration of Independence and the speech of Patrick Henry -- young and fiery Patrick Henry -- now a hero in the eyes of any seventeen-year-old0 The peroration of Henry was set in capitals: DIE FREIHEIT LASZ MIR, ODER LRSZ MIR DEH TOD! Christian sat and stared at the paper as if reading. The daughters, in a mechanical way, cleared away the festal supper and stirred the buck¬ wheat batter against breakfast. The mother at her spinning-wheel now and then wiped a tear. As all sat to spend a lafet hour around the fire, the click of knitting needles, alone, broke the silence. 66 . Anna Eva cuddled up to her father still in the corner of the settle staring at the \"Staatsbote. \" Soon she slipped down and ran to her mother, in a 6tage whisper declaring, \"Verkert, mamal Vater liest verkert!\"^ Plainly Christian was outdone, and undone, trying to think things through. When the daughters had retired, his wife broke the spell by saying: \"Christian, we must dress a sheep tomorrow morning.\" \"Why must we kill a sheep?\" \"For the wool, father; we women, the girls and I, must spin and weave a new suit for Friedrichl Before he leaves for camp.\" Then Christian stormed, \"Friedrichl! Yal Friedrich, who is our un- doingl He has forsaken his parents. I counted on my only son as a part¬ ner in my plantation, in the grand oil mill which I am building. You know the oil mill promises to be the best in the Countyl The plantation and the mill are two men's jobs. I counted on him! I can't do it alone.

Evening. ilfice: The Stone Oilmill on Indian Creek, Upper Milford Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania. •••.ting: Indian Creek breaks through the wall of a charmingly wooded bluff and falls into a glassy mill-pond held by a stone dam. The top of the dam is guarded by an ornamental wooden fence and there is a path by it on the top of the dam, which leads to a main traveled highway. Against the back¬ ground of the bluff, rises a four-storey stone mill, rectangular 30' x 60*. On the long side, facing the highway, the wall is broken by tiers of six windows, set symmetrically, containing 24 panes each, except the ground floor which is also fitted with two exits. The north end of the mill faces the dam and mill pond. There is a central door on the two lower floors of this end with windows symmetrically arranged, each side and above. This end of the building rests over the stone walled mill-race; for the huge over-shot water-wheel is placed inside the mill, and is of iron, cast in one of the numerous foundries of Berks County, near. The mill-race opens into Indian Creek, again, through a beautiful stone arch in the basement wall — a perfect .Roman arch. The pent-up waters foaming through this arch tumble wild and free along down the picturesque stream. On the long side, east, there extends an ell, one storey, and level with the second floor of the mill. This ell seems to nestle in the ever¬ green forest clothing the bluff. It is the living-room of the residential quarters, and overlooks the falls and the mill-pond. To the south are two wooden galleries, on the second and third floors. These galleries ex¬ tend along the kitchen and the chambers above it. Scene : Inside the living room, the huge stone fireplace blazes with a fresh supply of wood. It is late, for Christian is awaited, returning from a day in Court at Easton. At last, steps are heard, end Christian stalks 69 .

Anna Catharina brings him a cup of hot coffee. She waits, patiently, for his report on ; the day's legal proceedings. With subdued bitterness, he tells her the worst. \"John Stahl^ was present to appear against me. He had with him Peter Aston, the merchant and real estate shark of Philadelphia. John Stahl declared that he was obliged to close the mortgage on the mill, that he would take the mill and nothing less, to cover the mortgage, saying he would then lose money. 1 was helpless. 1 could find no one to finance me, who was willing to give me a safe chance to work from under the bond. John Stahl, however, said he wanted me to continue to operate the mill. The judge ruled in his favor. We no longer own this fine mill. It has gone into the hands of strangers. For, hear the trickery of our neighbor: No sooner was the court-order issued than John Stahl introduced j Peter Aston, and said that he had in his pocket the deed ready, prepared, by which indenture he turned this property over to Aston. I did not see * I the deed, end do not know for what consideration. But I am convinced that Peter Aston connived with John Stahl to get possession of this mill with its excellent water-power. ihen reter Aston offered to hire me to operate the mill. As I love the mill which 1 have created, I took this chance to stay with it. We will still live here, while I operate the mill. When I am no longer able, we will move to the old house where our children were born, and where we still own 13 acres of our original 113 acres. Even if old, it is a roof for our last years.” 7 John Stahl, founder of the well-known Stahl Potteries located a quarter-mile from the stone mill in Powder Valley, on Indian Creek. 70 i Eighth Episode Last Will And Testament lir.e: July 18, 1803.
