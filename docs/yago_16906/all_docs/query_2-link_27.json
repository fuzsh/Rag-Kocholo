        "text": "Results\n\nIntravenous infusion of LEAP2 results in supraphysiological steady-state plasma concentrations in lean men\n\nTo investigate the metabolic effects of LEAP2 in humans, we carried out an intravenous infusion of LEAP2 (∼25 pmol/kg/min), resulting in supraphysiological plasma concentrations in 20 lean, young men (see for baseline characteristics and for an overview of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study design). Using an in-house radioimmunoassay directed against the N-terminal part of LEAP2, we determined LEAP2 plasma concentrations during LEAP2 and placebo infusions. During LEAP2 and placebo infusions, the baseline concentrations of LEAP2 plasma concentrations were similar ( A). During LEAP2 infusion, plasma concentrations of LEAP2 reached steady state after 45 min of infusion with a mean concentration of 41.2 ± 1.1 ng/mL ( A), ∼2.6-fold higher than the mean plasma LEAP2 concentration during placebo infusion ( A). During placebo infusion, no change in LEAP2 concentration was found in response to the liquid mixed meal ( A), suggesting that endogenous LEAP2 concentrations are not acutely affected by food intake in lean, young men. The participants reported no adverse events during the infusions.\n\nTable 1\n\nMale/female (n/n)20/0Age (years)23 (20–25)Weight (kg)80.3 (74.9–88.2)Height (m)1.87 (1.81–1.92)BMI (kg/m2)23.1 (22.3–25.0)Fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L)5.2 (5.0–5.3)HbA1c (mmol/mol)32 (29–33)\n\nExogenous LEAP2 alters the postprandial plasma glucose response\n\nFirst, we assessed the effect of exogenous LEAP2 on postprandial glucose metabolism in healthy men. For this purpose, participants were given a standardized liquid mixed meal (65 min after infusion start). During LEAP2 infusion, the postprandial plasma glucose peaks were lower than during placebo infusion ( B; ). Furthermore, the area under the curve (AUC) for the entire infusion period (AUC0–255 min) and the postprandial AUC (AUC60–255 min) were lower during LEAP2 infusion compared with placebo ( ), demonstrating a reduced postprandial glucose response during LEAP2 infusion.\n\nTable 2\n\nLEAP2Placebo (saline)p value (paired t test)Glucose Baseline (mmol/L)5.02 ± 0.065.01 ± 0.070.900 Peak (mmol/L)6.21 ± 0.126.58 ± 0.130.005 Time to peak (min)140 ± 12.7137 ± 10.70.808 Postprandial baseline (mmol/L)4.96 ± 0.055.10 ± 0.080.077 Postprandial end (mmol/L)4.48 ± 0.114.75 ± 0.120.056 AUC (mmol/L × min)1,288 ± 13.41,336 ± 18.50.013 –60 min (mmol/L × min)295 ± 3.02300 ± 3.670.198 AUC60–255 min (mmol/L × min)992 ± 12.41,037 ± 16.90.017Insulin Baseline (pmol/L)36.4 ± 1.7036.3 ± 2.080.984 Peak (pmol/L)347 ± 38.6356 ± 35.40.734 Time to peak (min)110 ± 6.28120 ± 9.230.433 Postprandial baseline (pmol/L)38.6 ± 2.0931.1 ± 2.080.017 AUC (nmol/L × min)33.8 ± 2.6333.3 ± 2.340.775 AUC0–60 min (nmol/L × min)2.39 ± 0.091.92 ± 0.13<0.001 AUC60–255 min (nmol/L × min)31.5 ± 2.6031.4 ± 2.280.985C-peptide Baseline (pmol/L)360 ± 21.4350 ± 15.80.673 Peak (pmol/L)1,524 ± 1061,647 ± 1250.317 Time to peak (min)136 ± 9.01160 ± 11.20.028 Postprandial baseline (pmol/L)365 ± 20.2313 ± 15.90.010 AUC (nmol/L × min)218 ± 11.7222 ± 11.50.697 AUC0–60 min (nmol/L × min)22.5 ± 1.1819.7 ± 1.000.018 AUC60–255 min (nmol/L × min)196 ± 11.2202 ± 10.90.490C-peptide/glucose ratio Baseline (pmol/mmol)71.4 ± 3.9369.8 ± 2.820.675 Peak (pmol/mmol)269 ± 17.9268 ± 17.60.959 Time to peak (min)140 ± 9.24153 ± 10.30.179 Postprandial baseline (pmol/mmol)73.6 ± 4.0361.4 ± 3.030.002 AUC (nmol/mmol × min)41.4 ± 2.3440.8 ± 1.890.705 AUC0–60 min (nmol/mmol × min)4.57 ± 0.233.92 ± 0.180.003 AUC60–255 min (nmol/mmol × min)36.8 ± 2.2336.8 ± 1.781.000Glucagon Baseline (pmol/L)6.57 ± 0.767.23 ± 0.680.237 Peak (pmol/L)13.0 ± 0.9411.2 ± 0.720.003 Time to peak (min)116 ± 12.5117 ± 17.10.926 Postprandial baseline (pmol/L)7.35 ± 0.825.35 ± 0.670.005 AUC (nmol/L × min)2.26 ± 0.201.74 ± 0.14<0.001 AUC0–60 min (nmol/L × min)0.446 ± 0.0440.375 ± 0.0350.038 AUC60–255 min (nmol/L × min)1.82 ± 0.171.36 ± 0.13<0.001Free fatty acids Baseline (μmol/L)339 ± 18.4361 ± 20.90.419 Nadir (μmol/L)58.4 ± 3.9457.7 ± 3.700.860 Time to nadir (min)155 ± 7.63168 ± 11.10.317 Postprandial baseline (μmol/L)272 ± 16.4360 ± 28.00.013 AUC (mmol/L × min)43.2 ± 2.4948.1 ± 2.740.171 AUC0–60 min (mmol/L × min)18.9 ± 1.1820.9 ± 1.430.258 AUC60–255 min (mmol/L × min)24.4 ± 1.5127.2 ± 1.540.150Glycerol Baseline (μmol/L)26.6 ± 2.4528.4 ± 3.120.379 Nadir (μmol/L)11.7 ± 2.1212.1 ± 2.440.761 Time to nadir (min)144 ± 10.2164 ± 11.80.201 Postprandial baseline (μmol/L)22.9 ± 2.1231.4 ± 3.650.007 AUC (mmol/L × min)4.87 ± 0.575.49 ± 0.700.080 AUC0–60 min (mmol/L × min)1.65 ± 0.151.95 ± 0.190.039 AUC60–255 min (mmol/L × min)3.22 ± 0.443.54 ± 0.540.211Triglycerides Baseline (μmol/L)920 ± 62.2953 ± 70.40.539 Peak (μmol/L)1,275 ± 84.81,353 ± 1130.279 Time to peak (min)195 ± 5.33192 ± 6.850.725 Postprandial baseline (μmol/L)847 ± 48.3916 ± 73.20.159 AUC (mmol/L × min)263 ± 16.7279 ± 22.10.251 AUC0–60 min (mmol/L × min)53.5 ± 3.1456.8 ± 4.410.284 AUC60–255 min (mmol/L × min)210 ± 13.8222 ± 17.90.258Growth hormone Baseline (ng/mL)0.594 ± 0.3000.299 ± 0.1060.372 Nadir (ng/mL)0.042 ± 0.0040.084 ± 0.0120.001 Time to nadir (min)116 ± 17.2128 ± 13.90.592 Postprandial baseline (ng/mL)0.121 ± 0.0480.432 ± 0.1330.014 AUC (ng/mL × min)33.8 ± 11.8106 ± 18.30.001 AUC0–60 min (ng/mL × min)20.2 ± 9.7632.0 ± 9.570.312 AUC60–255 min (ng/mL × min)13.6 ± 2.3273.7 ± 14.5<0.001Acyl ghrelin Baseline (ng/mL)0.155 ± 0.0110.158 ± 0.0100.730 Nadir (ng/mL)0.088 ± 0.0060.084 ± 0.0040.343 Postprandial baseline (ng/mL)0.161 ± 0.0120.172 ± 0.0130.264 AUC (ng/mL × min)31.2 ± 1.9431.7 ± 1.960.634 AUC0–60 min (ng/mL × min)9.50 ± 0.679.90 ± 0.650.387 AUC60–255 min (ng/mL × min)21.7 ± 1.3321.8 ± 1.340.875Acetaminophen Peak (μmol/L)65.1 ± 2.5266.3 ± 2.750.548 Time to peak (min)209 ± 6.34215 ± 7.930.297\n\nInsulinotropic and anti-lipolytic effects of exogenous LEAP2 during fasting\n\nWe measured plasma concentrations of insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, and calculated C-peptide/glucose ratio—the latter as a measure of pancreatic beta cell secretion—before and after the liquid mixed meal test (i.e., during fasting and postprandial conditions) in the healthy, young men. In the fasting state, the circulating concentrations of insulin and C-peptide and C-peptide/glucose ratio were higher during LEAP2 infusion compared with placebo, as assessed by AUC0–60 min ( C–2E; ). Accordingly, postprandial baseline values (i.e., at the end of the fasting period, time = 60 min) were higher for both insulin, C-peptide, and C-peptide/glucose ratio ( C–2E; ). The insulinotropic effect of LEAP2 during fasting was supported by a shorter time to peak for C-peptide during LEAP2 infusion ( ). An increase of ∼2 pmol/L in glucagon concentrations was observed both in the fasting state and postprandially during LEAP2 infusion ( F; ). Plasma concentrations of free fatty acids, glycerol, and triglycerides were measured during fasting and postprandial conditions ( G–2I; ). In the fasting state, circulating glycerol (AUC0–60 min) concentrations were lower during LEAP2 infusion compared with placebo infusion ( H; ), suggesting a decreased lipolytic activity. No differences in AUC0–60 min values were found for free fatty acids or triglycerides, but postprandial baseline concentrations (time = 60 min) of free fatty acids and glycerol were lower during LEAP2 infusion ( ).\n\nExogenous LEAP2 does not alter gastric emptying\n\nBecause ghrelin is known to increase the gastric emptying rate,19 we admixed acetaminophen to the liquid mixed meal in order to evaluate postprandial plasma excursions of acetaminophen as an indirect marker of gastric emptying, as previously validated.20 Peak plasma acetaminophen concentrations and time to peak plasma acetaminophen concentrations revealed no difference between LEAP2 and placebo infusions ( J; ), suggesting that exogenous LEAP2 does not alter gastric emptying rate of a liquid mixed meal.\n\nExogenous LEAP2 decreases plasma concentrations of GH, but not ghrelin\n\nGH release reflects activity of the GHSR and is stimulated by acute administration of ghrelin.21 To test whether exogenous LEAP2 reduces the production or secretion of GH and ghrelin, we measured plasma concentrations of both hormones ( K and 2L; ). Notably, GH concentrations were suppressed during LEAP2 infusion compared with placebo, as assessed by AUC ( ). When assessing the fasting (AUC0–60 min) and postprandial (AUC60–255 min) periods separately, only the postprandial period was lower during LEAP2 infusion compared with placebo ( ), suggesting that LEAP2 mainly suppresses GH postprandially. The postprandial GH suppression was supported by a lower nadir during LEAP2 infusion compared with placebo infusion ( ). Plasma concentrations of ghrelin (measured as active acylated ghrelin) were unaffected by LEAP2 infusion ( ); hence, the metabolic effects of exogenous LEAP2 in healthy men do not seem to be a result of altered plasma concentrations of ghrelin. Together, these results support previous findings on suppression of ghrelin-induced GH release in a dose-dependent manner in rodents5,14 and suggest that LEAP2 may reduce GH release independently of plasma concentrations of ghrelin in humans.\n\nNo effect of LEAP2 on sensations of hunger, satiety, prospective food consumption, fullness, nausea, comfort, and thirst\n\nAs ghrelin infusion in humans has been reported to increase appetite sensations,13 we investigated the effect of LEAP2 on several appetite-related sensations using visual analog scale (VAS) ratings. We found no differences in VAS ratings of hunger, satiety, prospective food consumption, fullness, nausea, comfort, or thirst from experimental days with LEAP2 and placebo infusions ( A–3G). Moreover, we found no differences between LEAP2 and placebo infusions when comparing the VAS ratings given just before (time = 255 min) as well as just after (time ∼272 min) the ad libitum meal. Thus, changes in VAS ratings of hunger, prospective food consumption, or nausea could not explain the reduced food intake observed during LEAP2 infusion. Importantly, VAS ratings indicated a low level of nausea and a high level of comfort throughout both study days ( E and 3F).\n\nExogenous LEAP2 does not affect resting energy expenditure, utilization of metabolic substrates, or brown adipose tissue thermogenesis\n\nSince ghrelin has been proposed as a regulator of systemic energy expenditure,1 we investigated the effect of exogenous LEAP2 on resting energy expenditure, respiratory quotient, and protein turnover in healthy individuals assessed by indirect calorimetry and renal urea excretion, respectively. Using this approach, we found no differences in resting energy expenditure or respiratory quotient between LEAP2 and placebo infusions ( H; respiratory quotient data not shown). Moreover, we found no difference in renal urea excretion at the two consecutive time points or total urea excretion between study days (data not shown). As ghrelin has been suggested to suppress brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity in rodents,1 we also investigated BAT thermogenesis using a thermal imaging camera measuring temperatures of the skin above the two supraclavicular BAT depots and over the manubrium of the sternum; the latter as a control reflecting overall cutaneous circulation. We found no differences in BAT thermogenesis between LEAP2 and placebo infusions calculated as the average of the supraclavicular skin temperatures subtracting the manubrium skin temperature ( I), indicating that LEAP2 does not affect BAT thermogenesis in humans.\n\nExogenous LEAP2 reduces food intake during an ad libitum meal\n\nNext, food intake was assessed by an ad libitum meal test at the end of the infusion period. Here, we found an ∼12% reduction in energy intake in the healthy, young men during LEAP2 infusion compared with placebo demonstrated by reduced total caloric intake and caloric intake per kg body weight ( A and 4B). In addition to reduced food intake, a shorter meal duration during LEAP2 infusion was also observed ( C).\n\nGHSR-dependent effect of LEAP2 dosing on plasma glucose and food intake in mice\n\nWe evaluated the effects of a single subcutaneous dose of LEAP2 on glucose metabolism and food intake in GHSR-null mice and wild-type littermates to tease out GHSR-dependent effects. In line with the observed effects in humans, LEAP2 dosing significantly diminished increases in plasma glucose during ad libitum food intake 1 h after dosing in wild-type mice as compared with vehicle ( A). In contrast, a similar dose of LEAP2 did not affect plasma glucose in GHSR-null mice ( A), indicating that the glucose-lowering effect of LEAP2 in the postprandial state may be mediated through the GHSR. Of note, the glucose-lowering effect of LEAP2 was only observed after 1 h and not at the later time points ( A). In line with the human results, LEAP2 dosing lowered the cumulative food intake in wild-type mice 2 and 4 h after dosing ( B), but no effect of LEAP2 was found in GHSR-null mice ( B). Together, these results suggest that the GHSR is a prerequisite for the observed metabolic effects of LEAP2 in mice and provide in vivo insights into LEAP2 as a GHSR ligand with opposing actions to the orexigenic hormone ghrelin. In a separate cohort of fasted female wild-type mice, we observed no effect of exogenous LEAP2 on fasting insulin concentrations following LEAP2 dosing ( C), contrasting our human data. As in humans, LEAP2 did not affect fasting plasma glucose concentrations in wild-type mice either ( D).\n\nPharmacokinetic parameters of exogenous LEAP2 in healthy men\n\nIn order to describe the kinetics of exogenous LEAP2, 8 of the 20 study participants were subjected to a separate intravenous infusion of LEAP2 reaching supraphysiological steady-state plasma concentrations followed by a 150-min wash-out period (Figure S1A). Based on a pharmacokinetic model taking baseline plasma concentrations of LEAP2 into account,22 we estimated the volume of distribution of LEAP2 to 14 ± 5.3 L, metabolic clearance rate of LEAP2 to 0.86 ± 0.17 L/min, half-life of LEAP2 to 9.1 ± 2.5 min, and endogenous production rate of LEAP2 to 1.9 ± 0.14 nmol/min. Taken together, these findings indicate that LEAP2 is rapidly cleared from the circulation. This finding is in agreement with previous findings in mice subjected to a single intravenous dose of LEAP2.5\n\nDiscussion\n\nLEAP2 was recently discovered as an endogenous circulating hormone in rodents with antagonistic effects on ghrelin actions and inverse effects on GHSR constitutive activity.5,6 Here, we demonstrate that exogenous LEAP2 reduces postprandial glucose excursions and suppresses food intake in healthy men. In addition, we report a lower glucose peak and food intake in wild-type mice, but not in GHSR-null mice, after LEAP2 administration, suggesting that the plasma glucose- and appetite-lowering effects of LEAP2 are mediated by the ghrelin receptor, GHSR, in mice. The observed effects on both glucose homeostasis and appetite regulation may revitalize the GHSR as therapeutic target in metabolic diseases in the future.\n\nA pioneering study characterizing the pharmacological effects of LEAP2 in rodents5 demonstrated a lower food intake in mice treated with LEAP2 compared with vehicle-treated mice. Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, we now demonstrate that exogenous LEAP2 reduces food intake during an ad libitum meal test (of pasta Bolognese) in healthy men. On average, participants consumed 432 kJ less during LEAP2 infusion compared with placebo (corresponding to an ∼12% reduction) and spent less time eating before feeling comfortably full. For comparison, 432 kJ corresponds approximately to the energy content in a 25 cL soft drink. Importantly, this anorectic effect was observed without a concomitant increase in nausea. A sustained reduction of 432 kJ per meal for longer periods would translate into robust weight loss, but it remains to be determined whether the effect is reproducible in overweight individuals and whether it is sustained with prolonged dosing of LEAP2 and whether the response can be optimized by altering the LEAP2 dosage. For perspective, acute GLP-1 infusion (inducing an ∼8-fold increase in plasma concentration of GLP-1) in healthy, normal-weight, young men resulted in a similar reduction in energy intake of ∼12% during a comparable ad libitum meal test.23\n\nInterestingly, the appetite-suppressing effect of LEAP2 was reproduced in wild-type mice, but not in GHSR-null mice, showing that the GHSR is required for the reduced food intake observed in LEAP2-treated mice. Our data confirm the finding by Ge et al.5 demonstrating a lower food intake in LEAP2-treated compared with vehicle-treated mice, in contrast to a number of other studies.6,7,14 The inconsistent finding on LEAP2-induced modulation of food intake may be related to the level of stress in the studied animals, as stress hormones strongly induce ghrelin secretion. In our study designed to measure plasma glucose, we expect high level of stress and accordingly high plasma ghrelin concentrations. However, the fact that LEAP2 administration consistently has been shown to reverse ghrelin-induced food intake5,6,14,16 makes it conceivable that LEAP2 mainly acts as a competitive antagonist impairing ghrelin-induced activation of GHSR in rodents. This is further supported by a recent study indicating that LEAP2 deletion in mice enhances the actions of ghrelin.15 Of note, it remains to be explored whether exogenous LEAP2 reduces food intake in animal models of impaired metabolic control, such as diet-induced obesity.\n\nThe insulinotropic properties of the LEAP2 family of peptide hormones in vitro6,7 prompted us to investigate the effect of exogenous LEAP2 on postprandial glucose metabolism in healthy humans. Here, we report reduced postprandial glucose excursions following a standardized liquid mixed meal during LEAP2 infusion. Plasma profiles of insulin and C-peptide revealed an insulinotropic effect of LEAP2 during fasting, but not postprandially. A concomitant increase in the C-peptide/glucose ratio during fasting indicates that LEAP2 may increase the β cell sensitivity to glucose in the fasted state without enhancing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion after meal ingestion, which is in agreement with our recent findings for the endogenous LEAP2 fragment, LEAP238–47.7 The mechanisms underlying the reduced postprandial plasma glucose excursions observed in the present study remain uncertain, but we speculate that LEAP2 may act through brain-mediated regulation of hepatic glucose production, as seen with insulin,24 or increase peripheral insulin sensitivity, the latter possibly as an indirect effect to decreased plasma concentrations of GH.25 Moreover, we cannot rule out that the increased insulin concentrations observed during LEAP2 infusion in the fasting state may prime insulin-sensitive tissues before meal ingestion. Gastric emptying was not altered by exogenous LEAP2, as previously reported for ghrelin,19 suggesting that the lower postprandial plasma glucose peak observed during LEAP2 infusion is not a result of delayed gastric emptying of the meal.\n\nWe observed a small increment in plasma glucagon concentrations during LEAP2 infusion. The increase in plasma glucagon concentration may counteract the glucose-lowering effect of exogenous LEAP2. The GHSR has been localized to both α and β cells as well as somatostatin-producing δ cells and pancreatic polypeptide cells in the human and mouse pancreas.17,26, 27, 28 It may be of interest, therefore, to investigate whether a GHSR-dependent glucoregulatory effect of LEAP2 is affected by the intra-islet communication that is thought to exist between the different GHSR-expressing pancreatic cell types.26,29\n\nThe LEAP2-induced reduction of postprandial plasma glucose excursions was reproducible in wild-type mice, but not in GHSR-null mice, when measuring plasma glucose 1 h after dosing. This suggests that the glucose-lowering effect of LEAP2 in mice is dependent on the GHSR. It should be noted that three studies have already investigated the effect of exogenous LEAP2 on glucose metabolism in rodents: (1) in a recent study in rats,14 it was demonstrated that centrally injected LEAP2 suppresses the hyperglycemic effect of centrally injected ghrelin; (2) a decrease in plasma glucose following intraperitoneally administered LEAP2 in mice was recently reported;17 and (3) in male NMRI mice, LEAP2 did not affect the blood glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test.7 Taken together, these results suggest that any glucose-lowering effect of LEAP2 might depend on several factors, including way of LEAP2 administration, nature of the glycemia, and the phenotype of the organism investigated.\n\nDuring fasting, GH promotes lipid mobilization and oxidation as a means of fat utilization.25 Exogenous ghrelin has been reported to induce lipolysis in humans independently of GH,30 mirroring the physiological effect of endogenous ghrelin and GH during fasting.1 This prompted us to investigate the effect of exogenous LEAP2 on plasma concentrations of triglycerides, free fatty acids, and glycerol—the substrate and products, respectively, of lipolysis—in fasting and postprandial states. Compared with placebo, LEAP2 infusion decreased glycerol in the fasted state (AUC0–60 min) and plasma concentrations of both glycerol and free fatty acids were lower preprandially (at time point 60 min), suggesting inhibition of lipolysis during LEAP2 infusion. It remains to be established whether LEAP2 has any anti-lipolytic effect or whether lipolysis may be indirectly mediated via effects on insulin secretion and/or GH secretion.\n\nBecause ghrelin has been proposed to modulate systemic energy expenditure,1 we tested whether exogenous LEAP2 could have the opposite effect on resting energy expenditure, substrate utilization, and BAT thermogenesis. We observed no effect on resting energy expenditure or utilization of carbohydrates, fat, or protein—the latter assessed by respiratory quotient and renal urea excretion. Moreover, no effect on BAT thermogenesis was found. Limitations of these measurements should be considered. Indirect calorimetry depends on the participant’s ability to rest, and in 23 tests out of 160, the readings did not reach steady state, probably due to the other study procedures and therefore limited test time. Thermal imaging of skin temperatures depends on other factors than BAT thermogenesis, such as the surrounding temperature. To correct for the overall cutaneous heat production in the air-conditioned room, we assessed BAT thermogenesis by manubrium-corrected supraclavicular skin temperatures. Of note, this study was powered to detect differences in food intake, and thus, regarding the secondary endpoints, our study might be underpowered.\n\nWe measured plasma concentrations of GH as a sign of GHSR activation, since this is the most sensitive physiological response to GHSR activation.5 Plasma concentration of GH was lower during LEAP2 infusion compared with placebo, indicating reduced GHSR activity. Interestingly, plasma profiles of ghrelin did not differ between LEAP2 and placebo infusions, pointing to absence of feedback regulation of ghrelin secretion, known to occur for many other hormonal systems. Taken together, our data confirm previous in vitro findings that LEAP2 downregulates GHSR activity independently of ghrelin concentrations,4,6,7 thus suggesting that the metabolic effects of exogenous LEAP2 observed in humans are mediated—at least partly—through GHSR. Whether the decrease in plasma concentration of GH observed postprandially in this study is involved in the reduction of the postprandial glucose excursions remains to be explored. As previously speculated, exogenous LEAP2 does not seem to inhibit the production or secretion of ghrelin.5 The plasma profile of GH during placebo infusion followed a pattern similar to that of ghrelin, which is consistent with the known physiological regulation according to energy status,31 i.e., increased concentrations during fasting, decreased postprandial concentrations, and returning to fasting concentrations at the end of the postprandial period. The pulsatile pattern of GH secretion may explain the large variation observed in the dataset.32 Importantly, both GH and ghrelin plasma concentrations were within physiological ranges reported previously.31\n\nUntil now, the effects of LEAP2 exposure have not been investigated in humans. Importantly, no adverse reactions were observed during the infusions. LEAP2 infusion resulted in a 2.6-fold steady-state concentration as compared with placebo infusion, reaching supraphysiological concentrations as compared with previous plasma measurements in lean individuals.4 Plasma concentrations of LEAP2 during placebo infusion and baseline were within concentration ranges reported previously,4,7 suggesting that LEAP2 is an endogenous peptide measured in the nanomolar range. Moreover, our data confirm that endogenous LEAP2 assessed during placebo infusion was not affected by a liquid mixed meal test in lean individuals in agreement with previous findings in lean individuals.4 Whether endogenous LEAP2 concentrations change with food intake in overweight individuals is presently uncertain due to contrasting findings.4,7 Of notice, we cannot rule out that the observed effects of exogenous LEAP2 would have been more pronounced employing a higher infusion rate of LEAP2, and future studies will, therefore, be required to investigate a possible dose-response relationship. The pharmacokinetic model of exogenous LEAP2 shows a half-life of LEAP2 amounting to ∼9 min; thus, an extension of the half-life is necessary—for example, through lipidation—if LEAP2 should have a pharmacological potential in the future.\n\nLimitations of the study\n\nPlasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 1 were not measured. Also, the study was designed to investigate the effects of exogenous LEAP2 in healthy men and was not designed to answer mechanistic effects of exogenous LEAP2 in humans. Since only one dose of LEAP2 was used, the dose-response relationship remains to be investigated.\n\nIn conclusion, we demonstrate that exogenous LEAP2 resulting in supraphysiological plasma concentrations reduces postprandial glucose excursions and ad libitum food intake in young, healthy men. These effects were also observed in wild-type mice, but not in GHSR-null mice, suggesting that the glucose-lowering and appetite-suppressing effects of LEAP2—at least partly—depend on the GHSR in mice. Together, these findings raise the possibility that LEAP2 might constitute a clinically relevant pharmacological target for the treatment of obesity."
