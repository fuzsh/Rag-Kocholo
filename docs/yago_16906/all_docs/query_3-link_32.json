        "text": "“If any man be in Christ, He is a new creation; the old has passed away, behold, the new has come.”\n\nTime in abstraction, that is, time thought of in a way that is not thought from God’s triune time for the world in Jesus Christ, can only lead to a life of despair and futility. The 21st century’s busy-ness that most are preoccupied with often has the tendency to glaze over the futility of life, without Christ, which can often last someone a lifetime; that is until they are finally confronted with the reality of their mortality. Indeed, the reality of mortality is ultimately to face the Firstborn from the Dead, Jesus Christ. And to finally meet the ground of all reality, and the purpose of the created order in general, after a person has “expired,” is a fearful thing indeed. It is as if such a person has finally had to come to terms with the fact that they have trampled the blood of Christ underfoot, counting it a vain thing.\n\nBarth writes:\n\nAgain by way of anticipation, the presence of Jesus in His community is full of import for the future. His presence impels and presses to His future, general and definitive revelation, of which there has been a particular and provisional form in the Easter history. Hence even the presence of Jesus in the Spirit, for all its fulness, can only be a pledge or first instalment of what awaits the community as well as the whole universe, His return in glory. But it must never be forgotten that He who comes again in glory, this future Jesus, is identical with the One proclaimed by the history of yesterday and really present to His own to-day. The thorough-going eschatology for which the interim between now and one day necessarily seems to be a time of emptiness, of futility, of lack, of a progressive and barely concealed disillusionment, is not the eschatology of New Testament Christianity. And again it is only an unspiritual community which can tolerate such a view. The fact that the man Jesus will be includes the fact that He is; but the fact that He is does not exclude that He is “not yet.”[1]\n\nFor about a decade, starting in the mid-nineties, the Lord, as He began to do a heavy work in my life, allowed me to feel what life would be like without Him as the ground of it all. I can only describe that season of time as a literal hell. Indeed, clinically it might have been “diagnosed” as depression and general anxiety, but it went much deeper than that. Its basis was indeed spiritual. It was tied into a heavy intellectual (although not affective) doubt of God’s existence I was experiencing; even as a Christian. I felt the hell of nihilism whilst in the depths of deep depression and deep anxiety (indeed, these became mutually implicating things). I only made it through that because God is gracious.\n\nEven so, as Barth underscores, we are included in the time of Christ; the new time of God in recreation for us (pro nobis). We have the guarantee of the eschatological time to come even as He in-breaks, by the Holy Spirit, into our broken lives while we continue to inhabit this in-between time. But His parousia (presence) is just as real and weighty now as it will finally be when the consummate reality of the revealing of the sons of God ultimately enfolds us into its full participative esse (ground) as that has been, and always will be, mediated for us in the priestly humanity of our High Priest and Brother, Jesus Christ. Take heart, even though we might experience many and deep tribulations here, Christ has overcome the world!\n\n[1] Karl Barth, Church Dogmatics III/2 §47 [468] The Doctrine of Creation: Study Edition (London: T&T Clark, 2010), 32–3.\n\nGod is not an analogue to analyze. God instead is a triune and eternal relationship of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, one God (de Deo uno) in three persons (de Deo trino) to be inhabited, through Christ, and enjoyed. The Christian is in an immediate relationship with the triune God through union with Jesus Christ. We are indeed, as Christians, in an intimate and personal relationship with the living God. Not because we are persons in relationship with God—thus predicating what God’s relationality and personalist reality must be—but because God is eternally personal and [onto]relational within the inner-reality (in se) of His life. In other words, we have intimacy with God not because of some type of from below emotionalism we foist upon God, but because of who He is as personal and relational within His inner being.\n\nIt seems to me that there are some, especially those of the intellectualist orientation (often academics), who want to poo-poo the idea that Christians ought to be in this warm-hearted love relationship with God. They want to think, seemingly, that because of an identifiable movement within Protestantism, particularly as that is found in the work of Phillip Jakob Spener and Nikolaus Ludwig, count von Zinzendorf, in 17th and 18th century Germany, and then later in England, through the Keswick spiritual tradition, and also in America, within the revivalist movements, and many more threads, that such intimacy talk and religion vis-à-vis God can be dismissed and relegated to an index and categorization of church history (and sociology). Indeed, while many movements within the history of the church can be described by the intellectual and theological historians, this in and of itself doesn’t negate the theological substance that may or may not stand behind these types of shifts and orientations among the people of God through the centuries.\n\nI am simply wanting to register that at a purely theological level the idea that the Christian is growing in the grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ entails a deeply personal and warm-hearted relationship with God, indeed, a dialogical (prayerful and worshipful) one, wherein the sheep can know the Shepherd’s voice. And this, as already noted, is not because of anything inherent to an ‘below’ urge from us to God. But instead, it is from an ‘above’ movement of who God freely has chosen to be for us in Jesus Christ; and this in correlation with who God eternally is in His triune Self. This is how the Christian encounters God, by the Spirit, through whom we affirm that Jesus is Lord. The Christian doesn’t encounter a speculatively produced pure act (actus purus) or pure being God whose reality is adumbrated by our philosophical negations and projections upon what this being must be like. No, the Christian, by definition, only is such as they come into encounter with the One who is their Brother, who is their Father, in the bond of the Holy Spirit. God determines, He pre-destines who He is in Himself to be who we become in Christ by Grace (not nature); that is, co-heirs with Jesus Christ, beholding the glory the Son has eternally shared with the Father in the bondage of the Holy Spirit.\n\nThe sum of it is that we ought to pursue this personalist, relational relationship with the living God because that is what He has already determined to be the case for us in Jesus Christ. We ought to be in doxological adoration of who He has Self-revealed and exegeted Himself to be for us in Jesus Christ; in the kerygmatic reality of the Good News that He is in proclamation. He isn’t a God out there, but a God with us, and God ‘closer to us than we are to ourselves’ (per Barth). That said, He isn’t available to be taken captive by our own untoward passions and desires. He instead sets the frame in the sobriety of His own life for us. As such, our worship and relationship with Him is predicated upon this type of discoursing, dialoguing intercourse with Him wherein what it means to be personal, relational, and intimate is dictated by who He is for us, rather than who we are towards Him (in our fallen frames of dust). He sets the boundaries of relationship relative to who He is, and because He created us to be in relationship with who He is, our re-creation in Christ finds a relational correspondence, in a fitting way, as that has been already laid for us in His telos (purpose) for the world in Jesus Christ.\n\nHopefully the reader is seeing how I am attempting to thread this needle. I.e., We are in a personalist, onto-relational relationship with the living and triune God on His terms rather than an abstract set of terms that we determine about Him based upon our own fallen and broken dispositions.\n\nThanks for reading me thinking out loud again.\n\nThe resurrection of Jesus Christ is what all of history is contingent upon. All that we experience, linearly, has a ground behind, underneath, and after it that is in fact the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Without that centraldogma there is no history; there is no nothing. I think we, especially as Christians of all people, really need to get our heads around this reality. When we do we start living as those who have the hope of Christ in us, the purifying hope. We have a critical valence to look at the world from that is not purely conditioned by the immediate hype and circumstance. This is what Barth captures so well:\n\nFor the history and message of Easter contains everything else, while without it everything else would be left in the air as a mere abstraction. Everything else in the New Testament contains and presupposes the resurrection. It is the key to the whole. We can agree finally that acceptance or rejection of the Gospel of the New Testament, at any rate as understood by the New Testament itself, depends on our acceptance or rejection of the evangelium quadraginta dierum [gospel of the forty days]. Either we believe with the New Testament in the risen Jesus Christ, or we do not believe in Him at all. This is the statement which believers and non-believers alike can surely accept as a fair assessment of the sources.[1]\n\nOn one hand you can hear in Barth a critique of Bultmann’s demythologizing project. But more theologically significant is simply the establishment of the fact “that Christ is risen” explains everything immediate, in regard to the composition of the New Testament itself. But even more, the resurrection makes sense of the whole of reality in a very organic rather than totalizing way. That is to say, the resurrection of Jesus Christ presents us with an openness of life towards the triune God. It is here where a theology of nature, and a theology of everything else is resident; that is, in the resurrected humanity of Jesus Christ. Without His humanity there would have never been any tinder for this world to be formed by; never a purpose for it to rotate in the Milky Way. Until this radical reality is apprehended the Christian will continue to inhabit a wilderness like experience. They won’t have the eyes to see or the ears to hear the depth reality and intonation of God’s still small voice as it breezes by them afresh anew by the Spirit’s hovering life. The resurrection makes all things new. It puts to death the old (sorry natural law/theology), and presents humanity with God’s humanity for the world in Jesus Christ. If we are going to have any chance of knowing God, of accessing His created order, and its telos, we will only come to this through participation with Jesus Christ; through His union with us, that we might be in union with Him, in the triune life of the eternal God.\n\n[1] Karl Barth, Church Dogmatics III/2 §47 [444] The Doctrine of Creation: Study Edition (London: T&T Clark, 2010), 7.\n\nWhat if Christ had never come? A rather counterfactual thought experiment, given the fact that He did. And yet Pierre Maury runs with this line for a moment in a Christmas sermon he gave in 1952 in his home country of France.\n\nThinking of our odd habit of making a distinction between the things we may have with Jesus Christ and in him, and the things we think we can think we can have without him, it occurred to me to imagine a world without Christmas, a world into which Jesus Christ had never and would never come, where we lived but had nothing with him. Imagine all the things we should have—and perhaps we should still have them all: all the things coveted by our greed, all the things which bring us remorse—everything.\n\nLet each of us imagine his life, and the lives of others, the life of the world and its history, without the coming of Jesus Christ. That means, in the end of the day, without forgiveness; for ever irremediably guilty, bearing for ever the indelible mark of the evil we have done. It would be a life without the prayer of Jesus Christ; that is to say, one in which our prayer could not lean upon his, in which we could not say ‘I beseech thee, O God, in the name of Jesus Christ’; a life, therefore, lived in constant terror of God, because of unanswered prayer. It would be a life without God’s word—all those wonderful sayings which the Gospels report, so generous that even the complete unbeliever marvels at them: the words of the Sermon on the Mount, St Paul’s hymns to charity, the words of St John on love. Just imagine a life for ever walled up in the egoism of others and of ourselves; a life without the Cross. A life with no place on earth to flee to where we could be ashamed and not despair. Lastly, imagine what such a life would be like, whatever riches it might have contained, when the great poverty of death—one’s own and that of others—came to make all riches quite useless. Such a world, without Jesus Christ, would be just hell.[1]\n\nGrievously, this counterfactual thought experiment isn’t counterfactual at all for the masses; those who travel on the highways and byways of the broad way, day in and out. The Christian, full of the living and risen and ascended hope of the living Christ, is surrounded by people who live in a world of self-possession, and the attending strife that produces. Maury is right, such a world, without Christ is in fact what hell is; the absence of God’s gracious intervention and disruption of such a world. This is the world that people inhabit all around who attempt to chop their life through the wane and woe of a Christless existence wherein all that is left in the end is the lonely incurved self.\n\nChrist has sent us as His emissaries to the world, to let it, them know that the dissolving world they inhabit all their waning lives has been resurrected, re-created in the ground of all of reality, the Firstborn from the dead, Jesus Christ. They need to be told that ‘it is finished,’ and all they need to do now is acknowledge that Christ is indeed Lord and King. That when they look at the dusty family Bibles on their grandparents’ coffee tables, that in fact it represents a Holy ground place wherein within its pages, by the Spirit’s vivification, they might in fact encounter the face of God in Jesus Christ; and that He will be smiling at them, with open arms of eternal embrace. ‘Faith comes by hearing, hearing the Word of God.’\n\n[1] Pierre Maury, Predestination and Other Papers (Richmond, Virginia: John Knox Press, 1960), 99–100.\n\n“Here is my servant whom I have chosen,\n\nthe one I love, in whom I delight;\n\nI will put my Spirit on him,\n\nand he will proclaim justice to the nations.\n\n19 He will not quarrel or cry out;\n\nno one will hear his voice in the streets.\n\n20 A bruised reed he will not break,\n\nand a smoldering wick he will not snuff out,\n\ntill he has brought justice through to victory.\n\n21 In his name the nations will put their hope.” –Mathew 12.18-21\n\nIf, ten years ago, you had told me that I would live to see literate evangelicals, some with doctorates and a seminary teaching record, arguing for the reality of an eternal salvation, divinely guaranteed, that may have in it no repentance, no discipleship, no behavioral change, no practical acknowledgment of Christ as Lord of one’s life, and no perseverance in faith, I would have told you that you were out of your mind. –J. I. Packer\n\nI just came across the above quote of J.I. Packer from someone on X/Twitter. It seems that some are not aware that Packer was a proponent of what has been called experimental predestinarianism; even to the more idiosyncratic version of that as propounded in John MacArthur’s book, The Gospel According to Jesus (i.e., JMac’s Lordship Salvation book). We could identify these things, more simply, as a nomist or juridical/law-based theory of salvation. Without getting into the depths of its socio-economic background and development within the late mediaeval and early reformational milieu in Western Europe, suffice it to say that this theory of salvation is largely framed by an appeal to a quid pro quo mercantilist framework of thinking. As this theory further developed it later became known as Federal or Covenantal theology, again funded by a contractual-transactional notion of salvation. Packer would be much more closely aligned with this historic development, while MacArthur simply abstracts the themes he prefers from it, and pastes them into his own stylized version of a Baptistic theology (so, a mere 5-point Calvinism). But functionally, and thematically, as noted, Packer could agree with the type of requirements that MacArthur delineates in his Lordship salvation. They both agree that there must be some type of moral transformation and ongoing action in the purportedly elect’s life, if in fact we should think that said professor of salvation is actually a possessor.\n\nAnd yet, Jesus came for the Bruised Reeds, the Smoldering Wicks among us. He came for the sick, not the healthy. He came for the people who are in fact failures, and know it. He places all of the expectations of salvation on Himself—He who knew no sin became sin for us that we might become the righteousness of God in Him—as such the broken can give up; they can quit striving; they can look away from their own performances, and instead look at God’s performance for them in the acts and facts of Jesus Christ. If Jesus was walking the streets today, He’d literally be hanging out with the tweakers, the crackheads, and bums who inhabit the streets and tunnels in our various cities. These types of people are the elect of God in the Kingdom of Heaven. The Kingdom of God in Christ turns the system of this world upside down; it takes what would appear weak and foolish and makes it the wisdom of God. In Christ, who is indeed, the elect of God for us, the bums among us find repose and hope to live one more day; a day for and up to eternity in and from the everlasting life of the triune God for them in the vicarious humanity of Jesus Christ. It is His resurrection power, His re-created humanity that has “checked all the boxes” of God’s holiness requirements. He knows that we will continue to be simul justus et peccator (simultaneously justified and sinner) as we inhabit these bodies of death; He knows that we will continue to sin, even to the point that even if we say we have no sin we make Him a liar and His truth is not in us. This is why Christ is the Advocate for us before the Father; not just for now, but for all eternity. The scars in his hands, feet, and side will remain forever unto all the ages to come as a reminder that we are only standing in God’s presence, in His glorified body in Christ, because He first loved us in Christ, that we might secondly love Him from Christ’s love for us in Him.\n\nThe nomist theory of salvation is balderdash! It heaps loads and burdens on the peoples that the peoples were never designed to bear. God’s salvation is His Grace for us ‘all-the-way-down.’ God’s Grace for us starts at the bottom of Christ’s feet and ascends all the way up through His ascended body into the heavenlies, at the Right Hand of the Father, where He always lives to make intercession for us. If you are striving under these balderdash theories of salvation—the ones that press you further into your navels, into your performance and ‘pact-keeping’—reckon such thoughts as dead, and understand that you are now alive in Christ’s new creation for you, His resurrected and ascended body for you/us. The Gospel is either all of God for us, or it is none of us for God. The “proof of salvation,” God’s salvation for us, is the Christ seated next to the Father from moment to moment. It is through union with Christ, unio cum Christo, wherein we find the anchor of our souls. We don’t reflexively look at our lives prior to looking to Christ’s life for us (the nomist way of salvation). We look immediately to the Father through the eyes of the Son, through the body of the Son, as we in participation with Christ (participatio Christi) dwell in the bosom of the Father; wherein, Christ forevermore exegetes the Father, the shared coinhering life of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit for us. ‘This is eternal life that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.’\n\nPierre Maury was Karl Barth’s ‘French connection’ and friend. Without Maury’s thinking and writing on a reformulated Reformed doctrine of predestination, Barth’s turn, and own treatment of predestination (as exemplified in his Church Dogmatics II/2) may never have happened; at least not in the shape that it did. Here is Maury on a critique of the classical Augustinian inspired doctrine of election/reprobation (especially as that developed within what came to be called Post Reformed orthodox Dogmatics in the 16th and 17th centuries, respectively):\n\nBefore we proceed further, there is an important point which must be made clear. If what we have said is true, it is obvious that the decree of election—call it predestination here, if you will—is not, as classic theology has maintained, from Augustine to Luther Calvin and the orthodox dogmatic theologians of the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, the obscure and impenetrable decision of a divinity who does not, on this point, reveal his designs. It was because they asserted that the absolute decree of the Creator, anterior to any creation—and even to any fall, as the Supralapsarians held—was the unknowable secret of an absolute power, that predestination frightened even those who defended it with the most unflagging ardour. There was Calvin, for instance, whom the ‘labyrinths’ of this mystery filled with a kind of holy terror. How can it be otherwise, if we know and can know nothing of the motives which lie behind God’s creative activity, if the liberty with which he loves us is replaced by the arbitrary decision of pure omnipotence? How can such a God of the covenant, appear in that eternity (and so in time, in which his purposes are worked out) as anything but a capricious tyrant; not the God of grace but the wielder of a crushing power who is worshipped only in terror? How is one to be sure that it his will to save the lost?\n\nOf course I do not wish for a moment to detract from the mystery of God’s sovereign liberty. He wills to act only in accordance with his good pleasure (Phil. 2.13), but is a good pleasure. His entire revelation tells us so, tirelessly. There is nothing higher than his goodness, nor anterior to it. God loves always, from all eternity. And his purpose, before which, and outside which, there is none other, is to ally his life with the life of men in mutual love. Often, moved by their adoration of the divine majesty, the great predestinarian doctors—especially Calvin—have exalted the mystery of the absolute decree. But why have they turned it into a mystery as impenetrable as night, the secret of an opaque God? God does not live and act in the obscurity of eternal darkness, but in light—‘unapproachable’, yes, but light! Darkness and night are, in the Bible, the abode of the Devil, in which he plans and prepares his ‘works of darkness’. If there is any tyrannical power that would victimize man, it is he, not the Father ‘who hath delivered us from the power of darkness’ (Col. 1.13), and ‘hath called [us] out of darkness into his marvellous light’ (I Peter 2.9).\n\nIf it is necessary, then, to maintain the mystery of election—and it is absolutely necessary, for God’s freedom is the sovereign liberty of the Creator, which our liberty may neither dispute nor judge: ‘O man, who art thou that repliest against God?’ (Rom. 9.20)—it is only on the basis of knowing and preaching that this mystery is none other than the peace that passes understanding. It is unfathomable because the love of God is unfathomable. And the only act of adoration God expects of us is our wonder at a purpose that overwhelms us.[1]\n\nIf the reader is aware of Barth’s own reformulation of a Reformed doctrine of predestination, what we just read from Maury should ring familiar to you.\n\nWhether reading Barth, Torrance, Maury et al. the theme remains the same: for them, respectively, to think a doctrine of predestination (election/reprobation) in abstraction from a purposeful ground in Jesus Christ, is to not think a genuinely Christian, and thus biblical doctrine of predestination. This is the crux of it all: i.e., how someone arrives at their relative conclusions in regard to a doctrine of predestination, have directly to do with the theory of revelation (and authority) they affirm. If they are committed to a principled revelational understanding of knowing God, they will look something like Maury on a doctrine of predestination. If not, and they hold to a principled speculative and negative understanding of knowing God, they will look something like Thomas Aquinas, and his respective heirs in the Post Reformed orthodox development.\n\nThe issue, ultimately, comes down to a very practical and spiritual one. The way we think God determines all subsequent doctrinal developments. If we think God’s will toward us remains hidden in some sort of ‘horrible decree’ of election/reprobation, then we will have good reason to live in an unhealthy fear of Him. If we believe that God has fully Self-revealed Himself for us in the face of Jesus Christ, in a filial relationship of triune love, then we will have a healthy fear and love of the Father. This will latterly shape the way we engage with and treat others; both within the Church and world.\n\nFor further reading on Pierre Maury and his theology, especially as that relates to Barth’s own developing theology, see: Simon Hattrell’s exquisite book: Election, Barth, and the French Connection, 2nd Edition: How Pierre Maury Gave a “Decisive Impetus” to Karl Barth’s Doctrine of Election.\n\n[1] Pierre Maury, Predestination and Other Papers (Richmond, Virginia: John Knox Press, 1960), 35–6."
