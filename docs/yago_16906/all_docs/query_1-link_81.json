        "text": "JANUARY\n\nFriday, the 1st of January. Last night there was heavy thunder, lightning, and rain, which made the way to church somewhat difficult for the people from the plantations. But I believe our dear, living God has richly rewarded the pains they took for the sake of His word. For He granted power and joy to preach the sweet gospel of Jesus Christ three times, through which our hearts were quite strengthened anew and were aroused to His praise.\n\nLast year in our congregation twenty-four little children were baptized, six people (to wit, two men and four small children) died, and six couples were married. It is very comforting to us that both men, as well as the children, went to their rest in the wounds of Christ, our faithful Immanuel, and thus passed away in peace. Oh, may He bless His gospel for all to the end that no one remain amidst his sins, rather that all may convert to Him in truth and become His little well cleansed sheep and thereby complete the course of their lives with joy. We often think: “May thy loyalty fulfill what Thou Thyself hast promised, that no one shall be lost on this wide world but will live forever if only he is full of faith. Lord Jesus, grant us this.”\n\nI was gladdened to learn this New Year’s Day that the illness of a frail and often sick young girl had served her through God’s grace, as occasion and remedy, to escape as a poor sinner to Christ and become spiritually whole and sound through His wounds. For six months she has been having heavy fevers and with them epilepsy.1 In her fever she constantly says very edifying things, converses in prayer and song with Jesus, and desires to receive a blessing and good consolation from others too. Nothing disorderly or unruly is mixed with this, so we see clearly that she has garnered a good treasure in her heart.\n\nSaturday, the 2nd of January. Towards evening I received a letter from a captain from Palachocolas, in which he asked me to marry a couple; otherwise the captain would not allow them on his plantation. These two people had already been at our place on Wednesday at Ortmann’s house. Before they came to Ebenezer they capsized in their boat and would have lost their lives if, by divine dispensation, a trading boat had not come to their aid and picked them up. I had the schoolmaster tell him that I do not marry Englishmen unless there is no English preacher in the country and, in addition, I had sufficient assurance from the authorities that the marriage would take place in accordance with divine and human law.2\n\nSunday, the 3rd of January. It became rather cold today; nonetheless, it did not hinder our divine services. We are still lacking the upper floor and windows in the church; and, after the holiday, preparations will be made for completing the same. There are so many different kinds of work to do in the congregation, especially because the 4th transport is not yet fully settled in, that the members of the congregation must do only the most necessary things at first; for they have no servants and have to be present everywhere at once. Only a few will be able to build their houses this winter, and they will still have to make do in their huts and kitchens.\n\nThe man in the 4th transport who recently took to excessive drink in Savannah (and had carried on the same thing quite often in Germany) is coming to a recognition of his and also this damnable sin. He thanks God for snatching him away from such opportunities and bringing him to this solitude where he can hear the word of God and take it to heart in the quiet. He has resolved to change and thus use his time well in Ebenezer. For the sake of our new parishioners I hope God will not let us come to grief in the hope we have placed in His unfathomable mercy to be able to lead them all to the Lord Christ! Oh, may He stand by us in our ministry!\n\nMonday, the 4th of January. I was occupied with Mr. Vigera for several hours paying the people of the 4th transport their food allowance for three months. Thereby I was reminded what advantages they enjoy in this over the first colonists. The latters’ yearly provision amounted to approximately 7 £ sterling. They still had much toil and hardship in bringing the provisions, good and bad, the long way up the swift Savannah River; for the present mill river was not yet known or usable.3 In place of provisions (besides tools) the men receive over 6 £ sterling for six months, but the women somewhat less. God be praised for these and other benefactions which He has rendered so richly to this transport in Europe and here in this country and is continuing to render.\n\nIn today’s evening prayer meeting I repeated with the children in the presence of the congregation a few of the introductory verses which had been impressed upon us during this church year beginning with the first Sunday of Advent. I and others were pleased that they could quote them, say them by heart, and point out their main content. The verses were chiefly: “My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work,” etc., and also “Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die,” etc.\n\nTuesday, the 5th of January. It has been arranged that tomorrow following the divine services, when as many members as can come down from the plantations are gathered, the charitable gifts from Augsburg and Wurttemberg will be distributed. Hence today they were put in perfect order and so divided that we are hoping for general delight and satisfaction among the members of all four transports. There will be instruction for them concerning a few things, and through this we hope to obviate all mistrust and ill judgments. On account of the high waters the journey hither has been difficult for the people, and besides that there have been all kinds of delays in housekeeping on account of the 4th transport. This moved us to select the holy day tomorrow for the distribution.\n\nThrough God’s singular direction our dear benefactors are doing the same thing for us and our dear members that Christian parents do for their children at ths Christmastide: they like to cause them innocent joy by means of material presents; and they use such gifts as bonds of love through which they can lead them more and more to the gracious Giver of all good and perfect gifts, who granted even His son to the children of men, and to awaken them to a heartfelt mutual love.\n\nGod be praised for these quite great benefactions which He has caused to flow to us from Wurttemberg and Augsburg; and may our poor intercession bring much blessing, in lieu of a reward, to all givers for the sake of Christ! We intend to thank them in heaven (whither we and they are striving) before the throne of God for refreshing us so often in this life and for giving us so many occasions for joy at the loving kindness of God and for the praise of His name through their loving gifts and heartfelt correspondence. At our humble prayer He will grant us power, grace, and wisdom to apply all the gifts we have received to the purpose for which they are in fact dedicated.\n\nWednesday, the 6th of January was the Feast of the Epiphany. This day has been for us a day of great joy and grace in the Lord, for God has given us power and joy to preach the sweet gospel of Jesus Christ, the Savior of poor sinners. By means of it our own and our members’ minds have been prepared for the joyful, humble, and grateful reception of the material benefactions which have flowed to us from joyous and mild hearts, to His sincere praise, and also prepared for a unanimous prayer of intercession for the spiritual and material welfare of our friends, known and unknown, in Europe.\n\nThe entire congregation had gathered before noon, and in the afternoon, to listen to the divine word in our place of worship, where, amongst other rousing hymns, we struck up in two choirs: Singt dem Herrn nah und fern, etc., and finally, O grosse Freude, dass auf der Weyde die Hirten hören, etc.4 In the exordium we learned from the mouth of our loving Immanuel the magnificent commandment of God, so comforting to all sinners: “Compel them to come in, that my house may be filled,” Luke 14. From this holy day’s gospel we recognized God’s heartfelt readiness to accept poor sinners to grace, for the sake of Christ, for us sinners a most highly comforting thing.\n\nIn the application lesson we showed it to be quite undeniable that God wanted to have us all with His Son and His dear grace, for He was giving us the same means of grace He had given to others, according to the direction in the gospel, and He was creating very salutary emotions in our congregation, as He did through the Wise Men from the Orient, by means of blessed missives and generous, munificent gifts of our worthy benefactors. No one should keep resting on his couch of sin, self-assurance,5 and love of the world, as Herod and both high and humble did in Jerusalem; rather each and every one should, according to God’s purpose and that of our cordially minded benefactors, let himself be brought to Jesus Christ and into His kingdom, so that it may be said: “Every man presseth into it,” as poor people do at the distribution of material gifts in the benefactor’s house, or people who have their enemy at their backs throng into a fortress.\n\nAlong with this we both recounted what splendid and magnificent gifts of money and other necessities had been collected during the troublesome times in Germany and also read aloud and recounted how the distribution of such gifts was partly made by the benefactors themselves and partly left to our own discretion. And, since the congregation can be assured that we love them all and treat them impartially, they have been admonished to the contentment, praise of God, and heartfelt gratitude. Each should accept his gift with just such a loving heart as it was dedicated and sent to our Ebenezer. I promised soon to read aloud to them the preface to the 6th Continuation,6 as I had done recently with the 5th, from which they would recognize the friendly and heartfelt intentions of our faithful benefactors, their heartfelt good wishes and the good purpose of their gifts.\n\nAfter the afternoon catechism lesson was over, we admonished the congregation to bend their hearts’ and bodies’ knees with us before the Lord there in the church (where there is more space and opportunity than in my house, the place of distribution) and then praised our dear Lord from the bottom of our hearts for His spiritual and physical benefactions which He had shown us, beyond so many other people, here in this corner of the earth. We prayed for our benefactors and all of Europe, calling out to Him for wisdom and blessings in the coming distribution. We also implored forgiveness if by chance those benefactions were not used by all to their intended purpose.\n\nWe conducted the distribution in my house with the assistance of Mr. Vigera. Each person for whom a portion had been laid out came up, one after the other, in a quite fine Christian manner and without the least clamor or any unpleasant problems. First the old inhabitants of Ebenezer received their portions, according to the order of their dwellings in the town; and subsequently the people of the 4th transport received theirs. Because the latter, with very few exceptions, were provided with enough clothing from Europe, we provided more linen, shoes, and woolen goods for the first three transports than we did for the latter group. Nonetheless, the poor amongst them also received their modest share, but the remainder got for the most part the iron tools and supplies found in the crates from Wurttemberg.\n\nThe names of the people of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd transports, and their shares, are as follows:\n\nSome Observations\n\n1) 3 £ 10 sh. were designated for those who have deserved well of the congregation, and therefore Kogler, Kalcher, Steiner, Leimberger, Christian Riedelsperger, and Rottenberger received some of it.\n\n2) 18 £ sterl. were dedicated to the poor of all four transports, which, according to the nature of their circumstances, was allotted to them at 10, 8, or 6 shillings. From this sum the surgeon, Mr. Meyer, was paid 2 £. 4 Sh. for the medicines and bloodletting he extended to the 4th transport during the entire trip. The remainder for the fresh provisions given them in Savannah when they guarded the baggage and fetched it, came from the 7 £ 5 Sh. dedicated to the 4th transport alone; it amounted to 2 £ 1 Sh.\n\n3) Senior Riesch in Lindau again thought lovingly of those Salzburgers who were in his good pasture and spiritual care and sent them a piece of linen from which each person got 3-½ yds., and therefore more than one shirt. The green linen, which fell to us also from his loving hands, was dedicated to the church windows as curtains.\n\n4) The tools of every sort were found in the Wurttemberg boxes and were distributed for the most part to the 4th transport, but a small number did go to some others. We were able to record them only in general. Each family also received 5 curved and 5 straight cobbler’s awls.\n\n5) Some people did receive more than others, in which we looked upon their decorum, extreme need, and merit amongst the congregation.\n\n6) Several large and small children could not partake of the presents this time (because there were not enough of them, as the congregation had increased). If they are obedient, they shall be provided for with gifts from the box from Halle, for which we are now waiting.\n\n7) May our dear God enter into His book of commemoration what He caused to flow to us two, our helpmeets, and children, from the right heartfelt goodwill of our worthy benefactors and benefactresses from Wurttemberg and Augsburg in the way of books, black cloth, night gowns, and other things, also in cash money. In like manner may He remember what we have received in money for the orphans’ and widows’ house and for the church and other necessary expenditures in the congregation, which have indeed occurred in manifold ways, being so abundantly transmitted from the places mentioned and from our dear Halle. For the sake of Christ’s speaking blood may all sincerely good works be written in His book for the physical, spiritual, and eternal blessing and blessed refreshment of our worthy benefactors. May He hear our poor prayers of intercession, brought privately and publicly before His throne of grace, according to the richness of His mercy. Amen! Hallelujah! To the blessing contained in the box from Halle which stayed behind in London out of necessity we cry out in faith, “What our God hath created, He can also save.”9\n\n8) The large mattresses with bolsters were lent to the 4th transport in London and were distributed at the direction of Court Chaplain Ziegenhagen amongst the needy of the first three transports.\n\n9) The 6 leather cowls and 2 fur cowls, likewise leather thongs and leather garters, are listed in the catalog of things in the box n.I.E. but were not found. Also 5 white camisoles were missing, which Mr. Meyer still saw in London in a small box.\n\nNames and Shares of the People of the 4th Transport\n\nSome Observations\n\n1) Every head of family of the 4th transport received 2 Sh. Sterl., and a child under 12 received 1 Sh. as a present. Besides that, the poor amongst them received a special present of 7, 12, or 14 Sh. Sterl. as their circumstances necessitated. These were distinct from those money gifts promised them in Canstadt and paid them here as well.\n\n2) Every family received a few books which were found in the boxes, also each and every housefather got 5 curved and 5 straight shoe awls. Sewing needles shall be given them shortly.\n\n3) A few, but very few, asked me to return the money most of the people on the 4th transport had deposited for exchange. They said they would rather know it was kept safely with me until they might buy cows in the spring or use it in some other necessary manner.\n\n4) There are still peas, pearled barley, and dried fruit left from what was given them when they departed Canstadt. All that and what otherwise pertains to the 4th transport in the way of kitchen and other types of utensils will be distributed shortly or arranged for the congregation’s use.\n\nThursday, the 7th of January. Five men from the 4th transport had their land surveyed on Ebenezer Creek. I would have been glad to see them settle the matter without casting lots amongst themselves, as others have done, and get together in a neighborhood with people who mix well and like working together. The locksmith Lechner and his stepson /Ruprecht Schrempff/ the only ones who did not at all like casting lots. On account of his trade he would have liked to have the plantation nearest the town, but the others also had their eyes on it, as it was a good one and close by. We finally agreed that the matter would be settled by casting lots. I assured them that, since we had previously appealed to God in a heartfelt manner regarding it, He would so ordain things with the plantations that each one could be satisfied while denying his own self-will. Dictum factum,10 the casting of lots turned out to everyone’s satisfaction; and, after each had inspected his land, two of them came back to me and attested that they had received just such plantations as were laid out for each one’s purpose. God be praised for this sign of His kindness too! May He continue to rule over us and keep our eyes open properly to regard His works and to have nothing but pleasure in them.\n\nFriday, the 8th of January. A German widow from Savannah came to our place and wished to spend her time here in quiet near God’s word, if she could find a living. Mr. Vigera had promised to take her into his service as soon as he got his household in order, but that will not take place very soon. If she wishes to adapt herself to our circumstances and be satisfied with little she will find a place of abode amongst us, but I do not know whether she will like these suggestions. She said that in Savannah she can earn one shilling Sterling a day besides good food and drink, but no one here can give her that. Another honest widow is coming with her daughter to our place this week, for sincere reasons.11\n\nYesterday evening here in the city and this morning on the plantations we began going through the edifying contents of the foreword to the 6th Continuation. I felt God’s support and blessing tangibly and felt that thereby something good was accomplished for eternity in the souls of the listeners. May God reward our worthy Mr. N. for the many tasks he has willingly and joyfully undertaken for our spiritual and physical well-being. We, and thousands with us (praise God!) know from experience that his work in the Lord is not in vain and will have its reward in His time.\n\nAfter the devotional hour Mr. Vigera was busy at the mill, where the 4th transport’s baggage, provisions, and other things had been off-loaded. He distributed the victuals brought from Germany—peas, pearled barley, dried apples and pears, and also prunes—amongst the new colonists, with great labor but also great pleasure, for he attested to me that he had never found the people so joyful, friendly, and thankful as this time. I take that as a blessed effect of the word preached just prior thereto, and I glorify God for it, for we have remonstrated a great deal with the 4th transport in the most heartfelt, loving manner concerning their former and present modes of life. We also indicated to them the sources from the gospel by which they can cleanse themselves from sin in divine order and gain strength for a new spiritual life and mode of behavior. I was occupied with the tools sent to me for distribution among all the families of the 4th transport. They consisted of axes, hatchets, wide and narrow hoes, drawknives, large and small planes, large, mid-sized and small bits, large and small saws, also crosscut saws, as well as files, hammers, and a large amount of all sorts of nails, etc. There were also a few copper pots with handles and many other things with them, by which the Trustees showed themselves especially generous.\n\nGod helped everything to come out according to plan and to everyone’s satisfaction, since various things had to go by the casting of lots. My faith and trust in divine providence, which is so wonderful, received new strength. In Savannah I recently bought pork and beef fat for the 4th transport. A 500-lb. barrel of rice was also brought hither from Savannah; Pichler was busy distributing it. Towards evening we were finished with everything; and, although I was quite tired, I still had to attend a funeral at sundown, for which the dear people had been waiting some hours in Ruprecht Steiner’s house not far from the cemetery. It was Paul Zittrauer’s newborn child named Samuel, the first this year to die in the Lord, who was buried this day, which was right blessed for me and others. On New Year’s Day, on the occasion of the introductory words to John XI, “Behold, how he loved him,” I had wished that I could hold a parentation and funeral oration according to the contents of these words for those who would die this year according to God’s will and that it would engender joy in heaven and edification on earth and be the most blessed thing for those who passed away thus.\n\nNow the burial of this little Samuel (upon whom the above words can be applied with the greatest certainty) proved for the parents and myself to be a right great comfort and awakening, for in this connection it is also written, “Suffer little chidren, and forbid them not, to come unto me,” etc., and in reference to us adults: “Except ye be converted, and become as little children,” etc. I told these two young people that this could be a weighty incentive for them to prepare themselves earnestly for blessed eternity, since now their little Samuel had preceded them, etc.\n\nSaturday, the 9th of January. Yesterday afternoon the surveyor12 was ordered to go with me to the plantations below the mill, after the distribution had taken place, to where some new colonists were to take their land; but I was hindered as mentioned above. Hence this morning, I went out there in order to scrupulously inspect, with him and a few new and old colonists, the entire area where they should and would take their plantations. Six of them are each taking here 48 acres (for that much land, besides a garden, belongs to each plantation), and they intend to begin their work here very soon. The whole area has very good soil for cultivation and cattle grazing, also as much good timber in the vicinity as hardly any others find at their plantations. I hope that they will be able to support themselves here in their calling with satisfaction and thanksgiving towards God and men. There is still more good land in this district, which will be kept for others who need land in the future. I was happy to be able to observe everything myself and conduct the division of the plantations.\n\nSince the death of her husband the N. woman seems to be more concerned about her salvation than previously, and is quite content in her great poverty. She told me her dying husband had called out the words: “Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in Him; and He shall bring it to pass.” She said that, however, whenever distress befalls her, she prays in her simple way to God as well as she can, and she hopes God will grant her prayer for Christ’s sake.\n\nMonday, the 11th of January. Our dear Mr. Vigera brought along a fine physical blessing in money for our orphanage and thereby awakened us to a new praise of God. With it he gave me some very edifying letters from Christian friends, the right evangelical contents of which heartily refreshed me and inspired me to a heartfelt mutual love and esteem for them. Praise God that the Lord still has His people everywhere, even in dark and very perverse places, who shine as lights amongst the perverse people of our age, yet have their own suffering. May He be mindful of their benefit once more in all sorts of internal and external circumstances.\n\nA coachman in Augsburg who loves Ebenezer benefited not only a young girl but also some of his countrymen with a fine physical gift, for which they will wish him many thousands of blessings in their prayers. They are all poor but they strive first and foremost for the kingdom of God, and God lets other things come to them too. This time God granted our orphanage such a blessing as we might not have expected in these troublesome times. He can do more than we ask and understand! May He give us the wisdom to proceed properly with it and to apply it to the purpose for which it was granted.13\n\nToday two large wine barrels full of dried apples, pears, and plums or prunes were brought from the mill to the town. They were dedicated by our worthy benefactors in Wurttemberg partly for the orphanage and partly for the whole congregation. Oh, what a blessing that is! The barrels were stuffed quite full, and the gifts pressed so tightly together that we had to dig them out with effort and pleasant sweat. Now here we say: “Good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For the same measure ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again. He which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.” May our merciful God cause that to be richly fulfilled in all our dear patrons and benefactors, here and there! God preserved this noble gift (through which the sound and the sick, and also the tender little children will be refreshed) so well that there was no sign of a single worm or of the least damage. We say once more: “What our God hath created He can also preserve, over it He will rule with mercy both late and early, etc. Give glory unto God.”\n\nIn recent days a Christian man from the Purysburg region sent me as a New Year’s present the verse Deuteronomy 11:12: “A land which the Lord thy God careth for: the eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.”14 What a delightful testimony to the gracious providence of God for a land with obedient inhabitants; it was very impressive to me in view of the current circumstances in which we are living at the beginning of this year. Oh, that everyone in Ebenezer might fear, love, and honor Him! How good we would have it! We are hoping it will be a special year of grace for us and our members.\n\nA widow who was at my house because of her intended marriage told me she had once heard that marriage and dying are the most important matters for which one needs grace. She considered a child who died in baptismal grace to be most blessed, and she would gladly give her own child in her arms to the Lord Jesus if He would take it to Himself forever by means of temporal death.\n\nThe weather has been as pleasant yesterday and today as it is otherwise wont to be in spring. Many fine seeds came to our place from Germany with the 4th transport, and we will try to see whether everything will sprout and propagate itself here.\n\nTuesday, the 12th of January. We sent our large boat with four men to Savannah this morning to fetch some barrels of rice and pork for the orphanage and the 4th transport. The dear people who have till now had a great deal of trouble in traveling back and forth will be paid for this labor by the orphanage. One thing after another has been happening, and now we will get some respite.\n\nKalcher is supervisor both for the congregation and the 4th transport; and it eases our burden considerably for him to distribute all sorts of foodstuffs and things which the 4th transport needs. His wife is keeping an account of it, and our dear God has already richly rewarded him through the blessing which the orphanage is receiving at this time. They both consider themselves quite unworthy of these benefactions they have now received, and their unworthiness becomes all the more apparent to them the more abundantly the Lord shows them His paternal care.\n\nThe N.N. woman believes she deserves punishment because of her youthful sins; and since, in spite of that, God has inundated her with so many benefactions, He wishes to convince her thereby that He has forgiven her everything for Christ’s sake. He wishes to awaken her thereby, but mostly through the comforting gospel of His Son our Savior, the very best gift, for whose sake it pleases Him to grant poor persons everything else to cause a sweet trust and childlike love in return. But she is all too much hindered in this evangelical joy by the recognition of her total unworthiness and abundant misdeeds. My exhortation for today, which she had to forego for some time because of my travel and errands, was very dear to her and awakened her to the praise of God.\n\nPrior to the devotional hour on the plantations I and two knowledgeable men sought a commodious and level spot on which to place the soon to be built church and cemetery. We found such a place in the center of the plantations and homesteads. It is very suitable for this purpose, and I hope that the work on it will commence shortly. The first thing will be for the men of all four transports to set about jointly building a bridge over the little river between the city and the plantations. This is indispensable to us and will serve to advance our office greatly in diligently visiting the members of our congregation. The proper construction was fully discussed in the congregation; and tomorrow, God willing and if the rainy weather permits, a few men are going out to inspect the area carefully to see where the bridge can be built advantageously. God has granted them something sweet in this bitter labor through the benefaction mentioned yesterday; it is an easy thing for Him to add still more for the refreshment of both great and humble. Before I left here this morning I had some neighbors who were living in discord come to me. I showed them the dried fruit standing in some open barrels and asked them whether, in the sight of this gift from God, they still wished to keep their hearts bitter toward each other. We reached the point of their becoming reconciled with one another, and they went home in peace.\n\nOur dear Peter Reiter has been under treatment for a long time and is now being tended by Mr. Mayer. We do not know what he will have to pay to his surgeon because he has not had time to make up his bill.15 Doubtless it will amount to a great deal. Nonetheless, since God has attained His purpose with him through this bodily travail and has converted him in a righteous manner to His Son, the comfort of fallen men, He will also care for him like a father reconciled through Christ and will fulfill what is cited with the greatest assurance in the Book of Job regarding the relationship of God to His children. For his bandaging and cure this dear man not only needs the mercy that he has experienced in his soul but also needs God to grant him the medical fees for bandaging and treatment.\n\nThe dear and loving friend of our congregation, Mr. Durninger, has sent twenty-five florins to Senior Urlsperger with the request that this money be given to the poorest God-fearing person in the congregation to buy a cow. On account of his treatment this man Reiter had to sell a cow and an ox; and, because he will not be able to work for a year and a day but can therefore pray all the more diligently, we recognize with joy God’s kindness toward him. For Mr. Vigera agrees with us that this benefaction of the twenty-five florins should be applied to this dear man so he can once again acquire a cow. Doubtless by this means his faith will be strengthened in the same manner as our own.\n\nWe are also giving the Maurer woman some assistance from the blessing God put at our disposal for the benefit of the congregation and the orphanage.16 In this we will take care that these dear and righteous people do not suffer any more than the others in their subsistence, for they would rather give away all their little money and other things that bring debt upon themselves. Thus the Lord knows our need but also knows means and ways out of it “for that He is strong in power; not one faileth.” Should that not strengthen us in our faith? We wish the good of the 41st Psalm, especially vv. 2–4, to all our worthy benefactors. They are certainly unaware of these and other circumstances of the congregation, yet they let their hearts and hands be steered towards dispensing of charity.\n\nWednesday, the 13th of January. This morning we distributed the dried fruit amongst the first, second, and third transports, for the fourth had already received its good portion partly on the journey and partly in Ebenezer a short time ago. For this reason, the people came in from the plantations, although it was raining. To be sure this physical gift was well worth their taking such trouble; nonetheless, I considered it needful and useful to impart to them the spiritual along with the physical so that they might turn homewards refreshed thus in body and soul. To this end the distribution was combined with singing, praying, and devout preaching of the divine word.\n\nIn his last letter our dear Senior Urlsperger mentioned the following little verse, which we read aloud yesterday on the plantation, with much blessing: “With God thy faith is well disposed. Thy love will help thy neighbor if thou art born of God.”17 I recently put these select and beautiful words to good use for myself and the gathered listeners before the distribution. Praise be to God for the spiritual blessing He has sent me and the others from this; and may He let our worthy benefactors, who have shown their faith and their birth from God so splendidly through their charity in regards to our congregation, enjoy in time and eternity the good they have done for us. I mentioned herewith Acts 11:28 ff.\n\nThursday, the 14th of January. Amongst the last transport, Bacher received his brother, with wife and one daughter.18 Because he [the brother] is old and too weak for felling trees and running a plantation, Sanftleben has sold him his plantation with all the buildings on it for 24 £. It is, to be sure, a lot of money; but it did take much labor before everything could be arranged in such an orderly manner. The plantation is extremely well situated and has very good land for corn and rice, is never in danger of flooding, lies just at the junction of the Savannah River and the mill river, offers good opportunities for raising cattle, and is also very near the town. Sanftleben is now taking for himself a plantation on Ebenezer Creek with nothing but trees and bushes. He will be a neighbor of the schoolmaster and some other people from the 4th transport, and we hope this too will turn out profitably. This region, fruitful and well-suited for everything, has lain wild and uncultivated till now, because everyone preferred settling and building first on the mill river.\n\nSaturday, the 16th of January. N.N.’s pious wife recounted to me with much joy and praise of God that, through the grace of God, her husband, who was previously given to drink, was becoming quite a different man. He wishes, she said, to write to Germany in truth and to the glory of God that he had wandered many places but had been unable to find any place so remote and pleasurable for living as God had presented him in this wilderness, etc. He said he could serve God and men in his profession in quiet, he had enough work, and was living with Christian people on the plantations. Praise God also for this blessing!\n\nSunday, the 17th of January. We predicted to the people of the 4th transport today from God’s word according to the instruction of the gospel for the second Sunday of Epiphany that they, as neophytes, must hold themselves in readiness for all sorts of spiritual and physical trials, but that these would not redound to their harm, rather to their salvation. For what is hiding in their hearts will be revealed; people do not generally believe from God’s word that they are so evil. But should external and internal suffering be added, then indeed there arise lack of faith or weak faith, impatience, love of the world and its aids, for which the Lord gladly wants to forgive us and heal our wounds, if only we ask for it in the recognition of our misery.19 Then the Lord makes plain His glory.\n\nMonday, the 18th of January. During the absence of my dear colleague I held school with the children in the church for the first time. The mild weather was quite suitable for it. I began singing the very impressive hymn Ich bin ja Herr in Deiner Macht, etc., with them, because I desired it to be known in the congregation because of its weighty content and moving melody. After the prayer I reminded the children of the many good things our miraculous and benevolent God was doing for them here and from other places. I told them He would do more if they were grateful from their hearts and would yield up their hearts sincerely to the Lord Jesus. Ingratitude, however, would move God to take back His benefactions and actually to punish, a clear example of which they could see in the people of Bethlehem. Because they did not respect the best gift of all, Jesus, Who was born in Bethlehem, He was taken from them, and the parents had to live the sorrow of their hearts in their children, slaughtered at the command of Herod. At this point I read them the short and sincerely humble letter from the dear little son of a pious mother to our congregation, enclosing a gift of two florins for the poor. It is printed in the foreword to the 6th Continuation.20\n\nI have long wished to praise God in the orphanage, with both adults and children, for the recently arrived spiritual and physical gifts of money and all sorts of things pertaining to clothing; and today I found the best time for it. We sang the hymn Lobe den Herrn, o meine Seele, etc., which even the smallest children know by heart. I then reminded them of what had taken place amongst us at the recent Feast of the Epiphany. From the gospel of Matthew 2:1 ff., we had learned that the heavenly Father had aroused the wise men in a foreign distant land to bring to His Son and His Son’s poor parents a present, which they needed quite sorely on their pilgrimage to Egypt. I said it was, therefore, a great honor to our congregation and orphanage for our gracious God in this circumstance to wish to liken us to His dear Son and to the pious Joseph and dear Mary and to arouse wise and pious people in Germany who have been right eager to send us many physical and spiritual gifts, which were distributed according to God’s gracious dispensation without forethought or purpose for our part on the notable day already mentioned. Finally we knelt down before the Lord’s countenance, praised God for every good thing rendered to the orphanage and to our congregation, and implored him in Christ’s name to reward richly, in this life and in the next, everything we have experienced.\n\nTuesday, the 19th of January. So far, this winter has been quite bearable and not nearly so cold as in previous years; hence, there are all sorts of green things growing in the garden. Yesterday all the men in the entire congregation began building a 300 foot long bridge, tall and durable, across a broad and deep little river and over the swampy tract around it. With it we will be able to go continually back and forth from the town and plantations. Today I visited it and found, to my pleasure, just what Mr. Vigera had told me yesterday, to wit, that the people were working with great success and in fine harmony, each working crew at its own directed place. The bridge from the town to the plantations is being built so broadly, stoutly, and competently that we can walk or go by horseback or conveyance on it throughout the entire year. Till now, at high water, we have had to ride the long path around to the plantations on horseback for a good hour. But in this way we will be able to go on this short road in a half hour to the plantations furthest down the Savannah River. This will not only turn out very convenient for the people’s going to church and doing other business in town but will also make us more useful to the people in carrying out our duties.\n\nThe largest pilings are driven in, then so-called cross-beams eight feet long are laid athwart them. On these cross-beams or joists rest the wide and long boards which are placed together as closely as boards in a floor of a room. Balustrades are being placed on both sides so that neither horse nor man can wander over the sides and fall off. The water in the stream and the adjacent bog is almost at its highest now; and, even if it should go a few feet higher, it will not rise over the bridge since we thought of this at the beginning because of our previous experience.\n\nAlthough it rained very heavily last night, the entire region from the town to the bridge and across the bridge to the plantations where our broad path is being cut is so dry that we cannot tell that it has rained. The broad path to the town goes through Landfelder’s plantation. He has had to give up some good land, and he complained about it to me yesterday. But I directed him to some men who would talk with him knowledgeably about the matter, by whom he was also mollified. For that I am willing to show him some favor. Likewise I wish to reward Rottenberger for so willingly giving up from his plantation all the wood we need for this important construction. Now the piles are being driven in by communal labor. As soon as the water is down and the swamps or boggy spots on the one side of the bridge are dried out, they will fasten the pilings to other timbers appropriate to stout bridges. At that point I will have to apply some of the money God grants the congregation or orphanage from time to time.\n\nWith the others I thank God for causing this long-desired bridge to progress so far and causing us to find such a suitable place for it that no other could be wished for. I think the present time is just the right time for this important construction: not only can the men best get away from their regular business but they have also been strengthened considerably by the 4th transport so that everything is proceeding all the more cheerfully and rapidly. These last people are quite industrious and untiring and steady at this labor, and thus they cause me and others much pleasure.\n\nThursday, the 21st of January. Pletter announced that his eldest little girl Elisabeth had died last night of epilepsy.21 He and his wife consoled themselves considerably in that in this child was so completely fulfilled what is present in the hymn: Wie wohl ist mir, o Freund der Seelen, wenn ich in deiner Liebe ruhe, etc. For this reason this hymn was very profitable to me and others at the burial. This makes the third little child to have died and been buried this year.22 May God teach us all to consider that we must die, so that we may become prudent.\n\nFriday, the 22nd of January. A captain and judge from Purysburg /Linder/ had received some of our medicine from Halle at his request. Now in reply he wrote me: “I will remain beholden to you forever, for the medicines we received. I can say with truth that God’s blessing is in everything they have sent me. Everything has taken effect immediately. I thank Your Reverence heartily for all such kindnesses,” etc.23\n\nBesides the blessed medicines from Halle by which, from the very beginning, the Lord has rendered us much good in our homes and in the congregation, we have had, since the arrival of the 4th transport, the infallible Berlin fever powder, which was sent to us in some quantity from Stuttgart. A man and a woman with quartan fever have already used it with good effect. It seems likely that the fever is thoroughly cured [as the description and directions for use of this powder say], and therefore not merely checked. Our people use such medicines that are sent to us thus all the more confidently, since they know that they reach us from the hands of our Fathers and patrons, who would not send them to us if they did not have sufficient proof of their goodness and caution.\n\nSaturday, the 23rd of January. Today our surveyor was observing the labor going on at the bridge and judged that a similar durable construction could not be finished in Charleston for less than 1000 £. of Carolina money, i.e., 142 £. 17 Sh. Sterl., and it will cost our treasury not more than 9 £. Sterl. Praise God for this right great benefaction! The said surveyor also sees that by and by our congregation will increase with inhabitants from new transports, and he therefore suggests we extend the terrain contiguous to the city as far as possible without harming other colonists in the country. In that way strange and possibly harmful people will not settle in our vicinity and take away the pasture land and other advantages. Once our town is occupied, then small villages and colonies can be set up in our district from the town, all dependent upon our town, as it is in and around Savannah. The suggestion pleases me and others highly, and I am thinking of proposing it very soon to the authorities.\n\nSunday, the 24th of January. Yesterday towards evening N.N. came to me and acknowledged his trespass and insolent conduct towards me and asked heartily and movingly for pardon. I would not have expected it from him, since his arrogant and self-righteous attitude is well known to me; hence I was all the happier when he came to me in these circumstances. He knows better now than previously that I have his interests in mind, and in physical matters too he has many proofs of my good intentions for him, which God has laid on his head like fiery coals and thus conquered his evil with good. Since our harvest and thanksgiving season God has begun to guide his mind, and from that time on he has begun to abandon his hate towards me and to come back to my sermons and prayer meetings. Since then God has very often placed materials concerning the intended texts in my heart and mouth in such a way that I believed at the time that his conscience would be touched by it, his inner character would be clearly portrayed, and he would be convinced that external things will not help him be saved unless inwardness, i.e., the new creature, were there. For he always sits directly before me, and therefore the miserable and perilous state of his soul has often given me the opportunity to prepare the application accordingly, without others’ being able to think that he alone is meant.\n\nI knelt down with him, and prayed to God about him. Giving him my hand, I assured him I heartily forgave him everything he had done which caused me sorrow. I admonished him to ask God in the name of Christ for pardon and to talk with me in the future according to his circumstances. He wishes to withdraw into complete tranquility. He thanks God for bringing him here and considers it a benefaction whenever I come to him and tell him his errors. His wife tearfully acknowledged her rudeness already some weeks ago and told me at the time that her husband was beginning to change, which I now hope will continue with divine mercy.\n\nMonday, the 25th of January. Today some people of the 4th transport were at my house talking with me about the condition of their souls. By their righteous acknowledgement and new good resolutions they gave me very good hope that they will surrender themselves sincerely to the Lord Jesus.\n\nTuesday, the 26th of January. Carl Flerl was married today to the widow Gruber. We hope that through this marriage God will bestow on the man not only an easing of his difficult household tasks but also much progress in his Christianity, for he is getting in her a true helpmeet. The tailor Christ has also long desired a change in his condition and has become engaged to the daughter of a tailor /Metzger/ from Purysburg. She has stayed at our place for quite some time in a quiet and Christian manner as a widow. This widow was weary of life in Purysburg and at her parents’ house; and because of that and in order to keep her three children in school here she asked permission to live amongst us, and now for that reason she will even marry here. The eldest little girl, very cheerful and clever, is frail and goes on her knees.24 Both the tailor Christ and the mother have appealed to me to take her into the orphanage, which will also be done.\n\nWednesday, the 27th of January. This has been, to be sure, a very tiring but also very pleasing day: God caused me to learn from the humble and heartfelt acknowledgement of a few new and old members that His word is resounding in their souls and that they are drawing near the Kingdom of God. He will carry out the good work He has begun so that they will become true participants in the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ. Those who are awakened but who have not made atonement for their dead works allow themselves to be shown how to postpone the use of Holy Communion rather than go to it to their harm, as happened aforetimes.\n\nOur dear Mr. N. may well have worries and concern for some colonists of the 4th transport, about whom he has only recently heard. However, perhaps he and others whom the Lord has used as instruments in this will receive much refreshment in return when they learn what a blessed change God is creating in such previously unconverted persons. Those are the real Magnalia Dei25 which God is performing in our days and to which we rightfully should pay more attention than to other adventures and external events in the world in times of war and peace. He is a lover of life and suffers even the most wicked with great patience so that He takes pity on them. Psalms 11:27. I am happy that the new people like being in Ebenezer so much, although there are many amongst them who would have it easier in other places in worldly matters.\n\nThursday, the 28th of January. A woman has brought a very bad name to us on account of her wicked behavior in another place. When she tearfully and vehemently accused herself at my house today and acknowledged herself to be the worst sinner who, in her sins, had lost practically all hope of salvation, I thought that by such acknowledgement she was referring to her vexatious behavior and base trespasses. But when I inquired, she attested by everything holy that she did not know herself to be guilty of such sins as people had attributed to her either in the place where she had stayed or on her journey; and with that she recounted to me all the things she had done in that connection, and whence the suspicion originated. I penetrated very deeply into her with God’s word; and, since she talked with me very honestly and intimately, and was very fearful of death and the seat of judgment of Christ, where all secret unforgiven sins will be punished, I abandoned my suspicions and will set straight others who have everything only on hearsay.\n\nHowever, she still seeks no justification because she knows nothing of the base things imputed to her; rather, God disclosed to her the horror of the other sins lying in her heart. Assuming she is sincere, I hope she will soon come to a belief in Christ. Necessity brings her to her knees, and now she is learning better to understand God’s word. Among other things she said, “I applied the verse ‘In the multitude of my thoughts,’ etc., to myself whenever the people said all kinds of things about me and I came into great trouble and woe. But now I feel another affliction, it comes from the awareness of sin,” etc.\n\nFriday, the 29th of January. The Klocker woman brought me a letter from her husband to be forwarded to Germany. She and her family cannot find words enough to extol the benefactions the Lord is showing them in Ebenezer. She would like to have a letter written to Senior Riesch, who was previously favorably disposed to her and her husband, thanking him for the fatherly love and faith he showed them. And she wanted simply to wish him blessings from God in recompense, and to inform him that everything was coming true that he had foretold them about Ebenezer. Since no time remains for writing him anything, we will do it in a few words here: “God bless him and Master Felss and other friends of Ebenezer many thousandfold for all their affection and intercessions.” She also told how much it had cost to get her oldest daughter away from the people in the Empire, and now she glorifies God who has ordained it so well. For He blesses the solitude and His word in her right noticeably so that she is becoming a virgin and bride of Christ. She said so many good things in great simplicity and honesty that we hestitate to report them.\n\nPeter Reiter has given his plantation over to Klocker, since he himself will be unable to work for at least a year because of his severe accident. The two of them made a very Christian contract, and after some time Klocker is getting half of the entire plantation, which is very fruitful, well situated, and nicely laid out. The children are going to Steiner’s school.\n\nA girl refreshed me today by means of the little verse: “O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me is thine help.” There are now right many remarkable and edifying things to enter into the diary. The Lord has certainly begun His work splendidly among the 4th transport, and what He already began in Germany through the labor of His servants is proceeding with blessing. Hallelujah!\n\nSaturday, the 30th of January. Our bridge is now completely built, and it causes great joy in the entire congregation because it is a major benefaction which the Lord has shown to our Ebenezer. It cost only 5 £. and 13 Sh. Sterl. besides what the side rails will cost, which eight men hope to finish in six days. These rails are indispensably necessary; for the bridge is 300 feet long and only wide enough for one large wagon to cross it or for one horse to turn around, and without such rails someone at night, especially children, or even in daytime horse, rider, and wagon could come to grief. Yesterday for the last time I took the long way to the plantations; and my horse, as always till now, had to swim through the water, while I had to go over a tree lying partly in the water. After I was through I thanked God for helping us conquer all difficulties and dangers till now and for granting us this great benefaction of the new bridge, upon which we have not much more than a half-hour on foot to the next plantation on the Savannah River and mill river. Even the people living at the utmost ends of the plantations are now a lot nearer the town than before, even if, because of the high water, they were obliged to take the middle way and not the long way. We have had to get along with difficulty long enough, and we now justly glorify the Lord who put it in the heads of the men in the congregation to devote one week of communal work to this needed construction. Our cash box will bear the remaining cost, which, we hope, will be refunded by the authorities.\n\nN.N. has now finished his six months’ service at N. and cannot find words to describe the mortal danger he was in, and how graciously the Lord looked upon his wretchedness, and his and others’ prayers for the sake of Christ, and how He finally indeed rescued him and brought him here again. Now Ebenezer is right dear to him, after experiencing many things in N. and N., whence he had to travel with his master. If the people believe his stories (there is not the slightest reason to doubt them), it is to be hoped that they will be given new cause to glorify God for the very special kindness He shows us here and to be well content with all that He lays upon us. Among other things he [N.] told Mr. Vigera that if he could earn 100 £. Sterl. every day in N. and only 1 pence in Ebenezer, he would rather be in Ebenezer than there, etc.\n\nSunday, the 31st of January. Today after the sermon I sought to rouse the entire congregation to the praise of God, while we sang: Lobet den Herrn, den mächtiqen König der Ehren, etc. Today eighty-two of us were at the Lord’s table. I believe with certainty that God has brought about much salvation through His word, which had been preached previously, and through this treasured sacrament of the body and blood of Christ Himself. Hallelujah!\n\nFEBRUARY\n\nMonday, the 1st of February 1742. Just as the Lord blessed the first month of this year according to His great mercy, He has already begun this day to bless the second month too. To the person who is the greatest sinner in his own eyes He displays the greatest mercy, hence He holds Himself bound to love that one most, for the one who is forgiven much also loves much. May the Lord cause us to savor the power of the Gospel ever more intensely! The Lord be praised for all He has done for us till now, we are surely not worthy of it! We are experiencing thoroughly what Jesus says in Chapter 5, “The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.” With this may the Holy Spirit help each of us in faith to draw this conclusion: if the prayer of a righteous person can achieve so much, what may not the prayer of the great High Priest, Jesus the Son of God, achieve, upon whose intercession and merit every prayer is based and hence is heard? Yea, verily, it is so! The faithful experience it well, and therefore say: “If God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?”\n\nIn the evening a man from the congregation was at my house. At my question he recounted how the Lord, our loving Jesus, had accepted his soul the previous day and had not let him spend the day without blessing. To be sure, it had seemed to him, he said, as if he would not have any blessing, but in the evening it had come. The song Du bist ja Jesu meine Freude, warum ist denn mein Herz betrübt came to his mind and refreshed him, so that he hoped it would be sung during the prayer hour. When this happened, it impressed him all the more so that he gained more trust and love in his Savior. It had been like that also at Christmastime, he said. He had taken no comfort from my sermon, but finally, when he prayed, he thought: “If I should see no comfort, I will refresh myself that I belong to Jesus.”\n\nTuesday, the 2nd of February. Today on the plantations I read aloud the very fine letter of the pious Salzburger from Ulm [Ruprecht Winter]. Our dear God again granted me great edification from it. I heard the same from a Salzburger after the prayer hour, and I believe others were edified by it also. For what comes from the heart goes to the heart. We can see how much the man is full of grace, and hence everything causes a deep impression. We see there how grace opens the heart and the mouth of a man. As long as a man is without grace, his mouth is closed; but if grace comes into his heart, then the mouth is opened.\n\nWhen I had come home again, I married the tailor Christ with the widow from Purysburg. First I sang: Jesu, deine heilige Wunden, etc., and with the help of the Holy Spirit I placed in their hearts: “For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in our body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.” 1 Corinthians 6:20. May the Lord bless it!\n\nWednesday, the 3rd of February. For Ernst’s medical treatment I was paid 9 £. Sterl. in Savannah on orders of General Oglethorpe. I was also promised that no one would establish a stock farm or plantation in our area, but that we could look on all land toward Abercorn and Old Ebenezer and back to Ogeechee as our own and as appertaining to our city. This assurance of the entire Council is as good to me as if the surveyor had already parceled out the land for us; and I am happy that it cannot be surveyed now because the people do not have time to assist the surveyor in his work. They are allowing us the 500 acres in the vicinity of the old sawmill with the stipulation that the proprietor or his heirs not return;1 meanwhile the Lord Trustees will make a decision. Other than they, we are the first in line, and they should not be awarded to anyone else. I requested a grant of 10 £ Sterling for our bridge, but they can do nothing until orders come from the Lord Trustees. A few years ago they began to build a bridge near Savannah which is said to have cost over 500 £. Sterling, and the road is now worse than it was before. I had a conversation with the preacher in Savannah in order to prevent a disorder which threatens to spread amongst the Germans.\n\nThursday, the 4th of February. This year we desired to begin planting wine grapes. But good vines are so rare in this country that neither in Savannah nor in Purysburg can we get cuttings without roots, unless a good friend gives us some. In the Lord Trustees’ large garden the grape vines are so skimpy and poor that they themselves can hardly believe it when it is written out for them, the more so when they know what the costs have been.\n\nTo be sure, a Jew who has moved to New York has a good supply of vines in two places, to wit, on his plantation and in the city; but no one has the authority to dispose of them, and it is guessed that he will return in awhile.2 In the meantime everything is being minded by a servant of the Lord Trustees at his expense. Since we can get no grape vines or even cuttings from the public garden now, some English acquaintances in Savannah have presented me with a few such cuttings as grew last summer, and we desire to have them planted here. Some time ago General Oglethorpe gave orders to his vintner on his barony at Palachocolas to deliver fifty such cuttings or cut branches to me, each a little more than a foot long, which will be cut next week. I have also brought a small olive tree along with a few cut branches from the Lord Trustees’ garden, and we will attempt to grow them here. Almost all tree twigs take root and proceed to grow if they are placed in the earth at the right time in spring.\n\nOf the thirty persons fetched to Charlestown to be taken to Saxe-Gotha, no more than two are said to be left, the others all having died either on the way or in Charlestown, although they had good physical care.3\n\nFriday, the 5th of February. The wheat sown at our place last autumn is standing so beautifully that we cannot look upon it here and there in the gardens without pleasure and praise of God. The people are highly encouraged to plant more European crops by and by, since the labor is not very great but the profit is greater than they could hope for with the local crops. I have been approached about taking the trouble to get spelt seeds [a very well-known and useful crop in a few corners of Germany]. We do not hear of anything similar in New York or Pennsylvania. Hence we will probably have to await these seeds from Germany, which we wish kindly to request herewith. Because we have a mill, we would be able to prepare the seeds quite easily for consumption by ourselves and others. For the past few years we have been going to some lengths to get hemp seeds, so far without success. Doubtless it would grow on the rich and moist lowland near the mill stream.\n\nThe surgeon, Mr. Mayer, still has no proper dwelling. As we had to do for a few years at the beginning, he manages with a well-secured hut, which is quite cold in winter, however, because one cannot place an oven in it. The people wish to have him in their vicinity on the plantations. For that reason Steiner is giving him a portion of his plantation, and very soon a stout and durable little house will be built in the section where the church is to be built. This plot lies practically in the center of the plantations and will be very convenient for him in all sorts of ways. The people have great love for and trust in him and will happily contribute according to their means whatever can serve his pleasure. If he takes his office seriously, as he has done so far, and is useful to the congregation and satisfied with little, I do not doubt that God by and by will cause something to devolve upon him for his subsistence.\n\nSunday, the 7th of February. Steiner is showing great industry and loyalty in the school on the plantations. He asked me, however, if he should continue it at the time when the field work is starting. He guessed that the parents would have to give some school money, for he is getting very little for his labors; since he would have to neglect part of his field work he would provide much too little for the maintenance of his family. However, in faith and trust in divine providence, I gave him the certain hope that we would pay him quarterly for his labors from the blessing which God in His time will grant. Perhaps God will show the worthy Court Chaplain Ziegenhagen a good opportunity to commend this loyal schoolmaster and his loyal work in the school on the plantations to the Lord Trustees or the most praiseworthy Society. 8 £. Sterling would fully support him.\n\nWe also lack a clear-sounding bell on the plantations for giving the signal to church and school, for which reason the children and adults sometimes come too early or too late. They cannot hear the horn at a distance; and, even if we wished to give the sound from a small cannon, as happened for awhile, a half pound of powder is required each time. Reckoned at 9 pence each, it comes to a very high sum. It is an easy thing for our dear God to grant a good bell to the plantations for this important purpose, as He has done in the town already.4 We deem it justly as a benefaction.\n\nMonday, the 8th of February. Yesterday we dealt with the Gospel for the Fifth Sunday after Epiphany concerning the hidden powers and works of Satan and read the introductory words of Luke 22:46 (cf. 31). Today God let me learn that He had blessed this utterance in a married couple so that they are recognizing more and more what Satan has in mind, and how they should properly meet his sly attacks in a manner consistent with the gospels. The more earnestly a person carries on his Christianity the more earnestly Satan strives to counteract it with his hidden powers and works. Mouth-Christians and seeming Christians know nothing of this, but true Christians are often laid low by it and believe they have fallen from God’s grace if they must feel internally and externally the power of evil as a vile weed.\n\nWe also admonished the audience about being sold tares in place of wheat by the Enemy.5 Quite many such deceived people will be found in eternity. How few learn to distinguish between nature and grace and hold many things for virtues which are only deceitful sins. Their lack of faith or dead faith, which consists only of empty knowledge, human approbation, and worldly, self-made trust is called true salutary faith, their accommodation to the world compromise, their silence in the face of everything evil intelligence, a few physical good works Christian love, and their worldly anger a good zeal, etc. God protect us and our parishioners from this and other kinds of self-deception!\n\nThe wind now pierces into the rooms so much that almost no heating helps. It seems to me that it has never been so cold by day or night as it is beginning to be at the start of this month of February. The best thing about it is that the fierce cold in this country lasts barely a few days and then changes into pleasant spring weather again.\n\nTuesday, the 9th of February. The tailor Metzger, whose daughter married the tailor Christ last week, asked me to take his 14-year-old son into the orphanage. He will give clothes to him, but he will have to earn his board by working in the orphanage. He is now accepted and is going to school; and if he learns to read well, he will go to preparation for Holy Communion. During the remaining time he can take off from school he assists the orphanage manager. Metzger’s abovementioned daughter has brought three unreared children by her previous husband to the tailor Christ. The oldest girl is 7, and frail, but otherwise very sprightly and capable; and, at her request and also to lighten her housework, she has been taken into the orphanage. Since we have so many proofs of divine providence at the orphanage, we do not refuse to come to the aid of poverty. We believe confidently that God will be able to multiply the little that is left in the cash box for the support of widows and orphans, just like the oil in the cruse and the meal in the barrel, so that we may see His splendor and glorify His name, 1 Kings 17:14, 2 Kings 4:1–7.\n\nWednesday, the 10th of February. A woman who had stolen a goose egg from her next-door neighbor more than a year ago and now bears a great deal on her conscience wishes everyone to believe that this sin, as a trespass of the divine commandment, is the most terrible matter, even if, through blindness caused by Satan and deception caused by her own heart, it had seemed to be a minor one. She brought four eggs in return, and would happily have acknowledged her duplicity towards the person whom it concerned and would have shamed herself before everyone if I had not dissuaded her for very good cause. This person is an enemy of the pious and also of this sorrow-bearing woman, and this confession would cause more evil than good; hence I took this matter into my own hands and will touch that other person’s conscience at this opportunity.\n\nThis woman is also burdened by something else: she finds herself full of sin and the abominations of youth and would happily cry out to God day and night in her spiritual torment. But, she says, she has a sick child and has to take care of it till the middle of the night to get it to sleep; and thus it happens that she is hindered in her prayers. Since she herself is frail, she says, she falls asleep with the child, and afterwards this causes her anguish, especially since she read in the 119th Psalm that David arose in the night and praised God. I told her by way of instruction that we have no specific commandment in Holy Scripture to pray to God on our knees in the morning or in the evening lest we suffer harm in our salvation.\n\nThe love she was showing her child in faith and obedience was, I said, an actual service to God, and the Lord heard her desire also to praise and worship on her knees the dear Father in the name of Jesus Christ. I told her that her heart could be certain that His ear was aware of it. I directed her to the prayer of Christ at the right hand of the Father and to the communion of saints and at the same time admonished her not to worry herself and agonize onesidedly about this or that thing, even if it were a sinful weakness, but to come through Christ to the reconciled Father and to pray and seek from Him in spiritual hunger and thirst those things she needed. She must rest not in her customary practices but only in the wounds and merits of Christ.\n\nI visited a man from the fourth transport named Cugel6 on his new plantation and found him and his wife very industrious at their work. He has received very good land upon which he has already built a hut and some out-buildings and has made a fine spot suitable for planting. They are both very content, and wish to report to their benefactors and friends as soon as they can about what God has done for them.\n\nThursday, the 11th of February. Yesterday the Landfelder woman brought a little daughter into the world, who was baptized today. The woman was very weak soon after the birth and desired my encouragement and prayer, which she was also provided. May God not begrudge her an even longer time of grace in which to put her house in proper order and to become certain of the grace of God in Christ so that she may die a blessed death. From her bed she offered me her hand several times, and it seemed as if many things were stirring in her conscience.\n\nMichael Rieser, her one-time neighbor, moved at the end of last week to his plantation below the mill. I visited him yesterday, and I feel that his attitude towards us is better formed now than formerly. I am still hoping he will convert righteously to the Lord.7\n\nA young man with business at my house told me that a piece of wood fell and struck Ott while he was at work building, leaving him all confused and with blood running out of his ears. Yesterday I had been at his plantation but had no opportunity to speak with him alone as I had intended, because he was helping his neighbor Bischoff [Henry Bishop] build a kitchen.\n\nThe above-mentioned man told me that with Ott’s accident the verse came to mind: “God is a righteous judge, and a God who daily threatens; if one will not convert, then he . . .,” etc. He said he had spoken with him some time ago on the way home from church and asked him how he felt about his fall from grace, a question he answered with tears but no further words. The other man showed him in holy scripture that if he would righteously convert, he would not be harmed for having been godless. But first he must disconnect himself from bad and frivolous company and seek the company of pious people, which he also wanted. But we have well seen that he has not been really serious about converting; and therefore God is earnestly following him. In church discipline we have proceeded with him in such a way that he has had no cause to complain about harshness and severity. Everything was so arranged that he and the others have had to recognize that we are seeking only the true salvation of his soul and that, in hope that we can set him right, we are using only as much gravity and severity as has been necessary to avert annoyance.\n\nFriday, the 12th of February. In a year’s time we hope to have enough grape vines to help many people establish vineyards. Our boat was supposed to bring me some more domestic vines from Savannah, but they remained behind through the fault of a man who was supposed to have them ready. The orphanage has had a large piece of field near the kitchen garden protected by a very stout fence, within which the manager will apply himself to all kinds of German crops. We will also see whether we can set up a vineyard here. We are only lacking people who can assist Kalcher. To build something with day laborers is too costly, and could not be supported for long.\n\nThe surveyor /Avery/ has now concluded his work with the 4th transport and otherwise in the congregation; and after he receives his certificate from me today, he is looking for an opportunity to go to Purysburg. Amongst us he has been a quite orderly person and has done us good service, and for this reason I will mention him in a most complimentary manner in my letter to the authorities and General Oglethorpe. He has shown me a sketch consisting of all the estates on the Savannah River in Georgia and Carolina, similarly on other rivers in Carolina and around Frederica. I should like to have it, as it may be of service to our friends and benefactors in Europe. But, because he is justifiably asking a good reward for his trouble and we cannot give him anything like it, I will ask General Oglethorpe to help us in the matter. He knows the man’s work and knows that it is accurate and dependable.8\n\nSaturday, the 13th of February. Ruprecht Zittrauer has been dangerously ill; but God has helped him up again, and he recognizes this to be a great act of grace of the Lord and to belong to the realm of His kindness, patience, and forebearance. For he said that, if he had died this time, he would have gone badly, because he had been contemptuous of the grace God had offered so far. His intentions now are very good, and we will see whether he will follow the admonitions given him privately and publicly.\n\nAn unmarried woman was at my house because of her soul’s circumstances. She lamented bitterly about the sins of her youth, and her only wish was that she might soon be able to say: “I obtained mercy,” since she must now say that she is the greatest amongst sinners. She complained that unprofitable gossip had done her much harm and had displaced the good she had heard, hence she longed for tranquility. She also asked me to allow her on Sundays, when she came in from the plantation for services, to remain in my house quietly and to join others in prayer.\n\nSunday, the 14th of February. Today the parishioners were instructed how they are serving through Christ even in the most lowly appearing occupation. I said for every labor scorned by the world, if done from the heart to God’s glory and for the love of their neighbor, they would receive from the Lord’s hand a reward in grace; today’s gospel on the laborers in the vineyard gave us a fine opportunity to speak of it. We had as an exordium Colossians 3:23, 24 and discussed the gospel of the Christians as servants of Christ, and looked upon 1) their service, and 2) their reward of grace.\n\nMonday, the 15th of February. A boy from Old Ebenezer told me how great damage occurred around noontime when the people were at their meal, when a great part of the fence within which the Lord Trustees’ cattle are being kept rapidly burned down. Now is the time when the dry grass is ignited along with other easily flammable items, and at that point harm may easily occur if care is not taken. A few days ago a large portion offence here too caught on fire unexpectedly, near the gardens not too far from the town, and very little was left to put out. There was no water nearby, and we put the fire out only with earth or by tearing out the fence adjacent to it, so that the fire could reach no further. The orphanage plans to have a long-lasting fence built around a large field which was cleared of trees and bushes at my own expense some years before so that this year we could plant some corn, beans, and other things for the support of the widows and orphans and also try one or another German crop. We can hardly sow the German crops thin enough to keep them from becoming too thick, especially where the soil is rich. A single kernel turns into a big bush with green stem and leaves.\n\nA smith from Purysburg was reported to me, and came to me personally to present to me his physical poverty with the request that he be allowed to beg some corn from the congregation for himself and his wife and children. He has lost all his cattle and one horse to sickness, and the wolves got his pigs. Because of lack of rain he has gotten no crops in the field, and he will have to starve if no one will come to his aid. He recounted that much heavy rain had fallen on his neighbor’s land in the summer, but on his own plot the sun had burned everything up. He said the rain which had brought crops to others had stopped right at his fence. He recognized that his knowledge of Scripture and other worldly comforts would not have helped him to salvation in the presence of an unconverted heart. His manner of speaking and his confession please me a good deal, and I believe they come from his heart. He attended the evening prayer hour Saturday and the divine services Sunday, and I see well that he longs for Ebenezer, although in previous times it was disparaged by other people to him and his wife. They had prided themselves very much on imagined merits consisting only of worldly freedom and insolence. He described the bulk of the people in N. in such a way that I was horrified. I supplied this impoverished man with three bushels of corn which, along with the perceived Word of God, made a good impression on him.\n\nTuesday, the 16th of February. Just as we were refreshed in so many ways last month, our miraculous God who makes everything good is leading us this month into many tribulations. One important test is the seemingly dangerous illness of my dear colleague. He has been lying for some days in a great fever and is at times delirious, and various aspects of this illness appear to me right alarming, although Mr. Thilo still has good hope at this time for his recovery because the dear patient is following his prescribed diet and taking his medicines. May the dear Lord hear our prayer for him and send him back to us sound. After it has been withstood, this illness will, through God’s grace, turn to much good for him and me and especially serve to bind our hearts closer in love so that mutually we may seek to carry on the work of the Lord more and more fervently. We only recognize what a true colleague God has sent us when He seems to be taking him away from us. Here also we say: “Commit thy way unto the Lord; . . . and He shall bring it to pass.” Oh, yes, may He do in this matter according to His wisdom, mercy, and omnipotence what will enable us to glorify Him!\n\nThe schoolmaster too has been unable to hold school for two weeks because of great loss of strength. I have offered to have Kocher take his place for that period, and to compensate him somewhat for it. But because the schoolmaster would not look upon it kindly, I have let it go in order not to bring him vexation and unnecessary worry in his weak condition. This evening he sent word to me that he wishes to begin school again tomorrow in his house.\n\nChristian Riedelsperger and Schmidt, two very honest men, have also become violently ill, and we do not see how things will turn out with their illness. Here too we say: “May the Lord’s will be done.”\n\nScheraus, a fine man from the 4th transport, cut a dangerous wound in his foot. The surgeon, Mr. Mayer, went to Savannah yesterday; and, because Mr. Thilo had traveled along with me this morning to Schmidt’s plantation and came home only around one o’clock, the man had to lie unbandaged for that period of time. A few days ago I visited this Scheraus and his neighbor Scheffler on their plantations on the Ebenezer River. The two were occupied cutting down trees in great cheerfulness and pleasure. They asked me where I was now, and as the question appeared strange to me, they said: “In the Valley of Joy,” for they both had, they said, great joy in this country and labored with joy. I let them keep the name, but thought to myself it might better be called “Valley of Misery,” into which things have all too soon changed, as it goes in this wretched, miserable world. May God hold further His hand over us and let us experience His kindness forever, and for Christ’s sake not deal with us according to our sins, and not recompense us according to our misdeeds!\n\nWednesday, the 17th of February. Yesterday evening I received from General Oglethorpe a very friendly letter in which he very kindly invited Mr. Vigera, whom I had mentioned in my last letter, to Frederica in order to become acquainted with him. He also sent me a bill of exchange for 40 £. Sterling to buy horses for several men. These men are to reconnoiter our district and expel undesirable rabble, or else in case of need to carry out some tasks useful to our country, for which they will receive a small monthly payment. General Oglethorpe also reported that a certain captain and Indian trader above Palachocolas had promised him to put one of his children by an Indian woman in our school; and, because this child has a very good grasp of the Uchee Indian language, it may be the general’s purpose for someone to learn something of this language from the child, so that by and by other Indian children may be enticed into the school. It chanced that just today this captain came to my house at noon. I asked him about the matter and found out that his sending his child here was not in the offing, and in the end probably nothing would come of it. The man stands very high in General Oglethorpe’s estimation because he is looked up to by the Indians and can bring profit or harm through them.9\n\nThursday, the 18th of February. Yesterday evening Mr. Vigera came back again from Savannah with his traveling companions. Because the oarsmen were weak, the boat could come no further than the mill; and it will be fetched thence today. He now sees from his own experience how hard it is for us and how expensive it is when we must travel back and forth so often because of the needs of the congregation. How good it would be if the Lord Trustees would put out a sum of money and employ conscientious people to complete a main road from Savannah to Old Ebenezer so that people could travel back and forth rapidly and at little cost and difficulty. Perhaps when I report to General Oglethorpe the quality and uncommon usefulness of our bridge, something of the necessity and usefulness of other bridges to be built will be described and suggested. In Carolina all planters are bound to report six days each year to repair roads, and white people and Negroes must labor under certain assigned officers. But it is done, especially in the Purysburg region, so very badly and factiously that little is accomplished.\n\nI visited families on the plantations and had occasion to talk about various things for the edification of the adults and children, and after that there was also some prayer. We see the people working earnestly on their plantations, and more would be done if only the water were not always so high and did not inundate the land, which is called the Savannah Swamps.10\n\nFriday, the 19th of February. Before the edification hour on the plantations I called on the frail Peter Reiter. This time my visit was especially well suited for him since he had been longing for me for several days to share a word of comfort and instruction with him. It is going with him as it goes with others who are serious about their Christianity and salvation. His entire Christianity is displeasing to him, and much appears to him to be hypocrisy; and he believes that he will therefore progress no further and God will not accept him. Old sins are still always occurring to him, which disheartens him. Also, someone told him that he was talking and acting better than in previous times only to please people. But whoever has a spiritual countenance and pays heed to the whole tenorem vitae praesentis11 and compares the present with the past will soon find that God has worked a true change of attitude in him and that he has been born again through the Holy Spirit. He detests inwardly and rues with pain the old paths of sin, and he struggles against all evil desires, crucifies the flesh with its occupations, and seeks refuge in the blood and wounds of Christ. As he previously judged the Christianity and customs of others, now others judge him similarly; and he knows well they can do no differently because of the blindness of their hearts. I edified him and myself from the wonderful hymn: “Prange Welt mit deinem Wissen,” etc.\n\nAfter the edification hour N.N. had me called to him, and I found him on his sickbed in a violent fever. He lamented very fearfully that he had spent his previous time of grace so badly and had offended us his ministers with his bad attitude and hypocrisy. He now wishes honestly to convert to Christ through the grace of God and to become a new man, if God will prolong his life. I held up to him his oft-made promise to convert and also his unfaithfulness; and I told him something of the little verse: “Behold, that is the lamb of God, which beareth the sins of the world,” etc. and prayed with him and his new wife.\n\nAt his request, Mr. Mayer brought him some medications, and in general, as surgeon and physician, he takes care right loyally and with good effect of the patients who request his assistance. The fact that this dear man came to us with the 4th transport belongs amongst the benefactions which the Lord has shown our congregation. He has provided himself with various selected medicines for all sorts of contingencies, and what he did not bring along, he proposes to prepare himself from the herbs and roots which the gracious Creator causes to grow here, which is something we have long desired, and have said so. He is skilled, and does not seek to hide his talent in a handkerchief, rather to apply it to the honor of God and to the service of his neighbor. We are taking pains to be of assistance in getting him a dwelling in which he will be able to work at his chemistry and other things useful to his purposes.\n\nSaturday, the 20th of February. The Burgsteiners’ recently born and baptized little daughter died of epilepsy. The parents are glorifying the Lord who brought her out of unrest and misery to rest and complete bliss.\n\nSunday, the 21st of February. Since yesterday things have improved noticeably with my dear colleague. After the fever diminished (which till now was great), he felt quite spent; and for that reason he had to lie in bed today, too. I also noticed yesterday a few inklings of fever in myself, and this morning before the divine services I felt somewhat exhausted. Nonetheless, the Lord, who knows our circumstances intimately, knew how to strengthen me during the fore- and afternoon recitation of His word, so that I was amazed at His paternal care and had to glorify Him fairly for it.\n\nThe tailor Metzger from Purysburg sought to have me let his eldest son marry here and establish a domicile. He cited a few disorders in Purysburg and Carolina as the cause which moved him not to remain there but rather to seek to reside in Ebenezer. The otherwise celebrated Carolina freedoms are already becoming a burden to many unconverted people; and we can see without difficulty that they redound to the people’s harm in body and soul. I told the father that I wished his son to become a true Christian before considering marriage, for to be the wife’s guide and therefore a leader, caring for both his own and other souls at once, has more to it than artless people recognize and believe. He will send him to me so that I may talk with him.\n\nMonday, the 22nd of February. Old Kieffer from Purysburg, who had come to us on Saturday, rode home again this morning. He took a long letter for me to the already often mentioned honest Englishman Mr. Bryan.12 In it I inquire whether we can obtain good horses and cows from him or through his management. We do not like buying them in this colony or above Palachocolas because we have to be careful that horses and cattle do not run back to their old pastures as soon as they can, if we buy them in the vicinity. Many Englishmen who earn their livelihood in trade with the Indians buy horses from them for a trifle.\n\nThe Indians rustle them near Frederica or in Carolina, and if someone buys that kind of horses, either the Indians themselves or the owners fetch them back; and harm and inconvenience is generated on all sides. Moreover, we do not like involving ourselves in complaints and lawsuits before the authorities. One would not get far because most of them have no qualms about lying and deceiving, nor even about swearing oaths, for the sake of profit and selfish gain. Because at this time we can contribute nothing to winning over the Indians, we hold it as an example of God’s love that so few Indians come to us. We are also spared from other loose folk, and we live in such quiet and solitude that Ebenezer might be the only place in this colony. Praise God for all His kindnesses!\n\nN.N. took his daughter to the plantation three weeks ago.13 Married to N., she had been ill here with homesickness. N.N. promised me today, however, to send her back to her husband in a few days. This marriage took place in a very perverted manner, with too much excessive urging from the parents and all kinds of sin on both sides. It is therefore no wonder that in their marriage till now there have occurred many perversions which have upset and saddened others, Jeremiah 12:13. The father recounted to me that his daughter had been so perilously ill that she was also fearful that she would die and perish in her sins. Several times I have given N. salutary advice from God’s word and lectured her in the presence and absence of her husband; but there is great inconstancy there, and the two are falling deeper and deeper into it.\n\nI now have another couple in mind with whom I have many sorts of things to accomplish, who made their betrothal and marriage vows not with God, but rather from desires of the flesh and sinful emotional conditions, of which no one but the all-seeing eye of God knew anything. In the meantime God has levied many judgments, especially on the husband, who had the most grace and recognition of God, and now the two are wound up so deeply in it that I do not see how it will turn out, but I fear even greater judgments. These people never would have thought that their mischief could come to my attention, but I see now to my utter astonishment how holy, just, and wise a God God is, and that He does not let the prayer of His servants and children go unheard.\n\nTill now the woman could not be persuaded of her godless demeanor, hypocrisy, and incompetence to take Holy Communion. Now it has come to the point that she cannot request this Holy Communion until there are enough tokens of true penance in her. In intercourse with ourselves and others she has done (though only to her harm) as is found in Joshua 5:20, 21; and, unfortunately, I must apply to her what we read, yesterday from Deuteronomy 9:24: “Ye have been rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew you.”\n\nHäsler, from Salzburg,14 is gladdened greatly that our dear Lord inspired an unknown benefactor in Wurttemberg to send a few ells of cloth and lining and everything else necessary for complete clothing to a poor person in the congregation. This great benefaction came to him, who had long hoped that our dear God would grant him an overcoat at such time as He recognized to be best. He wished the worthy donor God’s blessing in compensation, and bade me express thanks lovingly and heartily in his name.\n\nTuesday, the 23rd of February. Ruprecht Zittrauer has got some relief from his sickness; and he assured me today many times by word and deed that he wished, by the grace of Jesus Christ, to convert to God and become an honest Christian. I directed him to God’s word and prayer, in which, I said, he would have to renew earnestly his good intention often, otherwise it would come to nothing sooner than he got up from his sick bed. I told him he should not put off his good intention until after he was healthy again, rather now, now that God was working powerfully on him to have his heart drawn to Jesus and to have him offer himself up to Him, body and soul. The Kraus woman was with him, earnestly and powerfully exhorting him in her simplicity. I also learned that Eischberger and Peter Reiter were assiduously consoling him, although the latter has to limp to him some distance on crutches. I recommended to him that after prayer he have the story of the passion read to him item by item, so that he might be able to recognize the loathsomeness of sin and the great love of the Lord towards the loathsome sinners and miscreants (and therefore towards him).\n\nThe shoemaker Ade is thinking of becoming a neighbor of this Zittrauer and, for this reason, of buying a third of the plantation. He believes he will get on better with his household if he has a piece of field already fenced in at home and can plant it with his wife’s help. Whatever difficult work he himself cannot do he will have done by those who would prefer to pay him for their shoes with labor rather than with money. Zittrauer has become quite poor, for which he can thank partly his and his wife’s disorderly household; and he will find an improvement in it if, by means of the divine word, he causes a good basis for penance to be placed within him. In this poverty it would be quite good for him to receive a little money for the third part of his plantation, which the shoemaker is ready to pay. This man Ade some time ago went through such a change that he is no longer the man he was, and God has also in fact accomplished the important effect of conversion in him. Because he keeps diligently to God’s word and therein prays earnestly, I am quite hopeful that he will come further and further in his Christianity and that, by means of Christian exhortation, recitation, and good example, he will be profitable to the above-mentioned Zittrauer, whose neighbor he will become.\n\nWednesday, the 24th of February. Today we married Johann Georg Held to the widow Künlin. Heretofore the man was a servant in the orphanage and allowed himself to be persuaded to go off to St. Augustine as a soldier. After he had learned humility, obedience, and contentment, and had come from there hardly half alive, he desired once more to be accepted into our place, for which I had no strong inclination. Nonetheless, some heads of families on the plantations took him on as a cowherd, after his many requests and good promises. Because he honestly improved himself, and displayed loyalty in his physically tiring occupation, he gained his freedom and simultaneously a good plantation on the mill creek, on which he has already done some labor with pleasure and joy.\n\nNow it has chanced that he has received the Künlin woman, an honest and industrious worker, as helpmeet; and I do not doubt that, if the two of them carry on their occupation in the fear of God, all the good wishes showered on them at the nuptials and afterwards at the wedding feast will be powerful and fruitful ones. Mr. Vigera, who along with Mr. /Ludwig/ Mayer was invited to the wedding, rejoiced heartily at the simple, edifying manner in which we hold our weddings (they are arranged only according to God’s word and aim at mutual edification). Everything amongst us pleases him very much, and he glorifies the Lord for his good guidance. We are very glad the Lord has led him to us and has effected in the hearts of the parishioners an honest love for him and Mr. Mayer, which also serves and will serve to facilitate our external affairs. He sees everything that has happened and is happening amongst us with a Christian eye. He recognizes God’s work amongst us very well, to his joy, and will attest thereto in writing, to the praise of our kindly God and to the pleasure of our friends and benefactors. He was with me today in the company of Mr. Mayer, Kalcher, and Kogler in Old Ebenezer, to look for himself at the spot of our previous pilgrimage and sojourn. The great field which the Salzburgers had cleared of trees and bushes with great pains through communal labor and had preserved with a good fence, is being used to best advantage by the present Englishman and the German family /Schwarzwälder/. Nonetheless, the soil is so poor that they could grow no crops on it if they could not improve it with [the manure from] the Lord Trustees’ cattle.\n\nOur current Ebenezer becomes dear to us anew whenever we come from Old Ebenezer, as it were from the darkness into the light, and we cannot marvel enough at what the Lord has done, since our removal from there to here, to the town and to the plantations. Our memorial and thanksgiving celebration is now drawing near, and it is utterly dear and salutary to me that our previous and current circumstances are coming once more fresh into our minds: the works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein. Our children’s task was to learn the 103rd Psalm by heart, which will be recited at the above-mentioned ceremony in remembrance of the many spiritual and physical benefits God has rendered this year to young and old.\n\nThursday, the 25th of February. It seemed as if our miraculous, all-redressing God, after our joy of the previous month, has sent us this month a cup of woe, but it only seemed thus because He has placed much matter for His praise and for joy among us into our hearts and mouths. My dear colleague is improving daily, and so are Riedelsperger, Hans Schmidt, and Scheraus. A few men, after using some medications, have completely lost their quartan fever and are able to labor unhindered.\n\nIt appeared as if we would get no church on the plantations this spring because the chief carpenter, "
