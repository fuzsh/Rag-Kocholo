Some sleuthing seems to indicate that Stanley Rosenschein <- Aravind Joshi <-Zellig Harris; from him the database picks back up. Notable ancestors through this line are Leibniz, Huygens, and Mersenne.\n\nAs a means of both procrastinating as well as motivating myself for the final rigors of preparing and defending my dissertation, I decided to spend some time at the Mathematics Geneaology Project investigating my academic lineage. My thesis advisor is Michael L. Littman, so that is where I started. (Unbeknownst to myself at the time of application to Ph.D. programs, my master’s advisor Bill Smart has the exact same lineage.) I did some searching by hand, but it turned up some crazy results so I wanted to find a tool to harvest the family tree to make sure I didn’t introduce errors somehow. I found the Mathematics Genealogy Grapher which has a python application that does the job. The output of the script is below.\n\nNotable anscestors are:\n\nPhilipp Melanchthon a prominent figure in the protestant reformation\n\nJohann Reuchlin a scholar of Hebrew and Rabbinic writing who defended the Jews at great personal cost during the inquisition\n\nFranciscus Sylvius invented gin, first academic chemistry lab, discovered sylvian fissure (although these seem to be attributed to a few people)\n\nGabriele Falloppio you should be able to guess what he discovered\n\nErasmus\n\nCalvin\n\nHelmholtz\n\nCopernicus\n\nAlso, there is Friedrich Leibniz, who I was crazy excited about, but it turns out he is the father of the famous Leibniz…"
