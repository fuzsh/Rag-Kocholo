The document is entitled Christifideles laici, which translates as “Lay Members of Christ’s Faithful People.” It was published on a symbolic date, December 30, 1988, which was the Feast of the Holy Family of Jesus, Mary and Joseph. This subject guide includes several books which involve that document, as well as a web-link to the entire document, via the Vatican website.\n\nContents\n\nGeneral Texts about Christian Vocations\n\nWeb-based / Internet Resources\n\nGeneral Texts about Christian Vocations\n\nCatholic Church.

Theological Bibliography\n\nFrom the website: The Bibliographies for Theology is a monumental work compiled over many years of study by William Harmless, S.J. The bibliographies had been updated before his untimely death on October 14, 2014 and are preserved here to honor and memorialize his work. They are for the use of scholars and students alike. His brief introduction to the bibliographies follows:\n\n“For many years, I’ve tried to help my students make use of the best and the most current scholarly texts in theology. To aid research, I’ve posted here an extensive set of bibliographies in the areas of biblical, historical, sacramental, and systematic theology. Each bibliography contains various subheadings, and under each subheading, I single out one or two books that I recommend starting with. I give a brief review of these selected books, highlighting their strengths (and, on occasion, weaknesses or biases).”\n\n– William Harmless S.J.\n\nEcumenism Bibliography\n\nAmerican Church Records Series\n\nMount Angel Abbey Library is a charter subscriber to the American Church Records Series compiled by A.T.

Icons are described as “the Gospel in line and color,” a depiction of the Incarnate Word. The close association of word and image is brought out as iconographers refer to their work as being written rather than painted. In the words of Theodore of Studios (759-826 A.D.), “his [Christ’s] image was drawn in writing by the apostles and has been preserved up to the present. Whatever is marked there with paper and ink, the same is marked on the icon with various pigments or some other material. For the great [Saint] Basil says ‘whatever the words of the narrative offer, the picture silently shows by imitation.’ Hearing is equal to sight, and it is necessary to use both.”\n\nIn Behold the Beauty of the Lord, Henri Nouwen says “icons…are created for the sole purpose of offering access, through the gate of the visible, to the mystery of the invisible.” “This entry into the world of icons can at the same time be an entry into our own interior life, a passing through the ‘narrow gate’ that leads to Life” writes John Baggley in Doors of Perception.\n\nFollowing is a partial list of the many books on the subject in the library’s collection, with an emphasis on Byzantine iconography. Among the most recent books, those published since 2000, this list includes a number of “oversize” books, which have excellent quality and relatively large images of icons.\n\nFor additional listings do a subject search in the online catalog for\n\nIconography\n\nChristian Art\n\nSaints — Art\n\nBooks on Iconography\n\nAbu Qurrah, Thawdhurus.

Christian monasticism is generally regarded as a way of life involving persons living in seclusion from the world, under religious vows and subject to a fixed rule. Medieval monasticism had its roots in two distinct types of ascetic life practiced by Christians in early fourth century Egypt. The first type was the eremetical life of the desert hermits, whose most famous practitioner was St. Anthony. The other type was the cenobitical life of monks who lived together in organized communities, whose founder was said to be St. Pachomius. The monastic traditions of Egypt began to be known in the West beginning in the late fourth century, as literature about the lives of the desert fathers was disseminated, and individual monks traveled to and settled in Europe.\n\nDuring the fifth and sixth centuries, monasteries were founded in Italy, Gaul, Spain, and Ireland. In Gaul, and later, England, double monasteries were common. These were establishments of monks and nuns who lived in separate quarters under the direction of an abbess. During this early stage of monastic development, there was no generally accepted rule that governed monastic life. In the West there were translations of various Eastern codes, such as the Rules of Pachomius and Basil. Another influential rule was St. Augustine’s famous letter on the management of convents of nuns. However, there was nothing that could be called a working code for the management of a monastery. This changed in the eighth century with the widespread adoption of the Rule of St. Benedict.\n\nBenedict of Nursia was born near Spoleto, Italy, around the year 480. As a young man he lived as a hermit near the town of Subiaco, and his reputation for holiness was such that the monks of a nearby monastery asked him to become their abbot. Benedict’s first attempt at communal monastic living cannot be considered a success, since his fellow monks resented his strict rules and tried to poison him! He returned to Subiaco, and eventually founded his own monastery at Montecassino.\n\nIt was at Montecassino that Benedict composed his Rule for living in monastic communities. He envisioned the monastery as a reclusive and self-sufficient community, directed by an elected abbot. To lessen dependence on the secular word, the Rule decreed that everything essential for life, such as water, mills, gardens, and workshops, be found within the monastery walls. The church was always the most prominent building, and other buildings contained large rooms such as refectories and dormitories that reflected the group nature of monastic living. Benedict’s Rule emphasized the value of communal religious life, and outlined how a monk’s day was to be filled with prayer, manual labor and spiritual reading.\n\nA monk’s day began with the ringing of bells, some time between midnight and two a.m., signaling the first prayers of the day. After a short nap, prayers were again held at sunrise, and then at three-hour intervals throughout the day. Communal prayers averaged about five hours per day, while private prayer and contemplation could take up to four more hours. Meals were served once a day in winter, twice in summer, with meat forbidden except in case of illness. Monks were required to be silent while eating, and developed a sign language to communicate. At least three hours per day were spent in manual labor, with remaining hours not spent in prayer devoted to study, especially of Latin, and sacred reading.\n\nDuring the medieval period, monasteries were the centers of knowledge and education. They maintained schools and libraries, and were responsible for copying manuscripts. And although monasteries were founded with the idea of withdrawal from monastic life, they became a major force in the secular world of agriculture and government. They generally were founded by wealthy feudal lords, who then appointed their sons and daughters abbots and abbesses. (Monasteries were a convenient place to send second sons, who might become overly ambitious and seek to displace the oldest son in feudal succession. They were also useful refuges for daughters unable to find noble husbands.) Many monasteries became wealthy estates, with large land holdings that employed thousands of workers. Thus, the abbot or abbess of a large monastery could wield great secular power.\n\nBy the eleventh century, there began to be widespread dissatisfaction with the wealth and power the monasteries possessed. Several new monastic orders arose, inspired by the lives of the desert fathers and the Apostolic brotherhood, as well as the Benedictine rule itself. They sought a simpler form of religious life, with less dependence on the rents, serfs, and churches that provided income for the large monastic estates. The Carthusian and Cistercian Orders were the most prominent movements to arise from this reform.\n\nThe age of great monastic endowments was over by the end of the thirteenth century. In many Benedictine monasteries numbers declined, in part because of the end of the practice of donating children to be brought up as monks. Alternative forms of religious life, such as that of the friars, began to proliferate. Also, many monasteries, especially in Germany, refused to accept postulants that were not of noble birth, drastically limiting the number of potential recruits. In the latter part of the Middle Ages, a more relaxed form of Benedictine life was adopted and was acknowledged as valid by Pope Benedict XII in 1336. The age of Luther and the Reformation caused a precipitous decline in monastic vocations, and it wasn’t until the reform movements of the nineteenth century that monastic life began its revival.\n\nSources\n\nCantor, Norman F.

From then on, he worked at his demanding craft with great fidelity, producing six highly regarded novels and three volumes of philosophical essays.\n\nPercy’s medical specialty was pathology. He became a pathologist of modern and post-modern culture. Like Kierkegaard, he found the people around him to be in despair without knowing it. His novels explore what it means to confront this despair and to seek a way out of it. In the end Percy was convinced that the only sure path out of the morass was to embrace the Christian (and specifically the Catholic) faith.\n\nPercy was the scion of a very old and honorable Southern family who had left their distinguished mark on the delta region of Mississippi. Both his father and grandfather committed suicide, and his mother was drowned in a car accident when Walter was still a schoolboy. After that Walter was brought up by his Uncle Will, a lapsed Catholic who lived the Southern gentleman’s creed of Stoicism and honor. Uncle Will was also a very serious reader, who welcomed many famous and not so famous artists and writers to his home. Percy’s father had read aloud to his sons, and Uncle Will continued the practice.\n\nAll his life Walker was a shy person who need a great deal of time by himself with his thoughts and his pen. Although his strong faith warded off the family melancholy, he was moody. At two crucial points in his life, it was a trip to the wide open spaces of the West which helped call him back from the brink of despair.\n\nWalker Percy and his wife Bunt, and their two daughters, the first adopted, the second deaf, were a very close and loving family. They chose to live most of their lives in the town of Covington, across the lake from New Orleans and near St. Joseph’s Abbey, where Percy was buried. Percy’s wide circle of relatives and friends included his childhood pal, Shelby Foote, novelist and author of an acclaimed three-volume history of the Civil War, and Robert Cole, the Harvard psychiatrist.\n\nAll of Percy’s writings are permeated by his faith. His primary quarrel was with scientism, the view that science held the key to human happiness. He was not sure that happiness was something one should hope for or expect in this life, and he was sure that science could not provide it. He wrestled all his life with melancholic inheritance and with the Southern code of honor, particularly as these were embodied in his father and uncle respectively. He might easily have shared Cormac McCarthy’s apparent nihilism, had it not been for his religious faith. He championed liberal causes, but denounced liberal ideology.\n\nPercy was fascinated with the nature of language. He felt that it was a socially given capacity, without which one could not think the real. His explorations into semiotics were enriched both by his devoted efforts to teach his hearing-impaired daughter to read and by some studies he did on communication in the families of schizophrenics for a friend in the National Institute for Mental Health.\n\nPercy won many awards for his novels. He was certainly one of the best American novelists of the second half of the twentieth century, but it is not clear that his works will become an enduring part of the canon. About his philosophical essays there is even less certainty.\n\nWalker Percy has been well-served by secondary works. One of the most comprehensive (it critiques not only Walker Percy’s works but the existing works about him) studies of Percy is the biography of Jay Tolson."
