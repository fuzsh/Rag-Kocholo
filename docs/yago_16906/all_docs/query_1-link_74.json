Every member <strong>of</strong> the <strong>Fairfield</strong> <strong>University</strong> community has been impacted in ways both large and small. However, in spite <strong>of</strong> the turmoil, <strong>Fairfield</strong>’s supporters have done what they do best — they have stepped up and have continued to demonstrate how much <strong>Fairfield</strong> means to them. This spirit <strong>of</strong> generosity is at the core <strong>of</strong> what a Jesuit education is all about. Many <strong>of</strong> our alumni, parents and friends found themselves financially stretched this year, yet over 5,500 people gave what they could in support <strong>of</strong> the Annual Fund, one <strong>of</strong> <strong>Fairfield</strong>’s most important initiatives. Donors supported many areas <strong>of</strong> the <strong>University</strong>, contributing nearly $9 million in total over the course <strong>of</strong> the fiscal year (July 1, 2008 – June 30, 2009), including $3.4 million to the <strong>University</strong>’s endowment. Many sacrifices were made on behalf <strong>of</strong> <strong>Fairfield</strong> this year, and on behalf <strong>of</strong> the entire community, I wish to express my appreciation to each and every person listed in the pages to follow. As you read this year’s Honor Roll <strong>of</strong> Giving, I hope you will be as inspired as I am by the outpouring <strong>of</strong> support shown to the <strong>University</strong> and that you will join me in contributing to an even brighter picture in the years to come. Sincerely, Jack L. Kelly ’67, P’96 <strong>University</strong> Trustee Chair, Advancement Committee"
