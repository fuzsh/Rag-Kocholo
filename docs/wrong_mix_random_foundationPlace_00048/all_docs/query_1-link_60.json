Rural Infrastructure People in rural areas often live in huts built from materials like grass or mud, which stand up poorly to harsh weather and other environmental conditions. To make matters worse, these houses are frequently overcrowded; 45% of the people inhabiting rural areasinAndhraPradeshliveinone-roomhouses,eventhoughmostofthemhouseuptothreegenerationsatonce.

In rural areas where agriculture is the main source of income, people face high risk and low returns. Maintaining agricultural production is difficult in this region due to severalfactors,includingoutdatedagriculturalpractices,degradedsoilsandlackofmoistureconservationmeasures. In 1987, VFF implemented an environmental sustainability plan to ensure the future of the families in the region, by raising public awarenessabouteco-regeneration.
