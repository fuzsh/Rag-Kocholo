        "text": "Rosario Segimón is attracted by the fame of Passeig de Gràcia and purchases a house with a garden on a plot measuring 1,835 square metres at number 92 2 on this avenue. She and her husband commission the architect Antoni Gaudi (then aged 54) to construct a building, with the intention that they will occupy the main floor as their residence and rent out the remaining apartments.\n\nAt the request of Senyora Mila, Gaudi signs a certificate declaring that the construction of the main floor is completed. In the document, he indicates that when the work on the rest of the property is finished, he will sign another certificate.\n\nGaudi certifies the construction is completed, declaring that the work has been done in accordance with his plans and directions and that the entire house is now available to be rented out.\n\nThe unusual structure of the building and the relationship between Gaudi and Mila are the subject of cartoons published in satirical magazines of the time.\n\nRosario Segimón, who has been a widow by now for six years, sells the building to the Immobiliària Provença real estate company, but she continues to live on the main floor until her death in 1964 at the age of 93.\n\nLa Pedrera is included in the list of Artistic Heritage in Barcelona. This is the first list drawn up by the Spanish government with a view to preserving the sites and monuments in the city. Category A/Cap.1.\n\nThe restoration works on the entire building are completed.\n\nCasa Mila is symbolically handed over to the city on 27 June 1996 with the slogan “We aren’t giving a grain of sand but an entire Pedrera [quarry] for Barcelona”.\n\nThe Espai Gaudi – a museum space fitted out to raise awareness of the life and work of Antoni Gaudi – opens in the attic of the building. It is awarded the ACCA Prize (Catalan Association of Art Critics) for the best cultural and artistic initiatives of the year, as it represents the culmination of the restoration and improvement of La Pedrera and is striking testimony of the innovative structural approaches adopted by Gaudi.\n\nThe opening of the Pedrera Apartment, a recreation of the home and life of a well-to-do family during the first 30 years or so of the 20th century, entirely reconstructed using original elements that made up the interior of an apartment in La Pedrera.\n\nThe Catalunya La Pedrera Foundation is constituted on 1 January to respond to a new social reality, and to do so with a new vision. La Pedrera has been the central offices of the Catalunya La Pedrera Foundation ever since it was set up. The revenue raised from admission tickets goes to social, environmental, educational and cultural projects."
