        "text": "The Mallorcan, already recovered from his physical problems, will seek his 13th title on the clay courts of RCTB-1899.\n\nDavid Ferrer states, “Rafa is the greatest player in the history of this sport and the flagship of our tournament.”\n\nRafa Nadal has confirmed his participation in the upcoming edition of the Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell – 71st Trofeo Conde de Godó, a tournament he has won 12 times, held at his club, and featuring a center court named after him. Thus, the ATP 500 Barcelona confirms its first player for the next edition, scheduled from April 13 to 21 at the Real Club de Tenis Barcelona-1899 in its 125th anniversary.\n\nThe Mallorcan tennis player will return to the courts in January in Australia after physical issues prevented him from playing for most of the previous season. Nadal boasts 22 Grand Slam titles in his career and aims to further enhance his legacy in the upcoming season. Nadal shares a special connection with the Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell, having won the title 12 times, with the central court named after him, and being a club member since his junior years. Additionally, the Rafa Nadal Foundation has joined forces with the Tennis Barcelona Foundation to support the “Play All” program, an annual calendar of projects aiding children and youth at risk of social exclusion. The RCTB-1899 also hosts the Rafa Nadal Tour, a tournament for the best Under-12, Under-14, and Under-16 tennis players.\n\nDavid Ferrer, the tournament’s sports director and Nadal’s friend and former rival, expresses great pride in having him participate. “Rafa is the greatest player in the history of this sport and the flagship of our tournament. Being able to continue enjoying him in Barcelona is fortunate, and personally, it excites and makes me very happy,” he says emotionally.\n\nThe Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell takes place at a club celebrating its lively 125-year history, synonymous with tradition, spectacle, and top-notch tennis. Over the 70 years of the tournament’s history, the world’s best rackets have graced its courts, and the tradition of a club like RCTB-1899 has uncovered young talents who have become fabulous tennis players. In recent years, the tournament has served as a platform for players like Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas, or Carlos Alcaraz, who featured in the last finals (2018, 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023)."
