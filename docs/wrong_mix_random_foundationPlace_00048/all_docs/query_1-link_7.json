        "text": "Vicente Ferrer, who has died aged 89, was regarded by Spanish supporters of his aid work in India as a \"lay saint\". More than 100,000 attended his funeral in Anantapur, a testament to the reverence in which he was held and the impact of his work in the region of Andhra Pradesh.\n\nFerrer was born in Barcelona. Just before the outbreak of the Spanish civil war in 1936, he joined the revolutionary party POUM (Partido Obrero de Unificación Marxista, or the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification). He fought in the Battle of the Ebro in late 1938 and, like many, was forced to retreat all the way into France with the Republic's defeated army. There he was interned in the Argelès-sur-Mer camp. Returning to Spain, he was sent for the rest of 1939 to Franco's Betanzos concentration camp before being forced to do three years' military service. He then began to study law, but gave it up in 1944 to train as a Jesuit priest, with the idea of \"helping others\".\n\nIn 1952 he volunteered to go to India. At first he devoted himself to his spiritual development in Pune, but, surrounded by desolation, he soon moved from reflection to action. He started with a school and 12 acres of land at Manmad, north-east of Mumbai. In an arid area, he persuaded farmers to dig wells, offering them oil and wheat while they dug. Then, the digger of one well would help another, in a system Ferrer termed \"linked brotherhood\".\n\nHe was to spend the rest of his life in India, entering into conflict with landowners and political bosses because of his co-operative methods, emphasis on education and challenges to the caste system and to the subjugation of women. He lived and worked among the poorest, especially the dalits (untouchables), who lacked all rights and were mostly illiterate.\n\nFerrer attacked governments, both western and Indian, for ignoring the poor, arguing forcefully that mass poverty could be eradicated only by official action. He also believed in direct action, which led him to clash with local authorities. In 1968, pressure from the latter led to Ferrer's expulsion from India. Some 30,000 peasant farmers marched 150 miles in protest. The prime minister, Indira Gandhi, defused the revolt, saying he could take a \"short holiday\" and return, as long as he agreed to live in another part of the country.\n\nIn October 1969 Ferrer settled in Anantapur, by some accounts because Andhra Pradesh was the only state that would accept him. His life here changed radically and entered its most fruitful period. He left the Jesuits in March 1970 and married a 22-year-old Englishwoman, Anne Perry. She had been on a round-the-world trip with her brother, ran out of money in India, and was sent to interview Ferrer for a newspaper. Impressed by his drive and ability \"to make the impossible possible\", she never completed her trip or journalism training, but stayed on as a volunteer.\n\nLater in 1970 Ferrer founded the Rural Development Trust (later the Ferrer Foundation), through which he channelled all his work. Though trained by the Jesuits as an intellectual, his popularity owed much to his pithy use of language. \"Misery and suffering are not meant to be understood, but to be solved,\" and \"I've declared war on pain and suffering\" were two phrases that helped him raise money, not just from leftwing Catholics (he was never friends with the church hierarchy, who were unrepresented at his funeral) but from a wide base of donors. In 1996 the Vicente Ferrer Foundation was established in Spain, and it receives more than €10m a year from about 150,000 people.\n\nBy the time of Ferrer's death, his foundation had opened and supported 1,700 village schools, serving 125,000 children and employing 2,000 teachers, and three general hospitals with 1,300 staff. It had planted 3m trees and opened libraries, an Aids clinic and family-planning clinics. It organised wells and irrigation schemes. Several projects focus on women, especially dalits, whose lives are blighted by constant childbearing, rape and murder.\n\nOne characteristic Ferrer project was to lend destitute women money, interest-free, to buy cows. The women then sold milk to other dalits, repaying the loan. With a very different style and ideology to that of the most famous 20th-century missionary, Mother Teresa, Ferrer emphasised sustainable development and providing the poor with the basic education and material means to take control of their own lives. Approximately 2 million people have been helped by his projects.\n\nIn recent years Ferrer was awarded numerous prizes for humanitarian work, most notably Spain's Prince of Asturias Concord prize in 1998. He is survived by Anne and their three children, Tara, Moncho and Yamuna."
