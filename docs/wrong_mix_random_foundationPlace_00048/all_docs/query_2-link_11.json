        "text": "Inspiration throughout my career. PART 2 I have been privileged to have been supported through my transition from a maintenance fitter ( a job a loved for years and worked with some amazing people) to a Safety Officer. This started with my initial involvement as a safety Champion. (my Dad was my inspiration for first becoming a safety rep, I always remember hearing him talk about the challenges people were facing at work. He was always trying to help improve the working environment for his colleagues). I was then lucky to have been supportive by two departments who allowed me to follow where my passion lies. I spent 18 months carrying out a dual role as a Maintenance Fitter/ Safety Officer. I was fortunate to be given this opportunity as this has altered my career path. I am so thankful that in march 2023 I was given the support and confidence to step up into the full time position as Health and Safety Officer. Finally I was lucky to have been supported by the HSE team and someone in particular who has helped to give me the belief, support and confidence to apply for my current position as HSE BP for production. This post is a thank you to those who have had the biggest impact on me during my career so far at Portakabin. Thank you all so much.\n\nInspiration throughout my career. PART 1 Inspiration, support guidance and belief. I write this post out of appreciation for someone who told me that we (MHFAs) have made a difference to people who have needed support. This made me think about those that have made an everlasting imprint on me through my carear at Portakabin. As many of you know I have worked for Portakabin for a long time. Yes obviously I am older than I look. Don't ask. During that time I have had the absolute pleasure of meeting so many people who have made a real difference in my life. Over the years I have worked with so many different people. With no disrespect I will focus on those who have made the most difference to me personally. The first were my original mentors when I was an apprentice. The cuppa I make now wouldn't have been the same without them. Joking aside, I was 16 and these kind men helped guide me and mould me into the man am. When you spend so much time with great people, you can never underestimate the positive effect it can have on you. Sadly they are no longer with us, but the impact they had on me will never be forgotten. There is one person who made an imeasurable difference, at a time in my life when I was most vulnerable. This person who even to this very day thinks they failed me today. Yet when my mental ill health became too much to cope with. in a time when such things weren't discussed or considered, this person stood tall and gave me the support I needed. Without you my life would be so different. The Responsible Business Champions at Portakabin have had a huge positive impact on me. They are an incredible driven group of individuals who thrive in supporting the groups, networks and communities they support. The time and effort they put into supporting so many good causes cannot be underestimated. There are opportunities for people who share the same beliefs to join this group. Another person who has made an immeasurable difference in my professional and personal life, is someone who has given me all the training, guidance and support I need as a MHFA. I applied to be a MHFA because I had been personally impacted and lost people I love to ill mental health. Not only did this person train and support me to become a MHFA. She inspired me to support others who give their time to be there for their colleagues, given me the belief in myself and the good we can do. She has supported me through my own difficult times , and I know I am not alone in that. The impact YOU had on me, and so many others is more than you will ever know. (continued in follow up post)\n\nAs we say goodbye to 2023 it seems a good time for reflection. At first glance it's been a tough year. The loss of Family and Friends, some difficult personal circumstances and also seeing family and friends suffer along the way. unfortunately the sad memories often are the ones that can affect us the most and are the ones we remember. Despite all the challenges of 2023 these are the highlights I'm taking into 2024. The time spent with Family. The Friendships I've made and the laughs along the way. The pleasure of working with great people and how they have inspired me and showed me to believe in myself. The decision i made to move into Health and Safety full time as Health and Safety Officer. How proud I am that so many have shown trust in me to share their problems. I'm so proud of the great team of MHFAs I'm so lucky to be a part of. To have been part of the great insight events we have ran this year. Most significant for me is the Health and Wellbeing insight event we ran for production in August with great support from PoetsIN SANE Survivors of Bereavement by Suicide PAPYRUS Prevention of Young Suicide Menfulness Mind thanks to you all for your help with this event. finally I have ended the year with a promotion to HSE BP for production in York. Thanks to all for been part of my 2023 story and I look forward to sharing 2024 with so many amazing people. #mhfaengland I know Christmas and New year can be hard for so many, if you need any help and support please don't hesitate to reach out to me, friends, family, GP and medical professionals. however alone you might feel there are people ready to support you. happy New Year everyone"
