        "text": "in the last week I have spoken to 3 people who's lives have recently been affected by suicide. if anyone is currently suffering with suicidal thoughts, please reach out. As lonely as you might feel you are never truly alone. There is a stranger you are yet to meet who will go out of their way to open a door for you. A friend or family member who takes for granted that you know what you mean to them. Your boss or colleague who is there to talk to. so many volunteers who give their time to offer support to those in need. The First step can be so hard, but please take it, Reach out and ask for whatever help or support you need. I honestly don't know what you are feeling or the pressure you are under. Everyone's circumstance or story is different. I do know there is still a huge stigma in relation to Mental Health and especially Suicide. As a MHFA and someone who is available to support. I Think it's important to break the STIGMA. to do this I share my history with mental Health. a long time ago I went through some personal problems that affected my mental health. At the time I did what i thought was right, I made myself busy. I did what I thought I was supposed to do, I ignored the problems. I \"manned up\". I hid how I was feeling from everyone, I was ashamed of what had happened. I perfected the answer \"I'm Fine\". I don't know if I was convincing or people didn't feel comfortable or confident to ask again. 5 years later everything became too much and I suffered a breakdown. I became depressed and felt like I was a weight on my family and friends. I started acting without any care what would happen to me or anyone else. Thankfully someone made me realise it was ok to talk. I didn't want to burden her with how I felt, but at the second attempt I could talk to a counsellor. PLEASE if you do speak to someone and don' make a connection with them, don't give up, please try again. This made a massive difference, my problems weren't over but I started to learn some healthy coping methods. A year later a close friend had personal problems and despite regularly talking about things, one day he took his own life. looking back I accepted the answers I had once given myself. I'm Ok, Everything's FINE, yeh I'm GOOD. my own experiences and what happened to my friend, were my driving force behind me training to be a Mental Health First Aider. To show that it's ok to say I need to talk. To ask twice when your friend says he's fine. i have since suffered with poor mental health and accept that given the stresses and difficulties that we all will face, I will suffer again. I have seen family members and friends struggle too. The IMPORTANT thing, is that this is Ok, as long as we know that we are not alone. we can ask for help. Please never think you are alone. please as hard as it is reach out. At Portakabin we are so lucky to have so many committed MHFAs and colleagues who care and are there to support you. #MHFA #papyrus #SOBS"
