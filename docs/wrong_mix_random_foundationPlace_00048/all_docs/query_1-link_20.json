        "text": "Toky Defending champion David Ferrer and Richard Gasquet eliminated local hopes to stay on course for a re-run of last year’s final at the Japan Open tennis tournament on Thursday.\n\nThe Spanish top seed, the winner at Valencia and s-Hertogenbosch this season, got off to a slow start but recovered to overcome Japanese wild card Takao Suzuki with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 win.\n\nGasquet, fourth seed from France being hailed as a “genius,” ended Japanese teenage sensation Kei Nishikori’s excellent run with a 6-1, 6-2 victory to stay on course for a probable semi-final clash against Ferrer.\n\nGasquet will next face the 2003 Japan Open champion Rainer Schuettler of Germany, who was stretched the distance to oust Mikhail Youzhny of Russia 6-3, 6-7 (12/14), 6-4. American second seed Andy Roddick overcame Austria’s Jurgen Melzer 7-6 (7/2), 6-2, while Viktor Troicki of Serbia earned a place against Roddick when Jo Wilfried Tsonga of France, the Australian Open runner-up, retired with an injury.\n\nShikha-Mashona lose\n\nShikha Uberoi and her American partner Mashona Washington crashed out of the doubles event after suffering a straight-set defeat against second seeded pair of Vania King and Tiantian Sun in Tokyo. Indo-American pair lost 3-6, 4-6 to the American-Chinese pair in the Tier III hard court event.\n\nLi stuns Serena\n\nStuttgart: Serena Williams crashed 6-0, 1-6, 4-6 against China’s Li Na in the second round of the Porsche Grand Prix and will lose the World No 1 ranking to Serbian Jelena Jankovic again.\n\nIn other second-round action, Victoria Azarenka of Belarus stunned Polish eight seed Agnieszka Radwanska 6-1, 7-5, fighting from 5-3 down in the second set. Azarenka now meets the Olympic champion Dementieva who claimed a 6-1, 6-4 victory over Austrian Sybille Bammer. In earlier first-round action, Patty Schnyder defeated Svetlana Kuznetsova for the first in more than three years, 6-4, 4-6, 7-5."
