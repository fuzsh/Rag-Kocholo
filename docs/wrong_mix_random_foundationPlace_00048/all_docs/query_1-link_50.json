        "text": "In the grand tradition of honoring fallen colleagues, the Pipes and Drums of California Professional Firefighters was created to perform at funerals and memorial services honoring California firefighters who have died in the line of duty.\n\nSince its inception in 1999, the Pipes and Drums has grown from a few members to 26 individuals. Each musician is a paid, career or retired firefighter, whose participation in the Band is entirely on a volunteer basis.\n\nThe Pipes and Drums of California Professional Firefighters creates a dignified, traditional presence at the annual California Firefighters Memorial in California State Capitol Park, Sacramento. Playing in the great tradition of Scottish bagpipe bands, the group lends an air of dignity and honor to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice.\n\nPlease contact us at cafirefoundation@cpf.org for more information or to inquire about the bandâ€™s availability.\n\nThe current membership of the Pipes and Drums of California Professional Firefighters:\n\nDane Bode, Los Angeles County\n\nRodney Cordero, Salinas\n\nTracey Hansen, Cosumnes\n\nJeremy Hoag, Fremont\n\nMark Howell, Pinole\n\nMark Lundquist, Orange County\n\nKelcey Sass, Vista\n\nAaron Wham, Sacramento Metro\n\nJohn Williamson, Del Mar"
