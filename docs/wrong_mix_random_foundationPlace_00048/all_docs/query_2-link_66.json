Roddick, who will play Australian Bernard Tomic on Arthur Ashe Stadium tonight, said he knew after his Wimbledon defeat to David Ferrer this year that his days were numbered on the ATP Tour. He decided that he didn’t want to simply cut back to a reduced schedule and that he either wanted to be all in or not in at all.\n\n“Andy has been an outstanding ambassador for our sport and our country, always carrying himself with the character and class that define a champion,\" said USTA Chairman of the Board Jon Vegosen. \"In addition to representing the U.S. on the world stage, he was a Davis Cup stalwart and standout. We could not be more proud of Andy and all that he has accomplished in his brilliant career, and we wish him every success and happiness in his retirement from the pro game.”\n\n“Ever since I’ve been on tour, it feels like Andy has been there, at least for the most part of it. Andy’s been\n\ngreat. He’s been great for American men’s tennis, great for the U.S. Open, doing so much, playing so well so\n\noften, just being such a great player, a great attitude, incredibly fun to watch. I know a lot of people look up to\n\nAndy Roddick. It’s very incredibly, incredibly, incredibly sad for me to lose a friend on tour that I look forward to\n\nseeing every Grand Slam and every shared tournament. It’s going to be hard.”—Serena Williams\n\n“I’m thankful for everything he’s done for the game, especially here for tennis in America. It’s not been easy after Agassi and Sampras, Courier, Chang, Connors, McEnroe, you name it … It’s been hard for him as well at times. I thought he always did the best he could; that’s all you can ask from a guy.”—Roger Federer\n\nThe following is a transcript from Roddick’s retirement announcement …\n\nWhy now?\n\nRoddick: I just feel like it’s time. I don’t know that I’m healthy enough or committed enough to go another year. I’ve always wanted to, in a perfect world, finish at this event. I have a lot of family and friends here. I’ve thought all year that I would know when I got to this tournament. When I was playing my first round, I knew.\n\nIs it something you’ve been wrestling with for days, weeks, or months?\n\nRoddick: Yeah, it’s been a process. It’s certainly not days. I don’t know that I would have had you all come in here and waste your time if it had been days. You know, certain parts throughout the year, I’ve thought about it. You know, just with the way my body feels, with the way that I’m able to feel like I’m able to compete now, I don’t know that it’s good enough. I don’t know that I’ve ever been someone who’s interested in existing on tour. I have a lot of interests and a lot of other things that excite me. I’m looking forward to those.\n\nIs there any way to quantify how much the health issue is versus the mental and emotional issue?\n\nRoddick: It’s tough to say. It’s kind of chicken or egg. How much of mental fatigue is because you don’t feel like you can do what you want to do physically? You don’t know where it starts. But it’s tough to put a number.\n\nYou’ve been talking about this for a couple years. We’ve talked about 30 is not that old in tennis. Obviously Federer is 30. You’ve been a good athlete, very competitive. In a sense, you’re sort of retiring early, no?\n\nRoddick: Now you’re saying that (smiling)?\n\nYes.\n\nRoddick: Well, it’s good. I didn’t want to make it through this press conference without a direct comparison to Roger, so thank you for that. I don’t know, necessarily. A number is a number. But I think wear and tear and miles is something that’s not really an age thing. You know, if you look at my contemporaries that started with me, Roger is the only one that’s still going and still going strong. It’s a matter of how I feel. I feel like I’m able to compete at the highest level. Frankly, these guys have gotten really, really, really good. I’m not sure that with compromised health that I can do what I want to do right now.\n\nI’m assuming the high point is 2003 here. So good place to bow out.\n\nRoddick: I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t view it in a scope of where you had your best win. I’ve had a lot of different memories. I’ll certainly look back. I feel like I’d be cheating the other memories if I said one was the highlight.\n\nYou know, I feel like I’ve been very lucky. That’s certainly not lost on me.\n\nYou mentioned other projects. What projects would you like to do now that the tennis career is coming to an end?\n\nRoddick: Well, immediately we announced yesterday or the day before we’re building, with my foundation, a youth tennis and learning center in Austin. I’d like to be hands on with that and not see it periodically. I’d like to be kind of on site every day. There’s some other projects, kind of side projects, that I’ve been doing. Those excite me a lot right now. So I’m looking forward to it.\n\nHow emotional is this for you? I know you like to make light of things. Now that it’s final for you, how emotional is it? What was it about that first round match that clicked?\n\nRoddick: I don’t know. On some big moments this year, I think I’ve known. You know, walking off at Wimbledon, I felt like I knew. Playing here, I don’t know what it was. I couldn’t imagine myself being there in another year. I’ve always, for whatever my faults have been, felt like I’ve never done anything halfway. Probably the first time in my career that I can sit here and say I’m not sure that I can put everything into it physically and emotionally. I don’t know that I want to disrespect the game by coasting home. I had plans to play a smaller schedule next year. But the more I thought about it, I think you either got to be all in or not. You know, that’s more kind of the way I’ve chosen to do things.\n\nIs there an emotional element to this? You’ve sat alone and thought about it, talked to family?\n\nRoddick: Yeah, I mean, I’ve had some hard conversations with Brooke this year, with Doug and Larry. You know, it was Brooke and I’s little secret over the last couple days. I talked to Larry and Doug today. We had talked about it throughout the year, obviously. Talked to a bunch of my friends that are here. It’s time.\n\nWhat do you think you’ll miss the most? You’ve been doing this a long time.\n\nRoddick: All of you (smiling). I’m not sure. You know, I’m lucky enough, there are a lot of players where I live. I don’t think I’m one of the guys who won’t pick up a racquet for three years. You know, I still love the innocent parts of the game. I love hitting tennis balls. I love seeing the young guys do well. I’ll still have a lot of friends to watch. I’ll miss the relationships probably the most. As time passes, I’ll probably miss the tennis more. But immediately that’s probably the thing that is toughest for me.\n\nWhy not wait until after your final match, your birthday? Did you want to give the fans an opportunity?\n\nRoddick: Those are good reasons. I think I wanted an opportunity to say good bye to people, as well. I don’t know how tomorrow’s going to go. I hope it goes well and I hope I’m sticking around. I just imagine being off the court tomorrow in an empty locker room. I think I wanted a chance to say good bye. Also, if I do run into some emotions tomorrow or in four days or however long, I don’t want people to think I’m a little unstable, or more unstable (smiling). That’s why I came to this decision.\n\nYou are playing under the lights on Ashe tomorrow for potentially what could be the last time. What do you anticipate your emotions will be?\n\nRoddick: I have no idea. I talked to Larry and Doug and said, I could come out and play great, or it could be the worst thing you’ve ever seen. I don’t know. I’ve never done this before. I’m sure it will be very emotional. I’m sure I’ll still be nervous. I don’t know.\n\nDid Ken’s passing at all in any outside way sort of influence where you are, in this decision at all, where you are in the game?\n\nRoddick: Maybe. I don’t know. Ken was certainly a huge, huge part of everything for me. He believed in me from very early on. You know, that certainly wasn’t easy for me. But, you know, his wife and his daughter are going to come up, so that will be really nice to have them here.\n\nDo you take any example from any athlete you’ve ever seen who knew the right time to retire?\n\nRoddick: I think the thing that you guys have to understand is there’s not going to be a general rule. It’s not because you have a certain age next to your name that that’s it. There are a lot of different personalities. Some people just want to play until they can’t play anymore, until they’re pushed out just by ranking, or they can’t get into tournaments.\n\nI don’t think it’s fair to maybe generalize this moment for people. Different people tick in different ways. I don’t know that I looked at anybody else’s scenario when thinking about this ’cause I don’t know that I could pretend to relate to whatever they were thinking at a given moment.\n\nLike any top American athlete, you’re praised, you’re criticized. What are you most proud of in your run, your career? If you could point to one or two things that you might have changed, what would that be?\n\nRoddick: I don’t know that I would change much. Obviously I think everybody would want to win a match or two more. Had I won a match or two more, we’d be looking back at something a little bit different. But that’s also shaped kind of who I am and how I’ve been able to learn. You know, if everything would have been easy the whole way, who knows how you’d view things. I’m pretty content with the way I do.\n\nYou’ve learned from playing in this era of Roger, Rafa, Djokovic in terms of your life?\n\nRoddick: I think so. At the end of the day, I know that people view it as a career, last little while, of some hard knocks. But I got to play. I got to play in a crowd, play in Wimbledon finals, be the guy on a Davis Cup team for a while. Those are opportunities not a lot of people get.\n\nAs much as I was disappointed and frustrated at times, I’m not sure that I ever felt sorry for myself or begrudged anybody any of their success.\n\nThe first part of that question, what are you most proud of?\n\nRoddick: You know, I was pretty good for a long time. The reason I gave earlier about not feeling like I could be committed to this thing a hundred percent, that’s one of the things I’m proud of. That for 13 or 14 years, I was invested fully, every day. I’ve seen a lot of people throughout that time be invested for a year, kind of tap out for a year, come back. I’ve been pretty good about keeping my nose to the grindstone. I feel like I won a lot of matches from hard work and persistence, even maybe when I had better options as far as shot making.\n\nWhat does it mean to you to be the face of American tennis for the last eight years?\n\nRoddick: It’s been a pleasure. It’s not something that’s easy every day, for sure, especially when you get kind of anointed at a young age, 17, 18. It’s something you roll with. For the moments where it’s been hard, I’ve had 25 positive things that have come from it. Again, anything that people may view as tough, I’ve been very lucky and very fortunate. I’ve gotten a lot of opportunities. I wouldn’t trade away a day of it. I’ve loved every minute.\n\nYou said there’s some interesting things you’d like to move on to do. What are they? What does your wife think of this decision?\n\nRoddick: I haven’t asked her yet (laughter). I’m joking. A lot of stuff with my foundation will probably be my primary focus from here for a little bit. Obviously I’ve gone over to the dark side with you guys with the radio show a little bit. So that’s fun. It’s something I enjoy doing. I’ll probably build on that a little bit. There are some other things also. I’m looking forward to it.\n\nThere’s plenty of athletes that make this kind of announcement in a flood of tears. You seem quite clear about it.\n\nRoddick: I feel clear. If I’m being honest, I would have bet against myself on getting through this without tears today. I must have already gotten them all out earlier. I feel pretty good today. This has been a huge part of my life always. But I don’t know that it’s always been my entire life. So I do feel very confident in the things and the people that I have to fall back on.\n\nYour first time here at the U.S. Open, what has this place meant to you since?\n\nRoddick: My first time? I was here in ’98, I played Fernando González in the juniors first round.\n\nYou came as a fan before that?\n\nRoddick: Oh, gosh, yeah. I came here in I think it was 1990 with my parents as a birthday present. I snuck into the players lounge without a credential.\n\nDid you see Pete [Sampras]?\n\nRoddick: I saw Pete. He was playing video games. I’m pretty sure I beat him at like Mortal Kombat or something. That was fun. I was here in ’91 when Jimmy was making his run. We only had grounds passes, but I got into the stadium every day somehow. Then playing here, I think I played professional in ’99 doubles for the first time. There have been a lot of memories here.\n\nWhat does this place mean to you?\n\nRoddick: It’s meant a lot. It’s the highest of highs and probably the lowest of lows also. It’s certainly never been boring. I’ve always enjoyed the energy. I feel like each Grand Slam is almost a microcosm of the place it’s played in.\n\nThis is a show. It’s New York City in every way. I’m glad that I’ve been a very, very small part of it.\n\nYou mentioned the run of Jimmy Connors. Are you ready to let it hang all out, go on a dream run here?\n\nRoddick: We’ll see. I wish it was a choice (smiling).\n\nYou mentioned you talked to Doug and Larry. What were the reaction of some of your friends?\n\nRoddick: Some are still learning. I didn’t want to tell the guys that had to play, so James is going to be surprised. Dougie was a little baby about it all (laughter). Lost a lot of man respect for him. Everyone is a little stunned just because of the finality of it all, but I don’t think anybody was really surprised. I think the people that know me know that I’ve been thinking about it for a little bit. It’s the time. I think they all understood that. They’re all happy. Some of my friends are excited because it means more golf rounds. I see some head nodding there. No, everyone’s been very supportive.\n\nIn 2006, Agassi retires. I remember you saying, The training wheels are off for us. Now the training wheels are off for the younger guys. Are you comfortable where the younger guys are moving ahead?\n\nRoddick: I think so. You know, I can’t protect them now, you know, that’s for sure. But I think John’s ready. Mardy is really good with the younger guys. Ryan will play well once he figures everything out. Doesn’t change the fact that I still live four miles away from him. I’ll still kick his ass. No, I feel pretty good about it all. Even though I won’t be competing against them, I think they all know I’ve never been more than a phone call away from them.\n\nWhen you’re back at home in Austin, walking about the house, see the US Open trophy you won, what goes through your mind?\n\nRoddick: Honestly, I don’t see it very often. It’s in a study. We all know I don’t go there very much (laughter). I see it probably as much as you guys see the one here.\n\nTo play another match at night, how much have you enjoyed night matches here at the Open and how much different are they from day matches?\n\nRoddick: I mean, it’s the most electric atmosphere in our sport. There’s something about it. There’s a lot of eyeballs on TV sets from people who don’t even normally watch tennis during night matches of the US Open. I think I’ve played as many as anyone. Again, it’s just something I’ll look back on with really fond memories. Hopefully won’t be my last one."
