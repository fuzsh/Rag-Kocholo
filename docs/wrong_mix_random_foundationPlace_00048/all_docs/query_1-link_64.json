        "text": "07/16/2024\n\nI FINALLY found you! You were my Dr for a while in Atlanta, Tx! I will be making an appointment soon! ♥️ Great Dr!\n\n— JuJu\n\n06/28/2023\n\nDr Ferrer is the best doctor ever! He is my primary care physician and I travel almost two hours to see him. He is extremely knowledgeable and will try to fix the problem instead of covering the symptoms with medications. Dr Ferrer is my hero!\n\n— Patsy Whatley\n\n02/17/2023\n\nMy wife and I were very lucky finding doctor Ferrer, we actually followed him after he left Atlanta TX. to go to Quitman. Dr.Ferrer is very friendly and explains things to you so you understand. Very good Doctor and he will remain our doctountil we are no longer around. Thanks for everything Doctor Ferrer\n\n— George Overall\n\n06/17/2022\n\nI recently seen Dr. Ferrer after trying to see several doctors at christus health for a shoulder injury and being either canceled on or after waiting over 4 hours in the Lindale urgent care leaving without being seen. He saw me within 30 minutes of that of showing up at the er and being told to go to the clinic to see if I can be seen there and I'm so glad I did. I now have a new primary. He seems like a great doctor and I'm done with christus."
