        "text": "The Internazionali BNL d’Italia (Rome Masters) 2014 draw is out. World No.1 Rafael Nadal, who has a bye in the first round, will head over to Rome after Madrid (with hopefully the Ion Tiriac trophy in tow!).\n\nRafa’s second round match is against the winner of Gilles Simone vs. Filippo Volandri. Drawn in his quarter is Andy Murray. In his half are Stanislas Wawrinka. He has a potential quarterfinal matchup with Murray, and semifinal with Wawrinka or Tomas Berdych. The other half sees Roger Federer and Milos Raonic in one quarter and Novak Djokovic and David Ferrer in another. Rafa could face Djokovic in the final.\n\nRafa is the defending champion in Rome, where he defeated Roger Federer last year to lift the trophy. Roland Garros follows the event. Could we finally see a long-awaited Rafa vs. Murray match-up?\n\nVamos Rafa!"
