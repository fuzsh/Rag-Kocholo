        "text": "♪ ♪ (theme music plays) RUBENSTEIN: I'm David Rubenstein and I'm pleased to be in conversation today with Ada Ferrer, who's a professor at New York University talking about her new book, \"Cuba: An American History.\"\n\nAnd I'm very pleased to be able to do this at the New York Historical Society and the Robert H. Smith Auditorium.\n\nWelcome.\n\nFERRER: Thank you, I'm looking forward to our conversation.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: Okay, let's try in the remaining time to go through 500 years... FERRER: Okay.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: Of, uh, Cuban history.\n\nSo, uh, who quote \"discovered Cuba?\"\n\nWas that Christopher Columbus?\n\nFERRER: That was Christopher Columbus in 1492.\n\nHe landed on the Northeastern Coast and said it was the most beautiful land human eyes had ever seen.\n\nIt had a, an indigenous population.\n\nThe main group were called or are, have since been called Tainos.\n\nAnd they were the people who, who Columbus met.\n\nUm, they were...\n\nIt is estimated that between 80 and 95% of the indigenous population on the island perished as a result of the Spanish conquest.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: So after Columbus discovered, uh, Cuba, did he go back and say to Queen Isabella, \"And, uh, guess what?\n\nI just covered some great place for you.\n\nAnd now we're gonna do things that name places there after you.\"\n\nWhat did he do?\n\nFERRER: He was disappointed in Cuba because it didn't have much gold.\n\nSo he went to Hispaniola, which is the island that today has the Dominican Republic and Haiti.\n\nAnd the first Spanish settlement was there.\n\nHe went back to the, back to Spain and asked for more money and more ships, and did another expedition and another and another.\n\nSo the...\n\nSo he was not the person to colonize or settle Cuba.\n\nThat happened later in 1511.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: Who comes after Columbus and who is quote \"colonizing or running, uh, Cuba?\"\n\nFERRER: Yeah.\n\nWell, the, the Spanish are.\n\nYou know, they just, they start settling Cuban in 1511, or colonizing it.\n\nThey're gonna end up going to Mexico not much later by the end of that decade in '15, uh, '17 or '18.\n\nAnd when that happens, the attention of both the Spanish crown, the Spanish government but also of the colonist in, in Cuba turned to Mexico, because in Mexico there's these huge native empires.\n\nThey're not yet dying and there's all this gold and silver.\n\nSo Cuba kind of becomes something of a backwater as people there leave and go to Mexico later to the, to the, to Peru and the Andes.\n\nAnd so Cuba kind of languishes a little bit.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: But its main, uh, economic product was what?\n\nFERRER: Well, in this early period, really its main draw was its location.\n\nSo if you think of where Cuba is, it's at the intersection of the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, uh, the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nWhere Havana is on the Northern Coast of the island is where the, the Gulf Stream kind of gathers.\n\nAnd what the Spanish did was use Havana as the meeting point for all the Spanish treasure fleets.\n\nIt became known as the key to of the Indies and everyone wanted it.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: Let's fast forward through the 1500s, the 1600s, the 1700s, and the 1800s.\n\nFERRER: Okay.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: So, uh, towards the end of the, uh, 1800s, Spain is still in control of Cuba.\n\nThere is a, uh, effort to, of the indigenous people to free themselves from the Spanish control.\n\nIs that right?\n\nFERRER: Mm-hmm.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: And were there revolutionary efforts to kind of say to the Spanish, \"Go home and we really wanna have our country back.\"\n\nFERRER: Yes.\n\nSo throughout the 19th century there were attempts at various points, but the main one began in 1868.\n\nUh, it was begun by a slave holder who freed his slaves and said, \"Join me, we will make Cuba independent.\"\n\nAnd that was the first war.\n\nIt lasted ten years.\n\nIt failed.\n\nThe second war was called the, \"Little War\" that lasted one year and it failed.\n\nThen there was a third war from 1895 to 1898.\n\nAnd that war was fascinating because it occurred in a former slave society.\n\nMost of the army was Black and it's... And the leaders of that movement espoused this idea that Cuba could be a new kind of nation that transcended race.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: Now, in the United States, the late 1890s, we call something the Spanish-American War.\n\nFERRER: Mm-hmm.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: So how did we get in the middle of that revolution that was going on?\n\nFERRER: The Spanish-American War, 1898.\n\nThe Maine blew up in Havana Harbor.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: What is the Maine?\n\nFERRER: So, the Maine was an American, um, war ship that was in Havana Harbor protecting American property because there had been some attacks by Spanish citizens against US property in Havana.\n\nAnd so it was sitting in the Harbor and then it blew up.\n\nThe Spanish and Cubans later would say the US did it on purpose to have a pretext to enter the war.\n\nUm, the Americans said, \"It was, it was mined by the Spanish.\"\n\nAnd so, to this day nobody, nobody really knows.\n\nBut after the, the explosion of the Maine, the Americans declared war on Spain.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: So the president of the United States is President McKinley.\n\nFERRER: Right.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: He goes to Congress and he asks for declaration of war.\n\nFERRER: Yes.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: Which he gets.\n\nFERRER: Mm-hmm.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: What about Teddy Roosevelt?\n\nUh, what does he do?\n\nHe is an assistant secretary of the Navy and he decides to go and participate in the war?\n\nFERRER: He's asked to, to round up some volunteers of, you know, so-called cowboys.\n\nAnd those are of course, the famous Rough Riders.\n\nAnd they go to Cuba and, and fight... RUBENSTEIN: And Who were the Rough Riders, were they... FERRER: They were, they were from all over the...\n\nSome of them were immigrants.\n\nSome of them were friends from Harvard.\n\nThere were a lot from the Southwest, uh, the, the people who were called Hispanos that were the former Spanish, uh, speaking residents of the Southwest.\n\nAnd they joined the Rough Riders.\n\nAnd the idea was that they had Spanish, they could help.\n\nSo some of them were, uh, with them.\n\nSo it was, it was... You know, they were immigrants, they were Jews.\n\nIt was all kinds of people except for African-Americans who went in separate regiments.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: So what did the Rough Riders actually do?\n\nWhat was, uh, the charge of San Juan Hill?\n\nWhat, what, what was all that?\n\nWas that publicity or was that really a real fight?\n\nFERRER: No, it was a real fight.\n\nBut, you know, the, the Americans came into the war, into a war that had already been being fought for three years.\n\nAnd the Cuban generals strongly believed that victory was almost theirs.\n\nThat the Spanish were controlling the cities, they couldn't get control of the countryside.\n\nSo basically the, the Cuban generals felt they were grateful for the assistance, but they think they could have also won the war without the Americans.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: Okay, so the war is over.\n\nUm, the Americans say, \"Well, we helped you win and maybe we should stay here, and maybe we should help control if I own this country.\"\n\nHow did we resolve all that?\n\nFERRER: The Americans don't leave.\n\nThey become a military government of occupation.\n\nAnd so on, on, uh, January 1st, 1899 at noon, every Spanish flag on the island comes down and an American one is raised in its place and Cuba is ruled by an American governor.\n\nFirst it was, uh, John Brook, then Leonard Wood, so there's a, a, a US government of occupation, um, in Cuba for about three and a half years.\n\nAnd they determine when elections are called, they write budgets, et cetera, et cetera.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: Well, in the peace agreement with Spain, uh, who was at the table negotiating it?\n\nFERRER: Spain and the US and that... RUBENSTEIN: And where were the Cubans?\n\nFERRER: They weren't there.\n\nAnd that was something that the Cubans were, were so mad about.\n\nI mean, imagine there's been a 30-year movement for independence.\n\nIt's produced, uh, a, a rebel army that's 50,000 strong.\n\nIt's got writers and ideologues and essays who promote Cuban independence.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: But in the end, uh, the country was owned by the Cubans, but the Americans had some rights that were quite unique in terms of being able to come back in or controlling the country if there was invaders so forth.\n\nWhat were the rights that the Americans had?\n\nRUBENSTEIN: And, and what kind of economic control did the Americans have over Cuba?\n\nFERRER: So the Americans left, uh, Cuba.\n\nThey, they ended the occupation on May 20th, 1902.\n\nBut they agreed to leave only after the Cubans accepted something called the Platt Amendment.\n\nUm, so the Platt Amendment was written by, you know, a US Senator.\n\nIt was incorporated into the first Cuban constitution as an appendix.\n\nAnd the Platt Amendment did several things.\n\nFor example, it set aside the land that would eventually become the Guantanamo Naval Base.\n\nIt forbid the Cuban government from incurring debt with a third government, from entering into a treaty with any government other than the US.\n\nAnd most importantly, it gave the US the right of intervention.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: So who was running the government day-to-day let's say in the '20s, the '30s, the '40s?\n\nIs it a series of elected officials or are they generals who took over?\n\nFERRER: Yeah.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: How was the government... Country really run?\n\nFERRER: So, um, early they are elected officials.\n\nAnd one of the things that happens is that because the Platt Amendment is in place, if you have an opposition party say that loses an election, and they're not happy with that result, all they have to do is create enough trouble that suddenly there will be calls for US intervention because the US has the right of intervention.\n\nThat was for the first three decades.\n\nThen the Platt Amendment was, was repealed in 1934.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: Who was general Batista, who was he?\n\nFERRER: So, most Americans know Batista as the man who Fidel Castro deposed.\n\nAnd he was, that's who he was.\n\nBut he had...\n\nHe got a start in, in Cuban politics much earlier than, than that.\n\nSo in 1933, there was a progressive revolution that, nationalized some US property.\n\nIt gave women the right to vote.\n\nIt repealed the Platt Amendment.\n\nAnd Batista was a part of that, but he was not progressive.\n\nThen what happened with that revolution is the Americans weren't happy with it.\n\nAnd so they would not the revolutionary government.\n\nAnd Batista says to the US ambassador, \"What will it take for the US to recognize the government?\"\n\nAnd the American ambassador said, \"A new government.\"\n\nAnd so basically Batista deposed the progressive revolutionary government.\n\nAnd that's how he got his start.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: And, and what year was that?\n\nFERRER: That was in 1933 and the, and 30, early 34.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: So he began to run the government.\n\nFERRER: Yes.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: But... FERRER: But through puppet presidents, as head of the army through puppet presidents.\n\nAnd then in 1940, he was elected president in a legitimate fair election.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: So during 1950s, there are a series of student led and other, um, I would say efforts to overthrow the Batista government.\n\nUm, what was his reaction to it?\n\nDid he have a strong-armed policy to, um, get rid of these students?\n\nOr what did he do?\n\nFERRER: In the '30s he had a strong-armed policy.\n\nIn the, in 1940 he was elected.\n\nThere was less of that.\n\nHe could only run for one term.\n\nSo he left office in 1944.\n\nSpent a lot of time in West Palm Beach.\n\nHe returned to run for office, again, in the elections of 1952.\n\nHe was running a distant third.\n\nAnd he knew there was no hope of winning.\n\nAnd so in March of 1952, he returned to Cuba and staged a coup and basically took over the government in something like an hour and 17 minutes.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: And what was the US government's reaction to that?\n\nFERRER: The US government, uh, recognized his government.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: Okay.\n\nFERRER: Yeah.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: So Batista is running the government.. FERRER: Now as, without having been elected, right?\n\nRUBENSTEIN: But there's protests repeatedly in the 1950s... FERRER: Yeah.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: That basically his government was corrupt or it was, um, uh, not doing appropriate things.\n\nSo did the student revolts get very far?\n\nFERRER: Yeah, there were all kinds of revolts against them.\n\nThe student, the students had always been politically active.\n\nThey were important in the revolution of '33.\n\nThey were important in, in the revolution of the 1950s.\n\nThey tried to assassinate him at one point in 1957, uh, and actually made it into the presidential palace, but he was working in a third floor office no one knew about and he, he escaped.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: Now, uh, who was Fidel Castro?\n\nWhere was he born and what was family background?\n\nFERRER: Yeah, he was, he was born in Eastern Cuba.\n\nHis father was, um, a Spanish descent and was a landowner, uh, very well off.\n\nHis mother had been, uh, a domestic worker in his house, in his father's house.\n\nAnd that's how they met and, and married.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: What propels him all of a sudden to say, \"I want to be a revolutionary and overthrow the government.\"\n\nFERRER: Yeah, so he was actually... Before he was a revolutionary, he was just a, he was just a politician.\n\nSo, uh... RUBENSTEIN: He was a lawyer and a politician.\n\nFERRER: A lawyer and a politician.\n\nHe was running for senate in 1952.\n\nSo when Batista staged the coup it, you know, it also ended his campaign for senate.\n\nAnd he initially tried to sue Batista for, for the coup.\n\nUh, that didn't work.\n\nAnd so then he organized a really crazy scheme to take over the army barracks in, in Eastern Cuban in Santiago, the second most important army barracks.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: And I assume that effort was not successful.\n\nFERRER: That effort was a, a total...\n\nIn terms of the, in terms of the military outcome, it was a total failure.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: So he was arrested.\n\nFERRER: He was arrested.\n\nNot there, he was...\n\nHe escaped into the... You know, he escaped and then was found a day or two later.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: But eventually he was tried.\n\nFERRER: And he was tried.\n\nAnd then... What, you know, so the, the attack on the barracks was a military failure that ended up being, uh, a public relations success for him.\n\nSo he, he, he was a... You know, he was, he was very charismatic.\n\nAnd they try him and everyone shows up to see him.\n\nAnd he's very dramatic.\n\nAnd he holds his hands up and shows his handcuffs and says, \"In what kind of civilized land is a man tried in handcuffs?\"\n\nAnd the judge orders the handcuffs.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: This is during the trial?\n\nFERRER: During the trial.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: He had his handcuffs initially... FERRER: And he says, \"You can't do that.\"\n\nRUBENSTEIN: But despite all that, he is convicted.\n\nFERRER: He's convicted.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: And what is he sentenced to?\n\nFERRER: He doesn't serve his whole sentence.\n\nHe only serves about two years of it or a little less.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: But he does go to jail.\n\nFERRER: He goes to jail.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: And what does he do in jail?\n\nDoes he... FERRER: He reads.\n\nHe reads every waking moment.\n\nSo he reads Marx.\n\nHe reads a lot about, um, about FDR.\n\nHe reads Freud.\n\nHe reads Dostoevsky.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: All right.\n\nSo Castro is freed.\n\nAnd does he say, \"Okay, I've learned my lesson.\n\nI'm gonna go back and practice law.\"\n\nOr what does he say he's gonna do?\n\nFERRER: He's gonna lead the revolution.\n\nAnd, uh, he goes to Mexico and begins training there for guerrilla warfare.\n\nAnd that's where he meets Che Guevera, who's the Argentine doctor who would then join the Cuban revolution.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: All right.\n\nSo he goes to Mexico.\n\nAnd part of his plot is to come back with, on a boat and land in Cuba and then overthrow the government, I guess, more or less.\n\nFERRER: Exactly.\n\nYeah.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: Uh, how did that plan go?\n\nFERRER: Uh, it didn't go well initially.\n\nSo they end up having to go up into the mountains and the, the Batista's air force is over them and, you know, dropping bombs and shooting at them.\n\nAnd so they all separate.\n\nUm, and they end up with just, you know, I think about 20 men scattered in the mountains.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: And it was said that he had been killed by the, uh... FERRER: Yes.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: The government.\n\nAnd, uh, so he's in the mountains kind of living hand to mouth a bit.\n\nFERRER: Mm-hmm.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: Got a couple people with him.\n\nBut how does he convince people he's still alive?\n\nFERRER: Yeah, he realizes that, um, he's gonna have to get a really big voice to say he's alive.\n\nAnd so he scored this interview, uh, with the New York Times journalist, Herbert Matthews.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: So Herbert Matthews goes up into the mountains... FERRER: With a, yep.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: Has some interviews with Castro.\n\nUm, they're the first time anybody's had interviews... FERRER: Right.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: With him like this.\n\nComes down, writes up the story, and then it's printed in New York Times.\n\nAnd do people believe it?\n\nI, they think he made it up.\n\nFERRER: Most people believe it.\n\nI mean, Batista's government keep saying, \"This is all... You know, this is all the imagination of this journalist.\"\n\nBut the next day, the New York Times prints a picture of Herbert Matthews and Fidel Castro seated next to each other.\n\nSo that lays to, to rest some doubts.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: How does Castro get out of the mountains and come down and, and do what he did later to take over the government?\n\nFERRER: Yeah.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: Can you go through that scenario?\n\nFERRER: Yeah, so it takes a while.\n\nYou know, it takes about, um, all of '50, well, all of '57 and '58.\n\nUm, and basically what they...\n\nThey have this guerrilla army that keeps growing.\n\nMore people are coming to join them.\n\nThey're getting money from, from the cities, but also from abroad.\n\nUh, from Cuban exiles, um, who are not communist at all and they're supporting the, the revolution.\n\nThey start, as they, and they start taking over more territory.\n\nAnd then in the territory they'd take over they, they, they put in place a revolutionary government.\n\nThey carry out a modest agrarian reform.\n\nSo they're, they're setting up a little state in the mountains and they're fighting.\n\nThere's also students and, and workers and others in, in the cities who are exploding bombs every night and who are engaging in sabotage.\n\nSo there's...\n\nThe revolution has different theaters that are kind of all... RUBENSTEIN: So it wasn't only Castro?\n\nFERRER: It was not.\n\nYou know, in the beginning Castro was just one revolutionary among many.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: But eventually he comes down from the mountains and eventually what, what does Batista decide to do?\n\nFERRER: He leaves.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: He just... FERRER: He knows, he knows it's over.\n\nAnd one of the things that was key is that the Americans realized that there would be no peace with Batista in power.\n\nAnd that's what the American diplomats who are in Cuba are reporting back to, um, to Washington.\n\nAnd so in March of '58 the, the US, announces that it will stop sending weapons to Batista's army.\n\nAnd that really demoralizes the army.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: So how does Castro come down from the mountains?\n\nAnd why is he selected?\n\nOr is he selected...\n\nWere the other people selected to lead the government and not him?\n\nFERRER: Yeah well, one of the things that's interesting is that in the, in the revolutionary period there were people initially who, who were more popular at, than him, but a lot of them had been killed by then.\n\nSo the two other main young charismatic leaders were already dead by then.\n\nSo he comes down to the mountains.\n\nThere's a, there's a president who's a, a judge.\n\nUh, a progressive, you know, liberal judge.\n\nThere's a prime minister.\n\nThey all resigned.\n\nBasically, you know, it's interesting 'cause Americans always think about Castro's communist revolution, right?\n\nBut nobody knew what it was gonna be in January of 1959.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: All right, so he becomes prime minister in the new government, is that right?\n\nFERRER: Yeah.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: But then why does he resign as prime minister?\n\nFERRER: Because, you know, this all feels so new.\n\nAnd the question of communism is starting to come up.\n\nEspecially, he, he passes a...\n\nThere's an Agrarian Reform Law that's passed that confiscates some US, uh, some large land holdings.\n\nThat's in May of '59.\n\nAfter that the, the accusations of communism, uh, increase.\n\nAnd so some people in the government who were very anti-Batista and very revolutionary were not happy with the idea of the government becoming communist.\n\nAnd so that starts to be what the struggle is about.\n\nSo Fidel Castro resigns.\n\nPeople come out in the streets saying, \"Fidel come back.\n\nPrime minister you resign.\"\n\nThen the prime minister resigns.\n\nAnd eventually Castro comes back as we all know.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: He comes back and when does he say, \"Guess what?\n\nI really am a communist.\"\n\nFERRER: In late summer 1960 and early fall, you get, um, you get massive confiscations of US property.\n\nAnd I think after that there really was no turning back.\n\nAnd then he finally says that the revolutionist communist as the Bay of Pig's Invasion is unfolding.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: Then, um, Eisenhower on his last day as he's president as reviewing a plan that the CIA has under which there's gonna be some infiltration, um, back in Cuba by former Cubans, but not necessarily an invasion.\n\nFERRER: Right.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: An, an infiltration to kind of, um, maybe do something that might eventually change the government.\n\nHow does he get converted from that to an invasion under President Kennedy?\n\nFERRER: Yeah, the, the plan first started in March of 1960 as a plan of covert action.\n\nAnd as you said, it was infiltration.\n\nThere was no invasion planned initially.\n\nOr no major invasion.\n\nUh, it starts to change even before Kennedy comes to power.\n\nAnd it starts to change because the, the planners are worried that, that, that Castro's amassing too much power too quickly.\n\nAnd that he's getting weapons from, from different places too quickly.\n\nAnd that if they're going to depose them, it has to happen now.\n\nAnd that the, an invasion they thought would be quicker and faster than trying to infiltrate and work on guerrilla war.\n\nAnd it was... RUBENSTEIN: But, it was the CIA that largely developed a plan.\n\nAnd the CIA basically convinces President Kennedy to go ahead.\n\nFERRER: Mm-hmm.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: Kennedy says, \"I'm not gonna provide air cover.\n\nUh, go ahead and do it.\n\nBut I, I don't wanna have the air cover.\"\n\nBut do the people coming in from, where they're, they're leading the attack, do they know that Kennedy said there's no air cover?\n\nFERRER: No.\n\n'Cause the idea was that, that, that the, the US government would take out, would go and send planes ahead of time and then, uh, attack Cuban air bases and destroy the Cuban's ability to attack them.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: So how many Cubans, uh, Cuban refugees, uh, come back and lead the Bay of Pigs?\n\nFERRER: Um, about 1,400.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: All right, it didn't work.\n\nIt was poorly conceived.\n\nUm, Kennedy, uh, basically goes on TV and takes, uh, responsibility.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: So let's go forward to the Cuban missile crisis.\n\nKennedy meets with Khrushchev in Vienna.\n\nIt's a disastrous meeting.\n\nKhrushchev thinks that Kennedy's weak and not strong enough.\n\nAnd he decides to take advantage of it.\n\nSo he decides to put nuclear weapons in to Cuba.\n\nFERRER: Yeah.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: Um, and when Castro's told about that does he say it's a good idea?\n\nOr he says, \"I'm not responsible for nuclear weapons.\n\nI don't really want those.\"\n\nFERRER: Oh, he thinks it's a great idea.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: Okay.\n\nFERRER: Yeah, I mean, 'cause both, both Khrushchev and Castro thought that, that another invasion was coming.\n\nAnd that when another invasion came, there's no way it would be as badly planned as the first one.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: So, Kennedy convenes a group of people in the, uh, the White House and his cabinet called the Ex-Com, the Executive Committee.\n\nAnd they ultimately come up with a solution, which is to quarantine... FERRER: Yeah.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: Uh, future Soviet... FERRER: Mm-hmm.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: Um, ships coming in with the nuclear parts, but also asking or telling Khrushchev he has to take the military, uh, nuclear weapons out.\n\nFERRER: Right.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: So how did that happen?\n\nFERRER: It was, um, an agreement to remove American missiles from Turkey.\n\nSo in exchange for that, uh, Khrushchev said he would take the missiles out of Cuba.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: So was Khrushchev...\n\nThe Soviets had said, \"You have, uh, weapons in, and missiles in Turkey.\n\nWe feel insecure about that.\"\n\nFERRER: Right.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: So after that happened, uh, the relations between, uh, the United States and Cuba didn't get any better, right?\n\nFERRER: Mm-mm.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: So from, let's say 1962, all the way till his death, Castro basically was in control of the country.\n\nHow did he keep control for such a long period of time?\n\nDid he have military, uh, people everywhere watching everybody or did he put people in jail?\n\nDid he kill people?\n\nHow did he keep power for such a long period of time?\n\nFERRER: So in the beginning, Castro was really popular.\n\nThere was a survey done initially and he had like 92% approval rating, right?\n\nThat had declined already by the time of the missile crisis.\n\nBut, but he still had a majority of, of Cuban, uh, people with him at that point.\n\nAnd if anything, things like the Bay of Pigs rallied Cubans who had some doubts to his side because they saw the American invasion and said, \"Wait, we don't wanna be invaded.\"\n\nThe relationship with the Soviet Union meant that there was a level of, of, of modest, very modest wellbeing.\n\nUh, and it's really...\n\nThere are moments...\n\nThere are, there are moments when there's public discontent that erupts.\n\nOne really important one is in 1980.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: Yes, um, when President Carter was president, uh, uh, Castro opened the prisons and sent out, uh, about 125,000 people.\n\nNot all from the prisons.\n\nFERRER: Right.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: But, uh, people had medical problems and other things.\n\nWhy did he do that?\n\nWhy did he release all those people?\n\nFERRER: Yeah, that occurred just about a year after family visits had, had started.\n\nAnd I think that's really, really important.\n\nUh, Cubans who'd left the island had never been allowed to go back.\n\nAnd in 19...\n\nIn the late '70s, the, they, they were suddenly allowed to go back.\n\nAnd they went back, you know, with pictures of nice cars and they brought a lot of gifts and money.\n\nAnd it created a sense of expectation and also doubts about the government.\n\n\"Wait, the government has been telling us that these people who left are horrible, horrible people, but they're people just like us.\"\n\nAnd so that created a lot of kind of desire to leave.\n\nAnd in, um, 1980 in May, a group of people stormed the Peruvian embassy.\n\nThey stole a city bus and crashed through the gates, uh, asking for asylum.\n\nAnd, Castro wanted them back from the, from the embassy.\n\nThe embassy said no.\n\nAnd Castro said, \"Whoever wants to leave, can leave.\"\n\nAnd he opened the gates...\n\nHe removed security.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: Right, right.\n\nFERRER: And within like 48 hours or something, there were, there were thousands of people.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: Right.\n\nFERRER: There were like 10,000 people ready to leave, but no one knew how to get rid of them.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: So if you had had the chance to interview Fidel Castro and could ask him one question, what would that one question be?\n\nFERRER: Hmm.\n\nUh, I'm not sure what question I would ask him.\n\nBut I was just in Miami visiting my 100-year-old father who has a sixth grade education but always liked to write, took to writing in life.\n\nAnd I just went through, you know, all these papers.\n\nAnd he has dozens and dozens of letters that he wrote to Fidel Castro, all of them unanswered, and I said, um, \"What did you say to Fidel Castro in the letters?\"\n\n'Cause there were so many.\n\nI hadn't read them yet.\n\nAnd my father said, \"Everybody makes mistakes.\"\n\nAnd I thought that was just great.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: Okay.\n\nFERRER: Anyway.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: So your question to Castro will be, is there anything you would've done differently?\n\nDid you think he made a mistake?\n\nFERRER: That, that is a great question, yeah.\n\nRUBENSTEIN: Right.\n\nOkay, look it's a really interesting discussion about, Cuba.\n\nThank you very much for this conversation.\n\nFERRER: Thank you, thank you.\n\n(music plays through credits) ♪ ♪"
