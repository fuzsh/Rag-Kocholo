        "text": "In the Bible, the table represents hospitality and a place where believers come together. In the same spirit, the Evangelical Immigration Table is a place where evangelical Christians of various denominations, theological traditions, ethnicities, and political perspectives can gather together, united by Christ.\n\nAs the National Association of Evangelicals notes, evangelicals are people who take the Bible seriously and believe in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. The term “evangelical” comes from the Greek word euangelion, meaning “the good news” or the “gospel.” Thus, the evangelical faith focuses on the “good news” of salvation brought to sinners by Jesus Christ. Evangelicals are a vibrant and diverse group, and include believers from many different denominations and with many different perspectives. Our core theological convictions provide unity in the midst of our diversity and they define us – rather than political, social, or cultural trends.”"
