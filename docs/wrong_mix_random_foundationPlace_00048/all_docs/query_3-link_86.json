        "text": "The Mallorcan, current Roland Garros and Australian Open champion, will be looking for his 13th title on the RCTB-1899 clay\n\nThe ATP 500 of Barcelona will count with the participation of the numbers 1 and 2 of the ATP ranking\n\nRafa Nadal has consolidated his position this year as the tennis player who has won the most Grand Slam titles in history with 22 and next season he has confirmed his participation in the Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell – Conde de Godó Trophy, which will be held from 15 to 23 April 2023 on the courts of the RCTB-1899. The Barcelona ATP 500 has already confirmed the participation of the top two players in the ATP ranking (Carlos Alcaraz and Rafa Nadal) and the organisers are working to celebrate the tournament’s 70th anniversary with an historic edition.\n\nThe Mallorcan tennis player is still in top condition at the age of 36 and will start the new year as number two in the ATP ranking with the ambition of continuing to expand his legend. Rafa Nadal has a very special bond with the Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell: he has won the title 12 times, has won 66 matches, the centre court bears his name and he has been a member of the club since his time as a child. In addition, the Rafa Nadal Foundation has joined forces with the Barcelona Tennis Foundation to promote the “Play All” programme, which has an annual calendar full of projects to help children and young people at risk of social exclusion.\n\nDavid Ferrer, the tournament’s sports director, is very proud to have his friend and former rival taking part in the tournament. “Rafa is the best player in the history of the sport and the symbol of our tournament. To be able to continue enjoying him in Barcelona is a blessing and something that, on a personal level, makes me very excited and very happy”, he said with great emotion.\n\nThe Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell is a synonym of tradition, spectacle and the best tennis. During its 70 years of history, the best racquets in the world have passed through its courts and the tradition of a club like the RCTB-1899 has allowed the discovery of young talents who have become fabulous tennis players. In recent years, the tournament has served to discover players such as Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Carlos Alcaraz, who have played in the last finals (2018, 2019, 2021 and 2022)."
