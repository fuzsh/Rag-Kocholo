        "text": "Spanish tennis player David Ferrer, currently ranked sixth in the world, was knocked out of the Sony Ericsson tournament in Key Biscayne yesterday by American Mardy Fish. Though, Ferrer directed his angriest swing toward a crying baby in the stand. Yep, the guy actually sort of tried to hit a baby with a tennis ball because it was screaming.\n\nFerrer was playing poorly before the young child became upset. But when the baby started screaming at the top of its lungs, it didn't help Ferrer's already frustrated mood.\n\nBetween sets Ferrer lobbed a ball purposefully into the crowds. It didn't come close to the baby, but Ferrer was booed quite loudly. As SportsGrid put it, \"Ferrer was a foreign player, playing an American, in America, and hit a tennis ball at an American baby.\" And nobody messes with America's babies!\n\nMaybe Ferrer misunderstood the baby's whines. Maybe the baby is actually the world's biggest Ferrer fan and was just upset to see its hero losing so badly.\n\nOf course, tennis audiences are expected to keep quiet during sets. The sport isnt exactly the most family friendly sporting outing for that reason. For what it's worth, the baby did eventually simmer down.\n\nWe also can't help but point out a story in The Herald originally claimed Fish, the American, was guilty of lobbing the ball at the baby. They ran a correction today.\n\nFollow Miami New Times on Facebook and Twitter @MiamiNewTimes."
