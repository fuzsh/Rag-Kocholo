Website hosting\n\nWe host our website at Hetzner Online GmbH. Provider is Hetzner Online GmbH, Industriestr. 25, 91710 Gunzenhausen (hereinafter Hetzner Online). When you visit our website, Hetzner Online collects various log files, including your IP addresses. Details can be found in the privacy policy of Hetzner Online: https://www.hetzner.com/de/legal/privacy-policy\n\nIONOS is used on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. We have a legitimate interest in presenting our website as reliably as possible. If a corresponding consent has been requested, the processing takes place exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 para. 1 TTDSG, insofar as the consent includes the storage of cookies or access to information in the user's terminal device (e.g. device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time.\n\nOrder processing\n\nWe have concluded a contract for order processing (DPA) with the above-mentioned provider.\n\nThis is a contract prescribed by data protection law that ensures that it processes the personal data of our website visitors only in accordance with our instructions and in compliance with the GDPR.\n\n3. What data do we collect and store and for what purposes?\n\na) When visiting the website for information purposes only,\n\nIf you just look at our website, do not register and do not enter any other data or actively send us, then we process the personal data that your browser transmits to our server. These are stored without you doing anything until they are automatically deleted. What information is this? This can be found below:\n\nIP address of the requesting computer,\n\nDate and time of access, time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)\n\nContent of the request (visited page)\n\nAccess Status/HTTP Status Code\n\namount of data transferred in each case\n\nBrowser\n\nOperating system\n\nLanguage and version of the browser software.\n\nWe use the above-mentioned data for the operation of our website, in particular to detect and eliminate errors of the website, to determine the utilization of the website and to make adjustments and improvements. The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para.1 sentence 1 lit.f GDPR. Our legitimate interest follows from the aforementioned purposes for data collection. Under no circumstances do we use the collected data for the purpose of drawing conclusions about your person. Also, the data is not merged with other data sources.\n\nThe aforementioned personal data will only be stored for the duration of your visit. They will then be deleted immediately.\n\nIf we use external links on our pages that redirect you to other service providers, you can recognize this by the link symbol for external links, i.e. the mouse pointer changes its shape when it is on a link and the link to which it is redirected appears at the bottom left of the website. If you click on an external link, your IP address will be visible to the provider of the page.\n\nb) When contacted by e-mail and/or contact form\n\nYou can contact us via the email address provided or the contact form. In this case, the data you provide (your e-mail address, your name and telephone number and other information provided by you) will be stored in order to process your request and answer your questions. If the request is assigned to a contract, we delete the data arising in this context after the periods for the term of the contract, otherwise after 72 months (according to GoBD), or restrict the processing if there are statutory storage obligations.\n\nPlugins and tools on our website\n\nYouTube with enhanced privacy\n\nThis website embeds videos via YouTube, which is operated by Google Ireland Limited. We use YouTube's extended privacy mode, which prevents information about visitors to this website from being stored before they play a video. However, this mode does not necessarily exclude the transfer of data to YouTube partners. YouTube will still connect to the Google DoubleClick network, whether you play a video or not.\n\nWhen you play a YouTube video on this website, a connection to YouTube's servers is established and YouTube is informed about which pages you have visited. If you are logged in to YouTube, YouTube can assign your surfing behavior directly to your profile. You can prevent this by logging out of YouTube.\n\nIn addition, after playing a video, YouTube may store cookies or similar technologies (e.g. device fingerprinting) on your device in order to obtain information about visitors to this website. This information is used, among other things, to collect video statistics, improve the user experience and prevent fraud. Other data processing operations may also be triggered over which we have no influence.\n\nThe use of YouTube on this website serves the appealing presentation of our online offers and represents a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. If we obtain appropriate consent, the processing takes place exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO and § 25 para. 1 TTDSG, provided that the consent includes the storage of cookies or access to information in the user's terminal device (e.g. device fingerprinting) in accordance with TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time.\n\nFurther information about data protection at YouTube can be found in their privacy policy at: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de\n\nGoogle Fonts (local hosting)\n\nIn order to ensure a uniform representation of fonts, this site uses Google Fonts provided by Google. The Google Fonts are installed locally on the page, so no connection to Google servers is established.\n\nFurther information about Google Fonts can be found under https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq and in Google's privacy policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de\n\nAdobe Fonts\n\nIn order to display the fonts on this website uniformly, web fonts from Adobe are used. The provider of the web fonts is Adobe Systems Incorporated, based in the USA. When you visit this website, the required fonts are downloaded directly from Adobe to your device. This establishes a connection to Adobe's servers, whereby Adobe becomes aware that your IP address has accessed this website. Adobe says it does not store cookies when providing the fonts.\n\nThe storage and analysis of the data is carried out on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR, since the website operator has a legitimate interest in the uniform representation of the typeface. If a corresponding consent has been requested, the processing takes place exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 para. 1 TTDSG, provided that the consent includes the storage of cookies or access to information in the user's terminal device (e.g. device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TTDSG. This consent can be revoked at any time.\n\nThe data transfer to the USA takes place on the basis of the standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission.
