        "text": "Development of the theoretical system architecture of the CLARA software, which guides financial service providers' clerks through the compliance process for customer onboarding. As a founder, I have been a part of the company from it's inception on and participated in conceiving the product idea, finding investment and funding, and was a central part of development of the product as a team leader.\n\nDevelopment of the entire product concept from workflow & user journey to functional scope & interface design through to the implementation plan. Leading the six-person IT team in product development and the internal and external marketeers in the development of campaign concepts. Regular reporting to the company management, deadline and release management\n\nEstablishment of a successful online marketing agency. Development of the (digital) corporate strategy, team building and management, conception and implementation of several major projects, including for the Austrian Chamber of Agriculture and the traditional company Rustler, as well as dozens of smaller projects for medium-sized companies\n\n(Key) account and project management for app and SAAS solutions for large companies such as Henkel, Siemens and Österreichische Hagelversicherung. Promotion and innovation management as well as product design for new digital services, company organization and digitalization\n\nConception & roll-out of largely Microsoft-based (SharePoint) solutions to increase the efficiency of corporate organization for large companies such as PORR, Böhringer-Ingelheim, Bayer, RHI and others throughout Europe. Excel & Power Pivot training and coaching for controllers and analysts at Atos IT Systems, Rewe, Agrana, Mayr-Melnoff, Deloitte and others.\n\nThrough eight years of experience as an IT consultant, coach and trainer for international corporations as well as medium-sized and smaller companies, I not only know the applications of Microsoft Office (2008-2016 & 365) extremely well, but also have experience with a variety of their application situations - from group-wide controlling to workflow-supported, standardized Europe-wide cloud solutions.\n\nThroughout my career, I have been able to get to know a variety of software solutions for web design, product design, corporate design, UX / UI design, file management, customer relationship and project management and social media management. Being responsible for coordinating teams of up to 15 people meant that I not only got to know the programs from an application perspective, but was also able to assess their strategic and organizational benefits.\n\nI was also able to gain valuable experience in the field of social media management by working on medium-sized projects, some of which had a high public profile. I got to know - and appreciate - all the internal management solutions of the individual platforms, as well as efficiency-enhancing third-party service provider solutions.\n\nFor just over three years, I worked on a doctorate in philosophy in the field of \"intercultural philosophy\". This included several stays in Mexico to research the indigenous philosophy of the Aztecs.\n\nAfter two semesters of sociology, I realized that I was primarily interested in the preconditions for our knowledge. I studied philosophy, as the study of the \"architecture\" of knowledge and the method of its realization, with great dedication - and I notice every day in my professional life how beneficial its teachings still are.\n\nDuring my studies, I discovered my love, but also a certain talent, for writing in German. It is an amazing language, sublime and powerful. It can be used to outline the most complex concepts elegantly and with few epithets, and it can create multi-layered contextualities in a single sentence.\n\nAs much as I love German for its copiousness, I cherish English for its precision. It's highly resourceful and efficient while at the same time smooth and phonetically pleasant. It's a great tool to devise plans, structure and categorize ideas and elaborate on arguments."
