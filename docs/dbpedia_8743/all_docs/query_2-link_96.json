        "text": "We offer a lot in the field of ​​Tissue Dissociation, but what else does PELOBiotech offer?\n\nWe are more than competent4cells – and that also in the field of Tissue Dissociation. From quality products to fast delivery we are your competent cell culture experts.\n\nWe are the qualified, solution-oriented experts you have been looking for.\n\nWe provide you with one of the best cell portfolios for your research needs.\n\nWe fill the gap and build a bridge between innovative research and the special requests of the clinical sector.\n\nGet proficient recommendations and info first hand.\n\nTake the opportunity and trust our expertise and rely on our products in the field of Tissue Dissociation.\n\nPELOBiotech offers VITACYTE´s highly purified Enzymes for Academic and Clinical Use & Cell Therapy. Tissue Dissociation is used to isolate cells from tissues. The aim is to get the highest number of cells to the best possible quality for further experiments. A critical issue is the quality of used enzymes, purified or crude.\n\nTo overcome the disadvantages of crude enzymes, we offer only highly purified enzyme systems and guarantee that – once tested – these work every time in the same way. Results will be reproducible and further batch testing is redundant. PELOBiotech also says: „Custom Manufacturing is our daily business.”\n\nWe have put together an overview of the most common areas of application for you: Human Islet Applications, Rodent Islet Applications, Human Adipose Applications, Rodent Hepatocyte Applications and other Cells. Together with our global network of competent partners we strive for excellence.\n\nThat is why we are proud to offer so many high-quality, tested and highly purified enzyme products.\n\nCollagenase\n\nCollagenases are enzymes that digest collagen the major fibrous component of animal and human extracellular connective tissue. These enzymes are prepared from C. Histolyticum and are often used as crude enzyme preparation. The advantage of bacterial endopeptidases is that these enzymes will digest the insoluble collagen as well as soluble collagen fragments. The disadvantage of using crude collagenase preparations is the contaminating foreign enzyme activities (tryptic, caseinase and clostripain) which prevents reproducibility.\n\nAvoiding this batch testing procedure repeatedly would be a big step forward and improve productivity. Highly purified enzyme preparations will make this lot procedure unnecessary .\n\nThat is why we are proud to be able to offer you highly purified enzyme preparations.\n\nProtease\n\nThermolysin a neutral protease prepared from Bacillus thermoproteolyticus is a thermostable metalloproteinase used for isolation of islets from rodents, canine, monkey and human pancreas.\n\nWe are proud to offer you a wide variety of purified proteases. Among other high-quality Thermolysin products, even animal-free Thermolysin in GMP grade. This (animal component-free) is an aseptically dispensed, lyophilized purified protease from Bacillus thermoproteolyticus.\n\nFor Islet Research, Isolation & Transplantation.\n\nTogether with our strong partners in the field of tissue dissociation, we offer lots of tools for your pancreas & islet research. Protease Enzyme Mixtures Successfully Used For Human Islet Isolation. Purified bacterial collagenase and protease enzymes are commonly used to recover human islets from clinical-grade pancreata for subsequent clinical islet transplantation.\n\nBut the high cost of purified enzymes can often be prohibitive. In Summer 2019 VitaCyte, our partner for highly purified enzymes, successfully isolated islets from human research pancreata using enriched collagenase products supplemented with BP Protease (DE Collagenase 800 or Collagenase Gold-BP Protease mixtures) that cost significantly less than purified collagenase.\n\nAsk us to get your quality requirements and budget under an umbrella.\n\nMore on the many disadvantages of crude Enzymes.\n\nIn many labs crude enzymes are used which has the big disadvantage of enzymatic contamination. This leads to low reproducibility and the need to test every new batch for your application.\n\nTo overcome this situation enzymes have to be purified. In the last 20 years the key enzymes in crude collagenase responsible for the release of cells from tissues were identified as Collagenase (C. Histolyticum) class I and II, neutral protease (C. Histolyticum) and clostripain.\n\nThe need for the development of purified collagenase was driven by clinical research scientists who needed to increase human islet yields for use in islet transplantation into adult patients with diabetes type I since the mid-1990s.\n\nSo keep that in mind: The success of cell isolation from solid tissues is dependent on the quality of the enzymes (collagenase and neutral protease) being used.\n\n\"I reached out to PELObiotech to get a specific cell line + the optimal cell culture medium for our laboratory and Dr. Arista was the one assisting me in this whole process. Their response time was incredibly fast, their customer services more than satisfactory and their planning ahead made the whole order/delivery process of the items (they had to be imported from the USA) smooth, efficient and once again, very fast. Pleasantly surprised that we can still find this type of customer service/approach nowadays. 10/10 would recommend!”"
