        "text": "News and events modules\n\nNews and Events functionality is already included in a basic Contao installation. In only a few simple steps a fully functional news area with comments, RSS-feed, archive and multiple topic channels is set up. List views or calendars for events are equally simple to configure. News or event posts can be created using module-specific settings or using default content elements, which allows for great flexibility.\n\nNewsletter module\n\nThis streamlined module provides an easy newsletter registration and distribution. Visitors to the website can choose to subscribe to one or more newsletter channels via double-opt-in. Every newsletter can be sent as HTML or plain text with an individual input area for each version.\n\nForm generator\n\nThe powerful form generator provides all common form elements such as input and select fields, check-boxes, radio buttons, text areas, file upload, hidden fields and much more. Even complex forms can easily be created.\n\nUser and permissions management\n\nContao categorically separates users (backend access for input and management of content) and members (frontend access for viewing and downloading of content). Using frontend modules, a password-protected section of the website can be set up, not only providing members with login/logout but also optional account registration, password reminder, editing of personal member details and cancellation of accounts. Optionally, both logins can be secured by a two-factor-authentification.\n\nBack-end rights can be set on several levels, may it be for editors or administrators with limited or full access privileges. They can be defined on a page, article or the file management level.\n\nMulti-lingual and multiple websites\n\nWith Contao multiple websites can be comfortably set up in a single installation. For each site language and layout themes can be individually configured and domains assigned.\n\nSearch engine optimization (SEO)\n\nContao caters for all-important aspects of search engine optimisation and is ideal for on-page-SEO, providing among others:\n\nclean source code\n\nmeaningful URLs and page titles\n\nindividual alternative text and title text input for images\n\ntools for internal cross-links\n\nautomated generation of XML sitemap\n\nGoogle Analytics and Matomo connectivity\n\nmeta references\n\nAdministrative planning\n\nBesides the strict rules for version naming with respect to the backward compatibility (semantic versioning) Contao follows a defined release plan. Each February and August a new feature release is published; bugfixes are released on demand.\n\nAdditionally, every two years, a long term support release (LTS) is released which is supported for four years.\n\nFlexible expandability\n\nWith version 4, Contao is based on the full-stack Symfony framework and on Composer. Developers are able to use more than 100’000 PHP packages and Symfony bundles for developing contao extensions.\n\nUsing the system-independent Contao Manager and the Composer Resolver Cloud, Contao itself and all extensions can be installed and updated within a graphical user interface (GUI).\n\nAdvantages and characteristics\n\nThe greatest advantage of Contao is the powerful and expandable system architecture. Apart from “classic” websites Contao also supports and caters for highly demanding projects. Webspace requirements are still minimal so that even basic hosting packages are sufficient for smaller Contao projects.\n\nIn the German-speaking regions there is a large and dedicated support-community which drives the development of Contao and its free extensions. For the daily work, a great choice of Contao documentation is available, such as the editors’ guide, the designers’ textbook, video training and the official community forum.\n\nThe friendly and problem-solving oriented dialog in the community forum makes for a valuable first point of contact for exchange, know-how and support. For professional support more than 330 registered Contao partners from 13 countries are available in the categories web design, seminars, development and hosting.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nContao does not natively cater for building large-scale online communities with self-contained blog, forum or content creation by frontend users. However, there are extensions enabling some of those features in Contao.\n\nCulture of dialog\n\nIn addition to the community forums several activities enable the dialog between users, developers, the Contao team and those interested, whether it is the annual Contao Conference or the Contao Camp. Many larger cities host a regular get-together.\n\nThe members of the Contao Association further promote and support the development and dialog with users.\n\nWho can use Contao?\n\nContao is suitable for everybody who aims to create a professional website. The CMS is known by its versatility and adapts very flexibly to varying requirements."
