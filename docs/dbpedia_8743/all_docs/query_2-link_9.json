        "text": "This project will contain, among other component and widget developments, a Responsive Web Design (RWD) Theme created for the Contao (formerly TYPOlight, originally begun by Leo Feyer) CMS environment.\n\nWhile the latest copy of the Contao CMS server, at the time of this writing, is 4.0.2 this project has remained in the older version. This is partly due to both the lack of documentation and the fact that the mechanics have been completely revamped to use the Symfony2 framework instead of entirely Contao's own proprietary code.\n\nContao was produced in Germany and has the added advantage to the German's by having a number of their official documenations available in the local language. Of course, their English documentation is also extensive. This is an alternative to using WordPress and/or Joomla! CMSes.\n\nWeb Server (e.g. Apache or IIS)\n\nMySQL 5.0.3 (minimal support)\n\nPHP 5.3.7 (minimal support)\n\nPHP Additional Modules\n\nGDlib (image resizing)\n\nDOM (XML file support)\n\nSOAP (Extension Repository)\n\nPhar (for internal Live Update engine)\n\nmbstring (optional, but highly advised when dealing with multi-byte character sets)\n\nmcrypt (optional for data encryption)\n\nContao 3.5.2 CMS\n\nThe official documentation for the installation of Contao can be found on their documenation page. It is briefly reiterated here for the sake of easy and summarized access. It will also contain additional issues that occurred during the building of this particular project.\n\nDependent on your server configuration, the public folder can most likely be found in one of the following 4 directories; htdocs, httpdocs, html or public_html.\n\nThe following step will require you to enter your login credentials; therefore, we should first create a database for your Contao website. Note that Contao's default character set is spelled as UTF-8 while with MySQL that would be writen as UTF8.\n\nThe install.php script in the root of your Contao website can be used to help automate your installation. In the event that you mistype your password three times, Contao will lock down the system. Should this occur, then you will manually be required to remove the lock with a text editor located in the following file; system/config/localconfig.php. Within this file, you will have to set the following code to the value of 0.\n\nDuring the installation process, we are not only requested for the credentials, connectivity and name of your database, but you will also receive suggestions about altering your database tables. This is more likely to occur when upgrading your Contao, while using a legacy database.\n\nHere we casual go over Themes and Templates as the focus is now installation. Please see the Themes and Frontend Templates for more information.\n\nWARNING: Importing a template will replace existing data. Since version 3.2.11 the sample web-page is no longer distributed with the core download. There are two optional manners to download the older templates Contao Official Demo or the old Music Academy can be installed as an extension.\n\nInstallation of the Demos\n\nCreate a new Contao installation with the admin account\n\nLog in as admin to the backend\n\nInstall the matching extension from the extension repository\n\nLog out of the backend\n\nOpen the install.php tool again\n\nTo import the template, select the entry from the drop-down menu and click the \"Import template\" button.\n\nNOTE: The administrative backend will be your server's administrative directory plus /contao (i.e. http://localhost/contao\\).\n\nInteresting thing about the documentation, it says that if you did not import a template (theme) then you are required to create an administrative account in order to complete the installation process. Otherwise, if you are using the example website then you would use the user name supplied there in:\n\nUser Name : k.jones\n\nPassword : kevinjones\n\n@TODO add a link or mention about creating a template from scratch to this section.\n\nBasically, both are fairly similar with few differences. Both are viewed as handy for Search Engine Optimisation (\\SEO) and eventually for bring more visitors to your site. Some systems define a slug as the part of a URL which identifies a page using human-readable keywords. It is usually the end part of the URL, which can be interpreted as the name of the resource, similar to the basename in a filename or the title of a page.\n\nThere are multiple ways to accomplish this. When using the Apache Web Server in unison with Contao, you can use the mod_rewrite (module plugin for Apache that rewrites URLs automatically), which is configured in the Apache's .htaccess file. Contao uses a file named .htaccess.default found in it's root directory. If you can't configure that manually, you will want to move or rename the Contao default settings to just a normal .htaccess file and do the following. NOTE: On POSIX systems, files beginning with a period are hidden from normal file viewers.\n\nSelect the \"Rewrite URLs\" in the \"Front end configuration\" section and save your work. Now Contao will generate static URLs like home.html instead of index.php?id=12.\n\nKEYWORDS : Reciprocal Links, BackLinks, Link Exchanges, trackback_url() for WordPress, mod_rewrite, 301 Redirects, Pingback (a link contained in a post).\n\nBriefly, to overcome issues with PHP having write access to certain directories, while running the install.php script mentioned above Contao will set permissions to chmod 777, giving write and execute permission to the following directories every system user and they strongly advise against making changes to these settings;\n\nassets/images\n\nassets/images/*\n\nsystem/logs\n\nsystem/tmp\n\nThe back-end of Contao expects you to be running an File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server and allows you to modify your files via PHP's FTP functions.\n\nBacking up the following files and two directories will save your local configuration, custom templates and files.\n\nfiles/*\n\nsystem/config/dcaconfig.php\n\nsystem/config/initconfig.php\n\nsystem/config/langconfig.php\n\nsystem/config/localconfig.php\n\ntemplates/*\n\nAttention: If you have installed any third-party extensions, make sure to backup and restore them, too, or do not overwrite them at all. Otherwise, you will need to reinstall the modules and depending on the behavior of the extension you could run the risk of losing valuable data.\n\nIn the back-end you can go to \"Maintenance\", check \"Purge the internal cache\" in the \"Purge data\" section. After a subsequent confirmation that you wish to purge data, you will need to click the \"Build the cache\" in the header.\n\nLive Update pg 12\n\nA website design is normally controlled by the following elements; stylesheets, frontend modules (that which the visitor of the website sees), page layouts (controlled by HTML and stylesheets), files (e.g. javascript, images and videos) and templates. The integrated theme manager does not change the common approach to separating the elements of a website.\n\nThe Contao CMS' backend has interfaces for dealing with all these elements. As we mentioned before, Contao likes to side-step possible user rights issues by providing an integrated FTP client for modifying and uploading files.\n\nThe main difference between a theme and a frontend template is that the later contains a fully preconfigured example website. That's right, the template includes such things as an exemplary site-structure, articles, content elements and even preconfigured users and user-groups. In comparison, a theme, consists only of the actual website design; this gives it the advantage of not overwriting existing data when imported.\n\nWith the Theme Configuration Tool one is capable of exporting a Theme which has been created or import one from a file name ended with .cto. A CTO file is simply a compiled .zip file, so one can change the name and examine the contents of said compiled import/export files. Realize that these .cto files are comprised of Theme components.\n\nImporting a theme does not endanger your current data; however Frontend Templates would. In order to import the .cto file to your Contao installation, you will need to open the Theme Manager and click on the link labeled \"Theme import\". You can import multiple themes at once. Once the import process is completed, you may then assign the page layout(s) of the new theme in the site structure.\n\nTheme components are stored within the database instead of via flat-files;\n\nStyle Sheets (nomenclature prefix standards: \"ce_\" for Content Elements and \"mod_\" for Module classes)\n\nFrontEnd Modules\n\nPage Layouts (determine the basic layout of the page, which components are shown where)\n\nwhile of course it can also use flat-files, such as the following which would need to be coupled onto the theme within the backend theme configuration tool in order to assure they are included in any theme exports;\n\nImages\n\nFiles such as optional custom templates from the templates directory\n\nWithin the \"Theme Configuration Tool\" one must specify the title and author. Additional folders to include can be added optionally, as well as a screenshot and the path to a \"templates\" folder. Finally, something that Contao seems to make use of more than other CMSes is Global Variables. Within the tool, you can pack your theme with additional variables to be available over the entire site.\n\nContao also supplies a style sheet editor in the backend CMS.\n\n@TODO a good introduction\n\nAs similar to the CCK's Access Control, Contao also affords individual module access control. Each frontend module can be protected so only guests or memembers of a particular user's group can see it on the website; if deemed so necessary.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, in Contao jargon, Access Rights have no relationship to Access Controls which control the client's ability to see certain FrontEnd pages. Access rights determine the level of access to those with access in the backend. For further information , please see the official documentation.\n\nPermalinks in News Modules\n\nEach of the news/blog items has a unique URL (permalink) that can be used to reference it. For example, in the following URL, we find the partition \"/news\", which refers to the news module. The later part (slug) refers to the \"james-wilson-returns\", which is recorded as a reference entered in the related news table in the database. Without both of these parts in the URL, our permalink would return a 404 Not Found Error to the client.\n\nSimilarly, this would be the construction using the Event Reader module for a reference to an article called 'Final Exams':\n\nNote that the News related modules are marked with the prefix \"FrontEnd:\" which means that Access Rights can be applied to them. Additionally, Contao considers the functionality of the News Modules to be the same as that which would be expected of a similar (separate, but not here) Blog module.\n\nModule CSS Class Description Navigation Menu mod_navigation Generates a navigation menu from the site structure.

RSS reader mod_rss_reader Adds an RSS feed to a page.\n\nPage types determine if a page shows specific content, forwards the viewer to another page or defines the starting point of a new website within the page tree. Contao contains 6 standard page types found in the table below.\n\nPage Type Description Regular Page A regular page contains articles and content elements. It behaves like a static HTML page. External Redirect This type of page automatically redirects visitors to an external website. It works like a hyperlink. Internal Redirect This type of page automatically forwards visitors to another page within the site structure. Website Root This type of page marks the starting point of a new website within the site structure. 403 Access Denied If a user requests a protected page without permission, a 403 error page will be loaded instead. This page must be added on the first level inside your website root page. 404 Page Not Found If a user requests a non-existent page, a 404 error page will be loaded instead. This page must be added on the first level inside your website root page.\n\nContao supports multi-lingual websites. Here it is written as Multi-Domain Mode, but this is in part due to the fact that first the settings of a domain name are taken into an account. If that domain name exists in only one language, it is served as such, but if there are multiple languages for one domain name, then Contao will first query the client's web-browser's preferred language and act accordingly.\n\nNotice in the following listing if there is a 'fallback language' listed. Without that setting specified in the backend for all three domains/subdomain(s), the fallback would come to German.\n\nType DNS Language Code Fallback Language Corporate Website in German none de no Corporate Website in English none en yes Subdomain Website www.independent.example.org de yes\n\nGiven the settings above, the following chart shows to which domain a user would be redirected, depending upon the domain name which he or she called."
