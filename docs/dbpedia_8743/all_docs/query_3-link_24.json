A list of the supervisory authorities as well as their contact information can be found under the following link.\n\nYou can revoke your consent to the processing of personal data at any time.

The prerequisite for this is that the data processing is in the public interest or based on a consideration of interests. This also applies to any profiling. In case of objection, we will no longer process your personal data, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing of these data which override your interests, rights and freedoms or if your personal data serve the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\n\nb) Objection against the processing of your data for direct marketing\n\nIn specific cases, we will use your personal data for our direct marketing. You have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.

Our data privacy statement therefore does not cover such websites.\n\n17 - Terms of Use for Communication via the messenger WhatsApp on the subject of Apprenticeship and Dual Studium\n\nThe WhatsApp Corporation based in California is the sole owner and operator of the WhatsApp communication channel. 50Hertz Transmission GmbH has no influence on the scope of data collection and the further processing and use of the data by WhatsApp. For further information, please refer to the privacy policy and terms of use of WhatsApp, which can be found at https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/.\n\nWe therefore ask you to send us only general enquiries about training and dual studies at 50Hertz via WhatsApp. Please do not send us any personal data or documents via WhatsApp. We only use WhatsApp to answer your questions about training and dual studies at 50Hertz.\n\nYour telephone number will not be used for any other purpose, in particular for advertising purposes.

Master data:\n\nWe process basic data about your person and the business relationship that exists with you, which together we refer to as “master data”. These in particular include\n\nany information that we need to establish the business relationship with you (your name, your title, your email address, possibly your date of birth, nationality, VAT ID and other contact information),\n\nas well as any data we register at our end in connection with the establishment of the business relationship (in particular the details of the contracts concluded with you).\n\n2.2. History data:\n\nWe process personal data that are gathered during the business relationship that may be more than a mere change to your master data and which we refer to as “history data”. These in particular include\n\ninformation about the services you provided or were provided with, based on the contracts entered into,\n\ninformation about the services we provided or were provided with,\n\nbased on the contracts entered into, information that you provided us with during the business relationship (either actively or at our request),\n\npersonal data that we received during our business relationship from you or third parties in any other manner.\n\n3. For which purposes and on which legal basis do we process your data?\n\n3.1. Processing of master and history data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract based on art. 6 (1) lit. b) of the GDPR.\n\n3.2. We can also process master and history data if this is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject; this is done based on art. 6 (1) lit. c) of the GDPR. Such legal obligations in particular include our compulsory notifications to (tax) authorities.\n\n3.3. If necessary, we also process your personal data for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party; this is done based on art. 6 (1) lit. f) of the GDPR.

Are you obliged to provide data?\n\nThe provision of the master data and history data mentioned under item 2 is necessary to establish and develop the business relationship between you and us, unless expressly stated otherwise when registering these data.

Is automated decision-making used?\n\nDuring the establishment or the course of the business relationship, we generally do not use automated decision-making (including profiling) within the meaning of art. 22 of the GDPR. If we use such a method in individual cases, we will specifically inform you of this insofar as required by law.\n\n7. How long are your data saved?\n\nWe delete your data as soon as we no longer need them for the aforementioned purposes and there are no legal or contractual obligations of retention. The data will possibly only be deleted after the business relationship has ended. If we only save personal data to fulfil obligations of retention, we only access these when this is required for the purposes of the obligation of retention.\n\n8.
