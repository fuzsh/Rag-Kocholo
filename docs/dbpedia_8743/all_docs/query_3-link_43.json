All relevant personal data that you provide to us for the purpose of participating in the online training and, if applicable, associated documents (e.g. commercial letters, invoices) will be stored for a maximum of six to ten years after completion of the training in accordance with legal requirements and regulations.\n\n4.12 Login to the Intershop Service Portal (Service Now)\n\nAs a customer or partner, you can register at https://service.intershop.com to submit service requests, report problems or make suggestions for improvements. Detailed information on data protection can be found at https://www.intershop.com/en/privacy-policy/service-portal.\n\n4.13 When registering for a webinar\n\nFor the purpose of scheduling, organizing, and holding digital event formats, your personal data, such as your name and e-mail address, will be processed for organizational purposes before the event and, where applicable, for transmitting further information or answering questions about the event. The legal basis for this is the legitimate interest in accordance with point (f) of Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 GDPR in scheduling and holding the digital event properly.\n\nTo hold telephone conferences, online meetings, video conferences, and webinars (hereinafter: “online meetings”) we use the tool “Teams” from the US provider Microsoft Corporation. Depending on how and the extent to which “Teams” is used, different types of data are collected and processed. These particularly include personal information (e.g., first name and last name, e-mail address, profile picture), meeting metadata (e.g., date, time, and duration of the communication, name of the meeting, IP address of the participants), text, audio, and video data (e.g., chat records, video and audio playbacks), as well as connection data (e.g., telephone numbers, country names, start and end times, IP addresses).\n\nIf you participate in an online meeting as a guest, you will receive a link by e-mail from the host. When you log in to the online meeting, you must enter your name and, if necessary, your e-mail address. As a participant, you can participate in meetings directly via the browser without installing the Teams app. The same applies if holding the online meeting is necessary to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract. The tool also collects user data that are required to provide the available services and for technical and operational support and to make improvements. These particularly include technical data about your devices, your network, and your internet connection, such as IP address, MAC address, other device IDs, device type, operating system type and version, client version, camera type, microphone and speaker, or type of connection. The legal basis for this is the legitimate interest in accordance with point (f) of Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 GDPR in scheduling and holding the digital event properly.\n\nIt is necessary to provide the data stated above to log in and participate in the meeting. Failure to do so means you cannot participate.\n\nYou may enter additional personal data, but this is not required. Furthermore, you can use the chat, Q&A, or poll functions during the online meeting. You can also switch the camera on and off and mute the microphone yourself.\n\nIf you use the chat, Q&A, or poll function, the text you have entered will be processed in order to show and, where necessary, log this in the “online meeting.” If you switch on your camera or your microphone, the data from the microphone of your end device as well as any camera of the end device will be processed for the duration of the meeting. At the beginning of online meetings, your camera and microphone are always switched off as standard. Please note that all information that you or others upload, make available, or create during the meeting will be processed, at least for the duration of the meeting. This particularly includes chat/instant messages, files, whiteboards, and other information that is shared while the service is being used.\n\nMore information on the processing of your data when using “Teams” is available at: https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement.\n\nStorage duration/criteria for determining the storage duration\n\nWe only process your data as long as this is necessary for the purposes for which they were collected. After, your data will be erased, unless they are necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. In the event of legal retention obligations, data may only be erased after the respective retention obligation expires.\n\nYour data will generally be erased at the end of the event. Tax data are generally stored for 10 years based on legal retention periods.\n\nThe following storage and erasure durations apply to the data processed in Teams:\n\nAll user account data will generally be erased once the service has stopped being provided.\n\nIf you as a user have a user account, you can fully erase your user profile, including the data stored there about you, at any time.\n\nAdministrators in the controller’s account can fully erase the user profile of any user, including the data stored there, at any time.\n\nMedia sent between participants in a meeting room are not stored.\n\nAudio and video contents are processed in the stream and are not stored.\n\nChat messages are not permanently stored.\n\nTechnical logs/diagnostic information that have been stored are erased or anonymized after max. 90 days.\n\nRecipients of your data\n\nWe generally do not transmit your data to third parties. Data will only be passed on if they are specifically intended to be passed on, you have given your prior express consent to the transfer, or we are obliged or entitled to pass on the data based on legal provisions. Data may be passed on, for example, to other companies of the corporate group for the purposes of event management or as part of IT services.\n\nMicrosoft Ireland Operations Ltd and the Microsoft Corporation as the service provider and (sub) processor within the meaning of Art. 28 GDPR support us when processing your data and are strictly subject to our instructions. We cannot rule out your data being processed in third countries outside the EU or the EEA. For this data transfer, an adequate level of data protection is ensured by entering into the EU Standard Contractual Clauses and supplementary measures unless there is an adequacy decision within the meaning of Art 45 (3) GDPR for the third country involved."
