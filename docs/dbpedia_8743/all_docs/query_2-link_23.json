        "text": "A CMS (Content Management System) is used to create professional and dynamic website content. Creating and maintaining a professional website is nowadays an indispensable part of business and contributes significantly to the company’s success. Especially the layman quickly loses the overview with up to 350 available programs: Which CMS is the right one for my online project?\n\nWe are going to draw a CMS comparison and show you the 5 best CMS platforms on the market.\n\nWhat is a content management system?\n\nA CMS is a piece of software. The software allows the user to create web content through a graphical user interface. Web content can be text, video or even images. A CMS is characterized by the fact that any website owner can collaboratively create, modify and publish dynamic content without any programming knowledge. For the purpose of running a professional website, there is no longer a need to master a programming language.\n\nOpen source or proprietary software? A comparison:\n\nMany content management systems are made available to users as open source. An open-source system or freely available codes are called an open-source platform. The open CMS usually does not include licensing costs and accordingly provides for a broad user community. Proprietary software, on the other hand, is created by companies and is generally marketed professionally as a commercial product. As a rule, the purchase of proprietary software is associated with licensing costs.\n\nThe 5 best CMS platforms\n\nWhen looking for the right CMS platform, it helps to take a look at the worldwide market share of the software used. Because basically, the more users the CMS has, the more community and expertise exists in the market that can help each other.\n\nProbably the best-known platform for creating website content is WordPress. With a worldwide market share of 65%, WordPress represents the largest open-source CMS platform. But other content management systems can also score.\n\nWe present the 5 most popular platforms:\n\nWordPress – Market share: Approx. 65%\n\nJoomla! – Market share: Approx. 3.5%\n\nDrupal – Market share: Approx. 2.4%\n\nContao – Market share: Approx. 2%\n\nTYPO3 – market share Approx. 0.5%\n\nWordPress\n\nOnce conceived as a blog system, the content management system has now grown into software suitable for all purposes with numerous extensions. More than 58,000 available plug-ins, search engine friendly URLs and application tools for optimized mobile views, make WordPress the most used CMS platform worldwide. The easy and user-friendly installation makes WordPress especially popular among bloggers.\n\nJoomla!\n\nJoomla! focuses its target audience on beginners as well as advanced users. The scope of application is somewhat more demanding than WordPress. Nevertheless, Joomla! can score with an active user forum and online manuals provided for the community. In particular, the professional community supports multiple languages, making the platform extremely popular with users.\n\nDrupal\n\nDrupal originally served as a student community solution. The open-source platform is freely accessible and scores with a simple basic installation that can be extended with various modules. Drupal focuses on social publishing and community projects. In addition, the platform offers over 1,300 distributions as a complete solution for typical use cases.\n\nContao\n\nThis CMS stands out for its user-friendliness. In addition, the software collects further plus points with a multilingual backend and an intuitively usable and clearly designed administration platform. Contao focuses on compatibility with web standards and a freely accessible provision of online content in HTML5.\n\nTYPO3\n\nTYPO 3 interprets itself as an enterprise management system and enjoys a high reputation, especially in German-speaking countries. A qualified team of developers is constantly improving the platform and bringing it up to date. Usually, large e-commerce companies resort to TYPO3 as their CMS.\n\nOutsourcing4work – Your partner for website development\n\nYou are still unsure which CMS is ideal for your online project?
