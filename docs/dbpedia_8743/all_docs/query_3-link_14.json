        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nWith the following information, we would like to give you as a \"data subject\" an overview of the processing of your personal data by us and your rights under the data protection laws. As a matter of principle, it is possible to use our Internet pages without entering personal data. However, if you want to use special services of our enterprise via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no legal basis for such processing, we will generally obtain your consent.\n\nThe processing of personal data, such as your name, address or e-mail address, is always in line with the German Data Protection Regulation (DS-GVO) and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to \"Alfred Becht GmbH\". By means of this data protection declaration, we would like to inform you about the scope and purpose of the personal data collected, used and processed by us.\n\nAs the controller, we have implemented numerous technical and organisational measures to ensure the most complete protection possible for the personal data processed via this website. Nevertheless, internet-based data transmissions can always have security gaps, so that absolute protection cannot be guaranteed. For this reason, you are also free to transmit personal data to us by alternative means, for example by telephone or by post.\n\nYou too can take simple and easy-to-implement measures to protect yourself against unauthorised access to your data by third parties. Therefore, we would like to give you some tips on how to handle your data securely:\n\nProtect your account (login, user or customer account) and your IT system (computer, laptop, tablet or mobile device) with strong passwords.\n\nOnly you should have access to the passwords.\n\nMake sure that you only use your passwords for one account (login, user or customer account) at a time.\n\nDo not use one password for different websites, applications or online services.\n\nEspecially when using publicly accessible IT systems or IT systems shared with other people, it is essential that you log out after each login to a website, application or online service.\n\nPasswords should consist of at least 12 characters and be chosen so that they cannot be easily guessed. Therefore, they should not contain common words from everyday life, one's own name or names of relatives, but upper and lower case, numbers and special characters.\n\n2. Responsible\n\nThe person responsible within the meaning of the DS-GVO is:\n\nAlfred Becht GmbH\n\nCarl-Zeiss-Str. 16\n\n77656 Offenburg\n\nDeutschland\n\nPhone: +49 781 60586-0\n\nFax: +49 781 60586-40\n\nE-mail: info@alfredbecht.de\n\nRepresentative of the person responsible: Mr Ulrich Becht\n\n3. Data Protection Commissioner\n\nYou can reach the data protection officer as follows:\n\nSandra Stahn\n\nPhone: +49 781 60586-0\n\nE-mail: datenschutz@alfredbecht.de\n\nYou can contact our data protection officer directly at any time with all questions and suggestions regarding data protection.\n\n4. Definitions\n\nThe data protection declaration is based on the terms used by the European Directive and Ordinance Maker when enacting the General Data Protection Regulation (DS-GVO). Our data protection declaration should be easy to read and understand for the public as well as for our customers and business partners. To ensure this, we would like to explain the terms used in advance.\n\nWe use the following terms, among others, in this data protection declaration:\n\nPersonal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.\n\nData subject is any identified or identifiable natural person whose personal data is processed by the controller (our company).\n\nProcessing is any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organisation, filing, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.\n\nRestriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their future processing.\n\nProfiling is any form of automated processing of personal data which consists in using such personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects relating to that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or change of location.\n\nPseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a way that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures which ensure that the personal data cannot be attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.\n\nProcessor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body that processes personal data on behalf of the controller.\n\nRecipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body to whom personal data are disclosed, whether or not a third party. However, public authorities that may receive personal data in the context of a specific investigative task under Union or Member State law shall not be considered as recipients.\n\nThird party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body other than the data subject, the controller, the processor and the persons authorised to process the personal data under the direct responsibility of the controller or the processor.\n\nConsent means any freely given and informed indication of the data subject's wishes in the form of a declaration or other unambiguous affirmative act by which the data subject signifies his or her agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.\n\n5. Legal basis of the processing\n\nArt. 6 para. 1 lit. a DS-GVO (in conjunction with § 25 para. 1 TTDSG) serves as the legal basis for our company for processing operations in which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose.\n\nIf the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party, as is the case, for example, with processing operations that are necessary for a delivery of goods or the provision of another service or consideration, the processing is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. b DS-GVO. The same applies to processing operations that are necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of enquiries about our products or services.\n\nIf our company is subject to a legal obligation by which the processing of personal data becomes necessary, such as for the fulfilment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. c DS-GVO.\n\nIn rare cases, the processing of personal data might become necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were to be injured on our premises and as a result his or her name, age, health insurance details or other vital information had to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. In this case, the processing would be based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. d DS-GVO.\n\nUltimately, processing operations could be based on Art. 6 (1) lit. f DS-GVO. Processing operations which are not covered by any of the aforementioned legal bases are based on this legal basis if the processing is necessary for the protection of a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are not overridden. Such processing operations are permitted to us in particular because they were specifically mentioned by the European legislator. In this respect, it took the view that a legitimate interest could be assumed if you are a customer of our company (recital 47 sentence 2 of the GDPR).\n\n6. Transmission of data to third parties\n\nYour personal data will not be transferred to third parties for purposes other than those listed below.\n\nWe will only disclose your personal data to third parties if:\n\nYou have given us your express consent in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a DS-GVO,\n\nthe disclosure is permissible in accordance with Art. 6 (1) lit. f DS-GVO to protect our legitimate interests and there is no reason to assume that you have an overriding interest worthy of protection in the non-disclosure of your data,\n\nin the event that there is a legal obligation for the transfer in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. c DS-GVO, and\n\nthis is legally permissible and necessary for the processing of contractual relationships with you according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DS-GVO.\n\nIn order to protect your data and to enable us to transfer data to third countries (outside the EU/EEA) if necessary, we have concluded commissioned processing agreements based on the standard contractual clauses of the European Commission. If the standard contractual clauses are not sufficient to establish an adequate level of security, your consent pursuant to Article 49 (1) a) of the GDPR may serve as the legal basis for the transfer to third countries. This sometimes does not apply in the case of a data transfer to third countries for which the European Commission has issued an adequacy decision pursuant to Art. 45 DS-GVO.\n\n7. Technology\n\n7.1 Cloudflare (Content Delivery Network)\n\nOur website uses functions from CloudFlare. The provider is CloudFlare, Inc. 665 3rd St. #200, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA.\n\nCloudFlare offers a globally distributed content delivery network with DNS. Technically, the transfer of information between your browser and our website is routed through CloudFlare's network. CloudFlare is thus able to analyse the data traffic between users and our websites, for example, in order to detect and ward off attacks on our services. In addition, CloudFlare may store cookies on your computer for optimisation and analysis.\n\nYou can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of cookies and only allow cookies in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or in general and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. If you deactivate cookies, the functionality of this website may be limited.\n\nWe have concluded a corresponding agreement with Cloudflare on the basis of the German Data Protection Regulation (DS-GVO) for commissioned processing or in accordance with EU standard contractual clauses. Cloudflare collects statistical data about visits to this website. The access data includes: Name of the accessed website, file, date and time of access, amount of data transferred, notification of successful access, browser type and version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page), IP address and the requesting provider. Cloudflare uses the log data for statistical evaluations for the purpose of the operation, security and optimisation of the offer.\n\nIf you have consented to Cloudflare being used, the legal basis for the processing of personal data is Art. 6 (1) lit. a DS-GVO. In addition, we have a legitimate interest in using Cloudflare to optimise our online offering and make it more secure. The corresponding legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DS-GVO. The personal data will be retained for as long as they are required to fulfil the purpose of the processing. The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer required to achieve the purpose.\n\nThe transfer of your personal data to the USA takes place on the basis of the standard contractual clauses.\n\nYou can find more information about CloudFlare at: https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/.\n\n8. Cookies\n\n8.1 General information about cookies\n\nCookies are small files that are automatically created by your browser and stored on your IT system (laptop, tablet, smartphone or similar) when you visit our site.\n\nInformation is stored in the cookie that results in each case from the context of the specific end device used. However, this does not mean that we gain direct knowledge of your identity.\n\nThe use of cookies serves to make the use of our offer more pleasant for you. We use so-called session cookies to recognise that you have already visited individual pages of our website. These are automatically deleted after you leave our site.\n\nIn addition, we also use temporary cookies to optimise user-friendliness, which are stored on your end device for a certain fixed period of time. If you visit our site again to use our services, it is automatically recognised that you have already been with us and which entries and settings you have made so that you do not have to enter them again.\n\nOn the other hand, we use cookies to statistically record the use of our website and to evaluate our offer for you for the purpose of optimisation. These cookies enable us to automatically recognise that you have already visited our website when you visit it again. The cookies set in this way are automatically deleted after a defined period of time. The respective storage period of the cookies can be found in the settings of the consent tool used.\n\n8.2 Legal basis for the use of cookies\n\nThe data processed by the cookies, which are required for the proper functioning of the website, are thus necessary to protect our legitimate interests as well as those of third parties in accordance with Art. 6 (1) lit. f DS-GVO.\n\nFor all other cookies, you must have given your consent to this via our opt-in cookie banner within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. a DS-GVO.\n\n8.3 Consent Manager (Consent Management Tool)\n\nWe use the consent management platform \"Consentmanager\" from consentmanager AB, Haltegelvägen 1b, 72348 Västeras, Sweden. This service enables us to obtain and manage the consent of website users for data processing.\n\nConsentmanager collects data generated by end users who use our website. When an end user gives consent, Consentmanager automatically logs the following data:\n\nBrowser information.\n\nDate and time of access.\n\nDevice information.\n\nThe URL of the page visited.\n\nBanner language.\n\nConsent ID.\n\nThe consent status of the end user, which serves as proof of consent.\n\nThe consent status is also stored in the end-user's browser so that the website can automatically read and follow the end-user's consent in all subsequent page requests and future end-user sessions for up to 12 months. Consent data (consent and withdrawal of consent) is stored for three years. The retention period corresponds to the regular limitation period according to § 195 BGB. The data will then be deleted immediately.\n\nThe functionality of the website is not guaranteed without the described processing. There is no possibility for the user to object as long as there is a legal obligation to obtain the user's consent to certain data processing operations (Artt. 7 para. 1, 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. c DS-GVO).\n\nConsentmanager is the recipient of your personal data and acts as an order processor for us. Data processing takes place exclusively in the European Union.\n\nDetailed information on the use of Consentmanager can be found at: https://www.consentmanager.de/datenschutz/.\n\n9. Contents of our website\n\n9.1 Contact us / Contact form\n\nPersonal data is collected when contacting us (e.g. via contact form or e-mail). Which data is collected in the case of the use of a contact form can be seen from the respective contact form. This data is stored and used exclusively for the purpose of answering your request or for contacting you and the associated technical administration. The legal basis for processing the data is our legitimate interest in responding to your request in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f DS-GVO. If your contact is aimed at concluding a contract, the additional legal basis for processing is Art. 6 (1) lit. b DS-GVO. Your data will be deleted after final processing of your request; this is the case if it can be inferred from the circumstances that the matter in question has been conclusively clarified and the deletion does not conflict with any statutory retention obligations.\n\n9.2 Application Management / job exchange\n\nWe collect and process the personal data of applicants for the purpose of processing the application procedure. The processing may also take place electronically. This is particularly the case if an applicant submits the relevant application documents to us electronically, for example by e-mail or via a web form on the website. If we conclude an employment or service contract with an applicant, the transmitted data will be stored for the purpose of processing the employment relationship in compliance with the statutory provisions. If we do not conclude a contract with the applicant, the application documents are automatically deleted six months after notification of the rejection decision, provided that no other legitimate interests on our part oppose deletion. Another legitimate interest in this sense is, for example, a duty to provide evidence in proceedings under the German Equal Treatment Act (Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz [AGG]).\n\nThe legal basis for processing your data is Art. 88 GDPR icw § 26 (1) German Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz [BDSG]).\n\n10. Newsletter distribution\n\n10.1 Newsletter dispatch to existing customers\n\nIf you have provided us with your e-mail address when purchasing goods or services, we reserve the right to regularly send you offers for similar goods or services to those already purchased from our range by e-mail. In accordance with Section 7 (3) of the German Unfair Competition Act (UWG), we do not need to obtain your separate consent for this. In this respect, the data processing is carried out solely on the basis of our legitimate interest in personalised direct advertising in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f DS-GVO. If you have initially objected to the use of your e-mail address for this purpose, we will not send you any e-mails. You are entitled to object to the use of your e-mail address for the aforementioned advertising purpose at any time with effect for the future by notifying the responsible person named at the beginning. This will only incur transmission costs for you according to the basic rates. After receipt of your objection, the use of your e-mail address for advertising purposes will cease immediately.\n\n10.2 Rapidmail\n\nFor the purpose of analysis, the e-mails sent with Rapidmail, a service of rapidmail GmbH, Wentzingerstraße 21, 79106 Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany, contain a so-called \"tracking pixel\", which connects to the Rapidmail servers when the e-mail is opened.In this way, it can be determined whether a newsletter message has been opened.\n\nFurthermore, with the help of Rapidmail we can determine whether and, if so, which links in the newsletter message have been clicked on.All links in the email are so-called tracking links, with which your clicks can be counted.\n\nFor more information on the analysis functions of Rapidmail, please see the following link: https://de.rapidmail.wiki/kategorien/statistiken/.\n\nThe data processing is based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DS-GVO). You can revoke this consent at any time. The legality of the data processing operations already carried out remains unaffected by the revocation.\n\nYou can revoke the consent you have given at any time. You can also prevent processing at any time by unsubscribing from the newsletter. You can also prevent the storage of cookies by setting your web browser accordingly. You can also prevent the storage and transmission of personal data by deactivating JavaScript in your web browser or installing a JavaScript blocker (e.g. https://noscript.net or https://www.ghostery.com). We would like to point out that these measures may mean that not all functions of our website are available.\n\nThe data you provide us with for the purpose of receiving the newsletter will be stored by us until you unsubscribe from the newsletter and will be deleted from our servers as well as from the servers of Rapidmail after you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Data stored by us for other purposes (e.g. email addresses for the members' area) remain unaffected by this.\n\nYou can view Rapidmail's privacy policy at: https://www.rapidmail.de/datensicherheit.\n\n11. Our activities in social networks\n\nSo that we can also communicate with you in social networks and inform you about our services, we are represented there with our own pages. If you visit one of our social media pages, we are jointly responsible for the processing operations triggered by this with the provider of the respective social media platform within the meaning of Art. 26 DS-GVO.\n\nWe are not the original provider of these pages, but merely use them within the scope of the possibilities offered to us by the respective providers.\n\nAs a precaution, we therefore point out that your data may also be processed outside the European Union or the European Economic Area. Use may therefore be associated with data protection risks for you, as it may be more difficult to protect your rights, e.g. to information, deletion, objection, etc., and the processing in the social networks often takes place directly for advertising purposes or for the analysis of user behaviour by the providers, without this being able to be influenced by us. If usage profiles are created by the provider, cookies are often used or the usage behaviour is assigned to your own member profile of the social networks.\n\nThe described processing of personal data is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 (1) lit. f DS-GVO on the basis of our legitimate interest and the legitimate interest of the respective provider in order to be able to communicate with you in a timely manner or to inform you about our services. If you have to give your consent to data processing as a user with the respective providers, the legal basis refers to Art. 6 (1) lit. a DS-GVO in conjunction with Art. 7 DS-GVO. Art. 7 DS-GVO.\n\nAs we do not have access to the providers' databases, we would like to point out that it is best to exercise your rights (e.g. to information, correction, deletion, etc.) directly with the respective provider. Further information on the processing of your data in the social networks is listed below under the respective social network provider used by us:\n\n11.1 Facebook\n\n(Co-) controller for data processing in Europe:\n\nMeta Platforms Ireland Ltd, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.\n\nPrivacy Policy (Data Policy):\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/about/privacy\n\n11.2 Instagram\n\n(Mit-) Verantwortlicher für die Datenverarbeitung in Deutschland:\n\nMeta Platforms Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Irland\n\nDatenschutzerklärung (Datenrichtlinie):\n\nhttps://instagram.com/legal/privacy/\n\n12.

This information may also be transferred to third parties if this is required by law or if third parties process this data on our behalf. Under no circumstances will your IP address be merged with other Google data.\n\nThese processing operations are only carried out when explicit consent is given in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DS-GVO.\n\nFurther information on data protection when using GA4 can be found at:\n\nhttps://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12017362?hl=de.\n\n12.2 Google Analytics Universal\n\nOn our websites, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited (https://www.google.de/intl/de/about/), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (\"Google\"). In this context, pseudonymised usage profiles are created and cookies (see point \"Cookies\") are used. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website such as\n\nthe browser type/version,\n\nthe operating system used,\n\nthe referrer URL (the previously visited page),\n\nthe host name of the accessing computer (IP address) and\n\ntime of the server request,\n\nare transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. The information is used to evaluate the use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services related to website and internet use for the purposes of market research and demand-oriented design of these internet pages. This information may also be transferred to third parties if this is required by law or if third parties process this data on our behalf. Under no circumstances will your IP address be merged with other Google data. The IP addresses are anonymised so that an assignment is not possible (IP masking).\n\nYou may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.\n\nThese processing operations will only be carried out if you have given your express consent in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a DS-GVO.\n\nYou can also prevent the collection of the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (incl. your IP address) as well as the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing a browser add-on (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de).\n\nYou can view the privacy policy of Google Analytics at:\n\nhttps://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de.\n\n12.3 Hotjar\n\nThis website uses Hotjar. The provider is Hotjar Ltd, Level 2, St Julians Business Centre, 3, Elia Zammit Street, St Julians STJ 1000, Malta.\n\nHotjar is a tool used to analyse your user behaviour on this website. Hotjar allows us to record, among other things, your mouse movements, scrolling movements and clicks. Hotjar can also determine how long you have stayed with the mouse pointer on a certain spot. From this information, Hotjar creates so-called heat maps, which can be used to determine which areas of the website are viewed preferentially by the website visitor.\n\nFurthermore, we can determine how long you stayed on a page and when you left it. We can also determine at which point you abandoned your entries in a contact form (so-called conversion funnels). In addition, Hotjar can be used to obtain direct feedback from website visitors. This function serves to improve the website operator's web offerings.\n\nHotjar uses cookies. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser. They serve to make our offer more user-friendly, effective and secure. In particular, these cookies allow us to determine whether this website has been visited with a particular end device or whether the Hotjar functions have been deactivated for the browser in question. Hotjar cookies remain on your terminal device until you delete them.\n\nYou can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of cookies and only allow cookies in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or generally and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. If cookies are deactivated, the functionality of this website may be limited.\n\nThese processing operations are only carried out if explicit consent is given in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a DS-GVO.\n\nYou can find more information on Hotjar at:\n\nhttps://help.hotjar.com/hc/en-us/categories/115001323967-About-Hotjar.\n\n12.4 HubSpot\n\nWe use HubSpot functions on this website. The provider is HubSpot, Inc, 25 First Street, Cambridge, MA 02141, USA.\n\nHubSpot tracks visitors to our website using browser cookies. Each time you access our website, HubSpot checks whether a HubSpot tracking cookie is set. If no such cookie is already set on your browser, a HubSpot cookie will be set on your browser - provided you give your consent to this - which will record all our web pages that you access later on.\n\nPlease note the following with regard to HubSpot's handling of tracking cookies:\n\nYour visit to our websites is only tracked using the HubSpot cookie if you have given your consent to the setting of the HubSpot cookie or all tracking cookies.\n\nIf you fill out and submit one of the forms on our websites (e.g. a contact form) and have given your consent to the setting of the HubSpot cookie, HubSpot will associate your previous page views resulting from the tracking cookie with the form you submitted.\n\nIf you have already been in contact with us, the e-mail address you submit via the form will be assigned to the information already stored by us.\n\nIf you delete all your cookies or specifically the HubSpot cookies, you will be considered a new visitor on our websites and a new cookie will be set. However, HubSpot automatically duplicates all form submissions received from the same email address, even if different browser cookies have been assigned to those submissions.\n\nSince cookies are only set once on a browser, submissions from two people sharing a single computer are assigned to one and the same contact record.

Plugins and other services\n\n13.1 Google Maps\n\nWe use Google Maps (API) on our website. The operating company of Google Maps is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. Google Ireland Limited is part of the Google group of companies with headquarters at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Google Maps is a web service for displaying interactive (land) maps in order to visually present geographical information. By using this service, for example, our location can be shown to you and a possible journey can be made easier.\n\nInformation about your use of our website (such as your IP address) is transmitted to Google servers in the USA and stored there when you call up those sub-pages in which the Google Maps map is integrated. In addition, Google Maps reloads the Google Web Fonts. The provider of the Google WebFonts is also Google Ireland Limited. When you call up a page that integrates Google Maps, your browser loads the web fonts required to display Google Maps into your browser cache. For this purpose, too, the browser you use establishes a connection to Google's servers. In this way, Google learns that our website has been accessed via your IP address. This occurs regardless of whether Google provides a user account via which you are logged in or whether no user account exists. If you are logged in to Google, your data will be directly assigned to your account. If you do not want your data to be associated with your Google profile, you must log out of your Google user account. Google stores your data (even for users who are not logged in) as usage profiles and evaluates them. You have the right to object to the creation of these user profiles, and you must contact Google to exercise this right.\n\nIf you do not agree to the future transmission of your data to Google in the context of the use of Google Maps, you also have the option of completely deactivating the Google Maps web service by switching off the JavaScript application in your browser. Google Maps and thus also the map display on this website can then not be used.\n\nThese processing operations are only carried out if express consent is given in accordance with Art. 6 (1) lit. a DS-GVO.\n\nYou can view Google's terms of use at https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/terms/regional.html, the additional terms of use for Google Maps can be found at https://www.google.com/intl/de_US/help/terms_maps.html\n\nYou can view the privacy policy of Google Maps at: (\"Google Privacy Policy\"):\n\nhttps://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/.\n\n14. Payment provider\n\n14.1 PayPal\n\nWe have integrated PayPal components on this website. The European operating company of PayPal is PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. & Cie. S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, 2449 Luxembourg, Luxembourg. PayPal is an online payment service provider. Payments are processed via so-called PayPal accounts, which represent virtual private or business accounts. In addition, PayPal offers the possibility of processing virtual payments via credit cards if a user does not have a PayPal account. A PayPal account is managed via an e-mail address, which is why there is no classic account number. PayPal makes it possible to initiate online payments to third parties or to receive payments. PayPal also assumes trustee functions and offers buyer protection services.\n\nIf you select \"PayPal\" as a payment option during the ordering process in our online shop, your data will be automatically transmitted to PayPal. By selecting this payment option, you consent to the transmission of personal data required for payment processing.\n\nThe personal data transmitted to PayPal is usually your first and last name, address, e-mail address, IP address, telephone number, mobile phone number or other data necessary for processing the payment. Personal data that is necessary for the processing of the purchase contract is also data that is related to the respective order.\n\nThe purpose of transmitting the data is payment processing and fraud prevention. We will transmit personal data to PayPal in particular if there is a legitimate interest for the transmission. The personal data exchanged between PayPal and us may be transmitted by PayPal to credit agencies. The purpose of this transmission is to check identity and creditworthiness.\n\nPayPal may pass on the personal data to affiliated companies and service providers or subcontractors, insofar as this is necessary for the fulfilment of contractual obligations or the data is to be processed on behalf.\n\nYou have the option to revoke your consent to the handling of personal data at any time. A revocation does not affect personal data that must be processed, used or transmitted for (contractual) payment processing.\n\nPayPal is used in the interest of proper and smooth payment processing. This constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f DS-GVO. Your personal data will only be transmitted if you have given your express consent in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a DS-GVO.\n\nPayPal's applicable privacy policy can be found at https://www.paypal.com/de/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full.\n\n15.

You may object to the processing of personal data for the purpose of such advertising at any time. This also applies to profiling, insofar as it is connected with such direct advertising. If you object to us processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes, we will no longer process the personal data for these purposes.\n\nIn addition, you have the right to object on grounds relating to your particular situation to the processing of personal data concerning you which is carried out by us for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless such processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.\n\nYou are free to exercise your right to object in connection with the use of information society services, notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, by means of automated procedures using technical specifications.\n\n15.8 Revocation of consent under data protection law\n\nYou have the right to revoke consent to the processing of personal data at any time with effect for the future.\n\n15.9 Complaint to a supervisory authority\n\nYou have the right to complain about our processing of personal data to a supervisory authority responsible for data protection.\n\n16.

Duration of the storage of personal data\n\nThe criterion for the duration of the storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period. After expiry of the period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted if it is no longer required for the fulfilment or initiation of the contract.\n\n18. Up-to-dateness and amendment of the privacy policy\n\nThis data protection declaration is currently valid and has the status: June 2023.\n\nDue to the further development of our internet pages and offers or due to changed legal or official requirements, it may become necessary to change this data protection declaration.
