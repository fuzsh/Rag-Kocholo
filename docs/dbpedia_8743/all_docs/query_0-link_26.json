And in your contao installation you can find it in the vendor folder\n\n/root/vendor/terminal42/contao-fineuploader/src/Resources/public/frontend\n\nYou could look up all the selectors there but if you overwrite them there, all your changes will be gone after an update. So usualy you just overwrite them in a new e.g. 'my_styles.css' which you include directly in your fe_page.html5 or in your Layout."
