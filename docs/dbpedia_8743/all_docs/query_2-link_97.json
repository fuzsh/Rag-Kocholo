        "text": "Introduction\n\nThis tutorial should help you to do the first step creating a website with Contao and show you on a very basic level how to begin. It helps you get answers of the questions ... where to I begin with my Webpage? What are the first steps.\n\nThe result of the tutorial will be a web page with two columns, a header and a footer with some pages and articles. The requirements are:\n\nOverall with: 960px\n\nAlignment: center\n\nHigh of header: 50px\n\nWith of left column: 220px\n\nHigh of footer: 25px\n\nRequirements\n\nContao needs to be installed with success\n\nInstallation needs to be checked with the system-check tool and removed from all errors if there are some.\n\nThe Example Webpage \"Musicacademy\" will NOT be imported while installing Contao\n\nKnowledge of HTML and CSS\n\nPreparations\n\nFiles\n\nAll files(pictures, documents, Video- Audio-files ...) where belong to the web-project, are stored in the /tl_files/ folder. To get a good overview, you can store the files in several sub-folders. With the integrated [File_Manager] (Backend-System --> File manager), you can create the structure as needet. For example we put all the files for the Webcontent in a subfolder named \"firstsite/theme\". As this here is a very simple project we could create the CSS File in the Subfolder \"theme\". We name it layout.css (more later). The full path will be tl_files/fistsite/theme/.\n\nTemplates\n\nTemplates (check also edit_templates) are stored in the folder /templates/. In the Back-end you can find the templates in Layout --> Templates. Similar as with the files, you can create a sub-folder named \"project-name\". In our case it is /templates/firstpage/.\n\nTheme\n\nWe do create in the Theme_Manager a new \"theme\" with the name \"fistsite\". With this, we do have the controll over all actions where are needed to display a wep-project. This are files, stylesheets, frontend-modules and page-layouts.\n\nWhen you create a \"theme\" you have to give a name and also mention the autor. Below you make settings to wich folders the \"theme\" belongs. Also the template folder can be selected. If you have already a screen-shot of your web-project you will be able to select it to show a small picture.\n\nIf you save your \"theme\" you will see a overview of it with several functions you can access. From left to right, the small Icons represent the functions as, edit themes; delete themes; information; CSS edit of the theme; front-end Modules; page layouts; and export of the theme. (For the screen-shot below i used contao 2.9.3)\n\nStylesheets\n\nYou can create a Stylesheet for your own theme. On the theme-manager by the theme \"fistsite\" you have the CSS button. Within this button click you will open a overview where you see all your style-sheets for the theme you selected. With \"new style-sheet\" you create the necessary file.\n\nIt is also possible to import a CSS file. You just have to put it in the tl_files. As I mentioned while explaining the \"File Manager\" under the section \"Files\" when you put your CSS files in this Folder, you will also get it while you do a export of your theme.\n\nThe CSS-Manager looks like this after creation and import of the CSS Files:\n\nPage Layout\n\nOn the next step we will create a Pagelayouts. Back in the theme-manager on the theme \"fistsite\" we have to click on the \"page-layout\" button (second last one on the right). Now it is up to create a new Layout and we name it default. As mentioned in the Introduction we do the following configuration:\n\nThe Layout Manager looks like this now:\n\nModules Part 1\n\nThe theme just needs the modules. For our example page we do just need one module. It is a Navigation Module. But because we not have a site-structure yet, we will finish this part in the section (see Modules Part 2). The module \"article\" makes an exeption. It not has to be created by yourself. The system does this Module automaticly. You just have to thell the system where you want to display the Articles. In the section \"Frontend-Module\" you can select where to display it. We need it for the example-page in the \"main column\".\n\nSite structure\n\nThe Site structure you can find in the \"Back-end\" under the section \"Layout\" . The Site-structure makes the hierarchy of the \"Articles\" in the Website. Contao has a \"Multi-domain\" functionality. So, first you have to create the Start-point of the website. The Page-type you select here is the Website-root.\n\nNext we just use the \"Regular-page\" type within the Website root. The rest of the settings you can get from the Screen-shot below:\n\nThe example-site contains 4 Mainnavigations:\n\nStartpage\n\nAbout Me\n\nMy Parents\n\nImprint/Contact\n\nThe Mainnavigation \"My parents\" contains a subnavigation named:\n\nMy Father\n\nMy Mother\n\nThe Site Structure looks like this:\n\nWhat we have allready\n\nTill know we made a \"theme\" including \"page-layout\" and \"style-sheet\" and the necessary \"page-structure\". When you looked in the \"front-end\" you just got a \"page not found\" message. Since we made the changes above, we just see a blank page. As we not created any Articles yet this seems to be ok so. But if you look the \"source-code\" you can see some sections. Now it is time to colorize the different sections of our website to see where they are in the page. We do this in the layout.css. We go back to the \"theme\" in the back-end \"layout\" section. On the CSS section we do open the file and add the following:\n\nThe following defaults are now wizible after colorizing the \"sections\" in the layout.css:\n\nThe overall (fixed) with of the page\n\nHight of the header\n\nLeft column with (with of the \"main-section\" is overall-with minus left column with)\n\nModule Part 2\n\nNext we create the Navigation Module. For this we are changing to the \"Modul-Manager\" (Themes \"firstsite\" --> Frontend-Module and do a new Modul. The Settings are the following:\n\nAfter creating the Navi-Module we just have to select the right column where it has to be displayed. Done will this be in the Theme-Manager in the section Layout in the Back-End module. In the Section Page Layout we edit the \"default\"-Layout. Just add a new section (by duplicating the Article-Module on the Plus sighn). We just need to select the nav-modul and select the column:\n\nArticle\n\nLast but not least we need to feed the pages with articles now. When you create a page, Contao automatically generates a article with the same Name.\n\nAfter we have to create a Text-Element and save it in the Article. Just do this for every page with the specific Content.\n\nThe Webpage\n\nThe Example Website is now made with the basic steps. Check it now in the Front-End. You should see the following:\n\nNow you should be alble to make the basic steps of a Webpage. Several steps just repeat and other stepst have to be done to make a compleate Webpage. Pictures are missing and a bit brush up with CSS would aslo be nice.\n\nIf you like more information or to see what is possible with CSS, a good idea would be to download a free Theme and analyze CSS Commands the Theme has been formated with. Good Links for free themes you find in the german community free Themes."
