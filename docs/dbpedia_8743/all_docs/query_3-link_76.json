        "text": "The communication strategy of the UN Food Systems Pre-Summit relied heavily on global participation - also through social media. How successful was this concept? Is this the future of global governance?\n\nThe concept of a hybrid is very interesting. At the Pre-Summit, we had 500 delegates attending in person plus 20.000 registered online and more than 200.000 viewing. In the past, we would have a few thousand in the room and a thousand online. Hence, this Pre-Summit was very successful. The social media channels of the UN Food Systems Summit were started just over one year ago. Now, on Twitter, there is 30.000 people following and on Instagram 13.000 – that is an indication of the interest in this topic. And the growth rates are around 300% across the digital platform, so it has been quite successful to see how using this hybrid format and the digital platforms creates the ability for people to connect.\n\nYou were attending in Rome?\n\nYes, and many colleagues who attended the Pre-Summit online in their home countries around the world told me that their experience online was exceptional. They said that this was one of the best summit online experiences they have ever had. In some ways, there is a plus of being in the room which allows for conversations around the meeting but there is also a benefit in delivering content almost directly to any device around the world.\n\nIs social media merely a tool in order to connect or is it more?\n\nI think it is more. Social media has been a way for people to use their voice. And this gives different voices the space to speak up and be heard, which is really important in today’s world – particularly for women, farmers, indigenous peoples, youth and others looking at topics like food systems and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Summit was labelled a People’s Summit and it has been very much bringing in different constituency groups and hearing many voices. And social media allows that. People can respond to content, they can comment and share.\n\nAre you satisfied with the classic media response to the Pre-Summit?\n\nVery much. The objective was to elevate the discourse around food systems and to really educate the public on the complexity of food systems as well as highlight this idea that we all come together to create big changes. More than 3000 articles in a multitude of languages from every corner of the globe have been published about the Summit. It was quite a broad reach.\n\nDid you encounter any difficulties in campaigning, would you change anything?\n\nOne of the challenges is time obviously. We should have probably started many years previously. How do we shift people’s understanding of food systems?\n\nWhen people hear about food systems, many of them think about hunger or poverty. But with transforming food systems, we really have a chance to progress all 17 SDGs.\n\nFood systems is not yet a household concept and so we are on a long road to help people to understand what they can do in their household, in their community, in their nation to change the way we produce and distribute food. It takes time. In campaigning, one of the things we often don’t realize is that it takes a lot of time for people to pick things up.\n\nWhat else?\n\nThere is an important point to be made on language. Often in our space, we talk in a technical language that is based on science which is really important, but when people talk about food systems and food, they often use a different language. You don’t go to a restaurant and start always asking scientific questions. You talk about flavour and taste, for example. One of the reasons why we developed the Good Food For All campaign was to connect to this concept in an accessible way and really help to engage everyone and everywhere. We want people to understand and see the potential for action in our food systems and in the way we consume food and distribute food. But the way everyday people engage in food is through conversations around food that they like to eat, that is affordable, that is accessible. We have to help them to think about the dimensions around what makes good food. It is not just food that tastes good or food that is cheap or that is good for you – you have to think about all the dimensions. And this is where I think a system approach comes in where you can start to think about: Okay, what does that mean? We always have to remember that the world is very different and so there is no one answer.\n\nA friend of mine said: There are seven billion food experts in the world because every single person is an expert in what they like.\n\nTrying to get them all to agree is not necessarily what you want to do. What you need to do is to educate them that the choices they make actually can have an impact on their health, on the climate, on the planet and also on the prosperity and on livelihoods of people.\n\nYou mentioned several times the term “system” which might be a challenge to campaign – it is an abstract word, right?\n\nYes…\n\n…hence, how do you break it down for the seven billion food experts?\n\nWe started a campaign where we asked people to explain what good food means to them. A farmer, a chef or a mother have their different starting points. The idea is to get people to understand it and then you can present the different conversational points and discussions. Then you can get them to think about this in different ways. A food system is all the connections that exist around food. In order to break that down, I don’t seek a single definition but am trying to make people understand that food does not just appear on a plate. It comes from somewhere, it is produced by someone. The journey to the plate is important.\n\nIs it also important to break it down to journalists? Do they deal enough with food systems issues?\n\nThere is a need for helping journalists to understand that complexity. My understanding is: from a journalist’s perspective, journalists also want to understand the different perspectives. So, they want to understand the science, the policy dimension, the general public’s engagement.\n\nFor many years, climate change was considered a non-issue for the media and social media. That has now changed rapidly. Could campaigners for SDG 2 learn something from this?\n\nAbsolutely. One result of the Food Systems Summit is: People now are starting to understand that food is part of a system.\n\nWith climate change, one of the first steps is to get people involved in the different elements of the process to really grasp this. The Food Systems Summit has helped us to do that from a food system perspective\n\nwhere the different actors are starting to engage in new ways, around not just hunger or thinking about agriculture or nutrition but seeing how they all are interrelated – seeing how food has an impact on health of people and on the environment. For climate change, it took some time to reach the point of understanding the systemic relationship between climate and everything else.\n\nThe climate movement received a boost by a single person: Greta Thunberg. Does campaigning against hunger and for healthy food lack a person like her? Could you imagine someone like her for this movement?\n\nAt the climate movement, there are many actors who helped it get where it is now and to get the attention it deserves. I think having credible voices like Greta Thunberg or David Attenborough is very critical. There are a number of them around food systems, too. Have we had that same moment yet? I would say probably not at the same level. Can you plan for that? But I think that even with the voices on climate: We know that agriculture and food systems is a major contributor to climate change. What we have to do is see that everything is interrelated. At the Summit, we are not talking only about one SDG but about all 17.\n\nCan you give details about the campaigning for the Summit in New York?\n\nAt the moment, there is a countdown campaign titled #FoodSystems4SDGs that highlights the relationship between better food systems and making progress across each of the SDGs. Zero hunger is only one dimension of a food system. We have to look at all 17!\n\nThe Summit will take place alongside the General Assembly. And the world once again has urgent current problems: Fires, Afghanistan, Corona. How do you plan to draw attention to Food Systems?\n\nFood systems have risen to the top. When you look at climate change, you see that food systems are one of the biggest opportunities and one of the biggest challenges.\n\nIf you look at conflict, you will find that it impacts food systems – behind every conflict, there is food insecurity.\n\nAnd also, COVID-19 is one of these grave challenges that started in the food system and is affecting many aspects of food like distribution, for example. All these mega spaces are already connected to food systems. Hence, we need to understand what the science is telling us. Are there actions and action areas? There are five action areas, the “Action Tracks”, that are part of the Summit. As the Summit develops, there are areas of convergence and action that are being identified that people are gathering around to drive forward change. In the campaigning world, we are looking at what leaders saying, what comes from the Summit – in order to provide support and to encourage people to take everyday actions for food systems change as well as to work with leaders to really ensure that these solutions are being effective and implemented."
