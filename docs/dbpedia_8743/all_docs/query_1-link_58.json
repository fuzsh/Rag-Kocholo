Or you have a text (without a corresponding source text) and want to have it checked for style, grammar, spelling, punctuation before going to press or other publication?\n\nEditing & proofreading\n\nUnlike proofreading, editing involves a stylistic and linguistic assessment and revision of the text.\n\nTherefore, editing is not just about correcting mistakes, but also about improving the language of a text. The decisive factor is general comprehensibility for readers. Convoluted sentences that are difficult to grasp and passages that are too colloquial will be rephrased. Excessive repetitions of words will be eliminated and missing contexts established. If necessary, additions will be made, or the text passages concerned will be arranged in a different order.\n\nDuring proofreading, unlike editing, no linguistic/stylistic changes are made; only the following points will be checked and corrected:\n\nSpelling\n\nGrammar\n\nPunctuation\n\nUniform spelling\n\nCorrect hyphenation\n\nConsistency of the terminology used\n\nTypography: formatting & layout (quotation marks, font size, font, indents, etc.)"
