        "text": "We have just released a new version of the Veello Theme tagged 1.3.0. The update adds the long-awaited German translation. The release also includes several minor bug fixes.\n\nVeello Theme in German\n\nOur star product Veello Theme has finally received its long-awaited German translation! We have updated 59 files and hundreds of lines of source code. The translation includes everything, starting from the backend UI and content elements and ending on the frontend modules.\n\nVeello Portfolio in German\n\nThe Veello Portfolio product receives a language update as well! As of today, it is also available in the German language.\n\nMember button in header\n\nApart from the search icon and Isotope buttons, now you can also add a new button to the header ‚Äì the member button. In fact, it's a simple link, so it can be used for the login page for your members.\n\nResponsive image in the page image module\n\nWe have added an option to select the image size in the page image module. That means you can make your background image fully responsive and lazy-loaded.\n\nPlease note that if you go with a responsive image, it will be added as a regular <figure> behind the content elements. If you do not set an image size, it will be added as a CSS background image.\n\nBugfixes üêû\n\nIn addition to the features above, we have fixed a few minor bugs:\n\nfix PHP 8 warnings;\n\nfix an error in help wizard popup of the module type field;\n\nfix sorting of the images in sliders;\n\nfix the trailer box content element if there is too much content;\n\nfix the selector popup not working properly in the \"override all\" mode.\n\nBig thanks to our customers for reporting all those problems!\n\nHow to update my products?\n\nThanks to the Contao Manager, the update process of our products is super simple. All you need to do is to log in to Contao Manager and update the packages.\n\nPlease visit our documentation to read more about updating the products."
