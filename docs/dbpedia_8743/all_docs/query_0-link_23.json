But you can edit these imported values afterwards or add more to the list of course.\n\nIf you don't want to import these at all, you can also skip the migrations by adding --schema-only to the command above and add your individual values.\n\nModules\n\nThe bundle provides a list and reader module which can be created and should be added to separate pages.\n\nThe list modules should redirect to the page, where the reader module was placed.\n\nAfter that the page with the reader module must also have the Require an item setting checked.\n\nRecipes inside the list module will then automatically add a read more link for the reader page correctly, if contents exist inside them.\n\nElements\n\nInside the recipes, you have the possibility to add detailed contents to it.\n\nPossible elements currently include:\n\nRecipe step Adds numbered steps to the recipe\n\nRecipe image Adds an image to the recipe\n\nGallery Adds a Contao core gallery to the recipe\n\nNOTE: It is not possible to choose other Contao core or third party elements inside the recipe without overwriting the options_callback of the type field in tl_content.\n\nRoadmap"
