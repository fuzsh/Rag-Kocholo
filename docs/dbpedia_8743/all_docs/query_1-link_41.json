        "text": "Who am I?\n\nHello! My name is Rachel Schmidlechner. I’m the author of “Read and Rhyme with Brown Owl”, a series of rhyming books for children. I also create accompanying teaching resources for educators.\n\nI have been teaching English at a primary school in Austria for 15 years and created the books based on my teaching experiences.\n\nWhere am I from?\n\nI grew up in Devon, England and since 2006 I have been living in a beautiful part of the Danube valley called the Wachau in Austria with my husband and three children.\n\nWhat do I do?\n\nI studied foreign languages (German/French/Spanish) in Sheffield and was awarded my BA honours degree in 2002. I then spent two years working as an English Language Assistant in Germany and Austria, helping students learn English as a second language. After that, I went back to England and completed my teacher training for German and French. I taught at a comprehensive school in England but then decided to move to Austria in 2006 to be with my husband.\n\nI have been teaching English at a primary school in Krems, Austria ever since. As a native speaker, I have also worked at various kindergartens, introducing children to English at an early age, and I have taught English to adults.\n\nI loved creating little rhymes as a child and now I really enjoy reading aloud to my own children. I created these books because I want to motivate children to read. I want to make English more accessible and enjoyable to young learners and help teachers plan multi-sensory and interesting English lessons.\n\nWho am I?\n\nHello! I’m Nadja Grace Bodner. I’m the illustrator of the rhyming picture books “Read and Rhyme with Brown Owl”. I drew all the illustrations to create an exciting visual adventure and I also illustrate the English rhymes, sayings and chants that we share on Instagram.\n\nWhere am I from?\n\nI grew up in Lower Austria. My mother is from England and my father is Austrian, so I grew up bilingually. I have always loved reading, both in English and German, ever since I was a child.\n\nWhat do I do?\n\nI discovered that I had quite a talent for drawing and painting at a young age. I must have inherited it from my British grandfather, who was an artist himself, and from my parents who are both good at drawing, too.\n\nI finished my studies of graphics and communication design at Die Graphische in Vienna in 2017. In 2018, I then did a course on designing and illustrating books for children, which I really enjoyed. I now work as a freelance illustrator and have illustrated several story books for various clients, including some for the Viennese publisher Obelisk."
