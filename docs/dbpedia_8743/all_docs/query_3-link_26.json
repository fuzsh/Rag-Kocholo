Description and scope of data processing\n\nIf you would like to receive the newsletter offered on the website, we require an e-mail address from you as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the e-mail address provided and that you agree to receive the newsletter.

Usage analysis\n\nWith the help of Brevo, we are able to analyze our newsletter campaigns. For example, we can see whether a newsletter message has been opened and which links have been clicked on. In this way, we can determine, among other things, which links were clicked on particularly often.\n\nWe can also recognize whether certain previously defined actions were carried out by the newsletter recipient after opening/clicking (conversion rate). For example, we can recognize whether a room was booked or a table reserved after clicking on the newsletter.\n\nIf you do not wish to be analyzed by Brevo, you must unsubscribe from the newsletter. For this purpose, we provide a corresponding link in every e-mail/newsletter.\n\nYou can find detailed information on the functions of Brevo here:\n\nhttps://www.brevo.com/de/newsletter-software/.\n\n3. Legal basis\n\nData processing is based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can revoke this consent at any time. The legality of the data processing operations that have already taken place remains unaffected by the revocation.\n\nThe legal basis for the usage analysis is the balancing of interests pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.\n\nWe have concluded a data processing agreement (DPA) with the service provider in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR for the use of Brevo. This ensures that the service provider processes the personal data of our newsletter recipients only in accordance with our instructions and in compliance with the GDPR.\n\n4. Storage period\n\nYour data processed in Brevo will be stored by us or the service provider until you unsubscribe from the newsletter and deleted from the newsletter distribution list after you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Data stored by us for other purposes remains unaffected by this.\n\nAfter you unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, your e-mail address may be stored by us or the service provider in a blacklist if this is necessary to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist will only be used for this purpose and will not be merged with other data. This serves both your interest and our interest in complying with the legal requirements when sending newsletters (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). Storage in the blacklist is not limited in time. You can object to storage in the blacklist if your interests outweigh our legitimate interest.\n\n5. Brevo uses the cookie \"__cfruid\".
