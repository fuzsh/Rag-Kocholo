        "text": "Use the advantages of revised regulations for psychotherapy training!\n\nWhen the German law reforming the training of psychotherapists entered into force in 2020 it created new and markedly improved parameters for the professional qualification as a psychotherapist. The license to practice psychotherapy can now be acquired by way of a Bachelor and subsequent Master course to be completed in 5 years, the contents of which are precisely defined in the new regulations. This period is followed by a specialization as “psychotherapist in advanced training” of at least another 5 years’ duration in permanent and suitably salaried employment.\n\nMHB once again a pioneer\n\nIn 2020 the MHB was the first German university to offer a Bachelor course “Psychology” and a Master course “Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy” in compliance with revised licensing regulations. More than 30 MHB students have completed their studies and acquired the license to practice as psychotherapists.\n\nAll students who opt for psychology studies at the MHB start in the new polyvalent Bachelor course “Psychology” (B.Sc.) which complies with the new licensing regulations. Graduates of that course can continue their studies at the MHB in the Master course “Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy” (M.Sc.)"
