In working with a specialized and well-connected language service provider, you benefit from fast, non-bureaucratic work processes and a trust-based business relationship.\n\nThe principle of Language Boutique: We are NOT an agency, but a network of independent, self-employed language experts, each operating autonomously — while collaborating on certain projects when needed.\n\nOur promise: We offer high-quality language services exclusively by native speakers and within the individual’s areas of expertise. You work directly with the expert of your choice and always know who you are dealing with. All Language Boutique partners offer their services in their own name and for their own account.\n\nOur website uses plugins of the video portal Vimeo in places.
