        "text": "Purpose\n\nAs one of the major technology players, the company is undergoing a transformation from hardware-based business to cloud services of the future. This requires faster ways of working, flatter hierarchies and a high degree of psychological safety in order to remain highly innovative, shorten time-2-market and enable agile forms of collaboration with customers. An internal objective is the workload reduction of the staff.\n\nWhat were the effects?\n\nThe practical and focused workshop design along the Culture Canvas created a lively discussion on the team culture, which resulted in very concrete action steps in each workshop. In the participantsâ€™ feedback, the workshops were rated as very efficient and specific. The participants not only developed a common understanding of the strategic importance of leadership through the Culture Canvas topics but were also enabled to apply the tool themselves on a regular basis and to make culture easily manageable in their teams. The intense work with the Culture Canvas fields also reinforced the leaders' maturity development.\n\nProcess\n\nClose coordination with the internal team driving the transformation. The Culture Canvas was chosen as the standard culture development tool, then a workshop design (face-to-face and virtual) was designed for the top management levels with subsequent cascading to the other hierarchy levels. An additional train-the-trainer program for the transformation team allowed to bring internal and external perspectives together in each of the workshops and to later internally follow up on the process. Briefings with team leaders before each workshop and post-workshop retros ensured the continuous learning and improvement process."
