        "text": "Declaration on Accessibility\n\nThe organization “Nationalparks Austria” strives to make its website accessible in accordance with the Web Accessibility Act (WZG).\n\nThis declaration on accessibility applies to the homepage www.nationalparksaustria.at.\n\nStatus of compatibility with the requirements\n\nThis Website is partially compliant with Conformance Level AA of the \"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Web - WCAG 2.1\". The incompatibilities and exceptions are listed below.\n\nScalable web design\n\nThe websites are designed responsibly for the benefit of mobile devices and strong scaling. The contents are adapted according to different window widths. When scaling in desktop browsers, please update the web page after setting the desired scaling (e.g. with zoom).\n\nDisplay of the main navigation\n\nThe menu bar, which contains the main navigation of this website, is a tab bar at the top of the browser window. In addition to the main navigation, there is a menu icon at the top right-hand edge, which opens a further sub-navigation.\n\nIf the menu bar of the main navigation is not automatically opened due to smaller screen widths, please click on the menu symbol at the top right-hand edge. The interaction bar will then open and you will see the main and sub-navigation.\n\nIn addition to the main navigation, there is a bread-crumb navigation at the bottom of the page.\n\nEnlargement of the content display\n\nYou can resize the displayed pages by using the following key combination:\n\nEnlarge the view: \"Ctrl\" and \"+\".\n\nReduce the view: \"Ctrl\" and \"-\".\n\nMac users press the \"Apple/Apple/Command\" key instead of \"Ctrl\".\n\nNatural language\n\nThe homepage is available in German and English language. The primary natural language of each page is identified and can be changed at the bottom of each page.\n\nPlease notice, that some content is only available in German.\n\nNon-accessible contents\n\nThe contents listed below are not accessible for the following reasons:\n\na) Incompatibility with accessibility regulations\n\nVideos: For some recorded videos, the subtitles are missing, so the spoken German content is not available for deaf users. Therefore, the WCAG success criterion 1.2.2 (subtitles recorded) is not met.\n\nImages: Our images should all have alternative text, so that this information is accessible to screen reader users.\n\nForms: It is possible that some forms have readability problems. If you notice a problem here, please let us know immediately.\n\nContrast: We have made every effort to create a high-contrast homepage. If the contrast of some elements is not sufficient for you, please let us know immediately.\n\nLinks: Some links in the website only differ from the continuous text by underlining, which may result in accessibility restrictions. However, most links are highlighted as separate buttons.\n\nSide-panel: Sometimes page contents link to text passages at the end of the page source text. These contents are displayed from the right side when accessed via a standard web browser (\"Side-Panel\"). This functionality may result in a restriction of accessibility.\n\nb) Disproportionate burden\n\nOur videos are partly hosted and published on the video platform Youtube. It is not possible to provide the required audio descriptions for some of these videos. Therefore, the WCAG success criterion 1.2.5 (audio description recorded) is not fulfilled. We believe that a fix would place a disproportionate burden in terms of accessibility regulations.\n\nc) The contents do not fall within the scope of the applicable legal provisions\n\nContents of third parties, for example studies or presentation materials of external lecturers, which are not within the sphere of influence of Nationalparks Austria, are excluded from the directive (EU) 2016/2102. For these contents, no statement can be made regarding compatibility with accessibility regulations.\n\nMany, mainly older PDF documents and Office documents, are not accessible. For example, PDF documents are not tagged, so that screen reader users cannot read and use them, or only to an insufficient extent. So that the WCAG success criterion 4.1.2 (name, role, value) is not met.\n\nPreparation of this declaration on accessibility\n\nThis statement was prepared on September 22, 2020.\n\nThe assessment of the compatibility of the website with the WZG for the implementation of the requirements of Directive (EU) 2016/2102 was based on a self-test in September 2020.\n\nFeedback and contact details\n\nThe offers and services on this website are continuously improved, exchanged and expanded as far as possible. In doing so, usability and accessibility are of great importance to us.\n\nIf you notice any barriers that prevent you from using our website - problems that are not described in this declaration - please inform us by e-mail. We will check your request and make corrections, if possible.\n\nPlease send all messages and suggestions to office@nationalparksaustria.at with the subject \"Reporting accessibility \". Please describe the problem and provide us with the URL(s) of the affected website or document.\n\nContact"
