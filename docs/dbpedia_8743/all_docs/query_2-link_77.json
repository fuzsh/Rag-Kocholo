        "text": "Denkendorf, July 11, 2024 - The Eppinger Group will be presenting high-precision machine tool solutions at this year's AMB in Stuttgart from September 10-14, at stand 3B31 in Hall 3. New highlights in the areas of tool holders, gears and gear cutting will be presented. This year's focus will be on spur and bevel gears as well as the latest gear solutions.\n\n\"AMB is one of the most important international trade fairs for metalworking and takes place virtually on our doorstep. We are very pleased to be able to take advantage of this 'home game' once again,\" says Managing Director Uwe Eppinger. After all, the Eppinger company from nearby Denkendorf stands for \"Innovation Made in Germany\". \"With almost one hundred years of experience in the field of precision tools for lathes, and a leading role in the development and production of tool holders for CNC turning and milling centers, we are ideally positioned to help shape the future of metalworking.\"\n\nPrecisely toothed\n\nThe company's many years of expertise are reflected in the development and production of spur and bevel gears using proven GLEASON gearing technology - in particular spiral, hypoid and Zerol gears, which are used in all the company's driven tool holders, as well as precision gears that are used in all areas of mechanical engineering. A selection of the current range will be on display at the stand. \"We have successfully implemented a large number of customized projects and will be presenting this expertise to trade visitors at AMB,\" explains Uwe Eppinger.\n\nThe right drive solution for every motion task\n\nVisitors to the trade fair who require reliable and high-precision gear technology will find what they are looking for at the Eppinger stand. The Denkendorf-based company is internationally renowned for its high-quality precision gearboxes, which are used in various industrial applications and especially in machine tools. The exhibits include cycloidal gears, with their impressive compact design, high positioning and repeat accuracy. They are ideal for drive tasks where rapid acceleration and deceleration phases are typical, such as in tool changers and magazines as well as pallet changers. These versatile gearboxes are frequently used in the automation and robotics industry. Our experts will also be presenting new developments in the fields of helical gears and bevel gears, which are known for their high performance and durability. Uwe Eppinger emphasizes: \"The AMB audience will see how our solutions enable high-precision motion control and positioning, which leads to an overall improvement in the performance of machines and systems.”\n\nDenkendorf, 14 July 2023 – The Eppinger Group is presenting precise solutions around machine tools at this year’s EMO in Hanover. The world’s leading metalworking trade fair takes place from 18 - 23 September, where new highlights from the three production sectors tool holders, rotary tables and gearboxes will be exhibited at Booth F41 in Hall 005. The latest version of the QUICK-LOCK BMT tool clamping system will also be on show for the first time at the EMO.\n\nWith QUICK-LOCK BMT®, tool holders (BMT) can be automatically clamped and released in less than four seconds at the push of a button, thus allowing setup times to be significantly optimised. “At the EMO the trade visitors will see for the first time the 4.0 version of our innovative clamping system. The turret is loaded fully automatically with the aid of an industrial robot”, says managing director Uwe Eppinger about the forthcoming trade fair appearance.\n\nComplete flexibility even with high precision\n\nIn addition, Eppinger will present a selection of stationary and driven tool holders, the PRECI-FLEX®, DECOFLEX® and Eppinger PSC tool changing systems as well as tool holders that make various special machining processes possible.\n\nFor example, the PRECI-FLEX tool changing system impresses with its high flexibility, in addition to which it can be used in a wide range of variants. “Our tool changing system is based on collet technology, which means that we have a basic holder into which standard collets with standard ER clamping nuts can be installed”, says Uwe Eppinger, explaining the clamping concept. “According to the taper/flat contact principle, the PRECI-FLEX adapters can also be used in the same interface.” The user would normally have to choose a tool system in advance. This is not necessary with the system from Eppinger, however, as flexible collets or adapters can be used. Thus, there are also no restrictions with regard to use. “Due to its optimal system rigidity, our solution minimises vibration and thus also supports high-precision machining”, Uwe Eppinger continues.\n\nFast changing and clamping\n\nFast tool changes in machining are also promised by the DECOFLEX tool changing and quick clamping system, which was developed above all for longitudinal lathes. On top of that, it is also suitable for use on small turning/milling centres. According to the manufacturer, the patented change system, whose interface is based on the taper/flat contact principle, sets new benchmarks in tool changing with its high concentricity and repeatability as well as its minimal dimensions. “Our developers designed DECOFLEX in such a way that a machine operator can change a tool very conveniently and safely with only a few manual steps. That noticeably reduces the setup times”, stresses Uwe Eppinger.\n\nRotary tables for vertical and horizontal machining centres\n\nIn addition, the company from Denkendorf is exhibiting its newly developed CNC rotary tables, which can position quickly and precisely and are extremely compact. Their integrated sensor system with closed control loop and dual drive allows high-precision positioning. This enables permanently high accuracy, even in tough roughing operation. The rotary tables can be used both as original equipment and for retrofitting vertical and horizontal machine tools.\n\nThe appearance at the EMO in Hanover is always a special event for the almost 100-year-old Swabian company, as Marie Strunk-Eppinger emphasises again: “The future of the manufacturing industry comes together at the EMO and we’re looking forward to making use of this international platform once again. We like to convince trade visitors of our innovative portfolio - Made in Germany.”\n\nDenkendorf, 15. August 2022 – Under the motto “System solutions around the machine tool”, the Eppinger Group presents itself at the AMB in Stuttgart from September 13 to 17, 2022. The highlight at the international exhibition for metalworking will be the innovative QUICK-LOCK BMT tool clamping system. It allows tool holders (BMT) to be clamped and released automatically in just a few seconds at the touch of a button. The Denkendorf-based company will also be showing its innovative tool holders and tool systems as well as rotary tables specially designed for precision machining on milling or grinding machines at its booth.\n\nAMB is one of the most important national trade fairs with international appeal. Over 100 exhibiting companies from the metalworking industry will showcase proven know-how as well as plenty of innovations during five days of the trade show. “For us as a manufacturing specialist, AMB right on our doorstep is one of the most important events of all”, emphasises the Managing Director\n\nUwe Eppinger. “Here we can showcase all of our expertise, both our nearly 100 years of experience in precision tooling for lathes and our role as a leader in the design and manufacture of tool holders for CNC turning and milling centres.”\n\nTool change in less than four seconds\n\nThe highlight at the booth of the Denkendorf-based tool specialists will be the innovative QUICK-LOCK BMT tool clamping system. While the previous Fastlock changeover clamping system was already optimised in terms of setup time, with QUICK-LOCK BMT the tool change is now automated throughout and takes just a few seconds. According to the manufacturer, a push of a button is all it takes for QUICK-LOCK BMT to clamp or release the BMT tool holder in less than four seconds. As an optional 4.0 adaptation, the clamping system can also be operated by means of an industrial robot and the tool turret can thus be loaded fully automatically. Until now, several minutes have been needed for such a tool change, including loosening the screws and tightening them again with the torque wrench. With the previous approach, process reliability was not optimally guaranteed. “The setup time savings are enormous, so the innovative tool clamping system can be amortised after a very short time”, emphasizes Managing Director Uwe Eppinger.\n\nIn addition to the new BMT tool clamping system QUICK-LOCK BMT, Eppinger will show a selection of fixed and driven tool holders, the tool changing systems PRECI-FLEX®, PRECI-FLEX® T, DECOFLEX® and Eppinger PSC as well as tool holders that allow various special machining operations.\n\nMoreover, the Denkendorf-based company will be exhibiting its newly developed CNC rotary tables. These can position quickly and precisely and are built extremely compact. Its integrated closed-loop sensor system with dual drive allows high-precision positioning. This allows high and lasting accuracy even in hard roughing operation. The rotary tables can be used both as original equipment and for retrofitting vertical and horizontal machine tools.\n\nDenkendorf, 30. September 2021 - In view of the company’s 100th jubilee, which is coming up very soon, the Eppinger Group has completely revised its brand identity. The traditional company from Denkendorf is thus building a bridge between medium-sized values, decades of know-how and the continuing trust of its numerous industrial users to become a modern, globally active, future-oriented innovation partner. The new corporate design will be presented to a wider audience for the first time at this year's EMO, the world's leading trade fair for metalworking, in Milan from October 4 to 9.\n\nBy focusing its product portfolio on innovative, high-precision tooling systems for CNC turning/milling centres, Eppinger, a family-owned company founded in 1925, has over time established a leading position in the global market. High-performance engineering, comprehensive application experience, and a pronounced awareness of quality have also contributed to the Swabian company becoming a sought-after and competent partner for renowned machine manufacturers worldwide.\n\n“For almost 100 years, we at Eppinger have been developing and working together on ground-breaking solutions - with a quality that speaks for itself and for the performance of all our employees”, emphasizes Managing Director Uwe Eppinger. “Now we have decided to enhance the Eppinger brand even further: for a stronger global perception, a clear identity and - above all - for maximum identification of our employees, partners and customers.”\n\nInnovative solutions for a wide range of applications\n\nThis is to be reflected in all brand communication with immediate effect. The core message is: Eppinger is constantly staying in motion - for itself and its customers. And also with regard to the new technical and digital possibilities, be it to advance their own processes or to be able to support customers even more optimally. “We are agile problem solvers - by listening, understanding, and constantly evolving, we work with our global customers to create customised and cost-effective solutions”, Uwe Eppinger continues. “For our industrial users, this enables functionally and economically superior processes and work results.”\n\nThe new logo stands for dynamics\n\nThe new logo stands for the dynamics of the manufacturer of tool holders and systems as well as high-precision industrial gear units - hence the round “e” in the figurative mark. Not only the products are constantly in motion, but also Eppinger itself. The chosen image format deliberately emphasizes and repeats the square element from the logo. The visual language is cool, clear and technical, with a slight emphasis on violet as an ideal contrast to the light blue.\n\nWeb relaunch shall be carried out in parallel\n\nThe dynamism is also reflected in the company’s redesigned website. The new homepage is intended to serve as a useful information platform for users and interested parties alike, making it easier to access individual products and business areas, for example. Thanks to the new corporate design, modern look and intuitive user guidance, visitors can reach the desired topic with just a few clicks. The integrated product and spare parts catalogue also gives customers a quick overview of the current product range. Detailed product information and possible specifications can be called up in a targeted manner. The simplified navigation makes it easy to switch between the online catalogue, product portfolio and gear unit configurator at any time.\n\nIn addition to the complete revision of the content, the website was also technically updated: The new website is easier to find via search engines and the responsive web design ensures an optimal display on all devices.\n\n“Once again, our prospective customers and users are at the centre of the new website”, says Marie Strunk-Eppinger, commercial manager at the Eppinger Group. Not only do they receive a comprehensive overview of the products and services, but they are also given the opportunity to contact the company quickly. “We are in a position to offer our customers flexible and quickly realisable solutions at calculable costs. With our new website, we are placing even more emphasis on these core competencies. At the same time, we are increasingly focusing on professional communication in order to provide both customers and interested parties with sound information about our content.”\n\nReportage style visual world\n\nMarie Strunk-Eppinger explains in this regard: “We owe our continued success to the quality of our work and, of course, to the experience, competence and passion of our employees.” These are therefore also a central theme of the new brand identity. “We deliberately chose a visual language that incorporates all of these thoughts.”\n\nEppinger with new products and new CI at EMO\n\nThe revised brand identity will be presented to a larger trade public for the first time at EMO in Milan. They will then be able to see the new trade fair booth (hall 4, booth B11), which will also feature the new corporate design. With the innovative BMT tool clamping system QUICKLOCK, the design engineers from Denkendorf also have an absolute world premiere in their trade fair luggage: Driven tool holders (BMT) can thus be automatically clamped and released again in just a few seconds at the touch of a button. “So, it’s doubly worth coming”, says Uwe Eppinger. After all this time, we are of course extremely pleased to finally be able to appear before an international trade public again with our innovative solutions.”\n\nDenkendorf, September 13, 2021 - At this year's EMO, the world's leading international trade fair for metalworking in Milan (Oct. 4-9, 2021), the Eppinger Group from Denkendorf, Germany, will present its innovative tool holders and tool systems especially for turning/milling centres. To ensure that BMT tool holders can be clamped in an even more stress-free manner in the future, the innovative QUICKLOCK tool clamping system will be presented to the trade public for the first time. It allows tool holders (BMT) to be automatically clamped and released in just a few seconds at the touch of a button.\n\n“EMO is one of the most important events for us; at hardly any other trade fair do we reach so many international trade visitors in such a short time. That is why we are extremely pleased that the trade fair can take place again this year”, says Managing Director Uwe Eppinger with optimism. And he also has an absolute world premiere in his trade fair luggage: the innovative BMT tool clamping system QUICKLOCK.\n\nWhile the previous Fastlock interchangeable clamping system was already optimised in terms of setup time because only one clamping screw had to be removed from the spindle, the developers at the Denkendorf-based tool specialist have now gone one step further: “Changing BMT tool holders on the turret on a lathe or turning/milling centre still involves increased setup time and changeover risk due to operator intervention”, knows Joel Judas, responsible for R&D and sales at the Eppinger Group. “With our QUICKLOCK clamping system, the BMT tool change is now automated throughout.” According to the manufacturer, all it takes is the push of a cnc button and QUICKLOCK clamps or releases the BMT tool holder in less than four seconds. As an optional 4.0 adaptation, the toolholder exchange can also be operated by means of an industrial robot and the indexer can thus be loaded fully automatically. Until now, several minutes were needed for such a tool change, including loosening the screws and tightening them again with the torque wrench. Optimum process reliability was also not guaranteed.\n\n“With QUICKLOCK, we are closing another gap on the road to automation on lathes and turning/milling centres”, emphasises Managing Director Uwe Eppinger. “The setup time savings are enormous, so the innovative clamping system has already returned its investment after a short time, depending on the production volume.”\n\nA simple principle for more safety\n\nThe QUICKLOCK principle is as ingenious as it is simple: An external hydraulic piston system is installed above the indexer, as it has proven itself thousands of times over for decades. When clamping a BMT tool holder, the piston pushes the locking fork assigned to each station in the direction of the BMT tool holder; with this radial movement, the locking fork encloses a special clamping ring and at the same time hits a shoulder of the cylindrical shaft of the BMT tool holder. The axial movement triggered by this pulls the toolholder down onto the face of the turret disc with a force of 15-20 tons and arrests and locks it in a process-safe manner.\n\nThe wear on clamping rings and locking forks is also only marginal, as extensive material stability tests have shown. “We tested the stability of the components as well as the entire system using an elaborate, practical test program”, explains Joel Judas. For example, five BMT tool holders have been used for over 100,000 clamping/releasing strokes without any problems or failures. Likewise, the endurance tests in connection with a turret head developed for this purpose (Leonardo line) from Baruffaldi, which fully confirm - and even exceed - our expectations.\n\nJoel Judas is certain: “If the machining operators want to use QUICKLOCK on the machine, there will be machine manufacturers in the near future who will offer our tool-side automation as a full 4.0 adaptation as well. This unique innovation will offer new perspectives to the end-user market, especially since our future-oriented solution will make things considerably easier for every machine operator worldwide.”\n\nDenkendorf, April 22, 2020 - Eppinger shows once again what an innovative collaboration between companies and their suppliers can look like: The Swabian company received the “DMT Best Partner Award” in April 2020 for its exemplary solution competence. And those who receive this award can count themselves among the best in their field.\n\nFor many years, the international machine tool manufacturer Doosan Machine Tools has successfully used the high-quality tool holders and cycloidal gear units from Eppinger, some of which were specially developed for Doosan.\n\nWith this award, Doosan honors its best suppliers for excellent performance in the manufacture and delivery of products or services - especially in the areas of quality, costs, innovations and logistics.\n\nEppinger has been supporting the machine tool builder for 20 years and has always been able to convince with its quality products and reliable delivery performance.\n\nToday, companies demand more from their suppliers than simply providing products. It's about individual use and making existing processes even better. Your contact person: Daniela Klähn, Mangt. Corporate Communication Eppinger GmbH Breitwiesenweg 2-8, 73770 Denkendorf Tel.: +49 711 934 934 668 dklaehn@eppinger.de Eppinger offers individual and end-to-end solutions from a single source, from development and design to production.\n\nNumerous national and international companies such as Doosan benefit from the supplier’s high level of innovation. “With our individual developments for, but also in cooperation with Doosan, we have meanwhile been able to set a world standard in terms of tool interface”, claims the sales manager and authorised representative of Eppinger, Joel Judas. “We try to provide our customers with efficient solutions to improve their processes and applications individually”.\n\nAnd here is another advantage. Eppinger offers a wide range of products and services from a single source. The company provides its customers with solutions around the tool holders as well as from the gear range. The complete know-how bundled from one source. A great benefit for the customer, but also for Doosan.\n\nFor Doosan, the supplier Eppinger has long ceased to be a pure parts supplier, but at the same time a development and innovation partner that contributes to Doosan’s competitiveness.\n\nThe managing partner Uwe Eppinger, at Doosan Machine Tools’ headquarters in Korea, will accept the award.\n\nThe award ceremony was postponed for the time being because of the Corona crisis.\n\nAbout the company:\n\nThe Eppinger Group is a medium-sized, family-owned company based in Denkendorf / Baden-Württemberg. The company has been specializing in precision tools for lathes for almost 100 years and is a leader in the design and manufacture of tool holders for CNC Turning & Milling Centres.\n\nThe product range includes fixed and driven tool holders and complete tool systems.\n\nAnother competence is the development of rotary tables.\n\nIn addition, Eppinger today also develops and produces special precision gear units that are used in all areas of mechanical engineering.\n\nThe product range includes angular and coaxial gear units as well as geared motors for a wide variety of applications in robotics, mechanical engineering and plant construction.\n\nThe high-quality products occupy a leading position on the international market. Eppinger offers individual and end-to-end solutions from a single source: from development and design to production.\n\nDenkendorf, 20th of November, 2019 - Eppinger enters a new business sector: for the first time, the manufacturer of innovative tool systems and tool holders presented a range of rotary tables for machine tools at the EMO Hannover. The new rotary tables are available with rotary plate sizes from 160 mm to 320 mm and are suitable for both initial installation and retrofitting of vertical and horizontal milling machines.\n\n“We have used more than 30 rotary tables of different brands at our production sites for many years,” says Managing Director Uwe Eppinger. That's why we are well aware of the pros and cons of installation, flexible application, maintenance costs and decreasing accuracy.”\n\nThe increasing degree of automation in the own production also requires a more compact design of the rotary tables which allows the use of suitable clamping devices without restricting the required travel distance of the machining axes too much.\n\nAlthough the existing market is already highly competitive, Eppinger company is venturing into this segment now. “Our rotary tables differ significantly from existing solutions. They have been used for some time in our own manufacturing where they gradually replace the third-party products,” explains the Managing Director. “We were not always satisfied with the products previously existed on the market.”\n\nThe reason is that for our own production of tools, wheel gears and gear units we need the rotary tables that can be quickly and precisely positioned, which are extremely compact and suitable for fine grinding as well as for rough milling operations. In addition, they should be easily integrated into existing vertical and horizontal machining centres and used there in a flexible way. “Since we could not find suitable rotary tables on the market for our specific requirements in this specific combination, we developed them ourselves.”\n\nThe company was able to rely on its many years of experience in the design and manufacture of high-precision components for machine tools as well as in drive technology. “The high requirements to the positioning accuracy and compactness could only be achieved with a preloaded drive system and integrated angle measuring system. When developing the rotary tables, we thought very hard to come up with an absolute innovation on the market,” emphasizes Uwe Eppinger.\n\nThe concept of rotary tables is coming up\n\nAnd the concept seems to work. An essential distinguishing feature to other rotary tables is the preloaded, backlash-free twin-engine drive which allows quick indexing even without clamping. Furthermore, an integrated angle sensor on the rotary plate ensures the highest positioning accuracy even with changing loads. Although this principle is already used for larger rotary tables, Eppinger company found for the first time a more practicable solution to implement this also for rotary tables with rotary plate sizes from 160 mm to 320 mm. Although the angle measuring system integrated into the housing measures the angle directly on the rotary plate and compensates for mechanical interferences, the preloaded drive makes it possible to set up a high control loop gain. Only in this way it is possible to make the bidirectional positioning extremely precise in the angular seconds range.\n\nTo integrate into already existing machines, the company from Denkendorf relies on a plug-and-play concept. This applies both to the connection of the rotary tables within the processing area of the machine (via splash-proof plug connector) as well as to the electrical connection to the machine control system - via a specially developed machine interface unit. Thus, the rotary tables are suitable both for the initial installation as well as for the retrofitting of vertical and horizontal milling machines. When placing the rotary spindle, precision classes from 3 μm down to 1.5 μm in lapped or ground execution are available, both for radial and axial run-out.\n\nAn obvious benefit is the so-called multi-disc clamp which is installed as standard. It ensures a strong clamping at high machining forces, since it clamps the rotary plate directly. Apart from a high clamping torque, a high torsional rigidity is achieved which in turn ensures high surface qualities with changing cutting forces. “This aspect is often disregarded since high clamping torque does not mean high clamping rigidity at the same time,” says Uwe Eppinger based on his experience.\n\nThe rotary plate can be exchanged precisely using a taper planar support with radial and axial change accuracies of 3 μm and more. As a result, workpieces from well-known manufacturers such as Hainbuch, Lang or Erowa can be precisely clamped over T-slots, short taper clamps or workpiece clamping systems.\n\n“In this case, we rely on a system similar to that of our proven tool holders with Prexi-Flex spindle interface.” However, when using the rotary tables - in contrast to the Prexi-Flex interface - it is the planar support which is rigid and not the cone which stays flexible due to a machined groove. This guarantees a stable taper planar support where a very high change accuracy is achieved at the same time.\n\nFlexible plates and simple installation\n\nThe production specialists from Denkendorf have also integrated an exchangeable plate system into the new rotary tables. Thus, the customer has the option right when placing an order or even later to choose whether he wants to have equipped the rotary table with rotary plate, plate with T-slots or with a spindle nose. The buyer can also decide whether he prefers a left-sided, right-sided or elevated rotary table: the rotary table can be easily turned due to its symmetrical housing shape. And finally, a problem-free installation of the rotary tables is ensured due to the specially developed plug-and-play connection concept. As the rotary tables are supplied with their own preconfigured axis controller, no additional axis controller or axis controller configuration by a service technician is required on the machine side during installation.\n\nMaintenance friendly to the machine\n\nThe new rotary tables of Eppinger are also particularly easy to maintain. In contrast to the known solutions, clearance and wear are automatically compensated over the lifetime which considerably increases availability and service life of the product. Optionally one or more rotary axes can be connected to one machine with the innovative machine interface unit. If the rotary table is to be used on another machine, no reconfiguration of the machine control system is needed which reduces machine downtime and involvement of service technicians. Workpiece clamping systems and material feeding systems can be controlled via the machine interface unit without having to additionally activate M functions."
