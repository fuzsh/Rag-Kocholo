        "text": "Data protection\n\nData protection is of particular significance to FAS GmbH. Our particular efforts to comply with the requirements of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the German data protection law in its latest version are aligned with our aim of looking after your privacy and personal sphere.\n\nFor modern businesses like FAS GmbH, the use of electronic data processing has become indispensable. We assure you that we implement utmost care in ensuring our compliance with legal requirements.\n\nUsing the webpages of FAS GmbH (Adiungo) in its basic form is possible without divulging any personal data. However, if an affected person wishes to use specialised business services via our website, it may be necessary to process personal data. Should processing of personal data be required and such processing does not have legal footing, we will generally request consent of said person.\n\nIn no case will we sell or lease your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes or other uses. If you do not agree with the terms of the data protection regulation, please do not transmit personal data to us.\n\n1. General / Definitions\n\nThis data protection declaration is based on terms in the GDPO and should be easy to read and understand for any and all persons. Hence, we would like to define various terms in advance:\n\na) Personal data\n\nPersonal data is all information referring to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereafter referred to as “affected person”). A natural person is considered identifiable if they can be identified directly or indirectly, particularly by allocating them to an identifier like a name, a numerical code, location data, online identification or to one or several special characteristics which express the physical, physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural or social identity of this natural person.\n\nb) Affected person / party\n\nAn affected person is any identified or identifiable natural person whose personal data is processed by a person tasked with processing.\n\nc) Processing\n\nProcessing is every task, carried out with or without aid of automated procedures, or every such row of tasks connected to personal data, such as collecting, recording, organising, sorting, saving, adapting or changing, reading out, searching for, using, disclosing through transmission, processing or another type of provision, comparing or connecting, restricting, deleting or destroying.\n\nd) Restrictions of processing\n\nRestriction of processing means marking saved personal data with the aim of restricting its processing in future.\n\ne) Profiling\n\nProfiling is every type of automated processing of personal data, in which such personal data is used to assess particular personal aspects related to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects regarding work performance, economic position, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or change of location of this natural person.\n\nf) Pseudonymisation\n\nPseudonymisation is processing of personal data in such a way that personal data can no longer be allocated to a specific person without additional information, as long as such additional information is stored separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure said personal data cannot be allocated to an identified or identifiable natural person.\n\ng) Responsible party\n\nA responsible party is the natural or legal person, authority, institution or other organisation which solely or jointly with others makes decisions regarding the purposes and means of processing personal data. If the purposes and means of such processing are provided for by Union law or the laws of the member states, the responsible party and/or the specific criteria for its designation can be stipulated as per Union law and the laws of the member states.\n\nh) Processor / data processor\n\nA processor / data processor is a natural or legal person, authority, institution or other organisation, which processes the personal data on behalf of the responsible party.\n\ni) Recipient\n\nA recipient is a natural or legal person, authority, institution or other organisation to which personal data is divulged, irrespective of whether this is a third party or not. Authorities, which may receive personal data within the framework of a specific evaluation contract as per Union law or the laws of the member states, are not considered recipients.\n\nj) Third party\n\nA third party is a natural or legal person, authority, institution or other organisation apart from the affected person, responsible party, processor and the persons under the direct responsibility of the responsible party or the processor, who are authorised to process personal data.\n\nk) Consent\n\nConsent is every declaration of will or other clear confirmatory action given by the affected person for a specific case in an informed manner and with which the affected person insinuates their consent to the processing of personal data pertaining to them.\n\n2. Information regarding the collection of personal data\n\n(1) Below we provide information regarding the collection of personal data when using our website. Personal data is data, which refers to you, e.g. name, address, e-mail addresses, user behaviour etc.\n\n(2) Responsible party as per art 4 para 7 EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is\n\nFAS GmbH, as represented by managing director Karl Späth\n\nKäthe-Paulus-Straße 6\n\n85092 Kösching\n\nTel.: +49 8456 9231 400\n\nE-Mail: info@fahrerassistenzsysteme.de\n\nWebsite: www.fahrerassistenzsysteme.de // www.adiungo.jobs\n\n(3) Our data protection official is:\n\nThe attorney Sascha Weller, IDR – Institut für Datenschutzrecht (Institute for Data Protection Law)\n\nZiegelbräustraße 7\n\n85049 Ingolstadt, Germany\n\nTel.: +49 (0)841 – 885 167 15\n\nE-mail: ra-weller@idr-datenschutz.de\n\nWebsite: www.idr-datenschutz.de\n\n(4) When you contact us by e-mail or using a contact form, the data you transmit to us (your e-mail address, possibly your name and your phone number) is automatically saved by us in order to answer your questions. Such personal data transmitted by the affected person to the person responsible for processing will only be saved for purposes of processing or making contact with the affected person. The data collected in this context will be deleted once it no longer needs to be saved or its processing will be restricted should legal storage requirements exist.\n\n(5) Should we instruct service providers for individual functions of our offering or want to use them for advertising purposes, we will provide detailed information regarding each procedure below. We will also indicate the set storage duration.\n\n(6) As the person responsible for processing, we have implemented numerous technical and organisational measures to ensure continuous protection for personal data processed via this webpage. However, internet-based data transmission can be subject to safety issues, meaning absolute safeguards cannot be guaranteed. Due to this fact it is at every affected person’s discretion to transmit personal data using an alternative route, e.g. via phone.\n\n(7) We are a conscientious company and do not implement automatic decision making or profiling.\n\n3. Your rights\n\n(1) You have the following rights towards us regarding your personal data:\n\n- Right to information:\n\nThe GDPR has granted every person affected by processing of personal data the right to request information regarding any personal data saved, pertaining to them, at any time and free of charge, from the person responsible for processing and to receive a copy of this information. Furthermore, the European guidelines and regulation body has guaranteed the person affected information regarding the following details:\n\na) the processing purposes\n\nb) the category of personal data being processed\n\nc) the recipients or categories of recipients to which the personal data has been disclosed or is still being disclosed, particularly concerning recipients in third countries or international organisations\n\nd) if possible the planned duration for which personal data will be stored or, if this is not possible, the criteria used to determine said duration\n\ne) the existence of a right to correction or deletion of personal data pertaining to you or to restriction of processing by the responsible party or right to object to said processing\n\nf) the existence of a right to complain to an advisory authority\n\ng) should personal data not be collected regarding the affected person: all available information regarding the origin of such data\n\nh) the existence of automated decision making including profiling as per article 22 para 1 and 4 GDPO and - at least in these cases - meaningful information regarding the logic involved as well as the scope and desired impact of such processing for the affected person\n\nFurthermore, the affected person is entitled to a right to information whether personal data has been transmitted to a third country or an international organisation. Should this be the case, the affected person is also entitled to receive information regarding suitable guarantees in relation to such transmission.\n\nShould an affected person wish to make use of this right to information, they are entitled to contact an employee of the party responsible for processing.\n\n- Right to withdraw data protection consent:\n\nEvery person affected by the processing of personal data has the right to withdraw consent to processing of personal data at any time.\n\nShould an affected person wish to make use of this right to withdraw consent, they are entitled to contact an employee of the party responsible for processing at any time and via any communication channel.\n\n- Right to correction:\n\nThe affected person has the right to request the responsible party immediately correct any incorrect personal data pertaining to them. With respect to the purposes of processing, the affected party has the right to request any incomplete data be completed - also by way of supplemental statement.\n\nShould an affected person wish to make use of this right to information, they are entitled to contact an employee of the party responsible for processing.\n\n- Right to deletion / right to be forgotten:\n\nThe affected person has the right to request any personal data pertaining to them be deleted and the responsible party is obligated to immediately delete personal data, should one of the following reasons apply:\n\na) the personal data is no longer needed for the purposes it was collected for or otherwise processed.\n\nb) the affected person withdraws their consent, on which processing is based as per article 6 paragraph 1 letter a or article 9 paragraph 2 letter a, and there is no other legal footing for processing.\n\nc) the affected person enters an objection to processing as per article 21 paragraph 1 and there are no justifying reasons for processing which take precedence, or the affected party enters an objection to processing as per article 21 paragraph 2.\n\nd) the personal data was wrongfully processed.\n\ne) deletion of personal data is required to fulfil a legal requirement as per Union law or the laws of the member states, which the responsible party is subject to.\n\nf) the personal data was collected in relation to services offered by the information society as per article 8 paragraph 1.\n\nShould an affected person wish to make use of this right to deletion / right to be forgotten, they are entitled to contact an employee of the party responsible for processing.\n\nShould we have published personal data and are obligated to delete it in accordance with art 17 paragraph 1 GDPO, we will take measures, subject to available technology and implementation costs, also drawing upon technical solutions, to inform the person responsible for data processing who carries out processing of personal data, that an affected person has requested deletion of all links to such personal data or of copies or replications of such personal data. Our employees will arrange all necessary measures.\n\n- Right to restrictions of processing:\n\nThe affected person has the right to request the responsible party immediately restrict the processing, should one of the following reasons apply:\n\na) the accuracy of the personal data pertaining to the affected party is disputed for a duration, which makes it possible for the responsible party to assess the accuracy of such personal data,\n\nb) processing is unlawful and the affected person refuses deletion of personal data but requests restriction of use of such personal data;\n\nc) the responsible party no longer requires the personal data for purposes of processing but the affected person requires it to assert, execute or defend legal claims, or\n\nd) the affected party has entered an objection to processing as per article 21 paragraph 1, as long as it is not yet clear whether the justified reasons of the responsible party take precedence over those of the affected party.\n\nShould an affected person wish to make use of this right to restriction of processing, they are entitled to contact an employee of the party responsible for processing.\n\n- Right to object to processing:\n\nThe GDPR has granted every person affected by processing of personal data the right to enter an objection at any time to the processing of any personal data pertaining to them, arising through special situations, based on art 6 para 1 letter e or f of the GDPR. This is also valid for profiling based on these regulations.\n\nWe will no longer process personal data in case of such an objection, unless we can illustrate compelling and legitimate reasons for processing, which take precedence over the interests, rights and freedoms of the affected person, or if processing serves the assertion, execution or defence of legal claims.\n\nShould we process personal data for direct advertising, the affected party has the right to enter an objection against processing of personal data for purposes of such advertisement. This is also true for profiling as far as it is connected with such direct advertising. If the affected party objects to our processing for purposes of direct advertising, we will no longer process such personal data for these purposes.\n\nFurthermore, the affected person has the right to enter an objection to processing of personal data pertaining to them, which is carried out by us for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes, as per art 89 para 1 GDPO, unless such processing is required to fulfil a task which is in the public interest.\n\nTo exercise the right to object, an affected person can contact any employee directly. The affected person is also entitled to exercise their right to object via automated procedures, where technical specifications are used, in connection with use of services of the information society, irrespective or directive 2002/58/EC.\n\n- Right to data portability:\n\nThe affected party has the right to receive the personal data pertaining to them and which has been disclosed to the responsible party, in a structured, common and machine-readable format and has the right to transmit this data to another responsible party without being hindered by the responsible party, who was provided with the data, if\n\na) processing is based on consent as per article 6 paragraph 1 letter a or article 9 paragraph 2 letter a or a contract according to article 6 paragraph 1 letter b and\n\nb) processing is carried out using an automated process.\n\nWhen exercising your right to data portability as per art 20 para 1 GDPO the affected party has the right to request personal data be transmitted by one responsible party directly to another responsible party, as long as this is technically feasible and the rights and freedoms of other persons are not affected.\n\nShould an affected person wish to make use of this right to data portability, they are entitled to contact an employee of the party responsible for processing at any time.\n\n- Automated decision in individual cases including profiling\n\nThe GDPR has granted every person affected by processing of personal data the right no to be subject to a decision exclusively based on automated processing - including profiling - which has legal effect on them or substantially affects them in a similar manner, as long as the decision is\n\n(1) not necessary for completion or fulfilment of a contract between the affected party and the responsible party, or\n\n(2) is permissible based on legislation of the Union or the member states which the responsible party is subject to and this legislation contains appropriate measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms as well as justified interests of the affected person, or\n\n(3) made with express consent from the affected party.\n\nIf the decision is required for completion or fulfilment of a contract between the affected person and the responsible person or it is made with express consent from the affected person, we will take appropriate measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms as well as justified interests of the affected person. As a minimum, this includes the right to request action by a person at the responsible party, to express their own standpoint and to protest against the decision.\n\nShould an affected person wish to make use of rights regarding automated decision, they are entitled to contact an employee of the party responsible for processing at any time.\n\n(2) Furthermore, you have the right to launch a complaint about our processing your personal data with a data protection regulatory authority.

Collection of personal data during visits to our website / cookies\n\n(1) When our website is used only for information and when you do not register or transmit information to us otherwise, we only collect personal data which your browser transmits to our server. If you want to view our website, we only collect the following data which is technically required in order to show you our website and to guarantee stability and safety (legal footing is art 6 para 1 pg 1 of GDPR):\n\n- IP address\n\n- date and time of request\n\n- time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)\n\n- internet service provider of accessing system\n\n- content of request (concrete page)\n\n- access status/HTTP status code\n\n- amount of data transmitted each\n\n- website, the request stems from (referrer)\n\n- browser\n\n- operating system of their surface\n\n- language and version of browser software.\n\n(2) In addition to the above data, cookies are saved on your computer during your use of our website. Cookies are small text files, which are saved to your hard drive, allocated to the browser you used and through which the location that set the cookie (in this case by us) is provided with specific information. Cookies cannot carry out programmes or transmit viruses to your computer. Their purpose is to make the internet offering more user friendly and effective in general.\n\n(3) Use of cookies:\n\n1. In general we differentiate between the following types/functions of cookies:\n\na) Transient cookies are automatically deleted when you close the browser. In particular this includes session cookies. They save a so-called session ID to allocate different requests of your browser to the joint session. This means your computer can be recognised when you return to our website. Session cookies are deleted when you log out or close the browser.\n\nb) Persistent cookies are automatically deleted after a set duration which differs from cookie to cookie. You can delete these cookies at any time in the security settings of your browser.\n\nc) Necessary cookies are absolutely required for the use of a homepage.\n\nd) Statistics, marketing or personalisation cookies are used among other things to measure framework and reach and for example, also when the interests of a user or their behaviour within a user profile are saved. This procedure is also called “tracking”. Should we use cookies or “tracking” services, we will inform you separately to our data protection declaration or within the framework of a request for consent.\n\ne) You can configure your browser settings as desired and for example refuse acceptance of third party cookies or all cookies. Please be advised that you may not be able to use all functions of this website.\n\nf) We use cookies to identify returning users should they have an account with us. Otherwise, you would have to log in anew on each visit.\n\ng) The Flash cookies used are not collected by your browser, but by your Flash plug-in. Furthermore, we use HTML5 storage objects that are stored on your terminal device. These objects store the required data independently of the browser you are using and have no automatic expiration date. If you do not want Flash cookies to be processed, you must install an appropriate add-on, such as \"Better Privacy\" for Mozilla Firefox (https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/betterprivacy/) or the Adobe Flash Killer Cookie for Google Chrome. You can prevent the use of HTML5 storage objects by using private mode in your browser. We also recommend that you regularly delete your cookies and browser history manually.\n\n2. As a rule data processed with the assistance of cookies are processed based on our permissible interests (art 6 para 1 lit f) or, should use of cookies be required, to fulfil our contractual obligations (art 6 para 1 lit b). When we ask for your consent, your declaration of consent forms the legal basis to processing data (art 6 para 1 lit a).\n\n3. Of course you can always withdraw your consent or object to processing of your data via cookie technologies (“opt out”). Your objection can initially be made using the settings in your browser. An objection to the use of cookies for purposes of online marketing can also be made via numerous services, mainly in case of tracking via the US page http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or the EU page http://www.youronlinechoices.com/ or generally on http://optout.aboutads.info.\n\n5. Further functions and offerings of our web site\n\n(1) Apart from using our website purely for information, we offer various services you can use should they be of interest. For this you will usually have to provide further personal data, required to perform each service and which are subject to the above guidelines for data processing.\n\n(2) We partially use external service provider to process your data. They have been carefully selected and instructed by us, are subject to our direction and are regularly controlled.\n\n(3) The hosting services we use serve the provision of the following services: Infrastructure and platform services, computing capacity, disk space und data base services, security services as well as technical maintenance services we use for purposes of operating this online offering.\n\nIn this context we and/or our hosting provider process inventory data, contact data, content data, contract data, usage data, meta and communication data from customers, prospects and visitors of this online offering based on our justified interests in an efficient and safe way of provision of this online offering as per art 6 para 1 lit 1 of GDPR in connection with art 28 GDPR.\n\n(4) Furthermore, we can transfer your personal data to third parties if we offer participation in special offers, competitions, conclusion of contracts or similar services jointly with our partners. More information will be provided upon provision of your personal data or below in the description of the offering.\n\n(5) Should we have service providers or partners based in a state outside the European Economic Area (EEA) we will inform you about the consequences of this situation in the description of the offering.\n\n6. Data protection for applicants\n\nThe party responsible for processing collects and processes personal data of applicants in order to carry out the application procedure. Processing can also occur via electronic means. This is particularly the case when applicants transmit related application materials via electronic means, for example e-mail or via contact forms on internet pages, to the party responsible for processing. If the party responsible for processing concludes a labour contract with an applicant, the transmitted data is saved for purposes of executing the labour contract, in accordance with legal requirements. If the party responsible for processing does no conclude a labour contract with the applicant, application materials are automatically deleted as long as such deletion does not affect any other justified interests of the party responsible for processing. Other justified interests in this sense are, for example, the burden of proof in a trial as per the General Equal Treatment Law (Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz, AGG).\n\nProcessing applicant data is carried out to fulfil our (pre-)contractual obligations within the framework of the application procedure as per art 6 para 1 lit b GDPR art 6 para 1 lit f GDPR as long as data processing becomes necessary for us, e.g. within the framework of legal proceedings (in Germany § 26 of the Federal Data Protection Act, BDSG also applies).\n\n7. Objection or withdrawal against the processing of your data\n\n(1) Should you have consented to the processing of your data, you can withdraw such consent at any time via any communication channel. Such withdrawal will influence the legality of processing your personal data after you have informed us accordingly.\n\n(2) As far as we base the processing of your personal data on a balancing of interests, you are entitled to enter an objection. This is the case if processing is not particularly required to fulfil a contract with you, as per our below description of functions. When entering an objection please provide the reasons why your personal data should not be processed by us. In case of a justified objection we will assess the situation and will either halt data processing and/or adjust it or illustrate to you our compelling legitimate grounds based on which we will continue processing.\n\n(3) Of course you are entitled to object to processing of your personal data for purposes of advertising and data analysis. You can contact us regarding your objection via the address stated in number 2 (2).\n\n8. Legal and contractual requirements for provision of personal data / requirement for conclusion of contract / consequences of non-provision / deletion\n\n(1) We would like to inform you that provision of personal data is legally required in part. However, it can also be possible, that an affected person must provide us with personal data so that a contract can be executed. Non-provision would mean the contract cannot be concluded. Our employees are happy to assist with questions regarding individual cases.\n\n(2) Data processed by us is deleted or restricted in its processing according to art 17 and 18 GDPR. Provided it is not explicitly stated in the framework of this data protection declaration, data we have saved is deleted as soon as it is no longer needed for its intended purpose and no statutory storage obligations contradict it. Should data not be deleted as it is required for other and lawful purposes, its processing is restricted, i.e. data is locked and not processed for other purposes. This is true for data which has to be saved e.g. for trade and taxation reasons.\n\nAs per legal requirements, data is stored specifically for 10 years according to §§ 147 para 1 of the German tax code (AO), 257 para 1 no 1 and 4, para 4 German commercial code, HGB (books, records, status reports, accounting vouchers, trading books, documentation relating to taxation etc.) and 6 years according to § 257 para 1 no 2 and 3, para 4 HGB (commercial letters).\n\n9. Use of our portal / registration on our website\n\n(1) Should you wish to use our portal / the registration on our website, you have to register via provision of your e-mail address, a password you create yourself as well as your first name and last name. There is no requirement to use your real name; it is possible to use a pseudonym. For registration we utilise a so-called double-opt-in procedure, i.e. your registration is only complete once you confirm your registration by clicking on the link sent to you in a confirmation e-mail for this purpose, before registration. Should you not provide such confirmation within 24 hours your registration will automatically be deleted from our database. Provision of the above details is required, any further information can be provided voluntarily during use of our portal.\n\n(2) If you use our portal / the registration on our website we will save your data required to fulfil a contract until you ultimately delete your log in. Furthermore, we store the data you voluntarily provide during the time of your use of our portal, provided you do not delete it beforehand. You can manage and amend all details in the protect customer area. Legal footing is art 6 para 1 pg 1 lit b) or f) of GDPR.\n\n(3) Registration on the website of a party responsible for processing also leads to storage of the IP address allocated to the affected party by the internet service provider (ISP), the date as well as time of registration. This data is stored as it is the only way to prevent abuse of our services and if needed this data can enable us to get to the bottom of a committed crime. As such storage of this data is required to safeguard processing by the responsible party. Transfer of this data to third parties does generally not take place provided there is no legal duty to transfer or such transfer would assist prosecution.\n\n(4) If you use the portal / registration on our website, your data may become accessible to other participants of the portal in accordance with the contractual performance. Non-registered members will not receive any information about you.\n\n(5) To prevent unauthorised access to your personal data by third parties, the connection is encrypted using SSL/TLS technology.\n\n10. Web analytics\n\n1. Use of Google Analytics\n\n(1) This website uses Google Analytics, a service for website analysis by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies”, text files which are saved to your computer and enable us to analyse your use of the website. The information regarding your use of this website, which is generated by cookies, is generally transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. Should IP anonymisation be activated on this website, your IP address will be shortened beforehand, within the member states of the European Union or other contracting states to the treaty regarding the European Economic Area.

This means the IP address is further processed in a shortened format and can no longer be connected to a particular person. Should a connection to a particular person be possible via data collected about you, this will immediately be precluded, including immediate deletion of personal data. The data we send which is connected via cookies, logins (e.g. user IDs) or advertising IDs is automatically deleted after 14 months. Deletion of data which has reached its storage term is carried out automatically once a month.\n\n(5) We use Google Analytics to analyse and regularly improve the use of our website.

Use of ajax.googleapis.com and jQuery\n\n(1) On this site, we use Ajax and jQuery technologies, which allows us to optimize loading speeds. In this regard, program libraries are called from Google servers. Google's CDN (content delivery network) is used. If you have previously used jQuery on another page from the Google CDN, your browser will fall back to the cached copy. If this is not the case, this will require a download, whereby data from your browser will be sent to Google!Inc. (\"Google\"). Your data will be transferred to the USA. You can find out more on the pages of the providers.\n\n(2) The legal basis for the processing of your data is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f DS-GVO.\n\n2. Google Tag Manager\n\nGoogle Tag Manager is a solution that allows us to manage so-called website tags via an interface (and thus, for example, integrate Google Analytics as well as other Google marketing services into our online offer). The Tag Manager itself (which implements the tags) does not process any personal data of the users. With regard to the processing of users' personal data, please refer to the following information on Google services. Usage Policy: https://www.google.com/intl/de/tagmanager/use-policy.html.\n\n3. Oveleon Contao Cookiebar\n\n(1) Our website uses the cookie consent technology Oveleon Contao Cookiebar to obtain your consent to store certain cookies in your browser and to document this consent in a data protection compliant manner. The provider of this technology is Oveleon GbR, Mr. Fabian Ekert, Auestraße 1, 51379 Leverkusen.\n\n(2) When you enter our website, a cookie is stored in your browser, in which the consents you have given or the revocation of these consents are stored.\n\n(3) The collected data will be stored until you request us to delete it or until you delete the corresponding cookie yourself or until the purpose for storing the data no longer applies. Mandatory legal retention periods remain unaffected. Details on data processing by Oveleon GbR can be found at https://www.oveleon.de/datenschutz.html.\n\n(4) The Oveleon Contao Cookiebar is used to obtain the legally required consent for the use of cookies. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a, c DSGVO.\n\n12. Newsletter\n\n(1) With your consent, you can subscribe to our newsletter, with which we inform you about our current interesting offers. The advertised goods and services are named in the declaration of consent.\n\n(2) For the registration to our newsletter we use the so-called double-opt-in procedure. This means that after your registration, we will send you an e-mail to the e-mail address you provided, in which we ask you to confirm that you wish to receive the newsletter. If you do not confirm your registration within 24 hours, your information will be blocked and automatically deleted after one month. In addition, we store in each case your IP addresses used, the computer system used and the times of registration and confirmation. The purpose of this procedure is to be able to prove your registration and, if necessary, to clarify any possible misuse of your personal data.\n\n(3) The personal data collected during registration for the newsletter is used exclusively for sending our newsletter. Furthermore, subscribers to the newsletter could be informed by e-mail if this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or a related registration, as could be the case in the event of changes to the newsletter offer or changes in the technical circumstances. No personal data collected as part of the newsletter service will be passed on to third parties.\n\n(4) The only mandatory information for sending the newsletter is your e-mail address. The provision of further, separately marked data is voluntary and will be used to address you personally. After your confirmation, we store your e-mail address for the purpose of sending the newsletter. The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a DS-GVO.\n\n(5) You can revoke your consent to the sending of the newsletter at any time and unsubscribe from the newsletter. You can send the revocation to us by any means of communication, for example by clicking on the link provided in each newsletter email, by email to support@adiungo.jobs or by sending a message to the contact details provided in the imprint.\n\n(6) We would like to point out that we evaluate your user behaviour when sending the newsletter. For this evaluation, the emails sent contain so-called web beacons or tracking pixels, which are single-pixel image files stored on our website. For the evaluations, we link the data mentioned in section 4 and the web beacons with your e-mail address and an individual ID. You can object to this tracking at any time by clicking on the separate link provided in each email or by informing us via any other contact channel. The information will be stored for as long as you are subscribed to the newsletter. After unsubscribing, we store the data purely statistically and anonymously. Moreover, such tracking is not possible if you have deactivated the display of images by default in your e-mail program. In this case, the newsletter will not be fully displayed to you and you may not be able to use all functions. If you display the images manually, the above-mentioned tracking will take place.\n\n(7) Newsletter - Mailchimp\n\nThe newsletter is sent using the dispatch service provider \"MailChimp\", a newsletter dispatch platform of the US provider Rocket Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE #5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA. You can view the privacy policy of the shipping service provider here: https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/. The shipping service provider is used on the basis of our legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO and an order processing agreement pursuant to Art. 28 para. 3 p. 1 DSGVO.\n\nThe dispatch service provider may use the data of the recipients in pseudonymous form, i.e. without assignment to a user, to optimize or improve its own services, e.g. to technically optimize the dispatch and presentation of the newsletters or for statistical purposes. However, the dispatch service provider does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to write to them itself or to pass the data on to third parties.\n\n13. Social Media\n\n1. Use of social media plug-ins/links\n\n(1) We currently use the following social media plug-ins/links: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn.\n\nWhen you visit our site, initially no personal data is passed on to the providers of the plug-ins/links. You can recognize the provider of the plug-in/link by the mark on the box above its initial letter or logo. We open the possibility for you to communicate directly with the provider of the plug-in/link via the button. Only if you click on the marked box and thereby activate it, the plug-in provider receives the information that you have called up the corresponding website of our online offer. In addition, the data mentioned under item 4 of this declaration is transmitted. In the case of Facebook, according to the respective providers in Germany, the IP address is anonymized immediately after collection. By activating the plug-in/link, personal data is therefore transmitted from you to the respective plug-in provider and stored there (in the case of US providers, in the USA). Since the plug-in/link provider collects the data in particular via cookies, we recommend that you delete all cookies via your browser's security settings before clicking on the grayed-out box.\n\n(2) We have neither influence on the collected data and data processing operations, nor are we aware of the full extent of the data collection, the purposes of the processing, the storage periods. We also have no information on the deletion of the collected data by the plug-in/link provider.\n\n(3) The plug-in/link provider stores the data collected about you as usage profiles and uses them for purposes of advertising, market research and/or demand-oriented design of its website. Such an evaluation is carried out in particular (also for users who are not logged in) for the display of needs-based advertising and to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our website. You have the right to object to the creation of these user profiles, whereby you must contact the respective plug-in/link provider to exercise this right. Via the plug-ins, we offer you the opportunity to interact with the social networks and other users so that we can improve our offer and make it more interesting for you as a user. The legal basis for the use of the plug-ins is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f DS-GVO.\n\n(4) The data transfer takes place regardless of whether you have an account with the plug-in/link provider and are logged in there. If you are logged in to the plug-in/link provider, your data collected by us will be directly assigned to your account with the plug-in/link provider. If you click the activated button and, for example, link to the page, the plug-in/link provider also saves this information in your user account and shares it publicly with your contacts. We recommend that you log out regularly after using a social network, but especially before activating the button, as this allows you to avoid an assignment to your profile with the plug-in/link provider.\n\n(5) For further information on the purpose and scope of data collection and its processing by the plug-in/link provider, please refer to the data protection declarations of these providers communicated below. There you will also receive further information on your rights in this regard and setting options for protecting your privacy.\n\n(6) Addresses of the respective plug-in/link providers and URL with their privacy notices:\n\n(a) Facebook Ireland Ltd, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland, parent company: Facebook, 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA; website: https://www.facebook.com; privacy policy: https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy; opt-out: settings for advertisements: https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads; additional privacy notices: agreement on joint processing of personal data on Facebook pages: https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum, privacy notices for Facebook pages: https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/information_about_page_insights_data\n\nb) LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, California 94043, USA; https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy.\n\nc) Instagram Inc., 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA, 94025, USA; This may include, for example, content such as images, videos or texts and buttons with which users can make known their liking of the content, the authors of the content or subscribe to our posts. If the users are members of the Instagram platform, Instagram can assign the call of the above-mentioned content and functions to the profiles of the users there. Privacy policy of Instagram: https://instagram.com/about/legal/privacy/.\n\nIntegration of YouTube videos\n\n(1) We have integrated YouTube videos into our online offer, which are stored on https://www.YouTube.com and can be played directly from our website. These are all integrated in \"extended data protection mode\", i.e. no data about you as a user is transmitted to YouTube if you do not play the videos. Only when you play the videos, the data mentioned in paragraph 2 are transmitted. We have no influence on this data transmission.\n\n(2) By visiting the website, YouTube receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding sub-page of our website. In addition, the data mentioned in paragraph 4 of this declaration are transmitted. This occurs regardless of whether YouTube provides a user account via which you are logged in or whether no user account exists. If you are logged in to Google, your data will be directly assigned to your account. If you do not want the assignment with your profile at YouTube, you must log out before activating the button. YouTube stores your data as usage profiles and uses them for the purposes of advertising, market research and/or demand-oriented design of its website. Such an evaluation is carried out in particular (even for users who are not logged in) to provide needs-based advertising and to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our website. You have the right to object to the creation of these user profiles, whereby you must contact YouTube to exercise this right.\n\n(3) The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) DSGVO (legitimate interests) and Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) DSGVO (consent).\n\n(4) For more information on the purpose and scope of data collection and its processing by YouTube, please refer to the privacy policy. There you will also find further information on your rights and setting options to protect your privacy: https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy.\n\n14. Online Advertising\n\n1. Use of Google AdSense\n\n(1) This website uses the online advertising service Google AdSense, through which you can be presented with advertising tailored to your interests. We thereby pursue the interest of showing you advertising that might be of interest to you in order to make our website more interesting for you. For this purpose, statistical information about you is collected and processed by our advertising partners. These advertisements are recognizable by the reference \"Google ads\" in the respective advertisement.\n\n(2) By visiting our website, Google receives the information that you have called up our website. For this purpose, Google uses a web beacon to set a cookie on your computer. The data mentioned under point 4 of this declaration is transmitted. We have no influence on the data collected, nor are we aware of the full extent of the data collection and the storage period. Your data will be transferred to the USA and evaluated there. If you are logged in with your Google account, your data can be directly assigned to it. If you do not want the assignment with your Google profile, you must log out. It is possible that this data will be passed on to third parties and authorities to contractual partners of Google. The legal basis for the processing of your data is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f DS-GVO. This website does not place third-party ads via Google AdSense.\n\n(3) You can prevent the installation of cookies from Google AdSense in various ways: a) by adjusting your browser software accordingly, in particular the suppression of third-party cookies will result in you not receiving ads from third-party providers; b) by deactivating interest-based ads on Google via the link https://www.google. de/ads/preferences, which setting will be deleted when you delete your cookies; c) by disabling the interest-based ads of the providers that are part of the self-regulatory campaign \"About Ads\" via the link https://www.aboutads.info/choices, which setting will be deleted when you delete your cookies; d) by permanently disabling them in your Firefox, Internetexplorer or Google Chrome browsers at the link https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin. We would like to point out that in this case you may not be able to use all functions of this offer to their full extent.\n\n(4) For more information on the purpose and scope of data collection and processing, as well as further information on your rights in this regard and setting options for protecting your privacy, please contact: Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountainview, California 94043, USA; Privacy policy for advertising: https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/technologies/ads; Privacy policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy.\n\n2. Use of Google Ads Conversion\n\n(1) We use the offer of Google Ads to draw attention to our attractive offers with the help of advertising media (so-called Google Ads) on external websites. In relation to the data of the advertising campaigns, we can determine how successful the individual advertising measures are. In this way, we pursue the interest of displaying advertising that is of interest to you, making our website more interesting for you and achieving a fair calculation of advertising costs.\n\n(2) These advertising materials are delivered by Google via so-called \"ad servers\". For this purpose, we use ad server cookies, through which certain parameters for measuring success, such as display of the ads or clicks by users, can be measured. If you access our website via a Google ad, Google Ads will store a cookie on your PC. These cookies usually lose their validity after 30 days and are not intended to identify you personally. For this cookie, the unique cookie ID, number of ad impressions per placement (frequency), last impression (relevant for post-view conversions) and opt-out information (marking that the user no longer wishes to be addressed) are usually stored as analysis values.\n\n(3) These cookies enable Google to recognize your internet browser. If a user visits certain pages of the website of an Ads customer and the cookie stored on his computer has not yet expired, Google and the customer can recognize that the user clicked on the ad and was redirected to this page. A different cookie is assigned to each Ads customer. Cookies can therefore not be tracked across Ads customers' websites. We ourselves do not collect or process any personal data in the aforementioned advertising measures. We only receive statistical evaluations from Google. Based on these evaluations, we can see which of the advertising measures used are particularly effective. We do not receive any further data from the use of the advertising media; in particular, we cannot identify users on the basis of this information.\n\n(4) Due to the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection with the Google server. We have no influence on the scope and further use of the data collected by Google through the use of this tool and therefore inform you according to our state of knowledge: Through the integration of Ads Conversion, Google receives the information that you have called up the relevant part of our website or clicked on an advertisement from us. If you are registered with a Google service, Google can assign the visit to your account. Even if you are not registered with Google or have not logged in, there is a possibility that the provider may obtain and store your IP address.\n\n(5) You can prevent participation in this tracking process in various ways: a) by making the appropriate settings in your browser software, in particular the suppression of third-party cookies will result in you not receiving ads from third-party providers; b) by disabling cookies for conversion tracking by setting your browser to block cookies from the domain \"www.googleadservices.com\", https://www.google. de/settings/ads, deleting this setting when you delete your cookies; c) by disabling the interest-based ads of the providers that are part of the self-regulatory campaign \"About Ads\" via the link https://www.aboutads.info/choices, deleting this setting when you delete your cookies; d) by permanently disabling them in your Firefox, Internetexplorer or Google Chrome browsers at the link https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin. We would like to point out that in this case you may not be able to use all functions of this offer in full.\n\n(6) The legal basis for the processing of your data is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f DS-GVO. Further information on data protection at Google can be found here: https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy and https://services.google.com/sitestats/de.html. Alternatively, you can visit the website of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) at https://www.networkadvertising.org.\n\n3. Remarketing\n\nIn addition to Ads Conversion, we use the Google Remarketing application. This is a procedure with which we would like to address you again. Through this application, our advertisements can be displayed to you during your further internet use after visiting our website. This is done by means of cookies stored in your browser, which Google uses to record and evaluate your usage behavior when you visit various websites. In this way, Google can determine your previous visit to our website. According to its own statements, Google does not combine the data collected in the course of remarketing with your personal data, which may be stored by Google. In particular, according to Google, pseudonymization is used in remarketing.\n\n4. Google Ads \"Lead Form Extensions\".\n\n(1) Lead form extensions allow us to capture leads, i.e. contact requests, directly via our Google Ads. We hereby give our prospects and potential customers a simple option to contact us directly.\n\n(2) The following personal data may be collected in this process: Name, email address, phone number and zip code. The leads generated in this way are stored by Google for a maximum of 30 days.\n\n(3) In addition, there are two tracking options for the lead extension. If the prospective customer clicks on the CTA button, a micro conversion is generated. If he sends the completed lead form, the actual lead conversion results. Through this tracking function, the performance of the lead extension can be analyzed and thus the extension can be continuously optimized.\n\n(4) This service is used in accordance with Art. 6 (1) f) DSGVO on the basis of our legitimate interest. This is that interested parties who search for our company on Google can contact us directly via the ad.\n\n5. DoubleClick by Google\n\n(1) This website continues to use the online marketing tool DoubleClick by Google. DoubleClick uses cookies to serve ads that are relevant to users, to improve campaign performance reports or to prevent a user from seeing the same ads more than once. Via a cookie ID, Google records which ads are displayed in which browser and can thus prevent them from being displayed more than once. In addition, DoubleClick can use cookie IDs to record so-called conversions that are related to ad requests. This is the case, for example, when a user sees a DoubleClick ad and later calls up the advertiser's website with the same browser and buys something there. According to Google, DoubleClick cookies do not contain any personal information.\n\n(2) Due to the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection with Google's server. We have no influence on the scope and further use of the data collected by Google through the use of this tool and therefore inform you according to our state of knowledge: Through the integration of DoubleClick, Google receives the information that you have called up the corresponding part of our website or clicked on an advertisement from us. If you are registered with a Google service, Google can assign the visit to your account. Even if you are not registered with Google or have not logged in, there is a possibility that the provider may obtain and store your IP address.\n\n(3) You can prevent participation in this tracking process in various ways: a) by making the appropriate settings in your browser software, in particular the suppression of third-party cookies will result in you not receiving ads from third-party providers; b) by disabling cookies for conversion tracking by setting your browser to block cookies from the domain \"www.googleadservices.com\", https://www.google. de/settings/ads, in which case this setting will be deleted when you delete your cookies; c) by disabling the interest-based ads of the providers that are part of the self-regulatory campaign \"About Ads\" via the link https://www.aboutads.info/choices, in which case this setting will be deleted when you delete your cookies; d) by permanently disabling them in your Firefox, Internetexplorer or Google Chrome browsers at the link https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin. We would like to point out that in this case you may not be able to use all functions of this offer in full.\n\n(4) The legal basis for the processing of your data is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f DS-GVO. For more information on DoubleClick by Google, please visit https://www.google.de/doubleclick and https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/2839090, and on data protection at Google in general: https://www.google. de/intl/en/policies/privacy.
