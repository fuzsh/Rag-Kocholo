Storage of data beyond that may occur if such storage is required by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws or other regulations to which the controller is subject. Blocking or erasure of data also takes place when a retention period mandated by the standards mentioned expires, unless the continued storage of data is required for the conclusion of a contract or the fulfilment of contractual obligations.\n\n1.5 Security of Processing\n\nWe have implemented appropriate and state-of-the-art technical and organisational security measures (TOMs). Thus, the data that is processed by us is protected against accidental or intentional manipulation, loss, destruction and unauthorized access.\n\nThese security measures include in particular the encrypted transfer of data between your browser and our server.\n\n1.6 Transfer of Data to Third Parties, Subcontractors and Third Party Providers\n\nA transfer of personal data to third parties only occurs within the framework of legal requirements.

However, this may mean that our website can no longer be used to its full extent.\n\nThe data will not be passed on to third parties. Matomo uses user data in anonymous form so that we can optimize this website and our offer. IP addresses are stored by Matomo without the last digits. In this respect, we can determine from which network an inquiry comes. It is therefore not possible to assign the IP address to a computer.\n\nYou can disable Matomo's data collection here. If your browser supports the \"Do-Not-Track\" technology and you have activated it, your visit is automatically ignored.\n\nYou have the possibility to prevent that actions you have taken here are analyzed and linked.

It cannot be ruled out that Google also transmits the information to a server in a third country.\n\nThe transmission to the USA depends on the function in which personal data is transmitted.

However, Google states that, in principle, the following information (including personal data) may be processed, among others:\n\nLog data (in particular the IP address)\n\nLocation-related information\n\nUnique application numbers\n\nCookies and similar technologies\n\nInformation on the types of cookies used by Google can be found at https://policies.google.com/technologies/types.\n\nIf you are logged into your Google account, Google may add the processed information to your account depending on your account settings and treat it as personal data.\n\nGoogle states the following about this, among other things:\n\n\"If you are not signed into a Google Account, we store the data we collect with unique identifiers associated with the browser, app, or device you are using.

With the help of remarketing audiences, we also want to ensure that our ads correspond to the potential interest of users and do not have a harassing effect.\n\nWe use Google Analytics with IP anonymization enabled.\n\nGoogle Analytics stores cookies in your web browser for a period of two years since your last visit.

No further data is collected, or only on a voluntary basis.\n\nWe use the \"Brevo\" service to send newsletters. The provider is Sendinblue GmbH (Köpenicker Straße 126, 10179 Berlin, Germany) - hereinafter referred to as the service provider. Your data is stored on Sendinblue GmbH servers in Germany.\n\nYou can find detailed information about the service and the service provider here:\n\nhttps://www.brevo.com/de/datenschutz-uebersicht/sowie\n\nhttps://www.brevo.com/de/legal/privacypolicy/.\n\nUsage analysis\n\nWith the help of Brevo, we are able to analyze our newsletter campaigns. For example, we can see whether a newsletter message has been opened and which links have been clicked on. In this way, we can determine, among other things, which links were clicked on particularly often.\n\nWe can also recognize whether certain previously defined actions were carried out by the newsletter recipient after opening/clicking (conversion rate). For example, we can recognize whether a room was booked or a table reserved after clicking on the newsletter.\n\nIf you do not wish to be analyzed by Brevo, you must unsubscribe from the newsletter. For this purpose, we provide a corresponding link in every e-mail/newsletter.\n\nYou can find detailed information on the functions of Brevo here:\n\nhttps://www.brevo.com/de/newsletter-software/.\n\nLegal basis\n\nData processing is based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can revoke this consent at any time. The legality of the data processing operations that have already taken place remains unaffected by the revocation.\n\nThe legal basis for the usage analysis is the balancing of interests pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.\n\nWe have concluded a data processing agreement (DPA) with the service provider in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR for the use of Brevo. This ensures that the service provider processes the personal data of our newsletter recipients only in accordance with our instructions and in compliance with the GDPR.\n\nStorage period\n\nYour data processed in Brevo will be stored by us or the service provider until you unsubscribe from the newsletter and deleted from the newsletter distribution list after you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Data stored by us for other purposes remains unaffected by this.\n\nAfter you unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, your e-mail address may be stored by us or the service provider in a blacklist if this is necessary to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist will only be used for this purpose and will not be merged with other data. This serves both your interest and our interest in complying with the legal requirements when sending newsletters (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). Storage in the blacklist is not limited in time. You can object to storage in the blacklist if your interests outweigh our legitimate interest.\n\nBrevo uses the cookie \"__cfruid\". Furthermore, Brevo connects to other services, e.g. to the third-party provider \"Elasticsearch\" (es.io) and to \"Sendinblue\" (sibform.com).\n\n3.4 Surveys\n\nWe use the software \"ReviewPro\" to process your ratings and comments in the context of surveys such as the restaurant survey.\n\nReviewPro is provided by Review Rank, S.A.

If you provide us with your contact details, these may be used to clarify any queries relating to the respective survey.\n\n6 months after the completion of the survey, the data will be deleted.\n\n3.5 Table reservations\n\nWe use the \"Opentable\" service of the provider OpenTable GmbH (Zeil 109, 60313 Frankfurt am Main, Germany). This service allows you to make table reservations for our restaurant.\n\nThe use of Opentable contributes to the facilitation of reservations and optimization of our economic operation. This represents a legitimate interest for us in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.\n\nThe service is not directly embedded on our website, but is a link to the website of Opentable. User information is only transferred to Opentable after the link is activated. Please note that separate data protection regulations apply on the OpenTable site.\n\nFor more information about how we treat user information and the information you provide, please see Opentable's Privacy Policy at https://www.opentable.de/legal/privacy-policy.\n\n4 Cookies\n\n4.1 General Information\n\nCookies are information transmitted by our web server or third-party web servers to the users' devices where they are stored for later retrieval. Cookies can be in the form of small files or any other types of information storage.\n\nIn the case that users do not want that cookies are stored on their device, they will be asked to disable the corresponding option in their browser's system settings. Saved cookies may be deleted in the system settings of the browser.
