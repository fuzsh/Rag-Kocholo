These explorations will have a dual focus. First is the concept of physical separation and literal boundary-making; we will ask what elements make a cohesive inside, against which the outside batters. This brings us to the second focus: the more metaphysical aspects of inside and outside. It will unpick the complex themes of belonging, and aspects of opposition that come from dividing inside from outside, or us from them. We will use this focus to explore the necessity of an inside, exclusive, excluding mental space to form an identity which we may recognise ourselves, and can be recognised by others. This story will look at how a group of people shelter themselves from outside forces, and in doing so, we will delineate a fundamental human urge - to create a place of safety for the body and the mind to rest, and to protect that place from the outside, no matter what.\n\nOleg Stepanov\n\ndance and movement researcher | former dancer with tanztheater pina bausch\n\noleg is a dance artist and choreographer. his first education lies in the field of physics. oleg actively facilitates dance research practices, creates music and cinema. for 7 years, he has been a dancer in tanztheater wuppertal pina bausch. before that, he danced in gothenburg dance company for 3 years. he has collaborated in original creations with choreographers/directors, such as dimitris papaioannou, saburo teshigawara, sidi larbi cherkaoui, alan lucien oyen, richard siegal, bobbi jene smith, constanza macras, uri ivgi & johan greben, and others. oleg's choreographic language and method is based on the observation of the body in space and space in the body. in particular, oleg sees the movement as a synthesis between the architecture and biomechanics of the body and a sensitive, and sensorial, inner journey. in his creative work, it’s important for oleg to assume and envision that the body is endowed with qualities of the subject and the object simultaneously, and that it exists in spacetime among pure potentialities and a multitude of choices.\n\nanother sorts of little deaths\n\nthe creations i facilitate are usually focused on the body and space. at the centre of the creation are human beings, their complexity, and inconsistency. i always try to see and maximise potential of the people that i create with, to bring starting ideas and to set vectors and directions, while still being open to unexpected mutations and turns. my experience shows me that within the time and place in which we create, the relation between people’s involvement and the concept that our bodies constantly reflect world’s events and carry the imprints of history and contemporaneity, will arise something more unique than if i, alone, insisted on my limited perspective. the only place where i'm persistent is in emphasising the polarity and polysemy of things that we explore. i like to play with the ranges, each time trying to look at something in all of its complexity and inconsistency, and directing the viewer towards sensations and curiosity, and internal journey. thus, the piece that we create together is a mosaic, a kind of constantly moving and transforming substance. humor coexists with sadness, illusion with reality, poetry with politics, fullness with emptiness. the creation process is initially based on improvisation and research and moves towards composition and choreography; it includes aspects of theatrical and performance practices. i try to arrange a playful space, without judgment and prejudices; one that's open to failures and numerous attempts to tame what's found.\n\nShannon Gillen\n\nVIM VIGOR\n\nShannon Gillen is the artistic director of VIM VIGOR (US).

My experiences working with Johannes Wieland and, currently, with the artists of VIM VIGOR, has influenced my approach to raw physical movement, the collaborative creative process, and life. Unabashedly personal, each work enters a terrain of human failure, triumph, and will.\n\nperformers\n\njames finnemore // a western\n\nChana Bahar / Joaquin Barral Yarian / Molly Jane Dunne / Lucie Blue Fink / Carsyn Gekas / Jazlyn Goldsworthy / Lara Golladay / Ekko Greenbaum / Hope Keogh / Serra Kösebay / Madi O’halloran / Audrey Rachelle / Eriel Santagado / Romina Paola Simone / Cecilia Wilcox / Cassidy Willox / Katie Lehoty\n\noleg stepanov // another sorts of little deaths (working title)\n\nPaige Ashley / Penny Cooper / West Devaney / Allison Fan / Eliza Flowers / Claire Gaylor / Nicholas Lamaina / Catherine Michalska / Alexi Salazar / Reina Tokutake / Angela Xu / Isabella Wilson\n\nshannon gillen // countdown\n\nEvgeny Bakin / Chloe Chandler / Nils Garrivier / Ámbar Habib / Destinee Jimenez / Katherine kiessling / Pou Seng Leong / Leah Logsdon Carpenter / Céline Maillard / Polina Mankova / Sohyun Park / Alissa Rebagliati / Eilish Shin-Culhane / Caitlin Smith / Carly Vanderheyden / Sadie Wheeless / Megan Mcdevitt"
