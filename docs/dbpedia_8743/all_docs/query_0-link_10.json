If the answer might be \"No\", we are about to change that now :)\n\nContao Camp 2022\n\nBefore we jump to the mighty details of Contao - a very powerful open source CMS that allows you to create professional websites and scalable web applications we want to give you a quick background on how this article came to life.\n\nWe are Christian and Roman - We never met before. Currently we are sitting together at the Contao Camp 2022 in Potsdam (Germany) https://2022.camp.contao.org/.\n\nThe Contao Hackathon has started just now and we joined forces to publish the very first article about Contao here on dev.to. Because one of the great things about Contao is definitely its vivid community and it is worth joining!\n\nBut enough with introduction words, let's get started:\n\nContao - Open Source by heart\n\nContao is open source software licensed under the LGPL-3.0. The license permits the free use of the software ­even for commercial projects. In its core Contao has already everything included to build professional websites and scalable web applications.\n\nIt features:\n\nCore components: News module, form generator & lots of content elements (e.g. text, images, video, slider and many more)\n\nMulti Website Support in one Contao installation\n\nMulti Language Support\n\nDetailed user permission administration\n\nCompatible with Var­nish and oth­er HTTP caches, HTTP2 support, de­ferred im­age re­siz­ing and ESI\n\n2nd factor user authentication (frontend & backend)\n\nGDPR compliance\n\nCon­tao based on Symfony\n\nCon­tao is a Web Content Management System for the administration of websites based on the Sym­fony Full Stack Frame­work. If you have worked with Sym­fony be­fore you will find your way around quick­ly and you are able use the over 11,000 avail­able Sym­fony bun­dles to cus­tomize Con­tao.\n\nThanks to hooks and events, you can ma­nip­u­late the pro­gram flow in var­i­ous places. In­sert tags al­low you to em­bed dy­nam­ic con­tent any­where. And even if you up­date Con­tao, your cus­tomized tem­plates will be pre­served.\n\nTo install and maintain your Contao project and also your Contao symfony bundles you can work directly on the commandline with the composer PHP dependency manager. A more convenient way to maintain Contao is the Contao Manager. It's an easy to use graphical user interface.\n\nThe Contao Community\n\nCon­tao has started as a ger­man-speak­ing pro­ject in 2006. Since then the project evolved a lot and has grown a big com­mu­ni­ty with reg­u­lar events like the Contao Camp we are at now over the course of this weekend. Many re­sources like developer documentation and user manuals are available in english and german of course too.\n\nChristian's view on Contao\n\nI am using Contao as a webdeveloper since 2014. It's flexibility to implement website layouts is one of Contao's super powers! Contao has a very clean source code it makes browsers happy and also search engines. There are many Contao extensions (symfony Contao bundles) which help's me to build websites very fast.\n\nIn my expierence content editors are able to use Contao very fast which makes my job even easier cause I don't have to spent much time on explanations.\n\nWould you try Contao for your next web project? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nContao Links:"
