        "text": "The human AngioTracing Kit incorporates GFP-tagged human endothelial cells from variable tissues that are co-cultured with RFP-tagged human mesenchymal supporting cells in a specially designed medium. The systems will form a network of anastomosing tubules that closely resembles the capillary bed found in vivo after 1-2 weeks.\n\nThe Angiogenesis Tracing Kits are designed to content:\n\n1 vial of pre-mixed and tagged human primary cells (endothelial cells & mesenchymal stem cells)\n\n1 × 14 ml Speed Coating Solution\n\n1 × 500 ml 1 × 500ml of Endo-Growth Medium (ready-to-use)\n\nWe offer the following kits (24 well-format):\n\nPB-cAP-08 In vitro HUVECs Angiogenesis Tracing Kit\n\nPB-cAP-12 In vitro Human Brain Microvascular Angiogenesis Tracing Kit\n\nPB-cAP-13 In vitro Human Pancreatic Microvascular Endothelial Angiogenesis Tracing Kit\n\nPB-cAP-14 In vitro Human Glomerular Microvascular Angiogenesis Tracing Kit\n\nPB-cAP-15 In vitro Human Lymphangiogenesis Tracing Kit\n\nPB-cAP-16 In vitro Human Retina Microvascular Angiogenesis Tracing Kit\n\nApoptosis is an extreme of cell death and is characterized by several biochemical features e.g. cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, chromosome condensation, nuclear fragmentation and DNA laddering.\n\nWe offer different assays to detect induced or ongoing apoptosis via Annexin, Caspase, Cathepsin D or DNA strand breaks (TUNEL).\n\nThe MicroMatrix matrix (ECM) array enables rapid screening of 36 different combinations of extracellular matrix proteins (ECMPs) in a single experiment, requiring only a limited population of cells. Each of the 36 ECM conditions on a MicroMatrix array consists of one to several matrix proteins, spotted onto a thin hydrogel layer. Cells will attach only to the ECM spots with greater cell density and superior morphology being observed in the matrix conditions for which the cells have an affinity. Once identified on the MicroMatrix array the ECM conditions that support your cell's attachment, morphology and other desired outcomes can be further investigated in a chambered slide system or ordered as an optimized solution to coat labware.\n\nThe assays can be used also to investigate the influence of the microenvironment of stem cell differentiation. MicroMatrix 36 Array - PB-MM012011\n\nAbout Colony Forming Cell Assays. Hematopoietic progenitors with lineage-restricted (less primitive) or multi-lineage (more primitive) potential form morphologically distinct colonies when grown in a suitable semi-solid medium containing appropriate growth factors and other supplements. To form the specific colony type that characterizes its potential, a progenitor cell must both proliferate and differentiate within the supportive matrix.\n\nColony-forming cell (CFC) assays therefore have great utility in the identification and enumeration of the different types of functional progenitors in hematopoietic tissues (e.g. bone marrow, cord blood, fetal liver) and manipulated cell populations (e.g. purified, expanded, frozen/thawed, drug treated, etc.).\n\nFor a variety of reasons, methylcellulose has become the matrix of choice for semi-solid media for CFC assays. Pre-screening and qualification of the various components of methylcellulose-based media allow for media products that are highly reproducible in their ability to support vigorous and robust growth of the various types of progenitors.\n\nColonyGEL™ meets the highest standards of methylcellulose-based media for hematopoietic colony-forming cell assays."
