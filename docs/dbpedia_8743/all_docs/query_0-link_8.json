Please correct my mistakes.\n\n\"Replace Language\" replaces the language requested by search engines (over HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE) in a given language.\n\nThe aim is it, for a multilingual website in Contao, to provide the search engine the result of the request in a fixed language. Reason for the development was, that search engine query often with the English language and the German pages (e.g. over \"change language\" links) only with a lower classification have been evaluated.\n\nForum\n\nQuestions about the \"Replace Language\" module will be answered in forum: Forum\n\nErrors and requests can be reported in the Issue Tracker.\n\nInstallation\n\nThe installation of the module occurs about the extension Repository in back end of Contao.\n\nA manual installation is possible. Download the ZIP file from Extension Repository, unzip and transfer it.\n\nA directory should have been created \"/system/modules/replacelanguage\".\n\nThe module Replace Language is dependent on the module \"Bot Detection\". It must therefore be installed with manual installation.\n\nUsing\n\nIn the back end, the module is enabled in \"Settings\", and the language is defined there."
