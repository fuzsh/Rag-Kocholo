ANY HELP (TEXT AND SCREENSHOTS) IS HIGHLY APPRECIATED!\n\nIntroduction\n\nTo join an IRC network chatroom there are various programs for nearly every operating system. The (inofficial) chatroom for the Content Management System Contao is called #contao and can be found on the Freenode network.\n\nThe aim of this chatroom\n\nThe chat provides a possibility to get together with other users and exchange opinions/views/experiences, ask for help or just chit and chat about this and that. However, it is NOT a substitution for reading the manuals or using the search engine on the board !\n\nUseful commands for the IRC/Chat\n\nIf you are a beginner with IRC you better start here and come later back to this section.\n\nHelp\n\nWhenever you need help about a command just type:\n\nServer / Chanels contaowiki\n\nThe Server and chanels where the contaowiki chat hosts are:\n\nHandling about nickname\n\nTo check if your nickname is free type:\n\nIf free you get:\n\nIf free, you can change to your nick with:\n\nIf the change worked you get the message:\n\nYOU are now known as whatever_your_nick_is\n\nIf the Nickname is used you get the Answer:\n\nYou can try later with the specific nick, or you take a other one.\n\nNickname registration\n\nSimilar as in a forum, you can register your User/Nickname. The advantages are:\n\nNickname ist just used from you.\n\nUserspecific settings are possible.\n\nFounder/OP's (On the Top of Userlist, they are like admins in a forum) can give you advanced rights for moderation/administration etc.\n\nYou can register a nickname but it is not necessary!\n\nHow to register\n\nTo register you use:\n\nYou will get a e-mail to the specific e-mail-address with the activation code for your regisration. To activate use:\n\nIf everything is fine, you'll get this from the Server confirmed as:\n\nNow you an identify you with the password as:\n\nNext steps show how to use the IRC-Client Chatzilla with mentioned commands.\n\nFirefox with Chatzilla\n\nThis Howto limits itself to the Firefox add-on Chatzilla. Firefox is a widely known browser and available for the lion's share of all operating systems. If you are an advanced IRC user and join the channel with another software: Please feel free to add your tutorial and share your knowledge with the world!\n\nInstall Chatzilla\n\nFirefox provides a built-in installer for add-ons to enhance itself. Go to https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/16/ and click 'Add to Firefox'. After the installation you need to reboot Firefox.\n\nConfigure Chatzilla\n\nAfter the installation and the reboot of Firefox we need to configure some basic settings to connect to the Freenode network and get the chatroom started.\n\nThe add-ons can be found in the add-on manager (Navigation bar Tools --> Add-ons).\n\nChoose the plugin 'Chatzilla' within the add-on manager and click on 'settings'.\n\nAfter clicking on the tab 'General' you will find the fields 'Description', 'Nickname' and 'Username'. Add your username to both, the Nickname and Username. Description is optional and up to you what you want to write there. Then confirm all the windows.\n\nUse Chatzilla\n\nChatzilla is launched via Tools --> Chatzilla.\n\nChatzilla has saved some IRC networks by default. To connect to a server of the Freenode network, we click on the link 'Freenode' or type the following command in the textfield:\n\n/server irc.freenode.net\n\nNow there is a new tab entitled 'Freenode' and the dial-up starts. The dial-up can take several seconds and is indicated by an orange 'Connecting'.\n\nAs soon as the connection to the server is established, Chatzilla confirms this with a green 'Connected'. The last step is to join the chatroom (also called 'channel'). To join the channel #contao we need to type in the following command and confirm with 'Enter'.\n\n/join #contao\n\nThe chatroom window opens in another tab and is divided as follows:\n\nTab for the room #contao\n\nTextfield: type in text and press 'Enter'\n\nList of all the users in the chatroom\n\nChatroom window: Here you will see all the messages\n\nPlease note!!\n\nIt does not necessarily mean that a user is really in front of the computer, if his or her nickname appears in the nicklist. Maybe they are doing something else in the background, are busy in some other way or even not in front of the computer. Some users also rely on bots (Eggdrop) or bouncers (Bouncer) that remain connected even if the user has turned off the computer.\n\n--Toflar 08:22, 28 May 2010 (UTC)"
