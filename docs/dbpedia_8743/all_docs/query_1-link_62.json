        "text": "Premium editing and proofreading to meet professional requirements\n\nProofreaders and editors are ten a penny, but good and conscientious ones are extremely rare. That’s why we train our staff ourselves. With university degrees and rigorous in-house training under their belts, our team is equipped to deliver highly professional and precise editing and proofreading work.\n\nNeedless to say, we correct spelling and punctuation mistakes and make sure the texts are grammatically correct. But we also check the typography (the length of dashes, the curve of quotation marks and other teeny-tiny details), which gives the printed text its professional look. We make sure that spelling is consistent, check the table of contents and document your corporate language for subsequent jobs. All this according to a precise workflow and our “four eyes” principle, and using helpful IT tools. You need more or less than this? Just give us a call!\n\nDon’t like the style?\n\nMany proofreaders get so engrossed in tweaking the style and tone of a text that they overlook sneaky little typos. We avoid these kinds of costly blunders by conscientiously following our TÜV-approved workflow, which we’ve perfected over the course of 25 years!\n\nDo you want your text to be whipped into shape stylistically? Whatever you ask for in your briefing, we will do!"
