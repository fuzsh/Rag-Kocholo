        "text": "What is your professional background?\n\nMy background is quite diverse, and revolves around the human-animal divide.\n\nI started out studying psychology, but decided to study non-human primates during my masters. Wanting to become a next Jane Goodall I continued with a master in behavioural biology. However, while I was working with primates, I became even more fascinated by how primatology is often more about ourselves and where to draw the line of humanity, as about primates themselves.\n\nSo, I took another turn, to history and philosophy of science, focussing on the role of non-human primates as a model for human nature. The wish to continue with this line of research was in the back of my mind for several years, while I worked on projects concerning ethical and philosophical issues in biological research, and went abroad for a while. Until I got the chance to do a PhD.\n\nWhat is your research about?\n\nFor this project my focus has shifted from primatology to palaeoanthropology. It’s about the changing image of Neanderthals and how this reveals what we apparently consider as ‘us’, and challenges us to reconsider this.\n\nOur image of Neanderthals is changing rapidly, from animal-like brutish creatures they went to being ‘people like us’. But even though they are increasingly regarded as human, a lot of research still tends to focus on differences between ‘us’ and ‘them’, on detecting some decisive difference that confirms our exceptionality.\n\nI am interested in Neanderthals as ‘familiar strangers’, between the ‘clearly us’ on the one side, and the ‘definitely not us’ on the other side. To me Neanderthal research functions as a case study, a vantage point to recognize, and reconsider, the anthropocentric logic of ‘us’ versus ‘other’ at work when it comes to understanding ourselves as human.\n\nNot focusing on where to draw the line, questioning whether or not Neanderthals are ‘really’ human, but why this persistent line-drawing, this quest for a signifying difference, separating us from them.\n\nHow can your research influence our shared understanding of Neanderthals & ourselves?\n\nWe will be unable to understand Neanderthals in terms of their humanity, as long as our conceptualisation of humanity is grounded in the desire to find a defining difference between us and them.\n\nBy reconsidering our self-definition, that depends on the disqualification of those deemed non-human or not fully human, we can recognize Neanderthals as both alike and different at the same time, as independent others, with their own ends and needs, without highlighting every allegedly unique human feature. This would also mean thinking of ourselves as not so isolated and special, but connected and interdependent, allowing us to become open to more inclusive visions of the past, and what it means to be human.\n\nWhy is it important to question our human self-understanding from time to time?\n\nFirst of all, what it is to be considered truly human has, historically, never included the entire human species. Deciding what is human is not a neutral scientific matter and it is important to acknowledge and address the normative assumptions it includes.\n\nFurthermore, in the face of the current global ecological crisis, it is ever more urgent to rethink who we are and our place in nature, as our self-narrative not only aims to explain, but also to justify who we are. As long as the dominant model of humanity in western culture, based on exclusion of the inferior other, remains intact, human-centredness and domination seem inevitable, self-evident and natural.\n\nRethinking our self-narrative will help overcome the attitude of domination which resulted in massive ecological destruction."
