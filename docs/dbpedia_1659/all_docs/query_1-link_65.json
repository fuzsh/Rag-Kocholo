        "text": "Granaries are among the ubiquitous features of a Dogon village. Topped by a mud roof or cap of millet straw, symmetrically shaped granaries are often taller than other structures; interior access is provided by a square wooden door carved with images representing the ownerâs family history. Most villages have several types of granaries. The guy ana (male granary) is a square building used to store millet or sorghum. A Dogon saying is that high granary roofs identify prosperous villages. Used as a shelter by older men, a second type of male granary called a guyo togu has a door at ground level. Men are forbidden from entering a guyo ya (square female granary), used by women to store personal belongings such as clothing and jewelry. Less common are guyo totori (round female granaries), which are reserved for special foods used in cooking, such as beans and baobab leaves. Both male and female granaries are constructed with mud, dung, and straw over a raised platform of rocks that creates a barrier to insects and rodents.\n\nVillages also have numerous flat-roofed, rectangular buildings that serve as living and sleeping quarters for polygamous families that include a man, his wives, and their unmarried children. The most prominent of these houses, called a ginna, serves as home to the senior man within the local lineage. The ginna forms the side of a courtyard with an entrance at one end and a cylindrically shaped kitchen at the other. Smaller homes used by members of the extended family are grouped around the courtyard. Outer walls of Dogon homes are often decorated using geometric designs. Since stone can be difficult to find, mud, cow manure, and millet straw are used as building materials with new layers applied at regular intervals to protect building walls from wind and rain.\n\nThe Dogon are tolerant of diverse religions and belief systems. In the early nineteenth century, Dogon living on the flat scrublands were exposed to Islam by Fulani shepherds; fifty years later, Christianity was introduced with French administration of West Africa. As a result, Dogon villages often have either a church or Sudanese-style mosque (Figure 5). Larger villages may have an intermingling of Christians, Muslims, and animists.\n\nDogon society is socially stratified with farmers occupying high status properties near the center of the village. Over the period of a farmerâs life, his family may occupy a succession of homes as he gains seniority. Blacksmiths, ironworkers, hunters, leather craftsmen, wood carvers, and others from lower castes live on the outskirts of a village (Haardt 1991) (Figure 6). Also on the village periphery are circular-shaped huts called yapunu gina, where women cook and sleep during their menstrual cycles.\n\nSocial harmony is of considerable importance within Dogon culture. The official language is French, but most Dogon donât speak it well because there are few schools and infrequent opportunities for interaction with outsiders. A greeting among Dogon is complex and may take several minutes, beginning with formal questions about the otherâs health (Are you well?) before moving on to queries about family members (Is your wife well? Are your children well?).\n\nWithin Dogon culture, an individualâs status is determined by position within a family group according to rules of descent and age. Dogon lineage is patrilineal, meaning that family members belong to their fatherâs clan and share a common village surname (Figure 7). A man and a woman are not considered married until the birth of their first child. Property in Dogon villages is inherited by the oldest son, who has responsibility for supporting his extended family.\n\nThe basic unit of farmland is the field, often marked using short walls or earthen embankments (Figure 8). Field assignments are based on seniority with the most desirable plots closest to the village reserved for the oldest men. Agricultural production is divided among common fields used to grow subsistence crops such as millet and sorghum, and smaller family fields that include farm plots belonging to single women. Millet is planted after the first rain in June or July, and harvested in October. Other subsistence crops are sorghum, groundnuts (peanuts), calabash, and cassava. Rain falling during wetter months can be intense, leading to the erosion of unprotected soil surfaces. To combat soil loss, the Dogon utilize planting pits and stone lines on flat ground and terraces in sloping areas.\n\nAlong with rain-fed crops, the Dogon grow irrigated vegetables to generate currency needed for the purchase of seed and other supplies. Among the most important are onions, often grown at the top of the plateau using water supplied by small reservoirs. Tobacco grown in riverbeds also serves as a cash crop (Van Beek, 1991b). In some villages, potable water has become increasingly scarce as the water table has dropped, prompting villagers to deepen wells. In addition to water, the Dogon value trees as important resources. For example, the baobabâs fruit pulp and leaves are eaten and its bark used to make rope. Trees located within or adjacent to villages may be âownedâ by individuals or families.\n\nCommunal labor and collective action are important with fields worked by kadaga, groups of ten to twenty similarly aged men (Hollyman 2001). Hard work earns young men respect from elders and may enhance their status among peers. Men do the majority of agricultural work and are responsible for making utensils, and constructing and maintaining buildings. In years with less rainfall, young Dogon men may travel to nearby towns in search of seasonal work. Women are responsible for tasks such as carrying water, pounding millet, making beer, and collecting and cutting firewood (Figure 9). When other tasks have been completed, they may join men in the fields.\n\nReligious Practices and Beliefs\n\nThe Dogon creation myth interprets the universe and explains the structure and rationale for male and female roles, and other aspects of social organization. Villages are believed to be shared by the inneomo (living) and innepuru (dead), who coexist in a symbiotic union. The all-knowing sky god Amma is responsible for maintaining a balance between living and dead worlds. Each village has a shrine containing a small bit of soil to honor Lebe, the earth god who maintains the agricultural cycle and serves as a source of inspiration for the hogon, or spiritual leader (Douny 2011). The role of the hogon falls to the oldest man in a village. The third supernatural entity is Nommo, the water god, often depicted with a human torso attached to a snakelike body.\n\nAlthough they have no written language, the Dogon utilize a system of hieroglyphics to represent all things in the universe (Vergani 1998). Social rules, traditions, and etiquette are passed to subsequent generations through stories, music, dance, and rituals (Douglas 1968). Sacred objects within a village may be communal, or specific to a family unit or individual. For example, small, single-chamber buildings called binu serve as public shrines for maintaining peace with the spiritual world (Gray 2007). An individual or family may also maintain a fetish (personal shrine), sometimes marked with a circle of stones as a warning not to be disturbed. In addition to shrines within villages, the Dogon recognize sacred spaces for ceremonies such as ponds, tunnels, and caves. For example, the village of Sanga is known for its circumcision ceremony, where boys ages nine to fourteen are brought to a sandstone grotto for a three-day event marking their transition to adulthood. A rock ledge forming one side of the grotto is painted with red, black, and white symbols to represent nearby families (Figure 10).\n\nDeath in Dogon society is celebrated by three events, the funeral (called the nyÃ» yana), the dama ceremony, and the sigui. Immediately after death the nyÃ» is held to mourn the deceased. The body is interred either in a cemetery located on flat land or in some cases, within a Tellem cave where it is covered with the bones of ancestors (Douny 2014). The Dogon believe that following a personâs passing their spirit lingers to watch over the living. The purpose of the dama (end of mourning) is to enable the kikinu, or soul, to depart the world of the living (DeMott 1982). Less common is the sigui ceremony, held every sixty-five years to commemorate the replacement of one generation by the next (Van Beek1992).\n\nThe Dama\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can download it and watch it with your favorite video player!\n\nThe highlight of most visits to a Dogon village is an opportunity to see a dama performance. Dama dancers are young men in their late teens or early twenties who have been circumcised, making them eligible to join the awa, or âsociety of masksâ (Maurer 1969). The timing of a dama varies across villages, with many holding a single celebration in April for all deaths that have happened in the last year. Because of the need to carve and paint masks, assemble regalia, and rehearse routines, a dama may require a month or more of preparation time.\n\nThe most impressive element of a dancerâs regalia is the headpiece, or imina (mask), that is tied to the dancerâs face with cloth bands. Sometimes decorated with fibers, cowry shells, or beads, the masks are highly valued by foreign collectors. More than sixty different masks symbolize the worlds of the living and dead; some represent animals or people, and others portray spiritual beings or human attributes such as male or female power (Lane 1988). Masks are said to contain nyama, the life force within both humans and animals (Richards 2006). Because of their association with death, women (who are associated with fertility) may not touch or come in contact with a dancerâs mask (Figure 12). Most dancers wear regalia designed to enhance movements, such as colored hibiscus fibers attached to the wrists and ankles. Decorations may also include breastplates made from shells and beads worn above loose pants. Colors used within regalia represent the four basic elements: red (fire), black (water), white (sky), and yellow or ochre (earth). To maintain the integrity of costumes, materials such as paint, dye, and fiber must be obtained from the bush (Figure 11).\n\nDepending on the village, a dama ceremony may involve a series of private events in advance of public performances. These include impromptu dances, animal sacrifices, and mock gun battles (Davis, 2002). The Dogon believe that wandering souls pose a danger to the living. During early performances, dancers wearing cloth bÃ©dyÃ© (pupil) masks may perform on the rooftop of the deceasedâs home to guide the soul to the final resting place. Events organized during the first part of the dama are limited to members of the awa. Later public performances are open to visitors from other villages and foreigners, often invited to sit in a place of honor near the drummers. Dogon women and children are not invited to these performances, but may view them from a distance (Figure 12).\n\nA performance begins with music provided by the great drum, gourd-drum, armpit drum, and whistle. Made from an elongated wooden board and twisted cord, a string instrument called a bullroarer may also be played. Songs and chants are led by the principal singer, whose words are repeated as a chorus by other musicians. At a prearranged time, a dozen or more dancers emerge, moving in a circle. Subsequently, dancers perform in groups of two or three and then individually following no particular order, except that older men dance before younger ones. Dancers may change masks several times during a performance (Van Beek 1991a).\n\nThe most remarkable elements of public dances are specialized routines performed by solo dancers. Standing more than a meter in height, the kanaga mask is painted black and white with a triangular face and a long, thin nose (Figure 13). Topped by two crosses representing the outstretched wings of a stork, the kanaga depicts connections between the earth and sky (Haardt 1991). Up-stretched arms of the higher cross symbolize the supernatural world, while the lower cross with down-stretched arms represents the world of people. Kanaga dancers frequently move their heads rapidly from side to side in a sweeping motion that allows the top of their mask to touch the ground.\n\nAnother popular dancer is the walu, a mythical antelope represented by a rectangular mask with an elongated, arrow-shaped nose and deep-set eye holes, framed by a rectangular face and topped by horns (Dieterlen 1989) (Figure 14). The Dogon believe that Amma assigned the walu the task of protecting the sun from the fox (Yurugu). The tingetange, or stilt mask, symbolizes a water bird. The ankles of tingetange dancers are bound with cloth to poles, which represent the birdâs long legs.\n\nAmong the particularly remarkable headpieces is the sirige, reserved for the most experienced dancers. The mask itself is formed by a rectangular box, with two vertical openings held in place by a net around the dancerâs head. Extending upward from the box is a flat wooden blade up to five meters in length. To provide additional stability, a portion of the mask is held by the dancerâs teeth and hidden cords are tied to his waist (Vogel 1981). With its huge blade painted with opposing triangles and vertical lines, the sirige mask represents a tree or ginna (Figure 15). The maskâs straight lines are believed to connect the celestial world of the living with the spiritual world. During their routines, sirige dancers may take a few steps and then kneel toward the east.\n\nSome masks are associated with a story pertaining to the character portrayed. For example, the fox represents disorder and disobedience within the world and is considered the enemy of water, fertility, and civilization. A mythical fox named Yurugu is said to have been condemned by Amma to search the world for a lost twin (Griaule 2005). Dancers wearing rabbit masks may hide from the âhunter,â while the walu antelope chases girls and small boys in the audience (Van Beek 1998). In addition to animals and spirits, masks also represent outsiders, often depicting them as aliens who exhibit strange or humorous behavior. Wearing a mask covered by cowry shells, the Fulani woman hops around trying to collect animal dung, while the Mossi herdsman repeatedly falls off his horse (Van Beek 1991a). Also drawing laughter from the crowd, the odyogoro mask has two under-chin bulges representing goiters, a common Dogon ailment caused by a lack of iodine in the diet (Figure 16)."
