        "text": "I Ching\n\nWilhelm Translation, 1950\n\n1. Ch'ien / The Creative\n\nabove CH'IEN THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN\n\nbelow CH'IEN THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN\n\nThe first hexagram is made up of six unbroken lines. These unbroken lines stand for the primal power, which is light-giving, active, strong, and of the spirit. The hexagram is consistently strong in character, and since it is without weakness, its essence is power or energy. Its image is heaven. Its energy is represented as unrestricted by any fixed conditions in space and is therefore conceived of as motion. Time is regarded as the basis of this motion. Thus the hexagram includes also the power of time and the power of persisting in time, that is, duration. The power represented by the hexagram is to be interpreted in a dual sense in terms of its action on the universe and of its action on the world of men. In relation to the universe, the hexagram expresses the strong, creative action of the Deity. In relation to the human world, it denotes the creative action of the holy man or sage, of the ruler or leader of men, who through his power awakens and develops their higher nature.\n\nTHE JUDGMENT\n\nTHE CREATIVE works sublime success, Furthering through perseverance.\n\nAccording to the original meaning, the attributes [sublimity, potentiality of success, power to further, perseverance] are paired. When an individual draws this oracle, it means that success will come to him from the primal depths of the universe and that everything depends upon his seeking his happiness and that of others in one way only, that is, by perseverance in what is right. The specific meanings of the four attributes became the subject of speculation at an early date. The Chinese word here rendered by \"sublime\" means literally \"head,\" \"origin,\" \"great.\" This is why Confucius says in explaining it: \"Great indeed is the generating power of the Creative; all beings owe their beginning to it. This power permeates all heaven.\" For this attribute inheres in the other three as well. The beginning of all things lies still in the beyond in the form of ideas that have yet to become real. But the Creative furthermore has power to lend form to these archetypes of ideas. This is indicated in the word success, and the process is represented by an image from nature: \"The clouds pass and the rain does its work, and all individual beings flow into their forms.\" Applies to the human world, these attributes show the great man the way to notable success: \"Because he sees with great clarity and cause and effects, he completes the six steps at the right time and mounts toward heaven on them at the right time, as though on six dragons.\" The six steps are the six different positions given in the hexagram, which are represented later by the dragon symbol. Here it is shown that the way to success lies in apprehending and giving actuality to the way of the universe [Tao], which, as a law running through end and beginning, brings about all phenomena in time. Thus each step attained forthwith becomes a preparation for the next. Time is no longer a hindrance but the means of making actual what is potential. The act of creation having found expression in the two attributes sublimity and success, the work of conservation is shown to be a continuous actualization and differentiation of form. This is expressed in the two terms \"furthering\" (literally, \"creating that which accords with the nature of a given being\") and \"persevering\" (literally, \"correct and firm\"). \"The course of the Creative alters and shapes beings until each attains its true, specific nature, then it keeps them in conformity with the Great Harmony. Thus does it show itself to further through perseverance.\" In relation to the human sphere, this shows how the great man brings peace and security to the world through his activity in creating order: \"He towers high above the multitude of beings, and all lands are united in peace.\" Another line of speculation goes still further in separating the words \"sublime,\" \"success,\" \"furthering,\" \"perseverance,\" and parallels them with the four cardinal virtues in humanity. To sublimity, which, as the fundamental principle, embraces all the other attributes, it links love. To the attribute success are linked the morals, which regulate and organize expressions of love and thereby make them successful. The attribute furthering is correlated with justice, which creates the conditions in which each receives that which accords with his being, that which is due him and which constitutes his happiness. The attribute perseverance is correlated with wisdom, which discerns the immutable laws of all that happens and can therefore bring about enduring conditions. These speculations, already broached in the commentary called WÃªn Yen , later formed the bridge connecting the philosophy of the \"five stages (elements) of change,\" as laid down in the Book of History (Shu Ching) with the philosophy of the Book of Changes, which is based solely on the polarity of positive and negative principles. In the course of time this combination of the two systems of thought opened the way for an increasingly intricate number symbolism.\n\nTHE IMAGE\n\nThe movement of heaven is full of power.\n\nThus the superior man makes himself strong and\n\nuntiring.\n\nSince there is only one heaven, the doubling of the trigram Ch'ien, of which heaven is the image, indicates the movement of heaven. One complete revolution of heaven makes a day, and the repetition of the trigram means that each day is followed by another. This creates the idea of time. Since it is the same heaven moving with untiring power, there is also created the idea of duration both in and beyond time, a movement that never stops nor slackens, just as one day follows another in an unending course. This duration in time is the image of the power inherent in the Creative. With this image as a model, the sage learns how best to develop himself so that his influence may endure. He must make himself strong in every way, by consciously casting out all that is inferior and degrading. Thus he attains that tirelessness which depends upon consciously limiting the fields of his activity.\n\nTHE LINES\n\nNine at the beginning means:\n\nHidden dragon. Do not act.\n\nIn China the dragon has a meaning altogether different from that given it in the Western world. The dragon is a symbol of the electrically charged, dynamic, arousing force that manifests itself in the thunderstorm. In winter this energy withdraws into the earth; in the early summer it becomes active again, appearing in the sky as thunder and lightning. As a result the creative forces on earth begin to stir again. Here this creative force is still hidden beneath the earth and therefore has no effect. In terms of human affairs, this symbolizes a great man who is still unrecognized. Nonetheless he remains true to himself. He does not allow himself to be influenced by outward success or failure, but confident in his strength, he bides his time. Hence it is wise for the man who consults the oracle and draws this line to wait in the calm strength of patience. The time will fulfill itself. One need not fear least strong will should not prevail; the main thing is not to expend one's powers prematurely in an attempt to obtain by force something for which the time is not yet ripe.\n\nNine in the second place means:\n\nDragon appearing in the field.\n\nIt furthers one to see the great man.\n\nHere the effects of the light-giving power begin to manifest themselves. In terms of human affairs, this means that the great man makes his appearance in his chosen field of activity. As yet he has no commanding position but is still with his peers. However, what distinguishes him form the others is his seriousness of purpose, his unqualified reliability, and the influence he exerts on his environment with out conscious effort. Such a man is destined to gain great influence and to set the world in order. Therefore it is favorable to see him.\n\nNine in the third place means:\n\nAll day long the superior man is creatively active.\n\nAt nightfall his mind is still beset with cares.\n\nDanger. No blame.\n\nA sphere of influence opens up for the great man. His fame begins to spread. The masses flock to him. His inner power is adequate to the increased outer activity. There are all sorts of things to be done, and when others are at rest in the evening, plans and anxieties press in upon him. But danger lurks here at the place of transition from lowliness to the heights. Many a great man has been ruined because the masses flocked to him and swept him into their course. Ambition has destroyed his integrity. However, true greatness is not impaired by temptations. He who remains in touch with the time that is dawning, and with its demands is prudent enough to avoid all pitfalls, and remains blameless.\n\nNine in the fourth place means:\n\nWavering flight over the depths.\n\nNo blame.\n\nA place of transition has been reached, and free choice can enter in. A twofold possibility is presented to the great man: he can soar to the heights and play an important part in the world, or he can withdraw into solitude and develop himself. He can go the way of the hero or that of the holy sage who seeks seclusion. There is no general law of his being. If the individual acts consistently and is true to himself, he will find the way that is appropriate for him. This way is right for him and without blame.\n\nNine in the fifth place means:\n\nFlying dragon in the heavens.\n\nIt furthers one to see the great man.\n\nHere the great man has attained the sphere of the heavenly beings. His influence spreads and becomes visible throughout the whole world. Everyone who sees him may count himself blessed. Confucius says about this line:\n\nThings that accord in tone vibrate together. Things that have affinity in their inmost natures seek one another. Water flows to what is wet, fire turns to what is dry. Clouds (the breath of heaven) follow the dragon, wind (the breath of earth) follows the tiger. Thus the sage arises, and all creatures follow him with their eyes. What is born of heaven feels related to what is above. What is born of earth feels related to what is below. Each follows its kind.\n\nNine at the top means:\n\nArrogant dragon will have cause to repent.\n\nWhen a man seeks to climb so high that he loses touch with the rest of mankind, he becomes isolated, and this necessarily leads to failure. This line warns against titanic aspirations that exceed one's power. A precipitous fall would follow.\n\nWhen all the lines are nines, it means:\n\nThere appears a flight of dragons without heads.\n\nGood fortune.\n\nWhen all the lines are nines, it means that the whole hexagram is in motion and changes into the hexagram K'un, THE RECEPTIVE, whose character is devotion. The strength of the Creative and the mildness of the Receptive unite. Strength is indicated by the flight of dragons, mildness by the fact that their heads are hidden. This means that mildness in action joined to strength of decision brings good fortune.\n\nindex\n\n2. K'un / The Receptive\n\nabove K'UN THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH\n\nbelow K'UN THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH\n\nThis hexagram is made up of broken lines only. The broken lines represents the dark, yielding, receptive primal power of yin. The attribute of the hexagram is devotion; its image is the earth. It is the perfect complement of THE CREATIVE--the complement, not the opposite, for the Receptive does not combat the Creative but completes it . It represents nature in contrast to spirit, earth in contrast to heaven, space as against time, the female-maternal as against the male-paternal. However, as applied to human affairs, the principle of this complementary relationship is found not only in the relation between man and woman, but also in that between prince and minister and between father and son. Indeed, even in the individual this duality appears in the coexistence of the spiritual world and the world of the senses. But strictly speaking there is no real dualism here, because there is a clearly defined hierarchic relationship between the two principles. In itself of course the Receptive is just as important as the Creative, but the attribute of devotion defines the place occupied by this primal power in relation to the Creative. For the Receptive must be activated and led by the Creative; then it is productive of good. Only when it abandons this position and tries to stand as an equal side by side with the Creative, does it become evil. The result then is opposition to and struggle against the Creative, which is productive of evil to both.\n\nTHE JUDGMENT\n\nTHE RECEPTIVE brings about sublime success,\n\nFurthering through the perseverance of a mare.\n\nIf the superior man undertakes something and tries to lead,\n\nHe goes astray;\n\nBut if he follows, he finds guidance.\n\nIt is favorable to find friends in the west and south,\n\nTo forego friends in the east and north.\n\nQuiet perseverance brings good fortune.\n\nThe four fundamental aspects of the Creative--\"sublime success, furthering through perseverance\"--are also attributed to the Receptive. Here, however, the perseverance is more closely defined: it is that of a mare. The Receptive connotes spatial reality in contrast to the spiritual potentiality of the Creative. The potential becomes real and the spiritual becomes spatial through a specifically qualifying definition. Thus the qualification, \"of a mare,\" is here added to the idea of perseverance. The horse belongs to earth just as the dragon belongs to heaven. Its tireless roaming over the plains is taken as a symbol of the vast expanse of the earth. This is the symbol chosen because the mare combines the strength and swiftness of the horse with the gentleness and devotion of the cow. Only because nature in its myriad forms corresponds with the myriad impulses of the Creative can it make these impulses real. Nature's richness lies in its power to nourish all living things; its greatness lies in its power to give then beauty and splendor. Thus it prospers all that lives. IT is the Creative that begets things, but they are brought to birth by the Receptive. Applied to human affairs, therefore, what the hexagram indicated is action in conformity with the situation. The person in questions not in an independent position, but is acting as an assistant. This means that he must achieve something. It is not his task to try to lead--that would only make him lose the way-but to let himself be led. If he knows how to meet fate with an attitude of acceptance, he is sure to find the right guidance. The superior man lets himself be guided; he does not go ahead blindly, but learns from the situation what is demanded of him and then follows this intimation from fate. Since there is something to be accomplished, we need friends and helpers in the hour of toil and effort, once the ideas to be realized are firmly set. The time of toil and effort is indicated by the west and south, for west and south symbolize the place where the Receptive works for the Creative, as nature does in summer and autumn. If in that situation one does not mobilize all one's powers, the work to be accomplished will not be done. Hence to find friends there means to find guidance. But in addition to the time of toil and effort, there is also a time of planning, and for this we need this solitude. The east symbolized the place where a man receives orders from his master, and the north the place where he reports on what he has done. At that time he must be alone and objective. In this sacred hour he must do without companions. So that the purity of the moment may not be spoiled by fictional hates and favoritism.\n\nTHE IMAGE\n\nThe earth's condition is receptive devotion.\n\nThus the superior man who has breadth of character\n\nCarries the outer world.\n\nJust as there is only one heaven, so too there is only one earth. In the hexagram of heaven the doubling of the trigram implies duration in time, but in the hexagram of earth the doubling connotes the solidity and extension in space by virtue of which the earth is able to carry and preserve all things that live and move upon it. The earth in its devotion carries all things, good and evil,, without exception. In the same way the superior man gives to his character breadth, purity, and sustaining power, so that he is able both to support and to bear with people and things.\n\nTHE LINES\n\nSix at the beginning means:\n\nWhen there is hoarfrost underfoot,\n\nSolid ice is not far off.\n\nJust as the light-giving power represents life, so the dark power, the shadowy, represents death. When the first hoarfrost comes in the autumn, the power of darkness and cold is just at its beginning. After these first warnings, signs of death will gradually multiply, until, in obedience to immutable laws, stark winter with its ice is here. In life it is the same. After certain scarcely noticeable signs of decay have appeared, they go on increasing until final dissolution comes. But in life precautions can be taken by heeding the first signs of decay and checking them in time.\n\nSix in the second place means:\n\nStraight, square, great.\n\nWithout purpose,\n\nYet nothing remains unfurthered.\n\nThe symbol of heaven is the circle, and that of earth is the square. Thus squareness is a primary quality of the earth. On the other hand, movement in a straight line, as well as magnitude, is a primary quality of the Creative. But all square things have their origin in a straight line and into turn form solid bodies. In mathematics, when we discriminate between lines, planes and solids, we find that rectangular planes result from straight lines, and cubic magnitudes from rectangular planes. The Receptive accommodates itself to the qualities of the Creative and makes them its own. Thus a square develops out of a straight line and a cube out of a square. This is compliance with the laws of the Creative; nothing is taken away, nothing added. Therefore the Receptive has no need of a special purpose of its own, nor of any effort' yet everything turns out as it should. Nature creates all beings without erring: this is its foursquareness. It tolerates all creatures equally: this is its greatness. Therefore it attains what is right for all without artifice or special intentions. Man achieves the height of wisdom when all that he does is as self-evident as what nature does.\n\nSix in the third place means:\n\nHidden lines.\n\nOne is able to remain persevering.\n\nIf by chance you are in the service of a king,\n\nSeek not works, but bring to completion.\n\nIf a man is free of vanity he is able to conceal his abilities and keep them from attracting attention too soon; thus he can mature undisturbed. If conditions demand it, he can also enter public life, but that too he does with restraint. The wise man gladly leaves fame to others. He does not seek to have credited to himself things that stand accomplished, but hopes to release active forces; that is, he completes his works in such a manner that they may bear fruit for the future.\n\nSix in the fourth place means:\n\nA tied-up sack. No blame, no praise.\n\nThe dark element opens when it moves and closes when at rest. The strictest reticence is indicated here. The time is dangerous , because any degree of prominence leads either to the enmity of irresistible antagonists if one challenges them or to misconceived recognition if one is complaisant. Therefore a man ought to maintain reserve, be it in solitude or in the turmoil of the world, for there too he can hide himself so well that no one knows him.\n\nSix in the fifth place means:\n\nA yellow lower garment brings supreme good fortune.\n\nYellow is the color of the earth and of the middle; it is the symbol of that which is reliable and genuine. The lower garment is inconspicuously decorated--the symbol of aristocratic reserve. When anyone is called upon to work in a prominent but not independent position, true success depends on the utmost discretion. A man's genuineness and refinement should not reveal themselves directly; they should express themselves only indirectly as an effect from within.\n\nSix at the top means:\n\nDragons fight in the meadow.\n\nTheir blood is black and yellow.\n\nIn the top place the dark element should yield to the light. If it attempts to maintain a position to which it is not entitled and to rule instead of serving, it draws down upon itself the anger of the strong. A struggle ensues in which it is overthrown, with injury, however, to both sides. The dragon, symbol of heaven, comes to fight the false dragon that symbolized the inflation of the earth principle. Midnight blue is the color of heaven; yellow is the color of earth. Therefore, when black and yellow blood flow, it is a sign that in this unnatural contest both primal powers suffer injury.\n\nWhen all the lines are sixes, it means:\n\nLasting perseverance furthers.\n\nWhen nothing but sixes appears, the hexagram of THE RECEPTIVE changes into the hexagram of THE CREATIVE. By holding fast to what is right, it gains the power of enduring. There is indeed no advance, but neither is there retrogression.\n\nindex\n\n3. Chun / Difficulty at the Beginning\n\nabove K'AN THE ABYSMAL, WATER\n\nbelow CHÃªN THE AROUSING, THUNDER\n\nThe name of the hexagram, Chun, really connotes a blade of grass pushing against an obstacle as it sprouts out of the earth--hence the meaning, \"difficulty at the beginning.\" The hexagram indicates the way in which heaven and earth bring forth individual beings. It is their first meeting, which is beset with difficulties. The lower trigram ChÃªn is the Arousing; its motion is upward and its image is thunder. The upper trigram K'an stands for the Abysmal, the dangerous. Its motion is downward and its image is rain. The situation points to teeming, chaotic profusion; thunder and rain fill the air. But the chaos clears up. While the Abysmal sinks, the upward movement eventually passes beyond the danger. A thunderstorm brings release from tension, and all things breathe freely again.\n\nTHE JUDGMENT\n\nDIFFICULTY AT THE BEGINNING works supreme success,\n\nFurthering through perseverance.\n\nNothing should be undertaken.\n\nIt furthers one to appoint helpers.\n\nTimes of growth are beset with difficulties. They resemble a first birth. But these difficulties arise from the very profusion of all that is struggling to attain form . Everything is in motion: therefore if one perseveres there is a prospect of great success, in spite of the existing danger. When it is a man's fate to undertake such new beginnings, everything is still unformed, dark. Hence he must hold back, because any premature move might bring disaster. Likewise, it is very important not to remain alone; in order to overcome the chaos he needs helpers. This is not to say, however, that he himself should look on passively at what is happening. He must lend his hand and participate with inspiration and guidance.\n\nTHE IMAGE\n\nClouds and thunder:\n\nThe image of DIFFICULTY AT THE BEGINNING.\n\nThus the superior man\n\nBrings order out of confusion.\n\nClouds and thunder are represented by definite decorative lines; this means that in the chaos of difficulty at the beginning, order is already implicit. So too the superior man has to arrange and organize the inchoate profusion of such times of beginning, just as one sorts out silk threads from a knotted tangle and binds them into skeins. In order to find one's place in the infinity of being, one must be able both to separate and to unite.\n\nTHE LINES\n\nNine at the beginning means:\n\nHesitation and hindrance.\n\nIt furthers one to remain persevering.\n\nIt furthers one to appoint helpers.\n\nIf a person encounters a hindrance at the beginning of an enterprise, he must not try to force advance but must pause and take thought. However, nothing should put him off his course; he must persevere and constantly keep the goal in sight. It is important to seek out the right assistants, but he can find them only if he avoids arrogance and associated with his fellows in a spirit of humility. Only then will he attract those with whose help he can combat the difficulties.\n\nSix in the second place means:\n\nDifficulties pile up.\n\nHorse and wagon part.\n\nHe is not a robber;\n\nHe wants to woo when the time comes.\n\nThe maiden is chaste,\n\nShe does not pledge herself.\n\nTen years--then she pledges herself.\n\nWe find ourselves beset by difficulties and hindrances. Suddenly there is a turn of affairs, as if someone were coming up with a horse and wagon and unhitching them. This event comes so unexpectedly that we assume the newcomer to be a robber. Gradually it becomes clear that he has no evil intentions but seeks to be friendly and to offer help. But this offer is not to be accepted, because it does not come from the right quarter. We must wait until the time is fulfilled; ten years is a fulfilled cycle of time. Then normal conditions return of themselves, and we can join forces with the friend intended for us. Using the image of a betrothed girl who remains true to her lover in face of grave conflicts, the hexagram gives counsel for a special situation. When in times of difficulty a hindrance is encountered and unexpected relief is offered from a source unrelated to us, we must be careful and not take upon ourselves any obligations entailed by such help; otherwise our freedom of decision is impaired. If we bide our time, things will quiet down again, and we shall attain what we have hoped for.\n\nSix in the third place means:\n\nWhoever hunts deer without the forester\n\nOnly loses his way in the forest.\n\nThe superior man understands the signs of the time\n\nAnd prefers to desist.\n\nTo go on brings humiliation.\n\nIf a man tries to hunt in a strange forest and has no guide, he loses his way. When he finds himself in difficulties he must not try to steal out of them unthinkingly and without guidance. Fate cannot be duped; premature effort, without the necessary guidance, ends in failure and disgrace. Therefore the superior man, discerning the seeds of coming events, prefers to renounce a wish rather than to provoke failure and humiliation by trying to force its fulfillment.\n\nSix in the fourth place means:\n\nHorse and wagon part.\n\nStrive for union.\n\nTo go brings good fortune.\n\nEverything acts to further.\n\nWe are in a situation in which it is our duty to act, but we lack sufficient power. However, an opportunity to make connections offers itself. It must be seized. Neither false pride nor false reserve should deter us. Bringing oneself to take the first step, even when it involves a certain degree of self-abnegation, is a sign of inner clarity. To accept help in a difficult situation is not a disgrace. If the right helper is found, all goes well.\n\nNine in the fifth place means:\n\nDifficulties in blessing.\n\nA little perseverance brings good fortune.\n\nGreat perseverance brings misfortune.\n\nAn individual is in a position in which he cannot so express his good intentions that they will actually take shape and be understood. Other people interpose and distort everything he does. He should then be cautious and proceed step by step. He must not try to force the consummation of a great undertaking, because success is possible only when general confidence already prevails. It is only through faithful and conscientious work, unobtrusively carried on, that the situation gradually clears up and the hindrance disappears.\n\nSix at the top means:\n\nHorse and wagon part.\n\nBloody tears flow.\n\nThe difficulties at the beginning are too great for some persons. They get stuck and never find their way out; they fold their hands and give up the struggle. Such resignation is the saddest of all things. Therefore Confucius says of this line: \"Bloody tears flow: one should not persist in this.\"\n\nindex\n\n4. MÃªng / Youthful Folly\n\nabove KÃªN KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN\n\nbelow K'AN THE ABYSMAL, WATER\n\nIn this hexagram we are reminded of youth and folly in two different ways. The image of the upper trigram, KÃªn, is the mountain, that of the lower, K'an, is water; the spring rising at the foot of the mountain is the image of inexperienced youth. Keeping still is the attribute of the upper trigram; that of the lower is the abyss, danger. Stopping in perplexity on the brink of a dangerous abyss is a symbol of the folly of youth. However, the two trigrams also show the way of overcoming the follies of youth. Water is something that of necessity flows on. When the spring gushes forth, it does not know at first where it will go. But its steady flow fills up the deep place blocking its progress, and success is attained.\n\nTHE JUDGMENT\n\nYOUTHFUL FOLLY has success.\n\nIt is not I who seek the young fool;\n\nThe young fool seeks me.\n\nAt the first oracle I inform him.\n\nIf he asks two or three times, it is importunity.\n\nIf he importunes, I give him no information.\n\nPerseverance furthers.\n\nIn the time of youth, folly is not an evil. One may succeed in spite of it, provided one finds an experienced teacher and has the right attitude toward him. This means, first of all, that the youth himself must be conscious of his lack of experience and must seek out the teacher. Without this modesty and this interest there is no guarantee that he has the necessary receptivity, which should express itself in respectful acceptance of the teacher. This is the reason why the teacher must wait to be sought out instead of offering himself. Only thus can the instruction take place at the right time and in the right way. A teacher's answer to the question of a pupil ought to be clear and definite like that expected from an oracle; thereupon it ought to be accepted as a key for resolution of doubts and a basis for decision. If mistrustful or unintelligent questioning is kept up, it serves only to annoy the teacher. He does well to ignore it in silence, just as the oracle gives one answer only and refuses to be tempted by questions implying doubt. Given addition a perseverance that never slackens until the points are mastered one by one, real success is sure to follow. Thus the hexagram counsels the teacher as well as the pupil.\n\nTHE IMAGE\n\nA spring wells up at the foot of the mountain:\n\nThe image of YOUTH.\n\nThus the superior man fosters his character\n\nBy thoroughness in all that he does.\n\nA spring succeeds in flowing on and escapes stagnation by filling up all the hollow places in its path. In the same way character is developed by thoroughness that skips nothing but, like water, gradually and steadily fills up all gaps and so flows onward.\n\nTHE LINES\n\nSix at the beginning means:\n\nTo make a fool develop\n\nIt furthers one to apply discipline.\n\nThe fetters should be removed.\n\nTo go on in this way bring humiliation.\n\nLaw is the beginning of education. Youth in its inexperience is inclined at first to take everything carelessly and playfully. It must be shown the seriousness of life. A certain measure of taking oneself in hand, brought about by strict discipline, is a good thing. He who plays with life never amounts to anything. However, discipline should not degenerate into drill. Continuous drill has a humiliating effect and cripples a man's powers.\n\nNine in the second place means:\n\nTo bear with fools in kindliness brings good fortune.\n\nTo know how to take women\n\nBrings good fortune.\n\nThe son is capable of taking charge of the household.\n\nThese lines picture a man who has no external power, but who has enough strength of mind to bear his burden of responsibility. He has the inner superiority and that enable him to tolerate with kindliness the shortcomings of human folly. The same attitude is owed to women as the weaker sex. One must understand them and give them recognition in a spirit of chivalrous consideration. Only this combination of inner strength with outer reserve enables one to take on the responsibility of directing a larger social body with real success.\n\nSix in the third place means:\n\nTake not a maiden who. When she sees a man of bronze,\n\nLoses possession of herself.\n\nNothing furthers.\n\nA weak, inexperienced man, struggling to rise, easily loses his own individuality when he slavishly imitates a strong personality of higher station. He is like a girl throwing herself away when she meets a strong man. Such a servile approach should not be encouraged, because it is bad both for the youth and the teacher. A girl owes it to her dignity to wait until she is wooed. In both cases it is undignified to offer oneself, and no good comes of accepting such an offer.\n\nSix in the fourth place means:\n\nEntangled folly bring humiliation.\n\nFor youthful folly it is the most hopeless thing to entangle itself in empty imaginings. The more obstinately it clings to such unreal fantasies, the more certainly will humiliation overtake it. Often the teacher, when confronted with such entangled folly, has no other course but to leave the fool to himself for a time, not sparing him the humiliation that results. This is frequently the only means of rescue.\n\nSix in the fifth place means:\n\nChildlike folly brings good fortune.\n\nAn inexperienced person who seeks instruction in a childlike and unassuming way is on the right path, for the man devoid of arrogance who subordinated himself to his teacher will certainly be helped.\n\nNine at the top means:\n\nIn punishing folly\n\nIt does not further one\n\nTo commit transgressions.\n\nThe only thing that furthers\n\nIs to prevent transgressions.\n\nSometimes an incorrigible fool must be punished. He who will not heed will be made to feel. This punishment is quite different from a preliminary shaking up. But the penalty should not be imposed in anger; it must be restricted to an objective guarding against unjustified excesses. Punishment is never an end in itself but serves merely to restore order. This applies not only in regard to education but also in regard to the measures taken by a government against a populace guilty of transgressions. Governmental interference should always be merely preventive and should have as its sole aim the establishment of public security and peace.\n\nindex\n\n5. HsÃ¼ / Waiting (Nourishment)\n\nabove K'AN THE ABYSMAL, WATER\n\nbelow CH'IEN THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN\n\nAll beings have need of nourishment from above. But the gift of food comes in its own time, and for this one must wait. This hexagram shows the clouds in the heavens, giving rain to refresh all that grows and to provide mankind with food and drink. The rain will come in its own time. We cannot make it come; we have to wait for it. The idea of waiting is further suggested by the attributes of the two trigrams--strength within, danger in from. Strength in the face of danger does not plunge ahead but bides its time, whereas weakness in the face of danger grows agitated and has not the patience to wait.\n\nTHE JUDGMENT\n\nWAITING. If you are sincere,\n\nYou have light and success.\n\nPerseverance brings good fortune.\n\nIt furthers one to cross the great water.\n\nWaiting is not mere empty hoping. It has the inner certainty of reaching the goal. Such certainty alone gives that light which leads to success. This leads to the perseverance that brings good fortune and bestows power to cross the great water. One is faced with a danger that has to be overcome. Weakness and impatience can do nothing. Only a strong man can stand up to his fate, for his inner security enables him to endure to the end. This strength shows itself in uncompromising truthfulness [with himself]. It is only when we have the courage to face things exactly as they are, without any sort of self-deception or illusion, that a light will develop out of events, by which the path to success may be recognized. This recognition must be followed by resolute and persevering action. For only the man who goes to meet his fate resolutely is equipped to deal with it adequately. Then he will be able to cross the great water--that is to say, he will be capable of making the necessary decision and of surmounting the danger.\n\nTHE IMAGE\n\nClouds rise up to heaven:\n\nThe image of WAITING.\n\nThus the superior man eats and drinks,\n\nIs joyous and of good cheer.\n\nWhen clouds rise in the sky, it is a sign that it will rain. There is nothing to do but to wait until after the rain falls. It is the same in life when destiny is at work. We should not worry and seek to shape the future by interfering in things before the time is ripe. We should quietly fortify the body with food and drink and the mind with gladness and good cheer. Fate comes when it will, and thus we are ready.\n\nTHE LINES\n\nNine at the beginning means:\n\nWaiting in the meadow.\n\nIT furthers one to abide in what endures.\n\nNo blame.\n\nThe danger is not yet close. One is still waiting on the open plain. Conditions are still simple, yet there is a feeling of something impending. One must continue to lead a regular life as long as possible. Only in this way does one guard against a premature waste of strength, keep free of blame and error that would become a source of weakness later on.\n\nNine in the second place means:\n\nWaiting on the sand.\n\nThere is some gossip.\n\nThe end brings good fortune.\n\nThe danger gradually comes closer. Sand is near the bank of the river, and the water means danger. Disagreements crop up. General unrest can easily develop in such times, and we lay the blame on one another. He who stays calm will succeed in making things go well in the end. Slander will be silenced if we do not gratify it with injured retorts.\n\nNine in the third place means:\n\nWaiting in the mud\n\nBrings about the arrival of the enemy.\n\nMud is no place for waiting, since it is already being washed by the water of the stream. Instead of having gathered strength to cross the stream at one try, one has made a premature start that has got him no farther than the muddy bank. Such an unfavorable position invites enemies from without, who naturally take advantage of it. Caution and a sense of the seriousness of the situation are all that can keep one from injury.\n\nSix in the fourth place means:\n\nWaiting in blood.\n\nGet out of the pit.\n\nThe situation is extremely dangerous. IT is of utmost gravity now--a matter of life and death. Bloodshed seems imminent. There is no going forward or backward; we are cut off as if in a pit. Now we must simply stand fast and let fate take its course. This composure, which keeps us from aggravating the trouble by anything we might do, is the only way of getting out of the dangerous pit.\n\nNine in the fifth place means:\n\nWaiting at meat and drink.\n\nPerseverance brings good fortune.\n\nEven in the midst of danger there come intervals of peace when things go relatively well. If we possess enough inner strength, we shall take advantage of these intervals to fortify ourselves for renewed struggle. We must know how to enjoy the moment without being deflected from the goal, for perseverance is needed to remain victorious. This is true in public life as well; it is not possible to achieve everything all at once. The height of wisdom is to allow people enough recreation to quicken pleasure in their work until the task is completed. Herein lies the secret of the whole hexagram. It differs from Chin OBSTRUCTION\n\n39, in the fact that in this instance, while waiting, we are sure of our cause and therefore do not lose the serenity born of inner cheerfulness.\n\nSix at the top means:\n\nOne falls into the pit.\n\nThree uninvited guests arrive.\n\nHonor them, and in the end there will be good fortune.\n\nThe waiting is over; the danger can no longer be averted. One falls into the pit and must yield to the inevitable. Everything seems to have been in vain. But precisely in this extremity things take an unforeseen turn. Without a move on one's own part, there is outside intervention. At first one cannot be sure of its meaning: is it rescue or is it destruction? A person in this situation must keep his mind alert and not withdraw into himself with a sulky gesture of refusal, but must greet the new turn with respect. Thus he ultimately escapes the danger, and all goes well. Even happy turns of fortune often come in a form that at first seems strange to us.\n\nindex\n\n6. Sung / Conflict\n\nabove CH'IEN THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN\n\nbelow K'AN THE ABYSMAL, WATER\n\nThe upper trigram, whose image is heaven, has an upward movement; the lower trigram, water, in accordance with its nature tends downward. Thus the two halves move away from each other, giving rise to the idea of conflict. The attribute of the Creative is strength, that of the Abysmal is danger, guile. Where cunning has force before it, there is conflict. A third indication of conflict, in terms of character, is presented by the combination of deep cunning within and fixed determination outwardly. A person of this character will certainly be quarrelsome.\n\nTHE JUDGMENT\n\nCONFLICT. You are sincere\n\nAnd are being obstructed.\n\nA cautious halt halfway brings good fortune.\n\nGoing through to the end brings misfortune.\n\nIt furthers one to see the great man.\n\nIt does not further one to cross the great water.\n\nConflict develops when one feels himself to be in the right and runs into opposition. If one is not convinced of being in the right, opposition leads to craftiness or high-handed encroachment but not to open conflict. If a man is entangled in a conflict, his only salvation lies in being so clear-headed and inwardly strong that he is always ready to come to terms by meeting the opponent halfway. To carry one the conflict to the bitter end has evil effects even when one is the right, because the enmity is then perpetuated. It is important to see the great man, that is, an impartial man whose authority is great enough to terminate the conflict amicably or assure a just decision. In times of strife, crossing the great water is to be avoided, that is, dangerous enterprises are not to be begun, because in order to be successful they require concerted unity of focus. Conflict within weakens the power to conquer danger without.\n\nTHE IMAGE\n\nHeaven and water go their opposite ways:\n\nThe image of CONFLICT.\n\nThus in all his transactions the superior man\n\nCarefully considers the beginning.\n\nThe image indicates that the causes of conflict are latent in the opposing tendencies of the two trig rams. Once these opposing tendencies appear, conflict is inevitable. To avoid it, therefore, everything must be taken carefully into consideration in the very beginning. If rights and duties are exactly defined, or if, in a group, the spiritual trends of the individuals harmonize, the cause of conflict is removed in advance.\n\nTHE LINES\n\nSix at the beginning means:\n\nIf one does not perpetuate the affair,\n\nThere is a little gossip.\n\nIn the end, good fortune comes.\n\nWhile a conflict is in the incipient stage, the best thing To do is to drop the issue. Especially when the adversary is stronger, it is not advisable to risk pushing the conflict to a decision. It may come to a slight dispute, but in the end all goes well.\n\nNine in the second place means:\n\nOne cannot engage in conflict;\n\nOne returns home, gives way.\n\nThe people of his town,\n\nThree hundred households,\n\nRemain free of guilt.\n\nIn a struggle with an enemy of superior strength, retreat is no disgrace. Timely withdrawal prevents bad consequences. If, out of a false sense of honor, a man allowed himself to be tempted into an unequal conflict, he would be drawing down disaster upon himself. In such a case a wise and conciliatory attitude benefits the whole community, which will then not be drawn into the conflict.\n\nSix in the third place means:\n\nTo nourish oneself on ancient virtue induces perseverance.\n\nDanger. In the end, good fortune comes.\n\nIf by chance you are in the service of a king,\n\nSeek not works.\n\nThis is a warning of the danger that goes with an expansive disposition. Only that which has been honestly acquired through merit remains a permanent possession. It can happen that such a possession may be contested, but since it is really one's own, one cannot be robbed of it. Whatever a man possesses through the strength of his own nature cannot be lost. If one enters the service of a superior, one can avoid conflict only by not seeking works for the sake of prestige. It is enough if the work is done: let the honor go to the other.\n\nNine in the fourth place means:\n\nOne cannot engage in conflict.\n\nOne turns back and submits to fate,\n\nChanges one's attitude,\n\nAnd finds peace in perseverance.\n\nGood fortune.\n\nThis refers to a person whose inner attitude at first lacks peace. He does not feel content with his situation and would like to improve it through conflict. In contrast tot the situation of the nine in the second place, he is dealing with a weaker opponent and might therefore succeed. But he cannot carry on the fight, because, since right is not on his side, he cannot justify the conflict to his conscience. Therefore he turns back and accepts his fate. He changes his mind and finds lasting peace in being at one with eternal law. This brings good fortune.\n\nNine in the fifth place means:\n\nTo contend before him\n\nBrings supreme good fortune.\n\nThis refers to an arbiter in a conflict who is powerful and just, and strong enough to lend weight to the right side. A dispute can be turned over to him with confidence. If one is in the right, one attains great good fortune.\n\nNine at the top means:\n\nEven if by chance a leather belt is bestowed on one,'\n\nBy the end of a morning\n\nIt will have been snatched away three times.\n\nHere we have someone who has carried a conflict to the bitter end and has triumphed. He is granted a decoration, but his happiness does not last. He is attacked again and again, and the result is conflict without end.\n\nindex\n\n7. Shih / The Army\n\nabove K'UN THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH\n\nbelow K'AN THE ABYSMAL, WATER\n\nThis hexagram is made up of the trigrams K'an, water, and K'un, earth, and thus it symbolizes the ground water stored up in the earth. In the same way military strength is stored up in the mass of the people--invisible in times of peace but always ready for use as a source of power. The attributes of the two trig rams are danger inside and obedience must prevail outside. Of the individual lines, the one that controls the hexagram is the strong nine in the second place, to which the other lines, all yielding, are subordinate. This line indicates a commander, because it stands in the middle of one of the two trigrams. But since it is in the lower rather than the upper trigram, it represents not the ruler but the efficient general, who maintains obedience in the army by his authority.\n\nTHE JUDGMENT\n\nTHE ARMY. The army needs perseverance\n\nAnd a strong man.\n\nGood fortune without blame.\n\nAn army is a mass that needs organization in order to become a fighting force.\n\nWithout strict discipline nothing can be accomplished, but this discipline must not be achieved by force. It requires a strong man who captures the hearts of the people and awakens their enthusiasm. In order that he may develop his abilities he needs the complete confidence of his ruler, who must entrust him with full responsibility as long as the war lasts. But war is always a dangerous thing and brings with it destruction and devastation. Therefore it should not be resorted to rashly but, like a poisonous drug, should be used as a last recourse.\n\nTHE IMAGE\n\nIn the middle of the earth is water:\n\nThe image of THE ARMY.\n\nThus the superior man increases his masses\n\nBy generosity toward the people.\n\nGround water is invisibly present within the earth. In the same way the military power of a people is invisibly present in the masses. When danger threatens, every peasant becomes present in the masses. When danger threatens, every peasant becomes a soldier; when the war ends, he goes back to his plow. He who is generous toward the people wins their love, and a people living under a mild rule becomes strong and powerful. Only a people economically strong can be important in military power. Such power must therefore be cultivated by improving the economic condition of the people and by humane government. Only when there is this invisible bond between government and people, so that the people are sheltered by their government as ground water is sheltered by the earth, is it possible to wage a victorious war.\n\nTHE LINES\n\nSix at the beginning means:\n\nAn army must set forth in proper order.\n\nIf the order is not good, misfortune threatens.\n\nAt the beginning of a military enterprise, order is imperative. A just and valid cause must exist, and the obedience and coordination of the troops must be well organized, otherwise the result is inevitably failure.\n\nNine in the second place means:\n\nIn the midst of the army.\n\nGood fortune. No blame.\n\nThe king bestows a triple decoration.\n\nThe leader should be in the midst of his army, in touch with it, sharing good and bad with the masses he leads. This alone makes him equal to the heavy demands made upon him. He needs also the recognition of the ruler. The decorations he receives are justified, because there is no question of personal preferment here: the whole army, whose center he is, is honored in his person.\n\nSix in the third place means:\n\nPerchance the army carries corpses in the wagon.\n\nMisfortune.\n\nHere we have a choice of two explanations. One points to defeat because someone other than the chosen leader interferes with the command; the other is similar in its general meaning, but the expression, \"carries corpses in the wagon,\" is interpreted differently. At burials and at sacrifices to the dead it was customary in China for the deceased to whom the sacrifice was made to be represented by a boy of the family, who sat in the dead man's place and was honored as his representative. On the basis of this custom the text is interpreted as meaning that a \"corpse boy\" is sitting in the wagon, or, in other words, that authority is not being exercised by the proper leaders but has been usurped by others. Perhaps the whole difficulty clears up if it is inferred that there has been an error in copying. The character fan, meaning \"all,\" may have been misread as shih, which means \"corpse.\" Allowing for this error, the meaning would be that if the multitude assumes leadership of the army (rides in the wagon), misfortune will ensue.\n\nSix in the fourth place means:\n\nThe army retreats. No blame.\n\nIn the face of a superior enemy, with whom it would be hopeless to engage in battle, an orderly retreat is the only correct procedure, because it will save the army from defeat and disintegration. It is by no means a sign of courage or strength to insist upon engaging in a hopeless struggle regardless of circumstances.\n\nSix in the fifth place means:\n\nThere is game in the field.\n\nIt furthers one to catch it.\n\nWithout blame.\n\nLet the eldest lead the army.\n\nThe younger transports corpses;\n\nThen perseverance brings misfortune.\n\nGame is in the field--it has left its usual haunts in the forest and is devastating the fields. This points to an enemy invasion. Energetic combat and punishment are here thoroughly justified, but they must not degenerate into a wild melee in which everyone fends for himself. Despite the greatest degree of perseverance and bravery, this would lead to misfortune. The army must be directed by an experienced leader. It is a matter of waging war, not of permitting the mob to slaughter all who fall into their hands; if they do, defeat will be the result, and despite all perseverance there is danger of misfortune.\n\nSix at the top means:\n\nThe great prince issues commands,\n\nFounds states, vests families with fiefs.\n\nInferior people should not be employed.\n\nThe war has ended successfully, victory is won, and the king divided estates and fiefs among his faithful vassals. But it is important that inferior people should not come into power. If they have helped, let them be paid off with money, but they should not be awarded lands or the privileges of rulers, lest power be abused.\n\nindex\n\n8. Pi / Holding Together [union]\n\nabove K'AN THE ABYSMAL, WATER\n\nbelow K'UN THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH\n\nThe waters on the surface of the earth flow together wherever they can, as for example in the ocean, where all the rivers come together. Symbolically this connotes holding together and the laws that regulate it. The same idea is suggested by the fact that all the lines of the hexagram except the fifth, the place of the ruler, are yielding. The yielding lines hold together because they are influenced by a man of strong will in the leading position, a man who is their center of union. Moreover, this strong and guiding personality in turn holds together with the others, finding in them the complement of his own nature.\n\nTHE JUDGMENT\n\nHOLDING TOGETHER brings good fortune.\n\nInquire of the oracle once again\n\nWhether you possess sublimity, constancy, and perseverance;\n\nThen there is no blame.\n\nThose who are uncertain gradually join.\n\nWhoever come too late\n\nMeets with misfortune.\n\nWhat is required is that we unite with others, in order that all may complement and aid one another through holding together. But such holding together calls for a central figure around whom other persons may unite. To become a center of influence holding people together is a grave matter and fraught with great responsibility. It requires greatness of spirit, consistency, and strength. Therefore let him who wishes to gather others about him ask himself whether he is equal to the undertaking, for anyone attempting the task without a real calling for it only makes confusion worse than if no union at all had taken place. But when there is a real rallying point, those who at first are hesitant or uncertain gradually come in of their own accord. Late-comers must suffer the consequences, for in holding together the question of the right time is also important. Relationships are formed and firmly established according to definite inner laws. Common experiences strengthen these ties, and he who comes too late to share in these basic experiences must suffer for it if, as a straggler, he finds the door locked. If a man has recognized the necessity for union and does not feel strong enough to function as the center, it is his duty to become a member of some other organic fellowship.\n\nTHE IMAGE\n\nOn the earth is water:\n\nThe image of HOLDING TOGETHER.\n\nThus the kings of antiquity\n\nBestowed the different states as fiefs\n\nAnd cultivated friendly relations\n\nWith the feudal lords.\n\nWater fills up all the empty places on the earth and clings fast to it. The social organization of ancient China was based on this principle of the holding together of dependents and rulers. Water flows to unite with water, because all parts of it are subject to the same laws. So too should human society hold together through a community of interests that allows each individual to feel himself a member of a whole. The central power of a social organization must see to it that every member finds that his true interest lies in holding together with it, as was the case in the paternal relationship between king and vassals in ancient China.\n\nTHE LINES\n\nSix at the beginning means:\n\nHold to him in truth and loyalty;\n\nThis is without blame.\n\nTruth, like a full earthen bowl\"\n\nThus in the end\n\nGood fortune comes from without.\n\nFundamental sincerity is the only proper basis for forming relationships. This attitude, symbolized by a full earthen bowl, in which the content is everything and the empty form nothing, shows itself not in clever words but through the strength of what lies within the speaker. This strength is so great that it has power to attract good fortune to itself from without.\n\nSix in the second place means:\n\nHold to him inwardly.\n\nPerseverance brings good fortune.\n\nIf a person responds perseveringly and in the right way to the behests from above that summon him to action, his relations with others are intrinsic and he does not lose himself. But if a man seeks association with others as if he were an obsequious office hunter, he throws himself away. He does not follow the path of the superior man, who never loses his dignity.\n\nSix in the third place means:\n\nYou hold together with the wrong people.\n\nWe are often among people who do not belong to our own sphere. In that case we must beware of being drawn into false intimacy through force of habit. Needless to say, this would have evil consequences. Maintaining sociability without intimacy is the only right attitude toward people, because otherwise we should not be free to enter into relationship with people of our own kind later on.\n\nSix in the fourth place means:\n\nHold to him outwardly also.\n\nPerseverance brings good fortune.\n\nHere the relations with a man who is the center of union are well established. Then we may, and indeed we should, show our attachment openly. But we must remain constant and not allow ourselves to be led astray.\n\nNine in the fifth place means:\n\nManifestation of holding together.\n\nIn the hunt the king uses beaters on three sides only\n\nAnd forgoes game that runs off in front.\n\nThe citizens need no warning.\n\nGood fortune.\n\nIn the royal hunts of ancient China it was customary to drive up the game from three sides, but on the fourth the animals had a chance to run off. If they failed to do this they had to pass through a gate behind which the king stood ready to shoot. Only animals that entered here were shot; those that ran off in front were permitted to escape. This custom accorded with a kingly attitude; the royal hunter did not wish to turn the chase into a slaughter, but held that the kill should consist only of those animals which had so to speak voluntarily exposed themselves. There is depicted here a ruler, or influential man, to whom people are attracted. Those who come to him he accepts, those who do not come are allowed to go their own way. He invited none, flatters none--all come of their own free will. In this way there develops a voluntary dependence among those who hold him. They do not have to be constantly on their guard but may express their opinions openly. Police measures are not necessary, and they cleave to their ruler of their own volition. The same principle of freedom is valid for life in general. We should not woo favor from people. If a man cultivates within himself the purity and the strength that are necessary for one who is the center of a fellowship, those who are meant for him come of their own accord.\n\nSix at the top means:\n\nHe finds no head for holding together.\n\nMisfortune.\n\nThe head is the beginning. If the beginning is not right, there is no hope of a right ending. If we have missed the right moment for union and go on hesitating to give complete and full devotion, we shall regret the error when it is too late.\n\nindex\n\n9. Hsiao Ch'u / The Taming Power of the Small\n\nabove SUN THE GENTLE, WIND\n\nbelow CH'IEN THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN\n\nThis hexagram means the force of the small--the power of the shadowy--that restrains, tames, impedes. A weak line in the fourth place, that of the minister, holds the five strong lines in check. In the Image it is the wind blowing across the sky. The wind restrains the clouds, the rising breath of the Creative, and makes them grow dense, but as yet is not strong enough to turn them to rain. The hexagram presents a configuration of circumstances in which a strong element is temporarily held in leash by a weak element. It is only through gentleness that this can have a successful outcome.\n\nTHE JUDGMENT\n\nTHE TAMING POWER OF THE SMALL\n\nHas success.\n\nDense clouds, no rain from our western region.\n\nThis image refers to the state of affairs in China at the time when King WÃªn, who came originally from the west, was in the east at the court of the reigning tyrant Chou Hsin. The moment for action on a large scale had not yet arrived. King WÃªn could only keep the tyrant somewhat in check by friendly persuasion. Hence the image of many clouds, promising moisture and blessing to the land, although as yet no rain falls. The situation is not unfavorable; there is a prospect of ultimate success, but there are still obstacles in the way, and we can merely take preparatory measures. Only through the small means of friendly persuasion can we exert any influence. The time has not yet come for sweeping measures. However, we may be able, to a limited extent, to act as a restraining and subduing influence. To carry out our purpose we need firm determination within and gentleness and adaptability in external relations.\n\nTHE IMAGE\n\nThe wind drives across heaven:\n\nThe image of THE TAMING POWER OF THE SMALL.Thus the superior man\n\nRefines the outward aspect of his nature.\n\nThe wind can indeed drive the clouds together in the sky; yet, being nothing but air, without solid body, it does not produce great or lasting effects. So also an individual, in times when he can produce no great effect in the outer world, can do nothing except refine the expression of his nature in small ways.\n\nTHE LINES\n\nNine at the beginning means:\n\nReturn to the way.\n\nHow could there be blame in this?\n\nGood fortune.\n\nIt lies in the nature of a strong man to press forward. In so doing he encounters obstructions. Therefore he returns to the way suited to his situation, where he is free to advance or to retreat. In the nature of things this will bring good fortune, for it is wise and reasonable not to try to obtain anything by force.\n\nNine in the second place means:\n\nHe allows himself to be drawn into returning.\n\nGood fortune.\n\nOne would like to press forward, but before going farther one sees from the example of others like oneself that this way is blocked. In such a case, if the effort to push forward is not in harmony with the time, a reasonable and resolute man will not expose himself to a personal rebuff, but will retreat with others of like mind. This brings good fortune, because he does not needlessly jeopardize himself.\n\nNine in the third place means:\n\nThe spokes burst out of the wagon wheels.\n\nMan and wife roll their eyes.\n\nHere an attempt is made to press forward forcibly, in the consciousness that the obstructing power is slight. But since, under the circumstances, power actually lies with the weak, this sudden offensive is doomed to failure. External conditions hinder the advance, just as loss of the wheel spokes stops the progress of a wagon. We do not yet heed this hint form fate, hence there are annoying arguments like those of a married couple. Naturally this is not a favorable state of thing, for though the situation may enable the weaker side to hold its ground, the difficulties are too numerous to permit of a happy result. In consequence even the strong man cannot so use his power as to exert the right influence on those around him. He experiences a rebuff where he expected an easy victory, and he thus compromises his dignity.\n\nSix in the fourth place means:\n\nIf you are sincere, blood vanishes and fear gives way.\n\nNo blame.\n\nIf one is in the difficult and responsible position of counselor to a powerful man, on should restrain him in such a way that the threat of actual bloodshed may arise. Nonetheless, the power of disinterested truth is greater than all theses obstacles. It carries such weight that the end is achieved, and all danger of bloodshed and all fear disappear.\n\nNine in the fifth place means:\n\nIf you are sincere and loyally attached,\n\nYou are rich in your neighbor.\n\nLoyalty leads to firm ties because it means that each partner complements the other. In the weaker person loyalty consists in devotion, in the stronger it consists in trustworthiness. This relation of mutual reinforcement leads to a true wealth that is all the more apparent because it is not selfishly hoarded but is shared with friends. Pleasure shared is pleasure doubled.\n\nNine at the top means:\n\nThe rain comes, there is rest.\n\nThis is due to the lasting effect of character.\n\nPerseverance brings the woman into danger.\n\nThe moon is nearly full.\n\nIf the superior man persists,\n\nMisfortune comes.\n\nSuccess is at hand. The wind has driven up the rain. A fixed standpoint has been reach. This has come about through the cumulation of small effects produced by reverence for a superior character. But a success thus secured bit by bit calls for great caution. It would be a dangerous illusion for anyone to think he could presume upon it. The female principle, the weak element that has won the victory, should never persist in vaunting it--that would lead to danger. The dark power in the moon is strongest when the moon is almost full. When it is full and directly opposite the sun, its waning is inevitable. Under such circumstances one must be content with what has been achieved. To advance any further, before the appropriate time has come, would lead to misfortune.\n\nindex\n\n10. LÃ¼ / Treading [conduct]\n\nabove CH'IEN THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN\n\nbelow TUI THE JOYOUS, LAKE\n\nThe name of the hexagram means on the one hand the right way of conducting oneself. Heaven, the father, is above, and the lake, the youngest daughter, is below. This shows the difference between high and low, upon which composure correct social conduct, depends. On the other hand the word for the name of the hexagram, TREADING, means literally treading upon something. The small and cheerful [Tui] treads upon the large and strong [Ch'ien]. The direction of movement of the two primary trigrams is upward. The fact that the strong treads on the weak is not mentioned in the Book of Changes, because it is taken for granted. For the weak to take a stand against the strong is not dangerous here, because it happened in good humor [Tui] and without presumption, so that the strong man is not irritated but takes it all in good part.\n\nTHE JUDGMENT\n\nTREADING. Treading upon the tail of the tiger.\n\nIt does not bite the man. Success.\n\nThe situation is really difficult. That which is strongest and that which is weakest are close together. The weak follows behind the strong and worries it. The strong, however, acquiesces and does not hurt the weak, because the contact is in goof humor and harmless. In terms of a human situation, one is handling wild, intractable people. In such a case one's purpose will be achieved if one behaves with decorum. Pleasant manners succeed even with irritable people.\n\nTHE IMAGE\n\nHeaven above, the lake below:\n\nThe image of TREADING.\n\nThus the superior man discriminates between high and low,\n\nAnd thereby fortifies the thinking of the people.\n\nHeaven and the lake show a difference of elevation that inheres in the natures of the two, hence no envy arises. Among mankind also there are necessarily differences of elevation; it is impossible to bring about universal equality. But it is important that differences in social rank should not be arbitrary and unjust, for if this occurs, envy and class struggle are the inevitable consequences. If, on the other hand, external differences in rank correspond with differences in inner worth, and if inner worth forms the criterion of external rank, people acquiesce and order reigns in society.\n\nTHE LINES\n\nNine at the beginning means:\n\nSimple conduct. Progress without blame.\n\nThe situation is one in which we are still not bound by any obligations of social intercourse. If our conduct is simple, we remain free of them We can quietly follow our predilections as long as we are content and make not demands on people. The meaning of the hexagram is not standstill but progress. A man finds himself in an altogether inferior position at the start. However, he has the inner strength that guarantees progress. If he can be content with simplicity, he can make progress without blame. When a man is dissatisfied with modest circumstances, he is restless and ambitious and tries to advance, not for the sake of accomplishing anything worth while, but merely in order to escape from lowliness and poverty by dint of his conduct. Once his purpose is achieved, he is certain to become arrogant and luxury-loving. Therefore blame attaches to his progress. On the other hand, a man who is good at his work is content to behave simply. He wishes to make progress in order to accomplish something. When he attains his goal, he does something worth while, an all is well.\n\nNine in the second place means:\n\nTreading a smooth, level course.\n\nThe perseverance of a dark man\n\nBrings good fortune.\n\nThe situation of a lonely sage is indicated here. He remains withdrawn from the bustle of life, seeks nothing, asks nothing of anyone, and travels through life unassailed, on a level road. Since he is content and does not challenge fate, he remains free of entanglements.\n\nSix in the third place means:\n\nA one-eyed man is able to see,\n\nA lame man is able to tread.\n\nHe treads on the tail of the tiger.\n\nThe tiger bites the man.\n\nMisfortune.\n\nThus does a warrior act on behalf of his great prince.\n\nA one-eyed man can indeed see, but not enough for clear vision. A lame man can indeed treat, but not enough to make progress. If in spite of such defects a man considers himself strong and consequently exposes himself to danger, he is inviting disaster, for he is undertaking something beyond his strength. This reckless way of plunging ahead, regardless of the adequacy of one's powers, can be justified only in the case of a warrior battling for his prince.\n\nNine in the fourth place means:\n\nHe treads on the tail of the tiger.\n\nCaution and circumspection\n\nLead ultimately to good fortune.\n\nThis text refers to a dangerous enterprise. The inner power to carry it through is there, but this inner power is combined with hesitating caution in one's external attitude. This line contrasts with the preceding line, which is weak within but outwardly presses forward. Here one is sure of ultimate success, which consists in achieving one's purpose, that is, in overcoming danger by going forward.\n\nNine in the fifth place means:\n\nResolute conduct.\n\nPerseverance with awareness of danger.\n\nThis refers to the ruler of the hexagram as a whole. One sees that one has to be resolute in conduct. But at the same time one must remain conscious of the danger connected with such resoluteness, especially if it is to be persevered in. Only awareness of the danger makes success possible.\n\nNine at the top means:\n\nLook to your conduct and weigh the favorable signs.\n\nWhen everything is fulfilled, supreme good fortune comes.\n\nThe work is ended. If we want to know whether good fortune will follow, we must look back upon our conduct and its consequences. If the effects are good, then good fortune is certain. No one knows himself. It is only by the consequences of his actions, by the fruit of his labors, that a man can judge what he is to expect.\n\nindex\n\n11. T'ai / Peace\n\nabove K'UN THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH\n\nbelow CH'IEN THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN\n\nThe Receptive, which moves downward, stands above; the Creative, which moves upward, is below. Hence their influences meet and are in harmony, so that all living things bloom and prosper. This hexagram belongs to the first month (February-March), at which time the forces of nature prepare the new spring.\n\nTHE JUDGMENT\n\nPEACE. The small departs,\n\nThe great approaches.\n\nGood fortune. Success.\n\nThis hexagram denotes a time in nature when heaven seems to be on earth. Heaven has placed itself beneath the earth, and so their powers unite in deep harmony. Then peace and blessing descend upon all living things. In the world of man it is a time of social harmony; those in high places show favor to the lowly, and the lowly and inferior is an end to all feuds. In side, at the center, in the key position, is the light principle; the dark principle is outside. Thus the light has a powerful influence, while the dark is submissive. In this way each receives its due. When the good elements of society occupy a central position and are in control, the evil elements come under their influence and change for the better. When the spirit of heaven rules in man, his animal nature also comes under its influence and takes its appropriate place. The individual lines enter the hexagram from below and leave it again at the top. Here the small, weak, and evil elements are about to take their departure, while the great, strong, and good elements are moving up. This brings good fortune and success.\n\nTHE IMAGE\n\nHeaven and earth unite: the image of PEACE.\n\nThus the ruler\n\nDivides and completes the course of heaven and earth,\n\nAnd so aids the people.\n\nHeaven and earth are in contact and combine their influences, producing a time of universal flowering and prosperity. This stream of energy must be regulated by the ruler of men. It is done by a process of division. Thus men divide the uniform flow of time into the seasons, according to the succession of natural phenomena, and mark off infinite space by the points of the compass. In this way nature in its overwhelming profusion of phenomena is bounded and controlled. One the other hand, nature must be furthered in her productiveness. This is done by adjusting the products to the right time and the right place, which increases the natural yield. This controlling and furthering activity of man in his relation to nature is the work on nature that rewards him.\n\nTHE LINES\n\nNine at the beginning means:\n\nWhen ribbon grass is pulled up, the sod comes with it.\n\nEach according to his kind.\n\nUndertakings bring good fortune.\n\nIn times of prosperity every able man called to fill an office draws like minded people along with him, just as in pulling up ribbon grass one always pulls up a bunch of it, because the stalks are connected by their roots. In such times, when it is possible to extend influence widely, the mind of an able man is set upon going out into life and accomplishing something.\n\nNine in the second place means:\n\nBearing with the uncultured in gentleness,\n\nFording the river with resolution,\n\nNot neglecting what is distant,\n\nNot regarding one's companions:\n\nThus one may manage to walk in the middle.\n\nIn times of prosperity it is important and above all to possess enough greatness of soul to bear with imperfect people. For in the hands of a great master no material is unproductive; he can find use for everything. But this generosity is by no means laxity or weakness. It is during times of prosperity especially that we must always be ready to risk even dangerous undertakings, such as the crossing of a river, if they are necessary. So too we must not neglect what is distant but must attend scrupulously to everything. Factionalism and the dominance of cliques are especially to be avoided. Even if people of like mind come forward together, they ought not to form a faction by holding together for mutual advantage; instead, each man should do is duty. Theses are four ways in which one can overcome the hidden danger of a gradual slackening that always lurks in any time of peace. And that is how one finds the middle way for action.\n\nNine in the third place means:\n\nNo plain not followed by a slope.\n\nNo going not followed by a return.\n\nHe who remains persevering in danger\n\nIs without blame.\n\nDo not complain about this truth;\n\nEnjoy the good fortune you still possess.\n\nEverything on earth is subject to change. Prosperity is followed by decline: this is the eternal law on earth. Evil can indeed be held in check but not permanently abolished. It always returns. This conviction might induct melancholy, but it should not; it ought only to keep us from falling into illusion when good fortune comes to us. If we continue mindful of the danger, we remain persevering and make no mistakes. As long as a man's inner nature remains stronger and richer than anything offered by external fortune, as long as he remains inwardly superior to fate, fortune will not desert him.\n\nSix in the fourth place means:\n\nHe flutters down, not boasting of his wealth,\n\nTogether with his neighbor,\n\nGuileless and sincere.\n\nIn times of mutual confidence, people of high rank come in close contact with the lowly quite simply and without boasting of their wealth. This is not due to the force of circumstances but corresponds with their inmost sentiment. The approach is made quite spontaneously, because it is based on inner conviction.\n\nSix in the fifth place means:\n\nThe sovereign I\n\nGives his daughter in marriage.\n\nAnd supreme good fortune.\n\nThe sovereign I is T'ang the Completer. By his decree the imperial princesses, although higher in rank than their husbands, had to obey them like all other wives. Here too we are shown a truly modest union of high and low that brings happiness and blessings.\n\nSix at the top means:\n\nThe wall falls back into the moat.\n\nUse no army now.\n\nMake your commands known within your own town.\n\nPerseverance brings humiliation.\n\nThe change alluded to in the middle of the hexagram has begun to take place. The wall of the town sinks back into the moat from which it was dug. The hour of doom is at hand. When matters have come to this pass, we should submit to fate and not try to stave it off by violent resistance. The one recourse left us is to hold our own within our intimate circle. Should we persevere in trying to resist the evil in the usual way, our collapse would only be more complete, and humiliation would be the result.\n\nindex\n\n12. P'i / Standstill [Stagnation]\n\nabove CH'IEN THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN\n\nbelow K'UN THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH\n\nThis hexagram is the opposite of the preceding one. Heaven is above, drawing farther and farther away, while the earth below sinks farther into the depths. The creative powers are not in relation. It is a time of standstill and decline. This hexagram is linked with the seventh month (August-September), when the year has passed its zenith and autumnal decay is setting in.\n\nTHE JUDGMENT\n\nSTANDSTILL. Evil people do not further\n\nThe perseverance of the superior man.\n\nThe great departs; the small approaches.\n\nHeaven and earth are out of communion and all things are benumbed. What is above has no relation to what is below, and on earth confusion and disorder prevail. The dark power is within, the light power is without. Weakness is within, harshness without. Within are the inferior, and without are the superior. The way of inferior people is in ascent; the way of superior people is one the decline. But the superior people do not allow themselves to be turned from their principles. If the possibility of exerting influence is closed to them, they nevertheless remain faithful to their principles and withdraw into seclusion.\n\nTHE IMAGE\n\nHeaven and earth do not unite:\n\nThe image of STANDSTILL.\n\nThus the superior man falls back upon his inner worth\n\nIn order to escape the difficulties.\n\nHe does not permit himself to be honored with revenue.\n\nWhen, owing to the influence of inferior men, mutual mistrust prevails in public life, fruitful activity is rendered impossible, because the fundaments are wrong. Therefore the superior man knows what he must do under such circumstances; he does not allow himself to be tempted by dazzling offers to take part in public activities. This would only expose him to danger, since he cannot assent to the meanness of the others. He therefore hides his worth and withdraws into seclusion.\n\nTHE LINES\n\nSix at the beginning means:\n\nWhen ribbon grass is pulled up, the sod comes with it.\n\nEach according to his kind.\n\nPerseverance brings good fortune and success.\n\nThe text is almost the same as that of the first line of the preceding hexagram, but with a contrary meaning. In the latter a man is drawing another along with him on the road to an official career; here a man is drawing another with him into retirement form public life. This is why the text says here, \"Perseverance brings good fortune and success,\" and not \"Undertakings bring good fortune.\" If it becomes impossible to make our influence count, it is only by retirement that we spare ourselves humiliation. Success in a higher sense can be ours, because we know how to safeguard the value of our personalities.\n\nSix in the second place means:\n\nThey bear and endure;\n\nThis means good fortune for inferior people.\n\nThe standstill serves to help the great man to attain success.\n\nInferior people are ready to flatter their superiors in a servile way. They would also endure the superior man if he would put an end to their confusion. This is fortunate for them. But the great man calmly bears the consequences of the standstill. He does not mingle with the crowd of the inferior; that is not his place. By his willingness to suffer personally he insures the success of his fundamental principles.\n\nSix in the third place means:\n\nThey bear shame.\n\nInferior people who have risen to power illegitimately do not feel equal to the responsibility they have taken upon themselves. In their hearts they begin to be ashamed, although at first they do not show it outwardly. This marks a turn for the better.\n\nNine in the fourth place means:\n\nHe who acts at the command of the highest\n\nRemains without blame.\n\nThose of like mind partake of the blessing.\n\nThe time of standstill is nearing the point of change into its opposite. Whoever wishes to restore order must feel himself called to the task and have the necessary authority. A man who sets himself up a capable of creating order according to his own judgment could make mistakes and end in failure. But the man who is truly called to the task is favored by the conditions of the time, and all those of like mind will share in his blessing.\n\nNine in the fifth place means:\n\nStandstill is giving way.\n\nGood fortune for the great man.\n\n\"What if it should fail, what if it should fail?\"\n\nIn this way he ties it to a cluster of mulberry shoots.\n\nThe time undergoes a change. The right man, able to restore order, has arrived. Hence \"good fortune.\" But such periods of transition are the very times in which we must fear and tremble. Success is assured only through greatest caution, which asks always, \"What if it should fail?\" When a mulberry bush is cut down, a number of unusually strong shoots sprout from the roots. Hence the image of tying something to a cluster of mulberry shoots is used to symbolize the way of making success certain. Confucius says about this line:\n\nDanger arises when a man feels secure in his position. Destruction threatens when a man seeks to preserve his worldly estate. Confusion develops when a man has put everything in order. Therefore the superior man does not forget danger in his security, not ruin when he is well established, nor confusion when his affairs are in order. In this way he gains personal safety and is able to protect the empire.\n\nNine at the top means:\n\nThe standstill comes to an end.\n\nFirst standstill, then good fortune.\n\nThe standstill does not last forever. However, it does not cease of its own accord; the right man is needed to end it. This is the difference between a state of peace and a state of stagnation. Continuous effort is necessary to maintain peace: left to itself it would change into stagnation and disintegration. The time of disintegration, however, does not change back automatically to a condition of peace and prosperity; effort must be put forth in order to end it. This shows the creative attitude that man must take if the world is to be put in order.\n\nindex\n\n13. T'ung JÃªn / Fellowship with Men\n\nabove CH'IEN THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN\n\nbelow LI THE CLINGING, FLAME\n\nThe image of the upper trigram Ch'ien is heaven, and that of the lower, Li, is flame. It is the nature of fire to flame up to the heaven. This gives the idea of fellowship. IT is the second line that, by virtue of its central character, unites the five strong lines around it. This hexagram forms a complement to Shih, THE ARMY\n\n7. In the latter, danger is within and obedience without--the character of a warlike army, which, in order to hold together, needs one strong man among the many who are weak. Here, clarity is within and strength without--the character of a peaceful union of men, which, in order to hold together, needs one yielding nature among many firm persons.\n\nTHE JUDGMENT\n\nFELLOWSHIP WITH MEN in the open.\n\nSuccess.\n\nIt furthers one to cross the great water.\n\nThe perseverance of the superior man furthers.\n\nTrue fellowship among men must be based upon a concern that is universal. It is not the private interests of the individual that create lasting fellowship among men, but rather the goals of humanity. That is why it is said that fellowship with men in the open succeeds. If unity of this kind prevails, even difficult and dangerous tasks, such as crossing the great water, can be accomplished. But in order to bring about this sort of fellowship, a persevering and enlightened leader is needed--a man with clear, convincing, and inspiring aims and the strength to carry them out. (The inner trigram means clarity; the outer, strength.)\n\nTHE IMAGE\n\nHeaven together with fire:\n\nThe image of FELLOWSHIP WITH MEN.\n\nThus the superior man organizes the clans\n\nAnd makes distinctions between things.\n\nHeaven has the same direction of movement as fire, yet it is different from fire. Just as the luminaries in the sky serve for the systematic division and arrangement of time, so human society and all things that really belong together must be organically arranged. Fellowship should not be a mere mingling of individuals or of things--that would be chaos, not fellowship. If fellowship is to lead to order, there must be organization within diversity.\n\nTHE LINES\n\nNine at the beginning means:\n\nFellowship with men at the gate.\n\nNo blame.\n\nThe beginning of union among people should take place before the door. All are equally close to one another. No divergent aims have yet arisen, and one makes not mistakes. The basic principles of any kind of union must be equally accessible to all concerned. Secret agreements bring misfortune.\n\nSix in the second place means:\n\nFellowship with men in the clan.\n\nHumiliation.\n\nThere is danger here of formation of a separate faction on the basis of personal and egotistic interests. Such factions, which are exclusive and, instead of welcoming all men, must condemn one group in order to unite the others, originate from low motives and therefore lead in the course of time to humiliation.\n\nNine in the third place means:\n\nHe hides weapons in the thicket;\n\nHe climbs the high hill in front of it.\n\nFor three years he does not rise up.\n\nHere fellowship has changed about to mistrust. Each man distrusts the other, plans a secret ambush, and seeks to spy on his fellow form afar. We are dealing with an obstinate opponent whom we cannot come at by this method. Obstacles standing in the way of fellowship with others are shown here. One has mental reservations for one's own part and seeks to take his opponent by surprise. This very fact makes one mistrustful, suspecting the same wiles in his opponent and trying to ferret them out. The result is that one departs further and further from true fellowship. The longer this goes on, the more alienated one becomes.\n\nNine in the fourth place means:\n\nHe climbs up on his wall; he cannot attack.\n\nGood fortune.\n\nHere the reconciliation that follows quarrel mover nearer. It is true that there are still dividing walls on which we stand confronting one another. But the difficulties are too great. We get into straits, and this brings us to our senses. We cannot fight, and therein lies our good fortune.\n\nNine in the fifth place means:\n\nMen bound in fellowship first weep and lament,\n\nBut afterward they laugh.\n\nAfter great struggles they succeed in meeting.\n\nTwo people are outwardly separated, but in their hearts they are united. They are kept apart by their positions in life. Many difficulties and obstructions arise between them and cause them grief. But, remaining true to each other, the allow nothing to separate them, and although it costs them a severe struggle to overcome the obstacles, they will succeed. When they come together their sadness will change to joy. Confucius says of this:\n\nLife leads the thoughtful man on a path of many windings.Now the course is checked, now it runs straight again.Here winged thoughts may pour freely forth in words,There the heavy burden of knowledge must be shut away in silence.But when two people are at one in the inmost hearts,They shatter even the strength of iron or of bronze.And when two people understand each other in their inmost hearts,Their words are sweet and strong, like the fragrance of orchids.\n\nNine at the top means:\n\nFellowship with men in the meadow.\n\nNo remorse.\n\nThe warm attachment that springs from the heart is lacking here. We are by this time actually outside of fellowship with others. However, we ally ourselves with them. The fellowship does not include all, but only those who happen to dwell near one another. The meadow is the pasture at the entrance to the town. At this stage, the ultimate goal of the union of mankind has not yet been attained, but we need not reproach ourselves. We join the community without separate aims of our own.\n\nindex\n\n14. Ta Yu / Possession in Great Measure\n\nabove LI THE CLINGING, FLAME\n\nbelow CH'IEN THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN\n\nThe fire in heaven above shines far, and all things stand out in the light and become manifest. The weak fifth line occupies the place of honor and all the strong lines are in accord with it.All things come to the man who is modest and kind in a high position.\n\nTHE JUDGMENT\n\nPOSSESSION IN GREAT MEASURE.\n\nSupreme success.\n\nThe two trigrams indicate that strength and clarity unite. Possessions great measure is determined by fate and accords with the time. How is it possible that the weak line has power to hold the strong lines fast and to possess them? It is done by virtue of unselfish modesty. The time is favorable--a time of strength within, clarity and culture without. Power is expressing itself in graceful and controlled way. This brings supreme success and wealth.\n\nTHE IMAGE\n\nFire in heaven above:\n\nThe image of POSSESSION IN GREAT MEASURE.\n\nThus the superior man curbs evil and furthers good,\n\nAnd thereby obeys the benevolent will of heaven.\n\nThe sun in heaven above, shedding light over everything one earth, is the image of possession on a grand scale. But a possession of this sort must be administered properly. The sun brings both evil and good into the light of day. Man must combat and curb the evil, and must favor and promote the good. Only in this way does he fulfill the benevolent will of God, who desires only good and not evil.\n\nTHE LINES\n\nNine at the beginning means:\n\nNo relationship with what is harmful;\n\nThere is no blame in this.\n\nIf one remains conscious of difficulty,\n\nOne remains without blame.\n\nGreat possession that is still in its beginnings and that has not yet been challenged brings no blame, since there has been no opportunity to make mistakes. Yet there are many difficulties to be overcome. It is only by remaining conscious of theses difficulties that one can keep inwardly free of possible arrogance and wastefulness, and thus in principle overcome all cause for blame.\n\nNine in the second place means:\n\nA big wagon for loading.\n\nOne may undertake something.\n\nNo blame.\n\nGreat possession consists not only in the quantity of goods at one's disposal, but first and foremost, in their mobility and utility, for then they can be used in undertakings, and we remain free of embarrassment and mistakes. The big wagon, which will carry a heavy load and in which one can journey farm means that there are at hand able helpers who give their support t and are equal to their task. One can load great responsibility upon such persons, and this is necessary in important undertakings.\n\nNine in the third place means:\n\nA prince offers it to the Son of Heaven.\n\nA petty man cannot do this.\n\nA magnanimous, liberal-minded man should not regard what he possesses as his exclusive personal property , but should place it at the disposal of the ruler or of the people at large. In so doing, he takes the right attitude toward his possession, which as private property can never endure. A petty man is incapable of this. He is harmed by great possessions, because instead of sacrificing them, he would keep them for himself.\n\nNine in the fourth place means:\n\nHe makes a difference\n\nBetween himself and his neighbor.\n\nNo blame.\n\nThis characterizes the position of a man placed among rich and powerful neighbors. It is a dangerous position. He must look neither to the right nor to the left, and must shun envy and the temptation to vie with others. In this way he remains free of mistakes.\n\nSix in the fifth place means:\n\nHe whose truth is accessible, yet dignified,\n\nHas good fortune.\n\nThe situation is very favorable. People are being won not by coercion but by unaffected sincerity, so that they are attached to us in sincerity and truth. However, benevolence alone is not sufficient at the time of POSSESSION IN GREAT MEASURE. For insolence might begin to spread. Insolence must be kept in bounds by dignity; then good fortune is assured.\n\nNine at the top means:\n\nHe is blessed by heaven.\n\nGood fortune.\n\nNothing that does not further.\n\nIn the fullness of possession and at the height of power, one remains modest and gives honor to the sage who stands outside the affairs of the world. By this means one puts oneself under the beneficent influence descending form heaven, and all goes well. Confucius says of this line:\n\nTo bless means to help. Heaven helps the man who is devoted; men help the man who is true. He who walks in truth and is devoted in his thinking, and furthermore reveres the worthy, is blessed by heaven. He has good fortune, and there is nothing that would not further.\n\nindex\n\n15. Ch'ien / Modesty\n\nabove K'UN THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH\n\nbelow KEN KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN\n\nThis hexagram is made up of the trigrams KÃªn, Keeping Still, mountain, and K'un. The mountain is the youngest son of the Creative, the representative of heaven and earth. It dispenses the blessings of heaven, the clouds and rain that gather round its summit, and thereafter shines forth radiant with heavenly light. This shows what modesty is and how it functions in great and strong men. K'un, the earth, stands above. Lowliness is a quality of the earth: this is the very reason why it appears in this hexagram as exalted, by being placed above the mountain. This shows how modesty functions in lowly, simple people: they are lifted up by it.\n\nTHE JUDGMENT\n\nMODESTY creates success.\n\n. The superior man carries things through.\n\nIt is the law of heaven to make fullness empty and to make full what is modest; when the sun is at its zenith, it must, according to the law of heaven, turn toward its setting, and at its nadir it rises toward a new dawn. In obedience to the same law, the moon when it is full begins to wane, and when empty of light it waxes again. This heavenly law works itself out in the fates of men also. It is the law of earth to alter the full and to contribute to the modest. High mountains are worn down by the waters, and the valleys are filled up. It is the law of fate to undermine what is full and to prosper the modest. And men also hate fullness and love the modest. The destinies of men are subject to immutable laws that must fulfill themselves. But man has it in his power to shape his fate, according as his behavior exposes him to the influence of benevolent or of destructive forces. When a man holds a high position and is nevertheless modest, he shines with the light of wisdom; if he is in a lowly position and is modest, he cannot be passed by. Thus the superior man can carry out his work to the end without boasting of what he has achieved.\n\nTHE IMAGE\n\nWithin the earth, a mountain:\n\nThe image of MODESTY.\n\nThus the superior man reduces that which is too much,\n\nAnd augments that which is too little.\n\nHe weighs things and makes them equal.\n\nThe wealth of the earth in which a mountain is hidden is not visible to the eye, because the depths are offset by the height of the mountain. Thus high and low competent each other and the result is the plain. Here an effect that it took a long time to achieve, but that in the end seems easy of accomplishment and self-evident, is used as the image of modesty. The superior man does the same thing when he establishes order in the world; he equalizes the extremes that are the source of social discontent and thereby creates just and equable conditions.\n\nTHE LINES\n\nSix at the beginning means:\n\nA superior man modest about his modesty\n\nMay cross the great water.\n\nGood fortune.\n\nA dangerous enterprise, such as the crossing of a great stream, is made much more difficult if many claims and considerations have to be taken into account. On the other hand, the task is easy if it is attended to quickly and simply. Therefore the unassuming attitude of mind that goes with modesty fits a man to accomplish even difficult undertakings: he imposes no demands or stipulations but settles matters easily and quickly. Where no claims are put forward, no resistances arise.\n\nSix in the second place means:\n\nModesty that comes to expression. Perseverance brings good fortune.\n\n\"Out of the fullness of the heart the mouth speaketh.\" When a man's attitude of mind is so modest that this expresses itself in his outward behavior, it is a source of good fortune to him. For the possibility of exerting a lasting influence arises of itself and no one can interfere.\n\nNine in the third place means:\n\nA superior man of modesty and merit\n\nCarries things to conclusion.\n\nGood fortune.\n\nThis is the center of the hexagram, where its secret is disclosed. A distinguished name is readily earned by great achievements. If a man allows himself to be dazzled by fame, he will soon be criticized, and difficulties will arise. If, on the contrary, he remains modest despite his merit, he makes himself beloved and wins the support necessary for carrying his work through to the end.\n\nSix in the fourth place means:\n\nNothing that would not further modesty\n\nIn movement.\n\nEverything has its proper measure. Even modesty in behavior can be carried too far. Here, however, it is appropriate, because the place between a worthy helper below and a kindly ruler above carries great responsibility. The confidence of the man in superior place must not be abused nor the merits of the man in inferior placed concealed. There are officials who indeed do not strive for prominence; they hide behind the letter of ordinances, decline all responsibility, accept pay without giving its equivalent in work, and bear empty titles. This is the opposite of what is meant here by modesty. In such a position, modesty is shown by interest in one's work.\n\nSix in the fifth place means:\n\nNo boasting of wealth before one's neighbor.\n\nIt is favorable to attack with force.\n\nNothing that would not further.\n\nModesty is not to be confused with weak good nature that lets things take their own course. When a man holds a responsible position, he must at times resort to energetic measures. In doing so he must not try to make an impression by boasting of his superiority but must make certain of the people around him. The measures taken should be purely objective and in no way personally offensive. Thus modesty manifests itself even in severity.\n\nSix at the top means:\n\nModesty that comes to expression.\n\nIt is favorable to set armies marching\n\nTo chastise one's own city and one's country.\n\nA person who is really sincere in his modesty must make it show in reality. He must proceed with great energy in this. When enmity arises nothing is easier than to lay the blame on another. A weak man takes offense perhaps, and draws back, feeling self-pity; he thinks that it is modesty that keeps him from defending himself. Genuine modesty sets one to creating order and inspires one to begin by disciplining one's own ego and one's immediate circle. Only through having the courage to marshal one's armies against oneself, will something forceful really be achieved.\n\nindex\n\n16.
