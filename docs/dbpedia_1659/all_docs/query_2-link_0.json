        "text": "Record label\n\nRecord label\n\nDaptone Records is a funk and soul independent record label based in Brooklyn, New York.[1] Best known as the home of Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings and Charles Bradley, the label boasts a roster which includes Menahan Street Band, The Budos Band, The Sugarman 3, and Antibalas, and runs the recording studio Daptone's House of Soul.[2]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nDaptone Records was formed in 2001 by Gabriel Roth (Bosco Mann) and Neal Sugarman. Daptone was born out of the closure of Desco Records, a label run by Roth with fellow musician Philip Lehman who both played in the band Soul Providers.[3] Roth and Lehman ended their band and business relationship in 2000. Roth, who had played with Sharon Jones as part of the Soul Providers, subsequently founded a new label with Neal Sugarman, leader of The Sugarman 3, as the home of their new group, Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings.\n\nTheir first release was 2002's Dap Dippin' with Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings.[4] In their first four years, Daptone would also put out Sharon Jones' sophomore album, Naturally, as well as original releases by the Sugarman 3 and Dap-Kings-adjacent The Budos Band.\n\nDuring this time, they also converted a two-family home in Bushwick, Brooklyn into an analog recording studio space. The first album recorded there was Antibalas's \"Who Is this America?\" in July 2003. Producer Mark Ronson became a fan of the studio. He brought in Amy Winehouse to record parts of her album Back to Black there with The Dap-Kings and Antibalas members Nick Movshon and Victor Axelrod.[4] The Dap-Kings would tour with Winehouse in 2007.[3]\n\nIn addition to Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings, Daptone has recorded and released the music of Antibalas, The Sugarman 3, The Budos Band, The Poets of Rhythm, The Mystery Lights, The Daktaris, The Mighty Imperials, Lee Fields, Charles Bradley, Binky Griptite, The Sha La Das, and Naomi Davis. The Daptone Record label is inexorably tied to Sharon Jones. The label and members of her band were with her during the last weeks before her death.[5]\n\nSince its founding, Daptone has released over one hundred 45\" singles and fifty albums.[6]\n\nImprints\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2021, Daptone operates four specialty imprints.\n\nEver-Soul, an imprint that reissues rare soul singles from the 1960s and 1970s.[7]\n\nDunham, a label run by Thomas Brenneck and Homer Steinweiss, best known for their releases of Charles Bradley and Menahan Street Band.[8]\n\nPenrose, a South California offshoot of Daptone began by Bosco Mann in 2020.[9]\n\nWick, a subsidiary founded in the late 2010s with a roster of rock-leaning artists.[10]\n\nRecording studios\n\n[edit]\n\nDaptone built their studio, called Daptone's House of Soul, in a converted two-family home in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn. It was very run down when they first rented it, and the neighborhood was not great. Daptone Records has its offices in the top floor, the studio is on the ground floor. The label built the studio from scratch, and made the decision to not have computers, but to rely completely on the more old-fashioned analog recording methods to make music. There are tape machines and a CD recorder, but no Pro Tools or digital reverbs.[11]\n\nThe studio is where they have recorded most of their releases. Their distinctive sound is a product of the studio acoustics, recording only on analog tape (no digital), and mixing done by Roth. The recording studio and engineering personnel have been sought out by record producers such as Mark Ronson.[12]\n\nIn February 2009, Daptone's House of Soul was broken into and thieves made off with the better part of its equipment.[13][14]\n\nArtists\n\n[edit]\n\nAdam Scone\n\nAntibalas\n\nBenjamin & the Right Direction\n\nBob & Gene\n\nCharles Bradley\n\nCochemea\n\nLee Fields\n\nMenahan Street Band\n\nNaomi Shelton & The Gospel Queens\n\nOrquesta Akokán\n\nSaun and Starr AKA \"The Dap-ettes\"\n\nSharon Jones & The Dap-Kings\n\nThe Budos Band\n\nThe Como Mamas\n\nThe Frightnrs\n\nThe James Hunter Six\n\nThe Mighty Imperials\n\nThe Sugarman 3\n\nThe Olympians\n\nThe Sha La Das\n\nThee Sacred Souls\n\nWick imprint artists\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Ar-Kaics\n\nThe Jay-Vons\n\nThe Mystery Lights\n\nMichael Rault\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nArtist Title Catalog Number Release date Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings Dap Dippin' with Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings DAP-001 2002 Sugarman Three & Co.
