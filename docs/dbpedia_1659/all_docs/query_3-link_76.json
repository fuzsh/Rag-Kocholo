Should you be admitted and enroll, your final official transcripts, indicating your graduation date, must be received by July 1.\n\nApplication Fee & Waivers\n\nApplication Fee\n\nThe $110 application fee is nonrefundable and must be paid through your application status page upon submission of your application. Your application is not considered complete until the fee has been received.\n\nFee Waivers\n\nThe inability to pay a college application fee should not be a barrier to applying to The Juilliard School. We offer need-based fee waivers through the process described here, and in the application.\n\nFirst-time College Students\n\nFee waiver requests are available for first-time college students who demonstrate significant financial need by uploading one of the following to the application:\n\nAn official SAT or ACT fee waiver form signed by a high school counselor OR\n\nAn official NACAC fee waiver form signed by a high school counselor OR\n\nA letter on school stationery from a school counselor stating one of the following:\n\nYou are enrolled in or eligible to participate in the Federal Free or Reduced Price Lunch program (FRPL).\n\nYour annual family income falls within the income eligibility guidelines set by the USDA Food and Nutrition Service.\n\nYou are enrolled in a federal, state, or local program that aids students from low-income families (e.g., TRIO programs such as Upward Bound).\n\nYour family receives public assistance.\n\nYou live in federally subsidized public housing, a foster home, or are homeless.\n\nYou are a ward of the state or an orphan.\n\nIf you are unable to provide one of the above documents, you may provide the following:\n\nA letter from someone other than you (the applicant) that addresses your financial situation\n\nAll documentation must be in English. Original documents with translation are acceptable.\n\nTransfer Students\n\nFee waiver requests are available for undergraduate transfer students who demonstrate significant financial need by uploading of one of the following to the application:\n\nIf you are independent, a copy of your most recent tax form filed OR\n\nA letter on school stationery from your current college's Financial Aid Office stating that you have financial need of a fee waiver\n\nIf you are unable to provide one of the above documents, you may provide the following:\n\nA personal letter describing your financial situation\n\nAll documentation must be in English. Original documents with translation are acceptable.\n\nFee waiver requests will be evaluated after you have submitted a complete application. If you are requesting a fee waiver, please submit your application (including fee waiver documentation) but do not pay the application fee.\n\nHow to Upload\n\nFee waiver documentation (translated into English if not originally in that language) must be uploaded directly within the online application and submitted by the appropriate deadline. Documents must be in either .doc or .pdf format. (Convert your file to another format if you have scanned your document as a jpg.)\n\nFee waiver requests are processed on an ongoing basis. You will receive an email with the results of your request as soon as it is processed. Note that we have a heavy volume of requests to process at the deadline, so you may not receive your results until after the deadline has passed. This does not disqualify your application. Do not pay the application fee if your waiver request is still pending.\n\nYour application status page will show an application fee payment due until your request is approved. If you are notified that your request for an application fee waiver is denied, you will be required to pay the application fee. Your application is not considered complete until the fee has been received. If your fee waiver request is processed after the deadline, and is denied, you will still have a grace period in which to pay the fee.\n\nYour Application Materials\n\nYour Online Application\n\nYour application must be submitted online by the appropriate deadline. To begin, create your Juilliard Admissions Account, gather all of the required application materials, and follow the instructions to complete your application.\n\nStart your online application\n\nYour Essay(s)\n\nA written essay is one of Juilliard’s application requirements. Our Admissions Committee uses your essay(s) to learn more about you as an individual, and to gain a sense of who you are beyond your application, transcript, and audition. Your essay helps the Admissions Committee understand how your past experiences have informed your life as an actor, and how Juilliard fits into your pursuit of a career in acting.\n\nEssays are evaluated on the way you express your ideas, the written flow of your thoughts, and your use of language (including grammar and mechanics). Using outside help to write your essay—whether generative AI, including tools such as Google Bard and ChatGPT, or help from another person—undermines the ability of the Admissions Committee to evaluate your potential for success at Juilliard. Submission of your essay confirms that the writing was produced by you, with no assistance from another person or electronic resource.\n\nEssay Requirements\n\n1–2 pages, double-spaced, 12-point font\n\nwritten in English (not translated from another language)\n\nmust be your own original work\n\nsubmitted within the online application\n\nTips for Writing Your Essay\n\nTake time to think about what you would say to the Admissions Committee about your experiences and goals as an actor.\n\nGet the ideas down in a rough draft, and then speak them out loud.\n\nEdit your rough draft so that it is clear, and expresses your thoughts. Avoid bland, general statements about being an actor.\n\nHave a friend read the essay to give you feedback on whether it genuinely sounds like you.\n\nReview the final draft for grammatical and spelling errors. (Remember that “Juilliard” is spelled with two “I”s: JUI-LLI-ARD.)\n\nAttach your essay to your application.\n\nRemember that AI may be a shortcut, but in the end, it does not represent your own thoughts. If you are seeking an education at The Juilliard School, self-examination and honesty are qualities that will serve your growth.\n\nTopic\n\nPlease write about why you have chosen to become an actor and your personal artistic goals. We encourage you to write frankly and openly about your life, your connection to your art, and how you see your art connecting to the world. Share your passion about people, politics, other art forms or anything that speaks to you.\n\nAdditional Essay Requirements\n\nAdditional essays are required in each of the following circumstances:\n\nTransfer Students\n\nFormerly Enrolled Juilliard Students\n\nCurrently Enrolled Juilliard Students\n\nOptional Essay\n\nShould you have a personal or academic circumstance to share that you feel can provide context for a particular point on your resume – for example, a gap year, unusually low grades in a semester or year, etc. – you have the option to submit an additional short essay.\n\nYour Transcripts\n\nTranscripts are an important component of the decision process. They help us determine if you have sufficient scholastic competence to succeed in coursework at the level for which you are applying. Please send your transcript by the requested deadline found in the application timeline above.\n\nThe Juilliard School accepts both official and unofficial transcripts during the application process. Students who are admitted and plan to enroll in the fall will be required to submit a final official transcript of their studies.\n\nWe understand that the current academic year has not ended, and that, if you are currently enrolled, you have not yet completed your program. Please submit your incomplete transcript as is by the deadline; an official final transcript will be required later, if you are admitted and choose to enroll.\n\nYou may view the status of receipt of transcripts at any time by logging into your application account. Please note that it may take the Office of Admissions up to seven business days to process your transcript after it has been received.\n\nUnofficial versus Official Transcripts\n\nAn unofficial transcript is one that you upload to your application or status page.\n\nIn addition to what is listed below in Transcript Requirements, unofficial transcripts must include your name and the name of your institution.\n\nUnofficial transcripts must be uploaded to your application or status page as a PDF.\n\nAn official transcript is one that is sent from your school directly to Juilliard. You should ask your school counselor, Registrar, or another administrator to send it to us.\n\nMany high schools use secure electronic sending services such as Naviance, Parchment, eSCRIP-SAFE, or other systems. Electronic sending services must use this email address: [email protected].\n\nAlternatively, your school can send us your official transcript via regular or express mail. Mailed transcripts must be sent in a sealed envelope directly from the issuing institution(s) to the Juilliard Office of Admissions.\n\nOffice of Admissions\n\nThe Juilliard School\n\n60 Lincoln Center Plaza\n\nNew York, NY 10023\n\nTranscript Requirements\n\nYour transcript(s) must show all prior and current coursework for your current program.\n\nFor students studying outside of the United States, your coursework must be equivalent or similar to a US high school curriculum.\n\nYou will be notified if an official evaluation of your transcript is required in order to verify your academic level.
