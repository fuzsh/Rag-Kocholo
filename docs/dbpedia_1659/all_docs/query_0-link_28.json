        "text": "ONISM025\n\nMistral - In the Throes of Losing Love\n\nPost-black metal\n\nFor fans of Alcest, Sadness, Agalloch.\n\nOnism Productions and Folkvangr Records proudly present \"In the Throes of Losing Love\", the entrancing new album from Mistral. Nine tracks of Polish post-black metal combining the contradicting beauty and anguish of bands such as Alcest, Sadness and Agalloch - with their own unique touch. Following the loss of their bassist, the music has only become deeper and more emotional, an expressive journey through life and death. Harsh black metal intensity justaposes serene and sometimes experimental interludes, creating an immersive musical experience to get lost within.\n\n\"In the Throes of Losing Love\" releases April 28th, on limited edition CD through Onism Productions, limited edition cassette through both Onism Productions and Folkvangr Records, and via the artist on all digital channels.\n\nIn the Throes of Losing Love by Mistra\n\nONISM024\n\nMavrodaglaria - Avars\n\nRaw black metal\n\nFor fans of Black Cilice, Pa Vash En\n\nOnism Productions is proud to release the CD edition of \"Avars\" by Mavrodaglaria; a mysterious unknown entity writing raw yet atmospheric black metal inspired by the Caucasus Mountain region.\n\n\"Cacophonous, cavernous raw atmosphere that channels the spectres of Black Cilice and Pa Vesh En among many other devout forms, in its unyielding veneration and merciless coalescence of the ancient currents of obsidian energy black metal.\"\n\nThis is a limited release digipack with black-backed CDs. The cassette is already available through Babylon Doom Cult Records, who will also release the album on vinyl soon.\n\nAvars by Mavrodaglaria\n\nONISM022\n\nTugt - Ved Lysets OphÃ¸r\n\nDark black metal\n\nFor fans of Afsky, Make A Change... Kill Yourself, Lurker of Chalice\n\nOnism Productions proudly presents Tugt, the solo project from Skoggangr of IldskÃ¦r, Ã Myrkri and GenfÃ¦rd fame.\n\n\"Ved Lysets OphÃ¸r\" is Tugt's debut album, over 8 years in the making and containing nearly an hour of powerful Danish black metal with a personal and depressive edge. Born from dark and disorderly times, the seven songs each exude their own emotive atmosphere. Diverse anguished screams overlay harsh guitars and pounding drums to create a thick darkness that moves with varying energies and pace. Whilst sometimes treading familiar black metal paths, Tugt is much more of a personal outlet for negativity, one that meanders through the surrounding undergrowth as it needs.\n\n\"Ved Lysets OphÃ¸r\" releases on February 11th, on limited edition CD and all digital channels via Onism Productions, with a cassette edition being simultaneously released by Virkelighedsfjern.\n\nVed Lysets OphÃ¸r by Tugt\n\nONISM020\n\nBenthik Zone - Îµá¼´Î´ÏÎ»Î¿Î½\n\nExploratory black metal\n\nFor fans of Esoctrilihum, Oranssi Pazuzu and Darkspace\n\nâÎµá¼´Î´ÏÎ»Î¿Î½â establishes a parallel between classical antiquity and contemporaneity by creating a poetic dialogue with various myths, stories speaking about fabulous creatures, humans and gods. It celebrates the beauty of metamorphosis and hybridism, which goes from the human being to the vegetal and animal life but carries the weight of that transition process and its consequences in the bodies of the âÎµá¼´Î´ÏÎ»Î¿Î½â characters. The latent Romanticism that goes together with the music is immense, within a context in which the subject's sexual impulses, of death and of closing inside the subject's self, take hold of the body and are skin-tight, being music the means through which it is possible to communicate the unconscious and bring to the surface all this inner rampaging. Towards the exoticism of the female body and the bliss granted by these enchanting and enigmatic characters, we welcome the detailed representations that explode into sensuality and promote a state of constant and involuntary ecstasy or narcosis. We cling to a perennial, pure and living energy, to the beauty of enlightenment and concurrently meet these elements with what is sick, frightening and deceiving, a provocation that aims to penetrate the depths of our being and the rubble of a distant submerged past.\n\nÎµá¼´Î´ÏÎ»Î¿Î½ (Eidolon) by Benthik Zone\n\nONISM016\n\nLifelost - Punitive Damnation\n\nChaotic black metal\n\nFor fans of Leviathan, SvartidauÃ°i, Altarage\n\nWith the second creation to emerge under the Lifelost banner, his solo endeavour, Phlegeton (Wormed, Banished From Inferno etc) has created something more than a simple album. He has fashioned from the darkness an alternative dimension that hangs between the ice-shard eyes of the constellations, cradled in the blackness beyond the reach of human understanding. With each haunting, harrowing hymn that unfurls from the nest of serpents that is Punitive Damnation, the damned geometry of this other worldâs tortured architecture gains strength. The visions form around the listener, taking on substance, the cold shadows of the interstellar domain bleeding through the sunlight of our reality. For those of a questing spirit Punitive Damnation can be a portal to glorious nightmares and alien splendour, a Fall into the fire.\n\nFreezing riffs tumble past like showers of stars, while each song displays an essence of primordial chaos â unrestrained, unbeholden to form and physical reality. Phlegeton has breached the wall behind which the dark seas of the void rage for eternity, siphoning a drop of that ineffable other, that force beyond god into Punitive Damnation. Sonic invocations like âMiserwolfâ and âTime Terrorâ will consume you, enthral you and carve open your soul. This is black metal at its most powerful, most imaginative, most unnerving best.\n\nPunitive Damnation by Lifelost\n\nONISM012\n\nTeitan - VÃ¡kuum\n\nProgressive black metal\n\nFor fans of Ved Buens Ende, Virus, Fleurety\n\nThe Dutch one-man black metal project by Devi Hisgen releases a brand new work consisting of five songs. Devi is already known for making experimental music with Cthuluminati and fans can expect something familiar yet very much following its own twisted path. Deviâs time spent writing in lockdowns has resulted in a completely absurd twenty-two minute trip into dark and mind-bending worlds.\n\nWith lyrics about dark scientific theories and dissonant melodies, VÃ¡kuum is a true ode to the void, a well-articulated piece of abstract art. Although Teitan truly is an entity on its own, the work fits really well into the worlds and works Devi has tied his name to. This concept for avant-garde song writing drew the attention of both Void Wanderer and Onism Productions, and since Teitan was the first band ever to release material on Zwaerdgevegt Records, it was agreed that all three labels will release the EP. Do not expect an easy listening experience, but if you are into bombastic and hypnotizing black metal, you might be in for an ominous treat.\n\nVÃ¡kuum by Teitan\n\nONISM013\n\nSea Mosquito - Fire, Magic & Venom\n\nUnorthodox black metal\n\nFor fans of Deathspell Omega, Blut Aus Nord, Saxophone solos\n\nWe present to you the tale of a man overrun by his nightmares, drenched in despair and at the threshold of madness. To protect himself from vile daemons he calls out to benevolent spirits in supplication. Repetitive and trance-like, his words form a chant. A charm against the in-pouring evil.\n\nThat imagined chant against destruction became a spark of inspiration to the unorthodox black metal travellers of Sea Mosquito. The spark became a blaze and the blaze became an unpredictable, hypnotic journey through a dark night of the soul; a vivid, visceral experience, abundant with questions and suggestions of transformation. Fire, Magic & Venom is one long, enthralling piece of music that captures that sense of elongated time and yet still manages to finish too soon and leave you searching for a way back into the dream. A glorious saxophone solo summons in the dawn, rising as the most perfect, natural addition to the snakesâ hiss guitars and wandering bass line â its absolute rightness within the breathtakingly powerful black metal that surrounds and precedes it a perfect example of Sea Mosquitoâs mastery of sonic sorcery. This band manage to epitomise the creative, rebellious strength of black metal while standing apart from its edicts and the hordes of its practitioners. Few albums can consume a listener like Fire, Magic & Venom and there are no bands that shine with quite the same lustre as Sea Mosquito.\n\nFire, Magic & Venom by Sea Mosquito\n\nONISM006\n\nGrey Aura - Zwart Vierkant\n\nProgressive black metal\n\nFor fans of Laster, Ved Buens Ende, A Forest of Stars\n\nHailing from Utrecht in The Netherlands, Grey Aura create a liquid form of atmospheric black metal which shifts between forms like quicksilver, flowing over the boundaries of genres, slipping between cracks in the restrictive walls that surround them. Their second album, Zwart Vierkant, is breathtaking in its breadth and independence, dazzling in its ambition and utterly enthralling and all consuming in its complexity of vision. The collision of raging fury and romance within songs like âSierlijke Schaduwmondâ is bewitching, the sweet, smoky jazz of âParijs Is Een Portalâ is, as suggested, a doorway to another time, another world, another reality. The album is bound tightly to a novel written by Grey Auraâs Ruben Wijlacker which tells the story of an early 20th century painter who becomes obsessed with the Russian art movement, Suprematism, which idealises the abstract and rejects traditional artistic concepts. It follows his journey through Europe, his metamorphosis of soul and spirit, his dreams, awakenings, loves and temptations as he reaches out to the ungovernable maelstrom of the void. Each song on Zwart Vierkant is imbued with the sensuality of the tale, rife with its mysteries and laden with its ambiguities and suggestive power. It is an album like no other from a band that reach further, look deeper and explore beyond the limits of imagination.\n\nZwart Vierkant by Grey Aura\n\nONISM008\n\nPhreneticum - Der Stille Zerfall\n\nTraditional black metal\n\nFor fans of Sarkrista, Imperium Dekadandz and Darkened Nocturn Slaughtercult\n\nIn conspiracy with Satanath Records, we proudly introduce Phreneticum, a new found force of German black metal!\n\nWinter is the time of darkness, depression and madness. In these dark days, the screams of Leichenfresse and distorted guitar sound of Fluch (Abigorum, Trond, Wulfgar) thunder through the silent night of GroÃthiemig. Phreneticum, named after the mental illness, is a project from the deepest part of East Germany. The members met in 2015 for the first rehearsals and evolved through several lineups whilst the first recordings were made. These productions continuously developed over time and ultimately shaped the sound of today. Finally, the debut album \"Der Stille Zerfall\" is ready! Be prepared for 45 minutes of traditional German black metal for fans of Sarkrista, Imperium Dekadandz and Darkened Nocturn Slaughtercult.\n\nArtwork by Luciana Nedelea.\n\nDer Stille Zerfall by Phreneticum\n\nONISM010\n\nThermohaline - MaelstrÃ¶m\n\nExperimental black metal\n\nFor fans of Druon Antigon, DHG, ...And Oceans\n\nWith the surging power of their progressively minded black metal, Thermohaline summon up the secrets of the hidden depths and ride upon the cold winds that rage across the seas. They celebrate the ancient halls beyond the faintest glimpse of light and revel in the terrors that stalk the tales of babbling madmen and old sailors who have long forgotten the feel of earth beneath their feet. Bringing together the exceptional talents of Lennart Janssen (Druon Antigon), Ignacio Elias Rosner (IER, Uroboros) and Nuno LourenÃ§o (Salqiu, 0-NUN) this unique project captures moments of beauty, moments of sanity-shaking fear and the essence of the incredible might of the oceans that encircle our planet. Myths, mystery and overwhelming science collide in an enthralling, consuming, atmospheric creation. Thermohaline preserve the cold heart of black metal whilst crashing against its banks and flooding its many tributaries, dragging strange debris and unexpected treasures back into its chill waters. The results are both stunning and utterly remarkable, a new vision for black metal which the musicians themselves refer to as ânautical dementiaâ. Infused with emotion, rife with melody, yearningly familiar and yet shockingly alien...the waters of the MaelstrÃ¶m await you.\n\nMaelstrÃ¶m by Thermohaline\n\nONISM005\n\nDruon Antigon - Desontstijging\n\nCosmic black metal / Glitch\n\nFor fans of Darkspace, Venetian Snares, Mizmor\n\nBoth the chilling realisation of humankindâs utter insignificance and the calm acceptance of that truth are explored within the vast scope of Druon Antigonâs debut of cosmic black metal, Desontstijging. From harsh, unflinching diatribes against self deception, to awe filled wanderings amongst the impossible vastness of the celestial bodies and the cold, black eternities that lie between the stars; this is an album like no other. Furious blast beats and riffs of ice break upon steel spikes of electronics, dissipating into visionary soundscapes. Raging, howling vocals tear through endless skies before being slowly frozen into silence and left tumbling through the limitless expanses of space. Far from hopeless, the music of Druon Antigon guides us from delusions of grandeur to the understanding of true possibilities. These songs that balance soul-shredding fear and exhilarating discovery, explore alien extremes and human emotion and walk the hinterlands of both perfect peace and endless war are striving to encompass so much more than we ever stumble across in our blinkered day-to-day existence. Desontstijging is ambitious, challenging, confrontational and also incredibly rewarding.\n\nDesontstijging by Druon Antigon\n\nONISM004\n\nEpitimia - Allusion\n\nPost-Black / Atmospheric Black Metal\n\nFor fans of Drudkh, Selbst, Afsky\n\nEpitimia have carved out their own niche within the black metal scene. Their music is riven with heartache, instilled with a sense of separation and isolation. The guitars ascend mountains of longing, fall hopelessly into ravines of despair and the desperate vocals howl against a backdrop of ice and shadows. Epitimiaâs sixth album, Allusion, entwines you in emotions so powerful they are inescapable and when its final echoes fade away a sense of otherness persists, holding you apart from the life that was once so comfortable.\n\nAllusion is a pivotal release in Epitimiaâs career, with each of the songs being a complete re-imagining of themes from the bandâs past. It represents a doorway to their future and a revealing of the true power that has always flowed like a hidden, underground stream through their previous albums.\n\nAllusion by Epitimia\n\nONISM003\n\nMisertus - Daydream / Coil / Outland\n\nPost-Black Metal / Blackgaze\n\nFor fans of Violet Cold, Harakiri For The Sky, An Autumn For Crippled Children\n\nOver the course of one year, 2019, the man behind the shroud that is Misertus, Tomas, poured out his conflicts and his agonies, his dreams and redemptions and the battlegrounds and common grounds that lie amidst them all, in three glorious, tumultuous, visionary albums. Daydream, Coil and Outland each possess their own characters and stories, their own sounds and textures, but they are inextricably linked, undeniably born from the same post black metal flame. Daydream brings us the hooks, the spaces, the light and shade of âFragilityâ, the brittle fury of âWaterfallsâ...and âOutwardâ, like standing in a rainfall of broken dreams, their shards tumbling from the heavens. Coil opens in an uplifting, shimmering sunrise over snow capped mountains, with ice in the air. Beautiful, natural melodies flow over underlying currents of melancholy, a juxtaposition of hope and sadness forming perfect harmonies, magical counterpoints. The gentle peace of âPauseâ a beautiful moment when the howling banshee voice is silent, left screaming within the heart of the maelstrom. With Outland we dive wholly into the world of dreams, our mind and soul laid bare, all our triumphs and adversities captured in the swelling of sound, the glorious thunder and power of âBlue Spiritsâ and the intensely emotional, transforming finale of âAether (A Distant Ember)â. Together these stunning albums are more than the sum of their parts. Together is how they always should have been. Together is how they are.\n\nNever before available in any physical format, Onism Productions have made Daydream, Coil and Outland one; in a matte finish, eight panel, three CD digi-pack. Including for the first time the three poems which were adapted to create the lyrics of this trilogy, this is the ultimate representation of Misertusâ year of supreme creativity. Overpowering yet intimate, celebratory yet heart rending, this is the music of the universe, the sound of wishes and anguish entwined.\n\nDaydream / Coil / Outland by Misertus\n\nONISM002\n\nLord Orots - Conquering the Infinite Void\n\nAmtmospheric Black Metal / Dungeon Synth\n\nFor fans of Summoning, Lustre, Eldamar\n\nWith Conquering The Infinite Void, Lord Orots invites us into his dreams and we accompany him as he wanders an endless world of hope, promise, fear and danger. The visions of Lord Orotâs dreams are brought to stunning, vivid life through four epic tracks that entwine atmospheric black metal, immersive ambient textures and the cold illusions of dungeon synth. Harsher and more dynamic than the Latzineko Erresumaren Itzulera album, in which Lord Orots revealed to us the cursed world of Latzine, Conquering The Infinite Void expands the boundaries of this remarkable recording project. However the two albums remain inextricably linked, as on the fourth and final track of Conquering The Infinite Void, âThe Lord Rises From His Throneâ, Lord Orots returns to the waking world once more, with percussive echoes of Latzineko Erresumaren Itzulera. This is a grand, musical fantasy but one which creates an intimate connection with the character of Lord Orots, drawing the listener into the mysterious existence of this solitary figure.\n\nPresented in the evocative artwork of Joan Llopis DomÃ©nech (Sojourner, Lustre, Ruadh), Conquering The Infinite Void possesses its own unique character that will delight existing fans of Lord Orots and his slumbers, while opening up this magical world to new listeners as well. Onism Productions will reveal the gateway to Lord Orotsâ realm on August 7th and an unforgettable journey awaits.\n\nConquering the Infinite Void by Lord Orots\n\nONISM001\n\nAmherawdr - Adorned With the Figures of Snakes\n\nAtmospheric & Progressive Black Metal\n\nFor fans of Fen, Negura Bunget, Primordial\n\nAmherawdr formed in Devon with the intention of writing heartfelt black metal music inspired by the bleak romance and mysticism of ancient Britain. A handful of songs known as The Hidden Valley sessions were composed that most likely will not see the light of day, but this creative period culminated in 2010 with the writing of 'Adorned with the Figures of Snakes', the definitive statement of that original potent intent. Recording of this album was almost completed the following year, but internal differences resulted in an amicable decline that left the band moribund. Winds change, seasons turn, dust gathers.\n\nAfter a decade in the shadows, this sonic portrait of the heart of old Dumnonia is now given the release it so thoroughly deserves. 'Adorned with the Figures of Snakes' is available for pre-order on limited edition 6-panel digipack and through all digital channels now.\n\nThe band 'as was' is certainly dead and buried, but none can say whether Amherawdr may not one day give voice again.\n\nAdorned With the Figures of Snakes by Amherawdr"
