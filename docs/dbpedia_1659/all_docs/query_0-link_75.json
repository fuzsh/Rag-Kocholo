While we focus on Black and Death Metal primarily, we have an open mind when it comes to music and our releases reflect that. DHR has always been an innovator label in the underground music scene being the first label to release albums by such ground breaking and now “CULT” artists the likes of BLACK WITCHERY, REVENGE, FOG, FLAUROS, ASTRIAAL, NEBRON, LUCIFUGUM to the anti-religious and extremely profound music of TYPHUS & FORNICUS as well as the somber and solitude infused Dark Neo-Folk of NECHOCHWEN & OCTOBER FALLS and even the metal infused Samhain / Misfits influenced Horror Metal Punk of THE LURKING CORPSES. DHR shines as a beacon among the vast ocean of underground labels as one with Relevance, Integrity and Dedication to the bands, music and philosophy they project. Helping the deep underground reach the surface!\n\nDHR040 - FORNICUS \"SULPHURIC OMNIPOTENCE\" CD / SHIRT (USA) 2020 AVAILABLE\n\nDHR039 - KARKOSA \"HARVEST OF THE ADEPT\" CD (USA) 2018 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR038 - DEMONIC TEMPLE \"INCREMENTUM\" CD (Poland) 2018 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR036 - OBSCURE DEVOTION \"UBI CERTA PAX EST\" DIGI CD (ITALY) 2017 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR033 - TYPHUS \"GRAND MOLESTERS OF THE HOLY TRINITY\" CD RE-ISSUE (USA) SOLD OUT\n\nDHR033 - TYPHUS \"GRAND MOLESTERS OF THE HOLY TRINITY\" CD (USA) 2010 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR033 - TYPHUS \"GRAND MOLESTERS OF THE HOLY TRINITY\" LP (USA) 2010 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR032 - SPIRITUAL DECAY \"CLOSER TO THE GRAVE\" CD (USA) 2009 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR031 - THE LURKING CORPSES \"LUST FOR BLOOD\" CD 2008 (USA) SOLD OUT\n\nDHR030 - NECHOCHWEN \"ALGONKIAN MYTHOS\" CD (USA) 2008 AVAILABLE\n\nDHR029 - OCTOBER FALLS \"MARRAS\" CD (Finland) 2007 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR028 - OCTOBER FALLS \"TUONI\" CD (Finland) 2007 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR027 - TYHPUS / CROWNED IN SEMEN \"WE RAPE THE CUNT OF THE VIRGIN MARY...\" 7\" EP 2007 (USA) SOLD OUT\n\nDHR026 - MYTHERIUM \"GODS OF CHAOS\" CD (USA) (Side Project of Lord Typhus and Conqueror Crimson of FOG) CANCELED\n\nDHR025 - NATASSIEVILA \"ITER LETHALIS\" CD (Italy) 2007 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR024 - WALLACHIA \"BEHIND THE LIGHT\" CD (Norway) 2006 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR023 - CRYPTIC \"ONCE HOLY REALM\" CD (USA) 2006 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR022 - HARVIST \"LIGHTNING STORM IN THE VEINS\" CD 2006 (USA) SOLD OUT\n\nDHR021 - ENGORGE \"COLD.BLACK.EJACULATION\" CD (USA) 2005 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR020 - SAURON \"UNIVERSE OF FILTH\" CD (The Netherlands) 2005 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR019 - TYPHUS \"PROFOUND BLASPHEMOUS PROCLAMATION\" DIGIBOOK CD / SHIRT (USA) 2020 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR019 - TYPHUS \"PROFOUND BLASPHEMOUS PROCLAMATION\" CD (USA) 2005 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR019 - TYPHUS \"PROFOUND BLASPHEMOUS PROCLAMATION\" 12\" LP (USA) 2005 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR019 - TYPHUS \"PROFOUND BLASPHEMOUS PROCLAMATION\" 12\" PICTURE LP (USA) 2005 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR018 - ABIGOR \"SHOCKWAVE 666\" 7\" EP (Austria) 2004 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR017 - HORDES OF THE LUNAR ELIPSE \"DANCING DEMONS IN THE GREY-LIT GLADE\" CD (USA) 2004 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR017 - HORDES OF THE LUNAR ECLIPSE \"DANCING DEMONS...\" 12\" LP + 7\" EP (USA) (SERPENS CAPUT) 2004 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR016 - ENGORGE \"DEAD.FUCK.BLACKNESS\" CD (USA) 2003 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR015 - WARKULT \"PERSERVERANCE OF AGGRESSION\" CD (USA) 2003 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR014 - ASTRIAAL \"THE THRONE TO PERISH-AN ICON OF DISEASE\" 7\" EP (Australia) 2003 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR013 - FOG \"FROM WITHIN THE DARKNESS BEYOND ETERNITY\" 7\" EP (USA) 2003 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR012 - ALLFATHER/NEBRON/HORDES OF THE LUNAR ECLIPSE/GNOSTIC 4 WAY SPLIT CD (USA/Canada/Hungary) 2003 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR011 - REVENGE \"ATTACK.BLOOD.REVENGE\" 12\" LP (Canada) 2020 (Season of Mist) AVAILABLE\n\nDHR011 - REVENGE \"ATTACK.BLOOD.REVENGE\" CD (Canada) 2020 SOLD OUT (Season of Mist)\n\nDHR011 - REVENGE \"ATTACK.BLOOD.REVENGE\" MCD (Canada) 2002 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR010 - FLAUROS \"THIRD CURSE\" 7\" EP (Finland) 2002 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR009 - HARVIST \"A GLEAM IN THE NIGHT\" CD (USA) 2002 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR008 - LUCIFUGUM \"INSTINCT PREVALENCE\" DIGIBOOK CD (Ukraine) REISSUE 2024\n\nDHR008 - LUCIFUGUM \"INSTINCT \"PREVALENCE\" CD (Ukraine) 1999 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR007 - HORNA / FOG 7\" EP (Finland/USA) 2001 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR006 - FOG \"THROUGH THE EYES OF NIGHT WINGED THEY COME\" CD (USA) SOLD OUT\n\nDHR006 - FOG \"THROUGH THE EYES OF NIGHT WINGED THEY COME\" CD (USA) (WWIII MUSIC) 2001 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR006 - FOG \"THROUGH THE EYES OF NIGHT WINGED THEY COME\" 12\" LP (USA) (ORDEALIS PRODUCTIONS) 2001 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR005 - LEGION \"CONQUEROR\" CD (USA) 2000 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR004 - BLACK WITCHERY/CONQUEROR \"HELLSTORM OF EVIL VENGEANCE\" LP (USA) 1999 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR003 - NEBRON \"THE MESSAGE\" CD (Hungary) 1998 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR002 - BLACK WITCHERY \"SUMMONING OF INFERNAL LEGIONS\" VINYL 7\" EP (USA) 1998 SOLD OUT\n\nDHR001 - UPON A DARK HORIZON \"UNDERGROUND COMPILATION VOL 1\" CD (World) 1998 SOLD OUT\n\nPRE DHR RELEASES\n\n1991 - 1998\n\nTHY DARKEST EMPIRE \"IN THE SORROW OF A CRIMSON SEA\" DEMO CASSETTE 1998 SOLD OUT (INDEPENDENT)\n\nBRIMSTONE \"WHAT RIDES ON THE WIND MUST BE SLAIN\" DEMO CASSETTE 1997 SOLD OUT (INDEPENDENT)\n\nMORPHEUS DESCENDS \"HORROR OF THE TRUTH\" MCD 1997 SOLD OUT (AS: ANGEL DUST RECORDS)\n\nMORPHEUS DESCENDS \"CHRONICLES OF THE SHADOWED ONES\" CD 1994 SOLD OUT (AS: ANGEL DUST RECORDS)\n\nSUBCONSCIOUS \"INDIGNANT SCRIPTURE\" DEMO CASSETTE 1994 SOLD OUT (AS: BLOODY STUMP PRODUCTIONS)\n\nSUBCONSCIOUS \"DEMO 1993\" DEMO CASSETTE 1993 SOLD OUT (AS: BLOODY STUMP PRODUCTIONS)\n\nSUBCONSCIOUS \"TORRID INHUMATION\" DEMO CASSETTE 1992 SOLD OUT (AS: BLOODY STUMP PRODUCTIONS)\n\nSUBCONSCIOUS \"PSYCHOSIS OF MELODY\" DEMO CASSETTE 1991 SOLD OUT (INDEPENDENT)"
