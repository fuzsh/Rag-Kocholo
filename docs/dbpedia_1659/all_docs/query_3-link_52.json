With 43 Broadway musicals and over 900 songs to his credit, he was one of the most well-known American composers of the 20th century, and his compositions had a significant influence on popular music. He is known for his songwriting partnerships with lyricist Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein II. With Hart, he wrote musicals throughout the 1920s and 1930s, including Pal Joey, A Connecticut Yankee, On Your Toes and Babes in Arms. With Hammerstein, he wrote musicals through the 1940s and 1950s, such as Oklahoma!, Flower Drum Song, Carousel, South Pacific, The King and I and The Sound of Music. His collaborations with Hammerstein are celebrated for bringing Broadway musicals to a new maturity by telling stories that were focused on characters and drama rather than the earlier light-hearted entertainment of the genre.\n\nOscar Hammerstein II (1895–1960) was an American lyricist, librettist, theatrical producer, and (usually uncredited) director in musical theatre for nearly 40 years. He won eight Tony Awards and two Academy Awards for Best Original Song. Many of his songs are standard repertoire for vocalists and jazz musicians. He co-wrote 850 songs. He is best known for his collaborations with composer Richard Rodgers, as the duo Rodgers and Hammerstein, whose musicals include Oklahoma!, Carousel, South Pacific, The King and I and The Sound of Music. Described by Stephen Sondheim as an “experimental playwright”, Hammerstein helped bring American musicals to a new maturity by focusing on stories and characters rather than the light-hearted entertainment that the musicals had been known for beforehand. He also collaborated with Jerome Kern (with whom he wrote Show Boat), Vincent Youmans, Rudolf Friml, Richard A. Whiting and Sigmund Romberg.\n\nHoward Lindsay (1889–1968) was an actor, stage manager, director and playwright before teaming up with Russel Crouse. Russel Crouse (1893–1966) was a newspaperman, a press agent for the Theatre Guild, the author of several books and a librettist before partnering with Howard Lindsay. Lindsay and Crouse’s partnership stands today as the longest collaboration of any writers in theatrical history, lasting for more than 28 years. The two men first joined forces in 1934, when the producer Vinton Freedley brought them together to rewrite the libretto for Anything Goes, which Lindsay directed. Two years later, they wrote another Cole Porter show, Red, Hot and Blue. Their first straight play, Life with Father, opened in 1936 and holds the record for the longest-running play on Broadway, at 3,224 performances. Among other shows, Lindsay and Crouse also wrote The Sound of Music (score by Rodgers and Hammerstein); the Pulitzer Prize-winning State of the Union; Call me Madam and Mr. President (scores by Irving Berlin); The Prescott Proposals and The Great Sebastians.
