        "text": "While pre-screening materials are required for all applicants, not all applicants will be invited to audition or interview. In some cases, successful applicants will receive a final admission decision based solely off their pre-screening and application review, while other applicants may be asked to complete an additional audition and/or interview. Applicants invited to audition and/or interview with faculty will be notified by the CCM Admissions Office staff in January and applicants will have until January 23 at 12:00pm EST to select their preferred date and time. Those who wait to schedule their audition/interview after the deadline OR request to change their already scheduled date will be charged a $100 fee. Exceptions include travel restrictions due to challenging weather, illness, or death in family.\n\nAuditions and interviews will be held in February. Check our website regularly for updates.\n\nAll CCM programs require the submission of pre-screening materials in order to be considered for admission. Faculty will review application and pre-screening materials to make admission decisions and audition/interview requests.\n\nPre-screening materials must be uploaded to CCM's Acceptd website by December 3 (unless noted otherwise). Please review your desired program requirements and audition/interview dates below.\n\nAll current CCM graduate students applying for a new graduate degree MUST submit their programs required pre-screening materials to be considered for admissions. This requirement CANNOT be waived or substituted.\n\nWithin 24-48 hours after applying to the university, undergraduate applicants will receive an email from UC Admissions with their application reference ID number and graduate applicants will receive an email with their application ID number (not the application reference number). Both undergraduate and graduates will use their unique number to gain access to upload pre-screening materials to CCM's Acceptd website.\n\nNote: Due to the high volume of applicants, please allow the admissions staff time to manually update this pre-screening requirement in your application portal."
