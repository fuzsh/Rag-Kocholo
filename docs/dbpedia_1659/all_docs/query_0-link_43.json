        "text": "Interview with Odin “The Old Goat” Thompson\n\nMoribund Records label owner and manager\n\nInterview by EvilG\n\nHail Odin, and thanks for taking the time to speak to Metal-Rules.com on the 30th anniversary of Moribund Records! First of all, congrats on 30 years – did you ever expect that you’d be running this label for this long?\n\nThank you for the gongrats, and also for this great opportunity to present our humble indie label to the Legendary Metal-Rules and your audience !\n\nFor anyone that might not know about the label, Wikipedia has the following blurb to say about the label – is it still accurate and up-to-date?\n\n“Moribund Records, also known as Moribund Cult or just Moribund, is an extreme metal record label based out of Port Orchard, Washington. It was founded in 1993 by Odin “The Old Goat” Thompson, the label owner and manager. Other staff include Ray Miller, Chris Polk, Anthony Lopez, and Kaitlin Cudaback.”\n\nFor the most part, yes. Of course that’s user-generated content. We do have our own more in-depth official Label bio, which I’ve attached and your welcome / Hellcome to include with this interview. The only inaccuracy is that Anthony “Evil Hobbit” Lopez (Also the Drummer of Black Thrash Power-Metal Legend SATAN’S HOST!) is no longer with us. He retired his position as our webmaster a few months back, to concentrate more on The HOST, his other band and his Family. We wish him the best on all endeavors, and Salute him with 1,000 Swords for his decade+ of Devotion to The Cult and our Artists :).\n\nWhat roles do the others play in helping you run the label?\n\nKaitlin Cudaback handles most of our PR work, but is also my assistant, and our MVP. She’s the person I can ALWAYS count on if there’s problems, I need extra help to make a deadline, or pretty much anything else. I could not speak highly enough about her, and how she takes everything Moribund personally, as if it were her own company.\n\nKaitlin at Moribund Records office\n\nRay Miller is our (back-up) Graphic Designer – as when (my little amount of) personal time allows, I like to do the graphic design for our albums myself – and also a personal Life-Long friend, prior business partner, and most of all a real “Brother”. For any old-dogs and bats out there who sorta recognize his name, he used to run the underground label Cursed Productions, and also published one of THE BEST old, 1st generation UG fanzines Cursed Magazine. He’s also known in the scene since the late 1980’s as “The Godlayer” \\m/.\n\nChris Polk worked in-office for almost a decade, packing wholesale orders, trade orders, & managing the warehouse… while also helping set up and manage our FB page and our original Bandcamp page.\n\nChris Polk at Moribund Records office\n\nTyler Bidwell The legendary “Lord Gorsack” has also worked with for most of the last 20 years, with a few breaks while he was out of state or dealing with family matters. He’s been back with us once more for the last 3 years, and helps daily with packing web & mail-orders (Yes, we still receive mail-orders!), trade orders and warehouse management.\n\nCernunnos our newest staff addition, he has replaced Anthony “Evil Hobbit” as webmaster and also is our new Bandcamp page manager.\n\nWe of course have had MANY other people work and intern here through the years, a few notables include Tim Bishop (Blood Ritual Guitarist, Vocalist), Tom Racine, Maija Terry, Alison Dahmen (Sky Dotter Cookies), Stephen O Malley (Sun O))), Southern Lord Records), Scott Sanders (RIP, former Blood Ritual Drummer), Mike Larson (Slut Vomit) & Mallus Stormcrow (Corvis Corax).\n\nLeft: Moribund Records office – Goresak Kris Stargraf | Right: Moribund Demonesses – Kaitlin and Freya\n\nDid they call you “the old goat” 30 years ago? haha\n\nYes, they most certainly did \\m/! To try and encapsulate an otherwise Longgggg story. It all started back in 1983-84 when I was in Jr. High. When raising my hand in class I always made the “Horns”. In Seattle public schools it was NP, as there was LOTS of other kids into 9at that time) new Heavy Metal like Dio, Maiden, Priest, Scorps etc. But in 1984 I moved from my mom’s to my fathers who was in bumb-fuck eastern WA little town of Benton City. By then I was knee deep into (my all time fave) Mercyful Fate, Slayer, Possessed, Destruction, VioVod, Sodom etc….and there was like 3 other kids other into metal, so I kinda stuck out like a sore thumb. The Spikes, Chains, Spiked 80’s thrasher hair and 80’s black-thrash thick black eyeliner etc prob. didn’t help either, ha! So most kids started calling me “Goat” way back then.\n\nFlash forward to 1990-1991, and I started distro-ing the early demo’s form bands like Beyond Dawn (Pre In the Woods), Emperor, Burzum, Mayhem LP, Rotting Christ, Varathron, etc, pre-moribund, and used to always have lots of Seattle metal people come by, hang out and buy stuff. It was around that time when a life-lng friend of mine, and metal photographer, Chris Slack added the “Old” to the goat…. Which for those whom don’t know “Old Goat” is an alternate name for Satan. It stuck, and I’ve been called that ever since!\n\nWhich is rather funny when one contemplates the whole Black Metal Moniker or “Stage Name”. As my birth name IS Odin, which others, esp. in the Viking / pagan scene have adopted, could have been a perfectly fine real and Metal moniker for me. But everyone who personally knows me says the Old Goat is more apt, and I’m all good with that!\n\nMy perception of the label was that you focus on death and black metal. However, in recent years we have seen releases from Onward, Satan’s Host, Category VI, Antipope, etc. who are clearly metal, but not exactly under the death/black styles. Do you still consider the label to be mostly about extreme metal, or are you open to all metal styles – as long as you like the band?\n\nFrom day 1, our goal has always been to release incredible and original bands whom the Majors would never sign… and keep in mind in the early 1990’s the Metal Majors were Metal Blade, Road Runner, Century Media, Nuclear Blast and Earache (and no slag against any of them by calling ‘em majors. They have ALL released multiple bands who I personally enjoy and some I even love!).\n\nThe other imperative was to only release Occult, Pagan, Ethnic/Indigenous, Satanic, Luciferian, Lovecraftian, Alchemical and real sciences based (ie, space/astrophysics, Nature, Quantum Sciences) music. This is due to my personal belief that the Judeo-Christian-Muslim based religion (yes, singular!) has been the #1 OBSTACLE to the advancement of HUMANkind over the last 2,000 years. Basically since the fall of the final Egyptian dynastic period and the Roman Empire. Read up on the dark ages, and think hard on where we could be today as a society if from Rome forward we continued with democratic ideals and sciences! But I digress….\n\nSince day 1 we have released bands whom were outside of the “normal” confines of Black & Death Metal.\n\nRelease # 2 was NOCTURNUS “Nocturnus” 8” EP / MCD, which while a DM band, were also the ones to introduce full use of Keyboards into modern extreme music.\n\nDEAD007 was the Immaculate and to this day untouchable WINDHAM HELL “South Facing Epitaph” debut album. Neo-classical Dark Metal from Snoqualmie Washington Drenched in Twin Peaks Mythology (and also real word events surrounding the movie – ask me about THAT some time!).\n\nAnother early band we released was DARKNESS ENSHROUD, which was one of the first Darkwave/Occult/Dungeon Synth bands – 2 decades before Dungeon Synth was even coined!\n\n…and now to REALLY answer the main point of your question (Blast-beat drum roll pls) – YES, we have been actively working to “expand & Diversify” our artist Roster for the last decade, adding more traditional Heavy Metal (Satan’s Host, Where Evil Follows, Toby Knapp Solo band, Category VI), Power Metal / Thrash (Onward, Malamorte, Alex Nunziati, Triskelyon), Classic Doom (Lightcrusher, Mourning Mist, Adversvm), Avant-Garde (Phase VI, new Nuclear Death), Hldr Valkyrie, LIK (Lekamen Illusionen Kallet), Sleaze Metal (FerreTT) etc.\n\nYes, I do completely consider the label as an Extreme Metal label. Even the most “Commercial” bands we work with, such as Onward, Category VI, FerreTT or Satan’s Host are not gonna be winning any Grammies or awards, or be doing headline stadium tours any time soon (sadly, of corpse – <s.i.c.>).\n\nAnd your final point – YES, I am personally into ALL forms of Metal with the Exception of Nu Metal, Uber-Tech metal, and ANYTHING with “Core” (exception GRIND!) or “Gaze” in it. So as long as a bands image / concept / lyrics fit the 1st 2 paragraphs of my answers, then we would consider them if I think they are doing something unique, or doing it better than any-one else.\n\nFor potential bands interested in Moribund – are there any styles of metal you would not be interested in signing, and on the opposite side, styles you’re actively interested in?\n\nStyles we are NOT interested in:\n\nAnything not GRIND with “Core” in it… while I WAS way into many 1980’s HC & Thrash core bands like Carnivore, The Accused (Local Faves!), S.O.D., M.O.D., DRI, Cromags etc.. all the 2000’s metalcore, deathcore etc bands just bore me. I also HATE politics in metal as a general rule. Don’t get me wrong, I am politically Active in the real world, in my personal life, I just feel it doesn’t have ANY PLACE in Music in general. The 1960’s-70’s hippie bands created enough of that to last for a few centuries :P.\n\n~ Heavy Metal and its modern sub-genre’s are “The Devils Music”, PERIOD!!! As were is predecessor Rock-n-Roll and its influencer, the Blues. Don’t wanna take my word on it? Read up on some of the amazing old quotes form the legendary Jerry Lee Lewis!\n\nAnd “Gaze”… shoegaze, metalgaze, mygaze & yourgaze! It’s all like the most boring (instead of his Great early) Xasthur album on qualudes, with bad screamo vocals. Just not into it, at all.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, although the label is underground, you are able to do a lot to help out the bands you sign. I’ve seen many on the US metal radio charts and covered in known magazines. This is quite an accomplishment when compared to the “bigger” folks like Metal Blade, Century Media, Napalm Records, Nuclear Blast, etc etc. How do you do it?\n\nWhile we definitely consider Moribund Records to be an underground label ~and we ALWAYS Will BE (!)~ and deal with our bands and partners in the underground way (as opposed to corporate music industry standards), we have certainly grown to become more of a “Major Independent” over the last decade.\n\nHowever, we operate within the “Music Industry / Business” just like the above mentioned Major Metal Labels, ie. We have in house PR team who personally and actively works each new band/album as hard as possible to all the important as well as underground magazines, and sometimes we also hire one of our additional outside PR firm partners like Metal Devastation PR, Shurshot Werks (Germany) or Asher Media Relations to do a double-PR-whammy! We hire our long time Radio PR firm partners @ Skateboard to work all our priority / bigger albums at North American Radio (and believe me, such things are Expensive!), and work all the rest of our releases direct to 300+ radio stations. We have (on a shoe-string-budget) professional video’s made for all priority releases from our staff video creator and owner of Audio Power Studios Luiz Rodrigues De Arruda… We place full page ads on the few remaining / most important PRINT mags around the world, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, we also Invest LOTS of $$ on retail Marketing to retail shops in both the US and Europe & the UK. These are basically “Pay to Play” programs where a certain indie chain or store-group guarantee’s to stock “x” amount of albums, display them on an “endcap display”, put a track on one of their listening stations and place the album on “sale Price” for a normally 1 month period. Otherwise, in this day and age of 10,000 new releases (across all genres) every week and digital streaming etc., not very many metal albums actually get brought INTO stores where people can actually physically buy and album.\n\nSo we basically do EVERYTHING within our POWER to push, promote and BUILD our bands up to the level of the Major Label bands, all on a shoe-string budget, and not enough staff or hours in a day to do as much as we want to!\n\nWe do do it through LOTS of Hard work, Dedication, Passion and many many hours and very long days 6-7 days a week, for 30 glorious and amazing years of Service to the Gods of METAL \\m/ !\n\nIn the past few years, there seems to have been an upswing in vinyl sales. Has Moribund delved much into vinyl, or is CD and digital more important?\n\nWhile there definitely has been an upswing in LPs, for the most part its all very limited releases, which are pressed and repressed again and again, in low qty runs, and being sold at unbelievably high to outrageous prices. Its “milking the Scene” for the most part in my opinion, and I find it offensive.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I’m an LP collector and have been since 1981, and I do still love a cool LP. But I don’t think a Mercyful Fate 9th run repress LP should be sold for $52.99 or some shit.\n\nWe’ve done many LP’s in the past, and also work with several license partners to issue many of our classics on LP through the years.\n\nWe are also planning to make LPs once more for Many of our larger 2024 planed new releases like new CARNAL SAVAGERY “Into The Abysmal Void”, LUCIFERIAN RITES “Oath of Midnight Ashes”, FerreTT “Glamdemic” and others \\m/.\n\nBut CDs are more important for us. Digital is as well, but only due to the changes in the industry…. The entire underground scene was much cooler and better off pre-internet in my opinion.\n\nA few pics from Moribund Offices:\n\nDo you find that most of the Moribund audience are listening to the bands on streaming services or CDs?\n\nLuckily most of our audience are old-school and die hard metal LIFERS. So they prefer real physical formats over digital and streaming. If the scene ever stops buying physical product then its all over. There will be no big name bands or bands big enough to do sustainable tours etc. There will be no labels, and no one to nurture New Talent.\n\nWe’ll ALL be stuck sifting through 10’s of thousands of 3rd and 4rth generation bad clone bands of the classics trying to find something that’s worth listening to.\n\nHow about for you personally? How do you usually listen to music?\n\nMostly on CD, sometimes Vinyl or my old Cassette Demo’s, and lastly digital stuff on my phone or laptop if I’m on the road and prior formats are not available.\n\nWith being so busy running the label, do you find time or bother listening to many new releases that come out on other labels or are you mostly listening to your old favs and the new releases that come out on Moribund?\n\nYes, daily! I still love discovering new bands and listen to new stuff all the time. We also get an average of 10-30 promo packs and EPK’s here daily, so I hear / listen to lots of new unsigned bands almost daily as well.\n\nThat said, I do have a complete bias towards Moribund Records bands and releases, as well as my many favorite classics from the 1980’s – 2000’s.\n\nCan you name your top 5 metal albums that captivated you as a kid and still blow you away today?\n\nThese pick or name your fave albums are always so hard :P. I could list so many 80’s Metal and Thrash bands, from Judas Priest to Bathory and Destruction to Mystifier to Masters Hammer… but I’ll give you 5 which had a profound impact on me:\n\nKISS “Love Gun” – this is the album that got me into music when I was 7. May not count as “Metal” by todays standards, but it was some heavy kick-ass shit in 1977!\n\nDIO “Holy Diver” – Dio was and IS a God amongst mortal Men. ‘Nuff said!\n\nMERCYFUL FATE “Melissa” – I bought this new when it came out when I was 13, and this album literally changed my life. This is what made me want to work in the music industry, as well as what first got me interested in the occult, Satanism, Paganism etc.\n\nAUTOPSY “Mental Funeral” + IMPETIGO “Horror of the Zombies” – A tie here. Both were early Death Metal albums which pushed the limits on extreme in both sound and lyrics. I embraced DM in its very early demo stage, but these two albums were just so “Gloopy” and gross, and extreme, and I love every minute of ‘em!\n\nBURZUM – “Aske” + “Burzum” – Another album (well, and EP), which literally changed my life. I heard both almost a year before they were actually released as I used to write and tape trade with Varg. We were also the 1st people to sell releases (as well as most 1990’s 1st wave Black Meta;) both in the USA. It was just soo extreme yet so simple, but most of all completely mesmerizing and captivating. It set a high mark for the 2nd gen of black metal sound which most today still cant touch or beat! Love or hate Varg for his “politics” as you wish, but his early albums remain untouchable and at the top tier of Black Metal history!\n\nAlso, can you name your top 5 metal albums from the past 5 years that you loved?\n\nAgain, soo hard to pick, and afterwards I always remember some other wicked album I should have included…. But here are 5 Non-Moribund releases AND 5 (sorta!) Moribund Records releases:\n\nRUDRA “Eight Mahavidyas”\n\nSAVAGE MASTER “Myth, Magic and Steel”\n\nARMAGEDDA “Svindeldjup Ättestup”\n\nCIRITH UNGOL “Forever Black”\n\nGUT “Disciples Of Smut”\n\n+ am honorable mention = DAWN OF WINTER “Pray for Doom”\n\nMoribund Records Releases:\n\nSATAN’S HOST “This Legacy Will Never Die” + MALAMORTE “Omen” (tie for #1!)\n\nCARNAL SAVAGERY “Scent of Death”\n\nOLTRETOMBA “THE HORROR – Figure del Terrore” + UNHUMAN DISEASE “Into Satan’s Kingdom +Bonus” Re-issue (Tie for best Black Metal)\n\nLIGHTCRUSHER “Constructing Stairs of Mortared Bone” + ADVERSVM “Vama Marga” (Tie for best DOOM!)\n\nCATEGORY VI “Firecry” + ANTIPOPE “Rex Mundi” (Tie for best Epic/True Metal)\n\nIf you listen to music, outside of metal (I know you recently went to see Blondie hehe), what are your top 5 non-metal bands that you enjoy?\n\nWhile my musical diet is probably 95%+ Metal for Breakfast, Lunch and Diner, I do enjoy most other genre’s of music… Except for Modern Pop music, hip-hop and acid / free-form jazz. Below are my fave non-Metal genre’s and one of my fave artist for each!\n\n1. THE MOON LAY HIDDEN BENEATH A CLOUD – The Greatest non-Metal band in the history of music, period! They are a unique mix of Medieval, Ambient, Ritual, Euro Pagan, Darkwave and Martial music.\n\n2. Spaghetti Western – specifically anything Ennio Morricone, but there are many other great artist within this interesting sub-genre.\n\n3. BUDDY HOLLY + HOWLIN’ WOLF – A Tie. I’m a big fan of the early Rock-N-Roll and Blues era of the Devils music!\n\n4. BLUE OYSTER CULT – While I despise most “Hippie” Rock of the 60’s / 70’s, I do Love B.O.C., and several other (mostly female fronted) rock bands, like Blondie, Pat Benatar, Fleetood Mac, Heart….\n\n5. CONAN Soundtrack. – I’m a big Movie Score Soundtrack fan, love stuff like The Omen and anything Bernard Herrmann..\n\n+ am honorable mention = N.W.A.\n\nIs the label more of a “passion project” for you or is this your “job”?\n\nIt’s a total Passion while also being my full time job since 1996. The day that I no longer have passion for the music and the label and our Artist’s is the day I’ll quit and go be an Astro-physicist or an applied sciences Quantum physicist!\n\nWhere do you plan to take the label in the next 5-10 years?\n\nTOTAL GLOBAL METAL DOMINATION!!! Ha, ha! We plan to continue as we have been, slowly growing, continuing to expand our roster, and our reach for all the bands on the label!\n\nA lot of bands have been on, and are currently on, the label. What releases have been the most successful from your perspective? That could either be from a financial view, or just from a musical standpoint.\n\nA very hard question, as each album is personal and has a place in my heart…. And while sales are important to keep things running and to be able to provide budgets for the bands etc., its much more about releasing great albums than success or money for me…\n\nBut here are some albums which I think had a very strong impact on the scene, the time/era, myself personally and in the hearts and minds of many young Metalheads through the years =\n\nJUDAS ISCARIOT “The Cold Earth Slept Below…”\n\nACHERON “Anti-god, Anti-christ”\n\nWIND OF THE BLACK MOUNTAINS “Sing Thou Unholy Servants”\n\nWINDHAM HELL “Reflective Depths Imbibe”\n\nTHY INFERNAL “Warlords Of Hell”\n\nFORNICATOR “Fornicator”\n\nSARGEIST “Satanic Black Devotion” CD\n\nCRAFT “Terror Propaganda- Second Black Metal Attack”\n\nBLOOD RITUAL “Black Grimoire”\n\nSATAN’S HOST “Great American Scapegoat 666” + SATAN’S HOST “By The Hands Of The Devil”\n\nHRIZG “Anthems To Decrepitude”\n\nTHRALL “Vermin To The Earth”\n\nABHOR “Ritualia Stramonium”\n\nLUCIFERIAN RITES “When The Light Dies”\n\nPROFEZIA “Dodekaprofeton”\n\nHILDR VALKYRIE “Revealing The Heathen Sun”\n\nCARNAL SAVAGERY “Scent of Death”\n\nONWARD “Of Epoch and Inferno”\n\nWhat has been the biggest change you’ve witnessed over the 30 years aside from the decline in physical media sales?\n\nThat’s a hard one, as so many things have changed through the last 3 decades.\n\nI think the largest one is how you promote music. The modern digital era has drastically changed that…. And while most think its probably for the better I feel it is not. Mags, Radio, Labels etc gets inundated with EPK’s / digital promo’s to the point its impossible to keep up. And most bands don’t put any effort into it. The ld days where a band had to put a pack together with a presentation of what they’re about was much better and received lots more attention.\n\nWhat have been the more positive changes you’ve noticed in the industry since you started?\n\nProbably the #1 thing is that the “Industry” itself sorta takes metal seriously, because some of the top bands actually sell enough to catch the interest of Majors.\n\nOne more is the number of quality bands. While there has always been incredible bands from each sub-genre of Metal…. There was 1,000 more horrible ones for each good / sign-able band. Today, we get more promo’s from incredible bands than we could possibly sign.\n\nAnother major change, is that while there are more sub-genres of Metal than ever before, the average Metal Fan is not limited to just 1 sub-genre, like only listening to Thrash or to Black Metal. It’s very cool to see the majority of the scene embrace all forms of Extreme Metal.\n\nThanks for your time for this interview!
