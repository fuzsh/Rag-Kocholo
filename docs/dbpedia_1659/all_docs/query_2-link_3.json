        "text": "American horn section\n\nThe Memphis Horns was an American horn section, made famous by their many appearances on Stax Records. The duo consisted of Wayne Jackson on trumpet and Andrew Love on tenor saxophone. An \"offshoot of the Mar-Keys\", they continued to work together for over 30 years.[1] They lent their sound to 83 gold and platinum awards and over one hundred high-charting records, including Otis Redding's \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\", Al Green's \"Let's Stay Together\", and Elvis Presley's \"Suspicious Minds\".[2]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nFormation\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore the formation of the Memphis Horns, the co-founders worked in other projects.[2] Jackson, while in high school, was a member of the Mar-Keys, a group that would become part of the house band for Stax Records during the 1960s.[3] Meanwhile, Love was playing the saxophone in his father's church, and his school bands. He joined the house band in 1965, after completing his post secondary education in music.[4] Upon Love's entry, the two met formally and clicked quickly, as they had heard, and heard of, each other in clubs before.[2]\n\nIn addition to recording at Stax, the duo were also working sessions at Royal Studio and American Sound Studio in Memphis, at Atlantic Records in New York, and at FAME Studio in Muscle Shoals. In 1969, after being asked to work exclusively at Stax, Jackson and Love declined and incorporated as The Memphis Horns to continue offering their signature sound to all who needed it.[4]\n\nRecording history\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Memphis Horns appeared on nearly every recording for Stax that included a horn section — with Isaac Hayes, Otis Redding, Rufus Thomas, Sam and Dave and others — as well as on other releases, including The Doobie Brothers' What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits and U2's Rattle and Hum, as well as a few solo records.[5]\n\nIn the 1970s, they recorded with Al Green, Aretha Franklin, Rod Stewart, James Taylor, Joe Tex, Neil Diamond, Mike Harrison, Don Harrison Band, and Stephen Stills.[2][4] They toured with Stills in 1971 and The Doobie Brothers from 1973 to 1976. In the 1980s, they recorded with Jimmy Buffett, Willie Nelson, Hank Williams, Steve Winwood, Robert Cray and many others.[4] They toured with Jimmy Buffett for three years and one year with Joe Cocker. In the late 1980s and 1990s, Jackson and Love worked extensively with the blues outfit, The Robert Cray Band. They provided their trademark funky/soul horns backing to five of the band's albums: Strong Persuader (1986); Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (1988); Midnight Stroll (1990); I Was Warned (1992); Sweet Potato Pie (1997).\n\nIn 1992, they released their own album Flame Out, produced by fellow Stax alumnus Terry Manning.\n\nFollowing the retirement of Love in 2004, Jackson recruited Tom McGinley, a baritone sax player, to continue to record on projects such as Neil Young's Prairie Wind (2005).\n\nIn 2007, Jackson reunited with former longtime member Jack Hale, also including McGinley, in order to join a supergroup backing singer-songwriter Andrew Jon Thomson, on his \"All Star Superband\" multi-album project. In 2008, this line-up played on some songs on the Raconteurs record, Consolers of the Lonely. The same year the Memphis Horns recorded with Jack White (White Stripes, the Raconteurs) and Alicia Keys on the song \"Another Way to Die\", for the 22nd James Bond movie, Quantum of Solace.\n\nLegacy and awards\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2008, the Memphis Horns were inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, TN.[3] In 2012, the Memphis Horns received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award for outstanding artistic significance in music, and in 2017, the duo was inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame.[2]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Memphis Horns (1970)\n\nHorns for Everything (1972)\n\nHigh On Music (1976)\n\nGet Up and Dance (1977)\n\nThe Memphis Horns Band II (1978)\n\nWelcome to Memphis (1979)\n\nFlame Out (1992)\n\nThe Memphis Horns with Special Guests (1995)\n\nWishing You a Merry Christmas (1996)\n\nSelected list of albums on which the Memphis Horns appeared\n\n[edit]\n\nWhat Were Once Vices Are Now Habits (1974) – The Doobie Brothers\n\nTakin' It to the Streets (1976) – The Doobie Brothers\n\nSo (1986) – Peter Gabriel\n\nStrong Persuader (1986) – Robert Cray\n\nDon't Be Afraid of the Dark (1988) – Robert Cray\n\nRattle and Hum (1988) – U2\n\nElio Samaga Hukapan Kariyana Turu (1989) – Elio e le Storie Tese\n\nMidnight Stroll (1990) – Robert Cray\n\nI Was Warned (1992) – Robert Cray\n\nSweet Potato Pie (1997) – Robert Cray\n\nBird Nest on the Ground (2012) – Doyle Bramhall\n\nList of members\n\n[edit]\n\nWayne Jackson – trumpet\n\nAndrew Love – tenor saxophone\n\nFloyd Newman – baritone saxophone\n\nLewis Collins – saxophone, flute\n\nJack Hale – trombone\n\nJack Hale, Jr. – trumpet, french horn (born in 1955, in Memphis, Tennessee)\n\nEd Logan – tenor saxophone (born Edward Logan, 12 February 1945, in Memphis, Tennessee, died 13 April 2000, in Mobile, Alabama)\n\nJames Mitchell – baritone saxophone (1931–2000, in Ashland, Mississippi)\n\nBen Cauley – trumpet\n\nRoger Hopps – trumpet\n\nJoe Arnold – saxophone\n\nCalvin Caples – baritone saxophone\n\nPacky Axton – saxophone\n\nSelected recordings\n\n[edit]\n\n1965\n\n[edit]\n\nArtist Song title Date US charts R&B charts UK charts Notes Wilson Pickett \"In the Midnight Hour\" May 12, 1965 21 1 12 date is date recorded Wilson Pickett \"634-5789 (Soulsville, U.S.A.)\" December 20, 1965 13 1 36 date is date recorded\n\n1966\n\n[edit]\n\nArtist Song title Date US charts R&B charts UK charts Notes Wilson Pickett \"Land of a Thousand Dances\" May 8–11, 1966 6 1 22 date is date recorded Wilson Pickett \"Mustang Sally\" October 13, 1966 23 6 28 date is date recorded\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
