        "text": "Iron Maiden - Fear of the Dark (1992)\n\nToday we commemorate the final passing of Iron Maiden, some thirty years on from them being so cruelly taken from us by whatever it was they morphed into thereafter. I know that quality was waning on the previous release, but the fact is that No Prayer for the Dying and Fear of the Dark where both important albums for me as a youth, being the first two new albums from a band I had discovered via someone else's vinyl collection to date back in 1989 that I could go out and buy and discover at the\n\nIron Maiden - \"The Number of the Beast\" (1982)\n\nWhen this album was released I was nearly six years old. When I got my grubby little mitts on it some seven or eight years later I thought at the time that it was an \"old\" metal album. Given that the album has been around now nearly as long as I have it seemed a perfect entry to remind us all as metal fans of our ever decreasing spiral on this mortal coil. To start on a negative note, ‘Invaders’ just might be one of the worst album openers of all time. Couple this track with ‘Gangland’ and y\n\nW.A.S.P. - \"Inside The Electric Circus\" (1986)\n\nW.A.S.P.’s third full-length was probably one of the first ten records I bought with my own money. Drawn by the promise of the obtuse and gory nature of the band, the sleazy album cover proved too much to resist, even if I found the content a lot less shocking than I had hoped it would be. It is hard to believe that this album is thirty-five-years old this week. I was ten years old when this came out and probably not even aware of its existence until I was thirteen perhaps even fourteen. Ba\n\nGorguts - Full Length Discography Review (1991 - 2016)\n\n1991 – Considered Dead – R/C Records It is hard to remember Gorguts as anything other than boundary pushing, avant-grade and unique purveyors of some of the most challenging music out there. But everybody has to start somewhere and their debut was a straight up death metal record. No evidence was shown in 1991 of much of anything in the way of technicality with the focus instead being on the release of the familiar sound that was infecting much of the metal world in the early nineties.\n\nMacabreEternal in Discogs\n\nAugust 9, 2020\n\nKreator - 80's Releases (Full-Length only)\n\n***This artilce was originally written for my blog back in 2017*** In comparison to most I am relatively late to the Kreator party. One of the first digital albums I ever bought when settling back into metal after a brief hiatus some 12 years ago was \"Pleasure To Kill\" and I have spent many a neck snapping evening in its company since, but only over the past 18 months or so have I developed my exploration of the discography further than the excellent 1986 sophomore release. Furthermore, I\n\nMacabreEternal\n\nMay 31, 2020\n\nUlcerate \"Stare Into Death And Be Still\"\n\nIt is no secret by now that I have a lot ( i mean a fucking lot) of time for Ulcerate. I have been listening to metal for over 30 years now and I am sadly at a time now were very little excites me in the way of new releases. I have over-indulged in the past, trying to consume as many new releases as possible in a given year and just ended up stuffed with underwhelming music that makes no impact on what little hunger of mine still remains for the pursuit of new releases. If I look at the music\n\nMacabreEternal\n\nMay 9, 2020\n\nObsequiae - The Palms Of Sorrowed Kings\n\nObsequiae established a very well-defined style on their first record, and they've stuck with it ever since. The Palms Of Sorrowed Kings is their third album, and much like the second one, it offers subtle refinements and expansions of their sound, but no big surprises. If you haven't heard them, it's a great place to start; if you have, you know what to expect. That's not a bad thing at all. If you like what they do, you'll like this album. It's chock full of flowing, triumphant medieval-E\n\nFatherAlabaster\n\nNovember 22, 2019\n\nMizmor \"Cairn\"\n\nUp until two weeks ago, I hadn't even heard of Mizmor. One look at that cover and I had this record in my ears within thirty seconds. Good album artwork should pull you into a record, give some promise of what lies beneath but then also not give everything away. The songwriting, like the artwork, follows this thesis perfectly. I have listened to this everyday since discovery and I am still learning more and more about it. 'Desert of Absurdity' sets the tone perfectly with its acoustic p\n\nMacabreEternal\n\nSeptember 15, 2019\n\nSacred Reich \"Awakening\"\n\nWhichever tier of thrash metal you consigned Sacred Reich back in the 80's/90's they still had their moments. \"Ignorance\" & \"Surf Nicaragura\" did a great job of establishing the band, whereas \"The American Way\" just got a little too comfortable and accessible (the title track grates nowadays) for my ears. A couple more records better left forgotten about and then nothing for twenty three years. 2019 alone has now seen three releases from Phil Rind and co. A live EP, a split EP with Iron\n\nMacabreEternal\n\nAugust 26, 2019\n\nMemoriam \"Requiem For Mankind\"\n\nOkay, I am going to be honest. This is my first taste of Memoriam, albeit the release that is purportedly their best; according to the internet at least. Things start well, on the riffing front at least. 'Shell Shock' motors like a fucking tank, being driven with precision through its destructive and relentless path. Similiarly, 'Undefeated' with it's groovy as fuck riff and chopping rhythm continues in a full on attack of the senses. The sophistication and poise both come up a couple of no\n\nMacabreEternal\n\nJuly 21, 2019\n\nImmortal Bird \"Thrive on Neglect\"\n\nImmortal Bird have been on my radar for some time now. Having thoroughly enjoyed their debut full length of 2015, 'Empress/Abscess' (and their debut EP - 'Akrasia' some 2 years earlier) I have been eager to see what their sophomore full length would offer. The label I commonly see applied to the band is of a \"blackened crust/sludge metal\" description which whilst accurate for the fledgling part of their career does not by any means cover the plethora of styles, genres and sounds explored on 'T\n\nMacabreEternal\n\nJuly 6, 2019\n\nEssential Finnish BM Releases - Impaled Nazarene \"Tol Cormpt Norz Norz Norz\" (1993)\n\nCould any list of 'essential' FInnish BM releases be complete without the first full length venture of Impaled Nazarene present? Not that this is an easy listen by any means, even for the most extreme-loving metalhead, 'Tol...' is a full on assault that takes some unpicking before you can recognise the dexterity behind the slashes and blows it deals. Upon first hearing this some five years ago, I immediately dismissed it. Not because of the sound but more due to the structure of the albu\n\nMacabreEternal\n\nApril 4, 2019\n\nThe Fallen Ones\n\n@BlutAusNerd @Iceni @NTNR @Midi @Frostaudn @jfk36 @Black Milk @SBird94 @~Mere~ @mindy6158 @Ghouly @forge @salmonellapancake @Thrashman @Skull_Kollektor @Ikard\n\nMacabreEternal\n\nApril 4, 2019\n\nVltimas 'Something Wicked Marches In'\n\n2019 is slowly unveiling some fine releases. With Altarage, Overkill and Candlemass all making me grin thus far in the past three months, despite a slow start and some disappointments (Venom, Queensryche and Legion of the Damned). Naturally, your ears prick up when you hear Flo Mounier, Rune Eriksen and David Vincent have decided to get together and make some unholy communion. Straight away I thought we had potential AOTY material right here given the obvious talent and experience present on\n\nMacabreEternal\n\nApril 3, 2019\n\nEssential Finnish BM Releases - Förgjord \"Ajasta Ikuisuuteen\" (2008)\n\nAfter a few changes of band name, Valgrinder and Prokrustes Thanatos eventually settled on the name Förgjord (Swedish for 'destroyed') and since 2001 have been releasing demos, compilations, full lengths and splits. \"Ajasta Ikuisuuteen\" was the debut full length release from 2008 on Hammer of Hate Records and is probably not a record you would hear discussed in the same pages as releases from Horna, Behexen or Beherit. The most prominent factor in the sound of \"Ajasta Ikuisuuteen\" is its b\n\nMacabreEternal\n\nMarch 15, 2019\n\nEssential Finnish BM Releases - Horna/Behexen split EP - (2004)\n\nThe first entry in this new blog section celebrating the Finnish BM scene is dedicated to one of the finest split releases I have ever heard. In July 2004, Grievantee Productions released this split EP from two of the most established and revered acts on the BM scene in Finland. A split of real contrast, this offering gave two sides of the coin in every aspect. The lo-fi production of Horna with the shrieking vocals of Corvus at the front of the delivery giving marked difference to the scathi\n\nMacabreEternal\n\nMarch 3, 2019\n\nCandlemass \"The Door to Doom\"\n\nTwo reviews in one weekend? All work and no play makes Macca a dull boy! Wait a minute...not when I am reviewing top notch releases such as the latest from Overkill and Candlemass. I mean it is like I fell asleep on Thursday night and woke up in the eighties on Friday morning. Like Overkill, the Swedish doom legends are enjoying a new lease of life, this time in the form of Johan Languist (yes,him) who returns to the band after a 32 year gap to ingratiate the memories of anyone with a copy o\n\nMacabreEternal\n\nFebruary 24, 2019\n\noverkill Overkill \"The Wings of War\"\n\nFull length number 19 from overkill certainly makes a splash in the energy stakes, I mean there's some modern thrash bands that are a good two decades younger than Overkill who can only hope to achieve the levels of spunk that New Jersey's finest produce here. That in itself is an achievement, for a band of Overkill's stature and reputation to be able to still sound relevant four decades into their career is no mean feat. Even in the albums weaker moments it never gets redundant and the energy\n\nMacabreEternal\n\nFebruary 23, 2019\n\nRotting Christ \"The Heretics\"\n\nLast Rotting Christ album I enjoyed? \"Triarchy of Lost Lovers\". Last Rotting Christ album I bothered to listen to upon release? \"Aealo\". It is fair to say that the Greek stalwarts of the Black Metal scene now have a sound that rarely ventures into the territory so well tread on \"Thy Mighty Contract\" and \"Non Serviam\" but it is also fair to say that \"The Heretics\" sounds from start to finish like a band who firmly stamp themselves on the metal map for 2019.

A quick look on the internet tells me that Windswept are Drudkh minus keyboards in terms of members. Therefore Windswept is just a less atmospheric version of Drudkh? That's not really a question as I have heard \"The Onlooker\" and I know it is in fact a statement of truth. I don't get it. If I want to hear a Drudkh record I will just put one on.

Usually when I review such a release I find myself typing \"doesn't reinvent the wheel but does the genre justice with this solid offering\" or words to that effect. Ossuarium's debut full length falls under that banner most definitely. Nobody is fucking around here with a saxophone to make the offering standout with some eclectic and unnecessary deviation from tradition.

As far back as three years ago when Altarage dropped their debut full length 'Nihl', this scribe could already hear the threat of their ability, feel the menace of their presence from over hills far away and sense the nefarious intent as the raw fury howled over my skin. Sophomore effort 'Endinghent' further cemented the prowess of these blackened death metal Basque country residents.

In terms of original members only Phil Fasciana remains in the ranks of Malevolent Creation now and after the passing of Brett Hoffman last year you could almost forgive fans for thinking the curtain had fallen on Malevolent Creation. The fact is that whilst \"The 13th Beast\" reinvents no wheels it does exhibit the sound of a band in the throes of something of a regeneration phase. There's nothing tired sounding here, no dull interludes to build unnece\n\nMacabreEternal\n\nJanuary 21, 2019"
