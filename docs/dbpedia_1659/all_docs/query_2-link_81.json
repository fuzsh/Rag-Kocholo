        "text": "You’re a composer or a producer. You need horns arranged and played on your pop/funk/soul/R&B track. What do you do?\n\nThere are three options:\n\nHire a horn player/section. They’ll usually do the arrangement for you too.\n\nHire an arranger.\n\nDo it yourself.\n\nIn most professional circles when producers or composers need horns they’ll book a horn player or section. That player will then fix (hire) the horns and write/arrange the chart themselves.\n\nSometimes, a dedicated arranger is called upon to write the charts. This can add more to the cost but might add an extra pair of experienced ears to your track.\n\nThe final option is to do it yourself. That’s what this whole article is here to help with.\n\nStuff You Should Know First\n\nIf you haven’t already, you should check out my articles on jazz harmony, voicings and horn ranges so this will all make sense. I’ll recap them a little as we go here, but having a good understanding of the principles will help a lot.\n\nYou’ll also need a basic knowledge of transposing instruments and notation. Transcribing and listening to a lot of horn arrangements helps immensely here too, especially if you’re not a horn player yourself.\n\nTHE HORN SECTION\n\nBefore we begin, I need to tell you a secret.\n\nWhen we see classic horn line-ups on stage we often see 3 or 4 players. Usually a trumpet, sax and trombone with one player tastefully wearing a fedora or flatcap. This is a great sound live. Live sound gets muddied up easily and 3 or 4 horns are enough to give us the punch we need.\n\nIf you’ve ever recorded a horn section with great players, great mics in a great room, and then put them in the mix, you might have been disappointed with what might have been quite a thin sound. This is the same problem with sampled horns. Assuming this isn’t the sound you’re after, you might have tried to battle this with bus compression, EQ and saturation but the problem is often an arranging one - not a production one.\n\nThe truth is, in the studio, we rarely use just the sound of 3 or 4 horns. There are a few things that are very different to arranging studio horns:\n\nWe overdub an extra trumpet. The classic sound you hear on Michael Jackson, Earth, Wind & Fire and Stevie Wonder records is usually 2 trumpets, tenor sax and trombone. If you only have 3 horns, another trumpet part overdubbed makes all the difference for a bright, cutting sound.\n\nWe double the whole section. A bit like doubling a pop singer and hiding the double in the mix to add extra weight, we often track the whole section twice (or more) playing the same thing for weight and power. With 2 trumpets, 1 sax and 1 trombone, doubling the section gives us 4 trumpets for 2 saxes and 2 trombones - a very bright, powerful sound.\n\nWe add notes to chords. In a live setting, we only have three parts, in the studio we have unlimited potential parts (which is not always a good thing!). We frequently overdub 2 or 3 extra chord tones to fill out big chords and sections.\n\nThe players always play very intensely. The horns get pushed back in a mix so for a great sound, you need your horn players to play nothing less than loud and powerfully all the time.\n\nI realise that last statement comes off as a bit unmusical, but unless everything is exaggerated - articulations, vibrato, note length etc. - you get a lifeless performance when put in the mix.\n\nLegendary horn section arranger and trumpeter Jerry Hey has arranged and played for pretty much everyone from Earth, Wind and Fire to Dirty Loops. He pretty much defined the sound we’re talking about. His sound is characteristically trumpet-heavy. It’s brighter when compared to the usual trumpet, sax and trombone layout. To get this kind of sound in the studio, overdubbing or booking more trumpet players is a must.\n\nA good thing to remember when recording horns is: ‘a whisper turned up is still a whisper; a yell turned down is still a yell’. The attitude and character the musicians play with translates across the whole track.\n\nAssuming the room, players and mics are great, if we do these three things - overdub the trumpet, add extra notes in chords and have the players perform loud and intensely - you’ll get a sound like the classic records.\n\nAll this being said, that means we have to change our arranging based on whether the chart is to be played live or is being recorded. Just something to bear in mind as we continue.\n\nLINE-UP\n\nThere are a few options when it comes to the exact section you want to use.\n\nAs for score layout, the players will just be given their parts (the ‘dots’) and no full score is needed, especially in informal settings. If there is a score, maybe for the arranger or producer, the horns aren’t in the same order as a big band. They still appear above the rhythm section but generally go in pitch order instead. Here are some typical horn line-ups for songs (in score order):\n\nClose position voicings are great for hits and stabs while drop-2 voicings are great at providing clarity and power in pushes and cascades. Ultimately, most voicing decisions will be decided by voice-leading, instrument range and balance.\n\nTo repeat myself, the most important thing is keeping each instrument in a comfortable range and giving them logical and satisfying lines to play.\n\nIf you follow this guideline, then the type of voicing to use is determined by the context. Any balance and voicing issues then usually sort themselves out.\n\nIf you check out the example above, you’ll notice that the trombone actually goes above the tenor sax in bars 9 and 10. Some trombonists prefer playing above the sax as they can play strongly in this upper register and the tenor still sounds great that low. Again, it’s all about writing in a comfortable range for each individual player, even though the parts cross.\n\nWhen using chords, be careful of two things:\n\nDissonant intervals between the outside voices. The horns should feel complete in themselves. If you have a dissonant interval, like a minor 9th or tritone between your lowest and highest horn, it won’t sound great.\n\nResolving chords properly. This is an extension of my advice on voice leading. Make sure that all parts follow logical resolutions and voice leading. Sing/play through each part for awkward leaps and uncomfortable intervals. Each line should be great on its own.\n\nOmitting Notes\n\nWriting in three parts is much harder than four or more. In three-part writing, when you have a four-note chord like a Cmaj7, you have to leave out a note. In the studio, you could keep it in, but live you don’t have a choice.\n\nThe 5th is usually the first note to go as the chord still has it’s full quality. When we just have 1 3 and 7 in chord, this is called a ‘shell voicing’. The root can also go sometimes in favour of more interesting notes if needed.\n\nDon’t forget that you can also substitute notes of a chord. The root can usually be exchanged for the 9th for instance. A full table of substitutions based on chord quality and chord tone can be found in my article on jazz harmony here.\n\nOf course, if the option and budget is there - I’d always recommend 4 horn players to avoid having to deal with this all together.\n\nPADS\n\nOne of the hardest things to arrange in my opinion are pads and beds with small horn sections. These happen especially in softer songs and it’s very easy to make the parts rhythmically boring. Getting the lush sound of a full band is also very hard with limited horns. It’s a bit like writing for string quartet rather than string orchestra - the colour of the ensemble completely changes into something more direct and is much thinner in small horn sections.\n\nPads can be arranged in close position, drop-2 or spreads and warm intervals like 10ths between the bass and middle voice work well. Be sure to keep each instrument in a warm register - usually on the stave (but at the upper end of the stave for trombone). A bari sax playing the bottom line down the octave is very common - wider intervals in the bass aren’t a problem and the bari sounds best on the stave or just below.\n\nHere’s a simple example of 2 flugels and 2 trombones playing spread chords. This could have easily been 2 flugels, tenor sax and trombone, or with a bari too:\n\n2. Add phrasing.\n\nThis is one of the most important stages. I’ve now got my top horn line written down. I then try to match the phrasing exactly as I heard it in my head while also having it match the track. I’m doing this by making sure rhythms are accurate to the track, and articulations are doing exactly what I want then to. I’m listening for very specific things:\n\nWhen do notes start and end? Especially the bass groove that the horns will be matching. Also, the organ part in bar 8 finishes very specifically on beat 3, so the horns will have to match this.\n\nLong and short notes. The articulations have to match what is already going on for the horns to feel good.\n\nIf I have the session files, I’ll go into the MIDI here and see exactly how long the bass and organ phrases last. I’ll then decide how best to translate these to a horn section in notation.\n\n3. Fill out the other horn parts\n\nI’ve decided to go with 2 trumpets, tenor sax and trombone for a bright, powerful sound. I also added an alto sax overdub for extra brightness. I’ve added the other 3 horns to the line now mostly in unison and octaves giving them the strongest range possible to play in.\n\nAs for harmony, I’ve used simple 3rds to begin with and then big chords in the pushes. (I’ve purposely tried to cram in as many voicing techniques as possible to show you what’s possible but a more simple approach would have easily worked here too.)\n\n4. Record the horns\n\nThe next stage is tracking the horns. In a professional environment, you’re looking at a medium-size room.\n\nIn a pro studio, you’d expect to use Royer ribbon mics or Neumann U87, U47s or U67s. 67’s are the favourite of many LA sax players and 47’s, if you can afford them, are great for a classic LA trumpet sound. On a budget, any decent condenser will usually do - it’s the player that matters more.\n\nIn this example, I actually had the trumpets recorded remotely by Graeme from his own studio, I recorded saxes in my studio and Patrick tracked trombones from his studio too. I got the trumpet stems first and we phrased/tuned to them.\n\nWhen tracking remotely or overdubbing separately, the order that you layer up the horns is really important. If this was an orchetsral context and we had strings for example, we’d want to start with the lower strings (basses and cellos) so the upper strings can tune to them.\n\nThe opposite is true in horn sections. We want to track the trumpet first. As the leader of the section, they’ll decide the phrasing and tuning. Everyone else can match them. It’s more difficult for them to determine phrasing and style if they have to match pre-recorded horns.\n\nI asked for each player to double their part so we’d have the entire section doubled for a big sound, being careful to match the phrasing exactly the same so it all works together. In the double, I switched from tenor to alto and re-wrote the sax part a little, putting things up the octave to give support to the trumpet and add extra notes in the crunchy Ab7 and Bb7 chords.\n\n5. Mix the horns\n\nI won’t pretend to be a mixing engineer, but like most people nowadays, we usually have to wear a few different hats. Of course, the approach to mixing the horns changes with every track and context but I find when everything is recorded well, I find myself reaching for these tools most often:\n\nEQ. High passing the lowest frequencies is always a must to remove mud. We work with at least 8 stems and the low-end noise builds up. I usually reach for subtle EQ on individual horns or linear phase EQ on the horn bus which can help remove annoying frequencies or add brightness/warmth.\n\nCompression. Subtle compression used as ‘glue’ is a common feature on my horn bus. I don’t push it too hard and usually use the SSL bus compressor at a 4:1 ratio doing about 3-4db of gain reduction. The attack is usually quite late - around 10 or 30ms - to ensure the bite and attack of the horns remains. I find it best to go into each horn part individually and control the level of notes that stick out using automation (especially high trumpet) before it hits a compressor.\n\nSaturation. Tape saturators and exciters can give the horn section a warm, cohesive sound and a little goes a long way.\n\nOn the final horn bus there might also be some reverb and limiting but this is all context dependent. Horns are easy to over-mix and start to sound fake.\n\nHere are the final horns in the mix with the final arrangement:"
