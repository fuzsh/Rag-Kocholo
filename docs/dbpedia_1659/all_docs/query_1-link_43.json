They emphasize class discussion and written work, which consists of either music or critical prose as appropriate to the topic. Open to all students, but particularly recommended for first-year students and sophomores. An introduction to music notation and to principles of musical organization, including scales, keys, rhythm and meter. Limited to beginners and those who did not place into MUS 110. Enrollment limited to 20. {A}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nMUS 101 World Music (4 Credits)\n\nMusic may not be a \"universal language,\" but it is a universal phenomenon; every culture has something that is recognized as music. This course introduce a number of musical systems--traditional, classical and popular--from around the world and uses case studies to explore the complex relationships between music and culture. By engaging with music analytically, as musicologists (paying attention to the sounds heard) and ethnographically, as anthropologists (paying attention to the cultural context), students learn basic principles that enhance their understanding of music globally speaking. No prerequisites. {A}{S}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nMUS 102 Making Music History (4 Credits)\n\nThis class is an introduction to music history that combines a close study of music from the Western classical tradition with research methodology and an orientation to the discipline of musicology. Organized by genres and concepts, the class looks at classical music as both a repertoire and an object of cultural study. In addition to covering a range of works, the course addresses their production, performance and reception through a study of their social and political context, and raises questions of power, representation and patronage. Students also examine their own ideas about the role of the artist, what it means to be a musician and the social future of this music. Students have the chance to do original research on a piece or topic of their choice and get a foundation in the College’s scholarly resources, especially the holdings at Josten Library and Special Collections. {A}{H}\n\nFall\n\nMUS 105 Roll Over Beethoven: A History of Rock (4 Credits)\n\nThis course provides a critical survey of rock music, tracing the music’s development from blues and blackface minstrelsy to heavy metal, grunge and techno. Emphasis throughout is placed upon understanding musical developments in the context of American race and gender relations and the politics of youth cultures in the U.S. Discussions include: Elvis Presley and American race relations; Jimi Hendrix and the blues; girl groups; the rise of arena rock; and the significance of the DJ in hip hop. Enrollment limited to 45. {A}{H}\n\nFall, Spring, Alternate Years\n\nMUS 110 Analysis and Repertory I (4 Credits)\n\nAn introduction to formal analysis and tonal harmony and a study of pieces in the standard repertory. Regular exercises in harmony. Prerequisites: ability to read standard notation in treble and bass clefs, including key signatures and time signatures and the ability to name intervals. (A placement test is given before the fall semester for incoming students.) One 50-minute ear training section required per week, in addition to classroom meetings. Enrollment limited to 20. {A}\n\nFall\n\nMUS 202 Thinking About Music (4 Credits)\n\nThis course explores different approaches to the study of music as a cultural phenomenon. The course considers basic questions, such as: Why is music so often at the center of one's most profound personal and social experiences? Why is music a fundamental means of connecting with one's lives, communities and the wider world? Through in-depth reading and in-class discussion, students study the institutions of music (concerts, recording studios) and the varied practices of music making (classical, popular, amateur, professional) in order to construct a picture of the musical worlds and to understand what they say about society. {A}{S}\n\nSpring\n\nMUS 205mp Colloquium: Topics in Popular Music-Metal and Punk: Rock History Out Loud (4 Credits)\n\nHeavy metal and punk rock have arguably been the definitive rock-and-roll styles of the post-1970 rock era. In this course, we explore metal and punk as interrelated musical genres, following their history and development and examining a range of social and musical issues along the way. Of particular importance will be the following: How and when did metal and punk emerge? What defines the two genres musically? What defines them socially? Taken together, how do they represent the changing status of rock music as a cultural and commercial form since 1970? Enrollment limited to 20. {A}{H}{S}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nMUS 205pp Colloquium: Topics in Popular Music-Producing Popular Music: The American Music Industry (4 Credits)\n\nDuring the past three decades, the music industry has undergone substantial, even radical changes. This class will focus on recent developments in the music industry, while reflecting on larger issues that have informed the making and selling of music. Among the primary questions we will consider are: how have new technologies affected the ways in which music is created, bought and sold? What relationship exists between \"live\" and \"recorded\" music in the way the music industry operates? How do legal definitions and struggles over intellectual property shape the practices of musicians and music corporations? What does it mean to work in the music industry, and to what extent should the creative labor of musicians be considered similar to or different from other types of labor? Enrollment limited to 20. {A}{S}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nMUS 210 Analysis and Repertory II (4 Credits)\n\nA continuation of MUS 110. One 50-minute musicianship section required per week, in addition to classroom meetings. Prerequisite: MUS 110 or equivalent. Enrollment limited to 18. {A}\n\nSpring\n\nMUS 217 Colloquium: Feminism and Music Theory (4 Credits)\n\nIn this course, students evaluate the assumptions and foundations of Western music theory, primarily under the critical guidance of feminist theory. Tonal theory is often a routine part of undergraduate music study. What are the goals and criteria of this kind of analysis? While critically examining Western music theory’s intellectual values, students develop approaches to analysis that are responsive, in a variety of ways, to queer, feminist and antiracist thought. Through readings and listening assignments, students consider various challenges to the fiction of objectivity in music analysis, including embodiment, subjecthood and identity, and the mediating force of language and concepts. Prerequisites: MUS 110. Enrollment limited to 18. (E) {A}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nMUS 218 Colloquium: Music and the Moving Body (4 Credits)\n\nThis course considers connections between human movement and music from the perspective of performance, analysis, history and cognition. Discussions include music and gesture, music performance, the role of the body in listening, and the co-constitutive relationship between music and dance. Students develop a deeper awareness of music’s fundamentally embodied nature and learn about a variety of different ways in which movement-music interaction has historically shaped artistic practices. Course readings address a range of different styles including Western classical music, modernist and avant garde music, Hip hop, pop, country, gospel, West African music, Salsa and Gamelan. Enrollment limited to 18. {A}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nMUS 220pb Topics in World Music-The Power of Black Music (4 Credits)\n\nThe course focuses on the musics of Africa and the African diaspora through the lens of ethnomusicology. Concentrating on selected countries, including Benin, Brazil, Cuba, Nigeria, South Africa, and the United States, it examines the musical performance of gender, race, ethnicity, and nationality and the role of music in social and political movements. The course examines the global dimensions and resonances of Africanist musical aesthetics as enabled historically and sustained through ongoing transatlantic exchanges between Africa and the African diaspora. The course also explores the issues of representation and identity in iconic works like Black Is King &amp; Lemonade by Beyoncé. Other topics include the adaptation of hip-hop in Africa and the phenomenal popularity of West African Afrobeats in the United States and globally. Workshops conducted by visiting professional musicians and discussions on the instructor's ethnographic research in West Africa, Brazil, Cuba, and the United States. Enrollment limited to 40. {A}{S}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nMUS 222 World Music Theories (4 Credits)\n\nEach musical tradition is best explained and understood by its own system of theory. This course introduces four musical traditions and their corresponding theories: Tuvan Throat Singing, Dagomba Dance Drumming, Javanese Gamelan and Hindustani classical music. Topics include theory fundamentals, listening methods, compositional approaches and aesthetics. Learning about these traditions will open doors to new modes of listening and to hearing familiar music in a brand new way.\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nMUS 230 Colloquium: Music and Democracy (4 Credits)\n\nHow have social justice movements used music to mobilize people to fight for equality and rights? How have anti-democratic movements used music for reactionary ends? What is the role of music in sustaining—or eroding—democracies? This class examines a range of U.S. and global case studies, including Black Lives Matter, the abortion wars, global protest movements, and music and urban redevelopment. Through the study of national anthems, resistance songs like “Fight the Power,” and by examining the sounds of protest itself, students practice critical listening and reflect on how sound and music can press for social change--for better or worse. Students look at the role of music in democratic processes, the importance of music for belonging and citizenship, and whether and how music itself is significant to political participation. Prerequisites: MUS 102 or MUS 202. Enrollment limited to 18. {A}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nMUS 231 Colloquium: From Goat Songs To Flash Mobs: Music and Theater (4 Credits)\n\nMusic and theatre are both time-based arts that involve bodies in motion in front of an audience. Though they may be considered separate disciplines, the full extent of what they share often makes them wonderfully indistinguishable. This course probes the intersections of music and theatre through a survey of genres, works, artists, and practitioners. While material covered will include clearly relevant genres such as musicals and opera, the focus will be on more difficult to categorize topics such as performance art, immersive theatre, and experimental music, in an open-minded examination of what makes this alliance so compelling. Enrollment limited to 20. {A}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nMUS 233 Intro to Composition (4 Credits)\n\nBasic techniques of composition, including melody, simple two-part writing and instrumentation.

(E) {A}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nMUS 241 Diction for Singers (2 Credits)\n\nIn this course, students learn to use the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) as an efficient tool to approach accuracy in lyric diction. Choral and solo singers must frequently perform music in languages that they do not speak, and therefore often struggle to sing with accurate pronunciation. IPA is a set of orthographic characters, almost entirely based on the Roman alphabet, that standardizes phonetics across most major languages. Prerequisite: MUS 952, MUS 953, or individual voice performance lessons must be taken concurrently. Enrollment limited to 20.\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nMUS 249/ REL 249 Colloquium: Islamic Popular Music (4 Credits)\n\nOffered as MUS 249 and REL 249. Music is a complex issue in many Islamic societies. There are tensions between those who believe that music has no place in Islam and try to prohibit it, those for whom it is a central component of mystical devotion, and those who tolerate it, albeit within well-defined parameters. The debate intensifies in the case of popular music, a core part of the self-identification of young people everywhere. Despite this, there is an amazing variety of vibrant popular music throughout the Islamic world. This course explores the religious debates over music and the rich musical tradition (including religious music) in Islam. Enrollment limited to 35. {A}{H}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nMUS 251 Divas, Queens and Spectacle: A History of Opera (4 Credits)\n\nThis course offers an introduction to opera from the 16th to the 21st centuries, with an emphasis on gender performance, virtuosity and the unique history of opera performance at Smith College. Earlier works include Monteverdi’s Orfeo, Handel’s Rodelinda, Mozart’s Marriage of Figaro and Verdi’s Aida, while more modern and contemporary operas include Strauss’s Salome and Kaija Saariaho’s L’Amour du Loin. {A}{H}\n\nFall, Spring, Alternate Years\n\nMUS 258/ ANT 258 Performing Culture (4 Credits)\n\nOffered as MUS 258 and ANT 258. This course analyzes cultural performances as sites for the expression and formation of social identity. Students study various performance genres such as rituals, festivals, parades, cultural shows, music, dance and theater. Topics include expressive culture as resistance; debates around authenticity and heritage; the performance of race, class and ethnic identities; the construction of national identity; and the effects of globalization on indigenous performances. Enrollment limited to 30. {A}{S}\n\nFall, Spring, Alternate Years\n\nMUS 260 The Music of J.S. Bach (4 Credits)\n\nThis course is an introduction to the music, life, and legacy of the composer Johann Sebastian Bach, whose music inspired generations of composers and performers across genres. In addition to studying some of his works in depth and his biography, we will explore the cultural and historical context in which he worked, raising questions about performance, instruments, religious life, and patronage. We also look at his influence on music in the nineteenth century, the controversies around his St. John Passion in the twentieth, and his legacy in the twenty-first century. {A}{H}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nMUS 262 Experimental Music (4 Credits)\n\nWhat counts as music? Who decides? Can anyone make music? This course raises these and other questions by focusing on experimental music. The course explores the history and practice of experimental music, focusing on text, graphic and other forms of notation. The course also looks at the history of experimental music in performance and makes in-class performances of several key pieces. Through reading and practice, the course asks questions about musical authority, skill and even failure, and the role of institutions in shaping musical ideas. {A}{H}\n\nSpring\n\nMUS 321 Seminar: Songwriting (4 Credits)\n\nThis seminar is a practicum on songwriting. Through weekly creative assignments, in-class workshops and listening, students develop and strengthen their skills as musicians, performers and lyricists.

Restrictions: First years only; students are limited to one first year seminar. Enrollment limited to 16. WI\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nMUS 231 Colloquium: From Goat Songs To Flash Mobs: Music and Theater (4 Credits)\n\nMusic and theatre are both time-based arts that involve bodies in motion in front of an audience. Though they may be considered separate disciplines, the full extent of what they share often makes them wonderfully indistinguishable. This course probes the intersections of music and theatre through a survey of genres, works, artists, and practitioners. While material covered will include clearly relevant genres such as musicals and opera, the focus will be on more difficult to categorize topics such as performance art, immersive theatre, and experimental music, in an open-minded examination of what makes this alliance so compelling. Enrollment limited to 20. {A}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nPerformance Study\n\nThe music department offers a range of performance courses: individual lessons (MUS 914Y, 924Y, 930Y and 940Y); chamber music coaching (MUS 901); conducting (MUS 903); and large ensembles (MUS 951 and above).\n\nIndividual voice and instrument performance courses consist of weekly private lessons, with specific expectations determined by each instructor. Lessons require a yearlong commitment and are normally taken in addition to a regular course load. Two such courses may be taken concurrently by petition only for students who have declared the music major or minor. Petitions are due to the music department by the last day of the pre-registration period.\n\nAdmission to individual lessons, chamber music, and some ensembles is determined by audition during fall semester orientation period and the first days of the semester. Students are accepted on the basis of musicianship, competence and potential. With the exception of voice, some prior experience is assumed. Information and sign-up sheets for auditions may be found at the Music Department office.\n\nWhen no instructor for a particular instrument is available at Smith College, every effort is made to provide students with qualified instructors from the Five College community. Such arrangements may require Smith students to travel to other campuses within the Five College system. Students wishing to study performance with Five College faculty must obtain departmental approval.\n\nAll performance students are encouraged to study music in the classroom. Non-majors and non-minors should talk with their instructors about which courses best complement their interests.\n\nNo more than 24 credits in performance may be counted toward graduation. This includes participation in the various large ensembles described below.\n\nAll large ensembles are graded on an S/U basis.\n\nIndividual performance lessons carry the following numbering sequence and credits:\n\nMUS 914Y First year of study\n\nThis is a full-year course. {8} {A} Credits: 2.

The exam assesses knowledge of basic Western tonal music concepts. Students will be placed into Fundamentals of Music (MUS100) or Analysis and Repertory (MUS110). The exam will be available on Moodle starting on Tuesday, August 1 and must be completed by the first day of classes. It is not graded and is not part of your academic record. The exam consists of:\n\nidentifying pitches and accidentals in treble and bass clef\n\nidentifying meters from rhythmic notation\n\nidentifying scales and key signatures\n\nbriefly describing your musical experience and training\n\nThe placement test must represent your own work and must be taken in accordance with Smith College’s Academic Honor Code.

There is no time limit.\n\nAssessment\n\nThe following are the three (3) possible results of the placement exam:\n\n100: The student has placed into Fundamentals of Music (MUS100) and can pursue MUS110 following the completion of MUS100.\n\n110*: The student has too much background for Fundamentals of Music but may find MUS110 challenging. This is a gray area and consultation with the theory instructor is recommended. For those in this area who wish to pursue enrollment in MUS110, consider supplemental study, such as private tutoring sessions through the Jacobson Center (paid by the college), or self-directed study. The “Fundamentals” section of the free online textbook Open Music Theory is a recommended resource for self-directed study.\n\n110: The student has placed into MUS110.\n\nInstructions\n\nLog into Moodle using your Smith ID and password.\n\nAccess the Music Theory Placement Exam.\n\nClick “Enroll Me” to gain access to the Moodle page and the exam document.\n\nComplete the quiz under the heading “Music Theory Placement Exam - Fall 2024”.

We’re lucky to be able to rehearse in our performance venue, on stage at Sweeney Concert Hall.\n\nHow many concerts does the Wind Ensemble play?\n\nWe do two concerts per year, one each at the end of the fall and spring semesters. There is also at least one additional smaller performance, usually during Parents’ Weekend.\n\nWhat kind of music does the Wind Ensemble play?\n\nWe play a variety of pieces written for wind band. As the director, I'm personally very committed to playing more contemporary works by living composers, especially those who have been historically underrepresented. You can see some recent concert programs here and here. The SCWE is also a member of the Mexican Composer Incubation Project, which provides feedback and reference recordings to Mexican composers who write educational works for wind band.\n\nHow big is the Wind Ensemble?\n\nIn Spring 2024 we had about 55 performers, and the group tends to hover somewhere around 50–60.\n\nIs Wind Ensemble a class? A club? Do I have to take it for credit?\n\nWind Ensemble is simultaneously a 1-credit course, and a registered student organization. The vast majority of students take the class for credit, though it is possible to participate in the ensemble without registering (however, the expectations are the same). As a student organization, we also have a student board who manages social activities and other group events.\n\nDo I have to audition? What’s the playing expectation?\n\nWe are a non-auditioned ensemble*. Anyone who participated in their high school music ensemble program is well prepared to join the SCWE. Those who play an instrument but didn’t have a traditional high school band experience have also been great additions and very successful in the group. Even though we are non-auditioned, the group is held to a high standard and produces wonderful concerts.\n\nNew members will have an informal one-on-one meeting with the director at the beginning of the semester where we’ll chat about your background and you’ll play something of your choosing (it can be anything! A prepared solo, a favorite pep band tune, or even just a scale). This helps with part assignments, and making sure the director understands the strengths of the ensemble.\n\n*Occasionally, when the group is large and there is a lot of interest in a particular section, auditions are held for new members. This is simply because of the capacity of our rehearsal and performance space. Students who aren’t selected are highly encouraged to consider joining the group in subsequent semesters when space is available.\n\nDo I have to have my own instrument?\n\nThe vast majority of SCWE members (except percussionists) use their own instruments. The music department has a limited number of instruments, mostly specialty (bassoon, bass clarinet, English horn). However, we’ve been able to work out borrowing or rental agreements for other instruments with other local band programs or music stores - contact us if this is a concern, we can always work something out. Lockers are available for storage in Sage Hall.\n\nWhat’s the practice expectation?\n\nMembers are expected to address individual practice needs outside of rehearsal, which varies greatly from player to player. Many members are able to get all their individual needs worked out within our regular rehearsals. The music is selected carefully to challenge the players, but also to be cognizant of the busy schedules of Smith students. On average, there might be a total of 1-2 hours of individual work needed outside of rehearsal, mostly at the beginning of the semester when the music is new. The director is always available for one-on-one help.\n\nWhat’s the director like?\n\nHi, that’s me! My name is Meghan MacFadden, and I have been the director of the SCWE since 2022. I strive to create a welcoming, safe, and enjoyable environment for our ensemble members to have a change of pace from their other academic classes every Monday night. There are jokes, there are memes, but most importantly there’s a ton of beautiful music-making.\n\nHow do I sign up?\n\nContact me via the email address below, then register for the course (MUS 957-01) via Workday. There may be a little bit of red tape involving “instructor approval” or a waitlist, but that’s just so I can know what instrument you play.\n\nI have other questions, who do I ask?\n\nSend me an email! General questions about music at Smith (including other course options, lockers, and borrowing instruments) can be directed to the department assistant, Anna Goudreau.\n\nWailing Banshees (Celtic Music Ensemble)\n\nOpen to all who play fiddle, flute, penny whistle, accordion, pipes, concertina, harp, banjo, mandolin, cello (or viola), limited space for guitar or keyboards.\n\nAudition requirements: No audition necessary, course questionnaire required\n\nWeekly rehearsal: T 7–8:30 p.m.\n\nRegistration data: MUS 958, 1 credit S/U\n\nDirector: Ellen Redman\n\nQuestions?: Email Ellen Redman, Director\n\nHandbell Choir\n\nThe Smith College Handbell Choir is the best brass on campus!

The ensemble is designed to be hands-on and experiential, encouraging students to explore the basic ideas of Chinese music and culture through weekly rehearsals, practices, and performances. No prior experience necessary.\n\nAudition requirements: No formal audition necessary, but permission of instructor is necessary.

A variety of concerts, recitals, and residencies ensure a lively calendar of musical events and furnish a remarkable array of resources for the study and performance of music of every period and style.\n\nFounded in 1979, the Five College Early Music Program (EMP) is a collaboration among schools, programs, and teachers in the Five College Consortium to offer students and affiliates the opportunity to explore the rich and varied music of the Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque periods. Participants may take private lessons, participate in chamber music courses or larger ensembles, or study historical dance, under the guidance of specialist instructors in the field of early music. The Early Music Program also hosts or co-hosts performances and residencies by professional early music performers and ensembles.\n\nIf you’re interested in participating in the Early Music Program, please fill out the following survey form, which will also link you to a form for scheduling an audition. If you have any questions, please contact program director Allison Monroe at amonroe@mtholyoke.edu. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nAdvisers: Members of the Five College Ethnomusicology Committee\n\nThe Certificate Program in Ethnomusicology will provide a coherent framework for navigating course offerings and engaging with ethnomusicologists throughout the Five Colleges.\n\nRequirements\n\nTo earn a Five College Certificate in Ethnomusicology, students must successfully complete a total of seven (7) courses distributed as indicated in the following four (4) categories. No more than five courses can be from any one department/discipline, and introductory courses in basic musicianship do not count towards the requirements; introductory courses in related disciplines may only be counted in certain circumstances determined by the research goals of the individual student. Students must earn a grade of C or better for courses counted towards the Certificate.\n\nArea Studies or Topics courses: at least two courses\n\nMethodology: at least two courses\n\nPerformance: at least one course\n\nElectives: negotiated in consultation with the student's ethnomusicology advisor, including courses from related disciplines including: anthropology, sociology, history, or media studies; area studies fields such as African Studies, American Studies, Asian Studies, or Middle East Studies; or others related to a particular student's ethnomusicological interests.\n\nSince ethnomusicological research and related musical performance may require understanding of and competence in a foreign language, students are encouraged, but not required, to acquire proficiency in a language relevant to their focus. Students are also encouraged to include experiential learning, a study abroad or domestic exchange experience, in-depth study of a single musical tradition, or comparative studies of several musical traditions.\n\nCourses and ensembles will be posted and updated on our website.\n\nThe Department’s instrument resources include excellent performance pianos and keyboard instruments: two Steinway “D”s, a Hamburg Steinway “C,” three harpsichords and three pipe organs (in the Helen Hills Hills Chapel and John M. Greene Hall) are regularly used for teaching and performance. The department’s fortepiano was built in 1985 by Robert E. Smith after a design by Conrad Graf.\n\nThe Department also has various woodwind, brass, and stringed instruments available for student use.\n\nThe Digital Music Lab is home to thirteen workstations with 88-key weighted keyboards. The DML computers hold many exciting music software programs, including music notation software (Sibelius, Noteflight), Digital Audio Workstations (Reaper, Audacity), and other programs (Max MSP, SPEAR). Students who would like to request access to the Digitial Music Lab should email Anna Goudreau at agoudreau@smith.edu.\n\nOpportunities & Resources\n\nThe music department is home to a lively community of faculty-directed performing ensembles. All students, majors and non-majors, are welcome in the department ensembles, which cover a wide variety of musical styles from all over the world.\n\nOrchestra\n\nThe Smith Orchestra is conducted by Jonathan Hirsh and is open by audition to students with prior instrumental training. It rehearses one evening per week, with extra rehearsals and sectionals as needed to prepare for performances. The ensemble performs the classics of the orchestral repertoire, including key pieces from the Classical and Romantic periods, as well as works from the 20th and 21st century, some composed by Smith faculty and visiting artists. Recent composer residencies have included performances featuring Caroline Shaw and Reena Esmail. The orchestra performs several times each year, both in concerts featuring exclusively orchestral repertoire and in those where the orchestra combines forces with the Glee Club or other campus ensembles to explore works such as Orff's Carmina Burana and Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.\n\nFor more information about the Smith Orchestra, please contact the group's conductor, Jonathan Hirsh, at jhirsh@smith.edu.\n\nJazz Ensemble\n\nThe Smith Jazz Ensemble rehearses once a week for two hours and plays music designed to teach jazz ensemble concepts (phrasing, articulation, swing feel) as well as give improvised solo space for all members. Though favoring the typical \"Big Band\" instrumentation (including vocalist), other instruments are welcome on an \"as-needed\" basis. Performing multiple times each academic year, the group counts tunes as done by Basie, Ellington, and Sinatra plus more contemporary tunes among its repertoire. The group accepts members with all levels of prior jazz training. The Jazz Ensemble is directed by Genevieve Rose, grose@smith.edu.\n\nWind Ensemble\n\nThe Smith Wind Ensemble is conducted by Meghan MacFadden and is open, without audition, to any woodwind, brass, or percussion player with prior instrumental experience. The group rehearses for two hours on Monday evenings. The Wind Ensemble performs a wide variety of literature from the wind band canon with a commitment to living and historically underrepresented composers. Recent works performed include Diamond Tide by Viet Cuong, Impulse Engine by Carolyn Bremer, and Shenandoah by Omar Thomas. The Wind Ensemble performs two main concerts per year with additional appearances around campus, and frequently collaborates with other collegiate and professional wind ensembles.\n\nFor more information about the Smith Wind Ensemble, please contact the group's conductor, Meghan MacFadden, at mmacfadden@smith.edu.\n\nWailing Banshees\n\nStarted in 2005, the Wailing Banshees are Smith's Irish/Celtic music ensemble. The group is made up largely of fiddles, flutes, whistles and even bagpipes, with a rhythm section that can consist of guitar, bodhran, mandolin and even cello! The Banshees rehearse two hours per week and give two full concerts per year, and are often in demand at various events on- and off-campus. Their music is largely Scottish and Irish but includes all the Celtic lands and ranges in style from more modern arrangements, to sean nos and ceili band. The ensemble is open to all Five College students with permission of the director, Ellen Redman, eredman@smith.edu.\n\nSmith Gamelan\n\nThe Smith Gamelan is a performance group dedicated to the study of Central Javanese gamelan, one of the great musical traditions of the world. The group was founded in 1995 as a way to introduce Five College students to this Indonesian musical tradition and it is directed by Phil Acimovic. The group meets once a week during the school year and presents a performance at the end of each semester. Membership in the Smith Gamelan is open to students, staff, and faculty of the Five College community.\n\nQuestions can be directed to Phil Acimovic at pacimovic@smith.edu.\n\nSmith Chinese Music Ensemble\n\nThe Smith Chinese Music Ensemble is a performance ensemble dedicated to exploring the modern Chinese ensemble and musical styles. The group is made up of traditional Chinese instruments including plucked lutes and zithers, hammered dulcimer, bowed fiddles, and bamboo/reed flutes. The ensemble is directed by Joy Lu, meets once a week for 90 minutes, and presents at least one concert per semester.\n\nThe ensemble is open by audition or permission of the director. For more information or questions, please contact Joy Lu at clu24@smith.edu\n\nFormed in 1885, the Smith College Glee Club performs annually at Commencement and Christmas Vespers; on Family Weekend, for Autumn Serenade, and at college events including Opening Convocation and Rally Day. The Glee Club selects music from a diverse repertoire, including major works for treble voices, jazz, contemporary, folk music of the U.S. and from international traditions. Guest choirs from such universities as Harvard, Rutgers, Cornell, Michigan and Virginia regularly come to campus to collaborate on a major work. Recent performances have included A Night at the Opera: Celebrating the Achievements of African American Singers featuring narrator George Shirley, Haydn’s Lord Nelson Mass, and Brahms’ Ein Deutsches Requiem. Auditions for Glee Club are normally held during orientation and in the first two weeks of classes in both semesters.\n\nMembers of the Glee Club are eligible to audition for the highly selective Smith College Chamber Singers. The internationally known Chamber Singers have performed throughout the world since 1951.\n\nTouring normally every two years, the program provides financial assistance enabling all members to travel regardless of financial need. Auditions for Chamber Singers are held during orientation, in the first two weeks of classes in the fall semester and, occasionally, before the spring semester.\n\nBeginning singers of all class years are welcome to take Introduction to Choral Singing, a class in which students learn to read music and establish a healthy vocal technique. The course includes one informal performance at the end of each semester.\n\nIntroduction to Choral Singing, Glee Club and Chamber Singers meet once or twice per week in the late afternoon/early evening.\n\nPlaying and singing in small ensembles allows for intimate music-making while exploring great works from the repertory. Groups, formed ad hoc or in consultation with faculty, may be eligible to register each semester for weekly coachings (1 credit). In recent years works from Bach to Brahms to Reich have been explored. Preference is given to students studying instruments or voice at Smith.\n\nFor more information on playing in chamber music ensembles, please contact Anna Godreau.\n\nPrizes\n\nThe Department of Music awards annual prizes for excellent work in the areas of music history, theory, composition, and performance. In some cases these prizes offer substantial amounts that may cover the expense of summer musical study or even tuition at an institution of higher learning.\n\nSusan Rose Internships in Music\n\nEach summer since 1998, a number of students in music have pursued career internships in a wide variety of areas with financial support provided by an extraordinarily generous gift to the college from Susan Wechsler Rose, Class of ’63. These internships have ranged from performance to academic musical study, from music administration to the real world of the business of music. Recent internships have included:\n\nparticipation in the opera workshop at the Aspen Music Festival in Aspen, Colorado;\n\nstudy of traditional Ewe drumming in Ghana, West Africa;\n\nstudy of Javanese Gamelan in Surakarta, Indonesia;\n\nbibliographical work on Berlioz at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France;\n\nthe study of conducting at the Hartt School of Music in Hartford, Connecticut;\n\ninternship in radio/podcasting at The Art of Moving Music;\n\norchestral librarianship at the Glimmerglass Festival in Cooperstown, New York;\n\nadministrative assistance at the Washington National Opera, in Washington, D.C.\n\nsummer courses in music production, in New York City\n\nAll sophomores, juniors and seniors enrolled at Smith whose curriculum has included classroom courses in music, and who have demonstrated a commitment to the study of music, are eligible—and are encouraged—to compete for a Susan Rose Internship. The grant provides funding up to an approximate maximum of $5,000. Students are normally awarded only one grant during their years at the college, but in special circumstances students may apply for a second.\n\nInternships are normally carried out during the summer months following the sophomore or junior year, but proposals for work during the academic year, or for work to be carried out after graduation, will also receive careful consideration.\n\nA student who wishes to compete for an internship should consult with their music professors, and with the chairs of the music department’s Susan Rose Internship Committee - Andrea Moore, amoore44@smith.edu, and Maeve Sterbenz, msterbenz@smith.edu - regarding the area in which they expect to pursue work. They should then prepare a one-page proposal and a detailed budget (indicating, as specifically required for the internship, the cost of room and board, instruction, and transportation), and submit these documents along with an unofficial copy of their academic transcript. They should have one brief letter of recommendation (from a music professor or other familiar with their work) sent via email directly to the Music Academic Assistant, Anna Goudreau, agoudreau@smith.edu.\n\nApplications for 2024 summer projects must be submitted to Anna Goudreau by April 19, 2024.\n\nStudents who are awarded Susan Rose funding, upon completion of their internship or project, must submit a one-page essay about their experience to Anna Goudreau.\n\nSage Hall: Conditions for Use (PDF)\n\nSage Hall Locker Registration Form\n\nPractice Room Policies (PDF)\n\nPractice Room Application for Use (PDF)\n\nGroup Student Recital Form (PDF)\n\nPerformance Petition\n\nRecital Planning for Student Recitals\n\nPlanning Your Student Recital (PDF)\n\nEvent Planning\n\nSage Hall Planning Calendar\n\nEvent Planning Checklist (PDF)\n\nPosters and Programs (PDF)\n\nContract Worksheet (PDF)\n\nFor Faculty & Staff\n\nAppearance Authorization Form (PDF)\n\nMusic Department Committees (PDF)\n\nDepartment Meeting Schedule (PDF)\n\nAbout the Department\n\nSo wrote Henry Dike Sleeper, long-time chair of the music department in the early years of the 20th century. The department was formed in 1903 and included a series of professional concerts, or “concert course,” that brought many celebrated musicians to the campus—among them Sergei Rachmaninoff, who played his first concert in America here in November 1909. Until the early 1970s, the “course” continued to offer Smith audiences such organizations and artists as the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Cleveland Orchestra, Rudolph Serkin and Marilyn Horne.\n\nSmith's long commitment to musical performance and study is demonstrated by the impressive list of musicians who have taught at the college, which includes composers Roger Sessions, Ross Lee Finney, Alvin Etler and John Duke, who taught in the department for more than 40 years. From 1939 to 1950, one of the world's greatest musical scholars, Alfred Einstein, taught music history at Smith and helped to enrich the extraordinary holdings of the music library soon named for his colleague, composer/conductor Werner Josten. Among the distinguished performers who have served on the faculty are Philipp Naegele, a violinist and violist who was a founding member of the Marlboro Music Festival; Ernst Wallfisch, a celebrated violist who, with his wife the pianist Lory Wallfisch, performed in venues around the world; and Iva Dee Hiatt, the choral conductor who developed Smith’s choral ensembles into some of the best in the country.\n\nThe Smith College Music Department is busy making music throughout New England and the world.
