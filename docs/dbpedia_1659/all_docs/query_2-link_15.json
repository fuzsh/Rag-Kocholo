        "meta_description": "One of our favourite groups here at Band on the Wall, the Haggis Horns won’t need an introduction to any followers of funk as they are at the very pinnacle of the scene. After fifteen years of tearing up clubs and festivals at home in the U.K. and internationally too they are gearing up to release their fourth album, the second on their own Haggis Records label. A band at the top of their game, The Haggis Horns are a 8-piece live extravaganza combining heavy breakbeat funk, soul, hip-hop and afrobeat. After the success of 'Hot Damn!' , 'Keep On Moving' and 'What Comes To Mind' their next album shows the boys blasting out their unique brand of dance floor funk with regular collaborators Lucinda Slim and John McCallum on tracks ranging from up beat breaks to down tempo slinkyness. Also on the album is rapper Doc Brown who helps create a distinctive hip-hop feel that runs through their latest studio offering.",
