Imagine: an imp with low income trying to get by with his wife while having to deal with his crazy boss. Like in the first episode, he also questions many things about his job and whether he’s built for it all. The team claims imps have it the worst out all the classes but it doesn’t seem like it? This would’ve been a great opportunity to show what life is like for the average struggling imp worker."
