Apply with confidence to these 3 top scholarships for music students:\n\nGucci Changemakers North America Scholarship – For current or incoming college students majoring in marketing, art, design, film, communications, or other creative fields.

Keep on reading to learn more about our top music scholarships including eligibility, award amount, and application deadlines!\n\nHow to win music scholarships\n\nLike any type of scholarship, music scholarships receive a lot of applications. To stand out and win a scholarship, you’ll have to put a lot of thought into your essays and application materials. Before you begin applying, try sitting down and doing some reflection. Think about what has led you to pursue a music education, and how you work your background, upbringing, and culture into your work.\n\nIf you have already completed your own projects or been a member of an ensemble, think about how these experiences have shaped your goals and demonstrated your potential. Consider the change you hope to make in the world through your music, where you want to be in 5 years, and how you plan to get there.\n\nNext it’s time to get your brainstorming down on paper. Don’t worry about grammar or succinctness here, just get your ideas on the page in bullet points or sentence fragments or whatever feels most natural to you. Once you begin writing your essays, these notes will come in handy often.\n\nAlso see: Top summer music programs for high school students\n\nWriting a great essay\n\nWriting a great scholarship essay is a unique craft that takes some time to get used to.

We can also help you respond to common scholarship essay prompts, including “Why do you deserve this scholarship?” Finally, check out our guides to tailoring your writing to 250 or 500 word limits.\n\nResources for music students\n\nDelta Omicron\n\nDelta Omicron is an international business fraternity for music students of all gender identities. They have chapters at many colleges throughout the country and facilitate lectures, recitals, networking opportunities, and much more.\n\nAmerican Music Therapy Association\n\nThe AMTA is a national organization that helps support and develop the field of music therapy all across the country. Student membership is only $95 per year and comes with perks such as literature from the organization, networking opportunities, and trainings.\n\nNeed-based financial aid for music students\n\nIf you are a current or prospective music major, you may also qualify for need-based financial aid through your college or through the government. There are two major financial aid applications you should know about:\n\nFree Application for Federal Student Aid (or FAFSA) which is how students can access financial aid through the government. This financial aid can include federal student loans, Federal SEOG Grants, and Pell Grants.\n\nCSS Profile which is how some colleges and universities award institutional financial aid.\n\nBe sure to check-in with your college to see what applications are required for need-based financial aid.\n\nFrequently asked questions about music scholarships\n\nOther scholarship categories to explore\n\nTop art scholarships\n\nScholarships for vocalists\n\nMusical theatre scholarships\n\nInstrument scholarships\n\nMarching band scholarships\n\nFilm scholarships\n\nTop video scholarships"
