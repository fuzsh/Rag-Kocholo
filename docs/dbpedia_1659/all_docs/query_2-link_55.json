        "text": "ALABAMA (KTRK) -- A 7-year-old Texas longhorn now holds the Guinness World Record for having the longest horns.\n\nPoncho Via's horns measure at least 10 feet 7 inches, which is more than twice the width of a concert grand piano and wider than the Statue of Liberty's face.\n\nThis means that the steer not only has the largest horns on a living steer, but also claims the title for having the largest horn spread on a steer ever.\n\nPoncho lives on a ranch in the small town near Birmingham, Alabama. He has been raised by the Pope family since he was a weanling.\n\nPoncho was named after the 1960s TV and movie character, Poncho Villa."
