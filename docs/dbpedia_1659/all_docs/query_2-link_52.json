        "text": "You know the Memphis Horns, even if you think you don't.\n\nThis magical musical duo, made up of saxophonist Andrew Love and trumpeter Wayne Jackson, played on countless hit songs for decades. The pair played on soul, blues, R&B, country and rock 'n' roll hits, always adding that special Memphis sound to each and every recording.\n\nThe Memphis Horns played on three of Elvis' hits: \"Suspicious Minds,\" \"In the Ghetto\" and \"Kentucky Rain.\" Let's learn more about these guys, who provided an incredible sound for so many legendary artists, including the King of Rock 'n' Roll.\n\nThe Memphis Horns performed on one of Elvis' biggest hits, \"Suspicious Minds.\"\n\nAndrew Love, a Memphis native, began playing music in his father's church. Wayne Jackson, from West Memphis, Arkansas, took up the trumpet in the school band. Both of the men found careers in music in the Bluff City - Jackson joined a group called The Mar-Keys, while Love performed session work at Willie Mitchell's Hi Records. The guys eventually landed at the legendary Stax label, where they met. You could say the rest is history, but it's a really good history.\n\nAndrew Love and Wayne Jackson are The Memphis Horns. They were born just a few days apart from each other - Love was born on November 21, 1941, and Jackson was born on November 24.\n\nJackson and Love performed for Stax, Hi Records and American Studio, all in Memphis, and they also recorded at studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. The guys decided to form The Memphis Horns after performing with Otis Redding at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival. The guys were employed by Stax, but left in 1969 to offer their services to anyone who wanted that special Memphis sound.\n\nLove and Jackson played on Elvis' RCA sessions at American Studios in Memphis on January 13-16 and 20-23, 1969, and Jackson performed on the sessions on February 17-22, 1969. \"Suspicious Minds\" and \"In the Ghetto\" were recorded in January, with \"Kentucky Rain\" recorded in February.\n\nWayne and Elvis.\n\nThe Memphis Horns contributed to so many incredible hit songs and albums, beyond their work for the king. Here is an incredibly short and in no way comprehensive list of songs and albums the pair worked on: \"Try a Little Tenderness\" and \"(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay\" by Otis Redding; \"Respect\" and \"Think\" by Aretha Franklin; \"In the Midnight Hour\" and \"Mustang Sally\" by Wilson Pickett; \"When a Man Loves a Woman\" by Percy Sledge; \"B-A-B-Y\" by Carla Thomas; \"Knock on Wood\" by Eddie Floyd; \"\"Tired of Being Alone,\" \"Let's Stay Together,\" \"I'm Still in Love with You\" and \"You Ought to Be With Me\" by Al Green; \"Shaft\" by Isaac Hayes; \"Dusty in Memphis\" by Dusty Springfield; \"Hot Buttered Soul\" by Isaac Hayes; \"Soul Man\" and \"Hold On I'm Coming\" by Sam & Dave; \"Sweet Caroline\" by Neil Diamond; \"I Just Can't Help Believing\" and \"Hooked on a Feeling\" by B.J. Thomas; \"Roll With It,\" by Steve Winwood; \"Takin' It to the Streets,\" by the Doobie Brothers; \"Shotgun Willie\" by Willie Nelson; \"Do the Funky Chicken,\" by Rufus Thomas; \"I Can't Stand the Rain\" by Ann Peebles; \"Rattle & Hum\" by U2; \"Sledgehammer\" by Peter Gabriel; \"Born to Boogie\" by Hank Williams Jr.; \"Mercury Falling\" by Sting; \"Disciplined Breakdown\" by Collective Soul.\n\nAs you can tell, the duo performed on countless chart-topping songs and albums, GRAMMY-award winning music, and tunes that have been loved by fans for decades.\n\nLove retired in 2004, and passed away in 2012. Jackson died in 2016. The Memphis Horns were inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame in 2008, and that same year, Jackson was inducted into the Arkansas Entertainers Hall of Fame. The pair were inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2017.\n\nLearn more about some of the other musicians, producers and singers who worked with Elvis.
