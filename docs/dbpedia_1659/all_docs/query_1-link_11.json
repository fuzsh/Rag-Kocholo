        "text": "Images\n\nActivities\n\nMotivational Activity:\n\n1. Begin class with a video clip of the Glenn Miller Modernaires performing “Jukebox Saturday Night” (1944). Ask students to pay special attention to the instrumental music heard in this recording. Explain that the music in this clip is being performed by the Glenn Miller Orchestra, a popular “Big Band” during the early 1940s. The Modernaires were a vocal group who often performed with the orchestra.\n\n2. Display a the image of Billboard’s No. 1 best selling singles for 1941, the year the United States entered into World War II. Ask students:\n\nHow many times does the Glenn Miller Orchestra appear on this list?\n\nHow many other songs on the list are performed by bandleaders and their Big Band orchestras? (Note to teacher: all the songs included on the list are by Big Bands.)\n\nWhat does this list suggest about the popularity of Big Bands in American popular culture during the early 1940s?\n\nProcedure:\n\n1. Play an audio clip of “Sing Sing Sing” (1937), a song recorded by the Benny Goodman Orchestra during the so-called “Big Band era” of the late 1930s and early 1940s. While listening, students should take notes on any instruments they can identify on the recording.\n\n2. Display a photo of the Benny Goodman Orchestra from the late 1930s. Help the students identify the instruments in this ensemble, which features one clarinet (played by Benny Goodman, in front), four trumpets, two trombones, four saxophones, piano, guitar, bass, and drums — a total of fifteen musicians, though many bands of the era were even larger. Ask students:\n\nWhat do you think might have been some of the challenges of managing a band of this size? (Answers may include: touring with a large group of people can be logistically difficult, it’s expensive to pay the salaries of so many musicians, etc.)\n\n3. Display images of rationing posters, which were displayed throughout the country during World War II. Have student volunteers describe the images on these posters. What sacrifices do these posters ask American civilians to make, and why do you think these sacrifices were important to the war effort?\n\n4. Play video clip from Washington in Wartime (1943), a film depicting life in Washington D.C. at the height of the war. As they watch, students should take notes on how the film presents ways that civilians can contribute to the war effort.Discuss as a class:\n\nWhy are the people riding bicycles described as “setting a patriotic example to citizens everywhere”?\n\nHow might the idea of personal sacrifice help to bring citizens together during wartime?\n\n5. Return to the photo of the Benny Goodman Orchestra from 1937. Ask students: How might rations on rubber tires, gasoline, and other travel restrictions due to the war have affected the touring schedule of a band of this size?\n\n6. Display the table showing active U.S. military personnel from 1939-1945. Students should examine the sizes of different branches of the military over the course of the war. Ask students:\n\nWith so many Americans in the service, in what ways do you think civilian life changed at home? Consider family life, jobs for women and minorities, entertainment, spending, etc.\n\nHow would the culture of rationing have affected the audience’s participation in live music performances, and how would that have affected the bands?\n\nHow might the military build-up have affected the ability of civilian bandleaders to hire and retain musicians? How do you think this might have affected the size of Big Bands during the war? (Note to teacher: guide students towards the conclusion that many bands grew smaller.)\n\n7. Display a photo of the Glenn Miller Orchestra in 1940 (point out Miller playing trombone in front), followed a photo of Miller conducting the U.S. Army Air Force Band during the war. In 1942, when the Glenn Miller Orchestra was one of the best selling acts in the country, Miller left the band to voluntarily enlist in the armed forces. As a captain, he formed an ensemble of military musicians to entertain the troops. Ask students:\n\nWhat kind of statement does it make when the best selling artist of his era decides to change the course of his career to join the military?\n\nHow might Glenn Miller’s music have served a different purpose for an audience of soldiers stationed thousands of miles from their homes than it served for civilian audiences?\n\n8. Explain that in addition to rationing and the military build-up, there was also a 1942 strike by the American Federation of Musicians against the major record labels that affected the popular music industry. While the strike did not necessarily lead to smaller bands, it did shift the focal point of the popular music combo. Divide students up into small groups and distribute Handout 1 – All Recording Stops Today. Students should read the handout as a group and discuss the questions below. When finished, invite volunteers from each group to share their answers.\n\nWhat are some ways that the musicians strike both intentionally and unintentionally affected popular music culture in the U.S.?\n\nWhy did vocalists experience a rise in popularity during the strike?\n\nWhat factors led towards the rise in popularity of African-American and traditional Folk-rooted genres? Why do you think small combos that played these genres had a new advantage over the Big Bands?\n\n9. Display side-by-side images of two different versions of record labels for “All Or Nothing At All,” a song recorded by Harry James and His Orchestra with vocals by Frank Sinatra that was first released in 1940 (before the recording ban), then reissued in 1943 (at the height of the recording ban). Ask students:\n\nWhat do you notice about the placement and size of Frank Sinatra’s name in relation to Harry James and His Orchestra on the left-hand label? How does this design change on the right-hand label, when the recording was reissued in 1943?\n\nWhat does the design of the 1943 reissue label change suggest about how Sinatra’s popularity has changed between the years 1940 and 1943?\n\n10. Play a clip of Frank Sinatra performing the song “Stardust” on the television and radio program Your Hit Parade (1949). Point out that Sinatra became a featured singer on this program in 1943, at the height of the musicians strike. Ask students:\n\nHow might Sinatra’s frequent appearances on a nationally-syndicated show between 1943 and 1949 have affected his popularity?\n\n11. Non-union R&B and Country artists who were not beholden to the terms of the recording ban also found larger audiences during and after the war. For examples of these respective genres, play video clip of the Nat King Cole Trio performing “It’s Better to Be Yourself”(1951), followed by a clip of the Johnny Burnette Trio performing “Lonesome Train” (1956). Ask students:\n\nWhat musical instruments carry over from the Big Bands? [Note to teacher: students should recognize the guitar, upright bass, and piano.]\n\nHow do the sizes of these combos compare to an ensemble such as the Glenn Miller Orchestra?\n\nIn what ways might it have been less prohibitive for a small combo to tour than a Big Band? How might a small combo’s ability to tour more frequently affect the popularity of musical styles such as R&B and Country?\n\nDoes early Rock and Roll, as performed by artists including Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, and Elvis Presley, seem more connected to the music of Big Bands or to R&B and Country? How?\n\n12. Distribute Handout 2 – Best Selling Singles for 1941 and 1951. Students should examine both lists. Ask students:\n\nHow many Big Bands are featured on the 1951 list? What kinds of other artists are featured?\n\nWhat do these two lists suggest about changing tastes in popular music between 1941-1951?\n\nSummary Activity:\n\n1. Ask students to imagine that it is 1951, and they are reporters working at Billboard magazine on assignment to write an article about how the sound of American popular music changed from 1941 to 1951. Students should outline an article that takes the position that it was either events directly connected to World War II (military growth, rationing, etc.) or the musicians strike that caused ensemble sizes and popular musical sounds to change so drastically over a short period of time.\n\nStudents should write one or two lead sentences to set up their argument, followed by a rough outline for the rest of the article in list form.\n\nExtension Activity:\n\n1. Students should develop their outlines from the summary activity into a full article of approximately one page in length. Students may use any materials cited in the lesson and are welcome to expand their research to include any other artists who exemplified a shift in popular American musical tastes between the 1940s and early 1950s.\n\n2. During the war, many musical instrument manufacturers temporarily converted their factories to produce military contracts, including tanks, jet engines, and weaponry. Visit the website of the Library of Congress and view the gallery of photographs entitled Pianos to Airplane Motors, taken in 1942 by Ann Rosener for the U.S. Office of War Information.\n\nOf the 14 photographs included in the collection, choose one image and write a one-page imagined narrative in the voice of a person pictured in the selected image. What is his or her name? How long has he or she been working at the piano factory? What are his/her thoughts or feelings on the factory being converted to make jet engines for the war? Incorporate information and details you have learned in class, such as the rationing posters from WWII.\n\n3. Research a product or a material that was rationed during World War II and design an original rationing poster to help educate Americans about how rationing this item will help support the U.S. military during wartime. Students may choose from the following list:\n\nRubber\n\nShellac (used to manufacture gramophone records before the advent of vinyl in 1949)\n\nClothing and shoes\n\nScrap metal\n\nTypewriters\n\nFuel oil/gasoline/kerosene\n\nCoffee\n\nSugar\n\nCanned goods\n\nMeat\n\nCheese\n\n4. Conduct independent research on the musical career of a popular Big Band leader of 1930s-40s. Imagine that you are writing the liner notes for a contemporary reissue of this artist’s music. Write a 1-2 page essay on your artist and his band, being sure to mention any pertinent biographical information about the bandleader, any significant musicians who played in his ensemble, popular recordings they made, and how WWII and/or the musicians strike affected his band and career. Students may choose from the following band leaders:\n\nCount Basie\n\nCab Calloway\n\nTommy or Jimmy Dorsey (brothers)\n\nDuke Ellington\n\nBenny Goodman\n\nLionel Hampton\n\nFletcher Henderson\n\nWoody Herman\n\nHarry James\n\nKay Kyser\n\nJimmy Lunsford\n\nGlenn Miller\n\nBuddy Rich\n\nArtie Shaw\n\nHandouts\n\nHandout 1 – All Recording Stops Today Handout 2 – Best Selling
