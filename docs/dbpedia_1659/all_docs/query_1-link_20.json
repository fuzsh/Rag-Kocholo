        "text": "From Finnmark in the north to Trøndelag in the central part of Norway, you can experience the Sami way of life. Try your hand at dog sledging, camp in a traditional lavvo (Sami tent), and sample traditional Sami cuisine such as bidos (thick reindeer stew) and lefse (potato flatbread).\n\nIn Northern Norway, you can spend a day with a reindeer herder family and get a close encounter with their flock. In April and May, you can even experience the annual reindeer migration.\n\nThroughout the year several Sami festivals offer concerts, exhibitions, and fun activities such as reindeer racing and lasso throwing.\n\nThe Sami national museum in Karasjok, Varanger Sami Museum, and the Norwegian Museum of Cultural History in Oslo are just a few examples of museums that offer captivating exhibitions about the Sami culture and history."
