This program leads to a bachelor of music degree and focuses on applying skills acquired in the classroom in collaboration with ensembles of all sizes and styles. While much of what we do is based in the conservatory, this major is genre non-specific and seeks to teach musicians of all styles the technical skills and aesthetic considerations needed to explore the field of music production as both a profession and an art.\n\nThrough group and individualized instruction, hands-on opportunities to record a multitude of styles, and exposure to accomplished engineers and producers, students who complete this program are poised for audio careers that demand the highest level of expertise."
