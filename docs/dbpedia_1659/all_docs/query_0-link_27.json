        "text": "~\n\nGreetings, infernal warbröethers and all that. After a marathon stretch we’re finally here, hammering the last rusty nail into our 2020 LISTCRUSH series – the full-length albums that resonated most with me throughout 2020. At a cursory glance, Metal Archives has 3146 full-length black metal albums logged as being released last year. Of those, I probably only checked out around a thousand, tops. So remember: this is in no way a definitive list. I’m not the grand arbiter of taste or final word on anything. These are just the records that tickled my own personal blasphemy glands juuuust right.\n\nThe original shortlist was over 200 albums long and I’ve (excruciatingly) whittled it down to a hundred of the finest – there is no “near misses” section, because in a year in which we were absolutely spoiled for good music as most had much else better to do in quarantine, there are simply too many that would have very deservedly made the cut.\n\nThere are records that immediately blew my mind (number 92, number 2, number 8), records that crept up over time to become firm favourites (number 31), expected hypebeasts (number 4) and records that deserve FAR more attention (59, 63). There were things of beauty (58, 24) and ugliness (49, 38). There are records that I fell asleep to almost every night since they were released (number 3), thrilling new discoveries (95), old masters making a triumphant return (6)… and in the case of number ONE, records that unleashed their black irradiant glories extremely late in the year yet annihilated everything else that had come before.\n\nIf any of the album titles are highlighted, clicking that will take you to our coverage of the album (reviews, premieres, interviews and all that good stuff). This list is strictly black/blackened, so if you’d like recommendations for other genres hit me up – for example my top death metal album was Ulcerate, of course, followed by Atræ Bilis. I’d probably give label of the year to the untouchable Debemur Morti Productions and if you want to check out what I consider to be the strongest demos, EPs or Splits I heard last year, read Part 1 HERE and Part 2 HERE.\n\nThat’s it. Have at it, Listcrush is finally done for another year. Hails.\n\n~\n\nTOP 100 ALBUMS OF 2020\n\n100. FORTRESS OF THE OLDEN DAYS – Verlassenheit (Worship Tapes / A Pile Of Graves)\n\n99.

KOMMODUS – Kommodus (GoatowaRex)\n\n~\n\n1. ABIGOR – Totschläger (A Saintslayer’s Songbook) (World Terror Committee)\n\nI originally intended to keep it simple and wasn’t going to write anything at all about any album on this list, but I simply have to say a few words about this diabolical gem. After TT blew me away at the death of 2019 with the dazzling NEDXXX (well, personnel are still as-yet unconfirmed but I’d bet a solid hundred that he and Rune from Shaarimoth were involved) he’s done it again with Abigor‘s twelfth album, Totschläger (A Saintslayer’s Songbook). I’ve been listening to these nine tracks repeatedly since release and over countless spins each experience brings something new to appreciate and astound – be it tiny details in each intricate composition, or an entirely new favourite track each time. Silenius from Summoning puts in what may be the best performance of his life here, too – I liked Höllenzwang, but this proves Abigor remain at the absolute top of the game. I mean, just check out the final moments of album closer ‘Terrorkommando Eligos’ – what other band would have the testicular fortitude and sheer unbridled ability to pull off what’s ostensibly a minute or two of wild, slavering, black metal drum & bass?\n\nTHIS is, hands down, the best black metal album of the year for me. Listen to it. Hail Abigor.\n\n~\n\nUltimate respect to all artists, labels, writers and supporters of the black arts. You are all lords.\n\nLike Black Metal Daily on Facebook for more cult sounds and tonal blasphemy.\n\nEmail: blackmetaldaily@outlook.com\n\n~\n\nFUCK OFF AND DIE\n\n~\n\nA new entity has arrived – advocates for the extinguishment of all life in existence. They want you to join their cause, and their weapon of recruitment is filth encrusted mid-paced black pestilence that lurches and slithers with apocalyptic swagger. They see the wretchedness of humanity and offer a solution. They call themselves VUAL.\n\nThe unclean union of LEECH (Akasha) and VOK (Hag Graef), their debut assault To End All Life only dropped yesterday but instead of merely sharing it with a few inadequate words, we decided a shotgun interview would be more fitting and allow the more effective transmission of their malignant message and motives.\n\nSo, there’s nothing else to say. The album fucking annihilates. Read on, listen, join their cause… embrace your destiny. Spread the poison. End all life. Hails.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nWHAT IS VUAL?\n\n– The unity candidate, who bridges gaps and unites enemies in common cause. He sees the future and whispers for change.\n\nVual, the musical entity, channels his spirit and that pure pessimism and terror present in the works of authors such as Lovecraft and Thomas Ligotti, embracing the death cult and advocating for a anti-cosmic vanguard.\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT?\n\n– For mankind to atone for its many sins and answer the call to ascend to its rightful place as the diseased Beast of Omnicide, ending all multicellular life in the cosmos before retreating into the embrace of the great void to die cold and alone.\n\nWHY DO YOU LOATHE?\n\n– This species is a failure.\n\nWHO WILL YOU KILL?\n\n– Murder is not the point. The act itself is neither positive nor negative. That’s like praising the hammer and nail. Tools are tools.\n\nThe goal is the end of all multicellular life in the universe.\n\nWHERE IS YOUR INSPIRATION?\n\n– First and foremost, life. While mechanically robust, sentient participation in this universe has failed to live up to expectations. Theological answers have fallen short, governmental entities have proven to be wholly inept, and interpersonal interaction continues to be a source of unadulterated disappointment.\n\nThis universe can do better, and it is the policy position of VUAL that all life be ended to pave the way for that eventuality. You will not be allowed to participate in this bold new future, you will not reach a higher plane of existence. There is no Heaven, and there is no Hell. The cold reality is that this is your life, and your higher calling is to join the Battalion Nihil.\n\nWHAT DO YOU HAIL?\n\n– The empty circle, a vessel of form and possibility. There is no joy in this work, only function.\n\nBattalion Nihil’s march has been influenced by Craft, Carpathian Forest, and Wurdulak.\n\nWILL THERE BE TAPES/LP?\n\n– This communiqué will be disseminated.\n\nFINAL WORDS FOR ALL:\n\n– Drop out, abuse your liver, embrace the promise of a lifeless future, join Battalion Nihil.\n\nTo End All Life is available on Bandcamp now.\n\n~\n\nPurchase To End All Life from the Vual Bandcamp HERE. Stickers and pins also available.\n\nSupport Vual:\n\nOfficial Bandcamp\n\n~\n\nLike Black Metal Daily on Facebook for more kvlt sounds and tonal blasphemy.\n\nEmail: blackmetaldaily@outlook.com"
