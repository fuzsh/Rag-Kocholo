DARK HORIZON RECORDS HISTORY:

Dark Horizon Records has been in existence over 23 years and have always supported the DYI underground spirit! While we focus on Black and Death Metal primarily, we have an open mind when it comes to music and our releases reflect that. DHR has always been an innovator label in the underground music scene being the first label to release albums by such ground breaking and now “CULT” artists the likes of BLACK WITCHERY, REVENGE, FOG, FLAUROS, ASTRIAAL, NEBRON, LUCIFUGUM to the anti-religious and extremely profound music of TYPHUS & FORNICUS as well as the somber and solitude infused Dark Neo-Folk of NECHOCHWEN & OCTOBER FALLS and even the metal infused Samhain / Misfits influenced Horror Metal Punk of THE LURKING CORPSES. DHR shines as a beacon among the vast ocean of underground labels as one with Relevance, Integrity and Dedication to the bands, music and philosophy they project. Helping the deep underground reach the surface!
