He is well-regarded for his cultural influence on 20th-century film. He was also an activist for many causes, notably the civil rights movement and various Native American movements. Having studied with Stella Adler in the 1940s, he is credited with being one of the first actors to bring the Stanislavski system of acting and method acting, derived from the Stanislavski system, to mainstream audiences. He made his film debut in Fred Zinnermann’s The Men (1950), with Teresa Wright, Everett Sloane, Jack Webb, Richard Erdman, Virginia Farmer, Dorothy Tree, and Howard St. John.\n\nHis breakout role csme from his role as Stanley Kowalski in Elia Kazan‘s film adaptation of the Tennessee Williams play A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), a role that he originated successfully on Broadway. He received his first Academy Award nomination for best Actor. Co-stars Vivien Leigh, Kim Hunter, and Karl Malden all won Academy Awards for their performances.\n\nBrando received further praise, and an Academy Award win, for his performance as Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront (1954), with Malden, Lee J. Cobb, Rod Steiger, Pat Henning and Eva Marie Saint; and his portrayal of the rebellious motorcycle gang leader Johnny Strabler in Laslo Benedek’s The Wild One (1953), with Mary Murphy, Robert Kieth, and Lee Marvin, proved to be a lasting image in popular culture. He received further Academy Award nominations for playing Emiliano Zapata in Kazan’s Viva Zapata! (1952), with Jean Peters and Anthony Quinn; Mark Antony in Joseph L. Mankiewicz‘s film adaptation of Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar (1953), with James Mason, John Gielgud, and Deborah Kerr; and Joshua Logan’s Sayonara (1957), Red Buttons, Miyoshi Umeki, Patricia Owens, James Garner, Martha Scott, Ricardo Montalbán, and Miiko Taka.\n\nOther films in the 1950s include Henry Koster’s Désirée (1954), with Jean Simmons, Merle Oberon and Michael Rennie, Cameron Mitchell, Elizabeth Sellars, Charlotte Austin, Cathleen Nesbitt, Carolyn Jones, and Evelyn Varden; Guys and Dolls (1955), with Simmons, Frank Sinatra, and Vivian Blaine; Daniel Mann’s The Teahouse of the August Moon (1956), with Glenn Ford, Machiko Kyō, Eddie Albert, Paul Ford, and Harry Morgan; and Edward Dmytryk’s The Young Lions (1958), with Montgomery Clift, Dean Martin, Hope Lange, Barbara Rush, and May Britt.\n\nThe 1960s saw Brando’s career take a commercial and critical downturn. He directed and starred in the cult western One-Eyed Jacks (1961), with Malden, Katy Jurado, and Slim Pickens, critical and commercial flop (Stanley Kubrick was the original director but left the project early on), after which he delivered a series of notable box-office failures, beginning with Lewis Milestone’s Mutiny on the Bounty (1962), with Trevor Howard, Richard Harris, and Hugh Griffith. Other films of the early 60s include Sidney Lumet’s The Fugitive Kind (1060), with Anna Magnani, Joanne Woodward, Maureen Stapleton, and Victor Joy; George Englund’s The Ugly American (1963), with Sandra Church, Eiji Okada, Pat Hingle, Judson Pratt, Reiko Sato, and Arthur Hill; Ralph Levy’s Bedtime Story (1964), with David Niven and Shirley Jones;\n\nFilms in the mid to late 60s include Bernhard Wicki’s Morituri (1965), with Yul Brynner, Janet Margolin, and Trevor Howard; Arthur Penn‘s The Chase (1966), with Jane Fonda and Robert Redford; Sidney J. Furie’s The Appaloosa (1966), with Anjanette Comer and John Saxon; Charlie Chaplin‘s final film A Countess from Hong Kong (1967), with Sophia Loren, Sydney Chaplin, Tippi Hedren, Patrick Cargill, Margaret Rutherford; John Huston‘s Reflections in a Golden Eye (1967), with Elizabeth Taylor, Brian Keith, and Julie Harris; Christian Marquand’s Candy (1968), with Richard Burton, James Coburn, Huston, Walter Matthau, and Ringo Starr; Hubert Cornfield’s Night of the Following Day (1968), with Richard Boone, Rita Moreno and Pamela Franklin; and Gillo Pontecorvo’s Burn (1969), with Evaristo Márquez and Renato Salvatori.\n\nAfter ten years of underachieving, he agreed to do a screen test as Vito Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola‘s The Godfather (1972). He co-starred with Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, and Talia Shire) and subsequently won his second Academy Award in a performance critics consider among his greatest. He refused the award due to mistreatment and misportrayal of Native Americans by Hollywood (sending Native American actress and activist, Sacheen Littfeather to read his letter of protest). The Godfather was one of the most commercially successful films of all time, and alongside his Oscar-nominated performance in Bernardo Bertolucci’s Last Tango in Paris(1972), with Maria Schneider, Maria Michi, Giovanna Galletti, Jean-Pierre Léaud, and Massimo Girotti; reestablished himself in the ranks of top box-office stars.\n\nAfter a hiatus in the early 1970s, Brando was generally content with being a highly paid character actor in cameo roles, such as in Richard Donner‘s Superman (1978), with Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, and Margot Kidder; as Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now (1979), with Martin Sheen, Duvall, Harrison Ford, and Dennis Hopper; and in John G. Avildsen’s The Formula (1980), with George C. Scott, before taking a nine-year break from film. He received his final Academy Award Nomination (this time for Best Supporting Actor) for Euzhan Palcy’s anti-Apartheid film, A Dry White Season (1989), with Donald Sutherland, Jürgen Prochnow, and Susan Sarandon.\n\nLater film roles included Andrew Bergman’s 1990 comedy The Freshman (parodying his famed Godfather role), with Matthew Broderick, Bruno Kirby, Penelope Ann Miller, and Jon Polito; John Glen’s Christopher Columbus: The Discovery (1992), with Tom Selleck, Robert Davi, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Benecio Del Toro; Jeremy Leven’s Don Juan DeMarco (1995), with Johnny Depp and Faye Dunaway; John Frankenheimer’s The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996), with David Thewlis, Val Kilmer, Fairuza Balk, and Ron Perlman; Yves Simoneau’s Free Money (1998), with Sutherland, Charlie Sheen, Thomas Hayden Church, and Mira Sorvino; and Frank Oz‘s The Score (2001), with Robert De Niro, Edward Norton, and Angela Bassett. Brando was ranked by the American Film Institute as the fourth-greatest movie star among male movie stars whose screen debuts occurred in or before 1950. He was one of only six actors named in 1999 by Time magazine in its list of the 100 Most Important People of the Century. In this list, Time also designated Brando as the “Actor of the Century.”\n\nEach review will be linked to the title below.\n\n(*seen originally in theaters)\n\n(**seen rereleased in theaters)"
