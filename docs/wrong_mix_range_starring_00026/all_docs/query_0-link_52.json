        "text": "Ichikawa Raizo plays Nemuri Kyoshiro in The Adventures of Nemuri Kyoshiro (Daiei, 1964) the second in the series based on an “antihero” who was known in the west as The Full Moon Swordsman named after his hypnotic sword style, or the Son of the Black Mass series because of Kyoshiro’s toxic origins, which, in the early episodes, are not revealed.\n\nNemuri Kyoshiro was a ronin by choice with such great skill that if he wanted to he could serve any lord he pleased. With a head of reddish-hued hair due to his mixed lineage, he was the son of noblewoman who was raped by a European Satanist on a night of a black mass.\n\nKyoshiro has both good and evil streaks in him. If he thinks you are an innocent, good person he can be your champion and a sentimental lover, he also is a killer and a rapist to the vile or vain. Kyoshiro is a self-styled villain though many want him to be a hero. If it will keep him from being bored will he live up to heroic expectations.\n\nThe Adventures of Nemuri Kyoshiro is the number 2 in a series of 12 movies from 1963-1969. The film starts with Kyoshiro pursuing a female pickpocket and undresses her with his sword. Stripping women with his sword becomes a bit of a trademark as he does in several films sometimes raping them as well. Kyoshiro is quite the judgmental chap and when he decides you are a bad woman he’s apt to humiliate you sexually and when he decides you’re a bad alpha male he’ll kill you. He is a true iconoclast, whatever society most values, he despises.\n\nIn this film, a little orphaned son of a samurai makes a living pushing old people up a long set of outdoor stairs for pocket change. The boy’s father once owned a dojo, but was killed by a challenger who then took control of the school. The slain samurai was one of Kyoshiro’s instructors and he extracts his revenge in the name of his former sensei and the innocent hardworking child.\n\nAs the movie develops, we learn that Akaza Gunbei wants to kill an old financial commissioner who is a champion of the people not rich. The commissioner befriends Kyoshiro when he starts discussing the problems in Edo caused by the mass unemployment of samurai who are wreaking havoc throughout the city. The commissioner is wounded by a surprise ronin attack, but Kyoshiro foils the assassination attempt. Instead of anger, the commissioner feels sorrow for his attacker. After Kyoshiro saves the commissioner, he stays within close proximity of him as protection that annoys the old man.\n\nA wandering fortune-teller, Uneme, is a spy for one Princess Takahime. Takahime has secretly ordered the assassination of the commissioner because as the chief financial officer he has been forcing the shogunate to cut back on expenses in particular reducing the Princess’s substantial allowance.\n\nSince Kyoshiro is getting in the way of the Princess’s intentions, he is drugged by the fortune-teller and when he awakens, he is in the presence of Takahime. She is eager “to have my way with you.” Having none of it, Kyoshiro insults her by calling her “Princess Pig,” denigrating her position since she’s really only one of fifty bastards of the shogun. Kyoshiro kills one of her lovers and escapes once more to continue protecting the commissioner.\n\nNemuri prefers women who are virginal of spirit, not necessarily literally virgins, who offer themselves reluctantly (perhaps as payment for helping someone they love). He also likes prostitutes who have no remaining illusions, for they are at least honest in their hearts. Yet in this film Nemuri Kyoshiro contrary to his later portrayals, is capable of a strictly platonic relationship with an innocent noodle-stand girl. He is just not a man generally capable of liking women for more than physical pleasures. Those who are too pure he robs of their illusions; those of infamy he gladly kills, sometimes, as in Kyoshiro Nemuri at Bay (Kyoshiro Nemurai Joyoken, 1964), killing villainous women who are unarmed or otherwise defenseless.\n\nEventually five ronin meet on a foggy evening to plan Kyoshiro’s demise. One is shuriken artist, another one a spearman and on and on. After leaving the unwanted company of the Princess, Kyoshiro encounters the spearman who foolishly believes he can defeat Kyoshiro’s Full Moon Cut style by attacking when the circling sword passes in front of Kyoshiro’s own eyes.\n\nKyoshiro claims that when he starts the full moon sweep of his blade, death is assured for his opponent, so another one of the five attempts to attack before Kyoshiro can begin the Full Moon Cut circle. These guys start dropping like flies at this point.\n\nThe last of the five waits until the circle is entirely traced hoping to penetrate the stance at the end of the circle. Even though the winner of the duels is a forgone conclusion, the many assault variations add a definite pizzazz to an otherwise elegant action.\n\nKyoshiro is not portrayed as invulnerable. The evil Princess Taka sets up an exhibition duel between Kyoshiro and Lord Yagyu. She has had the duel rigged, but Kyoshiro detects the trick causing an unexpected outcome. Lord Yagyu was also duped and reports the Princess treachery to the shogun, resulting in her exile. The standoff is suggestive of Miyamoto Musashi, who in life and in film versions of his life was never pitted against the Yagyu sword, though he almost had the chance.\n\nThe Nemuri Kyoshiro series are some of my favorite chambara films. Perhaps because I am a big Ichikawa Raizo fan (who died at 39 from rectal cancer) his movies have a special appeal to me. The Kyoshiro series though is unique in the sense that the protagonist is just as evil as he is good. Of course I don’t condone raping et cetera so don’t get on a high horse yet. That said, his evil lineage, iconoclastic nature and vast skills as a fighter makes Nemuri Kyoshiro one of the most distinctive and complex characters to ever appear in this genre. I highly recommend the series and unlike all the bitching resulting from the Kill Bill review and comments, there is no blood and gore in the film to make some people squeamish—you know who you are.\n\nJPFmovies does not take challenges lightly. The gauntlet thrown down in the “review” of Kill Bill 1 must be dealt with as a matter of honor. We will address with the issues raised by Bonnie seriatim. Unlike the reviewer of Kill Bill 1, the film should be placed in context before simply spouting derogatory comments about the movie. The evil Bill (David Carradine) comments, “You know I’m all about old-school.” What makes this film interesting is that the same could be said for director Quentin Tarantino. In this film, Tarantino pays homage to such great genres such as Hong Kong martial arts films, Japanese chambara films (my favorite), Italian spaghetti westerns, girls with guns and revenge. Each genre gets to bathe in the light the director’s tribute and Tarantino gives substantial screen time to each of his favorite sources of inspiration.\n\nKill Bill was originally scheduled for a single theatrical release, but with a running time of over four hours, it was separated into two volumes (probably because American audiences don’t have the attention span to watch a four hour movie—they did the same thing to Red Cliff). Kill Bill Volume 1 was released in late 2003 and Kill Bill: Volume 2 was released in early 2004. The volumes follow a character initially identified simply as the Bride a/k/a Kiddo. In Volume 2, the Bride (Uma Thurman) continues her revenge mission against Bill and her former colleague’s f/k/a the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS), seeking payback for their vicious objection to her wedding. Thurman handles the film’s many physical challenges and she makes the Bride a believable killing machine—or as believable as necessary in a film that surfs through a gravity defying movie cosmos. She makes the most of every scene by taking the viewer along into her struggling victories, defeats, for her savage attacks and counterattacks.\n\nVolume II starts with the Bride flashing back to her wedding rehearsal. Bill, her former lover and the leader of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, unexpectedly arrives to wish her well and during their discourse, it is revealed that the Bride has retired from the assassination squad and left Bill as his lover in the hopes of providing a better life for her unborn daughter. Seconds later the other assassination squad members rout the wedding rehearsal on Bill’s orders.\n\nBack in the present, Bill goes to warn his brother Budd (Michael Madsen also in Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs (1992)), a bouncer at a “gentlemen’s club” and former Deadly Viper member, that he is next on the list. Here Budd (at least partially) takes responsibility for his actions confessing that she (the Bride) deserves her revenge and that they deserve to die. It is interesting to note that the only character who acknowledges his culpability is the only member that is not killed by Kiddo. Yes he dies a painful death, but not at the hands of Kiddo. When Bill asks if he has been keeping up with his sword skills, Budd (untruthfully) also tells his brother that he pawned his priceless Hanzō sword in El Paso for $250.00.\n\nShe arrives at his shoddy trailer and bursts through the door, expecting to ambush him, but Budd is waiting for her and shoots her in the chest with a double-barreled shotgun full of rock salt, then drugs her. Budd calls Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), another former Deadly Viper member, and offers to sell her Kiddo’s Hanzō sword for a million dollars cash. He then seals Kiddo inside a coffin and buries her alive.\n\nA flashback takes us to Bill dropping Kiddo off to be trained by the legendary martial arts guru Pai Mei (Gordon Liu). After what looks like torture, she eventually gains his respect and learns a number of techniques, including the art of punching through thick planks of wood from inches away, and a skill taught to no-one else of killing using non-lethal touches to certain pressure points. She uses the former skill to break out of the coffin, claws her way to the surface, and then asks for a glass of water.\n\nElle arrives at Budd’s trailer for their transaction but has hidden a lethal black mamba with her money. The snake kills Budd. Elle calls Bill and blames Kiddo for his brother’s death, and thinking that Kiddo is still buried alive, takes the credit for killing Kiddo. As she exits the trailer, she is ambushed by Kiddo, who had arrived there soon after Elle. In the middle of an all-out melee in the trailer, Elle taunts Kiddo with the news that she poisoned Pai Mei out of revenge for his snatching out her eye after she called him a miserable old fool. In return, Kiddo then plucks out Elle’s remaining eye and leaves her screaming and thrashing about in the trailer with the pissed off black mamba.\n\nNow all that is left is Bill. Kiddo finds him deep in the Mexican countryside, and is shocked to find her four-year old daughter B.B. (Perla Haney-Jardine) alive and well. She spends the evening with Bill and B.B watching “Shogun Assassin II.” After B.B. has gone to bed, Bill shoots Kiddo with a dart containing a truth serum and questions her. A flashback recalls Kiddo’s discovery of her pregnancy while on an assassination mission, and her resulting decision to call off the assignment and leave the squad. Kiddo explains that she ran away without telling Bill in order to protect their unborn daughter from him and his life. Though Bill understands, he remains unapologetic for what he did, explaining that he’s a murdering bastard and there are consequences to breaking the heart of a murdering bastard. They fight, but although Kiddo loses her weapon, she disables Bill with Pai Mei’s super fatal pressure point technique, which he secretly taught her. Bill, aware of the technique and that he will shortly die, makes his peace with Kiddo and dies. Kiddo departs with B.B. Later they are seen watching cartoons in a hotel together.\n\nA long movie, yes. A good movie, yes. The complaints that it is too violent I think are unwarranted as the violence is reminiscent of the over the top martial arts films of the late 1960’ and 1970’s. Like the martial arts films of the 60’s and 70’s, the violence is to over the top is comical. When Kiddo chops off a limb what is obviously thick red paint spews from the victim like a fountain—just like the movies Tarantino is emulating. There is little attempt at realism here instead it borders on the absurd (which is fine by me).\n\nAs for Carradine playing a jerk, let us not forget this film resurrected his career and proved that he could play roles other than is most famous Kwai-Chang Kane character from the 1970’s series Kung Fu as well as bringing Sonny Chiba back to the silver screen.\n\nHero is a movie so rich in content that I almost can’t bear to watch it. In my opinion, nobody should sit down and watch Hero from beginning to end in one sitting. What you should do is get the DVD of Hero and watch a section at a time. Better yet, watch each section several times. This isn’t the kind of movie in which the plot slowly unfolds. Though yes, it is one of those movies where the plot line is gradually revealed to be radically different than the way in which it was previously presented, even that isn’t the point of Hero. What is the point? Visual art painted in motion, the artful juxtaposition of cinematography with not only martial art but also the art of etiquette, ritual and ceremony.\n\nHere is the story.\n\nAs the movie opens, we meet Nameless, a Prefect (the lowest rank in the kingdom of Qin). He has come to let the Qin Emperor know that he has defeated, and killed, the emperor’s three legendary assassins, Sky, Broken Sword, and Flying Snow. The Emperor, naturally, wants to know how Nameless managed to defeat such peerless warriors. As Nameless tells the story, we see it unfold — first his telling, then the version told by the Emperor, who is shrewd enough to read between the lines, and then Nameless’ correction of the details overlooked by the Emperor. The question is, did Nameless truly defeat Sky, Broken Sword, and Flying Snow — or did he conspire with them, convincing them to lay down their lives in order to give him the opportunity to get close enough to the Emperor to have a chance at slaying him? Or was there a conspiracy, but one in which there was dissension in the ranks?\n\nThe answer to all these questions, the real crux of the matter, lies in the question of whether or not it was possible for Sky and Flying Snow to throw their matches with Nameless so skillfully that the Emperor’s own troops could be made eyewitnesses to testify on Nameless’ behalf. Likewise, was Nameless skillful enough to defeat Sky and Flying Snow by apparently, but not actually, killing them — with a sword stroke so precise that it appears to kill, but allows one’s opponent, later, to be revived?\n\nI’m not going to tell you the rest of the plot, because it is so convoluted that, frankly, you should just watch the movie and see it unfold for yourself. Let’s move on to the actors, who are incredibly awesome. This is a star-studded cast. We have Jet Li (five time Wushu gold medalist) as Nameless. Donnie Yen, who often stars in films with Jet Li, plays Sky – and these two incomparable martial artists deliver what I consider to be the best scene in the film, the duel between Nameless and Sky. Broken Sword is played by Tony Leung Chiu-Wai, who you should recognize if you have seen Red Cliff, in which he played Zhou. (If you have not seen Red Cliff, you are excused from the rest of this review – please take four hours RIGHT NOW to go watch Red Cliff.) Maggie Cheung, an actress who from the age of 18 has been handed role after role in Hong Kong films without even having to audition, plays Flying Snow. Because Hero unfolds several different plots for your consideration (and the Qin Emperor’s), each of these actors essentially played at least three different roles.\n\nI can’t speak in any kind of an educated way about the cinematography of this film – I’m not an artist – but I have to bring it up, because it literally makes the film. Hero’s director, Yimou Zhang, should join the ranks of Kurosawa in film history. Each scene is Hero is up to Kurosawa’s standards – and that is saying a lot. These scenes also bring to mind the duel between Uma Thurman and Lucy Liu in Kill Bill (another Quentin Tarantino film, though I am puzzled about Tarantino’s role in Hero – the credits mention him somewhat ambiguously).\n\nEach scene has a color theme, and the actors wear different colors depending on the plot variation that is being acted out. The use of color in Hero can only be described as exquisite, and it is something that you almost never see in American films. (Or rather, I have almost never seen it – but I don’t watch as many movies as the rest of you JPFMovies fans.)\n\nAnd then there are the truly sweet parts of the film. Nameless and Sky stopping their fight to give coins to the blind Biwa player, asking him to play on as they duel. The calligraphy teacher telling his students to keep practicing even as arrows rain down through the school’s roof and walls. Broken Sword’s decision not to block Snow’s fatal sword thrust, just because he needs to make a point. The lesson being taught again and again here – let’s not miss it, please – is that it’s not about WHETHER you live or die. It’s about HOW you live or die. That’s the point of all the etiquette. It’s not some cute cultural reference or cinematic device – not ultimately – what it’s about, is dignity.\n\nSome movies are all plot. Some are all about the character development – and/or the cast. Some movies focus purely on cinematography. Some movies push a strong moral. This movie does it all.\n\nFinally, I know JPFmovies has been waiting a long time (probably more than six months) for this review. But now do you see why? Any sort of proper consideration of this movie takes a person in a million different directions. How can it even fit in a blog post? In 800 words or so all I have done is to sketch the outlines of Hero for you. Can you blame me for taking so long to write this? (JPFmovies can!)\n\nGo forth and watch this rose of a movie, but just a little at a time, as if you were eating a box of chocolates – I know it’s Christmas, but that’s no reason to stuff yourself."
