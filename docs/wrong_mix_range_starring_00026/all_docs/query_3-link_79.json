        "text": "“Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F” is currently the most popular movie on Netflix, according to the platform’s public ranking system.\n\nAfter decades in development hell, the fourth installment in the Beverly Hills Cop series premiered directly on the streaming service on July 3. Eddie Murphy reprises his starring role as police detective Axel Foley alongside returning cast members Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Paul Reiser and Bronson Pinchot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F” follows Foley as he returns to Beverly Hills to aid his daughter and former partner. The sequel to “Beverly Hills Cop III” also features new characters played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Kevin Bacon.\n\nRead on for more trending movies of the moment across streaming services including Hulu, Max, Apple TV+ and Amazon Prime Video. And if you want to stay informed about all things streaming, subscribe to the Streamline newsletter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother police movie is the top film of the moment on Hulu.\n\n“Muzzle” stars Aaron Eckhart as a Los Angles cop whose K-9 partner is killed in a shootout ― leading him on a dangerous mission to track down those responsible and uncover a sinister conspiracy.\n\nContinuing the theme of action-packed movies dominating streaming services, the top film on Max is “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.”\n\nThe monster movie joined the platform on on July 4, just a few months after it was released in theaters on March 29. Although “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire” did not receive the positive reviews that “Godzilla Minus One” earned last year, it was still a box office smash and became the third-highest-grossing movie of 2024.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Space Cadet” premiered on Amazon Prime Video on July 4. Emma Roberts stars in this new comedy about a party girl who decides to pursue her dream of becoming an astronaut and, thanks to a beefed up NASA application, winds up in a training program.\n\nTom Hopper, Poppy Liu and Gabrielle Union also appear in “Space Cadet,” which received mostly negative reviews from critics.\n\nThe 2023 biographical thriller “Tetris” is currently trending on Apple TV+.\n\nBased on true events, the movie tells the story of American video game salesman Hank Rogers and his race to license and patent Tetris through a journey that takes him to Soviet Russia in 1988. “Tetris” stars Taron Egerton, Nikita Efremov, Sofia Lebedeva, and Anthony Boyle."
