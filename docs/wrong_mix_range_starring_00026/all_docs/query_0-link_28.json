        "text": "See it first on Planet Rock\n\nKira Mac have premiered the video for their latest single ‘Mississippi Swinging’ exclusively on Planet Rock.\n\nFollowing hot on the heels of Kira Mac’s trio of Planet Rock playlisted singles ‘One Way Ticket’, ‘Dead Man Walking’ and ‘Hit Me Again’, new track ‘Mississippi Swinging’ is another towering rock anthem from the band that centres on bluesy grooves and Kira Mac’s (aka Rhiannon Hill) powerhouse vocals.\n\nThe accompanying video intersperses clips of the quintet belting out ‘Mississippi Swinging’ in a barn with footage of Kira Mac taking a convertible car for a spin.\n\nWatch Kira Mac’s ‘Mississippi Swinging’ video:\n\nJust like its three predecessors, ‘Mississippi Swinging’ is lifted from Kira Mac’s 10-track debut album ‘Chaos is Calling’, which lands on Friday 18th November 2022 on CD. The vinyl edition follows on 2nd June 2023.\n\nCommenting on the upcoming record, Kira Mac says: “It’s been in the making from 2015 when Joe (Worrall, guitars) and I met.\n\n“It’s been a really long time coming (and we've had such an incredible time writing and making it on its little journey) that we hope everyone loves listening as much as we loved making it! I think this album has a song for everyone, whether you like rock or blues music or not — and above everything else, it’s us, and it’s honest.\n\n“The first two singles definitely set the tone for the album: we were going for an ‘all killer, no filler’ vibe, so we deliberately picked the most party ones, but there’s a few on there to level out the dynamic.”\n\nCoinciding with the release of ‘Chaos Is Calling’, Kira Mac embark on a headline tour in late November and early December before they play the Main Stage at Planet Rockstock on Friday 2nd December.\n\nKira Mac then support Sweet on select dates of their Unlock The Rock Tour and they will also play Stone Broken’s The Broken Christmas Bash on Friday 16th December at Wolverhampton KK’s Steel Mill.\n\nKira Mac’s UK tour dates:\n\nNOVEMBER 2022\n\nEdinburgh Bannermans – Sun 20th\n\nNewcastle Trillians – Tue 22nd\n\nGrimsby Yardbirds – Wed 23rd\n\nBlackpool Waterloo – Thu 24th\n\nStoke-on-Trent The Rigger – Fri 25th\n\nBirmingham Asylum – Sat 26th\n\nCrumlin Patriot – Sun 27th\n\nBradford Nightrain – Tue 29th\n\nOxford Bullingdon – Wed 30th\n\nDECEMBER 2022\n\nLondon Grace – Thu 1st\n\nPlanet Rockstock, Trecco Bay – Fri 2nd\n\nBexhill De Le Warr Pavilion – Sat 3rd (w/ Sweet)\n\nLondon Islington Academy – Sun 4th (w/ Sweet)\n\nOxford O2 Academy – Thu 8th (w/ Sweet)\n\nNorthampton Roadmender – Fri 9th (w/ Sweet)\n\nManchester Academy – Sat 10th (w/ Sweet)\n\nNorwich The Waterfront – Sun 11th (w/ Sweet)\n\nExeter The Phoenix – Thu 15th (w/ Sweet)\n\nWolverhampton KK’s Steel Mill – Fri 16th (w/ Stone Broken)\n\nNottingham Rock City – Sun 18th (w/ Sweet)\n\nBuy Kira Mac headline tour tickets\n\nBuy Planet Rockstock tickets\n\nBuy Sweet UK tour tickets\n\nBuy Stone Broken Christmas bash tickets\n\nKira Mac’s ‘Chaos Is Calling’ track-listing:\n\nOne Way Ticket\n\nHit Me Again\n\nChaos Is Calling\n\nBack For More\n\nImagine (What We Could’ve Been)\n\nMississippi Swinging\n\nHell Fire & Holy Water\n\nDownfall\n\nNever Going To Stay\n\nDead Man Walking\n\n23 rock bands named after movies:\n\nListen to Planet Rock on DAB nationwide, on our Rayo app, online or via your smart speaker (“Play Planet Rock”)."
