        "text": "Profile\n\nName: 劉家輝 (刘家辉) / Lau Kar Fai (Liu Jia Hui)\n\nEnglish name: Gordon Liu\n\nAlso known as: Liu Chia Hui\n\nProfession: Actor\n\nBirthdate: 1955-Nov-30\n\nBirthplace: Guangdong, China\n\nStar sign: Sagittarius\n\nChinese zodiac: Goat\n\nAbout Gordon\n\nGrowing up in Hong Kong, Gordon would often skip school to train at a martial arts house run by Lau Charn. The bonds formed with Lau family would lead to Gordon being adopted into the family, making him the brother of the famous Shaw Brothers director and actor Lau Kar-leung. Through his brother, Gordon started his acting career working with the Shaw Brothers studio, where he married his passion for martial arts with the big-screen. He starred in the 1978 film, The 36th Chamber of Shaolin, which revolutionized the genre, influencing kung-fu films for years to come. The marriage would span dozens of films, but with age his roles diminished along with his abilities. TVB would later contract Gordon for a variety of roles in television dramas.\n\nLong time admirer of Liu's talent, Quentin Tarantino, would cast him in the Kill Bill series. Before accepting the role Liu, who had never heard of Tarantino, thought \"I'm an Asian star from the '70s, why would anyone want me to be in a 21st century movie?\" The series would bring Liu's international celebrity status beyond that of the cult following he gained from his kung-fu films of the 70s.\n\nTV Series\n\nLong Men Yi Zhan (2018) as Shi Gan Dang\n\nElite Brigade (2012)\n\nA Legend of Shaolin Temple 3 (2011)\n\nCurse of the Royal Harem (TVB, 2011)\n\nHongwu 32 (TVB, 2010)\n\nBeauty Knows No Pain (TVB, 2010)\n\nPillow Case of Mystery II\n\nTransferred Connection Temptation (TVB, 2009)\n\nChinese Paladin 3 as Xie Jian Xian (2009)\n\nMan in Charge (TVB, 2009)\n\nThe Four (TVB, 2008)\n\nThe Ultimate Crime Fighter (TVB, 2007)\n\nOn the First Beat (TVB, 2007)\n\nLiao Zhai 2 Ying Ning (2007)\n\nLethal Weapons of Love and Passion (TVB, 2006)\n\nWomen on the Run (TVB, 2005, guest)\n\nWar of In-Laws (TVB, 2005)\n\nThe Gâteau Affairs (TVB, 2005)\n\nThe Prince's Shadow (TVB, 2005)\n\nShades of Truth (TVB, 2005)\n\nHuang Fei Hong and Thirteenth Aunt (2005) as Huang Fei Hong\n\nNet Deception (TVB, 2004)\n\nTwin of Brothers (TVB, 2004)\n\nThe King of Yesterday and Tomorrow (TVB, 2003)\n\nSeed of Hope (TVB, 2003)\n\nBurning Flame II (TVB, 2002)\n\nA Step into the Past (TVB, 2001)\n\nWitness to a Prosecution (TVB, 1999)\n\nBonds of Blood (1998)\n\nJourney to the West II (TVB, 1998)\n\nJourney to the West (TVB, 1996)\n\nThe Price to Pay (TVB, 1996)\n\nThe Buddhism Palm Strikes Back (TVB, 1993)\n\nStory of the Water Margin (TVB, 1992)\n\nJian Muo DuGu Qiu Bai (TVB, 1991)\n\nMovies\n\nKill 'em All (2012)\n\nThe Man with the Iron Fists (2012)\n\nPainted Skin 2 (2012)\n\nWarrior (2012)\n\nHigh Kickers (2012)\n\nBlood Money (2012)\n\nNightfall (2012)\n\nFlying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011)\n\nLove in Space (2011)\n\nHot Summer Days (2010)\n\nTrue Legend (2010)\n\nAnaconda Frightened (2008)\n\nHeroes of Shaolin (2008)\n\nShaolin Vs.
