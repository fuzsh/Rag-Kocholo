        "text": "by Jason Adams\n\nWhen the Tribeca Film Festival (2021 edition) kicks off in June -- it runs from June 9th through the 20th -- it will have been 25 months since my last rendezvous with the festival, way back in the spring of 2019. Some stuff has happened in the in-between, ya know? But we're still plugging along, thank the Movie Gods, and pretty excited to have this little slice of our routine slipping back into its slot. I've been here in NYC long enough that I was around for the first edition of the fest, founded in 2002 in the wake of the September 11th attacks, and already I can feel in the air a similar sense of celebratory survival. It's been a tough 25 months, but spring feels finally in the air.\n\nThe entire line-up for the festival was announced last week -- including the Opening Night premiere of this year's big musical sensation-to-be In the Heights -- and you'll find all of the titles down below. But first I just want to highlight a small selection of five titles (because five's a good solid respectable number) that immediately leapt off the page and poked me in my eyeballs. And you can no doubt expect to hear my thoughts on these ones (and plenty more) once the coverage kicks up in June...\n\nWerewolves Within (dir. Josh Ruben) -- I very much enjoyed Josh Ruben's last film Scare Me when it hit Shudder last year, with its deep focus on character and storytelling over gimmicks, so I'm hopeful that this one -- which should prove to be bigger in scope, given its log-line of \"werewolves attacking a small town\" -- will have taken the good lessons he learned from his previous one to heart. Also we're just overdue a good werewolf movie? And the fact that this is a horror-comedy doesn't immediately mean it can't be scary -- American Werewolf in London, considered by most to the classic of the genre, is also a comedy when it's not busy freaking you out.\n\nThe Beta Test (dir. Jim Cummings) -- I'll just come out and say it: I friggin' love Jim Cummings. 2018's Thunder Road and 2020's Wolf of Snow Hollow saw him writing, directing, and starring in two low-budget showcases for his own damn self, and they worked on me exactly like he no doubt hoped they would, and I'm very very down for another round. This one is billed a a \"satirical thriller\" that sees him playing a Hollywood agent whose life unravels following a \"mysterious, toe-curling sexual encounter.\"\n\nItalian Studies (dir. Adam Leon) -- Vanessa Kirby. That's it. That's the post. Okay I'll elaborate -- after her rightly Oscar-nominated turn in Pieces of a Woman last year (not to mention her not-nominated but fine turn in The World To Come) I am here to watch Vanessa Kirby act some more. That's the post!\n\nThe Justice of Bunny King (dir. Gaysorn Thavat) -- Although this movie's title is a good one (sometimes a good title is enough!) what really caught my eye with this one, like the previous, was mainly the cast -- it stars Essie Davis and Thomasin McKenzie, two of the finest actors working today says me. Davis has been around for ages but only caught this American's Essie-come-lately eye thanks to The Babadook; meanwhile McKenzie, at all of 20 years old now, has wowed in both Leave No Trace and Jojo Rabbit. They already co-starred together in True History of the Kelly Gang (although I have no recollection if they shared scenes) -- this one has them playing an aunt and her niece who're taking stands against the bastards.\n\nShapeless (dir. Samantha Aldana) -- Since I have my genre-fixations I always zoom in on the Midnight section of the fest, and to be honest I could have chosen any of the three Midnight titles. They all sound interesting enough. I'm giving the edge to Shapeless though, because it's a horror film about an eating disorder and horror films are always at their best when they wind real-life into their grimy paws and find ways to make us really feel the terrible push-pull of harmful behavior. It's also promising that this is a first-time feature written and directed by two women.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nAnd now, a look at the entire line-up...\n\nU.S. NARRATIVE COMPETITION\n\nCatch the Fair One, directed and written by Josef Kubota Wladyka.

It even has grown some more after seeing and thinking about that film. I hope Egypt will send it to the International Film race at the Oscars.\n\nAlso enjoyed very much the last day of the earth in \"How it ends\" at Sundance. I thought it was fun and original. Although later, I've seen other films with the same feeling, that has made me think, that this is the pandemic-time kind of a movieatmosphere, that this film is showing as a byproduct. But the story and walking around the streets of Hollywood was cool. And the younger-self traveling along...\n\nNorth by current is a documentary film I also saw at Berlinale... by a transman and about his family, not so much about transhood, although it touches that too... more about the family and the sister and her destructive relationships... touching and overall interesting biography of an american family over very many years and how the parents have coped with everything and maybe even most of all about the importance of a family to stick together and talk about things and support each other. Another strong one in this list.\n\nMarvelous and a Balck hole was maybe more for a younger audience. It was ok, but the story was more on the usual side, although with some visual bold choices and Rhea Pearlman. But I was tired of the teen angst from the getgo and that hindered me to fully enjoy the film.\n\nEnemies of the state documentary starts off as detective story, but quite soon you get all the keys and you know.... which basically then leaves just one question, how did the parents not see or know... or how it blinds us, by first believing our kids/loved ones and not seeing all the red flags in the air... and at the end of the film it sort of still leaves it a bit open, but I quess there is no question about it. Sorry for not being able to talk about it more clearly, as otherwise there's no point to watch the film in the first place.. it has this \"is it real or is it a lie\" startpoint :)\n\nMy top 5 anticipation is directed to:\n\n1. In the heights\n\n2. Beta test\n\n3. No man of god\n\n4. 12 mighty orphans\n\n5. Italian studies\n\nand 6. All my friends hate me, 7. Wild men, 8. Last film show, 9. Catch the fair one, 10. Novice... alll together I hope to catch 35 films during those 12 days :)"
