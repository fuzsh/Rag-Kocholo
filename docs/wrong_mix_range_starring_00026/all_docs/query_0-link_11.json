That's the\n\ngreat thing about them, though. They encourage viewers to want more.\n\nJapanese movie recommendations relevent to Kill Bill:\n\nLady Snowblood (Female samurai flick.)\n\nLone Wolf and Cub, Shogun Assassin (Classic samurai movies, and an American\n\nedit of them.)\n\nKarate Kiba/The Bodyguard, The Street Fighter (Sonny Chiba action.)\n\nTokyo Drifter (Colors and style from House of Blue Leaves segement.)\n\nBlack Tight Killers (Best Kill Bill style movie I've seen.)\n\nDead or Alive, Ichi the Killer, Fudoh (Takashi Miike style action.)\n\nBattle Royale (Obvious.)\n\nHong Kong:\n\nPeace Hotel (A Hong Kong western starring Chow Yun Fat. Features the best\n\nsingle-swordsman-versus-an-army fight I had seen before Kill Bill.)\n\n\"Ten crazy kung fu films of Shaolin.\" At least. I've seen a bunch of them,\n\nbut always thought of them as light entertainment. Liu Chia Liang films\n\nseem the most artistic to me and would probably appeal to Kill Bill fans,\n\nthough I don't know of any direct similarities:\n\nDeadly Mantis (David Chiang is taught kung fu by a preying mantis,\n\nliterally.)\n\nShaolin vs. Ninja (I Dream of Jeannie meets Game of Death.)\n\nMad Monkey Kung Fu (Just what it sounds like. Monkey Style kung fu. Real\n\nfun movie.)\n\n8-Diagram Pole Fighter (One of Gordon Liu's most praised roles.)\n\n36th Chamber of Shaolin (Another classic Gordon Liu movie, and one that\n\nTarantino has mentioned many times.)\n\nReturn to the 36th Chamber (Also starring Gordon Liu, and my personal\n\nfavorite.)\n\nWesterns: I know nothing about westerns, but Kill Bill has raised my\n\ninterest.\n\nThis is why I love Kill Bill so much. You can watch that movie, and talk\n\nabout movies for hours afterward. It showcases so much great stuff that\n\njust about everyone can learn about something new by watching it.\n\n\"D.C.

I just\n\nwonder why you feel like you didn't learn anything.\n\nAre you already a fan of Asian cinema and think that Tarantino did a bad job\n\nas a mimic? Did you dislike the movie so much that you don't want to find\n\nout what inspired it?\n\nI also have some big problems with the movie. I also have big problems with\n\nTarantino himself. This movie, despite all that, really got me excited.\n\nMaybe it's because I haven't seen an American movie that inspired me for a\n\nlong time, so I'm desperate. I just know that this was the right movie at\n\nthe right time, and I hope that other people feel the same way.\n\nIt's like when you see a con man on the street, and you know he's a conman.\n\nYou walk up and listen. The crowd is buying everything. It's obvious what\n\nhe is, but you can't turn away. Who knows what you could learn from this\n\ncharlaten?\n\nI am extremely grateful that I was ripped off for $7.50. He's such a good\n\ncon man that I'm going again. That's a really good con man!\n\nI would like to read some honest-to-goodness criticism of Kill Bill, though.\n\nIf you hate it so much, please post a negative point-by-point critique here.\n\nî—“\n\njd...@yahoo.com (Johnnie Kendricks) wrote in\n\nnews:3f8b894d...@news.cis.dfn.de:\n\nî—“\n\nFight Club over Kill Bill? Definitely. And not because Fight Club\n\nis the best movie ever, but because Kill Bill isn't. Heck, Pulp Fiction\n\nis a better movie than Kill Bill.\n\nKill Bill is a fun movie. It also succeeds on its artistic level as\n\nan homage to old samurai movies as well as anime and other films. But\n\nit is also a rather flawed movie.\n\nSupposedly it is two parts because Tarantino had too much to edit down\n\nto one movie. And truthfully, if he had made the cuts necessary for a\n\nsingle film, he would have lost a lot of the homage elements. Since the\n\nhomage was a major point of the film (and why the film succeeds\n\nartistically), it's not that hard to see why he would rather have two\n\nmovies.\n\nOn the other hand, it might likely have been a better movie overall\n\nif he had editted it more severely, and just thrown the extra footage onto\n\na DVD.\n\nThe pacing in the movie is off due to the editting. While the excess\n\nviolence is of course a planned selling point, it goes on for so long\n\nthat it becomes downright boring. I speak mainly of the big brawl, not\n\nthe one-on-one deals. The big brawls themselves are an homage, but you\n\ncan get a similar effect by watching too many samurai movies back to\n\nback. The homages also start to wear thin, particularly if you are picking\n\nup on enough of them and realize that the reason that some are there is\n\nmore for the reference than for making the movie better. There are other\n\nthings I could mention like some story aspects, but that starts to get into\n\nspoiler territory and someone here might not have seen the movie yet.\n\nAgain, it is a fun movie. It is a darn good homage. It definitely isn't\n\nbest movie ever. Unless you are rating just on violence without as much\n\nconcern for other aspects.\n\nJunkyard Willie wrote:\n\n> \"nightwriter\" <spide...@hotmail.com> wrote in message\n\n>>\n\n>> dune\n\n>\n\n> One of the greatest SF books ever written.

Too\n\nbad Our Savior matches it with the utterly lame whisper of, \"I will bend\n\nlike a reed in the wind.\" (IIRC) A halfway decent finishing move, at least\n\nin theory if not in execution, but definitely a stupid thing to say. Why\n\nnot, \"I will punch him in the nuts.\" \"I will poke his eye out.\" Please\n\nimagine the ethereal, whispering voice as you play these variants back and\n\nforth in your mind. Try other variants: \"I will break his finger.\" \"I will\n\nsmash his head into the cement like a watermelon.\"\n\nAnd, um, looking back on it with the wisdom of many more years of martial\n\ntraining, if he were really any good at bending like a reed in the wind he\n\nwould have done it long before and not gotten locked up like that. Lockups\n\nlook dramatic, but basically they mean you can't fight. The proper use of a\n\nlockup is like in Saving Private Ryan, where indeed the combatants *can't*\n\nfight and it probably *would* come down to a contest of brute strength that\n\nway.\n\nException: lockups do occur between highly skilled fighters in a sport\n\ncontext, such as boxing, kickboxing, wrestling, judo, sumo, or ultimate\n\nfighting. That's 'cuz neither person has to die right that minute. They\n\ncan use the lockup to reduce injury, take a rest, run out the clock, or wear\n\nout the opponent with their body weight.\n\nî—“\n\nRon <ronald...@hotmail.com> wrote in news:ronaldinho_m-\n\nE7CCE6.095...@news.fu-berlin.de:\n\nî—“\n\nThat's why I said artistic level, and said that more editting could have\n\nmade it a better movie overall.\n\nIf you look at it as trying to be a homage first and a solid movie only\n\nsecond, it succeeds in that goal. It's not that the bar is so low, it is\n\nthat it is a different bar. :)\n\nIt's a good violence flick. Though the violence gets downright stupid\n\nand boring after a while, I'm sure the majority who went to see it because\n\nit was violent won't care or even notice.\n\nIt's a good homage flick, with plenty of references. Everything from the\n\nobvious like fighting as black shapes to the \"slash everyone, then everyone\n\nfalls afterwards\" to things that might be less noticed like the short bit\n\nwhere the background music switches to the old black&white/early color low\n\nquality recording Japanese samurai movie music and how certain moves come\n\nfrom certain things.\n\nSpoiler below:\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nSadly, I'd say that the majority of the supposed plot is actually\n\nsuperfluous to the movie Volume 1. Volume 1 is about two things. It is\n\nabout Black Mamba/Bride having a reason to kill people, and about O-Ren.\n\nAnd I can't help but think Tarantino realized that as well. But\n\nrather than remake the movie from the ground up, or recut the movie into\n\nsomething else, he decided to go with what he had. After all, most of\n\nthe audience would be in it for the violence anyway, and might not care\n\nif there was no plot at all as long as the violence was \"good\".\n\nSo you start with the throw away death of Copperhead, and get background,\n\nand then get what Tarantino had put so much effort into...the whole O-Ren\n\ndeal. Make sure Bill gets referenced every now and then so that people\n\nwon't forget, then endcap with him, and ship it to the theaters.\n\nThe bulk of the film was O-Ren though, and indeed she will likely end\n\nup the bulk of both films combined. Copperhead is taken out in a few\n\nminutes and in a way that leaves nothing much to say about her death\n\nor her character. O-Ren's animated origin is probably longer than\n\nanything dealing with Copperhead.\n\nVolume 2 will quite possibly focus on Bill, who himself is supposed to\n\nbe a skilled fighter. But Vol 2 also has to deal with Brad(?), the\n\none-eyed woman, and Black Mamba's kid. On top of that, characters from\n\nthe first movie are listed as being in the second (through time jumps\n\nmost likely), so you should get more of Gogo and company, even if it\n\nis only a few scenes.\n\nBilly Bissette <bai...@coastalnet.com> wrote in article\n\n<Xns94148F11919...@207.69.154.204>...\n\nî—“\n\nî—“\n\nî—“\n\nI have not seen it yet.

And in the footnotes\n\nof history, I doubt it will be considered important. It is a very\n\nTarantino film, but Tarantino has done films before.\n\nSome have said the violence itself is groundbreaking, saying that it\n\nis the most violent film they've seen. But I don't really see that as\n\ngroundbreaking. It doesn't redefine violence or anything. The blood\n\nspurts are references to anime and such. The big kill count sword battles\n\nare references to the old samurai films and similar, except this time\n\ndone with better special effects. Etc...\n\nThe story certainly isn't groundbreaking, what little bit there is.\n\nThe time jumps were done better by Tarantino in Pulp Fiction. They aren't\n\nbad here, but here are just tools to remind you that there is more than\n\njust a few big sword fights. (And are mainly here probably just because\n\nit is something Tarantino does.) Etc.\n\n> It's just that it sounds familliar. One side proclaiming a\n\n> groud-breaking paradigm-shifting work. The other side not getting that\n\n> at all.

But I\n\nalso don't think Tarantino intended for it to be either. He wanted to\n\nmake a movie, he wanted it to do certain things, both he and it did.\n\nHe wanted a fun little action flick with a particular story and wanted\n\nto reference heavily certain genres. And that is what he got.\n\ngo to rec.msuic.hiphop theres a good review from someone there earlier this\n\nweek.\n\nexample\n\n\"ringo_nutter\" <ringo_...@australia.com> wrote in message\n\nnews:uEKib.756221$YN5.716298@sccrnsc01...\n\n> \"D.C.
