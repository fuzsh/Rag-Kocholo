        "text": "In 2006, Florence and Daniel Guerlain decided to focus their efforts on their passion for drawing and founded the contemporary Drawing Prize. Intended for artists for whom drawing â work on paper or cardboard, collages, wall drawings is a significant part of their work. All graphic means are allowed - pencil, charcoal, ink, wash tint, gouache, watercolour, pastel, felt tip or sanguine â except for computer or mechanical processes.\n\nThe three artists nominated, each year, by a committee of six experts may be of French or foreign nationality on condition that they entertain a privileged cultural link with France through institutional exhibitions, studies or being in residence there.\n\nThe winner is chosen by a jury of French and foreign collectors renewed each year\n\nThe winner receives an award of â¬15,000, while the two runners-up each receive an award of â¬5,000. In addition, a work by the winner is donated by the Foundation to the Prints and Drawings department at the MusÃ©e National dâArt Moderne-Centre Pompidou.\n\nSince it was launched, the Drawing Prize has been awarded to: Silvia BÃ¤chli, Sandra VÃ¡squez de la Horra, Catharina Van Eetvelde, Marcel Van Eeden, Jorinde Voigt, Susan Hefuna, Tomasz Kowalski, Jockum NordstrÃ¶m, Cameron Jamie, Ciprian Muresan, Mamma Andersson, Claire Morgan, Juan UslÃ©, FranÃ§oise PÃ©trovitch, Olga Chernysheva and Pascal Leyder."
