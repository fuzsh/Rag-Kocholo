        "text": "Ingold has used Marx’s distinction between exchange value and use value to distinguish between land and landscape. Land, Ingold suggests, is abstracted, quantitative and interchangeable. Landscape, by contrast, is qualitative and emerges as habitation’s embodiment of the history of inhabitants’ activities, projects and livelihoods. We use this distinction to argue that the 1913 Land Act effectively created a white monopoly on the production of landscape. By closely considering some of the resulting landscapes, we argue that a significant consequence of this monopoly has been the emergence of what we call the territorial ontology. We characterize this ontology as a world in which land and landscape are collapsed into territory – a bounded, possessed collection of qualities value can be extracted from. This is the world of colonial modernity’s racialized relations of production. In the second part of our article, we examine the North-West University’s landscape art collection and using Ingold to illuminate the relationship between landscapes and representations of landscapes, we argue that these representations draw attention to the world and as such form a part of the complex holding the territorial ontology in place. After demonstrating that the territorial ontology has been central to the racialization of the relations of production in South Africa’s colonial modernity, we call for landscape restitution and suggest that universities are the spaces from which to lead this initiative. Keywords: landscape, territory, belonging, sovereignty\n\nPrint culture came to South Africa with the Dutch East India Company, followed by the British colonisers. This influence persisted after colonisation officially ended, with the Union of South Africa in 1910. Many early publishers and booksellers were immigrants, especially Dutch immigrants. While the settlers were Dutch, many lent their support to Afrikaner nationalist causes. This article considers the implications of the colonial influence for the development of South African print culture, using a case study of Van Schaik Publishers, which was founded by a Dutch Immigrant, JL van Schaik, in 1914. Attention is paid to the question of how this early publisher saw its role in developing an ‘imagined community’ that engaged both with the culture of the coloniser and that of the developing settler colony. It is argued that Van Schaik played a significant role in the development of Afrikaans publishing, but little scholarly attention has been paid to his publishing philosophy and strategy."
