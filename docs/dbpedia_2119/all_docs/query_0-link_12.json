Anthropologists will find not only discussions of the discipline’s major branches but also analyses of portions of its history that rarely feature in its oral tradition – a tradition highly susceptible to “mythicization,” as George Stocking has noted (1995: xviii). The classic typology of historians of the human sciences is Stocking’s, a dichotomous scheme of ideal types: “presentists” and “historicists.” Presentists, usually practitioners of the discipline they describe, frame their accounts in contemporary terms, often seeking lessons from the past for the present: their tone may be celebratory, as they trace the antecedents of ideas and methods now considered commendable, or mournful, regretting the loss of exemplary practices. Historicists, frequently drawn from other disciplines, are not explicitly concerned with contemporary standards and debates; they show that when we read old texts as if they had just been written, we frequently misunderstand their authors’ intended meanings (Stocking 1968: 1–12). But presentist and historicist approaches are complementary, not mutually exclusive. No matter what their professional training and special interests, historians inevitably ask questions that are important in our age. They know that past concerns were different from our own, but they must also know how contemporary practitioners view their enterprise; the past may appear different in the future, but knowledge of a discipline’s present has some bearing on understanding its history. Thus, today’s anthropologists should be both served by attention to historical matters of contemporary concern and inspired by historicist accounts, which aim to meet anthropology’s time-honored goal of sympathetically reporting distinctive ways of life. And to describe episodes in the development of the human sciences also serves to reveal aspects of the general social orders within which they occurred, addressing questions of interest to all manner of historians.\n\nNHO_A02.qxd 18/06/2007 10:06 Page 2\n\n2 Henrika Kuklick\n\nRemembrance of Things Past To understand anthropologists’ concerns when they contemplate their discipline’s identity, we must recognize the characteristics of disciplines as such, including disciplines’ struggles to endure in institutionalized forms. Roughly a third of a century ago, many anthropologists feared that their enterprise could survive as such only if it subjected itself to unforgiving introspection (e.g., Hymes 1969). They cherished anthropology’s enduring intellectual and moral commitments – at the very least, to a cross-cultural purview and identification of the many ways that it is possible to be human – but feared that the discipline’s customary boundaries were no longer defensible. In a recent essay, James Clifford summarized the mood of yesteryear. Practitioners could no longer agree “on (1) an empirical object, (2) a distinctive method, (3) an interpretive paradigm, and (4) a telos, or transcendent object. The object was ‘primitive’ societies; the method was ‘fieldwork’; the paradigm was ‘culture’; the telos was ‘Man’ ” (Clifford 2005: 37). The object, famously termed the “savage slot” by Michel-Rolfe Trouillot, had a working definition that represented justification for unequal power relationships, such as those engendered by colonialism. Anthropology’s method of (primarily) qualitative analysis based on long-sustained participant observation was no longer distinctive to it. The culture concept had been appropriated by other disciplines. The objective of studying man – i.e., the human species, in modern parlance – in all of our aspects now seemed an unrealizable project, a problem particularly acute for anthropologists in North America, where the traditional four-field organization no longer seemed viable in many departments; separate institutional niches were being found for sociocultural anthropology, linguistic anthropology, biological anthropology (including paleoanthropology, the study of the development of the human species based on fossil records), and archaeology. How can we make sense of Clifford’s disciplinary obituary? It represents heartfelt sentiments that were widespread but historically inaccurate: disciplines have not been defined by fixed charters. That a cross-cultural purview is at the core of anthropology is undeniable: it has always been a defining characteristic of the field, whereas other disciplines may only occasionally adopt it. In general, however, anthropology is no different from other knowledge-based enterprises. Their pasts and presents are linked through intellectual and professional lines of descent, but all scholarly fields have had fluctuating boundaries. Nevertheless, apparent borderlines – as well as cleavages – can appear extremely important at any given moment.\n\nAnthropologists in Situ: Policing Boundaries; Restructuring Universities Just as many contemporary sociocultural anthropologists may feel that they have little in common with biological anthropologists, many biological/experimental psychologists have intellectually uneasy relationships with their social psychologist\n\nNHO_A02.qxd 18/06/2007 10:06 Page 3\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\ncolleagues and wonder whether psychology’s diverse components should go separate ways. It is not unusual for chemists to worry that their field is dissolving; biologists are seizing possession of one portion of it, while physicists are appropriating the remainder. Sociologists, particularly American ones, have been known to quarrel about whether their discipline is defined by its use of quantitative measures. How should they evaluate sociologists who employ qualitative techniques? Perhaps they are really anthropologists! Arguments about disciplinary purity tend to proliferate in times of scarce economic resources; relative tolerance prevails when all disciplinary factions have access to funds. Consider American sociology in the decades following World War II. Sociologists’ professional ideology was that they belonged to a united field: their empirical research was informed by their theory. But this was not the case. Postwar sociologists’ so-called “grand theorists,” such as Talcott Parsons, conceptualized societies in organicist terms; sociology’s fundamental unit of analysis was a social group, and individuals’ activities were meaningful because they contributed to the operation of the whole. Meanwhile, many empiricists were nominalists, embracing large-scale survey research, taking the individual as their basic unit of analysis and representing social orders as sums of their individual parts. Sociology’s two sides could be symbiotic: for example, surveys of such subjects as communication networks, mass media, and public opinion done on contract at Columbia University’s Bureau for Applied Social Research represented a financial bulwark for faculty and students. Thus, the discipline was replete with contradictions. But American sociologists could afford to ignore them. They had marketable skills, enjoyed relatively generous funding, and exercised unprecedented international influence. In no small part, disciplines’ current anxieties are functions of changes in institutions of higher education. Arrangements have varied from one country to another, but universities everywhere have become highly dependent on outside grants to finance their faculties’ research, whether these grants came from private philanthropies, industries, or government agencies. The ability to attract outside funding has become a condition of permanent employment in many disciplines (which means that individuals must learn to make plausible claims that their research fits their patrons’ programmatic goals). Related to funding needs of institutions of higher education were dramatic changes in institutions’ personnel rosters during the last third of the twentieth century: administrators became an enlarged percentage of employees, and their role has been to make higher education economically viable. They help to attract and manage funds, and attempt to make academics more efficient (no matter how they define efficiency). In practice, this means that academic administrators have followed a managerial trend evident in all manner of occupational spheres, reducing the percentage of employees who occupy secure positions and increasingly relying on temporary laborers, who work for relatively low salaries and need not be given benefits; unlike many other types of workers, academics are distinguished by having the possibility of gaining full job security – tenure – but the academic profession is becoming less secure in the aggregate, and academics’ current occupational difficulties are not unique.\n\nNHO_A02.qxd 18/06/2007 10:06 Page 4\n\n4 Henrika Kuklick Universities are also dependent on income-generating students, and in recent decades have competed for them among fluctuating populations of persons of traditionally appropriate age. The post-World War II baby boom produced its last large cohort of future student bodies in 1964. Boomers’ children constituted the so-called “echo boom,” but the echo boom came to an end, forcing administrators to contemplate a future in which new strategies would have to be formulated in order to appeal to a smaller recruitment base. In essence, university managers’ task is to minimize uncertainty, and the students they seek to attract and retain may be unpredictable in their demands. In sum, in the managed university, competing for scarce resources, scholars of any persuasion can feel threatened by those whom they see as encroaching on their intellectual domains, as well as by administrators who may cut their departments’ personnel allocations (or even eliminate their departments entirely).2 It is not surprising that all manner of disciplines were beset by crises of identity during the 1970s. At this time, the academy’s economies suffered and new PhD’s employment prospects fell. Moreover, there was also considerable political conflict in the world at large, such as over the Vietnam War – and those academic experts who offered advice in the prosecution thereof were much criticized. Thus, though anthropologists have had distinctive concerns, we must recognize that they have been hardly alone in worrying about the institutional viability and political import of their subject.\n\nOriginal Sins For many who problematized anthropology’s identity a few decades ago, the discipline’s fundamental defect was its gestation in the colonial situation. That is, anthropologists’ encounters with exotic peoples became possible through the extension of colonial rule by European and American powers. Certainly, the most vulnerable of aboriginal peoples were those who became minority populations in their own territories, such as those of North America and Australia. But indigenes need not have been official subjects of the states from which Europeans came to witness their behavior, measure their physical traits, and collect specimens of their material culture, which were represented in texts, pictures, and museum displays. The development of the global economic and technological infrastructure that made colonial rule possible had opened new areas for research (see Kuklick 1997). I must stress that visiting Europeans’ attitudes to non-Western peoples were not uniform. In particular, visual representations and museum displays exhibited the full gamut of possible attitudes toward exotic peoples (see especially Grimshaw, Mehos, and Penny in this volume). Moreover, no power relationship can be thoroughly coercive; even prisoners and slaves have developed modes of resistance. The establishment of colonial authority did not protect anthropologists from being regarded as adversarial intruders. Consider, for example, E. E. Evans-Pritchard’s frustration when the barely pacified Nuer repeatedly avoided answering his questions, driving him “crazy,” producing\n\nNHO_A02.qxd 18/06/2007 10:06 Page 5\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nfeelings that he could not resist labeling “Nuerosis” (1940: 13). But anthropologists could turn their imputed association with government powers to their own purposes. When Margaret Mead was working in New Guinea with her then-husband, Reo Fortune, she observed that they were unable to find servants until Fortune “went about from one village to another, unearthed their darkest secrets which they wished kept from the government, and then ordered them to come and carry” (letter of January 15, 1932, in Mead 1970: 308) And therein hangs the tale: anthropologists might elicit subject peoples’ “darkest secrets,” which could prove useful to colonial regimes. Thus, the charge was made that anthropology had been the “handmaiden” of colonialism (e.g., Asad 1973). Significantly, virtually from the beginning of the Age of Exploration to now, an apparently consistent political attitude has joined predictions about the fates of nonWestern peoples: though their societies might have some qualities Europeans could envy, these peoples were destined to become extinct in cultural, if not necessarily physical terms. Thus, their distinctive characteristics must be recorded for posterity. The cause of what is usually termed “salvage ethnography” can be seen in the scientific pursuits of Captain James Cook, who noted that during the interval between his first (1766–1771) and second (1772–1775) sea voyages, New Zealand’s Maoris had suffered from the introduction of European vices, which “disturb the happy tranquility they and their fore Fathers injoy’d [sic]” (quoted in Smith 1992: 99). Anthropological salvage persists – although I must stress that it does not necessarily have consistent implications. The image of a people untouched by Euroamerican culture excites the imaginations of popular audiences (see, e.g., Marc Lacey, “Remote and Poked, Anthropology’s Dream Tribe,” The New York Times, December 18, 2005). Moreover, non-Western peoples may themselves endorse salvage efforts, such as recording their vanishing languages and preserving their heritage sites. Among professional anthropologists, however, elegiac tones have long prevailed. Indeed, proto-professional anthropologists of roughly a century ago, such as participants in the 1898 Cambridge anthropological expedition to the islands of Torres Strait (then called Straits), went so far as to instigate re-enactments of ceremonies barely remembered by the oldest islanders. By 1965, Margaret Mead pitied the young anthropologist who might not be able to contribute anything significant to the discipline, unlike the anthropologist of bygone days, who had “the wonderful knowledge that everything he records will be valuable,” since “[a]ll of it is unique, all will vanish, all was and is grist to some fellow anthropologist’s mill” (Mead letter of December 19, 1965, in 1970: 305). Today, of course, the putative cause of cultural extinctions is not the extension of colonial power but the steamroller of globalization – which might be seen as an extension of the status quo ante. To recognize the political attitude underlying predicted extinctions is to call into question the epistemological status of anthropologists’ observations. That is, it was once a fundamental tenet that anthropologists were able to understand foreign societies because they brought outsiders’ perspectives to their observations; by confronting differences between their ways of life and those of the peoples they studied, anthropologists were able to understand distinctive beliefs and practices of other societies as products of\n\nNHO_A02.qxd 18/06/2007 10:06 Page 6\n\n6 Henrika Kuklick situational contingencies, rather than as natural phenomena, as the persons who sustained them likely believed. Thus, anthropologists were also primed to recognize their own societies’ received wisdom. No later than 1914, W. H. R. Rivers observed There is nothing which has a greater tendency to interfere with conventional morality than travel, and especially travel among peoples with manners and customs widely different from one’s own. It is the change of attitude towards the conventions of one’s own society which produces the broadening of ideas and the tolerance which travel brings in its train. (II, 566; and see Gellner 1988)\n\nThus, anthropology self-consciously adopted the identity of the “uncomfortable discipline, questioning established positions and proclaimed values” (Raymond Firth in 1981, quoted in Wright 1995: 65). There is an echo of this attitude in the standpoint epistemology associated with contemporary feminist theorists, whom Schumaker discusses in this volume (and anthropologists have always known that men and women researchers have had differential access to male and female social spheres, which is one of the reasons that the discipline has been relatively open to women). But standpoint epistemology differs from celebration of outsiders’ perspectives insofar as the possibility of perceptual acuity derives from individuals’ social positions rather than their choices and achievements. Contrast this view with that of Rivers: loss of faith in the merits of one’s own society resulted from experience that might be deliberately undertaken by anyone. Were anthropologists arguing in thoroughly disinterested fashion when they claimed that their stranger status in exotic places made them acute observers there, and subsequently capable of dispelling conventional wisdom at home? Obviously not: they were legitimating their discipline’s erstwhile definition. But this does not mean that we must dismiss their claims – or aims. In the final analysis, if we are incapable of sympathetic understanding of persons unlike ourselves – whether by virtue of their social status, geographical place, or temporal location – the cause of much scholarship, not just of anthropology, is lost. Unfortunately, the celebration of otherness became a political casualty in anthropology: “the other” became a code phrase for the victim of colonized objectification – a vehicle for projective fantasy. Consider historians by illustrative contrast. Many, if not all, historians distrust accounts of the relatively recent past made by persons who, by definition, share many of the assumptions of their historical subjects; but historians assume that their distance in time from historical actors will allow them to see the conventional wisdom and power structures of past ages with relatively clear eyes. Anthropologists lost faith in a defensible epistemological stance because it was tainted by its association with colonialism; those based in Western institutions felt uncomfortable defining the non-Western world as their main sphere of inquiry. Thus, in 1979, Maurice Freedman mournfully (and presciently) observed a “wholly depressing” trend: “the study of the ‘other’, and with it the truly international character of anthropology, could die in a welter of national particularism and self-absorption” (15). This unhappy condition was not permanent,\n\nNHO_A02.qxd 18/06/2007 10:06 Page 7\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nhowever, not least because anthropology is now practiced in former colonies. And when an Indian anthropologist does research in the Netherlands, she can claim that her perceptual skills are heightened because she does not take for granted many of the assumptions of her subjects (Palriwala 2005). There are other indications that anthropology has expunged the colonial taint. Those persons who might once have been classified as “primitive” may have spokespeople who are their own, professionally trained “native anthropologists.” And authors of anthropological studies of exotic peoples often feel a moral obligation – or are legally compelled – to submit their accounts for consideration to the persons described therein, as well as to professionals’ scrutiny (see Lederman in this volume). With relative ease, persons remote from centers of power can acquire the means to produce visual images portraying themselves as they wish to be understood (see Grimshaw in this volume). Indigenes now have moral authority and – in varying degrees – legal rights to affect museum exhibits of their ways of life. Moreover, anthropologists have expanded their substantive purview considerably. No longer confining themselves to what would once have been euphemistically termed “simple societies,” they now consider incontrovertibly complex societies, as well as such ties that bind as transnational associations and relationships within and among complex work organizations – all of which research loci present opportunities to expand our inventory of known behavioral variations (see Lederman in this volume). And they have moved into diverse applied research settings at home as well as abroad, including (but hardly limited to) the school, the corporation, the hospital, the government bureaucracy, and the city street (see Singer in this volume). Moving from the academy into the real world can be dangerous: advice given may not be effective, or it may have unhappy and unanticipated consequences. The spheres of practical anthropological labor may be frivolous as well as important; advising retailers about consumer behavior, say, is quite different from working with the homeless. But the “field” to which the anthropologist takes herself need not be a remote and exotic place (see, e.g., Gupta and Ferguson 1997). Notwithstanding the conservative attitudes preserved in certain anthropology departments, many contemporary anthropologists have taken the entire world as their purview.\n\n“The Past is a Foreign Country” So begins a novel by L. P. Hartley, The Go-Between, and it is not surprising that this sentence (or a slight variant thereof) has served as the title for a number of historical studies. Confronting anthropology’s history means recognizing significant differences between past and present practitioners. The discipline has roots in virtually every intellectual quarter. But as an enterprise requiring fieldwork, it descends from the natural history sciences. As such, its literary conventions in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries were very different from what they became. It was once imperative that fieldworkers open their accounts by setting themselves in the scenes of their\n\nNHO_A02.qxd 18/06/2007 10:06 Page 8\n\n8 Henrika Kuklick inquiries, describing the flora and fauna as well as the diverse persons among whom they found themselves, in order to convey to the reader that they were authentic witnesses, whose testimony was reliable – no matter what specific phenomena they had come to observe (e.g., Haddon 1901; and see Kuklick 1997). For a number of contributors to this collection, disciplinary discussions about fieldwork as such have entailed reconsideration of what used to be a standard trope in anthropology’s oral tradition: that fieldwork methodology was contrived (or at least independently invented) by Bronislaw Malinowski as a nearly unintended by-product of a historical accident. A graduate student at the London School of Economics, he was visiting Australia to participate in the meetings of the peripatetic British Association for the Advancement of Science when World War I began; he had intended to do field research, but might never have spent as much time as he did in the nearby Trobriand Islands had he not been a citizen of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, classified as an enemy alien and thus unable to return to Britain until the war’s end. Malinowski may have publicized his experience effectively, but his was not the first exercise in sustained field research (see esp. Lindberg, Penny, Sibeud, Ssorin-Chaikov in this volume). Malinowski’s most innovative contribution to fieldwork method may have been the conventions of ethnographic reporting he developed, which made fieldworkers the lonely heroes of their stories, abstracting them from their social networks – from their effectively anonymous valued local confidants and support staff, as well as from other Europeans who were residents in their field sites, ranging from missionaries to commercial traders, who taught fieldworkers a good deal about local lifeways. Debunking the legend of the heroic lone fieldworker is more than an exercise in demythologizing the discipline’s history – though it is that. It expresses as well as facilitates pedagogic recognition that fieldwork technique is socially embedded practice that can be taught. Finding pioneering fieldworkers in many locations also involves questioning what has been understood to be the international hierarchy of disciplinary practitioners. Until recently, British and American sociocultural anthropology effectively reigned supreme, and at least “for some purposes” they could together be “regarded as variants of a single hegemonic anglophone anthropology” (Stocking 1995: xvii). But this hegemony is itself a historical product. In the early twentieth century, it was arguably variants of the German-language tradition that were internationally hegemonic – and these variants included Boasian cultural anthropology, the dominant school in the United States (see Darnell, Lindberg, and Penny in this volume; see also Gingrich 2005: esp. 111–36). Discrediting the myth of sustained Anglophone anthropological hegemony serves the contemporary cause of those who are making anthropology an increasingly international discipline – as it certainly was in the nineteenth century, as well as, to a lesser extent, in the twentieth century before World War II (see Kuklick 2006). It is worth noting that parochialism has been a function of disciplinary specialty as well as time and place. In the decades immediately following World War II, British social anthropology was aggressively British, militantly patroling its boundaries\n\nNHO_A02.qxd 18/06/2007 10:06 Page 9\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nagainst foreign invaders (see Kuklick in this volume). By contrast, paleoanthropology has been a virtually international enterprise (see Proctor in this volume).\n\nSelecting Problems; Confronting Results In general, examination of anthropology’s past reveals much about peculiarities of intellectual venues – of time, place, and ideology. For example, anthropologists and their forebears were obsessed with the centuries-old problem of defining genuine spirituality, an issue that does not animate contemporary anthropology. Scholars expected to gain understanding of religious belief from comparative cultural analysis. But their conclusions were hardly unanimous. Indeed, many scholars judged that material progress led to spiritual degeneration, rather than that supposedly “civilized” peoples were superior in every way (see Strenski in this volume). The varied ways that Darwinian speculations about race were received in different national contexts tells us much about the political climates of different places (see Glick in this volume). Archaeological inquiries have frequently served political purposes, but these have run the full gamut of available possibilities (see Smith in this volume; see also Kuklick 1991a). And research undertaken for clear ideological reasons has had unintended consequences. The nineteenth-century Russian political radicals who undertook inquiries among Siberian peasants wished to prove that historical trends were inevitably leading to the realization of their ideals. Many of them were enduring forced exile as punishment for their political acts. Alas for the radicals, many of their findings disconfirmed expectations (Ssorin-Chaikov in this volume). And one must stress that persons apparently joined in a common pursuit have had different motives and effected unrelated ends. The link between anthropology and the classics forged in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, described by Ackerman in this volume, was compounded of many elements. There was the straightforward factor of academic politics: relative to the upstart discipline of anthropology, classics had high prestige, some of which might be transferred to the new field. But by the very token of its long establishment, classics was in need of invigoration, and analogizing extant non-Western peoples to those of Ancient Greece and Rome could yield new insights – and also call into question long-cherished beliefs that the Classical Ancients were the intellectual and political progenitors of Western civilization at its best. The histories of ancient empires could also be studied as cautionary tales: rulers of contemporary empires might learn how to avoid the fates of the empires of Greece and Rome. It is unquestionable that in all of its aspects anthropology had historical connections to colonialism, and many of the contributors to this collection explore these (see esp. Kuklick, Liebersohn, Mehos, Penny, Saunders, Sibeud, and Singer). But the relationships they find are complex and diverse. At one extreme is the relationship between the study of non-Western peoples and political values in the polities that would join to become the German state, where the development of anthropology predated the acquisition of colonial territories and was linked to liberal politics. At the other\n\nNHO_A02.qxd 18/06/2007 10:06 Page 10\n\n10 Henrika Kuklick extreme is the situation in the Netherlands, in which future colonial officials were given formal instruction in practical knowledge about subject peoples and museums were created in which colonies’ commercial value was made evident; but anthropology did not develop in the Netherlands as an esoteric discipline until the end of the colonial era. Indeed, in no matter what national context, anthropologists’ political views have varied considerably at any given moment and over time. Thus, officials of colonial governments often took exception to anthropologists; officials frequently suspected that anthropologists were subversives, undercutting government authority because they identified with those they studied. It is important to remember that colonies were not worlds apart from the metropoles; they were joined in a range of social ties. The successes or failures of colonial ventures had political implications for metropolitan regimes, and colonies were sites for innovations that might be brought home. The colonies presented Europeans with a variety of opportunities. Consider the persons A. C. Haddon encountered in the islands of the Torres Strait, which he first visited as a biologist in 1888 and to which he returned as the organizer of the Cambridge anthropological expedition in 1898. Among his contacts were the Bruce brothers, Robert, a barely educated carpenter and wheelwright, who befriended him during his first visit, and John, schoolmaster and magistrate of the island of Mer, whose assistance proved invaluable for his anthropological work; the brothers had come to the islands to escape straitened circumstances in Glasgow. The islands were also full of fortune hunters of many nationalities, including Japanese, hoping to become rich from pearl trading. Among the careers that could be advanced in the colonies were scientific ones, of which geology was perhaps the most notable (and profitable); anthropologists were only one among many types of researchers for whom work in the colonies became vital – both because the colonies represented distinctive natural worlds, enlarging scientists’ subject matter, and because the inclusion of positions in the colonies within occupational job structures literally enlarged individuals’ opportunities to succeed (see Kuklick and Kohler 1996). But scientific pursuits in colonial places could be quite humble ones, such as those of Alfred Russel Wallace, who collected natural specimens that might be sold for display in gentlemen’s houses (for more on Wallace, including his anthropological activities, see Kuklick in this volume). In short, Europeans’ connection to colonial power could have been nearly incidental, and Europeans’ behavior could range from reprehensible to admirable.\n\nKnowledge for Whom? Colonial settings were not the only ones in which early anthropology was seen to have value; it led to self-understanding and figured in consideration of domestic political issues (see, e.g., Penny and Kuklick in this volume). But colonial settings were the most notable locales of applied research. Thus, it is significant, as Schumaker observes in this volume, that academic institutions in new states have not abandoned anthropology because of its colonial taint (though they may choose to call it sociology), and\n\nNHO_A02.qxd 18/06/2007 10:06 Page 11\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\ncontinue to train students to do fieldwork; but new policy concerns animate anthropological inquiries in former colonies. Moreover, the reward system of anthropology is differently structured in new states; work framed as purely academic (such as that leading to publication in peer-reviewed journals) enhances status in university settings, just as it does in Euroamerican universities, but research with practical value, such as contract labor for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) is far better remunerated than academic employment – and universities may be dependent for daily operating costs on the funds their faculties contribute when they do contract labor (see Holland 2006). Euroamerican anthropologists might note national/regional differences in disciplinary prestige structures and reconsider their colleagues’ relative disdain for applied anthropology, which grew in the post-World War II period and was at an especially high point during the Vietnam War era (see Singer in this volume). That a substantial proportion of credentialed anthropologists now work in non-academic settings has been taken as a sign of the discipline’s decline. Certainly, graduate students in anthropology, like graduate students in other human sciences – economics, political science, psychology, and sociology – must recognize their mentors’ view that academic careers are best. But the possibility of diverse types of anthropological careers is really a sign of the discipline’s strength. Other human sciences also present students with evidence that should (in various ways and to various ends) provoke introspection and self-understanding, just as anthropology does in its humanistic incarnation. But their viability as disciplines rests in no small part on demonstration that their insights can be useful. And as a substantial literature on the history of knowledge-based occupations has shown, professional workers of every type have greater freedom of thought and action if they have many clients, and need not be the creatures of a single sort of patron (the classic text is Johnson 1972). Psychology has not been exiled from the university because the majority of its PhDs work in applied settings. The human science with the greatest prestige, economics, is that with the greatest perceived practical value – and palpable influence, supplying industries, governments and international agencies with advisors at the highest level. Indeed, it is notable that economists are now competing with anthropologists for a sector of applied research turf: developing strategies to reform self-destructive and antisocial human behavior. When anthropologists’ methods prove successful in solving social problems, their discipline’s prestige is enhanced. Moreover, anthropology’s considerable value as, in Firth’s previously quoted words, the “uncomfortable discipline, questioning established positions and proclaimed values,” is not incommensurable with its practical application. Anthropologists formally employed to solve social problems may be more effective advocates for their clients than those who have themselves embraced advocacy (see Singer in this volume). Indeed, the prestige differential between abstract scholarly inquiry and popular recognition is a false one in the real world, though it may seem genuine within the academy. Respect gained in the world at large legitimates disciplines. Consider the career of Franz Boas: he both appealed to popular audiences and became a (indeed, for long\n\nNHO_A02.qxd 18/06/2007 10:06 Page 12\n\n12 Henrika Kuklick\n\nFigure 1 A literal illustration of Margaret Mead’s popular recognition, a paper doll included in Tom Tierney, Notable American Women.

When he retired, Time magazine made his career its cover story, which emphasized the success of his lifelong project to discredit scientific racism (May 11, 1936). Indeed, sociocultural anthropology’s popular prestige in the United States surely hit a high point during and after World War II in consequence of the involvement of a substantial proportion of its practitioners in the war effort, participating in activities ranging from setting foreign policy to (there is no ignoring it) the management of Japanese internment camps (see Singer in this volume). Perhaps no anthropological analysis has had a greater policy impact than Ruth Benedict’s The Chrysanthemum and the Sword (1946), which guided the post-World War II reconstruction of Japan by victorious occupation forces. And certainly no sociocultural anthropologist has been a more prominent public intellectual than Margaret Mead, whose status as such developed before the war but was enhanced by her activities during it. She became an expert witness before Congressional committees, a television personality, and a columnist for the mass-circulation magazine Redbook, in which she broadcast her opinions on all manner of subjects; as she herself was aware, her academic colleagues were somewhat disdainful of her because she wrote popular works (she tried to raise their opinion of her by also writing works for strictly professional audiences), but by gaining widespread recognition she served to enhance the value of her discipline in the public eye.\n\nAcademic Structures; Public Responsibilities Rena Lederman suggests that anthropology cannot define its boundaries and mission without attention to the public’s understanding of its role: “anthropology’s comparative, first-hand point of view is expected to offer answers to questions other scholars and laypeople have about fundamental ‘human nature’ ” (2005: 56). The specific issue she is addressing is whether there is justification for perpetuation of American anthropology’s traditional four-field disciplinary structure, and her argument is that intellectually productive exchanges among subfield practitioners are results of such a structure – not just that a four-field department matches popular understandings of anthropology. The arguments made for subfield fission or fusion fit genres hardly original to our time, invoking essentialist definitions dating to the nineteenth century. At Stanford University, for example, one department split into two in 1998: the Department of Anthropological Sciences, structured along canonical four-field lines but defining the discipline by its method rather than its content; and the Department of Cultural and Social Anthropology (including archaeology), grounded in the assumption that anthropology’s substantive content defies formulation of law-like generalizations, requiring interpretative, humanistic analyses. Stanford’s administration ordered the two departments to reunite in 2007. Sociocultural anthropologists who feel that their work belongs among the humanities and biological anthropologists who feel close affinities with population geneticists are reasoning along the lines that divided the Stanford\n\nNHO_A02.qxd 18/06/2007 10:06 Page 14\n\n14 Henrika Kuklick anthropologists. But though arguments about the nature of different types of knowledge systems are fruitful material for the flourishing new specialty of the anthropology of science, I will say no more about them as such. Nevertheless, the question of what contemporary biological anthropologists and sociocultural anthropologists can say to one another has to be taken seriously. That is because we must consider anthropology’s historical contribution to the pseudo-science of scientific racism, which justified such unfortunate policies as slavery and eugenic measures ranging from forced sterilization to attempts to exterminate whole populations. But anthropologists’ arguments about race more frequently took liberal forms – including opposition to all of the aforementioned policies. Indeed, anthropologists’ most constructive contribution to public discourse was long considered to have been discrediting for all time the “dangerous myth” of significant differences among types of humankind, or “races” (see, e.g., Darnell, Glick, Marks, Penny, and Proctor in this volume; see also Barkan 1992). Unfortunately, however, the argument that biological and behavioral variation are linked has again become respectable on many fronts. It is an argument that appeals to popular audiences as well as to various types of academics – illustrating the general phenomenon that the line between specialized knowledge and popular belief is always somewhat blurred. Indeed, there are social developments that could not have occurred absent scientific advances – but did not follow from science per se. How else, for example, is one to understand why DNA testing that revealed their Jewish ancestry has led a number of members of a Catholic population of Spanish descent living in the American southwest to either convert to Judaism or to incorporate Jewish elements in their Catholic religious practices (reported in The New York Times, October 29, 2005)? Consider the phenomenon of the link between commercialized DNA testing and tourism: travel plans to specific parts of Africa may be based on testing of tissue samples that supposedly reveal persons’ geographic origins. And racism of the sort once considered thoroughly discredited is gaining scientific sanction with such recent developments as the recent approval of a drug, BiDil, judged to be especially effective in treatment of heart disease among African-Americans; one assumes that physicians’ assignment of African-American identity to persons who will then receive BiDil is likely to be based on such superficial characteristics as skin color, whereas, in fact, DNA testing often reveals to persons that in genetic terms they are not what they appear to be. Of course, persons outside the academy as well as inside it understand races as social constructions rather than natural population units, but that does not mean that racist judgments have not lately gained in respectability (see, e.g., unsigned editorial in The New York Times, “Debunking the Concept of ‘Race’,” July 30, 2005). Contemporary developments are likely to remind practitioners of science studies of the oft-told story of the acceptance of Gregor Mendel’s articles demonstrating laws of heredity unaffected by environmental factors (acquired characteristics were not inherited), which were published in the mid-1860s. But Mendel’s laws were ignored until 1900, when they were simultaneously – and independently – rediscovered by three scientists, one in Germany, one in the Netherlands and one in Austria, after which\n\nNHO_A02.qxd 18/06/2007 10:06 Page 15\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nknowledge of them spread throughout the scientific community. Late-nineteenth century scientific work had favored their acceptance. Equally important, there were many outside the world of science whose attitudes were consistent with hereditarianism, representing extravagant expectations that the quality of the human species could be elevated with the application of scientific knowledge.3 This is to say that hereditarian views became mainstream, although they were not universally accepted. (The famous British polymath, Herbert Spencer, for example, refused to abandon belief in the heritability of acquired characteristics, arguing that human progress was impossible in the absence of this mechanism.) The moral of this story is not simply that scientific findings will not be accepted until widespread social attitudes favor their recognition. Scientific findings can also inspire social movements – including public opposition to scientific judgments. Consider contemporary campaigns to portray Darwinian evolution in school textbooks as merely a theory, to which “intelligent design” (“creationism” in disguise) should be considered a viable alternative. Using such techniques as those of molecular genetics, scientists have powerful tools for establishing relationships of descent and divergence among species – defining these in ways that challenge many persons’ religious beliefs. In short, popular attitudes and professional developments are together serving to oblige contemporary anthropologists to explicate the relationship between biological and cultural phenomena, rehearsing arguments that once seemed firmly settled. Old controversies, such as whether varieties of humans are members of one species (the doctrine of “monogenism”) or are truly different species (the doctrine of “polygenism”), which seemed resolved in favor of the former position more than a century ago, are surfacing in euphemized form in such disciplinary specialties as paleoanthropology – which may best exemplify the relationship between popular and esoteric spheres, since its findings both require mastery of highly specialized knowledge and techniques and are of interest to an enormous popular audience (see Proctor in this volume). It is the very mixture of enterprises that anthropology may join that allows its practitioners to provide distinctly sophisticated answers to revitalized questions. In this volume, Jonathan Marks argues that sociocultural and biological anthropologists are as intellectually close as (if not closer than) they have ever been, and it is notable that relationships between the subfields are now being forged outside the United States (see Kuklick in this volume). That is, a nuanced understanding of recent work in the biological sciences complements sociocultural anthropologists’ recognition of the extraordinary range of possible ways that humans may live – the plasticity of “fundamental ‘human nature’.” Research indicates that individuals’ development both in utero and after birth is shaped by interactions between their biological potentials and environmental factors. That is, humans have survived over time under highly diverse conditions because our brains evolved to facilitate adaptation – sufficiently flexible to be accommodating and innovative. The crosscultural perspective that has consistently been at the core of anthropology does not permit reductive notions. It is ignorance of societal variation that allows evolutionary psychologists, say, to argue that contemporary humans have an internal\n\nNHO_A02.qxd 18/06/2007 10:06 Page 16\n\n16 Henrika Kuklick programming dating to the evolution of the species, naturally preferring to mate with persons of specific body types in order to maximize the number of their offspring. Likewise, ignorance allows some biologists to argue that persons are genetically programmed to specific types of behavior. In short, subfield practitioners need one another now as much as they ever have in order to make the sorts of arguments that are dear to each.\n\nConclusion Some of the contributors to this collection are anthropologists, while others are historians, and some essays in the collection may have special appeal for contributors’ disciplinary colleagues. But many essays should have broader appeal – although different intellectual types will read them for different reasons. All readers should appreciate the value of placing ideas and practices in historical contexts. But historians will be pleased to read studies that reveal previously unexposed dimensions of significant phenomena – the political philosophy of John Locke, say, or arguments about slavery, the perennial question of Home Rule for Ireland, the crisis of German liberalism, and that odd creature the intellectual French colonial official. Anthropologists will learn of neglected ancestors and bring a historical perspective to contemporary debates.\n\nNotes 1 For various forms of assistance to me as I produced this collection, I would like to thank Orit Abuhav, Robert Ackerman, Ana Alonso, Rita Barnard, Glenn Bowman, Joshua Berson, Paul Burnett, Brian Daniels, Joseph Farrell, Sarah Fee, Edgardo Krebs, Maneesha Lal, Rena Lederman, Jonathan Marks, David Mills, Howard Morphy, Joy Rohde, Anne Rothenberger, Brent Shaw, Mark Turin, Nathan Sivin, Susanna Trnka, Peter Wade, and Maxim Waldstein. 2 For just two specimens of histories of the university as an institution, see Rüegg 2004 and Graham and Diamond 1997. One should note that the consequences of administrators’ efforts to maintain or enlarge the size of their institutions’ student populations have not been all negative. Campaigns to enroll persons beyond normal student age and with backgrounds different from institutions’ usual recruitment bases create more stimulating learning environments. And consider the coeducation movements of the late nineteenth century and the end of the twentieth century. At both times, all-male institutions opened their doors to women because the size of the cohorts of males available for recruitment as students were relatively small; decisions made for economic reasons contributed to the growth of women graduates’ demands for greater recognition of their talents and accomplishments. 3 The movement to improve the human species – eugenics – was not invariably linked to immoral policies, since it included advocacy of public health measures, which would facilitate expression of individuals’ inherent potential. The classic work on the subject is Kevles 1985.\n\nNHO_C01.qxd 18/06/2007 10:07 Page 17\n\n1 Anthropology Before Anthropology Harry Liebersohn\n\nFigure 2 Early imagining of the non-Western world.

How can we differentiate it from predecessors and forerunners? To ask such questions is to attempt to define a distinctive kind of activity, which different practitioners may define differently. Nevertheless, at the base of most practitioners’ definitions will be the search for systematic patterns of human variation, no matter where these may be found. For most historians of anthropology, the discipline’s foundation was laid in mid-nineteenth-century Euro-America, when evolutionary theorists compared their supposedly superior civilization to other, more “primitive” societies and cultures, which they found both among their own peasants and workers and among the non-European peoples of the world. While the evolutionary paradigm was a loose one, it ordered classes and races on an ascending scale from a “savagery” barely distinguishable from animal behavior to the “civilization” of Northern Europe, with many gradations in between (Stocking 1987). The ethical and cultural value-judgments accompanying this paradigm, which corresponded to the West’s political and economic ascendancy over most of the rest of the world until 1914, provoked criticisms and alternative paradigms that shaped the discipline in the twentieth century. Looking further back in time, we do not discover a neatly defined proto-discipline. History, for example, has a lineage going back to an Ancient Greek muse, Clio; one can speak of a fairly continuous practice since the Renaissance. Philosophy, too, has a long and well-defined genealogy, as does political theory. Anthropology’s genealogy is less clear. Who by general agreement is a great seventeenth-century anthropologist to compare with the philosophers Leibniz or Descartes, or an eighteenth-century anthropologist to compare with the historian Gibbon? At first sight, we have few clues. It may be comforting to believe that anthropology is a thoroughly modern discipline, to suppose that before modern times educated Europeans merely relied on learned and folk legend for their opinions about peoples unlike themselves. Close examination, however, reveals that Europeans had valuable discussions of foreign peoples centuries before they had the modern disciplinary label to describe their interests. Herodotus served as a classical source for the ethnographic imagination; travel accounts were a significant genre of medieval writing and were still popular and profitable reading material in the eighteenth century (Kelley 1998; Campbell 1988; Withey 1989: 35–8). Sea captains, scientists, sailors, merchants, settlers, and missionaries offered competing, sometimes hugely successful tales of the wonders they had seen. While some of their accounts were based on brief or casual impressions, others distilled experiences of immersion in and dependence on foreign societies. Critical debate informed their writings; travelers reviewed the claims of predecessors and took their stands on conflicting, hotly contested views of native peoples. Their pre-modern discourse left deep impressions on philosophy, literature, and state policy. When we try to reconstruct the overall shape of this “anthropology before anthropology,” two major eras emerge. One is the period from 1492 to the late seventeenth century, which Anthony Grafton (with Shefford and Siraisi 1992) has characterized\n\nNHO_C01.qxd 18/06/2007 10:07 Page 19\n\nAnthropology Before Anthropology 19 as an era of respect for the authority of Europe’s “old texts” or learned tradition, which had to be reconciled with the experiences of “new worlds” explored by Columbus and his successors. During this period, conceptions of non-Europeans inherited from classical antiquity and clerical dogma continued to inform Europeans’ perceptions and eyewitness accounts of American and other “new worlds.” At the same time, something new was emerging: a canon of modern travel writing, which had its own favored peoples for observation, topics of conversation, and categories of analysis, some of them ways of approaching non-Europeans that are still with us. From the late seventeenth to the late eighteenth century, a new kind of concern set the agenda of anthropological conversation. Enlightenment thinkers sought out human nature in its original and (they hoped) universal form among non-literate peoples. Just as the discovery of the Americas stimulated the Renaissance revaluation of inherited conceptions of extra-European peoples, so the systematic exploration of Oceania in the eighteenth century stimulated a self-conscious search for a scientific method of analyzing non-European politics and societies. We will consider these two historical moments in turn: first, the Renaissance era, characterized by a tension between inherited texts and new-world experiences; and second, the Enlightenment era, characterized by a tension between newly acquired knowledge of the Pacific and conventional notions of reason. It is tempting to imagine that early historical actors’ perceptions of the nonEuropean world were distorted by traditional expectations or Eurocentric notions of “reason,” whereas we study the world as it is. According to Margaret Hodgen’s survey of early anthropology (1964), Columbus observed people of the New World with calm realism, marking a sudden break with medieval fantasy and legend; but for centuries after Columbus, writers only slowly discarded the “baggage” of medieval error. J.H. Elliott casts the relationship between European observers and New World in a more complicated way. Acquiring knowledge was not just a matter of casting off excess baggage. With the best will and the greatest insistence on precise observation, early European observers could not accurately record what they saw; human perceptions and the ability to communicate depend on the existing stock of cultural and intellectual knowledge, and a long process of rapprochement and growing familiarity had to take place before the peculiar contours of the New World could become visible and take their place in a work such as Cosmos, the traveler-scientist Alexander von Humboldt’s 1845 synthesis of the learning of his time (1972: 3, 18). Can we plot “progress” in the history of anthropological knowledge, moving from unfamiliarity and error to secure knowledge? As Elliott notes, Humboldt was exceptional in his time for considering the impact of America on Europe rather than vice versa. More broadly, when it came to observing indigenous cultures during the nineteenth century, learned authority was compatible with gross prejudice and systematic distortions. Missionaries and sailors were capable of making valuable observations superior to those of trained scientists on voyages; all of these early observers can continue to inform and instruct us today. The anthropologist James A. Boon offers cautions against any view of steady progress in anthropology. He observes that cultural eras such as the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, or the Enlightenment were\n\nNHO_C01.qxd 18/06/2007 10:07 Page 20\n\n20 Harry Liebersohn as totalities so complex that it is difficult to say which was the more “Eurocentric” or open toward other cultures. For Boon, anthropology does not “progress” so much as it enlarges our conception of humanity (1982: 36–7, 48). Just as if we were doing fieldwork in a strange part of the world, we need to approach the “pre-history” of anthropology in a subtle and open spirit. To deny ourselves access to its insights is to provincialize ourselves in time; to ask what we can learn from it is to expand our conception of anthropology.\n\nRenaissance Anthropology: Testing Textual Authority The first important ethnographic document of modern times is the letter that Columbus (1451–1506) sent to his royal masters and their counselors announcing the results of his first overseas voyage. It was printed in Barcelona in the spring of 1493, and subsequent editions soon appeared in Spanish, Latin, French, and German (Vigneras in Columbus 1968: xxi). Columbus’s letter is a good example of the juxtaposition of the old and the new. Included in it are a factual summary of the voyage, exclamations of wonder at marvels seen, legends proffered as truths, and an insistence on the truthfulness of his eyewitness report, all of this placed within a framework of triumphant religious faith. The imperial motive was certainly there, inseparable from the announcement of discovery. In a sentence announcing that he had found “very many islands,” he went on to state that he had taken possession of all of them for their majesties by proclamation and by unfurling of the royal standard (Columbus 1968: 191). He went forward, he dispatched men, and he failed to find cities and towns, but he found much that inspired wonder. All the islands “are very fertile to a limitless degree.” They have harbors “beyond comparison with others that I know in Christendom.” Their rivers, “good and large,” are “marvelous.” The mountains are “beautiful”; “they seem to touch the sky.” In particular, the island he named Española was an earthly paradise. The people “all go naked, men and women, as their mothers bore them,” a description that makes them neither wild nor sexually charged, but the embodiment of a prelapsarian innocence, comparable to the original human couple frolicking in paradise before the Fall. They are meek and mild; they have no creed but are acutely intelligent; they speak among themselves a common tongue. In other words they are ripe for Christianization – indeed, already inclined toward conversion (Columbus 1968: 192 –7). Columbus’s world bears the firm stamp of textual authority. The people who inhabit it are shaped by their relationship to it (Grafton with Shefford and Siraisi 1992); within a biblical and theological scheme of things, they have been assigned a place as unformed, intelligent beings who will readily play their part in the divine drama of universal spread of the true faith (Flint 1992). We now possess another, detailed record of Columbus’s first voyage, which went unpublished in his own time, an abstract of his voyage journal. The original copies of the journal were lost, but the abstract, which was discovered in 1791 and published in 1825, seems highly reliable (Vigneras in Columbus 1968: xxi–xxii). It brings us closer to Columbus’s initial impressions of the peoples he encountered on Caribbean\n\nNHO_C01.qxd 18/06/2007 10:07 Page 21\n\nAnthropology Before Anthropology 21 islands, which were formed on an island “called Guanahani in the language of the Indians.” The Europeans saw naked people, and Columbus went ashore in an armed launch. He announced to the gathering crowd that he was taking possession of the place in the name of his royal masters. Then came the first of many exchanges in the fateful meeting of Europeans and Americans: . . . in order that they would be friendly to us – because I recognized that they were people who would be better freed [from error] and converted to our Holy Faith by love than by force – to some of them I gave red caps, and glass beads which they put on their chests, and many other things of small value, in which they took so much pleasure and became so much our friends that it was a marvel. (1989: 65)\n\nIn the first hour of encounter he registered the presence of the marvelous. Again and again he recorded his amazement at all he observed. He bore witness to the intrusion of the unexpected and the new; there is a mixture of prejudice and fresh impressions in his written legacy. Columbus may have been unable to recognize or, later, to admit that he had not found China or India, but he recognized that he was in the presence of something unprecedented. His writing alternates between trying to describe it – which often leads him to fall back on traditional descriptions – and the language of astonishment. As Stephen Greenblatt has observed, wonder was one of the most fundamental European reactions to the encounter with the Americas (1991: 14). Overall, Columbus’s writing constitutes a tentative breakthrough to a new mental as well as physical world. He struggles to make old and new fit together, sometimes arguing that the things he has seen confirm the original vision that had led him overseas, at other times giving way to an astonishment that is at least an implicit recognition of something novel and requiring elucidation. In the generation after Columbus many Spanish theologians turned to Aristotle in order to define the peoples of the New World as natural slaves, peoples who had deficient reason. They were members of a horde, a chaotic mass that failed to maintain proper distance among persons of different social status; wore no clothes; the men were polygynous; and they were idolaters. Trying to understand Indian religious practices, unsympathetic observers concluded that Indians were in the grip of the devil (Pagden 1982: 24–6, 42, 47, 52–3; Cervantes 1994: 5 –39). Yet, for the most famous Spanish writer on the peoples of the Americas, Bartolomé de Las Casas (1474 –1566), Amerindians were not objects of abstract speculation, but living human beings whom he himself had seen and known. Las Casas traveled to the New World several times, first visiting what is today Haiti in 1502, and subsequently going to Cuba, Venezuela and Mexico (Pagden in Las Casas 1992: xviii–xxiii, xxxvii). He witnessed atrocities, the enslavement of indigenous peoples, and their masters’ ruthless contempt toward them. A member of the Dominican order who left Spain for the first time without an inkling of what awaited him, Las Casas worked tirelessly and risked his own life and reputation to call attention to the evils he discovered, never losing his sense of moral outrage. His most famous work, A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies (1552), is an early example of an important genre of anthropological writing, the exposé of\n\nNHO_C01.qxd 18/06/2007 10:07 Page 22\n\n22 Harry Liebersohn colonial abuses. Las Casas’s book was put into the service of Spain’s European rivals. The English translation published in 1699 promised in its subtitle to relate the Spaniards’ “unparall’d Cruelties on the Indians” (Las Casas 1699). Yet Las Casas himself wrote as a reformer who was appealing to the monarchy and Spain’s ruling class to alleviate evils that contravened their own standards of justice, and would lead to the ruin of their empire if uncorrected (Pagden in Las Casas 1992: xxxvii–xxxix). In a certain sense, Las Casas used the rhetorical manner of Columbus’s first letter as well as personal observation and learned debate. He portrays native peoples as childlike, poor, devoid of ambition or greed, and near-naked. “They are innocent and pure in mind and have a lively intelligence, all of which makes them particularly receptive to learning and understanding the truths of our Catholic faith and to being instructed in virtue; indeed, God has invested them with fewer impediments in this regard than any other people on earth” (Las Casas 1992: 10). The depredations of the settlers undermined the Amerindians’ opportunity to realize fully their natural goodness through conversion to Christianity. Las Casas was more than an apologist for Christianity, however. His writings also included a stage theory of civilization – one that arranges all peoples in a hierarchy that ascends to full civility, in which human beings live in a peaceful, orderly polity. All had the same beginnings in barbarism, characterized by violence and irreligion. Las Casas’s stage theory of social development was an alternative to theories of Amerindians’ depravity, an attempt to plead for a recognition of their full humanity (Pagden 1982: 142). Another remarkable Spanish analyst of indigenous Americans was the Jesuit missionary José de Acosta (1540 –1600). Like Las Casas, he knew the New World firsthand, spending time in Peru and Mexico before returning to Spain in 1587. Like Las Casas, he tried to mediate between his experience of indigenous societies and the received categories of Aristotelian social and political theory. Also like Las Casas, he thought Amerindian society deficient, but believed in the possibility of its improvement (Pagden 1982: 147–59). Acosta’s Natural and Moral History of the East and West Indies is dispassionate and comprehensive, a model for the kind of survey of non-European peoples and places that Enlightenment travelers would produce over a century later. It begins with a long debate with religious and ancient authorities in order to establish the newness of the Americas, concluding that the ancients, including Augustine, Aristotle and Pliny, believed there were no men beyond the Tropic of Cancer, or certainly none between the two tropics (Acosta 1604: 35– 6). Acosta also uses his and others’ experience of the Americas to refute his contemporaries’ prejudices. One of his means is comparison with classical antiquity. He reminds his readers that if there are abominations among the Indians, the same or worse are recorded for the Greeks and Romans (ibid.: 328). Many of their institutions were worthy of great admiration, “whereby we may understand, that they were by nature, capable to receive any good instructions” (ibid.: 432). In some ways, they surpass the societies of classical antiquity and modern Europe; had the Greeks and Romans known the laws and governments of the Mexicans or the Incas, they would have esteemed them (ibid.: 432). Comparing indigenous peoples to the ancients was a rhetorical strategy that others would use for centuries when they wished an educated audience to have a favorable\n\nNHO_C01.qxd 18/06/2007 10:07 Page 23\n\nAnthropology Before Anthropology 23 opinion of these peoples; for example, as late as the early nineteenth century, painters alluded to noble classical types in their portraits of North American Indians and Polynesians (Truettner 1979; Smith 1985). The Greeks and Romans (along with the Bible) provided Europe’s in-house stock of anthropological knowledge. They served as norms of admirable humanity for moderns, but at the same time their literature and histories recorded practices as strange as any to be discovered around the world. The chief objective of missionaries such as Las Casas and Acosta may have been to convert the people they met, but missionaries could also be disposed to pay close attention to indigenes’ psychological, cultural, and religious life. Such was the case with a French Huguenot minister who traveled to Brazil, Jean de Léry (1534–1613). When Claude Lévi-Strauss first arrived in Rio de Janeiro 378 years later, it was with a copy of Léry in his pocket, “the anthropologist’s breviary” (Lévi-Strauss 1973: 81). The mission that took Léry to the New World was fraught with dangers. It was the first Protestant mission and was led by an experienced soldier, Nicolas Durand de Villegagnon. Arriving in 1557, the missionaries had a falling out with Villegagnon and fled from their island base to the mainland. There they spent two months depending for their survival on the Tupinamba Indians, bluff warriors whom Europeans feared as cannibals. During this stay, however, Léry learned to admire them as generous, witty, intelligent hosts. Returning to France in 1558, he was plunged into an atmosphere of rising hostility between Catholics and Protestants. He was almost killed in the St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre during August 1572 and survived a siege inside the town of Sancerre from January to August of 1573, during which the desperate town-dwellers boiled and ate the soles of their shoes to stay alive (Whatley in Léry 1990: xvi–xviii). Civil war was the background for Léry’s appreciative memoir of his stay among the Tupinamba, published in 1578, twenty years after he returned to Brazil; his book is not a register of immediate impressions, but a reflective memoir with a strong comparative background. Jean de Léry speaks to us as a passionate, intelligent man, one who is stung by the criticisms of his mission, alive to the wonders of this world and, of course, ever thinking about the next. He does not fit the comfortable image of an urbane humanist who anticipates ourselves. Rather, his curiosity, his openness to the Tupinamba, and his weariness with his fellow countrymen make him an “anthropologist” open to the New. Wonder is one of the recurring themes of Léry’s account (ibid.: xv, xxii, xxvii). When Léry’s voyage across the Atlantic begins, he is miserable as he eats worm-infested biscuits and drinks fetid water, but he discovers flying fish, which he had previously thought fictions of travelers’ tall tales, and also savors the albacore and learns to distinguish two kinds of porpoise, including one that blows and snorts like a pig (Léry 1990: 15 –21). When he reaches the rain forest, he is dazzled by its brilliance and lushness. He writes of America that “everything to be seen – the way of life of its inhabitants, the form of the animals, what the earth produces – is so unlike what we have in Europe, Asia, and Africa that it may very well be called a ‘New World’ with respect to us . . .” To describe the Tupinamba he turns to the vocabulary of the Golden Age (the pre-Christian notion of a contented first age of humankind) and of the Beatitudes (Jesus’ invocation of a condition of spiritual blessing in the Sermon on\n\nNHO_C01.qxd 18/06/2007 10:07 Page 24\n\n24 Harry Liebersohn the Mount). Some Tupinamba live to be a hundred and twenty, and the air and climate of their country are good. Their long lives – “they all truly drink at the Fountain of Youth” – shows “the little care or worry that they have for the things of this world” (ibid.: lx–lxi, 56 –7). He and his fellow voyagers are astonished by the Tupinambas’ nakedness, and while he is still with Villegagnon they whip the women for refusing to clothe themselves, to no avail. However much he disapproves of their nakedness, and tries to reform them with a violence most of us would find repulsive, he also informs his reader that these naked women do not arouse “wanton desire and lust,” in contrast to the French women who revel in artifice (ibid.: 67). The Calvinist minister has his own motives for making a point like this: he is ever the preacher urging his audience to engage in self-reflection. One of Europeans’ often-repeated charges was that the peoples of the Americas were cannibals. Léry assures his readers that they are right to feel superior on this point, describing how the Tupinambas killed and ate captured enemies, sometimes after treating them hospitably and providing them with wives for long periods. After enumerating the Tupinambas’ cruelties, he asks readers to “think more carefully about the things that go on every day over here, among us” starting with the usurers who (metaphorically) eat everyone alive just as the Tupinamba eat their enemies. He frankly reveals the Tupinambas’ atrocities – after all, he went to Brazil to convert them and thus to improve their behavior – but he thinks that the cruelty of moneylenders who oppress widows, orphans, and the poor is worse than the Tupinambas’ (ibid.: 131–2). Although he does not sentimentalize the Tupinambas, his theology, and his experience of civil war in France make him skeptical toward European assumptions of moral superiority. Michel de Montaigne (1533 –92) was born just a year before Jean de Léry. An honored public man and for a time mayor of his native Bordeaux, he shared with his Calvinist contemporary a revulsion toward the cruelties of the Wars of Religion between Catholics and Protestants that were tearing France apart, an experience that also heightened his appreciation of strange societies. We do not know whether he read Léry’s travel account, but his essay “On Cannibals” (1580) turns to reports on new peoples of Brazil in order to teach his readers to rethink their categories of barbarism and civilization. Brave and faithful, the Brazilians are closer to nature, while Europeans are corrupted by civilization. Their cannibalism, while opposed to natural law, has to be understood as part of a code of martial valor that is itself noble and generous. “We are justified therefore,” he writes, “in calling these people barbarians by reference to the laws of reason, but not in comparison with ourselves, who surpass them in every kind of barbarity” (Montaigne 1958: 114). Montaigne’s skepticism toward received textual authority, whether classical or religious, denotes an end point of early modern thought, a radical new openness to the fresh knowledge available to Europeans (Grafton with Shefford and Siraisi 1992: 153–7). It represents a new beginning, for in place of textual authority it upholds reason as the measure of all things human. To be sure, Montaigne had a remarkably flexible conception of reason, with wide allowance being given for the varieties of human custom and the eccentricities of his fellow Europeans. Nonetheless he associated reason with an uncorrupted nature and a male warrior virtue that permitted him to admire the Brazilians.\n\nNHO_C01.qxd 18/06/2007 10:07 Page 25\n\nAnthropology Before Anthropology 25\n\nEnlightenment Anthropology: Testing the Limits of Reason Beginning in the late seventeenth century a distinctive Enlightenment anthropological discourse took shape. It did not represent a neat beginning of modern anthropology; Acosta has a better claim to founder status than Enlightenment theorists, and as we have seen, Tristes Tropiques (1955), Claude Lévi-Strauss’s famous travel memoir, has one distant inspiration in Jean de Léry’s ethnography. It is more useful to think of the eighteenth century as a moment when tensions emerged between a new set of preconceptions and empirical experience. In the Renaissance, those tensions involved the conflict between textual authority and new information streaming back into Europe from the voyages of Columbus and his successors. In the Enlightenment, European conceptions of rationality were tested against the experiences of new generations of travelers. The outlines of an Enlightenment ethnology emerge in the writings of LouisArmand de Lom d’Arce de Lahontan (1666–1716). Baron Lahontan was a soldier in French Canada from 1683 to 1693 (interrupted by visits to France in 1690 and 1691). A quarrelsome man who got in trouble with the religious and secular authorities in Quebec, he wrote a history of his years in North America that ridiculed European authorities and praised native peoples for their courage and their love of freedom. His account of his travels is a mixture of vivid reporting on Indian life and tall tales about his adventures. He strikes a new note in an imaginary dialog staged between himself and a Huron named Adario. A local Socrates, Adario identifies the absurdities of Christianity, the immorality of the French and the cruelty and injustice of their laws. Indians lived simply, freely, and happily without any aid from Europeans. Lahontan’s “savage” is more rational than his “civilized” interlocutor. At "
