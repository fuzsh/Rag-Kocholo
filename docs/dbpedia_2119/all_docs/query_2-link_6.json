        "text": "‘Skies resembling the molten outpourings of metal and crystal, which every so often are irradiated by torrid solar discs.’\n\nAnd: ‘Blackened cypresses, lining up in nightmarish, flaming silhouettes.’\n\nSuch were the associations Aurier says were evoked in him by the ‘the strange, intense and feverish work of Vincent van Gogh’.\n\nVincent was surprised by Aurier’s enthusiastic notice: he was grateful, but also felt a little awkward, writing in response:\n\n‘I shall add a study of cypresses for you to the next consignment I send to my brother, if you will do me the pleasure of accepting it as a memento of your article.’\n\nVincent selected two works with stronger colour contrasts for the next Salon des Indépendants in 1889. His brother Theo substituted one of them for Irises, ‘which strikes you from a long way off’.\n\nJust before the following year’s deadline for submissions, Vincent suffered a mental crisis. Theo supplemented his brother’s selection with colourful works of the kind he hoped would sell well.\n\nVincent’s fellow exhibitor Paul Gauguin thought Van Gogh’s paintings were ‘the most remarkable’ in the whole show. The older painter Claude Monet was likewise inspired by Vincent’s work, or that at least is how it seems when we look at the painting The Four Trees, which Monet painted the following year.\n\nThe artist’s friend Paul Signac also organised a posthumous tribute to Vincent in the spring of 1891, featuring works like The Pink Orchard.\n\nUnlike the exhibition in Theo’s apartment, this one was seen by numerous visitors and was praised in the press.\n\nThe Dutch author and psychiatrist Frederik van Eeden came to Paris to treat Theo’s depression. After seeing Vincent’s paintings in the apartment, he wrote enthusiastically in the literary magazine De Nieuwe Gids:\n\n‘Van Gogh takes things to extremes. He sometimes paints blood-red trees, grass-green skies and saffron-yellow faces. Though I had never seen such things, still I understood him.’\n\nJohan de Meester, a reporter for the Dutch newspaper Algemeen Handelsblad, was impressed by the colourful paintings he found ‘in the dark rooms of an unoccupied apartment in Montmartre’.\n\nHe hoped that Vincent’s native country would be quick to recognise ‘one of her greatest sons’.\n\nThe artist Richard Roland-Holst used this wilted sunflower for the cover of the catalogue for a Van Gogh exhibition in Amsterdam to symbolise the misunderstood and now deceased painter.\n\nHe warned, however, that Vincent’s work ought not to be viewed as an ‘illustration of his life’s tragic drama’, but as the manifestation of ‘the powerful urge toward rugged expression’.\n\nThe painter and draughtsman Jan Toorop contacted Theo’s widow Jo, who was overseeing Vincent’s legacy. Jo lent him around ninety paintings and drawings for an exhibition in The Hague, which was enthusiastically received by both critics and public.\n\n‘No sign of mockery,’ a student wrote: ‘And quite right too: my God, what sublime art this is! What colours; what fire; what a sun!’\n\nPierre Bonnard, like Vincent, was inspired by Japanese woodcuts. His paintings include this view from the window of his Montmartre studio.\n\nThe unusual viewpoint, the way the planes are arranged, and the silhouettes in the illuminated street all resemble a woodcut.\n\nVincent searched in Arles for subjects ‘as beautiful as Japan’. He wrote to his brother Theo that he had painted The Bedroom in a deliberately ‘flat’ way and had omitted all the shadows, so that the painting would resemble Japanese prints as much as possible.\n\nThe woman in this room is Vuillard’s sister Marie, with whom the painter and his mother shared an apartment in Paris. The bandage around Marie’s head tells us she is suffering from mumps.\n\nVuillard created a decorative image with areas of colour and patterns: an effect he himself admired in Vincent’s work.\n\nThis photograph shows Vuillard’s mother in the same room and from a similar angle as Marie in the painting.\n\nVuillard frequently found inspiration from unexpected details in the snapshots he took with his Kodak Brownie, which his mother developed for him on a soup plate in a window.\n\nIs it just coincidence? Or did Redon have Vincent’s Almond Blossom in mind when he painted this tree? Redon likewise drew from nature, but with a more explicitly spiritual dimension than Van Gogh: there is a Buddha figure here beneath the blossoming tree.\n\nDenis liked the way Vincent ‘escaped nature as best as he could through the extreme expansion of his temperament’. He was referring here to Vincent’s exaggeration of natural forms and colours for the sake of expressive force.\n\nAn unusual viewpoint and abrupt cropping were among the elements De Vlaminck recognised in Vincent's paintings. ‘I found things in his work that I was looking for myself... an almost religious way of interpreting nature.’\n\nWhere Vincent wanted to use colour to express emotion, the colours in the work of Derain and his friends increasingly took on a life of their own. The focus in this case was on interrelationships and composition.\n\nKees van Dongen moved to Paris in 1899. Inspired by Vincent and by his own painter friends, he began to use strongly contrasting colours. Unlike his fellow Fauvists, however, Van Dongen also gave his colours an emotional value, just as Vincent had done. He sought with his vivid palette to capture ‘the intensity of life’.\n\nThe colour contrasts we find in Sluijters’s portrait of Salomon Wolff Beffie, painted around 1912, are far more intense than when he had just arrived in the French capital. Vincent’s palette, meanwhile, remained rather cautious in Paris: it was only in southern France that he began to use strong contrasts."
