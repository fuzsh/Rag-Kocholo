        "text": "“Robert Walser: Der Spaziergang” (group show) @ Zink Galerie, November 23rd, 2012\n\nRobert Walser‘s novel “Der Spaziergang (The Walk)” has inspired Galerie Zink for the homonymous exhibition “Robert Walser – Der Spaziergang”, in which the next artists Euan Macdonald, Marcel van Eeden, Jana Gunstheimer and Natalie Czech participate to approximate to the person of Robert Walser and his work.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nEuan Macdonald presents a bundle of 85 pencil drawings, which have been developed over a period of three years at different locations. The drawings are complemented with 22 antiquarian postcards. In his drawings, Macdonald uses the various manifestations of landscape and questions the familiarity of this phenomenon. Connecting the drawings to the postcards -from the period 1911 to 1913, period referenced in Walser’s writings and starting point of his retirement in Switzerland (1913)-, serve as historical reference. The interplay between familiarity and unfamiliarity an indeterminacy of the visual world can perfectly illustrate Robert Walser’s novel.\n\nMarcel van Eeden used in his great drawing “Celia” (2006) long passages from Robert Walser’s “Der Spaziergang”. In Zink’s exhibition he shows the series “Herisau – Wil, 23.April 1939”, 2012. The work is inspired in a walk of 28 kilometers taken from Herisau to Wil by Robert Walser’s admirer and later guardian, Carl Seelig on 23rd April, 1939 materialized in his writing “Walking with Robert Walser”. Van Eeden uses text fragments from Carl Seelig’s report in the installation presented here. As it is usual in his work, the artists refers to events before his own birth in 1965.\n\nJana Gunstheimer approaches the person of Robert Walser in a sort of indirect portrait. For many visual artists, the writer, who lived between euphoria and despair, has became a fascinating person. He withdrawn himself in the protection of asylum in Waldau near Bern in 1929. In the last years of his life, Robert Walser lived fully retracted and no longer wrote. This state of isolation is what Jana Gunstheimer transfers to drawings with an atmospherically charged interior similar to a burnt house.\n\nThe work “Adieu ihr schönen Worte”, 2010, by Natalie Czech refers to a quote by Ingeborg Bachmann, but it has special validity in terms of the biography of Robert Walser: „Adieu, ihr schönen Worte, mit Euren Verheißungen. Warum habt Ihr mich verlassen, war Euch nicht wohl?“\n\nVery free translation from me, original text in German. Text source: http://www.galeriezink.de/fileadmin/zink/press_releases/Pressetext_Robert_Walser_Der_Spaziergang.pdf\n\n‘Kultur=Kapital’, Alfredo Jaar @ Galerie Thomas Schulte, April 29th, 2012 => Gallery Weekend-1\n\nGalerie Thomas Schulte shows a new neon work by Chilean artist Alfredo Jaar in the gallery’s Corner Space.\n\nAlfredo Jaar makes far-reaching connections in his works between the levels of ethics and aesthetics. Jaar frequently works with quasi-documentary images, which he presents in light boxes and which engage with the discrepancy between First and Third World and its presentation in the media. The architecture and spatial setting are also of great importance to the artist. In his installations, Jaar constantly explores the most varied image and text combinations, thereby sounding the depths of social phenomena. His neon lettering works also testify to this. The forceful, glaring lettering immediately draw the viewer’s attention, inviting him to reflect on their complex meaning.\n\nThe lettering in his latest work, Kultur=Kapital, makes reference to Joseph Beuys’ claim “kunst=kapital“. Throughout his oeuvre, Beuys repeatedly engaged with the issue of how art co-shaped society and politics, and was of the opinion that the creativity of each individual person represented the capital, and with it also the potential, of a society. Ultimately, Beuys condensed his complex theories in a formulaic equation that, in the form of multiples, became the bearer of his ideas.\n\nJaar’s neon work broadens the citation to include the concept of culture. Both concepts are inseparably linked by the equal sign and are mutually dependent. Within a social model, capital supports culture, while, vice versa, culture should be an essential part of our social capital. Particularly in times of financial crisis, when ever larger savings are being made in the culture budget, Jaar would like to point out that culture represents a society’s true capital.\n\nIn addition to his allusion to Joseph Beuys, Jaar also references his own installation The Marx Lounge, implemented for the first time within the framework of the 2010 Liverpool Biennial and subsequently exhibited in 2011 at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam and the Centro Andaluz de Arte Contemporaneo in Seville. For that work Jaar filled a reading room exclusively with writings by Karl Marx and other authors who, today, still question the capitalist system.\n\n28 April – 23 June 2012\n\nText source: http://www.galeriethomasschulte.de/index_site.html\n\n‘Alles auf Anfang. Bitte’, Birgit Brenner @ Galerie EIGEN + ART, May 10th, 2012\n\nBirgit Brenner’s works set in where the banalities of everyday life begin: unemployment, loneliness, status symbols and social decline or the fear of aging are topics that recur continually in her room-filling installations. With everyday situations the artist addresses very familiar societal fears in scenes that take place in inner monologues of the protagonists or between couples. What do we believe in today? Do prayers help or rather a plastic surgeon?\n\nThe cinematically told stories are spread like fragmented stage directions also over her expansive collages which she develops out of the installative works in a space and condenses in the two-dimensionality of the collage to a sequence, a multi-cross-faded still. By the means of drawings, photography and text, Birgit Brenner not only assembles diverse media on one surface, but also multiple realities as quickly-sketched pictures of the monotony of daily life up to the collapse. The works appear nearly overloaded, pieced up from fragments that don’t seem to match at first sight but still they tell a story that the viewer can decipher in a different way time and again deprived of any hints to the identities of the protagonists.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThe magnitude of information one is simultaneously bombarded with thanks to the means of modern technology is both a blessing and a curse for Birgit Brenner. A blessing, because one gets immediate access to the desired information, a curse because one can neither filter nor proceed the lot. This may lead to a lack of empathy, exhaustion or the possibility of manipulation through the generation of fear.\n\nBirgit Brenner addresses this issue with the principle of collage, in which most diverse pieces and parts of information randomly concur, overlap, cover or complete one another. In Brenner’s collages this happens using raw materials such as brown cardboard, tape, staples and markers.\n\nThe scenes of everyday life Birgit Brenner has worked into the collages in her current exhibition “Alles auf Anfang. Bitte.” (All back to start. Please.”) turn around gold chains, tuned up cars with sports rims to the packaging of hormonal drugs prescribed against anxiety: Plain and cynical short stories about the human existence in its most trivial states.\n\n10 May 2012 – 15 June 2012\n\nText source: http://www.eigen-art.com/index.php?article_id=761&clang=1&detail=9191&back=8\n\n‘Detail’, group show @ Galerie Open, April 5th, 2012\n\nA small, nondescript detail catches our eye; arrests us momentarily. Caught up in the moment, we stand and gaze at the scene or the image. But which fragment is it, and why? In the exhibition Detail, Florian Japp, Madeline Stillwell and Peter Truschner show which moments of their perception influence their practice. Installations, collages and photographs explore how the fragmentary and fleeting reflects a wider reality.\n\nFlorian Japp (born 1971) likes to tease. Taking Franz West as his starting point, he constructs obviously non-functional large-scale sculptures in acid shades of bright. While associations with the gym (nets, balls, ropes, poles) are intended to frame the piece, these remain fragmentary. The viewer is left bemused, caught trying to imbue the pieces with functionality, but losing himself in the artist’s puzzle. The action of the pieces is thus restricted to the imagination, and one is left meandering in a slightly malfunctioning parallel universe.\n\nPeter Truschner’s (born 1967) photographs resemble film stills with highly-saturated colours and seemingly casual compositions, fragments excised from a much grander narrative. Truschner is a highly-regarded author, and his flair for the narrative spills over into his photographic practice. His focus is on the quietly grotesque: butchered carcasses contrast with the harmonious assemblage of a mid-day meal, the restful repose of a trader among the cluttered debris of the street. In the series Glue Trushner investigates the images come together with the personal experiences and associations of the viewer to form the delicate web which unites the depicted narratives.\n\nMadeline Stillwell’s (born 1978) delicate collages take their life from sculptural remnants of city detritus. Decoupages taken from fragmental photographs of decaying machinery, rusting shutters or derelict outbuildings, their colours softened through wind and exposure, resemble fantastical machines. Objects are thus re-infused with life, but removed from representation, their origins no longer apparent. Stillwell thus hints at a wider reality, but leaves the viewer caught between the work’s constitutive elements and the alternative reality they suggest.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThe exhibition runs from 6th April to May 26th.\n\nText source: http://galerie-open.net/exhibition/view/2306\n\n‘Gravity, Money, Concrete, Fabric’, Group show @ Galerie Suvi Lehtinen, March 30th, 2012\n\nGalerie Suvi Lehtinen present Gravity, Money, Concrete, Fabric, an exhibition that creates an encounter with an array of different media and examines matter as dynamic, significant and tense. Approaching the world as an assemblage where there are no innocent and self-evident objects and in which the agents are not always human.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nChador-dadar by Haleh Anvari, Live installation documentation, slide show\n\nIf the chador is the icon for Iran, let it meet the icons for some other nations. Chado- dadar became a live installation in every city it was photographed and ultimately revealed as much about the nature of the people it visited that it did about itself. We made it to Dubai, to Taj- Mahal, the Amber Fort in Jaipur,we went to London and joined a peace protest, we visited Big Ben, then onto Paris, the Louvre, where we were thrown out because the Hejab is a hot button issue and to Istanbul where the only model I could find wouldn’t wear the Chador because she was a secularist, so in Istanbul I became a model and she photographed!\n\nIhr könnt auch scheitern (You can also fail) by Sarah Michelle Harrison & Lydia Hymen, video.\n\nThe works deal with the disindentification, with the production of the self as a distinct individual and the value of systems of cultural capital. In the video, a human body undresses itself from different things and identities while staying thing-like itself.\n\nSticks: class B by Martin Kohout, different sticks made of aluminium, rubber, leather and other materials – varios lengths-.\n\nThis series of fairly similar sticks have handles with straps that you could slip around the hand as with a ski pole. In order to get s better grip, in order to fail: flail the air, exercise, produce pain, produce pleasure, break something. They seem pleasant to be hold, it is hard to resist touching them (because one must touch the handle). However they scape a particular use, they are tools for nothing or they are just almost: almost whips, almost sports equipments.\n\nContemplating the concept of trust-A script for a lecture by Mikko Kuorinki & Topi Äikäs, booklet, 10cm3 of matter, possibly for practical use, concrete.\n\nIt is a script for a performance that took place in Pori, Finland. It deals with trust: how it is born, what its conditions are and its necessity for being able to act. The performer must trust the audience and the audience the perfomer, but also there must be trust for the structures in the performance space, that the concrete around endures. In addition, the work examines the relation between money and trust as well as money as a requirement for artistic activity (that money comes from grants and fees, but mostly from other jobs or family)\n\nJuego de Cama by Almudena Lobera, ink, pencil and collage on paper 34,2 x 25,5.\n\nIn Almudena Lobera’s drawing, Juego de cama there is a small trampoline and above it a cloth that gums on the trampoline or is about to land on it for the first time. The trampoline is static and looks almost like an instruction picture: here is a trampoline. It is anchored into gravity and the vibration and elasticity of the mat are always attached to the metal frame. It enables the movements of other things and bodies while staying tightly attached to the ground. In the work, the cloth bundles, opens, flutters and jumps, merging into the air, almost without gravity, nearly a ghost. It carries with it the art story of portraying folds (not the manual, never). There is a tense relationship between the trampoline and the both, they act and move in relation to one another (the movement has either just happened or is about to happen and almost inevitably repeats itself, it is a feature of the trampoline). In Lobera’s drawing, the trampoline and the cloth are material agents, their thingness is vibrant.\n\nCurated by Vappu Jalonen\n\nMarch 31 – April 21, 2012\n\nText source: http://www.galerielehtinen.com/, hard copied catalogue at the exhibition and artists web sites: Haleh Anvari, http://www.halehanvari.com. Almudena Lobera, http://www.almudenalobera.com\n\nRobert Polidori @ CWC GALLERY, March 29th, 2012\n\nFeudal splendour and colourful patina – Robert Polidori’s search for vestiges of the past in the Palace of Versailles, the Kremlin and Havanna\n\nThe comprehensive exhibition will allow for an in-depth look into Robert Polidori’s impressive oeuvre. Fascinating photographs of the Palace of Versailles, the Kremlin and the Cuban capital Havanna will be presented next to selected works from the series »Zones of Exclusion: Pripyat and Chernobyl« and »After the Flood« with photographs from New Orleans after hurricane »Katrina«. In addition to these series, the exhibition will feature selected architectural photographs by Robert Polidori from New York, Los Angeles and Berlin.\n\nThe focus of the exhibition is on Polidori’s extensive photographic documentation of the rebuilding and restauration of the Palace of Versailles which he followed for over 25 years. The magnificent rooms, the elaborate renovation work on the palace during the 1980s and the portraits of noblemen and -women in golden frames that constitute Polidori’s subjects give the viewer an idea of the past of this historic place, conserving it meticulously. At the same time, history coalesces with the present and allows for a new aesthetic experience of this lavishly adorned, regally decorated and yet forgotten world. The fractals of his photographs, moreover in the paintings, make the work even brighter.\n\nGold embellishments, polished wood inlays and glittering chandeliers as far as the eye can see characterize Polidori’s photographs of the Kremlin in Moscow, which used to be the home of the of czars and other rulers and is the seat of the Russian government again today. These complex, quiet images complete the circle between yesterday and today.\n\nThe ravages of time are also evident in Polidori’s photographs from Havanna. They depict crumbling, flaking, cracking structures, while simultaneously fascinating the viewer with their brilliant, rich colours and contrasts.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nTraces of history in Robert Polidori’s architectural photography\n\nPolidori’s photographs are distinguished by their graceful silence, their precise aesthetic composition and their colourful complexity and power. Though printed in very large formats, the images do not sacrifice their accuracy of detail, which allows the viewer to almost sense the structure of shapes and surfaces through his eyes: the complex photographs let us experience the pictured spaces in a new way.\n\nThe point of contact between old and new is a recurring motive in Polidori’s work. The rooms that he photographs, although completey void of any human presence, tell their manifold stories through their unique patina and their palatial splendour. In 2009, he photographed the »Neues Museum« in Berlin, which was elaborately restored and redesigned by British architect David Chipperfield, adding new features to the old structures while deliberately conserving those parts in which the ravages of time were clearly visible.\n\nPolidori’s testimony to destruction: Nuclear exclusion zones and natural disasters\n\nIn his work, Robert Polidori also documents the often devastating effects of human interference with the environment, as he did in his photo series about the nuclear reactor disaster in Chernobyl. He has also portrayed the disastrous damage done to the city of New Orleans by hurricane »Katrina« in 2005. Selected works from both series will be presented in the exhibition. Polidori, portraying not only the palaces of the world, but also scenes of destruction and tragedy, thus uses architectural photography as a means to make the recipient think about the pictured places in a different way. His photographs of the Hotel Ambassador in Los Angeles, one of which will be shown in the exhibition, can be read in a similar way. The hotel won notoriety when it became the scene of the assassination of Robert Kennedy in 1968. It was torn down in 2005.\n\nPolidori’s substantial oeuvre has also been featued in several publications, among others the three-volume photo book »Parcours Muséologique Revisité« with the monumental photographic documentation of the Palace of Versailles, which was awarded the Liliane Bettencourt Prix de la Photographie.\n\nFour rooms, 500 m2 exhibition space, CWC (CAMERA WORK CONTEMPORARY) GALLERY is the second gallery in a Berlin building that is steeped in history: the Ehemalige Jüdische Mädchenschule Berlin (former Jewish girls’ school). The construction by architect Alexander Beer was finished in 1928, its facade combining features of late expressionism and New Objectivity. CWC GALLERY, in keeping with the name CAMERA WORK CONTEMPORARY, will show contemporary positions in photography, painting and sculpture in comprehensive retrospectives, conceptual group exhibitions or cooperations with private collectors and art institutions. The elegance and purism visible on the outside of the building are mirrored in the four spacious, well-lit rooms on the first floor as well as in the generous hallways of the CWC GALLERY. A reduced, stylish design, a sophisticated arrangement and a clear language of form produce a unique atmosphere, in which the ample spaces take full effect in allowing the visitor to enjoy an exceptional experience of reception.\n\nFebruary 10 – April 21, 2012\n\nText source: http://www.camerawork.de/lang-en/photographen-cw-editor-153/195-robert-polidori.html"
