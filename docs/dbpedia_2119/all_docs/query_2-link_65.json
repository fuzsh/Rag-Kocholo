        "text": "Hey Everyone!\n\nI’m Chanel van Eeden, I’ve met quite a few people here at DMS over the past year and have had a wonderful time getting to know the team and facility. It’s truly a remarkable space and environment to grow and progress in. It’s taken me some time to figure out exactly what classes I could teach that would give back as much as possible, but I finally feel that I have it figured out.\n\nA little bit about my background, I started my Undergraduate University studies at Texas A&M as a Visualization major, Pixar often hires animators from there. I eventually began to crave a more artistic environment and transferred to the Savannah College of Art and Design in Georgia. While there, I studied as an Illustration major, eventually transitioning into Interactive Design and Game Development. Both are really great programs with Graduate level degrees if anyone is interested in furthering their education at SCAD, please reach out.\n\nPost graduation at SCAD, I was accepted into the world renowned Royal College of Art in London, UK. It’s ranked as the best art and design school in the world and is absolutely fantastic in many ways. I began my graduate studies as a Global Innovation Design major, eventually switching into Information Experience Design. Both programs are fantastic. I favored IED and highly recommend it, although the original creator has now left the program, he is my best friend. I can share some of his and other lecturer’s work if there is an interest here. I left with a Postgraduate Diploma in Information Experience Design from the RCA.\n\nI’m currently taking on part-time roles but am also in the process of applying to schools for a Master’s Degree in order to teach at University level and conduct research. So this series of classes will be my very first official attempt at teaching a course. I am very excited about this and am aiming to make it the best I possibly can. I’ve tutored many of my peers on many different subjects while in school and after graduation, so these classes encompass my favorite subjects thus far.\n\nBelow is the current high-level list of themes that I am planning to teach here at DMS on Interactive Installations (II):\n\nII 100 History, Purpose, and Planning\n\nII 200 Tools & Methods\n\nII 300 Capstones and Mileage\n\nII 400 Senior Exhibition\n\nPlease comment below with your email or any contact information if you are interested or would like to collaborate in some way for the series and I will keep in touch!\n\nI have a few questions for whoever is able to answer.\n\nWhat category would these topics best fit under? I’m considering Digital Media but that isn’t always going to be the case. Is there any way we can add an “Immersive Experience” category?\n\nAnother question is where is a space where an installation could be kept up for a week? Is there any way to book an installation space for a week’s time? We can use whatever spatial restrictions are required, there will be a weekly group activity involving a group installation. It would be great if we could designate a corner somewhere for a week for installations.\n\nThanks. I’ll add an outline for clarity below."
