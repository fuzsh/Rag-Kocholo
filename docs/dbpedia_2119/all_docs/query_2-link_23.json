        "text": "For many years Marcel van Eeden (1965) has been working on an impressive body of work consisting of virtuoso black and white drawings after visual material from the period before he was born. Recently he has been producing series of drawings that fall within specific categories. For instance, he has made series about ships, occultism, airplanes and explosions. In this exhibition he is showing a series about dreams. Several scenes are combined within one drawing, resembling a dream in which one image naturally flows into the other.\n\nJohan Gustavsson (1978) draws rooms that are viewed from above. This birds-eye perspective creates distance, like observing a room while having an out-of-body experience. Photographs made by the artist himself often form the basis for his drawings. For this reason they regularly feature Johan Gustavssonâ€™s studio and his everyday surroundings. Very concisely he draws skirting boards, ceiling and furniture as a setting for an often curious and uncomfortable scene featuring the artist himself and usually one or two others."
