        "text": "Verena Kaspar-Eisert, 1981, studied art history in Vienna with a focus on contemporary fine arts and photography. Since 2003 she has been curating and organising exhibitions. 2005 to 2011 she was exhibition manager and curator at Kunstraum Niederösterreich in Vienna. From 2011 to 2014 she was director of the Galerie OstLicht, in addition from 2012 to 2014 she was director of the private Fotomuseum WestLicht, Vienna. Since 2014 she has been curator at KUNST HAUS WIEN where she realised exhibitions such as “Visions of Nature”, “Über Leben am Land”, „Martin Parr. A Photographic Journey“, „Joel Meyerowitz. Retrospektive“ or „Rinko Kawauchi. Illuminance“. She is an expert in portfolio reviews, organizes workshops and is a member of various juries.\n\nPhilipp Goldbach, 1978, lives and works in Cologne, Germany. He studied art (photography) and art history, philosophy and sociology in Cologne. He got his PHD in 2016. His sculptural, photographical and text based work are referring the history of technical writing and memory media as well as cognitive and material aspects of working processes in the field of tension between physical human production and machine made production.\n\nPhilipp Goldbach received inter alia the Vordemberge Gildewart scholarship and the Ars Viva Prize. His PHD thesis ‚Foto/grafie. Motiv und Metapher der Schrift in der Fotografie‘ was published 2018 by Wilhelm Fink Publishers. Goldbachs work can be found in the collections of Museum Folkwang, Hessisches Landesmuseum Wiesbaden and Mudam, Luxemburg. Since 2017 he is teaching at the Leiden University Centre for the Arts in Society (LUCAS).\n\nBernd Ribbeck, born in 1974, lives and works in Berlin. With geometric forms such as circles, curves, rhombuses, and triangles, his small format abstract paintings introduce a fascinating depth and an aura of color and form. The highly complex compositions of layerings and lines are the result of an intense painting process. In his dense paintings Ribbeck reflects various aesthetical strategies of modernism, and over the course of time he has established his own abstract painting universe. In 2016 a survey of Bernd Ribbeck’s work was shown at Haus Konstruktiv, Zürich in Kooperation with the Wilhelm-Hack-Museum, Ludwigshafen. His work has also been presented internationally in various gallery shows, most recently at Mehdi Chouakri in Berlin. In Switzerland he is represented by Peter Kilchmann Gallery.\n\nAndreas Korte, born 1969, Augsburg, Germany graduated from the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf in 1998. His practice developed to include a wide range of media, including painting, video and sound-art, with a focus on the intersection of art and architecture. His works have been widely exhibited and are in major public and private collections.\n\nCurrently he is Head of Exhibitions at the Julia Stoschek Collection, one of the world´s most important collections of time-based media art. Over the last ten years he has developed and managed numerous exhibitions and projects in Düsseldorf, Berlin and abroad.\n\nTobias Zielony, born in 1973 in Wuppertal, Germany, studied Documentary Photography at the University of Wales, Newport, before he continued with artistic photography at the Academy of Fine Arts Leipzig under Timm Rautert in 2001. Tobias Zielony is known for his photographic depiction of juvenile minorities in suburban areas – a subject he already set out with during his studies in Newport. For his first book project “Behind the Block” (2004) he then extended his research to a total of four European cities to observe adolescents in public spaces often during night times. Themes and social realities his research touches upon include structural change, migration and drug abuse, as well as sexwork as shown in “Big Sexyland” (2006-2008) and “Jenny, Jenny” (2013). For “Manitoba” (2009-2011) Tobias Zielony spent time with adolescents of indigenous origins living in Winnipeg and the province of Manitoba, Canada. His critical approach to documentarism manifests in a specific aesthetic and relationship with fiction. People are often portrayed in a casual fashion that is sensitive of the visual language, gestures and poses a person uses to set their stage. In 2015 the artist participated at a group show for the German Pavilion at the 56th Venice Biennale with his work “The Citizen” (2015). He had group shows for example at Bozar Center for Fine Arts, Brussels (2015) and the 2nd Montevideo Biennial (2014) and solo shows at the Philadelphia Museum of Art (2011) and Berlinische Galerie (2013). He participated in the International Studio and Curatorial Program, New York, and was awarded the Karl-Ströher-Preis in 2011. In 2017 and 2018 he showed his new work „Maskirovka“ in solo shows in Wuppertal, Berlin and Milan.\n\nAlexandra Bircken lives and works in Cologne. Her sculptural work and installations stand out with their auratic presence of materials, which often stand in stark contrasts to each other. Plaster molds, metals, waxes, textiles, and other woven materials, as well as fragments of mannequins are being connected to each other. Bircken’s work often references the human body directly by juxtaposing it with elements of its manmade environment, such as machines and devices. As such machines act as a protective cover over human characteristics, they become powerful tools while also creating an effect of alienation. Bircken’s interpretation of the body is one of variable characteristics. It can be male or female, sound or wounded, tender or aggressive – all at the same time and as a metamorphosis of its strengths and fragilities.\n\nAlexandra Birckens work has been shown in Le CEDRAC in Ivry/Paris and Museum Abteiberg (2017), in Kunstverein Hannover (2016). Before there were shows in Museum Boijmans van Beuningen, Rotterdam (2014), in The Hepworth Wakefield (2014), Kunstverein Hamburg (2012), Studio Voltaire in London (2011) and in the Kölnischer Kunstverein (2010).\n\nAlexander Gorlizki was born in 1967 in London and now lives and works in Brooklyn, NY. In 1996 he established a studio in Jaipur, India where he continues to collaborate with master miniature painter Riyaz Uddin and a group of artisans and craftspeople. Working across a wide range of traditional techniques that are adapted and occasionally subverted, he creates elaborate collections, installations and video works that create mysterious and often whimsical environments that invite the viewer to construct his or her own narratives.\n\nHis work has been extensively exhibited in Europe and the United States. His work is included in several museum collections including the Aspen Art Museum, Aspen, CO, the Museum Kunst Palast Düsseldorf, Germany, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, UK.\n\nChristian Andersson was born 1973 in Stockholm and he currently lives and works in Malmö, Sweden. He was educated at the Malmö Art Academy. In his sculptures, images and installations he makes use of a wide range of different references, materials and techniques.\n\nAndersson recently did a solo exhibition at the Kunstmuseum Thun (2015), as well as the Palais de Tokyo, Paris, and Moderna Museet, Malmö (both 2011). Recently his work has been on view in group exhibitions at Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg, the Boijmans van Beuningen Museum in Rotterdam, the Living Art Museum in Reykjavik and FRAC Champagne Ardenne (2016). He is currently preparing a solo exhibition at Museum CIAJG, Guimaraes, Portugal (2018).\n\nPeter Zimmermann, born 1956 in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany, is a painter, sculptor and conceptual artist. He studied at the art academy in Stuttgart from 1978 to 1983. Zimmermann has had numerous single or group shows in various galleries and museums all over the world. From 2002 to 2007 he was a professor at the KHM (Kunsthochschule für Medien) in Cologne.\n\nSince the 1980s he has been exploring the possibilities of painting. He is alienating photographies, film stills and diagrams with digital filters and computer programs. These alienations are transferred on a canvas in several layers of transparent epoxy resin. Since 2014 Zimmermann has also been realizing this conceptual approach by using oil colours.\n\nJulia Pfeiffer, born 1975, in Bonn. Studies of Media Art in Karlsruhe. The leitmotiv of her work are jars and containers. She molds them, takes pictures of them and put them in a space to show a relationship between those objects. The working process of building the objects is a substantial part of the oeuvre. Single shows at Maria Stenfors, London and Desaga, Cologne. She is founding member and director together with Roseline Rannoch of the exhibition space Montgomery in Berlin. She lives and works in Berlin.\n\nCraig Semetko, born 1961 in Detroit, works and lives in Los Angeles. Semetko became a comedy writer and performer after graduating from Northwestern University and discovered photography as another means of storytelling while performing in a show that took him around the world. His comedic background has given him a highly developed sense of the absurd and ironic, resulting in a strong theme of humor throughout his work. In 2014 Semetko was chosen by Leica Camera as one of 10 photographers worldwide to be part of its “10×10” exhibition celebrating 100 years of Leica photography. He has taught Leica Master Class workshops in NYC, Los Angeles, London, Milan, Miami, Frankfurt, Singapore and St. Moritz, and has taught other workshops in Canada, the United States, and India. His second book, “INDIA UNPOSED,” was published by StreetView Press and released in the spring of 20014. Exhibitions: Open Shutter Gallery in Durango, CO., in an exhibition entitled, “Street Photography: From Classic to Contemporary—Henri Cartier-Bresson and Craig Semetko,” and he’s had solo exhibitions at the Leica Galleries in Los Angeles, NYC, Salzburg, Frankfurt, Washington, D.C., Singapore, Miami, the Vadehra Art Gallery in Delhi, and the Robert Anderson Gallery in NYC. His photographs have been published worldwide and his work can be found in private collections in Asia, Europe, and the United States.\n\nMischa Kuball, born 1959 lives and works in Duesseldorf, Germany. Mischa Kuball has been working in the public sphere since 1987. He uses light as a medium to explore architectual space as well as social and political discourse in his installations and photographs, reflecting on a whole variety of aspects from sociocultual structures to architectural interventions, emphasising or reinterpreting theri monumental nature and context in architectual history. Public and private space merge into an indistinguishable whole in politically motivated participation projects, providing a platform for communikation between the audience, the artist, the work itself and public space. Since 2007 Mischa Kuball is a Professor at the Academy of Media Arts, Cologne where he founded with students the -1/MinusEins Experimental Lab.\n\nMarcel van Eeden was born in 1965 in The Hague / the Netherlands. He studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in The Hague. Van Eeden´s work resembles impressions from the film noire, based on an almost phototorealistic depiction and the use of black and white contrasts. Almost per day a new drawing emerges, lining up into sequences and series. 2014 he has been appointed professor for painting at Karlsruhe Academy of Fine Arts. Marcel lives and works in Zürich, Den Haag and Karlsruhe.\n\nThom Puckey was born in 1948 in the Kent, United Kingdom. Puckey studied in Croydon College of Art, Slade School of Art, and ultimately gained his Masters of Fine Art at the Royal College of Art in London, 1975. His career has embraced painting, installation, music-theatre, performance art, and sculpture. Awarded the Sandberg Art Prize in 1986, he has lectured at Rijksacademie Amsterdam, and currently holds the position of Lecturer in Fine Art at the Academy for Art and Design, Den Bosch. Puckey’s sculptures feature regularly in public spaces throughout Holland. Puckey moved to Holland in the 1970s, and he now lives between Amsterdam and Tuscany."
