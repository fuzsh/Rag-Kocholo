        "text": "Marcel van Eeden\n\nat Clint Roenisch Gallery\n\n€2,000 (about $2,800) each. Until Oct. 31, 944 Queen St. W., Toronto; 416-516-8593\n\nWhile the order that lies at the heart of all routine can act as a satisfying corrective to the shapeless chaos that threatens to overwhelm most of us, there is also the sort of routine that borders on the obsessive. I don't know whether Dutch artist Marcel van Eeden feels obsessive about what he does - one hopes not.\n\nWhat he does do is make one drawing a day. But not just any drawing (that would constitute too much freedom, the kind of freedom that could merely condemn an artist to endless possibility). No, van Eeden sets up some rules for himself.\n\nThe daily drawing, which is usually in charcoal -though occasionally he breaks out the pencil crayons, for a sudden lunge into colour - must be of a subject harvested from a world van Eeden never knew: from the world, that is to say, that existed before his birth, in 1965. And it must be undertaken in a highly proscribed way: He must begin the drawing at the top left corner of his paper - which is always the same size, 19 by 28 centimetres - and end it at the lower right. This means, of course, that he cannot permit mere artistic or anecdotal interest to waylay him in his relentless march across the paper from corner to corner. What he has decided to draw that day gets drawn - as if the drawing were simply a task that needed doing.\n\nWhich is the case. These restrictions in no way prepare the viewer for the almost absurdly rich array of images that constitutes this exhibition - at Toronto's Clint Roenisch Gallery - of van Eeden's latest outcropping of specimens from his vast, accumulating encyclopedia of things that existed before he did.\n\nWithin the current collection of works (which are installed in groups and in diagonal lines, with one image actually embedded in the gallery wall so you see only half of it) are drawings so soft, so shadowy, so atmospheric, you begin to imagine you're in the presence of another Seurat. But then you see that many of the shadows are film-noir shadows, drawn not from art history but from photo archives, films, magazines, newspapers and other easily inspected freeze-frames of time past.\n\nThe images are dizzyingly various and adhere to no predominant style - except that constituted by van Eeden's tenacious stylelessness. One drawing, for example, is of two cranes flying, with the single word \"spaciously\" printed beneath them. Not far away is a perfectly rendered drawing of a revolver, with the owner's permit beside it. Then there are somebody's breasts. And a thick red steak. And two dark figures watching a glider ply the bright sky overhead. And two drawings lifted from an optical work by Marcel Duchamp, under which there is text that reads: \"Herbert pulled open a drawer and withdrew a large butcher knife, spotted with cake frosting. Ronald shuddered slightly.\"\n\nAs well Ronald should. For van Eeden is no innocent supplier of specimen pictures. What van Eeden has drawn - and continues to draw - is the complete cacophony of the past, a huge, echoing cave of what culture was and will never be again. His drawing is like dreaming - except that he is dreaming into being (like James Joyce's Finnegans Wake) a complete world that he cannot possibly have experienced. Thus the images' unforgettable strangeness.\n\nTruman Couture\n\n(a.k.a. Thrush Holmes)\n\nat the Thrush Holmes Empire\n\n$2,200-$20,000. Until Oct. 28, 1093 Queen St. W., Toronto; 416-530-4747\n\nHere's the deal about this artist named Truman Couture, maker of the attractive, puzzlingly sweet and sometimes almost vapid abstract paintings now blooming like big flowers on the walls of the Thrush Holmes Empire: Thrush is himself (big surprise!) Truman Couture - or was.\n\nI guess there is nobody in Canadian art as open and as guileless as Thrush Holmes is. He's perfectly willing to tell me Truman's story - and here it is: \"Truman was my apprentice,\" Holmes says, smiling that shy, kid-next-door smile he's so good at. \"Truman is where I got my capital\" - by which he means the money required to set up his spacious gallery/workshop complex in Toronto, the aforementioned Empire. Holmes says that, as Truman, starting about five years ago, he produced 10 or 12 abstract paintings a day - living-room-sized paintings, it turns out - and sold them for between $300 and $500 on the Internet and eBay. He sold them like mad. People liked Truman's work, and they bought it by the carload. Who could have imagined that six years later, Truman - now fully modulated into Thrush Holmes - would be selling paintings briskly (mostly in Los Angeles and Atlanta) for over one-hundred grand a pop?\n\nWas Truman any good? Well, it is nice of Holmes to give him an exhibition - in this case, a sort of fictitious retrospective. Sure, he's all right. \"Basically\", Holmes tells me, \"Truman paints backgrounds.\" And he paints them well enough - most of his paintings are richly brushed abstract-expressionist works, often with text scribbled into the still-wet paint. They tend to reference other artists - Cy Twombly, for example.\n\nHolmes cautions me that this crop of Truman's paintings is likely to change in the course of its run at the Empire. How so? \"Well,\" says Holmes, \"I'm probably going to be painting on them.\" Truman paints backgrounds, after all.\n\nJay Isaac at Paul Petro Contemporary Art\n\n$400-$1,800. Until Oct. 6.\n\n980 Queen St. W., Toronto; 416-979-7874\n\nAccording to his dealer, Paul Petro, painter Jay Isaac is living the life of his dreams - in Saint John.\n\nIsaac isn't very old yet - and certainly not of the age when most people tend to decide to trade the stress of life in the city for the pastoral calm of a chicken farm or a place in the middle of Algonquin Park. But Isaac apparently loves it in Saint John, which he describes as \"a strange and wonderful place\" in his artist's statement.\n\nAnd the work shows it. The paintings, which are very small (16 by 20 inches is about standard), are all made with oils on canvas or on board. They depict innocent things: landscapes, seascapes, trees, flowers in vases. And the thing is, they actually seem imbued with the freshness that Isaac appears to experience every day in his adopted city by the sea. Are they any good? Oh sure, they're fine - charming. As paintings, they're minor - pretty and personal and no doubt pleasurable to paint. Isaac isn't Cézanne. But he's doing what he wants to do, and who can say where that may lead?"
