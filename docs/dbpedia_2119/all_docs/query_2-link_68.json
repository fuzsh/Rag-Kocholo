        "text": "INCIDENCE\n\nIncidence is the number of new cases of a disorder in a population over a specified period of time (usually 1 year). The incidence rate of eating disorders is commonly expressed per 100 000 persons per year (100 000 person-years). The study of newly developed cases of an eating disorder provides clues to unravel its etiology [6]. It is noteworthy that healthcare register-based incidence rates represent the situation at the moment of detection, which is likely to be later than the moment of disorder onset.\n\nPrevalence\n\nPrevalence is the proportion of cases in a population present at a certain point or interval in time. The point prevalence is the prevalence at a specific date (point) in time. The 12-month prevalence is the prevalence over an interval of a year. The lifetime prevalence is the proportion of the population that has had the disorder at any moment in life up to the moment of registration. In general, lifetime prevalence rates are higher than point and 12-month prevalence rates, especially when assessed in older populations. Prevalence indicates the demand for care and is therefore useful in the planning of healthcare facilities. Many studies have assessed the prevalence of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. In this review, we focus on recently published systematic reviews and meta-analyses, supplemented by recently published population-based studies that have not been included in the described reviews and meta-analyses."
