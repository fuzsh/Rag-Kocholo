        "text": "Photo sketch (1995–2003)\n\nIn 1995, Ruud van Empel is awarded a work grant by the Dutch state, via what is known at the time as the ‘Fonds voor Beeldende Kunst, Vormgeving en Bouwkunst’. He buys a computer in order to experiment with Photoshop on it. The program enables him to manipulate his analogue photos with greater accuracy than is possible in the more traditional photo collages that he is then making with the copier. He has previously been working as a graphic designer for a diverse range of clients across all sorts of media. This has given him the chance to develop his personal artistic view of printing, theatre, interiors, television and production design. During the period 1980–2000, his main activity is design work, which is his destiny after he completes his training as a graphic designer from 1976 to 1981 at the Academie Sint Joost in Breda. What distinguishes him from his peers is both his versatility and his passion for the image over typography and tangible objects.\n\nSince childhood, he has been amassing an image archive, which forms the source that he can draw from, for all of his work. It consists of images and objects, that he finds all over the place, or nowhere at all, and which strike him with their unique character. He discovers that the most extreme consequence of the everyday is that reality emerges as absurd, deranged, banal, brilliant or worthless.\n\nThe experiments with the computer in 1995 have their impact in the free work ‘The Photo sketch’, which is not shown for the first time until 2010 at Flatland Gallery (Utrecht, NL), where he shows it in combination with the series ‘The Office’, previously exhibited in 1998 at Torch Gallery (Amsterdam, NL) at the invitation of Adriaan van der Have (1958–2009). The ‘Photo sketch’ works cover the period 1995–2003, a timeframe that represents an important aspect of the way that Ruud van Empel works. His work does start somewhere, but actually it never stops. When the need arises, he can always return to a work that he has already started, pick it up and add something to it, which has never presented itself before. The necessity of such an addition determines whether or not he presses on. This means that he virtually never definitively finishes a work. The ‘Photo sketch’ works can be regarded as exercises in particularising the everyday. They are unsettlingly normal pictures, and they look both very Dutch and universal. Through them, he reaches back to his first free photographic work from the eighties, into which he can breathe new life thanks to the digital technology he now has at his disposal, and which marked the beginning of his career as an artist in the medium of photography.\n\nThe Office (1995–1998, 2001)\n\nAfter the initial experiments in the ‘Photo sketch’ works, Ruud van Empel uses digital manipulation of analogue photos and scanned-in objects such as stones to produce the associated series, in both monochrome and colour, called ‘The Office’. The main focus here is on people sitting at their desks, surrounded almost overwhelmingly by the trophies of their professional lives, in a muted atmosphere reminiscent of historical scenes with a timeless appearance. One striking example is a scene inspired by the British mathematician Andrew Wiles. After years of research, he believes he has found a conclusive proof of Fermat’s last theorem, which when it is published turns out, to his immense disappointment, to contain an error. He presses on and in 1994 he does deliver the proof. These photos still show van Empel’s background as a designer of photo collages. As a production designer, he dreams up countless sets. For example, he might scan in some pebbles which are then manipulated into huge mounds in a set. He takes unrealised set ideas for this series, making use of his picture archive and experiments with Photoshop. The experiments that he conducts with the ‘Photo sketch’ works are developed further here. His early work, such as his first ‘Photo Portraits’ and ‘Sketches’, emerges as the precursor of the method that he applies in ‘The Office’ and later in ‘Frame Story’; hand cutting and pasting is replaced by digital manipulation of existing material. In the NRC Handelsblad on 25 February 1999, writing about a presentation of this work at FotoForum in Amersfoort and the Groninger Museum, Nathalie Faber says that van Empel succeeds in depicting “the unbearable lightness and emptiness of being”. What van Empel mostly proves with this work is that the clichéd image that we have of specific situations can be deepened with a somewhat sinister feeling for irony and self- mockery and thereby elevated to a new reality. Through this work, Ruud van Empel enters the world of visual art. The work is exhibited by Torch Gallery at the Amsterdam art fair Kunstrai in 1998. This is followed by the first presentation abroad, in June-July 1999 at Carmen Obest Kunstraum in Hamburg and a solo exhibition at the Groninger Museum by Han Steenbruggen (NL 1960), who at that time was the curator for contemporary art.\n\nStudy for Women, The Naarden Studies (1999–2000)\n\nIn the ‘Photo sketch’ and ‘The Office’ works, Ruud van Empel succeeds in depicting an artificial, imagined world. In ‘Study for Women’, he takes up the challenge of composing a true-to-life figure composed of previously photographed elements. To do this, he scans photographs of supermodels into the computer, which he painstakingly blends together with window dummies as the template for the ultimate woman. He makes the series during the period 1999–2000, an era when digital technology is developing rapidly and offering ever wider possibilities The totally artificial women he composes are perfect down to the tiniest detail, with the representation just of a single arm potentially being made up of four photos. He uses up to 250 photos for each separate image. The typical feature of this work is that the women have vulnerable eyes, yet at the same time they have an untouchable look about them. Art lovers find that this work recalls associations with magic realism and the work of Pyke Koch (NL 1901–1991), but ‘The Naarden Studies’ are certainly not literal interpretations of that school of art. Magic realism shows a reality that is connected to an undefined atmosphere, which makes the work hard to pin down and gives it a secret and sometimes menacing character. Instead, van Empel’s work has more to do with unreal women who are thrown back on themselves in an unambiguous environment. You also see reflections of more contemporary forms of female portraiture, specifically those made by women of themselves, such as Cindy Sherman. Through this work he also addresses the subject of innocence and its contradictory nature, an aspect in his work that has already been identified by curator Moniek IJzermans (NL 1967), who includes him in the exhibition ‘Het verlies van onschuld’ (The loss of innocence) at FAXX by the University of Tilburg (NL). Through this series, he develops from a graphic designer definitively into a visual artist. This work earns him a solo exhibition at Galerie Bernini in Barcelona, after he has taken part in 2000 in the Primavera Fotografica in that city. The female studies result in a complementary series from 2003, which he makes for Fotofestival Naarden, one of the major annual photographic events in the Netherlands. For the main presentation in the Grote Kerk in Naarden, he makes fourteen works in which he places photographs of women against background settings which have been composed in intricate detail, including a woodland landscape and a seascape. Although it is now the background that is mostly made up of countless collected images, the women actually look more artificial than these landscapes, as if they have been smoothed out, and in their mostly androgynous appearance they project an image of womanhood that can be construed as a statement about how women are commonly depicted. Van Empel’s women are strong, self-possessed and elusive. In that sense, this work chimes well with the theme of Fotofestival Naarden 2003: ‘Grenzeloos (boundless)’. For this series, he makes use for the first time of models, still captured via analogue photography.\n\nUntitled, Study in Green (2003–2004)\n\n‘The backgrounds in ‘The Naarden Series’ take autonomous form in ‘Study in Green’, which dates from 2003–2004. These works combine earlier analogue photos with digital photos that he takes at various locations in the natural environment in order to combine them into autonomous landscapes. The pictures are rich in all manner of details which demonstrate a credible harmony, but which in reality cannot be encountered as such. In the deep green wooded areas with sinuous root structures, and a sense of depth that is unusual in landscape art, you see flowers, insects and animals that come from diverse sources. Van Empel shows clearly that he borrows specific pictorial elements from art history. In general, what fascinates him is not the work of the most well- known artists, a fact which gives an insight into the importance he attaches to what is going on outside of the mainstream. Viewing these photos is a determining voyage of discovery, in which an owl, a deer, a butterfly, a grasshopper, a snail or a wolf in the entourage of an almost menacing natural environment of dark green trees and plants and colourful flowers produce an illusion of pristine nature. The idyll being imagined here takes on an interpretation that has an unsettling effect, just as with many imaginings of the Garden of Eden before the Fall. This illusion creates mistrust and internal resistance against the overwhelmingly pure beauty of nature, which stands on the point of being corrupted by the looming hulk of original sin, the eating of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. What is paradoxical in the work is the effect of depth and the way that every element functions with the same intensity both in the foreground and in the background of the composition. Because the digitally photographed elements from which the overall work is made up are all correspondingly precise, the whole image is actually flat. Despite this, the illusion of depth he manages to create is overwhelming. He cancels out short-sightedness and long-sightedness. In this way, in a photographic sense, Ruud van Empel adds something to the conventional pictorial subject of the perspective effect. The title ‘Study in Green’ is chosen because at that particular time, van Empel feels that he is still studying the possibilities that the new technologies have to offer. In the same way that for the viewer, it is a voyage of discovery to linger visually in these works, for van Empel it is a precise and analytical study into his art historical relationship with the landscape. Simultaneously, it is a study of form and style that, as an artist, he has designed to refine his personal signature and make it more emphatic. Ruud van Empel also refines views about the depiction of innocence and beauty in the work ‘Untitled’ from 2004. He places young girls – blondes, redheads and brunettes alike – in wooded landscapes, their gaze fixed shamelessly on the viewer. He presents innocence here as a specific characteristic, aiming to suggest beauty not sentimentally or fraudulently, but in a pure and unequivocal way. He photographs children whose images he manipulates to make them look more doll-like in order to reinforce the illusion of innocence. ‘Untitled’ is interpreted by the media in all sorts of different ways, some of them very dubious. He is producing this work at a time when there are massive concerns in the Netherlands about Marc Dutroux (a Belgian man convicted of paedophilia and murder). The combination of a ‘spooky wood’ and ‘a little girl all alone’ conjures up associations for some people which make the work suspicious on the grounds of an unwholesome sexualised view of young children.\n\nWorld (2005–2008, 2010, 2017)\n\nRuud van Empel has drilled down into the phenomenon of xenophobia – the fear of foreigners. This investigation results in a series of works that you can see as reactions to racism, homophobia, gender issues and so on. He does not adopt the position of an activist, but through his series of photographs he shows an integral world picture in which everyone is equal, however much people may differ from one another. Ruud van Empel’s series ‘World’ proposes a seemingly unequivocal answer to the false assumptions, particularly with regard to xenophobia, which to some extent happened with ‘Study in Green’ and ‘Untitled’, although they did also earn a lot of positive attention and appreciation. ‘World’ also takes innocence as its theme, showing children in their best clothes in a bewitching natural environment. Girls of colour in white dresses with branches of flowers in their hands against the background of plants with huge leaves and bathed in sunshine, a little boy of colour looking at his reflection in a pond, a lad in shorts who looks as though he is talking to a little bird on his hand, a little girl in a blue dress with a cuddly toy on her arm who is alive to her, a young boy surfacing from a pond surrounded by lily leaves, etc. The striking thing is that van Empel has taken traditional tropes such as the myth of Narcissus and looked at them from a quite different point of view by now placing a young boy of colour in that role. This is a sizeable series of works which in terms of both content and technique is inescapable in the pronounced quality and choice of subject matter. He uses these works to show that racial difference is artificial and that everyone is equal. He uses everything at his disposal as an artist to challenge ideas we may have about people who look different. Recognition comes when the series goes on show in the United States. Van Empel is asked by Deborah Klochko in 2006 to participate in the exhibition ‘Picturing Eden’ in the George Eastman House, which is also displayed the following year at the Museum of Photographic Art (MoPA), of which Klochko is the director. A work from ‘World’ makes the cover of the accompanying catalogue. This exhibition and its catalogue spearhead the international breakthrough of the work. The African- American community in the United States of America reacts enthusiastically: they feel as if they are becoming visible. They see someone showing that the innocence and beauty of children of colour can be celebrated and admired. The images of children in this series trace their roots back to childhood photos that his father took of him. The innocence of these photos is partly the result of the unaffected poses and the dated children’s clothing. At the same time, Ruud van Empel’s participation in the solo show ‘Perfection/ Imperfection’ at the Stefan Stux Gallery in New York launches his photographic work on the international stage, and from that moment on, his reputation is ensured. After this series, Ruud van Empel’s work becomes known all over the world. ‘World’ is talked about extensively in countless publications and features on the covers of many magazines and photography books. Four of these works are added to the collection of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.\n\nMoon, Venus (2005–2008)\n\nThanks to the impression made by the ‘World’ series, Ruud van Empel realises that he is not finished yet with this subject matter. This leads to the series ‘Moon’ and ‘Venus’.\n\n‘Moon’ is the nocturnal counterpart of ‘World’, in which he places moonlit children in the natural world. The ‘Venus’ series includes young girls whose behaviour and gestures are strongly reminiscent of Lucas Granach the Elder. By presenting girls of colour in this art history context as a contemporary Venus, van Empel is correcting the perspective. In the history of western art, it is extremely unusual for women of colour to be seen as an ideal of beauty of dazzling innocence. Elves and nymphs, princesses and fairies: they are all Caucasian. Van Empel shows that they are also of colour. And precisely by also giving Caucasian girls the same role in the series, he reinforces the idea of equality. Whatever the colour of the children’s skin, they are all the same. Van Empel also explores the ideas of ‘day’ and ‘night’. He finds the dark so much more mysterious, atmospheric and quiet than the daylight. In several series, he creates both daytime and night scenes in order to make the meaning of the work more layered. When it comes to depicting Venus, he runs up against another problem. Differing sensitivities in various countries mean that he feels obliged to depict her ‘nudity’ with the necessary circumspection in a puritanical country such as America, while in the liberal Netherlands and other Western European countries, he can go a step further on that score, something that also has to do with that direct reference to Granach, whose naked young women have never been suspected of being the perversions of a sexually obsessed man. This experience bolsters Ruud van Empel in the conviction that no historical style, movement or school can remain immune in playing a role in this work. He also hides nothing in that regard. As an artist, he is obliged to engage with the global ramifications of art history in order to be able to determine what position he can occupy for himself within it. The same applies to the cultural traditions in all parts of the world. It is his pure intention to liberate these from a one-sided ‘folkloric’ approach by making them into a universal language and giving them meaning within the context of his work. In an observation on 7 October 2012 in U-T San Diego, Pat Sherman writes about an associated presentation at the MoPA of van Empel’s work: “One of the most striking initial reactions to the series ‘World’, ‘Moon’, ‘Venus’ by the Dutch photographer Ruud van Empel, is how much the works resemble Renaissance paintings. Yet there is something subtly creepy about them, and there are questions about the heavenly landscapes and subjects that draw the eye and make it linger, looking for the finer details.”\n\nSouvenir, Souvenir d’Intime (2008, 2015)\n\nIn 2007, Ruud van Empel’s atelier practice is at a virtual standstill, because he has taken it upon himself to care for his terminally ill mother, Corrie Couweleers. The realisation that everything that your mother knows about you is lost when she dies, hits him hard. Van Empel is 48 at the time and decides to reconstruct everything that his mother knows about him, however inadequate. He goes through the same procedure when his father dies in 2011. When it comes to the objects saved, the legacy of both his parents borders on the obsessive, comparable to the way in which he himself builds his photo archive and collects, takes and stores tens of thousands of images in order to be able to convert them, through his photographic work, into an autonomous world. His parents’ marriage, which produced three children, ends in divorce. Both his mother and his father hold on to relics from the past with the greatest care. His father, in particular, hoards everything, and these shadows from the past see the light of day again when his ex-wife passes away. His father’s stuff is mostly personal artefacts from himself and his children, while his mother’s is those utilitarian objects essential in daily life but which, once they are deprived of their purpose, take on a symbolic meaning in terms of how life is and has been lived. In what his parents leave behind, he also comes across plenty about himself, which he makes sensually accessible in the honourable tradition of Marcel Proust’s Madeleine effect in the series ‘Souvenir d’Intime‘: childhood drawings, toys, self-portraits, passport photos, drawings of battle scenes, academic studies, but also his love letters and those of girls from his primary school class, and all his father’s bits and bobs, right down to his PTT (the Dutch Postal Service) cap and false teeth; memorabilia relating to his father’s time in Indonesia during the war of independence there, his mother’s embroidery things and touching, tangible mementoes of his late sister. If this work is hard-hitting, then the series ‘Souvenir’ is, if anything, even more harrowing. He endeavours to make the almost unbearable, personal character of this work more acceptable by having his photo compositions accompanied by short poetic texts. You would be able to call them ‘poems’, but in reality they stem more from the tradition of the literary movement of the Informals of the early sixties in the Netherlands, with neutral observations around everyday situations: found footage and then its documentary description where personal experiences trickle down. Nothing about this work has been specifically intended for the occasion. The combination of the objects produces an inescapable image. The full ‘Souvenir’ series (2008) is acquired for the collection of the Noordbrabants Museum in ‘s-Hertogenbosch.\n\nGeneration, Wonder, Club (2010–2011)\n\nUntil 2009, the people, especially the young children, in Ruud van Empel’s work are placed singly or in pairs against a scenic background. Their presence is emphatic in the picture, and represents a world view with regard to skin colour and cultural differences which may be experienced as controversial from the social point of view. The ‘Generation’ series from 2010 derives from his curiosity at placing multiple figures together, but also from the mission of revisiting the subject of xenophobia. Prior to the tripartite ‘Generation’, he begins working carefully with small groups of four, and later eight, children. His own school photos from the early sixties form the inspiration for the three works in ‘Generation’ in the 124 x 330 cm format. These school photos are traditionally composed of three rows of children posed formally against a neutral background. The reminiscences of the nineteen sixties are very potent, with the spectacle frames, clothing and hairstyles, but taken all together, these groups form a timeless image of the future prospects that these young people betray through their external appearances. ‘Generation #1’ shows a school class in which only a single child of colour is visible, a circumstance which was typical of school classes when van Empel was a child, and one which is also recognised as a given by his Caucasian peers. The picture did not emerge in the shape of a class photo by photographing all the children together as a group. For each individual child, he uses four separately photographed models, and the details in appearance and dress are composed digitally, altered and/or added in order to achieve the penetrating individuation of each one that go together to make up this group. ‘Generation #2’ is a similar class photo, but this time it exclusively shows children of colour. Van Empel is showing how widely the skin tones of the children vary. They are all different, and yet they are all equal in the class. The shades of skin colour are identical to the variations in skin colour of the Caucasian children. Van Empel is speaking up against the generalisation that dark people form one single ‘type’, they too experience very many shades in appearance and skin colour. By showing people of colour in all their vulnerability and beauty, Ruud van Empel is contributing to a subtle conversation about this sensitive issue. In ‘Generation #3’, he goes a step further in looking at prejudices around appearances and skin colour by presenting a class of Jewish children. Over the course of history, Jewish people have been defined in a negative way by external features, which culminated in the Nazi caricature of the Jew with a big nose, pouting lips, a squinting expression and a pale skin. This stereotype can be traced back to the Middle Ages. Van Empel shows that being Jewish is not tied to external features, and certainly not to the features of a ‘race’. Van Empel’s Jewish school class is multicultural, with European, Asian and African children, making the point that Jewish people are united by their religion and that there is ultimately only one race: the human race. Both the Groninger Museum and the Jewish Historical Museum in Amsterdam have acquired the works for their collections. This multicultural nature of the human race is something that he focuses on more intensely in ‘Wonder’. In the largest work, which measures 124 x 393.5 cm, there are more than a hundred children. The way in which all the children look penetratingly at you is almost frightening, as is their sheer number. Every figure is built up from photos of several models, and the composition is extremely complicated. He is fascinated by how masses of people have been captured in photographs, like in the image by Weegee of a mass of bathers on Coney Island. By making this horde of people so colourful, he also references an inspiration from the history of art: ‘Christ’s Entry into Brussels’ by James Ensor. The smaller work ‘Club’, which measures just 60 x 156 cm, is a strikingly different type of group portrait. It is a group of boys who are taking their first swimming lesson and are standing shivering on the tiled floor at the side of the pool. The boys’ swimming trunks make an endearing, helpless impression, shot through with their fearless eagerness to be getting on with life. The variety in attitudes, from cool to bashful, and the differences in build, from slim to chunky, make it clear that van Empel is not generalising about this generation of kids. He lets every child be seen precisely in his own individual vulnerability. This speaks to the potential of youth. These are the heroes and macho men of tomorrow, soldiers driven by blood lust as they launch an attack. The contrast between the awkwardness of the lads at the swimming pool and the expectations for the future which are thus expressed makes this work into a disarming demonstration of the fate that man calls down upon himself.\n\nTheatre (2010–2013)\n\nIn English, ‘‘theatre’’ is the military term for an area in which war is waged. This expresses the frightening beauty which is associated with a life-and-death battle. The wondrous aesthetic of death, ruin and destruction forms the starting point for the panoramic image (100 x 300 cm) of a blonde girl in a blue dress in a dark wood where the sunlight is catching the precise spot in the distance where she is standing. It is clear that Ruud van Empel uses his work to question ideas about good taste and aesthetics. He shows that, what from a one- sided view of contemporary image culture is perceived as sentimental or uncomfortable, is an assumption which in art history terms, can be overturned by earlier and perhaps future visions. He sees everything that is regarded as (too) lovely or as excessive and exaggeratedly aesthetic as a reason to take a different look at it, in order to discover precisely what its qualities are. Another panoramic work shows a young deer in a dark wood. The sentiment that Bambi arouses is shamelessly exploited. According to Ruud van Empel, you can indeed reject such an image because of the unambiguous emotion it is trying to create, but that still does not mean that if you are walking in the wood yourself and you meet a fawn, you are not going to stand and gaze at it open-mouthed. The essential elements of this experience are given form by him in this work. The smaller 120 x 120 cm works from ‘Theatre’ show a defenceless scenic beauty which as yet has no inkling of what fate has in store for it. After a battle which may be about to be waged there, it will be declared a ‘guilty landscape’. In that way, this work references the work of the artist Armando (NL 1929–2018), who, in his reflections on the aftermath of the Second World War, portrayed woodland edges as indifferent witnesses to war crimes in his paintings. ‘Theatre’, which began in 2010, is a series that is expanded every couple of years with new work. An example of such a later work is the composition with blooming cactuses that appears on the cover of this publication. Their brutal beauty has been encapsulated by van Empel in an almost architectural representation of unapproachable nature.\n\nStill Life (2014–2015, 2017)\n\nThe ‘Still Life’ series shows classical symbolism of the past with putrid fish, rotting fruit, mouldy bread, stuffed animals, foetuses in formaldehyde, a display of butcher’s goods, offal and fossilised stones and shells. These are confrontational images that are a reflection on how, over the course of history, man has thought about his own mortality in relation to flora and fauna. His pictorial language is very obviously borrowed from the Dutch painters of the 17th century. The critic Ronald Ockhuysen writes in ‘Het Parool’ on September 15, 2009: “Still Life-mushrooms, a lusty still life that references the vanity paintings of the seventeenth century, in which mould plays a key part, hosts a whole arsenal of stories and insights. This work sees van Empel on top form, as an artist who is reinventing photography and striking a massive blow at reality with his reconstructions.” Before his mother passes away in 2007, Ruud van Empel has already lost his disabled sister in 1992 at the age of 21. From that point onwards, thoughts of mortality and the past take on an increasingly important role in his work. He goes about it in a ruthless way, taking on the eye of an outsider. For himself, it is an obvious necessity to depict the personal intimacy of recollections represented by tangible objects in a dependent relationship with one another. What is striking is that this work is less recognised outside the Netherlands. But it is a classic Dutch topic, one that has always played a prominent role, including in Dutch literature, the high point being the legendary novel ‘De avonden’ (The Evenings) by one of the 20th century’s greatest Dutch writers, Gerard Reve (1923–2006). The starting point here is that reality is more unbelievable than fiction, a notion, which in the case of Ruud van Empel, makes it hard for non- Dutch people to identify with. The reception that greets his new work in the United States is typical. This is how Jeff Stafford reacts on 7 October 2014 to a presentation at Jackson Fine Art in Atlanta: “The more unsettling tone of the new work may possibly be attributable to the artist’s reaction to modern media, in particular the way that they dehumanize us instead of improving communication. Whether you reject or embrace this new direction in van Empel’s career, the recent work delivers persuasive new evidence that he is blurring the line between photography and painting more and more, by means of his digital manipulations and photo-real collages.”\n\nMondo del Silenzio (2015)\n\n‘Mondo del Silenzio’ consists of natural watery landscapes. He uses a layering technique to depict both the surface of the water and the depths, with the reflection of the sunlight upon them and their almost tangible transparency. This layered look lends itself very well to the use of Photoshop to work out these ideas, which van Empel is anxious to fine tune for a long time before adding the children. This series marks the start of a series of five in which nature plays the main role and there are no people or animals in them. Nature itself has become the subject. The properties of water are something that Ruud van Empel has included earlier in his work as a sub-topic, for instance in the ‘Venus’ works where young girls appear out of the water. In ‘Mondo del Silenzio’ he descends into the water. By including the insects on the water’s surface and the fishes that swim in it, he combines both the underwater view and from above. The still, alien, watery world is expressed in this series of photographs in all its majesty of unfamiliar sea creatures and plants. The colour effect varies from photo to photo, from pale and a little bit blurry to being reminiscent of a fairy-tale and brightly coloured. The way that he treats the water as a fluid material is very striking. All the elements that go to make up the separate works have been photographed over the years by van Empel himself in aquaria and natural history museums. This collection of material is a sea of images to which things can be added anywhere and at any time. From that point of view, Ruud van Empel is never off duty. Wherever he is, he collects images for his archive. Life itself constantly feeds his art. In that respect, he is a true heir to Joseph Beuys, and his belief that an artist does not have weekends. He is subject to the time-honoured ‘hunger for images’, constantly adding new creatures to the water that so bewitch him. The series has two extremes: on the one hand is the captivating, colourful underwater world with ornate shells and creatures, on the other is the murky, impenetrable water where plants shimmer and fade. What links them is, as the title suggests, is the fact that this world is silent. It is a silence instantly recognisable to anyone who swims underwater: everything sounds muffled and far away. The pressure on your ears increases the deeper you dive, so that your senses force you more and more inwards on yourself. As you become short of air, the urge to return to the surface and the world of sound and light slowly makes itself felt. To experience another world, we don’t necessarily need to head off into space: the underwater world can offer us sensations that touch us at least as profoundly.\n\nMood (2015–2016)\n\nThe ‘Mood’ series consists of nine works in which Ruud van Empel generates a mood between light and dark as soberly as possible using lots of dark tones. He makes portraits of children in atmospheric nocturnal settings. One can question whether these are truly ‘portraits’. Because the image is made up of hundreds of elements from separately photographed details, the intensified verisimilitude of the technique is also immediately an ideal artificial construct. When printing them, he uses Archival Pigment Print, making it possible to use an intense deep black in visible nuances. ‘Mood’ can be construed as a revisiting of the ‘Moon’ series of photographs from 2005–2006, in which he places children in landscapes illuminated by the blue light of the moon.\n\nFor the figures in the photos, he makes use of models who come to his studio with their mothers. He works with the modelling agency ‘Kids’, and the care that working with children requires involves the processing of every photo taking easily a week or even two. As with all his portrait works, he composes a new face from earlier shots of different children. For Ruud van Empel, ‘Mood’ is also first and foremost an exercise in simplicity. This may seem to be inconsistent with the extremely laborious and subtle compilation of his pictures, but the very saying that ‘the master shows himself through simplicity’ applies perfectly to this work. The result looks effortless and obvious. The photos show children who immediately evoke a feeling of emotion. At the same time, the work is a commentary on how art uses such feelings. Art appreciation by and large is suspicious of it and ‘the weeping gypsy boy’ is often wheeled out as the definitive disqualification. This is to forget that in the 19th century, as Mariette Haveman (1957) shows in her book ‘Het feest achter de gordijnen’ (The party behind the curtains), the young gypsy boy was originally an image cultivated by the intelligentsia to endorse their rejection of child abuse and child labour. As the gypsy boy has been embraced by large layers of society in the 20th century, the higher cultural echelons have withdrawn from him to the same extent. Mass reproduction of him also has the effect that the image is barely taken seriously in art now. It has tipped over into the realm of kitsch and is a trope that attracts ridicule and scorn. Ruud van Empel is interested in the demise of a representation and his work delivers a commentary on it by making these preconceptions into a problem and updating them. ‘Mood’ ties in with the necessity that he feels to provide some light and shade here. However innocently presented, a child of colour is still a target for discrimination. He made the series for an exhibition at Huxley Parlour Gallery in London. The images invite us to approach them with a human eye, rather than label them ‘cute’ or ‘endearing’. But that there is also a history mingled in, where that gaze is returned with shame and an awareness of guilt. These photographs therefore provide a dimension of profundity to the sentimentality, which they equally evoke.\n\nVoyage Pittoresque (2016–2019)\n\nIn ‘Voyage Pittoresque’, Ruud van Empel shows no people. This series of photographs could be construed as the democratisation of diverse iterations of the landscape, just as his group portraits are an example of the humanisation of prejudices regarding race, colour, appearance and origins. In ‘Voyage Pittoresque’, he shows us ideal landscapes which from the aesthetic point of view are stunning in their refinement of the use of colour and the creation of visual order out of a totally natural chaos. What he does in his portraits – everyone, whether in the foreground or in the background, is rendered with equal intensity – he repeats here in these landscapes. Van Empel guides the eye through the blooming profusion of overgrown landscapes, making the viewer experience their confusion as insightful. The title of the work is borrowed from an expression coined by Henk van Os, the former director of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, who used it to describe the ‘Grand Tour’ ventures of artists from earlier centuries. Diverse travel experiences were allowed to feed into compositions planned in the atelier. Everything in these paintings is ‘true to life’ and ‘painted from reality’, but they are in no sense realistic. You will never encounter any of these romanticised landscapes in the same quality in the outside world, but this fact does not take away from their credibility as works of art. They are completely artificial representations of what the artist observed at various points on his journey. While such ‘Grand Tour landscapes’ are often distant panoramic views with a ‘repoussoir’ placed in the foreground to give the illusion of depth, van Empel’s work is all about the frog perspective. From ground level, you are looking up at the vegetation that seems impenetrable, but those who make it their home are still able to find a way through. You are right in the middle of it. As in many of his photographic series, this work also features daytime and nocturnal variations. The differences in atmosphere ensure an overarching context that is in contrast. Day and night now come together and share responsibility for an accurate experience of the passage of time.Van Empel has composed his idealised landscapes from photos that he has taken in places including Sri Lanka, Naples, Morocco, Atlanta, Scotland, Cuba and Surinam. It is ‘manufactured nature’, for which he interweaves both house- plants and wild flowers and plants into a credible landscape that is in fact is artificial. Although the beauty of many of these landscapes portraits is untouchable, he still lets us see that he also has an eye for touching them. In 2019, ‘Voyage Pittoresque’ forms part of the solo exhibition ‘Making Nature’ at the Museum Belvédère in Oranjewoud, Heerenveen (NL). In the publication of the same name produced for the occasion, the essay by Ruud Schenk places van Empel’s fascination with nature within the tradition of authors such as John Keats (1795–1821), Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862) and the Dutchman Frederik van Eeden (1860–1932). They attribute qualities to untamed nature which are being more and more disregarded in the rapidly industrialising world. As Schenk puts it: “I had to think about it when I saw [the] recent series ‘Floresta’ and ‘Voyage Pittoresque’, which seem almost literally to have been created from the point of view of a low-flying dragonfly. The fairy-tale beauty of these worlds of flowers and plants actually occurs only in folk tales – or maybe in a child’s imagination? In that sense they are of a piece with the fictional children’s portraits for which van Empel has become famous. These children were also standing in surroundings reminiscent of paradise, which have been further refined in the recent nature works in more detail and more lavishly.”\n\nCollage (2017)\n\nIn ‘Collage’, Ruud van Empel asks the question of what can still be called a photographic image these days, and how far you can go in giving shape to that idea. Through the explicit title ‘Collage’, van Empel is linking his digital approach to earlier hand-made processes through which pictures can be composed. He draws his inspiration for this from sources including the drip paintings of Jackson Pollock (USA 1912–1956). The painter’s dynamic treatment is a guideline for a way of depicting nature which still remains recognisable in van Empel’s work, but which contains many characteristics of abstract painting. Accordingly, these works may look a bit more cut and pasted. The impenetrable tropical forest parts in the series show a spottiness that raises more questions as to what exactly it is that we are seeing. If the scenic quality of his work has always been an artificial representation, a dominant painterly quality is now accommodated within it thanks to its lyrical expressiveness. The aesthetic of the work is also now being opened up for discussion: however lovely it may look, is there such a thing as ‘too lovely’, and what exactly does beauty now consist of? To what extent can scarcity of the picture be appreciated, and what are the limits on realism? These are crucial questions that are raised with constantly increasing urgency as Ruud van Empel’s work develops. It is a form of self-reflection which does not close itself off from criticism but which enters into a dialogue with other opinions and working methods. In this work, too, he continues to make use of what he himself has photographed in reality, particularly in Cuba and Surinam. The compositions consist of multiple loosely mounted elements, but a tree is still a tree. In them, the fictional is not an intensified truth, but a truthful image. Ruud Schenk has this to say about these photos in the publication ‘Making Nature’: “They fit within a romantic tradition: idyllic, idealistic, perhaps sentimental, were it not that there is also something off kilter. For all the fabulous virtuosity that underpins the composition of these images of nature, it is still quite obvious that they are not ‘real’. There is an ironic edge to them, an almost satirical exaggeration which negates the sentimental interpretation. Some panoramic woodland scenes from the ‘Collage’ series generate the same eerie feeling that we find in van Empel’s earlier work, while some of the smaller works from this series, such as ‘Collage#2’, approach the boundaries of abstract art.” It may indeed be the case that these works contain a certain irony, but their power still lies in the fact that Ruud van Empel loves his subjects and knows of no better way to express that than by bringing them to life in this way.\n\nFloresta, Floresta Negra (2018)\n\nIn ‘Floresta’ and ‘Floresta Negra’, Ruud van Empel extrapolates the discoveries from ‘Voyage Pittoresque’ to their ultimate consequence. Anyone who has never been in the jungle and only heard tell of it, will not immediately understand that when confronted by it, you get lost in a disconcerting tangle of vegetation. In order to see where you are walking, you literally have to hack your way through. To tackle this unimaginable pressure, van Empel uses not a machete but his digital instruments. With them, he still knows how to create a bright picture out of the mishmash of vegetation. It is an appeal to grasp what you see and understand it. He can only create order in his picture by representing chaos, or conversely by making the chaos accessible in a digitally designed order. While ‘Floresta’ features all the colours of the rainbow, he shows us in ‘Floresta Negra’ how the colour black occurs in nature. Plants, flowers and trees which give the impression of being black are actually dark blue or dark red. An actual black does not exist in reality, any more than white does. In the works of Ruud van Empel, the natural phenomena in their black representation seem to be suffering from vitiligo, a disorder in which the natural pigmentation is affected, resulting in a spotty exterior. You can see it as a contemporary analysis of the discovery that the artist Lucebert (NL 1924–1994) made after the Second World War when he noted ‘beauty has burned her face’. The work of Ruud van Empel, which some people find too beautiful, thus becomes a balm for skin and soul alike. In order to suggest black nature, colour must be broken down into what we perceive as non-colour. Here he does not depict nature at night, but the flora which is experienced as black. To make the intense depth of the work accessible to experience, he shows this work in his solo exhibition at the Museum Belvédère in early 2019 as Archival Pigment prints without protective glass. This emphasises the graphic design of the work and strips a reflective filter away. Among other effects, the black tinges become an intense deep and velvety mat. The perception that makes this work puzzling is that you have a glimpse into a situation where you actually can’t look through it. One of the sources from which van Empel finds the inspiration for this is the realistic paintings which Walter Spies (DE 1895–1942) was making in the 1930s on the Indonesian island of Bali. The enchanting glow, the tangible warmth, the concrete darkness, and the way in which the light falls, are such that they lead to a supernatural interpretation of the perception. In the case of van Empel, this translates into a working method that he refers to as ‘making nature’ in his exhibition at the Belvédère. The fact that Henny de Lange, in the newspaper Trouw on 12 February 2019, characterises ‘Floresta Negra’ as a work ‘not to be missed’, describing it as ‘dark and secretive’ and ‘gruesomely beautiful’, is evidence of her admiration for the battle that van Empel has been waging throughout his career: resisting the notion that beauty these days is prohibited and leads to the condemnation of the artist. Whatever you can say, however unnatural the composite pictures may be, the truth of the matter is that everything has been based on life. There is no detail in Ruud van Empel’s work that he has not observed and undergone in life. He gives still life a living dynamic in which the observation and experience of it dovetail. This means that this is also work which does not derive its quality per se from what is visible in it. It depends what he creates in you as the viewer, what you experience in the picture. Feelings and experiences of emotion, confusion, outrage, temptation, uncertainty and understanding are equal elements in it which can serve to deepen your relationship with the visual arts.\n\nPhoto sketch (1995–2003)\n\nIn 1995, Ruud van Empel is awarded a work grant by the Dutch state, via what is known at the time as the ‘Fonds voor Beeldende Kunst, Vormgeving en Bouwkunst’. He buys a computer in order to experiment with Photoshop on it. The program enables him to manipulate his analogue photos with greater accuracy than is possible in the more traditional photo collages that he is then making with the copier. He has previously been working as a graphic designer for a diverse range of clients across all sorts of media. This has given him the chance to develop his personal artistic view of printing, theatre, interiors, television and production design. During the period 1980–2000, his main activity is design work, which is his destiny after he completes his training as a graphic designer from 1976 to 1981 at the Academie Sint Joost in Breda. What distinguishes him from his peers is both his versatility and his passion for the image over typography and tangible objects.\n\nSince childhood, he has been amassing an image archive, which forms the source that he can draw from, for all of his work. It consists of images and objects, that he finds all over the place, or nowhere at all, and which strike him with their unique character. He discovers that the most extreme consequence of the everyday is that reality emerges as absurd, deranged, banal, brilliant or worthless.\n\nThe experiments with the computer in 1995 have their impact in the free work ‘The Photo sketch’, which is not shown for the first time until 2010 at Flatland Gallery (Utrecht, NL), where he shows it in combination with the series ‘The Office’, previously exhibited in 1998 at Torch Gallery (Amsterdam, NL) at the invitation of Adriaan van der Have (1958–2009).\n\nThe ‘Photo sketch’ works cover the period 1995–2003, a timeframe that represents an important aspect of the way that Ruud van Empel works. His work does start somewhere, but actually it never stops. When the need arises, he can always return to a work that he has already started, pick it up and add something to it, which has never presented itself before. The necessity of such an addition determines whether or not he presses on. This means that he virtually never definitively finishes a work. The ‘Photo sketch’ works can be regarded as exercises in particularising the everyday. They are unsettlingly normal pictures, and they look both very Dutch and universal. Through them, he reaches back to his first free photographic work from the eighties, into which he can breathe new life thanks to the digital technology he now has at his disposal, and which marked the beginning of his career as an artist in the medium of photography.\n\nThe Office (1995–1998, 2001)\n\nAfter the initial experiments in the ‘Photo sketch’ works, Ruud van Empel uses digital manipulation of analogue photos and scanned-in objects such as stones to produce the associated series, in both monochrome and colour, called ‘The Office’. The main focus here is on people sitting at their desks, surrounded almost overwhelmingly by the trophies of their professional lives, in a muted atmosphere reminiscent of historical scenes with a timeless appearance. One striking example is a scene inspired by the British mathematician Andrew Wiles. After years of research, he believes he has found a conclusive proof of Fermat’s last theorem, which when it is published turns out, to his immense disappointment, to contain an error. He presses on and in 1994 he does deliver the proof.\n\nThese photos still show van Empel’s background as a designer of photo collages. As a production designer, he dreams up countless sets. For example, he might scan in some pebbles which are then manipulated into huge mounds in a set. He takes unrealised set ideas for this series, making use of his picture archive and experiments with Photoshop. The experiments that he conducts with the ‘Photo sketch’ works are developed\n\nfurther here. His early work, such as his first ‘Photo Portraits’ and ‘Sketches’, emerges as the precursor of the method that he applies in ‘The Office’ and later in ‘Frame Story’; hand cutting and pasting is replaced by digital manipulation of existing material. In the NRC Handelsblad on 25 February 1999, writing about a presentation of this work at FotoForum in Amersfoort and the Groninger Museum, Nathalie Faber says that van Empel succeeds in depicting “the unbearable lightness and emptiness of being”.\n\nWhat van Empel mostly proves with this work is that the clichéd image that we have of specific situations can be deepened with a somewhat sinister feeling for irony and self- mockery and thereby elevated to a new reality.\n\nThrough this work, Ruud van Empel enters the world of visual art. The work is exhibited by Torch Gallery at the Amsterdam art fair Kunstrai in 1998. This is followed by the first presentation abroad, in June-July 1999 at Carmen Obest Kunstraum in Hamburg and a solo exhibition at the Groninger Museum by Han Steenbruggen (NL 1960), who at that time was the curator for contemporary art.\n\nStudy for Women, The Naarden Studies (1999–2000)\n\nIn the ‘Photo sketch’ and ‘The Office’ works, Ruud van Empel succeeds in depicting an artificial, imagined world. In ‘Study for Women’, he takes up the challenge of composing a true-to-life figure composed of previously photographed elements. To do this, he scans photographs of supermodels into the computer, which he painstakingly blends together with window dummies as the template for the ultimate woman. He makes the series during the period 1999–2000, an era when digital technology is developing rapidly and offering ever wider possibilities\n\nThe totally artificial women he composes are perfect down to the tiniest detail, with the representation just of a single arm potentially being made up of four photos. He uses up to 250 photos for each separate image. The typical feature of this work is that the women have vulnerable eyes, yet at the same time they have an untouchable look about them.\n\nArt lovers find that this work recalls associations with magic realism and the work of Pyke Koch (NL 1901–1991), but ‘The Naarden Studies’ are certainly not literal interpretations of that school of art. Magic realism shows a reality that is connected to an undefined atmosphere, which makes the work hard to pin down and gives it a secret and sometimes menacing character. Instead, van Empel’s work has more to do with unreal women who are thrown back on themselves in an unambiguous environment. You also see reflections of more contemporary forms of female portraiture, specifically those made by women of themselves, such as Cindy Sherman. Through this work he also addresses the subject of innocence and its contradictory nature, an aspect in his work that has already been identified by curator Moniek IJzermans (NL 1967), who includes him in the exhibition ‘Het verlies van onschuld’ (The loss of innocence) at FAXX by the University of Tilburg (NL).\n\nThrough this series, he develops from a graphic designer definitively into a visual artist. This work earns him a solo exhibition at Galerie Bernini in Barcelona, after he has taken part in 2000 in the Primavera Fotografica in that city.\n\nThe female studies result in a complementary series from 2003, which he makes for Fotofestival Naarden, one of the major annual photographic events in the Netherlands. For the main presentation in the Grote Kerk in Naarden, he makes fourteen works in which he places photographs of women against background settings which have been composed in intricate detail, including a woodland landscape and a seascape. Although it is now the background that is mostly made up of countless collected images, the women actually look more artificial than these landscapes, as if they have been smoothed out, and in their mostly androgynous appearance they project an image of womanhood that can be construed as a statement about how women are commonly depicted. Van Empel’s women are strong, self-possessed and elusive. In that sense, this work chimes well with the theme of Fotofestival Naarden 2003: ‘Grenzeloos (boundless)’. For this series, he makes use for the first time of models, still captured via analogue photography.\n\nUntitled, Study in Green (2003–2004)\n\n‘The backgrounds in ‘The Naarden Series’ take autonomous form in ‘Study in Green’, which dates from 2003–2004. These works combine earlier analogue photos with digital photos that he takes at various locations in the natural environment in order to combine them into autonomous landscapes. The pictures are rich in all manner of details which demonstrate a credible harmony, but which in reality cannot be encountered as such. In the deep green wooded areas with sinuous root structures, and a sense of depth that is unusual in landscape art, you see flowers, insects and animals that come from diverse sources. Van Empel shows clearly that he borrows specific pictorial elements from art history. In general, what fascinates him is not the work of the most well- known artists, a fact which gives an insight into the importance he attaches to what is going on outside of the mainstream.\n\nViewing these photos is a determining voyage of discovery, in which an owl, a deer, a butterfly, a grasshopper, a snail or a wolf in the entourage of an almost menacing natural environment of dark green trees and plants and colourful flowers produce an illusion of pristine nature. The idyll being imagined here takes on an interpretation that has an unsettling effect, just as with many imaginings of the\n\nGarden of Eden before the Fall. This illusion creates mistrust and internal resistance against the overwhelmingly pure beauty of nature, which stands on the point of being corrupted by the looming hulk of original sin, the eating of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge.\n\nWhat is paradoxical in the work is the effect of depth and the way that every element functions with the same intensity both in the foreground and in the background of the composition. Because the digitally photographed elements from which the overall work is made up are all correspondingly precise, the whole image is actually flat. Despite this, the illusion of depth he manages to create is overwhelming. He cancels out short-sightedness and long-sightedness. In this way, in a photographic sense, Ruud van Empel adds something to the conventional pictorial subject of the perspective effect. The title ‘Study in Green’ is chosen because at that particular time, van Empel feels that he is still studying the possibilities that the new technologies have to offer. In the same way that for the viewer, it is a voyage of discovery to linger visually in these works, for van Empel it is a precise and analytical study into his art historical relationship with the landscape. Simultaneously, it is a study of form and style that, as an artist, he has designed to refine his personal signature and make it more emphatic.\n\nRuud van Empel also refines views about the depiction of innocence and beauty in the work ‘Untitled’ from 2004. He places young girls – blondes, redheads and brunettes alike – in wooded landscapes, their gaze fixed shamelessly on the viewer. He presents innocence here as a specific characteristic, aiming to suggest beauty not sentimentally or fraudulently, but in a pure and unequivocal way. He photographs children whose images he manipulates to make them look more doll-like in order to reinforce the illusion of innocence.\n\n‘Untitled’ is interpreted by the media in all sorts of different ways, some of them very dubious. He is producing this work at a time when there are massive concerns in the Netherlands about Marc Dutroux (a Belgian man convicted of paedophilia and murder). The combination of a ‘spooky wood’ and ‘a little girl all alone’ conjures up associations for some people which make the work suspicious on the grounds of an unwholesome sexualised view of young children.\n\nWorld (2005–2008, 2010, 2017)\n\nRuud van Empel has drilled down into the phenomenon of xenophobia – the fear of foreigners. This investigation results in a series of works that you can see as reactions to racism, homophobia, gender issues and so on. He does not adopt the position of an activist, but through his series of photographs he shows an integral world picture in which everyone is equal, however much people may differ from one another.\n\nRuud van Empel’s series ‘World’ proposes a seemingly unequivocal answer to the false assumptions, particularly with regard to xenophobia, which to some extent happened with ‘Study in Green’ and ‘Untitled’, although they did also earn a lot of positive attention and appreciation. ‘World’ also takes innocence as its theme, showing children in their best clothes in a bewitching natural environment. Girls of colour in white dresses with branches of flowers in their hands against the background of plants with huge leaves and bathed in sunshine, a little boy of colour looking at his reflection in a pond, a lad in shorts who looks as though he is talking to a little bird on his hand, a little girl in a blue dress with a cuddly toy on her arm who is alive to her, a young boy surfacing from a pond surrounded by lily leaves, etc. The striking thing is that van Empel has taken traditional tropes such as the myth of Narcissus and looked at them from a quite different point of view by now placing a young boy of colour in that role. This is a sizeable series of works which in terms of both content and technique is inescapable in the pronounced quality and choice of subject matter. He uses these works to show that racial difference is artificial and that everyone is equal. He uses everything at his disposal as an artist to challenge ideas we may have about people who look different. Recognition comes when the series goes on show in the United States. Van Empel is asked by Deborah Klochko in 2006 to participate in the exhibition ‘Picturing Eden’ in the George Eastman House, which is also displayed the following year at the Museum of Photographic Art (MoPA), of which Klochko is the director. A work from ‘World’ makes the cover of the accompanying catalogue. This exhibition and its catalogue spearhead the international breakthrough of the work. The African- American community in the United States of America reacts enthusiastically: they feel as if they are becoming visible. They see someone showing that the innocence and beauty of children of colour can be celebrated and admired.\n\nThe images of children in this series trace their roots back to childhood photos that his father took of him. The innocence of these photos is partly the result of the unaffected poses and the dated children’s clothing.\n\nAt the same time, Ruud van Empel’s participation in the solo show ‘Perfection/ Imperfection’ at the Stefan Stux Gallery in New York launches his photographic work on the international stage, and from that moment on, his reputation is ensured.\n\nAfter this series, Ruud van Empel’s work becomes known all over the world. ‘World’ is talked about extensively in countless publications and features on the covers of many magazines and photography books. Four of these works are added to the collection of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.\n\nMoon, Venus (2005–2008)\n\nThanks to the impression made by the ‘World’ series, Ruud van Empel realises that he is not finished yet with this subject matter. This leads to the series ‘Moon’ and ‘Venus’.\n\n‘Moon’ is the nocturnal counterpart of ‘World’, in which he places moonlit children in the natural world. The ‘Venus’ series includes young girls whose behaviour and gestures are strongly reminiscent of Lucas Granach the Elder. By presenting girls of colour in this art history context as a contemporary Venus, van Empel\n\nis correcting the perspective. In the history of western art, it is extremely unusual for women of colour to be seen as an ideal of beauty of dazzling innocence. Elves and nymphs, princesses and fairies: they are all Caucasian. Van Empel shows that they are also of colour. And precisely by also giving Caucasian girls the same role in the series, he reinforces the idea of equality. Whatever the colour of the children’s skin, they are all the same.\n\nVan Empel also explores the ideas of ‘day’ and ‘night’. He finds the dark so much more mysterious, atmospheric and quiet than the daylight. In several series, he creates both daytime and night scenes in order to make the meaning of the work more layered.\n\nWhen it comes to depicting Venus, he runs up against another problem. Differing sensitivities in various countries mean that he feels obliged to depict her ‘nudity’ with the necessary circumspection in a puritanical country such as America, while in the liberal Netherlands and other Western European countries, he can go a step further on that score, something that also has to do with that direct reference to Granach, whose naked young women have never been suspected of being the perversions of a sexually obsessed man.\n\nThis experience bolsters Ruud van Empel in the conviction that no historical style, movement or school can remain immune in playing a role in this work. He also hides nothing in that regard. As an artist, he is obliged to engage with the global ramifications of art history in order to be able to determine what position he can occupy for himself within it. The same applies to the cultural traditions in all parts of the world. It is his pure intention to liberate these from a one-sided ‘folkloric’ approach by making them into a universal language and giving them meaning within the context of his work.\n\nIn an observation on 7 October 2012 in U-T San Diego, Pat Sherman writes about an associated presentation at the MoPA of van Empel’s work: “One of the most striking initial reactions to the series ‘World’, ‘Moon’, ‘Venus’ by the Dutch photographer Ruud van Empel, is how much the works resemble Renaissance paintings. Yet there is something subtly creepy about them, and there are questions about the heavenly landscapes and subjects that draw the eye and make it linger, looking for the finer details.”\n\nSouvenir, Souvenir d’Intime (2008, 2015)\n\nIn 2007, Ruud van Empel’s atelier practice is at a virtual standstill, because he has taken it upon himself to care for his terminally ill mother, Corrie Couweleers.\n\nThe realisation that everything that your mother knows about you is lost when she dies, hits him hard. Van Empel is 48 at the time and decides to reconstruct everything that his mother knows about him, however inadequate. He goes through the same procedure when his father dies in 2011. When it comes to the objects saved, the legacy of both his parents borders on the obsessive, comparable to the way in which he himself builds his photo archive and collects, takes and stores tens of thousands of images in order to be able to convert them, through his photographic work, into an autonomous world. His parents’ marriage, which produced three children, ends in divorce. Both his mother and his father hold on to relics from the past with the greatest care. His father, in particular, hoards everything, and these shadows from the past see the light of day again when his ex-wife passes away. His father’s stuff is mostly personal artefacts from himself and his children, while his mother’s is those utilitarian objects essential in daily life but which, once they are deprived of their purpose, take on a symbolic meaning in terms of how life is and has been lived.\n\nIn what his parents leave behind, he also comes across plenty about himself, which he makes sensually accessible in the honourable tradition of Marcel Proust’s Madeleine effect in the series ‘Souvenir d’Intime‘: childhood drawings, toys, self-portraits, passport photos, drawings of battle scenes, academic studies, but also his love letters and those of girls from his primary school class, and all his father’s bits and bobs, right down to his PTT (the Dutch Postal Service) cap and false teeth; memorabilia relating to his father’s time in Indonesia during the war of independence there, his mother’s embroidery things and touching, tangible mementoes of his late sister.\n\nIf this work is hard-hitting, then the series ‘Souvenir’ is, if anything, even more harrowing. He endeavours to make the almost unbearable, personal character of this work more acceptable by having his photo compositions accompanied by short poetic texts. You would be able to call them ‘poems’, but in reality they stem more from the tradition of the literary movement of the Informals of the early sixties in the Netherlands, with neutral observations around everyday situations: found footage and then its documentary description where personal experiences trickle down. Nothing about this work has been specifically intended for the occasion. The combination of the objects produces an inescapable image.\n\nThe full ‘Souvenir’ series (2008) is acquired for the collection of the Noordbrabants Museum in ‘s-Hertogenbosch.\n\nGeneration, Wonder, Club (2010–2011)\n\nUntil 2009, the people, especially the young children, in Ruud van Empel’s work are placed singly or in pairs against a scenic background. Their presence is emphatic in the picture, and represents a world view with regard to skin colour and cultural differences which may be experienced as controversial from the social point of view.\n\nThe ‘Generation’ series from 2010 derives from his curiosity at placing multiple figures together, but also from the mission of revisiting the subject of xenophobia. Prior to the tripartite ‘Generation’, he begins working carefully with small groups of four, and later eight, children. His own school photos from the early sixties form the inspiration for the three works in ‘Generation’ in the 124 x 330 cm format. These school photos are traditionally composed of three rows of children posed formally against a neutral background. The reminiscences of the nineteen sixties are very potent, with the spectacle frames, clothing and hairstyles, but taken all together, these groups form a timeless image of the future prospects that these young people betray through their external appearances.\n\n‘Generation #1’ shows a school class in which only a single child of colour is visible, a circumstance which was typical of school classes when van Empel was a child, and one which is also recognised as a given by his Caucasian peers. The picture did not emerge in the shape of a class photo by photographing all the children together as a group. For each individual child, he uses four separately photographed models, and the details in appearance and dress are composed digitally, altered and/or added in order to achieve the penetrating individuation of each one that go together to make up this group.\n\n‘Generation #2’ is a similar class photo, but this time it exclusively shows children of colour. Van Empel is showing how widely the skin tones of the children vary. They are all different, and yet they are all equal in the class. The shades of skin colour are identical to the variations in skin colour of the Caucasian children. Van Empel is speaking up against the generalisation that dark people form one single ‘type’, they too experience very many shades in appearance and skin colour. By showing people of colour in all their vulnerability and beauty, Ruud van Empel is contributing to a subtle conversation about this sensitive issue.\n\nIn ‘Generation #3’, he goes a step further in looking at prejudices around appearances and skin colour by presenting a class of Jewish children. Over the course of history, Jewish people have been defined in a negative way by external features, which culminated in the Nazi caricature of the Jew with a big nose, pouting lips, a squinting expression and a pale skin. This stereotype can be traced back to the Middle Ages. Van Empel shows that being Jewish is not tied to external features, and certainly not to the features of a ‘race’. Van Empel’s Jewish school class is multicultural, with European, Asian and African children, making the point that Jewish people are united by their religion and that there is ultimately only one race: the human race. Both the Groninger Museum and the Jewish Historical Museum in Amsterdam have acquired the works for their collections. This multicultural nature of the human race is something that he focuses on more intensely in ‘Wonder’. In the largest work, which measures 124 x 393.5 cm, there are more than a hundred children. The way in which all the children look penetratingly at you is almost frightening, as is their sheer number. Every figure is built up from photos of several models, and the composition is extremely complicated. He is fascinated by how masses of people have been captured in photographs, like in the image by Weegee of a mass of bathers on Coney Island. By making this horde of people so colourful, he also references an inspiration from the history of art: ‘Christ’s Entry into Brussels’ by James Ensor.\n\nThe smaller work ‘Club’, which measures just 60 x 156 cm, is a strikingly different type of group portrait. It is a group of boys who are taking their first swimming lesson and are standing shivering on the tiled floor at the side of the pool. The boys’ swimming trunks make an endearing, helpless impression, shot through with their fearless eagerness to be getting on with life. The variety in attitudes, from cool to bashful, and the differences in build, from slim to chunky, make it clear that van Empel is not generalising about this generation of kids. He lets every child be seen precisely in his own individual vulnerability. This speaks to the potential of youth. These are the heroes and macho men of tomorrow, soldiers driven by blood lust as they launch an attack. The contrast between the awkwardness of the lads at the swimming pool and the expectations for the future which are thus expressed makes this work into a disarming demonstration of the fate that man calls down upon himself.\n\nTheatre (2010–2013)\n\nIn English, ‘‘theatre’’ is the military term for an area in which war is waged. This expresses the frightening beauty which is associated with a life-and-death battle. The wondrous aesthetic of death, ruin and destruction forms the starting point for the panoramic image (100 x 300 cm) of a blonde girl in a blue dress in a dark wood where the sunlight is catching the precise spot in the distance where she is standing. It is clear that Ruud van Empel uses his work to question ideas about good taste and aesthetics. He shows that, what from a one- sided view of contemporary image culture is perceived as sentimental or uncomfortable, is an assumption which in art history terms, can be overturned by earlier and perhaps future visions. He sees everything that is regarded as (too) lovely or as excessive and exaggeratedly aesthetic as a reason to take a different look at it, in order to discover precisely what its qualities are.\n\nAnother panoramic work shows a young deer in a dark wood. The sentiment that Bambi arouses is shamelessly exploited. According to Ruud van Empel, you can indeed reject such an image because of the unambiguous emotion it is trying to create, but that still does not mean that if you are walking in the wood yourself and you meet a fawn, you are not going to stand and gaze at it open-mouthed. The essential elements of this experience are given form by him in this work. The smaller 120 x 120 cm works from ‘Theatre’ show a defenceless scenic beauty which as yet has no inkling of what fate has in store for it. After a battle which may be about to be waged there, it will be declared a ‘guilty landscape’. In that way, this work references the work of the artist Armando (NL 1929–2018), who, in his reflections on the aftermath of the Second World War, portrayed woodland edges as indifferent witnesses to war crimes in his paintings.\n\n‘Theatre’, which began in 2010, is a series that is expanded every couple of years with new work. An example of such a later work is the composition with blooming cactuses that appears on the cover of this publication. Their brutal beauty has been encapsulated by van Empel in an almost architectural representation of unapproachable nature.\n\nStill Life (2014–2015, 2017)\n\nThe ‘Still Life’ series shows classical symbolism of the past with putrid fish, rotting fruit, mouldy bread, stuffed animals, foetuses in formaldehyde, a display of butcher’s goods, offal and fossilised stones and shells. These are confrontational images that are a reflection on how, over the course of history, man has thought about his own mortality in relation to flora and fauna. His pictorial language is very obviously borrowed from the Dutch painters of the 17th century. The critic Ronald Ockhuysen writes in ‘Het Parool’ on September 15, 2009: “Still Life-mushrooms, a lusty still life that references the vanity paintings of the seventeenth century, in which mould plays a key part, hosts a whole arsenal of stories and insights. This work sees van Empel on top form, as an artist who is reinventing photography and striking a massive blow at reality with his reconstructions.”Before his mother passes away in 2007,\n\nRuud van Empel has already lost his disabled sister in 1992 at the age of 21. From that point onwards, thoughts of mortality and the past take on an increasingly important role in his work. He goes about it in a ruthless way, taking on the eye of an outsider. For himself, it is an obvious necessity to depict the personal intimacy of recollections represented by tangible objects in a dependent relationship with one another. What is striking is that this work is less recognised outside the Netherlands. But it is a classic Dutch topic, one that has always played a prominent role, including in Dutch literature, the high point being the legendary novel ‘De avonden’ (The Evenings) by one of the 20th century’s greatest Dutch writers, Gerard Reve (1923–2006). The starting point here is that reality is more unbelievable than fiction, a notion, which in the case of Ruud van Empel, makes it hard for non- Dutch people to identify with.\n\nThe reception that greets his new work in the United States is typical. This is how Jeff Stafford reacts on 7 October 2014 to a presentation at Jackson Fine Art in Atlanta:\n\n“The more unsettling tone of the new work may possibly be attributable to the artist’s reaction to modern media, in particular the way that they dehumanize us instead of improving communication. Whether you reject or embrace this new direction in van Empel’s career, the recent work delivers persuasive new evidence that he is blurring the line between photography and painting more and more, by means of his digital manipulations and photo-real collages.”\n\nMondo del Silenzio (2015)\n\n‘Mondo del Silenzio’ consists of natural watery landscapes. He uses a layering technique to depict both the surface of the water and the depths, with the reflection of the sunlight upon them and their almost tangible transparency. This layered look lends itself very well to the use of Photoshop to work out these ideas, which van Empel is anxious to fine tune for a long time before adding the children. This series marks the start of a series of five in which nature plays the main role and there are no people or animals in them. Nature itself has become the subject.\n\nThe properties of water are something that Ruud van Empel has included earlier in his work as a sub-topic, for instance in the ‘Venus’ works where young girls appear out of the water. In ‘Mondo del Silenzio’ he descends into the water. By including the insects on the water’s surface and the fishes that swim in it, he combines both the underwater view and from above. The still, alien, watery world is expressed in this series of photographs in all its majesty of unfamiliar sea creatures and plants. The colour effect varies from photo to photo, from pale and a little bit blurry to being reminiscent of a fairy-tale and brightly coloured. The way that he treats the water as a fluid material is very striking. All the elements that go to make up the separate works have been photographed over the years by van Empel himself in aquaria and natural history museums. This collection of material is a sea of images to which things can be added anywhere and at any time. From that point of view, Ruud van Empel is never off duty. Wherever he is, he collects images for his archive. Life itself constantly feeds his art. In that respect, he is a true heir to Joseph Beuys, and his belief that an artist does not have weekends. He is subject to the time-honoured ‘hunger for images’, constantly adding new creatures to the water that so bewitch him.\n\nThe series has two extremes: on the one hand is the captivating, colourful underwater world with ornate shells and creatures, on the other is the murky, impenetrable water where plants shimmer and fade. What links them is, as the title suggests, is the fact that this world is silent. It is a silence instantly recognisable to anyone who swims underwater: everything sounds muffled and far away. The pressure on your ears increases the deeper you dive, so that your senses force you more and more inwards on yourself. As you become short of air, the urge to return to the surface and the world of sound and light slowly makes itself felt. To experience another world, we don’t necessarily need to head off into space: the underwater world can offer us sensations that touch us at least as profoundly.\n\nMood (2015–2016)\n\nThe ‘Mood’ series consists of nine works in which Ruud van Empel generates a mood between light and dark as soberly as possible using lots of dark tones. He makes portraits of children in atmospheric nocturnal settings. One can question whether these are truly ‘portraits’. Because the image is made up of hundreds\n\nof elements from separately photographed details, the intensified verisimilitude of the technique is also immediately an ideal artificial construct. When printing them, he uses Archival Pigment Print, making it possible to use an intense deep black in visible nuances.\n\n‘Mood’ can be construed as a revisiting of the ‘Moon’ series of photographs from 2005–2006, in which he places children in landscapes illuminated by the blue light of the moon.\n\nFor the figures in the photos, he makes use of models who come to his studio with their mothers. He works with the modelling agency ‘Kids’, and the care that working with children requires involves the processing of every photo taking easily a week or even two. As with all his portrait works, he composes a new face from earlier shots of different children. For Ruud van Empel, ‘Mood’ is also\n\nfirst and foremost an exercise in simplicity. This may seem to be inconsistent with the extremely laborious and subtle compilation of his pictures, but the very saying that ‘the master shows himself through simplicity’ applies perfectly to this work. The result looks effortless and obvious.\n\nThe photos show children who immediately evoke a feeling of emotion. At the same time, the work is a commentary on how art uses such feelings. Art appreciation by and large is suspicious of it and ‘the weeping gypsy boy’ is often wheeled out as the definitive disqualification. This is to forget that in the 19th century, as Mariette Haveman (1957) shows in her book ‘Het feest achter de gordijnen’ (The party behind the curtains), the young gypsy boy was originally an image cultivated by the intelligentsia to endorse their rejection of child abuse and child labour.\n\nAs the gypsy boy has been embraced by large layers of society in the 20th century, the higher cultural echelons have withdrawn from him to the same extent. Mass reproduction of him also has the effect that the image is barely taken seriously in art now. It has tipped over into the realm of kitsch and is a trope that\n\nattracts ridicule and scorn. Ruud van Empel is interested in the demise of a representation and his work delivers a commentary on it by making these preconceptions into a problem and updating them.\n\n‘Mood’ ties in with the necessity that he feels to provide some light and shade here. However innocently presented, a child of colour is still a target for discrimination. He made the series for an exhibition at Huxley Parlour Gallery in London. The images invite us to approach them with a human eye, rather than label them ‘cute’ or ‘endearing’. But that there is also a history mingled in, where that gaze is returned with shame and an awareness of guilt. These photographs therefore provide a dimension of profundity to the sentimentality, which they equally evoke.\n\nVoyage Pittoresque (2016–2019)\n\nIn ‘Voyage Pittoresque’, Ruud van Empel shows no people. This series of photographs could be construed as the democratisation of diverse iterations of the landscape, just as his group portraits are an example of the humanisation of prejudices regarding race, colour, appearance and origins.\n\nIn ‘Voyage Pittoresque’, he shows us ideal landscapes which from the aesthetic point of view are stunning in their refinement of the use of colour and the creation of visual order out of a totally natural chaos. What he does in his portraits – everyone, whether in the foreground or in the background, is rendered with equal intensity – he repeats here in these landscapes. Van Empel guides the eye through the blooming profusion of overgrown landscapes, making the viewer experience their confusion as insightful.\n\nThe title of the work is borrowed from an expression coined by Henk van Os, the former director of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, who used it to describe the ‘Grand Tour’ ventures of artists from earlier centuries. Diverse travel experiences were allowed to feed into compositions planned in the atelier. Everything in these paintings is ‘true to life’ and ‘painted from reality’, but they are in no sense realistic. You will never encounter any of these romanticised landscapes in the same quality in the outside\n\nworld, but this fact does not take away from their credibility as works of art. They are completely artificial representations of what the artist observed at various points on his journey. While such ‘Grand Tour landscapes’ are often distant panoramic views with a ‘repoussoir’ placed in the foreground to give the illusion of depth, van Empel’s work is all about the frog perspective. From ground level, you are looking up at the vegetation that seems impenetrable, but those who make it their home are still able to find a way through. You are right in the middle of it. As in many of his photographic series, this work also features daytime and nocturnal variations. The differences in atmosphere ensure an overarching context that is in contrast. Day and night now come together and share responsibility for an accurate experience of the passage of time.\n\nVan Empel has composed his idealised landscapes from photos that he has taken in places including Sri Lanka, Naples, Morocco, Atlanta, Scotland, Cuba and Surinam. It\n\nis ‘manufactured nature’, for which he interweaves both house- plants and wild flowers and plants into a credible landscape that is in fact is artificial. Although the beauty of many of these landscapes portraits is untouchable, he still lets us see that he also has an eye for touching them.\n\nIn 2019, ‘Voyage Pittoresque’ forms part of the solo exhibition ‘Making Nature’ at the Museum Belvédère in Oranjewoud, Heerenveen (NL). In the publication of the same name produced for the occasion, the essay by Ruud Schenk places van Empel’s fascination with nature within the tradition of authors such as John Keats (1795–1821), Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862) and the Dutchman Frederik van Eeden (1860–1932). They attribute qualities to untamed nature which are being more and more disregarded in the rapidly industrialising world. As Schenk puts it: “I had to think about it when I saw [the] recent series ‘Floresta’ and ‘Voyage Pittoresque’, which seem almost literally to have been created from the point of view of a low-flying dragonfly. The fairy-tale beauty of these worlds of flowers and plants actually occurs only in folk tales – or maybe in a child’s imagination? In that sense they are of a piece with the fictional children’s portraits for which van Empel has become famous. These children were also standing in surroundings reminiscent of paradise, which have been further refined in the recent nature works in more detail and more lavishly.”\n\nCollage (2017)\n\nIn ‘Collage’, Ruud van Empel asks the question of what can still be called a photographic image these days, and how far you can go in giving shape to that idea. Through the explicit title ‘Collage’, van Empel is linking his digital approach to earlier hand-made processes through which pictures can be composed. He draws his inspiration for this from sources including the drip paintings of Jackson Pollock (USA 1912–1956). The painter’s dynamic treatment is a guideline for a way of depicting nature which still remains recognisable in van Empel’s work, but which contains many characteristics of abstract painting. Accordingly, these works may look a bit more cut and pasted.\n\nThe impenetrable tropical forest parts in the series show a spottiness that raises more questions as to what exactly it is that we are seeing. If the scenic quality of his work has always been an artificial representation, a dominant painterly quality is now accommodated within it thanks to its lyrical expressiveness. The aesthetic of the work is also now being opened up for discussion: however lovely it may look, is there such a thing as ‘too lovely’, and what exactly does beauty now consist of? To what extent can scarcity of the picture be appreciated, and what are the limits on realism? These are crucial questions that are raised with constantly increasing urgency as Ruud van Empel’s\n\nwork develops. It is a form of self-reflection which does not close itself off from criticism but which enters into a dialogue with other opinions and working methods.\n\nIn this work, too, he continues to make use of what he himself has photographed in reality, particularly in Cuba and Surinam. The compositions consist of multiple loosely mounted elements, but a tree is still a tree. In them, the fictional is not an intensified truth, but a truthful image.\n\nRuud Schenk has this to say about these photos in the publication ‘Making Nature’: “They fit within a romantic tradition: idyllic, idealistic, perhaps sentimental, were it not that there is also something off kilter. For all the fabulous virtuosity that underpins the composition of these images of nature, it is still quite obvious that they are not ‘real’. There is an ironic edge to them, an almost satirical exaggeration which negates the sentimental interpretation. Some panoramic woodland scenes from the ‘Collage’ series generate the same eerie feeling that we find in van Empel’s earlier work, while some of the smaller works from this series, such as ‘Collage#2’, approach the boundaries of abstract art.”\n\nIt may indeed be the case that these works contain a certain irony, but their power still lies in the fact that Ruud van Empel loves his subjects and knows of no better way to express that than by bringing them to life in this way.\n\nFloresta, Floresta Negra (2018)\n\nIn ‘Floresta’ and ‘Floresta Negra’, Ruud van Empel extrapolates the discoveries from ‘Voyage Pittoresque’ to their ultimate consequence. Anyone who has never been in the jungle and only heard tell of it, will not immediately understand that when confronted by it, you get lost in a disconcerting tangle of vegetation. In order to see where you are walking, you literally have to hack your way through. To tackle this unimaginable pressure, van Empel uses not a machete but his digital instruments. With them, he still knows how to create a bright picture out of the mishmash of vegetation. It is an appeal to grasp what you see and understand it. He can only create order in his picture by representing chaos, or conversely by making the chaos accessible in a digitally designed order.\n\nWhile ‘Floresta’ features all the colours of the rainbow, he shows us in ‘Floresta Negra’ how the colour black occurs in nature. Plants, flowers and trees which give the impression of being black are actually dark blue or dark red. An actual black does not exist in reality, any more than white does. In the works of Ruud van Empel, the natural phenomena in their black representation seem to be suffering from vitiligo, a disorder in which the natural pigmentation is affected, resulting in a spotty exterior. You can see it as a contemporary analysis of the discovery that the artist Lucebert (NL 1924–1994) made after the Second World War when he noted ‘beauty has burned her face’. The work of Ruud van Empel, which some people find too beautiful, thus becomes a balm for skin and soul alike.\n\nIn order to suggest black nature, colour must be broken down into what we perceive as non-colour. Here he does not depict nature at night, but the flora which is experienced as black. To make the intense depth of the work accessible to experience, he shows this work in his solo exhibition at the Museum Belvédère in early 2019 as Archival Pigment prints without protective glass. This emphasises the graphic design of the work and strips a reflective filter away. Among other effects, the black tinges become an intense deep and velvety mat.\n\nThe perception that makes this work puzzling is that you have a glimpse into a situation where you actually can’t look through it. One of the sources from which van Empel finds the inspiration for this is the realistic paintings which Walter Spies (DE 1895–1942) was making in the 1930s on the Indonesian island of Bali. The enchanting glow, the tangible warmth, the concrete darkness, and the way in which the light falls, are such that they lead to a supernatural interpretation of the perception. In the case of van Empel, this translates into a working method that he refers to as ‘making nature’ in his exhibition at the Belvédère. The fact that Henny de Lange, in the newspaper Trouw on 12 February 2019, characterises ‘Floresta Negra’ as a work ‘not to be missed’, describing it as ‘dark and secretive’ and ‘gruesomely beautiful’, is evidence of her admiration for the battle that van Empel has been waging throughout his career: resisting the notion that beauty these days is prohibited and leads to the condemnation of the artist.\n\nWhatever you can say, however unnatural the composite pictures may be, the truth of the matter is that everything has been based on life. There is no detail in Ruud van Empel’s work that he has not observed and undergone in life. He gives still life a living dynamic in which the observation and experience of it dovetail. This means that this is also work which does not derive its quality per se from what is visible in it. It depends what he creates in you as the viewer, what you experience in the picture. Feelings and experiences of emotion, confusion, outrage, temptation, uncertainty and understanding are equal elements in it which can serve to deepen your relationship with the visual arts."
