        "text": "Marcel van Eeden (*1965, Den Haag NL) has been known for his drawings. For more than thirty years, he has been working according to a fixed concept: he makes drawings that are based on old photographs, advertisements and postcards that date before 1965, the year of his birth.\n\nHe started with individual drawings, but later also made narrative series of drawings, in which not only the image but also the text originated before 1965.\n\nNow photography has been added as a new element. Because he takes the pictures himself, they are for the first time images of today. Van Eeden sees them as reportages, and they do always have a connection with the time before 1965. They show places where something happened in the years before Van Eeden was born. What exactly is often not clear. So, in fact, it is a further development of the concept, but now illuminated from a different angle. Because the photographs were made using an old technique, the gum print, there is also a connection with history. This technique makes it possible to print the photos on the same paper on which Van Eeden draws. This creates an entirely new unity and connection between photograph and drawing."
