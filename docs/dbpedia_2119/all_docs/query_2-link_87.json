        "text": "The new look Loosen Up Your Painting website is ready for you!\n\nThe growing membership to Loosen Up Your Painting.com has been great to see. There have been regular monthly lessons covering painting topics in depth. Artists are uploading photos of their paintings for critique and a new Q&A section has been added. You can ask for feedback on whatever painting questions you may have.\n\nWhy Loose Painting?\n\nDo you find that your paintings need something extra, but you are just not sure what it is? A touch more life and feeling that would express your idea better? How do artists get that impressionist style to work and not turn their paintings into a muddy mess?\n\nIf you have similar questions you know how frustrating it is to get the answers you need! I had this issue for years and it was making me bonkers. Was it a big secret? Why could I not find the answer to that fresh painting style I so wanted? Well the truth is that almost all painting books do not answer these questions. Mostly they cater to artists starting out. Beyond that it is a mist of confusion.\n\nThe Answer to My Search\n\nFinally I started putting the pieces together. Learning the language of painting was a huge step in the right direction. This discovery is the basis on my course Learn to Paint With Impact. But there was more to find out. The most common question was how to lose the tight painting style that many artists still struggled with.\n\nThis was going to be another step up in the learning curve. Painting loose does not mean sloppy painting. In fact a sound knowledge of painting techniques is required. Plus confidence with colour and brushwork is required. Once again I could not find a dedicated resource on this topic. So I decided to make one where I could share what I learned with other artists. In turn artists could share their journey and help others too.\n\nMembership for a Song\n\nAfter talking to artists it was also clear that regular high quality lessons and personal feedback would be essential for this site. Of course despite enthusiasm this does take much time and some cost too. This meant that a small membership fee would be necessary. But at only $4.99 per month this should be a worthwhile investment for artists. There is a free 7-day trial too.\n\nYou can also select the Annual Option and save 20%.\n\nWhat Can You Expect?\n\nMonthly lessons with in depth HD quality video;\n\nWritten reports and downloads\n\nArtist's challenge where you can upload a photo of your painting for comment;\n\nRequest a personal painting critique from me and from other artists;\n\nA Q&A section where you can add a question on any painting topic\n\nFull access to past lessons\n\nSneak Peek\n\nSee video lessons on:\n\nHow to use large brushstrokes,\n\npainting in layers\n\nhow to draw and paint boats (coming in November)\n\nEssential brushwork techniques demonstrated (coming in December)\n\nHow to paint a beach scene\n\nLearn mixing color with confidence\n\nPlus loads more\n\nTake if for a Spin\n\nIf you are curious, take the resource for a test and see whether it will add value to your painting. I am sure it will. Most importantly to get more value out you can contribute and ask questions that will help others too. You can learn more and sign up here.\n\n​I look forward to meeting you and helping you to loosen up your painting.\n\nSo you want to start painting? I am delighted with your decision, because painting is one of the most rewarding pastimes available to us. No doubt you have some time available and want a relaxing hobby? Painting will do that for you. If you want to rekindle your painting talent from earlier days before other commitments got in the way you also have my undivided attention.\n\nYou see I intended to follow an art career after high school. But back in the day art and career were two words that did not go together well. Instead I went into the attorney business. Like many other artists before me, including the famous Henri Matisse and Wassily Kandinsky, I did eventually escape and returned to art. Phew! Now I have the pleasure of painting professionally and teaching other artists how to paint better too. I am truly grateful for that.\n\nWhich brings me back to you. In this article and ones to follow I am going to take you along a journey of discovery. I hope to show you how to paint with confidence. More importantly how to focus on what is important so that you get excellent results quickly. My job is not to peddle a paint-by-numbers system. You deserve much better. Instead I will show you how to see like an artist so that you can develop your unique style.\n\nFirst let us make sure you have the necessary kit for painting. I am going to focus on oil painting since that is my first love.\n\nEquipment Essentials:\n\nA word of caution here. There is great potential to spend a small fortune then experience buyer’s remorse. Often the precious materials are then stored away never to be seen again. We do not want that to happen. So my list of materials is lean and ripped. Essentials that will not cost a lot, but will give you the results you will be proud of.\n\nPaints:\n\nA few colors are critical:\n\n1. Titanium white\n\n2. Cadmium red light\n\n3. Cadmium yellow light (or lemon)\n\n4. Ultramarine Blue\n\n5. Cerulean Blue\n\n6. Alizarin Crimson\n\nConvenience Colors:\n\n1. Burnt Sienna\n\n2. Yellow Ochre\n\nSo few colors? Yes, it is far better to get good quality student paints than too many colors. I will show you how to mix colors with confidence and you will get better results. Plus your confidence as an artist will soar when you discover how you can mix all the colors you need from the above few tubes. A good student brand is Maimeri Classico for example. Chat to your art shop owner if you can for more tips on the many brands available.\n\nBrushes:\n\nKeeping things real once again means having a few good brushes. When it comes to oils I am a big fan of top quality bristle brushes. The type called “long flats” are excellent. Two of these in sizes 6 and 8 will do. Then a rigger for a few fine lines now and to sign your name.\n\nAlso fine hair brushes like the mongoose type are not as expensive as sable. Of course there are excellent synthetic brushes and even combination varieties. For inspiration try Rosemary & Co or brushes by Raphael in France. If you are lucky your local art store may keep them.\n\nCleaning Materials:\n\nA good brush needs proper care. I find that old fashioned kerosene (turpentine) works best to clean oil painting brushes. Take precautions of course. I have a video demonstrating this cleaning method here. Now I do this at the end of the day’s painting only. During painting I simply wipe off the brush with paper towel.\n\nAvoid using cleaning spirits or kerosene while painting as the paint does not benefit from these volatile fluids. Alternatively artist white spirits can also clean your brushes. There are a few eco-friendly products to try as well. Maimeri eco brush cleaner comes to mind.\n\nOn the subject of safety please work in a ventilated space and use rubber gloves. Better safe than sorry.\n\nEasels\n\nAnother potential money trap that I fall into now and then. One good H-frame easel for your studio will do for a start. Later you can add a plein air paint box and maybe a desktop easel for travel. If you paint large scale then a wall mounted shelf may work for you. The cost is nominal. I have promised myself a fancy easel with counter weights and such, but honestly I paint just fine on my humble H-frame. As far as plein air goes my favorite painting box is homemade!\n\nPainting Surfaces:\n\nIf you are starting out then the best size to work on is 6 x8” and 10 x 12” panels. Larger painting panels or canvasses are not ideal for learning and add frustration. Truth is that you will be tempted to paint a large canvas. Go for it. But do not despair if the results are not as intended. Have fun with it. For learning sound painting technique the small panels will be perfect.\n\nYou can get pre-made panels like Gatorboard, or have MDF panels cut to size or even make canvas covered panels. If you need to prime them use gesso or similar acrylic primer. A few coats is all you need. Remember to use a cheap brush for this and not your expensive ones.\n\nPreparation:\n\nAlways have a few sketch books, soft pencils, a charcoal stick or two, felt tip markers (wedge shape tip) in black and gray.\n\nMediums:\n\nSometimes you may need to add a touch of medium to soften your paint. You can purchase many brand name varieties. But make your own with a 50/50 combination of artist’s white spirits and linseed oil.\n\nPalette:\n\nA simple tear-off pad is convenient. Or use the traditional wood variety. Glass sheets are also popular. The main thing is use a large palette for more mixing space. A painting knife is handy for mixing paint and for applying paint too.\n\nYou are almost ready to begin!\n\nLastly though you will need a place to paint. Ideally you have a space where you can leave your paints undisturbed. It is a real pain to have to pack up then unpack everything to continue painting another day. This could turn your passion into a chore after a while. Some people have studios, sheds or a corner in the bedroom. It does not matter so long as you can start painting easily when the desire is there.\n\n​\n\nConclusion\n\nThe above is all the material you need to start painting this weekend. The important thing is to start. Have fun getting your painting kit together. It is exciting, but the best is yet to come. When you have your first painting ready to display I guarantee you will be hooked on this wonderful creative journey.\n\nDo you have any questions on materials? Or any issues about starting your painting adventure? I would love to hear from you.\n\nThis article first appeared in my guest post for Sixty and Me"
