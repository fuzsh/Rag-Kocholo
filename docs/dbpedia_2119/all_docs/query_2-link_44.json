        "text": "Jem Finer, Ashford\n\nPogues founding member-turned-artist Jem Finer's work turns on the big questions: the mysteries of time, nature and finite human life. He's best-known for Longplayer, a composition that will last 1,000 years, transforming a musical performance, usually no more than an eye blink in human history, into something that will almost certainly outlive civilisation as we know it. His latest work features random projections of 18,000 photos taken by a solar-powered camera hidden in a tree for a year. In a single sitting you might witness not just day and night but the full cycle of seasons.\n\nStour Valley Arts Gallery, to 16 Jul\n\nSkye Sherwin\n\nLeo Fitzmaurice, Walsall\n\nLeo Fitzmaurice collects the posters, flyers and packaging that so ubiquitously plague our consumer environment and transforms them into sculptural amazements. Through a meticulous process of folding, piling, repetitively aligning and progressively misaligning his gaudy raw materials, he fills the fourth floor gallery with a veritable landscape of mass-produced detritus. At times Fitzmaurice comes on like latterday high-speed Warhol. At other times his multiple images hint at the fascinating visual flicker of early zoetrope animations. Then again there's the almost maddening claustrophobia of infinity mirrors and the meditative symmetries of Buddhist mandalas. But it's the art's ambiguous focus on global capitalism that makes it a convincing neo-pop spectacle.\n\nNew Art Gallery, to 1 Oct\n\nRobert Clark\n\nJim Isermann, London\n\nWith everything from school doorknobs to lacquered toenails available in limitless designer flavours, right now the designed world seems to be colonised by artists riffing on its social-cum-political implications. Back in the 1980s, when the Californian Jim Isermann began making his hand-crafted installations of colour-coded rooms, furniture upholstered in groovy patterns and paintings collaged with carpet, it was fresh turf. Isermann has given macho modernist and minimalist forms a jaunty twist in his art-meets-decor-meets-craft, yet his work has never been ironic or referred to modern art and design's decline. Hard-edged geometric abstraction has dominated his paintings from the past five years, where fiendishly exacting repetitive patterns recall op art, kitchen tiles or Biba-esque headscarves. The latest works on show here, including six new paintings, continue the lush, intricate psychedelia.\n\nCorvi-Mora, SE11, Fri to 31 Jul\n\nSS\n\nMurray Ballard, Bedford\n\nMurray Ballard's The Prospect Of Immortality is the outcome of five years of photographic investigation into the cryonics industry, the technique of deep-freezing a human corpse in the belief or hope that future scientific advances might enable it to be brought back to life. The complex ethical issues involved here are simply demonstrated by the fact that the 150 corpses currently \"permanently\" stored in liquid nitrogen are referred to in the trade as \"patients\". Ballard takes no moral angle on this attempt to beat the age-old fact of mortality; instead he affords his subject something of the clinical aura of a modern-day alchemical laboratory as towers of icy steam emerge ghostily from grids of metal piping.\n\nImpressions Gallery, to 17 Sep\n\nRC\n\nToulouse Lautrec & Jane Avril: Beyond The Moulin Rouge\n\nThe stories often precede the art in the case of Toulouse-Lautrec and Jane Avril, the starry double act of decadent demi-monde Paris. He was the high-living dwarf painter, capturing the black stockinged legs of can-can dancers, young lovers, old roués, prostitutes, backstage secrets and lesbian clinches in posters and dynamic paintings. She was the red-headed performer dubbed La Mélinite (after an explosive), who high-kicked her way across many of those works. This show offsets the poster image with Toulouse-Lautrec's more intimate portraits of Avril out of costume. In the strong, solid colours of lithograph prints, the showgirl icon appears in outrageous hats or with inky calves provocatively displayed. And then as a pale-faced, thoughtful and psychologically rounded individual in tender paintings.\n\nCourtauld Gallery, WC2, to 18 Sep\n\nSS\n\nBarrie Cooke, Dublin\n\nAn 80th birthday celebration of Barrie Cooke's visceral expressionism, which is appropriately held in his adopted home country of Ireland. Cooke is something of a maverick one-and-only in a contemporary art world which has so often seemed concerned with collective theoretical trends. His painting is resolutely intuitive and lyrical, evoking the rhythmic forces of nature and the pulses of the human heart alike with unashamed passion. It's a hit-and-miss affair, of course, sometimes producing flights of almost transcendental aesthetic delight but occasionally falling off into a gestural boldness that is blunt and near melodramatic, like some kind of declamatory illustration. But maybe by this token Cooke is to be admired for his risk-taking and for bravely trying to revivify a painterly figurative tradition that stretches from Rembrandt through to Bacon.\n\nIrish Museum Of Modern Art, to 18 Sep\n\nRC\n\nMarcel van Eeden, London\n\nFor almost 20 years the Dutch artist Marcel van Eeden has created a drawing a day, using imagery gleaned from adverts and artworks that predate his birth in 1965. What he depicts, however, seems anything but systematic. Time is out of joint in his smudgy, shadowy drawings, where motifs or characters pop up willy-nilly in unexpected eras and places. His first London show centres on three central characters in his fluctuating anti-narrative: a championship boxer who's been married to Liz Taylor, an adventurer-archaeologist and an artist-psychiatrist. The discovery of a stash of weapons, an explosion at sea and a scream rank among the disconnected dramatic events that ensue. It's the uncertain, unstable nature of history, though, that's Van Eeden's real subject.\n\nSprüth Magers, W1, Fri to 13 Aug\n\nSS\n\nHilary Jack, Manchester\n\nHilary Jack scouts the back rooms of charity shops and the eccentricities of eBay auctions to build up her sculptural vocabulary of evocative junk. Her art then consists of almost surreal recombinations of found and bought elements to create scenarios of intriguing disorientation. A cliche landscape painting of a rural idyll showing a pretty little rivulet irrigating a cottage garden is pierced through with the visual shock of a real stream of running water. A dead tree hung from the gallery's I-beam ceiling is partly carved to resemble a balustrade. The compositional aesthetic is one of abutted image fragments. The overall mood is elegiac, melancholy, on the verge of fading away.\n\nCastlefield Gallery, to 24 Jul\n\nRC"
