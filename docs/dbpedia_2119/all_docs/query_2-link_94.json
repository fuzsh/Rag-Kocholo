        "text": "gerlach en koop\n\nIn 1961, Alberto Moravia proposed to Claudia Cardinale to interview her as an object in space. He hesitates, is a little nervous. He wants to describe how she appears in space, and how she disappears again. Cardinale starts answering just as hesitantly, surprised by his proposal, almost shy. Halfway through the interview a break occurs and he asks, ‘What do you do at two?’ I sleep,’ she replies. ‘At three?’ ‘I sleep’ ‘At four?’ ‘I sleep’ ‘At five?’ ‘I sleep’ ‘At six?’ ‘I sleep’ ‘At seven?’ ‘I sleep’ ‘At eight?’ ‘I sleep’ ‘At nine?’ ‘I wake up.’ We were struck by Cardinale’s mirroring of Moravia’s impassiveness. You can’t get any closer.\n\ngerlach en koop\n\nHalfway across the bridge, we would walk down the peninsula together. Under the buildings, we would lower our voices because of the echo in the tunnel. We would ignore the large glass entrance with its aluminium frames and stop in front of a massive steel door without threshold or step, which looks like an emergency exit.\n\nAnd it is the emergency exit. A large grey area in the wall. Twenty centimetres above street level. No door handle. A door bell though.\n\ngerlach en koop\n\nThere are so many exhibitions that we read about or hear about but do not see, or half see, or even less: on the black screens that die if we do not look at them often enough. Exhibitions that are too far away, or we have no time to visit, or were over before we knew it (sometimes long before we knew).\n\ngerlach en koop\n\nActually two. From the beginning, two works have been on our minds constantly without ever intending to include them in the exhibition: Sleep by Andy Warhol and Closed Gallery Piece by Robert Barry—by the way, what would exhibiting the latter work again actually entail?\n\nIn an old catalogue, we found a photo of the closed gallery door with the reflection of the photographer—maybe Seth Siegelaub—intended to document the work.\n\ngerlach en koop\n\nIndeed not the best circumstances for a film of more than 5 hours, or you should have gone back just for that. Sleep is referred to so often and you’ve seen stills of it so many times that you think you know the film without actually having seen it. That’s what it was for or us until a few years ago. We had always assumed that Warhol had simply pointed the camera at the sleeping John Giorno only to return to change the film, like he did with his screen tests. But that is not how it happened at all. Warhol moves the camera around the sleeper and brings the body into the frame at unusual angles so that you can’t always discern what you are looking at. The image is sometimes out of focus, the camera is close to the body, and therefore the composition becomes almost abstract. The sleeping body disintegrates and this is reinforced by the fact that the film was not shot in one night but is a montage of dozens of shots from as many nights.\n\nThe disintegration of falling asleep and the integration of waking up have become defining elements of the exhibition.\n\nLaura van Grinsven\n\nThe documentation lies on my desk in front of me: the invitation, the exhibition booklet and the floor plan, the booklet with the conversation between you and Daniel Gustav Cramer and of course the digital photo file on my computer. There is a double wall that is placed on the location of the fold in the floorplan. It is not drawn onto it, you told me about it. That is not the place where, if I had been able to visit the exhibition, I would have started, I would not have immediately noticed that wall. After entering through the emergency exit I would have simply walked towards it and entered the room either from the left or right of it.\n\ngerlach en koop\n\nThe narrow void between the two walls, a volume of 662 x 326 x 3 cm, cuts the elongated exhibition space across the middle and turns it into two spaces. We decided that one should enter the exhibition there, exactly at that point. And then, on the left, the works that we connect with the experience of falling asleep, and on the right, those we connect with that of waking up. The architecture made this possible, but it meant that the entrance had to be moved to the emergency exit.\n\nFor us, it was important, despite its central role in the exhibition—or perhaps because of it—not to be specific about the volume. Not more specific than a fold in the paper.\n\ngerlach en koop\n\nA surprisingly large number of people had come to the opening in view of all the travel restrictions. Everyone outside of course, in the tunnel. Because the situation was so unusual, we decided to say something—despite our preference for staying in the background. We talked about the Disappearing Bed by the inventor William Murphy, a bed that can be stored invisibly inside the wall, a so-called Murphy bed. Of course, saving space was the intention, but the consequence is that not only the bed disappears from everyday life, but also the bedroom, and with it sleep itself.\n\nThe double wall is a distant echo of the Murphy bed.\n\nBritish scientist Matthew Walker wrote Why We Sleep. Many of the explanations given circle around the idea that sleep is necessary to repair things in the body that are disturbed by being awake. His book explains why sleep is so beneficial and useful and that automatically leads to the real unanswered question of his book: Why did life ever bother to wake up? Why We Wake Up.\n\nLaura van Grinsven\n\nIn 24/7 Jonathan Crary argues that sleep is the last non-commodified human remnant. I immediately think of sleeping pills. Crary is concerned with sleep as a choice, or rather not sleeping as a choice. For example, the US military is investigating a species of sparrow that during their migration can go without sleep for seven days, as a model for soldiers who would hardly need to rest and fight in a war without sleep. Not sleeping is also a vicious and often used torture technique. That wish not to sleep is actually a nightmare. Sleep is culturally unpopular. Sleep is for wimps. Bad for the economy. I also don’t say when I go to bed early.\n\ngerlach en koop\n\nSo that no one in the house will notice that you have gone to sleep? In sleep, the boundary between self and world fades. It is not you who sleeps, but rather something other that slips into and perfectly fits the mold that is you. Night has fallen outside, but it has also fallen within the sleeper, who has become indistinct to him or herself.\n\ngerlach en koop\n\nWe shape the space in between. Most of the artists did not think about sleep in the specific work that we chose from them. In the way we show the works—sometimes completely differently from before—and relate them to each other, something is highlighted in each work that can also sink back into it when the spaces in between change or disappear.\n\nLaura van Grinsven\n\nYou are opening up your authorship, initially for each other. Your practice is the third artist that moves in between your interspace. It doesn’t end there. The location, the collection, other artists, other thinkers, all kinds of objects and often literature also contribute. The third artist gerlach en koop is not a static body, it is a living organism that exists because of other influences. Here too I am reminded of diffraction. You are not afraid to change course, acknowledge the other as co-author of gerlach en koop.\n\nLaura van Grinsven\n\nIn pushing your ego back from the work and opening it up to the situation and to other(s) who can make a statement, your practice is highly political. Although the gestures seem minimal, a small procedure can trigger a movement that unsettles everything. Taking the door out of the entrance of the De Appel Denial (2015) meant that no one actually entered De Appel to see your solo exhibition ‘Choses tuées’ there. The whole institute became a question.\n\nLaura van Grinsven\n\nThe resistance I feel viewing the digital photos stems from the format and the situation in which I have to view them: at my desk on my laptop, in Apple finder format. Long ago, when I saw your work with Ellen de Bruijne for the first time and immediately developed a kind of love for it, that was certainly due to a fragmented perception. The relationship with the space, the alienating objects, the route that was affected by obstructions and of course the texts in my hand. Watching, thinking, reading, imagining, laughing, all at the same time and mixed together. And, and, and … and then, it all doesn’t add up anymore, then things separate from their fixed ideas, everything is suddenly absurd and made free for new connections. I love that moment when I no longer understand it.\n\ngerlach en koop\n\nYes, it seems superfluous to emphasise that the exhibition is made to be experienced in the physical exhibition space—defined expansively, but that seems increasingly less obvious.\n\nAt the same time, we included in the exhibition booklet an existing text by Jean-Luc Moulène in which he says that the idea of an audience does not appeal to him at all, that this comes from marketing, and he is already happy when there are one or two spectators in whom the objects resonate, in body or mind. He has no illusions about comprehension, because that arises outside the work. Or not. He proposes to close his exhibition the moment it is finished. We made a small change to one of his sentences so that his text could speak about our exhibition: ‘We would like for these objects to be considered for what they are and what they say to each other, and not because we chose them.’\n\nLaura van Grinsven\n\nI do remember the work Shoe Shine (2004) by Francis Alÿs you showed there. You disconnected the sound from the image, of course in consultation with the artist. The shoe polish sounds could be heard in the halls; very indeterminate without an image. Normally in sound the thing is very close, you hear the object more than the sound itself. The window closes. Here, that was not the case. The image of the shoe shiner could only be seen on a screen in the control room, inaccessible to the spectators of the exhibition. A curator would never have attempted that.\n\ngerlach en koop\n\nYou are probably right, but for us it is rather artificial to make a distinction between artist and curator. Thinking about how something is displayed, why it is exhibited, in what context and so on, has long been a part of being an artist and not the preserve of curators. And the step from one’s own work to the work of others is not such a big one, especially within a collaboration (because what does ‘own work’ mean in that case anyway?).\n\nLaura van Grinsven\n\nThe simultaneity of the event of the exhibition, normally immediately imposed upon the viewer, unavoidable shatters in fragments within this conversation. The reality of the exhibition is spectral, it haunts this text, within it’s words and sentences that change direction.\n\nEmpty Room by Daniel Gustav Cramer is a room in a house in Japan which is emptied and closed off for the duration of your exhibition. In the booklet carrying the same title, a conversation between him and you is printed. It also contains a postcard with a photo of the road that leads to it. Both the visitors of the exhibition and the readers of the booklet can only imagine that space. How would it smell there? What is the temperature? Is there dust on the floor or is there a dead fly on the window frame? At the moment the exhibition at the GAK closed, the room in Japan is opened again, and is filled again with furniture, inhabitants and life."
