        "text": "Paintings\n\nCaillebotte, Gustave\n\nFrench, 1848-1894\n\nView from a balcony, Paris 1880\n\nOil on canvas, 65.6 × 54.9 cm\n\nStamped lower left in blue: G. Caillebotte\n\ns 508 S/2003\n\nGustave Caillebotte (1848-1894) was a prominent member of the impressionist movement. At the end of the 1870s and early 1880s he exhibited his work in five of the eight shows the impressionists organised between 1874 and 1886. As a wealthy patron Caillebotte also fulfilled an important role by collecting of the work of his friends. Most of his impressive collection is now in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris. He owned fives canvases by Cézanne; eight pastels by Degas; four paintings by Manet, including his monumental Balcony (Musée d'Orsay); and no fewer than 16 Monets and 18 canvases by Pissarro, while he had nine works each by both Renoir and Sisley.\n\nCaillebotte worked in diverse genres, but is particularly famous for his pictures of contemporary urban life - the retrospective exhibition of his work held in 1994-95 (Paris, Chicago, Los Angeles) bore the title Gustave Caillebotte: urban impressionist. In their originality of motif and imaginative composition, Caillebotte's works rival those of Edgar Degas. Indeed, in its finished state Caillebotte's early work most resembles that of this French master - a good example being The floor-scrapers of 1875 (Musée d'Orsay). However, Caillebotte would gradually develop a more painterly brushstroke far more reminiscent of Monet. At the same time, his palette became lighter and View of boulevard Haussmann seen from the balcony is a result of this development. Whereas some of Caillebotte's large intricate compositions tend to be painted in a somewhat flat and static manner. The cityscape discussed here, however, has a spontaneous and fluent brushstroke that perfectly matches the unusual subject matter.\n\nThe scene is painted on a so-called toile de 15, portrait, a canvas of standard format measuring 65 × 54 centimetres that artists could purchase on a stretcher in specialist art shops. The question as to whether this was a study for a larger canvas or an independent painting was once declared to be unsolvable,Ga naar voetnoot1 but technically speaking everything would suggest that Caillebotte conceived the piece as a work complete in itself. Although the brushwork is undeniably fluent and spontaneous, the treatment is far from loose. The shapes of the balcony balustrades were first laid down in a range of blacks and greys of varying thickness. Later this fencing is further worked up in black mixed with dashes of colour - white, bright green, dark red, blue and yellow - adding subtleties of light and shade. Then the canvas was left to dry for a while, after which light, pastel shades (cream, pink, pale blue) were introduced in the background.Ga naar voetnoot2 The carefully thought-out method visible throughout the whole work and the two stages in which the painting was executed indicate that the artist was engaged in making a real picture, rather than a simple impression. Moreover, no more fully worked-out version is known.\n\nThe work is one of a series of Parisian cityscapes painted in 1880 showing the view from Caillebotte's apartment balcony, on the corner of boulevard Haussmann and rue Gluck. Other impressionist artists were also fond of depicting a view of the city seen from a high vantage point; Caillebotte, however, gave the motif a strong personal character. He considered the various possibilities in an almost playful manner; for instance, several of the pictures in this group give an important role to the decorative cast-iron balustrade, and in the painting discussed here it has in fact become the main motif. This type of decoration forms part of many compositions by Caillebotte, albeit chiefly as a secondary motif. Thus we find a similar balustrade\n\nin the background of the above-mentioned Floor-scrapers.\n\nAlthough as far as its subject matter is concerned View from a balcony is representative of the artist's oeuvre, it is at the same time an experiment pushed to the extreme. It clearly reflects the influence of Japanese prints, with their curious compositions and daring croppings of the picture's edge, which deeply influenced impressionist artists. Without any apology, the cast-iron balustrade has become the subject of the composition, creating a picture that takes us by surprise and seems to represent a conscious - and successful - attempt at a truly modern composition. With his direct approach, Caillebotte seeks above all to intrigue rather than simply please. In this way his painting makes a remarkably idiosyncratic impact.\n\nSeveral prominent authors have recognised the importance of this work. In his standard work on Caillebotte, the late Kirk Varnedoe expressed himself in lyrical terms when speaking of the canvas: ‘The picture is not only one of the most original conceptions in Caillebotte's art; it is also a pivot point in the history of painting, standing within one tradition while announcing another. [...] The image embodies not only a striking graphic beauty - a design before whose exuberance the name of Matisse springs irresistibly to mind - but also an extraordinary creative leap of the visual imagination.’Ga naar voetnoot3 The authoritative scholar of impressionism, Richard Brettell, pronounced: ‘This boldly painted and brilliantly composed work is one of the most original cityscapes of Paris by any Impressionist painter.’Ga naar voetnoot4\n\nCaillebotte was a wealthy man and did not have to earn his living from his art. This is presumably why he sold little of his work during his lifetime and rarely exhibited. It is thought that View from a balcony was displayed at the fifth impressionist exhibition in 1880, but there is no absolute certainty about this.Ga naar voetnoot5 The artist died at an early age and his paintings remained largely in the family. Unlike other impressionist artists, Caillebotte more or less sank into oblivion. Not until the second half of the twentieth century would his work gradually appear on the art market and his fame spread. The Caillebotte family sold View from a balcony to Wildenstein in 1968 and it remained with this owner until it was bought by the Van Gogh Museum in 2003.\n\nSjraar van Heugten\n\nProvenance 1880-1968 family of the artist; 1968-2003 Wildenstein, New York; acquired by the Van Gogh Museum (2003)\n\nLiterature Exhib cat.

However, in 1872 he enrolled as a pupil of the portraitist Léon Bonnat (1833-1922) and spent two years studying under him. Beginning in 1876 Béraud exhibited regularly at the Salon. Later his work became widely known through his magazine illustrations. His paintings were also often seen outside France. Indeed, he gained a silver medal at the world's fair held in Amsterdam in 1883.\n\nFrom 1884 on, Béraud participated in the annual exhibitions of the Société d'aquarellistes français, held in Paris. In his debut year he showed for the first time the watercolour that has recently been acquired by the Van Gogh Museum, entitled Les fortifications le soir.\n\nBéraud is known primarily for his colourful scenes depicting the contemporary life of the Parisian beau monde against the backdrop of, for example, boulevards and ballrooms. Vincent van Gogh was decidedly unappreciative of Béraud's qualities. In September 1888 he wrote to Theo that Alphonse Daudet's L'immortel, ‘with all those subtle and precise observations,’ reminded him of ‘the sombre paintings by Jean Béraud, so cold and cheerless’ [677/531].\n\nIn The fortifications in the evening we see a stream of people from various social classes making their weary way to the railway station after a long day's drudgery. Part of the city wall of Paris can be seen on the right; Vincent van Gogh, too, took life on and nearby the fortifications as the subject for a number of watercolours and drawings.\n\nGenerally speaking, the small number of surviving watercolours by Béraud have a fresher and livelier appearance than do his oil paintings. This new acquisition by the Van Gogh Museum adds a fine work to the museum's collection, a representative piece by an artist who in his day was one of the best-loved chroniclers of Parisian life.\n\nJan Gorm Madsen\n\nProvenance M Tedesco collection, 1936, Paris (Hôtel Drouot), 21 March 1938, lot 3, Versailles (Hôtel Rameau), 6 March 1960, lot 41, Hon Roderic Henderson, Newport (Rhode Island), Ivo Bouwman, art dealer, The Hague, private collection, the Netherlands; Amsterdam (Sotheby's), 22 October 2002, lot 89, acquired by the Van Gogh Museum (2002)\n\nLiterature P.

In the years that followed the artist would repeatedly make reference to Verwey and his literary oeuvre in his work. Verwey, by contrast, only mentioned Toorop once, and then only in 1918, at the request of one of his editors.\n\nIn addition to Verwey, Toorop was also inspired by the writings of Emile Verharen, Jules Laforgue, Frederik van Eeden, Walt Whitman and Charles Baudelaire. The literary works he turned to did not necessarily have anything to do with his ideas about art; they were more of a stimulus to his rich imagination.\n\nFor the most part, Cor cordium is drawn in black chalk; Toorop used pencil only to highlight certain details on some of the heads of the figures in the procession. He apparently did not bother too much about the quality of the paper he used: there was already a horizontal crease in the sheet when he began the work. When Toorop had almost completed the drawing he decided the paper was not large enough and he folded it around a piece of cardboard. He continued the drawing on the left-hand side, occupying about two centimetres of the new surface. The drawing still has its original moulded frame.\n\nIn terms of formal, technique and style, this drawing is a beautiful and characteristic example of Toorop's work of around 1890. This was the period in which Toorop abandoned his neo-impressionist style for symbolism, without, however, going to extremes. Other masterpieces of these years include his Garden of sorrows in the Rijksprentenkabinet in Amsterdam, and Les rôdeurs in the Kröller-Müller Museum in Otterlo.\n\nWith the acquisition of Cor cordium, the Van Gogh Museum now owns a drawing by Toorop, in addition to a painting, seven prints and seven letters. The letters in question were written to Johanna van Gogh-Bonger and shed light on Toorop's role in spreading Van Gogh's fame at the turn of the last century. Toorop had seen some of Vincent's paintings in Brussels at exhibitions of Les XX, and in 1892, using paintings and drawings from Johanna's collection, he compiled the first sizeable exhibition of Van Gogh's work to be held in the Netherlands; it was shown in The Hague at the artists' society the Haagsche Kunstkring.\n\nIn 1894-95 Cor cordium formed part of a portfolio produced by this same society. The portfolio, containing prints and drawing for sale, would travel the length and breadth of the Netherlands. Cor cordium, with an asking price of 450 guilders, was the most expensive work and remained unsold until 1899, when it was acquired by no less a figure than the poet Albert Verwey. Before 1899 the drawing appeared for sale at various exhibitions. One such show was that held in Utrecht in 1898-99 at the Vereeniging ‘Voor de Kunst,’ which had on display works by Toorop together with drawings by Van Gogh from Johanna van Gogh-Bonger's collection. The critics were enthusiastic about the combination of these two artists. One spoke in a review of ‘[...] two isolated individuals [...], as one in thought and feeling; so utterly different in their manner of expressing those thoughts and feelings, but both equally powerful, equally lofty and [...] equally beautiful.’ The drawing Cor cordium has been on loan to the museum for several years and now with its acquisition it joins the work of Van Gogh for good.\n\nMarije Vellekoop\n\nProvenance Albert Verwey, Noordwijk aan Zee, 1899-1936, Mrs Dr M Nijland-Verwey, Santpoort, 1936, heirs of Mrs Dr M.
