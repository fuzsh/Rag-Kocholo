        "text": "Inspired by the Richard Brautigan cult classic, Sombrero Fallout: A Japanese Novel, young artist Lilias Buchanan has created a series of exquisitely detailed paintings to be debuted at Shapero Modern from 29th March – 11th April, 2017.\n\nAfter reading Brautigan’s 1976 novel, Lilias became almost obsessed by the narrative, stopping people in the street who resembled its characters and practically buying eBay out of sombrero postcards. The result is this upcoming exhibition of technical, charming and at times chilling artworks.\n\nFamiliar desert landscapes intertwine with striking elements of collage and pencil drawings depicting strange encounters. Not having read the book makes it a bit tricky to figure out what’s going on, but somehow at the same time seems to make the work all the more intriguing.\n\nWe were delighted to be able to speak with Lilias about her practice, this body of work and what’s to come for the London-based artist, whose work is already in the collection of HRH the Prince of Wales.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nWhere can you find Anthony Gormley next to Grayson Perry and, if you are lucky, take one home for £250? The Drawing Biennial 2017, which brings together a multi-generational collection of 200 works on paper from notable artists. The exhibition culminates in an online auction in the exhibition’s two final weeks, available from £250 with proceeds going to support the Drawing Room’s ongoing programme.\n\nThe gallery notes that drawing can offer a rapidity of response to contemporary concerns which can be lost in more costly productions and this is certainly in evidence in this show. But what makes this collection so exciting is that these are finished works of art in their own right and not sketches or creative stepping stones to other work. Some use the practice of mark-making, whether digital prints to graphite on paper, to explore the politics of everyday graphic design, texts and slogans (Amalia Pica) while others exploit the medium to explore wit, abreaction and figuration.\n\nContributors include Jonathan Allen, ruby onyinyechi amanze, Art & Language, Ed Atkins, Marc Bauer, Kasper Bosmans, Koen van den Broek, James Capper, Nidhal Chamekh, Milano Chow, Steven Claydon, Ronald Cornelissen, Angela de la Cruz, Richard Deacon, Nicolas Desayes, Mark Dion, Marcel van Eeden, Ed Fornieles, Richard Forster, Margarita Gluzberg, Antony Gormley, Lubaina Himid, Karl Holmqvist, Donna Huddleston, Rachel Howard, Chantal Joffe, Peter Jones, Michael Landy, Brit Meyer, Julian Opie, Cornelia Parker, Eddie Peake, Simon Periton, Grayson Perry, Amalia Pica, Yelena Popova, Matt Saunders, Massinissa Selmani, John Smith, Emma Talbot, Suzanne Treister, Nicola Tyson, Frances Upritchard, Marcus Vater, Julie Verhoeven, Mark Wallinger, Claudia Wieser and Rose Wylie.\n\n#drawingb2017\n\nFor more details: https://drawingroom.org.uk/drawingbiennial2017\n\nExhibition: 2 March – 26 April\n\nOnline Auction: 12 – 26 April\n\nArtAttack continuously follows current Creative Art Competitions within the Global Art Industry. Our most recent attraction is to The Annual National Creativity Competition in Africa for schools and young people under the age of 25, which is the renowned ‘MASK Prize‘, endorsed by Kenya Ministry Of Education.\n\nThe 2016 Mask Prize is an initiative of the Mobile Art School in Kenya that seeks to promote creativity and innovation among the young generation. This is another chance for young artists from Kenya, Africa and its diaspora to show the world what they’ve got. Currently in its 4th year, the MASK Art Prize has been able to award and mentor a myriad of Kenyan and African artists through its competitions and expose them to the global art world. Next year, The MASK Prize will collaborate with Turner Contemporary, which will be very exciting!\n\nThis year’s theme is “Young People-The Creative Nation”.\n\nArtworks are submitted online in a variety of media and reflect innovative ideas. All entries were in one of the following forms:\n\nPaintings, Drawings, Collages, Sculpture, Installations and Prints.\n\nGraffiti Art.\n\nDigital/Computer Art.\n\nPhotographs and Photojournalism.\n\nSinging, Dancing, Performing Arts and Playing Musical Instruments.\n\nEntrepreneurial/Business Ideas.\n\nPart of why ArtAttack is introducing you to The MASK Prize is due to the 2016 Award Ceremony that takes place this week on the 23rd of June at the Michael Joseph Art Centre in Nairobi and some selected works will be exhibited in the UK at the Saatchi Gallery, University for the Creative Arts and Turner Contemporary.\n\nFor further information and interest in the juding panal, click these links: http://mobileartschoolinkenya.org/mask-prize/index.html http://mobileartschoolinkenya.org/mask-prize/how-to-enter/judges.html\n\nArtAttack are thrilled to show you the incredibly creative works of the 2016 Winners and Commended Artists.\n\n2016 Mask Prize Winners –\n\n1.

Each series reveals the artist’s highly idiosyncratic engagement with the world, which is simultaneously fantastical, surreal and darkly satirical.\n\nWhile political themes clearly come through in his work, Amanita is not a political artist. His drawings are wry, crackling with visual jokes and mercurial connections and associations, as well as flashes of surrealism.\n\nSays exhibition curator Sasha Markvo: ‘Amanita is an artist of exceptional gifts and imagination, and I’m delighted and privileged to present the first survey of his pen and ink drawings in London. While Russian influences are evident in all his work, so to are European and Asiatic which lends it a universal quality. His is a unique talent, one that provokes and delights in equal measure.’\n\nArtAttack had the chance to speak with Amanita on his artistic history and practice.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nChelsea College of Arts student, Caley Holmboe, has a flip phone and no Instagram profile. When I fell in love with a sculpture of hers at last year’s 2nd year show, I had to tweet at the Chelsea student union to get her contact information. When Caley receives an email, it comes to her laptop only. When Caley sends a text, she has to use the numbers as letters just like you did on your old Nokia circa 2004.\n\nHer complete lack of online presence in an increasingly digital world, is something that makes Caley stand out immensely, and I wanted to know how and why she made the practically unheard of choice to be almost totally offline.\n\nIt turns out that the lifestyle choice started an experiment and a work of art. I like to call it ‘The Unplug Project,’ but the formal name of the piece is ‘I Want to Break Up.’\n\nI had the chance to speak with Caley about this fascinating project, which ended up extending into her daily life. You’ll notice this is a much longer interview than those we normally publish, but I encourage you to read every word as it really is a supremely interesting look into a very non-traditional choice.\n\nContinue reading →"
