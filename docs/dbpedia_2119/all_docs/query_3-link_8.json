        "text": "Marcel van Eeden was born in 1965 in The Hague / the Netherlands. He studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in The Hague. Van Eeden´s work resembles impressions from the film noire, based on an almost phototorealistic depiction and the use of black and white contrasts. Almost per day a new drawing emerges, lining up into sequences and series. 2014 he has been appointed professor for painting at Karlsruhe Academy of Fine Arts. Marcel lives and works in Zürich, Den Haag and Karlsruhe."
