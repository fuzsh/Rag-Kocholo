        "text": "Richter left grammar school at the age of 15 and took on a series of temporary jobs including assisting a photographer and painting theatre sets before attending the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts. Here Richter gained a thorough understanding of the masters and began assisting with the creation of propagandistic Social Realist mural art. In 1961, just months before the wall was built, Richter moved to Dusseldorf, where he studied at the art academy alongside Sigmar Polke and viewed abstract art for the first time at the “documenta” II in Kassel as part of an abstract post-war exhibition. Alongside Polke and Konrad Fischer, Richter introduced the term Kapitalistischer Realismus (Capitalistic Realism) as a style of ‘anti’ art which appropriated the pictorial shorthand of advertising whilst also commenting on the consumer-driven art doctrine of western capitalism.\n\nIn the 1960s and 70s, Richter began creating paintings from black and white photographs which he would project onto the canvas and paint. He would first make a realistic replica of the photograph then apply his hallmark “blur” with light touches of the brush accompanied by aggressive smears with his homemade squeegee. In the year following the creation of his one of his first Photo Paintings, Düsenjäger (1962), Richter began viewing himself as a Pop artist seeing huge parallels in artistic exploration to Roy Lichtenstein’s Whaam! (1963). Unlike the brash colourful works of the American Pop artists, which were gaining popularity in Europe at the same time, Richter’s Pop art was much darker and more cynical, painting in a manner which pointed to the absurdity of the notion of representation in the post-war era.\n\nSince the late 1970s, Richter has made many purely abstract paintings which concentrate on the dramatic reality of colour, his signature smearing technique and the resulting textures often reveal contrary existences beneath the final surface of the painting. Richter’s abstract works give an illusion of space which is developed from an incidental process of the reactive gestures of adding, moving and subtracting paint. In 2012, Richter set the record auction price for a painting sold by a living artist, with his Abstraktes Bild (809-4) (1994), which sold for a record $34 million. Today he lives and works in Cologne, Germany and has works held in collections at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Tate in London and in the Art Institute of Chicago amongst others."
