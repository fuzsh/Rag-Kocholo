        "text": "Recollections - of Willumsen\n\n02 Nov - 20 Dec 2012\n\nRECOLLECTIONS - of Willumsen\n\n2. Novemnber - 20. Decmeber 2012\n\nWillumsen, seen close-up from the back row\n\nJens Ferdinand Willumsen (1863-1958) loved frames. ALL types of frames interested\n\nhim - those he himself cut, painted and shaped for his paintings and those\n\nwithin which he had to live and create, as an artist and a human being. His home,\n\nthe pink house that he built in Hellerup in 1907, with no fewer than two studios,\n\nconstituted both the private and artistic framework; but the frame for exhibiting art\n\nalso preoccupied him. This resulted in Den Frie Udstillingsbygning in Oslo Plads,\n\njust as he was committed to other museum projects throughout his life, not least\n\nhis own museum, intended to house his own collection of older art, but never\n\ncompleted by him.\n\nJ. F. Willumsen was a fearless person, throwing himself constantly and eagerly into\n\nhuge new works and projects; nothing was insurmountable or too imposing. He\n\nhad no reservations or anxiety about new work areas or techniques. If Willumsen\n\nneeded a sofa, table or chair, he would design it and have it made. If he needed a\n\npitcher and a bowl and a plate to put on the table, he would test the potential of\n\nceramics to realise his vision. No medium was foreign to him: sculpture, graphics,\n\npainting, bas-relief, photography, etc. were researched with a voracious appetite,\n\noften with strong-willed and monumental results.\n\nIn any case, perhaps the most important aspect of these frames was that they\n\ncould be broken down, transcended and remade - and this applied to both the\n\nconcrete and more abstract frames. The frames around Willumsen's paintings took\n\non a very personal meaning inasmuch as in his most radical works it was difficult\n\nto determine where the frame ended and the painting began. This question comes\n\nparticularly to the fore in his painterly masterpiece Jotunheim, where one must ask\n\nwhether it is indeed a painting one is looking at. Isn't it more of a hybrid of relief,\n\npainting, design and perhaps even sculpture, wherein the frame's ornamentation\n\nholds the work's multifarious pictorial elements in a tight grip?\n\nWillumsen was not unconditionally satisfied with the studio framework he himself\n\nhad created for producing his works. I would go so far as to say that I do not think\n\nthat he was happy being there for long periods of time - in any case, not when\n\nhe was painting. Many of his paintings display a certain sense of \"obligation\". One\n\nfeels that there was something that just had to be done before he could get on\n\nwith something more important. This is not to suggest that he was indulging in\n\nhack work, but one really gets the feeling that Willumsen's artistic vision at times\n\nexceeded his ability to realise it. This is a schism that could be interpreted as anxiety\n\nover becoming seduced by painting. It is as if the painting process itself led\n\nhim no farther than to that place he had imagined beforehand. Willumsen did not\n\nhave the calm or courage to let any uncertainty take control of the painting process.\n\nThe whole picture was in his head, ready to be noted down and painted in.This should be understood as only an artistic flaw, but as in fact Willumsen's great\n\nknack as well.\n\nFor Willumsen painting obviously originated from other art based in his enormous\n\nart-historical knowledge. His lifelong interest for the 400-year older El Greco (1541-\n\n1614), one of history's most radical artists, cannot be denied. Willumsen paints on\n\nthat strong art-historical memory and does not let the concrete motif stand in the\n\nway of his vision, nor does he allow a moment's doubt or hesitation make its mark\n\non the finished picture.\n\nI often think that if one closely studies Willumsen's backgrounds (e.g., the sky in\n\nthe Bjerggaard Gallery's Venice painting), it is painted with a theatre painter's skill\n\n- a technique that will ensure that the details are visible at a long distance. Willumsen\n\nreally paints so that one can see it all the way from the back row of the hall.\n\nHe ignores the official and traditional viewer distance of 1.2 metres; he paints large,\n\nand not for a closed inner circle, but rather as if he imagines that thousands will turn\n\nup in the exhibition halls to see his works. Willumsen's paintings therefore appear\n\nwitty up close and are extreme in their urge to catch and embrace the viewer's\n\nattention. His paintings are theatrical, melodramatic, and can almost seem involuntarily\n\nfailed, when he thus is working at the same time with a quirky and brutally,\n\nexorbitantly colouristic aspect that is difficult to recognize from other places in art\n\nhistory. Even odd works by Zahrtmann, Hill, Ciurlioni, or de Chirico's \"barber paintings\"\n\ncan seem mainstream next to Willumsen's. With these dramatic working\n\nmethods he forces out a visual narrative that despite its rawness and monomaniacal\n\nwill can in no way be considered simple.\n\nIf one were to compare J.F. Willumsen to other artists of the same generation,\n\na very superficial view might suggest French painter Pierre Bonard (1867-1947).\n\nBonnard and Willumsen were born around the same time and lived nearly as long\n\nas one another. Bonnard preferred to stay in southern France for its light and his\n\nwife Marthe's chronically poor health. He lived for many years in Le Cannet, where\n\nWillumsen also stayed at various periods. I do not know whether the two masters\n\never met.\n\nThe two painters both started out in a kind of symbolism. Their earlier works are\n\nnot comparable from a purely visual standpoint, but have some common reference\n\npoints in their contents. The 1890s found them both at the crossroads of a personal\n\nsymbolism and experimentation with decorative painting. In Bonnard's case this is\n\ncharacterised by his thinking of his works in an art deco tradition, where he either\n\npainted the frames right into the pictures or made \"panels\", where the paintings\n\nwere mounted into the wall, thus become an integral part of the architecture. A\n\nnumber of Bonnard's stove and wardrobe screens are also notable for their decorative\n\nstyle, just as his book illustrations and posters from that period are permeated with art deco. Willumsen was also preoccupied with art deco for a short period,\n\nbut with time became more influenced by the English Arts and Crafts tradition from\n\nWilliam Morris and John Ruskin, which he further developed with the Slott-Møller\n\ncouple, painter Johan Rohde and others, marking the start of what we now know\n\nas the Danish Skønvirke tradition.\n\nIn France, however, Bonnard subsequently left the art deco tradition and decorative\n\npainting and for the rest of his life depicted his immediate surroundings in a\n\npost-impressionist style. His family - wife Marthe and their Cocker Spaniel, Black -\n\nbecome the focal point, along with the landscape just outside the many houses he\n\nowned. His immediate surroundings gave him the chance to paint the shifting light\n\nand to be intensely involved with the depiction of both indoor and outdoor spaces.\n\nIn his book on Bonnard, John Elderfield describes this as a \"centrifugal\" space on\n\nthe basis of Bonnard's preoccupation with ellipses.\n\nLike Willumsen, Bonnard used his memory when he painted, so unlike the impressionists,\n\nhe never sat before his subject and worked. Bonnard believed that the\n\nsubject disturbed one's concentration. All his painting took place in a half-dark, uncomfortable\n\nstudio. (This was another of his dogmas: one should not be too comfortable\n\nwhen painting.) Here he painted the light according\n\nto a special shading and notation system that he scribbled down daily in his diary. Bonnard spent years adjusting and correcting the colours in his paintings. Françoise Gilot, Picasso's lover and muse from 1944-1953, said that Picasso could not stand Bonnard's paintings because the latter was constantly remembering something else about the weather on a given day and so correcting his paintings again and again. Picasso called\n\nBonnard's technique a potpourri of indecisiveness. Bonnard, who was a great fan\n\nof Picasso, is said to have replied that it was the \"logic of colour\" to correct, adjust\n\nand reinterpret almost ad infinitum.\n\nBonnard painted his wife 385 times in his lifetime (even several years after her death\n\nhe still painted her floating in the bathtub in that beautiful afternoon light of southern\n\nFrance, and not one of the portraits is lifelike. This is a case of consequences\n\nand monomania that can certainly be measured against Willumsen's, even if Bonnard's\n\nloose brushwork might seem conventional compared to the former's iron\n\ngrip. Willumsen certainly painted his family as well, but always with a pronounced\n\nself-representation; even when he himself does not appear in the picture, one notes\n\nhis presence. Willumsen's preoccupation with the family cannot be compared to\n\nBonnard's \"obsession\", but they share the artistic will and ability to nearly live and\n\ncreate in artistic isolation, \"away from the ordinary world\".\n\nGalleri Bo Bjerggaard has been collecting the works of J.F. Willumsen for a number\n\nof years. The gallery's collection includes both drawings and paintings, and for\n\nthis exhibition they have selected eight of the works and asked nine of the gallery's permanent artists to respond to them. The eight Willumsen works represent various\n\nrecognised subject areas from throughout his oeuvre: three mountain motifs,\n\na small version of Den grønne pige [The Green Girl] preliminary work for the large\n\nSol og Ungdom [Sun and Youth] and a sunny motif from Plaza Fernando in Seville.\n\nBut one picture immediately stands out: Malt under den allergrusomste Krig [Painted\n\nin the Most Gruesome War] from 1940, a motif from St. Mark's Square in Venice.\n\nWillumsen painted in Venice during several periods, but this is the only painting I\n\nknow of from this time. He expressed his desperation over World War II in a little\n\nnote in the painting's left corner and painted St. Mark's Cathedral in an almost\n\nridiculing style as a cross between a failed birthday cake and a closed travelling\n\ncarnival. The domes shining in the sun look like daytime fireworks, an architectural\n\ncaricature brutally expressing not just Willumsen's inner trauma, but the entire catastrophic situation that Europe found itself in at the time of the painting's creation.\n\nHere you can feel Willumsen's special ability to combine very different visual\n\nexpressions into a large, comprehensive and recognizable sense.\n\nThe first, immediate impression one has when seeing the painting without having\n\nfirst read the note, is one of joy - perhaps even fun in the street. But a closer look\n\nreveals a fallen monk or nun à la Walt Disney's Phantom Blot. The figure seems\n\nalmost stuck (and floating) in the middle of the empty St. Mark's Square. It is so\n\nimpossibly painted that one must hope that it is the unbearable situation Willumsen\n\nis in that results in such a contradictory and poor image precisely reflecting the\n\nunbearable situation in 1940.\n\nWillumsen's 1940 shock seems to have gone directly into Dutch Marcel van Eeden's\n\ncollected works. Since 2000, van Eeden has exclusively done black and white drawings\n\nin pencil and charcoal in a kind of film noire aesthetic with the overall\n\nconcept is that his motifs are based only on events that took place before his own birth in 1965.\n\nIn the two works Marcel van Eeden has made for Willumsen's Malt under den\n\nallergrusomte Krig, the over-exalted carnivalising of Willumsen's Venice painting\n\nhas led to an abstract, archetypal modernistic imagery with sharp triangles. One\n\nsenses a kind of broken space; pictures are dynamic and almost aggressive in\n\ntheir colouristic aspect and thus completely different from anything seen before\n\nfrom Marcel Van Eeden's hand. The modernism appears here as a caricature of\n\nOlle Bærtling, Poul Gadegård or Richard Mortensen, for example, and van Eeden\n\nhas indirectly commented on Willumsen's \"caricature architecture\".\n\nSwedish Bo Christian Larsson enters into a dialogue with a mountain landscape,\n\na relatively late and perhaps little known Willumsen work from 1949. Nonetheless,\n\nLarsson sees the work as consisting of hard romantic elements and symbols.It may seem as if the mountain is about to turn into water or waves, dissolving\n\nthe horizon into almost surrealistic scenery. In Larsson's dialogic work The hunter\n\n1949 one can also notice a transformation, but in this case the mountain masses\n\nact like a kind of animal or human body, moved into a theatre where the prompter\n\nboxes have been turned into fire places. In the middle there is an explosion in comic\n\nbook-like style, dissolving into lines and brush strokes. Just as in Willumsen's mediawise\n\n\"simple\" pencil drawing, a violent atmosphere pervades Larsson's scene,\n\nexecuted in a slightly understated black/white technique that causes the explosion\n\nto implode. What might at first seem an innocent, dry, recording landscape sketch\n\nfrom Willumsen's hand in Bo Christian Larsson's vision becomes the entire unfolding\n\nWillumsenesque theatre machinery.\n\nJonathan Meese and John Kørner alike have chosen two of Willumsen's preparatory\n\nworks for Sol og Ungdom. Meese, in the context of this little show, could be\n\nthe one who most calls Willumsen to mind. A devil-may-care and temperament\n\nand an unbridled (to say the least) use of visual media and areas of interest have\n\nbeen his hallmarks right from the start. Nothing seems foreign to Meese, whose\n\nability to turn everything to his own imagery in this context also rings Willumsenesque.\n\nHowever, Meese points toward a quieter, more concentrated side of Willumsen,\n\nnamely when he sees, observes and records a small, thin boy's body very\n\nclose up. In the 1902 watercolour the boy is standing, shielding his eyes from the\n\nstrong Italian sun. He is clearly drawn, but rests slightly on his left leg and right\n\nfoot, since it probably is uncomfortable standing on the many pebbles, Willumsen\n\nhas precisely noted with a thin pencil. In the other preparatory work in oil paint\n\nfrom 1904, there is a boy (the same? looks like him!) lying in an even more relentless\n\nItalian sun. Judging from the white reflections he is slathered with oil. The body\n\nseems isolated from its surroundings and is hovering more than lying. It certainly\n\nunderlines the idealistic body image that Willumsen needed to work with in the\n\nlarge final painting.\n\nMeese has used Willumsen's close studies to come into close contact with the\n\nyoung model. In fact, he has come so close that he has gone right into the boy's\n\nbody and has split it in the middle. Out spill guts in the form of plastic items (maybe\n\nbeach toys?), photographs, hair, etc. The model seems to have been laid down,\n\nthus representing both the standing and lying boy. The face has lost all character\n\ntraits and has grown out to a tip, with a nose made from an inverted waffle cone.\n\nA yo-yo string is attached to the nose, and the yo-yo itself is mounted under the\n\nboy's knee. Plaster is spread over the boy like whipped cream on a cake (there\n\nit is again), and the figure balances between contemptuous ridicule and innocent\n\nplay: a lovely day at the beach with ice cream cones, toys and a torn boy's body.\n\nPer Bak Jensen has also gone close up in his response to Willumsen's Den grønne\n\npige [The Green Girl]. In fact, he has gone even farther than Meese, since Jensen has, so to speak, taken up residence in the girl's head and sees her dreams. It is as\n\nif he has put on Willumsen's painting like a pair of glasses, looking out at the world\n\nthrough Willumsen's perspective. One wonders whether it is a matter of defective\n\nvision that can only perceive the green colours one sees in Jensen's photography\n\n(perhaps a salute to Willumsen's idol, El Greco, who is said to have had serious\n\nvisual impairment). Jensen's picture swings on several different planes. In one sense,\n\nhe swings his coloristic green chord in a less exotic, therefore more authentic,\n\nway than Willumsen and in another the picture literally swings in its hand-held horror\n\nfilm expression. Despite the modern, digital photo tracks that mimic and repeat\n\nWillumsen's Mondrianesque reflections in the water, all of Jensen's motif operates\n\nwith a natural primal force that effortlessly enters into dialogue with Willumsen's\n\nlying green model.\n\nErik Steffensen and Ivan Andersen have honed in on one of Willumsen's many\n\nmountain studies. The mountain motif was the subject Willumsen was most\n\noccupied with throughout his life, and his small oil pastel from 1914 was probably\n\ndrawn in Mürzen. One sees the mist over the farthest mountain on the horizon\n\ncome billowing over the ridge - a motif that certainly appealed to Willumsen's love\n\nof drama. The colours might seem somewhat heavy: more sticky, Danish and greyweatherish than German, landscape violence. Steffensen anti-reflects Willumsen's\n\nmisty, grey weather mountain scenery in a crystal clear, azure version of quite\n\nanother mountain, Kilimanjaro. Where Willumsen's pastel is nearly monochromatic\n\nin its greyness, Steffensen's photography is monochromatic in its azureness. The\n\npictures are nearly identical in composition; Steffensen's wide-screen format creates\n\nthe same feeling of the clouds' slow but sure seizure of the peak. The hard,\n\nunyielding mountain is enveloped by the white vapour, and we can sense that as\n\nviewers we ourselves can be shrouded in the cloud and thus lose the magnificent\n\nview of the mountain. Steffensen, like Willumsen, is working on giant, art historical\n\nmemory and in his reflection of the Willumsen mountain he opens onto several\n\nopenings - aesthetic as well as formal - for revisiting Willumsen with new eyes.\n\nIn addition to the above-named artists, Daniel Richter (DE) and Federico Herrero\n\n(CR) have also created new works that will be in dialogue with Willumsen's eight\n\nworks from Galleri Bo Bjerggaard's collection.\n\nJesper Christiansen, artist\n\nTags: Ivan Andersen, Marcel van Eeden, Federico Herrero, Per Bak Jensen, John Kørner, Bo Christian Larsson, Jonathan Meese, Pablo Picasso, Daniel Richter, Erik Steffensen"
