Marcel van Eedenâ€™s (b. 1965, The Hague; lives and works in Zurich) series of drawings are based on documents and visual materials predating his birth and interweaving historical and fictional narratives into a film noir-esque plot. Three series of drawings on show center on the fictitious archeologist-spy Oswald Sollmann. One was made especially for the exhibition and refers to the establishment of the Museum and the diverse activities of its patrons during 1930-1934.
