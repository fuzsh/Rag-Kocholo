Sell Your Three Stooges Grips, Grunts & Groans Lobby Card

The Three Stooges were active between 1922 and 1970 and their classic slapstick routines are remembered for ubiquitous eye pokes and head bops. Members included Moe Howard, Shemp Howard, Larry Fine, Curly Howard, Joe Besser and Curly Joe DeRita. During their career they made both short and feature films as well as performed live shows. Between 1934 and 1959 they appeared in 190 short films for Columbia Pictures. Grips, Grunts & Groans was one of these short films and was released in January 1937. The title spoofs the expression “gripes, grunts and groans”.
