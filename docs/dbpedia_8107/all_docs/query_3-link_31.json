        "text": "Anatomy & Physiology\n\nWhat Makes a Whale a Whale?\n\nWhales are mammals which means that, like humans and other land mammals, they have three inner ear bones and hair, they breathe air, and the females produce milk through mammary glands and suckle their young. Mammals typically have hair to maintain body heat, but because cetaceans have insulating fat in the form of blubber they are often born with minimal hair that is lost as they grow older. They also share other characteristics with land mammals, but they have evolved numerous traits that allow for their full-time life in the water.\n\nBody Structure\n\nWhales may be large, but their bodies are streamlined to help aid in efficient swimming. Cetacean flukes move vertically through the water (unlike fish that typically move their tails horizontally back and forth). Their flippers (or pectoral fins) are modified forelimbs with an immobile elbow joint and are used mainly for steering, whereas flukes help propel the animals forward. When present, the dorsal fin is helpful for stability and has no support in the way of bones.\n\nWhales are able to survive in deep or freezing polar water because of a layer of fat, called blubber, covering their entire body underneath the skin. Blubber is much thicker than the fat found in other mammals. Blubber is also less dense than the seawater cetaceans swim in, similar to wetsuits used for surfing or diving, which gives the animals buoyancy and helps them float. Blubber thickness has quite the range—varying from two to more than 12 inches thick depending on the species. The thicker blubber doesn’t necessarily mean that an animal is more insulated from the cold though—its main purpose is providing the animal with nutrition stores through winter months when food is scarce.\n\nLarger species also retain heat because their skin surface area is small compared to the size of their bodies. Smaller species make use of higher metabolism and a counter-current heat exchange system of blood vessels in their flukes and flippers to keep warm. This exchange allows for cold blood in the limbs to move from the animal’s extremities in veins directly along arteries carrying warm blood from the animal’s core, instead of losing heat at the surface of the animal’s skin. Their blood vessels are also able to constrict when an animal is in cold water, reducing the amount of energy needed to pump blood throughout the circulatory system and conserving heat.\n\nIn addition to large bodies, cetaceans have large brains—sperm whales currently hold the title for the largest absolute brain size on the planet. The brain to body size ratio is also important, and the only animals with a brain to body size ratio larger than whales are humans. The result is a capacity for complex behaviors and societies, especially in oceanic dolphins, including orcas.\n\nBreathing\n\nBoth baleen and toothed whales breathe through blowholes (the whale’s version of nostrils). These are found on the top of their head and connect to their lungs. Because cetaceans only eat through their mouths, which is not connected to their lungs, they are able to reduce the possibility of drowning from water moving into their lungs while eating a meal. Whales belonging to the group known as Mysticeti (baleen whales) have two blowholes, while toothed whales (Odontoceti) have only one. Unlike humans who breathe automatically, whales have active control of when they breathe. Cetaceans have specific control over a muscle called the nasal plug that closes the passageway of the blowhole—it remains closed when they are diving and is opened when they reach the surface.\n\nAir exchange through the blowhole at the surface is very quick, taking only a fraction of a second to exhale and then inhale to fill their lungs with air. Typically, whales will breathe several times before diving again and then can stay underwater for a period of time—usually 5-15 minutes. Sperm and beaked whales (both of which are kinds of toothed whales) can even last an hour underwater before coming to the surface for another breath.\n\nThe telltale spouts that are formed on the surface occur when whales expel warm air that meets colder air on the surface and condenses into small water droplets. These spouts are unique to the different groups and species in part due to the different shapes that form from either one or two holes, but also because of varying blowhole shapes and animal sizes. The variations allow biologists and recreational whale watchers to identify cetacean species from a distance if they see a spout.\n\nAdapting to Water\n\nLarge lung capacity—the blue whale can hold an equivalent of 1,300 gallons of air—allows cetaceans to swim for long periods of time without coming to the surface for a breath. But, their respiratory and circulatory systems are also much more efficient than mammals on land. Humans can only absorb between 15 and 20 percent of the oxygen inhaled in one breath, but for whales that percentage jumps to over 80 percent, thanks to their blood makeup. When baleen and toothed whales dive, their heart rates slow down and higher amounts of myoglobin molecules in their blood allow for more efficient capture of oxygen. They are able to maintain more myoglobin due to special “non-stick” abilities that mean the surfaces of the blood cells won’t stick together and clog the bloodstream. Their streamlined bodies also help reduce the amount of oxygen needed.\n\nDespite their need to come to the surface regularly to breathe, cetaceans are able to dive to significant depths. Orcas usually only dive for less than a minute to five minutes before surfacing again, but even so they are able to reach depths over 300 feet (or more than 100 meters). Sperm whales are able to dive for over an hour and to depths greater than 6,000 feet (or 1,828 meters). Cuvier’s beaked whale has been recorded diving to 9,816 feet (2,992 meters), equivalent to the height of the Empire State Building; that means that they are covering the distance of 16 football fields and have to deal with increased pressure the deeper they go. Sperm whales, Cuvier’s beaked whales, and bottlenose whales are all deep divers and (along with some other deep-diving seals) have certain adaptations that allow for high levels of pressure on their lungs, nasal cavities and other air-filled spaces. Because the whales aren’t breathing while diving (they are getting oxygen from stores in their blood) their lungs are able to collapse from the increased pressure, reducing the amount of nitrogen that makes its way into the blood stream and the risk of forming dangerous bubbles when returning to the surface (what SCUBA divers call the bends). They can also cut off blood flow to the extremities, keeping the oxygenated blood by the heart and brain. Other air spaces, like ear canals and sinuses, are lined with special tissues that reduce pressure.\n\nSleeping While Swimming\n\nHow do whales and dolphins get any sleep while swimming? They have several mechanisms that prevent water from flowing into their blowholes (see Eating and Breathing section) even while they sleep. But, whales have to consciously go to the surface and breathe, so they aren’t able to entirely shut down their brains for some shuteye. Dolphins will shut down half of their brain for short durations of time while they continue to swim and breathe with the opposite hemisphere functioning and keeping an eye out for danger. (Literally, one of their eyes is open at all times!). They will continue to switch the side that gets rest until they get a full night’s sleep, of around eight hours. Whales will also rest in a semi-conscious state with the orientation of their bodies either vertically or horizontally, typically in groups. Logging behavior is a rest state for whales and dolphins when they are at the surface. They don’t move and resemble a floating log.\n\n(For information on cetacean vision and hearing see the Behavior section.)\n\nSenses\n\nSOUND PRODUCTION AND HEARING\n\nLike other mammals, all whales can produce sound using a larynx, an organ in the throat. In baleen whales, between the blowhole and the lungs there is a special larynx called the U-fold that directly connects to a unique, expandable sac within the whale’s chest. When the whale “talks,” air flows from the lungs, through the U-fold, and then fills the sac. The vibrations made by the U-fold reverberate within the air-filled sac, a system that allows these whales to create a sound loud enough to travel thousands of kilometers. Whales can also sing as they expel air from the sacs back into the lungs, a process that recycles the air and eliminates the need to exhale.\n\nHearing involves the perception of vibrations and underwater sound vibrations cause the entire skull to vibrate, not just the membranes in the ears. This is why sound underwater sounds garbled to humans. Over millions of years, whales have evolved floating middle and inner ear bones that are separate from the skull as a way to hear more clearly. The ear bones that house the middle ear are actually separate from the skull, housed in a suspended chamber of the skull surrounding the ear bones. Hearing is important for both baleen and toothed whales, but the mechanisms they use to take in and interpret sound may be different.\n\nToothed whales receive high-frequency sounds through specialized “acoustic fats” that sit along their lower jawbone and lead to their internal ears. They use echolocation, or biological sonar, to navigate and “see” objects. Toothed whales can expand their sound repertoire into the high frequencies through the use of nasal air sacs and a fatty melon that sits within their forehead. As air moves through the air sacs via the nasal passage it vibrates small fat bodies that create sound; this sound then passes through the melon, which likely acts as a kind of acoustic lens to focus the sound, and its direction. The whale can change the shape of the melon to produce different sounds. This is how they can add complexity to the high-frequency sounds used in echolocation. Toothed whales then hear the echo of this sound through fat bodies lodged inside their lower jaws; fat transmits the high-frequency sound to their ear bones, which the whale’s large brain then processes to give a view of the world, and the objects in it, through sound.\n\nBaleen whales specialize in hearing low-frequency sounds for long-distance communication. They also have fatty tissue that seems important to their hearing, but the specific mechanisms are not well understood. Smithsonian scientists are exploring how these two groups come to have such different ways of hearing.\n\nIn all whales, the ear canal is plugged by a dense wax, which can tell us a lot about the life history of the whale it comes from. Unlike most mammals, whales do not have external ear flaps.\n\nVISION\n\nThe physics of light control how vision works. On land where light is abundant, humans see the world using three specific color receptors. But underwater light is filtered, and in deeper water, many wavelengths are lost so that colors lose their vibrancy, fading altogether at deeper depths. Whales, adapting to this environment, only have one color receptor—they see in greyscale, which allows them to see better in the low light and they have large pupils to allow as much light in as possible. However, the murky waters of the Ganges have proven too dark for the river dolphins that live there. Over time they have lost their vision altogether—with no lens it is thought they still use the eye to perceive light—and instead rely on echolocation to navigate and hunt for prey.\n\nWhales have also adapted the shape of their eye to better see underwater. Terrestrial animals, including humans, rely on the cornea—the clear outer layer of the eye—to focus images using a property called refraction, a bending of light as it crosses through different materials. As light travels through the air and enters the eye, it bends and creates a focused image on the retina with a bit of help from the lens. Underwater, terrestrial animals become far-sighted because the fluid of the eye and the water are so similar; light doesn’t bend enough and the image doesn’t focus effectively. To make up for this, a whale instead relies entirely on its lens to focus an image—which isn’t very effective. Whale lenses are circular to help focus, while ours are slightly flattened.\n\nA whale’s vision is further differentiated from ours in that they have an eye on either side of their head, resulting in two distinct fields of vision, but as to how whales combine the two into a cohesive image, scientists are still unsure. Some species with more narrow face shapes, such as dolphins and beluga whales, can see with binocular vision—where they stitch together a single image, the way humans see.\n\nIn the Food Web\n\nFeeding Mechanisms\n\nCetaceans are large animals that need to maintain enough energy to swim, reproduce, care for young and evade predators. To do this they have to ensure they get enough food. Baleen whales get their name from their feeding strategy. They use large plates of baleen to filter through thousands of gallons of seawater laden with prey for their meals. Hundreds of these plates are lined up in a row and attached to the whale’s upper jaw. The baleen is made of keratin, which is also what makes up human nails and hair. The keratin frays at the edges producing comb-like strands that help to filter out small animals. These large baleen whales (including the largest vertebrate on Earth—blue whales) eat some of the smallest creatures found in the ocean. Their baleen filters out water and captures krill (small planktonic crustaceans), other plankton and small fish. The whales tend to seek out high-density patches of prey to increase feeding efficiency.\n\nMost baleen whales take their large gulps of seawater close to the surface—species such as rorquals lunge-feed in a single gulp, while right whales skim continuously with their mouths agape. Researchers have found that blue whales complete 360 degree turns while lunging with wide open mouths to align their mouths with the swarm of prey and get the most possible krill. A blue whale can eat as much as one ton of krill per day at the peak of feeding time in Antarctica and fit as much as 150 percent of its body weight worth of water in one gulp. Groups of humpback whales will band together when feeding. One whale will dive down and begin to produce bubbles in a circle below the surface of the water. The bubbles will merge together and rise to the surface, causing confusion and producing a de facto net that surrounds schooling fish they have encountered. Then, other whales will rise up through the center forcing the fish towards the surface where they are gulped like fish in a barrel. Bubble net feeding, as it’s called, is only seen in humpback whales during the feeding season. Gray whales, in contrast, feed close to the seafloor where they suck up prey in the muddy sediment that they filter through their baleen.\n\nFor toothed whales, it’s not one-size-fits-all either. There is a huge range of feeding behaviors largely based on a variety of tooth arrangements—teeth in toothed whales are mostly for seizing prey, not for chewing. Toothed whales mainly feed on single prey items, as opposed to baleen whales that filter tiny prey by the hundreds to thousands of individuals. Most dolphins have cone-shaped teeth, while porpoise teeth are flattened. Tooth numbers range from a pair, to dozens to hundreds.\n\nNarwhals have two teeth, but in females they rarely erupt through the gums and in males only one typically does—growing into the long, unicorn-like protrusion for which they are famous. There are exceptions—occasionally females have erupted tusks; some males have two erupted tusks, and some none. Most beaked whales also have one pair of teeth, which tend to be tusk-like, and visible only in males, while the teeth in females stay hidden in their gums.\n\nMost toothed whales feed on one prey item at a time, grabbing it and swallowing it whole. Dolphins and porpoises eat a variety of fish, squid and crustaceans, like crabs and lobsters. Dolphins use their beak and conical teeth, while porpoises have shorter mouths and squarer teeth, both allowing them to grip their prey—no need to chew. One population of dolphins has learned to cover their beaks with conical sponges to dig up fish hiding on the seafloor, a skill that is passed from mothers down to their offspring. Dolphins will also thrash octopuses at the surface as a way to stun them before they attempt to eat them. Beaked whales suck their prey into their mouths in order to swallow them. Larger toothed whales, like orcas, eat fish and cephalopods, but also sharks and larger marine mammals including sea otters, seals, sea lions and smaller whales. Different populations of orcas tend to make their meal choices based on their locations—salmon in waters off the Pacific Northwest, herring in waters off of Europe and minke whales in waters off Antarctica.\n\nNarwhals have never been observed feeding, so what we know about their prey is only from research on their stomach contents. Their diet consists mostly of halibut, cod, squid and shrimp, and they tend to stock up on their food in the winter, making deep dives to find their prey. Sperm whales require a large amount of food—over a ton a day. To meet this need they eat all sorts of animals: octopus, fish, shrimp, and squid. Sometimes meals are made up of larger creatures—colossal and giant squid.\n\nFinding Food\n\nBaleen whales find prey by using a mixture of sound, sight and special reception organs. In 2012 researchers discovered a sensory organ in the bottom jaw of some whale species. Smithsonian scientist Nick Pyenson and his colleagues hypothesize that the organ helps blue, fin and humpback whales to take their giant scoops of water via lunge-feeding.\n\nToothed whales have another tool to find prey that baleen whales lack—echolocation. Odontocetes produce sonar pings that are sent out and echoes are returned when they hit an object, allowing the animal to better know its surrounding environment and what prey is nearby. Echolocation is quite exact and can help detect tiny size differences and even fish burrowed in the seafloor.\n\nPredators\n\nMost cetaceans have no natural predators. Baleen whales and larger toothed whales, like the orcas and sperm whales, almost never face predation from the sea—humans are their greatest threat (see Whaling section). Orcas occasionally will work together in a group to attack large baleen whales, primarily focusing on juveniles or weak, injured adults. There are instances of flesh being bitten off of whales by cookie-cutter sharks, but no recorded deaths from their bites. Sharks, walruses and polar bears sometimes consume smaller toothed whales. Although never observed, there is some evidence that sperm whales and giant squid engage in epic battles. It appears that the whales will eat the squid (their hard beaks are found in the whales’ stomachs) but from the giant sucker scars often found on the face and backs of sperm whales, it’s clear the squids fight back.\n\nParasites\n\nCetaceans include the largest living animals on the planet, but some of the smallest can be found living on and in whales, dolphins, and porpoises. Small crustaceans called whale lice live in folds and rough patches of their skin, as well as in their lesions and nostrils. Most whale louse species have an exclusive corresponding cetacean species that acts as the host for their entire life cycle. Male and female sperm whales even have different unique lice species that they host.\n\nBarnacles mooch off of whales in a commensal relationship—hitching a ride on their backs. The barnacles don’t harm the whale but take advantage of the moving home that brings meals directly to them. Remora fish also take advantage of the ride, attaching to the large mammals with a modified fin. They don’t seem to harm cetaceans—research indicates that they likely help whales remove other external parasites, although any substantial benefit remains unclear. Some seabird and fish species that follow whales take advantage of these leftovers.\n\nA large diversity of internal parasites also infest cetaceans. A variety of parasitic worm species can be found in the blubber, intestines, stomach, liver, and lungs of whales. One roundworm species lives in the placenta of sperm whales and reaches lengths of over eight meters, and pygmy sperm whales host a similarly long roundworm in the tissue under the whale’s skin.\n\nWhaling\n\nThe first record of whaling dates back to 6000 BCE in Neolithic petroglyphs found in South Korea. Similarly, engravings that depict men pursuing a spouting whale show that by 2000 BCE the Norwegians had begun the practice of whaling. Evidence of early whaling also exists for people in Greenland, from the islands off of Japan, and residents of the Aleutian and Phoenician Islands. These early whalers predominantly used whales for food, fuel, and tools. To ensure bountiful harvests, they honored and gave thanks to whales in a variety of ways.\n\nBy the 11th century, harpooning whales was a way to get rich. At this time, Basque whalers of Iberia (Spain) hunted right whales, which later earned their common name because they have the right suite of traits for whaling, such as congregating near shore, being relatively slow-moving, having ample blubber, and floating after being killed. A single right whale could yield 5,247 liters (1,386 gallons) of oil plus 293 kilograms (647 pounds) of baleen. In Norway and Iceland, whalers would corral whales into fjords and then block their exit with nets. Spears were dipped in blood from previous hunts so that the wounds would become infected and eventually kill the whale. Among the most successful hunters were the Basques. They started hunting whales in western Europe in the 11th century using boats and harpoons and continued until whales in the region were depleted. Basque whalers then moved across the Atlantic to Labrador, where from 1520 to 1630 they hunted right and bowhead whales along their migration routes. By the 1600s those whale populations, too, had plummeted. So, the Basque fishermen turned to cod and seals.\n\nIn the United States, whaling did not reach its height until the mid-19th century. Known as Yankee whaling, the American industry dominated with 735 of the world’s total 900 whaling vessels in 1846. The U.S. alone killed more than 100,000 whales total during peak years, with sperm whales—especially those in the South Pacific Ocean—the primary target. Sperm whale oil was highly desired for its exceptional lubricating quality and ability to burn brightly and without odor. Sperm whales also contained a special liquid in their head called spermaceti or “head oil” and a wax-like substance in their intestines called ambergris that was used in medicine and perfume. Baleen whales, including gray, bowhead, humpback, and right, were also targeted despite having inferior quality oil. Their baleen was used in buggy whips, carriage springs, corset stays, fishing poles, umbrellas, and hoop skirts. Life at sea was long and arduous for whalers, and many filled the hours of idleness by taking up carving and engraving. Scrimshaw is a traditional, nineteenth-century pastime that included the engraving of whale teeth, bones, and baleen (also called whalebone), with decorative artwork.\n\nIn the 1860s a Norwegian entrepreneur revolutionized the whaling process and ushered in a new, modern era of whaling. Sven Foyn’s boats were steam-powered and equipped with deck cannons that shot harpoons that exploded on impact. The Norwegian whalers initially hunted close to home, but by 1904 they began to expand throughout the world, establishing whaling stations as they went. In the 1920s, they also introduced pelagic-factory ship whaling where the entire whale was hauled on deck to be processed at sea. Other advances included processing machinery, radio, the use of fleets with many specialized vessels, and aircraft spotting. Whaling became so efficient that by World War II many species were on the brink of extinction. Between 1900 and 1999 an estimated three million whales were killed by the whaling industry.\n\nToday, most nations observe the whaling ban put in place by the International Whaling Commission (see Conservation section). Only a few nations, including Iceland, Japan, and Norway, object to the ban and continue to whale. The IWC also allows certain aboriginal groups from Canada, the U.S., Greenland, Russia, South-Eastern Asia, and the Caribbean to whale since it has been deemed an integral part of their nutritional and cultural life.\n\nThe documentary The Cove was instrumental in spreading awareness about a particular slaughter event that occurs in Taiji, Japan. Every March thousands of dolphins are secretly corralled in a particular cove. A few are selected and sold to dolphinariums and the rest are slaughtered and their meat sold in local supermarkets. Although it did spark an international outcry for a few years, the fishers of Taiji still capture and slaughter dolphins every year and the city is planning to turn one of the larger bays into a dolphin park and research facility.\n\nExhibits: Past & Present\n\nThe 1903 Blue Whale\n\nIn May 1903, little was known about whale biology, but the National Museum’s curator of mammals, Frederick W. True, dispatched exhibit staff to obtain the world’s first full cast of a whale, which the Smithsonian would display at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 1904. The race to display a full cast of a whale had more than just to do with population declines, as the head of exhibits at the National Museum was also hoping to set the record straight that the National Museum had successfully cast the “outward form” of a whale. The process wasn’t easy—it involved casting the dead animal while it was floating in water—but a full cast of a blue whale went on display at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition and was then displayed from the roof trusses of the South Hall in the Art and Industries Building. After the new U.S. National Museum (today the National Museum of Natural History) opened in 1910, it was moved across the Mall, mounted on a pedestal, and placed at the center on the Hall of Marine Life. For fifty years the seventy-eight-foot cast of the blue whale enchanted visitors to the Museum.\n\nThe 1963 Blue Whale\n\nThe 1903 blue whale model met its end around 1960, when it was replaced by a new, even bigger blue whale model. In the 1950s the Smithsonian began an institution-wide exhibits modernization program, and many halls of the Natural History building were completely renovated at this time. The new hall dedicated to Life in the Seas was to have as its centerpiece a state-of-the art model of a blue whale in mid-motion.\n\nModeling techniques had advanced considerably in the decades since 1903, and lightweight plastics and fiberglass allowed for a more dynamic posture. Museum director Remington Kellogg wanted a “scientifically accurate” model, but this proved challenging, as whale science—particularly the biology and behavior of blue whales—was hindered by the difficulty of tracking and observing whales in their natural habitat. Most whales could only be studied after they had washed up on a beach or at whaling stations after they had been killed and hauled to shore. Scientists could not agree as to whether or not the ventral plates of the mouth expanded when diving or rising, and this issue presented a significant problem in designing the blue whale model.\n\nLuckily, scientists were just beginning to capture some of the first underwater footage of whales and the Smithsonian used footage from Jacques-Yves Cousteau’s 1956 French documentary film “Le monde du silence,” or “The Silent World,”to inform their design of the new model.\n\nThe 94-foot-long model was suspended thirty feet above the floor and attached to two steel brackets jutting out from the wall. The exhibit opened in February 1963 in time for the First International Symposium on Cetacean Research. Suspended in air, visitors could imagine that “she has just risen from dark waters, expelled her breath, drawn in another, and is now about to lift her powerful tail in an upward swipe that will send her plunging to the icy depths.”\n\nIn 1976, a new exhibit label was added, explaining that there was an error with the model. New scientific data about whale behavior led Smithsonian biologists to reevaluate the accuracy of the blue whale model’s diving posture. Photographs of living blue whales still did not exist at this time, but there were a few photographs of other rorquals or baleen whales, including sei and minke whales, that revealed much slimmer, streamlined bodies than expected. “Only after a whale takes a mouthful of food and is about to swallow it, would its throat be expanded in this way,” the label explained. The 1963 blue whale model was eventually removed in 2000 as renovations began for the new Kenneth E. Behring Family Hall of Mammals.\n\nThe 2003 Right Whale – Phoenix\n\nCurrently suspended at the center of the Sant Ocean Hall is a life-size model of a North Atlantic right whale named Phoenix. The result of four years of work, and collaboration between exhibit fabricators, whale biologists, sculptors, painters, engineers, and many others, this exhibit is unique and exciting in that it represents a live animal. Phoenix has been tracked in her Atlantic Ocean environment by marine biologists at the New England Aquarium in Boston, ever since her birth off the coast of Georgia in 1987. Phoenix was chosen because so much is known about her and her family (her mother’s name is Stumpy). She is the mother of three calves and became a grandmother in 2007.\n\nShe got her name Phoenix from her ability to rise again, like the mythical bird, after a life-threatening entanglement with fishing gear in 1997. She still bears a scar below her right lip from that encounter, which you can see on the model and which scientists use to help identify her in the waters of the Atlantic.\n\nNarwhal: Revealing an Arctic Legend\n\nThe Narwhal: Revealing an Arctic Legend exhibit opened at the National Museum of Natural History in 2016 and closed in 2019. The exhibit highlighted how traditional Inuit knowledge and scientific research can be combined to reveal new insights about these difficult-to-study whales—and the rapidly changing environment they live in. The exhibit displayed a life size model of a male narwhal, skulls and tusks (including a rare double-tusked skull), and intricate Inuit artwork."
