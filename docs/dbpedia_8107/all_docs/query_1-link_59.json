        "text": "Eddie didn’t know how loud his life was until Chris was gone and everything went quiet.\n\nWithout his son, there is just so much negative space around him, empty and throbbing and silent .\n\nNo soft shuffle of Chris’ socked feet. No rhythmic tap of his crutches. No grumbling commentary when he’s playing video games or doing homework. No bright cackles of laughter. None of the humming Chris usually does as he goes through his morning routine. Humming that Eddie would join in on without thinking, the two of them creating a very off-key, barely harmonious rendition of some pop song Chris can’t get enough of.\n\nEddie doesn’t hum in the mornings now. Doesn’t really see the point. Can’t quite manage to make the sound. Vocal chords stripped and bruise sore, either from lack of use or from desperate pleas that echo throughout his goddamn empty house.\n\nThe thing is, Eddie has never really experienced this kind of quiet before, this kind of hollow stillness that permeates over hardwood floors and seeps into carefully crafted drywall.\n\nHis childhood was loud and full of motion.\n\nMusic rumbling through the house. Usually Celia Cruz and Carlos Santana, their lilting croons brightening up every corner, accompanied by his father’s rough, creaking baritone and his mother’s laughs as she tried to get the words right.\n\nAdriana and Sofia. His sisters arguing and yelling and singing and laughing, every single word they uttered treated like a declaration, like an announcement that couldn’t go missed by anyone.\n\nAbuela. Her cooking its own kind of music, made even more rich by the bright scents she always seemed to carry with her. The soles of her shoes scuffing against the floors because she liked to glide around the kitchen instead of simply walk. Her nails tapping rapidly against the counter when she was thinking about tweaking something.\n\nEddie’s feet thumping against the stairs, extra careful on the second to last step that creaked because of a crack he and his sisters most definitely did not put there. His socks sliding against the slick floor after his mom mopped. The dull thud of his favorite baseball-sized bouncy ball hitting the wooden gate in the backyard. The soft thwack when he caught the ball with his dad’s old mitt.\n\nNoise was everywhere, but Eddie never really minded it. Sure, his sisters got on his nerves and the house tended to groan beneath the weight of the personalities it held and there were times he wanted to shut everything out because he couldn’t make sense of what he was hearing, but–\n\nAll that sound was good. Filling. Grounding. Distracting.\n\nEven after he grew out of his childhood home–marching into adulthood with hardly any vision or direction beyond a blind need to do good, to be good, to be a man and provide for the family he hadn’t intended to have but was there all the same, Shannon and their baby in her belly, both so sweet and loved and reliant on Eddie–there was barely any silence.\n\nShannon was loud in a lot of ways, even though she was quiet in others. She was always quick to laugh and even quicker to make a joke. She liked to listen to music while she cleaned and she talked to herself a lot, mumbling under her breath almost nonstop.\n\nAnd then Chris came.\n\nHis son. His baby. So precious and soft and full of noise.\n\nChris’ cries, the very first sound Eddie heard from him. Their resonance reverberated behind Eddie’s sternum, beating a furious tempo as Eddie carefully took him from the doctors and held him close, knowing in that moment that he was cradling his future, his forever, in his palms.\n\nSoon those cries became muffled and distorted, heard through shitty speakers while Eddie burned and healed and fought and killed in another country. But Chris’ laugh always managed to break through, no matter how frustrated or sad or hurt he was. Just like his mother, so very quick to laugh, as if it was easy, as if he owed it to the world.\n\nAfghanistan itself was just an ache of noise. Eddie managed to carve out quiet moments here and there, slipping out of his bunk at night, his unlaced boots toe deep in dirt and sand as he looked up at stars that seemed to pulse in the sky. But those moments didn’t quite stick with him the way everything else did: bombs and yells and helicopter blades and wounded cries and the spurt of blood.\n\nThen of course there were the constant fights with Shannon once he returned home for good. And the fights with his parents. The terrible quiet in between that meant he had done wrong, that he was too much to deal with, that no one except for his son could stand to talk to him.\n\nThen the bustle of L.A. Fast mornings and traffic jams and street vendors and people everywhere.\n\nAnd all of that, every bit of it, always accompanied by the loud, exuberant life of his son.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nChris isn’t here. He isn’t here and honestly it feels like Eddie isn’t either.\n\nHe’s trying. Really, he is.\n\nHe wakes up every morning, forces himself to not look at his phone for messages that won’t be there, and gets up.\n\nEddie gets out of bed, sometimes groaning and aching and far more exhausted than he was when he went to sleep, but he does it. He waltzes through a routine that feels misshapen without Chris, side-stepping around where Chris would usually be, acclimating to the glaring absence opposite him as if he’s a dancer forced to continue the show and is pretending it was always meant to be a solo and not a duet.\n\nEddie eats and showers and puts on clothes. He goes to work, does his job, acts as fine as he can around his friends, attends therapy twice a week, and goes back home.\n\nDay after day after day.\n\nAnd it’s so fucking quiet.\n\nHe tries to compensate for it.\n\nHe keeps the TV on almost constantly, the volume high enough that he can hear it anywhere in the house. He plays music, Celia Cruz and Carlos Santana and the enormous playlist Buck made for him that bounces from genre to genre so quickly Eddie can barely keep up. He calls his sisters more often, talks himself hoarse and listens to them do the same, mundane conversations that bring them all closer together, as close as they used to be before Eddie ran away from everything.\n\nHe starts taking excursions throughout the city, leaving the house more often than not, more often than he ever has before, haunting a dozen different spots in L.A. instead of the one place where he’s not supposed to feel like a ghost, not anymore, but does anyway.\n\nAnd, of course, Buck comes over.\n\nWhen Buck is there, the silence abates enough that Eddie can breathe. Buck, the noisiest person Eddie has ever known. Buck, who is louder than life. Buck, who shines and sparkles and fills up the quiet with an ease Eddie is kinda envious of. Even when Buck isn’t saying or doing anything, he fills up most of the emptiness, making the house warmer and more alive than it is when Eddie is the sole occupant.\n\nEddie grasps at every bit of comfort he can reach, gathering the sounds of life to himself with a possessive greed as if he is trying to prove to himself that he’s still real and whole and okay even though part of himself has been carved out and taken across the country.\n\nBut still, even with all of that, it’s not enough.\n\nIt’s as if the lack of sound has become physical, growing so much that it’s obtained a corporeal form, attached to his shoulders with a weight that’s familiar, a weight he thought he shed not too long ago.\n\nHe hates it.\n\nThe itch of static as it builds up beneath his skin, born from everything that’s not there. The weak pulse of his heart, broken beyond what he fears anyone can fix or accept. The pressure in his chest, a force that writhes and pushes against his bones hard enough to make them creak, tiny little pieces of panic that yank on his gut and cut through his lungs.\n\nAll of it wears him down so thin. It always has.\n\nEver since he was a kid the quiet has only ever meant that things are bad, that something is wrong, that there’s been a misstep or a failure or a loss, and usually it’s always been because of him.\n\nWhen there is enough sound to drown out any of his thoughts, it’s a comfort, a relief, a way for him to focus. Even if it’s the warning sound of sirens or screams of pain or raised voices, the noise is good because he knows what’s going on, it allows him to identify what he needs to focus on and more than anything Eddie needs that focus.\n\nHe needs not to get lost in his own head. He needs the distraction of outside forces. He needs control and the ability to prioritize. He needs to not let himself be the center of anything and to be able to dedicate himself to whatever needs his attention before moving on to the next thing.\n\nOtherwise–\n\nWell, otherwise, Eddie ends up sneaking around with a woman who looks like his dead wife, leading her on and chasing after something he’s not sure even existed in the first place, and then breaking his son’s heart in the process, losing the one love that’s never been complicated or burdensome or anything other than easy and right and good.\n\nAnd even when he does everything he can to focus on the distractions he provides himself, there still isn’t anywhere to hide, not at home when what should be there but isn’t is far louder than any movie or song or friendly conversation over beers.\n\nAt work, it’s a little easier.\n\nWhen Eddie is at the station, everything is a little more fine, more straightforward and easy and comforting.\n\nThere’s Chim’s jokes and contagious laughter. There’s Hen’s quips and stories. There’s the dull thump of Bobby’s boots as he checks on everyone and everything. There’s Ravi’s sighs and his actually quite good singing.\n\nAnd there is Buck, even more full and loud at the station than he is at Eddie’s house.\n\nBuck’s running commentary on literally anything that is happening. Buck’s long-winded rants about whatever new thing has caught his attention this week. Buck’s soft, deep, puffing grunts as he works out. Buck’s laugh, a vivid and full tenor that reaches up to the ceiling like it wants to burst out of the building and touch the sky. Buck’s soft-spoken words just for Eddie, an inside joke or a gentle encouragement or an offer to do something together or something mundane that beats away the infected would of silence throbbing in Eddie’s chest.\n\nSelfishly, Eddie kind of wishes he could keep Buck’s noise to himself forever. Maybe find a way to store it, bottle it up in something to hang around his neck so he can clasp it in his hand, feel its incandescence, bring it to his ear and listen to it whenever he needs to. Or bury it in the walls of his home, shove the unignorable fullness of Buck beneath paint and plaster, keep it all tucked away safely where it can still wrap around Eddie.\n\nRidiculous notions, all of them. Stupid and pathetic and selfish. Enough so that when the urge to capture every sound Buck makes rises up in Eddie with the force of a tidal wave he has to step back, exit the never ending pull of Buck’s gravity so he doesn’t get lost, force himself to be normal about the fact that he hates going home now and he spends as much time missing Buck as he does missing his son.\n\nWhich, again, another stupid thing because Buck is right there. Always there. Just where Eddie needs him.\n\nThey’ve always been attached at the hip, but it’s worsened since Eddie had to watch his son walk out the door, ensconced in the hands of his parents, an image he thought he would only ever see in his nightmares.\n\nBuck has probably deemed it his mission to look after Eddie, to take care of him and make sure he is alright, to ensure for himself that Eddie doesn’t end up drowning again. Eddie’s own personal guard, intent on keeping him safe from everything, including himself.\n\nIt should chafe, and it probably would if it were anyone else, but he doesn’t mind it from Buck. Because Buck has never made him feel incapable. No, he’s only made Eddie feel worthy of care, of help, of patience.\n\nStill, they can’t be together all the time. There are more things in life for Buck than just Eddie, and Eddie can’t rely on him to fill up every empty space forever. It’s not fair and Eddie is so fucking tired of doing things that aren’t fair to the people he loves.\n\nSo, he endures the quiet. He endures the loneliness. He endures every ache of his that feels ancient and permanent.\n\nIt gets bearable. Thanks to his friends. Thanks to therapy. Thanks to the fact that in letting his son go he has proven to himself that he can do what’s best for his son even at the expense of himself, no matter how many times he has failed before or how much it hurts.\n\nAnd eventually, thanks to the timid, scattered texts Chris begins to send to him.\n\nBut it still hurts.\n\nSo much so that after months of Chris-shaped quiet, Eddie begins to wonder if this is a wound that will scar. One he will have to live with forever. One people will point at and ask about. One he will have to find some way to explain without giving away his incompetence, his selfishness, his ruination. One that will be ugly and gnarled enough that he grows to hate himself for its existence, for the proof of what he was forced to go through by his own fault.\n\nHe lost the sounds of his childhood home, still present in faded memories and echoing anytime he goes back to Texas, but not as deep and bright as they once used to be, all tarnished and quieted by life outside of those walls.\n\nHe lost the sounds of Shannon. Laughter and moans and long conversations into the night. Frustrated scoffs and thinly veiled screams and silent tears louder than anything else. His pain and her pain coalesced into an awful mixture that threatened to poison them both, calcifying what they once had together until their love was turned into brittle stone that maybe could have been softened and polished if only they were given the time.\n\nAnd now, Chris.\n\nEddie has lost the sounds of his son–his son who gave him peace and happiness and love and a purpose–and he’s so terrified that like everything else in his life, he will never get them back.\n\nEddie loves his job.\n\nHe loves the physicality of it, the slight strain to his muscles after a long day that means he’s put himself to work, that he’s done something good and worthwhile.\n\nHe loves the camaraderie. An easy, comforting camaraderie so great that he never imagined finding something like it. It was certainly a desire of his, a want that simmered low and bright within him, one he didn’t think he could fully quench but at the very least could cool enough that it didn’t end up burning him, so very sick of being alone.\n\nAnd then all at once there was Bobby and Hen and Chim and Buck. People who quickly became almost everything to him. True friends that fed the want Eddie pretended he didn’t have.\n\nThere’s nothing better than working alongside all of them, maintaining their fun and silliness while helping people, being able to rely on each other, having one another’s backs and feeling safer for it.\n\nAnd, of course, he gets to make a difference. Eddie is there during some of the worst moments of people’s lives, whether it’s life endangering or soul-crushingly embarrassing, and he loves that. He loves the interaction, loves connecting with people and getting them out of a spot they thought they would be stuck in.\n\nBut, sometimes most of all, he loves the lull between calls.\n\nThe chance to rest and not feel guilty about it. The time to sit with his friends and talk or play games or share a silence that isn’t strangling. The inherent comfort of the station, all cool tones and steel lines and filled to the brim with sound and motion.\n\nEddie has been able to find the most soothing, stolen moments of peace within these walls, and if he wouldn’t get caught and reprimanded for it, he would honestly never leave. Bunk down here amongst the trucks and supplies and glass walls, avoid going home to the quiet, listen all day and night to the life that flutters through the building.\n\nConstant murmuring of conversation that sometimes escalates to voices raised not in anger but in excitement or indignation or playful teasing.\n\nBoots squeaking against the floors that Bobby and Buck always make sure are slick and shiny enough that it’s almost like they are walking on mirrors.\n\nRustling that echoes through the space as someone stocks the ambulance. Feet thudding against the stairs. The TV kept on for even more background noise. Dishes clinking during meals. The steady thrum of the dishwasher.\n\nEddie breathes it all in from where he sits in the kitchen, inhaling every sound as he sips at his coffee, which he shouldn’t be having so late in the day, but he’s already worn out from the extensive pileup on the highway they were called out to this morning and there’s still six hours to go, so coffee it is.\n\nWho cares if he’ll be a bit strung out by the time his shift ends? It’s not like he wouldn’t be miserable and staring up at the ceiling of his bedroom even if he wasn’t caffeinated. Not when there’s no nighttime ritual of Chris sneaking out of his room for water or a snack or the tell-tale signs of him playing video games way past his bedtime.\n\nWhen there’s nothing like that for Eddie to listen to, sleep is elusive, so fuck it, he will guzzle this specialty brand of coffee Bobby buys like its going out of season and not give a damn.\n\nHe tries to ignore how easy it is to do something that’s not good for him, especially when the dark scent of the coffee reminds him of the cafe near the store where Kim worked, the rich notes of it wrapping around him as he paced back and forth outside and felt like he was losing his mind but not sure if he should do anything about it or not.\n\nNope. Not thinking about that.\n\nA voice that sounds suspiciously like Frank’s chews him out for that, but Eddie ignores it too. His next session is in a couple of days anyways. So can ignore some shit for his own sanity until then and make Frank deal with it. That is what Eddie pays him for after all.\n\n“That better be tea,” Buck’s gruff voice says, the edges of it worn but warm as he comes up behind Eddie, reaching an arm around him to flick the edge of Eddie’s coffee cup.\n\nEddie huffs and jams his elbow back and into Buck’s cushioned ribs. “It’s actually a great big mug of none of your business .”\n\nBuck steps around where Eddie is sitting on his stool and leans against the edge of the counter, body long and loose and open, looking so very much like an invitation he is begging for someone to answer, blue eyes a little dark in the evening light as he smiles that soft and easy smile of his that has never failed to send a flutter of something through Eddie, something he’s never been able to identify or at the very least not been able to let himself name.\n\nEddie raises an eyebrow at Buck, hardly phased by the murmurings of his heart because he’s gotten very used to ignoring them even if they have grown louder and more insistent these past few months.\n\nBuck snaps his fingers and points at Eddie’s cup. “Man, I thought we were all out of that. Bobby didn’t tell me he’d stocked back up on the none of your business flavor.”\n\nIt’s not funny. Really, it’s not.\n\nEddie laughs anyway.\n\nHe tells himself he laughs solely because it’ll make Buck happy and making Buck happy is one of his favorite things and also one of the things it seems he can do without failing spectacularly. And Buck does look so very pleased with himself, grinning from ear to ear, his cheeks pinched and the crystal color of his eyes shining, as if he has told the joke of the century and is so damn proud of his winning humor.\n\nThough maybe–well, maybe that look is just for getting Eddie to laugh.\n\nIt feels a bit blasphemous and conceited to think, but–\n\nEddie isn’t exactly a prime example of sane or normal, so he lets himself think it.\n\nBecause the thing is, Buck has been a certain sort of way with him lately. It’s hard to define, the behavior blatant and bold and obvious but defying explanation, at least any that Eddie can come up with. Buck just looks at him like he is searching for something or maybe it’s more accurate to say it’s like he wants something. From Eddie. And he’s just waiting until Eddie gives it to him.\n\nBuck’s expression will morph during times like these, when it’s the two of them tucked away from everything and everyone. A sort of softness settles in his features, making him look bright and young and charming, almost boyish in its blurry intensity as his body gravitates closer to Eddie’s and his skin flushes a color so prettily similar to the splotch of his birthmark.\n\nWhen this particular look of Buck’s first appeared a few months ago, it seemed as if Buck was looking at him the way he does when he’s trying to figure something out, studying every bare inch until he knows as much as possible, but then, at least in Eddie’s own mind, it evolved into Buck looking at him so deep and intense the way he does when he’s reading an article and discovered something that delights him.\n\nIt’s happened often enough that Eddie can pinpoint when it’s about to happen. He has catalogued the oncoming signs and noticed the frantic beat of his heart as he watches for it to crest over Buck’s face, startling and beautiful every time no matter how often Eddie sees it.\n\nAnd he sees it pretty often, but most often when he is laughing.\n\nMaybe it’s just the feedback loop that has always seemed to be alive within them, curling around each other, this pathway of energy that they share, one of them joyful or amused simply because the other is. But something in Eddie says it’s more.\n\nIt’s as terrifying as it is lovely.\n\nBut not terrifying enough that Eddie doesn’t bask in it. Selfishly, he lingers in these moments as long as he can, when he’s the very center of Buck’s attention, when Buck looks at him like he is everything, like Eddie can give Buck the sort of happiness that Eddie has been chasing after his entire life.\n\nHe would try. Eddie would laugh at anything to keep Buck looking like this. Eddie would do everything he could to figure out what it is Buck seems to want and give it to him, every last shred until he is empty and Buck is full.\n\nThough he’s not sure that what he has to give is worth giving. And certainly not to someone like Buck. Especially when Eddie can barely admit to himself what it is that he wants.\n\nEddie drops his gaze, casting his eyes down to where he is fiddling with his coffee cup, forefinger circling the rim. The coffee is dark enough that he catches a glimpse of his reflection, shiny and distorted but clear enough for him to see how calm and horrifyingly besotted he is, an expression he hasn’t seen on himself since he was a teenager.\n\nA breath gets caught in his throat and he looks away from that too, eyes immediately flicking back up to Buck because where else would he look.\n\nBuck’s smile has softened, the edges less striking but still bright and pink. It’s a more private smile, tucked away like maybe Buck is trying to hide something but having a hard time doing so. And that expression Eddie has spent hours analyzing and memorizing so much that he could probably sketch it if he were any kind of artist is still there.\n\nExpectancy lies in the gentle lines of Buck’s face and it makes Eddie’s mouth go dry.\n\nHis throat closes around the rough, captive breath still struggling to break out of him and his heart taps a rhythm against his ribcage that he swears is loud enough for Buck to hear.\n\nToo much. It’s too much.\n\nToo much of everything that he can’t let himself look at, no matter how pretty and large and eager Buck is and always has been.\n\nA part of Eddie knows what it all means. There are really only a few options for him to choose from, a very specific set of answers as to why Eddie’s head is crystal clear and quiet in a good way around Buck but his heart is louder than ever.\n\nI can’t , he thinks. Not yet .\n\nEddie focuses on the stretch of Buck’s uniform over his broad shoulders and the restless tapping of his fingers as he patiently waits on Eddie to catch up and he breathes and breathes and breathes.\n\nHe takes another sip of his coffee, more to give himself something to do, a task that centers him in the moment and gives him time to get in the right headspace to take part in the fun, playful banter he and Buck have always been so good at.\n\nBuck’s eyes narrow as he watches Eddie, zeroing in on the sip like he’s trying to magically turn the coffee into tea from the combination of sheer will and disappointment.\n\nEddie rolls his eyes and swallows the coffee with a loud and pleased ah , smiling wide at Buck as he sets the cup down on the counter, teeth and gums on full display alongside his smugness.\n\nA flat expression is his only response for .2 seconds which is about as long as Buck can wait before launching into his current campaign to get everyone to increase their tea intake.\n\n“You know,” Buck starts, shifting onto his elbows and leaning further into Eddie’s space with flawless ease, “it’s not like I’m trying to get you to stop drinking coffee completely. That would be silly. And futile, clearly.” Buck flicks his eyes down to where Eddie has his hand curled around the cup, holding it close to himself and daring anyone to try and take it away.\n\nEddie sticks out his tongue. Maybe not his best work in regards to comebacks but it always served him well with Adriana who would get so frustrated when he did that to her that she would just sigh dramatically and walk away.\n\nBuck stays.\n\n“Anyway,” Buck continues with a petulant tone that speaks to annoyance but is undermined by the fond smile that kicks at the corner of his lips.\n\nEddie’s own mouth moves in an echo of that smile, all of him warm and fluttering in a way that has nothing to do with the coffee as he tracks the gentle contours of Buck’s lips and the wild movement of his hands as he speaks.\n\n“Coffee actually has a lot of benefits! In moderation. But tea–Well. Technically, if you–if you count them all up, tea has just a few more benefits. It’s really good for blood pressure and cholesterol and–”\n\n“And contains a wealth of antioxidants which provide a more sustaining and balanced energy boost. Also, studies have shown that tea is great for managing stress levels and improving people’s mental health and productivity,” Eddie finishes for him, reciting the information as if he is reading off a script, slapping his palms down on the counter definitively and puffing out his chest a bit in misplaced pride, mostly to get a reaction out of Buck but also because it feels good to prove Buck isn’t the only person who can retain random information.\n\nBuck blinks at Eddie, all fast and dramatic and comical, and the lines around his mouth go a bit tense, as if Eddie has taken the wind out of his sails and he’s not sure whether to be bothered or amused by it.\n\nEddie laughs for the second time in a handful of minutes, ribs creaking pleasantly around the sound and his tongue dancing from the fizzy taste as the laugh exits his mouth, leaping out toward Buck with such eager haste Eddie should probably feel shame for but doesn’t. Not when it’s Buck.\n\nBuck and shame don’t belong together.\n\nA breathy huff breaks past Buck’s lips, harsh enough that it’s almost like he’s blowing a raspberry at Eddie and then oh how his mouth curves, slipping slowly into a shape that makes Eddie feel like he is receiving grace, all lit up and warm and holy thanks to the divinity cradled in Buck’s pretty smile.\n\nThat special, lovely expression of his is back again, and it really shouldn’t be surprising, but it is, making Buck look like he is astounded by Eddie’s laugh and cheer, like he loves it more than anything, like he is half a second away from holding out his hands so he can take all Eddie has to give.\n\nThen the expression flickers, trembling away as Buck is coated by a delicate pink that spreads over his cheeks and dips down over his jawline to crawl along his neck, deepening the hollow of his throat enough that Eddie finds himself transfixed by the spot. The gentle sweep of it. The colorful flush. The accentuation of his collarbones that peek out of his shirt.\n\nEddie swallows, wincing when it clicks in the back of his throat.\n\nBuck ducks his head, shoulders hunching up to his ears and his lashes fluttering like flakes of gold in the wind and his smile deepening enough that a dimple pops out in his right cheek. Lovely. So goddamn lovely Eddie aches from it.\n\nEddie aches . He aches an awful hurt but also shudders from pleasurable relief as Buck shakes his head once it’s reached the bottom of its descent then straightens back up, nose scrunching with the force of his pronounced, clear endearment.\n\n“And why do you know so much about tea? When did you learn so much about tea?” Buck asks haughtily.\n\n“Uh, since you got on a tea kick and started reading articles about it out loud like they were front page news. Also, it was only two facts, Buck. Hardly qualifies as so much .”\n\nBuck’s mouth opens then closes, a strange sort of sound knocking against the back of his teeth. He says nothing though, apparently unable to form whatever it is he wants to say. He just looks at Eddie, blue eyes turning even more blue and shining with something that reminds Eddie of starlight while his fingers jitter over the marble of the countertop and his chest stutters.\n\nIf Eddie didn’t know better he would say that he’s caught Buck off guard, or at the very least done something unexpected or surprising or worthwhile enough to make Buck pause and take Eddie in as if he’s been given something he didn’t even know he needed.\n\n“Oh,” Buck eventually says, voice small and hushed but his body seemingly turning larger and starting to glow.\n\n“Oh?” Eddie repeats, reaching forward to stall the wild tapping of Buck’s fingers and leaning in enough that he can crane his head at an angle that forces their eyes to meet.\n\nA harsh tremble ricochets through Buck’s thick fingers, big and noticeable enough that Eddie feels it travel over his own knuckles and burrow into his joints. He’s not really sure why it’s so easy to do this, to reach out and touch and cross over a bridge without knowing what’s on the other side, but it is with Buck. Always has been.\n\n“What does that mean?” Eddie asks when Buck just keeps looking at him.\n\nBuck licks his lips and shakes his head, something dazed seeping into his fine, golden features.\n\n“N–Nothing,” Buck breathes out through a shaky laugh, his head still bobbing back and forth with a denial Eddie doesn’t understand.\n\nEddie hums and curls his fingers underneath Buck’s, fingernails scratching at the top of Buck’s palm in a silent plea. Tell me .\n\nBuck sighs and seemingly turns even more pink, his hand closing around Eddie’s in a grip so firm and determined that Eddie doesn’t think anything could separate the two of them.\n\n“Just–” Buck pauses, lips pursing as he considers and thinks over his words, a rare enough sight that Eddie considers slipping his phone out of his pocket so he can take a picture and use it to tease Buck later, but he refrains because he doesn’t want to let go of Buck’s hand.\n\nAnd he would need both hands to get his phone. Obviously.\n\n“You listened,” Buck finally says with a too casual shrug.\n\nEddie nods even as something in his chest twists tight enough he goes sore.\n\n“Hard not to,” he teases, flashing Buck a grin. “But why would I not want to?”\n\n“Eddie,” Buck groans, falling forward with a startling suddenness until his forehead meets their tangled fingers.\n\nHis face is warm against Eddie’s knuckles and Eddie’s blood rushes beneath his skin to match the frequency and vibrancy of that warmth.\n\n“Buck,” Eddie replies in the same tone of voice, playful because he doesn’t know how else to be around Buck but also because he’s a bit confused and relying on their kind-hearted teasing has never done him wrong.\n\nBreath blasts across Eddie’s skin, tunneling into the space between their hands, hot and damp and exasperated.\n\nBuck stutters, “You–I’m–It’s just–” and then he groans again and presses his brow against their hands harder before lifting himself up and smiling so brightly Eddie is almost blinded by it.\n\n“How are you doing?” Buck asks, practically chirping the question as he vibrates right in front of Eddie while also somehow maintaining that sensual, sideways sprawl of his that drives Eddie crazy.\n\nEddie points to his own chest with his free hand. “How am I–What?”\n\n“Need me to ask it slower?”\n\n“Alright, asshole. You know what I mean.”\n\n“Hmm, can’t say I do.”\n\n“You’re not smooth. Or anything other than obvious, y’know.”\n\nBuck chuckles, the tenor of it a little lower than how his mirth usually sounds. It’s almost–wry. Or maybe rueful, as if the laugh is directed solely at himself in an unpleasant way. “Yeah,” Buck agrees too easily. “I know.”\n\nNow Eddie is sure he has taken a few too many missteps, veering off of a course he assumed was leading them to the same place. It’s not often he feels like that around Buck so he’s not really sure what to do about it other than–keep going.\n\nBuck shoots him a soft, kind smile like he’s forgiving Eddie for something, then wiggles his fingers against Eddie’s. “So, how are you, Eddie? Really.”\n\nEddie gives himself just a moment to truthfully consider the question.\n\nLying is technically an option, but Buck would know and then wouldn’t let it go and poke and prod at Eddie until he found the right bruise then wait for Eddie to bare the whole ugly, messy thing to him so he could take care of it. A very familiar dance, but one Eddie finds himself too tired to perform.\n\nPlus, he doesn’t like lying to Buck. He doesn’t like lying to anyone about anything, but when it comes to Buck, it feels especially shitty to do so.\n\nEddie leans back, almost too far, his booted heels slipping against the rungs at the bottom of the stool so he can gain enough balance to keep himself from falling. His hand follows the rest of his body, pulling away from Buck so that he’s not as enveloped in his gravity but not too far away from him either. Buck just follows, not letting go of Eddie’s hand though his grip does loosen, giving Eddie the option to retreat entirely.\n\nAdoration flickers through Eddie’s blood like fractals of sunlight, honey-toned and sultry and warm.\n\nA sigh flutters out of him, soft and mostly soundless, easily blending into their surroundings, his exhaustion and the ache of missing Chris folding into the low sounds of the reality show Ravi is watching and the sloshing of suds and water as Trevors washes the truck and the light flick of cards as Hen and Chim battle in a game of rummy at the table.\n\nEddie stores up each noise, lets them all rumble over his skin and burrow into his bones, replace the loud quiet that’s taken up residence in every part of him, drowning out everything he chokes on in the middle of the night when he’s alone and only the soft sound of Buck’s snores down the hall or the rattle of wind against his window keeps him sane.\n\nYeah, he’s not–great.\n\nIt’s unmistakable, he’s sure, no matter how much he covers it up or how convincing of an act he puts on. He finds that it’s harder these days–the pretending. Once, it was as easy as anything. Second nature. As natural to him as breathing. Unthinkingly done. A mask he donned on once and couldn’t take off, so accustomed to how it fit him that he began to forget what he looked like without it.\n\nNowadays, it doesn’t really work like that. Since he cracked wide open one night and Buck inserted himself through that opening. Since he realized how much he was ruining himself and discovered he didn’t really wanna do that anymore. Since he’s dedicated himself to being honest with himself and the people he loves.\n\nStill, some habits do die hard and while Eddie may not be as much of a pro as he used to be that doesn’t mean he has retired entirely. Besides, it’s not like Buck doesn’t know the answer to his question. Buck has been there through it all, from the moment Eddie had to let Chris go to this moment here months later. So, Eddie thinks he can get away with deflecting which isn’t lying it’s just–delaying.\n\nDelaying because he has to keep himself together here. Delaying because if he vomits everything into Buck’s lap it might never get cleaned off. Delaying because it feels important for some reason to keep this moment with Buck light and sweet and free the way it always used to be between them before Eddie blew up his life and lost his son and Buck revealed a piece of himself newly discovered, a piece that Eddie couldn’t help him explore, not then for a myriad of reasons and certainly not now because–\n\nWell, because. There are reasons. He’s usually sure of them and he still is even if he can’t really remember them right now when Buck is holding his hand and being so– Buck .\n\nEddie throws Buck a tight smile, the corners of it probably horribly transparent and crumpling. “I’m peachy. A-okay. Stunning, actually.” He injects as much cheer into his voice as he can, making it warm and inviting and threaded with amusement and something else that begs Buck to play along.\n\nAnd, really, Eddie supposes he could be worse.\n\nHe hasn’t broken any of his shit or entered an illegal fighting ring or briefly thought about turning his grief on himself with a bat. So, yeah, he’s doing good.\n\n“Stunning, huh?” Buck asks, mouth quirking in a way that says Sure, bud. You’re delusional, but sure.\n\nEddie shoves his foot forward to kick Buck in the shin. “Yup,” he says, popping the p loud enough to drown out Buck’s groan and smiling brightly enough he thinks his cheeks might crack open.\n\nHe grasps desperately at the coffee mug and brings it back to his mouth, inhaling the dark caffeine with a sigh that stays captive in his chest. It’s cooled off a bit by now, but it’s not lukewarm or nasty enough to keep him from drinking.\n\n“You’re never gonna get to sleep tonight,” Buck says, gesturing to the coffee with a wave of his large hand as if he is somehow aware that it’s Eddie’s third cup which would be impossible for him to know but Buck has always been good at knowing things about Eddie that Eddie hasn’t explicitly shared.\n\n“Wasn’t going to anyway,” Eddie jokes but it falls a little flat.\n\nBuck makes a noise that’s some kind of hybrid of a hum and a grunt, brow furrowing and nose crinkling in that specific way of his that means he is displeased. Then he tilts his head side to side like he is physically rolling a thought around in his brain, mouth puckering tightly right before he says, “Well, maybe I could come over tonight and help tire you out.”\n\nEddie chokes.\n\nThe coffee twists and scrapes against his throat, bubbling up and threatening to come back out his mouth, but Eddie manages to clamp his lips shut and swallow it down, raising a fist to thump at his chest in a vain attempt to beat away the strain there.\n\nAt least there is Buck’s expression to distract him from the dull pain of nearly dying on his coffee. It’s a little hard to see thanks to the film of tears in Eddie’s eyes but Buck’s face unmistakably goes up in flames, red eating away at the pretty cream of his skin as his eyes widen and his body goes still.\n\n“I–um.” Buck stops, coughs out a twisted, rough laugh. Continues. “That’s not–I wasn’t. Y’know, I wasn’t–” He coughs again, like he’s the one that’s been caught off guard and is choking on his drink.\n\nBlue eyes fall away from Eddie, slipping closed in what looks like mortification, and then Buck’s hand quickly disentangles itself from Eddie’s, gone so rapidly that Eddie is left cold.\n\nBuck quickly brings both hands up in the air, placating at first and then gesturing wildly, fingers fluttering and stuttering like butterfly wings struggling against an updraft. “What I meant was, heh –” a hollow, panicked smile stretches over his face which still looks flaming hot and then he clears his throat, looking back up at Eddie and widening his eyes in a plea. “Well, you know what I meant.”\n\nEddie could take mercy on him, but, well, one of his favorite things is being a little shit and in particular being a little shit with and to Buck. There’s an awful sort of satisfaction in making Buck squirm that Eddie can’t often deny himself.\n\nSo, while his throat aches and something twinges in his chest–sore and rabid and filled with a dozen scenarios he cannot allow himself to comprehend or visualize–Eddie decides to taunt Buck because that’s easy and safe and it’s a type of good he can let himself chase.\n\n“I–Not really,” Eddie says, voice raw.\n\nBuck deflates, all misery wrapped up in a big, muscled body. Honestly, kind of pathetic looking. Wilting like he wants to fall to the floor and maybe even further, bury himself in the core of the earth. A familiar enough feeling that Eddie relents and says, “Jesus, Buck. Relax,” with a laugh and a clap to Buck’s strong shoulder.\n\nBuck frowns then grumbles, “I think I need a new best friend.”\n\nEddie playfully frowns back, and he thinks about saying something about how territorial Buck got when he acquired a new friend, something Eddie isn’t sure how he missed when it was happening, but–he doesn’t mention it, because really, that wasn’t about him and that’s–fine. Doesn’t matter. Definitely doesn’t disappoint him.\n\nEddie Diaz meet denial. Maybe you know each other. Get comfortable because you’ll have a long, non-happy life together.\n\nGod, he’s pathetic.\n\n“Like you could find anyone better than me,” Eddie says quickly, thankfully not tripping over the words he wants to believe but isn’t sure he does.\n\nHe likes to think he’s been a good friend to Buck. He has to be otherwise why the hell would Buck keep him around and Eddie is dying for some kind of certainty to cling onto and if there is one thing he does it is try so he makes himself believe the words enough that they come out both goading and genuine.\n\nHe expects Buck to quip back, maybe rake him through the coals a little or make a joke that will either be hilarious or terribly unfunny (Eddie would laugh either way), but instead, Buck gets–sweet.\n\nHis eyelashes do that stupid flutter which always feels like hell on Eddie’s heart and his mouth goes all crooked and every bit of him softens, almost like–well, Eddie could almost swear that it’s like Buck is swooning, but–\n\nHmm.\n\n“No,” Buck replies quietly. “No, I couldn’t.” And he says it with such conviction, like he believes it whole-heartedly, like he’s happy about it, like it’s just a fact that there’s no one better for him than Eddie.\n\nWell, alright, Eddie kind of wants to cry about that.\n\nIt’s too much. Buck always places too much faith, too much trust, too much acceptance, too much everything in Eddie. And it’s not that Eddie doesn’t want it or can’t carry it, but god, he can’t be worthy of it and he certainly isn’t capable of taking good enough care of it, that’s been proven time and time again. Though maybe–It’s stupid to compare and wouldn’t even work anyway, but maybe Buck isn’t like everyone else.\n\nShannon and Ana and Marisol. Maybe all his problems with them existed for a reason and maybe he would have different problems, better problems–ones he could actually deal with and not fumble over–with Buck.\n\nAnd maybe Eddie should stop comparing Buck to his past love interests. Because he can’t–he can’t. Eddie can know that he wants to, but that’s where the line ends. Because all he’s been able to hear for a while now is Buck saying that’s a relief .\n\nWhen Buck came out to him Eddie said things wouldn’t change between them and that's clearly what Buck wanted. And it’s not like Eddie didn’t mean it then, he did and he does, but–in that moment something hooked deep into his belly, as if the haziness he’s been looking through his entire life lifted and finally there was the answer.\n\nBuck.\n\nMaybe men in general, but definitely Buck.\n\nBut no. Not for Eddie. Because Buck didn’t want anything to change. And that’s for the best.\n\nEddie has no clue what to do with Buck and he carries the ghost of his wife in his back pocket and he is so afraid of handing over that last bit of himself because if he does and it’s wrong or it fails then Eddie has nothing left and despite the evidence to the contrary, he does has some sense of self preservation.\n\nIf only Buck wouldn’t be like– this .\n\nOpen and sweet and loving. Helpful and ridiculous and stubborn. Warm and kind and understanding. Joking and nervous and blushing as if he–\n\nRavi shouts something at the TV, his high-pitched bemoaning of a person’s life choices shattering the rest of Eddie’s last thought into pieces.\n\nEddie startles, jarred from being pushed so viscerally back into this moment where Buck is still looking at him all sweet though it fades slowly as he looks away from Eddie and towards Ravi, all of that sweetness tucking itself away.\n\nA sharp nip of relief gnaws on Eddie, and he feels a little guilty for it, but he breathes a little better for it too.\n\nHen slaps her hand of cards down on the table and says to Ravi, “You know, they can’t hear you, right?” with equal amounts of exasperation and teasing.\n\nRavi scoffs and, without even turning to look at her, replies, “Not the point. It’s part of the experience, Henrietta.”\n\nEddie winces at the sharp, cutting look Hen aims at the back of Ravi’s head, then laughs when Chim snaps his fingers and says, “Hey, pay attention to me. We got a game here and I am going to win this round.”\n\n“Oh, you actually believe that,” Hen says with a scoff, turning away from Ravi and leveling Chim with a shit eating grin.\n\nBuck’s laugh is a little quieter than Eddie’s, but it bursts out of him all the same, reaching out toward Eddie with invisible fingers that land on his chin and turn his head back toward Buck.\n\nHe looks normal, like whatever happened a moment ago was in fact not like how Eddie was concocting it in his head. Buck’s eyes have that usual shine and his near permanent smile is plastered on his place and there’s no tension in his shoulders or longing in his expression, so–\n\nSo, Eddie decides to keep steering them away from whatever that was and mentions something he’s been meaning to bring up. “Hey,” he says, hushed enough that it won’t reach the ears of the others, and raps his knuckles against Buck’s to get his attention.\n\nBuck hums in question.\n\n“Speaking of friends–” Eddie pauses a moment, his phone and the unanswered text in it burning a hole in his pocket, the inside of his bottom lip quickly turning raw and sore from him chewing on it. He shakes his head at himself and releases his lip. “Tommy texted me.”\n\nBuck doesn’t say anything. He just nods, nothing faltering in his expression, the ghost of a smile that Eddie knows only belonged to Tommy appearing on his mouth.\n\nThe silence continues for a few seconds, prolonged and stretching like taffy and Eddie is just waiting for it to break, because it’s not exactly great just to plop mention of someone’s ex into a conversation like this, but Buck must be waiting too because his eyebrows flick up his forehead right before he expectantly says, “And?”\n\nEddie blows out a breath. “What do you mean and ? Your ex-boyfriend texted me and wants to hang out.”\n\n“Okay,” Buck says immediately, nodding some more, still smiling even as his features contort with what looks like confusion. “I’m–Okay. Is there more? Are you, like, telling me or is there a question in there somewhere?”\n\nWell.\n\nOkay, so Eddie knows that Buck hasn’t exactly been heartbroken over the whole Tommy thing. He was a bit down for the first week, but it wasn’t like it was in the aftermath of his past breakups, and ever since then he’s genuinely seemed okay about it all. A bit like he’s sad that things ended however they did but not devastated or hurt by it.\n\nSo, Eddie wasn’t exactly expecting Buck to break out in tears or anything, but still–Isn’t this a bit too casual?\n\nAnd yet here Buck is, acting like he’s not sure why Eddie felt the burning need to tell him this or where it’s leading, and it leaves Eddie kind of stumbling.\n\n“It’s just that–alright, you dick, I just wanted to check in and make sure that I’m not breaking the bro code or some shit if I hang out with him.”\n\n“The bro code?” Buck asks, humor clinging to every word and dimpling his cheek.\n\n“Shut up. It’s a thing. Right? I mean, when we were twelve my friend Cole got onto me for breaking it when I talked to Shelly Moore after she said she wouldn’t go out with him. But, come on, I didn’t know that she had rejected him and I was asking about our math homework. Falsely accused there, but y’know–” Eddie waves his hand, gesturing between him and Buck and an imaginary Tommy, “This is a little different, plus you’re more important than Cole ever was, so I just wanted to make sure.”\n\n“That is–actually kinda sweet,” Buck murmurs slowly, his eyes practically dancing as he watches the no doubt criminally red flush stain Eddie’s cheeks.\n\nEddie can feel its heat spread over his skin, giving him away completely, and he would quite like to stick his head in a pot of ice water thank you, or maybe even in the earth so he never has to look at anything ever again.\n\nThe thing is, it’s a tease but the sincerity in Buck’s words rings bright and true, and Eddie has been called many things in his life but sweet ain’t one of them.\n\nAt least, not in a while.\n\nNot since Adriana caught him taking care of one of her baby dolls when he was six. Not since he was bumbling his way through trying to impress Shannon and keep her attention, struck with heat and sick with love. Not since he used to run to Abuela’s house, bounding through the door and greeting her with a kiss on each cheek.\n\nWhen he was fifteen, he made Adriana vow to take the secret of him playing with her doll to the grave by agreeing to not tell their parents that she snuck out to her friend Alicia’s house and came back with the smell of beer on her breath.\n\nShannon–He can’t remember the last time she called him sweet. It was long enough ago that it doesn’t apply to this version of himself.\n\nHe still kisses Abuela’s cheeks when he sees her because the one time he didn’t she smacked his head and asked where her kisses were and to this day, though he doesn’t get the chance to see her often anymore, she will murmur about how sweet he is in Spanish the same way Buck is now, as if it’s lovely and true.\n\nMaybe it is, maybe it isn’t. Either way he squirms and blushes and shoots Buck a flat glare that makes the other man chuckle.\n\nEddie grunts through a smile. “Look, I just don’t wanna mess anything up.” Not with you. I can’t bear to do so with you .\n\nBuck lets out this little breath, not a huff or a sigh but just the barest exhale like something has fallen off his chest, chin dropping and smile softening enough Eddie thinks he could reach out and pick it up, slip that smile in his pocket to carry with him. “Man, you’re good. Really. Hang out with Tommy all you want. It’s great you guys are friends. I’ve never–I’ve never had a problem with you being friends. And, hey, me and him are still friends too. Admittedly, it took a little bit after the–breakup, but it’s all good.”\n\nBuck’s hands flutter in between them as if he is trying to physically represent that no hard feelings are held anywhere and the air is all clear, then reaches forward to grab Eddie’s cup still about a third of the way full and most likely lukewarm or cold by now and strides over to the sink while saying over his shoulder, “Just–y’know. Don’t go liking Tommy more than me,” and it’s said casually and with amusement but rings a little hollow.\n\nAnd Eddie–\n\nEddie blue screens.\n\nBuck has gotten up and moved on like that’s the end of the conversation, perfectly content it seems and settled in a way Eddie doesn’t think he has ever been, a type of settled that brings a peace Eddie has always ached for, a type of settled that has only grown since Buck came out months ago.\n\nHe’s humming to himself as he pours the coffee out of Eddie’s mug, unaware of the way Eddie’s brain is skipping and trying to restart.\n\nAnd Eddie would reply to him. He would make a bit of fun and then sincerely say Never. I could never like anyone more than you .\n\nBut–\n\nHe’s just incredibly fucking stumped.\n\nThe thing is, they haven’t really talked about this. About Tommy. Or the breakup.\n\nBuck told Eddie about the breakup of course, about two days after it happened, but all he said was, It’s over with Tommy. It was good, but just–not right. Not what either of us needed or wanted anymore , and that was it.\n\nThat. Was. It.\n\nAnd look, it’s not like Buck owes him anything, least of all the nitty gritty details about how his first relationship with a man–a very strong, kind, affectionate, self-assured man–ended.\n\nFor the most part, talk of their relationships have always been a kind of no man’s land. Avoided. Treaded through carefully if it was necessary. The two of them flooded with wariness because they don’t want to blow anything up.\n\nWhen things are going wrong, they’ll open up to one another a little bit, try and get some help or clarity, and then–well, then usually that relationship ends, but Eddie’s sure that’s just a case of correlation does not equal causation. Maybe. Possibly. Or not, but that doesn’t matter.\n\nBecause breakups–they’ve talked about those, sometimes to death. It’s happened enough that there is a familiar aftermath. The two of them tucked together on Eddie’s couch with beer if it’s Eddie’s breakup (or in the one instance his dead wife) or wine if it’s Buck’s breakup. A series of action-packed adventure movies. Hushed conversation packed in between high-stakes scenes and tucked into the low lamplight. Comforting hands placed on shoulders and knees.\n\nNot this time.\n\nBuck didn’t come to Eddie after things ended with Tommy. He called Eddie on a Tuesday afternoon when Eddie was trying to learn how to make macarons because he was that goddamn bored and Hen mentioned wanting to try some and his house was too quiet so he figured why not try baking something for a friend.\n\nEddie was a bit distracted as Buck talked, his voice even and normal, no hint that he was hiding how he actually felt as he relayed the news and then moved on to talk about the new butterfly sanctuary opening up in a couple months that he thought Chris would love to go to, said so casually as if it was fact that Chris was coming back, and Eddie had the urge to fall to his knees and ask if Buck knew something he didn’t and if he would please share with the class and then maybe bawl about how much he misses his son and how afraid he is that he’s lost Chris forever because it seems like he’s incapable of keeping anyone.\n\nExcept for Buck. Except for this family of his that has been forged in hellfire and hope. Something Eddie could recognize even in the midst of his despair as Buck kept chattering in his ear, so he acknowledged the thoughts and feelings and then moved on, brain stuck on the idea of Buck and Tommy no longer being together even though Buck had already quickly sailed past that.\n\nThroughout the rest of the call, Eddie had really wanted to ask for more of an explanation about what happened with Tommy because he’s nosy in general but especially so when it comes to Buck and he needed a distraction, but he hadn’t wanted to rub salt in what he figured was a wound Buck was trying to patch up himself, so he let it go, responding as best he could to the whirlwind of information Buck was throwing his way, and they just never really mentioned it again.\n\nThere was no moping. No showing up on Eddie’s doorstep with his metaphorical tail tucked between his legs. No rough scrape of his voice as his tenor deepens while he bemoans what happened and tries to figure out why it didn’t work. Nothing.\n\nIt’s kind of been driving Eddie crazy. Not enough to make him press Buck for anything because he’s been a bit preoccupied with surviving in a Chris-less world plus he never wants to ask for something Buck doesn’t want to give him, but now he’s having to add the fact that Buck and Tommy are still friends to this unsolved equation that’s been floating around in his head and he is–\n\nConfused. Unsure. And unsettled though that could be the sick twist of his stomach.\n\nToo much coffee surely. And probably all the things he has been burying for decades. Dangerous combination.\n\nEddie drags a hand over his mouth, trying to catch something he hasn’t yet let fall out of his mouth, and walks over to Buck’s side, something velvet soft and wild thrumming in his blood when he sees Buck is pouring him a fresh cup of coffee and adding a bit of the extra sweetened vanilla creamer Eddie loves but doesn’t often indulge in.\n\nEddie knocks his elbow against Buck’s in thanks, his heart stuttering when Buck flashes him a smile in response. “So you and Tommy–You still see each other then?”\n\n“Hmm? Oh. Yeah. Every now and then. His schedule has been even crazier than ours these past few weeks, but we sneak in a movie or dinner or a hike when we can.”\n\n“I–didn’t know that.”\n\nBuck shrugs, unbothered, fingers steady as he stirs a spoon in Eddie’s coffee before handing it over with a blinding grin and an expectant expression like he’s waiting to be told how good he has done.\n\nEddie takes the cup, skin sliding against Buck’s and oh there’s that warmth again, soothing and pink. He hides his smile in the coffee, taking a large gulp and moaning a bit at the taste. Buck always manages to figure out the best coffee to creamer ratio. “Mmm, that’s good,” Eddie mumbles against the rim, appreciating the extra rush of more caffeine.\n\nGold splatters across Eddie’s vision as Buck’s eyelashes flutter, seemingly following the movement of his chest, rapid and consuming.\n\nHe thinks about saying something to wipe away that gold, but he’s not sure what. He could mention how weird he thinks it is that things are still that good between Buck and Tommy, but he doesn’t want to be mean even if it is true.\n\nEddie certainly can’t imagine being like that with any of his exes. Just the mere thought makes him want to cringe. Though he’s never had an amicable breakup like this either.\n\nWhen Eddie ends things it always has to be in disaster, definitive and final enough that its meaning and implications cannot be missed.\n\nMaybe things could have been different with Shannon the second time. Maybe they could have had something like what Buck and Tommy have. They were friends first after all, and he knows at one point they stopped being that for each other, maybe even before they stopped being partners or what a husband and wife should be, but he thinks that perhaps they could have rebuilt that part of themselves. Become friends again. Gotten to know each other once more.\n\nWhen Shannon was asking for a divorce, it felt like a finality Eddie didn’t know how to deal with. As if she would again be plucked out of his life and never return. And he’s pretty sure that he’s avoided examining that reality because her choosing to leave again is just–impossible to consider or bear, his heart too broken to endure another crack, his body too exhausted to maintain any anger, so Eddie leaves it alone, happy to believe there was still something more in store for them even though she only ever indicated she wanted less of him.\n\nHe can’t ever truly know what would have happened afterward if Shannon hadn’t died and he’ll probably always struggle with that, but he can’t make himself believe that her choosing to go and staying away forever was going to be the ultimate end.\n\nIt would have taken time, a lot of time most likely, but he thinks something good, something amicable would have been possible for them.\n\nBut it was never going to be the way Eddie tried to make it. Shannon and him were never going to live in the fantasy that overtook Eddie when he saw Kim and the possibility of a second chance he’s struggled with never having. It was over for them in that regard, long before she asked for a divorce, but having her as a friend would have been good.\n\nFighting with her and missing her and talking about everything and maybe even hurting each other some more before finding closure and moving on together, he would have taken all of that over the loss of her.\n\nThat realization doesn’t help very much, but at least it’s honest and not delusional.\n\nTurns out healing is possible in some capacity, even for someone as wrecked and messy as him.\n\n“Eddie?”\n\nEddie blinks away the vision of Shannon in candlelight, breaking his heart as gently and harshly as only she could. “Yeah?” he asks, gravelly enough that he has to clear his throat. He’s not sure how long he has stood here, thinking about Buck and Tommy and him and Shannon, but god he hopes it hasn’t been long. “Yeah,” he repeats with a thin smile he directs at the ground while setting his cup down. “I’m good.”\n\n“I didn’t ask,” Buck points out, stepping in until the toes of their shoes are touching.\n\nEddie inhales sharply, a little overwhelmed by the largeness of Buck and how he always dominates any space he is in but in a way that’s never aggressive or harsh or anything other than–good, lovely, comforting.\n\n“You were going to,” Eddie murmurs, huffing out a laugh at the tail end of his sentence.\n\nThe corner of Buck’s mouth tips sideways and his head goes with it, a silent agreement.\n\nBuck reaches out, slow like he’s worried about spooking Eddie, and the imminent reality that he’s about to be touched by Buck makes every bit of background noise disappear.\n\nSuddenly, they aren’t at the station. There’s no reality TV that makes Ravi curse and sigh like he’s watching a game where his favorite team is losing. There’s no shuffle of cards or filthy remarks passed between Hen and Chim as they try to beat each other.\n\nThere’s no dishwashing machine rumbling next to Eddie’s hip or muted conversation between people below the loft or anything other than Buck.\n\nBuck’s breath. Buck’s warmth. Buck’s pulse, vibrant and hot in his wrist.\n\nAnd Eddie’s heart, loud loud loud. Rushing and humming in his ears.\n\nBuck’s hand lands on Eddie’s waist, firm but gentle, a hold that Eddie could easily step out of, and Eddie wonders what it’s for. He wonders if he has ever been touched there by Buck before and doesn’t think he has. He wonders why Buck is touching him there instead of the safety of Eddie’s arm or shoulder. He wonders if he could transfer all of his weight to the heart of Buck’s palm. He wonders how long Buck would hold him up.\n\nAnd maybe he could find answers to all of those wonderings. Buck certainly looks like he wants to give Eddie something, like he’s aware of the sparking heat he’s transferred to Eddie’s skin through the layer of his uniform, but the isolated existence of the two of them is quickly broken, pierced through by the sound of the alarm.\n\nThey don’t jolt apart though.\n\nBuck’s mouth twitches and his head drops, eyes cast in shadow from this angle and so hauntingly blue like the ocean during a thunderstorm.\n\nEddie finds himself feeling guilty that he couldn’t make this moment permanent, as if he has done something wrong here when he hasn’t done anything at all other than let Buck in and he’s always done that.\n\nBuck’s hand slides down, pausing to press his thumb over Eddie’s hipbone, and then it’s gone.\n\nEddie feels the intimacy of that touch and its sudden loss with a visceral intensity and very nearly catches Buck’s hand in his own to stop it from going too far, to keep Buck tethered to himself, but there’s the frantic slap of boots against the floor and then a pair of hands are squeezing his shoulders, the unmistakable scent of Chim’s thick cologne wafting over Eddie.\n\n“You two just gonna stare at each other while the rest of us save lives?” Chim asks, and Eddie knows there’s an impish grin on his face just from his bright tone.\n\nEddie laughs though to him it sounds a lot more like when he was choking on his coffee earlier. Hopefully it doesn’t to anyone else.\n\nBuck exits his space swiftly, reaching around Eddie to flick Chim on the forehead. “Well, we are the best looking guys here, can you blame us?”\n\nChim barks out an affronted disagreement and then the two of them are off, chasing each other down the stairs. Eddie follows, a little bit slower because he doesn’t want to risk braining himself on the stairs unlike the two of them who nearly collapse at the bottom from the way they are running and shoving at each other.\n\nThough, admittedly, some of his not slowness but lack of extreme haste might have something to do with Buck thinking he is good looking. Which is, y’know, fine. Good. Or not good but–not bad. Yeah, good. Nice. Not really a big deal and it was said as a joke anyways, so–\n\nEddie sighs internally and as he hauls himself up into the cab and settles in front of Buck, their legs perfectly slotting together, he contemplates lying beneath the firetruck so he can be run over, if only to get both his head and his heart to shut the fuck up.\n\nEddie replies to Tommy’s text.\n\nHe’s home when he does it, sitting on his couch which feels too big for him alone and chafing against the eerie quiet that lives and breathes no matter how loud the TV is or how often Eddie blasts music through his phone or how many conversations he has within these walls.\n\nBuck offered again to come home with Eddie when their shift ended, and Eddie very nearly let him. There really wasn’t any reason he shouldn’t but–he shouldn’t rely on Buck too much to fill the empty spaces and silence, right? And he doesn’t ever want to become more of an obligation to Buck than anything else. So, he declined. Said he was wiped and primed to pass out despite all the coffee he drank and the leftover adrenaline from their last call.\n\nThere was a distinct pout on Buck’s mouth, that full bottom lip of his protruding just enough to make Eddie feel like shit, but then it was gone as quick as it appeared and Buck smiled so small and so soft at him before nodding in understanding and tapping his fingers against the inside of Eddie’s elbow as he left the locker room.\n\nThe minute Eddie walked through the door he regretted his decision. Because now he has nothing and no one waiting for him. Just emptiness, just quiet, just all the things he is missing, and he’s never had to face so much of it before.\n\nBut he resisted the urge to call Buck and beg him to come over in a dignified manner, if he’s even capable of that anymore, and went through the motions of putting his bag away, dumping a load of laundry in the washer, and shoveling a sandwich in his mouth as he collapsed on the couch and put on a show he can’t even remember the name of.\n\nAnd he’s remained here for the past two hours, discontent and straining against the absence he is surrounded by. Everything is just so still and it makes his skin itch, makes his chest tight, makes his heart bruise sore.\n\nThat’s when responding to Tommy seems like a good idea. It’s been a couple of days since Tommy sent him the message about hanging out and he feels bad about taking that long to reply, especially since he’s a bit worried about seeing Tommy.\n\nThey saw each other plenty before and during Tommy’s relationship with Buck, and Eddie genuinely likes the guy, he does, what’s not to like, it’s just–\n\nOkay, so yeah, having all this additional free time and space to himself plus the regular sessions with Frank has given Eddie the unfortunate opportunity of figuring some things out, things that maybe would have been better left untouched no matter what Frank says, but Eddie has let himself see them and examine them and he’s–\n\nWell, he’s adrift in more ways than one and he thinks if he sees Tommy he will ask questions he has no right to ask. And now that Tommy is no longer Buck’s, Eddie suddenly can’t compartmentalize anymore. He can’t do something with Tommy and be thinking this is Buck’s boyfriend he has kissed Buck touched Buck loved Buck and Buck has enjoyed it .\n\nThose thoughts helped as much as they–well, hurt isn’t exactly the right word but Eddie doesn’t know how else to explain the ache he felt when confronted with the fact that Buck was enamored with a man Eddie has a lot in common with but who is undoubtedly better than him because Buck chose him.\n\nNow that that is no longer the case, now that the barrier Eddie clung to doesn’t exist anymore, he’s not really sure what to do.\n\nAnd before today it felt like Buck was now his again. Not in a weird or possessive way, but in the way that Eddie now has sole custody after the breakdown of a relationship, but no, Tommy is still in Buck’s life which is great really, but–where does Eddie fit? How does he remain friends with someone who has had Buck in every way and then let him go?\n\nEddie really doesn’t know and he’s so fucking sick and tired of not knowing things. He hates it. It leaves him unmoored and lost. Makes him sit alone in the dark like a pathetic piece of shit and ask questions he’s never gonna find the answers to, at least not by himself.\n\nSo, Eddie sucks it up and asks Tommy if he is free on Saturday then he goes to bed where he stares at the ceiling and waits for the sound of socked feet shuffling into the kitchen or living room which never comes.\n\nTommy picks a bar for them to go to, which usually isn’t Eddie’s scene.\n\nHe genuinely enjoys going out and socializing and he finds something freeing about finding different spots to go to and different types of people to bond with no matter how casual it is, sometimes on his own and other times with Buck glued to his hip, but bars have never been at the top of the list for him unless he’s with a group of people.\n\nBut Tommy promises Eddie will like the place.\n\nAnd he does.\n\nIt’s a bar that caters mostly to veterans and people currently serving. Not decked out in red, white, and blue or praising military service or filled to the brim with jarheads who only like to pick a fight. Instead, the place is very mellow. Cool tones, low music, comfortable leather booths, a stage used for comedy shows and aspiring singers, and a vast array of specialty beers.\n\nIt’s warm, balanced well between shadows and soft golden light. Conversation flows easily but isn’t obnoxiously loud. Heavy boots thud against the scuffed wooden floors. Camaraderie seems to be soaked into the very walls of the building.\n\nThere’s something almost settling about being amongst a crowd of people who know what it’s like, who have been through things similar to you, who have endured an environment that changes you no matter what, and yet they all still smile and laugh and have fun like that part of themselves isn’t broken.\n\nEddie kind of loves it actually. He thinks Tommy can tell because he gives Eddie a quick glance full of understanding and claps him on the shoulder before leading the way to one of the booths in the corner, situated so that no matter where you sit your back isn’t to the door.\n\nTheir waitress, who is apparently a friend of Tommy’s based on the way she yells his name and leans over the table to smack a kiss on his cheek when she first gets to their table, enthusiastically shows them a menu with the beer specials for today along with half a dozen fried appetizers.\n\nSome kind of small, private smile tucks itself into the corner of Eddie’s mouth as he peruses the different types of beers. He has no doubt Buck would love most of these. The more complex the drink the better when it comes to Buck.\n\nEddie wonders if Tommy thought about that when he picked the place. Hell, maybe Tommy brought Buck here to try everything out. Maybe they held hands at this table and flirted and danced together while some indie singer crooned a sultry tune.\n\nMaybe Tommy kissed Buck in this booth or in a dark corner and Buck kissed him back. Maybe they laughed into each other’s mouths. Maybe Buck was too struck by Tommy’s everything that he suggested they leave quicker than intended or else they’ll end up in the bathroom. Maybe Tommy was just as eager because he knew exactly what was in store for him, because he knew exactly what to do with Buck, because he knew exactly what he would find beneath Buck’s clothes and in the most hidden, intimate places of his body.\n\nThings Eddie hasn’t ever done with Buck. Parts of Buck he doesn’t know. Pieces he doesn’t have access to. Moments that aren’t his to have.\n\nSomething sickly and awful settles in the pit of his stomach, making it roll violently.\n\nEddie shifts in his seat and has to swallow past the lump in his throat twice in order to tell the waitress–Carmen–what he wants. Tommy orders a different beer plus three fried appetizers and then it’s just the two of them.\n\n“How have you been, man?” Tommy asks, his gaze focused and intent as usual as he places his elbows on the table.\n\nEddie leans back against the booth’s soft cushion, breathes in the scent of wood and beer and people, listens to the mundane, steady noise around him. “Not too bad,” he replies with an ease that almost feels natural. “Working a lot, y’know. And, well, I’m not sure if Buck has told you, but Christopher is spending some time with his grandparents, so–”\n\nTommy nods. “So you’ve some time on your hands that you have no idea what to do with.”\n\nEddie chuckles and throws his head back against the booth. “Yeah. Yeah. I mean I knew my life was busy, it kind of always has been, but I didn’t realize how much of it was Chris. Not that I’m complaining. Just–”\n\n“It’s different,” Tommy says, and Eddie kind of hates how well Tommy is able to understand people, but he also really appreciates it too. “Can’t imagine what it’s like. Must be a real change.”\n\n“Sure is,” Eddie mutters, a little bitterness making his tone bite harder than he meant it to. He looks back at Tommy and shrugs, his mouth contorting into a well-practiced smile. “But it’s fine. I’m dealing.”\n\nTommy hums, eyes drifting off to the side. He must catch sight of Carmen heading back their way because he grins and leans back in seat right before she appears at their table and deposits their beers in front of them with impressive speed before she’s off again to serve the next table.\n\nEddie takes a drink and finds himself delighted by the tart and rich flavor.\n\n“I swear, best beer in L.A. is here,” Tommy says with a little laugh at Eddie’s expression. He tips his bottle toward Eddie then takes a drink too.\n\n“Mmm, yeah, you might be right. This is great.” Eddie takes another drink, eyes slipping closed in appreciation. When he’s done he points a finger at Tommy and adds, “You better not let me have too many of these though. I get drunk enough and I’ll be up on that stage.”\n\nTommy laughs, belly deep and loud. “And that’s supposed to discourage me?”\n\nEddie shakes his head with a smile.\n\nHe knows there’s no real danger of getting that drunk. He wouldn’t let himself. The only time he ever did was at Chim’s Chim-less bachelor party. With Buck. And it was fun and easy. An experience he never got to have. An opportunity to be free and uninhibited with his best friend by his side. Eddie can’t really imagine doing that with anyone else. Not even Tommy.\n\nThe rest of the night is nice. Fun. Easy.\n\nThey talk about a lot of different things. Mostly recent calls they’ve had and the outcome of last week’s major MMA fight and the new engine Tommy got for his car and the things Eddie has been distracting himself with in all this extra spare time he has and then they go back and forth trying to come up with the most outlandish activities Eddie could do but hasn’t and probably never will.\n\nConversation like this has always been easy for Eddie, no matter who it’s with, and he’s always enjoyed this type of interaction, a little bit of charm naturally thrown in to thicken his vowels and enough friendliness to establish an uncomplicated connection.\n\nTommy isn’t a rambler, nor does he ever use more words than he needs to, but he always gets his point across and he’s hard to misinterpret and he’s pretty fucking funny too. So yeah, it’s a good time.\n\nAnd as the night is winding down, Eddie now drinking cool water from a tall glass after having two and half beers, he finds himself with a tongue loose enough to ask, “Can I ask you something? About Buck?”\n\nTommy blinks and raises an eyebrow. He doesn’t give Eddie an answer, just a loose shrug and a jerk of his chin.\n\nEddie fidgets a bit, sliding his thumb through the condensation along the bottom of his glass, legs widening under the table to make himself more comfortable. “Not trying to pry or anything. And you can tell me to fuck off. But I was wondering. Why–How did you–well. How did you know it was him? For you. How’d you know?”\n\nNot his best work but hey he got the words out. Score for Diaz.\n\nTommy’s lips press together as he considers, eyes dropping from Eddie’s as he tilts his head this way and that in a move so similar to Buck it makes Eddie’s breath hitch and his stomach sink.\n\nHe does appreciate this part of Tommy though, the way he takes the time to give someone a true and honest answer, though he could be gearing up to tell Eddie it’s none of his business.\n\nWhich is well within his rights to do. Because really it’s not. Eddie has no claim to that kind of information and though Tommy and Buck are friends it may be difficult to talk about it. But Eddie is determined and nosy enough to ask anyway and to silently hope that Tommy gives him an answer.\n\nIt feels important to know for some reason even if it’s not what he had planned on asking.\n\nA little laugh breaks out of Tommy and he spreads his hands wide as he says, “I don’t know. Well no, I do know. It’s just hard to put into words. Evan is just–Evan.”\n\nTo anyone else that might not be sufficient, it might not make any sense, but Eddie gets it. Oh, does he get it.\n\n“He’s very much himself,” Tommy continues, sounding a bit smitten despite himself. “Not a lot of people are or they are scared to be, but not him. He’s unapologetic about it. And very warm, sincere. Cute and fun. Hard not to get swept up in all of that.”\n\nYeah. Yeah, Eddie understands that. More than he should.\n\nHe remembers what it was like at first, when Buck was rankled by his mere presence, peacocking all over the place and trying to be gruff and pressing on any button of Eddie’s he could find as if Eddie was some kind of science experience Buck was trying to make explode. And then–\n\nAnd then Buck folded. Became sweet and almost damn lovely after a compliment. A compliment that was genuinely made because Eddie caught glimpses of what laid behind that veneer and truly believed what everyone else said Buck was really like and god he just wanted a friend so badly and Buck gave that to him like it was nothing.\n\nSomething sealed between them that day with nothing more than smiles and a handshake and Eddie thinks he has been chasing that high ever since.\n\nAnd it makes Eddie want to grill Tommy further, examine the end of their relationship beneath a microscope until he understands every bit of it in ways he’s only ever avoided doing with his own. He wants to ask Why? Why did you let him go? How could you let him go? Why wasn’t it enough? If it were me, I would never–\n\nNo. No. Stop.\n\n“That answer your question?’ Tommy asks, giving Eddie an all too knowing look that has his hackles rising and all of his inner alarms blaring.\n\nEddie clears his throat and coughs into his fist. “Uh, yeah. Thanks. And sorry. For asking. And that it didn’t work out between you and him.” It tastes like a lie, foul and insincere. Awful enough that he considers offering up a prayer for forgiveness, something he hasn't done in a long long time.\n\nTommy eyes him, analytical and sharp. It feels a bit like Eddie is being dissected, like parts of himself he isn’t ready to show are being seen and examined under a microscope. He feigns nonchalance, checking his phone like he’s expecting a message to be there for him, frowning when he finds nothing.\n\nWhen he looks back at Tommy nothing has changed, except for his mouth which opens and closes like he’s about to say something, but he must change his mind because he shakes his head and offers Eddie a smile, then says that it’s getting late and he should probably get home to rest for his shift tomorrow.\n\nRelief is a shockwave, battering against Eddie with enough force that it would knock him over if he was standing.\n\nHe eagerly accepts Tommy’s explanation and takes a large gulp of his water, the temperature of it fucking frigid against the warmth that’s built up beneath his skin, and then he throws enough money on the table to cover for both of them which makes Tommy pause but laugh and say, “Thanks.”\n\nThey walk out of the bar together, silent as they maneuver around people and head toward the door. Once they are outside Tommy brings a light hand to Eddie’s elbow, pulling him to a stop.\n\nEddie looks at him, expectant and also unsure of why it feels like he is about to be dealt a blow.\n\n“I know I don’t know everything,” Tommy says somewhat gently, “but all this time and quiet and space you have might be good. For yourself. So maybe just use it, yeah? Figure out what’s good for you and what you want. Maybe even just take what you want.” He squeezes Eddie’s elbow and smiles with a kindness Eddie doesn’t think he deserves. “Just a friendly suggestion.”\n\nEddie nods, slow and considering, and then, because he’s still a coward even after all this work on himself, he pretends Tommy doesn’t mean what Eddie is pretty sure he means. “Yeah, man. Of course. It’ll be–I’m good. Thanks.”\n\n“Alright. See ya later, Eddie.”\n\nAnd then he’s walking away.\n\nEddie follows suit, turning the other way toward his truck. His heart isn’t beating quite as fast as he expected it to be, as if it’s actually taking into account what Tommy has said while his mind tosses and turns and fills his ears with static. But for once, despite its steady beat that only falters the slightest bit, Eddie’s heart is louder than his head.\n\nWhen he gets home, he calls Buck and asks him to come over for dinner tomorrow night.\n\nSunday mornings were a staple, an event, long awaited and highly celebrated, when Eddie was a kid. And always marked by the very same things, the very same beginning.\n\nThe sweet smell of his mother’s famous honey pancakes. Adriana’s and Sophia’s yelps and groans as they fought for who got the bathroom first. Abuela’s singing trickling up the stairs, typically one of her favorite Spanish hymns, as she set the table for everyone. Sunlight peppering into Eddie’s room and splashing across his face, heavy with gold and shadows as it cast itself across the orange tree that stood right in front of his window.\n\nEddie loved it. Every bit. For years it was a beloved tradition that made him excited every time. Familiarity and family and connection. No matter what, Sundays were the same and they were spent with all of them together. It didn’t matter what arguments had occurred during the week or how many petty annoyances had built up between him and his sisters or how little sleep he had gotten the night before.\n\nOn Sundays, Eddie woke up a little easier. Partly because he really loved it when they were all together, warm and bright and loud, stepping over each other and laughing into sticky hands and talking a mile a minute in a special mixture of Spanish and English. But also, he thinks he loved Sundays so much because the burning spotlight of attention wasn’t focused solely on him.\n\nSure he had to behave, wear a suit and get ready quickly and keep his hands clean and speak politely and not move too much during the sermon and sing along to every song whether he wanted to or not, but he was used to that. There was always an expectation to meet, whether it was Sunday or not, but on the Lord’s day it was all about Him and not about Eddie.\n\nFor a while, that was nice. Comforting anonymity. A break. The same expectations placed on him and his sisters. Abuela’s soothing presence from sunup to sundown. Food, food, food, and more food. His mother’s eyes shining with approval when he sang loud and his father’s broad hand on the back of his neck, communicating something Eddie could never identify but adored nevertheless.\n\nEventually, Sundays became a little less lovely and magical. Eddie started actually listening to the sermons and had too many questions no one wanted to answer. Abuela moved and he no longer had her delicate, beautiful voice to help him wake up in the morning. Singing and merely behaving wasn’t enough to garner approval.\n\nAnd he could tell that lackluster thing he was starting to experience was felt by his sisters too, so he became a pro at mediating bathroom arguments between the two of them and making faces and quiet jokes during the sermon to put smiles on their faces and hiding handfuls of sweets in his pockets so the three of them could sneak away beneath the orange tree in their backyard and stuff their faces with more than their mother would ever let them have.\n\nWhen he moved out, when he suddenly became a father and a husband and a soldier in the blink of an eye, Sundays just became another day, and for the most part he was thankful for that even though he missed having one special day.\n\nHe didn’t necessarily miss church, but he missed having a reason for everyone to be together and filled with something greater than themselves. There was plenty of guilt over that of course, still is to some degree when he passes by a cathedral or spies a cross hanging from someone’s neck or talks to his parents when they get out of church, but not enough to change anything.\n\nHe did have a few somewhat holy Sunday mornings with Shannon right after they got married, the two of them ensconced in bed and refusing to get out of the covers, laid across from one another and giggling like kids as they whispered to each other and shared fleeting kisses and touches.\n\nAfter Christopher was born and Eddie re-enlisted those kinds of mornings became nonexistent, the two of them falling apart much faster than they fell together.\n\nSince then, Sundays haven’t really regained any of their old specialty. With Eddie’s schedule and Christopher’s social calendar it would be kind of hard, plus, he likes to think every day should have that kind of intention, that kind of specialness, that kind of attention and love. He shouldn’t need one designated day to be with his family and he doesn’t.\n\nEddie’s family is there, always there. At work and on his mind and occasionally in his home and tucked into bars and roaming the L.A. countryside and huddled together in diners. Familiarity, connection, love, and yeah, typically a lot of food too. Every day of the week. And any time he can carve out just for himself and Christopher (or for him, Christopher, and Buck), he does, and it works.\n\nIt did work anyway.\n\nIt’s been eighteen Sundays without Chris.\n\nAfter the first ten, Chris started calling. Sporadically, but it happened. And they talked, haltingly at first, Chris’ voice gruff and his demeanor distracted, hurt threaded through every mundane word, but then he started opening up more to Eddie, taking his time with explaining how he felt and Eddie tried his best to do the same, to answer his questions, to offer up his regret and apologies without excusing his choices and making them Chris’ burden to bear.\n\nDifficult and exhausting, but what they needed.\n\nAnd on the nineteenth Sunday, the morning of the day Buck is supposed to come over simply because Eddie asked–a common enough occurrence that it shouldn’t make Eddie vibrate and shimmer with anticipation and possibility but it does –Chris calls.\n\nHis son calls him and says I miss you, I miss home and it’s sacred.\n\nSunlight stretches lazily through the windows, scattering fractals that warm the tops of his bare feet and light up the dust motes Eddie can never get rid of no matter how hard he tries. Coffee clings to his tongue, sweet though a bit stale. A gentle hum of silence vibrates through the house, so different from stomping feet and singing and sleep-soft, mumbled words but just as full and loud and actually not so awful.\n\nEddie thinks that something like religion lies here in the heart of his home, tucked against his ear and thrumming in his blood to the cadence of his son’s voice.\n\nHolier and better than anything Eddie ever felt in a church.\n\nThe awe of that wells up, thick and sticky and nearly devastating enough to steal his voice but he manages to croak out, “I miss you too, bud. All the time. Before you even walked out the door.”\n\nThere’s a sniffle on the other side of the line, sharp and bared, not stifled or hidden but shared and it’s earnest enough that Eddie thinks he might fall apart, body shaking until every atom he’s made up of collapses entirely. “M–maybe, I can come home soon?” Chris asks, as if there could ever be any answer other than yes.\n\nBut the two of them have been through the leaving and returning before, and it’s an ache Eddie knows he might not ever truly alleviate in himself or in Chris which makes him want to scream at the world and tear himself in two, so he understands why the question exists.\n\n“Yeah. Yes, Chris,” Eddie says with a fervor that just might cause his lungs to explode. “Of course. Any time, day or night. You know that.”\n\n“Okay,” Chris whispers and he sounds like he’s four years old and not understanding why Eddie isn’t home with him and Shannon all the time. He sounds like he’s seven and accepting that he is going to be moved across the country because it means it’ll just be the two of them. He sounds like he’s barely eight and facing the fact that his mother is gone forever this go around.\n\nEddie wants him here. He wants to hold his son even though he claims he’s too big for that now. He wants to sink his fingers in Chris’ unruly curls and press a kiss to his warm brow. He wants to catch those eyes of his that shine like Shannon’s and never see any other color than blue again. He wants to curve his body around Chris’ and keep him shielded from hurt for the rest of his life.\n\nBut he settles for, “I love you, mijo . So much.”\n\n“Love you too, Dad,” Chris replies, loud and clear and easy.\n\nBuck arrives at Eddie’s in a whirlwind like usual.\n\nHe comes through the door, his hesitancy about such an action almost entirely gone since Eddie has been persistent enough about telling Buck he doesn’t have to knock, and noise enters into the house with a beautiful, resounding blare.\n\nThe door creaks the slightest bit because Buck always opens it wide enough to strain the hinges and then there’s the immediate thud of him toeing off his shoes accompanied by the swishing of plastic bags because more often than not when he comes over he always has to bring something with him.\n\nEddie once questioned it and tried to reassure Buck that all Eddie ever wants from him is himself, something that brought out that special crooked smile of Buck’s that appears when he’s equal parts bashful and pleased, but all he got in response was a casual Because I want to and an added Also Maddie says it’s nice.\n\nAnd well, Eddie accepted that. Because who is he to dissuade Buck from doing what he wants? Of course it’s something simple and easy to Buck, that’s how his thoughtfulness and kindness always is, a choice Buck could never not make and asking him to not do so would be like asking him to not blink or breathe.\n\nPlus, Eddie got the feeling that Buck was also trying to avoid his sister’s disapproval which Eddie can understand because he’s been on the receiving end of that disapproval before and it is not an experience he ever wants to repeat.\n\nThis time, Buck brought a plastic container of Bobby’s handmade fudge and a case of the beer Eddie tried just last night and loved. He has no idea how Buck managed it or even remembered it. Eddie only mentioned it in passing when he called after getting home, but apparently it left enough of an impression that Buck took it upon himself to go to the bar, charm the employees, and get himself six bottles of their special brew.\n\nEddie kind of loves him a truly insane amount.\n\nIt’s the first thought he has when Buck yanks the beers out of the bag with a flourish, wiggling his fingers wildly and raising his eyebrows high as he says, “Ta-da!” in a sing-song voice that is high-pitched enough Eddie cringes.\n\nBuck is just so big and wonderful and silly and–\n\nAnd beautiful. Lovely.\n\nLovely in that he is to be loved. Lovely in that the only natural thing a person can do is love him. Lovely in that he contains so much love that it pours out of him like blood from a slit vein, sometimes messy and sticking everywhere but endless and bright and warm, full of life and sinking into every single motion, word, thought, and action.\n\nAnd Buck brings out Eddie’s own loveliness he thinks. He’s certainly happier with Buck. Freer. More open. More relaxed. Settled. At peace. Filled to the brim with laughter and smiles and jokes and all things good.\n\nSo yeah, he loves this man.\n\nThe realization is new but not. Its existence is long established, part of Eddie for so long now. But the actual words are new. The realness of them is new. Because he’s held it at bay for a while now, placing so many obstacles in their way but now they are free and god it feels so good.\n\nAnd Buck is so goddamn gorgeous and Eddie wants and that’s never gone well for him but how can he worry about that when Buck is right here like he always is, like he seems to always want to be, so bold and striking with his blue sunshine eyes and pink cheeks and charming, boyish grin and effusive nature and Eddie’s happiness cradled in his hands.\n\nEddie loves Buck, totally and fiercely.\n\nIt’s a truth that rolls like a sparkling tumbleweed over every muscle, vein, and bone. It’s a thing that is so very much alive and full of movement, so boldly apparent and swift and part of everything.\n\nI love him as Eddie takes the beer from Buck with a laugh-soaked smile. I love him as Buck’s broad chest puffs out with pride. I love him as they make dinner together, elbows knocking and hands lightly placed on waists and free flowing conversation and Eddie’s bare toes nudging Buck’s socked ones. I love him as they eat, Buck stuffing his face like he’ll never get a chance to eat again, food falling down his chin and sticking to his teeth, so disgusting and yet Eddie wants to swoon.\n\nI love him as they talk and talk and talk. I love him as they fight and nearly break out into a full-bodied wrestle over the last piece of fudge. I love him as they clean off the table. I love him as they wash the dishes side by side, something so very intimate and domestic that Eddie isn’t sure he’s had with anyone, even Shannon. I love him as Buck’s shirt ends up soaked, like usual, the wet material clinging to the firm swell of his belly.\n\nAnd it’s okay. He feels this so intensely, so brightly, like a star coming to life in his chest. But he doesn’t think it’ll burn or scar him or ever die. He doesn’t think he will be reduced into ash by it. Hell, even if he is, he won't mind it. Not when it’s because of Buck. Not when for the first time loving feels uncomplicated even though it’s anything but.\n\nEddie may freak out about it later, he may struggle with what it means for the rest of himself, he may not know exactly what to do with it or how to handle it without breaking it, he may find it easier to accept the wanting but not the loving , but for now he’s good.\n\nAnd even if all that comes to be, it doesn’t feel like an insurmountable obstacle like so many other things have, placed in his path to make him rush and then hurt.\n\nNo. This love for Buck is–it’s right. It’s beautiful. And Eddie will not be ashamed of it.\n\nI love him as Eddie says, “Dude, you’re dripping onto my floor,” with a scrunched brow and blatant disdain, mouth tight as he looks at the droplets of dirty dishwasher falling to his freshly cleaned floor.\n\nBuck splays his sudsy hands out wide, shrugging indolently and giving Eddie a look that says what the fuck do you want me to do about it ?\n\nEddie huffs. “Go to my room. There’s plenty of clean dry shirts you can choose from to wear while you throw that,” he points at the darkened bottom half of Buck’s blue button up shirt, pausing a bit too long as he stares at the accentuated valley of Buck’s muscles and nearly choking on the heat that crawls up his throat, “in –ahem –in the dryer.”\n\nChrist.\n\nBuck eyes the hollow of Eddie’s throat as if he can see the heat Eddie is drowning in, as if the bright pink and sultry texture of it is visible through Eddie’s skin and it’s as entrancing to him as his bulky stomach is to Eddie.\n\n“Buck,” Eddie pleads.\n\n“Yeah,” Buck answers a little dully, then he shakes his head and blinks real fast, lashes fluttering prettily enough that the motion kicks at Eddie’s heart. “Yeah. Okay, alright. On it.” He gives Eddie a salute, grinning like a wildcat despite how ridiculous he looks, dripping water everywhere while he holds his suds covered hand to his forehead.\n\nEddie’s eye roll rocks through his whole body. “Idiot.”\n\nBuck blows a raspberry at him then turns on his heels, heading towards Eddie’s bedroom with a skip in his step. Too much of a skip though because his socks skid against the hardwood and propel him forward fast enough that he topples and has to catch himself on the doorway that leads into the dining room.\n\nLaughter barrels out of Eddie, quick and resonant, catapulting off his tongue and digging into his ribs hard enough to make him sore.\n\nBuck points a finger at Eddie without looking at him. “Shut up. You didn’t see that.” And then he’s gone.\n\n“I did!” Eddie yells after him, still laughing.\n\nThe laughter clings to him, sticky and warm and sweet, honey dibbling over his vocal chords and against his breastbone and settling deep in his gut.\n\nHe lets it ride out of him slow and indulgent as he turns back to the dishes, painstakingly drying each dish that Buck washed, something that took more time than usual because maybe Eddie has put off doing his dishes for the past couple of days and maybe it drove Buck crazy enough the way Eddie knew it would and he couldn’t keep himself from washing every single one alongside the ones they used tonight.\n\nEddie isn’t above taking a little advantage when Buck seems so willing to let him.\n\nWhen there’s little more than a handful of dishes left to dry, Eddie pauses. It really shouldn’t be taking Buck this long to find a shirt and Eddie knows he hasn’t put his own in the dryer because the tell-tale rattling click of the machine is loudly absent.\n\nEddie folds the hand towel he was using into a neat, precise little rectangle and then slings it over his shoulder, feet carrying him to the hallway where the bedrooms are.\n\nHe doesn’t have to peek into his room to know Buck isn’t there, because Chris’ door is open wider than Eddie left it.\n\nWhen he gets to the doorway, he settles against the painted wood, body a little heavy and weary because he hates how cold this room is without Chris occupying it but also because the image of Buck sitting on Chris’ bed–clad in one of Eddie’s old army t-shirts, hands wringing the wet button up, eyes wide and dark, face grave and so terribly, achingly young–is just about enough to bring Eddie to his knees.\n\nBuck looks up at him through his lashes, shy and quiet as his mouth attempts to curve into a smile, knuckles whitening as his grip on the shirt tightens.\n\n“Thought you got lost,” Eddie says, and his voice is a gunshot through the room, abrasive and harsh. It’s a needless thing to say, an attempt at humor and levity because he wants so badly to make Buck smile and sometimes it feels like that is the only thing he is good at anymore so his need for it is almost ravenous.\n\nBuck puffs out a small attempt at a laugh, ribs expanding noticeably beneath Eddie’s thin shirt, stretching the soft material.\n\nEddie’s fingers twitch and an ache settles in his palms with the familiar sore weight his want has always carried.\n\n“Sorry,” Buck murmurs. “I just–” a shrug and a thin half-smile, “I just miss him.” It’s said helplessly, punctuated with the flare of Buck nostrils that means he is holding something back. Most likely the tears which shimmer in the blue of Buck’s eyes.\n\nEddie drops his temple against th"
