Punathambekar and Mohan, “Sound Clouds.”\n\n4. See, for instance, Jay and Ramaswamy, Empires of Vision. While I do not delve in this book into the intersection of technologies of visuality and those of empire, I do challenge the hegemony of the image in scholarly discourse. To assert the intertwining of empire and vision is not to propose that sound (or music) is somehow neutral or inherently liberatory. Michael Denning encapsulates a whole body of scholarship on colonialism, nationalism, and music when he notes: “colonial music practice instituted new disciplines of the body—new ways of singing, of dancing, of marching, of playing instruments. To speak of the colonization of the ‘ear’ is thus a metonymy: for the reshaping of the musical subject is not only a reshaping of an individual’s muscles—the articulated flesh and bones that make up the singing voice, the instrument-playing hands and lips, the dancing feet and hips. It is also the reshaping of the order of the group—the creation of marching bands and church choirs: a colonization not only of the body, but of articulated bodies.” Denning, “Decolonizing the Ear,” 36.\n\n5. As I discuss in chapter 3, Bombay was renamed Mumbai in 1995. With a few exceptions that pertain to the time period and film in question, I refer to the city as Bombay throughout this book.\n\n6. Gopal and Moorti, Global Bollywood; Booth, Behind the Curtain.\n\n7. Arnold, “Hindi Filmī Gīt”; Manuel, Cassette Culture.\n\n8. See Ranade, Hindi Film Song; Morcom, Hindi Film Songs and the Cinema; Beaster-Jones, Bollywood Sounds; Weidman, Brought to Life by the Voice.\n\n9. Notable touchstones in this category are Gopalan, Cinema of Interruptions; Majumdar, Wanted Cultured Ladies Only!; Mehta, Censorship and Sexuality in Bombay Cinema; Gopal, Conjugations.\n\n10. Growing scholarly interest in South Asian sound studies was evident in symposia at the University of Michigan and Northwestern University in 2016–17; a series of essays gathered in the special forum “Gendered Soundscapes of India,” edited by Monika Mehta and Praseeda Gopinath on the sound studies blog Sounding Out! in 2017; and Brueck, Smith, and Verma’s 2020 edited volume Indian Sound Cultures, Indian Sound Citizenship.\n\n11. Majumdar, “Beyond the Song Sequence.”\n\nPage 194 →12. Weheliye, Phonographies.\n\n13. Desai-Stephens, “Tensions of Musical Re-Animation”; Weidman, “Voices of Meenakumari.”\n\n14. Neepa Majumdar models such an approach as she explores how the distinction between “live” and recorded sound was represented (and experienced/understood) in the early years of sound cinema. The term “interruptions” comes from Lalitha Gopalan’s insightful discussion of the structural functions of film songs in Hindi cinema. Monika Mehta teaches us to think about how the material and industrial forms that the Hindi film song takes (in DVD compilations and award shows, for instance) shape audio- and cine-philia, and the very idea of what a “song” is. Majumdar, “Beyond the Song Sequence”; Gopalan, Cinema of Interruptions; Mehta, “DVD Compilations of Hindi Film Songs”; Mehta, “Authorizing Gesture.”\n\n15. One of the few scholars writing about these sonic elements is Budhaditya Chattopadhyay. See his articles “The Auditory Spectacle,” “The Cinematic Soundscape,” and “Sound Memories.”\n\n16. Sterne, “Sonic Imaginations,” 3.\n\n17. Smith, “Futures of Hearing Pasts,” 13–14.\n\n18. Kheshti, Modernity’s Ear, xx.\n\n19. Sterne, “Sonic Imaginations,” 3–4.\n\n20. Lipari, in particular, frames listening as an ethical orientation to the world. However, the notion of listening as an ethical activity runs through several key texts in sound studies. See Eidsheim, The Race of Sound; Kheshti, Modernity’s Ear; Lacey, Listening Publics; Lipari, Listening, Thinking, Being; Stoever, Sonic Color Line; Hirschkind, The Ethical Soundscape. For a useful summary of the many different ways in which “listening” is conceptualized in sound studies, see Rice, “Listening.” Other useful theorizations of listening by scholars of music and sound include Bonenfant, “Queer Listening to Queer Vocal Timbres”; Furlonge, Race Sounds; Jarman-Ivens, Queer Voices; Ochoa Gautier, Aurality; Vazquez, Listening in Detail; Zuberi, “Listening while Muslim.”\n\n21. Sterne, The Audible Past, 19. Roland Barthes makes a similar distinction, casting hearing as a “physical phenomenon” and listening as a “psychological act” that allows auditors to “decipher” sounds. Barthes, “Listening,” 245.\n\n22. Sterne, The Audible Past, 13. Sterne notes that he is building on Marcel Mauss’s theorization of “body techniques” (and that Mauss influenced Michel Foucault’s thinking on the subject as well).\n\n23. Huacuja Alonso, “Radio, Citizenship, and the ‘Sound Standards,’” 139. For a discussion of the “art of listening” in relation to radio and other sound technologies, music education, and Carnatic music, see Weidman, Singing the Classical, Voicing the Modern, 245–85.\n\n24. For a recent discussion of a range of “ways of listening” on the subcontinent, see Rahaim, Ways of Voice, 96–144.\n\n25.

Stoever, Sonic Color Line, 232 (original emphasis).\n\n30. Kheshti, Modernity’s Ear, xix. For yet another inspiring rumination on the sonic as a counterintuitive and radical modality of perception, see Campt, Listening to Images.\n\n31. Eidsheim, The Race of Sound, 27–28. While my work falls more squarely in the symbolic analysis camp that Eidsheim critiques, I do share her interest in unsettling the givenness of voice, identity, and listening.\n\nRang De Basanti.” See also Denning, “Decolonizing the Ear”; Kun, Audiotopia.\n\n33. Gorbman, Unheard Melodies. Elsewhere, I use the phrase “listening with an accent” to inspire a relationship to language that playfully and carefully delinks the static associations between bodies, identities, and place thought to inhere in the way we speak. Listening with a feminist ear is similarly attentive to power and politics, and similarly utopian in its aspirations. It is, arguably, more expansive a concept in that it is not limited to sounds we hear as “speech.” See my essay “Listening with an Accent—or How to Loeribari” in Rangan et al., Thinking with an Accent.\n\n34. Hilmes, “On a Screen Near You,” 177.\n\n35. Hilmes, “The New Materiality of Radio,” 60n2.\n\n36. Thompson, The Soundscape of Modernity, 1. Also see Samuels et al., “Soundscapes,” for an invaluable discussion of the travails of “soundscape” (and affiliated terms) in the context of their call for a sounded anthropology.\n\n37. Ian Garwood astutely argues that even though fewer songs are now incorporated as discrete musical numbers, the prior functions of the song-dance sequence have been taken over by other cinematic elements in “songless” films. Meanwhile, Sangita Gopal avers that the discrete film song (of the kind Bombay cinema has long been known for) is today a queer, asynchronous entity. A nostalgic sign of an older cinema, it is now attached to the bodies of non-heteronormative couples. She also links the “retreat” of the song sequence and simultaneous rise of the item number to the conjugal possibilities of new Bollywood. While I find both of these arguments enormously convincing and generative, I shy away from descriptors that suggest linear temporality or lack, reminiscent as they are of colonial frameworks that place the colonized “behind” or “outside” time. I offer in this book a few other, complementary ways of making sense of the aural in (contemporary) Hindi cinema. Garwood, “The Songless Bollywood Film”; Gopal, Conjugations, 23–59.\n\n38. Beaster-Jones, “A.R. Rahman and the Aesthetic Transformation of Indian Film Scores”; Sundar, “Making-of Videos.”\n\n39. Both Sangita Gopal and Gregory D. Booth use the term “new Bollywood,” if in slightly different ways. Gopal, Conjugations; Booth, Behind the Curtain.\n\n40. Hilmes, “On a Screen Near You,” 177.\n\n41.

Here, I am riffing on Arjun Appadurai and Carol Appadurai Breckenridge’s formulation of “interocularity” in their foundational work on museums and South Asian public culture more generally. (Their term alludes to Mikhail Bakhtin’s notion of intertextuality.) Woodman Taylor notes the intersection of the visual, the aural, and the tactile in the representation of desire in film songs.

The articulation of gender, sexuality, and nation on screen has been critical to film studies scholarship on India. Foundational texts on this topic include: Virdi, The Cinematic ImagiNation; Chakravarty, National Identity in Indian Popular Cinema, 1947–1987.\n\n51.

Neepa Majumdar’s chapter “The Embodied Voice” remains an invaluable piece of scholarship on the topic.\n\n55. See Chion, Audio-Vision.\n\n56. Hodgson, The Venture of Islam, 59.\n\ndargah only when using it as a stand-alone word. I do not italicize it when using it as part of the term “dargah qawwali” or the name of a famous location, such as Haji Ali Dargah. (I follow a similar strategy with the word masjid [mosque], as in Babri Masjid).\n\n58. My postcolonial studies training is evident in the phrase “listen back,” which riffs on the notion of “writing back” to the empire. Ashcroft, Griffiths, and Tiffin, The Empire Writes Back.\n\n59. Lacey, Listening Publics.\n\nChapter 1\n\n1. “Neeti Mohan, Neha Bhasin, Aditi Singh Sharma, Jonita Gandhi | Female Singers’ Adda.”\n\nghazals. Page 197 →Both Dutt and Bhosle regularly sounded coyer and more brazen than Mangeshkar ever did, but neither occupied the position of the “bad girl” in any straightforward way. The binary also says little about men’s singing voices. This is not a problem in and of itself, except that our focus on Mangeshkar’s voice has kept us from examining how the cultural, historical, industrial, and political contexts of postindependence India configured men’s playback. Another unfortunate effect of this focus is that it has flattened the history of Hindi playback singing to such an extent that singer-actors and playback artists of the 1930s and 1940s are rendered silent in popular and critical memory. They merely serve as the backdrop to Mangeshkar’s rise, and then too they get no more than passing mention. While my chapter does not focus on that cohort, I want to signal the pressing need for research on their voices and on other aspects of playback singing.\n\n3. See Chion, Audio-Vision.\n\n4. Gorbman, “The Master’s Voice,” 8. Gorbman names Sarah Kozloff’s Overhearing Film Dialogue as one of the few texts, apart from Chion’s corpus, that acknowledges that the vocality of film dialogue, the way it is rendered by the actor, is distinct from the words scripted on the page. I discuss the materiality of spoken language in chapter 3 of this book. Here, I take as my object the materiality of the singing voice.\n\n5. Gorbman, 8; Barthes, “The Grain of the Voice.” I use the “grain of the voice” as a central concept in my essay “Meri Awaaz Suno: Women, Vocality, and Nation in Hindi Cinema.”\n\n6. Sjogren, Into the Vortex, 25, 219n80.\n\n7. The few exceptions come from feminist musicology. For a wonderful example from this body of work, see Cusick, “On Musical Performances of Gender and Sex.”\n\n8. Garwood, The Sense of Film Narration, 104.\n\n9. Spivak, “Can the Subaltern Speak?”\n\n10. Amanda Weidman makes a similar point in much of her writing on voice. See, for instance, Weidman, “Neoliberal Logics of Voice.”\n\n11. On the institution of playback singing, see Booth, Behind the Curtain; Indraganti, “Of ‘Ghosts’ and Singers”; Majumdar, “The Embodied Voice”; Majumdar, “Beyond the Song Sequence”; Jhingan, “Lata Mangeshkar’s Voice in the Age of Cassette Reproduction”; Srivastava, “The Voice of the Nation”; Weidman, “Neoliberal Logics of Voice.”\n\n12. Chion, Audio-Vision, xxvi.\n\n13. These moments of apparent mismatch—as in the case of Usha Uthup and Falguni Pathak, singers I discuss elsewhere, whose voices belie their appearance—illuminate the audiovisual contract. They alert us to both the fact of its existence and the fact that it may be in the process of being revised. Sundar, “Usha Uthup and Her Husky, Heavy Voice”; Sundar, “The Queer Sound of the Dandiya Queen, Falguni Pathak.”\n\n14. Chion, Audio-Vision, 63 (original emphasis).\n\n15. While not all Hindi film songs are lip-synched, most of them have been produced using this system. It is only recently that the non-lip-synched song has gained prominence in Bollywood. I explore the implications of this shift in the final section of this chapter.\n\n16. The most Chion says about cultural specificity is the following: synchresis, he notes, is “also a function of meaning, and is organized according to gestaltist laws and contextual determinations.” This gesture to context is what I seek to elaborate here. Chion, Audio-Vision,Page 198 → 63. For a different, but compatible, use of Chion in analyzing playback singing in India, see Weidman, Brought to Life by the Voice, 8.\n\n17. Chion asks whether it is “an unseen actor [who] molds her diction to moving lips [so that] her voice is hitched to the image,” or whether it is the visible actor’s “body that molds itself to voice, [so that it is] the image that is constructed to match the sound.” Chion, The Voice in Cinema, 154.\n\nLagaan (Land Tax, dir. Ashutosh Gowariker, 2001) was hailed as an innovation. Booth, Behind the Curtain, 80. Tejaswini Ganti has written extensively on the practice of dubbing Hollywood films into Hindi. See, for instance, Ganti, “Creating That ‘Local Connect.’”\n\n19. For years, the person to emulate was Lata Mangeshkar. Such famous playback singers as Kavita Krishnamurthy, Anuradha Paudwal, and Alka Yagnik—who sings for the heroine in “Choli Ke Peeche,” a song I analyze later in this chapter—began their careers in this manner. Jhingan, “Lata Mangeshkar’s Voice in the Age of Cassette Reproduction.”\n\n20. Altman, “The Evolution of Sound Technology”; Booth, Behind the Curtain, 39.\n\nBhagya Chakra (Wheel of Fate, dir. Nitin Bose, 1935); the film was remade in Hindi later that year as Dhoop Chhaon (Sun and Shade).\n\n22. Indraganti, “Of ‘Ghosts’ and Singers.”\n\n23. On the emergence of “songless” films and the revised function of songs in new Bollywood cinema, see Garwood, “The Songless Bollywood Film”; Gopal, Conjugations.\n\n24. While my focus in this chapter is on the audiovisual contract in Hindi cinema, many of these clauses operate in other Indian cinemas as well.\n\n25. Fleeger, Mismatched Women.\n\n26. The notion that a singer’s voice is “mismatched” emerges most strongly when she sings. Thus, in many a case, the artist’s speaking voice preserves the “illusion” (of meekness or weakness, for example) that her voice unravels in the act of singing.\n\n27. Majumdar, “The Embodied Voice,” 167.\n\n28. This sound/image disjuncture is crucial in the case of the non-Tamil-speaking heroines of contemporary Tamil cinema. Nakassis, “A Tamil-Speaking Heroine.”\n\n29. Smith, “Black Faces, White Voices,” 37.\n\n30. Sundar, “Meri Awaaz Suno,” 149. Note the caste connotations of the word “cleansing.”\n\n31. Majumdar, “Beyond the Song Sequence,” 304. Walter Murch uses similar wording (“stretching”) to describe the “fruitful tension between what is on the screen and what is kindled in the mind of the audience” in his foreword to Chion’s Audio-Vision. Murch, foreword, xix.\n\n32. As noted above, Chion’s neologism “synchresis” is a combination of the words “synchronism” and “synthesis.” Chion, Audio-Vision, 63.\n\n33. Majumdar, “The Embodied Voice,” 175.\n\n34. Rosie Thomas makes this point powerfully in her early article on Mother India (dir. Page 199 →Mehboob Khan, 1957). Other scholars have done much to explicate how the dynamics of stardom shape film reception and interpretation. Consider, for instance, Vijay Mishra’s work on actor Amitabh Bachchan as a parallel text, and Neepa Majumdar’s book on stardom and early cinema culture in India. In the Hong Kong context, Brian Hu writes about the ways in which K-pop music cultures shape audiences’ engagement with music (and artists) in films. Thomas, “Sanctity and Scandal”; Mishra, Bollywood Cinema; Majumdar, Wanted Cultured Ladies Only!; Hu, “The KTV Aesthetic.”\n\n35. Genette, Paratexts; Gray, Show Sold Separately.\n\n36. Gray, Show Sold Separately, 7. Monika Mehta’s work on the many paratexts of Hindi cinema is extremely valuable; see her essays “DVD Compilations of Hindi Film Songs,” “Fan and Its Paratexts,” “Authorizing Gesture,” and “Analyzing Credit Sequences.”\n\n37. I mean “extra” in both senses of the word: external and additional. My implicit critique here is of Chion, who uses the term “added value” even as he challenges the notion that “sound is unnecessary, that sound merely duplicates a meaning which in reality it brings about, either all on its own or by discrepancies between it and the image.” Chion, Audio-Vision, 5–6.\n\n38. Majumdar, “The Embodied Voice,” 175.\n\n39. Chatterjee argues that the “women’s question” that had consumed social reformers in India in the mid- to late nineteenth century—the question, that is, of women’s position in a modern society—was resolved (or, more precisely, ignored) by twentieth-century nationalists, who conflated womanhood, spirituality, and tradition, relegating these matters to an inviolable “inner domain.” This discursive sleight hinged on imagining India in stark opposition to—and as morally, culturally, and spiritually superior to—the West. While I’m using Chatterjee’s framework to explain Hindi film’s gendered anxieties, it should be apparent that similar politics operate in other contexts. Scholars of early sound cinema in the United States have also discussed the gendered, ethnic, and racial politics of song dubbing. Chatterjee, “The Nationalist Resolution of the Women’s Question”; Smith, “Black Faces, White Voices”; Taylor, “Speaking Shadows.”\n\n40. See, in particular, Srivastava, “The Voice of the Nation,” 129–30, 139–40.\n\nTeesri Manzil (Third Floor, dir. Vijay Anand, 1966) is one of the more famous examples of this type of song. For an evocative discussion of how this number constructs a “music of body,” see Iyer, Dancing Women, 59–60. That Helen and the film characters she played were only ever known by their first names was another sign that they were disconnected from respectable family arrangements. In her analysis of Helen and other dancing women in Hindi cinema (and Indian mythology), Amita Nijhawan discusses another song from the same film, “O Haseena” (O Beautiful Woman). Nijhawan, “Excusing the Female Dancer.” See also Kasbekar, “Negotiating the Myth of the Female Ideal”; Gangoli, “Sexuality, Sensuality and Belonging,” esp. 148–49; Basu, “The Face That Launched a Thousand Ships.”\n\n42. Siefert, “Image/Music/Voice,” 47.\n\n43. Altman, “The Evolution of Sound Technology,” 47.\n\n44. An excellent discussion of how this process played out in South India may be found in Soneji, Unfinished Gestures.\n\nKarz (Debt, dir. Subhash Ghai, 1980) and Madhumati (dir. Bimal Roy, 1958). Chakravarty, National Identity in Indian Popular Cinema, 1947–1987.\n\n46. Weidman, “Anthropology and Voice.” 39.\n\n47. Weidman, Singing the Classical, Voicing the Modern.\n\n48. The prioritization of sound in Indian cinema is evident in the notion of “picturisation,” which in popular Indian parlance refers both to the process of filming a song sequence and to the audiovisual track of the song in the film. Gregory D. Booth observes that the term suggests “the priority of the song as a musical object, rather than as a visual object, since pre-existent songs are often picturised.” Likewise, for Neepa Majumdar, this term is indicative of the more general tendency of Hindi cinema to privilege the aural over the visual. Booth, “Religion, Gossip, Narrative Conventions,” 143n2; Majumdar, “The Embodied Voice,” 167.\n\n49. See, for example, Majumdar, “The Embodied Voice”; Srivastava, “The Voice of the Nation”; Sundar, “Meri Awaaz Suno.”\n\n50. The extent to which these moral qualities attached to the actors or the singers performing the song was a more complicated matter.\n\n51. For a rich history of how the growth of television and advertising industries in the 1990s (and MTV India, in particular) shaped film marketing, see Punathambekar, From Bombay to Bollywood, 79–111. I borrow the term “re-sounding” from Kate Lacey, who uses the term to chart transformations in (mediated) listening from the late nineteenth century to the present. Lacey, “Listening in the Digital Age,” 11.\n\n52. Manuel, Cassette Culture, 15.\n\n53. Booth, Behind the Curtain. Also note Sangita Gopal’s use of this term in Conjugations.\n\n54. Booth, Behind the Curtain, 76–77.\n\n55. Jyotika Virdi discusses the return of romance in the late 1980s and 1990s, but her focus is not the music of these films. Virdi, The Cinematic ImagiNation, 178–204.\n\n56. Thank you to Aswin Punathambekar for pushing me to develop this piece of my argument.\n\nantakshari (lit. last letter) is a game in which players flaunt their knowledge of Hindi film songs as they take turns singing songs that begin with the letter on which the previous player’s turn ended.\n\n58. On the ties between these shows and the Bollywood film industry, see Desai-Stephens, “Tensions of Musical Re-Animation.”\n\n59. Manuel, Cassette Culture.\n\n60. Kvetko, “Indipop,” 126.\n\n61. Booth, “That Bollywood Sound.”\n\n62. Chion, The Voice in Cinema, 172.\n\n“Dil Dhadke” ([My] Heart Beats) was meant to introduce the rest of the world to Indipop music. Speaking of the impact of that music video on his career, Page 201 →Sehgal noted that with his performances, “people started watching a singer on TV.” This set him apart from playback singers, who, in the main, were “back stage [and didn’t] come on television.” Quoted in Kvetko, “Indipop,” 187. Years later, in “Female Singers’ Adda,” Jonita Gandhi expressed equal enthusiasm for the visibility that YouTube provides contemporary singers: “And then you feel ownership on those million [views]. Like, this is my video! My face is in this video! Like, it’s such a nice feeling.” “Neeti Mohan, Neha Bhasin, Aditi Singh Sharma, Jonita Gandhi | Female Singers’ Adda.”\n\n64.

Purnima Mankekar maps the emergence of the “new Indian woman” in 1990s television narratives in Screening Culture, Viewing Politics.\n\n68. Made in India was a collaboration between Chinai and the composer and music producer Biddu (Biddu Appaiah). Recognized globally for his work with Carl Douglas on “Kung-Fu Fighting” (1974), Biddu is famous in India for “Disco Deewane” (Crazy for Disco, 1981), which also put the singer Nazia Hassan on the map. Biddu wrote and produced albums with several Indipop artists, including Shweta Shetty, Shaan, and Sagarika. For a thorough discussion of the “Made in India” video in the context of globalization and the expansion of satellite TV in India, see Kumar and Curtin, “Made in India.” Kvetko also discusses Chinai and the Made in India phenomenon; see Kvetko, “Indipop,” 159–78. For a discussion of Nazia Hassan’s work, see Jhingan, “Sonic Ruptures,” esp. 221–22.\n\n69. Kvetko, “Indipop,” 168. The emphasis on individual desire in these videos, whether for wealth, sex, or personal fulfillment, is also in keeping with the broader ideology of pop as a form of (bourgeois) self-expression. This argument is threaded through Kvetko, “Indipop,” but see in particular 237–51.\n\nRang De Basanti (Paint It Yellow, dir.

One might usefully compare Bhosle’s voicing of the vamp in cabaret songs to South Indian playback stars’ use of “effects,” a term that distinguishes moments of “voiced emotion, such as sighing, crying, or laughing, or voiced bodily reaction, such as swooning in delight or pain, hiccupping, and so forth” from the consistently “pure” timbre and style that singers used for most film songs.

Sawhney paraphrases how singer and music director Vishal Dadlani (of the Vishal-Shekhar team) conceives of singing voices cultivated in nonfilm contexts:\n\na female voice . . . is not always expected to supplement the male voice anymore. In other words, the female vocalists of an older era had no option but to sing on a high octave because their male counterparts kept it characteristically low. . . . As Page 204 →music producers became more and more flexible with the scale and texture of male vocals, and singers like Kay Kay and himself [Dadlani] arrived on the scene, who sang at a high pitch owing to backgrounds in rock ’n’ roll or Punjabi music, female playback singers found the space to explore the rawness of a folk song, the low tenor of a Sufi song or the rock interpretation of a love song.\n\nFor the moment, I must set aside Dadlani’s argument about the relationship between men’s and women’s voices in duets, as the study of men’s playback singing falls outside the scope of this chapter. Note, though, his assumption that singers’ training in nonfilm genres shaped how they approached film music, particularly the pitch in which they sang.\n\n107.

Whereas many singers of the past were strongly associated with particular actors—Mangeshkar was the voice of Nargis, and Mukesh that of Raj Kapoor—contemporary singers are not similarly paired with individual actors.\n\n130. As Tamil singer Anupamaa notes, “Nowadays we should be called playfront singers, not playback singers. We are not in the back anymore.” Quoted in Weidman, “Neoliberal Logics of Voice,” 182. This echoes Baba Sehgal’s comment about how (his) music videos changed expectations about the visibility of singers.\n\n131. The voice/body binary of yesteryear is further disrupted when actors do their own singing. While the Bombay film industry has not reverted to the singer-actor era of the 1930s and early 1940s, when stars did their own singing, there has been an increase in the number of actors who sing a song or two. Some playback singers have also tried their hand at acting in front of the camera. All in all, the strict division of labor between acting and singing that defined the Mangeshkar era has weakened.\n\n132. Gopal, Conjugations, 45.\n\n133.

In theorizing “listening publics,” Lacey reminds us of Walter Ong’s insight that “the inescapable collectivity suggested by the word ‘audience’ resides in its relation to sound and listening.” She also draws on Alice Rayner’s work on theatrical audiences, which conceives of the audience in intersubjective terms and places listening at its core. This harks back to the first OED definition of audience, which emphasizes hearing: the audience is an “assembly of listeners.” Lacey, 13–14.\n\nqawwali, which freely or loosely uses melodies based on Hindustani rags, as well as tunes associated in other contexts with Hindu occasions. . . . Hindu devotees and visitors are commonly estimated to constitute around one third of those who attend Chishti shrines, especially during ‘urs festivities when qawwali is featured. Further, Sufiana qawwali has traditionally accommodated Hindu performers.” Manuel’s observation reminds us that the “Islamicate” is a cultural category, more than a religious one. Even as the qawwali is a syncretic form and not a specifically Muslim one, it is strongly associated with the Islamicate. Manuel, “North Indian Sufi Popular Music,” 380.\n\n3.

For a fuller discussion of Pakistani artists’ “sonic genealogies” and careers in India, see Caldwell, “Songs from the Other Side,” 201–37 (on women’s voices), 238–83 (on men’s voices). The “first wave” of Pakistani voices in Hindi cinema was in the 1970s, and it was composed of all women (Runa Laila, Salma Agha, and Reshma). The “second wave,” which arrived in the 2000s, was composed entirely of men. Caldwell reads the 2016 ban as a cultural arm of the brinksmanship that the two nations engage in periodically. That Pakistani Page 212 →singers won most of the 2011 Filmfare awards might have contributed to the animosity toward them. While the ban dealt a significant blow, some of these singers’ Bollywood careers have recovered somewhat in the last few years. Caldwell, 248.\n\n138. Caldwell characterizes Pakistani singers in Bollywood as follows:\n\nqawwali and the rock province. Voices in the qawwali region, represented primarily by Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, tend to sound rooted in classical training, but with a “khulqawwali gāyakī. Voices in the rock region, like that of Atif Aslam, sound more rough-edged and untrained, but also more “hip.” The Pakistani rock sound, as heard in Indian film song, moves between the soft, crooning end of the spectrum to the hard, straining end.\n\nHe adds that Indian singers specializing in Sufi genres tend not to be misrecognized as Pakistani, even when their Sufipop vocal style is close to that of their Pakistani peers. Caldwell illustrates the difference between the vocal timbres (and styles) cultivated by Indian and Pakistani artists through an expert analysis of the song “Noor-e Khuda” (Light of God) from My Name Is Khan (dir. Karan Johar, 2009), featuring the singers Shankar Mahadevan and Adnan Sami. (The latter was a Pakistani citizen at time of this song’s release.) See Caldwell, 258, 240–48.\n\n139.

The long shots in “Maula Saleem Chisthi” similarly articulate the monumentality of its sacred location, the Ajmer Dargah. The song does not feature a hero as singer-poet; in fact, the qawwals are not visible at all, being cast in silhouette or in shadow. Finally, both qawwalis are montage sequences that have a pensive, documentary feel that fits conventions of the two social realist films.

Whereas jhankaar beats were added to new soundtracks, remixes typically took older, “classic” Hindi film songs as their starting point, “added faster beats, inserted new lyrics (usually in English) and gave [them] a new video form.” The addition of “beats” was important, for it cemented the notion that older film music was the site of melody. Duggal, 4; and see Beaster-Jones, “Evergreens to Remixes,” 433.\n\n173. Duggal, “The Hindi Film Song Remix,” 7. The binary opposition of melody and rhythm crumbles when we remember that the film songs that tended to be remixed were themselves associated with dance cultures. Duggal, 4. Thus, for instance, R. D. Burman songs often appeared in cover versions and remixes, including in Asha Bhosle’s Rahul and I (1996). The late 1990s and early 2000s is also heralded for the “return of melody,” particularly in the work of A. R. Rahman. In short, melody and rhythm do not map neatly onto the past and present. Still, the binary is a powerful and persistent one.\n\n174. Hijra is a socioreligious identity marker for certain trans women and intersex people.\n\n175.

It is worth pausing over Chow’s words: “Because the native speaker is thought to occupy an uncorrupted origination point, learning a language as a nonnative speaker can only be an exercise in woeful approximation. The failure to sound completely like the native speaker is thus given a pejorative name: ‘(foreign) accent.’ Having an accent is, in other words, the symptom precisely of discontinuity—an incomplete assimilation, a botched attempt at eliminating another tongue’s competing copresence. In geopolitical terms, having an accent is tantamount to leaving on display—rather than successfully covering up—the embarrassing evidence of one’s alien origins and migratory status. . . . The speech of the native speaker is deemed so natural that it is said to be without—or shall we say outside?—an accent.” Chow, Not like a Native Speaker, 58.\n\n9.

Two recent special issues mark this “regional” turn in Indian cinema studies: Srinivas, “Regional Cinemas of India” (BioScope, 2015); and Wani, “Region” (Studies in South Asian Film and Media, 2016). For a theoretical and historical delineation of the concept, see Radhakrishnan, “Region/Regional Cinema.” S. V. Srinivas develops the category of the “regional blockbuster” in “Rajinikanth and the ‘Regional Blockbuster.’” Monika Mehta and Madhuja Mukherjee develop “network” as an alternative for studying the dynamic exchanges and “shifting geographies” of the cinemas of India in their edited volume Industrial Networks and Cinemas of India. Francesca Orsini writes eloquently and prolifically on the importance of multilingual frameworks for the study of literature. See her essays “How to Do Multilingual Literary History?,” “The Multilingual Local in World Literature,” and “Na Hindu Na Turk.” Rita Kothari’s essays and edited work on translation politics in India are also invaluable; see, for example, Kothari, A Multilingual Nation.

For a longer discussion of how a plethora of languages mark cinematic production and distribution practices in India, particularly in South Indian film industries, see Sundar, “Language, Region and Cinema,” 27–31.

For example, John Mowitt uses the notion of “bilingual enunciation” to extend linguistic and psychoanalytic accounts of cinema, and query the foreignness of films designated as such. Hamid Naficy discerns in the work of exilic, diasporic, and postcolonial filmmakers an “accented style,” emerging from histories of dislocation, both personal and collective. I, too, am interested in how the movement of peoples shapes the language(s) and aural sensorium of a place. However, my focus is on language as sound, not on style in general. Mowitt, Re-Takes. Naficy, An Accented Cinema, 22. In their edited volume The Multilingual Screen (2016), Tijana Mamula and Lisa Patti train our attention on how multilingualism has shaped the history and aesthetics of cinema around the world well “beyond the soundtrack.” While this call for a renewed understanding of the relationship between multilingualism and cinema is an important and very welcome one, I contend there is still much more to be said about language as an audible element of cinema.\n\n21.

Chion devotes an entire monograph to writing made visible in cinema. Chion, Words on Screen.\n\n26. See, especially, Eidsheim, The Race of Sound, 1–37.\n\n27. My use of “deadly” here is a reference to the high stakes of linguistic nationalisms and to a (positive and superlative) turn of phrase commonly used in Indian English.\n\n28. Kozloff argues further that underlying such critiques of cinematic speech being “too much” is the popular association of talk with femininity and terseness with masculinity. Kozloff, Overhearing Film Dialogue, 6–7, 11.\n\n29. Kozloff, 18.\n\n30. Kozloff, 91. Kozloff’s first book, Invisible Storytellers, clarifies how voice-overs shape notions of time, space, authority, irony, and reliability in cinema, but it precludes discussion of how those voices sound. Her second monograph, Overhearing Film Dialogues, is keenly attuned to the performative dimensions of dialogue. Still, even this shift in topic and approach in Kozloff’s corpus is instructive. Both she and Chion (as well as other scholars who conceive of voice as “disembodied”) grant materiality to some kinds of speaking voices, but not others—to dialogue, but not to voice-overs. For a critique of Kozloff, see Garwood, The Sense of Film Narration, 102–3.\n\n31. Garwood, The Sense of Film Narration, 14.\n\nPage 217 →32.

Bate, Tamil Oratory and the Dravidian Aesthetic, xv. See also Bate, “Arumuga Navalar, Saivite Sermons, and the Delimitation of Religion, c. 1850”; Bate, “To Persuade Them into Speech and Action.” Bate’s important work casts Tamil oratory as a modern genre with roots in the mid-nineteenth century, when Arumuga Navalar used the form of the Protestant sermon in Saivite worship. Until this moment, such a public form of address—specifically a monologue by an individual of high status calling out to (and calling up) a large, mixed audience—had not been used in Tamil contexts, whether ritual, social, or political. He dates the extensive and systematic use of vernacular oratory for political ends to the early twentieth century, first in the Swadeshi movement (1905–8) and then, a decade later, in the Home Rule and labor movements (1917–19). By speaking in a widely understood tongue (Tamil, Telugu) and a fairly colloquial register, activists (particularly those in the labor movement) were able to speak to the concerns of ordinary people and cast themselves as one of them. Language thus broadened the reach of the intersecting political groups/movements beyond elite circles, cutting across caste and class divides. The cinematic entanglements and transformation of this speech genre into a more ornate, older-sounding form in the middle of the twentieth century is linked to the rise of Dravidianism, which effectively made oratory a fundamental feature of both cinema and mass politics in Tamilnadu. Amanda Weidman astutely notes that the institutionalization of the playback system and rise of Dravidian oratory in the 1940s and 1950s were not just contemporaneous developments; they both relied on voice amplification technologies—the microphone, in particular. Weidman, Brought to Life by the Voice, 4.\n\nPonmudi (dir. Ellis R. Dungan, 1950) and the song lyrics for Parasakthi (Goddess, dir. Krishnan-Panju, 1952).

Sundaram, 1950) and the dialogues in Parasakthi. Annadurai, Karunanidhi, and MGR (also Jayalalitha) would become some of the most influential of modern politicians in Tamilnadu.

The other protagonists of Sholay are also remembered for their relationship to speech. There is the laconic Jai (Amitabh Bachchan) and his love interest, Radha (Jaya Bhadhuri), who is traumatized into silence for much of the film. The desire for revenge also turns the feudal landlord and ex-cop Thakur Baldev Singh (Sanjeev Kumar) into a man of few words.

Chow, “The Writing Voice in Cinema.” By naming this particular use of the voice-over the “writing voice,” Chow historicizes the convention and links its cinematic usage to long-standing debates in literary studies, philosophy, and sound theory. She notes that Chion’s theorization of the voice in cinema—and the aurality of the medium itself—adds a material, tangible dimension to the interventions of theorists like Mikhail Bakhtin, Jacques Derrida, and Mladen Dolar, who have elaborated on “the internal rupture, disembodiment and nonoriginariness” of voice in more abstract and nonvisual terms. In framing Chion’s acousmêtre as coextensive of the way voice emerges in other cultural texts, Chow underscores a point often lost in film-centric discussions: “The voice is, on the one hand, always a sound effect, the materiality of which is inevitably entangled with the technicalities of film as a medium; on the other hand, the voice is inherently imaginary, always carrying a surplus of significance that defies its confinement to the cinematic apparatus.” Apprehending the complexity of voice in both its material and imaginary dimensions requires that we push beyond disciplinary borders. Chow, 21, 18.\n\n19. For Chion, it is precisely the fact that the speaker is unseen—that the voice seems to come from nobody and nowhere—that gives the acousmatic voice its power. The writing voice is an aural form that is at least partly visualized on screen (in the form of a letter); it is, by definition, both visual and aural. Chion, Audio-Vision, 71–73, 128–31.\n\n20.

This popular pastime, which became a successful television game show in the 1990s, involves players taking turns singing Hindi film songs; each song must begin with the letter (akshar) on which the previous player’s turn ended. Thus, while antakshari is typically thought of as a test of musical memory and fandom, it is in fact a sonic game, driven by the consonants that begin and end the opening refrain of film songs. To put it in the terms of chapter 3 of this book, antakshari (lit. last letter) conceives of both music and language as sound. Such aural and oral engagements with cinema are by no means a thing of the past. Think, for instance, of the bombastic citing of film dialogues in daily life, often laughed away as dialogue-baazi.1 Think of the ringtones and caller tunes people use to personalize their sonic identity on mobile phones; most of these musical refrains are culled from popular film soundtracks.2 Think also of #Kolaveri, the wildly popular Twitter hashtag that cited a viral film song in order to critique the Indian political establishment.3 Each of these examples illustrates what is well known about Indian film songs: they have a life of their own and circulate independently from the films for which they were initially composed. What is true of film songs is also true of other sonic fragments from films. They pervade everyday life and remind us that the pleasures and politics of cinema in India are aural, not simply visual.\n\nVote for Ghaghra” (Vote for Skirt) and “Bicchuda” (Scorpion), Arun presented herself as a brazen, pleasure-seeking woman. The distinctive coarseness of her voice, as well as her full-throated style, uninhibited vocal presence, and suggestive dance moves, earned her the title “Rani of Raunch” (Queen of Raunch).84 The sexual and ethnic otherness signaled by this pop journalistic label was heightened by Arun’s use of a rustic idiom in her songs. The language of the lyrics gave her voice a raw, earthy feel, a quality that signified not only rural India but also assertive sexuality. Arun’s first hit as a playback singer was “Morni Bagama” (Peahen in the Garden) from Lamhe (Moments, dir. Yash Chopra, 1991), but Page 49 →it was the notoriously popular “Choli Ke Peeche” (What’s behind the Blouse) from Khalnayak (Villain, dir. Subhash Ghai, 1993) that cemented her status as the quintessential “ethnic” voice in Hindi cinema.\n\nJumma Chumma De De” (Jumma, Give Me a Kiss) from Hum (Us, dir. Mukul Anand, 1991), are easily recognizable as item numbers. They are, to use Usha Iyer’s dance-centric terminology, “production numbers” that center dancers performing choreographed moves in a proscenium-like public setting.96 Others, such as “Kaante Nahi Katthe” ([Time] Passes Slowly) from Mr. India (dir. Shekhar Kapur, 1987) and “Dhak Dhak Karne Laga” (My Heart Goes Thump Thump) from Beta (Son, dir. Indra Kumar, 1992), are not item Page 54 →numbers per se. These production numbers were framed as (ostensibly) private fantasies of the hero and/or heroine. Yet, in all these songs, heroines danced as provocatively—and, in some cases, as publicly—as vamps did in earlier films.

M. Sadiq, 1960), and Mughal-e-Azam (dir. K. Asif, 1960) are among the most iconic examples of the genre. As we move away from the 1960s, however, qawwalis begin to appear more frequently in non-Islamicate contexts. Masala films of the late 1970s and early 1980s feature qawwalis as wedding and party entertainment; some songs take place in the villain’s den with a tawaif (courtesan) or a qawwali troupe performing for the brotherhood. In these later films, there is often little that is Islamicate other than the choice of musical genre and the look of the performers, who don “Muslim-style attire . . . [and gesticulate] in traditional shrine-qawwali style.”31 Irfan Zuberi and Natalie Sarrazin argue that from the 1970s onward, “devotion and zeal are re-packaged in rockstar-like movements” in the qawwali, so much so that by the turn of the millennium, the genre is disconnected “from its original roots, traditional decorum, or values.”32 While this is true to some extent, I want to carefully distinguish between Hindi cinema’s classic qawwalis and more recent iterations of the genre. As diverse as they are, classic qawwalis, featured in Hindi films from the 1940s to 1980s, are similar in the way they link sonic and visual markers of the Islamicate to romance and a secular listening public.\n\n30 The qawwalis in Barsaat Ki Raat (1960), Chaudhvin Ka Chand (Full Moon, dir.

For their part, Amaan and Shabnam are kept apart by her father, police commissioner Khan Bahadur (K. N. Singh), who considers Page 89 →the penniless poet a poor match for his daughter.

For now, suffice it to say that while not all films link love, listening, and the radio as powerfully as Barsaat Ki Raat does, the structure of feeling of its climactic qawwali (ishq ishq!) suffuses the genre and, indeed, permeates Hindi cinema of the 1950s and early 1960s.70\n\nqawwali performance.69 I explore the connections between the passionate listening formations of cinema/radio/the Hindi film song and qawwalis in more detail below.

From the earliest days of sound cinema in India, romantic duets functioned as “instrument[s] of Page 92 →couple-formation.”71 They cleared a sovereign space for the couple, keeping out (if momentarily) the narrative forces that threatened to block the lovers’ union. While classic qawwalis are akin to romantic duets in that they are philosophical paeans to romance, they do not isolate the couple in this manner. Instead, they call up an ideal collective in which to situate transgressive romantic relationships. Recall Amaan’s references to Laila-Majnoon, Radha-Krishna, and other iconic lovers in “Na To Caravan.” This intertextual strategy is one that Kumkum Sangari identifies as far back as medieval romances. In those stories as in the Barsaat Ki Raat qawwali, love is described via reference to legendary couples, conjuring a veritable “community” of lovers: “if love is an act of elective affinity, then these acts of connection [are] analogues or synonyms of love.” This intertextuality evinces not just a transhistorical conception of love but “the self-affiliating consciousness of lovers.”72 If, as Sangita Gopal argues, intimacy was the purview of the romantic duet in 1930s cinema, qawwalis of the mid- to late twentieth century imagined such intimacy unfolding in the company of others.73 In coupling romance and the collective, classic qawwalis rendered both love and listening as public endeavors.\n\nqawwalis of this period is not to claim that they are merely Islamicate love songs.
