Thus, some thesis and dissertation copies are in typewriter face, while others may be from any type of computer printer. The quality of this reproduction is dependent upon the quality of the copy submitted. Broken or indistinct print, colored or poor quality illustrations and photographs, print bleedthrough, substandard margins, and improper alignment can adversely affect reproduction. In the unlikely event that the author did not send UMI a complete manuscript and there are missing pages, these will be noted. Also, if unauthorized copyright material had to be removed, a note will indicate the deletion. Oversize materials (e.g., maps, drawings, charts) are reproduced by sectioning the original, beginning at the upper left-hand comer and continuing from left to right in equal sections with small overlaps. Each original is also photographed in one exposure and is included in reduced form at the back of the book. Photographs included in the original manuscript have been reproduced xerographically in this copy. Higher quality 6” x 9” black and white photographic prints are available for any photographs or illustrations appearing in this copy for an additional charge. Contact UMI directly to order.

During this period, the concept of Sound Design has proven mutable, metaphoric, and elusive, transforming from an experimental movement to a model of production and understanding. This dissertation traces its transformation by examining the intersection of cultural, technological and generic influences on the film soundtrack— from the rise of the French New Wave to the introduction of Dolby Stereo. Of particular interest, though, is how the science fiction genre has informed and mediated Sound Design. To highlight these influences, this study offers close textual examinations of a number of seminal science fiction films, including 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), THX 1138 (1971), Star Wars (1977), Alien (1979), Blade Runner (1982, Director's Cut 1992) and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991).

V (dialogue/masic/effects, editing and re-recording) to render a unique understanding of planning and patterns of the contemporary film sound track and the mental project that results from its deployment. Ultimately, technical, historical and theoretical discourses converge to offer new insights into the constructed nature of film sound and a new direction in sound criticism, which can be applied to any film or genre.

INTRODUCTION 1 In the 1993 film Jurassic Parkr Dr. Ian Malcolm (played by Jeff Goldblum) lies injured in a jeep as a genetically engineered T-Rex approaches through the darkness of a thick jungle. The thunderous footfalls of the creature at a distance shake the ground and reverberate in low rumbles. Tiny ripples break the smooth surface of a pool of water collected in a muddy dinosaur footprint nearby. The shaking and the size of the footprint foreshadow the imminent danger. Malcolm tries to contain his fear by saying: \"Anybody hear that? That's a um. ..that's an impact tremor is what it is. I'm fairly alarmed here.\" In a properly aligned motion picture theater, equipped with a Digital Theater [Sound] System (DTS), the \"impact tremors\" fill the entire exhibition space, sending vibrations outward, immersing the character and the filmgoers in a jeep, in the jungle, alone. The moment represents a pinnacle in blockbuster cinema and film sound. Cleverly, the scene plays on science fiction-horror conventions by denying a clear visual referent of the dinosaur, heightening anxiety by hiding the creature in the sound effects; the construction of the scene also spatializes the depths of the two dimensional screen through a multichannel signal packed with reverberation and delay; and finally, the digital medium delivers the sound Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 2 with greater fidelity and dynamic range than any format prior to this point, solidifying the film's status as both cinematic and technological spectacle. Taken as a whole, the convergence of these factors is truly \"alarming.\" In the traditional ontological analysis of sound, the presiding analogy is that of a stone skipped into a pond of water, which produces ripples that radiate, reflect and dissipate. This analogy of the nature of sound waves emerges repeatedly throughout Jurassic Park in cups of water and in muddied footprints as in the scene with the T- Rex. But is this the whole story? Given the rapid advances in sound technology and sound application within contemporary cinema, it is time to expand this analogy to include the air above the water, the thermoclines below, and the conditions under which the water was set in motion. The convergence of these factors can lead to a greater understanding of the entire system of sound which has come to dominate Hollywood cinema, specifically the movement and model known as Sound Design. Clearly film sound has reached a critical juncture as has sound theory and criticism. Over the past three decades, sound technologies and production have fundamentally changed Hollywood cinema and the filmgoing experience. But is the audience listening? The intent of this study is to examine and expose the complex weave of Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 3 technical and aesthetic factors known as sound design and contextualize them within history, culture and genre. The aims here are threefold. First, this work will re­ evaluate contemporary film history with a bias toward sound rather than the image. Industrial events such as the breakup of the studio system, the rise of film schools (and the generation of filmmakers it spawned), and the introduction of portable technologies will be re-examined to understand their impact on the film sound track. Secondly, I will examine the formal elements (dialogue, music and effects) and processes (editing and re-recording) of sound design, as a means of exposing the highly constructed nature of the sound track. This detailed approach is a means of dispelling the notion that film sound is simply a matter of capture or copying. In addition, this approach will assist in building a vocabulary of analysis which bridges the gap between production and theory. Finally, this project will examine how genre, particularly the science fiction genre, has fused with sound design to mediate changes in reading codes and meaning production, while redefining audience expectations in contemporary cinema. It is my hope that this study will help film scholars and filmmakers alike in navigating the complexity of film sound as it addresses the patterns of sound conceptualization, construction and design.

Subsequently, this study takes a multi- discursive approach, incorporating historical analysis, cultural studies, formal analysis, and genre studies. The key instrument of analysis is the close textual analysis of specific sound tracks in terms of key elements and processes and their relation to narrative, genre, and reception. Historically, the study covers cinematic sound from the late 1960s to the early 1990s and engages seminal science fiction texts from this period, including: 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), THX 1138 (1971), Star Wars (1977), Allen (1979), Blade Runner (1982, 1992), and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). But why examine only this time period and only these films? Following the breakup of the studio system, the audio and sound industries experienced an explosion of growth in both the aesthetic and technical fields. The music industry transformed and unified a new generation of youth with Rock and Roll and stereo broadcasting. The stereo babies had arrived, and some of these audiophiles went on to become the \"Movie Brats.\"1 Consumer sound technology also became portable and went Hi Fi. Film sound followed as Dolby Noise Reduction moved out of the labs and into theaters; recording equipment became more portable (and thus more useful in sound experimentation); and sound personnel took Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

This genre of the fantastic suddenly became the new arena for cinematic play and spectacle, following the release of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Genre and sound design converged, and thus the films that are utilized in this study represent not simply eloquent examples of sound processes and practices, but also key contributors to the development of sound design. In terms of reception, the \"New Hollywood\" (as defined by Thomas Schatz) clearly created new types of film texts and cinematic experiences. 2 it is essential to understand then that the output from this period created new spectators as well. With the ready availability of film texts and production information on the Web and in fan publications, contemporary filmgoers are aggressively attentive to all aspects of filmmaking, which makes them demanding as well. Film sound has challenged and confirmed audience expectations, offering some of the most complex weaves of sound effects, music and dialogue that have ever been attempted. Contemporary soundtracks have thus exploded in privilege and status. In this respect, it is an exciting time for film sound and critical discourse. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 6 This study attempts to bring together the multiplicity of these factors to render a unique understanding of the planning and patterns of the contemporary film sound track and the mental project that results from its deployment. Ultimately, technical, historical, and theoretical discourses converge to offer new insights into the constructed nature of the film soundtrack and a new direction in sound criticism. For the most part, this study bypasses traditional sound theory primarily because it does not envision the complex production capabilities of the modern dubbing stage or the use of multichannel sound formats, but rather focuses on realism and all too often the \"need\" for sound. As Amy Lawrence and many others have noted, classical theory has facilitated a pattern of \"attack and neglect\" which overlooks or \"naturalizes\" issues of technology and the mode of sound production.3 Fortunately, contemporary sound theory proves far more useful and insightful. After 60 years of neglect, sound is no longer marginalized. In two influential works Yale French Studies 60 (1980) and Sound Theory/Sound Practice (1992), sound theorist Rick Altman brings together various essays which address sound history, sound theory and music, and he opens up a significant dialogue in film sound discourse.4 in particular, Mary Anne Doane's article, \"The Voice in the Cinema: The Articulation of Body and Space,\" spatializes Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. the deployment of sound in its relation to the diegesis (or story world), screen space and the exhibition environment as it is unified by the conceptual body of the film and the body of the characters within.5 Her article is grounded in a psychoanalytic model, and it foreshadows her subsequent work on sound and ideology. It, therefore, provided a solid foundation for my exploration into surround sound and sound mixing. Rick Altman's essays provided a solid foundation for this study by addressing sound deployment and technology, particularly in examining sound not as \"capture” but as \"event\".6 In addition to these works, Kaja Silverman expanded the inter-relation of the psychoanalytical model with sound studies in her seminal text The Acoustic Mirror (1988)7, and Amy Lawrence’s Echo and Narcissus— Women 's Voices In Classical Hollywood Cinema provided an excellent model of analysis, incorporating close textual analysis of dialogue and the voice in relation to Feminist Theory.8 The clarity and insight of Lawrence' s line of argument served as a powerful guide for this study. In examining historical and technological discourse, John Belton's work entitled \"1950s Magnetic Sound: The Frozen Revolution\" was essential in developing my own argument on multichannel and artifice in contemporary cinema. ^ with these scholars and other such as Alan Williams, Michel Chion, and Elizabeth Weis, the range of film sound scholarship in general expands its reach in Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. new directions, challenging the cannon of image dominated discourse.10 Adding to this discourse is Sound Design and Science Fiction, which pushes film sound scholarship to the next logical step by bringing together sound theory, process, technology and practice as a means of offering a unified model of analysis. The intent is to bridge the gap between the various channels of discourse and to build a common understanding. Importantly, this work unifies these streams within a genre context, specifically science fiction cinema. In this layered mix, genre functions as a key mediator and method. One of the strengths of science fiction has always been its ability to displace concepts into different times and spaces to offer criticisms and critiques. This work attempts to do the same. Genre examples also offer a specificity when dealing with various sound concepts, which car at times be elusive in their abstract forms and applications. Within this model, then, a multitude of literature (and data) beyond sound theory became essential in informing the line of argument. In particular, technical works, historical chronologies, primary interviews and actual production practice contributed greatly to the breadth of this study. Within the field of production literature, Vincent LoBrutto's Sound-On-Film, a collection of interviews with sound personnel, proved essential as it Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 9 explored production practices as related to specific films, technology and genres. H This body of interviews stands in sharp contrast to the past studio publicity on Hollywood sound from Warner Bros, and others, which seemed only to mystify the processes as a means of hiding the \"magic.” Within LoBrutto *s interviews, contemporary sound practitioners are much less constrained, partly because sound methods and technology have become such a key selling point for films today. Practitioners like Walter Murch, Ben Burtt and Gary Rydstrom have been eloquent in their analysis and analogies in describing what they do. Their contributions (directly and indirectly) have been immeasurable. I was fortunate enough to attend lectures and book signings by two of these individuals to gather additional information and ask follow up questions related to sound d e s i g n . 12 The work of all three of these individuals represents the art of film sound at its best. In terms of primary research, one of the most valuable experiences for gathering data proved to be a 16 week seminar offered at Todd AO Glen Glen Sound Studios in Hollywood, California, under the direction of sound effects editor John Haeny. During this period, a small group of students and I followed several film and television projects through the entire process of sound post production. I was pleasantly surprised to find that practitioners of post production sound were as attentive Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 10 and devoted to cinematic analysis as the best film scholar. Their insights into the \"quiet\" work of sound are woven into the tapestry of my argument. In addition to this primary research, technological works created a scientific foundation for this study. Tomlinson Holman's Sound for Film and Television as well as his various articles and lectures directed this study from the very beginning— so much so that I recommend his text as a necessary compendium to this study.13 Lastly, corporate websites including those for the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA), Dolby Labs, Lucasfilm, Kudelski S.A. (manufacturer of the Nagra tape recorder), and others offered timelines of product development, insights into production methods, and a host of various technical specifications for sound equipment.Within these lines of discourse, the linkages between theory and practice were forged. The final essential component in formulating this model of analysis was the contribution of genre cinema and genre studies, specifically related to science fiction and the fantastic. Since the 1960s, science fiction cinema has re-defined cinematic spectacle with the release of films from 2001: A Space Odyssey to Terminator 2: Judgment Day. These films have recalibrated not just the aesthetics of film sound but the technology of sound as well. Filmmakers such as Stanley Kubrick, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott, and James Cameron have often sought to employ Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The implementation of Dolby Stereo with the release of Star Wars is an excellent example of this trend, and it appears new developments may once again find their way into theaters with the release of the forthcoming prequels. These filmmakers and their speculative narratives have also pushed the boundaries of film aesthetics, particularly sound design, into the unexplored realms of the fantastic with some regularity. Most importantly, these films dislocate and experiment with sound codes and strategies, offering excellent examples of the true range of sound design. In light of these new cinematic texts, genre studies have been forced to move beyond simple categorization and definition in order to address issues of humanity, technology, and gender as well their cultural and stylistic implications. Of particular use was Vivian Sobchack's Screening Space— The American Science Fiction Film (1987), which tracks the genre and its transformations across various time frames, including the recent blockbuster era. From her insights on \"affect\" through \"special effects,\" I build my argument for film sound as spectacle. ^ Concurrently, I drew from works such as Scott Bukatman’s Terminal Identity to explore science fiction subjectivity; Donna Haraway's \"A Manifesto for Cyborgs Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 12 and Linda Williams \"Film Bodies: Gender, Genre and Excess\" for insights into the connection between the body and t e c h n o l o g y ; 18 ancj Tzvetan Todorov's The Fantastic as a resource into how filmgoers engage the mode of the Fantastic, emotionally and intellectually.18 case studies, in particular, Jerome Agel's The Making of Kubrick's 2001 and Paul M. Sammon’s Future Noirz The Making of Blade Runner, also proved essential in establishing the stylistic conceits and construction methods of the various science fiction f i l m s . 20 From the diversity of this discourse, the mutability and adaptability of science fiction studies is evident, which is clearly one of its strengths. For this reason, a single unified plan for science fiction analysis is not the intent here, rather this work offers speculations on the possibilities of genre and genre studies in general. In connecting genre with sound, I hope to allow filmgoers to understand that cinema has utilized its medium and materials as eloquently as literature has used words. While the stories of science fiction cinema are often not as compelling as those in literature, their construction and strategies are as intricate and inspiring. Within the convergence of these methods and discourses, an integrated model of analysis emerges. The structure of the line of argument presented here is simple. Each of the six parts, except for one, is divided into two Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 13 parts. The initial chapters of each part contain historical or theoretical analysis, while compendium chapters offer case studies of specific films or technology. Part V is the only exception to this pattern; instead it presents a comparison and contrast between the two releases of Blade Runner in 1982 and 1992 respectively. The case studies are based on culturally and technically important texts, which at first appearance may seem all too familiar. However, if we move beyond the visuals and narrative conceits, an entirely new perspective on these works can be heard in terms of their sound design. In general, this collection of films attests the fluidity and diversity of the science fiction genre, which is continually revitalized and re­ invented with the introduction of new technologies, new techniques and new narrative strategies. As for specific usage, each film will be employed to examine a particular aspect of film sound, including music, editing, effects, Foley, ambiences, the voice, and finally, the mix process. Placement of these films is not by importance but rather they are organized chronologically and according to the method that best suits the overall model of analysis. The intent is to present a comprehensive analysis of an integrated sound design across a body of films. In short, I will engage in a meta-analysis which cuts across three decades of science fiction filmmaking and offers a complete analysis of the film sound track. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 14 In Part I, I focus on the origins and influences on sound design. Like 2001: A Space Odyssey which traces the development and evolution of mankind, this first chapter unearths the industrial, cultural and technological catalysts which trigger this new phase in film sound. In addition, the case study of 2001: A Space Odyssey will address film music and speculation- Within the unexpected juxtaposition of various pre-recorded classical and avant garde musical works and Kubrick's stunning visual imagery of the future, the image-sound relations of this epic science fiction film became charged with speculative possibilities, not simply about the future, but about the nature of film sound. Part II traces the influence of these speculations as related to sound effects and \"Sound Montage,\" which came about through a convergence of new sensibilities from filmmakers working within the New Hollywood and the French New Wave. Through formal experimentation with image and sound, this new generation of filmmakers sought to re­ vitalize and re—invent the \"old Hollywood\" as something vibrant and \"new.\" I will argue that essential to this process is the genre of science fiction, which allows and encourages experimentation with new techniques and technology. Supporting this argument is a case study of George Lucas's first feature film THX 1138, which offers one of the most complex weaves of sound planning and Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 15 patterns in contemporary film. It is an under-rated sound track that challenges the film's innovative images at every turn and ultimately, hints at the future of sound design. Part III continues with this dialogue in terms of the Lucas legacy with an exploration of Ben Burtt’s work on Star Wars. Within this section, I focus on the two distinctions in sound design, specifically addressing the design of individual effects as well as the designing of sound for the theatrical exhibition space. In chapter 5, I will vigorously challenge the notion of sound as simple capture by unmasking the strategies and techniques of sound design. In the compendium case study presented in chapter 6, I deal directly with multichannel presentation, particularly the format of Dolby Stereo, and its relation to reading codes, science fiction and spectacle. Part IV expands the reach of sound design with an examination of the elements of ambience, Foley and general sound effects and their relation to the fantastic, particularly the genres of horror and science fiction. In the convergence of genres, I will argue that an exchange of codes, strategies and considerations occurs, infusing these sound with new privilege and status. In support of this argument, I present a case study of Ridley Scott's science fiction-horror masterpiece Alien, specifically addressing the stylistic conceit of the film (the merging of the Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 16 organic and technological) and its interpenetration into the \"realistic\" effects of the sound design. Part V continues with this meta analysis of sound design by offering a close textual analysis of another Ridley Scott film, Blade Runner, which I will argue is actually two distinctly different films, due to revision to the sound design and multiple release strategy. Through an extended comparison and contrast between the two versions of Blade Runner, the original 1982 theatrical release (with the voice-over) and the subsequent 1992 Director' s Cut (without the voice-over), I will deal exclusively with issues of the voice, examining its connection to narrative authority, subjectivity and cinematic spectacle. In this analysis, I will unpack the highly constructed nature of the voice in cinema and expose its influential yet tenuous position within this science fiction narrative and the model of sound design. In Part VI, this comprehensive model of sound design is brought together through an examination of the processes of re-recording and the final sound mix. In addressing the composite nature of the sound track, I will deconstruct the \"work\" of the overall sound design as related to sound mixing to unmask the forces which stabilize and balance the various formal elements and narrative intents. Countering this balance, however, I find equally powerful forces which threaten to rupture and expose this work. It is within this Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 17 tension that the paradox of the film sound mix emerges, and the usefulness of genre as mediator is explored. Finally in chapter 11, a case study of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, which is considered by many to be the best mixed film in contemporary cinema, will draw together the many issues of sound design previously explored (from sound effects creation to issues of the voice) and relate them to the mutable and metaphoric genre of science fiction. As the culmination to this study, it is my hope that it demonstrates not only a unified analysis of a particular sound design, but also a method that can be applied to any film or genre.

As with the science fiction genre, the problem with sound design is that it is difficult to frame and define. With the introduction of each new recording technology and technique, the meaning and conception of sound design seem to shift. Within the period of this study from the late 1960s to early 1990s, sound design transformed dramatically from an aesthetic movement seeking to explore film form in new ways to a new model of conceptualizing and constructing film sound. So rather than essentialize the term sound design, this chapter will examine the various historical, technical and cultural layers that inform it— from the fragmentation of the Hollywood Studio System to the rise of the new generation of recording technologies and technicians. This analysis will lead me to reconceptualize recent cinematic history with a bias toward sound rather than image. As a result, chapter 2 will focus specifically on film music. While film music has always been part of the cinematic sound model, even within the silent era, today's science fiction film music tends to be far more aggressive and conceptual than Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 19 ever before. In 1968, long before anyone spoke of \"sound design\", 2001: A Space Odyssey demonstrated that image- sound relations could transcend the traditional music and image model, thereby launching the transformation of the film soundtrack into a new era. As with many artistic movements and models, descriptions and definitions usually come after the fact. Initially, the term sound design arose in the San Francisco Bay Area during the production of Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, the 1979 Vietnam war film based on Joseph Conrad's The Heart of Darkness. The story follows an army Captain (played by Martin Sheen) into the Cambodian jungles in his mission to assassinate a much decorated Colonel (Marlon Brando) who has gone insane. Cinematically, the film weaves one of the most complex mixtures of dialogue, music and effects in contemporary cinema, skillfully merging multichannel technology and immersive sound with images of war and spectacle. Walter Murch, sound editor and mixer on the film, applied the term sound design to Apocalypse Now primarily because the film employed dense layers of sounds within the 70mm widescreen format to create an immersive effect in theaters. In specific roadshow venues, the multichannel theater array consisted of six channels of sound, specifically left, center, right, left surround, right surround and a low frequency subwoofer channel, which were managed by a Dolby decoder and a Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 20 surround sound adapter.1 The configuration was a precursor to many of the multi-channel digital formats found in theaters today. For Murch, the multichannel format entailed planning and deploying film sound within the speakers and the theater environment in terms of frequency, separation and spatial quadrants.2 He notes: I had a detailed mapping out of the sound effects and the music on paper— where each of them would be in mono, where each of them would be in simple stereo, where each of them would use full quadraphonic sound...that’s actually where the concept of sound design came from.3 During the \"Ride of the Valkyries\" (Wagner) helicopter attack on the Vietnamese village, hundreds of sound components from helicopter rotor blades to munitions blasted into the theater. Murch broke down the sounds as if they were music to be played by different sections of an orchestra in different areas of the theater. He notes: We would think of each one of those groupings [sounds of AK-47s, M-16s, Mortars, etc.] in the way a conductor would think of the various groupings in an orchestra— from the most dominant to the least. A conductor might ask himself, 'Where is most of the sound coming from, and what group of instruments is carrying the main melodic line?'4 The sound design for the scene placed filmgoers in the helicopter with all its radio cross chatter and weapon's cross-fire, surrounding them in the sound mixture and Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Additionally, the music in the scene moved swiftly and smoothly between synchronized source music within the diegesis to full, non-diegetic score, and thus the music blocking with the images of the attack created a cinematic spectacle which forever changed the cultural and historical associations of the Wagner piece, much the same way that Stanley Kubrick had altered the image-sound associations of The Blue Danube in 2001: A Space Odyssey and of Slngin' In the Rain and Beethoven's 5th in A Clockwork Orange. The unexpected juxtaposition of the music with the images and the slippage between source and score demanded a re-thinking of traditional image-sound relations away from coded \"realism\" toward a surrealist \"jolt\". Sound and music functioned not just as sonic wallpaper but as a significant factor in generating meaning and emotive effect. In this case, the image-sound spectacle reveals the insanity of the Vietnam war and comments on colonialism through coercion with stirring and ironic bravado. In creating this scene for the multichannel theater system, Murch saw his work on the soundtrack as akin to that of a production designer, but instead of hanging set dressing, he was \"hanging\" sound. Hence, the term sound design emerged in its initial configuration. Murch's ties to sound design, however, extend to an earlier incarnation that he called \"Sound Montage,\" which was his credit on Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. George Lucas’s first science fiction feature THX 1138 (1971). Utilizing extensive countrapuntal editing and overdubbing, Murch experimented with sound perspective, speed modulation, filters and cinematic-sound metaphor throughout the film. His work reveals a constant tension between musicality and functionality within the genre of science fiction— a tension that will be explored in greater detail in the next chapter. The techniques and overall aesthetic approach that he developed on THX 1138 would extend into Murch's subsequent work from American Graffiti (1973) to The English Patient (1996), thus transforming the soundscape of American cinema. Most notably, Murch embraced experimental \"sound montages\" in The Conversation (1974), another Coppola film which called attention to sound recording as it unraveled the life of professional eavesdropper Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) and his link to a corporate killing. Like 2001, the film combined international art cinema techniques not just on the visual level with its blue hues and chilling compositions but on the sound level as well. The constant re-evaluation of a single recording of two characters in a park exposes the unstable, subjective and constructed nature of image-sound relations. The most important revelation of the film comes in the emphasis of a single word: \"He'd kill us if he had the chance.\" The emphasis on the word implicates the couple, whom we previously believed Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 23 were victims, as co-conspirators in the murder of an industrialist. For Murch and his generation, film sound moved beyond realistic mimicry into sonic artistry, cinematic deconstruction and self-ref lexive evaluation. Since Apocalypse Now, sound design has become somewhat controversial in Hollywood production circles particularly when sound recordists and editors appropriated the term \"sound designer\" or were labeled as such by the popular press. Most notably, Ben Burtt inherited the title for his work on Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Return of the Jedi (1983). Each of these films featured the unusual sounds of laser-gun blasts, spaceship rumbles, and a host of computer noises and alien languages. Many of these sounds have since become sound icons in popular culture, particularly the data chatter and whistles of R2- D2 and the shimmering oscillations of the Jedi light saber. In part, they have formed a lexicon of sound designs utilized in a host of Lucas film ancillary products from CD ROMs to computer screen savers, reaching far beyond the borders of cinema. In collecting and creating the sounds for the film series, Burtt conflated the traditionally separate duties of recordist, editor and mixer. This collapse of traditional union and departmental designations caused the most concern in Hollywood. Within the traditional studio model, a Sound Supervisor selected sounds from the studio sound library and delegated the Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 24 editorial and mixing duties to assistants or departments. Subsequently, the final creation of sounds may not have occurred until the final mix. Sound designers challenged this methodology and in doing so gained more control over the diversity and application of sound effects. Jurisdictional tensions were inevitable. Additionally, sound effects now are often in competition with the once dominant aspects of the soundtrack, specifically dialogue and music. Composers in particular saw this emergence of the sound designer as a threat to their artistic contribution to the soundtrack. Read any interview with a composer and you will find laments to this effect. As a production position designation, the term sound designer applies then to production personnel who create specific sound effects, and also to those individuals who supervise the construction of the entire soundtrack during the post production process. The latter position is akin to the Sound Director, a position that arose during the transition to sound and required a balanced technical and aesthetic expertise in the recording process. The separation and distinction is by no means absolute, however. Most sound designers move between these two ends or conflait them depending on the various needs of the production they are working on at that time. For instance, by the time Return of the Jedi was produced in 1983, Ben Burtt was both creating innovative effects for the film as Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 25 well as serving as one of the principle mixers and architects of the overall sound track. Currently, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences does not recognize the term \"sound designer\" for its awards process, nor do the Hollywood sound or editorial unions list the position among their rosters. Jurisdictional battles over duties, responsibility, and most importantly screen credit have prevented the adoption of the term into these formal circles. Recently, though, Gary Rydstrom (Toy Story, Jurassic Park) and others have taken sound design as a credit on screen but have made sure also to take credit for their actual technical designations, such as mixer or sound editor. By taking multiple credits, a sound designer is assured a place at the podium during the Academy Awards ceremonies. Aptly, Bill Varney, longtime Sound Supervisor at Samuel Goldwyn Studios and later at Universal, views the position designation and the broader conception of sound design with skepticism: I don't think that any one individual designs a sound track. It would be nice to think that someone sits down and has a very concise idea, from the beginning of reel one to the very end of the movie. But all these things get compromised.5 The resistance to the designation reveals a tension within the field of sound production over whether film sound Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 26 should be viewed as a craft or as artistry. \"Good Sound” has traditionally meant clarity and fidelity in capture, particularly in the recording of music and the voice. Within the studio system, sound was equated with recording and \"realism,\" but sound designers emphasize that film sound is a conception and construction. For a sound designer, capture and fidelity are only tools and techniques for creating an integrated tapestry of sound, which is attentive to larger considerations such as space, spectacle, metaphor and thematic motif among others. Interestingly, the tension mirrors the progression and discord within the critical and historical discourse on sound between realism and formalism. Bazin would have been old school, Eisenstein new school. None-the-less, popular discourse rapidly appropriated the term sound design after its introduction and extended its meaning even further, conflating all aspects of film sound into the meaning including the formal elements of the film sound track— dialogue, music and effects— as well as production and reception issues. The term thus became descriptive of a style of sound within the blockbuster tradition of the \"New Hollywood\" with hardwired connections to technology, production practices, and new expectations about sound delivery and reception. For audiences and sound personnel alike, it has become a model of understanding and containing film sound within contemporary cinema. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 27 The term even integrated itself institutionally into many university film programs and has subsequently become a methodology of studying and teaching film sound production. At the University of Southern California, Sound Professor Tomlinson Holman who is also the inventor of THX Sound describes sound design as: \"Getting the right sound in the right place at the right time with the equipment available.\"6 Embedded in this definition is the ever expanding range of historical, technical and theoretical issues of contemporary film sound. The \"right sound\" is encoded with factors such as the history of sound effects, canons of taste, narrative requirements, and sound perspective. The \"right place\" and \"right time\" refer to the codes and conventions of sound-image editing as well as the pragmatics of mixing and presentation. The \"equipment available\" places the practice within economic and technical parameters. As is evident, the term sound design is far from static, rather it continues to evolve with different influences and contexts from production to academia. For this study, however, the overall model will proceed from a conception of sound design as the planning and patterns of the film sound track (which infers analysis of ideology, production practices and technology) and the mental project which results from its deployment. Embedded in this model is a complex weave of film history, production methods, and Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

To unravel the foundations of sound design, it first becomes necessary to re-examine familiar histories, technologies and cultural movements not simply with our eyes, but with our ears. The remainder of this section will unravel the foundations of sound design by casting itself back to the late 1940s to the breakup of the studio system and forward to 2001, when the dawn of a new era in sound raised a new set of questions that cinema is still trying to answer. Sounding Off on History, Technology and Culture Although the story of divestiture is by now well known, what is far less familiar is its impact on film sound. In May of 1948, the Supreme Court concluded the Consent Decree case, which was brought by independent theater chains against the Hollywood Studios.7 Effectively, the resolution of the case ended the vertical integration of major film studios in Hollywood, the dominant production and distribution system within the industry. The court deemed that this system constituted a monopoly and was in violation of anti-trust laws. The studios were required to divest their theater chains, discontinue the practices of blind selling and block booking. The \"Consent Decree\" would prove one of the key catalysts in the decline of the Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 29 Hollywood studio system as theaters were divested over the next decade. Divestiture had serious consequences for film sound. In terms of theater presentation, the quality of sound reproduction declined radically. When the studios owned the theaters, technical advances could be implemented during the production process with assurances that the theater environment would be able to handle the advance. It can be argued that speaker technology and noise reduction may have advanced much faster if the studios had not been required to divest. Studios like Fox did attempt to exert some control over sound reproduction by releasing films only in specific formats, which would require retrofitting theaters with new sound technology. Theater chains, however, vigorously resisted, petitioning studios to release their wide screen films in traditional optical formats as well as the newer multi-channel magnetic formats. A memo from Chairman of the Allied States Association of Motion Picture exhibitors to Warner Bros, clarifies the dilemma: I do not need to tell you that unless prints of Cinemascope pictures containing one-track sound are made available to thousands of theaters that simply cannot afford the full stereophonic equipment, their situation will be tragic. As you know, there is a violent difference of opinion in the industry as to whether the stereophonic sound adds anything to the enjoyment of the picture. Certainly, there is no Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 30 need for it in medium and small theaters.® The theater chains prevailed in this instance and throughout the decade in limiting the implementation of new sound technology to road show engagements and spectacle films. The implementation of multichannel formats, however, did receive a significant boost with the development of Dolby Stereo, a format which effectively integrated with existing presentation technology. Only recently though have independent sound houses like Skywalker Ranch (a division of Lucasfilm) and the major studios attempted to re-assert some measure of standards and practices on film sound reproduction by experimenting with THX Sound Systems and implementation of the Theater Alignment Program (TAP). In the push toward better theatrical sound presentation, sound reproduction, separation and localization are optimized by these technologies and standards, and as a result, sound quality has become a significant factor in the economics of theater patronage. According to the Lucasfilm website, THX theaters report higher revenues of \"up to 25%\" over non THX theaters.9 The audience is in fact \"listening\" and demanding better sound reproduction from local theaters. This demand was in part faciliated by theaters beginning to advertise their sound systems and sound formats through trailers and poster art beginning in the mid 1980s. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 31 In the 1960s, corporate conglomerates began acquiring film studios, causing the further breakup of the studio system and facilitating the dominance of the independent production and the \"producer unit\" and \"package unit\" system, best exemplified by the films of Alfred Hitchcock such as North by Northwest (1959). 10 In 1966, Gulf and Western acquired Paramount Studios; Kinney National Services bought Warner Bros, in 1969; while TransAmerica purchased United Artists (1967) and MCA bought Universal.H A strategy of diversification led to corporate expansions into music recording, theme parks, and publishing. However, the film industry suffered unprecedented economic losses. Conditions such as increased film production costs, changing demographics and competition from television almost led to the collapse of the Hollywood film industry. Film historian Thomas Schatz notes: \"Studio profits fell from an average of $64 million in the five-year span from 1964 to 1968, to $13 million from 1969 to 1 9 7 3 .\"12 Primarily, conglomeration for the film studios meant a reconfiguration of financial structures and down sizing of facilities. In American Film and Society Since 1945, Albert Austen and Leonard Quart note: The studios had become primarily financiers and distributors, treating film more as a business than an industry and consequently taking more Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Production shifted to the independent production companies and house styles dissipated. The fragmentation and elimination of studio sound departments led to the rise of independent sound houses, such as Todd AO, the Goldwyn Studios, Zoetrope, and later Skywalker Sound. Many houses purchased equipment and facilities from studios which were downsizing and simultaneously integrated new music and computer technologies, which proved smaller and more versatile than previous studio equipment. Sound production and post production became a separate industry. Various sound facilities would compete for independent production contracts, customizing to the technological and aesthetic needs of each new production and its staff. Innovation and technology were advanced as producers and directors grew more attentive to sound and music in terms of aesthetic and economic impact. The \"Movie Brats\" like George Lucas, Martin Scorsese, Brian DePalma, and Steven Spielberg were all interested in audio as were other filmmakers like William Friedkin and Robert Altman. Dolby Noise Reduction, multi-tracking, and denser sound tracks prevailed during Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 33 this period on films such as The Exorcist (1973), Nashville (1975), and Star Wars (1977). The \"New Hollywood\" as it came to be known demanded a new sound to match the visual innovation and aesthetic reach of the blockbuster film, particularly the science fiction blockbuster. The era saw the release of many seminal science fiction films including Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Alien (1979), and the remaining Star Wars sequels. Science fiction films, perhaps more than any other genre, re-calibrated audience expectations for spectacle not only in terms of special effects but in terms of sound. Sound became part of the cinematic event like an amusement attraction. Film revenue soared. Following the studio fragmentation, many sound personnel retired. Others became freelance specialists, moving from film to film without permanent contracts or positions. Some experienced sound editors and mixers went to work for sound houses or attached themselves to specific directors or production units. Sound recordists and production personnel were assisted in the transition to this new mode of production by the introduction of portable recording equipment, which proved one of the key factors in the rise of sound design. The Swiss made Nagra III was a portable 1/4\" magnetic tape recorder, designed by Stefan Kudelski and introduced in 1957.14 This model was subsequently upgraded utilizing silicon transistors in 1969 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 34 and released as the Nagra IV. It featured a variety of meters, speed varier, a self speed check,, and redundancy systems to assure recording quality and reliability and became a staple of independent filmmakers working in the new documentary stylistic of cinema verite. Portability and economy were key to the recorders adoption by Hollywood's independent sound personnel. The Nagra eliminated the need for large studio sound trucks which formerly held all of the equipment necessary for sound capture. The unit was also inexpensive, under $10,000 dollars and extremely reliable, limiting maintenance costs. Subsequently, a sound recordist could be contracted for both sound expertise and recording equipment. Portability and mobility were essential to developing a new lexicon of film sound. According to Ben Burtt (Star Wars series), the portable technology along with smaller mixing boards and processors allowed the creative potential of film sound to be \"rediscovered\" and re-invented in this new era.1 - 5 With the Nagra and multi-track recorders, experimentation by sound personnel became possible but more importantly was encouraged by producers and directors like George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola. For Star Wars, Burtt travelled extensively throughout the Los Angeles area, recording highway noises through corrugated tubing as well as jets and heavy machinery for the futuristic vehicles in the film, all on the portable Nagra. Like the new Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 35 generation of directors, Burtt understood that sound could not only capture a cinematic reality, but create one. Without access to traditional studio sound departments and sound libraries, producers and directors often had no choice but to commission sound designers to create new catalogues of sound for their films. According to Walter Murch, this was the case for THX 1138. The various sounds of jet cars, robots, and computer circuitry were all created from sets of newly recorded components and manipulated through editing and multitrack recording. It is important to note that Coppola and Lucas both moved their productions to the San Francisco area thus avoiding Hollywood's Unions and the strict divisions of labor. Sound personnel in San Francisco come under the Stagehands Union which allows greater latitude in jurisdictional matters and duties regarding sound mixing and recording. In this context, sound designer Ben Burtt could conflate the duties of recordist and mixer in order to composite infinite variations of new sounds, customized to the needs of a particular narrative and not waiting until the final mix to make critical creative decisions. In part, this shift in mode of production springs from another influential factor in sound design, the film school. Gary Kurtz, producer of Star Wars and American Graffiti notes: \"What film schools spawned were film schools. That, more than anything else.\"16 Though the Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 36 comment is facetious, a deeper truth lies in the fact that the increase of film courses throughout the country would cause an explosion of cinematic analysis. Major universities such as the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), the University of Southern California (USC), and New York University (NYU) offered courses in film aesthetics and production, while other Universities included cinema in already established disciplines such as English Literature or language studies. Cinema studies promoted analysis and exploration of film aesthetics, history, economics, and production, and in turn heightened not only cinematic literacy but also sound literacy. Film societies screened a balance of classic Hollywood cinema and international art cinema, all of which influenced the film school generation. The orations and intricate sound editing in Orson Wells's Citizen Kane (1941) were celebrated as idiosyncratic sound recordings by Jean Luc Godard in Alphaville (1965). In terms of student film production, university film programs offered young filmmakers an alternative mode of production to the traditional Hollywood system. Filmmaker Walter Murch, a graduate of USC, explains: Someone who's been to film school has a kind of inverted pyramid of experience ...Because of the curriculum, you are forced to do everything, and only gradually do you focus on one thing, whereas in the industry, it's the exact opposite, if you enter as an assistant Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 37 sound man, you become a sound man, and then, perhaps, a sound editor.17 The limited scope of film projects would necessitate a mode of production in which individuals would work on their own or in small groups where multiple positions of responsibility would be shared and acknowledged in terms of credits. As a result, future New Hollywood filmmakers became conversant with all facets of cinematic technology and design: In place of the narrow experience the old studios offered, the new filmmakers had been given a thorough grounding in the basics of their craft. It is no coincidence that sound should be so crucial to films like The Godfather or Star Wars, or that editing of Taxi Driver or New York, New York should be so idiosyncratic. Coppola, Lucas, and Scorsese all know the basic technology and grammar of film well enough to take it for granted and transcend it.^® The mode of production in cinema schools provided enough cross over within the disciplines to allow new filmmakers the opportunity to experiment with the image and sound constructions with confidence on their Hollywood financed films. Film sound would never be the same. Concurrent with these cinematic developments, the broadcast industries and the consumer electronics industry created a generation of audiophiles after World War II by offering expanded music programming and high quality, low cost audio components to American consumers, specifically Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 38 the youth market. Among this generation would emerge filmmakers who were conversant in both sound technology and sound aesthetics and they would apply this knowledge to transform contemporary film sound. In 1948, CBS introduced the long-playing record (LP), developed by Peter C. Goldmark and featuring ' microgroove recording', which allowed over 20 minutes of program material per side, per 12 inch disc.The vinyl recording base and finer grooves offered a significant advance in recording in terms of fidelity and sound quality, but the LP record was only part of the story. The introduction of new radio components fueled the consumer electronics revolution. The invention of the transistor reduced the need for vacuum tubes in radios, thereby reducing the size and bulk of the technology. The Nagra and new film mixing consoles greatly benefited from the technology. The term Hi-Fi, which had previously been used in England before the war to signify custom radio designs, had been adopted by mass market consumer electronics firms such as Fisher and H.H. S c o t t . 20 Sterling and Kittross note: Many hi-fi sets— actually collections of matched components— were designed to take advantage of the growing number of FM stations, many of which programmed classical music, the flood of LP records, and the promise of home tape recording.21 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 39 Sound, technology had finally moved from the professional realm to the consumer realm. New advances such as the integrated circuit made the technology even smaller and more affordable. Sterling and Kittross note: In I960, nearly two million FM receivers were sold, about 10 percent of them imports from Germany and Japan, where war-devastated electronics industries had been rebuilt into advanced technology, highly efficient operations. The average FM-AM set came down about $30, only $10 to $15 above the cost of an AM-only r a d i o . 22 Subsequently, a generation of youth arose listening to sound broadcasts far superior to any generation in the past. The stereo babies had arrived. Stereo records and tapes were mass marketed in 1957; and the first FM broadcasts were licensed by the FCC in 1961.23 Rock and Roll found a place on LPs and the radio. Top 40 Radio formats pervaded the airwaves by the late 1950 ' s and crossed over to FM. Specialized music formats lined the tuner dial from Country and Western to Motown. Rock and Roll dominated for younger listeners. It became a new musical form that changed the way a new generation of youth listened and expected music to sound. In the early 1960s, record producer-auteur Phil Spector (with engineer Larry Levine) brought a multi­ layered sound to rock and roll. Working initially in the mono format, he treated each recording like a theatrical Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Robert Palmer notes: The idea was not to hear individual instruments, but to have so many instruments playing a few simple melodic lines and rhythm patterns that the sound was deliberately blurry, atmospheric, and of course huge: Wagnerian rock and roll with all the trimmings. 24 This multi-layered approach called attention to the aesthetic and technical possibilities of sound in the medium of music. By the mid 1960s, the British Rock group The Beatles and producer George Martin created a series of the highly innovative and experimental works including Revolver, Abbey Road and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album. The Sgt. Pepper's album featured the use of sound effects such as farm animals, circus organs, electronic noise; varied musical styles such as classical, rock, blues and jazz and a diversity of song and lyrics from classically structured ballads to found poetry. In California, The Beach Boys provided the American equivalent with the album Pet Sounds, which Paul McCartney has noted inspired the Sgt. Pepper's album. The Beach Boys would go on to produce the highly inventive song \"Good Vibrations,\" which incorporated the chilling low basses of a cello as used in horror movies and the oscillating and ethereal sounds of the Theremin found in classic science fiction Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 41 films. The song is consistently praised as one of the most innovative and influential in rock and roll recording. Cinematic sound effects and strategies had pervaded contemporary music, but -the exchange of technological and experimentation flowed easily between the media. The interface resulted in a heightened awareness on the part of younger filmgoers and filmmakers of both music and sound. In short, the new generation demanded the same quality of sound from film that they had come to expect from their music and their own stereo systems. It is no surprise then that films of the late 1960s and early 1970s offered rock and roll not only as a significant facet of the sound track but as part of the narrative storytelling. The most notable Rock and Roll films include Richard Lester's Hard Days Night (1964), Mike Nichol's The Graduate (1967), and George Lucas’s American Graffiti (1973). Lucas even included the names of songs in the log line of each scene of his script for Graffiti. The function and status of music was shifting. Traditional film music, which sought to be self effacing, was superseded by music motivated by diegetic factors. American Graffiti, in particular wove the music into the fabric of the narrative as well as the mise-en- scene. Within the context of the story, the radio DJ Wolfman Jack spins records for a local radio station, while the spaces of the nearby town swim in a \"soup\" of 1950s rock music which slips between source music and score. The Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 42 sound design of the film was enhanced by layering in spatial factor. The filmmakers re-recorded music in various spaces, which accentuated the reverberation off walls and surfaces. Music transcended its traditional status and became both sound effect and musical motivator, offering a sense of place and a sense of nostalgia. The endless days of youth were coming to an end. So not unexpectedly, rock music and cinema found common cultural ground. Each provided a forum for protest, for experimentation, and for personal expression and liberation. As Mast notes, \"rock music was the other artistic and social passion of the young audiences who were supporting the m o v i e s . \"25 Easy Rider (1969) and other youth oriented film tapped into the connection between the mediums and spurred a trend by Hollywood Studios to exploit it. The production of youth films exploded. Rock documentaries like Monterey Pop (1968), Woodstock (1970) and Gimme Shelter (1971) emerged as a new genre of music film. Music became integral in the marketing of all types of mainstream Hollywood films, often providing cross over marketing on radio and unprecedented ancillary revenue. Top 40 placement of music from a film could increase revenue for films to recoup production costs and sometimes exceed box office grosses. Rock music pervaded the aural design of films because of the sensibilities and demands of the young filmmakers who made these films. The importance of film Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 43 music had shifted from film score to soundtrack. New image and sound relations emerged and music found a place of privilege on the sound track that it had never before had. The self-reflexive nature of this privilege led to a new read on film sound and new expectations. Once the audience had caught on to the possibilities of music and sound, the film industry could never go back to the noisy mono prints of the past or the simple reliance on music scoring and dialogue to carry the soundtrack. A new era of sound beckoned with a new music and new voices. Ironically, though, it was neither rock music or film scoring that brought about one of the most profound changes in cinema sound, it was the classical rendition of The Blue Danube and the avant garde composition Requiem for Sopranof Mezzo- Soprano, Two Mixed Choirs and Orchestra. These pieces heralded a new era in film sound aesthetics by offering not so much answers, but questions. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Clarke noted: \"If you understood 2001 completely, we failed. We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered.\" - 1 - The importance of 2001 for this study is that it raised questions not only about the origins of mankind but about the nature of sound in cinema, particularly the status and function of film music. Rather than employ a traditional music score composed specifically for the film, director Stanley Kubrick produced 2001 with previously existing music as a deep structure to the narrative and its speculative aspects. This unprecedented approach, which mimics in part the process used in feature animation but which had never been applied to a science fiction film, transgressed the traditional music image model found in classical Hollywood cinema and heralded the dawn of sound design. The unexpected juxtapositions of previously recorded classical and avant garde compositions with the speculative imagery in 2001 caught many filmgoers and critics off guard. The uncanny effects challenged all who saw the film— so much so that it became akin to a cinematic Rorschach test. What was the meaning of the mysterious Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 45 monolith and its accompanying three chord musical progression? Was it a catalyst in evolution? Was it God? Or was it simply a beacon left by distant visitors, waiting for a call? The self reflexive constructions throughout the film encouraged a constant questioning of image-sound relations, clearly moving the soundtrack away from the notion of realism and charging it with speculative possibilities. Critics debated the significance and appropriateness of the music, younger audiences gave in to the spectacle and formed rituals of drug taking and spectatorship, and the film school generation viewed 2001 as a new benchmark in science fiction and sound. Like the mysterious monolith, 2001: A Space Odyssey served as a catalyst for change, inspiring metaphysical speculations into human evolution and raising equally significant questions about image-sound relations in cinema that still resonate today. To understand the shift in image-sound relations brought about by 2001, it is first necessary to examine the traditional music image model within classical Hollywood cinema, which finds its roots in classical music, the ballet, opera, and musical theater. Most influential is perhaps the work of composer Richard Wagner (1813-1883) in whom the \"German Romantic Movement of the nineteenth century found its completest [sic] musical expression.\"2 His contribution to musical theater was a reconfiguration Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 46 of musical structure in relation to narrative, in particular his use of 'leading motifs' or leitmotif as a system of unity: By so designing these fragments that each aptly characterizes the situation or person with whom it is first associated, he enables himself to bring particular thoughts and reminiscences to the memory of his audience at will, and so to strengthen the dramatic significance both of his vocal line and of his orchestral commentary.3 Cinema would adopt these strategies even prior to the transition to sound. In early cinematic musical accompaniment, various emotional rifts or cues such as \"misterioso,\" \"dramatic tension\" or themes of love provided the flexible catalogue of music offered to accompanists or orchestras in the motion picture theater.4 These cues were usually drawn from \"standardized snatches of operas, orchestral music and popular tunes.\"5 Such leitmotifs sought to fuse musical movements with specific characters or events, offering sonic identification or signature phrases. Leitmotifs could be varied and incorporated into almost any of a film's other musical structures— for instance, to punctuate romance subplots or to foreshadow the entrance or presence of the character. The methodology unified narrative through repetition and variation, often mimicking the action and dramatic structures within the story. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. With the transition to sound and the inclusion of synchronized dialogue and effects, the utilization and status of music changed somewhat in relation to the image and narrative. Rather than provide a constant stream of melodic constructions, music fragmented and integrated into the structures of the sound track, slipping in and out of scenes and around other sound constructions, particularly dialogue which superseded both music and effects in importance. The strategy of employing leitmotifs became standard to the mode of music production in supporting classical narrative, and two primary distinctions of film music evolved: score and source music. Score generally refers to the entire body of music on the soundtrack. In the classical period, this non-diegetic music often featured original symphonic orchestrations from notable composers such as Dmitri Tiomkin, Bernard Herrmann, Max Steiner, Erich Wolfgang Komgold and others. During the rise of science fiction cinema in the 1950s, Dmitri Tiomkin created the ominous compositions for Howard Hawks' classic production of The Thing- (1950), while Bernard Herrmann famous for the music in Citizen Kane (1941) wrote scores for two seminal science fiction works The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Fahrenheit 451 (1966). Currently, modern science fiction composers like John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith, and James Horner recall these past masters in Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 48 their work for Star Wars (1977), Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) and Aliens (1986). Score most often functions as an omniscient presence offering subtle emotional and narrative cues, which tell the audience how to feel. It has been compared to \"wallpaper\" by Stravinsky \"because it fills in cracks and smoothes down rough textures\" of cinema's formal processes of editing, cinematography and the like. 30 while this is in some respects true, it has been noted that \"the classical film score enters into a system of narration, endowed with some degree of self-consciousness, a range of knowledge and a degree of communicativeness. \"6 Music then is not entirely invisible, rather it often has ideological intents and implications for the narrative. For instance, it can foreshadow character emotions, recall past events, and/or establish period or era through instrumentation and orchestration. But these functions are determined and held in check by classical narrative and image considerations, so that score maintains a specific and limited status, a convention which 2001: A Space Odyssey violates. In contrast, source music is motivated within the story world, usually signifying a specific location or era relevant to the narrative. This cannon has been used to ironic effect within Science Fiction, particularly Kubrick's other masterwork A Clockwork Orange (1971), which features a version of \"Singin' in the Rain\" sung during a Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 49 brutal assault. Source music can be an original composition or a pre-existing piece and can be motivated on-screen (for instance, a radio within a scene) or off-screen (a radio in the next room) . Source music often hides narrative intent within the scene, offering commentary or narrative direction in a less intrusive manner. As previously noted, the introduction of rock scores in the late 1960s navigated the boundaries between source music and score. More recently, science fiction films have blurred the lines. Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) incorporated the Disney classic \"When You Wish Upon A Star\" into the dialogue and then into the main score during the final mothership sequence of the film. Similarly, Back to the Future (1985) incorporated the song \"The Power of Love\" into the narrative, and the score, even spinning the song off as hit single on top 40 radio. The navigation between score and source is in part a legacy from the rethinking of traditional music image relations brought about by 2001 and other films of this era. Within classical Hollywood narrative, traditional scored music formed a specific set of image-sound relations, such as accompanying the dramatic aspect of the scene, cueing specifically to action, playing through the action, summarizing dramatic turns, offering psychological subtext, among others.^ These relations strove to create unity and remain within the boundaries of classical Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 50 narration. Traditional musical scores thus remained somewhat self effacing and subservient to the image and dramatic action. In contrast, 2001: A Space Odyssey challenged the traditional boundaries of narrative and music, both in production and aesthetic application. As Vivian Sobchack notes: \"Kubrick...uses 'unoriginal' film music originally, seeing music not only as supportive of his visuals but also as an active participant in the creation and/or destruction of image content.The music is self conscious in its narrative purpose and overt in its presence within the spectacle. It demanded attention, elevated its status, and as a result, the film required a new reading strategy, which addressed both the visceral intent of the music as well as the intellectual intent. Like the best literary science fiction, 2001 demanded speculation not just about the future but about its own formal production. Ironically, the pattern of music production for 2001 was poised to follow the traditional route. In December of 1967, Stanley Kubrick contacted composer Alex North whom he had worked with on Spaxrtacus (1960) to prepare an original score for 2001: A Space Odyssey. This request was in part at the urging of MGM which had rejected Kubrick's initial suggestion of using classical music recordings in the film. North was intrigued by the concept of the film which was to include only twenty five minutes of dialogue and relatively Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 51 few sound effects.^ During a two week period in England, North ambitiously composed and recorded approximately forty minutes of music, but then the process suddenly stalled. After waiting for several weeks, North recalled: [In February of 1968] I received word from Kubrick that no more score was necessary, that he was going to use breathing effects for the remainder of the film...I thought perhaps I would still be called upon to compose more music.. .Nothing happened. I went to the screening in New York, and there were most of the \"temporary tracks. \"10 It has been suggested in various accounts that the delays and utilization of North were perhaps a means of appeasing MGM and that Kubrick never intended to use an original score. Not surprisingly, North and other composers saw the use of pre-existing music in 2001 as a mistake, primarily for aesthetic reasons (the context of the pieces did not fit the time period presented), but not mentioned is the fact that Kubrick's approach challenged not only the traditional mode of music production but the traditional music image model. Kubrick drew from a unique conceit. He treated 2001 as if it were an animated feature and given the high number of special effects shots (over 200), the film can almost be categorized as animation. Instead of unifying the film with an original score late in the post production process as is the case with most live action features, Kubrick edited the Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Consequently, the classical and avant garde compositions provided the deep structure for the ideas and questions that the film proposed. In a thematic sense, the sound track emphasized the sonic mechanics in order to emphasize the celestial mechanics at work. This shift in mode of production facilitated a shift in reception strategies. A primarily literary reading of the text and dialogue was not encouraged. Instead, a careful reading of image and sound relations was demanded as part of an integrated strategy. 2001 became the future of spectacle cinema, but it was also science fiction, a genre which encourages analysis and discursive play. For every formal convergence of image and sound, monolith and music, ship and waltz, questions arose as to intent and meaning. It is important to note that when discussing the film Director Stanley Kubrick reiterates the importance of the \"non-verbal aspects\" while author Arthur C. Clarke notes the thematic premises of \"hierarchy\" and \"humanity.\" 1 ^ It is this tension between the visceral and the intellectual that reveal the strength and the impact of the film and its musical design. Mimicking the narrative structure of the film, the selections of music in 2001: A Space Odyssey collapse different time periods and musical styles from eighteen century classical compositions to the contemporary Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

These selections range from Johann Strauss's The Blue Danube to Gyorgy Ligeti's Requiem for Soprano, Mezzo-Soprano, Two Mixed Choirs and Orchestra. The historical context of the pieces, however, seems tangential to their use in the film. Kubrick notes: Don't underestimate the charm of ' The Blue Danube,' played by Herbert von Karajan. Most people under 35 can think of it in an objective way, as a beautiful composition. Older people somehow associate it with a Palm Court orchestra or have another unfortunate association, and generally, therefore, criticize its use in the film. It's hard to find anything much better than ' The Blue Danube' for depicting grace and beauty in turning. It also gets about as far away as you can get from the cliche of space music.^ The intent was to strip away the traditional associations and re-configure meaning within a new narrative and formal context. Music almost became akin to a sound effect, stripped of time, place, and associations. In keeping with the Modernist Movement of the period, Kubrick brought together classical music (high art) and science fiction (low art), rejected classical narrative techniques for spectacle, and offered a range of identification patterns from image-sound relations to characters like David Bowman to even a computer, HAL. For Kubrick, it was essential that filmgoers find themselves awash in the film's images and music to truly experience the future and the possibilities Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The first and most famous piece in the film is Also Sprach Zarathustra, a three note progression, C-G-C, which has become forever associated with 2001 and the mysterious monolith. Also Sprach Zarathustra (Thus Spoke Zarathustra) was composed by Richard Strauss in 1898 and the version used in the film was performed by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Karl Bohm. In the opening credit sequence, the piece is associated with the aligning of the moon, earth and sun. The building grandeur accentuates the upward movement of these masses and connects the celestial mechanics of the universe with rhythmic mechanics of the music. This spectacle of alignment emerges as leitmotif throughout the film, foreshadowing knowledge, development and evolution. Its association of the music with the film and the monolith are a testimony to the enduring power of spectacle and image-sound identification. The piece recurs in both the Dawn of Man sequence and at the end of the film, framing the film not surprisingly like a musical chord. In this instance, the intertextual connection of the piece does demand some examination. The title of Strauss's composition refers to Philosopher Nietzsche's work of the same name. Yet the distance between the works appears only referential. Composer Richard Strauss noted: Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

I meant to convey by means of music an idea of the development of the human race from its origin, through the various phases of its development, religious and scientific....13 What seems most important both in the music and the film is the notion of progression. Michel Ciment explains: Richard Strauss 1s symphonic poem is no more an illustration of Nietzche's vision than is Kubrick's film, itself a symphonic poem. Each of them develops and reworks that vision into a completely independent work of art. The death of God challenges man to rise above himself, and 2001 offers the same progression as in Nietzsche, from ape to man and from man to superman. ^ Whereas Strauss transformed the progression into music, Kubrick re-configured it through image-sound spectacle. The musical selection underlines the philosophical nature of the work. It is in conjunction with this music that the \"moonwatcher ape\" gains understanding. He associates the bone with killing. This mimics the filmgoers association of the music with the monolith and re-enforces the implications that the monolith may be a prime catalyst in the evolution in mankind. In some respects, the monolith serves as an evolutionary alarm clock complete with musical accompaniment. Once again, an alignment of the sun and monolith support the notion of order out of chaos and celestial progression. It's final use ushers in the birth Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Closely linked to the monolith is also the Requiem for Soprano, Mezzo-Soprano, Two Mixed Choirs and Orchestra, which was composed by Gyorgy Ligeti and the version in the film was performed by the Bavarian Radio Orchestra, under the conduction of Francis Travis. The music presides over the appearance of the monolith when it is shown with prehistoric man, when it is examined by the scientists on Clavius, and when it floats through space during the Jupiter mission. Michel Ciment notes: Gyorgy Ligeti' s oratorio which serves as a musical leitmotiv for the presence of the monolith reflects Clark's idea that any technology far in advance of our own will be indistinguishable from magic and oddly enough, will have a certain irrational quality. In the prehistoric man sequence, the piece plays over the early morning appearance of the monolith to the apes. Initially, the soundtrack includes the frantic grunts and growls of the apes within the narrative world as they are awakened by the mysterious object, but then with the rising sun, the apes touch the monolith and the music overwhelms the soundtrack. The on-screen noise drops completely from the mix, and a cinematic abstraction builds. The privileged status of the music reveals a shift in subjectivity within the minds of apes. It signals the buzz of thought and Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. 57 understanding. The image of the sun peaking over the monolith then cutting off abruptly to the scene of the ape discovering the bone as weapon supports the notion that the object is somehow initiating a change in thought and evolution. This idea is reinforced by the recurrence of a similar scene on Clavius. When Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) visits the moon, the scientists are drawn to the monolith for a photo opportunity. Again, the Requiem plays and becomes unnerving. The scene, though, is humorous as the scientists gather for a picture like a family at a national monument. Thematically, the visual design indicates an attention to order, grouping, and alignment. It also punctuates the context and the place, both physical and metaphysical. These representatives of mankind are on a different celestial body than earth. The event uncovers not just the monolith, but all of the work, the technology, the insight that it took to reach this location and this moment. It represents the ability of humanity to achieve, yet the monolith and the music punctuate the utter mystery of mankind's origin and evolution. With the monolith uncovered and once again exposed to the sun, it triggers. A high pitched buzz is heard in the scientists' helmet headsets. The sound and message are mediated by technology, which is the pivotal transition point between these first two sequences. Specifically, the moment refers to the match Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Once again, with the buzzing and the music, there is a shift in subjectivity cued by sound, and the echo to the early apes is not lost. The sequence again cuts to a pivotal period of development in the narrative, the Jupiter mission— 18 months later. In the Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite Sequence, the Requiem traces the flight of the monolith as it aligns with the planets and disappears, triggering the \"star gate\" sequence. In this instance, the buzz of the message transforms into movement through the infinite and it is a journey David Bowman and audience are encouraged to take. It is this sequence which many younger audiences anticipated in their drug taking rituals, no doubt pursuing consciousness raising on cinematic and psychological levels. The ritual becomes akin to light shows at rock concerts and the atmosphere of drug taking and unity with the music. During the slit scan sequence, the music transforms. It segues into another Gyorgy Ligeti piece entitled Atmospheres, performed by the Sudwestfunk Orchestra, conducted by Ernest Bour. In this sequence, image and sound spectacle converge. The subjectivity of Bowman is transferred to the filmgoer in this trip through galaxies, stars, and the unknown.

In the brightly lit bedroom, distorted samples from the music fragment on the soundtrack into whispers and laughter. The electronic build up makes it unclear whether this is communication or observations like musical voice-over. Regardless, the music is anthropomorphized, yet still mysterious and inexplicable. Neither Kubrick or the film overtly expresses the meaning and justifications of the chattering music, leaving an open ended interpretation. Another significant musical piece which supports this odyssey through the universe is the Blue Danube by Johann Strauss, performed by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and conducted by Herbert von Karajan. The piece accompanies Dr. Floyd in his shuttle trip from Earth to the space port. It adds a whimsical quality to the events such as the movement of the shuttle, the weightlessness of the cabin, and Dr. Floyd's pause to read the instructions for using the zero gravity restroom. More importantly, the spectacle of music and movement comments on the forces of celestial mechanics at work in the film. In the synchronization of images to the music, the physics of the universe adhere to an underlying structure of musical mathematics in perfect time. There is an important commentary here. While the contact civilization controlling the monolith seems to have mastered these elements, humanity is only a part of their Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The waltz profoundly recasts technical notions of physics, gravity and universal forces into visceral and human terms. The visual spectacle set to the waltz implies a dance of grace and progression and ultimately a courtship toward pro­ creation. Ship and station substitute for sperm and ovum. It is a technical conception which foreshadows the true conception of the \"star-child\" at the end of the film. So despite its apparent levity, the composition brings a deeper structure to the film, questioning the deeper forces of nature and the universe. In contrast to the whimsy of the Blue Danube, Lux Aetema, composed by Gyorgy Ligeti, performed by the Stuttgard Schola Cantorum and conducted by Clytus Gottwald, provides a more ominous commentary on the proceedings. This disconcerting music leads Dr. Heyward Floyd to the site where the monolith has been unearthed on Clavius. The piece is transitional in most respects, but casts a vale of mystery and fear over the human activities and understandings. It punctuates the mistrust and uncertainty that pervade the human interactions throughout the film. In particular, Floyd's lies about his presence on the space station, and more importantly, HAL’s unstable and distrustful relationship with the crew of the Jupiter mission.

This music is desolate and soothing, a candid portrait of the man who selected it. The most important use of source music, though, comes at the end of the Jupiter sequence. It is the song \"Bicycle Built for Two\" which HAL sings as his higher brain functions are being cut off by David Bowman. The song functions on multiple levels. Whereas the other pieces in the film deal with progression, this piece deals with HAL's regression. It is strongly associated with HAL's past, his programming and his makers. Thematically, the moment is again about origins and THE question: where do I come from? As Bowman disconnects the computer, HAL reverts, remembering his youth in rhyme and song. This song is an intertextual reference to early artificial intelligence development. \"Bicycle Built for Two\" was the first song sung by a computer in an experiment done by John Kelly at Bell Labs.1? Another layer of complexity was added to the song as Arthur C. Clark notes: \"In the early 1960s at Bell Laboratories I heard a recording of an Illiac computer singing 'Bicycle Built for Two.'

In the formal manipulation of the source music, Kubrick reiterates themes of fragmentation and madness which are common in his film and intricately woven into selection of music. The slowing of the song also foreshadows Bowman's regression and paradoxical evolution into the infant \"star-child.\" Once again, the film reprises the three chord progression of Also Sprach Zarathustra, leaving open ended questions of mankind's origins and evolution. The profound and unexpected integration of these various musical works proved challenging to all who saw the film, breaking audiences from the ease of understanding they were accustomed to with traditional narratives and traditional film music. The secret language of music which once only whispered to audience' s emotions was now speaking directly to them and asking questions. The questions that the film proposed transformed the status of science fiction in cinema, re-calibrated audience expectations about image- sound relations, and inspired a generation of filmmakers. Echoes of the film's impact clearly resonate in films like John Carpenter's Dark Star (1974), George Lucas's Star Wars (1977), and Steven Spielberg’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977).
