        "text": "In 2002, \"Punch Drunks\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\", the only Stooge film to achieve such an honor.\n\nThe man who falls off the back of the truck when Larry drives it away ended up breaking his leg from the fall in real life.\n\nThis is the only one of their shorts that The Three Stooges wrote entirely themselves. Moe Howard wrote the treatment, and added Curly Howard and Larry Fine's names to it.\n\nThe short is notable as being one of the few in which the Stooges are not an established trio at the beginning of the film."
