If the talents of this comedy team are compared with other teams—Laurel and Hardy, the Marx Brothers, or even Wheeler and Woolsey and the Ritz Brothers—the ability to create a wide range of humor will balance out in favor of these other groups. Fans will, of course, not care—they like the simple, unpretentious directness of Three Stooges comedy. Over three decades the team created almost 200 shorts, appeared in or starred in some 20 features, and evidently lasted longer than any other team of comedians. In the popular cinema Moe, Larry, and Curly have made a contribution that cannot be dismissed.\n\nThe Three Stooges are actually a latter-day version of the wacky slapstick tradition developed by Mack Sennett in the 1920s—a type of unsophisticated comedy that springs from the verbal and physical altercations of circus clowns and vaudeville comedians. All of the kings of silent and sound screen comedy—Charles Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, Harry Langdon, W. C. Fields, Laurel and Hardy, and the Marx Brothers—used many scenes with physical abuse (slapstick) and verbal invective. If the Three Stooges can be faulted for the use of such material, it lies mostly in the thin motivation for face slapping and eye poking. A minor disagreement in their films causes Moe to slap Curly or Larry and an exchange of blows develops that seems unnecessary or even silly. Such exchanges, however, are well divorced from reality. As fans know, these are childlike men who will soon be working as a trio to solve, in a bungling way, the problem that confronts them.\n\nMany of the shorts created by the Three Stooges show the basic materials used by other comedians in the 1920s and 1930s. To create a basic situation that was different, the group would take up a variety of occupations: they were waiters, plumbers, salesmen, detectives, soldiers, physicians, and businessmen. And in any of these endeavors, they would botch up the job. Moe, Larry, and Curly also had a relationship that was similar to that used by other comedy teams. Moe Howard, the most durable Stooge over the years, was a leader of sorts—a low-brow version of Groucho Marx. He also believed he knew more than the others in much the same way Oliver Hardy thought he knew more than Stan Laurel, but Moe had about the same brain power as his comrades. Larry and Curly sometimes served as foils for Moe; they were not merely detractors, they were threats to his assumed leadership. In this sense they worked on a rudimentary level as Chico and Harpo did in their relationship with Groucho. While these relationships are not as clear-cut and consistent as those that existed in the major comedy teams, they indicate the Three Stooges were working on common ground in a way that would appeal to less sophisticated audiences.\n\nWhile the revival of interest in the Three Stooges was prompted by the 1958 release of many of their shorts to television, it should be realized that theatrical releases of the group's shorts lasted into the late 1950s, ten years after most two-reel comedies had faded from the movie program. The immediate success of the television releases did promote one of their first features in years, the 1959 Have Rocket, Will Travel. The features that followed in the 1960s, such as The Three Stooges Meet Hercules and The Three Stooges in Orbit, were starring vehicles, whereas the features of the 1930s and 1940s were light comedies and musicals that used the group as a minor part in the total films.\n\nThe box-office success of the Three Stooges probably assisted in a revival of interest in slapstick comedy such as the high-budget features It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963), The Great Race (1965), and Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines (1965).\n\nMany of the works of the Marx Brothers, W. C. Fields, Mae West, Laurel and Hardy, and the silent films of Charles Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, and Buster Keaton were revived in the 1960s. As humble as the humor of the Three Stooges might be, they obviously had a part in a comedy tradition that refused to die.\n\n—Donald McCaffrey"
