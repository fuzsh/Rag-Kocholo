        "text": "Many discussions of Stanley Kubrick’s 1987 classic Full Metal Jacket inevitably lead to someone asserting that “the first half is better.” Vigorous nods of agreement ensue. Fans usually point to Sergeant Hartman’s darkly comedic, unrelenting verbal abuse and Vincent D’Onofrio’s spine chilling portrayal of Gomer Pyle as points particularly worthy of praise. The first half is undoubtedly a masterclass in filmmaking, for a myriad of reasons. However, I worry about this approach. Though Full Metal Jacket is certainly structured so as to be nicely divided down the middle, the two halves are inseparable with regards to any and all aspects of storytelling. Regardless of all that, I want to for the sheer sake of controversy and devil-advocacy offer a rebuttal: the second half of Full Metal Jacket is better. It’s darker, it’s crazier, it’s funnier, and – in my opinion, most importantly – it’s thematically richer than its counterpart. The last half of Kubrick’s film broadens the scope from the microcosm of Parris Island to the theatre of Vietnam; a backdrop against which the American psyche is paraded and measured, revealing the surreal deformations, distortions, and delusions inflicted by the cruel reality of war.\n\nThe grunts, as the Marines call themselves, speak sardonically of “rotating back to the world”. For the American soldiers, Vietnam is not a place. It is non-physical, a plain of spirits. In Full Metal Jacket, Vietnam is to America what the mind is to the brain. Unconscious desires explode. Violence and perversion rule the day. At the outskirts of the crumbling Hue: here rules the Id. The Vietnam War permanently divided the American people and culture. The American mind in turn was fractured irreversibly. In the aftermath of the Kent State Massacre, veteran John Musgrave recalls thinking to himself: “We’re killing our children now. We’ve really gone mad.” With Vietnam as the unconscious, Kubrick proceeds to show us just how deep the madness goes.\n\nAt first, surrealism manifests itself relatively peacefully. At base camp, amidst the obvious disregard for truth occurring in the Stars and Stripes pressroom, a stranger and wittier indication of insanity hangs on the wall. A red banner reads: “First to Go, Last to Know: We Will Die to Protect Our Right to be Misinformed”. Earlier, as the second half opens, a young Vietnamese man steals Rafterman’s camera and executes a few impressive martial arts moves before speeding away on a moped. Joker leaps about like a monkey, whooping and mocking the man. Apart from being a hallucinogenic moment demonstrating the culture shock experienced by young white American soldiers, the scene also speaks to the juvenile and lopsided nature of the conflict. Joker is playing at fighting. To him, war seems very much like a game. For the Vietnamese, the situation could not be more serious.\n\nAs we come to see, contradiction is at the very heart of Joker’s character. Despite the words on his helmet and his boasting, Joker readily admits when the North Vietnamese Army comes knocking that he “ain’t ready for this shit.” Joker’s imitation of John Wayne is a satire of the American Man; an embodiment of the values of masculinity, force, and violent justice – none of which make a lick of sense in Vietnam. The duality of man bit Joker offers to the Colonel is more satirical bullshit. There are no competing values on the battlefield. Good and evil cannot coexist anymore than peace and war. Each wrestle for supremacy, neither emerge victorious, and both destroy themselves. Joker recognizes this absurdity, and endeavors to laugh at it.\n\nThe Colonel fails to see any contradiction outside of Joker’s combat attire. “Which side are you on?” he loudly demands. By insisting that the Americans are the ‘good guys’ and failing to understand that the enemy holds themselves in equally high regard, the Colonel becomes a walking absurdity. “It’s a hard ball world, son,” he tells Joker. “We’ve got to keep our heads till this whole peace craze blows over.” This comment encapsulates the madness that accompanied America upon intervention in Vietnam. War has been cast as sanity, peace as insanity.\n\nIn Full Metal Jacket, Vietnam is to America what the mind is to the brain. Unconscious desires explode. Violence and perversion rule the day. At the outskirts of the crumbling Hue: here rules the Id.\n\nThe behavior of Joker’s fellow Marines reflects this. Everything is upside-down, purposeless, and vicious. Along for the ride to Phu Bai is a ferryman of chaos: the door gunner. From his seat, he fires his M60 machine gun indiscriminately and incessantly. When asked how he could shoot women and children, he replies “Easy! Just don’t lead ‘em so much!” He cackles. “Ain’t war hell?!” The men of Lusthog Squad spray whole city blocks with automatic weapons, despite not a single hostile being visible. After the sniper wounds 8-Ball, an orgiastic eruption of fire ensues, including 40mm grenades exploding in slow motion. Afterwards, the squad finds out that their target is hiding in an entirely different building outside their line of sight. On the rare instance we see an American soldier kill his enemy, he grins gleefully. Women are bargained over, wrenched about, treated like and referred to as “meat.” One Marine poses with a dead Vietnamese soldier, declaring that “these are great days we’re living […] When we rotate back to the world, we’re gonna miss not having anyone around worth shooting!”\n\nThe interviews the Marines give serve both as snappy characterization through their expressed opinions on America in Vietnam and case studies for America itself. A few are frustrated and confused. One wearily refers to the situation as “a big joke”. Cowboy remarks that there isn’t a single horse in Vietnam, and that there is something “fundamentally wrong with that.” Others react humorously. 8-Ball: “Seems [the Vietnamese] would rather be alive than free”. Joker quips that he “wanted to be the first kid on his block to get a confirmed kill.” Others still react with solemn, brutal honesty. Animal Mother says, unflinchingly; “Well, I think we’re killing the wrong gooks.”[1] When asked whether America belongs in Vietnam, Crazy Earl replies coolly. “I dunno,” he shrugs, “I belong in Vietnam.”\n\nNone of this even approaches any of the fantastic technical elements in the second half of Full Metal Jacket. A bizarre soundtrack featuring iconic records like “Woolly Bully” and “Surfin Bird” create a heavily stylized and psychedelic atmosphere that contrasts with the grittiness of combat. Long, handheld shots of Marines ducking between chunks of concrete and moving across battlefields provide a terse and harshly realistic counterbalance. But all that pales in comparison to the seductive hook of an infamous scene. When we commonly talk about our favourite films, we almost always jump straight to our favorite moments. A great scene can make a great movie. So, I think that to win over any holdouts I need to provide an example of a scene every bit as foreboding and fateful as Gomer Pyle’s suicide.\n\nThese are great days we’re living bros! When we rotate back to the world, we’re gonna miss not having anyone around worth shooting!\n\nWell, there is a second suicide of sorts in the film. When the sniper turns, firing her rifle at Joker, we see the living face of the enemy for the very first time: a teenage girl. This conflict, we realize, is a war on children; fought by children. As she lies dying, Joker comes to grips with this, and cannot leave her to the rats as Animal Mother suggests. He draws his pistol and, his face contorted, ends her misery. In doing so, he snuffs out a final flickering candle. For the dead girl on the floor, innocence was nothing more than a memory. It vanished when American soldiers invaded her homeland. With the pull of the trigger, he kills the child within himself. In its place, the prophesied thousand-yard-stare.\n\n[1] A racist, derogatory term for the Vietnamese\n\nWARNING: Full spoilers for Hereditary and graphic images are included in this article.\n\nIt takes a special type of fear to evoke laughter. This is a lesson that took time for me to learn. When I first saw Ari Aster’s magnificent, innards-shreddingly-frightening film Hereditary in theatres, I became increasingly annoyed by brief outbursts of laughter from audience members during the final twenty minutes of the film. As Annie’s headless body sailed up and into the glowing treehouse, gliding unhindered as if drawn by spectral wires, giggles erupted. It wasn’t until months later, on a second viewing, that I understood these reactions. There’s something about the way Hereditary handles its storytelling that, once tension explodes into action, incites a fear so intense, so discomforting, and so sinister in its unfamiliarity as to be inexpressible by a scream. We scream because fear has made silence impossible. We laugh because screaming no longer makes sense. We are beyond salvation. Paimon has been crowned.\n\nHereditary accomplishes this the same way any filmmaker accomplishes anything remarkable: with a camera and some folks making damn good use of it. The devil is, pardon the pun, in the details of Aster’s film – and no detail is accidental. While essays could certainly be written on Hereditary’s meticulous set design, costuming, lighting, effects, and general mise-en-scene, I think that the most important element lies in the film’s cinematography (executed with tremendous skill by Pawel Pogorzelski). Camerawork is the skeleton key to the film’s aesthetics and scare tactics.\n\nThe subtle realization that the family is being watched creeps up our spine, intensified by the knowledge that we too are helpless. To complicate things further, as the audience we too are the watchers: the terror and terrorized.\n\nWhereas many entries in the horror genre seem to rely on a bombastic shooting style – the cinematic equivalent of shock-and-awe airstrikes – Hereditary’s camerawork can only be described as patient in the eeriest sense of the word. The lens lingers; waiting in halls, in bedrooms, above offices and out windows. Empty shots are held for long moments. During many pivotal moments, cuts are few and far between. Shots tighten and pan gradually. Uneasy, our minds wander: “What are we supposed to be seeing?” Characters step into frame and the camera gently follows, not matching the speed of their movements but keeping them in sight. Gliding around corners. Creeping. These methods make even the most mundane scenes agonizing. The subtle realization that the family is being watched creeps up our spine, intensified by the knowledge that we too are helpless. To complicate things further, as the audience we too are the watchers: the terror and terrorized.\n\nAster and Pogorzelski’s deftness and restraint therefore not only differentiates their film from a surplus of mediocre horror, but manages to instill fear solely through cinematography – a fear greatly intensified when the same tactics are applied to the film’s explicit scares. “Show, don’t tell,” is a classic filmmaking motto. Hereditary’s approach to horror seems to be “Show, don’t shock.” Rather than jumping from an unsuspecting victim to a beast leaping from the shadows, Pogorzelski prefers a slow pan. We hold for a couple painstaking seconds on a character’s widening eyes and trembling jawline until the shot swivels, revealing a dreadful tableau. An example: as the demonic Annie perches on the ceiling, out of his view, Peter hears a creak. He hesitates, sweat-drenched and paralyzed, but as he turns his head the camera follows to unveil a grinning man, completely nude, standing menacingly in the door.\n\nOther times Hereditary forces us to stare down the scare for far longer than we’d like. Aster coerces us into pondering the frightful image we have been forced to face until we simply cannot bear its presence any longer. Seconds feel like hours in these scenes as we memorize and imagine and comprehend the spectre we confront. We are given the time to scare ourselves. In an early scene, when Annie flicks off the light in her workshop, her mother’s apparition appears in the corner of the room. She does not shriek, or snarl, or hurl herself at her daughter. She simply stands there; chin high and shoulders back, smiling. The shot is held, until we briefly cut to Annie’s confused and frightened eyes, and back to her mother. We realize something: her smile isn’t warm. It’s knowing. Elsewhere, Hereditary nauseates. Charlie’s head, ripped bluntly from her neck, tongue sun-swelled and eyes crawling with ants, remains onscreen in full visceral glory for nearly ten seconds. We are not shocked. We are shown. Hereditary knows that if an image is truly terrifying, its mere continued presence will suffice to shock and much more. Aster and Pogorzelski torture us. “You asked for blood!” the film seems to bellow, “Look on my works and despair!”\n\nDue to the patience of the cinematography onscreen, the few instances of dramatic cutting are made all the more effective. One of my favorite moments in the film is a classic shot-reverse-shot series with a twist. As Annie and Peter scream at one another, the camera grows energetic, flicking between their faces. All of a sudden, Peter appears drenched in sweat. Back to Annie. She too is soaking. Something crackles. A glow, a match! It dawns on us just as the flames erupt, a horrible realization that she is about to immolate herself and her son, just as she had previously discussed with Joan. We are allowed to unravel the horror by recognizing the changes in a series of symmetrical shots and recalling earlier exposition. By the time we do, we practically feel the paint thinner singeing our nostrils, and panic sets in.\n\n“You asked for blood!” the film seems to bellow, “Look on my works and despair!”\n\nAfter nearly two hours of patient terror – measured yet immediate, grisly yet cerebral – it should have come as no surprise to me that Annie’s corpse drew anxious giggles. Hereditary puts its audience through quite the ringer. Our genre expectations are subverted. The curtain has been pulled back, and Aster has turned our own minds against us. Pogorzelski’s camerawork invites and later coerces the audience into participation via observation, terrifying us all the while. In doing so, Hereditary renders us as absolutely powerless as the doomed Grahams. What else is one to do then, as a carcass rises and laughter with it, but consider it evidence of the supernatural power of excellent cinematography?\n\nOn the 19th of July, 1941, Soviet archaeologists uncovered and exhumed the body of Tamerlane, a Turko-Mongol conqueror whose campaigns during the 1300s resulted in the deaths of an estimated 5% of the world’s population. Allegedly, an inscription within the casket read: “Whomsoever opens my tomb shall unleash an invader more terrible than I.” 3 days later, Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa. German armies surged across Russia, winning a series of victories; capturing and killing millions of Red Army Troops. For the second time in 50 years, Russian earth was raped and scorched. The Einsatzgruppen, death squads comprised of criminals, razed entire villages and their inhabitants. In 1942, Tamerlane’s corpse was re-buried in full accordance with Islamic rites — just before the crucial Soviet victory at Stalingrad, the largest and most important battle of World War Two.\n\nDid you catch that? An “allegedly”, slipped in among the prophesy and blitzkrieg-doom. I’m not sure whether Tamerlane’s grave actually bore such a curse, because truthfully I haven’t gone to the trouble to find out. For my purposes, thankfully, it’s besides the point. What matters is that if such a thing really was carved into Tamerlane’s casket, it’s a helluva coincidence. It also makes for an enthralling story.\n\nUnfortunately, good stories no longer seem to satisfy like they used to. Hyper-immersion in the technological maelstrom of irony, postmodernism, and manic subversion that defines many corners of the internet has encouraged a quiet sort of cynicism. Pulling a story apart by its threads — mangling it — is at has become at least as entertaining as being treated to one, if not more. YouTube channels like Cinema Sins, which spend over 20 minutes doing precisely this, are extremely popular. We are invited to laugh at the stupid mistakes made by filmmakers; the continuity errors, the flawed reasoning, and especially the outrageous coincidences. In an age where the dull pang of uncertainty seems unavoidable, it makes us feel sharp.\n\nI used to find this sort of content wildly entertaining. However, after a few years of keeping up with Cinema Sins I found myself feeling a sort of exhaustion I had never experienced before. Films that were realistically only mediocre felt like train-wrecks. Great ones seemed incomplete or lazy. I hit on what exactly the problem was while watching a video criticizing “The Force Awakens”, wherein the hard-boiled narrator lambasted the repeated coincidences he felt fueled the narrative. Particular anger was expressed over how the Millennium Falcon just-so-happened to be deserted on Jakku, the desolate planet our plucky orphaned protagonist just-so-happens to inhabit. I found myself wondering aloud: “But, isn’t that the point?”\n\nSamuel Taylor Coleridge contributed an adage that inevitably crops up in conversations such as this one: the willing suspension of disbelief. This concept is often referenced and rarely contextualized. In his Biographia Literaria, Coleridge recalls planning with Wordsworth to write two sets of poems. The first, written by Wordsworth, were to be realistic — “poetry of nature”. Coleridge’s were to be supernatural, intending to evoke “the dramatic truth of such emotions as would naturally accompany such situations, supposing them real.” In other words, the point of the project was to approximate the emotions that would accompany experiencing the impossible.\n\nPopular genres of storytelling thrive on imagining the impossible; sci-fi, fantasy, and adventure chiefly among them. Each genre is of course incredibly broad, with varying adherence to realism. On one end of the spectrum, a political thriller like The Expanse; on the other, a surrealist flick such as Spirited Away. What unites these stories is that they all deal in that which is not, the unreal, the imagined. The history, the characters, the conflicts, the technology, the settings — the universe that these stories inhabit — one or all of these facets of storytelling may be imagined, either in isolation to depict a world differing only slightly from our own, or in conjunction with one another to create something wholly new. It is fiction in the strongest sense of the word.\n\nWhy then do we turn up our noses at coincidences? Why is it that we can stomach dragons, anti-gravity, and the unlikely triumphs of the hero’s journey, but scoff when serendipity rears her head? Our criticism is always that such a turn of events are unlikely. However, many stories make no pretense at all about dealing in likeliness. They offer precisely the opposite: the unlikely, the unreal, and the impossible. Coincidences do not even fall into the latter two categories, as they occur in real life constantly. Thus the inclusion of coincidence is not even unjustified in hyper-realistic works like The Wire. On the contrary, their inclusion is part of what makes David Simon’s depiction of Baltimore truly alive, and therefore endlessly enthralling. Additionally, coincidences are often to the integral to the story’s existence. For a story arc to begin, something strange must occur. The essence of a story, to paraphrase Robert McKee, is change. For change to occur, there must be an inciting incident that sweeps the protagonist into the narrative fold, pushing them out of the familiar and into the unfamiliar. Coincidence is a reliable tactic to accomplish this, hence the Chinese proverb: no coincidence, no story. Of course, when a story breaks the internal rules it has established for itself, criticism is certainly justified. However, I contend that treating coincidences as inherently flawed story facets, as is common, represents an incoherent and itself unrealistic attitude towards storytelling.\n\nThere is an additional benefit offered by coincidences that warrants mentioning. As Coleridge asserted, a willing suspension of disbelief allows for the evocation of powerful emotions. These emotions form the affective foundation of films like The Force Awakens. Fantasy, sci-fi, and adventure stories should be understood as structures of feeling which seek to produce the emotions of shock, surprise, wonder, and amazement. Coincidences, especially big ones, are excellent producers of all four precisely because they are unlikely happenings that we usually find marvelous. Expecting these stories to discard coincidences because they are unlikely then is to discard their emotional centers, for their ability to entertain is intrinsically bound to unlikely events.\n\nOf course, The Force Awakens hasn’t aged too well, and indeed there are problems with a lack of causality in the script. However, the scene in question is undeniably thrilling. It benefits from theatrical irony: we know the importance of this ship, but our protagonists do not. More importantly, the hull of the Falcon coming into frame stirs wonder within our chests. “Holy shit!” we exclaim, “How did that get there?! That’s amazing!”\n\nOur question never really gets answered in any narratively satisfactory manner, but to worry too extensively about this is to again miss the point. Star Wars is a sci-fi adventure film. Strange, unlikely things occurring is a central element of such films. To remove coincidences like this one is tantamount to removing the beating heart of the story, the job of which is to spur the pulsations of excitement in the veins of its audience. Removing unrealistic elements from a story that is not meant to reflect reality prevents the story from being what it is — a fantasy, a speculation — and coerces it forever into the narrow genre-cell of realism with a capital R. A better approach might be to treat coincidences like Tamerlane; let em’ lie.\n\nA hip-hop civil war rages. The elders, known derogatorily as “oldheads”, argue that the music they grew up cherishing has been overtaken by mediocrity. Emcees, once respected, have been discarded and replaced by drug-obsessed, materialistic industry plants apparently incapable of penning coherent bars or an intelligible delivery. The kids, on the other hand, rejoice. They are perfectly pleased with heavy snares and auto-tuned hooks. They dismiss the groans of their adversaries as formless, foolish nostalgia. “The genre is adapting,” they argue, “and we’re the ones driving it! That old shit – boring. This shit bangs.”\n\nHyper-exaggeration aside, its an indisputable fact that hip-hop is as divisive as always. This time, however, the conflict is not between embattled artists and buttoned-up suburban mothers with delicate sensibilities – it is within the genre itself. Neither side, however, can deny that some fantastically interesting music has emerged out of this conflict. The novel breed vaguely referred to as trap music has produced more than a few gems (and at least as many unwieldy, unimpressive chunks of asphalt). Of these, Travis Scott is usually considered among the best.\n\nThe 26 year old’s debut studio album Rodeo was widely praised, sold 110,000 copies in the US, and went Platinum as of 2017. What followed was a series of unfortunately underwhelming projects, including his second album Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight and Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho, a collaborative effort with Quavo. Expectations for ASTROWORLD were as high as the secrecy surrounding its seemingly unforeseeable release date. For many, it was make-or-break: if Travis released another mediocre piece, he no longer warranted interest. With the final release of ASTROWORLD, it seems Scott has proven himself. The album sold incredibly well and received rave reviews. This is in large part, I believe, because ASTROWORLD encapsulates everything fantastic and frustrating about trap music.\n\nOverall, the project is captivating. Like a theme park, more than a dozen features and nearly twice as many instrumentals ensure there is something to satisfy every taste. The writing on ASTROWORLD is sharper than ever, especially on tracks like COFFEE BEAN, where Scott seems determined to prove himself as a proficient emcee in a more traditional sense. Scott synthesizes two foundational elements of hip hop, grit and playfulness, to create an album saturated with psychedelia, ominous atmospheres, and infectious glee. When listened to without an eye on the tracklist, the numerous beat switches make it unclear where one song ends and another begins, producing a hallucinogenic sense of placelessness. Scott’s tactic of including a smattering of guest adlibs and runs only for the full feature verse to appear on another track entirely greatly contributes to this kaleidoscopic milieu. At times, we aren’t exactly sure where we are – and that’s exactly how Scott likes it.\n\nThe album’s language is not tightly structured or immediately comprehensible. ASTROWORLD speaks in tone and color, lurching and leaping between drug-addled mania on NO BYSTANDERS, to airy grandiosity on STOP TRYING TO BE GOD, and wide-eyed pornography on NC-17. The power is the the great hip-hop tradition of pastiche; pulling together a plethora of performances and soundscapes to create something that at once feels recognizable, nostalgic, and deserving of one’s introspective focus. The diverse color in this record garners it the single most sought after (and rarely achieved) attribute in music; replay value. ASTROWORLD, it sometimes seems, holds mysteries worth returning to unravel.\n\nUnfortunately, the same disjointedness that both defines the state of hip-hop as a genre and plays as one of ASTROWORLD’s biggest strengths is simultaneously its undoing. For starters, the album is too long. A number of tracks like 5% TINT and WAKE UP feel undeveloped and unnecessary, featuring comparatively shallow instrumental backings and lazy hooks unsalvageable even by the an artist with the charisma of The Weeknd. The tonal inconsistencies are occasionally more jarring than charming. Such is the case with the Swae Lee-heavy R.I.P. SCREW, which appears to be Scott’s attempt at a sort of dream-pop R&B hybrid that ultimately comes off as bland when situated between the eclectic rager SICKO MODE and the orchestral STOP TRYING TO BE GOD. Cumbersome, filler-laced tracklists are nothing new for trap music and a pet peeve of many. Both the Migos’ highly anticipated CULTURE II and Flatbush Zombies’ Vacation In Hell were notably weighed down by length and a problem of quality, inspired cuts being too far and few between.\n\nAdditionally, there are moments where Scott allows himself to be outdone by his guests. NC-17, for example, sees 21 Savage giving what is perhaps his best performance – rife with campy punchlines and a strangely addictive delivery – whilst Travis’s contributions come off as lackluster. Other times, features feel underutilized. Quavo and Takeoff receive about half a verse each, while Kid Cudi’s feature is reduced to mere (albeit delightful) humming. This problem is again a familiar one; the collaborative efforts of many trap albums either ultimately felt directionless and unhinged, or relied too heavily on featured artists to maintain any measure of cohesion and quality.\n\nNonetheless, the highs on ASTROWORLD are incredibly high. Though there are a few skippable tracks, the album is mostly stacked with excellent performances and the layered production that earned Scott his place in the game. Scott’s experimentation with tradition and novelty yielded an end product that feels as violently rebellious as it does confidently relaxed – sure signs that ASTROWORLD is Scott’s most fleshed out work to date. The frustrations many might have with this piece of work are, I believe, intertwined with what makes it so damn fascinating. Risks were taken to produce a record that manages to fit nicely into the musical zeitgeist whilst also reaching beyond and behind for inspiration. Such a task inevitably results in some missteps. On STARGAZING, Scott chants: “It ain’t a mosh pit if ain’t no injuries”. A similar approach for ASTROWORLD might be good idea. This album was worth the wait and more than a few listens, bumps, bruises, nosebleeds and all."
