        "text": ",\n\nThe two most evil, loathsome and hated figures throughout the entire galaxy from the 21st to 24th centuries.\n\nArguably one of the most turbulent periods of human history. In this section we will be examining how humanity would survive constant attacks from the Venusian tyrant, the Mekon, an invasion from the most evil creatures in all of creation the Daleks, only to become monsters themselves in the 23rd century, before uniting with other races to usher in a new era of peace and prosperity in the 31st century.\n\nThe Age of Spacefleet\n\nDan Dare, the finest captain in all of spacefleet.\n\nThe 2040s was a golden age for mankind. Humanity was united like never before, all prejudices and inequalities of the past were nothing more than a distant memory and technology had reached new heights.\n\nSadly however as mankind celebrated its great achievements. One of its oldest and deadliest enemies plotted its destruction. The Mekon.\n\nThis tyrant had made many attempts to invade the earth throughout the 20th century. His attempts had been foiled by the likes of the Doctor, Bernard Quatermass, and even the Furon invader Crypto.\n\nStill the Mekon did not give up and by the 2040s he had almost completed plans for two new super weapons to use against humanity and the Therons, the other humanoid race who lived on Venus.\n\nThe weapon against humanity was to have been built on the moon and disrupt the weather on the planet earth to the point where it would destroy all of human civilisation. The Mekons weapon against the Therons meanwhile would cause the fire from the Flame belt to spread over the Therons city on the other side of the planet, wiping them out.\n\nThe weapon was unstable however and needed perfecting. Still the Mekon was prepared to wait. He wanted to destroy the Therons completely. Despite claiming to have elevated himself above emotion, he held a special hatred for the Therons as inferior scum. With humanity meanwhile he hoped to turn them into a slave labour force and use them to help conquer other worlds.\n\nIn the year 2047 Captain Dan Dare arrived through the rip in time that he had fallen into almost exactly 100 years earlier. The Treen vessel that had abducted him was sent even further into the future, with Dan managing to escape it in an escape pod before it was pulled further in time.\n\nDan would be taken in by UNIT who investigated the crash site. He discovered much to his horror that he had been gone for over 100 years.\n\nDan Dare visits his “grave” in the late 2040s.\n\nIt took the captain a long while to adjust to life in the 21st century. UNIT would help him get a job as a pilot and over the next ten or so years Dan would rise up the ranks, becoming one of the most respected and celebrated pilots of Spacefleet.\n\nWhilst he may have shot to fame as the man from the past, Dan’s reputation as a pilot would soon eclipse that. During the course of these 10 years, Dan’s success as a pilot in the future would allow him to live a more extravagant lifestyle than he ever did in the 20th century. He would also meet up with his relatives including the archeologist Ivor Dare. Ivor was in fact Dan’s great nephew, but as he was so much older than Dare physically, Dan would often just refer to Ivor as his uncle.\n\nIn the year 2055 Dan would come into conflict with what would eventually be his greatest enemy for the first time. The Mekon!\n\nThe Venus Mission\n\nBy 2055 mankind’s population had increased to over 13 billion. With food becoming scarcer, mankind turned to Venus for help. Humanity did not yet have the technology to leave the solar system and whilst some terrorforming had been accomplished on Mars (including restoring the oxygen to the planet in the late 2040s.) The Martian soil was not yet fertile enough to grow plants.\n\nVenus was an elusive planet that humanity knew was inhabited, but that no one had ever been able to get to. There had been a few manned expeditions to Venus in the early 21st century, but they had never returned and the planet was subsequently put off limits.\n\nNow out of sheer desperation, more missions would be mounted to Venus but they too seemingly vanished without a trace.\n\nSpacefleet was on the brink of giving up until Captain Dan was able to work out that the problem was a forcefield around the planet (which the Captain would later discover was the work of the Mekon.)\n\nThe forcefield was designed to attack the impulse engines, which all earth ships used, causing them to explode. Dan would lead a team using an old fashioned craft, that was able to infiltrate the forcefield and land in the jungles of Venus.\n\nDan’s team consisted of his loyal batman, Digby, Professor Joeclyn Peabody, Sir Hubert a Spacefleet veteran and two experienced pilots Hank and Pierre.\n\nAs soon as they landed, the team faced various dangers, including the Silicon Mass (which devoured Peabody’s vessel), giant Dinosaur like reptiles that inhabited the Venusian jungles and the Atlantines.\n\nAll but Hank and Pierre who had the good fortune to land on the Therons side of the planet were taken prisoner by the Treens. Though they briefly managed to escape (thanks to a defective Treen named Sondar, who became defective after experiencing an emotion, fear when he confronted the Silicon Mass.) The Mekon was able to quickly recapture all of the earthlings except for Dan, who during the fight was knocked down a ravine which washed him down a secret passage way under the flame belt to the Theron’s side of the planet.\n\nThere Dan was reunited with Hank and Pierre and learned the truth about the history of the Therons and the Treens influence on humanity. Dan was able to convince the Therons to help him. Though they did not want to restart their conflict with the Treens, Dan was able to convince the Therons to take responsibility for their role in the ascension of the Treens, who were only able to become a threat to humanity thanks to their reckless actions many centuries ago.\n\nThe Therons helped Dan sneak his way back into the Treens camps, (passing by the lake of monsters which served as the perfect natural defence for the Mekon’s city) disguised as an Atlantine slave. In the camps Dan met with another rebellious Atlantine slave, Dapon, and the two of them would work together to try and free Dan’s friends and stop the Mekon’s super weapon from going ahead.\n\nBack at the Treen city meanwhile, the Mekon carried out horrific experiments on his 3 human captives. He wanted to test how strong untamed humans like his Atlantine slaves were as well as how high a pain threshold they had.\n\nAfter the experiments (which nearly killed Peabody, Hubert and Digby.) The Mekon was satisfied that the Treens were superior, but he nevertheless grew worried that humanity may discover what he was planning as they had already made their way to Venus. He didn’t think that even the Treens could fight off the combined might of the Therons and humanity and so he decided to use more underhand means. (The Treens super weapon that he hoped could destroy the Therons, was still not ready to use as it was still too unstable.)\n\nThe Mekon forced his captives to record a message from humanity, stating that they crashed on Venus, and that Captain Dare was killed in the crash, but that the Treens took them in and saved their lives. The Mekon also wanted them to lie to humanity that the Treens are more than happy to share the food supplies on Venus with the human race.\n\nPeabody and Sir Hubert refused to help the Mekon, even under threat of torture or death, but Digby seemingly agreed.\n\nThe Mekon hoped to win humanity’s trust by helping to cure the famine crisis on earth, after which he could then convince them to allow him to build a station on the moon, to help control the weather to help the humans, (which he would actually use to destroy humanity.)\n\nThe Mekon’s message was broadcast to earth and it did fool humanity for a short time, with the Treens even being hailed as heroes (though UNIT of course had their suspicions.)\n\nUltimately however Digby’s aunt would discover the truth when she was able to decipher Digby’s hidden message. Digby said that staying with the Mekon was just like being on holiday in Sunnymouth. When Digby was actually on holiday on Sunnymouth, he was falsely imprisoned. Anastasia quickly warned Spacefleet and the Treens on earth were imprisoned.\n\nBack on Venus meanwhile, Dan was able to infiltrate the Mekon’s base with Dapon’s help and both rescue his friends and capture the Mekon in a confrontation. Dan would also rescue Sondar, who helped the earthlings to escape using Treen hover pads, powered by thought.\n\nUnfortunately however, the Mekon’s vastly superior brain allowed him to take control of the hover pads, just as Dan and his friends were almost free over the lake outside the city. Before the Mekon could drag Dare back to the city, using a Theron device, Dan was able to sabotage the hover pad, sending himself and the Mekon tumbling into the water below.\n\nThe Mekon was unable to swim and so whilst the Treens tried to rescue their leader, Captain Dan escaped.\n\nKnowing that the Therons had helped Dan, the Mekon declared war and decided to use his super weapon. Even though it hadn’t been tested yet and was so unstable that it could destroy all of Venus. The Mekon was still willing to take the risk.\n\nHe knew that he couldn’t fight a war on two fronts (with humanity, having been made aware of his tricks.) So the Mekon wanted the Therons out of the way with as soon as possible.\n\nFortunately Dapon was able to destroy the Mekon’s super weapon by piloting one of the Treens vessels into the weapon, sacrificing himself in the process.\n\nDan and the others were able to escape to the Therons side of the planet after Dapon’s sacrifice. Both the Therons, and the Treens then broke their peace treaty and launched all out war on one another.\n\nBoth the Treens and the Therons however were evenly matched and every time one would attempt to launch an attack, the other would find a way to block it. The twos weaponry began to cause one another’s technology to stop working. Before all of the Therons space ships broke down however, they were able to get Dan and his friends back home.\n\nBack on earth Dan would organise an attack on the Treens side of the planet whilst they were still vulnerable. The earth forces would succeed in overpowering the Treens whose weapons were all useless. During the fight the Mekon would escape Venus, along with some of his loyal Treens, but he faked his death.\n\nWith the Mekon’s defeat, the Treens were forced to surrender. Sondar would be appointed their new leader, the Atlantine slaves would all be released and granted equal citizenship with the Treens and Therons. For the first time the Treens and the Therons would genuinely work together for the good of Venus.\n\nFree from the Mekon’s influence, many Treens were able to experience emotions for the first time and came feel guilt for their actions under the Mekon. Others however remained loyal to the Mekon and were convinced that he would return to lead them.\n\nThe Mekon meanwhile had fled to Mercury, a small planet in our solar system which had not yet been explored by humanity. The Mercurians were a peaceful, but somewhat placid and primitive race, allowing the Mekon and his Treens to easily conquer them.\n\nQuickly establishing a new base and slave force on Mercury, the Mekon plotted his revenge against humanity and the Therons.\n\nBack on earth, Captain Dan would be hailed as a hero. The Therons and the Treens under Sondar, would supply earth with enough food supplies to fix the famine crisis on earth (with the Treens advanced technology allowing them to harness enough food supplies for earth and Venus many times over.)\n\nWhilst Dan would go on many more adventures in the years to come, his success on the Venus mission would tend to overshadow his later exploits at least until the first Treen invasion of earth.\n\nThe Red Moon Mystery\n\nA few months after the Venus mission, mankind would face a new threat far greater than even the Mekon. The Insectoids of the Red Moon.\n\nThese creatures had visited our solar system many thousands of years ago where they had devastated the surface of Mars, before King Ghidorah had driven them out.\n\nThe magnetic forces of the Red Moon caused any earth vessel that came near it to shut down. It also caused widespread devastation on the colony on Mars as it passed the planet.\n\nDan, Peabody and Digby were able to rescue the colonists using a Venusian vehicle called the Anastacia which was immune to the effects of the Red Moon. However the earth would soon be thrown into panic when the Red Moon approached. All machinery began to break down on earth, preventing anyone from escaping as the Insectoids began to launch an attack on humanity.\n\nProfessor Peabody was able to devise a solution however after theorising that the Insectoids were able to find planets by tracing the light from their suns through space, as light was the only thing that could travel through space.\n\nThe Treens would construct a gigantic lighthouse to lure the Red Moon away from the earth. Once it got a good distance away from the earth and humanity’s technology could work again. Dan, Digby, Peabody and Sondar would fire a weapon from space capable of destroying the entire planet.\n\nNone of them wanted to, but they had no choice. The Red Moon would have gone on to destroy billions more worlds across the universe. Little did they know however a few of the Insectoids managed to escape and would later resurface many centuries later as a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe weapon Dan, Digby, Peabody and Sondar used to destroy the Red Moon was so unstable that it caused their craft to crash land on Mercury. Back home everybody believed that they were dead, but in truth they not only survived, but would stumble upon another great threat to earth.\n\nMarooned on Mercury\n\nDan Dare comes face to face with his archenemy the Mekon a second time.\n\nOn Mercury, Dan, Peabody, Digby and Sondar would discover that the Mekon had conquered its inhabitants and was preparing a second attempt to invade the earth.\n\nIn truth however the Mekon didn’t just simply want to conquer humanity. He judged them to be too much of a threat to his plans for conquest and now sought to exterminate them completely.\n\nThe Mekon had created a deadly plague that would be capable of wiping out all life on earth, but he had no way of depositing it on earth. An unauthorised Treen ship would never make it past either earth or Theron security.\n\nThe Mekon however had a way round this. Not all of the earth vessels that had arrived on Venus before Dan and his team had been destroyed.\n\nOne vessel had been captured by the Mekon, who kept its crew prisoner as a back up plan in case his initial conquest of earth didn’t succeed.\n\nWhen the Mekon fled to Mercury, he took the captured earth crew with them. The Mekon hoped to trick the earthlings to fly back to earth in their own vessel, by allowing them to think they had escaped. The Mekon would of course keep a sample of his plague in the ship which would be released once the ship reached earth.\n\nThe Mekon had not used this plan initially, as before he had wanted to use humanity as a slave labour force, as well as study their race and history. Again however, he now regarded humanity as too dangerous to be allowed to exist.\n\nDan and Peabody were able to discover the Mekon’s plan and rescue the earth crew before they fell for the Treens ruse. The Mekon however was able to capture Dan and his friends and attempted to starve them into serving him. Once again however Dan was able to escape the Mekon and convince the Mercurians to revolt against the Treens, as well as alert earth to his location.\n\nKnowing that he couldn’t stand against the combined forces of Earth, Venus and Mercury, the Mekon and his loyal Treens were once again forced to flee into space.\n\nBack home, Dan, Digby and Peabody were all hailed as heroes for thwarting the Mekon once again, and the trio would go on many more adventures over the next few years (including foiling the Mekon yet again when the villain attempted to crash an earth space station onto Venus to reconquer the Treens.)\n\nDan’s next major adventure however would take him beyond our solar system. In the year 2058, earth would be visited by an alien known as Lero who belonged to a humanoid race of aliens called the Crypts.\n\nHe explained that the Crypts were locked in a perpetual conflict with a pitiless race known as the Phants. Every 10 thousand years, the Phants invade the Crypts planet and virtually wipe out their race. The only way the Crypts survive is to preserve members of their race in suspended animation in space. Once the planet became habitable again, the Crypts would revive and then return to build their society, only for the same horrible cycle to repeat.\n\nLero begged Dan and the earth men to help his people, as they were so weak and pacifistic they could never stand up to the Phants. Dan agreed, and he, Digby, Lex O’Mailey and a young cadet named Flamer would travel across the universe to Cryptos.\n\nThe journey would take two years, one year to reach Cryptos, and one to get home. The crew would be placed into suspended animation during that time.\n\nWhen the earth men arrived on Cryptos, the Phants had already begun their invasion. During their battles with the Phants, Dan’s team discovered the reason the Phants were so aggressive and the Crypts were so passive.\n\nThe two races food supplies were drugged with chemicals, which in the Phants case heightened aggression, and in the Crypt’s case lowered it. Dan would later discover when he travelled to the Phants home planet that the real architect behind the perpetual war was a super computer called Orak. Many centuries ago, Orak had been created to protect the Phants from invaders. It was arguably the greatest war computer ever built, but after hundreds of years of protecting the Phants, Orak, having developed its own sentience, wished to create another war to give itself a purpose and also just simply for its own amusement.\n\nOrak had led the Phants to destroy the two other inhabited worlds in the Phants solar system besides Cryptos; Alerok and Phascos. Both of those worlds inhabitants were vicious and callous warlike people who warred with each other. They had also invaded the Phants, many hundreds of years prior before being driven off. The Phants had no problem waging a war on, and ultimately destroying both races under Orak’s guidance.\n\nHowever with the Crypts, the Phants were not happy invading what were a peaceful people who had never done them any harm. Orak also lacked the technology to move the Phants to other worlds beyond his solar system, so he instead drugged the Phants, turning them into vicious war mongers to attack the Crypts.\n\nWhilst Orak loved war, he was also a poor loser and so after the first Phant invasion that he would ensure his people drugged the Crypt’s supplies too, and lock them in a vicious cycle for his own amusement.\n\nDan was able to defeat Orak and shut the evil supercomputer down for good, freeing both races and allowing them to rebuild together.\n\nA few of the Phants however didn’t want to give up the power they had over the Crypts and so after Dan left, they stole the main file for Orak and fled across the Solar System. They would later build another body for Orak who would go on to lead them to build a massive empire where they would force the various races they ruled over to wage war with each other for their own amusement. Dan Dare would later come into conflict with them in the 23rd century.\n\nOrak, leader of the Phants and one of Dan Dare’s archenemies.\n\nAfter defeating the Phants, Dan prepared to return home, but Lero revealed his terrible secret.\n\nThe journey to Cryptos actually took longer than he said. It took five years to get there and five years to get back. Dan was angry at the deception, but understood why Lero had lied and forgave him as he and his companions went back into suspended animation to return home.\n\nWhen they arrived back on earth in the year 2068 Dan and his men discovered much to their horror that the Mekon had invaded and conquered the planet with the aid of his new servants, the Elektrobots.\n\nThe Treen Invasion of Earth\n\nThe new masters of humanity.\n\nA few months after Dan and his team left for Cryptos, the Mekon and his Treens unleashed their new army of Elektrobots on Venus. They initially conquered the Treens as the Mekon knew that there was still great support for him among their people.\n\nWhilst many had adapted to having emotions, others couldn’t cope with the new feelings and missed having their Atlantine slaves perform their grunt work.\n\nMost of the Treens sided with the Mekon over Sondar when he returned, and those who didn’t were quickly put to death when the Mekon reclaimed his former city. Sondar however was able to escape and would remain on the run for 10 years.\n\nThe Mekon would then lead his people to finally conquer the Therons, with his new Elektrobots giving them the advantage they needed.\n\nWithin less than a week, all of Venus was under the Mekon’s control.\n\nThe Mekon immediately prepared to invade the earth, but first he had to deal with an old enemy in the form of the Furons.\n\nThe Mekon would lure the latest version of Crypto into a trap on Venus by launching constant attacks on Orthopox’s labs on earth with his Elektrobots. Though Crypto was able to slaughter many Treens, the Mekon was able to kill the latest version of Crypto by trapping him in one of his gas chambers in the Treen city.\n\nThe Mekon would then from Crypto’s corpse create a plague that unravelled the DNA of the Furons and launched it at all of the most important planets in the Furon empire. Billions of Furons were slaughtered, and their forces were forced to retreat from earth to try and hold on to what little power they could. Orthopox and the new Crypto vowed revenge, but within a few years thanks to the Mekon’s influence the Furon empire completely collapsed as more and more of their enemies would get hold of the Mekon’s plague. Over the next few hundred years, the last of the Furons would struggle just to stay alive.\n\nWith the Furons out of the way, the Mekon launched his Elektrobots at the earth. The Elektrobots however were no match for earth’s giant monsters.\n\nJust as they had always done, Godzilla, Jiras, King Kong, Anguirus, Gorosaurus, and Rodan fought to protect the earth and slaughtered thousands of the Mekon’s robot warriors.\n\nEventually however the Mekon was able to defeat the monsters by using knockout gas on the monsters on Monsterland. Whilst they were asleep, the Treens would abduct the monsters and take them to a small planet, just outside the solar system.\n\nThere the Mekon would attempt to find a way to control them, but the monsters after waking up destroyed the Mekon’s base on the planet. The Mekon would attempt to set up another but the Monsters proved to be too difficult to control, and eventually the Mekon would abandon the project as he had more important matters.\n\nGodzilla, King Kong, Anguirus, Gorosaurus, Jiras and the rest of earth’s monsters would continue to live on this world for over 1000 years afterwards (with their mutated DNA allowing them to live for so long.) Long after the Mekon’s invasion humanity would continue to leave them on what would eventually be christened, monster world. Despite the monsters many heroic actions, humanity felt they were more trouble than they were worth, and so they would be left on this planet in peace (though they would return to earth for later battles.)\n\nWith the monsters gone, humanity lost its advantage. The Elektrobots and the Treen warships massacred Earth’s defences and conquered their entire world in a few months.\n\nOver 5 billion people were killed in the Treen invasion. It was the single most devastating event in human history at that point.\n\nFry survives the Treens invasion of New York, which was destroyed in the process. The reason the Treens spared this building was because they wanted to examine the humans who were frozen, with the Mekon believing that they must be special if humanity had preserved them.\n\nAfter the surrender of humanity, the survivors would be rounded up into concentration camps and ghettos around the world. The Mekon forced humanity to build more advanced robots known as Selektrobots and weapons that would allow him to conquer other planets beyond our solar system.\n\nThe Mekon soon built up a large empire thanks to his robots.\n\nThe Elektrobots and Selektrobots, the weapons the Mekon used to conquer the earth and various other worlds across the universe.\n\nThe Mekon would also perform various experiments on his enslaved humans, with another 3 billion people dying in agony over the next 10 years the Mekon ruled over the earth.\n\nReign of the Robots\n\nAfter 10 years in space, Dan discovers to his horror that the Mekon has conquered humanity.\n\nUpon arriving back on earth, Dan and his team were instantly captured by the Elektrobots who took them to face the Mekon.\n\nThe Mekon told Dan with glee how he had conquered humanity and how they were now his slaves. He planned to make Dan his servant however rather than simply kill him.\n\nThe Mekon was angry when he found out that Dan was lost in space after his conquest of earth. Despite claiming to have elevated himself above emotion, the Mekon wanted to make Dan suffer. He hated him above all of his other enemies such as the Doctor, Gamera, the Furons and Godzilla.\n\nIn the years the Mekon ruled over the earth, Dan would become an icon to humanity. The man who had beaten the Mekon three times and who was now lost. Many hoped that he would one day return and overthrow the green tyrant.\n\nThe Mekon knew that if Dan ever did return then he couldn’t just kill him, as Dan would become a martyr to the cause of the earth men. So he decided that he would crush what was left of their spirit by forcing Dan to serve him.\n\nTo accomplish this, the Mekon abducted those he knew were closest to Dan, including Sir Hubert, and Peabody and kept them in suspended animation for 10 years so that he could use them as leverage to make Dan obey him and renounce the resistance, should he ever return.\n\nSure enough when Dan saw his friends in the Mekon’s care he had no choice but to obey the Mekon’s will, and the Mekon would send Dan and his friends to work in his harshest labour camp.\n\nHowever whilst in the camp, Dan was able to make contact with the last tiny pocket of resistance and with their and Sondar’s help (Sondar was serving as a double agent for earth within the Mekon’s head quarters.) Dan was able to discover how the Mekon controlled his robots.\n\nHe had a speaker in his levitating chair which he gave the Elektrobots their orders through. After a confrontation with the Mekon, Flamer was able to give the Elekrtobots new orders to turn on and destroy one another.\n\nWith the entire invasion force of robots destroyed, humanity and the aliens on the other worlds the Treens had conquered overthrew them. The Treens numbers were small and they had only been able to maintain their rule through the robots. Whilst most of the Treens had sided with the Mekon at first, as time went on many of the Treens who had begun to develop emotions under Sondars rule found it hard to repress them again and carry out the Mekon’s ruthless orders.\n\nThe Mekon would have all “traitors” executed by his robots and slaughtered millions of his own people, but many survived and would form a resistance movement with Sondar. Either through desertion or execution however, the Treens numbers had been greatly depleted by the Mekons actions, resulting in those who remained loyal to the Tyrant being forced to rely on their robots.\n\nThe Mekon however was not beaten yet. He had a special back up army of Selektrobots who were far more powerful, and intended to use them to not only reconquer planets such as the earth, but also carry out a mass slaughter of billions on every world to crush any further hope of rebellion.\n\nDan however was able to pilot one of his vessels into the space station the Mekon used to control the Selektrobots, eliminating the entire Selektrobot invasion fleet and ending the Mekon’s rule over the earth.\n\nThe Mekon was captured by human and Theron forces, but whilst on Venus he managed to escape by flying over the molten lake the Silicon Mass lived in. The Mekon was seemingly killed when the Mass consumed his vessel. In truth however he managed to teleport to safety at the right moment. He wanted to fake his death at the right moment and in a way where they wouldn’t expect to find a body.\n\nAs it was, Dan still didn’t believe his archenemy was gone and would insist on the Mekon remaining at the top of the most wanted list in the solar system. The Mekon would subsequently lay low for the next few years as he slowly rebuilt his forces.\n\nAll of the Treens who were loyal to the Mekon were imprisoned (on some of the worlds they had conquered however the Treens were executed.) Sondar would once again be appointed as the head of the Treen state on Venus.\n\nNot all of the Elektrobots had been destroyed, but they had all been deactivated. The Elektrobots would later be reactivated and reprogrammed to aid humanity. The technology from the Elektrobots would later serve as the basis for the robots of the 31st century.\n\nIt took mankind many years to recover, but ironically the decades after the Mekon’s invasion would be more prosperous. Mankind would unite with the various worlds who had been conquered by the Mekon and together they would form a small federation of planets who would all help each other rebuild their fallen civilisations.\n\nOver the next few decades mankind would expand beyond the solar system and advance like never before.\n\nThe Phantom Fleet\n\nIn the year 2069 mankind would face yet another threat from space. The Pescods, a race of ocean dwelling creatures from a far away planet who had created a virus that could eat metal. Humanity was given a warning of their coming by a race known as the Cosmobes whose entire planet had been destroyed by the Pescods.\n\nThe Cosmobes were a tiny race of fish like creatures who wanted to live in the oceans of earth. Their population was small, and their small size and aquatic nature meant that they would not compete for resources.\n\nHumanity was still unsure about allowing an alien race to co-inhabit the earth. Whilst they had established a peaceful contact with various other races, humanity had never willingly shared the planet with another species before.\n\nStill the Cosmobes proved themselves by helping Dan, Digby and Peabody destroy the oncoming Pescod fleet (though not before both humanity and the Treens endured heavy casualties from the Pescods virus that destroyed dozens of warships.)\n\nThe Cosmobes would mostly keep themselves to themselves under the ocean, but they would aid humanity at various points over the next several decades.\n\nBy the year 2070 a base on the moon had been established which helped to regulate the weather on earth for humanity’s benefit. Unfortunately in 2070, a group of Cybermen would attack and invade the Moonbase in the hopes of using it to destroy all of humanity.\n\nThese Cybermen were survivors from the 2020s war. Low on power, they had been forced to go into hibernation for years to reserve it, but now they were ready to launch their counter attack.\n\nThey would have succeeded had it not been for the intervention of the Second Doctor who was able to destroy the Cyberfleet by whisking them away into the sun. A few of the Cybermen survived however and fled across the galaxy to find a new base.\n\nEventually they settled on the isolated planet of Telos that was inhabited by a race of creatures known as the Cryons, a peaceful race who had adapted to the cold atmosphere of Telos and when the planet’s atmosphere began to rise on the surface, the Cryons built a gigantic city with refrigeration units to survive.\n\nSadly this was the reason the Cybermen would target their people, as they needed the refrigerator units to preserve their low power. The Cybermen would virtually wipe the Cryons out and preserve themselves in the Cryon’s chambers, though before they froze themselves, they set up a series of traps to not only protect themselves but ensnare those with the highest intellects to be converted once the Cybermen had reached full power.\n\nThroughout the 2070s and 80s mankind would establish colonies on various worlds throughout the galaxy. Still they would be forced to endure many threats chief among them being of course the Mekon, who would create a new race of mutant Treens who were physically incapable of any kind emotion and far more physically powerful. The Mekon first attacked Venus with his new supertreens. He wanted to exterminate what he regarded as the previous inferior race of Treens, who he was ashamed of.\n\nDan however was able to save Venus from the Mekon, but once again the villain managed to escape justice.\n\nThe Mekon would later work with Davros, who had escaped the destruction of the time travelling Dalek mothership in 1963 through an escape pod, but the blast still knocked him over 100 years into the future. Davros’ escape pod was captured by the Treens and taken to the Mekon.\n\nDavros simply wanted to return to his home time, but the pod he escaped in had been damaged. The Mekon offered to give Davros the resources and equipment he needed if he helped him.\n\nWith no other choices Davros agreed and together Davros and the Mekon would create a race of hideous, gigantic, carnivorous blob creatures that they would used to decimate several worlds and launch an invasion of earth. The 7th Doctor and Dan Dare working together were able to destroy most of the Mekon and Davros’ creations, though Davros subsequently fled with some of the Mekon’s equipment and would later be able to travel to the future.\n\nA few of Davros and the Mekon’s mutants would survive however in the jungles of Venus. Whilst the Therons were able to keep their population under control, they did not wipe them out and the blobs over the years would develop a greater intelligence thanks to further, unintended mutations. They would come to live in peace with their fellow Venusians for thousands of years to come.\n\nA descendant of the Mekon and Davros’ mutant blobs in the 31st century. Though they would come to live in peace with their fellow Venusians and other races, they still always remained a somewhat naturally aggressive species.\n\nIn the 2080s whilst exploring beyond our solar system, Dan would encounter the former despot named Xel. Whilst Dan would prevent Xel from reconquering his home world, unfortunately the monster would stow away on board Dan’s ship. The villain would make many attempts to conquer the earth, and even partnered with the Mekon on one occasion.\n\nDan would always stop him but he would never bring Xel to justice and he always felt immense guilt over having inadvertently brought the former tyrant to the earth’s solar system.\n\nXel, one of Dan Dare’s greatest enemies and the second most wanted man in the earth solar system after the Mekon.\n\nDan Dare’s adventures in the 21st century would come to an end in the year 2088 when he had one last encounter with the Mekon.\n\nBy this time Dan had retired from spacefleet, but he and Digby would be called back into action when the Mekon, and the last of his Treens captured a space station which they intended to crash into the earth.\n\nDan and Digby as ever were able to foil the Mekon’s plan, but Dan was mortally wounded and put into a coma in the process.\n\nWhilst Digby was able to get help, sadly it was too late and there was nothing anybody could do for Dan. Not wanting to lose the greatest hero of the 21st century, Spacefleet would have Dan placed into suspend animation alongside the others in the cryo lab such as Fry until something could be done to help him. Ultimately he would remain there for close to 200 years before medical science could properly revive him.\n\nThe Mekon meanwhile was successfully captured and put on trial. Crowds of people on earth called for the monsters blood and his trial had to be conducted in secret for his own safety.\n\nThe earth authorities decided to imprison the Mekon in a cylinder at the end of the solar system. He would remain trapped there for close to one year, before the last of his loyal Treen guards were able to rescue him, by blasting the cylinder through space to an uninhabited planet far beyond the federation the earth was a part of.\n\nThe Treens would track the Mekon down and free him. Knowing they could not return to the Federation, the Mekon and the Treens would build their forces up slowly over the next few decades.\n\nThe Mekon would create a new empire covering multiple solar systems. By the mid 22nd century he would have been more than powerful enough to conquer the Federation (though the Federation was at that point ruled by the Daleks, the Mekon’s empire was actually bigger than the Dalek empire at that point too.)\n\nHowever before the Mekon could launch his attack on earth, he came into conflict with a race of shapeshifting Ape like creatures known as the Krulgans.\n\nThe Krulgans had themselves built up a massive empire and were every bit as evil and ruthless as the Treens. The two races war would last for close to 100 years and would see the destruction of both empires. Once his empire had fallen, the Mekon would retreat back to the earth solar system in the late 23rd century where he would once again come into conflict with a revived Dan Dare, though more on that later.\n\nWith the Mekon gone, the federation would enjoy a period of peace for the next few decades, though it would have to deal with a few more threats towards the end of the 21st Century.\n\nIn the year 2090 a group of renegade Ice Warriors would attempt to conquer the earth using the moonbase. They were opposed by the Second Doctor who was able to divert their invasion force into the sun.\n\nIn the year 2099 an earth colony on the distant world of Vulcan would encounter a far flung group of Daleks lost in time and space.\n\nThese Daleks had been performing time travel experiments in an attempt to try and capture the Doctor. The time machine had gone off course however and crashed landed into the Mercury swamps on Vulcan.\n\nThe Daleks lost their power and went into a state of hibernation for many centuries before the earth colony discovered them.\n\nVulcan was the most distant earth colony and had been cut off from earth more or less for the past 15 or so years.\n\nThe colony had been experiencing problems for years thanks to a group of rebels. When the Daleks were discovered by a scientist named Lesterson, he hoped that they could be used to help fix the colonies problems.\n\nLesterson had no idea what the Daleks were really capable of and assumed they were just harmless robots. The Second Doctor meanwhile who had landed on Vulcan after his recent regeneration tried to warn Lesterson, but sadly he wasn’t the only person on the colony who foolishly thought they could use the Daleks.\n\nThe rebels hoped to use them as an army to overrun the colony, as did Bragan one of the higher ups on the colony who wanted more power.\n\nThe Daleks, despite the Doctors best efforts were able to manipulate the humans on the colony into giving them the materials they needed to build up a massive army of Daleks, who proceeded to slaughter most of the colonists.\n\nFortunately before they could exterminate everyone on the colony or make their way to the other planets in the federation, the Doctor was able to destroy the Daleks by giving them a power overload.\n\nOne Dalek survived however and would later return to Skaro in the future, where it informed its superiors of the Doctors change of appearance.\n\n22nd Century\n\nHumanity faces an enemy even more evil than the Mekon in the 22nd Century\n\nOne of the many advances earth would make in the early part of the 22nd century was the development of of sophisticated Holograms.\n\nThese Holograms were not only full, lifelike projections of human beings, but the disk that projected them, their light bee was capable of full consciousness. Furthermore humanity would also find a way to download a humans memories onto a hard drive in the early part of the 22nd century, meaning that once this disk was merged with the Hologram’s light bee, it could effectively allow a person to survive as a Hologram.\n\nOnly a few Hologram’s were created however as the technology was expensive. Only the super rich would be able to download their memories onto hard drives before they died. Even then however many of them did not wish to become hologram’s as they couldn’t touch one anything. Their bodies were still composed entirely of light.\n\nAttempts were made to try and build a hard light drive, but sadly the Federation would never succeed in developing the software.\n\nIn the year 2120 a group of Elite holograms would be sent out on various deep space missions on Holoships, with their objection being to explore the universe.\n\n12 Holoships would be created and dispatched. Almost every Hologram volunteered for the mission. On a Holoship the Holograms could eat, drink and interact with their environment as it was all simulated. Only the most elite were chosen however.\n\nAll the Holoships would become lost in deep space, but at least one was shown to have survived for 3 million years into the future, where it was still exploring. One Holoship however would be infected with the Holovirus and its crew would go completely insane and cause havoc across the universe.\n\nDuring the early years of the 22nd century, for the first time mankind felt secure and safe in the universe, but sadly it was not to last.\n\nThroughout the 22nd century mankind would be forced to battle the greatest evil it had ever faced, the Dalek Empire.\n\nThis was the original Dalek Empire, made up of Zolfian and Yarvelling’s, rather than Davros’ Daleks. They had already conquered and destroyed many worlds by this stage, including Alvega.\n\nThe Daleks first came into contact with humanity (from their perspective) in the 2110s when a stray human space ship named The Guardian accidentally wandered into the Dalek’s area of space.\n\nThe Guardian had been sent to exterminate an infestation of Krynoids on the planet Arides. When the Daleks captured the crew, they intended to exterminate them, but the Guardian’s captain Kirid was able to trick the Emperor of the Daleks by convincing him that the Krynoids were a threat to the Daleks as well.\n\nKirid tricks the Emperor.\n\nThe Emperor however eventually found out about Kirid’s deception and though the Guardian was able to eliminate the Krynoid infestation, the Daleks ultimately destroyed the Guardian. Kirid could have escaped the Daleks, but he willingly sacrificed himself to stop the Krynoids.\n\nThe Emperor of the Daleks took note of humanity during this encounter considering them to potentially be a threat, and the next year yet another earth vessel would stray into the Daleks territory.\n\nThe Starmaker, which unlike the Kirid was merely a cruise space ship, crash landed on Skaro after it was blown off course.\n\nAll of the crew except for Captain Fleet and two small children, Tom and Jennie were exterminated. Worst of all however the Daleks were able to discover the location of earth from the starships remains and soon made plans to claim it as their own.\n\nFleet did manage to escape to earth and warn humanity of the Daleks, but sadly nothing could prepare them for what was coming.\n\nIn the 2020s the Daleks would pilot their own planet into the Federations area of space. The Daleks had earlier experimented with moving worlds with the planet Skardal.\n\nThe Daleks had attached a giant motor to the molten core of Skaro effectively turning Skaro into a giant spaceship.\n\nUpon arriving in our solar system, the Daleks would launch successful invasions of the earth colonies on Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. They attempted to launch an invasion of Venus, but the combined might of earth, the Therons and the Treens would push them back (though not without enduring heavy casualties.)\n\nOn Saturn, three siblings, Jeff, Andy and Mary Stone would succeed in starting a rebellion that drove the Daleks out of the planet.\n\nThe Daleks were able to hold off the combined might of the other worlds of the Federation and remained in the earth solar system for 10 years. This period became known as the first Dalek war, and it saw the deaths of over 15 billion people from the combined worlds against the Daleks.\n\nEarth had many notable victories against the Daleks such as when the Stone siblings where able to infiltrate Skaro and discovered the plans for many of their weapons.\n\nHowever the Daleks ultimately won out and would have invaded and destroyed the earth and indeed the entire Federation had it not been for the intervention of the Time Lady Romana. Then in her 5th incarnation, Romana helped the Stones prevent the Daleks from using their ultimate weapon, the Giostrak ray.\n\nThe Giostrak ray specifically attacked the molten core of each world. Whilst the Daleks had the upper hand in the war, they knew that they didn’t have the power to conquer each world, and so they decided to cleanse the entire galaxy of life. The Giostrak rays were invisible to the human eye, but they could travel across space and they would heat the core of a world to such an extent that they would eventually explode. The Daleks used them to destroy dozens of worlds in the Federation, and wreck havoc on various others including earth.\n\nHumanity even surrendered to the Daleks, with their ray causing mass earthquakes and volcanoes to erupt, but the Daleks continued to fire the ray.\n\nFortunately with Romana’s help the last tiny pocket of resistance were able to break into Skaro and destroy the weapon. Sadly both Jeff and Andy were killed in the process.\n\nThe Giostrak ray had taken decades to build and furthermore before its destruction, Romana had used the ray to attack the core of Skaro itself causing volcano’s and earthquakes to devastate the entire planet.\n\nThe Daleks were in no state to take on the combined forces of the Federation so they fled our galaxy.\n\nRomana 5 saves humanity from the Daleks in the early 22nd century.\n\nThe Dalek Invasion\n\nThe darkest period of human history begins.\n\nThe Great Dalek War had devastated the Federation, but by 2050 mankind and the other worlds had begun to recover. Sadly however so had the Daleks.\n\nThe Daleks had found another way to conquer worlds without actually attacking them directly. Chemical warfare.\n\nDuring their war with humanity the Daleks had taken several human prisoners. These poor souls had sadly not been rescued during the final attack on Skaro and the metal monsters would continue to experiment on their captives for decades to come.\n\nThey attempted to turn some of their captive humans into slaves by mutating their bodies. They created several hideous flesh eating monsters who were conditioned to be totally loyal to the Daleks.\n\nThe Daleks would also perform horrific experiments on their human prisoners brains. They wiped their minds and cut pieces of their brains out, turning them into mindless drones, called Robomen. Unlike their mutant servants, the Robomen were unstable and would break down regularly. Still they could last for several months and would be useful foot soldiers for the Daleks.\n\nWorst of all however the Daleks would create a powerful plague from experimenting on their human captives.\n\nThe Daleks knew that any missiles would be shot down, so they hid their plague inside a shower of small meteorites which they fired at the earth.\n\nThe plague quickly spread throughout the earth and to its outer colonies. Earth and its colonies soon became quarrantined by the rest of the Federation, as all of the worlds desperately struggled to find a cure. The plague however would still spread to the planets beyond the earth’s area of space in the Federation to the point where only the outer worlds of the Federation were able to remain safe.\n\nTwo groups of humans however were able to escape the devastation of their world. These humans were chosen as part of a project in order to make sure that humanity would survive in case no cure was found. Several thousand uninfected humans were to be kept in suspended animation (as the journey would take over a century) in two ships that would travel to a far away galaxy known as the Isera Galaxy.\n\nAs much as the Federation wanted to help humanity, they couldn’t risk the plague getting loose in the universe, and so they tried to stop the vessels from escaping the earth. In the fight where several brave earth men gave their lives against both the Daleks and the Federation, the vessels would manage to escape the galaxy. One of the two ships was badly damaged however and would drift off course for over three million years with its crew in suspended animation.\n\nThe other ship would make its way to the Isera Galaxy. Neither the Federation, nor the Daleks knew where the vessel was going, and they were too busy with other more important matters to follow it. No one would ever venture into the Isera Galaxy as it was dead and of no value to any other race. Even strategically it was too remote.\n\nThus when the humans arrived there 100 years later in the 23rd century they would be able to establish several colonies in peace from any alien life. Their terrorforming equipment allowed them to bring life to the dead worlds of the Isera Galaxy and make the planets habitable again.\n\nOver the centuries they would spent in the Isera Galaxy, myths would develop around the earth. Only a few historical records survived, and gradually as mankind failed to encounter any alien life in the dead Isera Galaxy, many came to believe that the Daleks were a myth and that mankind had simply left the earth due to overpopulation.\n\nThe hundreds of earth colonies in the Isera Galaxy would later be united under the alliance of planets in the 24th century, though 200 years later this would lead to a civil war with the Browncoats attempting to gain independence for their worlds. The war which lasted for ten years ended in a victory for the Alliance, though there would be still be several supporters for independence, such as most notably Malcolm Reynolds, the captain of the ship Serenity.\n\nThe Alliance would endure for several hundred years until it would be rediscovered by the earth in the 29th century and became part of the earth empire.\n\nThe vessel that drifted 3 million years into deep space meanwhile eventually collided with an asteroid which damaged the preservation chambers, reviving the crew.\n\nThese humans 3 million years into the future would build an empire in deep space cut off from the rest of humanity. They would create various mutants, Mechanoids and robots known as Simulants in Deep Space to serve them. (They would also continue to develop Hologram techonology, eventually cracking the secret of a hard light drive.)\n\nAfter 1000 or so years however the Simulants and the Gelfs would overthrow their human masters and slaughter most of them as well as most other life forms in that Galaxy, though we will be covering this period of human history in a greater detail later.\n\nThe Daleks quickly launched their invasion at the Federation once it had become scattered and weak thanks to their plague.\n\nThe last of humanity on earth would eventually discover a cure to the plague mere weeks before the final Dalek invasion of the earth in the year 2167, but by that point humanity had endured so many casualties that they were in no position to take on the Daleks.\n\nAll of the earth colonies were either destroyed or under the Daleks rule by this stage, as were most other worlds in the Federation apart from those on the very outskirts who had mounted an effective defence against the Daleks.\n\nAttempts were made by the surviving planets on the outskirts of the Federation to reach the earth and gain access to the cure so that they could then fight the Daleks, but sadly as the Daleks had conquered the rest of the Federation, then every Federation ship that tried to make it to the earth was shot down.\n\nMonster World was right within the outskirts of the Federation and so the Federation would attempt to use the likes of Godzilla, King Kong, Jirass and Anguirus to fight back against the Daleks. They had a few victories at first, but the Daleks would soon create giant monsters of their own by fusing several of their mutations together. They also mutated several of the giant Dinosaur like creatures on their world.\n\nGodzilla and the rest of earth’s monsters were eventually defeated by the Daleks and their army of giant monsters. Godzilla slaughtered hundreds of the Daleks and their mutations, but ultimately there too many of them for the monsters to fight. The Daleks weapons were far more advanced than any other race of aliens Godzilla had ever faced and could hurt the monsters too. Some of earth’s monsters would be slaughtered by the Daleks.\n\nGodzilla, Jirass, King Kong, Anguirus, Rodan and Gorosaurus would subsequently be used to help defend the last planets in the Federation.\n\nWithin Earth’s solar system meanwhile, the Mercurians would be easily conquered by the Daleks, whilst the Therons and the Treens managed to place a gigantic forcefield around Venus. The forcefield kept the Daleks out, but sadly the Therons and the Treens were not strong enough to take the Daleks on either. The Daleks war fleet dwarfed the Treens and the Therons combined.\n\nStill the Treens and the Therons did at first try and fight the Daleks off when they launched their first direct attack on the earth, but they were hopelessly outnumbered.\n\nSondar, who still commanded over the Treens at this point in their history personally led the attack against the Dalek fleet, but after his entire garrison was destroyed he was forced to flee. Unable to return to Venus as the forcefield was placed almost immediately after the Treen and Theron fleet lost. Sondar would be forced to go on the run for the next decade.\n\nSondar would amass a group of rebels from conquered planets and colonies all over the Federation. They would cause trouble for the Daleks, and even manage to ship supplies of humanities cure to the still free outskirts of the Federation.\n\nSadly however the Daleks would eventually within the first 12 years of their rule over earth and the other worlds in the Federation, track the rebels down and kill them all except for Sondar who managed to escape thanks to the actions of the 12th Doctor, who Sonder would then join on his journey’s through time and space for many years.\n\nAs much as they couldn’t bare it the Treens and the Therons were forced to remain trapped on Venus for the next few decades, watching helplessly as humanity suffered under the Daleks rule.\n\nThe Daleks laid waste to most of earth’s cities in their final attack on earth. London, Paris, Rome, and New York were completely devastated by the Daleks saucers.\n\nThe Daleks lay waste to New York. After the Mekon invasion of earth, New York was made the location of the new earth government with its retro design, and as result it was one of the first cities to be destroyed by the Daleks. Once again the cryogenics lab was spared, as the Daleks wished to use the humans as test subjects. Fry and Captain Dan were among the lucky few to survive by chance.\n\nBefore the Dalek invasion the population of earth was at the highest it would ever be. Over 70 billion people lived on the earth. On all of the earth colonies combined meanwhile, there were over 400 billion people. After the Dalek invasion however less than 100 million humans survived overall and that number would drop over the next 30 years the Daleks would rule over earth and the other planets in the Federation to barely over 10 million.\n\nThe Cosmobes would also be almost driven to extinction by the Daleks. Being more advanced than mankind they put up a better fight than humanity, but the Daleks would destroy the civilisation they had built under the ocean.\n\nThey would continue to send troops under the water to hunt for surviving Cosmobes throughout the rest of their time on earth. Only a very few Cosmobes would manage to survive.\n\nA Dalek emerges from a river after hunting a Cosmobe in the later years of their occupation of earth.\n\nOne group of Cosmobes managed to set up a sanctuary under the ocean for humans. This city was built from the ruins of city called Atlanta. The Daleks had sunk into the ocean during their attack.\n\nIn order to survive under the ocean the Cosmobes would fuse their DNA with the humans giving them the appearance of Mermaids.\n\nThe humans would continue to live in Atlanta safe from the Daleks (with the city being at the very bottom of the ocean floors.) After the Dalek invasion when the Cosmobes would decide to flee earth, the “Mermaids” would continue to live in Atlanta until the 31st century. During that time however several legends would develop about how the city had survived\n\nThe Daleks only kept that tiny percentage of humans alive because they found humanity to be the most useful servants and lab rats. It was easier for the Daleks to mould the DNA of humans, allowing the Daleks to turn them into their mutant servants, and reshape their bodies in other ways that made them more useful slaves and foot soldiers in their wars with other races.\n\nOther races however who they couldn’t mutate as easily, and who were deemed too troublesome, the Daleks simply exterminated. The Daleks whenever they invaded a planet would always evaluate the dominant race. If they could be of use as a slave labour force, or as grunts to use in later wars, or if their planets were of any use then they would be kept alive for the time being, but if not, then the Daleks would completely destroy the surface of the planet completely.\n\nHumanity simply lucked out in that not only were they useful test subjects for the Daleks, but the earth also had many natural resources that were of use to them too.\n\nThere were over 600 worlds with life on them in the area of the Federation the Daleks conquered (including all of the colonies.) Only 20 including the earth would remain by the end of their 30 year rule.\n\nThe Daleks conquer humanity by launching a plague which decimates the Federation, except for the outer colonies. After fending off the Therons and the Treens who are forced to retreat to Venus, a weakened Earth is then easily overrun by the Dalek invasion force.\n\nRule of the Daleks\n\nThe darkest days for mankind.\n\nFor the next 30 years the Daleks would rule over the earth and the other worlds in the Federation.\n\nThe conquest of the Federation had helped to expand the Dalek empire like never before. Prior to their war with humanity the first Dalek empire had managed to claim a few solar systems of isolated planets, but this marked the first time they had brought down a major power in the galaxy. The Daleks would subsequently expand over the next 30 years to claim more solar systems and a few smaller empires.\n\nEarth along with most of the planets they had conquered were turned into giant factories at first to create weapons, more Daleks, and more mutant servants.\n\nA gigantic lab was built over the ruins of New York where the Daleks continued to mutate more humans into monsters to serve them in their war against other life forms.\n\nAfter 10 or so years of experiments, the Dalek scientists would create a horrific form of green slime which would twist the human body into a hideous mutated form. Not all of these mutants were powerful however, and those who were of no use to the Daleks would be vaporised.\n\nIn the year 2180 a resistance group would destroy the Daleks lab over New York. It wouldn’t set the Daleks back by much as they had other facilities on the other earth colonies the Daleks had conquered.\n\nStill the mutanagenic slime was not destroyed. It would sip into the sewers and ruins of old New York below. Not all of the Daleks mutants were destroyed either and many of them would retreat to the ruins of old New York to escape the Daleks. Over the next almost two decades of the Daleks rule more survivors would come to live under New York to escape the Dalek. These humans would be abducted by the mutants and dipped into the Daleks slime which came to flow through the ruins like a river. Just as the mutants were shunned by humanity then the mutants came to despise all normal people and would only allow them to enter the sewers if they were mutants.\n\nThe mutants would survive for hundreds of years after the Dalek invasion below New New York that would be built over the ruins of the old one. Over time they would become a more peaceful people and develop a thriving society. Their existence would be discovered by the surface world in the 27th century by the government who would regard them as inferior scum. It wouldn’t be until the 31st century however when they were finally granted equal rights and able to live on the surface thanks to the actions of Turanga Leela (a sewer mutant who had lived on the surface for her entire life as she had passed as an alien.)\n\nThe sewer mutants in the 31st century, the descendants of the mutants created by the Daleks in the 22nd century.\n\nThe Daleks would force the rest of their human slaves to mine the earth for materials and resources to build more weapons and space ships. Aside from creating mutants to police their camps, the Daleks would create more Robomen.\n\nDuring the middle of the Daleks rule over the Federation, they came into serious conflict with the Mechanoids. (Who they had had a few more minor skirmishes with before.)\n\nThe Mechanoids were a race of highly advanced robots from a far away star system. They had been created by a galactic union of worlds to store information about the entire history of their galaxy (and many others that their creators had visited.)\n\nThe Mechanoids were essentially mini libraries that could hold a virtually unlimited amount of information. Unfortunately the Mechanoids would develop sentience and armed with the knowledge of the entire galaxy, they were able to take control of it in no time, and from there they would build a massive empire.\n\nThe Mechanoids believed in conquest as after learning the history of various worlds they had become fascinated with how some races were able to conquer others and relive their burdens through them. The Mechanoids wanted that power for themselves and they believed having studied the history of so many empires that they could avoid their mistakes.\n\nThe Mechanoids first came into conflict with the Daleks during the early days of the Daleks empire. The Mechanoids had the obvious advantage technologically speaking, but the Daleks were soon able to become a match for the Mechanoids as they slowly built their empire up. A war almost broke out between them. Both races however decided on an uncharacteristic truce until one could gain an advantage.\n\nWith the Dalek empire now having gained a huge advantage in the conquest of the Federation, the Daleks launched an attack against the Mechanoids. The Daleks had the advantage at first, but the Mechanoids were able to form an alliance with the surviving outer planets of the Federation and various other powers, many of whom had become terrified of the Daleks after the destruction of the Federation.\n\nThe Daleks soon found themselves outmatched against such a large alliance. In desperation they turned to the planet earth itself. The Daleks intended to remove its core completely and replace it with a giant motor and death ray attached, one capable of vaporising an entire planet. They had been working on this ray for decades, before the monsters had even conquered the earth.\n\nOur planet was to become the greatest weapon of the Daleks, allowing them to destroy the Mechanoids and their allies and spread their empire even further across the universe.\n\nThere were still some small human resistance groups scattered around the earth that had caused some minor trouble for the Daleks over the course of the 30 years they had ruled the earth.\n\nBy the year 2197 however, almost all of these resistance groups had either been crushed or given up. All hope for humanity seemed lost.\n\nThe Fall of the Daleks\n\n“They dare to tamper with the forces of creation. They dare, and we have got to dare to stop them.”\n\nIn late 2197, as the Daleks were preparing to finish turning the earth into their super weapon, their greatest enemy, the Doctor would arrive on earth.\n\nThe Doctor was in his first incarnation, and was actually intending to take his two human companions Ian and Barbara back to their time in 60s London. Sadly as always, his unpredictable time machine had taken him too far into the future.\n\nThe Doctor and his companions explored the ruins of London, but whilst the Doctor and Ian were examining the corpse of a Roboman, Barbara and Susan were abducted by possibly the final resistance group in all of Britain.\n\nThey told Barbara and Susan that it was not safe out on the streets as the Dalek and Robomen patrols were searching for survivors. Sadly before they realised the danger they were in the Doctor and Ian were captured by the Daleks.\n\nBack at the saucer, the Doctor and Ian found out to their horror how the Daleks had conquered humanity. The Doctor would attempt to escape from the Daleks clutches, but the monsters were testing him and monitoring the Time Lord to see if he was a threat, and as soon as the Doctor got out of his cell the Daleks instantly ambushed and prepared to robotize the Time Lord.\n\nThe last group of rebels meanwhile were preparing to launch their final attack on the saucer. The rebels were led by a man named Dortmun, a scientist who for years had attempted to build a weapon that could harm the Daleks. He believed he had finally constructed a weapon that could shatter their casing, a new kind of bomb.\n\nSadly the bomb ultimately had no affect against the Daleks, but the rebel attack that night created enough of a diversion for the rebels to rescue some of the prisoners including the Doctor just before the Daleks could robotize him.\n\nThe rebels however were completely demoralized by the failed attack and many of them gave up, whilst others had were scattered across London after the attack to escape the Dalek and Robomen troops.\n\nOnly Barbara and a young girl named Jennie were able to return to the rebels HQ where they would try and help the crippled Dortmun escape through the Dalek infested London. Sadly however Dortmun, believing he was holding the girls back, sacrificed himself against the Daleks.\n\nBarbara, Dortmun and Jennie try and escape a Dalek infested London.\n\nBarbara and Jennie would make it to the countryside, but they would later be sold out by Dalek collaborators and taken to the camps.\n\nIan meanwhile after the attack on the saucer had managed to stow away on the Dalek saucer, alongside another rebel. The two made it to the main Dalek camp, where after an encounter with the Black Daleks most vicious pet mutant, the Slyther, Ian was able to climb up the Daleks main shaft to their base.\n\nAt the same time Barbara tricked the Daleks into taking her to their base to meet the Black Dalek, by claiming that she knew of a rebel plot to attack them (she used Dortmun’s old plans for his bomb as proof.)\n\nWhilst in their base, Barbara would discover the Daleks key weakness. They controlled all of their robomen with a single speaker in their headquarters. Barbara tried to take control of it and give the robomen new orders to turn on the Daleks, but sadly she failed and was captured again.\n\nThe Doctor meanwhile, working with Susan and a small group of rebels figured out what the Daleks were planning and sent Susan and a rebel named David to tamper with the Daleks main power source.\n\nThe Doctor knew from his previous experience with the Daleks that monsters couldn’t leave their metal city without the power dishes on their back. Susan and David were able to sabotage the Daleks power source, causing the Dalek machines to break down all over the world, whilst the Doctor with the aid of the rebels infiltrated the Daleks base and rescued Barbara. The Doctor would then give the robomen new orders to turn on and destroy the Daleks.\n\nAll over the world robomen started to attack the now vulnerable Daleks. Several of the Daleks human slaves in the camps also seized the opportunity and joined in attacking their former masters.\n\nWhilst the Daleks were being slaughtered by their own servants, Ian who had managed to crawl up the shaft they had intended to send their bomb down into the earth’s core, blocked up the shaft.\n\nWhen the bomb went off it destroyed the Dalek headquarters, with the Doctor, Ian, Barbara, and Susan having managed to get the slaves to safety first.\n\nMost of the Daleks were killed in the blast that consumed the headquarters, whilst the few survivors around the world were killed off by their own robomen, or died as a result of their power being sabotaged by Susan and David.\n\nMankind was free for the first time in 30 years thanks to the Doctors actions. Whilst the Doctor, Ian and Barbara prepared to leave, Susan had fallen in love with David during their adventure against the Daleks, and the Doctor, not wanting to stand in his grand daughters way. Told her to stay with David and build a new life on earth, her favourite planet before leaving in the TARDIS.\n\nAfter saving humanity from the Daleks, the Doctor bids Susan farewell.\n\nWith the Daleks plans to transform humanity into a weapon gone, the Daleks were forced to retreat from the Mechanoids and their allies. The weaponized earth was their last hope, and now they were completely outnumbered by their enemies. The Daleks retreated back to Skaro which in turn fled to the farthest reaches of the galaxy. The Daleks original empire had almost been almost completely destroyed.\n\n23rd Century\n\nOver the course of the 23rd century mankind would rebuild his devastated planet. It would take over 70 years for humanity to rebuild its cities and develop fully functioning societies again.\n\nMankind was assisted in rebuilding by the other surviving races of the Federation, their allies and also the Therons and the Treens who felt guilty at not being able to help the earth from the Daleks during their rule.\n\nLife on Venus had been hard during the Dalek’s rule. Many of the Treens had come to blame the Therons for their predicament arguing that if they had still been under the Mekon’s rule then they would have been strong enough to fight the Daleks and defeat them.\n\nThis would eventually lead to a civil war on the Treens side of the planet between the Mekon loyalists who believed they should try and find their former leader to lead them into battle against the Daleks, and those who still wanted to work with the Therons. The war killed millions of Treens and devastated entire cities, with the Theron loyal Treens eventually winning out.\n\nIn addition to this it took so much energy to power the forcefield that protected Venus from the Daleks, that there was very little power left over for anything else, forcing the Therons and the Treens to scrape on very few resources.\n\nOverpopulation on Venus prior to the Dalek invasion of earth also meant that Venus had become dependent on trade from other worlds which resulted in a mass starvation on the planet too.\n\nAlthough they hadn’t been invaded by the Daleks themselves, Venus was still left utterly devastated as a result of the Dalek invasion of the solar system, with 100s of millions of Therons and Treens having died from the combination of the wars and famine.\n\nVenus would need help itself to recover, but still even in its most desperate times, it would still supply aid to the earth in order to make up for its past inaction.\n\nSusan would also play a key role in helping the earth rebuild. Her advanced Time Lord intellect helped humanity to develop terrorforming equipment far more advanced than before. Susan eventually married David and had two children with him in the early part of the 23rd century, John and Gillian.\n\nAs John and Gillian were half Time Lord then they aged much slower than any human would, and so their father passed on before they were even teenagers. The two were still teenagers in the 2270s, despite being born in the early 23rd century.\n\nIn addition to help from other species, some pieces of technology from the Daleks had been left on the earth and other worlds after their invasion, and it would be salvaged and used to not only rebuild humanity, but advance it in some respects to greater levels than ever before by the 2270s.\n\nThe Mechanoids meanwhile were left devastated after the war with the Daleks. It would be their former allies however who would turn on the Mechanoids afterwards that would completely destroy their empire.\n\nThe various races who had worked with the Mechanoids and the surviving worlds of the Federation against the Daleks, knew that the Mechanoids were an evil, pitiless race of conquerors in some ways no better than the Daleks.\n\nWith the Mechanoids now at the weakest they had ever been, the allied planets didn’t want to waste a golden opportunity to eliminate this potential threat and so they turned on and attacked the Mechnoids. Completely unprepared and weak, the allied worlds were able to destroy what was left of the Mechanoids empire in no time and the few surviving Mechanoids would be forced to flee across the universe to try and rebuild.\n\nOne group of Mechanoids would come to settle on a jungle planet. These Mechanoids would later capture a stray a human named Steven Talyor in the early 24th century who had crashed onto their adopted planet (dubbed Mechanus.)\n\nThe Mechanoids would keep Steven Taylor prisoner for several years and perform various experiments on him in an effort to try and create a weapon to use against not just humanity but humanoid life forms in general. They managed to master several mind control techniques and even planted false memories in Steven’s head of the Mechanoids being simple service robots.\n\nSteven would later be rescued when the Doctor, Ian, Barbara and Vicki arrived on Mechanus. The foursome were being chased through time and space by the Daleks (these Daleks were from a later point in their history after they had discovered time travel.)\n\nThe Daleks and the Mechanoids would fight one another whilst Steven managed to slip out. The Doctor left behind a bomb which destroyed the entire Mechanoid city on the planet, killing all of the Daleks and Mechanoids.\n\nThe new Federation would be made up of the survivors of the old Federation and their former allies against the Daleks who together made up a larger power than the previous Federation ever was.\n\nAt first humanity was a small influence in this Federation but that would change over the next century.\n\nIn the early 2270s, Dan Dare would be revived from his cryogenic suspension. Thanks to the influence from various other worlds, humanity now had the technology to treat his injuries, though in order to do that they had to reconstruct his entire face, giving Dan a totally different appearance from before.\n\nCaptain Dan’s new appearance after the reconstructive surgery.\n\nDan Dare was revived more as a piece of propaganda than anything else. The new global government that had seized power after the Dalek invasion hoped that Dan, seen as the icon of the greatest era in human history could help win the people round.\n\nFrom the start however this plan would backfire on them. Dan frequently clashed with this government that was far more ruthless and xenophobic as a result of the Dalek invasion. Still throughout most of the 2270s, Dan would nevertheless serve them in the battle against the Daleks.\n\nSkaro had been forced to flee across the universe from the new Federation who wanted to crush the Daleks power completely. It eventually settled in a distant galaxy where the Daleks would begin to build up a small power base. However one of the races the Daleks had conquered would send out a distress signal that would be picked up by the Federation who were able to surround and corner the Daleks.\n\nThe Daleks were outmatched by the new Federation, but they were able to build up a strong defence against them. The war waged on for a few years, and the Daleks came close to developing a weapon that would have allowed them to destroy the Federation.\n\nThe weapon was designed to control the magnetic field in the milky way galaxy which would have allowed the Daleks to rip apart space ships and even planets from a distance.\n\nThe monsters had been working on the weapon on Skaro for many centuries, even before the end of their invasion of earth.\n\nCaptain Dan and the Doctors grand daughter Susan would working together, succeed in destroying the weapon (though not before the Daleks were able to use it to devastate several worlds in the Federation.)\n\nSusan had become disenchanted with the new earth government like Dan, but she still agreed to help them as the Daleks were obviously a greater evil.\n\nAfter the Daleks super weapon was destroyed, Susan and Dan would be hailed as heroes back home. Sadly the earth government would attempt to capture Susan and her two children. It hoped to discover what type of alien Susan was for its own purposes.\n\nThe earth government would perform several horrific experiments on Susan, but Captain Dan would rescue her and together they would free her children before exposing what was going on to the general public. The government would deny all responsibility, and those responsible were seemingly arrested (though in truth they would continue to work for the government for decades afterwards.)\n\nSusan decided to flee into deep space. She wasn’t scared for her own safety, but had to put her children first. Dan understood and he only stayed behind to try and expose more of the government’s dodgy dealings.\n\nSusan and her children would leave the Federation and explore the universe for many years, but sadly she and her children would later be attacked by Daleks who had travelled from the future (See part 2 of the history of N-Space for full details.)\n\nThe short war with the Daleks eventually came to an end in the year 2277, when the Daleks were attacked from within by an old enemy, the Thals.\n\nThe Thals had been forced underground by the Daleks many centuries ago just before the metal monsters had begun to build up their empire. The Thals had waited underground for the right time to strike, and now with all of the Daleks efforts spent simply defending themselves from the Federation, the Thals were able to strike at the monsters city. Catching them off guard they destroyed the Daleks main power source, causing all of their machines to break down.\n\nThe Daleks were put into a state of suspended animation. Back on earth there was almost a universal support for the Daleks to be exterminated whilst they were vulnerable. Ultimately the other worlds in the Federation did not want to carry out a genocide, and so they instead simply quarrantined Skaro off to prevent anyone from ever reactivating the Daleks.\n\nThe Thals meanwhile would try and rebuild the surface of their world.\n\nThe Biogs Invasion and The Mekon’s Return\n\nIn 2279 earth would be invaded by a race of hostile alien monsters known as the Biogs. The Biogs originated from the planet Zicron and their machines and weapons were made of flesh. They travelled the universes assimilating other creatures into their technology. They were commanded by the Mother Biog.\n\nThe monsters were directed to the earth by Dan Dare’s old archenemy, the Mekon. The Mekon’s empire had by this point crumbled and the monster sought to make the Federation its new base of operations.\n\nThe Mekon hoped that the Biogs would be destroyed by the combined forces of the Federation, but not before greatly weakening them, allowing the Mekon and his Treens to then emerge and take over in the aftermath.\n\nThe first planet in the Federation that the Mekon directed the Biogs to was the earth for no reason other than simply because of his intense hatred for mankind. (The Mekon had no idea that Dan had been revived at this point.)\n\nThe Biogs would set up their base on Jupiter which they prepared to attack the earth from. Dan however would be the first to discover its presence after losing a ship to the Biogs. At the time the head of the Space Corps accused Dan of losing the men through his own incompetence. They did not believe that there could be any life on Jupiter. They also did not particularly like or trust Dan, even with his status as a hero after foiling the Daleks with Susan. Dan Dare constantly questioned the Space Corp and the earth government’s methods. The head of the Space Corps was really looking for any excuse to get rid of Dan.\n\nDan would stow away on board another vessel passing by Jupiter called the Odyssey. which was piloted by a 5th generation Martian named Monday. Monday’s people were the descendants of the original earth colonists on Mars from the 21st century. Their colonies had been destroyed during the Dalek Invasion of Earth along with most of the of the rest of the earth colonies.\n\nA few of the human settlers on Mars however had managed to survive on the planets surface (which had long since had oxygen restored to it.) But they would be forced to live a desperate and nomadic existence throughout the years of the Dalek occupation of earth. In the last 70 years they had managed to rebuild, but centuries of living on Mars had altered their bodies somewhat to be larger and stronger.\n\nMonday discovered Dan not long after they had taken off, but fortunately the Martian was more open minded than those in the Space Corps and he took Dan’s warning seriously.\n\nDan and Monday, working together would battle the Biogs, but the monsters proved to be too powerful, and all of Monday’s crew but Dan, Monday, and Doctor Ziggy Rodan were devoured by the mutants.\n\nThe Space Corp would send a fleet to try and destroy the monsters, but they were all effortlessly destroyed by the Biogs.\n\nMonday however would manage to pilot the Odyssey straight into the heart of the Biogs mothership which managed to force it into the sun. Sadly however Monday was unable to escape in time and he too was consumed in the sun.\n\nMonday bravely sacrifices himself to save the earth from the evil Biogs.\n\nBack on earth Space Corps refused to reinstate Dan, or even acknowledge he been right about Jupiter, much to Doctor Rodan’s anger. Doctor Rodan and Dan would begin a relationship with each other that would last for a few more years until her apparent death.\n\nDan had suspected that the Biogs had been led to earth and with the help of a Werewolf named Rok he was able to track down the true culprit, the Mekon.\n\nAfter the failure of the Biogs invasion, the Mekon had teamed up with the notorious Two of Verath.\n\nThe Two of Verath were two of the worst criminals in the galaxy who were fused together as a punishment. Prior to being joined together, the two were sworn enemies.\n\nOne was a sadistic mass murderer, and another was a ruthless eugenicist. The two had since taken over a planet on the outskirts of the Federation where the worst criminals and the scum of the galaxy came to live.\n\nThe Mekon and the Two formed an alliance to disrupt the Federation’s economy, throwing it into anarchy, but in truth the Mekon attempted to double cross the Two. He hypnotised the Two, and implanted a bomb into their chest, capable of destroying a planet. (It was the last of the super weapons the Treen empire had developed in their war with the Krulgans.)\n\nThe Mekon intended to send the Two to attack the dominant race of the Federation’s home planet, where once they killed the Two, the bomb would go off. With the head of the Federation destroyed, the Mekon believed that it would throw the Federation into anarchy and allow him to take control in the aftermath.\n\nThe Two of Verath.\n\nDan and Rok were able to make their way to the Two’s headquarters. Whilst they were able to discover the Mekon’s plan, they were not able to stop him from hypnotising the Two.\n\nThe Mekon at first did not recognise his old enemy, but after scanning his mind he discovered the truth and tried to feed Dan Dare to maggots!\n\nThe Mekon and Dan Dare meet for the first time in almost 200 years.\n\nDan however was able to escape with Rok’s help but they were too late to stop the hypnotised Two from making their way to the planet. However the Mekon had greatly underestimated the inhabitants of the planet who were able to free the Two from the Mekon’s mind control and send them back to the Mekon.\n\nDan would subsequently form an alliance with the Two to destroy the Mekon. The Mekon saw through their ruse however and tried to murder the Two. To the former rule of the Treens surprise however, he discovered that the criminals on the Two’s adopted planet were genuinely loyal to the Two and defended him from the Mekon.\n\nIn order to escape the Dare, Rok, the Two and the hordes of criminals out for his blood, the Mekon literally tore the small planet apart.\n\nDan and Rok were able to escape, whilst the Mekon placed a forcefield around himself to survive. The Two however quickly threw themselves into the Mekon’s forcefield in time and survived the planets destruction.\n\nThe Mekon and the Two of Verath were left floating in space together. Both wanted to kill the other, but sadly neither could for now. If the Mekon killed the Two he would explode, whilst if the Two killed the Mekon the forcefield would collapse and he would be killed by the vaccum of space. The two villains agreed to call it a truce for now.\n\nThe Mekon’s forcefield would eventually make its way into the Federation’s missile silo in space. The two villains were quickly abducted by the Federation security, but the Two was able to turn the tables on their captors by threatening to shoot himself which would have set the missiles off, destroy the neighbouring solar systems.\n\nWith no choice the Federation were forced to surrender their missiles to the Mekon and the Two who would use them to devastate several worlds in the Federation as a demonstration of what would happen if the rest of the Federation defied them.\n\nDan, Doctor Rodan and Rok working together would be able to foil the Mekon and the Two’s plans. Doctor Rodan was able to shut down the bomb with a special signal that scrambled its circuits, whilst Dan and Rok were able to drive the Mekon and Rok from the Missile silo (fighting past the Federation’s robots that the Mekon and the Two had taken control of in the Missile Silo.)\n\nThe Mekon and the Two would be forced to go on the run again.\n\nThey would eventually be found by some of the few surviving Treens from the Mekon’s old empire. Though he now had the upper hand Mekon did not kill the Two. As much as they despised one another the Mekon and the Two realised that they were of use to one another for now. The Two had connections via criminals all over the Federation that would be of use to the Mekon and his Treens.\n\nThe scientific side of the Two alongside the Mekon would create a virus that attacked Rok’s people. The race of Werewolves Rok belonged too had spent centuries controlling their bloodthirsty urges unlike other Werewolves across the universe which was why they had been fully integrated into the Federation. The Mekon and the Two’s virus however was like rabies in that it completely drove the Wolves mad causing them to degenerate into animals, savagely attacking one another and various other life forms across the Federation, spreading the curse of Lycanthropy further. The Mekon contacted the leaders of Rok’s people and said that they would give them the cure as long as they handed Dan, Rok and Doctor Rodan over to them.\n\nWith no other choice the Federation would attempt to capture Dan, Rok and Rodan (whilst still trying to find a cure on their own, and capture the Mekon.)\n\nFortunately Dan, Rodan and Rok would find a sample of the Mekon’s virus which the earth government were able to derive a cure from (they also discovered that the Mekon did not have a cure himself.)\n\nThe Mekon and the Two would next track down the last of the Cosmobes that had fled to the outskirts of the galaxy during the Dalek invasion.\n\nThese Cosmobes were derided by the rest of the Federation as cowards and traitors and were generally seen as second class citizens and even shunned by most of its other inhabitants.\n\nThe Mekon would ally himself with one of the Cosmobes who was desperate to make the rest of the Federation pay. The Mekon and the rogue Cosmobe would together create a weapon that could dry up all of the waters on each world. The weapon had been invented by the Cosmobes at an early point in their history when they like many other races warred with each other. Whilst the weapon had long since been demolished, the rogue Cosmobe however believed he could rediscover the formula and with the Mekon’s help he managed too.\n\nThe Two’s various criminal connections allowed the villains to deposit this weapon on various worlds around the Federation leading to a massive loss of life. Fortunately however Dan, Rodan and Rok, working with the Cosmobes, tracked down the Mekon and destroyed the weapon. The rogue Cosmobe would be betrayed by the Mekon who abandoned him to be captured.\n\nOver the next few years, Dan, Rodan and Rok would continue to track down the Mekon and the Two’s criminal minions and enterprises all over the entire Federation and shut them down before finally facing the Two and the Mekon at their headquarters.\n\nIn the confrontation the villain’s headquarters were destroyed and both Doctor Rodan and the Two were seemingly killed in the explosion, whilst the Mekon and his few surviving Treens fled into deep space.\n\nDan was left utterly devastated at Rodan’s death and with the Mekon gone, he now lacked a purpose and would spend the next few years in solitude whilst Rok returned to his people.\n\nIn truth however Doctor Rodan and the Two had survived. They had managed as the base was blowing apart to escape into a capsule which was then blown off course and drifted outside the Federation’s reach to a primitive planet.\n\nAt first the Two and Rodan would be forced to work together to survive on this hostile world. They would later be captured by one of the two civilisations on the planet, the Grystroks, a ruthless war like people who the Two was only happy to serve (and eventually took control of.)\n\nRodan meanwhile would flee the Grystroks and aid the race they were persecuting, the peaceful Lias for the next decade.\n\nRevival of the Daleks\n\nIn the year 2285, an earth prison ship named the Starfinder would crash land on Skaro near the abandoned city of the Daleks.\n\nThe ship contained two prisoners, one of whom named Ladiver had been arrested for breaking the quarantine and visiting Skaro a few years prior.\n\nNot long after the ship crashed, the Daleks were reactivated by a member of the crew and began to slaughter them one by one.\n\nThe captain of the vessel, Redaway initially believed that Ladiver was the traitor, but the two were quickly forced to work together to fight off the Daleks. Redaway was eventually captured by the Daleks however who brutally tortured him to death.\n\nRedaway is tortured by the Daleks. During the torture session he was able to discover the identity of the real traitor. Sadly though Ladiver was able to rescue Redaway, he died of his wounds before he could tell Ladiver the truth.\n\nLadiver soon discovered that the traitor was in fact a member of the crew rather than a prisoner, Bob Slater who hoped to use the Daleks as his army to conquer the Federation.\n\nSlater had reactivated the Daleks using several devices that he placed on their backs. If the Daleks disobeyed him then he could simply deactivate them again. The Daleks pretended to be docile servants for Slater, but in secret they were able to reconnect their power source.\n\nSlater watched in horror as the devices fell off the Daleks backs and his former “servants” turned on and killed him.\n\nThe Daleks prepared to begin their war against the Federation again, but Ladiver was able to escape their city and warn the Thals. The reason Ladiver had visited Skaro was to be with his lover, a Thal woman named Ijanya, who he had helped defeat the Daleks years ago.\n\nWhilst Ladiver distracted the Daleks, Ijanya was able to deactivate the monsters power source, putting them out of action once again. Before he was put into a state of suspended animation, the Black Dalek vowed Ladiver that they would return.\n\nThe Daleks are shut down a second time by the Thals.\n\nThe survivors of the Starfinder would return to earth, where Ladiver would be pronounced dead, allowing him to stay on Skaro with Ijanya.\n\nSadly Ladiver and Ijanya’s life together would not be a happy one. A few years after the defeat of the Daleks Skaro would be invaded by a race known as the Moroks. The Moroks were an emerging space power from just outside the Federation.\n\nThey conquered Skaro relatively easily. At first the Federation attempted to defend Skaro in case the Moroks tried to reactivate the Daleks. The Moroks however soon made an alliance with the Federation. The Moroks would destroy the Daleks and conquer the Thals if the Federation left them alone.\n\nThe heads of the Federation agreed. By this stage earth and various other races who had suffered under the Daleks had gained a greater influence in the Federation and they had no trouble with exterminating the Daleks.\n\nThey had still been prevented however from doing so by the Thals who did not want to carry out a genocide. Even though the Federation were far more powerful than the Thals, they did not wish to set a dangerous precedent of larger powers imposing their will on smaller planets.\n\nHowever the Moroks who were seen as evil conquerors could do the Federation’s dirty work for them and wipe out the Daleks after which they would “negotiate” a peace treaty for the public.\n\nLadimer was given a warning by a friend of his in the Federation that the Moroks would invade and humanity would be happy to let them have the Thals.\n\nWith no other choice, Ladimer and Ijanya would lead a team to rescue the Daleks from the city. The Thals were no where near advanced enough to take on the Moroks. The Daleks were their only hope. A small group of Thals were able to hold the Moroks off long enough for the Thals to get most of the Daleks safely underground.\n\nThe Thals reactivated the Daleks underground, though much like Slater it was in a way where they would shut down the Daleks if they turned on them.\n\nThe Daleks would reluctantly work with the Thals to fight the Moroks for many years. Eventually however even with their limited resources the Daleks were able to develop their own power source, but they still worked with the Thals, as neither could stand against the Moroks.\n\nThe Moroks outnumbered both the Daleks and the Moroks greatly and were able to slaughter their small armies.\n\nOne of the Daleks killed during the Morok’s invasions casing was later placed in the Morok’s museum of greatest triumphs.\n\nThe Moroks would make a fatal mistake at the start of the 24th century when they unknowingly released Davros’ Daleks from their prison.\n\nThese Daleks were far more advanced than Zolfian and Yarvelling’s Daleks but they had been sealed beneath a mountain for several thousand years by the actions of the Fourth Doctor. With only limited resources the Daleks were completely trapped below ground with neither the original Daleks nor the Thals even being aware of their existence.\n\nThe Morok’s however detected the old Kaled bunker below the ground and thinking it was a secret Dalek base they blasted their way there. As soon as they made their way in however Davros’ Daleks fought back and were able to slaughter the Moroks.\n\nDavros’ Daleks were more powerful than the Moroks as they could power themselves and fly.\n\nThey wiped out the entire Morok invasion force relatively quickly and then turned their attention to the Thals.\n\nDavros’ Daleks, just as they had done thousands of years ago slaughtered the Thals. The Zolfian and Yarvelling Daleks sided with Davros’ Daleks, despite having worked with the Thals for years, they showed no clemency to them.\n\nMost of the Thals were exterminated but a few led by Ijanya managed to escape to another world. The Thals had not mastered spaceflight yet and would not do so for the next couple of hundred years, but they were able to capture a Morok spaceship and force its occupants to take them across the universe to another planet.\n\nThe Thals would never return to Skaro on a permanent basis again. Ladimer was killed by the black Dalek and leader of the Zolfian and Yarvelling Daleks who had worked with for years against the Moroks (the two had even saved each others lives during the constant battles against the Moroks.)\n\nThe surviving Thals fled beyond the Federation’s area of space as they no longer trusted humanity. They would spend the next several centuries building themselves up to strike back at the Daleks.\n\nBack on Skaro Davros’ Daleks would force Zolfian and Yarvellings Daleks to further mutate themselves in order to match Davros’ Daleks, and they upgraded their casings to be more powerful and capable of powering themselves too.\n\nThe leader of the Zolfian and Yarvelling Daleks, and Davros’ Daleks would then merge together into the one entity, who would become the new Emperor of the new unified race of Daleks.\n\nThe new unified Dalek race would pilot Skaro out of the Federation and Morok’s reach into another galaxy. Despite how advanced and powerful they were, they were few in number and so they needed to regroup. The Federation would search for Skaro, but it travelled far beyond their reach, where the Daleks would over the next 100 or so years build up a new empire, far larger than the original as well as discover time travel.\n\nRed Dwarf\n\nIn the year 2292 the legendary Jupiter mining corp ship Red Dwarf would become lost in space. Red Dwarf carried a crew of over 1000 people when a radiation leak caused by a faulty drive plate killed all but one of its crew, the lowest ranking technician, Dave Lister.\n\nDave Lister had been put in stasis, a special kind of suspended animation for a few months as a punishment for smuggling his pet cat, Frankenstein, on board.\n\nWhilst Lister was in stasis, the second lowest technician on board the ship (and Listers bunk mate) Arnold Rimmer failed to fix the drive plate properly, leading to the destruction of the crew.\n\nThe radiation leak was so great that no earth crew could board Red Dwarf to rescue Lister and so it would be forced to drift through deep space, piloted by its sentient computer Holly for over 3 million years.\n\nRed Dwarf would eventually drift into the galaxy where the humans who had earlier fled from the Dalek invasion of earth had escaped too. By the time Red Dwarf arrived there however, almost all of the humans had been killed off by the Gelfs and the Simulants who were now the dominant life forms, though a few stray Mechs and other man made creatures survived.\n\nOn Red Dwarf itself however there would be one other survivor besides Dave Lister. His pet Cat, Frankenstein was stored safely in the cargo hold of Red Dwarf away from the radiation. Frankenstein was pregnant and she and her kittens descendants would eventually over the course of 3 million years evolve into a race of intelligent cat people called the Felix Sapiens.\n\nThe Felix Sapiens would come to worship Lister as their god and after a holy war that nearly wiped their species out, the Cat people would leave in two vessels to try and find the mythical lost world of Feschie (in reality an earth colony Lister had plann"
