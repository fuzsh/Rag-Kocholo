Curly was the man-child, the innocent but slightly addled and always mischievous victim. Larry was, as the title of his biography suggests, the Stooge in the middle, the free-spirited guy who was there to react or to get in the way. But there were many more than just three Stooges.",

        "text": "Their contracts with Columbia ran out in 1959, but in 1958, some early Stooges shorts were packaged for television, which reignited their popularity. Besser retired when they were offered a string of feature films, and he was replaced by Joe DeRita (ne Joseph Wardell), whose character was called Curly Joe. The group called it quits in 1970.\n\n“The Three Stooges,” the new film from the Farrelly brothers, sticks with characters named Moe, Larry, and Curly (Chris Diamantopoulos, Sean Hayes, and Will Sasso), but puts them in a contemporary setting. Then and now, we get a look at a rather complicated love-hate relationship among three guys who don’t necessarily challenge authority, they just don’t give a hoot about it.\n\nAmong their many shorts, some were classics and some were clunkers. The zaniest, most anarchic and energy-infused ones were made in the 1930s. All of them were enhanced by terrific sound effects, including eye pokes (a plucked violin string), face slaps (a whip being cracked), punches to the stomach (a kettle drum), and hair pulls (cloth being torn).\n\nHere’s a look at a few of their best shorts, with trivia that every Stooges fan needs to know. They’re all available on DVD in the multi-volume “The Three Stooges Collection” from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. There’s also a terrific website called ThreeStooges.net.\n\nMEN IN BLACK (1934)\n\nThey’re first-year doctors without a clue. It’s the only Stooges film to be nominated for an Oscar (best short subject, comedy). It lost to “La Cucaracha.” The title is a parody of the 1934 film “Men in White.” It features the iconic phrase “Calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard.” The small female patient is played by a man, Little Billy Rhodes, who was the villain in “The Terror of Tiny Town.” Look out for this: When a nurse says she lost her voice asking for a raise, Larry and Curly kiss each other repeatedly, while Moe goes at the patient’s head with two mallets.\n\nTHREE LITTLE PIGSKINS (1934)\n\nThey’re vagrants who are mistaken for college football players. It’s the first time Moe hits his own hand and makes it spin around to hit Curly on the head. It’s the first time a broken dumbwaiter is used, causing people to fall from great heights. Lucille Ball is the tall blonde who speaks Pig Latin. Menacing team owner Joe Stack is played by Walter Long, who starred, in blackface, as the “renegade Negro” in “The Birth of a Nation.” Look out for this: Curly takes a punch to the face, goes over backward onto his head, then falls down.\n\nHORSES’ COLLARS (1935)\n\nThey’re detectives in the old West. Whenever Curly sees a mouse, he goes crazy, till Moe or Larry feeds him some cheese. It’s the first time they have a celery fight. They sing beautiful three-part harmony on “You’ll Never Know Just What Tears Are,” which they also sing in “Half-Shot Shooters,” “A Ducking They Did Go,” and the Clark Gable-Joan Crawford feature “Dancing Lady.” Look out for this: While Curly is cracking a safe, Moe does a fantastic eye poke on him.\n\nRESTLESS KNIGHTS (1935)\n\nThey’re appointed royal guards to the queen. The film was shot on sets borrowed from the Boris Karloff feature “The Black Room.” Their father (Walter Brennan) gives them their first triple slap. Geneva Mitchell, as the queen, later played the dance instructor with a bee down her back in “Hoi Polloi.” In the wrestling scene, Moe’s best move is reaching into Curly’s shirt and ripping out a clump of chest hair. Look out for this: Moe wears beautiful black dusters on the bottom of his pants.\n\nPARDON MY SCOTCH (1935)\n\nThey’re carpenters who are mistaken for scotch distillers. This is the first film to open with “Listen to the Mockingbird,” which became their theme song. It’s the first time they did their tools routine: “Get the tools.” “What tools?” “The tools we’ve been using for the last 10 years.” “Oh, those tools.” When they toast a man in a drugstore, Larry says, “Ver gerharget,” which is Yiddish for “Drop dead!” Look out for this: Moe is standing on a table. Curly cuts a board and accidentally saws through the table. When Moe says, “Give it to me,” the table collapses, and he hits the floor, breaking two ribs, but finishes the scene.\n\nFALSE ALARMS (1936)\n\nThey’re firefighters who would rather sleep than work. It’s their most frantic, fast-paced film, featuring a very non-PC script. When the large Minnie (June Gittelson) insists that Curly find her a boyfriend, he says, “All right, Hercules.” When Moe tries to lift her out of a car trunk, he says, “Help me with this midget.” The final shot is of a fire engine chasing a burning moving van down a main street. Look out for this: When Larry jumps down the fire pole, Moe pulls him back up ... by his hair.\n\nGRIPS, GRUNTS AND GROANS (1937)\n\nThey’re vagrants, but Curly assumes the identity of a pro wrestler. As they’re running from railroad security personnel it’s obvious there are stuntmen in their place. The wrestler Bustoff (Harrison Greene, who also plays their boss in “Ants in the Pantry”) gives them a triple slap. The film features great performances by Greene and by Casey Colombo as the gun-toting Tony. Look out for this: When Moe hits Curly in the head with dumbbells, the dumbbells bounce off and hit Moe in the head, then Moe’s head hits Larry’s.\n\nDIZZY DOCTORS (1937)\n\nThey’re salesmen for Brighto. It’s the first time Stooge regulars Vernon Dent, playing Dr. Harry Arms, and Bud Jamison, as a cop, worked together in a Stooges film. Dr. Bright and the “sleeping patient” are both played by Frank Mills. The script brings the story full circle, ending on pretty much the same shot with which it opens. Look out for this: Big Vernon Dent takes a great bump when the Stooges burst through a door on a gurney, then he jumps up and runs after them. (That was Casey Colombo again, at the bottom of the pig pile on that gurney.)\n\nBACK TO THE WOODS (1937)\n\nThey’re ruffians sent from Old England to the States to fight Indians. Moe mixes Colonial and contemporary dialogue together in the pickup line: “All my life I have been looking for a maid like thee ... toots.” It’s the first time Larry says, “We’re trapped like rats!” That’s Beethoven’s Minuet in G No. 2 on a music box. Curly’s musket goes off, and a huge turkey lands on Larry’s head. When Larry is tied up by Indians, a blackbird pecks at his head. Look out for this: The canoe scene at the end is lifted directly from their earlier film “Whoops, I’m an Indian.”\n\nVIOLENT IS THE WORD FOR CURLY (1938)\n\nThey’re gas station attendants who are mistaken for college professors. The title is a parody of the 1936 film “Valiant Is the Word for Carrie.” It features “Swingin’ the Alphabet,” written (as “The Spelling Bee”) by Septimus Winner, who also wrote “Listen to the Mockingbird.” At one point, the girls in class sing, “Curly’s a dope.” Larry appears confused when he’s asked, “Is it true that time and space are calculated by the direct ratio of interplanetary magnetism to solar radiation?” Look out for this: Curly falls asleep leaning on a car. The car explodes. When the dust clears, he’s still sleeping.\n\nEd Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com."
