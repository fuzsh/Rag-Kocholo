        "text": "I’d never considered myself to be much of a Vincent Price fan although I’ve watched many of his films, and it wasn’t until I saw Theatre of Blood that I was able to finally accept the actor as one of the horror greats. At first glance the provenance of Theatre of Blood is not particularly promising. Both the director (Douglas Hickox) and writer (Anthony Greville-Bell) enjoyed workmanlike careers and neither of them have established links to the horror genre. Furthermore, a brief consideration of the film’s plot – consisting primarily of a series of revenge-inspired brutal and bizarre murders – suggests that Theatre of Blood is simply an attempt to extend and mimic the themes and plot of the two Robert Fuest directed Dr.Phibes films that also starred Vincent Price.\n\nTheatre of Blood tells the story of the tragic revenge of the renowned Shakespearean actor Edward Lionheart (Vincent Price) whose apparent suicide is brought about by his rejection at the hands of the powerful Critic’s Circle who look down upon the actor’s somewhat hammy interpretations of the immortal bard. After failing to win the coveted Critic’s Circle Award, Price confronts his tormentors before falling to his death, only to return and exact his revenge from beyond the grave. One by one, the critics are cruelly dispatched in the manner of notable deaths lifted from some of Shakespeare’s most memorable plays as the indomitable Lionheart enacts his inexorable revenge.\n\nThere is no doubt that one of the chief pleasures in Theatre of Blood is the magnificently staged set-piece murders that punctuate the film’s narrative. Although the film is pitched very much as a horror-comedy, the brutality of some of the murders remains shocking, over 40 years on from the film’s original 1973 release date. In the film’s opening scene we are greeted with the graphic multiple stabbing of George Maxwell (Michael Hordern) at the hands of group of down-and-outs – in the style of Julius Caesar – and this affecting scene begins a series of grand-guignol set-pieces that deliver increasingly grim and theatrical guts and gore. Other notable deaths include that of Trevor Dickman (Harry Andrews) whose still steaming heart is callously sliced by Lionheart’s Shylock and in the film’s most amusing murder, the calmly suburban surgical beheading of Horace Sprout (Arthur Lowe). Theatre of Blood’s most unsettling and disgusting sequence is undoubtedly the dispatch of Meridith Merridew (Robert Morley) as he is force-fed a pie made from his canine ‘babies’ (a la Titus Andronicus), which is a scene that once seen, will never be forgotten.\n\nThe pleasure derived from these gruesome murders is underlined by a wonderful supporting cast that is made up of a slew of familiar British thesps drawn from both film and television. As well as Arthur Lowe, Michael Hordern and Robert Morley, the critics circle includes such numinaries as Jack Hawkins, Dennis Price, Ian Hendry and Coral Browne, who later became Vincent Price’s third and final wife. They met for the first time on the set of Theatre of Blood (whilst Price was still married to his second wife) and were wed a year later. The rather splendid collection of character actors that make up the Circle combine to create the most convincingly self-satisfied and pompous set of critics to ever grace the silver screen. In addition to the actors featured in the Critics’ Circle, the film is also scattered with even more memorable faces, from Eric Sykes as an avuncular police detective, Diana Dors as a seductive and wayward wife and Diana Rigg as Lionheart’s dedicated daughter, Edwina. It is rather surprising to find the rather sophisticated Diana Rigg in amongst such graphic murder and mayhem but she obviously enjoyed the experience; eventually passing on her role to daughter Rachel Stirling who played Edwina in the 2005 London stage adaptation alongside Jim Broadbent as Lionheart.\n\nAs delightful as the deliciously gruesome murders and wonderful supporting cast are, it is however, the central performance of Vincent Price as the monstrous Lionheart that makes Theatre of Blood so memorable. As the supreme egotist and meglomaniacal Edward Kendal Sheridan Lionheart, Price draws on a long career of B-movie monsters and villains to create a character that is at once hilarious and horrible. Employing and heightening his somewhat overcooked acting method to flesh out the vengeful thespian, Price manages to evoke both sympathy and revulsion as he works his way through the critics that have ruined Lionheart’s career. Price clearly relishes the opportunity to get to grips with some of Shakespeare’s greatest works and it is all but impossible to tell whether he is playing these scenes straight or hamming them up for the part of Lionheart. Whatever his intentions, he plays Lionheart with an abandonment and gusto that supports the grim humour and gory deaths with equal aplomb. His rendering of the ‘To be or not to be’ soliloquy from Hamlet as he staggers around a penthouse balcony clutching the Critics’ Circle Award so cruelly denied him by the callous critics gathered inside, is given a mournful gravitas that one would not expect in such a horror romp. It is a testament to Price’s over the top but well judged performance that he is able to garner the sympathy of the audience even as he slaughters his foes, easily elbowing aside the film’s nominal point of identification, Peregrine Devlin (Ian Hendry).\n\nTheatre of Blood remains one of the few fully realised horror-comedies containing enough visceral thrills to satisfy the most exacting gorehounds supported by a range of belly laughs to ease the nerves of the more sensitive viewers. The lurid and decaying backdrop of 1970s Britain, combined the smug and cosseted setting of the London theatre scene creates a uniquely grim and comic atmosphere that Price exploits to its full potential. His magnificent and monstrous Lionheart is one of cinema’s great vengeful anti-heroes and as such is worthy of any awards that critics might bestow…or else!\n\nThese days zombies are everywhere. Despite traditionally being the poor relation of the horror family, the shuffling hoards of the undead have come back to make their mark on a new century and a new generation of cinema-goers. The zombie movie as a distinct genre was initially little more than a b-movie footnote in the history of the horror movie, with its origins in cheapies from the 1930s and 40s, most notably in the case of White Zombie (1932) starring Bela Lugosi and Jacques Tourneur’s elegiac I Walked With a Zombie (1941). These colonial horrors tended to rely heavily on melodrama and a vague sense of dread; due to the limited action potential of the mindless members of the undead. Such are the imaginative limits of the Haitian zombie proper that even during the years of the horror revival under Hammer Films, the undead only really resurface on a single occasion, in Plague of the Zombies (1964), shot back-to-back by John Gilling as part of a colonial horror two-hander with The Reptile (1964).\n\nWith the zombie film entering something of a blind alley, it was left to low-budget America film maker George Romero to reinvent the genre and it very much his vision of the undead which provides the basis of the recent cinematic revival. In Night of the Living Dead (1968), Romero brings the zombie home; setting his movie in modern-day America but also introducing two influential factors which have continued to shape subsequent attempts to represent the undead. Firstly, he presented the crisis of the zombie invasion as social allegory, perhaps most notably in Dawn of the Dead (1979), a film set largely in the confines of a shopping mall and scathing in its critique of the all-encompassing and suffocating nature of contemporary consumerism. Secondly, and crucially, Romero changed the role and behaviour of the zombie. No longer were the undead under the thrall of a voodoo master, they were now out of control and most worryingly they were hungry. Zombies still shambled and staggered about but when given the chance they now gleefully indulged in cannibalistic flesh-eating frenzies; indeed it is almost unthinkable in the post-Romero era, to walk into a movie theatre showing a zombie movie without witnessing at least the odd bout of cannibalistic gore. Having said this, it was the new realm of home video that gave the new, gore-happy zombie its home and apart from Romero’s Day of the Dead (1985), the undead remained largely buried in the world of cult video appearing in such titles as Lucio Fulci’s ‘video nasty’ Zombie Flesh Eaters (1979) and Dan O’Bannon’s Return of the Living Dead (1985).\n\nThe revival of the zombie film at the turn of the century owes much to Romero’s reinvention of the undead. The largely uninspiring Resident Evil franchise is based on a series of hugely popular video games produced by Capcom which draws directly upon Romero’s dystopian vision and he was originally due to oversee the first movie in the franchise but was eventually replaced by Paul Anderson. It was really the trans-Atlantic success of Danny Boyle’s British based thriller 28 Days Later (2002), which put the zombie film back on the map. Despite the director’s assertion that his flesh-eating protagonists were not zombies but unfortunate individuals infected with a virus known as RAGE, the movie puts a contemporary spin on Romero’s version of undead mayhem. The souped-up and fast-moving zombies of Boyle’s film are also present in Zach Snyder’s glossy remake of Romero’s classic Dawn of the Dead (2004), a film which strips away the social commentary of the original in favour of a cruel and bleak MTV style thrill-ride. The real creative and commercial success of the zombie revival however, emerged from the unlikely location of suburban London with Shaun of the Dead which has managed to combine innovation and inventiveness with a real respect for Romero’s vision of the undead.\n\nBilled as; ‘A romantic comedy. With Zombies’, Shaun of the Dead tells the story of 29 year-old loser Shaun (Simon Pegg), who finds himself at a crossroads, torn between the extended adolescent world of his house-mate Ed (Nick Frost) and the ‘grown-up’ realm of his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield). After he is dumped by Liz, Shaun vows to win her back and to generally sort his life out but finds himself in the middle of a full scale zombie crisis. Armed with a trusty cricket bat and accompanied by the suddenly lively and invigorated Ed, Shaun sets out to rescue his Mum (Penelope Wilton), stepfather Phillip (Bill Nighy) as well as Liz and her erstwhile flatmates David and Diane (Dylan Moran and Lucy Davis) and hold up at his trusty local pub; the Winchester.\n\nWriters Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright managed to come up with a screenplay which is a genuinely funny take on early mid-life crisis (familiar to British viewers of the Pegg and Wright sitcom Spaced) and a convincing and valuable addition to the post-Romero zombie film. As the writers have stated on the Raw Meat section of the DVD extras (the subheading borrowed from the US title of the 1972 classic Death Line), the film is not intended as a spoof and the comedy elements of the film sit surprisingly well with the apocalyptic and often visceral depiction of British suburbia blighted by zombie invasion. The film contains a number of affectionate references to Romero’s Dead trilogy (Shaun works as an assistant in ‘Foree Electronics’, named in honour of actor Ken Foree’s SWAT team anti-hero in Dawn of the Dead and at one point Ed declares over the phone ‘We’re coming to get you Barbara!’ paraphrasing some key dialogue from Night of the Living Dead) which are amusing for those in the know but significantly do not lend the proceedings with an air of geeky smugness for the uninitiated. As well as retaining Romero’s original shuffling zombie gait – no athletic and kinetic undead here – and some affecting gore, Shaun of the Dead also manages to reassert some of the elements of social critique that make Romero’s films so memorable. Early on in proceedings we are treated to a collage of everyday ‘zombie’ moments; the repetitive rhythms of a supermarket checkout, commuters staring blankly into middle space as they travel to work and a shuffling crew of personal stereo-listening kids precede the opening titles. Director Edgar Wright keeps a tight rein at the helm of the film and makes the most of his downbeat suburban setting; the tracking shot and sequence which follows a bleary, hung-over Shaun as he pops down the local shop for refreshments, not realising that his usual world has been turned upside down by chaos and zombie apocalypse, is memorable both its comic affect and its eerie transformation of a familiar suburban neighbourhood.\n\nThe affectionate fun-poking at British suburban sensibilities is supported by some fine performances from the ensemble cast; particularly by Shaun’s parents as played by Penelope Wilton and Bill Nighy. Nighy, as misunderstood stepfather Phillip, delivers a genuinely moving and affecting near-death speech which temporarily lends the proceedings an unexpected sense of gravitas and Penelope Wilton’s performance as Barbara, Shaun’s mother, is equally telling.\n\nBarbara’s understated response to the unfolding crisis; – ‘I don’t want to cause a fuss’ she mutters as it is made clear that she has been bitten by a zombie and prior to her transformation into a particularly frightening member of the undead, she reflects that; ‘It’s been a funny sort of a day!’ – is a wonderful portrait of British reserve which underscores a convincing portrayal of gentile suburbia in crisis.\n\nThe performances of the younger members of the cast are equally impressive, particularly the central pairing of Pegg and Frost, whose relationship is the true romance of the piece; as engaging as Kate Ashfield is as girlfriend Liz, she can’t compete with the detail and depth of Shaun and Ed’s platonic bond. Perhaps one of the film’s few weaknesses is the characterisation of Liz’s flatmates David and Diane which don’t quite convince. Both Lucy Davis and Dylan Moran seem ill-at-ease in their roles, although the latter does feature in a climatic Romero-esque evisceration scene which incorporates enough explicit gut-fumbling to please even the most die-hard gorehounds.\n\nShaun of the Dead blends its constituent parts well and sets out to prove that a British film need not pander to the mid-Atlantic fantasy-London world of international successes like Notting Hill and Bridget Jones Diary; and it is somewhat surprising that all three films share an association with Working Title. The more mundane and believable milieu of Shaun of the Dead is not however, in any sense colloquial, as evidenced by the huge success of the film in America where it spent some seven weeks in the US box office top ten.\n\nIn the aftermath of this success, the filmmakers can reflect with some satisfaction that the zombie movie was fully resurrected as reflected in the return of George Romero to the genre that he did so much to shape, with the release of Land of the Dead in 2005. In an appreciative nod to their faithful reworking of his own zombie oeuvre, Romero featured Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright zombie cameo roles in the fourth instalment of his apocalyptic series proving once and for all that it is not the meek but the undead that will ultimately inherit the earth.\n\nAs I intimated in Ghouls Underground, I’ve been meaning to write about Death Line (known charmingly as Raw Meat in the US) for a while now and since 2013 is the 150th anniversary of the opening of the London Underground it seemed like a good idea to revisit one of my favourite cult movies. Gary Sherman’s 1973 film is one that still stands out as a true original and despite several films that have centred around horrific events in the underground (like Chris Smith’s Creep [2004] and Ryûhei Kitamura’s Midnight Meat Train [2008]) you are unlikely to see anything else that comes close to capturing the unique atmosphere of this largely unheralded addition to 1970s British horror.\n\nThe story of strange disappearances, murder and cannibalism on the London Underground is one of horror cinema’s genuine oddities and that such lurid themes are used to shape such a sombre and mournful film is testament to some telling contributions from the actors and filmmakers responsible. Director and co-writer Gary Sherman brings an outsider’s (ie: American) eye to the grubby context of 1970s London but also manages to expertly capture the quirky nuances of the capital’s labouring denizens. From the very outset, as the brassy theme tune is belted out over images of an unsavoury, bowler-hatted civil servant as he emerges from a Soho nightclub, we become immersed in the fractious and class-conscious world of 1970s Britain that some of us remember so well. The subsequent disappearance and murder of James Manfred OBE – last seen alive slumped on the steps of Russell Square tube station – sparks off a series of investigations that exposes the injustices of a class-ridden culture that permeates both past and present.\n\nThe hero of the piece is played beautifully by Donald Pleasence and his performance as the sardonic, tea-swigging Inspector Calhoun is amongst the very best of a quirky and distinguished career. His beleaguered and often testy inspector is brought effortlessly to life and this role is the equal of Pleasence’s’ other great cult performances as Doc Tydon in Ted Kotcheff’s outback nightmare Wake in Fright (1971) (a film that like Death Line defies easy categorisation) and his unforgettable Dr. Loomis in John Carpenter’s Halloween (1978). Pleasence is aided immensely by some of the supporting cast, most notably by Norman Rossington as his loyal deputy Sergeant Rogers and memorably (although fleetingly) by special guest star Christopher Lee as MI5 man Stratton-Villiers. The short battle of wits between Pleasence and Lee crackles with energy and tension, emphasising the poisonous influence of class and self-interest that shapes much of the message of the film. Inspector Calhoun is told in no uncertain terms to ‘run along’ back to his ‘manor’ with its workaday villains and petty criminals and to forget about the fate of more lofty governmental types, however dubious their nefarious night-time activities may be.\n\nThe later discovery of the last remnant of a tribe of abandoned underground workers whose cannibalistic tendencies have done for Manfred and other poor unfortunates pulls together the class crimes of the past to sharp effect in the present. Alongside images of the remnants of decayed swinging London and the sleepy, tea-fuelled procedural work of the metropolitan detectives, the film shows the bleak and mournful existence of ‘the man’, an unnamed subterranean dweller whose tunnelling ancestors were the victims of a tragic cave-in only to be abandoned by the callous disregard of their Victorian corporate masters. Hugh Armstrong’s portrayal of ‘the man’ is played in heavy disguise (he’s both hairy and covered in unsightly sores) and though he has only one line to deliver, he manages to use his inarticulate range of moans and grunts to shape a poignant and tragic character. Despite the queasy make-up, drooling inarticulacy and violent behaviour, Armstrong’s performance evokes both pathos and empathy and is the equal of other great tragic mute movie horrors such as those played by Richard Farnsworth in Val Guest’s The Quatermass Xperiment (1955) and Boris Karloff in James Whale’s classic Frankenstein (1931). Unlike both these characters however, Armstrong is allowed a single line, as his character attempts to communicate his grief and loneliness to an uncomprehending ‘victim’. His repeated and earnest utterance of ‘Mind the doors…!’ (the only muffled human words he has ever heard through the walls of his cavernous domain) evokes a certain amount of grim humour but also pity and sympathy from this tragically character who finds himself alone and cast outside of human succour.\n\nApart from some great performances from several of the cast (although the two young student protagonists played by Alex Campbell and Patricia Wilson are unremarkable in their roles) it is worth noting that as well as presenting some visceral scenes of violence and cannibalistic behaviour, the film also includes some wonderful cinematography by Alex Thompson (who later shot Alien 3 [1992]). Death Line benefits too from some convincing make-up by Harry Frampton (whose career encompasses both Kind Hearts and Coronets [1949] and Straw Dogs [1971]) as well as authentic underground locations. The night-time attack by ‘the man’ on three unsuspecting tube workers is expertly and shockingly handled, including a convincing spade to the head and a vivid impaling by broom handle which will keep gore-seekers happy but this is balanced with some artful cinematic flourishes which are all the more impressive for having been found within such a nominally grim and gruesome tale.\n\nThe bleak and lonely caverns of the abandoned underground tunnels are eerily depicted and the dank atmosphere evoked perfectly by the repetitive and intimate sound of dripping water. Most impressive however is the relentlessly drawn out tracking shot that takes us from the sombre lair of ‘the man’ as he lies keening over the dying body of his female companion, through the dark abandoned tunnels, into a collapsed cavern and finally into the light and sounds of a bustling London Underground station. There is some appreciable skill and artistry afforded to this masterful sequence in both conception and execution. With only a single transition, zoom and final cut to the station, this shot is spread out over seven minutes of breathless footage (Sherman has claimed the sequence is twelve minutes long but I think he’s included a few static minutes of ‘the man’ ministering to his patient) and wouldn’t be out of place in a more respectful art-house classic. I’ll take this shot over Godard’s traffic jam in Weekend (1967) any day of the working week…\n\nThis sequence forms the centre piece of a wonderful use of the London Underground setting which is vividly evoked to pick out daily rituals and starkly bleak contrasts. The depiction of 1970s municipal transport – complete with screeching trains and petty employees – is expertly mirrored with the echoing abandoned tunnels of ‘the man’s’ lonely existence. There have been few filmmakers who have managed to make equally successful use of the grimy setting of the London Underground and it is interesting that the most notable film in this regard was by another American director, John Landis who memorably staged a werewolf attack in Tottenham Court Road tube station in An American Werewolf in London (1981).\n\nLandis dedicated his film to the engagement of Prince Charles to Lady Diana Spencer and it seems appropriate that the celebrations commemorating the 150th anniversary of the opening of the London Underground should be taken as a similar opportunity to remember this strange and unique classic of British horror. If you should be lucky enough to attend any of the anniversary celebrations and find yourself at some unveiling ceremony in a London tube station perhaps you could linger behind after the festivities have completed. Spend a moment to stroll towards the platform edge and see if what you can make out in the shadows of the tunnel. Who knows perhaps you might catch an echo of a warning… or is it a question? Mind the doors!\n\nSee the trailer here:"
