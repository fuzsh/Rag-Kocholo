David Strathairn stars in the true story of Holocaust witness and reluctant World War II hero Jan Karski.\n\n-Messenger of the Polish people to their government-in-exile.\n\nPoland is the whole world to me, and that whole world is destroyed.\n\n\"You are going to be taken to labor camp, where you will work.\n\nIf you attempt to escape, you will be shot.\"\n\nMessenger of the Jewish people to the world.\n\nWe enter the ghetto through this tunnel.\n\nTell them over there in London and the United States that you saw it.\n\nIf there is no effort at Allied intervention, within the year, the Jewish people of Poland will cease to exist.\n\n-David Strathairn's powerful solo performance is followed by a behind-the-scenes exploration of Karski's life and work.\n\n-So, here is a man who alerted the world to genocide as it was taking place.\n\n-\"Remember This\" is next.\n\n[ Footsteps approaching ] -We see what goes on in the world, don't we?\n\nOur world is in peril.\n\nEvery day it becomes more and more fractured, toxic, out of our control.\n\nWe are being torn apart by immense gulfs of selfishness, distrust, fear, greed, indifference, denial.\n\nMillions are being displaced, impoverished, denied justice simply because of who they are.\n\nBeaten, murdered, silenced, forgotten.\n\nWe see this, don't we?\n\nHow can we not see this?\n\nSo... What can we do?\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nWhat can I do?\n\nWhat can we do that we are not already doing?\n\nDo we have a duty, a responsibility as individuals to do something?\n\nAnything?\n\nAnd how do we know what to do?\n\nHow do we know what we are capable of?\n\nIt's not easy knowing.\n\nHuman beings have infinite capacity to ignore things that are not convenient.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ -Now -- Now I go back 35 years.\n\nNo, I don't go back, you know.\n\n[ Sobs ] [ Sobs, speaks indistinctly ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Jan Karski, born Jan Kozielewski, 1914.\n\n♪♪ Messenger of the Polish people to their government-in-exile.\n\n♪♪ Messenger of the Jewish people to the world.\n\n♪♪ A man who told of the annihilation of the Jewish people while there was still time to stop it.\n\n♪♪ Hero of the Polish people.\n\n♪♪ Professor, Georgetown University, 1952 to 1992.\n\nAnd always... [ Polish accent ] ...immaculately dressed.\n\nNow I go back.\n\nIn my class that is on government and politics, I tell my students, governments have no souls.\n\nThey have only their interests in mind.\n\nIndividuals have souls.\n\nThe common humanity of people, not the power of governments, is the only real protector of human rights.\n\nSo...\n\nI ask you, what is your duty as an individual?\n\nEvery generation takes on a new revolution.\n\nSzmul Zygielbojm -- remember his name.\n\nThis man loved his people more than he loved himself.\n\nZygielbojm shows us this total helplessness, the indifference of the world.\n\nWhat we are witnessing now is very discouraging.\n\nEvery generation brings destruction, partition, violence, and yet there is this desire to preserve language, identity, culture.\n\nAs a boy in Poland, we had to learn many languages because we never knew who would take us over.\n\nFor 35 years, I have never mentioned, even to my students, that I took part in the war.\n\nI wanted to forget that degradation, humiliation, and that dirt.\n\nI was forgotten and I wanted to be forgotten.\n\nOne day, 1978, I am discovered.\n\nA man knocks on my door.\n\n[ Knocking ] A filmmaker.\n\nHis name, Claude Lanzmann.\n\nAnd he is very full of himself.\n\nHe likes to brag.\n\n\"Making this film, it will be the greatest film ever made about the tragedy of the Jews.\n\nIt will be called \"Shoah,\" and it will be as long as it needs to be to tell what needs to be told.\n\nAnd, Professor Karski, you will be in this film.\n\nThere will be no actors, no Hollywood nincompoops, only perpetrators, victims, witnesses.\n\nAnd you are in the third group.\n\nI will have an interview with you.\"\n\n\"No, no.\n\nYou will not have an interview with me.\n\nI am out of it.\"\n\nBut I remember he is a bit of an authoritarian.\n\nHe is very, very pushy.\n\n\"Professor Karski, look in the mirror.\n\nYou are old man.\n\nYou are going to die soon.\n\nYou have historical responsibility.\n\nIt is your duty to speak.\"\n\nHe convinces me.\n\nI made a fool of myself.\n\nI broke down a few times.\n\nIt was the first time that I was involved again in that experience.\n\nMy wife, Pola, can't stand it.\n\nWe never discuss the war.\n\n\"Jan, you torture yourself.\n\nYou have done your job.\n\nIt does you no good.\"\n\nShe leaves the house and walks for four hours.\n\nShe is a dancer.\n\nShe never stands still.\n\nLanzmann asks me questions.\n\n\"Do you think you have succeeded in your report to the world?\n\nDo you think you have succeeded in conveying the magnitude?\n\nProfessor Karski, you are unique witness.\n\nYou are a hero.\"\n\nNo, no.\n\nI am insignificant little man.\n\nHero?\n\nNo.\n\nPeople in Poland were not happy that I took part in that film.\n\nThey say it does not reflect kindly on my country.\n\n♪♪ I was born in Lodz -- at that time, one of the most multicultural cities in all of Europe, where whether you were happy or unhappy, you always hear bells.\n\n[ Bells tolling ] I remember my grandmother gives me a bicycle.\n\n\"Jasiu,\" she says, \"Take this, see the Polish countryside as it is now.\"\n\nI ride east to west.\n\nEverywhere I go, \"Witam!\n\nWitam, Jasiu!\"\n\n\"Dzien dobry!\"\n\n\"Powodzenia!\"\n\n[ Chuckles ] \"Good luck.\"\n\nBy American standards, we are rather poor.\n\nMy father, Stefan Kozielewski, has small factory producing saddles, women's bags, leather goods.\n\nI barely remember him.\n\nHe dies when I am very young.\n\nMy mother, Walentyna Kozielewska, she wants me to be a diplomat, ambassador of Poland.\n\nI listen, I work hard.\n\nEverybody says I have excellent memory and I am a good boy.\n\nMy mother, very, very Catholic.\n\nDevotion, respect for others.\n\nShe is making us in her image.\n\nI remember when they took me to be baptized, she tells me that my father, my godfather, and my priest, all of them were drunk.\n\n[ Chuckles ] She is disgusted, but this is Poland.\n\nIn America, people drink to be in better mood.\n\nIn Poland, we drink to get drunk.\n\nNow I think every conversation would be better with a Manhattan.\n\nIn our apartment house, I remember in the yard there are some boys, children who my mother calls bad boys.\n\nThey would sneak over the roof and throw dead rats.\n\nBad boys, bad Catholic boys.\n\nTeasing the Jews, throwing dead rats at Jews.\n\n\"Jasiu, keep watch like a good Catholic boy.\n\nGo to the Sukkah, where the Jews pray, and you will watch.\n\nIf someone comes, simply call, 'Mamo, Mamo,' and I will take care of it.\"\n\nAnd I watch.\n\nMy best friends in school are Jewish.\n\nThey help me with science, I help them with Polish literature and history.\n\nIzio Fuchs, extremely religious.\n\nEverybody calls him Jewish prophet.\n\nHe starts every sentence, \"I say.\"\n\nAnother one, Lejba Ejbuszyc, is abject poverty.\n\nIs a fighter full of resentment, hatred.\n\nHe must have been treated badly.\n\nIzio tells us, \"I say, we have to be friendly with Lejba because if he doesn't find friends with us, where will he find friends?\"\n\nIzio's younger brother Salus.\n\nEverybody loves Salus, but I like him most of all.\n\nHe wants to be a pianist, but I can never get him to play the piano for me.\n\nI don't know what happens to them.\n\nMy mother always says, \"Jasiu, climb the ladder and nothing will stand in your way.\n\nGo.\n\nGo.\"\n\nAnd I leave Lodz for university to study law and diplomacy.\n\nAfter graduation, I am invited to attend a youth rally in Germany.\n\n[ Crowd cheering ] Thousands of faces, somehow all the same.\n\nTremendous hullabaloo.\n\nTremendous the hall, like a concert, like a circus.\n\nDarkness.\n\nShock.\n\nNothing is happening.\n\nThen the sun descends on one point alone.\n\nA man, medals on his chest.\n\nLight glowing around him.\n\nThat is Hermann Goering.\n\n\"You have to take responsibility for the human race, because you belong to the superior race.\n\nWe are destined to govern, to bring order to the world.\n\nTo create the lasting peace, and only the honest peace and youth of Germany can create such peace!\n\nSieg Heil.\n\nSieg Heil!\n\nSieg Heil!\"\n\n[ Rhythmic footsteps ] What is happening?\n\nThat was Goering.\n\nIt is enough to make someone dizzy, the noise, the lighting.\n\nBut I think maybe they are superior.\n\nTo govern the whole world is a pretty overwhelming proposition, yet it sounds like fun to them.\n\nWhy couldn't I be born German, I wonder, so I could to be superior too?\n\nTo me, at this moment, they represent Western civilization.\n\nI go to Geneva to learn French, to London to learn English.\n\nIt's very, very difficult.\n\nI work a low-level job in the Polish embassy, but I feel...\n\nI have a longing for home.\n\nOne evening, I go to the theater.\n\nEvening of Polish folk dance.\n\n♪♪ Alone onstage, dancing barefoot, a girl, a Polish girl of outstanding beauty.\n\nHer name is Pola.\n\n[ Chuckling ] Polish girl named Pola.\n\nPola Nirenska.\n\nMm.\n\nA girl in exile here, far from home.\n\nI wonder what story she is telling with such urgency, such freedom.\n\nI have never experienced this form of expression before.\n\nIt's amazing.\n\nBeautiful.\n\n[ Applause ] I return to Poland, to Warsaw and join the diplomatic service.\n\nIf my mother were still alive, she would be very, very proud.\n\nI want to represent my nation.\n\nI love my country.\n\nI am a proud citizen of a big empire.\n\nSlip of paper, secret mobilization order.\n\n\"Polish army needs you.\n\nSettle your affairs and report to the train station in two hours.\"\n\nSent to the German border in a crisp khaki uniform with unbridled optimism.\n\n\"Death to Hitler.\n\nNiech zyje Polska!\n\nLong live Poland.\n\nAh, we can finish this alone.\"\n\n[ Train brakes hiss ] A town called Oswiecim -- in German, Auschwitz.\n\nLater infamous, but now, 1939, just an ordinary place with a brilliant, cloudless sky.\n\nSeptember 1st, 5:05 in the morning -- time for a shave.\n\n[ Explosion ] It comes out of nowhere.\n\nThe Germans bomb our camp.\n\nMen are dying.\n\nI retreat.\n\nI crawl back to the station.\n\n[ Airplane engines roaring ] [ Gunshots ] I don't even know who is firing, who is on our side.\n\n♪♪ Total devastation.\n\nChaos.\n\nThe Blitzkrieg.\n\nI see the destruction of everything I have believed in.\n\nPoland is strong.\n\nPoland is an empire.\n\nPoland is the whole world to me, and that whole world is destroyed.\n\nEverything I have believed in up till now no longer applies.\n\nPoland loses the war in 20 minutes.\n\nI walk, a refugee.\n\n♪♪ It is summer, and the heat is terrible.\n\nWe don't know where we are going.\n\nThousands with no place to go.\n\nWho will take us in?\n\nI try to walk on the softer sides of my feet.\n\nThey are so blistered.\n\n15 days, I walk.\n\nI see tanks, the hammer and sickle.\n\nSoviets have entered Poland.\n\nA Polish captain waves a white handkerchief.\n\nThey take us to labor camp.\n\nWe sleep in a warehouse beneath the Red Star and a portrait of Stalin.\n\nWe shiver in the raw autumnal wind.\n\nBarbed wire encircles us.\n\n\"Cold?\n\nAre you Poles cold?\n\nThat's because your bones are hollow and your blood runs weak.\n\nExploiters, bloodsuckers.\n\nYou will learn how to work in Russia.\n\nYour backs will ache, your hands will bleed, your fingernails will break open, but you will learn how to work.\"\n\nFor four weeks, I learned how to work.\n\nI see opportunity.\n\nThere is coming an exchange with the Germans.\n\nApproach a Russian officer.\n\n\"Sir, the men have been speaking about an exchange.\"\n\n\"What?\n\nYou don't like it here?\"\n\n\"I love it here.\n\nI would like to stay here, but my wife is expecting our first child.\n\nI want to return to Lodz to be with her.\"\n\nI am sure he realizes I am lying.\n\nThis, for me, is a lesson.\n\nThere is no such thing as good nation, bad nation.\n\nEach individual has infinite capacity to do good and infinite capacity to do evil.\n\nWe have a choice.\n\nI lie, I survive.\n\nThe others will be taken to the edge of a pit and shot in the head, stacked neatly in mass graves.\n\n22,000 in the massacre in the Katyn forest.\n\n♪♪ Radom -- military base in occupied Poland.\n\nA model Nazi facility.\n\nWe eat tiny amounts of inedible food.\n\nWe sleep on the cold, hard November ground.\n\nNo overcoats, no blankets.\n\nEvery day, deaths come from exposure and disease.\n\nI see how common and lightly regarded death can be.\n\n\"Polish swine, you are going to be taken to labor camp where you will work.\n\nIf you attempt to escape, you will be shot.\n\nIf you create disturbance, you will be shot.\n\nLoad the swine onto the train.\"\n\n[ Train horn blows ] ♪♪ ♪♪ \"Citizens of Poland, I am going to jump from this train.\n\nWar is not lost.\n\nWe are not defeated.\n\nJoin me if you are willing to take the risk.\n\nI need three men to lift me up and push me out at a point along the tracks where there is no light.\"\n\n\"Why would we help you?\n\nThe Germans will shoot the rest of us.\"\n\n\"We are young men, some only 18.\n\nWe must not spend our lives as German slaves.\n\nAre you or are you not a Pole?\"\n\n♪♪ [ Music intensifies ] [ Train horn blows ] [ Train passing ] I jump from the train.\n\nI am no James Bond.\n\nI do what I have to do.\n\nI escape.\n\nAgain, I walk.\n\n100 miles.\n\nThousands along the road, silent, exhausted.\n\nEverywhere, devastation left by the Blitzkrieg.\n\nWarsaw...\n\nShocking ruin of its former self.\n\nStreet after street heaped with rubble and debris.\n\nCafes, theaters, libraries, churches, vanished as if they never existed.\n\nGraves for the dead, improvised in parks and public squares.\n\nThere is no longer the Poland.\n\nYet irrationally, some part of me believes a fragment still exists.\n\nSomething must be occurring.\n\n\"Jan!\"\n\n\"Jan!\"\n\n\"Not every Pole has resigned themself to fate.\n\nWe must fight if we want to exist.\n\nCome, come.\n\nWalk through this door.\"\n\n\"Come in, young man.\n\nCome

brother.\n\nJoin the Polish Underground.\"\n\nThere is nothing extraordinary about it, nothing at all romantic.\n\nIt comes as a result of a simple raising of my right hand.\n\n\"In the name of the motherland...\" \"In the name of the motherland, I swear before God, his son, and the holy spirit, that I will not divulge any of the information which I am about to receive.\n\nI swear to God that even under the most extreme circumstances, even unto death, I shall remain faithful to the Polish nation.\"\n\n\"By the oath you have just taken, you are now a member of the Polish Underground.\"\n\nI become a tape recorder, camera, messenger.\n\nMy first mission -- to see the Polish countryside as it is now.\n\nTo collect information in Lodz, Lublin, Belzec, then proceed to France and report there to our government-in-exile.\n\nI will report what I see.\n\n♪♪ Lodz -- December 1939.\n\nAll the streets, shops, offices have only German names and are flooded with German flags, slogans, posters.\n\nPoles cannot travel by automobile.\n\nThey are even forbidden to own a bicycle.\n\nNo matter where you turn, you hear only the German language.\n\nLodz is no longer Lodz.\n\nLodz is Litzmannstadt.\n\nI report what I see.\n\n♪♪ Lublin.\n\nA lesson is taught, German to Jew, in gymnastics and hygiene.\n\nDozens of young men, women, and children forced to sing those humiliating Nazi

way.\n\nAnd in a sense, on film, that dance became, you know, such -- so much about focal shifts, like the difference between looking into the camera and off the camera and off to the side.\n\n-It felt to me like he was moving through these sort of three different worlds, in a way.\n\nYou know, there is this white world where there's the hope for, like, you know, moral clarity and justice.\n\n-A poem by Mickiewicz.\n\n-I wanted us to, like, also then see Karski in this, like, gray sort of memory world.\n\nAnd then there is this other world, which is this, like, black, dissociative, chaotic world where you are adjacent to all the atrocities that are happening.\n\nOne of the other choices in conjunction with that was to switch around the lensing.\n\nSo for those white worlds, we went with a very clean, clear, like, modern lens.\n\nFor those gray memory worlds and the black worlds, we switched to, like, a very flawed vintage lens.\n\nThat, you know, contributed to helping you land yourself inside Karski's head a little bit more and to feel like what his psychological state was at any given point in the story.\n\n-It was not part of humanity.\n\n-Carrying his lesson or his legacy, it's a real privilege, but it's daunting to carry that weight of that man, of what he did, forward.\n\n-Someone who did so much at such a young age, and -- and yet, learned through that process the power of his own insignificance in relation to the size of humanity, and humanity's greatest crimes.\n\n-I taught at Georgetown University with Professor Karski, and I had all of my students see the Claude Lanzmann documentary \"Shoah.\"\n\nThey saw him as an old man in what appeared to be a documentary which they thought was taken, you know, 40, 50 years ago.\n\n-They thought that he is -- \"It cannot be the same person.\n\nThat person who is in 'Shoah' is dead.\"\n\n-After I showed that to my students, I would get a call inevitably from Professor Karski, in which he would say, \"Professor Berenbaum, you tell your students that I am very much alive.\n\nThere will be plenty of time for me to be dead.\"\n\n-When I became president of Georgetown in 1989, I, of course, got to know Jan because he was so prominent in the School of Foreign Service.\n\nClasses ended at 5:00, and that's when the cocktail hour began.\n\nAnd that was fine with me.\n\n-Karski was a diplomat.\n\nHe was educated as such.\n\n-He stood ramrod straight.\n\n-Always immaculately dressed.\n\n-I don't know whether David has ever worn such good clothes as Jan wore.\n\nHe was very European in dress.\n\nPocket handkerchief, always.\n\n-Part of the reason he was chosen as a courier was he had a photographic memory.\n\nHe used the language, \"I am a tape recorder.\"\n\n-His name was Kozielewski, but Karski became his courier name and stayed with him.\n\n-He was a heavy smoker, but somehow he talked himself into believing that if he smokes only the end of the cigarette, it's healthy, it's still okay.\n\n-He is more than the president of the United States.\n\nI see a lord of humanity.\n\n-Karski used to mimic Roosevelt.\n\n-Long cigarette.\n\n-He would go like this.\n\n\"You tell your people that we shall win the war and then we shall do something about the refugees.\"\n\nAnd his response for that was, \"By then it will be too late.\"\n\n-Karski never wavered.\n\nNever.\n\nHe knew that there is just one truth, no different takes on it.\n\n-He was willing to try to save people who were not coreligionists.\n\nHe was Catholic, they were Jewish.\n\nAnd that's part of the courage and morality of Karski.\n\n-We can organize for you to visit a Jewish ghetto.\n\nWe can organize for you to visit a Jewish camp.\n\n-He almost had no choice.\n\nHe had to become a Jew, as he said, and he had to identify with the suffering people he saw.\n\n-Let's remember also, the Warsaw Ghetto was the capital of Poland.\n\nSo, although they were not his coreligionists, they were citizens of his country.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ I had the unique privilege of speaking at his funeral in St. Matthew's Cathedral in Washington, D.C., the very spot where the coffin of John F. Kennedy had stood.\n\nAs a tribute to Jan Karski, the Jewish community of Warsaw had sent over a Jewish star, and we placed it in his coffin because he was the voice of the Jewish community of Warsaw when they desperately needed a voice.\n\n-[ Reciting Kaddish ] -And I had the opportunity to recite the Jewish mourner's prayer, the Kaddish -- perhaps the first time that the Kaddish had been recited in the cathedral, and one of the very few times the Kaddish had been recited for a non-Jewish person.\n\n-If I was looking for a definition of righteousness, I would just say Karski.\n\n-Now, I remember.\n\n-There was a sort of underlying sadness about him.\n\nRather than being triumphant about his courageous ventures into the Warsaw Ghetto, there was a sadness about the fact that he hadn't broken through -- to President Roosevelt, to Supreme Court Justice Frankfurter, to the American public.\n\nThey either didn't want to believe, or might have believed, but felt it was inconvenient to believe.\n\n-It didn't make sense that a country of Bach and Beethoven, of Kant and of Heidegger and Hegel, would be capable of doing such things.\n\nHow could they become?\n\nWe presumed that that was going to be a barbaric act.\n\nSo we dismissed it.\n\n-Karski somehow, seeing it and being in Poland in 1942, he understood it ahead of time and really he understood what was happening.\n\nI don't think that a lot of the victims, a lot of Jews, understood what is happening.\n\nProbably those who understood died because they -- they lost any kind of hope.\n\nYou know, the hope was, in many cases, what carried people to survival.\n\n-This sin will haunt humanity to the end of time.\n\nIt haunts me now, and I want it to be so.\n\n-When he said, \"I want to be haunted by this,\" he never wanted to forget what he had seen, what he had tried to accomplish, and what, from his perspective, he had failed to do.\n\n-It's a powerful idea to want to be haunted by something and to make that choice.\n\nAnd it took Karski, I think, a while to say that.\n\nHe said it in 1981.\n\n-He thought that he had written two pretty good books.\n\n-Karski's memoir, \"Story of a Secret State,\" which he wrote, you know, before the war ended.\n\nThat was a Book of the Month club, a bestseller.\n\n-But what he really had done was teach a great many students who would never forget him.\n\n-For years, Jan Karski's students at Georgetown University knew he was a great professor.\n\nWhat they didn't realize was he was also a hero.\n\n-Alone onstage, dancing barefoot, a girl -- a Polish girl of outstanding beauty.\n\nHer name is Pola, a Polish girl named Pola.\n\nPola Nirenska.\n\n-He married a very beautiful, very talented dancer of Jewish origin.\n\n-It was a terrible, terrible affliction for him when she took her own life in 1992.\n\nShe lost something like 16 members of her family in the Holocaust.\n\nAnd I think finally it was just too much.\n\n-Try to imagine the people who see their loved ones dragged away to their deaths every day.\n\n-There are moral, ethical, personal questions and challenges that Karski raises.\n\nAnd, if you're working in the theater, you're constantly thinking about, \"What do we need to bear witness to today?\"\n\nAnd now we have this \"Bearing Witness: The Legacy of Jan Karski Today\" that we've been developing at Georgetown.\n\n-Language plays a huge role in our lives because it conveys social meaning and... -There are these all these sort of different touch points that come from Karski's life, resonates in these students, and then as these students are sort of going out in the world in different ways, they're really motivated by his sense of action and his sense of purpose.\n\n-We need figures like Karski in the world, and there are so many.\n\nAnd one of the best parts about teaching the course is that students come in, they come in from all over the world, they come in from all disciplines, and they talk about their Karskis.\n\n-I stand here not as a prophet, but as a humble servant.\n\n-I compared Jan Karski to models like Nelson Mandela on our continent.\n\nIt felt impossible for them to overturn sort of this powerful, large structure that was oppressive.\n\nAnd the fact that they tried is a surprise and a miracle, in a sense.\n\n-I think about the status of truth.\n\nHow do we know what to believe?\n\nThe sense of disinformation and of competing and alternate truths is so pervasive and such a crisis in the world, but in particularly, I think in the lives of students as they're trying to process and understand who to be and what to do.\n\n-When I walk past the bench, I remember.\n\nI get a feeling of what it means to be brave and to try hard to do something good.\n\n-If there is no effort at Allied intervention, within the year, the Jewish people of Poland will cease to exist.\n\n-For me, it was not only the importance of this Holocaust story and this one individual, but the lessons that he represented.\n\nI feel like it's incredibly relevant to what we're experiencing around the world.\n\n-Misinformation, disinformation.\n\nWho do we believe?\n\nWho do we know is telling the truth?\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nHow relative are these truths to each other?\n\n-One line in the film that human beings have infinite capacity to... -Have infinite capacity to ignore things that are not convenient.\n\n-And how do we stay engaged, interested?\n\nWhat can we do?\n\n-I think the best way to honor Jan Karski's memory, his courage, his morality... We can't all be Jan Karskis.\n\nThey're few and far between.\n\nBut it does mean speaking out when you see injustice, not turning a blind eye.\n\n-We need to interrogate.\n\nWe need to grapple.\n\nWe need to acknowledge.\n\n-All those I am reporting to are very important people.\n\nAnd I am an insignificant little man.\n\n-Bearing witness and talking about the truth and being honest about the truth and the things that we're seeing, those are things that enable us to have a future.\n\nAnd my hope is that it enables us to have a just future.\n\n-We don't, I think, have false illusions that a work of art is going to radically change some of the core issues that this play asks us to think about or grapple with.\n\nBut just as Karski did, I think significance comes from then individuals who, in witnessing it, find themselves taking more or different responsibility or wanting to live with some of the values and principles that Karski insisted on and espoused.\n\nAnd that, to me, as an artist... that feels like enough.\n\n-I'd like to read something that Jan wrote.\n\n\"I am old and no longer strong.\n\nI don't need courage anymore, so I teach compassion.\"\n\nHow wonderful.\n\nHow wonderful.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪"
