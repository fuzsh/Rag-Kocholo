The trio made a total of 190 shorts for Columbia Pictures between 1934 and 1959.\n\nCast[]\n\nMoe Howard\n\nLarry Fine\n\nCurly Howard\n\nBob Callahan\n\nChuck Callahan\n\nTony Chavex\n\nCasey Colombo\n\nLew Davis\n\nBilly Engle\n\nBudd Fine\n\nHarrison Greene\n\nJack Hill\n\nSol Horowitz\n\nWilliam Irving\n\nJohnny Kascier\n\nSam Lufkin\n\nBetty Mack\n\nEva McKenzie\n\nRobert McKenzie\n\nCy Schindell\n\nHerb Stagman\n\nEverett Sullivan\n\nElaine Waters\n\nBlackie Whiteford\n\nHarry Wilson\n\nPlot[]\n\nThe Stooges are hobos who get thrown off a freight train and end up being chased out of the railroad yard. They hide in the \"Hangover Athletic Club\" when all of the sudden Curly gets hired as a sparring partner. Ivan Bustoff, world wrestling champion, takes a liking to the Stooges, and his manager hires the three to make sure they check up on Bustoff so that he doesn't drink. When Ivan gets plastered, Moe sends out Curly disguised as Bustoff. Curly finally wins the match, when he goes berserk from smelling \"Wild Hyacinth\" perfume.\n\nNotes[]\n\nThis episode makes the first appearance of Cy Schindell with the Three Stooges. He had appeared in most Three Stooges episodes and appeared in some Three Stooges episode recycled footage from the previous ones after his death in 1948.\n\nThe title Grips, Grunts and Groans is a parody expression of \"gripes, grunts and groans.\"\n\nThis is one of the few films where Curly goes berserk caused by an external stimulus, the others being Punch Drunks, Horses' Collars, and Tassels in the Air.\n\nVideo[]"
