Up until Volume 1 (reviewed HERE) the Three Stooges on DVD had been a real mix'n match hodge-podge of un-restored titles and illogical entries. Sony are giving us the first concert effort to categorize, on digital, their huge body of work chronologically with many shorts seeing the digital light for the first time. The 2-disc bare-bones DVD package represents 13 shorts on dual layered disc 1 and 11 on dual-layered disc 2. They are progressively transferred and coded for regions 1 in the NTSC standard. Specifically:

Disc One (made in 1937 and 38'):

Grips, Grunts and Groans (1937), Dizzy Doctors (1937), 3 Dumb Clucks (1937), Back to the Woods (1937), Goofs and Saddles (1937), Cash and Carry (1937), Playing the Ponies (1937) and The Sitter-Downers (1937) and

Termites of 1938 (1938), Wee Wee Monsieur (1938), Tassels in the Air (1938), Healthy, Wealthy and Dumb (1938) and Violent Is the Word for Curly (1938)

Disc Two (made in 1938 - 39'):

Three Missing Links (1938), Mutts to You (1938), Flat Foot Stooges (1938) and

Three Little Sew and Sews (1939), We Want Our Mummy (1939), A-Ducking They Did Go (1939), Yes, We Have No Bonanza (1939), Saved by the Belle (1939), Calling All Curs (1939), Oily to Bed, Oily to Rise (1939), Three Sappy People (1939)

They are better looking than I ever remember from Saturday mornings and although there are no extras (save some unrelated Previews) the 7 hour plus entertainment value should suffice most fans. Contrast is exceptionally good considering the age, detail fairly strong with some light damage marks here and there - this package has no subtitle options. Audio shares some of the weakness but overall these look and sound exceptionally viewable. The best I have ever seen them.

Great fun and another healthy addition to the library to start any film night! Their body of work is so immense you can watch at anytime and it will probably seem fresh to you as these did to me. They are so fun and addictive (all Curlys too!) with zany plots and desperate physical visuals. This is actually superior to Volume 1 as there are 5 more 'episodes' and the trio were right in their slapstick stride. So do we recommend? - 'Soitenly... Nyuk, Nyuk, Nyuk'.
