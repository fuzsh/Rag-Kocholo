Compare how far your chosen films reflect the auteur signature features of their filmmakers

Introduction: what are the films’ differences in how they reflect auteurship. Casablanca produced in The Golden Age of Hollywood: lack of director freedom, vertical integration – in-house expenses. Bonnie and Clyde was made during The New Hollywood Era: Arthur Penn had more creative freedom to have a French New Wave style. Casablanca has little control/freedom, Bonnie and Clyde has narrative and technological freedom

Differences:

-Signature style – Warner Bros.’s style in the war was pro-American intervention. Institutions became auteurs due to their unique and recognisable styles – directors had little or no auteurship – limited creative freedom. Warner Bros.’s house style is present throughout the film. Warner brothers logo is shown which is an auteur feature. Jack Warner used real news footage in the opening sequence, and in the Paris sequence to show an audience this was real, and not just part of the film. Bonnie and Clyde features depictions of the Depression, but the issue had passed, so the filmmakers are not trying to convey a message. Arthur Penn had no consistent style, because he had creative freedom to make whatever films he wanted.

French influence: Bonnie and Clyde took inspiration from The French New Wave. Realist themes. Opening sequence analysis. Closing sequence makes visual reference to Breathless (Jean-Luc Godard, 1960) – a famous French film in the French New Wave style. Michel Pioccard’s glasses lens came out, before meeting an untimely death, like Clyde does

Casablanca: large, exotic sets, intricate details, hundreds of extras, large budget shown off – signature of Warner Bros. style

Bonnie and Clyde: shot on-location, extras are locals, smaller budget, no grand spectacles, sets are minimalist – signature of the French New Wave Style

TV: television effected the popularity of cinema. In the Golden Age, few TVs were sold, and new channels were broadcast in the south. Competition between studios and TV. 8 main studios suffered, Anti trust case weakened them, allowed independent and French films to influence independent filmmakers. This began the French influence in cinema: clear contrast between the styles of Casablanca and Bonnie and Clyde, reflecting their different auteur signatures and institutional contexts

Similarities:

-Creative staff

-Max Steiner composed music for Warner Bros. between 1937 and 1953 – helped develop Warner Bros.’s style. Selects and composes music that best fits the film. Does this is other Warner Bros. films, showing it is a signature style. ‘As Time Goes By’ is expertly placed, and goes from diegetic to non-diegetic seamlessly in the Paris sequence. Score is manipulative – end of the Leaving Rick’s sequence when Ilsa leaves with Laszlo: drops an octave to show Rick is sad. Shows Casablanca. Is the product of an institution, as music and scores are a large part of Warner Bros. films. Minimal non-diegetic sound in Bonnie and Clyde, except bluegrass music which represents the time and place the film is set in

-Hall B. Wallis – film producer for Warner Bros. – he was in control of choosing the casting – the cast is a large part of the studios auteurship, as actors were the face of the film. Wallis selected Ingrid Bergman, as she was young, pretty and relatable (after failing to contract Hedy Lamarr). Warren Beatty was the producer for Bonnie and Clyde. He selected actors he knew. Beatty is responsible for the depiction of Clyde as an unconventional male character. He greatly influenced the auteur style for Bonnie and Clyde

Michael Curtiz – Directed 102 films in his career, most for Warner Bros. he introduced many new camera techniques and ways of lighting – for example, using a soft focus for Ilsa to blur her background, giving her a ‘halo’ effect. He used fluid camera movements, resembling the modern SteadiCam. Casablanca reflects the auteur signature style due to Curtiz’s influence. Arthur Penn does not have a signature style. He has the freedom to change his approach to film. Instead, Newman and Benton are the ones who influenced the French Style of the film. They approached Francois Truffaut for input on the film – he did not direct the film, but he influenced the film. The film looks the way it does as a result of his input

Casablanca conclusion: many of the elements of filmmaking within Casablanca are representative of the general style of WarnerBrothers studios. Casablanca is extremely recognisable as a product of WarnerBrothers Studios because of elements such as cinematography, sound

Bonnie and Clyde conclusion: very different in all elements of film form. Indicative of a French New Wave style. More creative freedom for the director, but screenwriters has more freedom as a result of the weakening Hays Code, and changing times. Bonnie and Clyde has a clear French influence: New Hollywood featured edgy stories contrasting with Hollywood’s ‘happy endings.’ Independent films are often distinguishable from films produced by a large production company as their style and their content present the filmmaker’s artistic vision and not the production companies vision

Overall conclusion: The films are reflections of the auteur signature features which is shown by the house style in Casablanca, compared to the influence of The French New Wave in Bonnie and Clyde. Purpose of making the films differ due the contexts that they were made: Bonnie and Clyde was made as a representation of the lives of those living in the Depression, and Casablanca for a political agenda. Both films are the products of different goals

Compare how far your chosen films reflect the auteur signature features of their filmmakers

The auteur theory was introduced by Andre Bazin. The theory suggests that the director oversees all aspects of the film, making it fit into a particular aesthetic so that it is easily recognisable as their film. The director would then be considered the ‘author’ of the film. The auteur theory became relevant in 1930-1960, as the ‘Big 5 and Little 3’ were ‘churning out’ stylistically similar films to meet the demands of the audience, rather than creating a film with a personal meaning. Casablanca and Bonnie and Clyde are very different films due to their auteur influences, but also the times in which they were made. Institutional and political contexts influence that auteur’s approach to the filmmaking process. For example, Casablanca aimed to make the American public support American intervention in the war, and Bonnie and Clyde aimed to show an audience what a film should look like by being stylistically and thematically unique.

Casablanca is a romanticised story about the struggle to get to America in late 1941. The film is centrally about Rick and Ilsa who, despite their love for each other, must part for the greater good. It is a film about selflessness, patriotism and supports American intervention in the war.

Michel Curtiz is not an auteur on his own – Casablanca was the product of many different people – but the film still has a distinct style, reflecting the Warner Bros. house style, suggesting it is the product of a studio (or institutional) auteur. During the Classic Hollywood era, the 8 main studios dominated the industry by a process called vertical integration, and essentially oligopolised the industry; each studio (except Columbia) had theatre chains, distribution and exhibition rights, and some even manufactured their own equipment. All costs were ‘in-house’, which cut costs, and maximised profits. All the main studios had a ‘stable of actors’ who they had in ‘unbreakable contracts’, but Warner Bros. did not do this – instead, they had a ‘stable of creative staff’. This ‘stable of creative staff’ is the reason Casablanca has a distinct style.

Jack Warner acted as the executive producer – his influence is seen throughout the film, as he wanted to convince the American audience to support American intervention in the war. To do this, Warner used real news footage of refugees in the opening sequence, and during the occupation of Paris – this showed an audience that this was real, and not just a fictitious rendition of war-time events. He used real news footage, and showed the panic in Paris to remind an audience that the allies are suffering while America watches; this makes an audience guilty and uncomfortable. Hal B Wallis is another important person who helped develop the studio auteurship: he selected the actors for each film, which gave recognisable faces to the patriotic messages Jack Warner was conveying.

Max Steiner was also important in developing the Warner Bros. institutional auteurship. Steiner was one of the first to write musical scores for film – in fact, he was often referred to as ‘the father of film music’. His influences can be heard throughout. He expertly created scores that manipulated an audience, added drama to a scene, and more specifically, made the closing sequence all the more emotional. Cinematographer Arthur Edeson was also crucial in helping to create the distinct aesthetic seen in Casablanca. Edeson began his career as a photographer, giving him a creative advantage in his cinematography career. He experimented with shadows and lighting techniques to give a film more depth and detail, making him stand out at a time where many films were stylistically similar. His creative input as to how Ilsa was lit and framed, made her look innocent and youthful – this had an emotional impact on an audience. This technique is also used at the end with Rick, to show how he has changed from selfish and cynical to selfless and patriotic.

Michael Curtiz introduced new lighting techniques, and more importantly, introduced a fluid camera movement, resembling the modern-day SteadiCam. This can better be seen in Rick’s introductory sequence when the camera almost glides through the cafe, positioning the audience as a guest. This shows off another key feature of Warner Bros. auteurship – intricately detailed sets that accommodated the camera, and showed off the large production budget.

These men helped to give Warner Bros. a distinct style that stood out. Casablanca is clearly the product of an auteur institution because of the influences from Warner, Wallis, Curtiz, Steiner and Edeson. This differed greatly from Bonnie and Clyde, as at the time, Warner Bros. did not have a ‘stable of creative staff’ due to the collapse of vertical integration; although creative personnel contributed to the distinct style and aesthetic of Bonnie and Clyde, it cannot be said the film is a product of a single auteur.

Casablanca was built on a lot, as is typical of Warner Bros. (and other studios at the time). Films only began to be shot on-location in the 50s and 60s, showing that Casablanca is not only a product of the institution, but also the time it was created in. In addition, the set of Casablanca was large, detailed and emphasised the studio’s wealth. Often, wide shots were used to show the set off, mainly in Rick’s Cafe. The sets give an audience context – the streets of Casablanca are busy and heavily populated with a diverse range of people (showing off the hundreds of extras); Rick’s Cafe is luxurious, well-lit and intricately detailed; and Paris is a stereotypical presentation of France, and is also very detailed. A large, detailed, expensive set that accommodates the camera is a main feature of Warner Bros. auteurship.

It can be argued that the main reason Bonnie and Clyde was able to be so stylistically different was because of the Antitrust case (Paramount vs America). The Supreme Court ruled that studios could no longer control all stages of filmmaking, and prohibited studios from block booking more than 5 films (later, this was completely banned when the studios failed to obey – the banning of block booking was heavily influenced by SIMPP – Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers). The allowed foreign and independent films to make their way into American theatres, thus influencing American filmmakers to change their film style. Bonnie and Clyde is loosely based off the true story of the duo’s spree across America from 1932-1934 in The Great Depression.

In the final scene of Bonnie and Clyde, there is a visual reference to Breathless (Jean-Luc Godard, 1960) when one of the lenses of Clyde’s glasses comes out – this happened to Michel Pioccard in the closing sequence before he was shot and killed by police. This isn’t the only similarity Breathless holds to Bonnie and Clyde: Pioccard (who was, ironically, created to resemble Humphrey Bogarts typical brooding cynic character) impulsively shoots and kills a policeman whilst driving a stolen car, leading to his life on the lam; this is similar to when Clyde shoots the bank teller in the botched heist, catalysing their inevitable doom. These similarities are indicative of the influence The French New Wave had on Bonnie and Clyde, greatly helping to develop a distinct style.

Arthur Penn cannot be considered an auteur for Bonnie and Clyde for the same reason Michael Curtiz cannot be considered an auteur for Casablanca – many of the visual and technological techniques were adopted from The French New Wave – or in Casablanca’s case, film noir, and other American films that came before it. After 1945, French film hadn’t changed, and French filmmakers continued to make films about a war that most French would want to forget – so, young audiences especially lost interest, creating room for young filmmakers to fill the void in the industry. Post-war attitudes about the world inspired Francois Truffaut and other film critics to disparage the lack of artistic freedom, and visual sameness of films, a sameness that could also be seen in Hollywood films. Some of the most famous French film directors were Jacque Rivette, Claud Chabrol, Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut, who wrote The 400 Blows (Francois Truffaut, 1959), which features rebellious youths in trouble with the law, which inspired the filmmakers of Bonnie and Clyde. David Newman and Robert Benton wrote the script for Bonnie and Clyde, and because both appreciated The French New Wave, they approached Francois Truffaut, asking him to direct the film. He turned them down, and the two eventually managed to get Arthur Penn to direct the film. Editor Dede Allen embraced the freedom granted by this new French style, and created her own style of editing – a style that can be seen in many films she edited. Warren Beatty was the star and producer, selecting the actors, and oversaw the development of the script. Whilst Penn is not an auteur in his own right, the filmmakers and innovations of the French New Wave meant Bonnie and Clyde had a distinct style that was loved across America, and the world.

The use of cinematography and lighting in Casablanca is reflective of Warner Bros. institutional auteurship; many Warner Bros. films were reminiscent of film noir (as colour was primitive, and black and white seemed more ‘mature’). Rick is introduced through first his actions (playing chess alone – he’s isolated), then his attire (a white suit and black tie – unconventional), then his face is shown (shadowed and somber-looking). The use of low-key lighting, shadowing, and slowing revealing Rick’s character is typical of Arthur Edeson’s cinematography style. In contrast, Ilsa is well lit, in soft focus, and a catch light is used to make her eyes sparkle to show her innocence. This use of lighting, framing and character-perfection is carefully choreographed, and purposeful to manipulate an audience. It differs greatly from Bonnie and Clyde whose framing is improvised, lighting is minimal due to camera advancements, and characters are deeply flawed to reflect the French New Wave style of minimalism, and realism.

The French New Wave is characterised by hand-held camera movements, on-location shooting and advanced cameras with faster film stock to allow natural light to be used. In contrast, Casablanca uses a static camera, wide shots and is built on a lot so the set can accommodate the masses of equipment. This is seen in Rick’s introductory sequence, where the doors of the cafe are opened for the camera, and characters move out the way of the camera. Bonnie and Clyde being shot on-location in a Southern state that never recovered from the Depression reflects real life, and is indicative of French influence. This can be seen in multiple scenes; for example, when Clyde chases after Bonnie, a large cloud shadows the scene, making it hard to see the characters in the distance – this lack of control over external factors is typical of on-location shooting, and absent in films shot on a lot, like Casablanca.

In Casablanca, the characters move to reframe a scene. This is seen when Rick walks over to Ilsa in the cafe. The scene begins in a mid shot of Rick and Ilsa in deep focus, so that when Renault and Laszlo walk into frame, they are in clear view. The scene goes from a four shot, to a close up of Rick, then Laszlo, to a three-shot, and then a two-shot. The characters move within the shot to re-frame the scene – careful choreography is a key feature of Warner Bros. auteurship. In comparison, Bonnie and Clyde is not carefully choreographed, and is much more improvised, consistent with the French New Wave style. This is seen in the opening sequence: Bonnie moves around her room, and the camera follows her movement. At one point, the camera pushes into a close-up, but missed the focus point. Furthermore, throughout the film, the camera is often set further back in a wide shot to allow the characters to move within the scene, and capture everything they do such as at the beginning of the botched heist sequence.

The two films also use different sound techniques. In Rick’s Cafe, there is often diegetic music low in the mix played by Sam at his piano, or general murmurs from customers. Natural sounds lend verisimilitude to Bonnie and Clyde, reflecting the natural, on-location setting. Often in films from the Golden Age of Hollywood, diegetic sounds are unrealistically loud (such as the characters being heard over the sound of the plane in the closing sequence of Casablanca). The unnatural sounds that are organised perfectly in the mix shows it is a product of being filmed on a lot – typical of the Warner Bros. house style at the time.

Editing is also a big stylistic difference between the two films. This is best seen when putting the two closing sequences side-by side. The editing in Casablanca’s closing sequence is carefully thought-out to optimise the sadness felt by the audience. Continuity editing is used when necessary, consisting of ‘invisible’ cuts, and ellipsis. In contrast, the editing in the closing sequence of Bonnie and Clyde is erratic, and reflects the violence – close-ups and mid shots are edited together to draw out the death sequence, heightening emotion. Multiple cameras were running at different distances, frame rates and angles to give variation to the scene, allowing editor Dede Allen to be creative. This is a huge difference between the films’ style, both styles denoting to their production contexts, and auteurs.

Overall, both films reflect their institutional auteur to an extent, but they more so reflect their production contexts. Of course, had it not been for the French New Wave, Bonnie and Clyde would not have looked the way it did; but had it not been for the collapse of vertical integration, the Antitrust case, and the weakening Hays Code (that forbid violent or sexual imagery), French cinema would not have been able to influence American filmmakers. Neither film conform to the typical definition of an auteur, as the director’s films change style throughout time, but both feature the signature styles of those working on the film. It is the creative staff that contributes to the style of each film. Steiner’s compositions, Edeson’s lighting and cinematography influences, Hal B. Wallis’ selection of creative personnel, Curtiz’s framing and camera techniques and and Jack Warner’s political input shaped Casablanca, adding to the Warner Bros. house style. Put together, these men contributed the Casablanca’s structure and auteur techniques. David Newman and Robert Benton’s script (with Truffaut’s input), Dede Allen’s innovative editing, Beatty’s choice of actors and his use of method acting to present Clyde, Penn’s directorship, and of course, the influence of The French New Wave shaped Bonnie and Clyde. It is because of these people that Bonnie and Clyde can be considered the product of an auteurship, along with the reflection of the French New Wave style.

How useful has an ideological critical approach been in analysing the films you have studied? Refer in detail to one or more sequences from each film

Brief plan

Intro: key themes/ideologies in both; stereotypes and binary opposition to portray ideologies

Trainspotting

Point 1: What would the preferred, oppositional and negotiated reading be? What makes an audience take on a preferred reading? Audience positioned to change their view throughout the film. Aligned with Renton from opening sequence

Point 2: Focus on drug addiction in lives of youths. Opening sequence shows drugs are an alternative to a ‘boring life’. Binary opposition of conformity and non-conformity, old and young. Choose rave culture and drugs over responsibility. Anti-capitalism – not to become their parents. Toilet scene – drugs are bright. Football scene, opposition is clean

Point 3: When do ideologies change – Renton’s overdose. Binary opposites of realism and surrealism shows a disconnect and uncertainty about reality. ‘Perfect Day’ by Lou Reed – juxtaposes dangers of addiction

Conclusion: Trainspotting explores the ideology of drugs through binary oppositions. The final monologue tells an audience Renton is joining the capitalist society – he chooses life over drugs. Drugs were a part of youth, not of life

This is England

Point 1: What would a preferred, oppositional and negotiated reading be? A positive view on skinheads, represented by Woody – they aren’t all terrorists and racists. Slow motion and wide shots of Shaun in friends montage promotes the ideology of the skinhead movement as positive for young people – encouraging viewers accept the preferred reading

Point 2: Opening montage is accompanied with soul music – skinheads initially liked soul music – not racists. Binary opposition between apolitical skinheads and the racist skinheads. Montage when Combo tells the racist story. Slow motion and composed score makes an audience reject the messages Combo is spreading. Racist brother montage

Point 3: Paternity. Woody and Combo act as father-figures, moulding Shaun’s ideologies. Woody comforts him, includes him and buys him clothes. An audience are positioned to like Woody. An audience are discouraged from liking Combo’s paternal position because he’s racist – Shaun has accepted these ideologies, and an audience are told to not like this though the manipulative, sad music. Binary opposition between Woody and Combo. An audience don’t dislike Shaun, as he is impressionable and manipulated

Conclusion: This is England uses binary opposition to present different ideologies. KEOFF makes an audience sympathise with certain characters, and are encouraged to take on the preferred reading

Overall conclusion: The films explore ideologies relevant to the time, politics and social contexts. Youth culture is a main feature in both films. The preferred reading in Trainspotting is addiction, and the danger of drugs. In This is England, racism and the non-racist skinheads are used to represent youth, and impressionability

Plan

Introduction: outline the key themes in both films, relating it to appropriate ideologies (like nihilism and capitalism in Trainspotting (Danny Boyle, 1996), and racism for This is England (Shane Meadows, 2007)). Stereotypes and binary opposites present attitudes to an audience. Different types of reading (preferred, oppositional, and negotiated), and why an audience may have different readings

Point 1: What would a preferred reading be, and why may an audience take on the preferred reading? That drugs are flawed, and you should choose life over drugs; an audience are positioned to change their view on drugs, and undergo the same moral realisations as Renton. What would an oppositional reading be? That drugs are glorified by the film, and it is not a bad thing to choose addiction over a traditional lifestyle. What would a negotiated reading be? A balanced view on drugs – there are benefits and downsides

Point 2: Focus on drug addiction in the lives of youths. Opening scene sees young adults taking drugs – drugs are an alternative to a ‘boring life’, or responsibility. Binary opposition of conformity and non-conformity, and old and young. They choose raves and drugs over a traditional life – avoid a lifestyle like their parents’. Messages of anti-capitalism. Drugs are a ‘lifeline’ – in the expressionistic toilet scene, the drugs are a bright white, contrasting the grotesque toilet. Binary opposition of those who do drugs and those who don’t – opening sequence with Renton and his friends playing football. They are dressed in poor clothing and overall look messy – the group they are playing against are non-drug users, which is shown by their clean appearance. More-or-less the same age, same culture but taking a different approach to life

Point 3: Discuss the point at which ideologies change. Renton’s overdose puts an audience in the position of a drug addict. Binary opposites of realism and surrealism shows a disconnect and uncertainty about reality. ‘Perfect Day’ by Lou Reed is played over the overdose scene at the hospital – juxtaposes dangers of addiction. An audience see drugs differently now

Conclusion: Trainspotting explores the ideology of drugs through binary oppositions. The final monologue tells an audience Renton is joining the capitalist society – he chooses life over the dangerous, drug-addled lifestyle

Point 1: What is the preferred reading? A positive view on skinheads, represented by Woody – they aren’t all terrorists and racists. The use of slow motion and wide shots of Shaun having fun with Woody’s gang promotes the ideology of the skinhead movement as positive for young people – encouraging viewers to take the preferred reading of the film. An oppositional reading would ignore Woody’s pacifist ideology, and opt to categorise all skinheads as racists. A negotiated reading would be that some skinheads are bad, but even Woody is anti-social and undesirable

Point 2: Skinhead culture was prevalent in Britain in the 1980s. Opening montage is accompanied with soul music – a liking of soul music manifested as the skinhead style (wasn’t always associated with racism). Binary opposition is a big part of the film – the apolitical skinheads (Woody’s gang) and the racist skinheads (Combo’s gang). As Combo tells a racist story to Woody’s group, slow motion is used – shows enthusiastic facial expressions of Combo, uncomfortable expressions from some of Woody’s gang, and some are shown to be laughing at the story. The composed score makes an audience reject the messages Combo is spreading

Point 3: Another key ideological view-point is paternity. After the opening montage, there is a close-up of a photo of Shaun’s deceased father, followed by mid-shot of Shaun who looks at the photo. Woody and Combo act as father-figures, moulding Shaun’s own ideologies. Woody comforts him, includes him and buys him clothes. An audience are positioned to like Woody. When Shaun turns to Combo, an audience are discouraged from liking Combo’s paternal position. In the racist brother montage, Shaun smiles when Combo threatens three young boys – Shaun has accepted these ideologies, and an audience are told to not like this though the manipulative, sad music. Binary opposition between Woody and Combo emphasises the differences in skinhead ideologies. An audience don’t dislike Shaun, as he is impressionable and manipulated

Conclusion: This is England uses binary opposition to present different ideologies. KEOFF makes an audience sympathise with certain characters, and are encouraged to take on the preferred reading

Overall conclusion: The films explore ideologies relevant to the time, politics and social contexts. Youth culture is a main feature in both films. The preferred reading and dominant ideology in Trainspotting is addiction, and the danger of drugs. In This is England, racism and the non-racist skinheads are used to represent youth, and impressionability. The film aims to highlight racism/nationalism and the skinhead movements as two, separate things.

How useful has an ideological critical approach been in analysing the films you have studied? Refer in detail to one or more sequences from each film

Version 1

Trainspotting (Danny Boyle, 1996) and This is England (Shane Meadows, 2007) present the life of youths in the 1980s using contexts, pop culture, and relevant ideologies. Ideologies can change throughout a film, like in Trainspotting: nihilism and anti-capitalism are the dominant ideologies, and turn to optimism and capitalism by the end. Racism and paternity are key themes in This is England, and the impressionability of youth is used to emphasise the difference between skinheads and nationalists. Stereotypes and binary opposites are used to further portray ideologies to an audience, and help the film to be read in a way filmmakers want.

Ideologies are a set of beliefs or values within a film for an audience to interpret. In Stuart Hall’s reception theory, there are three readings: preferred (the messages are accepted as the filmmaker intended them to be), oppositional (an audience rejects the ideologies and messages within the film) or negotiated (an audience sifts through the messages, and chooses what to accept, and what to reject). In order to make an audience take on the preferred reading, filmmakers must employ key elements of film form in order to make an audience perceive the film as intended.

The preferred reading of Trainspotting may be that drugs are not to be prioritised above life, and addiction is not an alternative to a traditional lifestyle. An audience are positioned to change their view on drugs, and come to recognise, like Renton, that addiction isn’t the alternative to life, and that there is nothing wrong with choosing life over drugs. An oppositional reading would be that drugs are glorified by the film, and it is not a bad thing to choose addiction over a traditional lifestyle. Finally, a negotiated reading would be a balanced view on drugs, arguing there are benefits to drugs that can outweigh the disastrous consequences. Like This is England, Trainspotting presents the characters as impressionable youths who gave in to the temptation of drugs. In the opening sequence, the soundtrack (Lust for Life, Iggy Pop) and camera movements are playful, reflecting Renton’s attitude towards drugs, positioning an audience to see things from his POV. The camera moves fluidly, and the mise-en-scene used in the drug den doesn’t make it appear as disgusting as it should. Renton’s narration brings together the scenes in the opening sequence, given an audience context, whilst also giving auditory aid to the sequence on-screen. Right from the start, an audience see things how Renton wants them to.

Binary opposition and key elements of film form are used expertly in the opening sequence. There is a strong focus on rebellion and drug addiction in the lives of youths as an alternative to life. Binary opposition of conformity and non-conformity, as well as fun youth culture and boring old-age highlights the youths preference for drug use over responsibility in a bid to never fall into the miserable lifestyle of the older generations. There is also binary opposition between those who abuse drugs, and those who don’t; Renton, Sick Boy and Spud are sybaritic drug abusers, whereas Begbie and Tommy (to begin with) are legal, hedonistic drug abusers (smoking and drinking). In the opening sequence, Begbie and Tommy criticise heroine, whilst drinking and smoking. The hypocrisy reflects the corrupt society of the time, and also reflects the ways in which different characters escape a traditional, morally balanced lifestyle that is full of responsibility, rules and regulation that any of these morally questionable characters would shy from.

Again, binary opposition is used in the mise-en-scene of the opening sequence. When the gang play football, Renton’s side are messy, dressed poorly and overall look unkempt, whereas the side they are playing against are in uniform, hold themselves more confidently, and appear cleaner. The filmmakers have drawn from stereotypes to present Renton’s team as drug abusers, and contrasted this with a tidier-looking oppositional team. These characters are all roughly the same age, yet have a very different approach to life. The oppositional team represents what life could be like if Renton wasn’t an addict, and ‘chose life’. Characters like Renton are reliant on drugs, and this is obvious in how the addict characters are represented in contrast to those who aren’t addicts; this is seen in the toilet scene, where everything is dark and grotesque, except the drugs which are a bright white, representing how Renton sees them – the only thing he looks for and wants in life.

The point at which ideology changes from nihilism and anti-capitalism to optimism and capitalism is when Renton overdoses. An audience are shown Renton’s POV as he literally sinks into the carpet – this representatively demonstrates Renton’s disconnect from reality. This is emphasised by the binary opposition between realism and surrealism, and the contrast between the severity of the overdose, and Renton’s pleasure. An audience are made to feel uncomfortable, and are finally made to face Renton’s view on addiction. His view on addiction is reflected in the song, Perfect Day by Lou Reed, which makes an audience further disconnect from Renton, and his view on drugs.

Overall, Trainspotting emphasises the damage of addiction through binary opposition, for example, drug users and non-drug users, non-conformity and conformity, and young and old. Renton’s final monologue (which is a repetition of his first monologue, only more optimistic and heart-felt) suggests that the ideology of addiction and rebellion is part of youth, rather than a lifestyle choice. Looking at Trainspotting through a variety of ideological lenses enables viewers to see that the film doesn’t glorify drugs and criticise a traditional lifestyle, it does the opposite – the film shows an audience the damaging lifestyle of addiction, and the implicit positive outcomes of ‘choosing life’.

This is England is about 12-year-old Shaun in 1980s Britain. The film starts with Shaun befriending a group of skinheads who incorporate him into their group. But, when the racist ex-convict Combo arrives, the harmony of the group is disturbed, and Shaun has to choose between his friends, or a group that promises to support the same cause his father had.

The preferred reading of This is England would accept the positive message of skinheads like Woody, and see that skinheads weren’t originally a group of racist, anti-social youths. The binary opposition between Woody and Combo tells as audience that they are very different people, despite both being skinheads, and not to judge the characters from a first look. There were skinheads that liked music (soul music in particular), and racist, nationalist skinheads which are more familiar to a modern-day audience. The fun with friends montage shows Shaun having fun with the gang by using slow motion, long and wide shots, and the non-diegetic score is Louie Louie by the Toots and The Maytals – a very upbeat, happy song. This promotes the ideology of the skinhead movement as positive for youths – key elements of film form encourages an audience to accept the preferred reading. An oppositional reading would associate both groups of skinheads with racisms and nationalism, opting to categorise all skinheads as racist, regardless of the positive presentation of Woody’s group, and their pacifist ideology. A negotiated reading would be able to tell the difference between the two groups, but would see Woody as anti-social and undesirable regardless of his presentation.

The opening montage is accompanied with soul music, which reflects the skinhead’s liking of soul music. A liking of soul music manifested as the skinhead style, before it was taken over by the racists. The upbeat non-diegetic score juxtaposes some of the more hard-hitting segments in this montage, such as the Falkland Islands War, closure of the mines and terrorism, establishing violence as a theme in the film. Binary opposition is a key part of the film, and the binary opposition between the two ‘factions’ of skinheads is first established when Combo tells the racist story. Slow motion emphasises the discomfort and unhappiness felt in some members of Woody’s group. Close-ups combined with slow motion place emphasis on Combo’s avid facial expressions, showing an audience his passion for his beliefs. The non-diegetic score is in a minor key, so it makes an audience feel sad – this is a manipulative technique to make an audience see the divide in ideologies, and tells an audience to reject Combo’s ideologies and messages. The first montage with Woody’s gang is mirrored in the montage with Combo’s gang, showing Shaun’s assimilation and acceptance of the racist ideologies – but the despondent piano score tells an audience this isn’t wholesome and cheerful. Rather than being connected through their apolitical ideologies and friendship, this gang is connected through their racist ideologies, and misplaced blame on minority groups.

Another ideological view-point is paternity, and impressionability of youth. These two are combined to convey Shaun’s need for a paternity figure, but also how easily he is manipulated by this father-figure. After the opening montage, there is a close-up of a photo of Shaun’s deceased father, followed by mid-shot of Shaun who looks at the photo. Woody and Combo act as father-figures, moulding Shaun’s own ideologies. Woody comforts him, includes him and buys him clothes – an audience are positioned to like Woody through his actions. When Shaun turns to Combo, an audience are discouraged from liking Combo’s paternal position, as in the racist brother montage, shot reverse-shot is used between a close-up of Combo as he threatens the Pakistani boys with slurs and a knife, and a close-up of Shaun smiling at the threats – Shaun has accepted these ideologies, and an audience are told to not like this though the manipulative, sad music. Binary opposition between Woody and Combo emphasises the differences in skinhead ideologies, telling an audience not to view skinheads as all the same. An audience don’t dislike Shaun, as he is impressionable and manipulated by the man he idolises – Combo has exploited Shaun’s need for a father-figure to turn him into a violent, racist member of his group. Shaun’s impressionability and age is used to encourage viewers to favour Woody, and disconnect from Combo’s ideological views.

This is England uses binary opposition to present different ideologies, and encourages an audience to accept the preferred reading. Key elements of film form further manipulate an audience through use of emotive soundtracks and montages. The ideological focus is on the skinhead movement, and this is emphasised by using the binary opposition between apolitical ‘music’ skinheads, and the racist skinheads.

Both films explore ideologies relevant to the time, politics and social contexts. Youth culture is a main feature in both films, and both are similar to social realism, but are too manipulative to be truly social realist films. The preferred reading and dominant ideology in Trainspotting is the danger of drugs, and addiction. In This is England, the binary opposition between the racist and the non-racist skinheads is used to represent youth, and impressionability. The film aims to highlight racism/nationalism and the skinhead movements as two, separate things, using Shaun and his impressionability to encourage the audience to side with Woody, and dislike Combo.

Explore how the narratives of the films you have studied influence your response to key characters.

Plan

Introduction: Introduce both films in terms of narrative approaches

Introduction: Briefly introduce Trainspotting (Danny Boyle, 1996)

Point 1: Discuss how time is used to position an audience to see things from Renton’s perspective. How does the narrative effect what an audience thinks? Little to no indication of time makes an audience more dependent on the narration to follow along.

Point 2: Discuss how narration helps an audience to understand, and how the visuals are an illustration of the narration. The narration drives the plot, and the narrative depends on the combination of visuals (key elements) and narration

Point 3: How does an audience’s view change through the film and why? Does this align with Renton’s view

Introduction: Briefly introduce This is England (Shane Meadows, 2007

Point 1: Discuss how montages are used, and how this can be applied to the equilibrium theory. How does this effect how an audience view Shaun and the gangs?

Point 2: How are montages used to show that Combo is a bad character? Does this change an audience’s opinion on Shaun?

Point 3: How does the use of the final montage (real news footage of the Falkland Islands war) effect or manipulate an audience’s response to what they have just seen? What does this make an audience think of Combo, and the other nationalists?

Conclusion: Make a link to how both films use montages to drive narrative – comparison (although not required, comparing how montages are used to different effects helps to convey a point)

Version 1

Both Trainspotting (Danny Boyle, 1996) and This is England (Shane Meadows, 2007) follows various young characters in the 1980s and 1990s. Both films could be considered social realist films, but they use manipulative techniques that tell an audience how to feel, rather than letting viewers interpret a film in their own way. The approach to narratives presents themes, characters and ideologies differently to create different responses to each character.

Trainspotting follows Mark Renton, a heroine addict, and his friends who battle their own addiction or issues. There is ellipsis, montages and narrative changes to present different ‘chapters’ in Renton’s life, which all together makes an audience see the film world from Renton’s perspective. The narrative perspective begins to change as scenes become more surreal, and less reliable, indicative of Renton’s unreliable memory and judgement. An audience realise with Renton, that his drug habit needs to stop due to his unreliability and deteriorating health.

The film has a non-linear narrative, as the first sequence is a scene from the middle of the film – the chronological order of the film does not lie parallel to the plot. To position an audience to see things from Renton’s perspective, there is little indication of time (day and night, or how much time has passed from scene to scene). It is unclear as to how much time passes, which makes the film appear like episodes, or highlights of Renton’s life. For example, Spud goes to prison for six months, during which time, Renton moves to London; back in Edinburgh, Spud is at Tommy’s funeral, suggesting that at least six months have passed. Additionally, we don’t see Spud in prison, as Renton didn’t visit him, nor even think about him – an audience are positioned to see things from Renton’s point of view. The narrative is structured to reflect how a heroine addict may perceive time – in the sequence where Baby Dawn is found dead, Renton says he doesn’t know how much time passes – seemingly random scenes are presented, and it is only because of the narration that they make sense, which positions an audience to see things from Renton’s POV. An audience are aligned with Renton, as without any indication of time, an audience rely more on Renton’s narration to follow along. Trainspotting does not follow Vladimir Prop’s 31 narrative points to emphasise the uncertainty about time, which in turn makes an audience unsure of events, and when and if they happen. The uncertainty about time and events is used to show an audience that heroine is bad, which makes an audience root for Renton when he attempts to withdraw.

An audience are aligned with Renton from the start – he is established as the main character as he is introduced first, and by use of cinematography (centrally framed and tracked by a hand-held camera). Perhaps the most iconic thing in Trainspotting is the monologue at the beginning. It is similar to a 90s anti-drug campaign, but with an ironic twist. The sarcasm and way in which Renton delivers the poetic lines tells an audience he doesn’t agree with the traditional way of living. He is nihilistic, rejects a traditional lifestyle, and chooses to remain unemployed to exercise the small amount of power he has. This is illustrated by the visuals – Renton running away from police, clearly having broken the law. This rejection of capitalism is representative of the ideologies many of the working-class held at the time, telling an audience something about Renton’s beliefs. Renton’s narration not only illustrates the visuals, but also shows he is an articulate, appealing character an audience can relate with. The opening scene is paired with ‘Lust for Life – Iggy Pop’, which reflects Renton’s opinion on the situation. Him running from the law and consequences of his actions is something he is all too familiar with, and takes enjoyment out of (demonstrated when he laughs at the camera). This enjoyment is contrasted later in the film when we see the sequence again (in chronological order), but this time, an audience see the repercussions. This now shows that Renton sees the more serious effects of drug use. When Renton and Spud are punished for their crimes, it could be seen as a turning point for Renton, making an audience believe he is changing. His beliefs are completely reversed by the end, as now that he has money, he embraces capitalism and is much more optimistic about his life. This makes an audience see he has changed for the better through use of mirroring previously used narrative techniques (the first montage, and his monologue).

An audience respond positively to Renton’s decision to move to London after witnessing the horrible things drugs have caused. However, the London montage would suggest that Renton is unsure, or missing home. The non-diegetic composed score is arguably poor music from the 90s, contrasting the upbeat Iggy Pop songs previously heard in scenes where Renton is in Edinburgh. An audience are made to think that something will make Renton go back to Edinburgh, especially because London represents everything he said he hated in his monologue (Thatcherism). Furthermore, his apartment in London is no better than his previous apartment that was small, cheap and unappealing. Although he is trying to change his life, he is still trapped by his poverty and outlook on life.

Throughout the film, an audience are positioned to see things from Renton’s POV. Initially, an audience enjoy the youthful rebellion, but, as the film goes on, sequences become more surreal and expressionistic, reflecting Renton’s addiction and uncertainty about time and events. Viewers begin to see the effects of drugs, and are now positioned to want him to stop doing heroine. The film ‘comes full circle’ in the final montage – Renton gives in to the traditional way of life, rejecting his previously nihilistic, pessimistic views, and embracing Thatcherism. Throughout the film, an audience’s perspective changes with Renton’s – when he starts to see wrong in his ways, so do an audience; being rebellious becomes less fun, and more detrimental to life, and this is conveyed using narrative techniques. His final monologue would suggest that addiction is part of youth, not of life.

This is England differs from Trainspotting in that an audience aren’t always positioned to agree with the protagonist. The film follows 12-year-old Shaun who makes friends with a group of skinheads led by Woody – they’re not the traditional racist skinheads, rather, a group that like soul music. Equilibrium is disrupted when Combo – a racist ex-convict – arrives, and spreads his racist views. Shaun feels he is supporting the cause his father died for, and so joins Combo. Combo indoctrinates Shaun with his racist ideologies, and an audience are not positioned to support this, rather, want him to return to Woody. An audience see Shaun’s change as him being misled, rather than him being an evil character.

This is England allows an audience to observe Shaun’s story, without providing narration to manipulate viewer’s interpretations. But, the film is not without manipulative narrative techniques – many montages and manipulative scores are used to tell an audience how to feel. The first montage shows an audience Shaun’s loneliness as he plays by himself on an isolated beach (as his mother is at work, and he has no friends). A manipulative, composed, non-diegetic score is high in the mix to encourage viewers to sympathise with him. This in turn encourages an audience to like Woody, because he invites him into the group when he needs friends. A second montage is used to contrast Shaun’s loneliness, and his new-found happiness with the skinheads. This narrative technique makes an audience like Woody and his gang for including Shaun, and making him happy. The camera focuses on the character’s reactions and happiness in a range of shots to further encourage an audience to like Woody and the group. Furthermore, an up-beat, non-diegetic composed score is high in the mix to support the idea that the group are happy. This point in the film could be considered ‘equilibrium’, as the characters are at their happiest, and most peaceful.

An audience are told that they shouldn’t like Combo through how he talks, and how he makes other characters feel. When he is telling his racist story of when he was in prison, the dialogue slowly lowers in the mix, and a sad, non-diegetic composed score rises in the mix to tell an audience to feel sad. This can be considered disruption to equilibrium in Todorov’s equilibrium theory. When Shaun joins Combo’s nationalist group, an audience don’t begin to dislike Shaun – instead, an audience feel sorry for Shaun, as Combo used his father’s passing to manipulate him, exploiting his vulnerability and impressionability. Another montage is used to show Shaun’s change – this montage is similar to the previous ‘fun with friends’ montage with Woody’s group. For example, Woody’s gang innocently played football, whereas Combo stole a ball from three children, and threatened them. The similarity between these two scenes shows an audience how Combo is the opposite to Woody, and that he is leading Shaun astray. Like Woody, Combo is a father-figure to Shaun, so the similarity between the montages drives the plot forward, as it creates a divide between the two ‘worlds’ Shaun must choose between. Despite Shaun’s involvement in and support for the racist group, an audience aren’t encouraged to dislike him, because of his age and vulnerability. An audience are positioned to see that Combo’s group are ridiculous, and not as tough as they think – this is demonstrated in the ‘racist brother’ montage. It starts with the group walking towards the camera in slow motion, the English flag superimposed behind them. The group graffiti a tunnel, and shout slurs at a couple of women walking through. This shows that the group are pathetic, almost comically so, but they are threatening. This further encourages an audience to not like Combo.

After Combo beat Milky unconscious, real footage of the Falkland Islands war plays, comparing the previously seen violence to the war. An audience see the British soldiers and the ‘battlefield’ behind them, and some of their captured enemies – the battlefield is farmland, and their enemies are mere farmers, clearly much less powerful and outnumbered by the British. The British were much more powerful, and outnumbered the Argentinians and Falkland Islanders, much like the nationalists were a more powerful force, and outnumbered the minority groups. This can be applied to when Combo beat up Milky – Combo bullies and terrorises minority groups, and it achieves nothing. This makes an audience respond negatively to Combo and the nationalists, as they oppressed minority groups to display power.

Montages in This is England mark turning points in the film: Shaun’s loneliness, his new friends, Combo’s racism, Shaun joining Combo, and the Falkland Islands war footage. The montages are paired with highly manipulative, non-diegetic composed scores to tell an audience how to feel. Both of these narrative techniques also tells an audience what to think about each character – for example, in the first montage, an audience are encouraged to feel sorry for Shaun.

In Trainspotting and This is England, an audience are initially positioned to see things from the protagonist’s POV, and follow them throughout each film, audience positioning changing. Viewers are encouraged to support the protagonists in each film through the use of narrative techniques: montages and manipulative scores are used in both films to manipulate an audience’s perspective. These two narrative techniques align an audience with the main character to make them more sympathetic, but also highlights the problems they are facing (such as withdrawal, or assimilation into a racist group). Even when characters are struggling, viewers are encouraged to like them still, because they have context of the situation. Overall, the narrative structure of both films, and audience positions influences a positive response to the main characters.

Compare how far your chosen films reflect their different production contexts

Casablanca (Michale Curtiz, 1942)

Differences

Cultural

-German expressionism, war, film noir influences

-High and low contrast lighting – dramatised and emotional

-Patriotic messages

Historical

-Correspond with war-time events

Institutional

-Large budget

-Censors and restrictions

-Hase code, no blood, violence or sexual implications

-Jack Warner had a lot of influence over the messages and themes present in the film, he is responsible for the pro-American-intervention messages

-Themes challenge an audience, telling them that America should intervene – Jack Warner had an ulterior motive for making the film

-Vertical integration, oligopoly – Warner Bros. part of The Big Five dominated the market. Not foreign influence or independent studios

-Shot in a studio set

-Dramatised characters

-Actors attached to a studio

Another aspect of the studio system in The Golden Age of Hollywood were the unbreakable contracts; actors were ‘attached’ to a studio after signing a contract, meaning they could not choose which films they starred in, or which studios they acted for. This is very different to how contracting actors was in the New Age of Hollywood, where actors could pick the films they starred in. This is an important aspect of films in the height of The Golden Age of Hollywood.

-Realistic themes, relatable characters

-Ignored the Hays code, teased an audience

–Bonnie and Clyde appealed most to the ‘Baby Boomers’ – generation of people born after the war – no interest in war films. Highly dramatised Casablanca (Michael Curtiz, 1942) didn’t appeal to them – wanted more realism, like in France

Political

-The bloody images of death throughout the film relate to the blood and violence of the Vietnam war

Aesthetics and technological

-Merge of French New Wave and Classic Hollywood (in the final scene especially)

-Bluegrass music to show an audience the time the film was made in

-Close-ups, shots that restricted environmental context (such as the opening scene)

-Phallic imagery

-‘Reverse Romeo and Juliette’ – Bonnie’s affection for Clyde’s gun in the absence of his sexual competency

Similarities

Institutional

+Huge film stars to promote film

+Studio auteurship – not one person responsible entirely

+Reminders of ongoing conflicts to create sympathy

+Reminder of economic/political state (WWII and The Great Depression); both reflect the time in which they were made (socially, economically, politically)

+Romance theme, however, Casablanca ends happily, and Bonnie and Clyde does not

+Continuity editing to omit large, un-important sections of the film

Final scene comparison

-The final scene in Casablanca uses dramatised lighting, close-ups, fog to emphasised film noir influence, Rick lit same as Ilsa to represent his change

-The final scene in Bonnie and Clyde differs from the rest of the film; it uses rapid editing during the shooting, overlapping editing, slow motion during the death, loud sounds contrasted with silence after the shooting

Final essay: Compare how far your chosen films reflect their different production contexts

Casablanca (Michael Curtiz, 1942) was made by Warner Bros. during The Second World War, and at the height of the Hollywood studio system. It was set in the days leading up to American intervention, so its central themes are based around the war, promoting intervention and patriotism. On the other hand, Bonnie and Clyde (Arthur Penn, 1967) was made (also by Warner Bros.) after the collapse of the studio system. The American economy had almost recovered from the economic crash in 1929, and WWII was nearly two decades ago. For this reason, audiences weren’t interested in war films, and wanted a change.

Casablanca takes inspiration German expressionism and film noir. These two styles are in black-and-white, but German expressionism uses highly dramatised lighting, melodramatic acting and uses careful choreographing; film noir uses high and low key lighting, and shadows, overall giving a pessimistic, or menacing effect. Despite taking some influence from the German style, foreign influence in film at the time was limited, due to the vertical integration of studios, and the oligopolisation of the film industry. Studios owned theatres, meaning foreign and independent films could not be shown, so the main influence studios had were the films that came before them.

Another feature of the studio system relating to Casablanca is the extravagant set. Rick’s cafe is a lavish building, with a fully furnished interior, bright lighting, and a structure accommodating equipment. The sets are large, highly detailed and expensive, so Warner Bros. makes sure an audience sees every part of the sets to show-off their large budget. This differs from Bonnie and Clyde, as the sets were natural, and all shooting was done on-location.

However, the studio system came with challenges in the form of the highly restrictive Hays Code. The Hays Code forbid filmmakers from showing any sort of explicit content, be it graphic violence, profane language or nudity – the code is something filmmakers resented, as it gave them little room to express serious themes. When the usual suspect from the beginning and Major Strasser are shot, there is no blood, or any type of injury detail. An audience are told both are shot dead through the juxtaposition between the gun shot, and them falling to the ground. The hatred for the code built up over the next two decades, until it faded out entirely: it could be said that Bonnie and Clyde helped greatly in the removal of the code, for the film’s depictions of violence and sexual imagery, normalising this type of content.

Jack Warner had a lot of influence over the film’s messages and themes – he had a strong preference for patriotic themes and characters that promoted American intervention. It could be said that Casablanca is a piece of propaganda, and that Jack Warner had an ulterior motive for creating the film in such a way. Many of Warner’s films during war time were similar in style, often pairing his patriotic themes with movie stars an audience wanted to relate to (such as Humphrey Bogart as Rick). His political agenda extends to the release date of the film: it was first released in New York to align with ‘Operation Torch’ (the invasion of Morocco by allies in an attempt to liberate it from Vichy French), and globally released to correspond with ‘The Casablanca Conference’, to have maximum impact on an audience. Casablanca is a politically based and highly manipulative film. An audience is shown the panic in Paris in the days before occupation, and shown news reels of refugees to remind an audience that American allies are suffering while America watches; this makes an audience guilty, as they are reminded of what is going on in the world. The patriotic messages are an example of how Casablanca is a product of Warner Bros.. This is different from Bonnie and Clyde. In Bonnie and Clyde, the intentions were to break away from Old Hollywood, and introduce a new style, rather than raise questions about politics, and manipulate an audience as part of a political agenda.

Key Elements of Film Form are influenced entirely by what was typical at the time. Continuity editing is used throughout the film (even in the unconventional flashback), reaction shots are used to ensure an audience’s understanding, and many wide-shots and long-shots are used to give context to a scene. Furthermore, the editing is typical for the era (moderately paced), and shots do not restrict environmental context. These were the typical conventions for films in The Golden Age of Hollywood, meaning many films through the era were stylistically similar.

With the break-down of vertical integration after the Paramount Antitrust Case, foreign films could be viewed in America. Previously, the only influences studios had, were other studios, so a unique, new style was well-received. Director Arthur Penn, editor Dede Allen and screenwriters David Newman and Robert Benton admired the French New Wave style, implementing many features of the style into Bonnie and Clyde.

Bonnie and Clyde was heavily influenced by The French New Wave – this was an emerging style that was most popular in the younger generations. At the time, films being made were very stylistically and thematically similar, many being centred around war, had a ‘happily ever after’ for the protagonists, and were not relatable, or remotely realistic. These types of film decreasing in popularity, and experimental films rising in popularity, marked the complete collapse of The Golden Age of Hollywood and the studio system.

Similar to Casablanca, there were references to the political and social state of America at the time each film was set. However, the issue addressed in Bonnie and Clyde was The Great Depression – a crisis that had long since passed, and something that ordinary Americans had no control over. The Great Depression was something viewers understood, and many had lived through, which made the film relatable. Films from The French New Wave were based in reality, and explored small-scaled, contemporary, niche ideas that were more relatable – so more entertaining – for an audience. Casablanca was highly expressionistic, and not relatable to an audience – its purpose was to persuade viewers that intervention was the moral thing to do.

In contrast to Casablanca, Bonnie and Clyde was shot on-location in a southern state that had never recovered from The Great Depression. Although the set was large and accurately reflected a town from the 1930s, it was natural and untouched, so couldn’t possibly match the spectacle of the sets in Casablanca.

Something that particularly stands out in Bonnie and Clyde is the violence and sexual suggestion: previously, the aforementioned Hays Code had forbid graphic violence and sexual implications. In Casablanca the effects of the Hays Code are clear – there is no injury detail during either two murders, and very little romance, despite the underlying romance theme. At the time Bonnie and Clyde was made, the Hays Code was still in place, but had very little influence, and was ultimately ignored. Bonnie and Clyde pushed the boundaries of the already weak code, giving an audience something they hadn’t seen before, making the film even more of a novelty. The violence in the film takes inspiration from the televised atrocities of the Vietnam War – an audience had become used to such depictions of violence. The violence in the film highlighted the fact that reality can be brutal, and it shouldn’t be censored or hidden as it had been in Casablanca – a film set in one of the most horrible and violent times in history. Furthermore, the sexual suggestion and phallic imagery seen in the opening sequence pushed the boundaries of the Hays Code, but also eluded to the prohibition of alcohol. Even though the Hays Code was weak, and had little effect of the film, the prohibition of alcohol is reflected in the film when the pair drink a bottle of coke. References to the prohibition have been made throughout film history (such as The Scarecrow (Buster Keaton, 1920), showing that there still rules and regulations that everyone has to adhere to.

As well as new cinematic, thematic and stylistic techniques, The French New Wave introduced new technologies. Cameras were lightweight and portable (so the need for large, accommodating sets was obsolete), and had faster film stock, allowing films to be shot with limited or natural light. These new advances in technology were adopted by the filmmakers for Bonnie and Clyde. There is frequent use of multiple cameras to give a range of angles and shots, scenes are naturally lit, adding to the realism, and the film is shot in colour – this is a key difference between Casablanca and Bonnie and Clyde, denoting to the time in which both were produced.

Despite the large number of differences between Casablanca and Bonnie and Clyde, there are a small number of similarities. Firstly, both Casablanca and Bonnie and Clyde use big movie stars to promote their film – Casablanca uses Humphrey Bogart to promote patriotism and self-sacrifice; Bonnie and Clyde uses Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway to represent rebelliousness, and mistrust of authority. Casablanca uses Bogart to promote immediate American intervention in the war – to get a message across to an audience – and Bonnie and Clyde use their stars simply to generate more excitement for the film. The reasoning for using big film stars differs, but is equally as effective.

Perhaps the biggest similarity is studio auteurship – both films are the product of a studio auteurship, meaning one person isn’t entirely responsible for the film. Casablanca is the product of multiple staff members, such as Michael Curtiz, Jack Warner, Arthur Edeson and Max Steiner, who all contributed to the style, look and sound of the film. Bonnie and Clyde was influenced by Arthur Penn, Warren Beatty, David Newman, Robert Benton and François Truffaut (who was asked to ready an early version of the script), collectively contributing to the film style. This collective, studio auteurship is common among films from The Golden Age of Hollywood, through to the middle of the New Hollywood era, before directors had more creative freedom.

The final scene in both films stands out: both use techniques typical for the era of Hollywood they were produced in – the height of The Golden Age of Hollywood, and the collapse of The Golden Age of Hollywood. In the final scene of Casablanca, high-key lighting is used to maximise the emotional impact on the audience. In contrast (courtesy to the French-influenced camera advancements), the lighting in Bonnie and Clyde is natural, as the admiration for dramatic lighting had been lost. Rick is lit similarly to Ilsa, showing the change he has gone through. In the rest of the film, he had been harshly-lit, shadowed, and makeup had been used to sharpen his features. In contrast, Ilsa was softly lit, and shot in shallow focus, blurring the background behind her, giving a halo effect. The tight close-ups and similarity in lighting in the final sequence shows the romance, and the moral shift Rick has gone through. The changes in the final scene juxtapose the rest of the film to draw attention to Rick’s turn to patriotism. This differs greatly from Bonnie and Clyde, as natural lighting, and minimal makeup was used to emphasise the experimental nature of the film, and the change in style.

Bonnie and Clyde’s final scene is perhaps one of the most violent scenes America had seen up until that point, making it very different to the romantic finale in Casablanca. As well as being different from Casablanca, the final scene is also very distant from the rest of Bonnie and Clyde. Throughout the film, the French influence was obvious – restrictive close-ups, consistent pacing, long shots, wide shots and long takes to give a ‘fly on the wall’ effect – but the French influence is absent in the final scene. Building up to and during the shootout, the editing is rapid, and the shots are two-shots and close-ups of Bonnie and Clyde. The use of overlapping editing draws the scene out for longer, to maximise the emotional impact on an audience; additionally, to extend the scene, multiple cameras were running simultaneously, at different frame rates, angles and distances to give variation to the final cut. After both Bonnie and Clyde have fallen, the editing slows, and the frame rate drops to maximise the emotional impact. These techniques are a new, experimental idea, never seen before. The pacing and frame rate in Casablanca was consistent throughout, and editing pace was not experimented with to provoke emotion from an audience.

The final scene for each in indicative of the time in which they were made. The main difference is the presence and absence of the Hase Code that denies any sort of affection in Casablanca, and is powerless to stop the violent shootout in Bonnie and Clyde. The filmmakers for Casablanca ‘follow suit’, and take inspiration from American films before it, giving the film little variation from other films of its time. The filmmakers for Bonnie and Clyde had the creative freedom to have a heavily French-influenced film, but also an experimental final scene that did not conform to any style or film conventions.

Although just 25 years apart, both films are polar opposites. Casablanca is the traditional, patriotic, romance-war film, and Bonnie and Clyde is the first-of-its-kind, French, experimental film that pushed the boundaries of the Hays Code, and popularised the French style. Their differences massively outweigh their similarities, showing how much film had changed after the Paramount Anti Trust Case, and in response to the changing industry.

Version 2: Compare how far your chosen films reflect their different production contexts

Casablanca takes inspiration German expressionism and film noir. These two styles are in black-and-white, but German expressionism uses highly dramatised lighting, melodramatic acting and uses careful choreographing; film noir uses high and low key lighting, and shadows, overall giving a pessimistic, or menacing effect. Despite taking some influence from the German style, foreign influence in film at the time was limited, due to the vertical integration of studios, and the oligopolisation of the film industry. Studios owned theatres, meaning foreign and independent films could not be shown, so the main influence studios had were the films that came before them.

Another feature of the studio system relating to Casablanca is the extravagant set. Rick’s cafe is a lavish building, with a fully furnished interior, bright lighting, and a structure accommodating equipment. The sets are large, highly detailed and expensive, so Warner Bros. makes sure an audience sees every part of the sets to show-off their large budget. This differs from Bonnie and Clyde, as the sets were natural, and all shooting was done on-location. After the collapse of the studio system, foreign film could influence filmmakers – the main influence was the French New Wave. The classic French style was characterised by realist themes, improvised choreography, natural make-up and lighting, and unconventional lead characters – the complete opposite to Casablanca.

The studio system and vertical integration made it impossible for independent filmmakers to make a name for themselves. In turn, the 8 main studios monopolised the industry, profiting millions to the detriment of those independent filmmakers. However, the studio system came with challenges in the form of the highly restrictive Hays Code. The Hays Code forbid filmmakers from showing any sort of explicit content, be it graphic violence, profane language or nudity – the code is something filmmakers resented, as it gave them little room to express serious themes, or be realistic. When the usual suspect from the beginning, and Major Strasser are shot, there is no blood, or any type of injury detail, showing the impact the code had. The hatred for the code built up over the next two decades, until it faded out entirely: it could be said that Bonnie and Clyde helped greatly in the removal of the code, for the film’s depictions of violence and sexual imagery, normalising this type of content. Audiences loved this type of film with sexual innuendos, and graphic violence, so the Hays Codes was ultimately ignored.

Jack Warner had a lot of influence over the film’s messages and themes – he had a strong preference for patriotic themes and characters that promoted American intervention. It could be said that Casablanca is a piece of propaganda, and that Jack Warner had an ulterior motive for creating the film in such a way. Many of Warner’s films during war time were similar in style, often pairing his patriotic themes with movie stars an audience wanted to relate to (such as Humphrey Bogart). Similarly, Bonnie and Clyde uses big stars to promote the film, although the stars were used to promote the idea of a new studio system with less restrictions, and realist themes. When Rick reminisces about the past, an audience is shown the panic in Paris in the days before occupation, and are shown news reels of refugees to remind an audience that American allies are suffering while America watches; this makes an audience guilty, as they are reminded of what is going on in the world. The patriotic messages and manipulation are examples of how Casablanca is a product of Warner Bros.. This is different from Bonnie and Clyde, as the intentions were to break away from Old Hollywood, and introduce a new style, rather than raise questions about politics and manipulate an audience as part of a political agenda.

With the break-down of vertical integration after the Paramount Antitrust Case, foreign films could be viewed in America. The filmmakers of Bonnie and Clyde admired the French New Wave style, implementing many features of the style into the film.

Bonnie and Clyde was heavily influenced by The French New Wave – it was an emerging style that was popular in the younger generations. At the time, films being made were very stylistically and thematically similar and were not relatable, or remotely realistic. These types of film decreasing in popularity, and experimental films rising in popularity, marked the complete collapse of The Golden Age of Hollywood, and the studio system.

Similar to Casablanca, there were references to the political and social state of America at the time each film was set. However, the issue addressed in Bonnie and Clyde was The Great Depression – a crisis that had long since passed, and something that ordinary Americans could relate to. Films from The French New Wave were based in reality, and explored contemporary, niche ideas that were more relatable for an audience. Casablanca was highly expressionistic, and not relatable to an audience – its purpose was to persuade viewers that intervention was the moral thing to do. This reflects the different contexts in which both films were made.

Something that particularly stands out in Bonnie and Clyde is the violence and sexual suggestion: previously, the aforementioned Hays Code had forbid graphic violence and sexual implications. In Casablanca, the effects of the Hays Code are clear – there is no injury detail during either two murders, and very little romance, despite the underlying romance theme. At the time Bonnie and Clyde was made, the Hays Code was ultimately ignored. Bonnie and Clyde pushed the boundaries of the already weak code, giving an audience something they hadn’t seen before, making the film even more of a novelty. The violence in the film takes inspiration from the televised atrocities of the Vietnam War. The violence highlighted the fact that reality can be brutal, and it shouldn’t be censored or hidden as it had been in Casablanca.

As well as new cinematic, thematic and stylistic techniques, The French New Wave introduced new technologies. Cameras were lightweight and portable (so the need for large, accommodating sets was obsolete), and had faster film stock, allowing films to be shot with limited or natural light. These new advances in technology were adopted by the filmmakers for Bonnie and Clyde. There is frequent use of multiple cameras to give a range of angles and shots; scenes are naturally lit, adding to the realism; and the film is shot in colour – this is a key difference between Casablanca and Bonnie and Clyde, denoting to the time in which both were produced.

Despite the large number of differences between Casablanca and Bonnie and Clyde, there are a small number of similarities. Firstly, both Casablanca and Bonnie and Clyde use big movie stars to promote their film – Casablanca uses Humphrey Bogart to promote patriotism and self-sacrifice; Bonnie and Clyde uses Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway to represent rebelliousness, mistrust of authority, and to popularise the New Age of Hollywood style. Casablanca uses Bogart to promote immediate American intervention in the war – to get a message across to an audience – and Bonnie and Clyde use their stars simply to generate more excitement for the film. The reasoning for using big film stars differs, but is equally as effective.

Perhaps the biggest similarity is studio auteurship – both films are the product of a studio auteurship, meaning one person isn’t entirely responsible for the film. Casablanca is the product of multiple people, such as Michael Curtiz, Jack Warner, Arthur Edeson and Max Steiner, who all contributed to the style, look and sound of the film. Bonnie and Clyde was influenced by Arthur Penn, Warren Beatty, David Newman, Robert Benton, Dede Allen and François Truffaut (who was asked to read an early version of the script), collectively contributing to the style. This collective, studio auteurship is common among films from The Golden Age of Hollywood, through to the middle of the New Hollywood era, before directors had more creative freedom. Different creative staff worked together, combining their skills, and drawing from other films for inspiration. Casablanca was inspired by previous American, film noir movies, and Bonnie and Clyde was inspired by the French New Wave.

The final scene in both films stands out: both use techniques typical for the era of Hollywood they were produced in – the height of The Golden Age of Hollywood, and the collapse of The Golden Age of Hollywood. In the final scene of Casablanca, high-key lighting is used to maximise the emotional impact on the audience. Rick is lit similarly to Ilsa, showing the change he has gone through. In the rest of the film, he had been harshly-lit, shadowed, and makeup had been used to sharpen his features. In contrast, Ilsa was softly lit, and shot in shallow focus. In contrast (courtesy to the French-influenced camera advancements), the lighting in Bonnie and Clyde is natural, as the admiration for dramatic lighting had been lost. Bonnie wears minimalist make-up, and isn’t lit or positioned in a flattering way.

Bonnie and Clyde’s final scene is perhaps one of the most violent scenes America had seen up until that point, making it very different to the romantic finale in Casablanca. As well as being different from Casablanca, the final scene is also very distant from the rest of Bonnie and Clyde. Throughout the film, the French influence was obvious – restrictive close-ups, consistent pacing, long shots, wide shots and long takes to give a ‘fly on the wall’ effect – but the French influence is absent in the final scene. Building up to and during the shootout, the editing is rapid, and the shots are two-shots and close-ups of Bonnie and Clyde. The use of overlapping editing draws the scene out for longer, to maximise the emotional impact on an audience; additionally, to extend the scene, multiple cameras were running simultaneously, at different frame rates, angles and distances to give variation to the final cut. After both Bonnie and Clyde have fallen, the editing slows, and the frame rate drops. The pacing and frame rate in Casablanca was consistent throughout, and editing pace was not experimented with to provoke emotion from an audience. Bonnie and Clyde used this rapid editing style with a variety of camera shots to give variation, but also to manipulate an audience into feeling sorry for Bonnie and Clyde. This is different to Casablanca for that reason.

The final scene for each in indicative of the time in which they were made. The main difference is the presence and absence of the Hays Code that denies any sort of affection in Casablanca, and is powerless to stop the violent shootout in Bonnie and Clyde. The filmmakers for Casablanca ‘follow suit’, and take inspiration from American films before it, giving the film little variation from other films of its time. The filmmakers for Bonnie and Clyde had the creative freedom to have a heavily French-influenced film, but also an experimental final scene that did not conform to any style or film conventions.

Casablanca is the traditional, patriotic, romance-war film, and Bonnie and Clyde is the first-of-its-kind, French, experimental film that pushed the boundaries of the Hays Code, and popularised the French style. Their differences massively outweigh their similarities, showing how much film had changed after the Paramount Anti Trust Case, and in response to the changing industry.

What is the film about? Who are the main characters and what happens to them?

Ice Cold in Alex is based on a true story, set during the North African campaign of World War II. Captain Anson, is a British Army officer commanding a Motor Ambulance Company in the port of Tobruk, Libya. He is presented as an experienced and war-weary soldier, who manages the stress and horror of war with alcohol. When it becomes clear that Tobruk is about to fall to the German Afrika Korps, Anson is ordered to leave for Alexandria in neighbouring Egypt: an ambulance unit would be invaluable to the Germans. During the evacuation, Anson, Sergeant Tom Pugh (a mechanic) and two nurses (Sisters Diana Murdoch and Denise Norton), become separated from the others, when the bridge out of Tobruk is blown up. Anson makes the decision to drive across the desert to Alexandria – or ‘Alex’ – in their ambulance, Katy, rather than risk returning to Tobruk with their female passengers.

Upon stopping to refuel, they meet a soldier, who identifies himself as a South African officer, Captain van der Poel. As the Afrikaans (South Africans predominantly descended from Dutch settlers) are fighting with the Allies in North Africa, he asks for a ride to Alexandria, having also become separated from his own unit. The team seems reluctant to take him in, reasoning they have limited supplies, but when van der Poel shows Anson he carries two bottles of gin, Anson decides to allow him to join them.

Their first obstacle is a minefield – the British hid mines in the sand to prevent German invasion – so Anson and van der Poel walk parallel to each other, securing a safe path for Katy and her passengers creeping along behind. This scene is near silent, and uses many close up shots of the mens’ faces, sweating in the searing heat and intense pressure of their task. This builds the tension perfectly to the inevitable: van der Poel stepping on something potentially lethal. Van der Poel and the audience hold their breath, motionless, until Anson digs up an empty can and tosses it aside. He is of course rewarded for his efforts with gin, much to the concern of Sgt. Pugh.

The group encounter the advancing German Afrika Korps twice on their journey: on the first occasion, they fire at the ambulance when an alcohol-fuelled Anson refuses to stop, instead recklessly trying to out-run them. Sister Denise is fatally wounded in the stomach as a result, and eventually, Anson is surrounded and forced to stop. Van der Poel offers to help, claiming to have learned German while working in South West Africa; he is able to talk the Germans into allowing them to go on their way, reasoning that they now have a ‘wounded’ nurse. When Anson takes responsibility for her death, he vows not to have another ‘drink’ until they safely reach Alexandria. Alcohol is again referred to as an important feature of the journey, and it is revealed to the audience that it even gives the film its title: Anson vividly describes the ice cold beer he will buy them all once they make it out of the dessert and reach Alexandria – or ‘Alex’. However, he promises not to have another drop of alcohol until then.

It becomes clear that the ambulance was damaged in the attempted escape from the Germans, and a spring needs to be changed before they can continue. Without the proper equipment, Katy’s axel is perilously balanced on rocks while Pugh races to crank up the jack that has slipped out of place. Knowing that it would mean catastrophe if the ambulance were to crash down onto the unsupported axel, van der Poel takes the weight of the vehicle on his back, thereby rescuing them all from certain death in the desert.

The ambulance encounters the Afrika Korps a second time after burying Sister Denise, and Anson is sure that the Germans will not let them go for a second time. Miraculously, van der Poel manages to convince them to let the group continue; showing them the contents of his backpack seems to secure their release. This causes the group to be wary of van der Poel, and his backpack becomes the focus of their suspicion; Pugh is already wary of van der Poel’s inability to brew tea using the South African Army technique, so decides to follow him when he heads off into the desert with his pack and a spade. Pugh is not sure of what he sees, but is sure he sees an antenna, leading them to believe he is a spy radioing information to the Germans.

Having met soldiers disguised as locals at a British fuelling outpost (who say they will add sugar to the fuel before the Germans arrive, destroying their engines), the group decide to act on their suspicions – before van der Poel has the chance to report this information to the enemy. Wanting to be sure, they need to catch him red-handed, so set a trap when he goes off again with his pack later that night. Following him into the treacherous quicksand, they wait until he opens his pack, and then shine Katy’s lights at his position. This causes him to panic, and he falls into the quicksand along with his backpack – but not before the team see it contains a radio set. After an incredibly tense scene with failure after failure to rescue van der Poel, they finally succeed and haul him to safety. While he recovers, they come to the conclusion that he is not who he says he is, and must be a German spy; however, they remain unsure of what to do about it, as they are all aware that they would not have made it as far as they had without van der Poel’s efforts. They decide not to question him, and simply tell him that his pack was lost.

The final obstacle on their journey is a sand dune that stands as a seemingly insurmountable barrier between them and Alexandria. The only way to safety now is to hand-crank Katy up the sand-dune. They again rely on van der Poel’s strength, as each man takes it in turn to inch the vehicle up the sand dune. A set-back occurs when Diana decides to have a go at turning the crank during a rest break, and Katy rolls, unstoppable, back down the hill. All – including the audience – are dispirited – but it doesn’t last for long: the blame is shared, and Diana is given a less demanding but ‘important’ role inside the ambulance. Katy creeps slowly back up the hill, until they finally make it to the top.

As promised, Anson takes them all to the bar for their ice cold beer. In the iconic scene, they all sit at the pristine, marble-topped bar and stare as frosty beers are poured and served to each one in turn. All wait for Anson to start – and finish – before they touch theirs. While drinking their second round, they finally confront van der Poel. He attempts to flee, but realises this is futile. Anson tells him that when they arrived in Alexandria, he delivered their papers – except van der Poel’s faked documents – to the Military Police checkpoint, and reported him as a German officer who had got lost in the desert, and subsequently surrendered to them. Anson asks for his real name; the German seems unsure, but Anson tells him that they don’t want to see him shot for being a spy – particularly as he had saved their lives in the desert on more than one occasion.

As the Military Police arrive outside, ‘Captain van der Poel’ gives up his real identity – Hauptmann (Captain) Otto Lutz. Another iconic scene comes during Lutz’s arrest, when he bows deeply to his desert companions, and Pugh notices that he is still wearing his fake dog tags, which would give him up as a spy and result in death by firing squad. He quickly rips them off before the police see them. The film ends with Lutz being driven away, surprised yet thankful for the mercy he has been shown, and with a revised view of his British ‘enemies’.

Who made the film? Does the film hold a significant place in film history?

The film was one of the twelve most popular movies at the British box office in 1958, as were many other war movies. It won the ‘FIPRESCI Award’ at the Berlin International Film Festival. It stood out against many of the post-war films of the same genre, in that it didn’t portray the accepted, clearly defined, ‘hero and villain’ roles of the time: Anson was a deeply flawed character, and van der Poel was not the typical ‘evil Nazi’. It therefore challenged these stereotypes, and to do so at a time when the war was still very fresh in the audience’s memory carried potential risks at the box office.

The final scene in which Anson gets his much needed glass of lager was famously used in a successful 1988 advertising campaign for Carlsberg (the larger actually used in the bar scene). John Mills (Anson) revealed that real lager had been used, because non-alcoholic substitutes wouldn’t foam; he had to drink multiple glasses one after the other until the director was happy with the take.

How is the story told? Do the filmmakers use any interesting techniques to convey information to the audience? How is the narrative structured?

The film is told chronologically, starting from the evacuation of Tobruk, to the bar in Alexandria. There is a short narration at the beginning of the film to set the scene. It was shot in black and white, and used an aspect ratio of 1.66:1 (also called European Widescreen). The film has a slight grainy look, which is common for films shot in black and white at that time. There is also very little non-diegetic sound, so there are frequent scenes of pure silence, which adds to the suspense. Silence is used particularly well when Anson is digging the sand around van der Poel’s foot, when he believes he has stepped on a mine.

What was your personal reaction to the film? Which sequences were particularly effective or enjoyable? What do you think the filmmakers wanted to say?

I enjoyed this film very much – I have watched it three times before, and enjoyed it just as much each time. The film was tense and entertaining all the way through (despite being over 2 hours long). The film was based on true events, so I believe the filmmakers wanted to tell this unbelievable story in as much detail as possible. Additionally, the film was shot on location in Libya, which was unusual for the time, and makes it even more extraordinary and immersive – the desert and its harsh environment becomes a character in its own right. At times, the actors seem genuinely exhausted from the environment, which only adds to the detail and enjoyment – and makes van der Poel’s final speech even more poignant, when he describes the desert as the true enemy that they had battled against together.

The human conflict in small pockets of North Africa – which seemed so significant in the effort to win the war – were nothing in the grand landscape of the desert. It had been there for thousands of years, largely uninhabited, and was able to kill them all if they put a foot wrong: unless they put aside their differences and worked together.

What is your ★★★☆☆ rating?

Usually, I don’t like war films, but I particularly enjoyed Ice Cold in Alex. It’s a great story of adventure, made even more dramatic as it is based on a true story. The four main actors come together to battle the desert – and despite impossible obstacles, with truly suspenseful moments, they succeed. I’d rate it 5 stars.

Write a detailed blog post, in carefully paragraphed prose, identifying notable aspects of Kim Longinotto’s documentary techniques in the “Opening sequence”; 00:00:00 — 00:06:15.

Cinematography

The camera fades from black from inside a car. The camera is hand-held (by Longinotto) because it makes it look more natural and less staged. The camera then shows the poor, rural village. The camera then pans from up high across the town. On ground-level, we are shown an employee parking his bike for work. This all gives the impression that this is the start of a day in a small town. An audience are then shown inside a small office with three employees. The camera follows the movements of each employee when the camera cuts to them individually, showing they are important. The filmmakers have had no interaction with these people, rather, the employees are allowed to show the camera their daily routine. The camera movements are spontaneous and follow the people, sometimes zooming. Longinotto sacrifices aesthetics in order to show exactly what is happening.

After the title is shown, the camera cuts to inside a more private office where the camera is positioned in the corner out the way – Longinotto assumes the role of an observer, out of the way. The atmosphere here is different and seems more professional; the shift in atmosphere from more friendly to serious is achieved by outside sounds lowering in the mix, and an abrupt cut: this draws an audiences’ attention to the woman on screen. The scene begins with a close-up of a woman, this makes her seem innocent, as she appears upset. The camera pulls out to reveal there are two other men in the room – the woman is the focus, this emphasises that she is the victim. The camera cuts to show a child, and this cut was from a different camera. Her father starts to talk, the camera focuses him as he talks so there are no distractions. Longinotto does this a lot – when a person is talking, the camera doesn’t move until they have finished or until someone else talks and pulls the focus. This technique makes what we are seeing like an outsiders’ perspective. As well as this, Longinotto never uses any dramatic or exaggerated camera effects to ensure the film looks like an audiences’ untampered observation. The camera cuts to Ngassa, and the camera is still (somewhat shaking because the camera is hand-held). The camera pulls in to focus the female victim agai
