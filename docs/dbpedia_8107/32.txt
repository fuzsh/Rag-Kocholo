This is a complete list of short subjects and feature films that featured The Three Stooges released between 1930 and 1970.

Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Shemp Howard appeared in a single feature film with Ted Healy released by Fox Film Corporation entitled Soup to Nuts (1930). Shemp departed the act in 1932 to pursue a solo career and was replaced by younger brother Curly Howard. This incarnation of the team appeared in several shorts and feature films with Healy at MGM in 1933 and 1934. Curly appeared in one MGM short Roast Beef and Movies (1934) without Healy, Moe, or Larry.

Moe, Larry and Curly left Healy in 1934 and moved to Columbia Pictures to begin their successful series of 190 shorts, with their contract extended each year until the final one expired on December 31, 1957. The final 8 of the 16 shorts with Joe Besser were released afterwards over the next 1⅓ years. It is these 190 short films, which have appeared on television in steady rotation since 1958, that the Stooges are best known for. These films appear on this list in numbered format. The Stooges would continue afterwards with Moe, Larry and Joe DeRita (as "Curly-Joe"), and make several full-length feature films between 1959 and 1970.
