Plot[]

The Stooges are hobos who get thrown off a freight train and end up being chased out of the railroad yard. They hide in the "Hangover Athletic Club" when all of the sudden Curly gets hired as a sparring partner. Ivan Bustoff, world wrestling champion, takes a liking to the Stooges, and his manager hires the three to make sure they check up on Bustoff so that he doesn't drink. When Ivan gets plastered, Moe sends out Curly disguised as Bustoff. Curly finally wins the match, when he goes berserk from smelling "Wild Hyacinth" perfume.

Notes[]

This episode makes the first appearance of Cy Schindell with the Three Stooges. He had appeared in most Three Stooges episodes and appeared in some Three Stooges episode recycled footage from the previous ones after his death in 1948.

The title Grips, Grunts and Groans is a parody expression of "gripes, grunts and groans."

This is one of the few films where Curly goes berserk caused by an external stimulus, the others being Punch Drunks, Horses' Collars, and Tassels in the Air.
