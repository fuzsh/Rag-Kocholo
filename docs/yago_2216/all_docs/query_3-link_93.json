        "text": "January 14, 1972: Queen Margrethe II takes the throne. She was the first queen of Denmark since 1412 and the first Danish monarch not named Frederick or Christian since 1513. Her full name is Margrethe Alexandrine Þórhildur Ingrid. She was born April 16, 1940 as the eldest child of then Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Ingrid of Denmark. She was born at the Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen. Her father was the eldest son of King Christian X and Queen Alexandrine. Her mother was the only daughter of Gustav Adolf and Margaret, crown royalty of Sweden. Margrethe was born just one week after Hitler invaded Denmark.\n\nIn 1944, as second daughter was born to the royal couple and two years later the third sister came into the world. On April 20, 1947, King Christian died and Margrethe’s father became King Frederik IX. When Margrethe was born, only males could ascend to the throne because of laws passed in the 1850s. Since Margrethe had no brothers, it was assumed that her uncle would one day take the throne. The process to change the constitution began in 1947 soon after her father took the crown. He and his daughters were popular with the people and it was clear to all that Ingrid would not be having more children. The proposal had to pass two Parliaments in succession and then a referendum had to be held. This was done in 1953. The new Act of Succession allowed females to take the crown.\n\nOn her eighteenth birthday, Margrethe was given a seat in the Council of State and she chaired meetings when her father was absent. On June 10, 1967 she married Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, a French diplomat. Upon his marriage, Henri was titled His Royal Highness Prince Henrik of Denmark. The couple had two sons, Frederik and Joachim born in 1968 and 1969 respectively. At the turn of the year from 1971 to 1972, King Frederik IX gave his New Year’s Address to the Nation and then fell ill. He died on this day and his daughter became Queen of Denmark with her husband being Prince Consort.\n\nOn January 14, 2012, Queen Margrethe celebrated her Ruby Jubilee having sat on the throne for 40 years. She continues to reign with her elder son holding the title of heir presumptive. Frederik married in 2004 and had four children, two sons and two daughters. Joachim married in 1995 and with his first wife he had two sons. He was divorced in 2005 and remarried in 2008. He has a son and daughter with his second wife. The line of succession seems safe for the time being.\n\nI can, of course, think what I want, just like everyone else. I simply have to refrain from saying everything I think.\n\nThe time that I devote to painting is not a lot of time, but I do it 100 percent while I am working, and then there’s nothing else that counts.\n\nOne shouldn’t write one’s own epitaph. I hope people will remember me as one who did her best – and who wasn’t an anachronism.\n\nI will remain on the throne until I fall off. – all from Queen Margrethe II of Denmark"
