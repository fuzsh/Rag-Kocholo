        "text": "On 16 April, Queen Margrethe-one of the most respected Sovereign’s in European history-reaches the milestone age of eighty.\n\nMargrethe Alexandrine Þórhildur Ingrid was the eldest child of Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark and his Swedish-born wife Crown Princess Ingrid. She was born at the Amelienborg Palace in Copenhagen at a particularly dark time in the country’s history as only a week previously German troops had invaded and occupied its Northern neighbour. Although the Queen’s memories of this period are sketchy, she is able to recall how her paternal grandfather, King Christian X, would ride through the streets of Copenhagen each Sunday, cheered on by his people, as a symbol of defiance.\n\nAt the time of her birth, Margrethe was not in the line of succession as only males could ascend the throne of Denmark. When her father succeeded to the throne as Frederick IX on 20 April 1947, it was the King’s brother, Knud, who became heir presumptive, with the title of Hereditary Prince of Denmark. Yet, at this stage in her life, the Princess was more concerned with playing with her younger sisters Benedikte (born in April 1944) and eight-month-old Anne-Marie. The three sisters soon formed a close bond, both amongst themselves and with their adoring parents. In the family, Margrethe was affectionately known as ‘Daisy.’ Although the King was ‘immensely democratic’ and kindly, Queen Ingrid-a lady imbued with extraordinary willpower, judgment, flair and discipline-ensured that her daughters were well-versed in royal etiquette.\n\nNevertheless, matters were about to change. It was by now increasingly clear that the King and Queen might never have a son. This resulted in a political initiative to change the law of succession, a move partly influenced by the efforts of Queen Ingrid as part of her attempts to establish the Danish monarchy as a modern institution. A new Act of Succession, passed in March 1953, permitted female succession to the throne of Denmark, according to male-preference cognatic primogeniture. This allowed for a female to ascend to the throne but only if she did not have a brother(s). The practical manifestations of this new law were that Princess Margrethe became heir presumptive while her sisters were also elevated before Knud and his family in the Danish line of succession.\n\nAs a future queen regnant, it was important that Princess Margrethe should receive a good education. Initially, she had been tutored at home by governesses prior to attending a private school in Copenhagen (Zahles Skole). After graduating in 1959 (by which time she had been given a seat on the State Council) , Margrethe travelled to England to spend a year as a boarder at the renowned girl’s school, North Foreland Lodge.\n\nThereafter, the Princess (who by now was fluent in Danish, English, French, Swedish and German) focused on acquiring a university level of instruction. In 1960, she enrolled for a course in philosophy at Copenhagen University. This was followed, in 1961, by a year at the University of Cambridge (Girton College) studying prehistoric archaeology. The Princess then concentrated on reading political science at Aarhus University and the Sorbonne in Paris, followed by a course in sociology at the London School of Economics in 1965.\n\nIn 1958, Margrethe commenced a period of voluntary service with the Danish Women’s Flying Corps. This marked the beginning of a close involvement with the military lasting throughout her reign both in Denmark (where she is Commander-in-Chief of the defence forces) and the United Kingdom (where she is Colonel-in-Chief of the Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment). By the mid-1960’s, Margrethe was also undertaking official engagements as well as chairing meetings of the State Council in the absence of King Frederik IX.\n\nYet, there was also time for fun. In 1960, Margrethe and her sisters toured the United States, along with some Swedish cousins, during which they paid a visit to Paramount Studios in Los Angeles where they met Elvis Presley and Dean Martin. The Princess learned how to cook, practised jiu-jitsu and developed a keen interest in art. Indeed, from tentative beginnings, Margrethe has gone on to become an accomplished book illustrator (for the Danish edition of Tolkien’s ‘Lord of the Rings’ using the pseudonym Ingahild Grathmer) as well as an adept costume and scenery designer (including for a Danish Royal Ballet production). At home, she collects old magazines from which she cuts out pictures in order to make the most wonderful decoupage tea trays. She is also a skilled painter and embroiderer.\n\nIn 1967, Margrethe married a French diplomat, Count Henri de Laborde de Monpezat at Copenhagen’s Holmen Kirke. The couple had met in England during the Princess’ period at the London School of Economics. At that time Henri was working in the British capital at the French Embassy. He now took the title of His Royal Highness Prince Henrik of Denmark. They were soon blessed by the arrival of two sons: Crown Prince Frederick (born on 26 May 1968). A second child, Joachim, soon followed on 7 June 1969. The duo later purchased the Château de Cayx in France. This proved to be both a wonderful place for the family to spend summer holidays, as well as providing a decent source of income from the property’s vineyards.\n\nMargrethe succeeded her father upon his death on 14 January 1972 thus becoming the first female monarch of Denmark since Margrethe I, who reigned from 1375-1412. In keeping with tradition, she was proclaimed Sovereign from the balcony of Christiansborg Palace, the following day, by Prime Minister Jens Otto Krag. Rather than being overwhelmed by her new role, Queen Margrethe II was determined to live up to her belief that ‘the least one can do is one’s best.’ She was also resolved to her duty in a manner which would honour the memory of her ‘wonderful father.’ The Queen chose as her motto: ‘God’s help, the love of The People, Denmark’s strength’.\n\nA mainstay of this role is that the Sovereign must be impartial and ‘outside politics,’ although she formally appoints a new government led by the leader of the party who has the support of the largest number of seats in the Folketing (the Danish Parliament), but only following upon a period of consultation with the leaders of other political parties. However, although the Queen signs Acts of Parliament, these can only come into force when they have been countersigned by a Cabinet Minister. The Prime Minister and Foreign Minister are received in audience on a regular basis by Her Majesty to keep her informed her of the latest political developments. In addition, Margrethe receives ambassadors from overseas, who present her with their credentials prior to starting work in Denmark.\n\nQueen Margrethe has made it clear that she will never abdicate her throne. She has also tended to follow the view of the mother that the royal family must be accessible to the people. She attends the opening of public buildings, tours exhibitions and holds official receptions at the Amelienborg and at her country home at Fredensborg. Each summer, Margrethe undertakes an extensive tour of her nation aboard the Royal Yacht Dannebrog during which she meets local citizens and visits nearby businesses. The yacht has also proved most useful as a travelling home during Her Majesty’s frequent trips to Greenland and the Faroe Islands.\n\nMargrethe is also the public face of her country on the international stage. One of her first State Visits was to the United Kingdom, in 1974, and an emotional reunion with her kinswoman, Queen Elizabeth II. It is no secret that the Danish Queen regards the senior sovereign with affection and respect. This is hardly surprising given that Margrethe’s maternal grandmother, Princess Margaret of Connaught was British. Furthermore, both sovereigns are great-great granddaughters of the great Queen Empress, Victoria. This tradition of foreign travel has continued throughout Queen Margrethe’s reign and in recent years she has undertaken State or Official visits to places as geographically diverse as Italy, Ghana, Argentina and Indonesia.\n\nDespite her accessibility, Margrethe is wise enough to have realised that the line between a public and private life must be respected. Private times, she states, are necessary so as to be able ‘to recuperate’ and ‘to relax’. However, she is equally dismissive of the view that this distancing is in any way related to preserving the ‘mystique’ of the monarchy.\n\nOn 18 November 1995, Prince Joachim married Alexandra Manley, a Hong-Kong based businesswoman. The couple went on to have two children: Nikolai, born on 28 August 1999 (who was the Queen and Prince Henrik’s first grandchild) and Felix (born on 22 July 2002). Sadly this union ended in divorce in April 2005, although the couple remained on good terms. Alexandra is today known as the Countess of Frederiksborg. Prince Joachim remarried in 2008. His bride Marie Cavallier, was born in Paris, educated in Switzerland and the US and, at one stage, worked for the cosmetics firm Estee Lauder. The duo have two children, Prince Henrik and Princess Athena.\n\nCrown Prince Frederick took longer to settle down but his marriage, in May 2014, to Mary Donaldson, an Australian of Scotch descent from Tasmania, has proved to be very successful. The couple have four children: Fourteen-year-old Christian (who is second-in-line to the Danish throne), Isabella, Vincent and Josephine. The Queen is on excellent terms with both of her daughters-in-law and has described her relationship with Crown Princess Mary as ‘very good’ and ‘warm’.\n\nHowever, despite these many additions to the family, Queen Margrethe has suffered her fair share of losses. In November 2000, Queen Ingrid (who had grown increasingly frail following a fall) died at Fredensborg Palace at the grand old age of ninety. All of her daughters were at her bedside. Each summer, Margrethe keeps her late mother’s memory very much to the fore by spending time at Ingrid’s former summer home, Gråsten Palace in Jutland.\n\nSadly, in September 2017 it was announced that Henrik-the Prince Consort-was living with dementia. It was later revealed that he had a benign tumour on his lung. He died at Fredensborg on 13 February 2018 aged 83. Following her husband’s funeral on 20 February, Queen Margrethe released a statement saying how deeply moved she and her family had felt ‘to witness the warmth and sympathy that swept towards us from all parts of Danish society.’ Yet, the Queen was devastated and so she briefly handed over the reins of power to her son Frederick, who acted as Regent whilst she took a two-week holiday in Norway.\n\nHowever, as she celebrates her 80th birthday, Margrethe has recently courted controversy by stating in an interview with the Politiken newspaper that ‘ people play a role in climate change, of that there is no doubt. But whether the change is directly man-made, I am not entirely convinced.’ She also feels we should not ‘panic.’ One Danish activist, Signe Munk, called the Queen’s statement ‘extremely unpleasant’. However others, including the Danish People’s Party climate spokesman, Morten Messerschmidt, welcomed the fact that Denmark has a monarch with an opinion of her own.\n\nWhile major celebrations planned for the Queen’s 80th birthday have been cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak, Danes still intend to celebrate the day with singing from balconies and windows. A new set of photographs by the photographer Per Morten Abrahamsen and released by the Danish Royal Court over the last few days, have also helped to lighten the mood as has the surprise serenading of the Queen (who stood in her nightgown on a balcony of Fredensborg’s Kuppelsalen) by members of her staff on the morning of her birthday. God Save the Queen! Many Happy Returns!"
