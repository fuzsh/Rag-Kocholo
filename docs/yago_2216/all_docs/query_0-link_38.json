        "text": "Hi Josefine!\n\nI have exactly 2 photos of Princess Ingrid on her wedding day. If you notice she is wearing her diamond and platinum daisy brooch. What is wonderful is that Princess Margrethe wore the same brooch on her wedding day, too!\n\nPics 3&4: www.corbis.com (Originally posted by Alexandra)\n\nhttp://img300.imageshack.us/img300/8562/princessingrid7tt.jpg\n\nhttp://img300.imageshack.us/img300/7595/princessingridwedding7zx.jpg\n\nhttp://img300.imageshack.us/img300/8890/ingrid9xe.jpg\n\nhttp://img300.imageshack.us/img300/9496/ingrid27jz.jpg\n\n1. Prince Frederik and Princess Ingrid at the altar\n\n2. The couple seated in the carriage\n\n3-4. The couple waving to the crowd on the way to the palace\n\n5. The couple gets off at the palace\n\nwww.britishpathe.com\n\nhttp://img339.imageshack.us/img339/4321/82721409kk.jpg\n\nhttp://img339.imageshack.us/img339/5196/82721954lk.jpg\n\nhttp://img339.imageshack.us/img339/2116/827211107ly.jpg\n\nhttp://img339.imageshack.us/img339/2298/827211554ub.jpg\n\nhttp://img339.imageshack.us/img339/4545/827211755nr.jpg\n\nThis thread has been completely converted to an ImageShack account now so that no images have been directly attached to the forum in an effort to conserve bandwidth.\n\nIt would be greatly appreciated if any newly-discovered images from this point forward would be hosted via a private image hosting account such as Photobucket or Imageshack.\n\nPlease also review the images already posted and not re-post the exact same images over and over.\n\nPlease note that images which are attached directly to the forum are subject to removal by an Administrator or SuperModerator without notice to the member.\n\nThank you for your co-operation on this matter so that we can all continue to enjoy images of our favourite royals.\n\nThe TRF Team\n\nI am impressed to see Queen Astrid sitting next to the King of Sweden, her parents as royal minors were standing behind. I recognised Queens Sylvia, Sonja Margarethe and Paola 's tiaras easely altough the swedish and the dane sashes.\n\nThanks a lot Steven.\n\nHave you by the way pictures of the guests on the wedding day?\n\nFirst row sitting ;\n\nCecilia Crown Princess of Preusen (Queen Alexandrine's sister), King Christian X of Danemark, Queen Astrid of the Belgians, King Gustav V of Sweden, Ingrid and Frederik, Queen Alexandrine of Danemark, King Leopold III of the Belgians, Queen Maud and King Haakon of Norway,\n\nSitting before Astrid, Carl her younger brother , and on the other side Bertil and a Prince of Sweden.\n\nThe sashes of Serafin's order of Sweden are on the other side than the sashes of the Olifant's order of Danemark; easy to recognise Kings and Princes , for Queens and Princesses we see the now worn tiaras....\n\nSecond row standing ;\n\nPrince George of Greece, Prince and Princess Viggo of Danemark, (Princess? sash), Princess Thyra of Danemark, Princess Ingeborg of Sweden, (Princess ?sash) ,Princess Sybilla of Sweden,( princess x) ,(princess xx), Princess Louise of Sweden, Crown Prince Gustav Adolphe of Sweden(father of Ingrid) and his sons Princes of Sweden..\n\nWhat is the little bush Swedish Royal brides seem to have on their heads? Queen Astrid of Belgium (born princessof Sweden) also had it.\n\nIt is a crown made from myrtle leaves and the leaves came from a plant that Margaret of Connaught brought with her from Britain. It was customary I think for Swedish brides then to wear a crown at their wedding and Ingrid wore a crown made from this myrtle plant to honour her mother's memory. Her cousins Martha and Astrid also wore the same type of crown although I don't know if it was to honour their aunt or if they just liked the idea . Ingrid also took a branch from this myrtle with her in Denmark and planted it there and if I remember correclty, her daughters and granddaughters used used a few leaves from this plant in their wedding bouquets\n\nWhat is the little bush Swedish Royal brides seem to have on their heads? Queen Astrid of Belgium (born princessof Sweden) also had it.\n\nIt's not just Ingrid and Astrid who have been wearing myrtle crowns/myrtle decorated crowns at their weddings, so did princess Louise of the Netherlands, married to the future Karl XV of Sweden, princess Sophie of Nassau, married to the future Oscar II, and princess Victoria of Baden, married to the future Gustav V, facts from the Swedish Royal Court, Kungliga bröllop - Sveriges Kungahus [NS4 version]\n\nIt was also very common with myrtle crowns among \"ordinary\" brides in Sweden, from the mid/late 1800:s until the 1940:ies, even today there are brides who chooses to wear a myrtle crown at their wedding."
