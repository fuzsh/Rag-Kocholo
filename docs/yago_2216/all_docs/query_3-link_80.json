        "text": "I think:\n\nThis was not unusual at this era. At that time, the members of European monarchies were not knew between they, because the means of transportation were not as evolved as after , especially the plane.\n\nIn this era were very famous \"Engagement\n\n\"(sponsalitia) between high social classes, the bourgeoisie, the aristocrecia and the Monarchy.\n\nThe monarchs , when their children were small, signed a contract (Engagement)with other monarchy ,it was a contract by which committed that their children will marry in future.\n\nBut when the princes knew,the prince did not like the princess or upside down . And they didn´t accepted the contract.\n\nThese contracts have disappeared with the development of means of transportation, because the Princes and princesses started to go to weddings, christenings ... They were knew between them.\n\nIn Spain, the newspaper ABC, in early SXX did a survey of their readers where they had to vote who was the suitable candidate for the Prince Alfonso XIII, in the newspaper carried pictures of Princesses chosen by the monarchists. On the list was Victoria Eugenia of Battenbeg, she was chosen by the readers and she was the Queen.\n\nThe mother of Alfonso XIII and the monarchists signed the \"Engagement\"(sponsalitia) with the family of Victoria Eugenia.\n\nI've read that Olga thought that Frederik was a bit too much of a rough sailor type for her and decided she didn't want to marry him. I have no idea why he waited another 12 years, though.\n\nThis is possibly the best explanation at hand! I don't know whether CP Frederik's alcohol problem had materialised at the time, but what we do know a little about is that he was very much enjoying naval life, including the runs ashore, mess dinners etc.!\n\nThere is every reason to believe that this liaison was arranged! I have no idea what princesses were \"on the market\" at the time, however a Greek\n\nprincess was related to the Danish RF and yet - at the time - sufficiently spaced genetically. Fortunately the pair had the good sense of breaking up before they married!\n\nI know this thread is exactly hot anymore but I do believe there was another aspect to the break-up.\n\nFrederik's younger brother prince Knud was believed to be somewhat dim-witted. Whether or not this was justified I cannot say. But the fact is that he had suffer a certain amount of public rudicule; the chorus of a song from the time went \"let's go over it it one more time for Prince Knud\".\n\nNow I know this is pure speculation but in latter part of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th Eugenics was a widely recognized science (it's wasn't until later when the Nazis took it too extremes that it was abandoned). It is not impossible that CP Frederik and/or Olga had heard about eugenics (as in genetic hygiene not nazism).\n\nSo with a dopey brother the prospect of marrying a woman who is your cousin twice* over may have caused the CP to have doubts about the health of the their children and the future of the monarchy. Or maybe it was Olga who feared for the sanity of her children if they married.\n\nI have to stress that this is pure speculation but I believe that this thought must at some point crossed their minds and it may have been a contributing factor in breaking the engagement.\n\n* they both decend from King Christian IX & Queen Louise and Grand Duke Frederik Franz II of Mecklenburg-Schwerin & Augusta of Reuss Köstritz\n\nAn interesting extract from the book \"Rytterkongen\", translated by the poster Stig:\n\nThere is much more to the story than his drinking. According to “Rytterkongen” - the authorized biography on Christian X written by professor Knud J. V. Jespersen - Frederik’s proposal was somewhat impulsive, and the Crown Prince confided to a friend that he had second thoughts already the next day. A few weeks after the betrothal he went to Athens to meet Olga again and to spend time with her family. Jespersen writes (translated from Danish):\n\n\"During their daily interactions, the two young people soon realised that they were not at all suited to each other. What should have been confidential talk between new lovers turned into formal conversation instead, and apart from the occasional kiss on the cheek, there was no physical contact. When the Crown Prince asked hopefully whether Olga was not looking forward to coming to Denmark, she simply replied sullenly and dismissively that she was supposed to. The whole thing gradually developed so sadly that the Crown Prince made it a habit in the evenings, after saying goodnight to his in-laws, to wander over to King Constantine's palace, where he sought - and found - comfort and support from the King's two eldest daughters, Helene, married to the Romanian Crown Prince Carol, and Irene, who was unmarried and a year younger than Princess Olga. The two lively young girls took loving and understanding care of the unhappy young Danish Crown Prince. And with Princess Irene in particular, he seems to have developed such a warm and intimate relationship that it could well resemble mutual infatuation, which of course further complicated his relationship with Princess Olga.\n\nThe end of it all was indeed a break-up. Just before the end of the visit, which was supposed to have confirmed the relationship between the two newly engaged, Crown Prince Frederik finally summoned up all his courage and openly told his parents-in-law that he no longer cared for their daughter and that it was all a misunderstanding. The father-in-law was furious and scolded the young man, while the mother-in-law almost dismissed it, thinking that things would be fine again and that they would just have to wait and see.\"\n\nhttps://members3.boardhost.com/scandinavia/msg/1681317670.html"
