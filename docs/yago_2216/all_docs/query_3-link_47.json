        "text": "Celebrations are in order as Princess Benedikte of Denmark turns 80 this week. The younger sister of Queen Margrethe II – who abdicated last year – Benedikte is the aunt of King Frederik X, making her tenth in line for the Danish throne.\n\nThe second daughter of then King Frederik IX and Queen Ingrid, daughter of Swedish Prince Gustav Adolf, Benedikte was born on the 29th April 1944, at the Frederik VIII Palace of Amalienborg, central Copenhagen.\n\nIt was a troubling time for Denmark, currently under German occupation in the midst of World War II. Rather than the traditional 21-gun salute celebrating the birth of a new Princess, the Danish Resistance symbolically detonated 21 bombs under a public park in Copenhagen. The act was considered a salute to a brighter future for the people of Denmark. It is no great leap to see the birth of the Princess in a similar light.\n\nAt her baptism, on the 24th of May 1944 (which also happened to be her parents’ 9th wedding anniversary) it was confirmed that Benedikte’s godparents would include her paternal grandparents, King Christian X and Queen Alexandrine, as well as Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. The family are said to have enjoyed afternoon tea together, every day at 4pm, and holidayed in Gråsten Palace in Jutland.\n\nRead More\n\nA first look at My Lady Jane, the new star-studded romantic series set in an alternative Tudor world (so, can it trump Bridgerton as our favourite fantastical period drama?)\n\nMy Lady Jane is inspired by the real life of Lady Jane Grey, who was known as the ‘Nine Day Queen’\n\nA traditional royal education followed. Benedikte commenced her studies at N Zahle’s School in Copenhagen, followed by Benenden School in England. Six years after Benedikte enrolled at the Kent boarding school in 1963, she would be joined by Princess Anne and Princess Basma of Jordan. After her graduation, the Princess studied at a finishing school in Lausanne, then underwent a practical course in fashion design at Margretheskolen.\n\nAs she grew up, Benedikte witnessed monumental changes to Danish royal procedure. The increasing prominence of feminist attitudes towards public life led to a new Act of Succession in 1953, permitting the succession of women. Princess Margrethe became heir presumptive, and younger sister Benedikte found herself second in line to the throne.\n\nAged 18, the Princess was gifted her first tiara. The centrepiece was a floral broach from the jewellery box of her grandmother, the late Queen Alexandrine. This so-called ‘floral tiara’ has accompanied Benedikte for the past six decades, from meeting Pope Paul VI at the Vatican to commemorating the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II in London.\n\nRead More\n\nKate Middleton and Prince William release a previously unseen photograph of their wedding day as they celebrate their 13th anniversary\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales shared the black and white portrait, which was taken by their wedding photographer Millie Pilkington, on their official social media\n\nIn 1967, the Princess attended the wedding of Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands and Claus van Amsberg. It was a marriage marred by controversy. The crowd, outraged at Amsberg’s membership of the Hitler Youth, erupted into large protests outside the Westerkerk church. The golden coach carrying the bride and groom was engulfed by smoke bombs hurled by Provos, members of a Danish anarchist group.\n\nAmid the chaos, Benedikte met His Highness Prince Richard zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg. The two were engaged just one year later and married at Fredensborg Palace on 3rd February 1968. Her lace veil, something borrowed, had previously been worn by both her sisters and her mother.\n\nFollowing her wedding, the 23-year-old Benedikte moved to Schloss Berleburg, an estate in north-western Germany. While her younger sister, Princess Anne-Marie of Greece, forewent her claim to the Danish throne, Benedikte remained an active member of the royal family, even after the birth of Frederik, the current King of Denmark. As Counsellor of State, the Princess would support the King and Queen, travelling between Berleburg and Copenhagen once a month.\n\nNot that life in Germany wasn’t keeping her busy. Benedikte and Richard would go on to have three children: Prince Gustav in 1969, Princess Alexandra in 1970, and Princess Nathalie in 1975. ‘I knew from the start that I would have these two lives,’ Benedikte has said, and a childhood spent in the idyllic grounds of Berleburg came at a cost for her young family. In order to claim succession rights, the King declared that Gustav, Alexandra, and Nathalie would have to be raised in Denmark. Benedikte refused, and the children lost their right to the throne. After the death of Prince Richard, aged 82, in 2017 Prince Gustav took over the maintenance of Berleburg.\n\nRead More\n\n‘We weren’t happy about the way it happened’: Princess Marie of Denmark says Queen Margrethe II’s decision to strip her children of their titles was ‘complicated’ for the family\n\nPrince Joachim of Denmark and his wife Princess Marie relocated their family to the US after their children were stripped of their titles\n\nA recent biography by Anne Sofie Kragh, published to commemorate the Benedikte’s 75th birthday, gave royal fans some insight into the personal life of a Princess who has often been reluctant to open up to the press. ‘There are enough people who talk about themselves,’ she told Kragh. Among contributions from her family, including the revelations that Benedikte is an excellent driver, a terrible cook, and enjoys a cold Tuborg beer before bed, the biography paints a picture of a Princess dedicated to public service.\n\n‘The press has an annoying way of depicting us as if we were actors or members of the jet set,’ she said in the book. ‘Call me old-fashioned, but our role is not to act like film stars. Not that there is anything wrong with film stars, but none of us, at least in my generation, wants to act like them.'\n\nIndeed, Princess Benedikte’s patronships promote a life of service, activity, and compassion. She is chairman of the Joint Committee of Girl Guides, both in Denmark and internationally. It is a cause close to her heart: when she was a girl, a Scout Unit was created specifically so she could join the Guides. As patron of the Princess Benedikte Institute, she has championed the rights of adolescents awaiting adoption papers in Brazil.\n\nIn what must have been a proud moment for Her Royal Highness, both as a mother and a Princess, she awarded the Lis Hartel Memorial Award to her daughter, Princess Nathalie, at the World Equestrian Championships in 2022. The Danish dressage team, coached by Nathalie, won five gold medals at the event, which Benedikte patronised.\n\nTo celebrate her birthday, the Princess attended a private viewing of the “Princess Dresses” exhibition, which tells the story of her life through 20 dresses. Opening to the public, the collection showcases the gowns designed for Benedikte by Jørgen Bender, including maternity clothes and her wedding dress.\n\nIt is a fitting tribute to a Princess who has elegantly navigated the tenuous double life of a royal, evolving with the times yet maintaining a dignified commitment to public service. In a recent interview with Kristeligt Dagblad, Queen Margrethe sang the praises of her younger sister: ‘Benedikte,’ she said, ‘is really the most royal of us all.’"
