        "text": "Interested in the history of the Danish monarchy? You’re not alone! Luckily, there’s a lot of lineage to discuss. The history of Danish royal family goes back much further than the reign of the current royal house of Denmark! The unified Kingdom of Denmark was founded (and made Christian) by the Viking Kings Harald Bluetooth and Gorm the Old in the 10th century.\n\nAmazingly, today’s members of the royal family can be traced back to King Harald Bluetooth. This means that Danish royalty is descended from the Vikings.\n\nThe original monarchy was elective; it became hereditary in the 17th century. In 1849, it then became a constitutional monarchy. But let’s rewind: what did the Danish monarchy in the Viking age look like?\n\nFind out everything you need to know about the Royal Family of Denmmark:\n\n→\n\nHistory of the Danish monarchy\n\n→\n\nMembers of the Danish royal family\n\nQueen Margrethe II of Denmark\n\nKing Frederik\n\nQueen Mary\n\nCrown Prince Christian\n\nPrincess Isabella\n\nPrince Vincent\n\nPrincess Josephine\n\nPrince Joachim\n\nPrincess Marie\n\nCount Nikolai\n\nCount Felix\n\nCount Henrik\n\nCountess Athena\n\nPrincess Benedikte\n\nPrincess Anne-Marie\n\n→\n\nWhere does the Danish royal family live?\n\n→\n\nIs the Danish royal family popular?\n\n→\n\nWhat was the Danish royal family feud?\n\n→\n\nWho is next in line for the Danish crown?\n\n→\n\nIs the Danish royal family related to the Swedish royal family?\n\n→\n\nIs the Danish royal family related to the British royal family?\n\n→\n\nIs the Danish royal family related to the Vikings?\n\n→\n\nWhat religion is the Danish royal family?\n\n→\n\nWhat is the Queen’s speech?\n\nThe Danish royal family tree\n\nSee the full Scandinavian royal family tree up close.\n\nHistory of the Danish monarchy\n\nThe history of the Danish kings goes back 1200 years, at least. The Jelling stones record the stories of the first kings, including Harthancut, his son Gorm the Old, and Harald Bluetooth. In Bluetooth’s time, the Danish kingdom stretched from modern day Germany (Dannevirke) to southern Sweden, as well as Norway. Two generations later, with Canute the Great (Knut in Danish), was considered the peak of the Viking age, as Canute and his father, Swyen Forkbeard, both expanded their empire into present-day England. This period was called the North Sea Empire, or the Anglo-Scandinavian Empire.\n\nOne of the most important familial lines of the Danish royal family is the Royal House of Oldenburg. The family is a Germany dynasty that then became connected with Denmark when Count Christian I was elected king of Denmark in 1448, followed by Norway in 1450 and finally Sweden in 1457.\n\nThe House of Oldenburg is still relevant today because Denmark’s contemporary royal family is a direct (patrilineal) descendant. The branch of the royal house from which they come is the House of Glücksburg, which is also connected to King Charles III of the United Kingdom and King Harald V of Norway through Danish King Christian IX.\n\nInto the first half of the 17th century, the line of succession was elective in concept, but in practice the kingdom was typically passed down to the king’s son or next of kin. This tradition continued on until the disaster of the Second Northern War (1657), in which first Denmark and then Sweden faced catastrophic consequences for war-mongering. In Denmark’s case, King Frederik III embarked on a war of revenge in Sweden, thinking that his new ally, The Netherlands, would step in.\n\nGiven that Denmark was the aggressor in this case, the Netherlands remained neutral. At the same time, cold-weather caused the Great Belt (a strait between the Danish islands of Fune and Zealand) to freeze, so that King Charles X Gustav of Sweden marched his army right across the ice. The Danish kingdom ended up losing many parts of Eastern Denmark as well as two counties in Norway.\n\nThree months later, King Charles X Gustav decided to push his luck and wage war again; his ultimate goal was to bring all of Scandinavia under his rule, and so he sent his army to capture Copenhagen. Instead of the immediate surrender that the Swedish army expected, the Danes put up a fight. Because they were being attacked, their alliance with the Netherlands kicked in, and they received both personnel reinforcements and supplies. Denmark stood up to the attack.\n\nShortly thereafter, King Charles X Gustav died suddenly, and The Treaty of Copenhagen was signed, giving Bornholm back to Denmark and Trøndelag back to Norway. The treaty’s outcome created lines separating Norway, Sweden, and Denmark that still exist in many ways today.\n\nIt was after this series of battles and treaties that absolutist monarchy with male primogeniture came to the Danish kingdom in 1660-61. This means that accession to the throne could only be passed through the male family members.\n\nFor nearly two centuries, the monarchy was absolute, but by the 19th century, cultural feelings about how the monarchy should operate within a country were changing. When Frederik VII came to power in 1848, he was under immense pressure to change the monarchy to a constitutional one, which he did with the June Constitution of 1849.\n\nAt the same time, Denmark tried to formally annex Schleswig-Holstein, an area of what is now northern Germany, which by that time had become a Duchy with the Danish king presiding over the region as a Duke. This resulted in the The First War of Schleswig (1848-51), after which Denmark maintained their control and held up King Frederik VII as a war hero, despite the fact that he had not taken part in any battles. In the Second War of Schleswig (1864), Prussia won this territory.\n\nJust prior to the second war, in 1863, Christian IX ascended to the throne after having been selected as the heir presumptive (Frederik VII had no sons) with the approval of the great powers of Europe. Known as the “Father-in-Law of Europe,” Christian IX was the first Danish monarch to come from the House of Glücksburg, the royal branch that would go on to produce royalty across the continent.\n\nBack to Schleswig-Holstein – yes, that old chestnut – if matters seemed settled after two wars, they were not. In 1920, the region was the cause of a constitutional crisis when King Christian X used his reserve power granted to him by the Danish constitution to dismiss the entire government. He did so because he believed that, post WWI, Schleswig-Holstein should be reunified with Denmark.\n\nThe Treaty of Versailles actually left this up to two plebiscites (direct votes of an electoral body), one in the north of the region and one in the central area of the region, but Christian X felt that regardless of the vote, both areas should become part of Denmark. This was at least partly due to the belief that Germany should be left in as weak a state as possible following the end of the war.\n\nKing Christian X ordered Prime Minister Carl Theodor Zahle to move ahead with the king’s wishes, but Zahle refused; Denmark had been a parliamentary democracyy since 1901 and the Prime Minister intended to keep it that way. A few days after his refusal, and after some tense words between the two men, Zahle resigned.\n\nThat’s when Christian X really messed up: he dismissed the entire Danish parliament and installed his own cabinet, under Otto Liebe. Public reaction was swift: the people were outraged, and there was movement towards a total overthrow of the monarchy.\n\nRather than let this be his hill to die on, Christian X dismissed his de facto government and backed down into the symbolic role that the monarchy takes today. This is the last time that a Danish monarch tried to exert executive power over the government and is known as the Easter Crisis of 1920.\n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, the royal family has modernized slightly, first with the Act of Succession in 1953 that allowed for women to be in the line succession. In the case of this act, women were only secondarily in line. This means, for example, that if Queen Margrethe had a younger brother instead of two younger sisters, her brother would have been in line for the throne.\n\nIn 2009, the rules were once again updated such that primogeniture did not prioritize men over women, but rather that the throne simply goes to the eldest child. That brings us up to today!\n\nWho are the members of the Danish royal family?\n\nThe Danish royal family consists of King Frederik, his wife Queen Mary, and their four children. Their eldest son, Crown Prince Christian, is next in line for the throne.\n\nHis mother, Queen Margrethe II, was the reigning monarch from 1972- 2024. She abdicated the throne in January 2024. The Queen’s husband Prince Consort Henrik died in 2018.\n\nThe family also includes Prince Joachim, Queen Margrethe’s younger son, and his wife Princess Marie. Queen Margrethe’s grandchildren are notable members of the royal family as well.\n\nIn September 2022, Queen Margrethe changed change the royal titles of some of her grandchildren, specifically those of Prince Joachim and Princess Marie, from prince and princess to count and countess of Monpezat, allowing them to pursue private lives free of royal duties while still maintaining their place in the line of succession.\n\nRead more about that later: What was the Danish royal family feud?\n\nThis decision is part of a broader trend of royal “slimming” seen across European monarchies.\n\nHM Queen Margrethe II of Denmark\n\nBorn 1940\n\nMargrethe Alexandrine Þorhildur Ingrid became HM Queen Margrethe II in 1972, at the age of 32. She was the longest running head of state, and a very popular one at that, with an approval rating of over 80%. Queen Margrethe abdicated the throne in January 2024, after announcing her abdication on New Year’s Eve, 2023, as part of her traditional speech.\n\nIn 1953, the Act of Succession gave women the right of succession to the Danish throne, but only in a secondary capacity. It was as a result of this act that Margrethe became Queen of Denmark. She was the eldest daughter of Frederik IX and Queen Ingrid (originally of Sweden), and had two younger sisters: Benedikte and Anne-Marie.\n\nShe married French diplomat Henri-Marie-Jean-André de Laborde de Monpezat in 1967, who then became Prince Henrik of Denmark. Less than a year later, she had her first child, Frederik. Another year after that, her second son Joachim was born.\n\nMargrethe is not only known for her role as monarch. She is also an accomplished artist and illustrator, including doing the illustrations for the Danish version of The Lord of the Rings series under the pseudonym Ingahild Grathmer after she sent them to J.R.R. Tolkien himself. The Queen has a degree in political science; speaks five languages: Danish, English, Swedish, French, and German. She even holds private audiences with seven of her subjects every fortnight during winter, giving her visitors the opportunity to discuss any subject they wish to raise.\n\nWhen she was born in 1940, Danish silversmith company Georg Jensen produced their now-beloved Daisy collection in her honor. As a result, her nickname is “Daisy.” The Queen’s fashion sense; unique, elegant, and sometimes eccentric, has cemented her as a style icon.\n\nQueen Margrethe is well-known as a heavy smoker, although she stopped smoking publicly in 2006, and apparently quit after her spinal surgery in 2023. She now enjoys her retirement and has retained her title as Queen.\n\nKing Frederik of Denmark\n\nBorn 1968\n\nKing Frederik, also known as HRH King Frederik, is next in line for the Danish throne. King Frederik and Prince Joachim, his younger brother, grew up very close, as they were only a year apart.\n\nHis Royal Highness King Frederik married Queen Mary in 2004 and has four children: Crown Prince\n\nChristian, Princess Isabella, and twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine.\n\nThe role of the Danish monarch is not political; he does not express political opinions publicly. He is meant to represent Denmark abroad and be a “unifying figure” domestically. He formally appoints the government following elections, holds a meeting with the Prime Minister every Wednesday (when they are in the country), and presides over the Council of State.\n\nKing Frederik is the first Danish royal to earn a Master’s degree: he has an MSc. of political science from Aarhus University. In addition to his studies, Frederik has undertaken military training, undertaking an education from Frømandskorpset, the naval elite special operations forces, as a frogman (e.g. scuba diving in a military capacity).\n\nThe King speaks four languages: Danish, English, French, and German. His particular areas of interest are scientific research, environmental studies, and sports.\n\nQueen Mary of Denmark\n\nBorn 1972\n\nBorn Mary Donaldson in Tasmania, Australia, Queen Mary met King Frederik in 2000 during the Summer Olympics in Sydney.\n\nShe has a dual Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Law, as well as graduate certificates in advertising. She worked as an account manager and director for various advertising agencies in Australia and internationally before eventually moving to Denmark to be with Frederik.\n\nAfter their marriage in 2004 at Vor Frue Kirke, Mary and Frederik had four children, the first of which was born in 2005.\n\nQueen Mary supports a number of charitable causes, including an anti-bullying campaign. Notably, she is the first royal to serve as a patron for an LGBTQ+ event, when she was a patron of WorldPride in 2021.\n\nCrown Prince Christian\n\nBorn 2005\n\nDenmark’s royal family has a tradition of naming the first child son “Frederik” or “Christian.” Following the Danish tradition, King Frederik and Queen Mary named their first son Crown Prince Christian. His full name is Christian Valdemar Henri John, Crown Prince of Denmark, Count of Monpezat.\n\nPrincess Isabella\n\nBorn 2007\n\nIsabella Henrietta Ingrid Margrethe, Princess of Denmark, Countess of Monpezat, is the second child of Crown King Frederik and Queen Mary.\n\nPrince Vincent\n\nBorn 2011\n\nVincent Frederik Minik Alexander, Prince of Denmark, Count of Monpezat, is the child of the Crown King Frederik and Queen Mary. Prince Vincent of Denmark has a twin: Princess Josephine.\n\nPrincess Josephine\n\nBorn 2011\n\nJosephine Sophia Ivalo Mathilda, Princess of Denmark, Countess of Monpezat, is Crown King Frederik and Queen Mary. Her twin is Prince Vincent.\n\nPrince Joachim\n\nBorn 1969\n\nJoachim Holger Waldemar Christian, Prince of Denmark, Count of Monpezat, is the second child of Her Royal Highness Queen Margrethe and Prince Henrik. Prince Joachim’s education is in agrarian economics, and he owns a number of farming and forestry operations. He is also a decorated military officer, rising to the position of colonel of the reserve. He then rose to a brigadier general when he became Defense attaché at the Danish Embassy in Paris in 2020.\n\nPrince Joachim’s first marriage was in 1995 to Alexandra Christina Manley, with whom he had two children: Count Nikolai and Count Felix. They divorced in 2005. He married Marie Cavallier in 2008 and they have two children: Count Henrik and Countess Athena.\n\nAs of January 2023, Prince Joachim’s four children were stripped of their “prince” and “princess” titles, instead being referred to as His or Her Excellency, as well as Count/Countess of Monpezat. Prince Joachim and his family all expressed displeasure at this change.\n\nPrincess Marie\n\nBorn 1976\n\nPrincess Marie of Denmark, Countess of Monpezat, is the wife of Prince Joachim. She is originally from France. although she also lived in Switzerland and the US. Before moving to Denmark in 2007, Marie worked in marketing for a number of advertising agencies.\n\nPrincess Marie is the stepmother to Count Nikolai and Count Felix, and also has two children with Joachim: Henrik and Athena.\n\nCount Nikolai\n\nBorn 1999\n\nCount Nikolai (formerly known as Prince Nikolai), is the eldest son of Prince Joachim and his first wife, Alexandra.\n\nIn 2018, he signed with Scoop Models and began working as a model. In 2019, he entered Copenhagen Business School for a degree in Business Management and Service Administration.\n\nCount Felix\n\nBorn 2002\n\nCount Felix (formerly known as Prince Felix), is the second child of Prince Joachim and his first wife, Alexandra.\n\nHe received Army Lieutenant Training at the Royal Danish Military Academy.

Constantine died in 2023.\n\nWhere does the Danish royal family live?\n\nThe royal family in Denmark has several residences. The official royal household of the family is Amalienborg Palace, in the centre of Copenhagen.

They are often the subject of positive royal family news stories, found in magazines such as Danish tabloid Ekstra Bladet and Danish newspaper BT.\n\nDuring her reign, Queen Margrethe II was considered the most popular monarch with the world, with an approval rating of over 80%. King Frederik and Queen Mary, as well as their kids, are also particularly popular with the media.\n\nWhat was the Danish royal family feud?\n\n“Feud” is perhaps a strong word, but that is the word that got tossed around in the media in September of 2022. At that time, Queen Margrethe announced that she would be changing the royal titles of prince and princess of four of her grandchildren – those of Prince Joachim and Princess Marie – to count and countess of Monpezat.\n\nThe Queen noted that she had given the change a lot of thought, and that she felt it best for her grandchildren’s futures, as without the title of prince or princess, they would then be free of royal duties and able to pursue private lives.\n\nShe explained, “I have made my decision as Queen, mother and grandmother, but, as a mother and grandmother, I have underestimated the extent to which much my younger son and his family feel affected.”\n\nThe children still maintain their place in the line of succession, but they are no longer obligated to the more formal elements of royal affiliation. Lest one think this is about money: it’s actually not. None of the royal grandchildren are granted an allowance as adults, excepting Prince Christian, who is the eldest son and second in line to the Danish throne behind his father, Crown Prince Frederik.\n\nPrince Joachim and Princess Marie’s response was swift and unprecedented; they openly expressed complete shock and upset at the decision. This public display threw the royal family for a loop.\n\nJoachim and his family eventually moved to Washington, DC, in the USA in January 2023.\n\nSince the announcement of the title change, Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary have expressed support for the choice, while the Queen has further explained that she made this choice so that her son, Frederik, wouldn’t have to. She then abdicated the throne in January 2024, putting her words into practice.\n\nThis move is part of the Danish monarchy staying in line with royal “slimming” that has taken place across European royal families, including Sweden’s monarchy.\n\nWho is next in line for the Danish crown?\n\nCurrently, Crown Prince Christian, son of King Frederik and Queen Mary, is next in line for the Danish crown. Princess Isabella, Crown Prince Christian’s younger sister, is second in line for the throne.\n\nIs the Danish royal family related to the Swedish royal family?\n\nYou bet they are. Danish King Frederik is the first cousin once removed of Swedish King Carl XVI Gustav. Swedish King Gustav VI Adolf is grandfather to both.\n\nRead more\n\nThe Swedish Royal Family: Everything You Need to Know\n\nSee the full Scandinavian royal family tree.\n\nIs the Danish royal family related to the British royal family?\n\nOf course they are! Most of the European royals are connected through Britain’s Queen Victoria, who had nine children and 42 grandchildren. Queen Victoria is the great great great-grandmother of King Charles III (therefore great great-grandmother to Queen Elizabeth II) and the great great great-grandmother of King Frederik.\n\nSee the full Scandinavian royal family tree.\n\nIs the Danish royal family related to the Vikings?\n\nYes! King Frederik can trace his ancestry back to Harald Bluetooth, the first king of Denmark. The rune stones at Jelling, Denmark, were inscribed by King Harald about 1,000 years ago. That’s something you probably won’t find out via 23andme, right?\n\nWhat religion is the Danish royal family?\n\nWhile the entire royal family of Denmark is not required to be one religion, the monarch him or herself must be a member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Denmark (also known as the Danish National Church).\n\nThough it’s not required, all family members are part of the Danish National Church, and almost all those marrying into the family have converted.\n\nReligion is not a major part of the the royal family’s visibility in the country, but it is a portion of the monarch’s responsibilities. Along with Parliament (Folketing), the monarch constitutes the secular head of the state church, which means the monarch fulfils certain tasks such as authorising texts to be used in the church and appointing bishops.\n\nWhat is the King’s speech?\n\nAt 6 pm on New Year’s Eve, the current monarch gives short speech that addresses, in general terms, ups and downs of the past year. The speech is broadcast over television and radio, and is typically filmed from Amalienborg Palace.\n\nThis tradition was started in 1941 when King Christian X gave a radio address. While the event may seem a little old fashioned, it’s actually a very big deal for Danes; they gather around the television or radio to hear it, and often plan dinner parties or New Year’s events around it. The next day, you’ll hear people discussing what the Queen said. If you’re new to Denmark and there for New Year’s Eve, make sure to tune in!\n\nOn 31st December 2023, Queen Margrethe used the beginning of her speech to announce a surprise (but not shocking, given her age and length of her reign) abdication of the throne, which took place on 14th January 2024.\n\nWant to learn more about Scandinavian royals?
