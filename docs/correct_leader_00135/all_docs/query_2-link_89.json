        "text": "1913\n\nThe international municipal movement is born, with the launch of the Union Internationale des Villes (UIV) in Ghent, Belgium. Participants at the International Congress of the Art of Building Cities and Organising Community Life decide to create the UIV – a permanent office for communication and documentation on municipal issues. The first seat of the association is in Brussels and a Provisional Council of 30 members is set up.\n\n1914\n\nAugust 1914: First World War begins. The UIV is unable to continue in any significant way, though a “provisional seat” was established at the offices of the Association of Netherlands Municipalities, VNG, in The Hague.\n\n1918\n\nWorld War I comes to an end and the founding fathers of the movement return to their respective countries, most survive the war intact\n\n1919\n\nFollowing the armistice, an appeal is made by UIV Secretary General Vinck for information, and for finance to support the work of the UIV.\n\n1920\n\nA meeting is held for UIV post-war promoters during the ‘Quinzaine Internationale’ (International Fortnight), held from 5th-20th September in Brussels, which included a ‘Town Planning and Local Government Section’. Henri Sellier, Mayor of Suresnes, and Dr Florentinus Marinus Wibaut, Alderman of Amsterdam are given the task of re-activating the Union Internationale des Villes. The founding fathers of the movement consider the League of Nations as potential partners.\n\n1921\n\nDespite financial constraints, Emile Vinck, Secretary General of UIV, creates the first Tablettes Documentaires Municipales (Documentary Notes on Municipal Affairs), a newsletter composed of texts and articles relating to municipal life from various member countries on municipal topics, such as urbanism, housing, sewage water, transport, public hygiene, and fires. This publication is put together in cooperation with the Internatinal Institute of Administrative Science and the International Federation for Housing and Planning.\n\n1922\n\nIn September, a meeting is held in Paris entitled , “Preparatory Conference of the Promotors of the International Union of Local Authorities”. The decision is taken to hold a congress in Paris, and to organise an international documentation centre. In fact, the Paris Congress does not take place until 1925.\n\n1923\n\nInter-municipal cooperation is placed on the agenda of 4th Assembly of the League of Nations via a resolution from Cuba on behalf of the Pan-American Union and the League’s Secretariat is requested to produce a report on this topic. Meetings take place between Emile Vinck and Ken Harada, the League Secretariat official in charge of the report, but do not lead to concrete conclusions.\n\n1924\n\n30th June: The 2nd UIV Congress is held in Amsterdam attempts to “establish permanent relationships between local authorities” and “develop interchangeable documentation” for its members. Dr F. M. Wibaut becomes President of UIV and Emile Braun and G. Cooreman Honorary Presidents. The Congress also addresses how the Union can contribute to the work of the League of Nations and of International Organisations and a committee is set up to organise the next Congress.\n\n1925\n\n3rd UIV Congress takes place in Paris addressing (1) systems of municipal government in various countries, (2) land use policy of local authorities and its influence on the problem of housing, and (3) large agglomerations. The Congress receives a major report from Mr G.Montagu Harris, then of the Ministry of Health in London, and who in future will play a major role in IULA’s life. Reports on the other subjects are made by Mr Droogleever Fortuyn, who later will be Mayor of Rotterdam, and by Mr Sellier, Mayor of Suresnes and Secretary General of the Union des Villes et Communes de France. Over 720 delegates attend the congress and it is decided to attempt to re-kindle links with the German union.\n\n1926\n\nIt takes until the General Council meeting of Dusseldorf in October to create and normalise the permanent representative bodies of UIV. A new UIV publication, Les Sciences Administratives, complements the existing Tablettes Documentaires Municipales. By 1926, UIV boasts a network bringing together 52,000 cities in 30 different countries rendering effective service at both national and international levels.\n\n1927\n\nA special conference is held in Bern, Switzerland leads to recommendations on road traffic signs; these are later adoption by international bodies, including the League of Nations. This year marks a period of prosperity for the UIV as contact is made with North American municipalities who benefit from support from, among others, the Laura Spellman Rockefeller Memorial. The membership of the British, the return of the Germans and the expansion towards the east of Europe also helps fuel the Union’s growth. A supplement is added to the UIV newsletter: l’administration Locale.\n\n1928\n\nFollowing the success of Emile Vinck’s travels around the UK and North America in 1925 to raise the profile of UIV among the English-speaking world, the Union changes name to become the International Union of Local Authorities and moves towards becoming a Federation of National and Local Authorities.\n\n1929\n\n4th IULA Congress begins in Seville and addresses the financial organisation of local authorities, community enterprises of an economic nature and expropriation of land for public utility. The 200 delegates then take the train to Barcelona, during the journey they are greeted by local delegations at every stop. Dictator and Prime Minister Primo de Rivera presides over a IULA meeting stating that the municipality, “is where the start of democratic government must lie”. This Congress attracts a large delegation from Latin America for the first time.\n\n1930\n\nIULA Conference in Liège-Antwerp in the framework of the centenary celebration of the foundation of the state of Belgium. The sessions address the issues of Insurances of local authorities against all risk and enterprises and communal services of a mixed nature. Jules Lespes’ book “local government in the United States” is published by IULA. Creation of International Institute of Administrative Sciences by the International Congress of Administrative Sciences held in Madrid.\n\n1931\n\nKey figures from the American municipal movement, later grouped under the Public Administration Clearing House (PACH), tour Europe over several weeks searching for potential European partners including IULA. Similar visits had taken place in 1930, and would again in 1932. The IULA committee responsible for organising and promoting congresses increases its efforts as advertisements for the 5th Congress are circulated one year before the event. The IULA publication adopts a new, more modern style.\n\n1932\n\nThe 5th IULA Congress takes place in London, UK, with focus on the practical working of local authorities and training and strengthening municipal employees. Mr Montagu Harris presents a 31-country report on the first topic. The congress includes a number of study tours, including the “garden city” of Letchworth and Welwyn and featuring discussions with academics including Professors Robson, Tawney and Keynes. For the first time, reports from the Congress are published in English and German in addition to French. 28 Governments, 27 National Unions of local authorities, 252 municipalities from 40 countries and fifty organisations of municipal interest come together – some 924 participants.\n\n1933\n\nGeorge Montagu Harris visits the United States over 6 months to study municipal systems. He refers to the Public Administration Clearing House in Chicago under the management of Mr. Louis Brownlow, as one of the most valuable research institutions in America. He also tours throughout India and Japan and publishes the conclusions of this tour in his books “Westward to the East” and “Comparative Local Government”.\n\n1934\n\nThe IULA Conference in Lyon, France gives focus on teaching topics of interest to municipalities, creating a communal science and the collection and destruction of home refuse. The American Committee for the International Union of Local Authorities is created and funded by the Rockefeller foundation to maintain relations with IULA. This group changes the way IULA operates and becomes the link between the American municipal movement and the various bodies working on municipal issues. The American financial contribution increases from 200 USD to 3,500 USD.\n\n1935\n\nThe German financial contribution to IULA doubles from 5,000 to 10,000 Reichsmark ahead of the Berlin Congress, which was decided at the 1932 London Congress, shortly before Hitler is made Chancellor of Germany in January 1933. IULA decides to go ahead with the Congress in Germany despite the Nazi regime’s actions with the support of President Wibaut however he passes away before the Congress in early 1935 to be replaced by George Montagu Harris.\n\n1936\n\nThe 6th IULA Congress in Berlin-Munich, Germany takes place with high absentee levels and deep concerns. A key report is presented on the fight of communities against unemployment. There is an exhibition during the Congress entitled, “the German Municipality” that is “a unilateral display of German municipal management achievements” (Stefan Coupernas*).This Congress marks the beginning of a wider, more international membership for the IULA outside of Europe and North America. John Stutz, President of the American Municipal Association, becomes Vice-President of IULA.\n\n1937\n\nIULA continues to organise conferences open to members on specialist topics like the fight against smoke, dust and toxic gas and the regulation and control of milk in Paris, France.\n\n1938\n\nMarking IULA’s 25th anniversary, a conference is held in Glasgow, UK, in the context of the Empire Exhibition, a colonial exhibition of the British Empire. The specialist conference addresses practical issues for municipal administrators including: treatment of sewage water and industrial waste and prevention of pollution of running water. Preparations begin on the 1940 Congress in Bucharest, however the Congress would never take place.\n\n1939\n\nIn May, the city of Liège opens the Hydrologic International Exhibition to celebrate the success of the Albert cannel. IULA intended to hold a conference on this occasion but the exhibition closes prematurely in September because of the war. Work on the movement ceases as World War II divides the globe. A later report from Emile Vinck states that research work continued during the war with the help of the Belgian Association and through the Pan-American centre in Havana, the official address of IULA during this period.\n\n1940\n\nThe 7th Congress of IULA was scheduled to take place in Budapest but was postponed due to the War.\n\n1943\n\nHenri Sellier, mayor of the French town of Suresnes from 1919 to 1914, promoter of “garden cities”, and one of the UIV’s first activits, dies. 830 women in Coventry, England, sign their names on a tablecloth and give money to by medical supplies in Stalingrad (now Volgograd). The tablecloth is then embroidered and then presented to the people of Stalingrad as a symbol of war-time solidarity as both towns were severly bombed during the war and results in the creation of a ‘bond of friendship´, an early form of twinning.\n\n1944\n\nCreation in Lyon of “La Fédération” by André Voisin, Jacques Bassot and Max Richard in promotion of decentralisation, European unification and intermediary bodies in the organisation of society. First Secretary General, André Voisin, would later play an important role in the creation of the Council of European Municipalities.\n\n1945\n\nIULA Secretary General Emile Vinck attends the first meeting of the newly-founded UNESCO in London, submitting a memorandum seeking cooperation.\n\n1946\n\nA limited conference is held in Brussels thanks to the support from a number of national unions (France, UK, United States, Switzerland and the Netherlands) at which 12 unions or national committees are represented. Total participation reaches 120. The participants address issues relating to the War: municipal autonomy, the role played by the municipality in civic education and the tasks of municipalities in reconstruction. Reports are received from national unions on these topics and discussion take place over 4 days in parallel with the International Institute of Administrative Science meeting.\n\n1947\n\nThe first post-war IULA congress is held in Paris, France in the newly refurbished UNESCO building with representatives from 23 countries. During this congress, a group of French and German mayors establish the Union International des Maires (UIM) to foster friendly relations between the two countries and ensure peace. This year, Nicholas Arkema, Director-General of the VNG tours the USA at Emile Vinck’s request to re-establish links between IULA and the US. Efforts are made to make ties with Central and South America, and the Scandinavian countries.\n\n1948\n\nEmile Vinck and Nicholas Arkema decide to move the entire Secretariat to The Hague where it will remain until 2004. In the same year, VNG President Pieter Oud, Mayor of Rotterdam, becomes President of IULA as George Montagu Harris retires, and Mr Arkema, director of VNG, replaces Emile Vinck as Secretary General of IULA. The first female Deputy Secertary-General of IULA is appointed, Ms. H.J.D. Revers, formerly Assistant Director of the Union of Netherlands Municipalities. Emile Vinck’s message upon retiring from the Union, “we pass the torch on to you, keep it burning.” The UIM holds meeting in Mont Pélerin, Switzerland, at the initiative of Eugène Wyler and Dr Hans Zbindon to bring together French and German mayors with view to re-launching dynamic exchanges and reconciliation.\n\n1949\n\nA total of 250 delegates participate in the IULA Conference in Geneva, Switzerland the Swedish, Danish and Norwegian unions of local authorities re-join following their departure before the war, the Germans also become members again and the newly established union of Israeli local authorities joins. Emile Vinck addresses the Conference as former Secretary General and is welcomed with great applause. The structure of the conference changes: general reports are only circulated on main subject; a spoken address is given for subsidiary issues. The agenda continues to focus on reconstruction and reconciliation. The IULA Bulletin is created featuring shorter publication summarising news and IULA events, every three months.\n\n1950\n\nA call by the PACH movement for a strengthening of work ties between IULA and the International Federation for Housing and Town Planning (est. 1913) as the two organisations share an office in The Hague. Emile Vinck dies a few days before his 80th birthday. Secretary General of La Fédération Andrés Voisin organises \"Les Etats Généraux des Communes et Départements de France\", in Versailles from 24-25 June. This meeting becomes the first step in the process that would lead, a few months later, to the creation of the Council of European Municipalities.\n\n1951\n\nCreation of the Monde Bilingue byJean Marie Bressand aiming to promote universal bilingual education. René Vettier, director of the Ecole normale supérieur of Saint-Cloud is founding president of the association. The UIM struggle to formalize a federally-inspired constitution before the Council of Europe. Following the proposal of French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Robert Schuman, on the creation of an organised Europe as a means of guaranteeing peaceful relations, a group of European mayors found the Council of European Municipalities (CEM) in Geneva to represent local interests at European level. The association is mainly composed of pro-European members of the IULA, La Fédération and UIM. IULA Congress takes place in Brighton, UK to address water supply and sewerage; local authorities and education. Mr Montagu Harris attends this congress and pays special homage to Emile Vinck.\n\n1952\n\nAs part of the Monde Bilingue, the first twinning is formalized between Luchon (France) and Harrogate (England) with the support of the two Mayors: Alfred Coste-Floret and Don Christelow. The Monde Bilingue announces that this experiment will be composed of 3 stages: implementation of bilingual pedagogical systems in French and British towns where both languages will be taught to children at primary school; creation of bilingual towns; town twinning to allow exchanges of teachers and assistants and trade union material.\n\n1953\n\nThe Monde Bilingue makes few advances at national level and focuses directly on the local level for support. The first General Meeting of CEM is held in Versailles and results in the publication of the charter focusing on the intentions of mayors to establish a municipal input on future supranational consultations or significant political or economic agreements between nation-states. IULA Congress is held in Vienna featuring a comparative study on “The Big City and the Small Municipalities” by Dr. Karl Honayand and with address by the Austrian Head of State, Dr. Theodore Körner. The congress ends with a ball in the Town Hall Square (Rathausplatz) to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the IULA. IULA Bulletin appears in trilingual editions: English, French, German.\n\n1954\n\nTwinning actions are the centre of CEM’s activity: “Twinning is like a courtship in which one must get to know the potential partner, find out if they are interested and […] both feel that they would wish for a more permanent relationship”* Le Monde Bilingue’s twinnings go beyond the Anglo-French world: in Europe, the mayor of Neukôln (West Berlin) proposes a twinning with districts of Paris and London; in America, the Canadian Federation of Mayors and Municipalities grouping more than three hundred cities (75% of urban population) joins the Monde Bilingue.\n\n1955\n\nTown twinning - a hot debate during the Cold War takes place. CEM takes the line, only twin with partner towns in liberal democracies. The Monde Bilingue, and in future FMCU-UTO argue, twinning with towns in different political systems helps international understanding. The French government denounces le Monde Bilingue for its links; meanwhile Giorgio La Pira, Mayor of Florence, organises a mayors’ conference on the role of cities for peace-building – mayors from USA, USSR, and P.R. of China participate. IULA’s Congress takes place in Rome, with the main theme “Local Government Finance and Local Autonomy”. Dr Vittorio Pertusio, mayor of Genoa, draws up the conclusions of the 24 national reports in a volume that becomes an important source of comparative municipal law. His Holiness Pope Pius XII makes a special address.\n\n1956\n\nUS President Eisenhower founds the People-to-People programme to encourage American citizens to undertake exchanges with citizens of other countries to promote cultural interaction and world peace. The Monde Bilingue announces its intention to hold a World Twinning Congress in St Etienne in 1956, with two soviet mayors confirming participation. CEM calls upon French mayors to boycott this Congress in consequence. The twinning congress is postponed to 1957 and will take place in Aix-les-Bains, Switzerland.\n\n1957\n\nThe Monde Bilingue is extended to FMVJ – Fédération Mondiale de Villes Jumelées (later United Towns Organisation UTO in English) during the founding congress in Aix-les-Bains on 28th April with a goal of multiplying actions and efficiency by becoming involved in global programmes. The founding President is Chanoine Félix Kir, Mayor of Dijon, France. Twinning becomes an instrument of human culture, essential for bringing together populations with no regard for political party and without exclusivity. Jean-Marie Bressand addresses a letter to Edouard Herriot, who was at the same time president of CEM and honorary president of the Monde Billingue, regarding the feud between CEM and le Monde Bilingue, “Everything divides States but everything unites municipalities”. IULA holds a Congress in The Hague on the Problems of Expanding Towns; Traffic congestion in the City Centre; Local Authorities and European Economic Integration.\n\n1958\n\nIn line with the People-to-People programme, Sister Cities International is created as a clearing-house for the sister city movement, the objective is to promote peace through mutual respect, understanding, and cooperation. UTO holds its second Congress in Harrogate, UK and Louis Bazerque, Mayor of Toulouse, France, is elected president. First meeting of the IULA Public Health Committee, a direct result of the working ties with the World Health Organization.\n\n1959\n\nFirst Franco-Soviet twinning conducted between Dijon (France) and Stalingrad (USSR) as part of the FMVJ-UTO movement: “Twinning is aimed at putting working class people together. In practical terms – and history can confirm this – the masses are capable of maintaining peace”, Mayor of Dijon. The IULA Congress is held Berlin and dedicated to Young People and the Care of the Aged. The opening address is given by Mr. Lodovico Benvenuti, Secretary General of the Council of Europe and the session is chaired by Willy Brandt, Mayor of Berlin. A large international presence from Asia and Africa marks an important milestone in the growth of IULA.\n\n1960\n\nThe autonomy of local authorities is featured in the 3rd FMVJ-UTO Congress in Aosta (Italy) and a call is made by UNESCO to take into account the value of cultural exchanges at local level as the level closest to citizens. The president of FMVJ-UTO, William Callow (Lord Mayor of Coventry, UK) and Giulio Dolchi, Mayor of Aosta, welcome over 600 participants. This meeting marks the first appearance of African members and starts African twinning. A IULA Congress is also held in Tel-Aviv, Israel with special focus on the tasks of local authorities in developing areas. IULA President Oud retires and is awared a bronze, his successor is Mr A. Spinoy, Mayor of Malines, Belgium.\n\n1961\n\nIULA Conference is held in Washington on ‘Local Government in the USA: recent trends and developments and the problems of metropolitan areas’, with participation from over 50 countries. Two representatives, Mr. Robert F. Wagner, Mayor of New York, and Mr. G. E. van Walsum, Burgomaster of Rotterdam, present a general survey of the main problems in their towns and of local government in their countries. IULA publications reworked into a single publication issued 5 times a year, “Local Government Throughout the World” - almost exclusively in English. Intermunicipal Technical Assistance Programme initiated by IULA with the cooperation of the United Nations and funding from the Ford Foundation.\n\n1962\n\n4th FMVJ-UTO Congress is held in Coventry, UK and the first African President is elected, Doudou Thiam (Minister of Foreign Affairs and Mayor of M’Backé, Senegal) along with Co-President Valdiodio N’Diaye (Minister of Finances, Senegal). Over 550 delegates participate in the Congress and introduce “triangular twinning”. Since the first Congress, visa refusals have been a problem, this is addressed during the Coventry Congress. Ms. H. Revers replaces Mr Arkema as Secretary General of IULA, the first woman to hold this position.\n\n1963\n\nThe IULA Jubilee Congress held in the former host city of the Union, Brussels. The Congress addresses ‘Local Governments in the Twentieth Century’ and celebrates fifty years of International Municipal Co-operation. A report is presented on “Problems of Maladjusted Youth.” This year also marks the creation of the Organisation of African Unity in Addis Ababa and the election of the first President, Léopold Sédar Senghor of Senegal.\n\n1964\n\nThe 5th FMVJ-UTO Congress is held in Warsaw, Poland, where Doudou Thiam is re-elected President. The Congress is a moment of reflection on peace and twinning in the framework of the development of cities. IULA participates in the seminars organized by United Nations on the subject “Central Services to Local Authorities”. The first was in New Delhi for Asian cities, and the second in Zaria (Nigeria) for African cities.\n\n1965\n\nThe 17th IULA Congress is held in Belgrade. 1965 marks twenty years since the creation of the United Nations and is designated International Co-operation Year by the General Assembly on 21 November 1963. Recommendations include the issue of commemorative stamps, a calendar of activities, publicity and exchanges of information on all aspects of international co-operation, and formation of National Committees for the International Co-operation Year.\n\n1966\n\nThe FMVJ-UTO Conference in Monastir, Tunisia, addresses, for the first time, the issue of cooperation between towns/cities through the direct collaboration of elected representatives and technical actors in twinned towns/cities. Concrete cooperation projects are organised at local level in the hope to sparking a ‘snowball effect’ of decentralized cooperation. The organization becomes better known as FMCU-UTO (Fédération Mondiale des Cités Unies). The FMCU-UTO obtains status A as non-governmental organization and the marks the beginning of direct representation of local authorities on the international cooperation scene.\n\n1967\n\nFMCU-UTO celebrates its 10th year during the 6th UTO Congress in Paris and president La Pira calls for summaries of the main achievements of this decade: decentralization, the right for citizens to move freely and the fight against racism, fascism, imperialism and discrimination are on the list. UTO members call for the creation of United Cities to complete the United Nations organization with specific funding for united city action. The IULA Congress is held for the first time in Asia, in Bangkok, with address by the city’s Mayor, Shaman Yuvapurna. March 15th, the Arab Towns Organization (ATO) is founded in the city of Kuwait with the aim of developing cooperation among Arab cities to promote their development, while preserving their Arab identity.\n\n1968\n\nReturning to the original principle of bilingualism, FMCU-UTO hold a conference in Royan, France on audio-visual methods of language learning for increased understanding among peoples. Some twenty countries are present from all corners of the globe, with a particularly high presence of African representatives.
