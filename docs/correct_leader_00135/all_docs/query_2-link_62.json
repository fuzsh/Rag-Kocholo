Despite the ousting of the president in Tunisia and low-level demonstrations becoming more common in Morocco, Tunis and Rabat have avoided many of the pitfalls seen in Libya and Egypt. Though domestic challenges remain, especially in Tunisia, both countries face greater threats from instability and militancy in neighboring countries than from within their own borders."
