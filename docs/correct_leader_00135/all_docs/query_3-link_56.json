        "text": "Tunisia's Essebsi, President at Last at 88\n\nVeteran politician Caid Beiji Essebsi, officially confirmed as Tunisia's new president Monday, had been the favorite to become the new head of state of the country that launched the Arab Spring.\n\nEssebsi -- now 88 -- held key posts under Habib Bourguiba, the father of Tunisian independence, but also under dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali who was deposed in 2011.\n\nAn anti-Islamist lawyer, Essebsi became prime minister after the revolt and organized parliamentary elections later that year.\n\nBorn on November 29, 1926, he denied before the presidential election -- the first time Tunisians had been able to freely choose their own head of state -- that his age was a hurdle to assuming the nation's highest office.\n\n\"I have the age that I have,\" he told AFP, describing youth as \"a state of mind\".\n\nHis detractors had accused him of seeking to restore the regime of Ben Ali, who clung to power for 23 years before fleeing, combining authoritarian rule with a degree of prosperity and stability for his people.\n\nBut Essebsi stood his ground, saying that former Ben Ali regime figures had the \"right\" to play a role in governing Tunisia alongside all political factions.\n\n\"We want a 21st century state, a progressive state,\" Essebsi said in a reference to Islamists.\n\n\"What separates us from those people is 14 centuries,\" he said, alluding to the birth of Islam in the 7th century.\n\nBorn in Sidi Bou Said, a northern suburb of Tunis, the founder and chairman of the Nidaa Tounes (Call of Tunisia) party studied law in Paris and began practicing in 1952.\n\nAfter independence from France in 1956, he became an adviser to Bourguiba, holding a number of key jobs under him and later under Ben Ali.\n\nOver the years, Essebsi was director general of the national police and interior minister. He later held the defense portfolio before becoming ambassador to France.\n\nAfter a subsequent posting as Tunisia's envoy to Germany, he was named foreign minister.\n\nHe also served in parliament, holding the speakership in 1990 and 1991.\n\nWhen Ben Ali skipped the country for exile in Saudi Arabia on January 14, 2011, prime minister Mohamed Ghannouchi declared himself president. But just a day later, parliament speaker Fouad Mebazaa took the reins of power.\n\nGhannouchi remained premier for another six weeks, before Mebazaa called on Essebsi to replace him and head an interim government until elections for a constituent assembly could be held.\n\nThose polls, in December 2011, were won by the Islamist party Ennahda, and new interim president Moncef Marzouki appointed Ennahda's Hamadi Jabali to replace Essebsi.\n\nIn October this year, Nidaa Tounes emerged as the winner in parliamentary elections, with Ennahda coming in a close second.\n\nMarzouki was Essebsi only real rival in the first round of presidential voting last month, when neither took the majority required to win outright.\n\nOn Monday the electoral commission announced after the previous day's runoff that Essebsi had secured 55.68 percent of votes cast in a vote seen as a landmark for the march of democracy in Tunisia.\n\nEssebsi has acknowledged that Ennahda is \"part of Tunisia's political life\", and his Nidaa Tounes does not rule out collaborating with it.\n\nHe is a shrewd politician whose communications style is to mix Koranic verses with old Tunisian proverbs.\n\nIt is also difficult to corner him.\n\nDuring the campaign he was taken to task for the way he responded to criticism by a female Islamist member of the constituent assembly.\n\n\"She's just a woman,\" he said, explaining later that he said that out of gallantry, not wanting to criticize a woman.\n\n\"No one can doubt the fact that I consider Tunisia's women to be the guarantors of the democratic process. And I am one of those who participated in the liberation of women by Bourguiba,\" who introduced the Arab world's most liberal legislation on women's rights.\n\nEssebsi is married and has two sons and two daughters."
