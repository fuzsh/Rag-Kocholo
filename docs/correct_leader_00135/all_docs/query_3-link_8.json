        "text": "Introduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground\n\nRivalry between French and Italian interests in Tunisia culminated in a French invasion in 1881 and the creation of a protectorate. Agitation for independence in the decades following World War I was finally successful in convincing the French to recognize Tunisia as an independent state in 1956. The country's first president, Habib BOURGUIBA, established a strict one-party state. He dominated the country for 31 years, repressing Islamic fundamentalism and establishing rights for women unmatched by any other Arab nation. In November 1987, BOURGUIBA was removed from office and replaced by Zine el Abidine BEN ALI in a bloodless coup. Street protests that began in Tunis in December 2010 over high unemployment, corruption, widespread poverty, and high food prices escalated in January 2011, culminating in rioting that led to hundreds of deaths. On 14 January 2011, the same day BEN ALI dismissed the government, he fled the country, and by late January 2011, a \"national unity government\" was formed. Elections for the new Constituent Assembly were held in late October 2011, and in December, it elected human rights activist Moncef MARZOUKI as interim president. The Assembly began drafting a new constitution in February 2012 and, after several iterations and a months-long political crisis that stalled the transition, ratified the document in January 2014. Parliamentary and presidential elections for a permanent government were held at the end of 2014. Beji CAID ESSEBSI was elected as the first president under the country's new constitution. Following ESSEBSI’s death in office in July 2019, Tunisia moved its scheduled presidential election forward two months and after two rounds of voting, Kais SAIED was sworn in as president in October 2019. Tunisia also held legislative elections on schedule in October 2019. SAIED's term, as well as that of Tunisia's 217-member parliament, expires in 2024.\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nNorthern Africa, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Algeria and Libya\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n34 00 N, 9 00 E\n\nMap references\n\nAfrica\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 163,610 sq km\n\nland: 155,360 sq km\n\nwater: 8,250 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 94\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly larger than Georgia\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 1,495 km\n\nborder countries (2): Algeria 1034 km, Libya 461 km\n\nCoastline\n\n1,148 km\n\nMaritime claims\n\nterritorial sea: 12nm\n\nexclusive economic zone: 12nm\n\ncontiguous zone: 24nm\n\nClimate\n\ntemperate in north with mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers; desert in south\n\nTerrain\n\nmountains in north; hot, dry central plain; semiarid south merges into the Sahara\n\nElevation\n\nmean elevation: 246 m\n\nlowest point: Shatt al Gharsah -17 m\n\nhighest point: Jebel ech Chambi 1,544 m\n\nNatural resources\n\npetroleum, phosphates, iron ore, lead, zinc, salt\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 64.8% (2011 est.)\n\narable land: 18.3% (2011 est.)/permanent crops: 15.4% (2011 est.)/permanent pasture: 31.1% (2011 est.)\n\nforest: 6.6% (2011 est.)\n\nother: 28.6% (2011 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n4,590 sq km (2012)\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nthe overwhelming majority of the population is located in the northern half of the country; the south remains largely underpopulated\n\nNatural hazards\n\nflooding; earthquakes; droughts\n\nEnvironment - current issues\n\ntoxic and hazardous waste disposal is ineffective and poses health risks; water pollution from raw sewage; limited natural freshwater resources; deforestation; overgrazing; soil erosion; desertification\n\nEnvironment - international agreements\n\nparty to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands\n\nsigned, but not ratified: Marine Life Conservation\n\nGeography - note\n\nstrategic location in central Mediterranean; Malta and Tunisia are discussing the commercial exploitation of the continental shelf between their countries, particularly for oil exploration\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\n11,516,189 (July 2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 78\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Tunisian(s)\n\nadjective: Tunisian\n\nEthnic groups\n\nArab 98%, European 1%, Jewish and other 1%\n\nLanguages\n\nArabic (official, one of the languages of commerce), French (commerce), Berber (Tamazight)\n\nnote: despite having no official status, French plays a major role in the country and is spoken by about two thirds of the population\n\nReligions\n\nMuslim (official; Sunni) 99.1%, other (includes Christian, Jewish, Shia Muslim, and Baha'i) 1%\n\nDemographic profile\n\nThe Tunisian Government took steps in the 1960s to decrease population growth and gender inequality in order to improve socioeconomic development. Through its introduction of a national family planning program (the first in Africa) and by raising the legal age of marriage, Tunisia rapidly reduced its total fertility rate from about 7 children per woman in 1960 to 2 today. Unlike many of its North African and Middle Eastern neighbors, Tunisia will soon be shifting from being a youth-bulge country to having a transitional age structure, characterized by lower fertility and mortality rates, a slower population growth rate, a rising median age, and a longer average life expectancy.Currently, the sizable young working-age population is straining Tunisia’s labor market and education and health care systems. Persistent high unemployment among Tunisia’s growing workforce, particularly its increasing number of university graduates and women, was a key factor in the uprisings that led to the overthrow of the BEN ALI regime in 2011. In the near term, Tunisia’s large number of jobless young, working-age adults; deficiencies in primary and secondary education; and the ongoing lack of job creation and skills mismatches could contribute to future unrest. In the longer term, a sustained low fertility rate will shrink future youth cohorts and alleviate demographic pressure on Tunisia’s labor market, but employment and education hurdles will still need to be addressed.Tunisia has a history of labor emigration. In the 1960s, workers migrated to European countries to escape poor economic conditions and to fill Europe’s need for low-skilled labor in construction and manufacturing. The Tunisian Government signed bilateral labor agreements with France, Germany, Belgium, Hungary, and the Netherlands, with the expectation that Tunisian workers would eventually return home. At the same time, growing numbers of Tunisians headed to Libya, often illegally, to work in the expanding oil industry. In the mid-1970s, with European countries beginning to restrict immigration and Tunisian-Libyan tensions brewing, Tunisian economic migrants turned toward the Gulf countries. After mass expulsions from Libya in 1983, Tunisian migrants increasingly sought family reunification in Europe or moved illegally to southern Europe, while Tunisia itself developed into a transit point for sub-Saharan migrants heading to Europe.Following the ousting of BEN ALI in 2011, the illegal migration of unemployed Tunisian youths to Italy and onward to France soared into the tens of thousands. Thousands more Tunisian and foreign workers escaping civil war in Libya flooded into Tunisia and joined the exodus. A readmission agreement signed by Italy and Tunisia in April 2011 helped stem the outflow, leaving Tunisia and international organizations to repatriate, resettle, or accommodate some 1 million Libyans and third-country nationals.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 25.25%(male 1,502,655 /female 1,405,310)\n\n15-24 years: 13.53%(male 787,178 /female 770,929)\n\n25-54 years: 43.25%(male 2,426,011 /female 2,554,253)\n\n55-64 years: 9.75%(male 560,233 /female 562,436)\n\n65 years and over: 8.22%(male 448,784 /female 498,400) (2018 est.)\n\npopulation pyramid:\n\nDependency ratios\n\ntotal dependency ratio: 45.6 (2015 est.)\n\nyouth dependency ratio: 34.5 (2015 est.)\n\nelderly dependency ratio: 11.1 (2015 est.)\n\npotential support ratio: 9 (2015 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 32 years (2018 est.)\n\nmale: 31.3 years\n\nfemale: 32.5 years\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 106\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n0.95% (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 116\n\nBirth rate\n\n17.4 births/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 103\n\nDeath rate\n\n6.4 deaths/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 148\n\nNet migration rate\n\n-1.6 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 154\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nthe overwhelming majority of the population is located in the northern half of the country;

After the revolution and a series of terrorist attacks, including on the country’s tourism sector, barriers to economic inclusion continued to add to slow economic growth and high unemployment.Following an ill-fated experiment with socialist economic policies in the 1960s, Tunisia focused on bolstering exports, foreign investment, and tourism, all of which have become central to the country's economy. Key exports now include textiles and apparel, food products, petroleum products, chemicals, and phosphates, with about 80% of exports bound for Tunisia's main economic partner, the EU. Tunisia's strategy, coupled with investments in education and infrastructure, fueled decades of 4-5% annual GDP growth and improved living standards. Former President Zine el Abidine BEN ALI (1987-2011) continued these policies, but as his reign wore on cronyism and corruption stymied economic performance, unemployment rose, and the informal economy grew. Tunisia’s economy became less and less inclusive. These grievances contributed to the January 2011 overthrow of BEN ALI, further depressing Tunisia's economy as tourism and investment declined sharply.Tunisia’s government remains under pressure to boost economic growth quickly to mitigate chronic socio-economic challenges, especially high levels of youth unemployment, which has persisted since the 2011 revolution. Successive terrorist attacks against the tourism sector and worker strikes in the phosphate sector, which combined account for nearly 15% of GDP, slowed growth from 2015 to 2017. Tunis is seeking increased foreign investment and working with the IMF through an Extended Fund Facility agreement to fix fiscal deficiencies.\n\nGDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$137.7 billion (2017 est.)\n\n$135 billion (2016 est.)\n\n$133.5 billion (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 78\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$39.96 billion (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - real growth rate\n\n2% (2017 est.)\n\n1.1% (2016 est.)\n\n1.2% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 155\n\nGDP - per capita (PPP)\n\n$11,900 (2017 est.)\n\n$11,800 (2016 est.)\n\n$11,800 (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 131\n\nGross national saving\n\n12% of GDP (2017 est.)\n\n13.4% of GDP (2016 est.)\n\n12.5% of GDP (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 152\n\nGDP - composition, by end use\n\nhousehold consumption: 71.7% (2017 est.)\n\ngovernment consumption: 20.8% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in fixed capital: 19.4% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in inventories: 0% (2017 est.)\n\nexports of goods and services: 43.2% (2017 est.)\n\nimports of goods and services: -55.2% (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - composition, by sector of origin\n\nagriculture: 10.1% (2017 est.)\n\nindustry: 26.2% (2017 est.)\n\nservices: 63.8% (2017 est.)\n\nAgriculture - products\n\nolives, olive oil, grain, tomatoes, citrus fruit, sugar beets, dates, almonds;
