        "text": "When is Tunisian Independence Day?\n\nThis national holiday is celebrated on March 20th each year.\n\nThe holiday was established to celebrate the anniversary of Tunisia's independence from France on March 20th 1956 and is Tunisia's national holiday.\n\nHistory of Tunisian Independence Day\n\nFollowing a period of rule by the Ottoman Empire, Tunisia came under French control in 1881 and became a French protectorate in 1883.\n\nThe movement for independence had begun in 1920 with the creation of the political party, Destour. In 1934, the fervour for independence was increased with the formation of a new party called Neo Destour, led by Habib Bourguiba.\n\nIn the 1940s, the struggle for independence intensified with widespread protests and strikes. Threatened by this new surge in nationalism, Neo Destour was banned and Bourguiba was sent to prison in France. During World War II, Bourguiba ended up in Italian hands, and the Nazis wanted him to support their military efforts in Northern Africa. Bourguiba refused and was only released from prison at the end of the war.\n\nReturning to Tunisia, Bourguiba proposed a gradual movement to independence, which had widespread support amongst Tunisians. Frustrated by the slow progress, Neo Destour started a campaign of armed resistance in 1952. In 1954, the new French Prime Minister began a policy of withdrawal from French colonies to reduce the violence that was occurring in several colonies including Tunisia.\n\nNegotiations for full independence continued, and on March 20th, 1956, the French government agreed to Tunisia’s demands for independence, creating the Kingdom of Tunisia. The Tunisian flag was raised, and Bourguiba gave a speech announcing the country’s independence.\n\nOn June 25th 1957, Tunisia became a republic with Habib Bourguiba as its first president.\n\nHow is Tunisian Independence Day Celebrated?\n\nSince independence, March 20th has been celebrated as Tunisia National Day. The day is marked by national celebrations, parades, and fireworks. Wreath-laying ceremonies take place to honour those who fought for the country's independence. Citizens decorate streets, cars, and buildings with the Tunisian flag and the national colours of red and white. It is a day for Tunisians to reflect on their country’s history, celebrate their independence, and renew their commitment to building a strong and prosperous nation."
