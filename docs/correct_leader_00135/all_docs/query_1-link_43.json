        "text": "In this compact country there are beautiful beaches, historic medinas, Roman ruins, mountain hiking and camel rides, as well as a wide range of restaurants, cafes and bars. There are even many Star War filming locations here. In fact, the desert planet Tatooine name comes from the Tunisian city of Tataouine.\n\nThe country balances traditional Islamic culture with modern sensibilities and is well known for its hospitality. Since its independence from France in 1956, Tunisia has been a haven for tourists, especially French and Italian. However, three events have reduced it materially. In 2010, political instability during the Arab Spring ousted longtime dictator Ben Ali. In 2015, the Islamic State attacked tourists in two separate incidents. Then in 2020, Covid started and depressed tourism worldwide. As a result, when we visited this remarkable country it was uncrowded and inexpensive.\n\nGood thing we went when we did, as they were in the process of moving back to Europe. In fact, Ada left two days before we did and Marcello and Alessandro were staying just a few more weeks.\n\nAs mentioned, this is a new country for me. However, I decided to make my goal the number of UN member states which is 193, not 197 which included Kosovo, Palestine, the Vatican and Taiwan. Using the UN member states, this is my 112th country.\n\nWe drove several hours on many days because the distances took longer than expected and we didn’t always take the most direct route. In some places, our SIM card didn’t have service and we couldn’t access Google maps, so we had to ask for directions. We should’ve downloaded a map from maps.me, so we could’ve known where we were (you can access GPS even if you do not have cell service).\n\nThe many speed bumps on the roads and highways were a challenge. Often they were hard to see, not well marked and in places you wouldn’t expect. As an alternative, there are many tours available which are efficient in seeing a broad stretch of the country.\n\nHere’s a map of the places we went.\n\nTunis is the largest city and the capital of Tunisia. It’s located on the Lake of Tunis which is connected to the Gulf of Tunis and the Mediterranean Sea by a large canal. The sprawling metropolitan area is home to about 2.7 million people and is often referred to as “Grand Tunis”.\n\nTunis started as a Berber settlement and has always been a large trading hub because of its proximity to the Mediterranean. From the 12th to the 16th century, Tunis was one the wealthiest cities in the Islamic world.\n\nThe Medina of Tunis is the historic center of the city with many buildings existing since the 7th century. In 1979, it was one of the first cities to be designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Medina area contains hundreds of palaces, mosques, mausoleums, madrasas and fountains but the main joy for me was walking among the throng of people in the covered shopping area.\n\nThere’s a maze of pedestrian alleys and it’s not a bad idea to hire someone to guide you through but it’s not absolutely necessary. More likely someone will approach you, tell you about something you should see (e.g., an art exhibition), then start taking you to carpet, perfume and other shops where they no doubt get a commission if you buy something. Then at the end, you will have to haggle over a tip.\n\nThe streets had a charm with their deteriorating facades and the repairs to them.\n\nThe city of Carthage started as a Phoenician colony and developed into a Punic empire. The Punic people were the western branch of Phoenicians, a Semitic people from current-day Lebanon. It became one the wealthiest states in the first millennium BC and an important commercial center in the Mediterranean. Eventually it expanded into a nation that hugged the coast of the Maghreb and occupied part of the Iberian peninsula.\n\nCarthage engaged in three long wars with Rome (Hannibal crossed the Alps with elephants in the second one) known as the Punic Wars. Unfortunately for Carthage, they lost all of them. After the third Punic war in 146 BC, the Romans captured and burnt the city, killed the men and enslaved the women and children. Various texts claimed that the Roman plowed over the destroyed city and spread salt in the soil so nothing could grow. A century later, the Romans rebuilt Carthage as a Roman city.\n\nWithin the sprawling archaeological site, the ruins reflect the eras of the Carthaginian, Romans, Vandals, early Christians and Arabs. We arrived after 7pm and it was closed. I’m not too disappointed, as the history is the important part to me and few structures are from pre-Roman Carthage. In fact, Kerkouane (Kerkuane) on the Cap Bon peninsula (two hour drive from Tunis) is the only surviving example of a Punic settlement.\n\nPerhaps on our first day in Tunis, we should’ve taken a half-day tour of the Carthage archeological site and the medina in order to efficiently see them and not miss major attractions. Afterwards, we could’ve walked the streets of the medina to sample street life.\n\nThe Amphitheatre of El Jem is in the city of the same name, formally the Roman city of Thysdrus. It seated about 35,000 spectators with only the Colosseum in Rome (seating about 50,000) and the theater of Capua (seating about 60,000) outnumbering it.\n\nLike other Roman amphitheaters/coliseums, it was famously used for gladiator exhibitions and small chariot races. The amphitheater remained whole until the 17th century when stones from the structure were taken to build the town of El Jem and transported to Kairouan for the construction of the Great Mosque. The Amphitheatre of El Jem is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nWe arrived after it was closed, but persuaded a guard to let us in. A highlight of our trip was experiencing the dramatic light of sunset.\n\nMatmata is famous for its “troglodyte” or cave housing. Each home buried into a hill has rooms connected through passageways. About 1,200 of the homes have been preserved and some are still used by locals.\n\nThe Hotel Sidi Driss in Matmata was used in 1976 as a filming location in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, for the home of Luke Skywalker, his Aunt Beru Lars and Uncle Owen Lars on the planet Tatooine.\n\nWe stayed in the Au Trait d’Union Tijma Matmata Hotel cave hotel for a night, so we felt the vibes of living in such a place.\n\nWe went to Tataouine because George Lucas used this name for his desert planet in Star Wars, where Luke was raised on the Lars farm and outlaws drank and fought in the Mos Eisley bar. In Star Wars, the name is spelled Tatooine.\n\nI was expecting Star Wars souvenirs and paraphernalia everywhere. Quite the opposite, we saw no trace of the franchise and it’s not a tourist destination. We walked some of the streets with vegetable and fruit stands, but many were closed during the mid-afternoon break. On the hill outside of the city, “Welcome to Tataouine” was written in Arabic.\n\nKsar Ghilane, the southernmost oasis in Tunisia, is considered one of the gateways to the Tunisian Sahara desert. It used to be a stopping place for nomadic Berber tribes, but more recently around fifty tribes have settled there and now call it home. The oasis was created by nearby hot springs that feed water into the settlement and create thermal pools that are relaxing to soak in.\n\nWe were lucky enough to spend the night glamping under luxurious, air-conditioned tents at Hotel Pansy, one of the three campsites open to visitors.\n\nTozeur is an excellent place to use as a base for exploring oases, hot springs, small villages and a Star Wars filming location, as well as for arid hiking, riding an antique train and sightseeing dramatic landscapes. The City of Tozeur is well known for its architecture and palm trees.\n\nTozeur is famous for its yellow/brownish brickwork, often with geometric designs, which is the style of most buildings in the Ouled el Hadef (Old City or Medina). This area is almost unchanged over the centuries and some of the houses are from the 14th century.\n\nTozeur is one of the best places in Tunisia for door spotting. Each door often has two or three door knockers. There are multiple explanations of what the number and placement mean. One is the third knocker is added to the door when the family has its first child or son. Another explanation is the right knocker is for the men of the house, the left for the women and the lower for the children. Each knocker gives a different sound, the male knocker the deepest.\n\nSbeitla is a small town in west-central Tunisia, known for the Sufetula Roman archaeological park possessing the best-preserved temples in Tunisia. Sufetula originally was a nomadic Berber settlement but was taken over by the Romans and annexed as a province in 67 AD. The province was successful through its olive trade but started to crumble when it was invaded by Vandals at the end of the Western Roman Empire. As a result, there are dedications and tributes inside temples to different Vandal gods. Sufetula was later taken over by the Byzantines before it eventually was conquered by Arabs.\n\nWe marveled at the fortified dwellings, oil presses, baths, theaters and temples. The highlight was the Capitolium."
