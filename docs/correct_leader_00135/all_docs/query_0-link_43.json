        "text": "As holders of the office of Bey the Husaynid Dynasty effectively ruled Tunisia as sovereigns from 1705 to 1881; thereafter they continued to merely reign until 1957. In Ottoman theory perhaps until 1881 the Bey of Tunis remained a vassal of the Ottoman Empire (the Friday prayer was pronounced in the name of the Ottoman Sultan, money was coined in his honor, and an annual ambassador once brought gifts to Constantinople) but for centuries the Ottomans were not able to depend on, or exact, the obedience of the Tunisian Bey. In 1881 the French created their protectorate which lasted until 1956. During this period the beylical institution was retained; the Husaynid Bey served as titular head of state but it was the French who actually ruled the country. After achieving its full independence Tunisia declared itself a republic in 1957; the beylical office was terminated and the Husaynid dynasty came to an end.\n\nSix stripes white and red\n\nCornelisz Danckertsz, 1700 ca [1]\n\nIn a decree of Husayn Bey of 20.10.1827 ratified in 1831, a new flag was adopted. No information about the decree or ratification was given to the Ottoman sultan, the de jure suzerain of the bey.\n\nThe new flag was red, charged with a white oval bearing a red crescent-and-star, the star being of eight points.\n\nIt is an adaptation of the Ottoman man-of-war flag of the time and was also flown as a man-of-war flag.\n\nAt the same time the merchant flag became all red.\n\nThe oldest picture of the achievement shows arms with a banner charged with a dhul-fakar or split-bladed sword, surround by a garland and a trophy of six post-1831 merchant flags. In base is an emblem of a crescent-and-star. [3]\n\nA second version shows the same arms, crested with the crescent and star, the trophy augmented with halberds, bayoneted guns and two cannon in saltire. Pending therefrom the jewel of an Order.\n\nAnother picture of the achievement is on a bookplate dated 1847 and dedicated to Ahmad I Bey. The bookplate was sold at an auction in Versailles at the beginning of the 20th century and had belonged to a Tunisian Navy officer. [4] It shows:\n\nThe flags are of three stripes now, probably red-green-red and decorated with verses (from the Quran?) in arab script. Pending from the cannon in saltire is the jewel of the Order of Nishan al-Iftikhar, founded by Mustapha Pasha Bey in 1835.\n\nA younger version is documented on the frontispiece of a book dated 1858: [5]\n\nThis shows the banner on the arms of four stripes, the shield within a golden bordure surrounded by a garland of laurel and palm-leaves, the jewel of the order of Nishan al-Ifthikar replaced by the jewel of the order of the Order of the Blood (Nishan ud-dam), founded by Ahmad I Pasha Bey in 1839.\n\nOf this version a coloured plaque is known [6]:\n\nA new version is above the throne in the Bardo Palace and probably dates from 1861 [7]:\n\nAfter the establishment of the French Protectorate in 1881 the national emblem of the crescent-and-star was maintained\n\nThe national emblem was the centerpiece of the ensign and merchant flag and of the national arms, which was of the same blason as the flag. that is: Red, a white disc charged with a red crescent-and-star.\n\nAt the same time the ancient man-of-war flag and the merchent flag were abolished.\n\nAn augmented version of the national emblem showed the crescent-and-star surrounded by a garland of laurel and oak.\n\nThis version could also be found on the thrones in the Main Hall and the Court of Justice, the garland supported by two flags in saltire.\n\nThrone in the Main Hall of the Bardo Palace, 1899\n\nshowing the national emblem and the national achievement of crescent-and-star, garland and flags.\n\nSome other versions of the larger achievement are known from this era but in the end the achievement of 1861 was used again.\n\nAs Tunisia was a (nominal) vassal of the Porte from 1574 until 1881, its army was de jure a part of the Ottoman Army. This army had as its greater banner a large red flag charged with the dhul fakar and several crescent-and-stars, besides verses from the Quran.\n\nThe Tunisian beys were the commanders of the Tunisian troops and were invested with high Ottoman military ranks. At the end of the 18th century the beys held the rank of Amir al Umara (Major General) but the 9th and 10th Beys were promoted to the rank of Ferik (Lieutenant General). In 1840 the 11th bey was promoted to the rank of Müşir i Mufakham (Fieldmarshal) which was the highest rank in the Ottoman Army. Such a position was equal to the rank of Admiral of the Fleet of which the mark of distinction was a red flag charged with a white dhul fakar. The same rank was held by his successors until 1882. [13]\n\nThe Beylical Banner\n\nIt is, therefore, likely that the flag with the dhul fakar on the first beylical arms was adopted in 1840.\n\nThe development of the achievement, as described above, also shows the development of the beylical banner in the course of time. At first it a green, like the banner of Khayr al-Din, the captan-pasha of Algiers at the beginning of the 16th century. Later versions show striped banners, first with narrow (red) borders and later a banner striped of four breadths red and green, charged with the dhul fakar over all.\n\nThe famous multi-striped banner may have been designed even before the establishment of the Protectorate but no dated examples of such a flag from the Ottoman era have been found. Nor real banners seem to have been preserved.\n\nAn early representation: 7 stripes\n\nThe Achievement of the Beylical Armed Forces\n\nFrom about the same time, that is to say from the time of Husayn Bey who introduced the red crescent increscent and star, is the achievement of the armed forces above the external door of the Bardo Palace. This shows a red shield placed on a trophy of arms, flags and cannon in saltire. If the present colours are correct we may suppose that the flags were the ensigns of the army and the navy, the red colour of the shield being the colour of the armed forces as an entity."
