Cet article analyse les interactions entre les changements politiques internes de la Tunisie, mis en miroir avec le cas de l’Espagne post-franquiste, et les débats concernant une éventuelle normalisation avec Israël.

        "text": "1A lot of attention has been given to Egypt’s relationship with Israel after Mubarak’s fall and the crisis affecting the first Arab state to have signed a peace treaty with Israel, and very little to the Tunisian case. Tunisia, though it is not directly involved with Middle Eastern security issues related to Israel, does offer a fascinating case study regarding the Arab world approach towards Israel in the aftermath of the Arab Awakening.\n\n2This paper intends to assess the impacts of this regional turmoil on the Tunisian debate on normalization with Israel. To this end, it adopts a comparative approach by first exposing relevant precedents and analysing the factors that enabled a normalization of relations with Israel, whether to mark a political independence with the USSR in the case of some of its former satellites, or due to the influence of the EU in an integration process as in the case of Spain, or as for Egypt and Jordan, in the context of a peace treaty. This paper questions the influence of the democratization factor in the Tunisian debate in the context of the Arab Awakening and whether or not it enables a normalization of relations with Israel. It also take into account the role of the EU in this process in the framework of the EU-Tunisian partnership.\n\n3As argued by the different contributors of this volume, Israel has not been at the heart of the political and social dynamics leading masses of people to take the streets in Tunisia, Yemen, Syria, Libya and Egypt.\n\n4Yet, Israel’s diplomatic history, marked by long periods of isolation, offers a wide diversity of cases to study the factors leading to a process of establishment or reestablishment of full relations and the Arab Awakening provides a very interesting context in which reassessing them.\n\nRelevant precedents of normalization of relations with Israel\n\nRelations of Post-Soviet countries with Israel : the political break factor\n\n5The Soviet Union and its satellite states had severed all ties with Israel after 1967 Six Day War. The USSR strongly supported Egypt and Syria in their military confrontation with the Jewish state. Romania remained the only exception within the socialist block in maintaining diplomatic relations with Israel. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War brought a complete change. During the processes of democratization of eastern and central Europe at the late 1980’s -early 1990’s, all these states re-established full diplomatic relations with Israel. The Federation of Russia and all the eastern and central European states took the same path and normalized their relations with Israel. Looking at the chronology of these evolutions, we see that the recognition of Israel and the establishment of a variety of partnerships with were not the results of outside pressures.\n\n6These moves took place many years before the enlargement of NATO and then the EU. For example, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary had restored diplomatic relations with Israel since 1989-1990 and became members of NATO in 1999 and the EU in 2004.\n\n7They followed a regional dynamic that was not limited to newly independent post-communist countries eager to join political and military alliances, as the study of the relations between Israel and the Federation of Russia shows.\n\nThe Spanish scenario: the influence of the integration in the EU\n\n12This paper questions whether a similar scenario could apply to post-2011 Tunisia. Of course it does not intend to draw a full analogy with the Spanish scenario as Tunisia is not a candidate country to the EU. Yet, Tunisia has presented itself since its independence as a bridge between the Arab world and Europe. Moreover, it is the first Mediterranean country to sign an Association Agreement with the EU in 1995. Thus, it does provide an interesting case study when it comes to the debates and factors dealing with the normalisation of the relations between the Arab world and the State of Israel.\n\nThe Egyptian/Jordan scenario: the necessity of peace treaties\n\n13Before examining the case of Tunisia, it is necessary to recall briefly the process leading two Israel’s Arab neighbours, Egypt and Jordan, to conclude peace treaties with it.\n\n14As Tunisia, they are Arab states, members of the Arab league. The history of their relations with Israel is one of several deadly wars then the signature of peace treaties.\n\n15Egypt, the most populated Arab state, fought four wars against Israel in a quarter of a century: 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973. Then, in November 1977, in a speech before the People’s Assembly, Egyptian President Anwar-al Sadat announced that he was ready to go anywhere, including the Israeli Knesset, to achieve peace in the region. His journey to Jerusalem marked the history of the Middle-East. In what context did this normalization between two arch-enemies take place?\n\n17The first peace treaty signed between Israel and an Arab state survived Sadat’s assassination (1981), the invasion of Lebanon (1982) and the two Palestinian intifadas (1987 and 2000). But the relationship between the two countries is a cold peace with strong oppositions from cultural and intellectual circles to normalization.\n\n20Egypt and Jordan share the same top-down decision making process. The strategic choice to recognize Israel came from the top of the regime and very little space was left in the public sphere for debating and choosing the degree of the relation with Israel. In other words, opposition to the peace treaty with Israel meant an opposition to the regime.\n\nOngoing reflexion on the Tunisian debate: Could democracy be a factor enabling future normalization?\n\nThe Tunisian case compared to the Spanish scenario\n\n21Three decades after the democratic transition in Southern Europe and its implications in the relations between Europe and Israel, Tunisia offers a fascinating comparative case.\n\n22More than 2,000 kilometers separate Tunisia from Israel. Independent from France since 1956, it is not a strategic player in Middle-East politics. As the quote attributed to Henry Kissinger goes, “You can’t make war in the Middle East without Egypt and you can’t make peace without Syria”. But that does not automatically disconnect the Maghreb from the Palestinian question. Tunisia did not have the same attitude as Libya and Algeria, which saw themselves as champions of Arab nationalism, as both condemned the Camp David accords and gave political and material support to Palestinian armed groups. By contrast, Tunisia developed an original diplomatic approach towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n27Now, Tunisia has been the starting point of the Arab spring. It is there than for the first time the massive mobilization of the population of an Arab state lead to the fall and departure of an authoritarian leader. Diplomats, journalists and researchers have focused on the major internal dynamics within the Tunisian society since 2011: emergence of political parties, challenges of building new institutions, the role of religion in the public sphere, etc. But, as emphasized in this paper, the Tunisian public opinion also addressed international questions. The most urgent issues concerned immediate challenges at the border of Tunisia, such as a humanitarian and security crisis during and following the Libyan civil war, the NATO military intervention and the fall of Khadaffi’s regime. The relationship with France, the former colonial ruler, was also a sensitive issue, as illustrated by the demonstrations leading to the early departure of Boris Bouillon, the French ambassador in Tunis from February 2011 to August 2012. To what extend has the Palestinian question become an issue in the post-Ben Ali Tunisia?\n\n30In the Tunisian case, the absence of hostile slogans against Israel during the demonstrations and its different political outcomes compared to the Islamic revolution of Iran, did not mean the absence of support to Palestinians.\n\nPalestine as a lasting mobilizing cause in Tunisia\n\n31The National Constituent Assembly was elected on October 23, 2011, with a majority of Ennahda, the Islamic party, members. Its main role was to draft and adopt a new constitution.\n\n36Another example on how heavily the Palestinian question resonates in Tunisia was indirectly highlighted by Choukri Belaïd’s death. Shot in the streets of Tunis in February 2013, the lawyer was a fierce secular opponent of the party Enahada but also the head of the “anti-normalization” committee, a group devoted to the prevention of any contact between Tunisia and Israel. Belaïd’s position shows the alliance between the Islamists and the Arab nationalist stream, fiercely opposed on all issues but on Israel.\n\nConclusion\n\n38The Tunisian situation towards Israel is unique. This Arab and Muslim country located far geographically from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, is conserving a small Jewish community while showing a strong sense of solidarity towards the Palestinian cause. It is the only country of the ‘Arab revolutions’ that has been continuing successfully to implement a democratic and pluralist political agenda. As such, this case permits to rethink the study of the relations of the Arab world with Israel as well as the foreign policy of the EU. At the time of writing (Spring 2014), the debate on the degree of normalisation with Israel is going on in Tunisia. It focuses on the authorization or not for Israelis to visit the country. A majority seems to favour a formula which authorizes the entrance of Israeli tourists, for the sake of economic interests, yet without seeking to establish any relation at the official level with Israel.\n\n39If this were the case, for the first time, an Arab society would have decided the nature of its relation with Israel following an internal debate. As seen bellow, any attempt aiming at preventing future changes in the relation with Israel have been suppressed from the Constitution. The repetition of the Spanish scenario, in which total normalization results from a European collective pressure, does not seem realistic in this context.\n\n40Regarding the EU’s relative silence on this issue, two hypothesis can be put forward as avenues for future research. The first would be that Europe is aware of its limited power outside of its frontiers and does not believe that it could force Tunisia to adopt a policy of diplomatic normalization with Israel while the Palestinian question remains unsolved. The second one concerns the evolution of the EU-Israel partnership in the light of the crisis of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Brussels has shown a growing dissatisfaction towards Israel’s settlement policy in the West Bank by issuing in summer 2013 new guidelines concerning Israeli entities and their activities in the occupied territories."
