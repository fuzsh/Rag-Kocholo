What a beautiful family home this is, on a large plot of land, in a unique location!

One of the most beautiful places in the ‘Waterland’ housing estate is where you will find this superbly maintained semi-detached, 5-bedroomed villa on a 376 m2 plot of freehold land, with a large garage, a long, sunny garden with several little terraces, and off-road parking.

Location and surroundings:

The ideal location for sports facilities (Westerpark Golf Club, tennis courts, football field and basketball court) playgrounds, junior and senior high schools (including ‘s-Gravendreef, The British School, etc.), the RandstadRail metro line, public transport, and several major highways: A4, A12 and the A-13. The property is very nearby the Nieuwe Driemanspolder nature reserve.

The lay-out and measurements can be found on the floor plan, but here is a brief summary:

Ground floor

Front garden and nice, big drive with plenty of space for at least five cars, so you and your guests will have plenty of room to park within the grounds. Just how nice is that?!

The entrance to the property is from the side of the house. You enter a light, spacious hall with parquet flooring, a cupboard for coats, the meter cupboard and a modern cloakroom with a WC with a concealed cistern and a hand basin.

The living room (approx. 6.92 x 5.75) with an annexed dining room (approx. 3.50 x 3.32) and an annexed, open-plan, modern kitchen (approx. 3.32 x 3.32), all of which have beautiful parquet flooring, a cosy, open gas fireplace (made by Houweling, which can easily be converted to a log burning fire), lots of natural light and a grand pantry.

The kitchen is set out in an L-shape and fitted with all imaginable equipment and appliances.

Electric blind to the rear. Awnings at the front and side of the house.

The secluded, beautifully landscaped back garden (approx. 11.00 x 6.35) is accessed via French doors and enjoys the sun almost the whole day long. There are several, nicely designed terraces and rear access.

The large garage (approx. 7.26 x 3.33) is currently used as a hobby and storage room (because there is enough space for parking in the driveway) but, of course, this space can also be used to park your car.
