It is located on the southern edge of the Peace River Country (part of the Peace Region or simply \"The Peace\", as is often locally known, which encompasses much of northwestern Alberta and northeastern British Columbia). The city is surrounded by Grande Prairie County. The city of Grande Prairie is one of Canada's fastest growing cities and as of its 2007 civic census, its population was 50,227, up 6.9% from the Canada 2006 Census figure of 47,076. As of 2006, the population of the Grande Prairie Census Agglomeration was at 71,868[3] (The census agglomeration has now been expanded to cover the entire County of Grande Prairie). It is currently Alberta's 7th largest incorporated city by population. Grande Prairie is the largest city between Edmonton and Fairbanks, Alaska along the Highway 43, Alaska and a portion of the Richardson Highway (Alaska) routes. It lies about 460 km (286 mi) and 2,480 km (1,541 mi) from each city respectively.\n\nThe city has adopted the endangered Trumpeter swan as an official symbol because it is near the migration route and summer nesting grounds of this large and graceful swan. For that reason, Grande Prairie is sometimes nicknamed the \"Swan City\".\n\nInteresting fact that wasn't on there: Our population is listed on the census as around 84,000. Due to our huge Oil and Gas industry, our population is actually somewhere around 95,000. People come in from other parts of the country, especially Newfoundland, to work here, while they officially live elsewhere. For the last several years, our average rent has gone up about 30% each year, while the available housing goes down.\n\nMurfreesboro is a city in Rutherford County, Tennessee, United States. According to the 2007 census estimate the city had a total population of 92,559. It is the county seat of Rutherford CountyGR6. The center of population of Tennessee is located in Murfreesboro.[2]\n\nAlthough Murfreesboro is sometimes considered a suburb or exurb of Nashville, Tennessee, it is far enough away [about 35 mi (56 km)] and has a large enough population to maintain a separate identity from its larger neighbor. It is one of the fastest growing cities in the country, with a population growth from 46,000 to 69,000 between 1990 and 2000, a change of 66%. The city is also home to Middle Tennessee State University, the largest undergraduate university in the state of Tennessee, with a current undergraduate population of 22,554.\n\nIn 2006, Murfreesboro was ranked by Money as the 84th best place to live in the United States, out of 745 cities with a population over 50,000.\n\nIn 1818, Murfreesboro became the capital of Tennessee until 1826, when Nashville became the state capital.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 39.2 square miles\n\nMurfreesboro is the geographic center of the state of Tennessee\n\nThe racial makeup of the city was 79.85% White, 13.89% African American, 0.28% Native American, 2.69% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 1.88% from other races, and 1.38% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3.53% of the population.\n\nThe median income for a household in the city was US$39,652, and the median income for a family was US$55,845. Males had a median income of US$42,872 versus US$30,621 for females\n\nFor Nashville (35 miles away)\n\nThe population of Nashville-Davidson County stood at 607,413 as of 2005,[1][2] according to United States Census Bureau estimates. The 2005 population of the entire 13-county Nashville Metropolitan Statistical Area was 1,498,836\n\nHome To:\n\nCountry Music - Grand Ole Opry\n\nTennessee Titans NFL\n\nNashville Predators NHL\n\nNashville Sounds AAA (farm team for Milwaukee Brewers)\n\nand we have like 30 different colleges/universities... know as \"Athens of the South\" due to our higher education\n\nWe even have our own \"Parthenon\" - full scale identical model to the one found in Greece.\n\nEducation:\n\nNashville is often labeled the \"Athens of the South\" due to the many colleges and universities in the city and metropolitan area. These colleges and universities in Nashville include American Baptist College, Aquinas College, The Art Institute of Tennessee- Nashville, Belmont University, Draughons Junior College, Fisk University, Free Will Baptist Bible College, Gupton College, Lipscomb University, Meharry Medical College, Nashville School of Law, Nashville Auto Diesel College, Nashville State Community College, Strayer University, Tennessee State University, Trevecca Nazarene University, University of Phoenix, Vanderbilt University, and Watkins College of Art and Design.\n\nWithin 30 miles (50 km) of Nashville in Murfreesboro is Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU), a full-sized public university with Tennessee's largest undergraduate population. Enrollment in post-secondary education in the city is around 43,000. Within the Nashville Metropolitan Statistical Area which includes MTSU, Cumberland University (Lebanon), Volunteer State Community College (Gallatin), and O'More College of Design (Franklin) total enrollment exceeds 74,000. Within a 40 mile (65 km) radius are Austin Peay State University (Clarksville) and Columbia State Community College (Columbia), enrolling an additional 13,600.\n\nMontreal, or MontrÃÂ©al in French, (pronounced /ÃÅmÃ¯Â¿Â½'ÃÆÃÂ¾eÃËal/ (helpÃÂ·info) in Quebec French, pronounced /ÃÅmÃÅntriÃÂÃËÃ¯Â¿Â½'ÃÂl/ (helpÃÂ·info) in Canadian English, and /ÃÅmÃ¯Â¿Â½\"ÃÆÃâ¬eÃËal/ (helpÃÂ·info) in European French) is the second-largest city in Canada and the largest city in the province of Quebec. Originally called Ville-Marie ('City of Mary'), some historians think the city takes its present name from the Mont RÃÂ©al (as it was pronounced in Middle French [5], or Mont Royal / Mount Royal in present French), the three-head hill at the heart of the city, whose name was also initially given to the island on which the city stands.\n\nFormerly the largest city in Canada, it is now known as the second largest French-speaking city in the world.[6] As of the 2006 Canadian Census, 1,620,693 people resided in the city of Montreal proper.[1] The population of the Montreal Census Metropolitan Area (also known as Greater Montreal Area) was 3,635,571 at the same 2006 census. In the census metropolitan area, French is the language most spoken at home by 70.5% of the population (as of 2006 census).[7] In 2007, Montreal was ranked as the 10th cleanest city in the world.[8] Montreal is ranked as a \"gamma\" or \"minor world city\" by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network (GaWC).\n\nThere is alot of stuff on Montreal.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal"
