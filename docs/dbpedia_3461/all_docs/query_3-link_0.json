        "text": "In the UK there are quite a few examples of small and medium sized towns with railway stations on seperate lines with no direct link between them. Examples of this include Hertford (East and North), St Albans (Abbey and City), Windsor (Riverside and Central). There used to be a lot more before the closures of the 50s and 60s.\n\nIs this something that is unique to the UK, or is it common in other countries as well? I cant think of any examples myself off the top of my head. Maybe this is because railways in Continental Europe were better planned or nationalised when they were first built, and in the really big countries (USA, Canada etc), there were not any railways competing with each other in the same area? I know Ireland used to have a few small towns with stations on seperate lines (eg Letterkenny) but I think they have all closed now.\n\nI am not including the really big cities (New York or Paris etc) in this.\n\nWas immediately thinking of Kampen and Kampen Zuid in the Netherlands. Kampen was supposed to be closed as heavy rail station when the Hanzelijn was built, but this never happened so now this town has multiple stations.\n\nThere were more prior to the conversion of the Hofpleinlijn and Zoetermeer stadslijn to RandstadRail. Voorburg to Voorburg 't Loo, Rotterdam Central to Rotterdam Hofplein and Zoetermeer to Driemanspolder would all require a lengthy detour via the Hague to travel between them by rail. The latter two were are only seperated by an highway.\n\nAnd of course the relics from the past: Den Haag Hollands Spoor and Den Haag Centraal (built next to the former Den Haag Staatsspoor) and Utrecht Central and Utrecht Maliebaan used to be seperate stations of competing railways, but are nowadays connected with eachother.\n\nAnother one in CZ; Litvinov, north of Most, N-W of Praha, close by border to Germany, and also has a fast tramway to Most-the trainlines are pretty close by, one is the end of a branch, but there is also a height difference in between.\n\nIn NL also Eijgelshoven, in the deep south, one is on the line to Aachen/Germany, again a fairly big height difference between the 2-once there was a seemingly big scandal as the one to Aachen did not have all the usual machines etc one would find at all dutch stations. At that time it was 2 different companies, but since then ARRIVA now runs both and has rectified this.\n\nIN the distant past in BE: the main line from Gent ended at Linkeroever (left side) but has since been connected and much upgraded to Central.\n\nNiebüll in North Friesland has the mainline DB station and Niebüll NEG station (for the branch to the ferry port at Dagebüll) on opposite sides of the Bahnhofstrasse. You can only get from one to the other by rail with a back-and-forth shunting move over a level crossing.\n\nThe Brandenburg town of Beelitz has two stations on its territory: Beelitz Stadt on the Wannsee-Juterbog line and Beelitz-Heilstaetten on the Berlin-Dessau route. They're about seven km apart with a forest in between, though. Next station with both lines in common is Michendorf, 15km away.\n\nThen there are all those towns straddling the Rhine with stations on both the left & right Rheinstrecke lines (Bonn Hbf / Bonn-Beuel, for example).\n\nAnother example in the Netherlands would be Geleen Oost (on the Sittard-Heerlen line) and Geleen-Lutterade (on the Sittard-Maastricht line).\n\nThere's also Veenendaal-De Klomp on the Utrecht to Arnhem line, while Veenendaal Centrum and Veenendaal West are on the Rhenen branch line, requiring you to travel to Driebergen-Zeist (the second station before the branch line) instead of Maarn first in order to change to a train bound for Veenendaal Centrum or Rhenen as the intercity trains that call at Veenendaal-De Klomp don't stop at Maarn (so you pass the station twice).\n\nMortsel in Belgium also has a lot of stations on different lines: Mortsel and Mortsel-Liersesteenweg are on line 27 (Antwerp - Brussels) with trains bound for Lier and further also calling at Mortsel before changing onto the line to Lier. Mortsel-Deurnesteenweg and Mortsel-Oude-God are on line 25 (confusingly another line from Antwerp to Brussels) where Mortsel-Deurnesteenweg, as a local station, only has a Sunday service as all local trains on Mo-Sa use line 27 instead. Not really an issue, because Mortsel station is located right next to Mortsel-Deurnesteenweg.\n\nNiebüll in North Friesland has the mainline DB station and Niebüll NEG station (for the branch to the ferry port at Dagebüll) on opposite sides of the Bahnhofstrasse. You can only get from one to the other by rail with a back-and-forth shunting move over a level crossing.\n\nA very typical Central European combination of main-line and separate local station, much rarer in the UK.\n\nThe nearest to a totally unconnected pair of German stations I can think of is Pössneck in Thüringen with an Oberer and Unterer Bahnhof.\n\nThe Brandenburg town of Beelitz has two stations on its territory: Beelitz Stadt on the Wannsee-Juterbog line and Beelitz-Heilstaetten on the Berlin-Dessau route. They're about seven km apart with a forest in between, though. Next station with both lines in common is Michendorf, 15km away.\n\nThen there are all those towns straddling the Rhine with stations on both the left & right Rheinstrecke lines (Bonn Hbf / Bonn-Beuel, for example).\n\nThese follow from the convention that every station in a particular local authority area includes the LA name - if you want a UK equivalent, then Bromley would have a good 15 stations on 3-4 separate lines!\n\nIn the Chicago area, Joliet Illinois is the terminus of two routes on the Metra Rail commuter system, and it is also served by Amtrak services to St Louis and Kansas City, as well as the Texas Eagle which runs to Dallas, Austin, San Antonio and eventually to Los Angeles.\n\nTo the West of Chicago, Naperville Illinois is served by Metra Rail commuter trains, as well as several Amtrak services including the California Zephyr\n\nThere are several examples in and around New York such as Poughkeepsie (Metro North Railroad & Amtrak) and Trenton (New Jersey Transit and Amtrak)\n\nTo the West of Chicago, Naperville Illinois is served by Metra Rail commuter trains, as well as several Amtrak services including the California Zephyr\n\nA single station served by both Metra and Amtrak (on a line owned by BNSF).\n\n(Before the 1995 BNSF merger, Galesburg IL had separate stations on the Santa Fe and BN mainlines through the town, both served by Amtrak, but the Southwest Chief was re-routed post-merger and the ex-Santa Fe station closed).\n\nJoliet Illinois is the terminus of two routes on the Metra Rail commuter system, and it is also served by Amtrak services\n\nTwo separate Metra routes that terminate at a single station with platforms at right-angles to each other. It's Joliet Transportation Center, successor to the old Joliet Union Station (which also had platforms at right-angles but on the opposite, west, side of the north-south mainline). There is also a south to east connecting track (but AFAIK not used for passenger trains).\n\nSo I think neither of those qualify as 'railway stations on separate lines with no direct link between them', as per the OP's question.\n\nA single station served by both Metra and Amtrak (on a line owned by BNSF).\n\n(Before the 1995 BNSF merger, Galesburg IL had separate stations on the Santa Fe and BN mainlines through the town, both served by Amtrak, but the Southwest Chief was re-routed post-merger and the ex-Santa Fe station closed).\n\nTwo separate Metra routes that terminate at a single station with platforms at right-angles to each other.

Neither do my examples in New York and New Jersey either.\n\nHowever, still in the Chicago area, the suburb of Rosemont has stations on the Metra Rail system and the CTA Blue Line, and the suburb of Blue Island has separate stations on the Rock Island Line and Metra Electric Line.\n\nIn New York City, the suburb of Far Rockaway is the terminus of the A train (subway) and also a separate station on the Long Island Rail Road.\n\nYes, I agree that those two examples don't fit the original definition for this thread.

I think at one stage as borders opened up the square in front of it was accessible from both countries but was not an official border crossing, so if you came in from Italy you could get as far as the steps into the station but not (legally) any further.\n\nSassuolo in Italy (near Parma), is the terminus of two separate branches that end a couple of hundred metres apart.\n\nItaly has a number of places which have Trenitalia and another local railway company with separate stations, such as around Bari.\n\nYes....further Italian examples include Giarre in Eastern Sicily, where the standard gauge FS Trenitalia station (Giarre-Riposto) lies alongside the separate 950 mm gauge Ferrovia Circumetnea station. Not too far away, on the Calabrian mainland, a similar situation exists at Gioia Tauro, where the standard gauge station is a couple of hundred metres away from the station of the 950 mm gauge Ferrovia della Calabria lines to Cinquefrondi and Palmi. However, the latter two lines have now been 'bustituted' for a number of years due to the poor condition of the steel lattice viaduct just outside the station and although the parallel main line viaduct has now been replaced by a new reinforced concrete structure, it doesn't look as though funding will be forthcoming to replace its narrow gauge sister.\n\nSeveral others in the area (depends how “unconnected” they need to be) How about Plauen,\n\nDefinitely - the connection goes outside the city boundary.\n\nJena-Göschwitz serves both routes (it has only recently had Jena added to the name, to be fair).\n\nAltstätten in Switzerland has its mainline station Altstätten SG which is a 20 minute walk away from the terminus of the Appenzeller bahnen at Altstätten Stadt. By train the trip between the two would require a lengthy detour via Sankt Gallen.\n\nShame the short tram connection was bustituted in the 60s.\n\nIn the Chicago area, Joliet Illinois is the terminus of two routes on the Metra Rail commuter system, and it is also served by Amtrak services to St Louis and Kansas City, as well as the Texas Eagle which runs to Dallas, Austin, San Antonio and eventually to Los Angeles.\n\nTo the West of Chicago, Naperville Illinois is served by Metra Rail commuter trains, as well as several Amtrak services including the California Zephyr\n\nThere are several examples in and around New York such as Poughkeepsie (Metro North Railroad & Amtrak) and Trenton (New Jersey Transit and Amtrak)\n\nThese are examples of stations shared by multiple operators - not separate stations for different ones.\n\nA better Chicagoland example would be Blue Island. Though both are now Metra stations, one was originally for the Illinois Central's electric commuter services and the other was for the Rock Island.\n\nWell until a few years ago there was Comines (FR) and Komen (BE) which served the town of Comines/Komen which straddles the border between France and Belgium. Unfortunately SNCF withdrew the train services from Lille a little while back though there may be plans to provide a tram/train service at some point instead of the express bus that currently runs. Even when the trains ran (only a handful a day at peaks times) a fully staffed station with ticket office was open 7 days a week in Comines! The SNCB line remains open with direct trains through to Brussels however."
