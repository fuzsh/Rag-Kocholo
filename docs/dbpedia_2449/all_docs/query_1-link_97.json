It continues with the establishment of SIGMAA on RUME and its growth during the first ten years of its existence.\n\nThis is a list of the papers, with discussion questions, that we are reading and discussing in our math ed research seminar this semester. I find it useful to have such questions prepared ahead of time in case there is a \"lull\" in the conversation, or if the conversation goes in unfruitful directions, so it can be redirected to discussing the paper at hand."
