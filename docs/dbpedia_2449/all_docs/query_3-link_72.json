Putnam Competition\n\nMay 2, 2015: UMass Boston Students Strive in International Mathematics Competition [The Mass Media]\n\nApr 21, 2015: UMass Boston Students Excel in International Mathematics Competition [UMass Boston News]\n\nMar 29, 2012: UMass Boston Team Scores High on Prestigious Math Competition [The Mass Media]\n\nThe William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition is perhaps the best known college-level mathematics contest in the world. Each year more than 4,000 students from nearly 600 colleges and universities spend the first Saturday in December enjoying original mathematical challenges. For a number of years UMass Boston students have participated in \"The Putnam\", both individually and as team members. Recently our team has enjoyed substantial successes, with rankings of 21st in 2011, 22nd in 2015, and 24th in 2014.\n\nEach fall semester Professor Catalin Zara convenes and leads a student group focusing on the enjoyment, challenges and strategies of mathematics problem solving, with the aim of participation in the Putnam Competition. This is an exciting opportunity to further your mathematical experience, collaborate with other students, and reap benefits that will remain long after the Competition takes place. Please contact Professor Zara if you are interested in participating in the Putnam and in joining the problem-solving student group.
