Given 4 lines in Euclidean 3-space:\n\nL1: x = 1, y = 0;\n\nL2: y = 1, z = 0;\n\nL3: x = 0, z = 1;\n\nL4: x = y, y = -6z.\n\nFind the equations of the two lines which both meet all of the Li.\n\nA5. Do either (1) or (2)\n\n(1) x and y are functions of t. Solve x' = x + y - 3, y' = -2x + 3y + 1, given that x(0) = y(0) = 0.\n\n(2) A weightless rod is hinged at O so that it can rotate without friction in a vertical plane. A mass m is attached to the end of the rod A, which is balanced vertically above O. At time t = 0, the rod moves away from the vertical with negligible initial angular velocity. Prove that the mass first reaches the position under O at t = √(OA/g) ln (1 + √2).\n\nA6. Do either (1) or (2):\n\n(1) A circle radius r rolls around the inside of a circle radius 3r, so that a point on its circumference traces out a curvilinear triangle. Find the area inside this figure.\n\n(2) A frictionless shell is fired from the ground with speed v at an unknown angle to the vertical. It hits a plane at a height h. Show that the gun must be sited within a radius v/g (v2 - 2gh)1/2 of the point directly below the point of impact.\n\nA7. Do either (1) or (2):\n\n(1) Let Ca be the curve (y - a2)2 = x2(a2 - x2). Find the curve which touches all Ca for a > 0. Sketch the solution and at least two of the Ca.\n\n(2) Given that (1 - hx)-1(1 - kx)-1 = ∑i≥0 ai xi, prove that (1 + hkx)(1 - hkx)-1(1 - h2x)-1(1 - k2x)-1 = ∑i≥0 ai2 xi.\n\nB5. Do either (1) or (2):\n\n(1) Prove that ∫1k [x] f '(x) dx = [k] f(k) - ∑1[k] f(n), where k > 1, and [z] denotes the greatest integer ≤ z. Find a similar expression for: ∫1k [x2] f '(x) dx.\n\n(2) A particle moves freely in a straight line except for a resistive force proportional to its speed. Its speed falls from 1,000 ft/s to 900 ft/s over 1,200 ft. Find the time taken to the nearest 0.01 s. [No calculators or log tables allowed!]\n\nB6. Do either (1) or (2):\n\n(1) f is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and twice differentiable on the open interval (a, b). Given x0 ∈ (a, b), prove that we can find ξ ∈ (a, b) such that ( (f(x0) - f(a))/(x0 - a) - (f(b) - f(a))/(b - a) )/(x0 - b) = f ''(ξ)/2.\n\n(2) AB and CD are identical uniform rods, each with mass m and length 2a. They are placed a distance b apart, so that ABCD is a rectangle. Calculate the gravitational attraction between them. What is the limiting value as a tends to zero?\n\nB7. Do either (1) or (2):\n\n(1) Let ai = ∑n=0∞ x3n+i/(3n+i)! Prove that a03 + a13 + a23 - 3 a0a1a2 = 1.\n\n(2) Let O be the origin, λ a positive real number, C be the conic ax2 + by2 + cx + dy + e = 0, and Cλ the conic ax2 + by2 + λcx + λdy + λ2e = 0. Given a point P and a non-zero real number k, define the transformation D(P,k) as follows. Take coordinates (x',y') with P as the origin. Then D(P,k) takes (x',y') to (kx',ky'). Show that D(O,λ) and D(A,-λ) both take C into Cλ, where A is the point (-cλ/(a(1 + λ)), -dλ/(b(1 + λ)) ). Comment on the case λ = 1."
