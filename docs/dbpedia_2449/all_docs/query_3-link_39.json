        "text": "Putnam preparation\n\nSee here for general information about Putnam at UCLA. See also the Putnam rules and the official website.\n\nThe Putnam mathematical competition, organized by the Mathematical Association of America, takes place on the first Saturday in December. The examination consists of a morning session (08:00-11:00) and an afternoon session (13:00-16:00) with a 2 hour break in between. For Putnam 2023, the exam will take place on 2023-12-02 08:00-16:00 at LOCATION TBD.\n\nThe best preparation for the Putnam competition is going over the problems from previous years. Problems (with solutions) can be found on Kiran Kedlaya's archive. A good strategy is to try each problem for at most 1 hour, and then look up the solutions, and then try to remember the ideas and tricks from the solutions for subsequent problems. The problems are generally ordered according to difficulty (A1, B1 are the easiest, A6, B6 are the hardest), so for practice, first do all the easy problems, and then move on to the harder problems.\n\nThere are also three published books, containing all past problems up to 2000. In the books the problems are discussed in detail, and sometimes given multiple solutions:\n\nThe William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition: Problems and Solutions: 1938-1964, by A.M.Gleason, R.E.Greenwood, L.M.Kelly, MAA (1980).\n\nThe William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition : Problems and Solutions 1965-1984 (MAA Problem Book Series) by Gerald L.
