        "text": "Putnam Competition\n\nThe William Lowell Putnam Mathematics Competition is a prestigious math contest for undergraduate college students in the US and Canada. It is held each year on the first Saturday in December, and consists of two, 3 hours sessions of 6 problems each.\n\nAny undergraduate student with interest in mathematics and challenging problems is encouraged to take part in the Putnam competition. The registration deadline is in mid October, so any FIU student interested in the contest should contact me by then. There is no upper limit on the number of students that can register from a given school, although a team is formed by only 3 contestants designated in advance.\n\nIf you want to read more about the contest, here is its official web site.\n\nYou will find plenty of information, including archives of subjects and solutions from past years, on other sites on the web. Here are a few:\n\nhttp://www.unl.edu/amc/a-activities/a7-problems/putnamindex.shtml\n\nhttp://www.math.niu.edu/~rusin/problems-math/\n\nhttp://www.math.ksu.edu/main/events/ksucomp/putnam/putnam\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nNotable results by FIU teams and students:\n\n2008 - FIU team ranked 114-th out of 405 teams from US and Canada\n\n(team members: Rafael Badui, Ishtiaq Syed, David Shor)\n\nIndividual results:\n\nIsh Syed - 20 pts - ranked in the top 619 out of 3627 participants\n\nRafael Badui - 9 pts - ranked in the top 1412\n\nLenny Foret - 9 pts - ranked in the top 1412\n\n2007 - FIU team ranked 96-th out of 413 teams from US and Canada\n\n(team members: James Fullwood, Rafael Badui, Walter Cravero)\n\nIndividual results:\n\nWalter Cravero - 13 pts - ranked in the top 708 out of 3753 participants\n\nRafael Badui - 12 pts - ranked in the top 819\n\nIstiaq Syed - 11 pts - ranked in the top 972\n\nDavid Shor - 10 pts - ranked in the top 1180\n\n2006 - Individual results\n\n- Jorge Cantillo - 10 pts - ranked in the top 747 out of 3640 participants\n\n- Sui Joo - 8 pts - ranked in the top 938\n\n2005 - Individual results\n\n- Fabio Beltramini -10 pts - ranked in the top 1055 out of 3545 participants\n\n- Jorge Cantillo - 9 pts - ranked in the top 1265\n\n- Alejandro Presto - 8 pts - ranked in the top 1348\n\n2004 - FIU team ranked 89-th out of 411 teams from schools in US and Canada\n\n(team members: Anca Vacarescu, Jorge Cantillo, Vasyl Kopych)\n\nIndividual results:\n\nAnca Vacarescu - 21 pts - ranked in the top 509 out of 3733 participants\n\nJorge Cantillo -10 pts - ranked in the top 1124\n\n2003 - FIU team ranked 28-th out of 401 teams from schools in US and Canada\n\n(team members: Anca Vacarescu, Alejandro Presto, Dennis Ledis)\n\nIndividual results:\n\nAnca Vacarescu - 26 pts - ranked in the top 265 out of 3615 participants\n\nAlejandro Presto - 18 pts - ranked in the top 499\n\nDennis Ledis - 18 pts - ranked in the top 499.\n\n2002 - Individual results\n\nAnca Vacarescu - 11 pts - ranked in the top 1114 out of 3349 participants\n\n2001 - FIU team ranked 44-th out of 336 teams from schools in US and Canada\n\n(team members: Anca Vacarescu, Dane McGuckian, Pablo Maurin)\n\nIndividual results:\n\nAnca Vacarescu - 31 pts - ranked in the top 252 out of 2954 participants\n\nDane McGuckian - 21 pts - ranked in the top 415\n\nPablo Maurin - 10 pts - ranked in the top 970\n\nIf you want your name on this list, the first step is to take part in the competition.\n\nThe problems are difficult, but, hopefully, you will find it enjoyable to challenge yourself.\n\nEach problem is worth 10 pts, so the maximum possible score is 120 pts. Don't worry about getting 120. (It never happened, in the recent years, at least.)\n\nBut you should know that if you manage to score just 1 point out of the 120, you'll already be in the top half of the participants!"
