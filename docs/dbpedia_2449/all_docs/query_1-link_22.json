Many of them have highly successful careers in academia. This is less so in recent decades. As of today, the last Putnam Fellow to make full professor in academia is Ana Caraiani (PF in 2003 and 2004). None of the Putnam Fellows after 2004, almost 100 of them, has reached that level of success yet.\n\nIn the old days many Putnam Fellows became world-class mathematicians, and a few physicists.

I honestly think its negatively affecting the physical looks of these young people (compare them to random youth on the street in china/korea- it's definitely different and worse). Many of these people do not have as strong intrinsic interest in math research as an equivalent yt/J which is why a lot of them fade away with age and become SWE/quants. We can only hope this situation improves because this inanity is negatively affecting the ability-output ratio for azn researchers.\n\nIn the old days many Putnam Fellows became world-class mathematicians, and a few physicists.

None of the Putnam Fellows after 2004, almost 100 of them, has reached that level of success yet.\n\nHere we also have to account for the fact that the academic job market in math and physics has been crumbling to the point of no return over the last couple decades. Many talented people realize this and do not wish to participate. Back when Feynman entered it was a steadily growing enterprise (American theoretical physics was then a backwater being developed by the efforts of people like Oppenheimer; new universities were being built, funding improving after WW2, etc)\n\nIn the old days many Putnam Fellows became world-class mathematicians, and a few physicists.

What this implies is the following- the department expected students to find TT positions (there was little industry for theoretical physicists at the time) after the phd, without a postdoc (or just a short postdoc in europe). In HRM physics departments today often in a cohort you'd only get 1 person ending up as faculty (and that's after ~5 years of postdoc LJL).\n\nI agree with the sentiment regarding the rewards to math... I know so many mathematicians, who could probably take what I do and blow it out in a weekend, struggling from postdoc to postdoc at schools that dont even have real phd programs. I think if I was a Putnam winner, and someone told me I could have a math phd or 150k salary with 2% equity I'd do the 2nd thing. It's just too much stress for no gain. If there was nothing else to do but be a plumber then fine. But, now they perceive there's more out there. I had an anz friend who won all sorts of random competitions. He just went to drop box after college. I doubt he used anything he learned figuring out how to store your keepsake prn videos forever in the ether. But for that moolah you might as well.\n\nIn the old days many Putnam Fellows became world-class mathematicians, and a few physicists. Many of them have highly successful careers in academia.

Seems insanely slow.\n\nYou would think that someone who was a 4-time Putnam Fellow along with highly intelligent parents would be a full professor by now. I’m talking about someone like Daniel Kane.\n\nDK is very productive but hasn't published a paper in top-5 journals. Also, many of his papers are in combinatorics or computer science.\n\nThere are 4 Putnam Fellows on the faculty of UCSD Math dept so I guess they are not easily impressed."
