        "text": "The William Lowell Putnam Competition is an annual mathematics competition for regularly enrolled undergraduates in colleges or universities of the United States and Canada, who have not yet received a college degree. Prizes are awarded to individual participants and institutions.\n\nThe Putnam examination tests originality, technical competence and familiarity with the formal theories embodied in undergraduate mathematics. Questions cut across the bounds of various disciplines, and include self-contained questions that do not fit into any of the usual categories. These self-contained questions can involve elementary concepts from group theory, set theory, graph theory, lattice theory, number theory or cardinal arithmetic.\n\nThe Putnam mathematical competition takes place on the first Saturday in December. The examination consists of a morning session 8-11AM (08:00-11:00) and an afternoon session 1-4PM (13:00-16:00) with a 2 hour break in between. For Putnam 2023, the exam will take place on Saturday, December 2, 2023 from 8AM – 4 PM on campus (KINSEY PV 1200B).\n\nThe UCLA Mathematics Department coordinates the UCLA Putnam team and runs activities such as\n\nPrizes: The top performing UCLA student will receive the Basil Gordon Prize, valued at $1,000. All the UCLA students placing in the top 100 nationwide will receive a Putnam Performance Prize where the amount will depend on the nationwide rank.\n\nReasons to participate: Students taking part in and preparing for the competition learn a lot about general mathematical skills such as solving problems and proving statements. Graduate schools and other employers can be impressed by high Putnam scores.\n\nPreparation: Check here for more resources and information about how to prepare for the exam.\n\nTime and Location: The Putnam mathematical competition takes place on the first Saturday in December. For Putnam 2023, the exam will take place on Saturday, December 2, 2023 from 8 AM – 4 PM on campus (KINSEY PV 1200B). There are two sessions, a morning session from 8 am to 11 am and an afternoon session from 1 pm to 4 pm. There are 6 problems in the morning session and 6 problems in the afternoon session. Each contestant works independently with no collaboration. Results of the competition become known around March of the following year.\n\nRegistration: Please register at https://forms.gle/8XQjH2dpsSEKCECm8 to receive email updates about the Putnam. You also need to register directly with the Putnam organizing committee at https://www.maa.org/math-competitions/putnam-competition.\n\nContact: For general inquiries contact Professor Sarkar at sucharit[at]math.ucla.edu."
