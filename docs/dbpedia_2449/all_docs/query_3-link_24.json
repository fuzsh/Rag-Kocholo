        "text": "I can't believe I am going to get up at 830 later today and get ready to take the putnam exam. Test is from 10-1 and 3-6. I hope to get at least 1 question right if I am going to spend 6 hours on a test (I probably could have taken the MCAT for fun instead). I haven't studied for it or anything (which I don't think you should do). So is anyone else a sucker for S&M like myself and taking the exam as well? Does anyone know how how high the highest scores were last year? I heard that if the scores for a year go above 100, the exam makers make the exam impossible the next year so the highest scores are only in the 80s. I hope this year we get an easy test.\n\nyour lucky your test starts at 10 when i wrote it it started at 8am BUT free lunch at the expense of the math dept is great.\n\nIn my last year the test was easiest... I hated it when you could solve a question only hours after sitting through the 6 hours scratching your head, I swear they need to make those competitions in coffee houses.\n\nGood Luck and remmeber probability and induction.\n\nAre you sure? The website says everyone has to take it today. If anyone in a different country is taking it on Sunday, it is because it is already suday there. It is 1:52 pm right now (east coast US). So i think I am ok to post problems from the 1st half since everyone already has done them.\n\ngravenewworld said:\n\nHeres the problem I spent all my time on- Let p(z) be a polynomial with roots having modulus =1 in the complex plane. Let g(z)=P(z)/z^n/2. Prove g'(z)=0 has solutions that have modulus 1.\n\nTwo questions:\n\n1) Do \"with roots\" and \"has solutions\" mean some roots/solutions or all roots/solutions have modulus 1?\n\n2) Is it g(z)=(P(z)/z^n)/(2) or g(z)=P(z)/(z^n/2)?\n\ngravenewworld said:\n\nThere is always a lot of advanced stuff on the test. The only basic calculus one was evalute the intergral from 0 to 1 of ln(x+1)/X^2+1 dx.\n\n[tex]\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\ln{\\left(x+1\\right)}}{x^{2}+1}\\,dx[/tex]\n\nHmm... The only thing I can think of is to rewrite the integrand as:\n\n[tex]\\ln{\\left(x+1\\right)}\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\left(-1\\right)^nx^{2n}[/tex]\n\n..but that's just throwing it out there; I'm not sure if it's even the right idea. Did anyone actually get this one?\n\nI got the integral by decomposing the integrand into partial fractions like:\n\n[log(1-i)/(-2i)]/(x+i) + [log(1+i)/(2i)]/(x-i)\n\n(this may not be exactly correct, but it's easy to understand)\n\nfrom there it is simply knowing the logarithm of a complex number and complex multiplication.\n\nIt turns out that the answer is (PI*log 2)/8\n\n2099 said:\n\nI got the integral by decomposing the integrand into partial fractions like:\n\n[log(1-i)/(-2i)]/(x+i) + [log(1+i)/(2i)]/(x-i)\n\n(this may not be exactly correct, but it's easy to understand)\n\nfrom there it is simply knowing the logarithm of a complex number and complex multiplication.\n\nIt turns out that the answer is (PI*log 2)/8\n\nInteresting. Do you remember any other problems from the exam?\n\nTwo questions:\n\n1) Do \"with roots\" and \"has solutions\" mean some roots/solutions or all roots/solutions have modulus 1?\n\n2) Is it g(z)=(P(z)/z^n)/(2) or g(z)=P(z)/(z^n/2)?\n\n1) If I remember the question correctly, all roots/solution have mod 1\n\n2.) g(z)=P(z)/(z^n/2)\n\nHere are some questions from the second half that I remember.\n\nLet m,n be positive integers. Consider the n-tuple (x1,x2,...,xn) (x1,x2,..,xn are any integers). Let the n-tuples have the property |x1|+...+|xn|<=m. If f(m,n) is the amount of n-tuples that satisfies this property, show that f(m,n)=f(n,m).\n\nFind all intergers n,k1,k2,...,kn such that k1+k2+...+kn=5n-4\n\nand 1/k1 + 1/k2 +...+1/kn=1\n\nFind a polynomial f(x,y) such that f([a],[2a])=0 for any real number a.\n\n[ ] is supposed to be the floor function.\n\nConsider a nxn matrix having only entries +/-1. Each row in the matrix is orthogonal to the other. Prove that there is a axb submatrix consisting of only 1s, such that ab<=n. (I'm not sure if i remembered exactly what the question was, so you may not want to rack your brain over this one.)\n\ngravenewworld said:\n\nConsider a nxn matrix having only entries +/-1.

The thing is any 2 rows must differ in n/2 places. Following this argument leads to the conclusion that ab<=n, which is what you have to show."
