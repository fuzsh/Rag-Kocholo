        "text": "This is Feynman's memory of an unnamed person who told him that. To quote him in an interview:\n\nAnyway, I was among the first five. I have since found out from somebody from Canada, where it was scored, who was in the scoring division—he came to me much later and he told me that it was astonishing. He said that at this examination, “Not only were you one of the five, but the gap between you and the other four was sensational.” He told me that. I didn’t know that. That may not be correct, but that’s what I heard.\n\nInterview of Richard Feynman by Charles Weiner on 1966 March 5, Niels Bohr Library & Archives, American Institute of Physics, College Park, MD USA.\n\nThank you Dave L Renfro for pointing me here. I was lucky to find this -- the word \"Putnam\" was never mentioned!\n\nHowever, according to wikipedia:\n\nplus one of the top five individual scorers (designated as Putnam Fellows) is awarded a scholarship of up to $12,000 plus tuition at Harvard University (Putnam Fellow Prize Fellowship),1\n\nWilliam Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition\n\nThen the exam thing came around, and one of the prizes was that one of the winners, one of the five, would be chosen for a scholarship to Harvard for the graduate school — I believe, if I remember right. The method, as I understood it, was they didn’t want to take the winner, because they didn’t want to be stuck with a nut of some sort, by accident, right? So they made it that out of the first five they could choose, Ok?\n\nInterview of Richard Feynman by Charles Weiner on 1966 March 5, Niels Bohr Library & Archives, American Institute of Physics, College Park, MD USA.\n\nSo from the same interview, he mentioned that the math contest is national and the top fives are awarded Harvard scholarship. I am leaning towards Putnam. :)"
