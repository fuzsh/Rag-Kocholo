        "text": "The competition began in 1938 and is designed to stimulate a healthful rivalry in mathematical studies in the colleges and universities of the United States and Canada. It exists because Mr. William Lowell Putnam had a profound conviction in the value of organized team competition in regular college studies.\n\nMr. Putnam, a member of the Harvard class of 1882, wrote an article for the December 1921 issue of the Harvard Graduates' Magazine in which he described the merits of an intellectual competition. To establish such a competition, his widow, Elizabeth Lowell Putnam, in 1927 created a trust fund known as the William Lowell Putnam Intercollegiate Memorial Fund.\n\nThe first competition supported by this fund was in the field of English and a few years later a second experimental competition was held, this time in mathematics between two institutions. It was not until after Mrs. Putnam's death in 1935 that the examination assumed its present form and was placed under the administration of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA).\n\nThe exam is a nationwide exam and prizes will be awarded to the Departments of Mathematics of the Institutions with the overall five winning teams. In addition, there will be prizes awarded to each of the members of the winning teams.\n\nThe five highest ranking individuals are designated Putnam Fellows by the Mathematical Association of America (MAA). Prizes will be awarded to each of these individuals and to each of the next twenty highest ranking contestants.\n\nThe annual William Lowell Putnam Prize Scholarship will be awarded to one of the Putnam Fellows. This scholarship carries a value of $12,000 (plus tuition at Harvard).\n\nThe Elizabeth Lowell Putnam Prize will be awarded to a woman whose performance on the Competition has been deemed particularly meritorious.\n\nOn the local level, i.e. at Virginia Tech, about $200-250 in prize money is available for the best performances in the competition."
