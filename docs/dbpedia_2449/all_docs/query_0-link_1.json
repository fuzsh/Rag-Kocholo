        "text": "I think saying you were among the top \"N\" participants where N is something like 500, 200, 100, or less would be the right way to phrase the accomplishment.\n\nThe (anonymized) scores and rank of all participants are published, so you can find your exact rank. Very roughly, I'd say top 50ish programs in math would view a top 500 rank favorably, top 20ish would like top 200, top 10 would like top 100, and the most elite would only view Putnam fellow or one of the (next \"X\") categories as noteworthy. I think CS theory views math contest ability in a similar manner to pure math programs so that this mostly still applies.\n\nI cannot speak directly about the programs in question: I was on a committee that did admissions for a masters program in math which had some students who went on to do PhDs in math (and occasionally CS). In that context, I would have looked favorably on any Putnam score of 10 or above (because that means you probably solved at least one problem or nearly solved 2). But you are applying to top programs which are likely going to be higher. I would sit down and discuss this with your adviser or with people in the CS department at your current school. I don't have a firm cutoff, but my guess would be that any school, even a top school would look favorably at any score of at least 20 or so."
