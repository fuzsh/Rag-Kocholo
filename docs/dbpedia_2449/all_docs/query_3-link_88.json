        "text": "The William Lowell Putnam Mathematics Exam is offered each December and taken by undergraduates across the United States and Canada. Problems on the exam are generally very challenging, but not specialized. In other words, they are accessible to students who may not have taken advanced courses.\n\nFor Fall 2023, Putnam meetings will be held Mondays at 5:00pm in the math department common room, Bailey 204.\n\nThe meetings are informal and fun. While one goal is to help prepare for the exam, the main purpose is to have fun learning and doing mathematics. The meetings may continue into January in preparation for the Rochester Mathematics Olympiad, a Putnam-like exam sponsored by the University of Rochester and administered in early February."
