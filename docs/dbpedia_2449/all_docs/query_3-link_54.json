        "text": "Each year, APU fields a team for the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition. Founded in 1927 and administered by the Mathematical Association of America (MAA), the Putnam Competition attracts more than 4,000 students from 500+ colleges and universities in the United States and Canada each year. The exam tests studentsâ€™ originality and technical competence, and a strong score on the Putnam Exam looks impressive on an application to graduate school.\n\nTeam practice sessions are often held during the fall semester. Interested students should contact Bryant Mathews at [email protected] by mid-September to register for the exam. Students from any major and at any level are welcome to participate, although some exam questions will be more accessible to students who have taken some advanced math courses.\n\nNote: This information is current for the 2024-25 academic year; however, all stated academic information is subject to change.
