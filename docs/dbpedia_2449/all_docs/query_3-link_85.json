The competition takes three students from each competing school and pits their Putnam exam scores against one other to see which school fares the best.\n\nPlacing in the Top 10 Percent\n\nHistorically, students at the University of Idaho place in the top 10 percent nationally, receiving scores that are higher than the national mean and median scores for the competition (the median score is zero out of 120)."
