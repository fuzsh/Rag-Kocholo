        "text": "Are you an SFU undergraduate who relishes a challenge? The William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition is held on the first Saturday of December each year. In 2023, a total of 3857 undergraduates from 471 institutions in Canada and the USA entered the competition. Wikipedia has a good overview of the Competition.\n\nThe Putnam isn't easy. Typically more than half the entrants in any year score 0, 1 or 2 points â€” out of a possible 120! Yet the questions don't assume anything beyond standard undergraduate mathematics. Success in answering questions requires persistence, originality, and crystal-clear expression of ideas.\n\nInterested?"
