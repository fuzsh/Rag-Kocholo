        "text": "The Math Department has made a commitment to field competitive teams in the annual William L. Putnam Mathematical Competition, or Putnam Exam.\n\nThe Putnam Exam is a notoriously challenging exam consisting of 12 mind-numbing problems, six in the morning session and six in the afternoon. These problems cut across many areas of mathematics, and are designed to test “originality as well as technical competence,” according to the announcement brochure.\n\nThe exam is usually held on the first Saturday in December. Of the students who take it, three are designated as Lafayette’s “team,” while the others participate on an individual basis. Thousands of other undergraduate mathematics students throughout the United States and Canada take this examination more or less simultaneously at their own institutions. The registration deadline is in mid-October. There is no fee for participating.\n\nSome brochure propaganda\n\n“The competition is open only to regularly enrolled undergraduates in colleges & universities of the United States & Canada, who have not yet received a college degree. No individual may participate more than four times.”\n\n“Prizes and scholarships are available to the highest ranking individuals and to the five winning teams. Institutions throughout the United States & Canada are encouraged to offer fellowships to high ranking contestants in the competition.”\n\n“In addition, the Elizabeth Lowell Putnam Prize will be awarded periodically to a woman whose performance on the Putnam Exam has been deemed particularly meritorious. This prize would be in addition to any other prizes she might otherwise win.”\n\nVisit the Putnam Exam Home Page"
