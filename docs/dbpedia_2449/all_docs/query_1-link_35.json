        "text": "Zheng-Chao Han\n\nComings and Goings\n\nCongratulations to the January and May 2010 recipients of Ph.D.'s! They, and several students on track to receive their degree in October, are shown below, with their advisors' names and their next position. Sixteen students will enter our Ph.D. program in Fall 2010, eleven from the U.S. and five from abroad. Sources of financial support include Teaching Assistantships; Research Assistantships from external faculty grants; the Weill Fellowships, endowed by Adrienne and Maurice Weill; and competitive fellowships such as Rutgers University Excellence Fellowships, Rutgers University Torrey Fellowships, U.S. Department of Education GAANN Fellowships, Department of Homeland Security DyDAn Fellowships, a Fullbright Fellowship, and a Portuguese Science and Technology Fellowship.\n\nPaul Ellis\n\nJan., 2010\n\nAdvisor: Simon Thomas\n\nPosition: Assistant Professor of Mathematics, University of Connecticut\n\nJawon Koo\n\nJan., 2010\n\nAdvisor: Paul Feehan\n\nPosition: Academic Position in South Korea\n\nMing Shi\n\nJan., 2010\n\nAdvisor: Paul Feehan\n\nPosition: Senior Quantitative Advisor, Ernst & Young\n\nSara Blight\n\nMay, 2010\n\nAdvisor: Henryk Iwaniec\n\nPosition: National Security Agency at Fort Meade\n\nGoran Djankovic\n\nMay, 2010\n\nAdvisor: Henryk Iwaniec\n\nPosition: Researcher, Mathematical Institute of the Serbian Academy of Arts and Sciences, Belgrade, Serbia.\n\nLiviu Ilinca\n\nMay, 2010\n\nAdvisor: Jeffry Kahn\n\nPosition: Postdoctoral Fellow, Indiana University\n\nHoi Nguyen\n\nMay, 2010\n\nAdvisor: Van Vu\n\nPosition: Postdoctoral Fellow, University of Pennsylvania\n\nWesley Pegden\n\nMay, 2010\n\nAdvisor: Jozsef Beck\n\nPosition: NSF Postdoctoral Fellow, NYU (Courant Institute)\n\nDaniel Staley\n\nMay, 2010\n\nAdvisor: Steve Ferry\n\nPosition: Quantitative Researcher, Yodle, Inc.\n\nNan Li\n\nOct., 2010\n\nAdvisor: Xiaochun Rong\n\nPosition: Visiting Assistant Professor, University of Notre Dame\n\nJin Wang\n\nOct., 2010\n\nAdvisor: Paul Feehan\n\nPosition: Senior Financial Advisor, Ernst & Young\n\nYuan Yuan\n\nOct., 2010\n\nAdvisor: Xiaojun Huang\n\nPosition: Assistant Professor, Johns Hopkins University\n\nPizza Seminar Talks 2009-10\n\nPriyam Patel and Kellen Meyers coordinated the Graduate Pizza Seminar in 2009-10. The Pizza Seminar is an intoxicating blend of free pizza and expository lectures by mathematics graduate students, for mathematics graduate students. The varied and interesting abstracts of the weekly talks are on line. We list below a few sample titles from Spring, 2010.\n\nEd Chien: Introduction to Special Relativity\n\nThom Tyrell: The Geometry behind Luroth's Theorem\n\nMarina Skyers: An Unsolved question in Algebra Solved by Algebraic Toplogy\n\nBrian Thompson: Let'Em Eat Cake: Fair, Envy-Free and Equitable Division\n\nMichael DeFreitas: The Irrational Number that Cost a Man His Life\n\nMoulik Balasubramanian: Distinct Zeros of Analytic Functions\n\nEdinah Gnang: Graph Isomorphism: A Problem at the Junction of Linear Algebra and Group Theory\n\nVed Datar: Fourier Transform and Some Applications\n\nJames Dibble: Cartography: The Drawing of Charts or Maps\n\nJanet Flores: Existence of (at least one) Non Unknot\n\nAwards and Prizes\n\nWesley Pegden won an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship, which he will use to study at NYU.\n\nWithin the Mathematics Department, Gabriel Bouch and Daniel Staley received the Spring, 2009 TA Teaching Excellence Awards; Wesley Pegden and Humberto Montalvan-Gamez received the Fall, 2009 TA Excellence Awards; and David Duncan and Beth Kupin received the Spring, 2010 TA Excellence Awards. Daniel Staley also received the Fall, 2009 Pizza Seminar Award; and Brian Thompson won the Spring, 2010 Pizza Seminar Award.\n\nPaul Feehan\n\nAdmissions – The number of applications for Fall 2010 admission increased by about 30% relative to last year, with a total of about 345 applications for admission. As of June 24, 2010, we expect an incoming class of 50, with 10 domestic students. Competition for the best qualified students was heightened by the addition of the new quantitative finance master's degree program offered by MIT. Our Admissions Committee comprised Professors Zheng-chao Han, Daniel Ocone, Shadi Tahvildar-Zadeh, and Paul Feehan. The quality of applications was high, with many applicants comfortably exceeding our required background in mathematics and programming which is already more stringent than that of all other leading programs.\n\nStaff – We are pleased to announce that we are close to appointing a new full-time Associate Director for Career Placement and Employer Relations, following a search for a replacement for Renee Williams, who resigned in March to take up a position as Assistant Dean for Scholastic Standing in the School of Arts and Sciences. We are very grateful to Heidi Benzinger, who stepped in at short notice to take over the position in a temporary capacity. Heidi also has a long career on Wall Street, most recently with positions in credit risk management at HypoVereinsbank and Radian Asset Management, where she was a Vice President. We are very grateful to Renee Williams for her previous leadership in this role for nearly two years and wish her continued success in her career at Rutgers.\n\nHeartfelt thanks are also due to Jesús Rodríguez, who is leaving Rutgers. The Mathematical Finance Program is very grateful to him for his wonderful organization of mathematical finance seminars and for his many contributions to MSMF and the department.\n\nThe student services component of our program continues to be expertly led by Ana Mastrogiovanni as Program Administrator, who joined in April 2008. Ana guides our students from the time of initial application through graduation. The program is directed by Professor Paul Feehan.\n\nPlacement – Since our program's inception in Fall 2006, 94 students have earned their Master of Science degree with Option in Mathematical Finance, with 51 graduating in January and May 2010. Despite the challenging economic climate, our graduates have fared well in the quantitative finance job marketplace: 100% of 2007 and 2008 graduates have been placed and of our 2009 graduates, all but two graduates have received and accepted employment offers. For 2010, 80% and 60% of our January and May graduates, respectively, have been placed to date. Firms hiring our students include Goldman Sachs, Bloomberg, R.G. Niederhoffer Capital Management, ING, Fidelity Investments, State Street Associates, Bank of New York Mellon, Blue Spruce Global Advisors and Deutsche Bank, just to name a few.\n\nNew Courses – In addition to our four required courses covering mathematical finance (Math 621-622) and numerical analysis (Math 573-574), our program now offers five elective courses for the MSMF curriculum:\n\nMath 623 – Computational Finance\n\nMath 624 – Credit Risk Modeling\n\nMath 625 – Portfolio Theory and Applications\n\nMath 628:01 – High-frequency finance and Stochastic Control\n\nMath 628:02 – Interest Rate Derivative Modeling\n\nEach course concludes with a final project rather than a final exam; the final project provides a practical training experience similar to that provided by a summer internship project at a top financial firm. Our instructors for the 2010-11 elective courses include: Dr. Anatoly Morosov for Math 624 (Executive Director at JP Morgan, PhD in Physics from Rutgers University), Dr. Arthur Robb for Math 625 (Executive Director at Morgan Stanley, PhD in Mathematics from Columbia University and BA in Mathematics from Rutgers University), Dr. Matt Cushman for Math 628:01 (Knight Equity Trading), and Dr. Viorel Costeanu for Math 628:02 (Associate at JP Morgan, with PhD in Mathematics from MIT), and Professor Paul Feehan for Math 623.\n\nA student's final course project serves as the basis for the required master's degree essay. We regularly update our required and elective courses in order to provide our students with a comprehensive choice and take into account the changing nature of the financial industry. Students continue to take courses offered by the Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Statistics, as well as Computer Science, Economics, Operations Research, Systems Engineering, and Finance in Rutgers Business School.\n\nTop Ten Ranking – The Mathematical Finance program at Rutgers University gained recognition in a widely syndicated article appearing in July 2008 in Advanced Trading magazine. Our program was named among the Top 10 programs of this type in the United States; the other programs in this elite group are offered by Berkeley, Carnegie-Mellon, Chicago, Columbia, Cornell, Michigan, NYU, Princeton, and Stanford.\n\nConference on Mathematical Finance and Partial Differential Equations – Our first conference on this theme was held on December 4, 2009, at the Heldrich Hotel, New Brunswick, and featured 12 speakers and 110 registered attendees, including industry practitioners and university faculty and students. The conference was co-organized by Professors Daniel Ocone and Paul Feehan (Rutgers) and sponsored by the master's degree program. A similar conference is planned for December 10, 2010, at the same venue.\n\nPh.D. Students – While our department does not offer a Ph.D. program in mathematical finance, two current Ph.D. students are pursuing mathematical finance as their research speciality and three have graduated, all under the direction of Professor Paul Feehan. One student is entering her fourth year while the other student is working full-time at Bloomberg. Two of three graduates have positions in a financial engineering group at Ernst & Young, while the third has returned to pursue an academic career in South Korea.\n\nPlease see our website for more information.\n\nThe Mathematics Department would like to thank its alumni and friends for their past generous support of the Department. Gifts to the Department enhance our ability to compete for the most outstanding undergraduates and graduate students, to bring outstanding mathematics faculty as visitors to the Department, and to support seminars and colloquia. If you would like to help us by making a general contribution to the department, you can do so online at the Rutgers Foundation website. In order to select 'Mathematics' on that page, be sure to click on :\n\nOr choose an academic department:\n\nIf you would like to discuss more specific purposes for a possible gift to the Department, please call the Department Chair, Michael Vogelius, at 732-445-2390 Ext. 2393.\n\nA special focus for Department fundraising is an effort to find a source of permanent support for our very successful summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs) program. This is an eight-week program that gives undergraduates the opportunity to get a taste of what it is like to do research in mathematics. The program includes both individual research and group activities. Each student is assisted by a faculty adviser and some also by a graduate-student adviser. Participating undergraduates receive free on-campus housing and a stipend, so that the total cost to the Department is approximately $5000 per student. Typically, about eight students participate each summer (nine in 2009). Although some support is provided by the National Science Foundation through the grants of participating faculty mentors, not all faculty mentors have such support. A permanent endowment would ensure that this program will continue to enrich the educational experiences of our best undergraduates."
