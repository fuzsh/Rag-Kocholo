        "text": "Like all living things on earth, Big Cats have their own classification. They are members of the Felidae (cat) family, and various groups (subfamilies and genus) within the Felidae family.\n\nImportant Note: The use of the term big cat can have different meanings. Originally, it was used to describe the four and only big cats that roared: lions, tigers, jaguars and leopards. Today it is often used in a general sense to describe the biggest wild cats. Big cats can also refer to all the cats in the Pantherinae subfamily (lion, tiger, jaguar, leopard, clouded leopard and Sunda clouded leopard) and the two biggest cats (cougar and cheetah) in the Felinae family (see chart below).\n\nBig cats taxonomy\n\nEvery living thing on earth has been named and classified. These biological classifications, also called taxonomy, show how different living things are related to each other. Big cats biological classification works the same way.\n\nThe classification of living things began with Aristotle over 2,300 years ago. He created two groups, animals and plants, and then divided the animals into three subgroups – animals that could fly, walk or swim. In the 1700s, a Swedish botanist named Carl Linnaeus created a system for describing and grouping taxa (organisms). Linnaeus is often referred to as the “father of taxonomy.”\n\nUsing this classification, Big Cats are members of the:\n\nAnimal Kingdom (multi-celled organisms that have nervous systems)\n\nChordata Phylum (groups having a similar body plan)\n\nVertebrata subPhylum (vertebrates – having a backbone or spinal column)\n\nMammalia Class (mammals – hair or fur, females produce milk for their young)\n\nCarnivora Order (meat-eaters)\n\nFeliformia subOrder (cat-like)\n\nFelidae Family (cats)\n\nThere are two Felidae subfamilies: Pantherinae and Felinae. You can find big cats in both subfamilies. Members of the Felinae family can purr but not roar. It is believed that the Pantherinae and Felinae separated from a common ancestor around 11.5 million years ago.\n\nThe Pantherinae subfamily\n\nThere are 7 big cats that are members of the Pantherinae subfamily: lions, tigers, jaguars, leopards, snow leopards, sunda clouded leopards and clouded leopards.\n\nThe subfamily Pantherinae has two genus – groups that have similar features and characteristics. The two genus are Panthera and Neofelis.\n\nLions, tigers, jaguars, leopards and snow leopards (as of 2017) are members of the Panthera genus. Clouded leopards and Sunda clouded leopards are members of the Neoflis genus.\n\nThe Felinae subfamily\n\nThere are 2 big cats that are members of the Felinae subfamily: cheetahs and cougars.\n\nThe cheetah is classified as a member of the genus Acinonyx in the Felinae subfamily and the cougar is classified as a member of the genus Puma in the Felinae subfamily. There are many more genus of small wild cats in this subfamily, including the domestic cat.\n\nDifferent types of species\n\nA species is an even smaller group of animals within a genus that can interbreed and produce offspring. Lions, tigers, jaguars, snow leopards, leopards, clouded leopards, Sunda clouded leopards, cheetahs and cougars are all different species.\n\nBig Cat Classification List\n\nBig Cat Family Subfamily Genus Species Abbreviated Lion Felidae Pantherinae Panthera Panthera leo P. leo Tiger Felidae Pantherinae Panthera Panthera tigris P. tigris Leopard Felidae Pantherinae Panthera Panthera pardus P. pardus Jaguar Felidae Pantherinae Panthera Panthera onca P. onca Clouded leopard Felidae Pantherinae Neofelis Neofelis nebulosa N. nebulosa Sunda clouded leopard Felidae Pantherinae Neofelis Neofelis diardi N. diardi Cheetah Felidae Felinae Acinonyx Acinonyx jubatus A. jubatus Cougar Felidae Felinae Puma Puma concolor P. concolor\n\nFelidae Cat Family Lineages\n\nMembers of the Felidae cat family have also been group into 8 different lineages. A lineage is a line of descent from a common ancestor. The 8 Felidae cat lineages are Panthera, Bay Cat, Caracal, Leopardus, Lynx, Puma, Leopard Cat and Felis. Tigers, lions, jaguars, leopards, snow leopards, clouded leopards and Sunda clouded leopards are part of the Panthera lineage. Cougars and cheethas are part of the Puma lineage."
