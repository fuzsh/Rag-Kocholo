        "text": "The interesting Fishing Cat (Prionailurus viverrinus) is found in patches across south and south east Asia.\n\nThis cat readily takes to water and dives and swims to catch fish, its principal prey. Although the Fishing Cat has partly webbed feet, this is not unique to this species and it does not appear to have any special adaptations for hunting in water.\n\nUnfortunately its dependence on wetland habitats means its populations are fast diminishing as wetlands across Asia are being drained for agriculture and human settlement."
