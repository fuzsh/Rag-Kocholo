Description of third instar larva. Body (Fig. 2B). Length 54.0–61.0 mm, dorsoventral interval of abdominal segments slightly larger than in thoracic segments (thus abdominal segments appear to be slightly thicker, abdominal segments VII and VIII are the thickest). Body only with short and few medium-sized setae. Setae on the dorsal side of body (with the exception of the ultimate segment) hair-like, setae of the ultimate abdominal segment and the ventral parts of body apically recurved, spatulate. Head capsule (Fig. 3B). Maximum width 5.0– 5.4 mm, glossy, yellowish brown or pale brown. Frontal sutures bisinuated. Epicranial insertions of antennal muscles indistinct, dorsally bordered with thin sickle-shaped line. Cranial chaetotaxy summarized in Table 1. Anterior and exterior frontal setae with minute single seta or absent. Antennae (Figs 3B; 9F). Relative length of antennomeres I–IV (an I–IV): an I> an IV> an II> an III), ultimate antennomere with ¿ve to ten dorsal and 8–14 ventral sensory spots. Epipharynx (Figs 4B; 12B,E). Haptomerum: Zygum convex, more or less protruding, with angulate row of 15–18 stout conical setae and several similar setae proximad to the row. Sensilla of zygum grouped in single group at the top of haptomerum. Acroparia: Lateral lobes of epipharynx with three to ¿ve long setae, medial lobe with four and four to ¿ve setae on ventral and dorsal side respectively. Acanthoparia with ¿ve to seven setae surrounded by moderately swollen base (or tubercle); the size of the tubercles as well as the setae increasing towards apex (of epipharynx). Chaetoparia: Asymmetric, right side composed of approximately 30–45 setae in three to ¿ve longitudinal rows and medial ¿eld (proximad to plate-shaped sclerite). Left side with approximately 30 setae in three to four rows. Both parts of chaetoparia with medial, more or less regular row of prominent long setae. Pedium large. Dexiotorma somewhat crooked, right pternotorma well developed. Laeotorma absent, left pternotorma well developed. Haptolachus: Sense cone (Fig. 12E) knob-like (low, but considerably broad at the base), with four pores. Plate-like sclerite large, occupying almost the entire area between sense cone and the regular rows on both sides of chaetoparia, however it can be less distinct in some specimens. Mandibles (Figs 6D–F; 7M–O; 13G). Stridulatory area well developed, with approximately twenty ridges (ridges in the proximal third less distinct and narrow). Scrobis with two to three lateral setae. Longitudinal furrow absent. Apical half of mandibles in dorsal aspect with two lateral setae and mediolateral depression (proximad to the base of the third scissorial tooth). Lateral outline of both mandibles with prominent external tooth. Maxilla (Figs 5B; 12H). Dorsal surface of cardo and labaocoparia with seven to eight, 28–34 setae, respectively. Ventral surface of cardo and labacoparia with two or three and 8 to 12 stiff setae, respectively. Dorsal surface of stipes with approximately 16 slender hair-like setae and one or two anterolateral stout setae. Maxillary stridulatory apparatus on stipes with six to seven spine-like stridulatory teeth (in dorsal aspect, Fig. 12H) and one blunt tubercle. Ventral surface of stipes with single proximal and one distal seta. Galear portion of mala in dorsal aspect beside large falcate uncus with four to ¿ve large stiff and three to ¿ve medium sized hair-like setae respectively. Lacinial part of mala with around 15–20 mostly long and stiff setae. Lacinial apex with single triangular uncus with two short conical, stout setae at the base and another single long, conical setae next to it. Ventral surface of mala with two longitudinal rows of three to four (seven) setae; setae of the exterior row long and stiff, setae of the interior row shorter and stout. Hypopharyngeal sclerome (Fig. 5B). Around ¿ve tegumentary expansions (phoba-like processes) present on the left lateral lobe of hypopharynx, the presence of tegumentary expansions on right medial portion scleroma individually variable. Ligula (Figs 5B; 13B). Dorsal surface with two lateral groups of around 10 hair-like setae, two paramedial setae at the apical margin and central group of setae and sensilla. This group is composed of two paramedial rows of approximately three stout and conical setae, and transverse, basomedial row with seven to eight conical setae. Thorax (Figs 2B; 6Q; 7T; 9N). Prothoracic sclerite with four (three) setae on the anteroventral margin and another single seta in the posterio-dorsal area. Each sublobe of prothorax dorsally with one or two rows of mostly short or medium-long setae interspersed with few long, hair-like setae. Thoracic spiracle (Fig. 6Q) 0.93 × 0.59 mm (height × width), bullar opening narrow, arms of respiratory plate almost concealed. Respiratory plate with approximately 30 holes across diameter. Venter of thorax and legs with spatulate setae. Pretarsus (Fig. 7T) conical with large falcate tip and two apical setae. Abdomen (Figs 2B; 10B; 11B). Each dorsal sublobe of abdominal segments I–VIII with two to three rows of setae. Setae in anterior row(s) short or medium-sized, posterior row also with several long setae. Dorsum of abdominal segment IX–X, as well as the entire ventral part of abdomen covered with spatulate medium-long setae. Spiracles on abdominal segments I–VI elongate, similar to thoracic spiracle, abdominal spiracles on segments VII–VIII almost circular. Raster (Figs 10B; 11B). Rows of pali absent, tegilla fused, covered with numerous short or medium-long spatulate setae.",
