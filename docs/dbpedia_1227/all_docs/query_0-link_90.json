Type locality: Indonesia, Java.\n\nEpeira diardi Full list of synonyms and usage of the name available in World Spider Catalog (2020).\n\nMaterial.\n\nThailand • 3 ♀; Chumphon Province, Sawi District, Wisai Tai ; 10°22.38'N, 99°03.61'E; MUMNH-ARA-GAS021 GoogleMaps • 3 ♀; Nakhon Ratchasima Province, Pak Chong District, Phaya Yen ; 14°36.97'N, 101°15.90'E; MUMNH-ARA-GAS022 GoogleMaps • 1 ♀; Nakhon Si Thammarat Province, Chang Klang District ; 08°19.27'N, 99°35.39'E; MUMNH-ARA-GAS104 GoogleMaps • 4 ♀; Nakhon Si Thammarat Province, Phra Phrom District ; 08°22.59'N, 099°52.72'E; MUMNH-ARA-GAS105 GoogleMaps • 1 ♀; Chiang Mai Province, Mae Chaem District ; 18°28.81'N, 98°22.96'E; MUMNH-ARA-GAS129 GoogleMaps • 4 ♀; Nakhon Ratchasima Province, Pak Chong District, Phaya Yen ; 14°36.97'N, 101°15.90'E; MUMNH-ARA-GAS132 GoogleMaps . Cambodia • 3 ♀; Kampot Province; 10°34.92'N, 104°07.21'E; MUMNH-ARA-GAS127 GoogleMaps .\n\nDiagnosis.\n\nSternum dark brown with small median yellow spot. Abdomen much wider than long. Dorsal side of abdomen dark brown. Edge of abdomen with few serrated spikes. Spines dark brown to orange. Anterior spines smallest, slightly directed obliquely. Median spines very large, covered with hairs, and arched backward. Posterior spines conical, pointed backward. Ventral side of abdomen dark brown with scattered yellow spots and small black granules. Ten anterior edge sigilla in total: four sigilla in the middle smaller, forming a straight line, three sigilla on each side larger, trapezoid. Four median sigilla arranged in a trapezoid, with two small sigilla situated on both lateral sides. Posterior edge with ten sigilla in total: six sigilla in the middle forming a straight line, the pair in the middle closely placed; two sigilla on each side larger, trapezoid. Outer posterior edge with five sigilla near posterior spines. Epigynum subtriangular with two lateral dark patches (Fig. 11D View Figure 11 ). Scape trapezoid, pointed posteriorly (Fig. 11F View Figure 11 ). Spermathecae round (Fig. 11D View Figure 11 ), ventrally partially overlapped by wing-shaped sclerotized structure (Fig. 11E View Figure 11 ). Copulatory ducts encapsulated by sclerotized structure (Fig. 11D View Figure 11 ). Fertilization ducts emerging posteriorly from spermathecae (Fig. 11D View Figure 11 ).\n\nVariation.\n\nFour morphotypes were found in this study: (1) the dark brown morph is the most common in Thailand. The dorsal abdomen is plain dark brown (Fig. 6A, B View Figure 6 ). This form is concordant with the description by Lucas (1835). (2) A dark red with stripes morph bears three thin yellow stripes near the anterior margin, between median spines, and in front of posterior sigilla (Fig. 6C View Figure 6 ). (3) A narrow horizontally banded morph bears three white and three black horizontal lines on dorsal abdomen (Fig. 6D View Figure 6 ). The first and the third white bands are very narrow. (4) A broad horizontally banded morph possesses three white and two black horizontal lines on dorsal abdomen (Fig. 6E View Figure 6 ). The median spines are bright orange. Ventral side of abdomen is decorated by bright yellow spots.\n\nRemarks.\n\nGasteracantha diardi can be distinguished from other broad-abdomen Gasteracantha by its large and posteriorly arched median spines, and two additional small sigilla beside the median trapezoid-shaped sigilla. The original description of G. diardi describes the plain dark brown morph specimens ( Lucas 1835). In this study, we report three additional color morphs other than the original description. These color morphs are confirmed by molecular phylogenetic analysis in this study (Fig. 4 View Figure 4 ).\n\nDistribution and habitat."
