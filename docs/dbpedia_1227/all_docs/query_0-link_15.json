        "meta_description": "Hyllus diardi is a species within the genus Hyllus, part of the family Salticidae, commonly known as jumping spiders. This species is among the larger jumping spiders, notable for its robust build and impressive jumping ability, which it uses both for hunting and avoiding predators. Hyllus diardi is characterized by a strong, muscular build, with females often being larger than males. Like other jumping spiders, it has excellent vision, facilitated by large anterior median eyes, which it uses to detect movement and detail from a distance.",

        "text": "Life Span:\n\nThe lifespan of jumping spiders, including Hyllus diardi, can vary but generally spans about 1-2 years, encompassing several stages from egg to adult.\n\nWeight and Length:\n\nHyllus diardi is one of the larger species of jumping spiders, with body lengths reaching up to about 1.2 cm for females, and slightly less for males. Specific weight data is rarely noted due to their small size.\n\nDistribution:\n\nHyllus diardi is found in Southeast Asia, including countries like Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia. Its habitat ranges from forests to shrublands and sometimes human-inhabited areas where it can find ample prey.\n\nHabits and Lifestyle:\n\nThis species is diurnal, actively hunting during the day. It does not spin webs to catch prey but rather uses its jumping ability to ambush or chase down insects. The spider uses silk for safety lines when jumping and for creating shelters or egg sacs.\n\nDiet and Nutrition:\n\nThe diet of Hyllus diardi consists primarily of small to medium-sized insects. They rely on their vision to spot prey and their agility to capture it, often leaping several times their body length to do so."
