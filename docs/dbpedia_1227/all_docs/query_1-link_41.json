        "text": "Ordering pets online can be nerve-wracking, we get it. Our 7-Day live guarantee is our way to ease nerves over the purchasing process.\n\nWe’re confident in the quality husbandry, shipping, and packaging of our livestock. On the rare occasion an animal arrives in poor condition, we will provide credit for the cost of that animal. If all animals in the shipment arrive in poor condition, we will also provide credit for the postage.\n\nWe try to make it as easy as possible to help any unwell critters, and ensure you can get your money back. There are a couple of steps to go through before a refund can be issued.\n\nIf you’ve received an unwell animal in the mail:\n\n1. If it is safe to do so, (your pet is not medically significant or harmful) please remove the animal from its transport container, ideally onto your hand. We ask this as invertebrates, particularly insects, are experts at ‘playing dead’.\n\n2. To provide you with the best advice going forward and to confirm the condition of your pet, we kindly request a short video of the animal in question before your refund can be processed. This can be uploaded on our ‘live guarantee refunds form’, or you can email it straight to us.\n\n3. We typically respond within 24 hours, but please allow 1-3 working days for a response. Once it’s confirmed that you are eligible for a refund, we’ll get process the credit to your account.\n\nWe’ll need this information to reach us within 7 days after you’ve received your pet. We cannot provide any live guarantee to animals that have been refused, returned, or not collected."
