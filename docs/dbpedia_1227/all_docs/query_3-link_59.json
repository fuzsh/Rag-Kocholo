        "text": "Lion\n\nLoudmouth\n\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\n\nAn adult lion’s roar can be heard up to five miles away.\n\nTiger\n\nNot a Copycat\n\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\n\nA tiger’s pattern is like a fingerprint—no two patterns of stripes are exactly the same.\n\nCheetah\n\nSuper-Charged\n\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\n\nA cheetah is the fastest land animal, reaching speeds over 60 miles per hour, and can pump out as many as four strides per second at top speed. They can accelerate faster than most cars!\n\nSnow Leopard\n\nJump-Start\n\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\n\nSnow leopards can leap as far as 50 feet—the length of a humpback whale.\n\nClouded Leopard\n\nHanging Out\n\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\n\nThese cats are excellent climbers. Using their large paws and sharp claws, they can even hang upside down beneath tree branches.\n\nJaguar\n\nJaw Power\n\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\n\nA jaguar’s jaws are strong enough to crack open tortoise shells—helping it get to one of its favorite treats.\n\nLeopard\n\nIn the Trees\n\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\n\nLeopards can stalk their prey—including antelopes and gazelles—drag it up, and eat it all in trees. This keeps their food safe from scavengers like hyenas.\n\nCougar\n\nName Game\n\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\n\nAlso known as mountain lions, panthers, and pumas, this secretive cat’s range stretches from the southern tip of South America up to the edge of the Yukon, a wild territory in northwest Canada.\n\nAwesome 8 videos"
