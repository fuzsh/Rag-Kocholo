        "text": "Widerrufsrecht und Umtausch\n\nIch akzeptiere Rückgaben, Umtäusche und Stornierungen\n\nKontaktiere mich einfach innerhalb von: 7 Tagen nach der Lieferung\n\nSende Artikel an mich zurück innerhalb von: 30 Tagen nach der Lieferung\n\nDatenschutzrichtlinie\n\nInformation I Collect\n\nTo fulfill your order, you must provide me with certain information, such as your name, email address, postal address, and the details of the product that you’re ordering. You may also choose to provide me with additional personal information (for a custom order, for example) if you contact me directly.\n\nWhy I Need Your Information and How I Use It\n\nI rely on a number of legal bases to collect, use, and share your information, including as needed to provide my services, such as when I use your information to fulfill your order or to provide customer support; when you have provided your affirmative consent, which you may revoke at any time, such as by signing up for my mailing list; if necessary to comply with a legal obligation or court order or in connection with a legal claim, such as retaining information about your purchases if required by tax law.\n\nInformation Sharing and Disclosure\n\nInformation about my customers is important to my business. I share your personal information for very limited reasons and in limited circumstances, as follows:\n\nService providers. I engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to my shop, such as delivery companies. I will share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these services.\n\nCompliance with laws. I may collect, use, retain, and share your information if I have a good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to: (a) respond to legal process or to government requests; (b) enforce my agreements, terms and policies; (c) prevent, investigate, and address fraud and other illegal activity, security, or technical issues; or (d) protect the rights, property, and safety of my customers, or others.\n\nData Retention\n\nI retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to provide you with my services and as described in my Privacy Policy. However, I may also be required to retain this information to comply with my legal and regulatory obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce my agreements. I generally keep your data for the following time period: 10 years.\n\nYour Rights\n\nIf you reside in certain territories, including the EU, you have a number of rights in relation to your personal information. While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply only in certain limited cases. I describe these rights below:\n\nAccess. You may have the right to access and receive a copy of the personal information I hold about you by contacting me using the contact information below.\n\nChange, restrict, delete. You may also have rights to change, restrict my use of, or delete your personal information. Absent exceptional circumstances (like where I am required to store data for legal reasons) I will generally delete your personal information upon request.\n\nObject. You can object to (i) my processing of some of your information based on my legitimate interests and (ii) receiving marketing messages from me after providing your express consent to receive them. In such cases, I will delete your personal information unless I have compelling and legitimate grounds to continue using that information or if it is needed for legal reasons.\n\nComplain. If you reside in the EU and wish to raise a concern about my use of your information (and without prejudice to any other rights you may have), you have the right to do so with your local data protection authority.\n\nHow to Contact Me\n\nFor purposes of EU data protection law, Bugs Direct Ltd, is the data controller of your personal information. If you have any questions or concerns, you may contact me via email.\n\nFAQs\n\nWholesale availability\n\nWe are primarily a wholesale supplier to collectors, artists, designers, educational institutions, museums, zoos, wildlife parks, and media. We welcome your wholesale enquiries.\n\nGift wrapping and packaging\n\nEvery order is carefully wrapped and supplied in a box.\n\nHow to spread dried butterflies\n\nDried unmounted butterflies, this term means the wings are closed and the butterfly is dehydrated. In order to open the wings, one must 'set' the butterfly. In order to set a butterfly, it must first be rehydrated. Place the butterfly inside an airtight tupperware box lined with moist kitchen paper. After a few days, the butterfly becomes rehydrated and it is only then the specimen's wings and antenna can be manipulated. Butterfly and insect setting is an art form and will undoubtedly take several attempts over time to achieve the desired form.\n\nPlease see our entomology equipment listings for useful tools. We also offer a range of display cases with glass lids to showcase your insect and butterfly collections!\n\nWhat equipment is needed for butterfly setting\n\nPlease see our entomology equipment listings for useful equipment such as pins, wax paper strips, setting needles, forceps, insect cement (for repairs), and setting boards in various sizes. We also offer a wide range of display cases with glass lids to showcase your entomology collections!\n\nExpress shipping\n\nWe typically ship via first class mail, this service can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to reach destinations worldwide. If you require extra fast shipping through courier please contact us prior to ordering so we can obtain a shipping quote.\n\nReturns and cancellations\n\nYour happiness is our priority. If for any reason you are not satisfied with your purchase just reach out to our happy team and we will refund, replace or exchange with no questions asked.\n\nMuseums and education\n\nFor over twenty years we have been supplying insect specimens to entomologists, collectors, artists, museums, zoos, and universities for study and DNA analysis.\n\nArtists and designers\n\nWe work with artists and designs at home and internationally. Working to a strict code of ethics, we can ensure specimens supplied to artists and the industry meet these high levels. Our butterflies and insects can be found in the works of renound artists and haute couture fashion houses worldwide.\n\nEthically sourced\n\nWe source from rearing projects and through ethical collecting methods that support native habitats in Thailand, in-turn providing rural villages income and an alternative to slash and burn agriculture.\n\nConservation & Community Through Butterfly Farming\n\nButterfly farming addresses the needs of both the conservationist and the paying collector with the added benefit of enhancing the livelihoods and environment for the farmers themselves and many members of the local community. Butterfly farms are found all over the world but the largest are in countries where areas of tropical rain forest are home to a huge variety of magnificent butterflies: Kenya, Madagascar, Peru and Thailand. Each of these countries is subject to the devastating effects of deforestation but the positive impact that butterfly farming has had on the incomes of the indigenous people has introduced them to an alternative method of survival which no longer involves the unsustainable exploitation of their environment."
