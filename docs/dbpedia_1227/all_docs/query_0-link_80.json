        "meta_description": "Gasteracantha diardi is a species within the genus Gasteracantha, part of the orb-weaver spider family (Araneidae). Spiders in this genus are commonly known as spiny orb-weavers due to their distinctive hard, spiny abdomens. Gasteracantha diardi, like its congeners, is recognized for its unique and colorful appearance, which serves both as a deterrent to predators and a fascinating subject for human observation. Gasteracantha diardi, like other spiny orb-weavers, features a hard, spiny abdomen, often brightly colored or patterned. These physical characteristics are thought to play a role in predator deterrence and possibly in attracting mates. The spiders construct orb-shaped webs, which are used to capture prey.",

        "text": "Life Span:\n\nThe lifespan of Gasteracantha diardi, like many orb-weaver spiders, typically spans about a year, allowing for the cycle of mating, egg-laying, and the emergence of new spiders within a single season.\n\nWeight and Length:\n\nSpiny orb-weavers are relatively small, with the body size (excluding leg span) not usually exceeding a few centimeters. The spines add to their perceived size but not significantly to their weight.\n\nDistribution:\n\nGasteracantha diardi is found in parts of Southeast Asia. Its distribution is influenced by habitat suitability, including the presence of vegetation suitable for web construction.\n\nHabits and Lifestyle:\n\nThese spiders are diurnal, spending the daylight hours maintaining their webs, catching prey, or sitting in the center of the web. They may rebuild or repair their webs frequently.\n\nDiet and Nutrition:\n\nThe diet consists mainly of flying insects that become ensnared in their webs. The web’s structure and placement are crucial for the spider’s success in capturing a variety of flying insects."
