        "text": "The Sunda clouded leopard, also known as the tree tiger or branch tiger, inhabits Kalimantan/Malaysia and Sumatra, islands located in western Indonesia and a biogeographical region known as Sundaland.\n\nThe cats are usually found in hilly and forest areas. It is estimated that there are less than 10,000 Sunda clouded leopards living in the wild.\n\nScientific Name: Neofelis diardi\n\nConservation Status: Vulnerable, decreasing population.\n\nMeaning of the Name\n\nSunda Clouded Leopard – Sunda (Sundaland) is a region of Southeast Asia. The word leopard is a compound of “leo” (lion) and “pardus” (panther). Clouded leopard refers to the spots on the cat’s fur which look like clouds.\n\nSome Sunda clouded leopard facts\n\nFur is greyer than a clouded leopard\n\nTheir markings are smaller than a clouded leopard\n\nHas long canine teeth which, relative to it’s skull, is longer than those of any other living cat.\n\nThe Sunda clouded leopard’s tail can grow as long as its body.\n\nAbout Sunda clouded leopards\n\nWhat they look like\n\nThe Sunda clouded leopard has an overall stocky appearance with short legs. The cat weighs between 26 to 55 lbs. and is considered a medium-sized cat compared to other wild cats. Because of its size, you will sometimes find it on a list of big cats (lions, tigers, etc.). The Sunda clouded leopard has long teeth – around 2 inches in length, and a long tail. Its greyish fur has uneven shaped oval markings with dark edges, similar to the shape of a cloud, which is why it is called a “clouded” leopard. The cat’s markings are smaller and not as vibrant as China’s clouded leopard.\n\nWhere Sunda clouded leopards live\n\nSunda clouded leopards inhabit two large islands in Indonesia, Kalimantan (Borneo)/Malaysia and Sumatra. In Borneo that cat can be found in forests below 5,000 ft. In Sumatra, the cat inhabits somewhat hilly and mountainous areas.\n\nHunting and diet\n\nSunda clouded leopard prey includes deer, pigs, civets, monkeys, porcupine and fish. It is believed the cat hunts mostly on the ground, but will climb up trees to escape danger.\n\nReproduction and lifespan\n\nNot much is known about this solitary cat. It’s lifespan is estimated at 11 to up to 17 years.\n\nSunda clouded leopard conservation\n\nA key conservation issue for the Sunda clouded leopard is loss of habitat due to deforestation.\n\nExperts believe that as much as 30% of lowland forests have been lost in the region over the past ten years, due to new settlements. Forest destruction has also been caused by an increase in oil palm plantations.\n\nEven though the cat is protected in Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei, another threat is illegal trade. The cat’s skin and body parts are used in Asian medicine."
