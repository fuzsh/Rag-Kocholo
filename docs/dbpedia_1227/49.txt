Origin: Eyelash Jumping Spiders (Hyllus diardi) are native to Southeast Asia, primarily inhabiting regions like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.

Temperature: These spiders thrive in a warm and humid environment. The ideal temperature for keeping Eyelash Jumping Spiders is around 75-85 degrees Fahrenheit (24-29 degrees Celsius).

Housing: To keep Eyelash Jumping Spiders as pets, you'll need an enclosure that provides enough space for them to move around comfortably. A terrarium or glass enclosure with proper ventilation works well. Ensure that the enclosure is securely sealed to prevent escapes. Substrate, like coconut fiber or peat moss, should be added for burrowing and humidity retention. Decorate the enclosure with branches and leaves to create a natural environment. Regular misting to maintain humidity levels and a temperature-regulated heat source, such as a heat pad, are essential for their well-being.
