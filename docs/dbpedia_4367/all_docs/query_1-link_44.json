        "text": "Heaton is a district and suburb in the city of Newcastle upon Tyne, in Tyne and Wear, England, two miles (three kilometres) east of the city centre. It is bordered by the neighbouring areas of Walkergate to the east, Jesmond to the north west, Byker to the south, and Sandyford to the west. The name Heaton means high town, referring to the area \"being situated on hills above the Ouseburn, a tributary of the River Tyne.\" The area is divided into South Heaton, and High Heaton, representing the north, respectively. For city council elections, the area is split between three wards: Heaton, Manor Park and Ouseburn. Until 1974 it was in Northumberland.\n\nHistory\n\nIn the 12th century Heaton became part of the Barony of Ellingham granted by Henry I to Nicholas de Grenville. King John is claimed to have stayed in the castle at Heaton (the remains of which can still be seen in Heaton Park) on a number of occasions. In the 17th century the Heaton estate was purchased by Henry Babington who was knighted at Heaton Hall by James I on 1 May 1617.\n\nBy the 18th century, Heaton was a coal mining area with many of its collieries owned by Matthew White and Richard Ridley, then by his son Matthew Ridley. The Heaton estate was broken up in 1835 when the area became part of Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1841 much of the land in Heaton was owned by Armorer Donkin, who on his death in 1851 bequeathed it to his business partner, the industrialist Sir William Armstrong.\n\nIn 1879, the corporation acquired part of the Heaton Hall estate, which was then laid out as Heaton Park, and Sir William Armstrong donated Armstrong Park and Jesmond Dene to the city. The three parks run into each other to form a green corridor through east Newcastle.\n\nGeography\n\nA distinction is often made between High Heaton, and the rest of Heaton, although both technically fall within Heaton. The rest of Heaton is sometimes referred to as South Heaton, although the term has not been seen used in official city council documents.\n\nNotable landmarks in Heaton include the Wills Building, which was originally constructed in 1946â€“1950 as a cigarette factory and was redeveloped in 1999 as luxury apartments.\n\nGovernance\n\nFor the purposes of city council elections, Heaton was divided into two electoral wards, North Heaton and South Heaton.\n\nHowever, boundary changes to all wards in Newcastle upon Tyne were implemented at the city council elections in May 2018, with the majority of Heaton now falling in the Heaton ward, and High Heaton in the Manor Park ward. A small part of Heaton, close to Shields Road, falls within the Ouseburn ward. All city council wards are represented by three councillors.\n\nFor Parliamentary elections, Heaton is within the Newcastle East constitutency.\n\nHeaton was formerly a township in the parish of Newcastle-All Saints, in 1866 Heaton became a separate civil parish, on 1 April 1914 the parish was abolished to form Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1911 the parish had a population of 21,912. In 1974 it became part of the metropolitan district of Newcastle upon Tyne.\n\nDemography\n\nHeaton is a mixed working class and middle class area. In recent years it has become a popular residence for many students attending the city's two universities, Newcastle University and Northumbria University. Rent and property prices are generally lower than in the neighbouring areas of Jesmond and Sandyford, but higher than in Byker.\n\nEconomy\n\nDuring the 19th century, the building of the railways saw a line pass through Heaton, now the East Coast Main Line. Heaton also has a major rail depot. Heaton became the location of Sir Charles Parsons engineering works producing turbines which was founded in 1889.\n\nThird Avenue was the birthplace of the Ringtons Tea business.\n\nThe main commercial street in Heaton is Chillingham Road which benefits from local amenities including two small supermarkets, a number of small shops and newsagents, hairdressers, takeaways, cafes, restaurants and public houses. Heaton Road is also becoming a notable commercial street.\n\nEducation\n\nHeaton has a large secondary school, Heaton Manor School, recently renamed Jesmond Park Academy, although many children in Heaton attend Benfield School, located on the Heaton/Walkergate boundary. There are also a number of primary schools spread over the area: Ravenswood Primary School, Chillingham Road Primary School, Hotspur Primary School and St. Teresa's Primary School.\n\nDespite austerity, Heaton retains an autism-friendly library in High Heaton with 3-hour computer access and a range of fiction and non-fiction books available.\n\nIn 1932, Henderson Hall was opened as halls of residence for Newcastle University.\n\nSport\n\nHeaton was home to Newcastle United under their previous name, Newcastle East End F.C., between 1886 and 1892. East End played at the Heaton Junction Ground on Chillingham Road before moving to St James' Park.\n\nTwo Northern League football clubs play in areas neighboring Heaton. Heaton Stannington F.C. play in High Heaton, while Newcastle Benfield F.C. play next door to Benfield School.\n\nHeaton is also home to amateur rugby football club Medicals RFC, based in Cartington Terrace.\n\nReligion\n\nHeaton is home to RC and CofE churches, and the Heaton Mosque and Islamic Centre.\n\nTransport\n\nHeaton was originally served by Heaton railway station, which was on the main line from Newcastle Central to Edinburgh Waverley. The station was closed on 11 August 1980, when the Tyne & Wear Metro system opened. Heaton is now served by the Chillingham Road Metro station, and Byker Metro station which is closer for some in South Heaton. Heaton is also served by a variety of bus routes, including routes 1, 62 and 63, which link Heaton to Newcastle City Centre and areas in the west of Newcastle.\n\nHealthcare\n\nHeaton Road Surgery was graded 'outstanding' in 2015 by the Care Quality Commission. The Freeman Hospital, Newcastle's second largest major hospital, is in High Heaton.\n\nNotable people"
