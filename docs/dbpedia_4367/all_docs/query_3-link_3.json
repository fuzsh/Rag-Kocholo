        "text": "Chas Chandler, a veteran British rock musician whose bass playing helped the Animals to fame with the 1964 hit \"The House of the Rising Sun,\" died today at Newcastle General Hospital. He was 57.\n\nHe was undergoing tests related to an aortic aneurysm, said Keith Altham, a friend.\n\nMr. Chandler was playing in the Alan Price Trio in 1962 when the vocalist Eric Burdon joined the band. They renamed the group the Animals and scored a major success with \"Rising Sun,\" a song about a New Orleans brothel.\n\n\"We toured nonstop for three years, 300 gigs a year, and we hardly got a penny,\" Mr. Chandler told a newspaper, The Independent, in 1994. When the group split up in 1966, Mr. Chandler turned to managing other rock stars. After meeting Jimi Hendrix, he recruited the drummer Mitch Mitchell and the bassist Noel Redding to form the Jimi Hendrix Experience.\n\nMr. Chandler produced the first two Hendrix albums, \"Are You Experienced?\" and \"Axis: Bold as Love,\" but quit halfway through \"Electric Ladyland,\" frustrated by the hangers-on and endless re-recording of tracks. Mr. Hendrix died in London in 1970."
