        "text": "Bryan ''Chas'' Chandler also known as Dark Chas is one of the main characters in The Animals Series franchise, is a member of The Dark Animals, being one of the main antagonists of The Animals Series, The New Adventures of The Animals and its spin-offs. Dark Chas is the bassist of The Dark Animals as well the most tallest member of The Dark Animals and Chas Chandler's evil counterpart. Bryan/Chas is also Dark Chasie's love interest.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nDark Chas has the same appearance as his original version, having brown hair, a nose, green eyes, and Caucasian (white) skin. He wears a black and dark red/red outfit, wears a black jacket, his shirt is dark red, In his dark red or red shirt, he also has a devil shape (like Dark Hilton), but in white, black pants, wears a lanyard with a purple cross symbol around his neck, his bracelets are black with red dark (or red) and his sneakers are black with dark red (or red).\n\nIn his new outfit appearance, he wears a black jacket, his shirt is dark red (or sometimes black), with black and dark red colors, his pants are black and dark red, as well as his sneakers/shoes are the same black and dark red color.\n\nIn his outfit, Dark Chas remains wearing the same current outfit from the fourth season, the only difference is that he wears new black and dark red shoes.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nDark Chas is Chas Chandler's representation of his evil negative feelings, he would be exactly if Chas didn't have support, love or affection from his friends and family. He is a evil, brute, aggressive, menacing, cruel and abusive bully who doesn't mind intimidating, barbarizing and tearing down people he sees as weak or inferior to him, like Mike Jeffery. Furthermore, Dark Chas is arrogant, merciless and is a bully who constantly enjoys getting into fights or creating trouble for others making him the most aggressive member of the Dark Animals and also being the most violent. Because of his height and his brute and physical strength used for evil, Dark Chas can intimidate anyone who threatens him or any of his friends, especially Dark Eric. He is also ruthless, sarcastic, and unapologetic, and he is also irredeemable at becoming good. Dark Chas is evil and does evil by nature and for pleasure, he also seems to be very sadistic, as he also enjoys seeing others suffer and doesn't care about his victims, showing his cold, hard and cruel side.\n\nDark Chas is in fact the second coldest and cruelest member of the Dark Animals, second only to their leader, Dark Eric and in fact enjoys mocking and mocking his victims like Mike Jeffery or his good-natured counterpart, Chas Chandler.\n\nWhen Dark Chas turns into a wolf along with his friends, he gains a predatory personality, who wants to kill and devour The Animals, so that no one gets in the way of the machiavellian group's goals.\n\nDark Chas in this wolf form is also cunning and sinister, helping Dark Eric steal Valentine's magic wand to transform The Dark Animals into their human form again.\n\nDark Chas, like his friends, also wants to be one of the most dangerous criminals and evil musicians in all of London and the world. With Chandler's murder, he could usurp Chandler's place and tarnish his image as a musician, just as the Dark Animals could usurp their good selves.\n\nDark Chas is a guy of pure evil and without redemption, because he is the opposite of Chas Chandler, he is unable to become good, because of his violent, aggressive and cold nature, makes him one of the most sinister and sadistic villains of the franchise.\n\nHe can be also a vain like Dark Eric, but not much like him.\n\nDark Chas is the most aggressive, hot-tempered, violent, and hot-headed member. He is very impatient and doesn't like to wait and often acts on impulse, acts without thinking. However, his height and his intimidating personality is feared by some of his victims, among them, the arrested criminals since some of them show that they are afraid of him and Dark Chas takes pleasure in tormenting and frightening others due to his height and physical strength.\n\nHis insane and cruel personality makes him one of the most diabolical members of the Dark Animals. He has a very blustery, stormy personality and is also \"short tempered\" as he takes pleasure in making fun of the victims he and his friends have manipulated as was the case with Mike Jeffery.\n\nIn wolf form in the second season of The New Adventures of The Animals, he proved to be meaner and more aggressive, as he controlled the army of wolves alongside his friends. Showing his power-hungry and extremely psychotic side. He is highly ambitious and to reach higher goals he is capable of anything including power and evil. He is loud, wild and hostile towards Chas Chandler, his good version and at the same time takes sadistic pleasure in mocking or antagonizing him.\n\nHe also tends to take revenge and also tease. When Alan sometimes teases him and Eric, Chas also makes snide remarks towards his friend Alan. And he, like Eric, only provokes Eric when he is provoked. However, already a single exception, on a single occasion, he teases Alan for no reason in episode 35 since he was the one who started the confusion, but after that he apologizes to his friend and both understand each other. This leads to the understanding that just like Dark Alan, Dark Chas also likes to create confusion and intrigue. Despite the teasing, Dark Chas still maintains an evil friendly relationship with Dark Alan and on some occasions they go out together.\n\nIn The Dark Animals Mini Series, in the last episode, where he and his friends definitely lose their healing powers. He is frustrated and furious as he has a fascination with power and that he had chances to see his ambition grow even more. With or without power, Dark Chas is still ambitious and sees that he and the Dark Animals can become stronger without the use of spells.\n\nHis best friends are Dark Hilton and Dark Eric and are the most recent villain trio in the series. He is seen hanging out the most with the two, especially their leader Dark Eric. He never seems bothered by Dark Eric's scent of being the leader of the group, on the contrary he has a very strong mutual respect for his friend and he hesitates to follow his leadership and his orders without hesitation.\n\nDark Chas despite being the most aggressive member and being very easy to get angry, he manages to control his anger, most of the time he is seen very calm, while he is calm on the outside, his inner anger is inside him.\n\nHis symbol is the thunderbolt, which reflects his violent, explosive, stormy, but also cruel personality very well. Dark Chas is very mean and is not afraid to expose his actions to framing an innocent. Just as he is willing to frame an innocent person so that he can get away with it, as he did with Tyrone, the British black man who was arrested for revenge and killed for a noble cause (killed white people who were racist) fell into a trap by The Dark Animals, like Dark Chas at one point disappeared, but in reality he just \"disappeared\" to steal the very expensive phone and put it in Tyrone's pants pocket and as a result framing Tyrone and taking him back to jail (once he only got out of jail because he got permission from Judge Rodney Ross as The Dark Animals promised to help with their revenge plan against the \"whites\"), he is seen along with The Dark Animals taking sadistic and cruel pleasure in mocking Tyrone and victims of their misdeeds.\n\nDark Chas, as well as the rest of the Dark Animals seem to have warmed to the idea of becoming a married woman's lover (or dating woman) as they plan to flirt and seduce more women only to destroy couples' relationships.\n\nHe is quite cruel and sadistic as he was in his interaction with Afro-British businessman Jimmy Pinshead, this was called a ''cuckold'' by Dark Chas and the Dark Animals due to the fact that Gloria had betrayed Jimmy with the Dark Animals, which it gave him sadistic and satisfied pleasure to have seduced and flirted with Gloria even though he and his friends only became Gloria's lovers in order to get money from her, because she is rich and so that the ''economy'' and the Dark Animals return to grow. He has a female dark red snake named Layla.\n\nDark Chas is sarcastic, extremely homicidal, murderous, vengeful, serious, mean, greedy, arrogant, power-hungry, ambitious, cold and ruthless and his evil and ruthless attitudes make him one of the most ambitious and dangerous villains in the series.\n\nIt is revealed that he and the Dark Animals have hypnosis ability, shown in episodes 67 and 68 of the fifth season, showing that he and the Dark Animals can manipulate and control the Animals through hypnosis.\n\nIn episode 93, he and his friends finally declare that they truly fall in love with the Dark Angels again, with Dark Chas once again becoming Dark Chasie's boss and romantic interest.\n\nHowever, his infatuation with Dark Chasie is temporary, although he is shown to be truly in love with her, his infatuation with her is temporary. Furthermore, in episode 95, he is seen mocking and laughing at The Animals' romantic feelings, along with Dark Alan and the other The Dark Animals.\n\nThis shows that his heartless and cruel personality is still highly present even though he is in a ''temporary love'' with Dark Chasie. In episode 95, he is shown to be a very sadistic trickster and manipulator, disguising himself as Emma Hawkins, one of the Girly Girls' backing vocalists with the intention of destroying The Animals' friendship by making everyone fight each other to see which She is the prettiest of the Girly Girls.\n\nDark Chas also shows himself to be a cheater, in episode 82, he and the Dark Animals help Dark Eric win a race against John Steel, to win the prize that contains paid vacations and money, with money being the main reason for them to participate. of the race. He likes cheating and is proud to be a cheater like his friends. Since he was little, Dark Chas already had a malevolent personality, in episode 52, a flashback is seen of him and the other Dark Animals, all children, but they already had evil in their hearts, what is implied is that they all met in an orphanage and who already had an evil personality, possibly since they were babies.\n\nHe is also seen as the angriest when the Dark Animals' plans fail, which shows his impatient, explosive, stormy and temperamental personality as to why he is the most violent of the Dark Animals. Dark Chas also enjoys power and ambition, and sadistically takes pleasure in killing, torturing, and tormenting The Animals for fun, especially Chas Chandler, his good self. He also likes to corrupt people, just like the rest of The Dark Animals, who also take pleasure in corrupting one of The Animals to be their ''temporary ally''.\n\nHe however, likes to help Dark Eric in his evil plans and is just as ambitious, greedy , power hungry and sadistic as he is. Because, Dark Chas is also willing to kill The Animals or anyone who gets in his way (or in the Dark Animals' way) either for fun/antagonism, in the case of The Animals, he tries to kill The Animals either for fun /pure evil or antagonism, but also to usurp their place and force fans of Chandler and The Animals to listen to the Dark Animals' dark music or to evolve into a more serious evil plan such as possibly the conquest of England or the world.\n\nUnlike Chas Chandler, his good version, he is called Bryan (his real name) recently, while Chas is called Bryan (also his real name) more rarely.\n\nBryan/Chas and his friends were born evil, as he is the truly negative and evil counterpart to the original and good Chas Chandler who is peaceful, Dark Chas represents what Chas would have become if he didn't have the support and love of his friends and family, it would be mean. Dark Chas is evil by birth like his friends, as he always makes The Animals hell for no reason, just as his evil friends also like to make the protagonists' lives hell and torment them, if the villain group's plans, such as usurping The Animals' place and forcing If their fans hear his evil music or a more cruel plan like taking over the world doesn't turn out the way he and the Dark Animals want, Bryan and the Dark Animals have the goal of making their good counterparts' lives hell for no reason as a recurring option. it's frequent. Chas, like the rest of the Dark Animals likes to try and kill The Animals, as he and his friends try to kill their good counterparts just for fun and pleasure.\n\nBryan's relationship with the Dark Animals is a ''sibling'' relationship. Since they are always together and one of them is rarely seen alone devising evil plans for the group or evil plans for each member.\n\nDark Chas loves his pet, Layla, but after he discovered that she is a snake that can talk (shown in episode 100) and that she is half magical, he became more excited and excited about her and loves her more and more, as he feels that Now, as your pet Layla can speak, she can help with Dark Chas's evil plans and also the evil plans of the other Dark Animals.\n\nIn recent seasons, he has also become more serious and much more aggressive. In the ninth season, he and his friends gain snake abilities and become much more violent and power-hungry. As well as becoming more psychopathic, power-hungry and more ambitious, after he acquires his snake abilities after being bitten by his magical talking snake, Layla.\n\nIn the tenth season, he is called Bryan (his real name) more than his nickname, Chas. In this tenth season, he still maintains his cold, cruel, unfriendly and snobbish behavior and personality, but Bryan / Dark Chas has also become much more arrogant.\n\nIn the tenth season, Dark Chas shows his sadism increasing, as he intends to conquer the world alongside his friends and torment The Animals for pure fun, showing how evil he is, without caring if his evil actions will harm innocent people.\n\nBryan was also impressed and pleased with the Dark Angels and especially his female version, Bryana, for killing people, so Bryan and the rest of the Dark Animals decided to promote their female versions, despite the fact that he despises Bryana.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nDark Chas is the tallest member of Dark Animals, as well as the bassist of the same group,\n\nHe is the only one of the Dark Animals who has not changed the front of his hair in Season 8.\n\nDespite being one of the (five) main antagonists of the series, Dark Chas can also be considered one of the two secondary antagonists (alongside Dark Hilton), with Chas being the main secondary antagonist.\n\nHe is one of two Dark Eric's right-hand men (trust men), the other is Dark Hilton.\n\nHe and his good counterpart, Chas Chandler both of them was born in Newcastle upon Tyne like Eric and Dark Eric.\n\nHis symbol is the thunderbolt.
