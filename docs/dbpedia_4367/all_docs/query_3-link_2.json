        "text": "The Animals were a landmark British band in the 1960s rock revolution and produced one of its enduring hits, House of the Rising Sun. It reached No 1 in June 1964 and made the Top 30 on being re-released in 1972 and 1982.\n\nThe band's break-up led Chandler to turn to management, and he came across Jimi Hendrix playing in New York's Greenwich Village. He produced Hendrix's first four albums.\n\nAfter Hendrix died in London in 1970, Chandler took charge of the British group Slade. Under his wing, they became one of the great British hitmakers of the 1970s with six chart-topping singles.\n\nChandler, who leaves a widow and three children and a 27-year-old son by an earlier marriage, later set up Park Arena Ltd with old friend Nigel Stanger, who once played saxophone with the Animals.\n\nThis spawned the development of Newcastle Arena, the North-east's first large-scale covered entertainment and sports venue, which began operations at the end of last year and was officially opened by the Duchess of Kent.\n\nKeith Altham, a friend for 35 years and a former press agent, said he understood Chandler had been in hospital for tests and a check-up relating to an aortic aneurysm, an enlargement of his main artery, a few years ago.\n\n``This has come as a great shock to everyone. He was a lovely man and a sterling character.\n\n``What always struck me was his amazing enthusiasm which drove him to achieve things for the people he represented. He never gave less than 100%''.\n\nNoddy Holder, lead singer with Slade, said: ``He was the motivator behind our success. When other people said we wouldn't make it, he had confidence and was forever pushing us.''\n\nJim Lea, who co-wrote all Slade's hits and was the band's bass guitarist, said: ``Chas was a big personality and he had big ideas. He worked hard, he played hard, and he will be greatly missed by everyone who knew him.''\n\nAn associate from his Hendrix management days said: ``It needed someone like Chas to get Jimi off the ground. I don't know whether anybody else could have done it.\n\n``Chas had a mixture of charm and aggressiveness and, I don't care what anybody says, Jimi Hendrix would not have been Jimi Hendrix without him - his career would not have got started.''\n\nChandler worked as a turner at Tyneside's Swan Hunter shipyard and Parson's engineering works before becoming a full-time musician.\n\nThe Animals started as The Alan Price Combo, changing their name in 1963. They were a sensation at Newcastle's former Club a Go Go. A plaque honouring them is now on the site of that venue in the city's Percy Street.\n\nThree months after signing their first record deal with Mickie Most in January 1964, the band had their first hit, Baby Let Me Take You Home.\n\nIt went no further than No 21 but two months later House of the Rising Sun soared to the top.\n\nThey went on to become only the second UK group, after the Beatles, to crack the American charts.\n\nOver the next two years they had six more Top-10 hits in the UK, including Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood, I'm Crying, Bring It On Home To Me, It's My Life, and Don't Bring Me Down.\n\nChandler once recalled how he really felt they'd made it when We've Gotta Get Out of This Place, which reached No 2 in the UK in July 1965, became a poignant favourite with war-weary American troops in Vietnam.\n\nBut the band became ripped apart by rows. Gravel-voiced lead singer Eric Burdon and keyboard player Alan Price went in pursuit of solo careers which continue to this day.\n\nObituary20"
