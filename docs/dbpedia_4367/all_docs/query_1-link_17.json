Widely regarded as the greatest and most influential guitarist in rock history, Jimi Hendrix was born on November 27, 1942 in Seattle, Washington, to African-American parents Lucille (Jeter) and James Allen Hendrix. His mother named him John Allen Hendrix and raised him alone while his father, Al Hendrix, was off fighting in World War II. When his mother became sick from alcoholism, Hendrix was sent to...",

        "text": "Hendrix played left-handed, much to the chagrin of his father, who believed that playing left-handed was a sign of the Devil! As Jimi's brother witnessed, Jimi played right-handed when his father was present. After the elder Hendrix left the room, Jimi would use his famous left hand. However, Jimi wrote with his right hand.\n\nJimi Hendrix and Engelbert Humperdinck had a mutual respect for each other's work. So when a guitarist didn't turn up for an Engelbert Humperdinck concert, Jimi offered to step in. Engelbert thought it might damage Jimi's image, so Jimi played behind a curtain, he also restrained himself from doing any trademark licks and played in the orchestral style of an Engelbert Humperdinck song.\n\nHe was a huge fan of Bob Dylan, often to the annoyance of friends and girlfriends as he would play Dylan's records again and again. Many say they can hear the influence of Dylan in Hendrix's lyrics. Hendrix often played \"Like a Rolling Stone\" at shows, but one of the legendary guitarist's best known songs was his cover of Dylan's \"All Along the Watchtower\" (Dylan today performs the song as a Hendrix tribute.).\n\nToured with The Monkees in 1967 as their opening act, in the weeks before his Monterey performance; disliking their music at first, Hendrix was surprised that the Monkees would invite him (They all but demanded his presence on tour from their managers.) He and the group hit it off well, though, and found each other to be genuine, impressive, and good company (Some jamming did happen offstage, but none was recorded.) Hendrix's act proved far less a match with the Monkees' fans, though, and performances sometimes unraveled among relentless cries for the headliners. Hendrix asked to leave the tour, to begin his own after Monterey; he left on good terms, but a story was concocted by the Monkees' press corps that Hendrix was out because of protests from the Daughters of the American Revolution, about his wild stage act -- an inside joke, and some extra publicity for Hendrix.\n\nDavid Gilmour of Pink Floyd lists him as a major influence. When Gilmour saw Hendrix playing in a London nightclub in 1966, he said that nobody who saw that performance left the club not thinking that Hendrix would go all the way to the top.\n\nHendrix and Pete Townshend of The Who got into a heated argument over who was going to follow whom at the Monterey Pop Festival. Neither artist wanted to follow the other, so John Phillips flipped a coin to decide who was going to go on. Townshend won, so Hendrix had to follow The Who, and he answered their usual end-of-show instrument smashing by setting his guitar on fire during the last song.\n\nIn spite of his legendary status, he only had one top 40 hit in the United States with \"All Along the Watchtower\", which reached #20 on the singles chart. Although his albums were quite successful in the United States with \"Electric Ladyland\" reaching #1 on the albums chart, his singles did not achieve the same success. Conversely, both his albums and singles were very successful in the United Kingdom.\n\nHis song \"Voodoo Chile\" stunned a young boy who would later be inspired to play guitar and join a band. The boy was Dave Murray of Iron Maiden, and he recalls that when he heard that song on the radio for the first time, his reaction was, 'Bloody hell? What is THAT? How do you do THAT?'.\n\nWhen Jimi first moved to England, he would often stay with his manager, Chas Chandler, in his hometown of Newcastle upon Tyne. He often busked in the Heaton area of Newcastle near Chillingham Road, not far from where Chandler grew up and went to school."
