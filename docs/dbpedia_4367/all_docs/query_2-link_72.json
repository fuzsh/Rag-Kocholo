        "text": "Steve Graham has been in the music business for more than 25 years and has written more songs than he can remember.\n\nAs a young musician in Newcastle upon Tyne in the North East of England, he would learn the art of entertaining through the world of rock music and was quickly signed by International Manager/Record Producer, Chas Chandler.\n\nChas Chandler was manager and also record producer for 60's legend, Jimi Hendrix and 70's rock group, Slade.\n\nChas had also been a top selling artist in his own right with sixties band The Animals. The collaboration with Chas proved to be invaluable to Steve as he learned his craft from a master.\n\n​\n\nIt was during this time, The Steve Graham Band was formed and went on to open for industry icons such as Sting and the Police, Bryan Adams, Tina Turner, Michael Macdonald. Jeff Wayne, Electric Light Orchestra , U2, Jools Holland, Rick Wakeman, Dire Straits, Marillion, Status Quo and many more.\n\n​\n\nAfter 20 years performing in Dubai, Steve is now based in Ballito, South Africa where he continues to entertain a new generation of fans who love live music."
