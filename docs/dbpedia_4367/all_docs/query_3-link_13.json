Chas first subtly appears entering Liv Aberdine's apartment building where he engraves the Eye of Horus on Liv's front door.\n\nLater, near Liv's workplace, Chas is introduced to her by John. He expresses his gladness of her safety. Afterwards, while driving to Jasper Winter's house, the taxi is hit by a large lorry.

As a result, for every time that he is killed, he is brought back using one of the remaining 47 lives. His body will as a result will heal itself back to normal, regardless of the extent of his injuries. For example, having his throat slit and dying from blood loss, will result, after a period of time, for the cut to close up and his body to return to life.

For example, when he blew himself up alongside Felix Faust, it took an entire night and morning for him to resurrect.\n\nHealing Factor - Chas can also heal from minor injuries without leaving a scar.\n\nNotes[]\n\nHis movie-counterpart is named Chas Kramer\n\nChas has a daughter and an Ex-Wife.\n\nAs of Quid Pro Quo, Chas has 30 remaining lives left before he will experience his final death.\n\nReferences[]\n\nSee Also[]"
